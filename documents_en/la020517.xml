<LD>Legendary surfer George Downing had never even heard of Abercrombie &amp;
Fitch when he learned the popular clothing line had published his
photo in its 1999 catalog hawking beachwear. "When I heard of the
name, I thought they were stockbrokers," he said by phone Thursday,
calling from the U.S. District Court in downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   When the 72-year-old Hawaii resident got a look at the glossy
pages, however, he was startled to find a 1960s-era photo featuring
him and 11 other surfers next to a series of provocative photos of
models who appeared to be surfing nude. The photo spread was titled
"Surf Nekkid" and was used to sell replicas of the T-shirts and
shorts that the surfers wore in the picture, Downing said.</LD>
<LD>   "I was ... angry about how they took away this right of mine by
using something in a publication I felt [was so] offensive that I
wouldn't want to show it to my grandchildren, and [that was]
attempting to describe the sport as something it wasn't," Downing
said. (Abercrombie &amp; Fitch representatives were not available for
comment.)</LD>
<TE>   Downing rallied six other surfers from the photo, including Paul
Strauch, Rick Steere, Richard "Buffalo" Keaulana, Ben Aipa Joey
Cabell and Mike Doyle, and filed suit against Abercrombie &amp; Fitch,
claiming that the Ohio-based company had violated their right to
privacy and defamed their character by publishing the photo without
permission. (Of the five pictured surfers who aren't party to the
lawsuit, two have a case against Abercrombie &amp; Fitch pending before
the 9th U.S. District Court of Appeals, two others couldn't be
located and one is dead.)</TE>
<TE>   The surfers are suing for punitive and real damages, which by
their estimate equals the $9 million they say the company made from
catalog sales of the T-shirts and shorts.</TE>
<TE>   The photo, taken after a surfing contest on Makaha Beach in
Hawaii, features the 12 young surfers wearing numbered T-shirts and
standing on the sand in front of their surfboards. Their names were
handwritten under each individual's picture. U.S. District Judge
Manuel Real threw the case out in 2000 on numerous grounds, including
the company's 1st Amendment right to use the image, according to the
plaintiffs. The surfers appealed his ruling and won.</TE>
<TE>   The case returned to Real's courtroom for a jury trial that began
Tuesday. The trial is scheduled to resume today.</TE>
<TE>   Queen of the Boogie Still Woogies</TE>
<TE>   With sparkly eyes rivaling the sequins on her dress, Hadda Brooks
sashayed between the tables at Michael's Room on Vermont Avenue on
Wednesday night, flirting and singing. At the cocktail lounge, it was
standing room only as a crowd of about 50 fans gathered to hear the
85-year-old "Queen of Boogie" go through a repertoire of blues and
ballads.</TE>
<TE>   Backed by "the Senator," her 79-year-old stand-up bassist Eugene
Wright, Brooks played the piano and told stories about encounters
with Humphrey Bogart and Jack Nicholson, as little butterfly clips
bounced in her hair. "I've never met a man so delightful, so sweet,"
she said of Bogart, remembering a breakfast at his house many years
ago. And Nicholson? After a compliment from the actor, she recalled,
she made this tart reply: "And who are you?"</TE>
<TE>   In addition to making music for five decades, Brooks has appeared
in several films, including "In a Lonely Place" with Bogart and "The
Crossing Guard," with Nicholson. In the 1950s, she became the first
black woman to host her own television show.</TE>
<TE>   Resting her chin on her palm, 35-year-old Gianna Chachere sighed
as the singer made her way through "Don't Go to Strangers." Next to
Chachere in the leather booth was a little bouquet of orchids she had
brought Brooks. "It's good to see her again," said Chachere who had
caught one of the singer's performances in New Orleans. "She's a
sweet version of Nina Simone. They were in similar circumstances
being black female pianists in the 1950s and '60s," she said. "But
Brooks came out of it with a sweet disposition." She repeated,
dreamily. "The sweetness ... the butterflies."</TE>
<TE>   A guest on the outdoor patio stuck a cell phone through a crack in
the door to share Brooks with a person on the other end. A couple fed
each other risotto, as others hummed into their martinis.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks turned to Austin Young, who was filming her for the
documentary, "Hadda Brooks--Queen of the Boogie." "I'm done with
you," she said, as she struck a pose for the camera. (Young and his
partner, 41-year-old Barry Pett, have followed the singer for three
years. "She still goes out every night," Pett said. "Daddy's,
Goldfingers." Wherever she goes, he said, doormen and bartenders know
her. "Her [drink] will be on the bar.")</TE>
<TE>   Dean Miller, former owner of the Shim Sham Club in New Orleans,
said he booked Brooks when he ran Mr. Phat's Royal Martini Club night
at the Viper Room several years ago. "This woman is the queen of the
boogie-woogie," he said. And the Senator "is a jazz great." For
filmmaker Darryl Wharton-Rigby, 33, this was a Brooks first.</TE>
<TE>   "God was working tonight," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, but the diva wasn't quite happy.</TE>
<TE>   "After 50 years in show business," she said, "I had to bring my
own piano."</TE>

<TE>   Bobbitt's Place</TE>
<TE>   In an ironic twist, John Wayne Bobbitt, who was arrested Monday in
Las Vegas for allegedly beating his wife, has been replaced by a
woman on the Fox TV show "Celebrity Boxing 2." Bobbitt was removed
from the show after his arrest and replaced by professional wrestler
Joanie Laurer, known in the ring as Chyna and popular because she
only wrestles men. Laurer wrestled Joey Buttafuoco in a taped match
Tuesday that will air Wednesday.</TE>

<LD>A DOG YEAR</LD>
<LD>   Twelve Months, Four</LD>
<LD>   Dogs, and Me</LD>
<TE>   By Jon Katz</TE>
<TE>   Villard</TE>
<TE>   202 pages, $21.95</TE>
<TE>   Border collies are strange animals. Obsessive, territorial,
curious and possessed with an unsettling intelligence, these dogs are
not typical family pets. Jon Katz learned that fact the hard way, and
in "A Dog Year" he chronicles his tumultuous relationship with Devon,
the 2-year-old border collie who changed his life in ways he never
expected.</TE>
<TE>   What distinguishes Katz's witty canine account from most others is
his abstention from sentimentality--no baby-talk with his pets, no
treating them as if they were adorable children. Since boyhood, Katz
has been an ardent dog lover--perhaps to an extent that troubles his
wife, to whom he dedicates the book: "For Paula, who loves dogs, but
not this much." Yet he possesses what can only be described as
profound admiration for them and remarkable empathy. "Dogs live on a
scale that I can comprehend; their lives are an outcome I can
affect," he writes. "They make me happy, satisfy me deeply, anchor me
in an elemental way."</TE>
<TE>   Katz also admits that though it's sometimes challenging for him to
trust other people, he does trust his dogs. "They would do anything
for me, and I for them." Of course there are four dogs mentioned in
the book's title, but the fourth (unbelievably, an additional border
collie, named Homer) comes much later.</TE>
<TE>   The narrative focus is upon the author's relationship with the
intense, high-strung Devon, and with Julius and Stanley, the two
angelic yellow Labrador retrievers ("attentive, smart, calm, and
loving") who already live with the Katz family. Katz adopts Devon
into his suburban New Jersey home after getting a call from a Texas
breeder who read his previous book, "Running to the Mountain," and
who thinks that Katz is the perfect companion for this "uncommonly
bright, willful, and emotionally beat up" dog.</TE>
<TE>   Although he knows that border collies are moody, need space to
roam, despise inactivity and often try to herd other animals in the
absence of sheep, Katz finally gives in. He confesses a love for
challenges and has always been fascinated by border collies. "I felt
anxious, dubious, excited, strongly pulled toward something that made
no sense," Katz writes.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after Devon arrives, his owner gives him the apt nickname
"Helldog." Stunning in appearance yet utterly disobedient, Devon
displays bad behavior astonishing for its boldness. He repeatedly
escapes from his fenced backyard, even attempting one day to herd a
school bus. He jumps on top of a moving van. When left in the house
alone, he opens cabinets, makes neat piles of shoes and moves loaves
of bread (unwrapped) to an upstairs bedroom. Most disturbing of all,
Devon is a dog who knows how to cover his tracks: After he squeezes
through a narrow opening in the backyard fence, thanks to a loose
slat, he turns around and slides the slat back into position.
Eventually, he learns to open the porch screen door with his left
paw. And whenever Katz tries to discipline him, Devon offers nothing
but a calm, defiant glare in return.</TE>
<TE>   Although this family drama might seem uncompelling to the outsider
(or even, perhaps, to Katz's stoic, good-natured wife), "A Dog Year"
is more than a man-versus-dog story. That might not be so if Devon,
"[e]qual parts manic and panic," were not portrayed as such a
fascinating creature. While Katz presents himself as a genial,
average suburban middle-aged guy, he describes Devon as insecure and
endlessly complex. "He was a split personality," Katz writes,
"fiercely proud and willful, but at the same time lonely and
defeated, with a sense of anxious despair about him. His eyes were
sometimes deep and mournful wells." Through this troubled soul, Katz,
a happily married man and devoted father, begins to understand
himself better. And he learns to practice patience in a way he has
never experienced.</TE>
<TE>   The noble, aging Julius and Stanley are equally rich characters,
tolerant of the new addition to the family, if more than a little
perplexed. But it's the "contest of wills and wile" between Katz and
Devon that proves most engaging, as well as comical. Katz's
determination to integrate the emotionally battered dog into his
otherwise happy family is astonishing, and when he finally gains
Devon's trust and respect, his exultation is palpable.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the book, you get the sense that the battle is not
quite over but that the two have formed a deep bond. "Had Devon been
a person," he writes, "and our relationship had turned that
confrontational, we would have gone into therapy together. There was
no question that I had come to love him deeply." He concludes that
his dog "had known all along what I wanted from him, he just wasn't
convinced he ought to do it."</TE>
<TE>   The adventures described in "A Dog Year" are the stuff of great
fiction: heroic rescues (of both the author and his dogs); spiritual
retreats to the upstate New York cabin made famous in "Running to the
Mountain"; and terrible experiences with illness and loss. (Anyone
who has lived through a dog's death knows that it's like losing a
member of the family.) Along the way, Katz offers helpful advice on
training and reveals what he has learned about himself through his
dogs. Part cautionary tale, part love story, "A Dog Year" reminds us
that adopting a pet is a massive responsibility but one that rewards
the owner with a much richer, more meaningful life.</TE>

<DH>A fascination with burlesque and the sex-kitten look--check
out the Pussycat Dolls--finds its way into fashion</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With scissors at the ready, Kathy Fischer kneels in front of a
14-inch, silver fringe skirt. "Too long," Robin Antin says, holding
the postage-stamp-sized garment up to her tiny waist.</LD>
<LD>   Snip, snip, snip.</LD>
<LD>   "Shorter, shorter!"</LD>
<TE>   There's no skirt too short or corset too tight for the Pussycat
Dolls. When Antin created the burlesque group seven years ago to
perform as an opening act at Johnny Depp's Viper Room, costuming it
was a one-woman show.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just me and my sewing machine," the professional dancer
and choreographer says, pulling a few of the group's original
corsets, now in tatters, out of a brown paper grocery bag.</TE>
<TE>   But now that the Pussycat Dolls are presenting an expanded show at
the Roxy, Antin has amped up their sultry look, with some help from
L.A. designer Deborah Lindquist and Fischer, a Pilates teacher turned
fashion student.</TE>
<TE>   There's nary a bare nipple in the hourlong musical revue, which
has a cast of seasoned dancers and high-profile headliners such as
Carmen Electra and Nikka Costa, wearing everything from hot-pink
corsets and garter belts to GI jackets and ruffled bloomers.</TE>
<TE>   On stage, the results are captivating. The costumes speak to the
current infatuation with sex kittens and burlesque.</TE>
<TE>   The bustiers and tulle skirts in the film "Moulin Rouge" last
spring didn't go unnoticed by Yves Saint Laurent and Nicolas
Ghesquiere of Balenciaga, who sent similar looks down the runways.</TE>
<TE>   Even Frederick's of Hollywood, the legendary lingerie retailer, is
enjoying renewed interest in its vampy corsets and bustiers.</TE>
<TE>   The appeal of burlesque fashion? "It's a fantasy that's more fun
than sexual," says Antin, who has worked with Gwen Stefani and Ricky
Martin. "And the costumes are part of that," the 32-year-old adds,
sitting down on the coffee table in Fischer's Westwood apartment,
which has served as an atelier for the past two months.</TE>
<TE>   Using the pinup art of Alberto Vargas (creator of the '40s-era
Vargas girl) and Gil Elvgrin as a guide, Lindquist, 45, and Fischer,
38, scoured swap meets and Army surplus stores across the Southland
for vintage lingerie and military wear.</TE>
<TE>   For a USO number, the designers replaced the backs of Marine
dress-blue jackets with corset lacing and added rhinestone trim to
the pockets. A navy-blue sailor shirt was updated with
three-quarter-length sleeves and grosgrain bows at the elbows. Bras
were covered with decorator ribbon in a stars-and-stripes pattern and
emblazoned with vintage anchor patches.</TE>
<TE>   A beach scene comes alive with 1920s-inspired bathing costumes. To
create a nautical feel, the designers added black grosgrain lacing to
the sleeves of a cropped pink and white striped spandex shirt.
Antin's mother, Brenda Antin, supplied vintage life preservers from
her antiques shop.</TE>
<TE>   And the work didn't end there. Many of the 300 pieces had to be
hand-sewn so that the rhinestones, sequins and ribbon would stay put
during vigorous dance moves.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer secured fuchsia ruffles and silver paillettes to a pair of
pink panties found at a thrift store, and decorated a black sequined
corset with gold stars for Electra.</TE>
<TE>   MAC makeup artists completed the doll look with false eyelashes,
sometimes as many as three pairs for each performer. They pressed
glitter into red lipstick before applying it, and used blush from
MAC's "Dolled Up" line on the apples of cheeks.</TE>
<TE>   The Pussycat Dolls are just one incarnation of what has become a
full-fledged burlesque craze. Founded in 1995, Velvet Hammer is also
an underground favorite in L.A., playing at different venues. Regular
women are getting in on the act too. Crunch Gym in West Hollywood
began offering a "Cardio Striptease" class last year. Actress Sheila
Kelley has a waiting list for the 90-minute "Stripping for the
Everyday Woman" classes she teaches at her backyard studio in Hancock
Park. Even Frederick's of Hollywood has made a comeback. During L.A.
fashion week last month, the legendary lingerie retailer staged a
steamy fashion show at hip boite Star Shoes, combining lacy looks
from the vaults with new pieces.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen a major increase in sales of the classic Frederick's
styles, including corsets and bustiers," says Frederick's president
and chief executive, Linda LoRe. "Particularly now, we are seeing the
younger generation of women who are empowered by their sexuality and
regard their femininity as a positive and powerful force."</TE>
<TE>   Come fall, sex kittens are still likely to be purring. On the
runway in Milan, Prada showed playful peignoir sets and teddies. At
Moschino, models draped themselves seductively over a ballet bar,
creating a striptease vibe, while Zac Posen's girls vamped it up in
the spirit of 1930s Hollywood vixens.</TE>
<TE>   Corsets continue to inspire accessories too, such as Lulu
Guinness' "lace corset tote" and Alexander McQueen's Victorian
lace-up boots, both available this fall.</TE>
<TE>   So it's no surprise that the Pussycat Dolls are toying with the
idea of launching a clothing line of their own. Because as Lindquist
puts it, "There's a little Pussycat Doll in everyone."</TE>

<HD>Writer Still Has 'Axis' to Grind</HD>
<DH>Former White House speechwriter David Frum trumpets
conservative ideals and has a sweet book deal</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DONNA PERLMUTTER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not exactly clear whether David Frum knew that his phrase "axis
of evil" would send shudders of fear and anger throughout the world
when President Bush uttered it in the State of the Union address in
January.</LD>
<LD>   But, says Frum, who coined the unforgettable invective to describe
North Korea, Iraq and Iran, "I had a pretty good idea it would be
remembered."</LD>
<LD>   What came next, though, could've been a bit of a surprise. Before
the White House speechwriter had a chance to savor his salvo, he was
unemployed, and the Washington Beltway was buzzing about his sudden
departure from the job he had held for only 13 months.</LD>
<TE>   As he resurfaces locally on a weekly political talk show, Frum is
circumspect about the drama that led to his sudden change in status.
He'd "had conversations about resigning" days before the speech, he
says. "I was tired."</TE>
<TE>   But most people think that he didn't jump--he was pushed. Frum,
after all, had committed the ultimate no-no in the famously
disciplined, leak-averse Bush White House: taking credit for the
"axis of evil" passage and thus deflecting attention from the
president. "Nobody does that with George W. Bush and stays very
long," said conservative commentator Robert Novak on CNN.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, it was Frum's wife, writer Danielle Crittenden, who
landed him in the doghouse. First word of Frum's authorship appeared
in the Toronto Sun, where Crittenden's father is a columnist. Then
Slate.com published an e-mail she'd posted to friends and family, in
which she speaks of acting on her "wifely pride" and relishing the
fact that her husband's words could stand alongside such recognizable
advertising slogans as "the pause that refreshes." His phrase, she
wrote, would be "repeated in headlines everywhere!"</TE>
<TE>   In short order, headlines were also repeating news of Frum's exit.</TE>
<TE>   Once speculation began about whether he left his $85,000-a-year
post voluntarily or involuntarily, the White House issued word that
Frum and his family were away on a much-needed vacation at an
unreachable Mexican location. The messy matter accelerated when a
reporter (Elisabeth Bumiller, New York Times) found them at their
home in northwest Washington--which Frum explains as a
misunderstanding over dates.</TE>
<TE>   He offers various versions of what he calls "the-I-was-fired"
story:</TE>
<TE>   "First is the North Korean version, explained by a press agent
from that country who says I was forced out by the wrath of the
world. And then there's the Beltway version, which says that the
White House was mad at me [because of the leak]. Both are untrue."</TE>
<TE>   His wife, who had agreed to comment to the Los Angeles Times on
the imbroglio (she says it had her feeling "like Lucy Ricardo"),
reneged an hour later.</TE>
<TE>   It's been several months since all that notoriety, and Frum now
works out of a downtown Washington office made available to him by
the American Enterprise Institute, the free-market think tank. He
couldn't have engineered a softer landing. Before he packed his bags
in the Old Executive Office Building in late February, he'd landed
the book deal of his life--only one week after the leak and its
attendant media brouhaha.</TE>
<TE>   "Oodles and oodles of money," is how Jennifer Rudolph Walsh, his
agent at William Morris, describes the amount. "I had lunch with
Random House publisher Ann Godoff the second week in February, and
she said yes right away," says Walsh. Dollar figures were not
forthcoming anywhere, least of all from a tight-lipped Frum.</TE>
<TE>   These days, the Toronto native, a graduate of Yale and Harvard
Law, is frantically working to complete the manuscript of "The
Surprise Presidency: The Transformation of George W. Bush," which
he's promised to deliver by the end of the summer. (It's a fourth
book from the former Weekly Standard columnist whose last two were
2000's "How We Got Here" and 1995's "Dead Right," both from Basic
Books.) At home on a late afternoon, the 41-year-old champion of
Republican conservatism settles down to a phone conversation, and
apologizes for the occasional sniffling from his "terrible cold."</TE>
<TE>   He responds eagerly to questions about how he arrived at the
worldview that led to his "axis of evil" formulation, a perspective
that he's again offering radio listeners on KCRW-FM's "Left, Right
and Center," which he helped originate six years ago. The show
filters the day's news through the leanings of Frum (right, of
course); Matt Miller, who moderates from the middle; columnist
Arianna Huffington (floating above the fray) and columnist Robert
Scheer (left).</TE>
<TE>   "I've been politically conservative all my adult life," Frum says
firmly, and today he embraces a "might makes right" American
nationalism.</TE>
<TE>   "After 9/11 happened, those on the non-right asked, 'Why is the
rest of the world mad at us?'" Which is wrongheaded, he says. "But
for conservatives, the rest of the world ought to be worried about
what we think of them. When 15 Saudi nationals crash a plane into
[American buildings], the question is 'What's wrong with Saudi
Arabia?,' not 'What's wrong with America?'"</TE>
<TE>   Yet others argue that this is a myopic, unilateral view. As many
on the "non-right" see it, the "talk big and scare 'em" strategy not
only conjures up memories of World War II's Axis powers (Germany,
Italy and Japan), but boldly brands as enemy nations the West is
trying to urge toward democracy.</TE>
<TE>   The fallout from "axis of evil" prompted Sen. Joe Biden (D-Del.),
chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, to say that the White
House needed to do considerable backpedaling. Small steps toward
loosening the hard line within the government of Iran had been
thwarted by the harsh rhetoric, he said. The Tehran "street" erupted
and, according to PBS' "Frontline" investigation "Terror and Tehran,"
at least one of Iran's reformers was subsequently arrested for
treason.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't surprised at the world reaction and negative consensus
on the 'axis of evil' designation," says Frum. "But I think that
reaction was very wrong. The unwillingness of some democratic
countries to see evil as it is and call it by its name is not a sign
of wisdom but of weakness. And what we have is a moral clash, not
just a clash of interests. These regimes we're fighting are as wicked
as our planet has ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   European leaders, while cognizant of the dangers, take a more
tempered approach. But Frum has his own idea of why they and less
nationalistic Americans don't share his proactive position:</TE>
<TE>   "There are people who hear a sound in the basement and say, 'I'm
sure it's nothing.' They don't look downstairs. And there others who
say, 'It might be something. Let me go check.'"</TE>
<TE>   While his black-and-white view doesn't allow for alternatives that
take more factors into consideration, it clearly defines the
Republican conservative wing, according to Frum. "The Republicans are
the party of liberty," he says, talking about capitalism and the
free-market system. "They're confident that if you leave people to
make their own decisions for themselves they will do the right and
wise thing. Free choice produces the greatest good for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   On "Left, Right and Center," an in-depth, entertainingly civilized
yet passionate debate, Frum holds forth with his crisp, rapid-fire
delivery. And he stands up to his two opponents. He calls Scheer
"someone who has more in common with [recently defeated French
rightist Jean-Marie] Le Pen than with me ... and someone so far left
that there's no national Democratic candidate he could vote for."</TE>
<TE>   Scheer refutes that assertion as "nonsense" and says, "I felt very
comfortable voting for Clinton, and I don't believe in dismissing
people. Tell Frum to take it back. But he's great," says Mr. Left,
good-naturedly. "All our right-wingers have been good."</TE>
<TE>   Huffington says she enjoys sparring with Frum: "He's not a person
with knee-jerk opinions but is someone who's well-read and capable of
arguing in depth. The 'axis of evil' argument is one that we'll be
debating with him about."</TE>
<TE>   The ex-speechwriter is also reliving his "axis of evil" days by
way of his book, which is due out in January. And it seems the White
House will have nothing to worry about with author assessments like
this:</TE>
<TE>   "Bush got things right [in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks].
He wasn't too hot or too cold, too bellicose or too pacific. He
didn't make it sound like it would be too easy or too hard. And all
this against the narrow mandate and low expectations people had for
him."</TE>
<TE>   If there is either regret or rationalization about the precipitous
end to his dream job, he's not telling.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me put it this way," he says. "Asking why one leaves the
White House is like asking why he stops running 440-meter sprints.
The legs give out.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy we expect to stay for eight years has his own doctor on
call."</TE>

<CX>   Speech writer's departure--A May 20 story in Southern California
Living recapped the circumstances under which ex-White House
speechwriter David Frum left his job shortly after his "axis of evil"
line appeared in President Bush's State of the Union address. The
story was incomplete. It failed to report that Frum had submitted his
resignation Jan. 24, before the speech was delivered and before
controversy over the line erupted.</CX>

<LD>Rhythm</LD>
<LD>   Have you ever paid attention to the pattern and flow of the words
that you speak and read? Books by Dr. Seuss are especially wonderful
because they have such crazy meter and rhyme.</LD>
<LD>   Most music is made up of patterns of strong and weak sounds (or
beats) and silences. These patterns are called rhythms. Rhythm helps
to create a driving force or sense of motion and also adds an element
of excitement to music.</LD>
<TE>   You can discover rhythm patterns in the words that you use. For
example, the word "orange" has a pattern of two beats, or syllables:
or-ange. The word "basketball" has a pattern of three beats:
bas-ket-ball. And most people pronounce the word "California" to a
pattern of four beats: Cal-i-for-nia.</TE>
<TE>   When you say these words, you might notice that certain syllables
are stronger than others. In the words "orange" and "basketball," the
first syllables are stronger (or more accented) than the others:
or-ange; bas-ket-ball. In the word "California," the third syllable
is the strong one: Cal-i-for-nia.</TE>
<TE>   When composers want certain sounds in their music to be stronger
than others, they use accent marks. Accent marks look like this:
&amp;gt;. They are placed above or below the note.</TE>
<TE>   Look at the picture to see how a composer might replace these
words with musical notes, then try writing out rhythms or beat
patterns yourself. Use words from your favorite story or try writing
the pattern for names like Al-ex-an-der, Jon-a-than or Bet-sy.</TE>
<TE>   Learn more about music and rhythm at the Los Angeles Chamber
Orchestra's family concert Sunday at the Alex Theatre in Glendale.
You can hear the books "Green Eggs and Ham" and "Gertrude McFuzz" by
Dr. Seuss put to music by composer Robert Kapilow. For tickets and
more information, call the L.A. Chamber Orchestra at (213) 622-7001
Ext. 215. Tickets are also available at the Alex Theatre box office.</TE>

sounds should be stronger by putting marks above or below the notes,

<HD>Girlfriends Leave Courtroom for the Creativity of the Kiln</HD>
<DH>Two former lawyers' longtime camaraderie has blossomed into
a handmade bauble business</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL QUINTANILLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Liz Price isn't totally pleased with her clay creation, a flower with
five pointy petals. So like a carefree kid she mashes the blossom,
pounding her right hand as if slamming down a gavel.</LD>
<LD>   "If only I could have done this to a few people I knew in my other
life," says Price, a former administrative judge. Standing nearby,
nodding, is her best friend, Myra Amorosi, a former criminal lawyer.</LD>
<LD>   The women, both retired and living in the Los Angeles area, have
been girlfriends for more than 40 years since meeting in Washington,
D.C., during their college days. Now their friendship and shared love
for flowers finds them on a new adventure: an at-home jewelry-making
venture called Chiuri, Sicilian for "flower." But the new fashion
partnership is less about making the pages of InStyle than it is
about a bond between two women who are like sisters in their hearts,
and in conversations even finish each other's sentences.</LD>
<TE>   Liz: "We have an unwritten pact that we are there for each other.
That's all I want out of a friend and that's the kind of friend I
want to be. So what we do with the clay is very secondary."</TE>
<TE>   Myra: "We really are intimately connected with the private parts
of our lives. Whether the jewelry takes off or doesn't ... "</TE>
<TE>   Liz: " ... it doesn't matter. But it has changed my life. Myra,
you know, we were geared toward books, law, citations ..."</TE>
<TE>   Myra: "Courtroom battles ... "</TE>
<TE>   Liz: "And making jewelry is so different from what we've ever done
before. For me, it's just nice to go into a corner like that--and
with a block of clay, of all things, in your hand that ... "</TE>
<TE>   Myra: " ... you can roll up, mush and start over again."</TE>
<TE>   Liz: "And that's so very unlike life."</TE>
<TE>   About the only thing they knew about jewelry back in their law
career days was wearing it with their power suits. Price earned her
law degree in 1965 when, she says, "it was not fashionable for women
to attend law school. There were four women in a class of 180
students and all four of us graduated. Only 35 men did."</TE>
<TE>   "Law was never my passion, let alone to my liking," says Price who
has been a judge on an Indiana commission and an IRS attorney. After
she and her husband, Jerry, also a lawyer, moved to California in
1969, she taught law in Orange County and later served as dean of a
Van Nuys paralegal school.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve years ago--"way too late in my life," she says--she
discovered her real passion: "to make things, to create stuff for
people and occasions." That was when she started Por Favor, a party
and novelty-making business she operates out of her home.</TE>
<TE>   Amorosi, in contrast, couldn't wait to take on a case after
passing the California bar in 1977. She practiced law for 22 years
until her mother died three years ago. As Amorosi was flying back to
California from the funeral, she had an epiphany.</TE>
<TE>   "I had this terrible guilt about this terrible thing I'd done. I
had taken my two sons away from my mother who was living back East
and she wasn't a part of their lives. And I swore that wasn't going
to happen to me and my grandchildren--not that I even see them as
much as I want to now," she says about the children who live in
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Near retirement in her government job, Amorosi quit, forfeiting
benefits such as lifetime health insurance. Her second husband,
Edward, a neurologist, told her, "'It's not about money; do what you
want to do.' And I'm doing exactly that. My world then, with law, is
not my world now. I'm making jewelry with my best friend."</TE>
<TE>   Their business took seed less than two years ago after Amorosi
could not find a particular glass necklace for a friend while on a
trip to Murano, Italy. So she bought miniature glass flowers instead,
and made a necklace with them. Her pal loved it. So did Price, who
knew right then she and Amorosi should go into the jewelry biz.</TE>
<TE>   Liz: "We are self-taught. We didn't even ..."</TE>
<TE>   Myra: "know where to buy the clay."</TE>
<TE>   Liz: "I bought a book, 'Beginning Ceramics.' It had about 20 pages
in it. I brought Myra over some clay and said ..."</TE>
<TE>   Myra: " 'Make me some pansies.' But I didn't have any tools."</TE>
<TE>   Liz: " 'Go get a kitchen knife and a roller pin,' I told her."</TE>
<TE>   Myra: "True. And then she said ...</TE>
<TE>   Liz: "''Make me some calla lilies.' And she did it."</TE>
<TE>   Myra: "Trial and error, I say."</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's in Price's living room in Hollywood or Amorosi's
Marina del Rey garage, they casually handcraft porcelain
jewelry--from clay to finished glazed and painted product--and adorn
the pieces with Austrian crystal, glass beads, semiprecious stones
and antique clasps. Their traveling kiln is almost always firing up
one of the many one-of-a-kind pieces that take two to three days to
make and sell for $150 through word-of-mouth and on their Web site
(www.chiuri.com).</TE>
<TE>   They love flowers. Real petals are patterns for the big, chunky
clay posies that have become popular draws at charity events. Their
donated necklaces have brought in as much as $250 apiece from bidders
at silent auction fund-raisers for nonprofit groups such as the Boys
&amp; Girls Club of Santa Clarita Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Price's daughter, Jennifer--their fashion maven--is a publicist
who wore a stunning Swarovski crystal-embellished black flower on a
17-inch necklace while working with the media on the red carpet at
the Emmys earlier this year. Her necklace caught the attention of
many who have since placed orders.</TE>
<TE>   Television's Judge Judy Sheindlin is a fan and even suggested to
Price that she mold her a smaller strand of flowers because even
though The Judge is as tough as The Rock, she's a petite woman.</TE>
<TE>   Price wasn't about to say "I object."</TE>
<TE>   Liz: "Now, we've got the science of all this down pat."</TE>
<TE>   Myra: "But I'm still a little ticked at you for not being more
interested in my calla lilies. I think they're beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Liz: "They are."</TE>
<TE>   Myra: "Thanks. See, you can't hold a grudge with a friend. You
have to be forgiving."</TE>
<TE>   Liz: "And you have to give as much as you expect to get."</TE>
<TE>   Myra: "And you can't have demands on friends. You don't own
friends."</TE>
<TE>   Liz: "That's right."</TE>
<TE>   Myra: "Right. After all, I have no idea how much longer I'll be
here."</TE>
<TE>   Liz: "Myra if you stick me with those necklaces and leave me by
myself--I'll never forgive you."</TE>

<HD>Knit One, Sell Two</HD>
<DH>Designer's country-girl knitwear is flying off shelves in
chichi shops</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Kate O'Connor loaded up her pickup truck and headed cross
country for California two years ago, she never dreamed she would
have a line of knitwear on sale at the crossroads of L.A. style: Ron
Herman on Melrose Avenue. Or that her handmade ponchos, shawls,
apron-tops and dresses, almost painterly in their color combinations,
would be selling out in a matter of hours to celebs like Sheryl Crow,
Cameron Diaz and Kelly Osbourne.</LD>
<LD>   "Are you kidding?" the fresh-faced 27-year-old says, surrounded by
multicolored spools of silk, mohair and alpaca thread at her Los
Angeles studio. "I was intimidated even to go into the parking lot of
Ron Herman."</LD>
<LD>   O'Connor's sexy, one-of-a-kind pieces are selling elsewhere
too--Pearl in Santa Monica and Henri Bendel in New York--thanks to
the Boho chic trend storming the streets.</LD>
<TE>   Barefoot and dressed in a floor-skimming bluejean skirt emblazoned
with the words "I dig your sexy tractor" and an off-the-shoulder
black sweater, the designer is a country girl at heart. She grew up
on a farm in Lowville, N.Y., the daughter of a large-animal
veterinarian.</TE>
<TE>   After high school, she went to the Maryland Institute College of
Art in Baltimore, where she used miles of thread in her
installation-based performance art pieces. She began to apply her
skills to wearable art. After her work became a hit at the Telluride
AIDS Benefit fashion show in Colorado, O'Connor decided she was ready
for the big time.</TE>
<TE>   Her first gig in L.A. was knitting hats for the Anna Sui store on
Sunset Boulevard. Longing to do bigger projects, last year she
contacted the local branch of the Knitting Guild in hopes of finding
someone who could teach her to use a knitting machine to create
fabric. That person was Joyce Oliver, a retired computer programmer
who lives in South-Central L.A. and runs a private knitting business.</TE>
<TE>   "I taught her how to use a knitting machine, and she went crazy
with it," Oliver says.</TE>
<TE>   "We would sit around and listen to [neo-soul songstress] Jill
Scott," O'Connor recalls of her training at Oliver's house. "Her
stuff is the bomb" she says of her teacher's designs.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connor had her own knitting machine--a flea-market find she was
never able to use--shipped out from Baltimore, where it had been in
storage for more than a year. Then, in her matchbox-sized apartment
on Franklin Avenue in Hollywood, she began spinning her dream.</TE>
<TE>   The closet was the only place where the machine would fit, so it
was there that she worked late into the night. "My neighbors must
have thought I was an obsessive exerciser because of all the noise
the machine made," she says.</TE>
<TE>   In November, a couple of stylist friends convinced her to take
some of her creations to the Ron Herman store, where local designers
often go for a kind of fashion audition. There, like so many others,
she was "discovered" by buyer John Eshaya, who walked by when a
saleswoman was trying on a top.</TE>
<TE>   Eshaya bought 20 pieces on the spot, and by 2 p.m. the next day
they were sold out. "They are so individual and special," he says.
"And they are hippie without being too hippie."</TE>
<TE>   O'Connor's lightweight knitwear is not cheap: Ponchos are $275,
asymmetrical wrap tops run about $365 and custom gowns can be as much
as $3,000. But each garment is handmade (it takes her about six hours
to make a poncho).</TE>
<TE>   Part of the appeal of O'Connor's work may be that she has no
formal training. "The patterns, striping and fringe are imperfect,"
she says, throwing a handful of Polaroids down on the studio's
hardwood floor to illustrate her point. "I don't know much about the
fashion industry, so my biggest influence is color, and then I figure
out how it will fit the body."</TE>
<TE>   For fall, she'll debut a small line of about 1,200 pieces that
will be distributed to other stores. Now that her dream is coming
true, O'Connor finds it hard to believe. "Every day it's becoming
more real," she says. "In L.A., it's amazing how you get that one
piece of exposure and doors open for you."</TE>

<HD>Should She Prevent a Fashion Catastrophe?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: My dear friend, who will be attending an
important wedding soon, has found an outfit at a fashionable resale
shop. She is very excited about it, especially considering the deal
she thinks she got. How do I tell her that it is straight out of the
1980s? Or, should I just keep my mouth shut and let her enjoy her
find?</LD>
<LD>   --ON THE FENCE</LD>
<LD>   Dear On: We've all been where you are right now--teetering between
doing a good deed and completely demolishing a friendship. Should we
give our unsolicited opinion, hoping to save someone we care about
from a potential fashion disaster, or merely stand back and let fate
take its course; in other words, allow those gossip hounds to howl?</LD>
<TE>   Before we start with the advice, we must remind you of one thing:
Some styles from that era are now considered hip and "vintage," and
if that makes you feel old, you're not alone. But since you're so
alarmed at her purchase we'll assume that the dress more closely
resembles a bad "Dynasty" retread than a designer's brilliant
reinterpretation of the look.</TE>
<TE>   If your friend is acutely aware of and interested in what others
think and would truly be crushed by the slightest raise of an
eyebrow, we think you should gently let her know that the dress
doesn't flatter her. Be tactful and discreet.</TE>
<TE>   If, however, she has elephant hide for skin and does what she
pleases despite the wagging of tongues, let her be. This is her
spirit and style, and to rein that in would be a shame.</TE>
<TE>   You know your friend best, but if we were to choose a course of
action, it would be the latter. The worst-case scenario is that
someone utters a snide comment right to her face, and we sincerely
doubt that will happen. Most people who attend weddings are focused
on the bride and groom and the food--not necessarily in that order.</TE>
<TE>   Two sandal-related questions came in this week; "Perplexed" asks:
I just got a pair of brown leather dressy-casual sandals. The shade
is called saddle--it's an orangy brown. I love them, but what do they
go with? I've been wearing them with all shades of brown but I'm not
sure it's right. Is brown a neutral, like black?</TE>
<TE>   And from "Gray Area," there's this question: I have a couple of
pairs of gray linen pants, but I don't know what color sandals to
wear with them. Black seems too stark, and white too light. I don't
care for metallics, and I haven't found gray sandals anywhere. What's
the solution?</TE>
<TE>   Dear Perplexed and Gray: The answer to the second question is in
the first, and the answer to the first question is yes. Confused? No
problem, we'll break it down.</TE>
<TE>   Perplexed, your saddle leather sandals are indeed a neutral. Most
brown leather shoes can be considered neutrals and can be worn with
almost all colors, from black to white to denim blue, sage green,
etc. Here are a few caveats: Your orangy-brown sandals shouldn't be
worn with reds that have blue undertones, since the colors will
clash. Also, lighter shades of leather look best with paler hues,
such as dusty pink, buttercup and periwinkle. Darker brown tones
complement bolder colors, such as black, navy, crimson and ochre.</TE>
<TE>   As for you, Gray, your pants will look great with brown leather
sandals, since, as we pointed out, it's a neutral. However, make sure
they and the pants have similar tones. For instance, charcoal goes
best with chocolate or russet browns, while pale grays go well with
lighter tans.</TE>
<TE>   Navy is another alternative that looks great with gray, and isn't
as stark a contrast as black.</TE>
<TE>   From the Fashion Police blotter: For women who like fragrances but
hate overly flowery scents that verge on sickly sweet, Tipton Charles
offers an alternative. The company's line of fragrances for body and
home really is suitable for both--you can spray them on your person,
your bed linens, around the bedroom or kitchen, even in a hamper or
closet. They're extremely light, perfect for summer, and come in such
scents as lavender, lemon verbena, basil-nectarine, ocean, cedar,
rosemary and mandarin-guava. We tried the grapefruit, which was
pleasantly citrusy with a hint of floral undertones. The products use
essential oils and are not tested on animals. A 1-ounce spray bottle
is $14; to order, call (800) 340-1075 or visit the Web site at
www.tiptoncharles.com.</TE>

<LD>"Was I a crybaby?" Jasmyn wanted to know. Mama gently laid the baby
back in her crib. She sat in the white wicker rocking chair and
motioned for Jasmyn to climb onto her lap.</LD>
<LD>   "You, my dear, had the lungs of an opera singer," said Mama,
wrapping her cozy flannel shawl around Jasmyn.</LD>
<LD>   Jasmyn giggled, "Really?"</LD>
<TE>   "In fact, Mr. Henry said he didn't need an alarm clock with a new
baby on the block," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Jasmyn laughed out loud.</TE>
<TE>   "Shhh," said Mama. "You'll wake the baby."</TE>
<TE>   Jasmyn muffled her giggles with Mama's shawl. Then Mama let loose
a giggle, then a snort sneaked out. And Baby Ashley didn't make a
single peep.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, sleepyhead. You've got a spelling bee in a few hours," Mama
said.</TE>
<TE>   She tucked Jasmyn into bed.</TE>
<TE>   "Good night, Jazz," Mama whispered. "I love you."</TE>
<TE>   "I love you too," Jasmyn whispered back.</TE>
<TE>   The spelling bee was held in the cafeteria. Mr. Zoombus, the
principal, was in charge of the contest.</TE>
<TE>   Mama, Daddy, Grandma and Aunt Jen had front-row seats. Mrs.
Fussmaker volunteered to baby-sit Baby Ashley.</TE>
<TE>   Jasmyn had a funny feeling in her tummy.</TE>
<TE>   Tali was asked to spell pepperoni.</TE>
<TE>   "P-E-P-P-O-R-O-N-I," she sounded out each letter.</TE>
<TE>   "That's incorrect," said Mr. Zoombus.</TE>
<TE>   When it was Jasmyn's turn, Grandma sat on the edge of her seat.</TE>
<TE>   "P-E-P-P-E-R-O-N-I." She spelled the word with confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "Correct!" Mr. Zoombus said.</TE>
<TE>   The funny feeling in Jasmyn's tummy was gone. And the words seemed
easier, Jasmyn thought.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the contest, the principal announced the top
winners. Jasmyn was the spelling bee champ of the third grade.</TE>
<TE>   "That's my girl!" Grandma shouted.</TE>
<TE>   Jasmyn's face felt hot. But she secretly loved the attention.</TE>
<TE>   Mama, Daddy and Aunt Jen beamed with pride, and Grandma's eyes had
a special shine.</TE>
<TE>   "H-A-P-P-Y spells happy," thought Jasmyn.</TE>

<HD>Personal Films Dig Deeper at Ground Zero</HD>
<DH>Movies* Two filmmakers asked colleagues to create short
works in response to 9/11. The results make up 'Underground Zero.'</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After the World Trade Center fell, Jay Rosenblatt and Caveh Zahedi
felt as if their usual creative obsessions as independent filmmakers
suddenly didn't amount to a hill of beans.</LD>
<LD>   Zahedi had been shooting "I Am a Sex Addict," the latest in his
series of features that focus on funny but disquieting episodes from
his life. "I was feeling pretty absurd trying to make that film, and
we were heading for World War III," he recalled. "It didn't seem very
relevant."</LD>
<LD>   Rosenblatt, his friend and a fellow San Franciscan, had been
trying to get grants to make more of the distinctive, emotionally
charged "collage-essays" he cobbles together from stock footage.</LD>
<TE>   "Like everyone else, I was completely upset," Rosenblatt says
about his reaction to 9/11. "The projects I was working on just lost
a lot of their meaning."</TE>
<TE>   The two talked about how unfocused they felt and how troubled they
were by what they saw as a monolithic, jingoistic mass-media
portrayal of the disaster and its aftermath. "We thought about
channeling our feelings into something creative, something
cathartic," Rosenblatt recalled in a recent phone conversation. Then
it occurred to them that their peers must be experiencing the same
disequilibrium.</TE>
<TE>   By Sept. 25 they had e-mailed a letter to more than 100
independent filmmakers they respected, proposing a compilation of
short, personal films responding to the disaster. "A collective
response can be more powerful and effective than isolated individual
responses," they wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The result, "Underground Zero," makes its Southern California
premiere this afternoon with a free showing at the UC Irvine Human
Rights Film Festival. Rosenblatt and Zahedi culled its 13 films,
totaling 76 minutes, from the 65 submissions they received. The
compilation has been making the rounds at film festivals; art-film
houses in San Francisco, San Rafael and Berkeley recently screened it
simultaneously for a week. Rosenblatt and Zahedi are trying to
negotiate a distribution deal and possible cable television showings.
The curators and co-producers have covered their out-of-pocket
costs--about $5,000--by securing foundation grants; they say any
proceeds will go to nonprofit organizations that work for world
peace.</TE>
<TE>   The rule for contributors was to work fast and cheap, with a
submission deadline of Jan. 1. Zahedi said that precluded trying for
name film directors--except for the small handful he and Rosenblatt
knew personally. "It would have been a lot of work trying to track
them down and get them to know us. We didn't have the energy or
time."</TE>
<TE>   The most above-ground of the "Underground Zero" contributors are
Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman, a documentary team that
individually and collectively has won several Emmys and two Oscars
(for "Common Threads: Stories From the Quilt" and "The Times of
Harvey Milk" ). Their film, "Isaiah's Rap," shows Epstein's
14-year-old nephew, who lives near ground zero, pointing out the gap
in his neighborhood's skyline, then delivering an emotional rhymed
eulogy for the victims.</TE>
<TE>   The compilation begins with "The End of Summer," which depicts
tranquil suburban scenes while a sweet-voiced, unseen little girl
tries to ponder what happened on Sept. 11. "I think maybe [the
attackers] were like the Grinch and didn't have a good heart." It
ends with "Untitled," a stark, wordless and captionless montage of
faces that only the context reveals as victims of the disaster. Some
pieces are politically pointed; others appeal to the emotions rather
than the intellect.</TE>
<TE>   Zahedi, who habitually films his own life, came up with a
true-life morality play from footage of a film course he was teaching
last fall. "The World Is a Classroom" depicts how he came to
loggerheads with a student who refused to be part of the movie he was
trying to make. Zahedi antagonized the man by trying to exert his
authority; it took a concession on his part, a sincere plea and an
apology, to end the disruptive power struggle.</TE>
<TE>   "He needed respect. He felt shamed," said Zahedi, who was raised
in a nonreligious home by Iranian Muslim immigrants. "I think that's
what the Moslems in the world who hate America are feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Rosenblatt combed his extensive film archive and was struck by the
similarity between footage he had of Arabs bowed in worship, and a
1950s civil defense film demonstrating how to "duck and cover" during
a nuclear attack. That inspired "Prayer," which he capped with a shot
of the Statue of Liberty hemmed in by dark clouds.</TE>
<TE>   "That [last image] was very important to me because I feel like
the values of this country are under assault, from within as much as
from without," he said. "Also, [it gives] the sense of 'still
standing' even though the towers have come down, a sense of standing
up to what needs to be stood up to."</TE>
<TE>   The curators say that a number of filmmakers submitted works
showing the destruction in New York. But the compilation's only
images of collapsing towers and dazed, fleeing people are flickering
on Chinese television screens in "China Diary (9/11)," New Yorker Eva
Ilona Brzeski's account of what it was like to be a world away from
home when disaster struck.</TE>
<TE>   "Our program is more interpretive and a lot less journalistic,"
Rosenblatt says. "I just hope it stimulates some good discussion and
debate, and hopefully opens some people's eyes more."</TE>
<TE>   "Underground Zero" screens for free today at 4 p.m. in Room 110 of
the Humanities Instructional Building on the UC Irvine campus. Use
the Pereira parking lot, Pereira Drive at West Peltason. (949)

<HD>Impressionist for a New Millennium</HD>
<DH>In 'Les Destinees,' French filmmaker Olivier Assayas wanted
spontaneity and lightness of touch similar to the beauty he sees in
the style of painting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over 15 years French writer-director Olivier Assayas has made an
impressive series of intimate films exploring eternal themes of love
and betrayal, life and death. They often take place in lower-end
apartments inhabited by people living on the edge or in an otherwise
marginal existence.</LD>
<LD>   None of Assayas' work surfaced outside institutional film series
and festivals until the theatrical release in 1997 of "Irma Vep," an
unexpected and amusing blast at contemporary French filmmaking that
starred Hong Kong's lovely and versatile Maggie Cheung, playing
herself as an actress trapped in a calamity-besieged production based
on Louis Feuillade's 1915 serial "Les Vampires."</LD>
<LD>   Assayas, who is now married to Cheung, has made another radical
departure with "Les Destinees," bringing his mastery of complex
intimate relationships to bear upon a dynastic saga spanning the
first three decades of the 20th century in an eminent Limoges
china-manufacturing family.</LD>
<TE>   It is based on a novel by Jacques Chardonne, who was inspired by
events in his mother's family, the famous Havilands, and his father's
family, who were cognac merchants; both families were Protestant. The
film stars Charles Berling as Jean Barnery, who for years resists his
destiny as the head of the family porcelain factory; Emmanuelle Beart
as his devoted second wife; and Isabelle Huppert as his unjustly
discarded first wife.</TE>
<TE>   A thin, boyish-looking man of 47, Assayas, who speaks English with
lively ease, sat down for an interview in his West Hollywood hotel
during a brief stay earlier this year. Since Assayas' late father was
a screenwriter who began as an assistant to Max Ophuls and G.W.
Pabst, Assayas grew up among film people. His mother designs fashion
accessories.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like I've wanted to make this movie forever," said
Assayas. "Writing and directing to me is the same thing. At some
point I had been making three movies in a row, all of them about my
knowledge of my generation. I just didn't want to be typecast, and
one way of opening myself up was to adapt something by a writer I've
always admired."</TE>
<TE>   It was not an easy process.</TE>
<TE>   "When finally we got the rights to the novel in 1995 I just
realized this was a huge thing. This was going to be very complicated
and swallow up a lot of my time, so I wrote the screenplay with my
friend Jacques Fieschi, who I've known for ages and is the writer for
'A Heart in Winter,' one of the better late Claude Sautet films."</TE>
<TE>   After six months of working together he and Fieschi had to stop
for a while because the film became too expensive and complicated to
make. Producer Bruno Pesery "was scared by the length of the film,
the whole thing was just too complicated," Assayas said. "But
gradually the producer who couldn't make it at the time fell in love
with the idea and felt it would be a good movie."</TE>
<TE>   In their quest for authenticity, Assayas and Fieschi studied
materials Chardonne used himself. They visited "Limoges and Charente,
all those southwest of France areas, and we met people who were part
of the family of Jacques Chardonne."</TE>
<TE>   That Chardonne "was inspired by real-life people ... was the most
exciting part of it," Assayas said. "He kind of combined a few
characters to make up some of the people. But the ... places, the
story, the whole industrial background was part of his blood."</TE>
<TE>   While having the film's central character start out as a minister
is fictional, Assayas explained, the love story between the minister
and his second wife is drawn from Chardonne's marriage. "He's
bringing in the religious element to bring some kind of cohesiveness
to the whole thing. Obviously the Protestant element is hugely
important because those people are a minority in France, but they are
industrialists and also the reason why they've been selling their
products to the Protestant world."</TE>
<TE>   As well as the language and the characters, the look of a period
film is critical, and Assayas early on started working with
production designer Katia Wyszkop.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're dealing with re-creating the past I think that to me
the issue is, How can I make the past feel like the present? How can
I re-create this thing so that we don't look down on these people and
we don't look at the people who have values so far from our own and
somehow function. You have to find the path to create the obviousness
of how this sort of world and society functions, and you can only do
it by being so incredibly precise and really careful with every
single detail and never try to superimpose ... mentalities of today.</TE>
<TE>   "To me it was so important to be incredibly accurate in
re-creating a book that was based on documented information. We used
so many pictures of the Haviland factory," Assayas said. "They gave
us so many pictures for documentation, we were very lucky in that
sense, and the factory scenes are, let me see, 1910 or 1913, the year
that the Havilands had every single workshop photographed."</TE>
<TE>   From the time Assayas started preparing the film in 1996 he knew
he wanted to do it with Beart and Huppert, but it took him a while to
come up with Berling as the actor he wanted to play Jean Barnery. He
wanted to make a film infused with the ideas of Impressionism and
felt Beart could have been a Renoir or Corot model.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows about Impressionism, this national treasure,"
said Assayas, "but everybody has forgotten what it means. It's about
being able to look in a very simple way at the beauty of the
world--nature, the colors, the people and simple emotions--in a very
straightforward way, and it's really something so deep and beautiful.
People have sort of lost the depth of the meaning, and I wanted to
make a movie that goes back to the values of Impressionism, to the
beauty of it.</TE>
<TE>   "Isabelle was the only actress in France who can do her part,"
said Assayas. "This is the kind of character she loves, and so she
and Emmanuelle were very supportive of the project. Charles Berling
came later. He really came when, two years later, out of the blue the
producer said, 'Now I have the money.' That was 1998, and we shot the
film summer of '99. But I think what also gave me the drive to
totally imagine the film or find a new path into the film was meeting
Charles Berling, because Charles Berling had the kind of capacity of
transforming himself. I thought he was a believable minister, an
industrialist, believable as a young man. He has this stage actor's
ability to transform himself. In making this film every frame was a
total pleasure. You really did have a sense of life, doing it. You
saw a whole life unfolding and so on and these people going through
all these changes. You really felt that they had a real marriage.
It's really my version of 'Scenes From a Marriage,' complicated to
make but with a lightness of touch."</TE>
<TE>   A three-hour movie may hardly seem a light touch, but Assayas begs
our indulgence.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the way Chardonne writes: The emotions he's describing are
just sometimes tiny, but deep, and you have to catch them, and if you
just underline them too much all of a sudden they escape. That's
where the ... Impressionist influence was essential. It's really what
gave me the overview of the film that made me understand that I had
to find the same lightness of touch, the same ability to catch things
in a very spontaneous way that I've always connected to Impressionist
painting. To me, once the sets were there, once the extras were
there, once the costumes were there, the only thing that mattered was
the landscapes, the color, the sun, the feeling of winter, the
summer. That's really what this movie is about."</TE>
<TE>   Even though the movie proved a commercial disappointment in
France, where it was reasonable to expect that audiences would be
most receptive, Assayas remains philosophically optimistic. "Ever
since I started making movies it has been about exploring the world.
They have been a way of expanding my interests and of understanding
things I had no access to in my world. And every single movie I have
made, to me, has been a way of trying to expand my vision."</TE>
<TE>   For his next film, "Demonlover," that vision fast-forwarded to
what has been described as a "cyber thriller." Whether it will fare
better commercially than "Les Destinees" is hard to guess, but the
selection committee liked it well enough to include it among the
competition at the Cannes Film Festival, which got underway Wednesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   He felt privileged to make "Les Destinees," he said, "because it
is an occasion to explore the past, and when you spend so much time
studying the way people worked, lived, fought at that time, you have
this new layer of understanding of today's world.</TE>
<TE>   "And making movies in that sense is very much a privilege. I mean,
every single day when we were making this film I would walk into
those sets that had all been re-created so precisely. I just felt
like I was walking into another world, another time, and I just thank
the reality of that world. The ghosts were there."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>MARIN COUNTY</DL>
<LD>George Lucas didn't have to travel far to talk to the media about
"Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones." The filmmaker opened
the gates of his Skywalker Ranch here to journalists last week, where
he spoke candidly about a number of issues relating to this latest
chapter in his "Star Wars" saga which opened nationwide Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   On the disappointing response to "The Phantom Menace": I knew when
I made the film that a lot of fans weren't going to like it, because
I wasn't making the movie they wanted me to make. [Nevertheless,]
"Phantom Menace" became the most successful "Star Wars" film of all
time. But [fans] wanted this to start in Episode II. They wanted to
see Jedis fighting, they wanted to see battles, they wanted to see
"The Matrix."</LD>
<LD>   But I had to start in the beginning and do all the groundwork,
which means you have to lay all the pipe for the characters and for
the world that you're creating.</LD>
<TE>   On the grim nature of the new episodes: I'm basically [going]
against the marketing wishes of what you would normally do in a film
like this. But I've got to tell the story, and I knew when I started
that this was going to end badly. I see this as one movie in six
parts, and if you see it from the very beginning to the very end, the
father is redeemed by the children, and it all works out. You just
have to accept the fact that the middle is pretty grim.</TE>
<TE>   On building a better Yoda: We had created digital dinosaurs [for
"Jurassic Park"] and made them look real in a real environment, and
we also accomplished that [in "Phantom Menace"]. But creating a
digital character from scratch and having it fit in is one
thing--having to replicate an existing character and make it look
real and like that existing character that people knew was a huge
challenge. We tried to do it for "Phantom Menace," but we were going
too far too fast. It didn't work, so I went to the puppet again.</TE>
<TE>   We have a couple of wide shots with the digital character running
around, but I couldn't really do a digital Yoda [then]. We kept that
crew working and struggling. When we started production [on "Attack
of the Clones"] I had to commit to a digital Yoda because I couldn't
get the end scenes with a puppet. It just wouldn't work with throwing
a puppet around. So we put extra energy into it, and about nine
months after we finished shooting we saw the first Yoda, and it was a
great thing.</TE>
<TE>   On the decision to make the second trilogy: When I got to the end
[of the first trilogy] and everyone said, "Are you going to do more?"
my feeling was, probably not, because I couldn't tell the back story.
And that was the only other thing I had written. At that point I
really wanted to go off and raise my family and do a lot of other
things. [Later] I was thinking--my kids are old enough, the companies
are all established, I'm independent, I can do any kind of movies I
want to do.</TE>
<TE>   And I thought, do I finish "Star Wars"? I love the story of how
Anakin became Darth Vader, and obviously I like the world, and I also
liked the idea of working in a medium where I wasn't constantly
banging up against the technology all the time. This was after
"Jurassic Park," and we now had the technology, if I did it
digitally. The idea of being free to let my imagination loose in this
world I'd created was exciting to me.</TE>
<TE>   On his role in creating the blockbuster approach to filmmaking:
This whole notion that somehow "Star Wars" or even Steve's
[Spielberg] films invented the blockbuster is a complete
misconception. If you were to go back in the history of cinema, you
will discover that blockbusters existed right from "Birth of a
Nation" and "Intolerance." The biggest blockbuster of all time was
"Gone With the Wind." If you go to what we might call the modern age,
it really started with "The Godfather," [which] was the first film to
actually break out and be a giant hit. And "Jaws" was the first film
that opened in multi-screens all at once. I opened ["Star Wars"] in
35 theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Blockbusters existed at Christmastime, and they existed at the 4th
of July. What I did was, I moved that day to May. I was told that you
can't release a film in May, because kids are still in
school--especially when it's a kid's film. And I said that I want
them to be in school, because I want them to talk about the movie,
and if they're all together, they'll talk about it. Then people
started releasing their films in May, and they realized they could
actually have hits all summer.</TE>
<TE>   In defense of digital: I think ["Attack of the Clones"] is the
movie that will stop a lot of the rumors and gossip that it's
terrible, it doesn't work, you can't use it. We've been struggling to
get the theaters to go for digital. They've locked arms and said, "We
aren't going to do it." And the studios have done the same thing.
They're both basically stalling, and the reason is, they're figuring
out, "How can we control this thing? How can we make the money on
it?" But you don't make money at this. That's the whole point.
Sometimes you have to put aside your greed and decide [that] it's
actually a better presentation for the audience.</TE>
<TE>   On when the first trilogy will come out on DVD: It'll probably be
after I finish the next film, because that takes a lot of work and
there's not as much material to work with. I want to get these done
[first]. You can't just put the film out; a DVD is now a whole
different world.</TE>

<HD>Give Them a Hand, Then Play a Hand?</HD>
<DH>Trends* At local concert arenas, a Vegas promoter is
betting that 'for-fun' gambling tables will lure visitors to the
desert city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You don't need to wait for the Rolling Stones tour this fall to hear
tumbling dice at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Craps, blackjack and roulette tables are now fixtures in the lobby
of Staples and four other major Southern California concert venues
and, while no cash changes hands, the gaming sites are all about big
money. They are the result of a multimillion-dollar promotional deal
by Vegas.com to remind music fans that the desert city is a short
trip away.</LD>
<LD>   The tables will be set up at most shows at Staples, Universal
Amphitheatre, Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre, Glen Helen Blockbuster
Pavilion and also at Coors Amphitheatre in San Diego. The tables are
also in play at sporting events in the venues, including Los Angeles
Laker and King games.</LD>
<TE>   The "for-fun" gambling tables made their concert debut with the
Alanis Morissette shows on May 3-4 at Universal Amphitheatre and drew
curious stares and plenty of players at Paul McCartney's high-profile
visit to Staples on May 4.</TE>
<TE>   The tables will be spreading to venues in other states late this
summer, said Howard Lefkowitz, president of Vegas.com, which is a
travel and entertainment guide to Las Vegas and is part of Greenspun
Media Group. Vegas.com wants to become the online hub for tourists
heading to the Nevada city and plans to pay millions more to concert
industry powers for the opportunity to woo their audiences with Las
Vegas imagery.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California was a logical opening bet for Vegas.com.
Surveys show that one in four visitors to Las Vegas hails from the
Los Angeles area. "It's a natural," Lefkowitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is thrilled, including Tom Tucker, the executive
director of the California Council on Problem Gambling, a Palm
Springs-based nonprofit group.</TE>
<TE>   "The first image comes to my mind is a crack dealer giving out
drugs for free to school kids hoping they'll get hooked," Tucker
said. "We're not anti-gambling, but the more people that get exposed,
the more it gets to people who have a problem. For most people it's
fun but we also have 2 million people in California who are problem
gamblers. For them, things like this just get the juices flowing."</TE>
<TE>   But Lefkowitz presents the promotion as no more sinister than a
poker game at a friend's house. He said players must verify they are
21 or older and tables will be closed at shows aimed at children,
such as "Sesame Street" musicals. They will, however, be open for
teen-skewing acts, such as 'N Sync or Britney Spears, where they
might serve what Lefkowitz suggests is a somewhat captive audience.</TE>
<TE>   "As a parent who has been to a lot of those shows, believe me, I
would to have love to have been outside catching some cards,"
Lefkowitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the tables do not operate when performers are on stage.
They also are sites for promoting the Web site and its special
offers, which include giveaways and live entertainment access locally
and in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   The promotion has caused some fans to think they're already in the

<HD>CLOSING THE FILES</HD>
<DH>As 'The X-Files' ends its run, its place in TV lore secure,
one question remains: Will the truth out there be revealed?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The end of Fox's moody and atmospheric "The X-Files" is only days
away, marked by the return of David Duchovny as FBI Agent Fox Mulder
and anticipation among die-hard fans that the answers to several dark
mysteries will finally be revealed.</LD>
<LD>   But even as series creator Chris Carter puts the final touches on
the two-hour climax, which airs Sunday, his soft-spoken but intense
demeanor is much the same as it has been during the show's
nine-season tenure.</LD>
<LD>   "Yes, I feel like something is gone, but every day I wake up with
the nagging feeling that it's still there," Carter said last week at
his production office on the 20th Century Fox lot. "I'm a
forward-looking creature....I have a willful inability to stop and
celebrate something, or to mourn."</LD>
<TE>   For now, he is leaving it to others to pay tribute to his show as
a phenomenon that not only helped establish Fox as a contending
network, but also brought new life to the genre of dark and edgy
dramas on prime-time television.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the icons of the 1990s, very emblematic of that era,"
said Tim Brooks, coauthor of "The Complete Directory to Prime Time
Network and Cable TV Shows." "It brought to the comedy-laden
'Seinfeld'-era a much more serious attitude, a questioning of
institutions. 'The X-Files' is also one of the great science-fiction
series in television history. And one of the most complicated
programs ever."</TE>
<TE>   The series, which revolved around the adventures of two FBI agents
investigating the paranormal, supernatural and unexplainable, made
stars of its leads, Duchovny and Gillian Anderson. The two exhibited
a palpable chemistry even though their characters' relationship was
mainly platonic. While the series was steeped in stories of alien
abduction, grotesque monsters and government conspiracies, it also
handled its tales with a humanity and humor that attracted a huge
cross-section of viewers, particularly women.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Farrelly, an English professor at the University of Dayton,
Ohio, calls "The X-Files" "the consummate thinking-person's show.
Like all great art, it is subversive in nature and challenges our
values and belief systems by exposing the underbelly of human
institutions and the hubris that fuels them."</TE>
<TE>   Paul A. Cantor, a University of Virginia English professor, said
that the end of the series reflects a change in the mood of the
country, which has less cynicism about the government after Sept. 11
than it did during the drama's heyday.</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Grushow, chairman of Fox TV Entertainment Group, who was
president of Fox when the show was launched in 1993, said the
conclusion is "very bittersweet. This is one of the shows that put
Fox on the map. It helped define the network and proved we could play
with the Big Three."</TE>
<TE>   Declining ratings for "The X-Files," which started when Duchovny
reduced his role two seasons ago, led Carter to decide in January to
end the series.</TE>
<TE>   But for several years, the show was a huge hit, and it propelled
Carter into the elite club of A-list television producers with dream
deals, even though his subsequent shows for the
network--"Millennium," "Harsh Realm" and the "X-Files" spinoff "Lone
Gunmen"--failed to become hits.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris is an extremely smart, talented and competitive guy," said
"X-Files" executive producer Frank Spotnitz, who has worked with
Carter for eight of the show's nine seasons. "He drove everyone....He
was able to marshal really talented people and put them on the
single-minded mission of what the show was. He is really heroic. The
legacy belongs to him."</TE>
<TE>   Carter is uncertain about his next project. He plans to take some
time off, a luxury he rarely allowed himself during the last decade.
He has a deal with Bantam Books to write two novels. He also has a
deal with Miramax for a movie. "I haven't really allowed myself the
indulgence of considering life after 'The X-Files,'" he said. "I
still have tremendous energy and a tremendous amount of ideas."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he knows that "The X-Files" will live on in
various forms. "There's still so much work to be done. There's still
a lot of business surrounding the show that will make it seem like
it's not gone," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth season has just been released on DVD, joining DVDs of
the previous seasons, and Carter will soon begin doing commentary
tracks for the sixth-season edition. He is also overseeing a new line
of merchandise being launched by Fox that will include action
figures, trading cards, "The X-Files" magazine and a yearbook.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the long-planned sequel to the 1998 "X-Files" movie.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point I can't imagine the movie being filmed before
summer 2003, and I can't imagine it being seen before summer 2004,
not to say that it would be a summer release," Carter said.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's finale, written by Carter, takes place during a military
tribunal in which Mulder is on trial for murder. The FBI agent is
trying to justify the investigation of the X-Files--the term refers
to cases that fall outside the FBI mainstream--and to prove the
existence of extraterrestrials.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the show's longtime fans will get closure on the
dangling mysteries, such as the alien abduction of Mulder's sister
and the agenda behind the government conspiracies, Carter smiled,
conceding that they probably would not. "We're trying, and hopefully
succeeding, in making it all make sense, giving it a logic and coming
full circle," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fans eager for Mulder and Scully to ride off into the sunset
together "will be satisfied, though not absolutely satisfied. The
people who want there to be closure on the mystery of Mulder's
sister, and the child that Mulder and Scully share, I think, will be
satisfied. Those who have wondered about the conspiracies will be
satisfied."</TE>
<TE>   Added Spotnitz: "People who have followed the show already know
most of the answers. But for the normal viewer, they will be able to
put together the pieces of the puzzle."</TE>
<TE>   "The X-Files" has also had its share of backstage drama over the
years. The show was filmed in Vancouver, Canada, for its first five
years, before making a costly move to Los Angeles in 1998, where it
now ranks among the most expensive series on network television, at
around $3 million an episode.</TE>
<TE>   The following year, Duchovny filed a lawsuit against 20th Century
Fox, the studio that produces "The X-Files," alleging breach of
contract in his profit participation because Fox gave its broadcast
stations and FX cable channel sweetheart deals for reruns of the
series rather than seeking the highest bid.</TE>
<TE>   That suit was eventually settled (terms were not disclosed), but
the actor reduced his appearances last season to a little more than
half the episodes. He exited entirely this season, except for
appearing in the finale and directing an episode.</TE>
<TE>   A bit of industry drama will also surround the end of "The
X-Files." The episode is airing during perhaps the most competitive
night in the May rating sweeps, facing off against the three-hour
conclusion of CBS' "Survivor: Marquesas," NBC's "The Cosby Show"
retrospective and the season finale of ABC's "The Practice."</TE>
<TE>   Carter shrugged. "There's really nothing I can do about it."</TE>
<TE>   After the last episode airs, Carter said he will be able to put
"The X-Files" more into perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole experience has been like a dream," he said. "What I
did was hire a lot of the right people early in their careers. My
success is based on the good work of those people, perhaps the best
work they've ever done."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The finale of "The X-Files" will be shown at 8 p.m. Sunday on Fox.
The network has rated it TV-PG-LV (may be unsuitable for young
children, with advisories for coarse language and violence).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The X-Files" moves to Los Angeles in 1998 after spending its
first five seasons filming in Vancouver. One of the first episodes in
the new era is filmed aboard the Queen Mary and directed by Chris
Carter in continuous takes with no cutaways, just like Alfred
Hitchcock in the classic film "Rope."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In November 1999, Mulder and Scully, who have never let their
personal chemistry get in the way, kiss for the first time in a New
Year's Eve-themed episode.</TE>

<HD>A Maverick Goes Against the Tide Again</HD>
<DH>In an era when airwaves follow the money, Saul Levine keeps
KMZT-FM's format. The station owner is being honored by the L.A.
Philharmonic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saul Levine is willing to try just about anything--except retirement.</LD>
<LD>   The 70-year-old station owner has brought Southern California the
all-traffic format and the all-Beatles format. He tried to challenge
the news-radio duopoly of KNX and KFWB. He ran the nation's only
commercial jazz station, until March, when he changed it to
contemporary standards--bringing Sinatra and Tony Bennett back to the
Southland airwaves and adding modern vocalists such as Harry Connick
Jr. and Diana Krall. And for 44 years he's owned what is now one of
the country's few commercial classical stations, "K-Mozart," KMZT-FM
(105.1).</LD>
<LD>   "I've had the luxury of experimenting with formats, which the big
corporations don't do," said Levine, a rare independent operator in
an age of consolidation and chain ownership.</LD>
<TE>   "I love all music--you name it, I enjoy it," Levine said, but "I
have a special affinity for classical, and the community needs it.
There's just such a great need for culture on the dial."</TE>
<TE>   To Deborah Borda, managing director of the Los Angeles
Philharmonic, simply keeping the station as an outlet for Mozart,
Strauss, Beethoven and Vivaldi is a gift to Los Angeles, when Levine
could easily reap millions by selling to a company that would change
to more mainstream programming.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, and for the support he gives the orchestra in
free advertising, broadcast time and other ways, the Philharmonic
will honor Levine on Wednesday with its first Distinguished Service
Award.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an original. He's one-of-a-kind," Borda said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some think I'm eccentric when I could be living on the beach
somewhere," Levine said. "From the time I was 10 years old, I've had
the inclination to own a radio station."</TE>
<TE>   After World War II, AM stations gobbled up the newly available FM
frequencies, but surrendered them when they saw no potential for the
band--in spite of its long range and lack of static. But Levine did,
buying the 105.1 frequency in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   "I was able to get a channel just by filing for it. I did all the
work myself," said Levine, who had recently received his law degree
from UCLA. "Today I couldn't afford to go out and acquire the
station. All it took was about $25 in paperwork."</TE>
<TE>   FM, of course, succeeded, and took almost all music on the radio
with it, leaving AM with sports and talk. But Levine again sees
potential--for a return of music to AM.</TE>
<TE>   After tinkering with various formats on his station at 1260 on the
AM dial, Levine made it KJAZ in March 2000, playing all jazz. But
with negligible audiences and little support from record labels and
local promoters, he changed the format again this year, snuffing what
the trade press said was the only commercial jazz station left in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   With Clear Channel Communications switching KLAC-AM (570) from
adult standards to talk in August, Levine saw an opportunity. In
March, KJAZ became KSUR, "K-Surf," what he hopes will be a fresh,
laid-back, Southern Californian approach to adult standards. No more
"How Much Is That Doggie in the Window?" or "Mule Train."</TE>
<TE>   "There are these songs that are so tired--I hate to say this--that
they could make one nauseous hearing them over and over again," he
said. K-Surf, on the other hand, will feature Nat King Cole, Johnny
Mathis and Barbra Streisand. "It has kind of a hip sound to it, and
doesn't have that stigma of 'my grandmother's music.'"</TE>
<TE>   He hopes that older listeners will enjoy the familiar music, while
younger ones, just getting hip to Tony Bennett and others of the
genre, will appreciate the style and presentation of the singers and
the station. And his confidence is exhibited by the $500,000 he spent
to quadruple the station's power output last month, from 5,000 to
20,000 watts.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about a previous interview, in which Levine--who also
owns a station in San Francisco and one in San Diego--was quoted as
saying he was interested in making only "a modest profit," he
laughed. "Our profits are extremely modest," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It took 20 years for KMZT to get in the black--a decade longer
than Levine promised his skeptical mother. With the 100-mile reach of
his facility atop Mt. Wilson, Levine said he could be billing
advertisers $40 million a year if he were playing a mass-appeal
format. Last year KMZT billed $4 million.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be, 20 years ago, a classical station would get a
premium because of the audience," Levine said. Now, advertisers don't
seem to care about KMZT's demographic of PhDs with $75,000 salaries,
and are obsessed with youth and ratings. Even so, in the latest
ratings period, KMZT beat out the area's two classic-rock stations,
KCBS and KLOS, as well as KZLA, the country station that claims to
have the nation's biggest audience for that format.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what happens, when people reach 40, people look for
something more substantial, and they're not being served," Levine
said.</TE>
<TE>   His property became especially valuable after the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, which changed the FCC rules about how
many radio stations one company could own overall, and in a single
market. As soon as companies could acquire more stations, they wanted
to, and the frequencies became hot commodities.</TE>
<TE>   "Since the deregulation happened, there's been a lot of buying and
selling of stations. A veritable frenzy," said Brenda Barnes,
president and general manager of L.A.'s other classical music
station, the non-commercial KUSC-FM (91.5). "The price of radio
stations went through the roof. If you're going to buy a station for
$150 million or $200 million in a major market, it's pretty difficult
to meet the debt load and run it as a classical station."</TE>
<TE>   So commercial classical station WQXR-FM in New York is owned by
the New York Times Co., KING-FM in Seattle runs on a foundation
endowment, WFMT-FM in Chicago is operated commercially by the city's
public television station, and WGMS-FM in Washington, D.C., belongs
to Bonneville International Corp., which owns two other stations in
the city. Few individuals are devoted enough to classical music to
eschew the advertising revenue that a Top 40 format could generate,
or bypass the payoff from a conglomerate looking to expand.</TE>
<TE>   Levine said the broadcast chains have gotten the message that he
has no plans to sell, and have almost quit asking. But one executive
calls faithfully every six months to see if he's changed his mind.
Levine always consults with his wife of 30 years, Anita, and always
declines.</TE>
<TE>   "A hundred million dollars is a lot of money," Barnes said.
"Obviously I'm never going to be in that situation, but I think it
would be hard to say no to.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not running the station because he's looking to make as much
money as he possibly can," she said. "I truly admire Saul Levine for
his commitment to classical music. I don't know many people who would
make the decisions he's made."</TE>
<TE>   Levine said it's simply a matter of doing what he loves best. His
two children are grown--Stephanie, 25, is a law student at Loyola
Marymount, while Michael, 22, is a liaison in Gov. Gray Davis'
office--and he has few hobbies, apart from a love of raising Golden
Retrievers. Even when a head cold keeps him from going to work, he
finds energy to take 2-year-old Archie on a drive around town.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no plans to retire, and my father worked until the day he
died, and he was 85," Levine said. "I'm a broadcaster; it was a dream
I had as a child. I enjoy going to work every day, I enjoy serving
the public, and some things are worth more than money."</TE>

<LD>Most painters work in series, making adjustments that build from one
canvas to the next until some kind of resolution is reached. A
consistent body of work usually results.</LD>
<LD>   Louise Fishman does not work this way, which is especially rare
for an abstract painter. The 63-year-old New Yorker approaches each
painting as if it were an entirely new experience. She succeeds in
creating loosely gestural works that stand apart from those that
immediately precede them and those that follow.</LD>
<LD>   While the radically individuated nature of Fishman's oeuvre
doubtlessly keeps her on her toes, it will confuse viewers who think
art must follow a logical progression to get anywhere. At Manny
Silverman Gallery, Fishman's first solo show in Los Angeles goes a
long way to put these reservations to rest. Her 10 oils on linen take
you places, but not in any sort of step-by-step sequence.</LD>
<TE>   Fishman, an intuitive painter who isn't afraid to push paint
around until something gels, leaves a lot of evidence of the labor
that goes into each piece. "The Sunrise Ruby" looks as if it had been
scraped and scratched together out of nothing but dirt, dust and
sweat. "Troubles Overcome Are Good to Tell" appears to be conjured
from the morning mists that rise off a mountain lake. And "Casa
Cenote," which seems to move as you scan its active surface, has the
presence of two or three translucent paintings superimposed atop one
another.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the density of visual incidents Fishman compresses into
each painting, none feels tortured, crowded or fussed over. Generous
to the core, they redeem the labor of their making by giving physical
form to spaces that exist only in your imagination.</TE>
<TE>   Manny Silverman Gallery, 619 N. Almont Drive, West Hollywood.

<HD>With O'Reilly Joining Peers on Radio, Liberals Are Being
Left Out of the Mix</HD>
<DH>Media* Some say it's just marketing, but others claim that
conservative and independent messages simply translate better to the
airwaves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL FARHI</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rush and G. Gordon. Ollie and McLaughlin. Sean Hannity and Alan
Keyes. Armstrong Williams and Pat Robertson. Michael Medved, Michael
Reagan, Michael Savage, Michael Graham, Laura Ingraham.</LD>
<LD>   Sensing a pattern here? The biggest names in political-talk
radio--and increasingly, political-talk TV--tend to run the
ideological gamut from conservative to ... very conservative.
Liberals and moderates, it seems, can't or don't attract much of a
crowd.</LD>
<LD>   As Bill Clinton ponders whether to launch his own talk show on
NBC, broadcasters who've made their careers lambasting him continue
to gobble up more of the airwaves. Last week, for example, Bill
O'Reilly, host of cable's most popular talk show, Fox News Channel's
"The O'Reilly Factor," started his own two-hour radio program on 205
stations--the biggest debut ever, said his syndicator, Westwood One.</LD>
<TE>   Conservatives and "independents"--O'Reilly's preferred
descriptive--have grown so numerous on the airwaves that they can't
help bumping into one another. In Los Angeles and most other cities,
O'Reilly's show is airing opposite the king of the right wing, Rush
Limbaugh, who revived AM radio a decade ago with screeds about
"feminazis" and "environmental wackos."</TE>
<TE>   So, conservatives we got. "Independents" we got. But where have
all the liberals gone?</TE>
<TE>   The few proudly progressive hosts who've ever gotten their own
national gig generally haven't lasted long. The ranks of the fallen
include Jesse Jackson, whose CNN show evaporated after his
child-out-of-wedlock scandal. Texas populist Jim Hightower came and
went on radio, as did former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. Phil Donahue,
the anti-Limbaugh, may be a key exception; he will knock heads with
O'Reilly's Fox show when he returns to talk-TV this summer on MSNBC.</TE>
<TE>   A few liberals and centrists--Michael Kinsley, Paul Begala, James
Carville--appear regularly on TV. But they tend to be "canceled out"
by a conservative in a "Crossfire"-style format, says Steve Rendall,
a senior analyst at Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, a
self-described progressive media watchdog group.</TE>
<TE>   'The World Wrestling</TE>
<TE>   Federation With Ideas'</TE>
<TE>   By and large, there's nothing like being Right. O'Reilly thinks
those left of center can't get the job done on the air. That's not a
knock on their ideology, he says, but a comment on the liberal
tendency toward inclusiveness and reflectiveness--both deadly
qualities in a medium that talk-show producer Randall Bloomquist
describes as "the World Wrestling Federation with ideas."</TE>
<TE>   "Conservative people tend to see the world in black-and-white
terms, good and evil," O'Reilly says in an interview. "Liberals see
grays. In any talk format, you have to pound home a strong point of
view. If you're not providing controversy and excitement, people
won't listen, or watch."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, National Public Radio "is all left, top to bottom. That's
where the left goes," he adds. "They listen to Diane Rehm."</TE>
<TE>   Rehm, host of an NPR-distributed show out of Washington, replies:
"If a liberal is a talk radio host who represents more than just one
view, then I am indeed a liberal.... I've never felt there's just one
way and one way only. [Some hosts] espouse one view over and over
again, whereas our message is far more confusing because we're open
to ideas and let you make up your own mind."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks largely to Limbaugh--and to Clinton, who provided plenty of
raw material--the past decade has seen a veritable renaissance for
conservative talk.</TE>
<TE>   After only six months in syndication, Fox News' Hannity is on more
than 150 radio stations. Ingraham's year-old show is heard in almost
200 markets, as is Savage, a man so conservative he was dubbed
"Attila the Tongue" by a radio-industry magazine. Medved counts 130
affiliates for his show.</TE>
<TE>   Liberals often suggest that this type of programming reflects the
conservative politics of the corporations that own the media.
Conservatives counter that their kind of talk offsets the news
media's alleged leftward bias.</TE>
<TE>   The proliferation of conservative talk may, however, be as much
about marketing as politics. The audience for broadcast news tends to
be older (the average viewer of all-news cable TV is about 55). As a
rule, older people tend to be conservative. Ergo, a market niche.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the rise of the right on radio and TV may be a
self-fulfilling prophecy, argues Todd Gitlin, a New York University
professor of sociology and journalism and author of "Media
Unlimited," which explores the media's impact on culture.</TE>
<TE>   Since the media are imitative, the success of one conservative
program tends to lead to another, he says. "You don't suffer [as a
programming executive] by imitating what's successful," Gitlin says.
"But you are punished for trying something new and [then] failing."</TE>
<TE>   During the 1980s, the conservative audience wasn't being well
served, says Michael Harrison, publisher of Talkers magazine, which
tracks the talk-media field. That left the field open for Limbaugh,
whose success eventually led to Liddy, Ollie North and others. Now,
Harrison surmises, "we're getting dangerously close to saturation."</TE>
<TE>   There's also a growing Outrage Gap: With a Republican president in
office, a Republican-controlled House and a majority of governorships
held by Republicans, it's harder for hosts to find juicy targets. Tom
Daschle, after all, isn't quite the pinata that Clinton once was
(there's still Clinton, of course).</TE>
<TE>   Says Harrison: "Talk radio works best when it's looking from the
outside in, when it's looking out for the disenfranchised and taking
on the establishment and conventional wisdom."</TE>
<TE>   But how do you take on the establishment when you are the
establishment? The drought has gotten so bad that the talk industry
is starting to manufacture its own outrage. A few months ago, Talkers
magazine created a character called the Lone Liberal, an actual
flesh-and-blood guy whose job is to do battle with the legions of
conservative hosts.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison reports that the Lone Liberal is averaging about eight to
nine talk-show bookings a week. "He's hot as a firecracker," he says
of the character, who wears a mask when he appears on radio or TV.</TE>
<TE>   What was that about talk shows being like the WWF?</TE>

<HD>L.A.-Bound Piano Spheres Delivers a Thoughtful Church
Finale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Vicki Ray's thoughtfully organized, Buddhist-inspired,
season-closing program Tuesday night, Piano Spheres turned a corner,
for this was the innovative series' last concert in Pasadena's
Neighborhood Church.</LD>
<LD>   After eight seasons there, Piano Spheres joins the stampede to
downtown L.A.'s Zipper Hall in 2002-2003, trading the sylvan,
off-the-beaten-path ambience of the church for better acoustics,
vastly improved sightlines and, most likely, a higher profile.</LD>
<LD>   Titled "Meditations," Ray's program opened with five pieces that
formed an uninterrupted suite, bookended by a pair of John Cage
prepared-piano miniatures, "Prelude for Meditation" and "And the
Earth Shall Bear Again." Sandwiched within were Bill Douglas' rolling
caldron of Asian and impressionistic influences, "Vajra"; Janice
Giteck's "Tara's Love Will Melt the Sword"--which veered dangerously
toward tranquilizing New Age platitudes before rousing itself with a
dash of Philip Glass--and Frederic Rzewski's hypnotic dialogue
between rapidly repeated notes and decaying chords, "The Turtle and
the Crane." Later on, Sean Heim's "In the Between" found Ray using
prepared-piano and bowed-string effects, producing deep, growling,
highly absorbing bass resonances.</LD>
<TE>   All of this led up to the most audacious piece on the program,
Bill Alves' "Skala-Niskala," a bright, vibrant, microtonal concerto
for piano and gamelan ensemble. Not only did this fusion of cultures
produce an easily assimilated, even melodious work, the gleaming,
pinging sounds of the gamelan echoed those of Cage's prepared piano
earlier, thus unifying both ends of the evening.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than mess with the tunings of the Steinways at hand, Ray
played on a detuned MIDI controller keyboard, which seemed muffled in
contrast to the colorful gamelan ensemble staffed from the ranks of
CalArts and Pomona College. And the Zipper is beginning to look like
a godsend already, since the gamelan players were partially obscured
by a podium.</TE>

<HD>UPN's New Lineup Has Its Eye on Young Viewers</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Emphasizing its commitment to targeting young audiences, UPN on
Thursday unveiled a new logo, a new image campaign and its first new
prime-time schedule since being taken over earlier this year by
Viacom-owned CBS.</LD>
<LD>   CBS President Leslie Moonves said UPN will target the
18-to-34-year-old viewing audience and will be a complement to CBS.
Three of the four new series UPN unveiled are produced by CBS
Productions.</LD>
<LD>   "This network has had a great year of growth and is ready to turn
it up," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Returning to UPN's five-night schedule in the fall will be the
hits "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," "Enterprise" and the "Smackdown"
wrestling franchise. The veteran comedy "The Hughleys" was canceled,
while "Roswell" and "Special Unit 2" already had been taken off the
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   The new comedies include "Half and Half," a series about two
African American half-sisters who grew up separately but now live in
the same building. It stars Rachel True and Essence Atkins and will
air Mondays at 9:30 p.m., joining the network's other black-themed
comedies: "The Parkers," "One on One" and "Girlfriends."</TE>
<TE>   Scheduled for midseason is "Abby," starring Sydney Tamiia Poitier
as a TV producer who continues to live with her self-absorbed
ex-boyfriend.</TE>
<TE>   The new dramas for fall are an updated version of "The Twilight
Zone," with host Forest Whitaker, and "Haunted," about a private
investigator who is able to communicate with the dead. "The Twilight
Zone" will air Wednesdays at 9 p.m. following "Enterprise," while
"Haunted" will air Tuesdays at 9 p.m. following "Buffy."</TE>
<TE>   "The Twilight Zone," from Trilogy Entertainment Group and New Line
Television, is the only new UPN series not produced by CBS
Productions.</TE>
<TE>   Here is UPN's fall schedule (new shows in italic):</TE>
<TE>   Monday: "The Parkers," "One on One," "Girlfriends," "Half and
Half."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," "Haunted."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: "Enterprise," "The Twilight Zone."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: "WWE Smackdown!"</TE>

<HD>Arts Council Budget in Jeopardy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Among the cuts proposed in Gov. Gray Davis' revised May budget is a
reduction of more than $16 million for the California Arts Council,
slashing the council's $31-million budget for support of arts
organizations, programs and arts education to $14.5 million for
fiscal year 2002-2003.</LD>
<LD>   If the cut is made final, funding for the agency, which has
enjoyed increases throughout Davis' administration, would drop almost
to the $14-million level where it hovered from 1992 to 1998 under
Gov. Pete Wilson.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters of the state arts agency have until July 1--the start
of the next fiscal year--to plead their case for reducing the cut,
which could result in layoffs of about half of the council's
42-member staff as well as the elimination of numerous programs,
including performing arts touring and presenting, artists in
residence and artists' fellowships.</LD>
<TE>   "The severity of these cuts was unexpected. This is the ultimate
rock and a hard place," said arts council director Barry Hessenius.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of Sept. 11 and its toll on the California economy,
Gov. Davis requested that all state agencies cut 15% from their
proposed budgets for 2002-2003, but the council was encouraged that
that figure for their agency was reduced to 7.7%, or about $2
million. In his current budget, announced Tuesday, the governor
proposed to close the largest deficit in state history--nearly $24
billion--with a combination of program cuts and tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview Thursday, Steven Fogel, past arts council
chairman and a current member of the council, called the proposed
reduction "devastating."</TE>
<TE>   "The not-for-profit arts are so needy, in a sense there is so much
demanded and so little that we are able to do for them, that to take
away so much of what we have is a tragedy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   What's left in the governor's arts council budget includes $6
million for arts education (down from $10 million), $5 million for
organizational support programs (down from more than $10 million) and
$2 million for the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Acuna Deftly Fuses Latin Roots With Imagination</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Claudia Acuna's life story is so compelling that it sometimes has
obscured the much more important fact that she is a superb jazz
singer who is improving with every outing.</LD>
<LD>   That's not to minimize the extraordinary journey she has made,
leaving her native Santiago, Chile, at the age of 18, moving to New
York City on her own, working as a baby sitter and a dog walker to
keep herself going as she developed her skills. But none of that
would have mattered much if those skills hadn't been at the service
of an inventive musical imagination.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday night at the Jazz Bakery, Acuna displayed how the
skills and the imagination have come together into a performing style
that reaches comfortably from her Latin roots to the vanguard of the
contemporary jazz world.</LD>
<TE>   Much of the program was devoted to material from her highly
praised new Verve CD, "Rhythm of Life," accompanied by a sterling
ensemble consisting of pianist Jason Lindner, trombonist/flutist Avi
Leibovich, bassist John Benitez and drummer Eric McPherson. As a
bonus, Acuna did a few numbers with pianist Billy Childs, who
co-produced and wrote some of the arrangements for the album.</TE>
<TE>   Acuna's versatility dominated the set. Moving easily from
standards such as "I Fall in Love Too Easily" and "My Romance" to
Milton Nascimento's "Maria, Maria" and Violetta Parra's "Volver a los
Diecisiete," she was fully in sync with the inner workings of each of
the songs. Her ballad phrasing on the standards revealed an intimate
understanding of rhythmic flow of jazz singing. The Spanish-language
numbers emphasized her smoothly articulate expressiveness and innate
story-telling powers.</TE>
<TE>   If there was a problem with the set, it traced to Acuna's great
generosity with her accompanists, allowing them extended solos
(sometimes too extended).</TE>
<TE>   In the early stages of her career, she understandably worked hard
to establish her credentials with instrumentalists. But it now is
time for Acuna to take center stage, to find a workable balance
between her creative goals and her obvious star potential. She's
simply too fine an artist to do anything less.</TE>
<TE>   And Verve executives would be wise to recognize that they already
have one, enhanced by Acuna's value as an attractive, talented
performer with the rare capacity to reach listeners in both the jazz
and the Latin communities.</TE>
<TE>   Claudia Acuna at the Jazz Bakery, 3233 Helms Ave. Tonight through
Sunday at 8 and 9:30 p.m. $25. (310) 271- 9039.</TE>

<HD>Shakespeare's 'Dream,' With Twists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Painless Shakespeare." That's what East L.A. Classic Theatre
artistic director Tony Plana calls his company's family-oriented
productions of the Bard.</LD>
<LD>   Recent shows include a mariachi "Much Ado About Nothing," a zoot
suit "Romeo and Juliet" and an MTV-salsa-style "Twelfth Night." The
company's new romp, directed by Plana, is a boisterous "A Midsummer
Night's Dream," set in a never-was world of Aztec mythology and
Spanish conquistadors.</LD>
<LD>   Mythical bird spirits replace the fairy folk; Hippolyta is an
Aztec princess; King Theseus and his court are Spanish nobles; and
the bumbling would-be actors who perform the comical "Pyramus and
Thisbe" play-within-the-play are a friar and peasant workers.</LD>
<TE>   Shakespeare's speeches are trimmed considerably but otherwise are
changed only by a sprinkling of Spanish. They're well-spoken, too,
although at the mercy of the off-and-on boom-hiss of an obstreperous
sound system. Children get the gist, though, judging from the
laughter at the opening day's show.</TE>
<TE>   Standouts among the professional adult cast include Kevin White's
dramatic Oberon, Catherine Worth's hilariously love-struck Helena and
Michael Goodfriend as the scenery-chewing, donkey-braying Bottom.
(Most roles are double cast.)</TE>
<TE>   Designer John Iacovelli's small, versatile pyramid set is
picturesque against the canyon wall; composer Joey Arreguin enhances
the ambience with Spanish guitar and conch shell horns.</TE>
<TE>   Rita Salazar-Ashford's costumes, though, are a mixed bag. Magic is
missing in the synthetic sheen of the leotards worn by Titania, Puck
and the other bird spirits. Oberon's regal stature, however, is
complemented by his peacock cape and towering feathered
headdress--costumer Jeff Transki is credited as mask maker.</TE>
<TE>   "A Midsummer Night's Dream," John Anson Ford Amphitheatre, 2580
Cahuenga Blvd., L.A., Saturday at 10 a.m. (323) 461-3673. Weekday
shows: May 28, 30-31, June 5-6, 9:30 a.m., call (323) 981-1710.

<HD>Dave Matthews Band's Back in Comfort Zone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Matthews can pretty much do anything he wants. As perhaps the
current role model for how to build a hugely successful and enduring
pop music career, he looks to remain one of the most successful
recording and touring artists for years to come, despite the
shakiness of the pop landscape that has tripped up so many others.</LD>
<LD>   So he can, say, address his fans in baby-talk-like gibberish
between songs if he wants, which he did a couple of times Wednesday
at the sold-out Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   But apparently what the South African-born, Virginia-based
musician wants to do most of all, artistically speaking, is simply
play with his bandmates and revel in the security that brings him.</LD>
<TE>   It may not be the splashiest of career arcs, but it's fitting for
a man who carries himself with earthy humility (he's the Tom Hanks of
rock, both in manner and appearance) and whose songs often convey
muted emotions--heartbreak giving way to acceptance, celebration
often taking a back seat to calm consolation. And with violinist Boyd
Tinsley, saxophonist Leroi Moore, bassist Stefan Lessard and drummer
Carter Beauford, Matthews shows ambitions with the band's signature
tricky rhythms and tempo shifts, but seems loath to disturb the
intra-group balance and musical even-temperedness.</TE>
<TE>   That stability was in some doubt last year when the DMB suddenly
swerved from what had been a steady (read: predictable) course to
work with very hands-on producer Glen Ballard. The resulting album,
"Everyday," was a shift from the ambling shuffles for which the band
had been known, with Matthews strapping on an electric guitar for the
first time and arrangements reflecting Ballard's polished pop-rock
stamp more than the generally democratic ensemble's folksy approach.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday, though, it was clear the band is firmly back on its old
path. Several songs previewing the upcoming album, "Busted Stuff,"
most of which are actually re-workings of pre-"Everyday" material
that was scrapped in favor of the Ballard sessions, fit seamlessly
with the bulk of the DMB catalog. The "Everyday" side trip was hardly
for naught, though.</TE>
<TE>   The concert highlights were actually the songs that carried
residual--if not outright--Ballard influence. Frisky from the opening
"Too Much," Matthews and his associates (augmented by keyboardist
Butch Taylor) showed new textures with the upcoming album's title
song, which featured an Al Green-like falsetto soul scat from the
leader and an atmospheric, jazzy instrumental interlude.</TE>
<TE>   Next, "You Never Know," also from the new record, evoked both
Peter Gabriel (an increasingly frequent reference point in Matthews'
writing and singing) and R.E.M. with its art-folk-rock tones.</TE>
<TE>   And following a hearty guest appearance from Benin-born world
music star Angelique Kidjo on "Satellite," Matthews once again took
up the electric guitar for what proved the most dynamic music of the
night--another "Everyday" song, "What You Are." With Tinsley's violin
and Moore's sax teamed to build a quasi-mystical slink and intensity,
the song echoed Led Zeppelin's "Kashmir"--a vibe that returned later
with the older song "Don't Drink the Water."</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, however, these flashes made other moments of the
more than two-hour set frustrating. The band's instrumentation
remains distinctive, and the musicians are all fine players, but
there's little actual musical conversation or exploration between
them (belying the DMB's tangential association with the jam-band
scene). And the overall tone of contentedness may exude a communal
warmth, but it's a fine line between that and stagnation.</TE>
<TE>   Matthews seems to possess the abilities to be seen as an explorer,
like Gabriel. Often, though, it seems he's more interested in being
reliable, like James Taylor.</TE>

<HD>New Jersey Symphony's Loss Is Czech Philharmonic's Gain</HD>
<DH>Music* After a decade of dramatic progress, Zdenek Macal is
returning to his homeland to become chief conductor of its premier
orchestra.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHEILA HOTCHKIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEWARK, N.J.</DL>
<LD>He always tells his musicians to "Do something!" and there's hardly a
moment the maestro is not.</LD>
<LD>   Onstage he dances, scrunching his lanky frame and bounding forward
as the music crescendos. Talking with a reporter, he moves his hand
in endless circles as he recounts his time with the New Jersey
Symphony Orchestra.</LD>
<LD>   "My right hand is circling because I cannot stay still," said
Zdenek Macal, 66, who is leaving to become chief conductor of the
Czech Philharmonic. "Everything is so exciting--interview,
conducting, life."</LD>
<TE>   In a decade under Macal, the orchestra improved its reputation,
won a Grammy and moved into a new performing arts center, where he
will conduct his final concert as music director Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Principal clarinetist Karl Herman theorizes that Macal chose this
orchestra that was still proving itself because "the excitement for
him of making music is moving forward. He needs to see that forward
motion."</TE>
<TE>   Now the maestro is ready to do something new.</TE>
<TE>   Zdenek Macal (pronounced zeh-DEN-eck MAH-cahl) joined the
orchestra at a critical time in its history.</TE>
<TE>   While the orchestra had made progress under his predecessor, the
detail-oriented Hugh Wolff, it remained artistically inconsistent. It
had a new executive director and new head of the board of trustees, a
debt of several million dollars and plans to build the performing
arts center.</TE>
<TE>   From the outset, the search committee focused on Macal, then music
director of the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   He had captured attention in the mid-1960s by winning the
International Conducting Competition in France and the Dmitri
Mitropoulos Competition in New York, and had since conducted at many
of the world's top orchestras.</TE>
<TE>   "It was clear right from the beginning that he was the person we
wanted to get, although it was a big stretch for our orchestra at
that time," said Lawrence Tamburri, the orchestra's executive
director.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of living in Manhattan and working in a new hall in
Newark appealed to Macal, who became the orchestra's artistic advisor
in 1992 and its music director the next year.</TE>
<TE>   Now in its 79th season, the orchestra is financially stable and
settled in its new home, which opened in October 1997. It has more
than doubled its subscription base over the last decade, and enjoys a
heightened national reputation.</TE>
<TE>   (The Grammy was in 2001 in the "engineered album: classical"
category, for a recording of Dvorak's "New World" symphony.)</TE>
<TE>   Willa Conrad, classical music critic for the Newark Star-Ledger,
said Macal's most important contribution was helping the orchestra
create a distinctive presence.</TE>
<TE>   "He's moved it from being an orchestra you can admire to one that
really moves you, one that really communicates with you from the
stage," she said. "There's absolutely no question he's the most
significant music director this orchestra has had."</TE>
<TE>   The maestro is not happy with the practice room.</TE>
<TE>   The high-ceilinged room does not have the acoustics of his beloved
concert hall, and he offers a distracted apology to a visitor as he
paces before a rehearsal of Mahler's First Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   At precisely 10 a.m., the musicians quiet down and look to Macal,
who has settled on a stool. The music begins--and so do his
instructions.</TE>
<TE>   "Too fast! Too fast!"</TE>
<TE>   "Forget the piano, or whatever--it must cry."</TE>
<TE>   "It could be more dolce, more Mozart."</TE>
<TE>   Within seven minutes, Macal is on his feet. Within 10, he's
smiling.</TE>
<TE>   He stomps his feet, shakes his fist and closes his eyes when he
hears something he likes. When the strings play too heavily, he
demands "Watch me!" and does a mincing dance to soft laughter from
the musicians.</TE>
<TE>   Theatrics aside, he is pleased.</TE>
<TE>   "My God!" he says later. "Ten years ago, and even five years ago,
the concert didn't sound like that."</TE>
<TE>   Shoulders heaving, he releases the musicians after exactly 2 1/2
hours, telling them to return in an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Says Macal: "I never like it here, but it doesn't sound so bad."</TE>
<TE>   Days after his final performance Sunday, the Czech-born Macal will
leave for his native country, where he will spend two seasons with
the Prague Symphony before taking his place at the Czech
Philharmonic. (He will return to conduct the New Jersey Symphony six
times during the 2002-03 season as Music Director Emeritus.)</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey joins several other American orchestras that have
recently changed conductors, including the New York Philharmonic, the
Philadelphia Orchestra and the Boston Symphony Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   Tamburri said Macal may be replaced by more than one person.</TE>
<TE>   The next music director will have some advantages Macal did not a
decade ago, including the new hall and a collection of rare string
instruments from collector and philanthropist Herbert Axelrod. The
instruments, which include 17th century Stradivarius and Guarneri del
Gesu violins, can cost up to $6 million each.</TE>
<TE>   But musicians and critics also say Macal's successor will have the
responsibility of continuing what he started.</TE>
<TE>   The musicians know that New Jersey does not offer the big salaries
or long traditions of some orchestras. But Herman, the clarinetist,
said they also know Macal's orchestra plays well beyond where it
might without those advantages.</TE>
<TE>   "The results in New Jersey are greater than the sum of the parts,"
he said. "That's what a guy like Macal can do."</TE>
<TE>   Says Macal: "I cannot offer them more money like Chicago or some
of the other places you could name, but the spirit on the stage is
something special.... The spirit on the stage--I can compete with
everybody."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't count on getting smart about history by watching television.</LD>
<LD>   Oh, cable's A&amp;E Network has its signature "Biography" series. Its
sister enterprise, the History Channel, speaks unevenly for itself.
And PBS has always had a thing for yellowed photos packed away in
dusty attics.</LD>
<LD>   HBO is now the small screen's most captivating window to the past,
though. Witness its recent account of Winston Churchill in "The
Gathering Storm" and its latest supreme effort dramatizing our 36th
president's Vietnam debacle in "Path to War."</LD>
<TE>   The eyes of Texas--and then the world--were upon him.</TE>
<TE>   For a definitive LBJ, stick with Robert A. Caro, the award-laden
Boswell whose third celebrated volume on Lyndon Baines Johnson,
"Master of the Senate," is now in bookstores.</TE>
<TE>   The major broadcasting networks' historical profiles have been
generally less rewarding. Ignoring complexity and ambiguity, these
dramas tilt toward cheap caricature and farce while opening up vast
chasms between entertainment and accuracy. Believe them at your own
risk.</TE>
<TE>   When defining the past, film's magnetism usually prevails over
print. The problem is screen biographies that supercede other
accounts--while sometimes enjoyable and even insightful on some
levels--are no substitute for history. The vast bulk, in fact, are
low burlesque.</TE>
<TE>   Television's most absurd LBJ? That was in a 1987 Showtime film,
when Rip Torn's squirt-sized Lyndon all but disappeared inside his
own 10-gallon hat.</TE>
<TE>   Although not cartoonish, Donald Moffat and G.D. Spradlin were
other forgettable LBJs.</TE>
<TE>   The small screen did provide one especially vivid LBJ, though. It
came 15 years ago when Randy Quaid played him big, rough and
thundering in "LBJ: The Early Years," an NBC movie whose timeline
ended just as Johnson's presidency began following the 1963 murder of
John F. Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   Quaid's LBJ was complex. But he was also lewd and hot-sauced, a
twanging tumbleweed with credibility, mingling with good ol' boys and
county sheriffs while barbecuing and back-slapping his way up the
Texas political ladder. In the role of his career, Quaid was the
longest of longhorns, capturing LBJ's appetites, his driving energy,
his overpowering personality and his tyranny.</TE>
<TE>   Recalling this, it's hard to think of America's current president
and Quaid's Johnson as sons of the same Texas, one born to privilege,
the other to poverty and earning his political spurs the
old-fashioned ruthless way.</TE>
<TE>   Now comes another full and robust LBJ in "Path to War," one played
by a Brit of all people.</TE>
<TE>   He's Michael Gambon, a fine actor who was featured prominently in
Robert Altman's Oscar-nominated "Gosford Park." His most-praised
starring role on TV was in "The Singing Detective," Dennis Potter's
remarkable British serial about a man slipping in and out of fantasy
while bedridden with acute psoriasis.</TE>
<TE>   Although burly, Gambon hasn't the height for LBJ, and whatever
dialect he's speaking, no Joe Bobs in Texas are likely to recognize
it. But wow! Gambon's performance, from the inside out, is
outstanding. He not only mimics Johnson's physical appearance--face
and elephant ears sagging with his spirits--but digs deep for the
torment he must have felt while drifting into the bog of the Vietnam
War and out of the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Face bloated by self-doubt, here is a haunted figure whose
senatorial brilliance and domestic policies would leave their mark,
but whose presidency ultimately would be felled by a war he inherited
from his predecessor and then widened.</TE>
<TE>   Directed confidently by John Frankenheimer, "Path to War" is a
powerful expression of mourning--at once for LBJ and his Great
Society that could have been greater and for a nation in prolonged
agony because of miscalculations by its president and his closest
advisors.</TE>
<TE>   Heading them is Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, the
numbers-crunching holdover from Kennedy. Alec Baldwin gives him a
slicked-back arrogance and bloodlessness that only later is softened
by glints of humanity. Peering icily through his famous spectacles,
McNamara is the first here to articulate the domino theory as
justification for pouring more U.S. forces into Vietnam. When Johnson
worries about "this problem I got in Southeast Asia" undermining his
ambitious social agenda, McNamara assures him that "sustained
military action" will buckle North Vietnam leader Ho Chi Minh.</TE>
<TE>   There's a stunning scene here with Johnson getting conflicting
advice at Camp David from McNamara and the president's trusted
counselor, Clark Clifford, a wise pragmatist who argues that
escalating the war "will ruin us and all the great good you have
sought to do."</TE>
<TE>   Although Donald Sutherland's Clifford looks every bit the
white-haired Moses, it's McNamara's commandment that Johnson heeds at
this critical crossroads, propelling the U.S. and himself toward
separate versions of the Dien Bien Phu defeat suffered by the French
in 1954.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't think we're gonna be able to beat these people," a
more pessimistic McNamara says privately as the U.S. sinks into this
quicksand despite rosy reports and inflated body counts by the
military. Many years later, he'll make his mea culpa public.</TE>
<TE>   We see Johnson here at his most commanding, meanwhile, his hand on
everyone's shoulder while making different promises to different
political factions. One moment he is raging, the next telling his
cabinet a coarse joke, the next deploying a half-whisper to softly
bully Alabama Gov. George Wallace (Gary Sinise) in the White House.</TE>
<TE>   And we see him vulnerable, loathing the Kennedys obsessively while
fearing them politically. At one point, Daniel Giat's script has him
exploding at a line of TV monitors, for in front of him in triplicate
is the antichrist. Ho Chi Minh? No, Bobby Kennedy, beginning his own
run for president by criticizing the war he once endorsed as his
brother's attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   "There's blood on your hands, you traitor!" Johnson shouts before
burying his head in his thick hands. Soon he's making his famous TV
address announcing he won't seek reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "Path to War" bulks up what many have written about these White
House years. The buck didn't just land on LBJ's desk as antiwar
chants crescendoed. It decapitated him.</TE>
<TE>   Tempest in a teabag: CBS News is being unfairly attacked for
telecasting--against the wishes of his family and the U.S.
government--portions of a videotape in Arabic made by captors of
murdered Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. Instead, CBS
should be praised for its enterprise and restraint.</TE>
<TE>   This was a sizzling topic Wednesday in those great pantheons of
cool intellect, talk radio and cable's 24-hour news. "Another crass
commercial ratings move," bemoaned Time's Margaret Carlson, a
knee-jerk commentator on CNN. Oh, yeah. As if crass ratings ploys
offended CNN. Not that Carlson helped her credibility by stressing
that CBS was also "the network of 'Survivor' and 'Fear Factor.'"
Actually, "Fear Factor" is NBC's coarse cargo.</TE>
<TE>   There was more. The CBS telecast "violated basic journalistic
standards," William McGowan, author of "Coloring the News," charged
on MSNBC.</TE>
<TE>   My eye. In fact, it upheld high standards by airing the tape in
the context of a news story and editing it responsibly so that
nothing graphic or gratuitous was shown.</TE>
<TE>   CBS was heartless and played into terrorists' hands, Pearl's
family said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Untrue. Instead, CBS omitted the tape's violence, which reportedly
included Pearl's throat being cut. As for doing terrorists' bidding,
that happens each time terrorism--including the Sept. 11 attack--is
reported by the media, giving perpetrators the exposure they want.
Being used this way is usually unavoidable, unless viewers would
prefer a news blackout and ignorance.</TE>
<TE>   The more we know of our enemies' tactics, moreover, the better our
chances to combat them. "CBS Evening News" hoped the footage would
show Americans "the full impact of the propaganda war" waged against
them, anchor Dan Rather explained in Tuesday's program.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, the full tape had been widely circulated on the Internet.
CBS said it obtained the tape from a "dissident Saudi Arabian
journalist" who discovered it on an Internet site targeting young
Saudis, and that it was "a cold-blooded recruiting poster for
America's enemies."</TE>
<TE>   CBS' edited version showed Pearl fleetingly, at one point being
made to say under apparent duress that he and his parents were
Jewish. The anti-Semitic intent of that was obvious. Although one can
understand how reliving this would be agonizing for Pearl's family,
the greater good dictated that it be shown. Besides, no one had to
watch.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish we had it, and I wish we could run it," Jerry Nachman,
MSNBC's new editor in chief, said on "Hardball" Wednesday. Good for
him, and good for CBS.</TE>

<HD>Scenes From TV's Sales Frenzy (They Even Tap Dance)</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It was the biggest show in town this week, but the point wasn't to
sell tickets. It was to sell advertising--more than $7 billion of
it--and America's TV networks hustled for the money in ways that
would have made P.T. Barnum blush.</LD>
<LD>   Backstage and in front of ad buyers at locations from Radio City
Music Hall to Carnegie Hall at the annual "upfront" presentations
here, some of TV's biggest stars turned into sales reps for their
employers, awkwardly parading across stages and, at parties
afterward, smiling for pictures.</LD>
<LD>   Network execs offered themselves up for skewering too, proving
there wasn't much they wouldn't do to make a sale.</LD>
<TE>   Whether it worked won't be known until deals are clinched. But
meanwhile, here are some memorable moments from the big show the
viewers never get to see.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NBC, holding forth at Radio City Music Hall, pressed its stars
into service in a home-grown talent show. "West Wing" actor Dule Hill
tap-danced, his colleague Allison Janney donned a feather boa and
crooned a scathingly reworked version of "Makin' Whoopee," and a
nervous-looking Tom Cavanagh of "Ed" attempted to sing. (Univision,
by contrast, went with the real thing, new singer Daniel Rene, of
Univision's music arm, complete with black-clad backup singers and
high energy on the Lincoln Center stage.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   David Letterman dropped by Carnegie Hall and blew a kiss to the
crowd before launching into some grumpy repartee with his boss, CBS
President Les Moonves--whose relationship with Letterman had been so
strained that the comedian earlier this year considered defecting to
ABC. Moonves smiled dutifully throughout. After a barrage of jokes at
CBS' expense, Letterman, who recently signed a new deal paying him
more than $30 million a year, said, "Well, you certainly got your
money's worth, didn't you, Les?" He also promised a list, the Top 10
Ways I Will Make The Late Show Better. It consisted of a single item:
"No. 10. After 20 years, it's too late and I'm too tired to do
anything but the same old crap."</TE>
<TE>   The Letterman bit also included footage of Moonves cleaning the
windows of the Letterman set, wearing an "I {heart} Dave" T-shirt,
impersonating Letterman bandleader Paul Shaffer and bestowing
Letterman with CBS Employee of the Month honors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Moonves got off easy compared with the drubbing NBC executives got
from Tina Fey and Jimmy Fallon of "Weekend Update" on "Saturday Night
Live." Because NBC Sports lost baseball, football and basketball, the
comedians joked, the network will instead stage weekly fights between
NBC Chairman Robert Wright and President Andrew Lack, who have been
reported not to be getting along.</TE>
<TE>   Wright was ribbed for having a face that never changes expression,
NBC Sports Chairman Dick Ebersol for hating sports, and NBC
Entertainment President Jeff Zucker for having no sideburns. Fallon
also riffed on the "is he staying or leaving?" rumors about NBC West
Coast President Scott Sassa, pleading, "On the way out, give me a
Porsche."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ABC's new late-night comic Jimmy Kimmel took on the turnover in
ABC's executive suite, joking that he had enjoyed the interview
process with ABC Entertainment Chairman Lloyd Braun and new
Entertainment President Susan Lyne, predicting they wouldn't be in
their jobs by the time his show debuts in January. Two months ago,
Kimmel noted, ABC looked like it would be hiring Letterman, but
instead he got the job. "This is not a step in the right direction,"
he cracked.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ABC never acknowledged directly the bad blood between the network
and its news division that followed its recent failed attempt to get
Letterman and dump "Nightline." But the network bent over backward to
try to convince advertisers how much ABC News was loved--too much so,
according to some restless clients who wanted to go get a drink and
not sit through lectures on Middle East politics from the likes of
Barbara Walters and Ted Koppel.</TE>
<TE>   Koppel had the last word, though, quipping, "Nightline: More
relevant now than ever"--a not-so-subtle rejoinder to the anonymous
critic quoted during the Letterman-Koppel flap.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the rivalry department, NBC produced a videotaped send-up of
its reality show "Fear Factor" with a scene depicting ABC as a
driverless, sinking motorboat. (Painted on the hull of the craft: "SS
Letterman," crossed out and replaced by a scrawled "SS Koppel.")
During its presentation, CBS sang about ABC's "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire." It became the network's "golden goose," the lyrics
went, but "now the eggs we lay are not golden. And our goose is
cooked."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ABC and parent Disney may be in show biz, but the network has
perennial problems with its presentation to advertisers, and this
year was no exception. ABC News President David Westin didn't miss
his cue to go on stage, as he did one year, but advertisers in the
back rows of the New Amsterdam theater still had to strain to hear at
times over noise from the rowdy stars in the downstairs green room.
The network mixed up slides of the new shows, and an announcer
introduced the stars of "New York P.D. Blue" (the show's actual name
is "NYPD Blue"), prompting snickers from the crowd that came to be
impressed. The bright-green bracelets the stars had to wear for
security reasons--even when doing their stage appearances--won't be
on anyone's fashion list, either.</TE>

<HD>In 'Mystic Masseur,' Love of Books Is the Root of All
Achievement</HD>
<DH>Directed by Ismail Merchant, this adaptation of a V.S.
Naipaul novel celebrates civilization itself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adapted from the first novel by eventual Nobel winner V.S. Naipaul,
"The Mystic Masseur" is not only based on a book, it is also a love
note to the impressive power of the printed word, a charming tale of
how an obsessive devotion to literature was the making of a
charismatic man of the people.</LD>
<LD>   "Mystic Masseur" is the fourth film to be directed by Ismail
Merchant, also known as the producing half of the Merchant Ivory
team. Understandably beguiled by his characters, Merchant is both
amused by and respectful of their situation, taking delight in their
irresistible sense of language and the rhythms of a distinctive
culture. Taking place largely in the 1940s, "Mystic" brings sweet
authenticity to a world twice removed.</LD>
<LD>   As if being set in Trinidad's rural back of the beyond wasn't
unusual enough, the story is peopled almost exclusively by Indians
who have lived on the island for so long that their speech has taken
on that unmistakable Caribbean lilt. No matter how nominally humble
their station, words and how they are used are quite important to
these individuals. There's an easy wit to their language, a sly sense
of humor that screenwriter Caryl Phillips has exactly captured.</LD>
<TE>   The result is an eccentric, amusing fable that moves at an
unhurried island pace, a picturesque tale that Merchant seems to have
invested with an almost personal sense of spirit.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mystic Masseur" opens with a brief 1954 prologue, as a young
Oxford student from Trinidad waits at a train station to meet an
important statesman from his homeland. The guest turns out to be
Ganesh Ramusmair (Aasif Mandvi), an old friend from the student's
boyhood who went from being a humble masseur-medical practitioner to
a revered mystic to a popular politician. All because of a love of
books.</TE>
<TE>   In 1943, which the film flashes back to, Ganesh was a disgruntled
schoolteacher in the capital city of Port of Spain and determined to
write books. "One day," he tells his soon-to-be-ex-headmaster, "I'm
standing at the center of world literature." His father's death draws
Ganesh back to his country village. There, he makes the acquaintance
of the Dickensian Ramlogan (the always excellent Om Puri), a genial
rascal who runs the general store and is prone to saying oracular
things like, "The place not dirty, just looks so."</TE>
<TE>   With his eye always on the main chance, Ramlogan encourages Ganesh
to marry his wide-eyed daughter, Leela, wonderfully played by Ayesha
Dharker ("The Terrorist" and a cameo as the new Queen of Naboo in
"Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones"). After a vivid wedding,
the pair repair to a secluded cabin, where Ganesh declares, "The
books I write gonna be my children. I'm gonna make sons and daughters
out of literature."</TE>
<TE>   Despite this passion, despite the encouragement of a local grocer
who says that "only printed matter does matter," despite owning 932
books, the most anyone has ever seen, Ganesh finds that the
production of his first book, "101 Questions and Answers About the
Hindu Religion," is harder than he imagined. So hard in fact, that
even Leela rebels and announces, "It's me or that blasted book."</TE>
<TE>   But although he ends up writing many books, literature turns out
to be only the beginning of Ganesh's story. "The Mystic Masseur"
details his transformation into a healer with an island-wide
reputation, a businessman, even a reforming politician. In Merchant's
empathetic hands, it's the story not just of a life, but of a
culture, a nation, a very civilization. As Ganesh says when he exults
in Oxford's great library, "Everything begins here. Look at all these
books."</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG for mild language. Times guidelines: very mild
material.</TE>

<LD>"Lingam and Yoni," the title given to each of eight new sculptures by
Mike Kelley, suggests a grand cosmology. In each, a phallic form
grows out of a vulva-shaped bowl, which rests atop a pedestal. They
are familiar Hindu symbols for masculine and feminine energy, in
which creation and destruction interlock.</LD>
<LD>   But they're also sculptures by Kelley, a protean artist for whom
nothing is ever one-dimensional. The "Lingam and Yoni" sculptures are
made from mud dug up from islands in Michigan's Detroit River, near
where the L.A. artist grew up. Creation and destruction merge with
personal history.</LD>
<LD>   At the bottom of each bowl, around the base of the nominal
phallus, bits of trash are embedded. Sexuality takes on a decidedly
earthy, frankly unromantic edge. The child is the hapless father of
the man, even as memory of the past remains embedded in the murky
ooze.</LD>
<TE>   "Black Out," Kelley's show at Patrick Painter Inc., also includes
several suites of photographs and, in the gallery's main room, an
extraordinary centerpiece composed from several parts. Monstrous,
poignant, funny, hopeful, embarrassing--this is Kelley's strongest,
most compelling exhibition of new work in Los Angeles in several
years.</TE>
<TE>   A low, U-shaped ramp is covered with broken crockery salvaged from
a Detroit River dumping site. One end features an assembly of rusted
nails, table utensils, sparkplugs and other stuff, as well as clots
of indecipherable brown gunk. The other is composed of bottles,
ashtrays, jugs and other pristine shards of clear glass.</TE>
<TE>   The flotsam in between has been carefully sorted by color--blue
plates, green bottles, white dishes, etc.--so that the path follows a
kind of "chromatic purification" process. The trash goes from raw and
soiled to clean and unsullied.</TE>
<TE>   At the clean end of the path stands a lumpy, larger-than-life
statue of astronaut John Glenn, helmet at his side, likewise made
from potsherds and other riverbed dregs. Not unlike the lingam and
the yoni, where opposing human principles are merged, the effigy of
the first American to orbit Earth is composed from the lowliest
detritus. Glenn, the namesake of Kelley's suburban Detroit high
school, looks less like a heroic pioneer than Oz's clinking Tin Man,
rising up from the end of a tattered rainbow.</TE>
<TE>   There's more. A pair of vertical display cabinets flanks Kelley's
powerfully ambiguous monument. Pull-out panels, each 8 feet tall,
feature photocopies of clippings culled from a local newspaper's
morgue.</TE>
<TE>   The clippings chronicle cultural happenings in town during the
artist's high school years. Concerts, parades, pageants, holiday
events and local celebrities, circa 1968 to 1972, mingle with
countercultural episodes, such as drug busts, the opening of the
town's first head shop, the formation by area housewives of a women's
lib group and more. It's hard to say which is more pungent,
heartfelt, absurdly desperate and even weird--the official culture or
the rebellious counterculture.</TE>
<TE>   As with much of his most persuasive work, Kelley's "Black Out"
lodges itself in a queasy, uncomfortable place that is typically
suppressed--namely, adolescence, the tormented time between the
supposed guilelessness of childhood and the sophistication to which
adults aspire. Like a blackout between scenes in a play, adolescent
life is almost never deeply examined by art. ("Adolescent" is more
often hurled as a term of derision.) But Kelley has emerged as our
most eloquent poet of the awful stress and strain of that
consequential state of being--which is very much a distinctive
product of modern American society.</TE>

<TE>   Where Imagination</TE>
<TE>   Is the Special Effect</TE>
<TE>   Prepare to be disconcerted at Blum &amp; Poe. An attendant stands at
the ready to thread Jennifer Bornstein's beguiling 16-millimeter
film, "Celestial Spectacular," through the projector and to replay
its seven short works as many times as you'd like to see it. (It's
only a few minutes long.) Given the ubiquity of chilly, automated
video projection in galleries today, the presence of a whirring film
projector and a live projectionist is positively quaint.</TE>
<TE>   It also fits the aesthetic of Bornstein's short films, which look
brand new but pointedly recall the earliest experiments in cinema
from a century ago. In "Sunset at the North Pole," a glowing orb
skitters along the cottony white horizon. "The Oldest Star" is a
nearly imperceptible flicker of light in the center of a black
screen. Three rocky spheres fly into a room through an open window in
"Meteor Shower."</TE>
<TE>   For "Plant Communication," a Boston fern placed on a kitchen table
waves a languid frond at the avocado plant growing on a nearby
windowsill. After a moment, the avocado waves back.</TE>
<TE>   The special effects in Bornstein's films eschew digital wizardry.
The North Pole snow actually seems to be made of cotton. The meteors
are balls of crumpled aluminum foil, which slide down a visible wire.
The display of an astounding "14 Leaf Clover" is surely rigged.</TE>
<TE>   Little or no effort has been made to hide the cinematic trickery,
which only adds to the charm and whimsy of the work. For those few
episodes that don't immediately disclose how they were made--like the
clover or the faint light twinkling in "The Oldest Star"--you find
yourself figuring out a simple way to achieve the effect.</TE>
<TE>   This is the grace note of "Celestial Spectacular." In a world of
preprogrammed technology and remote-control experience, the film
insists on the artistic power of imagination, inventiveness and
do-it-yourself intimacy. Then it delivers.</TE>
<TE>   Blum &amp; Poe, 2042 Broadway, Santa Monica, (310) 453-8311, through

<TE>   Wall Sculptures</TE>
<TE>   Play With Space</TE>
<TE>   The intersection of painting with sculpture fueled much of the
most interesting American art made circa 1970. Something of that
spirit seems to infect the lively new work of Torbjorn Vejvi, whose
second solo show is at Richard Telles Fine Art.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the sculptures are wall-mounted. The one that isn't,
"Watercolor Melon," is made from heavy sheets of paper cut and
slotted to form a standing object. The paper, painted to simulate
rind and seeds, merges a hemisphere with a three-dimensional grid.
Think of a digital image on a computer screen projected into physical
space.</TE>
<TE>   That's the difference between what Vejvi is up to now and what
artists did 30 years ago. Digital space isn't visible in these works,
but you sense it in their ancestry.</TE>
<TE>   "Vertigo" is composed from two planes of wood, standing
perpendicular to the wall. They're pierced in the center by a
horizontal tube. Each end of the tube is covered with knit blue
fabric, like a turtleneck. Look into the interior and the fabric
stretches the length of the tube. Inner space seems to have turned
itself inside out.</TE>
<TE>   Bright, flat color adds to the graphic punch of Vejvi's work,
which can be deceptive in its simplicity. Linearity is emphasized by
the painted purple wooden frames stacked inside a purple wooden
open-frame box in "Shaved." Visually, though, the not-quite-square
box and the tilted frames inside seem somehow animated.</TE>
<TE>   "Billiards at Half-Past Nine" is the most complex work. Six
vertical tubes of various lengths, each covered in bright green
fabric, are lined up side by side. A white cord is threaded through
them, while two white and four red wooden balls are threaded at
different places along the cord. Forces of tension, gravity and
suspension are subtly set against one another. It's as if the
geometric plotting and random action in a billiards game had been
compressed, shaken up and rearranged for your perusal on the wall.
The playful effect is uncanny.</TE>

<TE>   Taking Public Art</TE>
<TE>   in a Zesty Direction</TE>
<TE>   Trompe l'oeil painting has been fooling eyes at least since
Zeuxis' prudently painted grapes convinced some birds in ancient
Greece that they'd be delicious to eat. Richard Ankrom has just given
the venerable tradition a zesty kick in the pants.</TE>
<TE>   Ankrom painted an exact replica of a portion of a California
Department of Transportation sign, then surreptitiously installed it
on an actual sign above the northbound Harbor Freeway in downtown Los
Angeles, near 3rd Street. The real sign didn't give motorists
adequate information. The added replica, in place since August, fixed
that problem.</TE>
<TE>   Art for use, rather than art as an end in itself, likewise has a
long history. Ankrom's sign is a distant cousin to a Duchamp
ready-made. Yet while there's pleasure in the artist's having put one
over on the state bureaucracy, which didn't notice the seamless
addition until a story appeared in the press, the work is more
meaningful for another indirect but well-placed jab.</TE>
<TE>   It's safe to say that had Ankrom proposed this refreshing work to
a public art agency, it would have had as little chance of happening
as if the public-spirited citizen had tried to get Caltrans to
improve the freeway sign on his own. (Bureaucracy's main
function--which can be useful--is to say "no.") Public art is subject
to as many numbing bureaucratic restraints as anything in our civic
life today, which is one reason so little of it compels admiration.
By contrast, Ankrom's guerrilla public art does.</TE>

<HD>A Timeless Portrait of Marriage and Maturation in 'Les
Destinees'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the sweeping yet intimate, profoundly moving "Les Destinees,"
director Olivier Assayas has made a great film from Jacques
Chardonne's classic novel. Although far different in tone, time,
place and temperament, it brings to mind "Gone With the Wind" in its
depth and scope and in its love story, which unfolds over a turbulent
era.</LD>
<LD>   As a period piece it is faultlessly evocative, and it boasts
superb portrayals from Emmanuelle Beart, Charles Berling, Isabelle
Huppert and a large supporting cast. Rich in emotion and ideas and in
its social and historical context, "Les Destinees" makes most
contemporary movies seem undernourished by comparison.</LD>
<LD>   A French Protestant, Chardonne was a descendant of cognac
merchants on his father's side; his mother was a Haviland, whose
porcelain factory in Limoges remains world-famous. Set in the
Charente region of France, the film opens in 1900 with the arrival of
the exquisite young Pauline (Beart) in the rural town of Barbizac to
live with her uncle Philippe Pommerel (Olivier Perrier), a
perennially struggling cognac merchant, after the death of her
father.</LD>
<TE>   Pauline is a forthright, modern young woman who is instantly
attracted to her cousin Jean Barnery (Berling), the local minister,
who has just sent off his wife, Nathalie (Huppert), and their infant
daughter to live in Limoges.</TE>
<TE>   Although Nathalie insists that nothing happened between her and an
aggressive lady-killer (Remi Martin, no kidding), Jean feels she has
been hopelessly compromised and fears for his own reputation as a
clergyman. In the case of the Barnerys and their friends and
relatives, a 19th century sense of propriety is greatly intensified
by their belief that as Protestants they must always appear above
reproach to the Catholic majority. Feeling increasingly stifled and
seeing no possible future with Jean, Pauline takes off for Paris to
support herself as an office secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Unforeseen developments, however, propel Jean to do the
unthinkable, given the time and place, which is to divorce Nathalie,
which triggers a sequence of events so wrenching as to make him
vulnerable to tuberculosis. Pauline reenters his life determined that
he should regain his health, which means accompanying him as his
second wife to Switzerland, where they live an idyllic life in a log
chalet overlooking a lake.</TE>
<TE>   Their years of serene happiness end with the death of Jean's
father, when there really is no one else in the Barnery family
qualified to take over its porcelain factory.</TE>
<TE>   Although Jean returns to Limoges purely out of a sense of duty, he
more than has what it takes: a decisive nature, an acute flair for
design, sure and ruthless managerial instincts and a visionary sense
of industrial enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   It's at this point that "Les Destinees" shifts into high gear, as
Jean, a perfectionist like his father before him, gets caught up in
his work and is faced with the coming Great War, increasing
competition from German and Japanese porcelain manufacturers, and the
advent of the Great Depression. These are the years that truly test
Jean and Pauline's love, and the film becomes a touching yet rigorous
portrait of married life.</TE>
<TE>   The film's central figure is Jean, whose perceptive, tough-minded
sister Julie (Dominique Reymond) describes him as "a philosopher, a
poet and a mystic" capable of realizing his injustice to his first
wife and aware that he sooner or later will a pay a price for it. In
the course of his adult life Jean, like Pauline, is capable of
reflection and honest self-assessment, and they mature before our
eyes. Both possess a social conscience, and Jean knows that the
drastic steps he must take from time to time to save the family
business will incur the hatred of his workers.</TE>
<TE>   "Les Destinees" is fascinating as it reveals how our grandmothers
and great-grandmothers' treasured china was made long before
fast-acting electric ovens, but even more in the way it reveals the
daily challenges and chronic uncertainties of running a worldwide
business. As a popular entertainment form, the movies more often take
the point of view of hard-pressed workers, so "Les Destinees" is
provocative and illuminating as a portrait of a captain of industry.</TE>
<TE>   Pauline and Nathalie are a study in contrasts. "Obsession
petrifies her," Julie says of her former sister-in-law, who allows
bitterness to consume her while Pauline learns to look beyond her
youthful concept of romantic love and place Jean's needs for loving
support ahead of her own. All three principals age with exceptional
subtlety and authenticity, qualities that characterize the film's
costume and production design. The film begins with women with
hourglass figures and in full skirts that give way to the
increasingly simple and comfortable clothes pioneered by Chanel.
Similarly, often dark, elaborate Second Empire interiors yield to
'20s drawing rooms filled with sunlight and 18th century antique
accent pieces as advocated by decorator Elsie De Wolfe.</TE>
<TE>   Pauline and Nathalie age with a natural gracefulness, but Jean's
appearance reflects the deeper inner changes. The initial prim set of
his mouth gives way to a more handsome appearance with the happiness
Pauline brings--and the addition of a mustache. As the years pass,
his appearance takes on an increasingly distinguished quality.</TE>
<TE>   Assayas and his co-writer Jacques Fieschi have taken pains to
preserve swaths of Chardonne's elegant dialogue. Chardonne's
characters are all masters of the well-turned phrase, which gives a
great deal of pithiness to a film that lasts three hours yet never
drags.</TE>
<TE>   "Les Destinees" represents a dramatic departure for Assayas, whose
films are typically intimate, often involving several people in
modest, even cramped, quarters. Assayas has preserved the intense
emotional intimacy of which he is a master while working on a vastly
larger canvas and spanning three tumultuous decades. The result is a
work that in its sensibility is as classical as it is contemporary.</TE>

<HD>Jemison to Promote New Series of Free Concerts in Anaheim</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Lewis</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Linda Jemison, who nurtured hundreds of Southern California
roots-rock, alternative and punk bands during her decade running
Linda's Doll Hut in Anaheim, is resurrecting her role as a champion
of local music with a new series of free concerts starting Sunday at
the Grove of Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   Jemison sold the Doll Hut last year to start a new career as a
talent manager, but says she decided to resume "doing what I do best"
after discussions with Grove officials.</LD>
<LD>   The series, to be called Linda's Stargazer Lounge, is an
experiment designed to give rising bands exposure, give fans of all
ages free shows and expand the Grove's audience.</LD>
<TE>   Jemison will book bands to play on the Grove's patio, usually
before or after a performance by the 1,200-seat theater's headliner.</TE>
<TE>   The first concert is Sunday featuring pop-rock groups Wonderlove
(which Jemison manages) and Days Away, ska band Suburban Legends and
roots-rocker Jimmy Camp.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, members of the local roots-rock community including
X guitarist Billy Zoom, singer Big Sandy, guitarist Deke Dickerson
and singer-songwriter Chris Gaffney will play a benefit--tickets are
$15--for Children's Hospital of Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Jemison, who will continue to manage acts, says she's aiming to
book five or six shows per month.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been looking for some partnerships that would make sense
for us," says Grove general manager Steven Lazar. "Quite a few shows
come in now through [Southland concert promoter] Goldenvoice, and
Linda's was another of those names that came across to us as a great
person to create a strategic alliance with."</TE>

<HD>He's Still Chugging Along</HD>
<DH>Television* Engineer Bill Stulla, who will be 91 next week,
got baby boomers to drink their milk on his popular 'Cartoon
Express.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Red light, green light."</LD>
<LD>   For baby boomers who grew up watching Los Angeles television in
the 1950s and '60s, those words are enough to spur a mad dash to the
fridge for a glass of milk.</LD>
<LD>   For the uninitiated, "red light, green light" was the signature
viewer-participation, milk-drinking game of a children's television
pioneer: Engineer Bill--the alter ego of veteran broadcaster Bill
Stulla, who did more to get Southern California children to drink
their milk than Nestle's Quik, Bosco or Ovaltine.</LD>
<TE>   "Cartoon Express" with Engineer Bill, originally seen weekdays at
6:30 p.m., was a fixture on KHJ-TV (now KCAL) from 1954 to 1966 and
earned Stulla two Emmy Awards.</TE>
<TE>   Stulla, who hasn't had to worry about having a milk mustache for
more than 35 years, became a stockbroker after retiring from
broadcasting in 1966. "TV's Casey Jones," as one 1950s Los Angeles
newspaper headline called him, lives in a waterfront home in Westlake
Village. He turns 91 next Friday.</TE>
<TE>   His hourlong show opened with a shot of a model train traveling
around an elaborate layout, accompanied by the catchy Engineer Bill
theme song:</TE>
<TE>   "Who's that coming down the track?</TE>
<TE>   "Who's that puffing smoke so black?</TE>
<TE>   "Who's at the throttle?</TE>
<TE>   "That's Engineer Bill."</TE>
<TE>   As host, the genial Stulla wore a blue-striped engineer's cap and
overalls, a red kerchief and his usual horn-rimmed glasses. He'd sit
behind a smaller model train layout with his two in-studio guests for
the day--always a boy and a girl from local schools.</TE>
<TE>   Between cartoons, Stulla would chat with his guests, read names
from a get-well list and talk to his home audience about breaking bad
habits such as not eating everything on their plate. He'd give them
one week to break a bad habit. To illustrate how difficult that can
be, Little Mo, the Bad Habit Buster--a model train with a determined
face painted on the engine--would be shown chugging up a steep
incline and huffing, "I hope I can, I hope I can."</TE>
<TE>   But the highlight of the show came when Stulla played "red light,
green light." The game, with his audience at home joining in, was
simple.</TE>
<TE>   As Stulla and his two guests sat with their milk glasses poised at
the ready, an off-screen announcer, usually "Freight Train Wayne"
Thomas, would cry out, "Green light"--the signal to start drinking.</TE>
<TE>   When Thomas abruptly yelled, "Red light," they had to immediately
stop drinking. The goal was to finish their milk without drinking on
the red light. If Stulla and his two guests played the game
perfectly, they would get a clang on a locomotive bell; if they
goofed up, they got the lead bell (a dull metallic thud caused by
striking a section of pipe with a piece of wood).</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't as easy as it sounds, because Freight Train Wayne would
try to trick Engineer Bill and his viewers by substituting "green
eyes" or "green grass" for "green light" and "red car" or "red pants"
for "red light."</TE>
<TE>   "The guys in the studio calling the signal would try to screw me
up as best they could," recalls Stulla, "and they did it fairly often
and I'd have to say, 'Oh, I'm sorry,'" as he dabbed his wet face with
a napkin.</TE>
<TE>   Stulla has slowed down a bit. But the familiar voice is as strong
as the day he first greeted his TV audience with a hearty, "Happy
highball, engineers!"</TE>
<TE>   "Cartoon Express"--most kids simply called it the Engineer Bill
show--was KHJ's answer to the popular "Lunch Brigade" with Sheriff
John on KTTV.</TE>
<TE>   Stulla had been the host of "Parlor Party," an afternoon show for
women on KHJ, when he discovered in late 1954 that the station was
holding auditions to find the host for a new show.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'What are you auditioning for?'" Stulla recalled. "They
said, 'We're looking for a Ranger Ed.' I said, 'Why?' They said,
'Well, that Sheriff John show is so good.' I said, 'You guys are
unbelievable. In a month, that show will die because it's a lousy
imitation of Sheriff John.'"</TE>
<TE>   The Host Came Up With the Premise</TE>
<TE>   Stulla pitched them his own show, where he would be an engineer
and run some cartoons that he knew the station had bought. "I said,
'With those cartoons and trains, I can do a good show,' and they
stopped all the auditions and I went into the office and we talked it
over."</TE>
<TE>   Baby boomers' parents had Stulla's wife to thank for motivating
their children to drink milk with "red light, green light."</TE>
<TE>   Ruth Stulla had created the milk-drinking game to induce their
young daughter, Kathy, to drink her milk. She had borrowed the idea
from Kathy's nursery school teacher, who had yelled "green light" to
get the children to begin picking up their play equipment and "red
light" to stop.</TE>
<TE>   A week after starting "Cartoon Express," Stulla came home from the
studio and asked his wife how she liked the show.</TE>
<TE>   "She said, 'I like it very much, but it needs a little something
that will attract the attention of the kids--some sort of game.' I
said, 'What?' She said, 'I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm
going to buy Kathy a little engineer's uniform and you take her down
[to the TV station] and tell the kids how we play "red light, green
light" at home.'</TE>
<TE>   "I did, and all of a sudden it's magic: Everybody wanted to play
'red light, green light.'"</TE>
<TE>   Kids who were lucky enough to appear on the show had their names
drawn from a mailbag, which would be thrown to Engineer Bill by an
off-camera crew member as viewers heard the sound of a passing train
roaring by.</TE>
<TE>   "The crew would try to hit me in the head with the mailbag,"
Stulla recalled. "Sometimes I'd almost fall off my chair."</TE>
<TE>   Each child whose name was drawn would be sent a model kit of a
freight car. They would let Stulla know when they had assembled it,
and then he'd schedule them for an appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Stulla was among a handful of local children's show hosts on L.A.
television at the time, a roster that not only included him and
"Sheriff John" Rovick, but also "Skipper Frank" Herman, Tom Hatten,
Chucko the Clown (Chuck Runyon), Bozo the Clown (Vance Colvig) and
others. "I knew them all," Stulla said. "We'd pass each other on
Saturdays going to markets."</TE>
<TE>   Stulla would visit three or four supermarkets every Saturday,
drawing as many as 1,500 children at each appearance. "In those years
I was on, I must have met 5 million California kids," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Today, those "kids" have begun receiving invitations to join AARP.</TE>
<TE>   Stulla's daughter, Kathryn Mackensen, has already received hers.
Now 53, she's a retired executive training consultant and a former
international banker living in McLean, Va.</TE>
<TE>   And yes, she says, she still drinks milk.</TE>

morning show he took over in 1999, anchor Barbara Walters asks? "Sure
I do," he says. "I've got terrible Catholic guilt about everything!"
Though his much-publicized divorce may have soured some of the female
viewership, he says the show's poor ratings weren't a factor in his
decision to hang up his hat.</TE>
<TE>   "It is probably harder to walk away from failure--and I guess some
people would argue this was," he said. "But in this instance,
[leaving was] just the right thing to do. You just feel it in your
gut."</TE>
<TE>   Gumbel will continue hosting "Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel" on
HBO, but he says he'll never work five days a week again. And what of
his legacy as the first African American to host a network morning
show?</TE>
<TE>   "I am not one of those guys who got into this to be either the
richest or the most famous or the most powerful," he tells Walters.
"I got into this to satisfy myself and to try to do as thorough and
professional a job that my dad would be proud of."</TE>
<TE>   America Is Weak Link, Robinson Says</TE>
<TE>   Anne Robinson, the acerbic host of NBC's "The Weakest Link,"
didn't pull her punches in an interview with the London newspaper the
Mirror. Spurred by the cancellation of the show, she took potshots at
the intellect of Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "On one U.S. show, I asked a young soap star how many minutes
there were in a half hour," she said. "And she said '60.'"</TE>
<TE>   And the country's chief executive, Robinson maintains, is only
marginally better. She says she saw George W. Bush at a benefit
concert waving at Stevie Wonder--apparently unaware that the blind
singer couldn't see him. NBC has bought her new TV venture, "Test the
Nation," but Robinson has doubts it will fly. "The real test will be
whether Americans can concentrate for an hour," she quips.</TE>

<TE>   The Boss Sidesteps N.J. Senatorial Bid</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Springsteen decided he wasn't born to run for political
office after all.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Friedline, a consultant who helped professional wrestler
Jesse Ventura win the Minnesota governor's race in 1998, had hoped to
recruit Springsteen to run as an independent in New Jersey's
November's U.S. Senate race. The Boss would have faced off against
incumbent Sen. Robert Torricelli, a Democrat, and the Republican who
wins the June 4 primary.</TE>
<TE>   Friedline, who also served as campaign manager for last year's
unsuccessful New Jersey gubernatorial bid of then-state Sen. Bill
Schluter, said volunteers from that campaign thought of drafting
Springsteen because the current contest is boring. A Springsteen
spokeswoman, however, says her client has no ambition to hold office.
In a statement sent to the Asbury Park Press, the 52-year-old singer
paraphrased a rebuff by Civil War Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman to
the GOP convention of 1884: "If nominated, I will not run. If
elected, I will not serve."</TE>
<TE>   The Soundtrack of the Osbournes' Lives</TE>
<TE>   What are the favorite songs of America's favorite dysfunctional
family? How about John Lennon's "Imagine," the Kinks' "You Really Got
Me," the Cars' "Drive" and System of a Down's version of Black
Sabbath's "Snowblind"?</TE>
<TE>   Those are among the tracks that make up "The Osbournes Family
Album," a companion CD to the hit MTV series "The Osbournes" that's
due in stores June 11 on Epic Records.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to old tracks selected by Ozzy Osbourne, wife Sharon
and the kids, the album includes a version of Madonna's "Papa Don't
Preach" by daughter Kelly Osbourne (it's been released as a single)
and a rendition of the Ozzy standby "Crazy Train" by a family
neighbor, Pat Boone.</TE>
<TE>   Ozzy's original 1981 version is also in the package, one of three
tracks by the family patriarch.</TE>

<TE>   Southwest-Pechangas Pact Up for a Vote</TE>
<TE>   The Southwest Museum of Los Angeles and the Pechanga Indians of
Temecula this weekend hope to seal a long-term pact to send a sizable
chunk of the Southwest collection to the tribe on loan.</TE>
<TE>   The Pechangas plan to build a new museum for the artifacts and
make annual payments to stabilize the Southwest Museum's long-shaky
finances.</TE>
<TE>   The deal is dependent on today's vote by the Southwest Museum's 26
trustees and a Sunday vote by the Pechanga Reservation's roughly 800
enrolled adult members. If approved by both groups, the plan would
marry the Pechangas' wealth, accumulated since the tribe began casino
operations in 1995, with the collection of the Southwest Museum,
which holds more than 350,000 pots, textiles, dolls and other
artifacts.</TE>
<TE>   The Southwest Museum, founded in 1907, would remain open at its
longtime hillside home on Mount Washington. Museum and tribal
officials declined to disclose details on the contract until votes
were completed.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Despite rumors that he might sign with ABC and cover NBA
basketball games on the network, Bob Costas has re-upped with NBC,
Variety reports.... Eminem's Anger Management Tour, which also
features Papa Roach, Ludacris, Xzibit and the X-Ecutioners, starts
July 18 in Buffalo, N.Y., and includes stops Aug. 15 at Coors
Amphitheatre in Chula Vista and Aug. 16 at Blockbuster Pavilion in
Devore. No Los Angeles dates have been announced.... Jackie Chan
("Rush Hour"), director Michael Bay ("Pearl Harbor") and Buddy Van
Horn, who does stunts for Clint Eastwood, are being honored by the
World Stunt Awards Foundation in an event telecast by ABC on May 31.</TE>

<HD>French Kicks Deliver Thrills</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Natalie Nichols</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even as the progressive streak in modern rock has made it cool for
such bands as Radiohead to sprawl cerebrally, short 'n' punchy has
also come back into vogue, thanks to such acts as New York's Strokes,
Sweden's Hives and now, perhaps, D.C.-to-Brooklyn quartet the French
Kicks, who offered a breakneck blend of angular punk, mod garage and
pulsing new wave during its performance at Spaceland on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Comparisons to the Strokes were inevitable, if not entirely
appropriate. The groups formed in the same year (1998), and both
captured the attention of the British music world. But the French
Kicks were a little less poseur-attitudinal, a bit more genuinely
gritty, during the 35-minute performance.</LD>
<LD>   Selections from the band's debut album, "One Time Bells," also
drew from a broader set of influences, providing an entertaining
twist on an old formula. Singer-drummer Nick Stumpf, positioned at
the front of the ensemble, had a spastic appeal, his emotive vocals
often boosted by harmonies from guitarist Matt Stinchcomb and
guitarist-keyboardist Josh Wise.</LD>
<TE>   Recalling early XTC and Elvis Costello as well as '90s alt-rockers
such as Elastica, the music had a dominant minor-key drone that made
it fetchingly dark. Not everything stood out, but many tunes had a
dissonance-fueled melodiousness that was strangely catchy. It remains
to be seen whether the French Kicks will become distinguished in the
pack of punk newcomers. But when it came to brief thrills, the band
delivered.</TE>

<HD>An Enchanting 'Red Thread' by Ziggurat</HD>
<DH>The graceful and lean stage presentation is reminiscent of
the stylized film 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" brought the martial arts genre to
the attention of Western moviegoers who had hardly noticed it, the
enchanting "Red Thread" could do the same for Los Angeles
theatergoers.</LD>
<LD>   Writer, director and set designer Stephen Legawiec may not
appreciate a comparison of his new play to a movie. He told a Times
interviewer he believes that film lacks theater's spiritual
dimension.</LD>
<LD>   Still, with a female protagonist who's secretly a trained assassin
but publicly plays a very different role within an ancient Chinese
court--which is rife with intrigue--comparisons are unavoidable. And
although the Ziggurat Theatre Ensemble production at Culver City's
Gascon Center Theatre lacks the film's treetop fights, some of the
other comparisons may well be in the play's favor.</LD>
<TE>   Adapting an old Chinese tale, Legawiec gives his heroine a burning
personal conflict. She has just become a follower of the imported new
religion of Buddhism, and its nonviolent precepts don't jibe with her
violent trade.</TE>
<TE>   Her dilemma reaches a boiling point after her boss, who has just
married off his daughter to another governor's son, learns of a
treacherous plot by his daughter's new father-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   Legawiec frames the story through a present-day narrator (Dian
Kobayashi). She seldom strays from the side of the stage, but we
eventually learn that she has a secret of her own.</TE>
<TE>   The stage is generally bare but alive in color and shadow
(lighting design by Leif Gantvoort). The back panels divide for
presentations of flashback scenes from the life of the heroine.
Richly brocaded costumes by Robert Velasquez and elaborate makeup
enhance the sense of simple elegance.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Christiansen's lush music combines Western and Chinese
strains. Although largely prerecorded, with a sound that's a little
too electronic on occasion, the score also includes one beautifully
staged number that's sung live.</TE>
<TE>   The martial arts scenes are performed with solemn gravity and
pristine grace. The wedding ceremony includes an acrobatic silk dance
by Elena Goss and a magic act.</TE>
<TE>   Even outside the fight scenes, the cast moves with a stylized
polish that indicates months of training. Jenny Woo is a wiz in both
contrasting sides of the central character. Luis Zambrano and Dean
Purvis are commanding as the rival governors. Michelle Tenazas and
Sebastian Kunnappilly play the amusing young marrieds, while Ogie
Zulueta is a marvel as a cocky, nimble servant.</TE>
<TE>   Except for one awkward transition between scenes, the play moves
quickly, with no intermission and very little fat. This is a
remarkably accessible yarn from one of L.A. theater's most
adventurous talents.</TE>
<TE>   "Red Thread," Gascon Center Theatre, 8737 Washington Blvd., Culver

<HD>Deaf West Adds an Intriguing Layer to Shepard's 'True West'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Structurally, Sam Shepard's "True West" is a deceptively simple play,
essentially a long and often bitterly funny conversation between two
estranged brothers, one an Ivy League educated screenwriter, the
other a volatile petty criminal. But scratch the desiccated surface
and unexpected depths seep up, as brackish as the puddles at
Badwater.</LD>
<LD>   Director Deborah LaVine takes an enjoyable if somewhat pedestrian
saunter through Shepard's familiar terrain in her staging of the play
at Deaf West Theatre. Typical of Shepard country, "True West" brings
untamed nature into savage conflict with the dubious "civilization"
of urban-sprawl suburbia. Yael Pardess' set perfectly re-creates a
ticky-tacky middle-class home near the San Gabriel foothills.
Lighting designer Michael Gilliam evokes the glittering sunrises of
the nearby desert, while sound designer Scott Alan Smith's howling
coyotes disturbingly affirm the feral forces lurking nearby.</LD>
<LD>   LaVine, who also directed the acclaimed production of "A Streetcar
Named Desire" at Deaf West, uses a variety of ingenious techniques to
bridge the divide between her hearing and deaf performers. Offstage
actors "dub" the dialogue for the signing actors on stage. Captions,
projected above the stage, are also employed at intervals.</LD>
<TE>   Although thoughtful and workmanlike, LaVine's staging is a
somewhat standard reissue of a play that has been produced so
frequently, it is now the butt of deconstructive parodies, such as
the antic and imaginative "Go True West," recently seen at the
Lillian. The most novel and distinguishing conceit here is that
Austin (Bill O'Brien), the "good" brother, is hearing, and that Lee
(Troy Kotsur), his wastrel sibling, is deaf. It's a brilliant
innovation, one that dovetails perfectly with Shepard's themes of
familial alienation. After all, it is the brothers' inability to
communicate on equal terms that sets the stage for catastrophe.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing O'Brien simultaneously speaks and signs throughout the
play--a daunting task, heroically accomplished. However, the real
point of seeing this production is Kotsur, one of the finest stage
actors, hearing or deaf, to emerge in recent years. As Lee, the wild
and yearning opportunist who taunts his "tame" brother past
endurance, Kotsur is so electrifying, you can smell the ozone
crackling in the air.</TE>

minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Traversing Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   in Search of 'Street Stories'</TE>
<TE>   The diverse contradictions of Angeleno coexistence permeate the
world premiere of Paula Cizmar's "Street Stories," which opens
Playwrights' Arena's 10th anniversary season.</TE>
<TE>   From the outset, Cizmar's polyglot scenario benefits from Jon
Lawrence Rivera's expert staging and smart casting. As Bob
Blackburn's over-amplified soundscape crashes around her, isolated
protagonist Monica (the fearless Melody Butiu) lies in her bed tilted
high atop John H. Binkley's excellent, if nervous-making, set.</TE>
<TE>   Below, bathed in Robert Fromer's moody lighting, a staring
Motionless Man (the impressive D.G. Bannon) bestrides a wooden stool,
clutching a garden hose. Other participants begin randomly crossing
the concrete walkways, and a free-form narrative unfolds.</TE>
<TE>   Monica and neighborhood transvestite Bayla (Garret Swann, deftly
underplaying) express concern about the abandoned catatonic.
Constantly jogging Elise (the indefatigable Alicia Wollerton) offers
a stream-of-consciousness view of the landscape, as deceptively
street-jingoistic Eddie (Justin Huen) pursues her in vain.</TE>
<TE>   Concurrently, Buddhist cabby Admir (Kevin Vavasseur) drives
visiting Don (Joshua Wolf Coleman) to various locations in search of
a missing "sister."</TE>
<TE>   By curtain, these archetypes have intersected with both city and
one another in metaphorically orchestrated ways.</TE>
<TE>   Cizmar's poetic script is frequently incisive, but the compressed
trajectory works against her intentions. The relationship twists feel
overly disjointed and arbitrary, and the enigmatic denouement is
hastily achieved. This scarcely prohibits "Street Stories" from
sustaining interest, but a roomier canvas seems advisable for future
development.</TE>

<HD>She Wants 'someBody,' and Anybody Will Do</HD>
<DH>This mix of fact and fiction, inspired by the real life of
the star, is a compelling look at the search for love.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAN STUART</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone who still doubts the potential of digital video to enhance the
effectiveness of a dramatic film should take a look at "someBody."
Henry Barrial's debut feature cannily exploits the cinema verite
aspects of the technology as he follows one woman's crawl through the
minefield of love. The result is a movie that is so dead-on in its
evocation of the games people play that it's hard to tell where real
life steps back and art steps in.</LD>
<LD>   Some of that authenticity, admittedly, may have to do with the
queasy enthusiasm with which the film's star and co-writer, Stephanie
Bennett, has thrown her personal experience into the mix. It's one
thing to draw upon one's past in the service of fiction, but how many
of us would have the chutzpah to recruit our old flames to reenact
our messed-up relationships? Even Woody Allen has a more
self-protective sense of boundaries.</LD>
<LD>   Bennett plays Samantha, a Los Angeles elementary schoolteacher who
finds the taint of familiarity souring her feelings for her longtime
boyfriend, Anthony (Jeramy Guillory). Eager to experience the thrill
of other men before she reaches her 30s, she dumps Anthony and
stumbles headlong into a series of misbegotten affairs.</LD>
<TE>   While the crestfallen Anthony is busy realigning himself with a
new, more appreciative girlfriend (Laura Katz), Samantha jumps from
one unsatisfactory one-night stand to another. Her neighbor Billy
(Billy Ray Gallion) is frisky but noncommittal. A sleaze machine
named Tony T (Tom Vitorino) steals her money while she's in the
bathroom, then stalks her for weeks afterward. The only one who shows
promise (Sean Michael Allen) ditches Samantha when she tries to get
serious, as he already has a girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Director and co-writer Barrial alternates scenes of Samantha's
hapless dating career with talking-head interviews with her beaus
(and a few other interested parties), revealing the two-way current
of deceit and self-interest that makes dating such a treacherous
business. Barrial and Bennett have honed some excruciatingly accurate
dialogue from the roughshod process of improvisation, aided by the
alert editing and athletic cinematography of Geoffrey Pepos.</TE>
<TE>   The film slides briefly into flabby mockumentary only when
Samantha visits her Texas family. Bennett volunteered her own
relatives, and the contrast between these sincere nonprofessionals
and the camera-friendly actors in the other scenes makes for a
precipitous shift in tone. Otherwise, "someBody" reclaims
well-trodden territory with an innovative hand that feels fresh as
tomorrow.</TE>

<HD>'Believer' Doesn't Tell the Whole Story</HD>
<DH>But the gripping film benefits from a strong performance by
Ryan Gosling as a young Jew who becomes a skinhead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Henry Bean's "The Believer," an explosive portrait of a young Jew who
becomes a neo-Nazi, is as ultimately unsatisfying as it is
provocative. In the title role, Ryan Gosling is electrifying and
terrifyingly convincing, but key people around him are so
inadequately drawn as to be unpersuasive. Most detrimental of all has
been Bean's decision not to probe the forces that shaped scary Danny
Balint, which results in a film that tends to be all effect and no
cause.</LD>
<LD>   From frame one we get a vivid impression of Danny. After pumping
iron, Danny, a forklift operator at a fast food warehouse, boards a
New York subway, spots a Jewish boy wearing a yarmulke, follows him
off the subway car and brutally attacks him in the street.</LD>
<LD>   Flashbacks reveal Danny 10 years earlier in fierce debates with a
rabbi at his yeshiva. As bright as he is feisty, Danny feels that
Judaism posits an all-powerful God and an impotent humanity that in
turn feeds his growing outrage at what he considers Jewish
passiveness in the face of the Holocaust. "The Believer" was inspired
by a 1965 New York Times article in which reporter McCandlish
Phillips confronted 28-year-old Daniel Burrows, formerly second in
command of the American Nazi Party, with strong evidence that he was
a Jew. The consequences of the interview led New York Times editors
Arthur Gelb and A.M. Rosenthal to write the book "One More Victim."</LD>
<TE>   Danny's story as an adult gets under way when he attends, with a
bunch of his skinhead pals, an underground meeting of neo-fascists at
the apartment of Lina Moebius (Theresa Russell) and her lover, Curtis
(Billy Zane), leader of the group. Curtis believes there's only one
form of government that can restore America's "lost soul," and
declares that Danny's anti-Semitism is not only obsolete but
catastrophic to the movement. Lina, however, sees in Danny a
veritable young Hitler, an articulate and impassioned spellbinder who
could be put to good use as Curtis' group prepares to make its first
moves above ground. Meanwhile, Lina's sultry daughter, Carla (Summer
Phoenix), who has a healthy intelligence, is drawn to Danny sexually
and intellectually, eager to challenge him on both grounds.
Interestingly, the most revealing of Danny's countless remarks about
himself is that he is "no intellectual." Indeed, his thinking
reflects no theological or philosophical context but proceeds with a
logic increasingly detached from reality.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody seems to notice or care that Danny is, to put it mildly,
profoundly disturbed, the proverbial walking time bomb. It would be
no exaggeration to describe him as a raging psychopath or just plain
crazy. Bean has said that a friend, upon seeing the film, remarked,
"This isn't a movie about a Jewish Nazi. It's a movie about being
Jewish."</TE>
<TE>   According to Bean, his friend was exactly right and goes on to say
that's why his film "never tells us how Danny got to be that way."</TE>
<TE>   While it is possible to agree with Bean, that what makes people
tick may be ultimately unknowable and irrational, it is hard to
overlook what modern psychology and science can reveal about the
confluence of nature and nurture on a child's formative years.</TE>
<TE>   We get glimpses of Danny's father, a widower who sits around
looking depressed, and that's it. Bean might have come up with a
movie to match the power of Danny, in his writing of the part and in
its portrayal by Gosling (also quite effective as a charismatic,
homicidal teen in "Murder by Numbers"), had he suggested the shaping
influences of Danny's life and then attempted to evoke the essential
mystery of the human heart, of religion and of life itself.</TE>
<TE>   Bean's deliberately elliptical approach also undercuts the film's
potential for universality. Surely, all religions rest upon faith,
which in turn becomes the foundation for a system of beliefs than can
bedevil adherents. But the incompleteness of the portrait of Danny
and the sketchiness, indeed, lack of believability, of the characters
of Curtis, Lina and Carla can make it tough for people who are not
Jewish--or are not conventionally religious--to identify with a Jew's
struggle with the contradictions of his faith (which also may not be
so easy to reject no matter how intense the effort).</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, "The Believer" is admirably ambitious and utterly
unsparing, but as credible as the arc of Danny's odyssey is in
itself, the all-important need to evoke a profound sense of the
enigmatic and paradoxical in relation to Danny's fate has eluded
Bean.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R for strong violence, language and some sexual
content. Times guidelines: uncommonly complex adult themes; far too
intense for children.</TE>

<HD>SpongeBob Throws a House Party</HD>

<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Why do millions of adults tune in along with kids to Nickelodeon's
wacky little 'toon show, "SpongeBob SquarePants"? Not for the hokey
live-action "Patchy the Pirate" that dominates tonight's prime-time
special, "SpongeBob's House Party" (9:30 p.m.).</LD>
<LD>   SpongeBob is an animated, endearing sea sponge--"absorbent and
yellow and porous is he," as the theme song goes--who lives in a
zany, mixed-media underwater world and romps through off-the-wall
adventures infused with refreshing innocence.</LD>
<LD>   First-time viewers curious about the appeal of this series will
find it only in the genuinely funny animated segment that makes up a
scant half of tonight's half-hour: SpongeBob throws a party in his
pineapple house under the sea, but micro-manages it to such a degree
that no one has fun until he's accidentally locked out and arrested
as a would-be burglar.</LD>
<TE>   The cartoon is intercut with live-action segments atypical of the
show. They star Tom Kenny, who voices SpongeBob with such comic
flair. He plays Patchy the Pirate, who's throwing a sea-themed party
too, in an offbeat, "Pee-wee's Playhouse"-type abode. But ho-hum
humor and few moments of visual fun are poor substitutes for the
wide-eyed little yellow guy and his pals.</TE>

<HD>Enthusiastic, Not Mad, About the Boy</HD>
<DH>The Hugh Grant comedy 'About a Boy,' based on the Nick
Hornby novel, is endearing but could have been so much more.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's no use pretending "About a Boy" doesn't have warmth and charm,
because it does. But denial is tempting, because it's also clear that
we're meant to like this Hugh Grant-starring human comedy more than
we actually do. That's because there's a potential for something
better still that never manages to get realized.</LD>
<LD>   Much of the success the film has is because of its underlying
source material, a wonderful comic novel by Britain's Nick Hornby,
one of the deftest writers around, whose earlier "High Fidelity" was
the basis of the exceptional film starring John Cusack.</LD>
<LD>   But even without that Stephen Frears-directed example of how to do
Hornby right, it's not difficult to see where this satisfying film,
directed (and written, along with Peter Hedges) by brothers Paul
Weitz &amp; Chris Weitz, comes up shorter than we'd like.</LD>
<TE>   Though they also did the forgettable "Down to Earth," the Weitzes
are best known for their debut film, "American Pie," which brought
more humanity and sharpness to the teenage gross-out genre than
anyone anticipated. But with "About a Boy," which comes burdened with
the expectations of four major production entities (Universal, Studio
Canal, Tribeca and Working Title), the reverse has happened.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of adding to unpromising material, the Weitzes have ended
up softening promising stuff, subtly homogenizing and mainstreaming a
deceptively quirky scenario. They were doubtless attracted to the
project's honesty and style and hoped to do it justice, but their
beats are mostly standard ones and they intuitively head for the
middle of the road.</TE>
<TE>   Although "About a Boy" has a lot to recommend it compared with
much of what emanates from the studios, even its best points come
with asterisks attached.</TE>
<TE>   Its star, Grant, is a case in point. He plays one of a pair of
unlikely protagonists, the pointedly named Will Freeman, a
self-centered London single guy who's never had a real job or a
relationship that lasted longer than two months. Living on the
royalties of a hugely popular song written by his late father, he
considers being his niece's godfather way too much responsibility and
protests mightily whenever people see any depth in him, proclaiming,
"I really am this shallow."</TE>
<TE>   The script gives Will a series of great voice-over riffs, from his
insistence that he for one is a man who is an island to his
determination to be the star of the Will Show, which is definitely
not an ensemble drama. Grant handles them expertly, but though he is
a born blithe spirit, as an actor he has too much likability for us
to buy him as callow and distant.</TE>
<TE>   "About a Boy's" plot begins with Will's discovery of
attention-starved single moms as perfect dating prey. He makes up a
2-year-old son named Ned and goes to meetings of the wonderfully
named SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together), where he meets the
attractive Suzie (Victoria Smurfit). On their first date, she brings
along Marcus, the 12-year-old son of one of her friends.</TE>
<TE>   As it happens, the film has already introduced Marcus. He's the
co-protagonist, the son of Fiona (Toni Collette, who can be anyone
and do it well), aptly described by Will as a "daft hippie."</TE>
<TE>   But although his mother, burdened with depression serious enough
to make her suicidal, doesn't know it, Marcus is tortured at school
by sadistic peers and has accepted his lot as "one of the people who
doesn't have a good time in life."</TE>
<TE>   As Marcus, Nicholas Hoult, who's been a working actor since he was
8, is rather good in a wise-beyond-his-years way, but once again, he
seems to be more a practiced Hollywood version of a weird kid than he
needs to be.</TE>
<TE>   The thrust of "About a Boy" is how Will, through his association
with Marcus, is dragged kicking and screaming into the human race,
how he discovers that life without meaning is, well, meaningless.</TE>
<TE>   Because a gradually thawing Will plays more to Grant's strengths,
the second part of the film, helped as well by Rachel Weisz as a love
interest, is much more fun. But it is still hard not to feel that
this film is pushing us too hard, slickly trying to seem more honest
than it actually is.</TE>
<TE>   It's not giving anything away to say that the last shot of "About
a Boy" is someone's broadly beaming happy face. It's not that the
film shouldn't have a happy ending; though the book's closing section
is quite different, it is definitely upbeat. But reducing everything
to a happy face is more simplistic, and more typically Hollywood,
than this material deserves.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for brief strong language and some thematic
elements. Times guidelines: relatively mild material, suitable for
young teen audiences.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>City of Hope National Medical Center's breach-of-contract case
against Genentech Inc. went to a Los Angeles County jury after
closing arguments in which lawyers for each side traded accusations
of deceit and greed.</LD>
<LD>   City of Hope, based in Duarte, claims that Genentech owes it
$457million in royalty payments on products stemming from licensing
deals on a City of Hope invention, a method of producing drugs in
bacteria. Genentech received the patents in 1976.</LD>
<LD>   City of Hope claims that the South San Francisco-based
biotechnology company hid the deals from it for nearly 20 years in
order to avoid paying royalties.</LD>
<TE>   Genentech claims that City of Hope is trying to rewrite the
contract because the patents expire next year. The company said it
has paid City of Hope $302 million in royalties on the two drugs that
are covered by the contract, human insulin and human growth hormone.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second time the civil case was tried. The first trial
ended in a hung jury.</TE>

<LD>DaVita Inc., a Torrance-based operator of dialysis centers, lowered
the price range and the amount of stock it plans to repurchase in a
tender offer.</LD>
<LD>   The company modified the offer after its stock price fell in
response to an intensified government investigation of the company,
which derives more than half of its dialysis revenue from Medicare.</LD>
<LD>   The investigative arm of the Health and Human Services Department
subpoenaed financial and billing records back to May 1996.</LD>
<TE>   DaVita reduced the amount it would pay to a range of $21 to $25 a
share from $22 to $26, and it now plans to repurchase 15 million
shares, or 18% of its shares outstanding, from 20 million, or 24%.
The offer expires May 30.</TE>
<TE>   DaVita's shares closed down 42 cents at $21.97 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia Misses Interest Payment; Rigas' Son Quits</HD>
<DH>Cable: Like father, ex-CFO will retain board seat. The
company says it will hire lawyers and forensic accountants to
investigate its finances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The myriad woes of Adelphia Communications Corp., the largest cable
TV operator in Los Angeles, continued to mount Thursday as its chief
financial officer resigned, the company missed an interest payment,
and it disclosed more details of a sweeping internal probe into its
financial dealings.</LD>
<LD>   Timothy J. Rigas' resignation as CFO came a day after his father,
John J. Rigas, quit under pressure as chief executive and chairman
amid a plunging stock price, deteriorating financial condition and
federal investigation into accounting and loan practices. John Rigas
founded Adelphia in 1952.</LD>
<LD>   John and Timothy Rigas, however, will retain seats on the board of
Adelphia, which their family still controls. The Rigas family owns
20% of Adelphia's shares but has 60% voting control.</LD>
<TE>   Adelphia missed a $23.4-million interest payment Wednesday. The
Coudersport, Pa.-based company has 30 days before being in default.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia's troubles started in late March, when it disclosed that
it guaranteed $2.3 billion in loans to partnerships controlled by the
Rigas family that wasn't accounted for on its books. Some of the
money was used by the family to buy additional Adelphia stock.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Adelphia's stock has plunged more than 80%. The
company is struggling to avoid being delisted by Nasdaq and formally
told the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday that it
won't file yet another financial report on time pending a review of
its finances.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia also detailed plans for a special committee made up of
independent directors to investigate transactions involving the Rigas
family and Adelphia, which reportedly include investments in land and
golf courses.</TE>
<TE>   In the statement, interim Adelphia Chief Executive Erland E.
Kailbourne, former chairman of Fleet National Bank's New York region,
pledged that the special committee made up of himself, Caithness
Corp. Chairman Leslie Gelber and FPL Group Inc. General Counsel
Dennis P. Coyle is "committed to addressing all issues head-on and
resolving them quickly and thoroughly."</TE>
<TE>   Kailbourne said the committee will "hire a team of lawyers,
forensic accountants and financial advisors" to pore over the
company's books and records, as well as interview employees.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia has been under fire by dissident shareholders led by
cable mogul Leonard Tow, head of Citizens Communications Co., who is
trying to place three directors on Adelphia's board.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia has 1.2 million subscribers in Southern California and
has planned to put the operation up for sale as part of an effort to
raise money to reduce debt.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia's stock did not trade Thursday, pending the decision by
Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   An Adelphia spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the statement
issued by the company.</TE>

<HD>Amgen and Immunex Shareholders OK Merger</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amgen Inc.'s acquisition of rival Immunex Inc. was overwhelmingly
approved Thursday by shareholders of both companies, as expected. The
transaction needs approval by the Federal Trade Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Sharer, Amgen's chairman and chief executive, told
shareholders that a top priority is increasing supplies of Enbrel,
Immunex's rheumatoid arthritis drug.</LD>
<LD>   Amgen's purchase of Immunex was driven by prospects for the drug,
but recent production problems have led to a shortage. Immunex
already has cut its 2002 Enbrel sales forecast 10% to $900 million</LD>
<TE>   "We need to make sure the Enbrel supply is restored," Sharer said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the vote--more than 90% of Amgen shareholders favored the
merger--shareholders at the Thousand Oaks-based firm's two-hour
annual meeting criticized the deal and expressed suspicion about the
board's motives.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a successful company. Why do we have to take a risk?" asked
one shareholder, as the crowd of about 1,000 applauded. In response
to a shareholder question, Sharer asked directors to state whether
they own Immunex stock and stand to profit from the merger. None
acknowledged holding Immunex shares.</TE>
<TE>   Immunex shareholders will receive a combination of Amgen stock and
cash for their shares when the deal closes. Based on Amgen's closing
price Thursday, the acquisition was worth $14.7 billion. Amgen shares
fell $1 to $50.35, and Immunex dipped 49 cents to $26.42, both on
Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Tension Between Judge, Andersen Lawyer Boils Over</HD>
<DH>Courts: Firm's counsel is accused of underhanded tactic to
introduce evidence. He counters, calling jurist biased.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Courtroom tensions in the Arthur Andersen criminal trial boiled over
Thursday, with the federal judge hearing the case accusing the firm's
lawyer of "the most underhanded thing I have ever seen" and the
attorney firing back with charges of bias.</LD>
<LD>   The exchange happened outside the jury's presence and after
government witness David B. Duncan testified under cross-examination
that he had not destroyed key Enron audit documents.</LD>
<LD>   The fracas erupted as prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge
Melinda Harmon to bar Andersen from introducing into evidence a
billing statement the firm had generated for its Enron Corp.-related
work last fall. Harmon said the firm should have produced the
document in response to a prosecution request much earlier and was
violating an agreement by seeking to introduce it Thursday, blasting
defense attorney Rusty Hardin's action as underhanded.</LD>
<TE>   Hardin retorted that the judge was expressing bias toward the
prosecution and preventing jurors from viewing accurate information.</TE>
<TE>   "For you to impugn my integrity and our effort, I am deeply
resentful," Hardin said from a lectern across the room.</TE>
<TE>   "Well then, resent away," Harmon replied.</TE>
<TE>   "Keep the truth from them all you want," Hardin shot back,
referring to the jury.</TE>
<TE>   The heated exchange, which came after testimony had ended for the
day, underscored the tensions simmering under the surface in the
case, the first criminal trial arising from the meltdown of Enron,
which cost billions of dollars in investor and pension losses and
thousands of jobs in this Texas financial mecca.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has been charged with one count of obstruction of justice
for its admitted shredding of Enron documents. Hardin has repeatedly
crossed swords with prosecutors and made wisecracks in exchanges with
Harmon.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute over the billing statements could become a crucial
factor in the trial.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors believe that a version of one bill, which shows
Andersen charged Enron about $720,000 for work on a line item labeled
"SEC inquiry" in October and early November, proves the accounting
firm's team of Enron auditors knew the Securities and Exchange
Commission had launched a probe at the same time they followed
instructions from Duncan, the team leader, to destroy documents Oct.
23.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen said the billing statement it sought to introduce as
evidence was a final version that may show the actual sum charged was
far less, meaning that fewer Andersen employees were involved in the
Enron account as the energy trader responded to an informal inquiry
by the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan has said he directed subordinates to shred Enron-related
files in order to keep records away from plaintiff's lawyers and the
SEC, but didn't believe at the time that his actions were a crime.</TE>
<TE>   On cross-examination Thursday, Duncan said he saved documents
explaining the allegations made by Enron Vice President Sherron S.
Watkins to an Andersen partner, James Hecker. Hardin also asked about
numerous other documents that were not destroyed that detailed
internal disputes between Duncan's team and Andersen's
accounting-standards unit in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have not said what records they believe Andersen
shredded or whether any would have been damaging if discovered by the
SEC.</TE>
<TE>   The firm still could be convicted if the shredded documents were
extraneous material, but prosecutors may seek to show some of them
were potentially important to the investigation in order to persuade
the jury that Andersen acted with corrupt intent.</TE>
<TE>   Through his cross-examination of Duncan, Hardin appears to be
trying to persuade the jury that Andersen executives never intended
to conceal critical information from the SEC. The executives' intent
is pivotal, because destroying files is not in and of itself a crime.
The law states a defendant must "corruptly persuade" others to make
evidence unavailable for an official proceeding, such as a federal
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's testimony came as the two sides squared off over the
legality of part of Andersen counsel's line of questioning.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors asked in court papers this week that Harmon bar the
firm from using a "generalized preservation of documents" as evidence
that it is not responsible for the actions of executives who may have
acted corruptly. The firm responded that it should be allowed to
present examples of documents that were retained because they provide
"strong circumstantial evidence that there in fact was no intent to
keep documents from the agency at all."</TE>
<TE>   In other questioning, Hardin hit repeatedly on an Oct. 12 e-mail,
written by Andersen attorney Nancy Temple and later forwarded to
Duncan, which said it would be "helpful" for Andersen's Houston
executives to comply with the firm's document-retention policy, which
calls for keeping records that back up the auditors' final
conclusions, and the destruction of other material such as drafts or
unnecessary correspondence.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have asserted that the e-mail was a coded message
intended to direct executives to begin shredding documents as the
Enron scandal swirled around them. But under cross-examination,
Duncan said Thursday that he didn't see the instruction as a major
priority. He has said an analyst conference call Oct. 23, in which
Enron was heavily criticized, was the trigger that prompted him to
instruct his employees to comply with the policy.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail asking his team to comply with the document policy was
"not amongst my biggest priorities," he said.</TE>

<HD>Consumer Bankruptcies Climb by 15.1%</HD>
<DH>Finances: Filings totaled 1.5 million in the 12 months
ended in March as spending during the recession put many people at
risk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consumer bankruptcy filings soared 15.1% during the 12 months ended
in March, raising fresh concerns about the strength of the U.S.
economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   "The consumer sector is extremely leveraged," said Paul Kasriel,
chief economist with Northern Trust Corp. in Chicago. "I think it's
one of the reasons that the [Federal Reserve] is reluctant to raise
interest rates. It might not take all that much in the way of rate
increases to push the consumer over the edge and tip the economy back
into a recession again."</LD>
<LD>   Personal bankruptcy filings totaled 1.5 million for the year ended
March 31, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts reported.
Filings by businesses rose 10.7% to 39,845 during the same period.</LD>
<TE>   Normally, consumers shed debt and cut personal spending when the
economy begins to falter. However, low home mortgage rates and
no-interest deals on auto loans spurred individuals to maintain
strong spending levels throughout last year's downturn, said Samuel
J. Gerdano, executive director of the American Bankruptcy Institute
in Alexandria, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of economic
growth, so this strong spending--which continued in April, according
to the latest government figures--has helped pull the U.S. out of its
economic slump. But it also has put millions of consumers in
jeopardy--easily toppled by financial upsets ranging from job losses
to divorce.</TE>
<TE>   "As usual, consumers have done more than their share to pull the
economy out of what turned out to be a very small ditch," Gerdano
said. "But bankruptcy is kitchen-table-to-kitchen-table economics.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have lost your job, lost your medical insurance and you
are getting calls from creditors every night, you are going to file
bankruptcy."</TE>
<TE>   Personal bankruptcies rose 3.5% to 369,237 during the first three
months of the year, compared with the same period a year ago. Total
filings--personal and business--during the quarter were 379,012, up
3.9% from the first quarter of 2001 and the second-highest ever after
last year's second-quarter total of 400,394.</TE>
<TE>   Personal bankruptcies almost always increase for six to nine
months after a recession. That's largely because consumers who become
unemployed tend to use up their savings and other liquid assets,
hoping to get new work before their finances become hopeless, said
John Silvia, chief economist at Wachovia Bank in Charlotte, N.C. And
when they can't find work after exhausting their savings, consumers
file for protection from creditors through bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, there's little relief on the job front. The Labor
Department announced Thursday that initial claims for unemployment
benefits rose by 418,000 last week.</TE>
<TE>   There are 3.9 million Americans claiming jobless benefits--the
highest level in nearly 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   However, bankruptcies also may be rising in anticipation of
legislation that could make it more difficult to file, Gerdano said.</TE>
<TE>   Congress is debating a bankruptcy overhaul bill that would make it
more difficult for consumers and businesses to erase their unsecured
debts if they have any means to pay.</TE>
<TE>   "It's possible that debtors' counsel are saying that if you are on
the borderline, now is a better time to file than later," Gerdano
said. "Ironically, if that bill is passed, you'll see a real spike in
filings from people who want to file under the old rules."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Unit of Daewoo Files for Bankruptcy Protection</HD>
<DH>Autos: Executives say the Chapter 11 petition will ensure
that customers can get parts and repairs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Daewoo Motor America said Thursday that it filed for bankruptcy
protection from creditors. Top executives of the Compton-based car
importer said the Chapter 11 petition would protect 160,000 Daewoo
automobile owners in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   The plan, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, says a group of
South Korean banks and government agencies has agreed to provide
sufficient funding for the U.S. firm to continue importing and
distributing parts and to reimburse its dealers for doing warranty
work on customers' cars, said Mike Mahoney, Daewoo Motor America's
sales operations manager.</LD>
<LD>   That arrangement would last until July, when a private company
controlled by General Motors Corp. would assume responsibility for
guaranteeing a flow of parts and funding to the U.S. so Daewoo
dealers would be able to continue doing repairs, Mahoney said.</LD>
<TE>   The importer's parent, South Korean auto maker Daewoo Motor Co.,
went bankrupt last year, and General Motors recently agreed to
acquire certain key assets that would help GM expand its presence in
Asia. The deal, which did not include any of Daewoo's U.S.
operations, also would enable GM to sell Daewoo vehicles under a GM
brand name in Mexico and, possibly, in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   About 300 of Daewoo's 525 U.S. dealers have banded together and
retained a Florida law firm to sue GM for damages, claiming that the
company is killing the Daewoo brand in the U.S. and forcing them out
of business to clear the way for it to sell the vehicles through GM
dealerships. The suit has not been filed, although administrative
claims against GM have been filed on similar grounds in Florida,

<TE>   GM has denied the allegation and says that it has no legal
responsibilities to the Daewoo dealer network in the U.S. The auto
maker has said, however, that it will ensure that existing Daewoo
warranties are honored.</TE>

brands to keep them going, will remain open to do repair work now
that reimbursement has been guaranteed, he said.</TE>

<HD>Dell Posts Slightly Lower Earnings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dell Computer Corp. said Thursday that first-quarter earnings fell on
low personal computer prices even as the company increased revenue
and topped Wall Street expectations.</LD>
<LD>   Dell, which has used its direct business model to keep PC prices
low, guided earnings and revenue forecasts higher for the second
quarter and said it expects to continue to gain market share,
although it expects industry shipments to decline by about 5%.</LD>
<LD>   Texas-based Dell, which lost its spot as the No.1 personal
computer maker after Hewlett-Packard Co. bought Compaq Computer Corp.
earlier this month, said net income fell to $457 million, or 17 cents
a share, compared with $462 million, or 17 cents, a year earlier.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue rose slightly to $8.07 billion from $8.03 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts' average estimate for earnings was 16 cents a share on
revenue of $7.8 billion, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Dell also committed to keeping costs low, saying it will reduce
costs by more than $1 billion in fiscal 2003. It will cut costs in
product design, manufacturing and distribution, operating expenses
and warranty costs, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   It said it expects second-quarter earnings of 18 cents a share and
that revenue will rise 8% from the year-earlier quarter to $8.2
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts estimate second-quarter earnings of 17 cents a share on
revenue of $8.02 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Dell is known for its direct business model, which last year
enabled it to cut prices sharply and gain market share.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to PCs, Dell sells computer servers, networking
switches and as of this week, digital projectors.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of 2002, the company began reselling data storage
machines made by EMC Corp. and is considering taking on production of
some less pricey storage systems.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Dell, the company's founder and chief executive, said Dell
benefited during the quarter from the confusion surrounding the
merger of Hewlett-Packard and Compaq as some customers, uncertain
about which products would be available after the merger, switched to
Dell.</TE>
<TE>   Dell shares rose slightly to $27.15, up 15 cents on Nasdaq. The
results were announced after the markets closed.</TE>

<HD>Exec Life Policyholders Rebuffed</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Plaintiffs should be represented in the case by
state insurance commissioner, justices rule.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of Executive Life Insurance policyholders has lost a critical
round in their fight to keep alive their lawsuit accusing Credit
Lyonnais and its partners of fraud in the 1993 purchase of the
defunct insurer's assets.</LD>
<LD>   In an unpublished decision issued Monday, a three-judge panel of
the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the trial court's
dismissal of the lawsuit.</LD>
<LD>   The justices ruled that state law gives California's insurance
commissioner exclusive standing to represent policyholders in such
disputes.</LD>
<TE>   The lawyer representing the policyholders, who are seeking to
recover an estimated $4 billion in losses, said Thursday that he
would appeal despite what he views as long odds.</TE>
<TE>   "We will petition the rest of the 9th Circuit to take a look at
this case," said Tom Schaefer, a San Diego lawyer. "It's like saying
we lost every round of the fight, and we have the last 10 seconds to
score a knock out. We're not giving up. But this was a really, really
important round. We got one lousy paragraph after three years of
litigation."</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, then-Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi seized
Executive Life, which at the time was the nation's largest insurance
company insolvency.</TE>
<TE>   Garamendi put the company and its assets, primarily a high-risk
bond portfolio with a face value of $6 billion, up for sale. French
investors won the bidding for the company and the junk bonds.
Policyholders attacked the $3.2-billion deal as a giveaway, but it
won court approval.</TE>
<TE>   Six years later, a whistle-blower disclosed a series of secret
agreements that identified Credit Lyonnais, then controlled by the
French government, as the true purchaser. Because state law prohibits
foreign governments from owning insurance companies, the revelation
spawned a wave of litigation.</TE>
<TE>   No trial has been set, but a series of decisions over the last
month is thinning the list of plaintiffs. Last week, U.S. District
Judge A. Howard Matz dismissed a lawsuit filed against the French
bank and its partners by California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer. Matz
said state law gives the insurance commissioner exclusive standing in
such cases.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the 9th Circuit panel upheld Matz's dismissal of a
second policyholders' suit, citing the same law.</TE>
<TE>   Many policyholders fear that if the insurance commissioner's
lawsuit is the only one allowed to go forward, their interests will
not be as vigorously pursued.</TE>
<TE>   The insurance commissioner's suit, for instance, does not name
deal broker Apollo Advisors or its president, Leon Black, as did
lawsuits filed by the policyholders and Lockyer.</TE>
<TE>   The policyholders' suits also accuse Garamendi and his successor
Chuck Quackenbush of breach of fiduciary duty for allegedly bungling
the deal to the detriment of their policies and annuities.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not representing the policyholders, and no one will
listen to us," said Sue Watson of Phoenix, whose severely disabled
daughter Kathleen Watson's monthly annuity payments are $9,000 less
than Executive Life had guaranteed them.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance Commission spokesman Harry Levine said the agency is
aggressively pursuing the case on behalf of all policyholders and is
willing to sit down with anyone who has concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working very hard and diligently on this case," he said.</TE>

<HD>Gap Earnings Fall 68% but Top Raised Forecasts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Gap Inc., the largest specialty apparel retailer, said Thursday that
profit dropped 68% in its fiscal first quarter as sales continued to
sag, but the results beat analysts' recently raised expectations.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco-based company, which operates the Gap, Old Navy
and Banana Republic chains, reported earnings of $37 million, or 4
cents a share, down from $115million, or 13 cents, a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Sales fell 9% to $2.9 billion in the quarter ended May 4, while
sales at stores open at least a year plunged 17%.</LD>
<TE>   Gap said a week ago that its April sales decline was not as steep
as expected. Analysts raised profit estimates to 2 cents, on average,
from an earlier estimate of a 4-cent loss, according to Thomson
Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Gap has been struggling to come up with a merchandise assortment
to woo back customers alienated by the ill-fated foray into overly
trendy apparel two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Summer-themed merchandise at Gap and Banana Republic isn't selling
any better than the stores' spring assortments, but some improvement
can be seen at Old Navy stores, Chief Executive Millard Drexler told
analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "Our results haven't yet caught up with our efforts," Drexler
said.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, the company is pushing its classics--denim, khakis
and white shirts.</TE>
<TE>   Gap rose 7 cents to $16.89 on the New York Stock Exchange before
results were released and reached $17.32 in after-hours trading.</TE>

<HD>13,000 Have Identities Stolen</HD>
<DH>Security: Hackers pose as Ford Motor Credit workers to take
confidential data about wealthy individuals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the latest example of identity thieves' growing sophistication,
intruders posing as Ford Motor Credit Co. employees broke into the
computer database of the Southern California data firm Experian and
stole confidential credit information about 13,000 wealthy people,
officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Only 400 of the victims were among Ford Credit's 9 million
customers, and those were by coincidence, said the company, Ford
Motor Co.'s auto finance unit. Rather, they were picked because it's
easier to steal large sums from rich people with excellent credit,
said Federal Trade Commission officials.</LD>
<LD>   "Who was the guy who said he robbed banks because that's where the
money is?" said Betsy Broder, the FTC's assistant director for
planning and information. "If I'm going to steal credit, I'd rather
steal from someone who's affluent and for whom people will readily
open an account with a high credit limit."</LD>
<TE>   Identity thieves can use data gleaned from credit reports to run
up huge balances on existing credit card accounts or use personal
information from the reports such as Social Security numbers to open
credit card, bank or cell phone accounts in their victims' names. In
some cases, the personal information can even be used to drain money
directly from a victim's bank account.</TE>
<TE>   Losses in identity theft cases generally are borne by the
financial institutions, but the victims often must spend large
amounts of time and money repairing their damaged credit ratings.</TE>
<TE>   The details of how the theft was accomplished weren't released,
but it appears the thieves used Ford Motor Credit passwords to bypass
several layers of security and gain access to Experian's highly
sensitive credit data. Broder and computer database experts said
they'd never heard of anyone stealing so many key identities from
credit report providers, which have extremely tight security systems.</TE>
<TE>   Experian, a subsidiary of British retailing conglomerate GUS and
one of the three largest U.S. credit reporting firms, said it had
never experienced an intrusion on this scale. "It's a huge number,"
spokesman Donald Girard said from Experian's headquarters in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI, which is investigating the case, wouldn't disclose how
many of the 13,000 victims had experienced actual or attempted
thefts. Girard said Experian had received 2,700 calls from potential
victims as of Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The case caught Ford's attention in late February. But it was this
week before the last letter went out to potential victims providing
toll-free numbers where they can check their credit reports with
Experian and the other large credit reporting firms and repair any
damage, said Richard Van Leeuwen, Ford Credit executive vice
president.</TE>
<TE>   Identity theft is by far the No. 1 fraud complaint at the FTC,
victimizing hundreds of thousands of people a year. The ability to
open financial accounts online has made it far easier for fraud
artists, who no longer must undergo in-person scrutiny by a teller or
salesperson or have their image captured by bank cameras, Broder
noted.</TE>
<TE>   "These days, you can engage in commerce without anyone seeing your
face or knowing where you live," she said. "Technology makes it much
easier to engage in identity theft--No. 1, to obtain personal
information, and No. 2 to exploit it."</TE>
<TE>   According to the Communications Fraud Control Assn., a trade group
for telecommunications firms, more than $12 billion worldwide is lost
annually to fraud artists using phone lines and computers. Estimates
of U.S. losses to identity thieves run as high as $4billion. Victims
on average spend 175 hours and $808 in out-of-pocket expenses to
clear their names.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Credit contacted Experian in February after receiving
numerous calls about unauthorized credit checks, which appeared to
have been made by Ford Credit's Grand Rapids, Mich., office. On
examination, it was clear the credit inquiries were fraudulent
because the thieves used a different kind of software than Ford uses
to access Experian's files. The victims lived in nearly every state,
Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia--702 of them were in
California.</TE>
<TE>   Experian's hotline number is (877) 828-1530, and Ford Credit's
number is (888) 838-8176.</TE>

<HD>Kmart Target of FBI Probe</HD>
<DH>Retail: U.S. attorney and SEC also are reviewing actions of
executives, accounting practices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The FBI said Thursday that it is investigating Kmart Corp., which has
been conducting its own review of the actions of former top
executives and the discount retailer's accounting before it sought
bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<LD>   "The FBI is looking at the Kmart situation to determine if there
are any criminal violations for a potential prosecution," said
special agent Dawn Clenney of the FBI's Detroit office.</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. attorney's
office in Michigan also are investigating Kmart.</LD>
<TE>   The reviews were spurred by an anonymous letter "expressing
concern with respect to various matters," Kmart said. The board of
Kmart, which filed the U.S. retail industry's largest bankruptcy, is
conducting its own inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman at the company's Troy, Mich., headquarters said Kmart
was notified about the FBI's investigation earlier this year. He
declined further comment.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in May, Kmart said it was investigating the way the
company was run under former Chief Executive Charles C. Conaway as
part of an accounting probe it started in January after receiving an
anonymous letter purported to be from a Kmart employee.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting investigation that started in January ended
Wednesday when Kmart said in an SEC filing that it would restate much
of its earnings for the prior fiscal year and change the way it
records certain payments from vendors.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart said losses ballooned to $2.42 billion in 2001 from $244
million a year earlier. Much of that loss, about $1.57 billion,
occurred in the fourth quarter as weak holiday sales caused a
liquidity crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Kmart said in documents filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that it forgave $3.01 million in loans to former
President and Chief Operating Officer Mark Schwartz.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Kmart, which filed for bankruptcy Jan. 22, fell 6 cents,
or 5.13%, to close at $1.11 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

on to the big gains racked up early in the week, instead of
succumbing to profit taking.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow industrials rose 45.53 points, or 0.4%, to 10,289.21,
while the Nasdaq composite index inched up 4.88 points, or 0.3%, to
1,730.44, the highest since April 22.</LD>
<TE>   Nasdaq's gain was its fourth straight, the first such streak since
early April. The index is up 8.1% this week, after falling in eight
of the previous nine weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks surged Monday and Tuesday as upbeat reports on the economy
dispelled some of the gloom that has weighed on Wall Street over the
last two months and pushed key indexes to their lowest levels since
October.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a general underlying trend of an improving economy,"
Dean Gulis, who helps manage $70billion at Loomis, Sayles &amp; Co. in
Bloomfield Hills, Mich., told Bloomberg News. Still, he said, the
recovery is "a little ragged and it's going to be slow to be
reflected in corporate earnings."</TE>
<TE>   Investors' caution showed up in market breadth figures Thursday:
Losers outnumbered winners by 17 to 14 on the New York Stock Exchange
and by 19 to 16 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, profit taking overall has been limited this week, unlike
the previous week, when a sharp rally May 8 was followed by two days
of renewed selling.</TE>
<TE>   One of the weakest sectors this year--telecom--rallied Thursday
after BellSouth said it is on track to meet 2002 growth targets.
BellSouth surged $1.74 to $33.50.</TE>
<TE>   After regular trading ended, Dell Computer said first-quarter
earnings topped expectations. Dell shares, up 15 cents to $27.85 in
regular trading, rose to $28.06 in after-hours activity.</TE>
<TE>   In other markets, Treasury bond yields pulled back from recent
increases as investors bet that the economy's recovery won't result
in sharply higher interest rates soon. The 10-year T-note yield fell
to 5.17% from 5.24% on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Among Thursday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Telecom stocks advancing included SBC Communications, up $1.27
to $34.68; Sprint FON, up $1.01 to $16.96; and BT Group, up $4.28 to
$40.90.</TE>
<TE>   * Retailers were strong on optimism about the economy. Wal-Mart
led the way, up $1.58 to $58.35. Other winners included Dillard, up
$2.18 to $29.37; Target, up 97 cents to $43.37; and Sears, up $1.06
to $56.75, a multi-year high.</TE>
<TE>   * In the tech sector, Cisco Systems jumped 45 cents to $17.01,
Intel rose 53 cents to $30.77 and IBM was up 95 cents to $85.45.</TE>
<TE>   * Home builders were broadly lower after the government said
housing starts fell in April. Hovnanian Enterprises slumped $4.06 to
$25.02 and Ryland lost $5.44 to $108.51.</TE>
<TE>   * In the brokerage sector, Instinet jumped 75 cents to $7.75 after
the Wall Street Journal said the electronic trading system is in
talks to buy rival Island. A merger would end a price war between the
institutional trading systems.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Schwab gained 9 cents to $12.28. The discount broker said
it will launch a computer-driven stock rating system that will grade
3,500 stocks, offering clients what Schwab says is an objective
alternative to stock research from major brokerages.</TE>
<TE>   * Two new stock issues made their debuts. Retailer Aeropostale
(ticker symbol: ARO) sold 12.5 million shares at $18 each. They
surged to close at $27.75. But security systems firm Verint Systems
(VRNT), which sold 4.5 million shares at $16, fell to $14.49 on its
first trading day.</TE>

<HD>Enron Notes Spark a Renewed Call for Refunds</HD>
<DH>Probe: State attorney general, filing for $1.5billion in
rebates, cites documents he says prove manipulation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer renewed efforts Thursday to have
federal regulators order $1.5billion in electricity refunds to
consumers, citing new Enron Corp. documents that he said prove
manipulation of electricity markets in California and the Pacific
Northwest.</LD>
<LD>   The documents, including handwritten notes of meetings between
Enron traders and lawyers, shed light on the rough world of energy
trading and Enron's bare-knuckled strategies to combat investigations
of its market activities.</LD>
<LD>   "These new Enron documents ... further indicate that Enron and
perhaps numerous other suppliers engaged in attempts to manipulate
the electricity markets in the western United States" since at least
June 2000, Lockyer said in a petition filed late Wednesday with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</LD>
<TE>   Lockyer asked the commission to reopen the proceedings in which
California and Tacoma, Wash., asked FERC last year to grant
$1.5billion in refunds because prices charged in spot markets in the
Pacific Northwest were "unjust and unreasonable" from Dec. 25, 2000,
to June 20, 2001. In June 2001, FERC instituted price caps for
several Western states.</TE>
<TE>   A FERC administrative law judge reviewed the available evidence
last year and ruled in October that those spot markets were
competitive. FERC has not yet acted on the refund request or on a
separate request for nearly $9 billion in refunds from California for
alleged overcharges in the state's own power markets.</TE>
<TE>   The Enron documents released Thursday, along with another batch
given to congressional committees, provide a unique window on Enron's
trading business in late 2000 and early 2001, when California's
electricity crisis was intensifying and investigations of market
manipulation were heating up.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the documents are working notes from meetings in October
2000 in which Enron traders educated their lawyers about several
strategies that the company was using in California to boost profit.
The tactics included playing markets off each other, creating phony
congestion on electricity transmission lines and submitting inflated
estimates of electricity needs only to cut electricity requests at
the last minute.</TE>
<TE>   Those meetings led to two key memos from Enron lawyers detailing
the strategies by such names as Death Star, Fat Boy and Get Shorty
and admitting that Enron traders may have contributed to a power
shortage on Dec. 5, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The handwritten notes offer tantalizing fragments of conversations
with traders.</TE>
<TE>   "We made so much money," said one entry. "Schemes=$10m total,"
said another.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't causing the congestion--just increasing," the notes
said of one technique. Of another strategy, the notes indicate that
buyers of transmission were able to save money so Enron "could argue
net societal benefit."</TE>
<TE>   The meeting notes show Enron's eagerness to deflect blame to other
market participants. For example, the documents said, "Show the
Powerex/Williams--hogs at trough." Both Powerex Corp., the marketing
arm of British Columbia's provincial utility, and Williams Cos. of
Tulsa, Okla., have denied manipulating prices or supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Power plant owners and other electricity sellers have steadfastly
denied that they caused California's energy crisis of 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers who wrote or received the memos testified Wednesday
before a Senate panel that they moved quickly to end the trading
practices when they learned about them in late 2000 and treated the
matter so seriously that at one point they removed all shredding
machines from the trading operations to preserve documents.</TE>
<TE>   But Michael Aguirre, a San Diego lawyer who filed a class-action
lawsuit against power generators in November 2000, said a detailed
bill included in the documents that was submitted by Stoel Rives,
which employed one of the lawyers who wrote a key memo, depicts
lawyers actively engaged in helping Enron continue its trading
practices and avoid detection.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre points to dates such as Sept. 27, 2000, when Stephen Hall,
the lawyer who wrote the crucial Dec. 6 trading memo, spent some of
his time in a conference call with the sanctions committee of the
California Power Exchange, and Oct. 5, 2000, when Hall reviewed an
Enron draft petition to FERC protesting a plan to extend price caps.</TE>
<TE>   "What the memos demonstrate is that lawyers were helping to manage
the illegal activities on a day-by-day, minute-by-minute basis,"
Aguirre said.</TE>
<TE>   Energy consultant Robert McCullough said the documents also are
significant for what is not there: actual working records from
Enron's trading floor, such as details of power deals or operational
memos.</TE>
<TE>   "What I would like to see is the risk management analysis on May
1, 2000," just before electricity prices first spiked in California
markets, McCullough said.</TE>

<HD>Playboy to Hop Across Town</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Playboy bunny is taking a big leap across town as the adult
entertainment company moves the headquarters of its entertainment
division from Beverly Hills to an industrial area near the Los
Angeles River.</LD>
<LD>   About 200 employees of Playboy Entertainment--the video, cable
television and feature film arm of the company--are scheduled to
start moving in September to a 64,000-square-foot building in the
Glassell Park section of Los Angeles near the intersection of the
Golden State and Glendale freeways. The value of the 10-year lease is
about $14 million, according to people familiar with the deal.</LD>
<LD>   The area, dominated by a hodgepodge of industrial and distribution
plants, auto repair shops, a supermarket and railroad tracks, lacks
the amenities and high profile of Beverly Hills, where Playboy
Entertainment has been headquartered for 10 years on Beverly
Boulevard. (The parent company, Playboy Enterprises Inc. is
headquartered in Chicago). The news that Playboy would pass up
established entertainment industry clusters in nearby Burbank and
Glendale for a sleepy section of Los Angeles surprised residents and
real estate specialists.</LD>
<TE>   "That seems kind of weird," said songwriter Steve Dudas, who was
at the Ralphs supermarket adjacent to Playboy's new complex. "Why
would they move here?"</TE>
<TE>   The area might be short on fine dining, but Playboy's new location
off San Fernando Road gives the firm's entertainment division
expansion room at bargain leasing rates, while putting it in close
proximity to a new production and soundstage facility, company
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just a real good move for us," said Playboy Entertainment
spokesman Scott Barton. Playboy will retain a small Beverly Hills
office on Wilshire Boulevard for the use of some corporate staff as
well as founder Hugh Hefner.</TE>
<TE>   Playboy Entertainment will move to a complex that was designed for
dot-com, telecom and other technology firms. But, as the high-tech
industry sank, the developer of the Los Angeles Media Tech Center,
Foster City-based Legacy Partners, switched gears and started seeking
more traditional tenants. Now, the first phase of the seven-building,
400,000-square-foot is completely leased to tenants ranging from
Playboy to the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation, said Legacy Regional
Vice President Beth Calder.</TE>
<TE>   The monthly rents at the complex average below $1.75 a square
foot--well below that of Beverly Hills, Burbank and Glendale, real
estate brokers said.</TE>

<HD>PUC Slashes Costs for SBC PacBell Rivals</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Action should spur competition and lead to lower
basic phone bills. Company may appeal the decision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California regulators opened the door Thursday for the rest of the
nation's telephone companies to compete with SBC Pacific Bell by
slashing the prices the company can charge them for access to
residential customers.</LD>
<LD>   The action by the Public Utilities Commission should lead to lower
basic phone bills and to competition that may reduce the cost of such
added features as call waiting and voicemail.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a watershed event," said Michael McNamara, a senior manager
for the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, the PUC's consumer advocacy
arm.</LD>
<TE>   The commission's action cuts the cost for competitors leasing SBC
PacBell lines to homes and SBC PacBell switches that direct traffic
by about $9 a month for the average residential bill, though how much
consumers will see of that savings is not yet known.</TE>
<TE>   The reduction is an interim cost, subject to revision, but PUC
Commissioner Carl Wood said the panel is confident the new rates are
reasonable.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge win for consumers," said Ken McNeely, president of
AT&amp;T Corp.'s California unit, which plans to enter the residential
and small-business market this summer.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom Inc.'s MCI unit, which has offered its new Neighborhood
one-price package for local and long-distance calls, plans to step up
its effort statewide immediately.</TE>
<TE>   With about 11 million residential lines, SBC PacBell, a unit of
San Antonio-based SBC Communications Inc., controls 90% of the market
in its service area, which covers 78% of the state. It contends that
the previous rates barely cover costs.</TE>
<TE>   "The rate reductions are not reasonable, justified or supported by
the extensive cost studies on this issue, which have gone on for five
years," said SBC PacBell spokesman John Britton. "SBC PacBell and its
customers and shareholders should not be required to subsidize its
competitors."</TE>
<TE>   Britton said his company "will weigh all our considerations,"
including a possible appeal of the commission's decision.</TE>
<TE>   The commission's rate decision comes on the heels of Monday's U.S.
Supreme Court ruling that upheld federal rules allowing outsiders to
lease local lines at relatively low costs.</TE>
<TE>   The decision is expected to help spur competition.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC reduced the price charged for each loop--the line from the
home to the phone company's central station--by 15% to an average of
$9.93 a month a customer. . It slashed the switch rates 69% to nearly
$4 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Several PUC commissioners have acknowledged that the California
wholesale rates in effect for the last several years were too high
and were largely to blame for the lack of competition in the local
phone market.</TE>
<TE>   In getting lower rates, MCI said it will drop efforts to block SBC
PacBell from offering long-distance service, and other long-haul
carriers are expected to follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   But the regulatory approval process can take months, SBC PacBell
contends, giving competitors a jump on offering their real
money-making deals: packages of services bundled at one price.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no [profit] margin, period, in providing local access,"
Britton said. SBC PacBell can't make money simply on access charges,
he said, and must reduce those costs for competitors, which he
estimated are taking about 12,000 mostly business customers a day
from the state's dominant local carrier.</TE>
<TE>   But AT&amp;T, MCI and other long-distance phone companies had largely
pulled out of the state in the late 1990s, claiming that existing
lease rates were too prohibitive and that rates SBC was charging in
states such as Illinois and Michigan were far lower than what it was
charging competitors in California.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC, in its decision, noted that SBC PacBell refused to turn
over information documenting the need for higher costs for switches
at central stations that direct traffic and offer features such as
call waiting and voicemail. Britton said the company "followed all
rules and regulations."</TE>

<LD>ImClone Systems Inc.'s shares fell after the biotechnology company's
first-quarter loss widened and German partner Merck refused to expand
trials that might help win U.S. approval of their cancer drug
Erbitux.</LD>
<LD>   ImClone and U.S. partner Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. have been
counting on Merck's trials to win U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approval of Erbitux after the agency last December found ImClone's
research wanting and refused to consider the drug.</LD>
<LD>   ImClone shares fell $1.99 to $13.06 on Nasdaq.</LD>
<TE>   New York-based ImClone said its first-quarter loss widened to
$30million, or 41 cents a share, from $1.2million, or 2 cents, a year
earlier, as it spent more to get Erbitux approved and received lower
payments from Bristol-Myers.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street expected a loss of 34 cents a share.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Cooper Worker Says Records Burned</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co. employee testified she burned
records about tire defects after a supervisor told her a "good
employee would make sure they weren't there."</LD>
<LD>   The second-largest U.S. tire maker, facing a wrongful-death
lawsuit by two boys paralyzed in a 1998 wreck that killed their
parents, is accused of instructing workers to destroy the records.
Lawyers for the boys, who are seeking $100 million in damages, want
the court to penalize Cooper for hiding evidence.</LD>
<LD>   Cathy Jean Barnett, a former quality-engineering technician, said
that after supervisor Hogan Cooper made the "good employee" remark,
she and a colleague spent four hours burning 10 boxes of papers,
enough to fill a van. Barnett said under cross-examination she wasn't
explicitly told to destroy records.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Findlay, Ohio-based Cooper dropped 12 cents to $23.62 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is seeking regulatory approval to buy a small
Southern California bank in a move to reduce the amount it pays to
process debit card payments.</LD>
<LD>   The world's largest retailer said it filed an application with the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the California Department of
Financial Institutions for permission to acquire Franklin Bank of
California, an Orange-based bank with about $2.39 million in assets.</LD>
<LD>   Wal-Mart said it would gain an industrial bank charter through the
purchase, granting it access to the system by which customers'
checking accounts are tapped for payments. The retailer now has to
pay a fee on debit card transactions to the bank that sponsors its
access to the network.</LD>
<TE>   The FDIC said it couldn't comment because it hasn't yet accepted
an application from Wal-Mart. That could mean the agency wants
additional information, an FDIC spokesman said. Franklin Bank
declined comment.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart shares rose $1.58 to
$58.35 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>TV Networks Lay It On as They Jockey for Ads</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>At Manhattan's famed Radio City Music Hall, home of the high-stepping
Rockettes, NBC Entertainment President Jeffrey Zucker took a hard
kick at his ratings rivals.</LD>
<LD>   "We're No. 1 in the morning, No. 1 in daytime, No. 1 in late night
and No. 1 in prime time 47 of the last 56 weeks," he boasted to a
packed house of advertisers, agents and studio executives this week.
"The momentum is all with us."</LD>
<LD>   But three days later, on Wednesday at historic Carnegie Hall, CBS
was singing the same tune to the same crush of ad buyers and
entertainment executives.</LD>
<TE>   CBS not only has "television's most watched drama," network
President Leslie Moonves told them, but also "the No. 1 family
comedy," "the No. 1 newsmagazine," "the No. 1 movie night" and "the
No. 1 daytime drama."</TE>
<TE>   Will the real No. 1 please stand up?</TE>
<TE>   For the last four days in venues throughout midtown, the titans of
TV have taken turns bashing one another and claiming ratings
supremacy while unveiling their fall schedules during sometimes
dazzling, star-studded extravaganzas to wow and woo advertisers. On
the table is an estimated $7 billion for commercials.</TE>
<TE>   Although the boasts and barbs fly every year, they were at their
sharpest this time around. The competition between CBS and NBC is
especially fierce. High numbers and good demographics can mean a
shift of millions upon millions of dollars from one network to
another in an advertising market offering new alternatives to
broadcast TV.</TE>
<TE>   The smart--and big--money usually goes to the network that can
serve up the best audience. But this year during the network
"upfronts," where advertisers decide where they will place their
bets, CBS and NBC both claimed victory, intensifying a feud that has
been simmering behind the scenes for months.</TE>
<TE>   In March, CBS quietly launched a counteroffensive with ratings
firm Nielson Media Research to stop NBC from claiming in newspapers,
trade publications and on the air that it was No. 1 in a slew of
slots.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, some of the NBC shows were the highest-rated among
certain demographic groups prized by advertisers but did not have the
largest overall audience.</TE>
<TE>   Nielsen promptly instituted a policy that warned broadcasters not
to make claims of being No. 1 or "most-watched" unless referring to
total viewers or qualifying the boasts with footnotes.</TE>
<TE>   "With research, you can really tell a lot of stories, and everyone
of those stories can be accurate," said Nielsen spokeswoman Karen
Kratz. "Everyone can be No. 1 in a certain demographic group."</TE>
<TE>   Even limping ABC, once a ratings powerhouse, got into the act.
Although the network has had only one show in the top 20 during the
last year, "Monday Night Football," executives noted during their
Wednesday presentation in Broadway's Amsterdam Theater that the show
was No. 1 with male viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Same with the fledgling WB Network, which did not have a show in
the top 30 but claimed to be No. 1 with viewers between the ages 12
and 25 who are hooked on such dramas as "7th Heaven" and "Dawson's
Creek."</TE>
<TE>   Fox Broadcasting, meanwhile, had perhaps its own measure of
viewership. John Nesvig, Fox's president of sales, said the network
was "No. 1 among English-speaking Hispanics ages 18 to 49."</TE>
<TE>   Reaching the broadest audience, in dollars and cents, is
important. But increasingly, so too is finding the right audience:
between the ages of 18 and 49 and earning at least $75,000 a year.
Both CBS' Moonves and NBC's Zucker indelicately called them "quality"
viewers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a business," Zucker said in an interview, "and adults 18
to 49 is what matters. That's what advertisers are buying on."</TE>
<TE>   One look at the teeming masses squeezed into the networks'
presentations made the point. Entrusted by their corporate clients to
pick the most attractive shows for commercials, there were few gray
hairs.</TE>
<TE>   One of the fresh-faced attendees was 25-year-old Mark Kieblesz of
Initiative Media North America in New York. A buyer for three years,
he works on accounts for clients such as Arby's, Gateway computers
and Nextel. He and his clients understand their market.</TE>
<TE>   "These advertisers know exactly what they want. Networks now
really have to work for their dollars," Kieblesz said.</TE>
<TE>   Advertisers and their representatives say the networks' overheated
claims of ratings dominance are simply designed to whip up excitement
or build a bandwagon effect around a show.</TE>
<TE>   "We know the numbers, and we know that not everybody is No. 1,"
said Bob Flood, a director and principal of Optimedia International
in New York. His client list includes BMW, Whirlpool and New York
Life Insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the networks," he said, "have to play to their strengths."</TE>
<TE>   In some respects, the battle of the network executives goes beyond
money. It's about image and respect.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a war of public perception," said Gil Schwartz, CBS'
chief spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps there'd be no battling if there was more distance between
NBC and CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, NBC has a 1-million viewer edge, thanks largely to its
Winter Olympics coverage. It also has more young viewers with higher
incomes, although CBS has made significant gains among that audience.</TE>
<TE>   Of the top 20 shows, according to recent Nielson figures, NBC has
10 and CBS has nine. The other networks, ABC, WB, Fox and UPN, are
far behind.</TE>
<TE>   The sorest spots for CBS in the ratings brawl involves two
programs that rank No. 1 in total viewership, the long-running
daytime soap "The Young and the Restless" and the smash prime-time
drama "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation," which premiered this season.</TE>
<TE>   NBC, in various promotional ads, said it held the No. 1 spot at
night with the perennial drama "ER," which scored highest with
audiences between 18 and 49 but placed second in overall viewership.</TE>
<TE>   "You could say you have the No.1 drama, but that could be among
men who shop at Costco," sniped David Poltrack, CBS' executive vice
president for research.</TE>
<TE>   NBC makes no apologies, insisting that the demographic ranking of
a program is far more important than the total number of TVs tuned to
a show.</TE>
<TE>   As Zucker put it, "If advertisers wanted to reach viewers who were
wearing Depends, they would buy [ads] on "The Young and the
Restless."</TE>

<HD>Cruising Away</HD>
<DH>More opt to set sail for summer travel</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For months, Trudi and Philip Borhaug were dreaming about a weeklong
summer vacation with their two teenagers in Hawaii. But cost, airport
hassles and a nagging feeling that the island was too far from home
eventually persuaded the Sylmar couple to take a different route:
They booked a four-night cruise to Mexico instead, for less than
$2,000.</LD>
<LD>   "We wanted to do something special, because all of us are feeling
a little restless this year," Trudi Borhaug said, noting that last
summer's vacation was in Monterey while their children were at camp.
"Yet we wanted it to be family-friendly, reasonably priced and close
enough to feel safe. We think a cruise has all of that."</LD>
<LD>   After experiencing steep drops in bookings after last fall's
terrorist attacks and slashing rates to 20-year lows to fill ships,
the cruise industry is shaping up to be a summer bright spot--even as
prices creep back up to within 7% of last year's fares. Especially in
Southern California, where several cruise lines redeployed ships to
increase capacity after Sept. 11, an increasing number of families
are opting to sail rather than fly.</LD>
<TE>   The biggest line, Carnival Corp., reported that 17% of its total
business during the fiscal first quarter ended Feb. 28 came from
air-sea packages--down from more than 40% a year ago. So popular are
its Mexico cruises from Southern California that Carnival is planning
to build a $40-million terminal in Long Beach next to the Queen Mary.
A larger vessel, the 2,124-passenger Carnival Pride, will replace the
2,000-passenger Elation next year.</TE>
<TE>   Carnival has a second L.A.-based ship, the 2,052-passenger
Ecstasy, and Royal Caribbean and Princess lines have one each.</TE>
<TE>   Cruise bookings dropped by at least half immediately after Sept.
11, and in November, the No. 2 and No. 3 biggest cruise ship
operators--Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and P&amp;O Princess
Cruises--announced they would merge in an effort to counter the
post-attack travel slump with cost savings and higher volume.</TE>
<TE>   But the industry has rebounded more quickly than initially
expected, and advance bookings for the third and fourth quarters are
running above last year, according to Fitch Ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be if you lived in California, you'd have to fly to
Miami to catch a nice, gleaming, new ship," said Mike Driscoll,
editor of Wilmington, N.C.-based Cruise Week. "All of the cruise
lines are positioning new ships in that market now." A spokesman for
Carnival, which is trying to nix the proposed merger of its rivals,
would not comment on a summer forecast but said recent booking levels
"are running well ahead of last year."</TE>
<TE>   The trend toward cruises is reflected in several summer travel
forecast surveys released this week, including one by the Auto Club
of Southern California that reports cruise bookings among members to
be up 25% over the same time last year.</TE>
<TE>   The surveys indicate overall summer travel will be up slightly
from 2001, with air travel expected to be down 14% over last summer,
according to the Travel Industry Assn. of America.</TE>
<TE>   Trips by car or RV will account for 85% of all summer
vacations--up 5% from last year, the TIA survey said. As such, car
rentals are up this year; Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. anticipates all
of its 500,000 vehicles to be rented out over Memorial Day weekend.</TE>
<TE>   But while families still want to travel, they don't want to go far
or stay too long. TIA officials predict vacations will be cut shorter
this year, and hotel occupancy is likely to remain flat. Bruce
Baltin, a lodging specialist at PKF Consulting in San Francisco, said
occupancies at Southern California hotels should remain between 75%
and 80% for June, July and August.</TE>
<TE>   Room rates, however, are expected to increase slightly as hotel
operators scramble to get the most out of visitors--a development
that may turn off families who are watching their spending, said
Peter C. Yesawich, president of Orlando-based Yesawich, Pepperdine &amp;
Brown, a marketing firm specializing in travel research. Vacation
spending is expected to drop 10% this year, according to TIA.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, TIA notes about 37% of all leisure travelers plan to
attend a family reunion this year, with half intending to go with a
spouse and a third with children.</TE>
<TE>   Anne McCurdy, a La Canada attorney, said it was a need to spend
quality time with family--along with safety concerns--that prompted
her to book a seven-night cruise to the Mexican Riviera in June. "I
just felt that value-wise and security-wise, taking a cruise was our
best choice," she said. "I'll be sailing on the ocean instead of
driving on the road with the rest of America."</TE>

<HD>Records for Home Sales Still Falling</HD>
<DH>Ventura County: April prices are up $62,000 from a year
ago. Some foresee a slowdown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The breakneck pace of Ventura County home sales continued last month,
as low mortgage rates and a meager stock of available houses pushed
prices to record levels again. But some agents say they see signs
that a yearlong boom is slowing a bit.</LD>
<LD>   April sales of houses and condos were up nearly 25% compared with
the previous April, reaching the highest level for the month since
1988. And prices were up $62,000 on a typical house from April 2001,
according to DataQuick Information Systems.</LD>
<LD>   The median price of a local home has now risen 70%, or $130,000,
to $317,000 since the local real estate market bottomed out in 1995.
The median is the point at which half the homes sell for more and
half for less.</LD>
<TE>   "There's clearly another surge," DataQuick analyst John Karevoll
said, "and the sales counts would be higher if there were more homes
on the market."</TE>
<TE>   The rise in prices and sales is evenly distributed across the full
range of homes, Karevoll said. "It's the same for entry-level,
move-up and prestige homes," he said. "They're all doing quite well."</TE>
<TE>   Countywide, the median home price jumped for the third straight
month and is up $33,000 this year alone. Sales were down slightly
last month but still reached 1,556, more than twice as high as 1995
and far more than in any April since the 1,574 sales recorded for the
month in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   DataQuick's figures show escrows completed on deals struck 30 to
60 days earlier. Buyers are still lining up with multiple offers,
some exceeding even top-dollar asking prices. And the demand still
outstrips supply to such a degree that prices are climbing steadily.</TE>
<TE>   "The trend is still moving up," said Peter Greer of Thousand Oaks,
president-elect of the Conejo Valley Assn. of Realtors. "The buyers
are still coming, and the sellers are still holding out for higher
prices and getting them with very few concessions."</TE>
<TE>   About 1,000 houses are for sale in the Conejo Valley, from Newbury
Park to Agoura, Greer said. That is about a two-month supply, he
said, and far short of what is needed for a healthy balance between
supply and demand.</TE>
<TE>   In the west county, however, agents say they see slight movement
toward a normal market.</TE>
<TE>   For example, 536 homes and condos were for sale Thursday, up from
465 last month in the six cities represented by the Ventura County
Coastal Assn. of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still a very strong market," said broker Elaine Pettersen,
immediate past president of the coastal association. "But according
to the title companies, this month has been slower. We're having a
lot of closings because of the very aggressive activity in the last
two months. But sales are down this month, partly because of a
shortage of homes for sale."</TE>
<TE>   Karen Campbell, the west county association's president, said she
has heard the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is that we're pricing people out of the market," she
said. "They can afford $350,000, but they can't afford $400,000. Our
economy can't support these [continued] increases."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, completed escrows were down 3.6% from March to April,
DataQuick reported. But Diana Gleason, a home loan executive at
Washington Mutual in Ventura, said she sees no slowing at all. "We're
up considerably on new-purchase applications this month," she said.
"We have a lot of people who are pre-approved for a loan but just
can't find a house."</TE>
<TE>   Greer, at a Realtors conference in Washington, said agents from
around the country are talking about the same trends: high sales,
rising prices and a housing shortage because the U.S. population
increased 13% in the 1990s while home construction rose just 10%.</TE>
<TE>   "So we're facing the same shortage nationwide, and a lack of
affordable housing," Greer said.</TE>
<TE>   While there are hints of a break in the market's upward spiral,
Karevoll said he doesn't expect any until fall, at the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't read too much into last month's decline," he said.
"We're still seeing the best market we've had for 14 years, and
prices are reaching peaks every month."</TE>
<TE>   The only real damper on the market is the lack of homes for sale,
Karevoll said. Interest rates, which moved upward in the first months
of the year, have settled down to a low 6.6% for a 30-year fixed
mortgage, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But there is a point of equilibrium out there," he said. "As more
sellers enter the market, things will loosen up. And as prices and
interest rates combine to make it so buyers can't afford to buy,
things will balance out."</TE>

<HD>Diversity Offers Everyone a Stake</HD>
<DH>'Community' can be born in the colleges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK M. BALKIN</AU>
<BD>Jack M. Balkin is a professor of constitutional law and
the 1st Amendment at Yale Law School. His most recent book is "What
Brown v. Board of Education Should Have Said" (New York University
Press, 2001).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the surface at least, the legal question in Tuesday's decision
upholding the University of Michigan Law School's affirmative action
policy was whether diversity is a constitutional justification for
race-conscious affirmative action. A majority of the U.S. 6th Circuit
Court of Appeals said it was.</LD>
<LD>   But what really was at stake in the case was the meaning of
diversity itself. After the 1978 Bakke decision--in which a white
student sued UC Davis after he was rejected for medical
school--diversity became the focal point of debate about affirmative
action in higher education. The Bakke ruling banned racial set-asides
but allowed universities to use race as one factor in admissions
decisions. Justice Lewis F. Powell's opinion in Bakke, which was
cited in the Michigan case, however, obscured the fact that the
concept of "diversity" was itself diverse.</LD>
<LD>   One type of diversity is demographic diversity: ensuring that a
broad cross section of American society has a fair shot at the
opportunities that a university education can provide. To achieve
this, universities must pay attention to which groups have had the
least access to educational opportunity; that's why the University of
Michigan's policy focused particularly on blacks and Latinos.</LD>
<TE>   The second kind of diversity is diversity as community. It means
trying to ensure that people from the different groups in American
society learn to live with and work with one another. This vision of
diversity tries to forge bonds of trust, loyalty and community among
the people who will be running the nation in the next generation.</TE>
<TE>   The third kind of diversity is diversity of perspective.
Universities try to expose their students to other classmates with
different histories, experiences and ways of living. One reason for
this is to build trust, understanding and community. But another
reason is educational: You can learn a lot from people who don't see
things the same way you do.</TE>
<TE>   Both proponents and opponents of diversity often run these
different considerations together, as Powell himself did in Bakke,
and that can sometimes be confusing. Demographic diversity isn't the
same thing as diversity of perspective, but it helps produce it.
Diversity of perspective isn't identical to the production of a
community of trust, but it helps achieve it.</TE>
<TE>   These three kinds of diversity are distinct but mutually
reinforcing. All three assist the democratic mission of universities:
by allowing a broad cross section of society to participate in
institutions that create future opportunities and create future
leaders, by giving people from different social groups a sense that
they are part of the same community and by allowing lots of different
ideas to compete. None of these forms of diversity require rigid
quotas. But as the 6th Circuit correctly understood, they may require
a critical mass of minorities so that minority students don't feel
isolated and put upon, afraid to trust others or to express their
views. That would undermine all three types of diversity.</TE>
<TE>   Diversity is about more than ideological differences; it's about
forging community and securing democracy. The dissenting judges in
the 6th Circuit took a narrower view, identifying diversity with
ideology--whether people think differently. They overlooked the
university's democratic mission.</TE>
<TE>   In the long run, the fate of our country will rest on the
development of a multiethnic and multiracial coalition of people
educated in our universities who are willing to strive together
rather than against one another. To achieve that end, all people must
feel that they have a stake in our country and a chance at shaping
its future. If blacks and Latinos are excluded from the opportunity
to have opportunities, we won't have cooperation and we won't have
community. And we won't have democracy either.</TE>

<HD>Prescription Plan Is Hard Pill to Swallow</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CRAIG FULLER</AU>
<BD>Craig Fuller is CEO of the National Assn. of Chain Drug
Stores.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In our nation's capital, it's not unusual to be asked by friends and
relatives how legislation will affect them. These days, there are a
lot of questions about prescription drug legislation for low-income
seniors. And the truth is, people who really are spending their
retirement funds for the medications they need are pretty clear about
what makes sense--clearer sometimes than a lot of analysts in
Washington.</LD>
<LD>   So, we thought we'd create the "Aunt Mabel test."</LD>
<LD>   Simply put, we'd try to explain some of the prescription drug
programs to someone who was over 65 and see if they got excited about
how they would be helped. Since much is being written about a plan
now being developed in the U.S. House of Representatives, we're
starting with the information that's been made public. We are also
using statistics from the Congressional Budget Office on how much
medication Medicare-eligible seniors buy on an annual basis.</LD>
<TE>   Here are talking points for our discussion with Aunt Mabel:</TE>
<TE>   Good news, Aunt Mabel! Many members of the House of
Representatives are supporting legislation that will give you a new
Medicare prescription drug benefit in 2005. Yes, I know that's two
years away, but this is complicated stuff.</TE>
<TE>   Under this plan, you will be able to choose a program that will
cost you about $40 a month to participate. Yes, your math is correct:
$480 a year.</TE>
<TE>   For the first $250 you spend on prescription medication, this new
plan will pay you exactly nothing. That's right. If you need no more
than $250 worth of medication, this plan will cost you $730 a year.</TE>
<TE>   If you spend more than $250, something better happens: You pay
only 20% of the cost of your medication up to $1,000. So if you have
$1,000 in annual medication costs, you will have spent $480 to
participate in the program, $250 on your first batch of medications
and then $150 for the rest. In other words, what would have cost you
$1,000 would, with this new plan, cost $880--a savings of $120.</TE>
<TE>   For the next $1,000 in medication costs--up to $2,000--the program
will pick up 50% of your costs, or $500. So, for $2,000 in coverage,
you would spend $480 in premiums, $250 for your first batch of
medications, $150 for the first $1,000 in costs and $500 for the next
$1,000 in costs. In other words, for $2,000 in medication costs you
would be spending $1,380--an annual savings of $620.</TE>
<TE>   Now, what I need to know is what you think you might be spending
on medication, because here's the catch: An estimated one out of
three Medicare beneficiaries spends less than $500 on medication
every year.</TE>
<TE>   If you are one of those, what would have cost you $500 will now
cost you $780 ($480 for the plan, plus $250 for the first batch of
drugs and then 20% of the next $250, or $50). Yes, you'd actually pay
56% more under the new plan than you would without it.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe you really spend closer to $1,000 a year, as half of the
Medicare population does. If so, you should feel a bit better. If
your medications cost $1,000, you'll spend $480 for the program, $250
for the first batch of drugs and then 20% of the cost of the next
$750 or $150. This adds up to $880. You will have saved $120.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Aunt Mabel, there is some bad news if you are among the 30%
of the Medicare population that spends more than $2,000 a year for
drugs. You see, under this plan, you're on your own for every dollar
you spend between $2,000 and $5,000. This plan won't pay a cent.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, I know you know the math. If you actually were to have $5,000
worth of prescription bills, you'd pay $480 for the program, $250 for
the first round of drugs, 20% of the first $1,000, 50% of the next
$1,000 and 100% of everything up to $5,000 for a total of $4,380--a
mere 12% savings.</TE>
<TE>   The real savings kick in for those of you on Medicare who spend
the most on prescription drugs because the government would pay
everything after the first $5,000. Of course, that's meaningful to
only about four out of every 100 of your friends on Medicare, because
that's how many actually spend that much.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and by the way, the program does not apply to all medications.
For that matter, the discount your pharmacy already offers seniors
may save you more. And you may need to change pharmacies since not
all pharmacies may be able to offer you these "benefits." But you
don't mind a little extra work, do you, Aunt Mabel?</TE>

<HD>The Dogs of War Run Wild Again in Kashmir</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KREPON</AU>
<BD>Michael Krepon is the founding president of the Henry
L. Stimson Center, a Washington think tank.</BD>
<DL>SRINAGAR, India</DL>
<LD>In Kashmir, the public mood changes like the weather. On Sunday, in
glorious sunshine, the markets of this summer capital were crowded,
boat paddlers were enjoying themselves on Dal Lake and the giant oval
in front of the martyrs' cemetery was filled with young men playing
cricket. During the evening, the main drag beside the lake was filled
with families going out for carefree, cacophonous rides.</LD>
<LD>   Two days later, three militants shot up a bus and a military
housing area in Kashmir, killing 30 before being gunned down. Most of
the victims were women and children.</LD>
<LD>   Periods of normalcy in Kashmir don't last long. Srinagar's
superintendent of police, Sayeed Ahmed Sayeed, told me the day before
the latest attack that foreign militants were still in the area and
he knew it wouldn't stay quiet for long.</LD>
<TE>   The local militants do not, as a rule, carry out suicide attacks,
and they take pains to avoid killing their fellow Kashmiris. These
attackers were pleased to kill indiscriminately, which is why they
are called "ultras" by the Indian press. Their objective was to
prompt a war between India and Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Odds are, they are about to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   New Delhi claims that the mass murderers were Pakistanis and that
they carried evidence--a chocolate candy wrapper and a movie
ticket--pointing to their nationality.</TE>
<TE>   The government of Pakistan denied responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Both countries might be right in this particular instance; such
are the mysteries of Kashmir, over which India and Pakistan have
fought three wars since 1947.</TE>
<TE>   Many militants would look with favor on a war. Abdul Majid Dar,
the former field commander of the most prominent Kashmiri militant
group, the Hizbul Moujahedeen, told me that it would serve justice if
the Indian and Pakistani people felt for themselves the grinding,
painful realities that Kashmiris were facing. A war would also, they
presume, bring in the international community to help solve their
problems.</TE>
<TE>   The ultras, mostly Pakistanis and Afghans, are not interested in
political settlements. They want a war that disrupts U.S. military
operations and punishes Pakistani leader Pervez Musharraf for
assisting the United States and for hosting U.S. military forces.
They also want to kill Hindus.</TE>
<TE>   The suicide attackers didn't need to be carrying items identifying
their home base; New Delhi would assume Pakistani collusion. The
Indian army briefings on militancy concluded that Pakistan was "the
jihad factory'' and that Pakistan was the ''epicenter of global
terrorism.''</TE>
<TE>   The bases for training militants have been disrupted in
Afghanistan, but they are operating in Pakistan. Militants are
inserted across the Kashmir divide with the active support of the
Pakistan army and intelligence agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has sent a fourth-tier official from the
State Department to Kashmir. But this is a first-tier issue for New
Delhi.</TE>
<TE>   The government of India feels that President Bush is too dependent
on Pakistan for the war against Al Qaeda to pressure Musharraf to
stop the infiltration. U.S. appeals for continued restraint only
deepen India's sense of grievance.</TE>
<TE>   India's military officers have worked hard to figure out how to
fight a limited war against a nuclear-armed adversary. It now appears
that these risky concepts will be tested on the battlefield.</TE>

<HD>In Hindsight, Warnings Are Clear</HD>
<DH>Pearl Harbor to Sept. 11, the signs were obscured.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York. E-mail: pinkerto@ix.netcom.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What did the president know, and when did he know it? That was the
question asked of Richard M. Nixon during the Watergate investigation
three decades ago--and it's going to be heard a lot in the days,
months and years to come, as the Sept. 11 investigations multiply in
the wake of the latest revelation that George W. Bush knew more than
he first let on.</LD>
<LD>   Then, as now, a Republican chief executive faces questioning from
skeptical Democrats in Congress. But one difference is that the
media, now extended to cable news and the Internet, are so much more
omnipresent, so much more capable of firing up a firestorm. The
cliche of contemporary journalism is that the baby-boomerish
reporters who dominate the field, always seeking to regain the
idealistic iconoclasm of their lost youth, are forever searching for
the next Watergate, or the next Vietnam. That is, they yearn for
either a domestic cover-up to uncover or a foreign war to debunk. For
some, Sept. 11 is both.</LD>
<LD>   Yet while the parallels to the events of the 1960s and 1970s might
be strong, the parallels to Pearl Harbor are even stronger.</LD>
<TE>   Immediately after Dec. 7, 1941, some suspected that President
Franklin D. Roosevelt knew in advance about the Japanese attack, but
the censorship and self-censorship of World War II kept a lid on
criticizing and inquiring. That lid came off when the war ended.</TE>
<TE>   The first public hearings were opened Nov. 15, 1945, by the Joint
Congressional Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor
Attack. The bipartisan panel received testimony from 43 witnesses,
examined 183 exhibits and generated 15,000 pages of documentation.
Its final report, issued July 16, 1946, found that contrary to some
claims, no genuine message was received either by the War Department
or the Navy Department; the military was then, oddly enough, divided
into a War Department overseeing the Army and a Navy Department
overseeing the Navy and Marines. And so FDR, the committee concluded,
could not have been complicit in the death of 2,300 Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it issued 11 recommendations aimed at the structural
failures it found, especially the rivalry between the Army's War
Plans Division and the Navy's Office of Naval Intelligence. As the
final report noted, "Personal or official jealousy will wreck any
organization."</TE>
<TE>   As a partial result of the lessons learned from Pearl Harbor, the
White House and Congress worked together to enact the National
Security Act of 1947, which consolidated War and Navy into a single
Department of Defense. The same legislation created the Central
Intelligence Agency, empowered to coordinate all foreign intelligence
gathering.</TE>
<TE>   These bureaucratic reforms worked well enough to win the Cold War,
and yet they hardly put to rest historical revisionism about Pearl
Harbor. Since then, as more documents have been declassified, books
both attacking and defending Roosevelt have poured forth. Congress
too has stayed in the game; its last look into Pearl Harbor wrapped
up in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   But the definitive work on Dec. 7 argues that yes, indeed, some
Americans knew that the Japanese were going to bomb Pearl Harbor. But
we also knew that they were going to bomb the Panama Canal and the
Philippines and other points around the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   In "Pearl Harbor: Warning and Decision" (1962), Roberta
Wohlstetter used the word "static" to describe the dull roar of
complementary and contradictory information, such that nobody could
reasonably have known what the Japanese had in mind.</TE>
<TE>   Static. That's the word to bear in mind as the Sept. 11
investigations fly forth, on and off Capitol Hill. And the sound will
grow louder in the multimedia mixer as the farrago of facts and
factoids echoes from here to cyberspace eternity. In the din, it will
be easy for some conspiracists to connect selected data-dots and so
"prove" that Bush, or Karl Rove, or Enron, knew that Sept. 11 was
coming. But the fair-minded will see that such retrospective blaming
is easy. What's hard is threat-assessing.</TE>
<TE>   And so while it's likely that Bush will be tarnished by the
investigating and scooping to come, it's hard to believe he'll be
revealed as treacherous.</TE>
<TE>   And in the meantime, all the president has to do is fend off the
critics and the crazies, implement necessary reforms--and try to
listen through all the static for warning signs of the next attack.</TE>

<LD>Each day brings another example of a highly paid executive caught
with his hand--legally--in the corporate cookie jar. E-Trade Group
Inc. last year lost $241 million; its board of directors now is
scrambling to defend its chairman's $80-million compensation package.
A judge in Chicago has ordered Kmart Corp. to explain lavish
severance packages granted as the company tumbled into bankruptcy.
These are just two of this month's developments.</LD>
<LD>   What's to be done? Congress and the Securities and Exchange
Commission could lead by forcing corporations to register stock
options granted to executives as an expense on their income
statements. Options packages, which were designed to let executives
share in the wealth as stock prices rose, have gotten more devious in
recent years. Boards of directors sometimes even reissue stock
options to executives at a lower base price if the stock loses value.
What kind of incentive is that? It's not a deal that stockholders are
offered.</LD>
<TE>   Option deals have exploded in recent years, according to the
Council on Institutional Investors. Shareholders, though, must wade
through complicated footnotes in financial statements to uncover, for
instance, that their company has issued hundreds of thousands of
shares at rock-bottom prices that will eat up potential profit when
exercised. The impact of options on a company's bottom line should be
up front, not in the tiny type.</TE>
<TE>   Powerful institutional investors, including the California Public
Employees' Retirement System, should continue to push corporate
boards of directors to be more accountable. Bank of America Corp.
shareholders, led by union pension funds, last month surprised
management by passing a resolution that called for limits on
severance packages. A threatened strike by Las Vegas casino workers
is being fueled in part by allegations that recent layoffs were
driven more by executives' concern over their own stock options than
the post-Sept. 11 travel slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   Excessive executive compensation is only a symptom of a deeper
problem--that boards of directors are paying more attention to
executives' happiness than shareholder value.</TE>
<TE>   Stock exchanges, which set rules of corporate governance for
publicly traded stocks, should do more. They could, for instance,
require publicly traded companies to adopt term limits for boards of
directors, limit the number of a company's executives that may serve
on its board and forbid executives to sit on their own firms'
compensation committees.</TE>
<TE>   A positive sign out of Washington in the wake of Enron Corp.'s
failure is that the SEC is paying more attention to the actions of
top executives in possible corporate wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing wrong with fat paychecks. They're part and parcel
of the American dream. But they should be earned, and not at the
expense of shareholders and employees.</TE>

<LD>Where's Joel Wachs when we need him?</LD>
<LD>   The former city councilman, who was the ultimate insider and
finger-in-the-wind pol, nonetheless knew a fleece job when he saw
one. In 1997, Ed Roski Jr. and Philip Anschutz argued persuasively
that Los Angeles would get a super deal by floating $58 million in
municipal bond funds to help build Staples Center, money they would
repay with tax dollars generated at the arena. Wachs cried foul and
kept yelling until the City Council forced the developers to agree to
repay the debt without using funds from sales, property or utility
taxes. They will also pay several million dollars for a 55-year lease
on the land rather than the $1 a year originally proposed.</LD>
<LD>   With a net worth estimated at $6.9 billion, Anschutz is the
world's 54th richest person. But he says he still needs taxpayers'
help to build a football stadium beside Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   Here's the deal: Anschutz Entertainment Group has already bought
up most of the 20 acres it needs. The company wants the city to help
acquire the rest of the land. Then--here's where things get
creative--the city or the Community Redevelopment Agency would float
about $100 million in bond funds to buy all 20 acres, including the
property the stadium group already owns. The developers, who would
get a long-term lease on the land, would repay taxpayers for their
bond loan out of ticket sales, taxes and other revenue. For the
numbers to pencil out, the National Football League would have to
offer a loan and secure commitments for a team franchise and Super
Bowl games in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Where are the Wachs-style questions, or even a little of his
righteous indignation? Where, in fact, is the public debate on this
issue? Instead, our city leaders seem hellbent to do the deal. On
Tuesday, the council introduced a motion to allow the use of public
money to help build a stadium so long as the funds were repaid. That
motion will be heard next month. Nothing should go forward until
every bit of fine print is examined, in public.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, when the council gave preliminary approval to a plan
allowing property taxes and other revenue to go toward revitalization
of 879 acres downtown, council members indignantly denied that
football was the driving force. Housing and hotel plans seemed to be
the chief items on the table.</TE>
<TE>   Guess what? As soon as Wednesday's final vote on the plan was in
the bag, out came the foam-board models and the hard sell about how a
major league city needs a major league professional football team.
Last week, Mayor James K. Hahn said he was still "studying" the plan,
but Thursday, study hall apparently over, Hahn stood shoulder to
shoulder with the stadium boosters at a news conference on the plan.
Meanwhile, at the request of the development group's president,
Councilman Nick Pacheco has signed onto a team working to bring
football back to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Whoa. Let's take a step back. Is building another huge sports
venue, one that would be dark far more than it would be in use, the
best way to spur downtown redevelopment? It surely wouldn't be the
best way to use public bond money, which would be tied up for years
even if it was eventually repaid. And why do we feel as if L.A.'s
about to get rolled again?</TE>

<HD>Grand Jury for Abuse Cases</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has finally come to this: A grand jury needs to investigate
Catholic priests' abuse of minors in the Los Angeles Archdiocese.</LD>
<LD>   Whenever an adult molests a child, it's a matter for law
enforcement and civil society--whether the crime occurs at a soccer
field, a school or a seminary. Anyone who can help in the
investigation has a moral and legal responsibility to cooperate
promptly and fully.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, neither Catholic parishioners nor the police nor
the public can trust that the information drip, drip, dripping out of
Cardinal Roger Mahony's office is accurate or complete. The Los
Angeles County Grand Jury could compel Mahony and other officials in
the Los Angeles Archdiocese to disclose the names of every last
priest accused of molestation and to detail the allegations under
oath, except when the information was divulged in the confessional.</LD>
<TE>   By requiring the church to turn over documents, including
personnel files, the jury could cut through the archdiocese's
apparent stalling and obfuscation. In doing so, it should be able to
find out how many children were hurt by church officials'
reassignment of accused offenders to other parishes.</TE>
<TE>   In an April 8 letter, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley
asked for Mahony's "personal assurance" that all known or reasonably
suspected instances of child abuse had been reported to the
appropriate law enforcement agencies. In another letter, sent
Thursday, Cooley added this warning: "Nothing short of a full
accounting with written documentation is acceptable. If it is not
forthcoming, the grand jury will be utilized to obtain it."</TE>
<TE>   In Thursday's Times, staff writer Glenn F. Bunting detailed the
story of a priest accused of abusing at least nine children over the
years. Mahony first heard of the case in 1986, knew that the abuse
continued over the years and arranged for a secret $1.3-million
payout to victims and the priest's retirement in 2000. But he
reported the incident to police only weeks ago, in March, as public
and law enforcement pressure mounted.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, even if Mahony satisfies the district attorney's
office that the archdiocese has been straightforward, the public will
harbor doubts. A grand jury investigation is the best way to assure
that the archdiocese has stopped stonewalling.</TE>

<LD>Re "Bush Told of Likely Hijacks,'' May 16: Now the cowboy who lives
at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue wants us to believe that no one could
have anticipated the events of Sept. 11. He claims those prior
warnings lacked specific details sufficient to prevent the
destruction of the World Trade Center towers. What more warnings were
they looking for? Messages were sent and received when the World
Trade Center parking center was bombed Feb. 26,1993; American troops
were attacked in Somalia on Oct. 3 and 4, 1993; the Khobar Towers in
Saudi Arabia were bombed June 25, 1996; our embassies in Nairobi and
Tanzania were bombed Aug. 7, 1998; the U.S. destroyer Cole was
attacked Oct. 12, 2000. Those responsible for these acts were under
surveillance before, during and after these dramatic signals of
intent to kill U.S. service personnel and civilians.</LD>
<LD>   Washington demonstrated its capabilities of tracking domestic
"radicals" during the Cold War period following World War II. The FBI
infiltrated and intercepted the internal communications of
organizations that the super-patriots labeled subversive. It is hard
to believe that our spy catchers have grown so inept since the 1950s.
What is believable is that the present occupants of the White House
are not up to protecting us.</LD>

<LD>Re "Lights Out on Bush's Excuses," Commentary, May 14: Robert Scheer
continues to believe that a master conspiracy existed between
President Bush and Enron to drive up the cost of energy to exorbitant
rates for Californians. Never mind that this crisis developed before
Bush took office.</LD>
<LD>   Scheer also ignores the fact that Gov. Gray Davis refused to sign
long-term contracts with energy companies when rates were reasonably
low--he waited until they peaked, and the prices literally fell out
within a couple of weeks of the signing, which ensures that
Californians will be paying outrageous utility bills, in some cases,
for the next 20 years. Davis took $119,500 in donations from Enron. I
have drawn my conclusion as to who is in cahoots with whom.</LD>

<TE>   Scheer's column hits the nail on the head. We Californians will
not forget the energy crisis of a year ago. When Gov. Davis asked for
Bush's help, we were told: You created your problems, now deal with
it. Now we know Enron's manipulation and fraudulent behavior helped
create our crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's link to his friend Kenneth Lay, Enron's funding of his
campaign and his thumbing the nose to California will not be
forgotten. Come the next election, he and his cronies will not only
be defeated in California but humiliated.</TE>

<LD>Re "Davis Seeks Tax Hikes to Bridge Gap," May 15: I find the
explanation by Gov. Gray Davis for the budgetary crisis unacceptable.
He says it is because the stock market is down and the money that
came from the investors previously is gone. Come on, Gray, face the
truth. You and the Legislature have pandered to every special-
interest group imaginable, from prison guards to teachers to welfare
moms. Your half-baked schemes to improve education have contributed
nothing except to drain money from the state treasury with nothing to
show for it. Prisons are worse now than ever except that the guards
make more money. And welfare moms continue to contribute nothing to
society except to breed more kids.</LD>
<LD>   Now you want the working people to pay for your follies. No way.
We have to pinch pennies as it is, and you want more blood. I wish we
had a good write-in candidate for governor. The choice between Davis
and Bill Simon is sickening, as is the thought of paying more taxes
and receiving nothing back, as usual.</LD>

deficit. 1+1+1=-$23.6 billion.</TE>

the two-party system in California, and we need a new governor with a
good sense of business and budgets--Simon!</TE>

something in the newspaper recently, but the last time I checked,
smoking was perfectly legal. If that's the case, why are smokers
constantly being punished?</TE>

<LD>Finally, Yasser Arafat called for a complete overhaul of the
Palestinian Authority at some indefinite time in the future (May 16).
Moderate Palestinians have been trying unsuccessfully to accomplish
reform for years. Israel has said that it cannot make peace with an
uncontrolled dictatorship on its borders. If Ariel Sharon
accomplished anything by Operation Defensive Shield, it was to force
a corrupt Palestinian leadership, for the first time, to face its own
failures and seek change for the good.</LD>

(Commentary, May 14) deserve airing in a publication such as The

<TE>   According to his "test" for statehood, the majority of nations in
Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America ought to still be under
colonized rule and under the paternal tutelage of the highly

<HD>Eco-Tourism Could Be a Boon for Baja</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reading "Uncertain Road for Baja Plan" (May 14) left me feeling
heartsick. Last fall I had the privilege of taking a San Diego
Natural History Museum bus tour down the entire length of Baja
California. It is a beautiful, wonderful place of great diversity and
great fragility. We saw the cirio trees and the sea turtle research
station mentioned in the article, as well as gorgeous bays and
beaches and spectacular mountains. The imprint of mankind is, for the
most part, still relatively light and appropriate for what nature can
support.</LD>
<LD>   Mexican tourism agency FONATUR's plans (which our Mexican guides
were familiar with and were horrified by) are bizarre (76,000
yachts), but they will have done great damage before they are
abandoned--along with the earlier projects whose remains are strewn
around the peninsula.</LD>
<TE>   Why does the Mexican government not think in terms of promoting
Baja for eco-tourism, using Costa Rica as a model? This kind of
tourism also provides jobs for local people, but the development that
goes with it leaves a relatively light mark on the land and does not
make excessive demands on natural resources. It also has the
advantage of educating local people about the uniqueness of the place
they live in and how to preserve it. There are so few places like
Baja California left. The Escalera Nautica is a terrible idea. My
fervent best wishes to the groups on both sides of the border who are
fighting it.</TE>

<TE>   In "Locals More Hostile Than Grateful About Mexico's Plans for
Marina" (May 14), Baja residents are fired up over the possibility
that an influx of Americans might increase the population of their
peaceful little town, harm the environment and make the local beaches
"crowded and noisy" with foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the part that confuses me: Americans who speak of
restricting immigration from Mexico are derided as "racists" and
"hate-mongers," regardless of the threat that unlimited immigration
may pose to our environment and quality of life. But when Mexicans
want to keep Americans out because they don't want to share their
beachfront property with foreigners, that's not seen as racism or
hate-mongering. If this doesn't constitute a double standard, I don't
know what does.</TE>
<TE>   Why shouldn't Americans be allowed to assert the same rights as
Mexicans? If the people in Baja have the right to defend their
beaches and harbors from the possible influx of a few thousand
Americans, then surely Americans have a right to similarly defend
their cities from the ceaseless flow of millions of immigrants each
year. Fair is fair.</TE>

<LD>Re "Cardinal Mahony Kept Cleric's Abuse Secret for 16 Years," May 16:
Father Michael Steven Baker went to Cardinal Roger Mahony in 1986 and
confessed that he had been abusing minors. Msgr. Thomas Curry and the
archdiocese's lawyer, John P. McNicholas, were present at the meeting
the next day with Baker and Mahony. McNicholas asked, "Should we
phone the police?" and Mahony responded, "No, no, no."</LD>
<LD>   Years later, both Mahony and Curry cannot recall the meeting with
Baker. This must be the selective amnesia that the hierarchy of the
church has been afflicted with lately. Now the hierarchy is looking
and acting like Sgt. Schultz of "Hogan's Heroes": "I see nothing. I
know nothing."</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Mahony should be kicked out of the Catholic Church for
what he has done. It's disgusting and demoralizing, the cover-up he
and the others have committed throughout the years.</TE>
<TE>   The Catholic Church has been forever damaged by Mahony and the
others with what has happened and may never recover.</TE>

<HD>Senate OKs Letting Nurses Prescribe RU-486</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Intense debate precedes vote on the abortion
pill measure. The bill's chances of passage in the Assembly are
uncertain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The state Senate voted Thursday to allow certain nurses and other
nonphysician health-care providers to legally prescribe the
controversial abortion pill RU-486, dismissing opponents' warnings
that it would endanger the lives of California women.</LD>
<LD>   In an intense debate, supporters of SB 1301 insisted it would
apply to state licensed health professionals who already are
authorized to write prescriptions under a doctor's supervision except
for abortion purposes.</LD>
<LD>   "If you can do it for other procedures, you can do it for this,"
argued Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica), the bill's author.</LD>
<TE>   On a party-line vote, 22 Democrats voted for it and 11 Republicans
voted no.</TE>
<TE>   The bill faces an uncertain future in the Assembly. Gov. Gray
Davis has taken no position on it, a spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate action, the Senate approved and forwarded to the
Assembly a bill that would suspend the statute of limitations in
certain cases and allow victims of child sexual abuse to sue the
Roman Catholic Church or other organizations long after the assault
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The measure by Senate leader John L. Burton, a Democrat and Roman
Catholic from San Francisco, said the lawsuits could be brought
against the church or other responsible third-party defendants if
they knew or should have known of child sex abuse but did not take
reasonable steps to stop it.</TE>
<TE>   Burton said he introduced the bill (SB 1779) as the result of
recently publicized cases in which church officials knew of the
sexual abuse of boys and girls but allegedly covered it up and
reassigned the offending priests to duties where they continued to
have contact with children.</TE>
<TE>   No one opposed the bill, including major employer organizations
and the statewide California Catholic Conference, which represents
every Roman Catholic diocese in California.</TE>
<TE>   Edward E. Dolejsi, executive director of the conference, said he
doubted the church would take a position on the legislation. He said
it was uncertain it would be beneficial to "get involved in that
particular issue."</TE>
<TE>   The legislation would suspend the statute of limitations in cases
in which an adult victim wanted to sue a third-party defendant, such
as the church, but was prohibited from doing so because time had run
out.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, adults who reach age 26 cannot file. The bill would
give victims who allege they had been damaged by childhood abuse
three extra years in which to sue.</TE>
<TE>   In cases filed against a third-party defendant but dismissed
because the statute had run out, a one-year extension would be
granted so the case could be refiled.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also has no position on this bill, his spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   While the California Catholic Conference chose to watch the Burton
bill from the sidelines, it lobbied hard against passage of the bill
to allow nonphysicians to prescribe abortion pills.</TE>
<TE>   "It's irresponsible.... It puts women's health in jeopardy for the
sake of convenience and expedience. It goes way beyond the pale of
what most people would consider the responsible practice of abortion
in California," Dolejsi said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside), the Legislature's leading abortion
opponent, tried to amend out the prescription provisions, but his
effort was thwarted by majority Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "The only reason for putting this bill in is to allow non-doctors
to perform abortions," Haynes said. "We are going to be subjecting
women all over this state to serious injury and possibly death."</TE>
<TE>   He claimed that in the last few weeks, there had been four serious
injuries and two deaths to women who had taken RU-486.</TE>
<TE>   Kuehl said there was no evidence that those cases involved the
drug.</TE>
<TE>   Under the California Therapeutic Abortion Act, signed by Gov.
Ronald Reagan in the late 1960s, only physicians operating in
approved hospitals can perform an abortion.</TE>
<TE>   It is against the law for other licensed professionals, such as
nurse practitioners, physician assistants and midwives, to perform an
abortion or assist in one, Kuehl said. She said that prescribing the
RU-486 pills is a noninvasive act that comes nowhere near the
performing of a surgical abortion.</TE>

<HD>Lawsuit Claims Courts Deny Adequate Access to Disabled</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Contending that the disabled are denied adequate access to the halls
of justice, a group filed suit against Los Angeles County Thursday
for allegedly violating federal equal-access laws.</LD>
<LD>   County courthouses include inadequate handicapped parking,
dangerously steep ramps, heavy doors and inaccessible filing
counters, jury boxes and witness stands, according to the lawsuit.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, which seeks damages and declarative and injunctive
relief, was filed in U.S. District Court.</LD>
<TE>   People with mobility difficulties often become "supplicants,"
relying on the helpfulness of security guards or passersby, said
attorney Paula Pearlman of the Western Law Center for Disability
Rights, one of the legal advocacy groups working on the case.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit names seven courthouses: the downtown Los Angeles
Civil Courts building and courthouses in Santa Monica, Long Beach,
Norwalk, Pasadena, Compton and Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   "We focused on them as representatives to demonstrate how the
entire Los Angeles Superior Court system is not accessible," Pearlman
said. Of the 58 courthouses in the county, only the Childrens' Court
in Monterey Park is fully accessible to the disabled, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy County Counsel David Michaelson would not comment on the
lawsuit, which he said he had not seen. But he said the county is not
violating federal law as long as it provides viable options for
people with disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't just focus on one elevator or one path of travel in one
courthouse," Michaelson said. "You can't even focus on just one
courthouse. You have to look at the whole picture."</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiff Deborah Miles, a mental health caseworker who uses a
wheelchair and has been a litigant and witness in civil cases
downtown, said she must find a security guard to take her in a
service elevator to certain floors that the public can reach only by
stairs.</TE>
<TE>   Miles said she has always been excused from jury duty as soon as
she makes her special needs known. "I would like to someday serve on
a jury," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Co-plaintiff David G. Geffen, a lawyer paralyzed from the chest
down by a diving accident, said he has come to rely on homeless
people to help him get to court from a parking lot across the street
from the same courthouse because of a steep decline between the lot
and the building.</TE>
<TE>   "We're on a first-name basis," Geffen said of his helpers. "They
usually grab the back of my chair and keep me from wheeling out of
control as they help me cross the street," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he has tried several times to get the county to address
access issues in recent years, with no results.</TE>
<TE>   Robin Maisel, another disabled lawyer and one of the plaintiffs in
the lawsuit, said his occasional tardiness, which he blames on an
inability to travel easily inside the courthouse, exasperates judges
and other lawyers and hurts his law practice.</TE>
<TE>   "When an attorney is badly treated by the court, the client
wonders will they get a fair shake from the court because they've
chosen to use an attorney with a disability," Maisel said.</TE>

<HD>Alec Campbell, 103; in Battle at Gallipoli</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>SYDNEY, Australia</DL>
<LD>Alec Campbell, the last Australian known to have fought in the bloody
World War I Gallipoli campaign--and possibly the last from any
nation--died Thursday. He was 103.</LD>
<LD>   Campbell died at a nursing home in the southern island state of
Tasmania after a short illness, his family said. His wife, Kath, was
at his side.</LD>
<LD>   Although he was in a wheelchair, his last public appearance was on
April 25, when he led the annual parade to commemorate the
anniversary of the Turkish campaign.</LD>
<TE>   "He was the last of the original Anzacs, and our last living link
with that Anzac tradition," said lawmaker Simon Crean, who announced
Campbell's death in Parliament. "We thank him, we honor him, and our
condolences go to his family."</TE>
<TE>   Anzacs was the name given to members of the Australia-New Zealand
Army Corps that fought in World War I. The Anzac volunteers formed
the backbone of a 200,000-member British-led army that landed at
Gallipoli in a failed attempt to capture Istanbul and knock the
German-allied Ottoman Empire out of the war.</TE>
<TE>   Their bravery in battle helped the young Australian nation forge a
confident image for itself.</TE>
<TE>   Australian Prime Minister John Howard paid tribute to Campbell and
said his family would be offered a state funeral.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only is he the last Australian Anzac, he is also the last
known person anywhere in the world who served in that extraordinarily
tragic campaign," Howard told Parliament.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Launceston, Tasmania, Campbell was working as an insurance
clerk when he lied about his age and enlisted at the age of 16.</TE>
<TE>   Nicknamed "The Kid," he spent a month fighting in the brutal
campaign in Turkey. He arrived in Gallipoli in November 1915, and by
Dec. 20 he was gone in the grand evacuation that ended the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   For about six weeks, Campbell braved heavy fire to carry ammo and
water from the boats to trenches on the front lines before he became
ill and was evacuated, first to Egypt and then home.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Campbell became a builder, served as a senior
public servant and gained an economics degree in his 50s. He sailed
in the grueling Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race six times and fathered
the last of his nine children at the age of 69.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, he rarely spoke of Gallipoli, but when he did he
recalled an "incredible hail of bullets" on landing on the beach.</TE>
<TE>   "People were always getting hit," he remembered. He said he did
not kill a single Turkish fighter.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell is survived by his second wife, nine children, 33
grandchildren, 35 great-grandchildren and two
great-great-grandchildren.</TE>

<LD>The three combatants meet at the designated location in La Crescenta
at exactly 8:15 a.m. One straddles a bicycle. Another clutches a bus
schedule, and a third grips the keys to a Saab turbo.</LD>
<LD>   They synchronize their watches, wish each other good luck and
begin The Race.</LD>
<LD>   To commemorate National Bike to Work Day, three reporters launched
an admittedly unscientific contest Thursday to see how a bicycle
measures up against the two most popular modes of transportation in
Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   The race started at the height of rush hour at the bicyclist's La
Crescenta home. It ended when all three commuters walked into The
Times building in downtown Los Angeles, 14.3 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Such a challenge might sound laughable in any other city, but in a
region that suffers from the nation's most congested freeways, a
bicyclist stands a chance.</TE>
<TE>   Bicycling has yet to catch on big in Los Angeles County. Only 2.4%
of all trips are made on a bike.</TE>
<TE>   Commuters still prefer cars, as demonstrated by recent census
figures that show about 70% of commuters in the county drive alone to
work.</TE>
<TE>   But enthusiasts hope bicycling will gain appeal as congestion
grows and driving times increase. Since 1990, the average commute
times jumped three minutes, to 28 minutes, one way.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you realize how many cars we would eliminate from the roads
and how much cleaner the air would be if more people rode bikes?"
asked Alex Baum, chairman of the Los Angeles city bicycle advisory
committee.</TE>
<TE>   The following are the comments, kept on tape recorders and note
pads, of our three challengers:</TE>
<TE>   8:15 a.m.  The bicyclist is already in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Some jerk in a gray Volvo is about to make a U-turn across my
path. I let out a shrill whistle. He stops. I zip past. Not a good
omen. I pick up speed. I'm doing 36 mph, officially breaking the
residential speed limit.</TE>
<TE>   The motorist is also cruising along.</TE>
<TE>   There were six lights to get to the Glendale Freeway and I made
five of them. Traffic along Foothill Boulevard is running at about 40
mph--no stopping, no brake lights, no problems. So far, this is a
holiday.</TE>
<TE>   The bus rider is still walking to the bus stop.</TE>
<TE>   I can't remember the last time I rode a bus to work. But I
remember that it did not fill me with awe and admiration for the
local public transit system.</TE>
<TE>   8:24 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The Glendale Beeline 3 bus picks up the bus rider.</TE>
<TE>   The bus was two minutes behind schedule. Not bad. The fare: 75
cents with a transfer.</TE>
<TE>   The bicyclist begins to make good time--for a while.</TE>
<TE>   I check my bicycle computer at Wabasso Avenue. I'm doing 28 mph
with a 158 heart rate, on flat to mildly descending terrain. Verdugo
Road merges with La Canada Boulevard by Glendale Community College.
It's madness--a solid mass of cars. I cross to the right shoulder,
then contemplate crossing left once again. The driver of a maroon van
sees me signal and actually lets me change lanes.</TE>
<TE>   The motorist hits traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Just past Mountain Avenue, I get my first glimpse of dreaded brake
lights, where the Ventura Freeway intersects the Foothill Freeway.
Traffic is gearing down fast; all I can see for about three-fourths
of a mile ahead is red brake lights.</TE>
<TE>   8:34 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The bus rider gets off for his first transfer.</TE>
<TE>   The Beeline got me to Ocean View and Honolulu Avenue, one minute
behind schedule. I wonder if I have enough time to run to the bakery
across the street for a muffin. Too late. My connection, Metro bus
91, arrives at 8:43 a.m., right on time.</TE>
<TE>   The motorist wonders if he should get off the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Oh-oh. I may have made a wrong choice here as I see a yellow,
blinking Caltrans light on the right up ahead. Why does Caltrans
deploy these things at the height of rush hour? This is not the first
time I've had that thought.</TE>
<TE>   8:45 a.m. The bicyclist faces more trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown in sight. North of Chinatown, though, a blue Honda cuts
in front of me. No signal. He turns left on Bishops Road. No signal
again. In mid-Chinatown, a black Thunderbird moves into my lane to
avoid a parked car. My right thigh and his left rear quarter panel
nearly touch. He beeps. I give him The Look.</TE>
<TE>   8:47 a.m. The motorist spots the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   I stop for the offramp light at Broadway and notice my first
bicyclist. A block farther--at Spring Street--I see 25 or more
cyclists celebrating the day. They're happier than I am, but not by
much.</TE>
<TE>   The bus rider is annoyed by the number of stops on his route.</TE>
<TE>   The bell that passengers ring to request a stop begins to sound
like a fire alarm. I counted 26 stops in less than 14 miles. I
imagine that my bus is in the movie "Speed" and Sandra Bullock has to
keep the bus above 50 mph or we will all die. Step on the gas, Sandy!</TE>
<TE>   8:52 a.m.  The bicyclist is heading for the home stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Losing time now. It's taken me five minutes to go through
Chinatown. Down Broadway, I cheat and use the turn lane to make the
light at First Street. I turn right on Spring Street and onto the
sidewalk to The Times building.</TE>
<TE>   I check the stopwatch: 37 minutes, 39 seconds. Average speed: 22.5
mph.</TE>
<TE>   The bicyclist wins.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the motorist pulls into The Times garage.</TE>
<TE>   I turn off the engine at my parking stall. Another minute and I'm
in the building--arrived!--at 8:53 a.m. That's 38 minutes
door-to-door. Not bad at prime time.</TE>
<TE>   The bus rider is somewhere in Glassell Park.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the incessant stops, the ride is tolerable. The bus is
clean. Everyone has a seat, and I detect no unbearable odors or
noises.</TE>
<TE>   9:40 a.m. The bus rider gets to The Times building.</TE>
<TE>   The trip took one hour and 25 minutes. Average speed: 10 mph.
Sandra Bullock would have made it in 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Editors note: Getting to work was the easy part. The biggest
challenge came at 6 p.m. when the cyclist again donned his riding
outfit and prepared to make the return trip--all uphill.</TE>

<LD>The bodyguard accused of helping Robert Blake allegedly plan his
wife's slaying last year asked a judge Thursday to allow him to use a
lawyer being paid by the actor.</LD>
<LD>   Earle Caldwell, charged with conspiracy in the shooting death of
Bonny Lee Bakley on May 4, 2001, said in court documents that
attorney Arna H. Zlotnik can represent him fairly regardless of who
is paying her.</LD>
<LD>   Blake is suspected in the fatal shooting of the 44-year-old Bakley
near a Studio City restaurant.</LD>
<TE>   "I genuinely believe that Ms. Zlotnik serves my interests despite
her source of fees," he said in the one-page court declaration.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Attys. Gregory A. Dohi and Patrick
R. Dixon asked a judge earlier this month to remove Zlotnik from the
murder case, saying she cannot ethically represent Caldwell while
being paid by Blake.</TE>
<TE>   Zlotnik filed her opposition in court, saying Caldwell's
"confidence in his lawyer is vital to the defense. His right to
decide for himself who best can conduct the case must be respected."</TE>
<TE>   Blake attorney Harland W. Braun also opposed the prosecution's
motion, accusing them in court documents of trying to "control the
defense."</TE>
<TE>   Braun said in a motion that efforts to disqualify Zlotnik are part
of the prosecution's strategy to strengthen an otherwise weak case
against Blake.</TE>
<TE>   He accused prosecutors of trying to "squeeze" testimony from
Caldwell. Their strategy, he said, was to "isolate [Caldwell] from
his lawyer" and "undermine his legal representation."</TE>
<TE>   Blake and Caldwell were arrested last month.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, 68, was charged with murder, soliciting two stuntmen from
his 1970s television series "Baretta" to kill his wife and conspiracy
to commit murder. He is being held without bail at Men's Central Jail
in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell, 46, was charged with conspiracy and was released from
the Twin Towers Correctional Facility earlier this month, after Blake
posted $1-million bail.</TE>
<TE>   In his motion, Braun contends Caldwell's arrest was without
probable cause, and was an attempt by authorities to intimidate him
into becoming a prosecution witness.</TE>
<TE>   Without eyewitnesses and little physical evidence, Braun said
prosecutors' "only hope" was to turn Caldwell against Blake.</TE>
<TE>   Braun also said that former Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks, who retired recently after being denied a second term,
pressured Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley to arrest Blake in an attempt to
keep his job.</TE>
<TE>   Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office,
said Blake's arrest had nothing to do with pressure from Parks and
called Braun's allegations "just patently preposterous."</TE>
<TE>   In another motion, prosecutors asked Los Angeles County Superior
Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash to bar Braun from hiring William C. Jordan,
a private investigator that prosecutors say may be a witness against
Blake.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said the motion lacks a legal basis. He said he hired
Jordan, a former homicide detective, to consult with him on the Blake
case, and denied that the work would influence Jordan's court
testimony.</TE>
<TE>   He made another plea to have bail set for Blake, who faces life in
prison without parole. Nash denied a similar request earlier this
month.</TE>
<TE>   Nash is expected to consider the motions at a hearing Monday in
the Van Nuys courthouse.</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District's deficit has grown by nearly
$14 million because of state budget cuts, the district's chief
financial officer reported Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The district now must slash about $440 million from its
$5.2-billion general fund to balance its books this year.</LD>
<LD>   The school board already has trimmed $384.6 million by increasing
class sizes in most grades and reducing funding for counselors,
nurses and assistant principals, among other cuts.</LD>
<TE>   The board had anticipated $42 million in additional cuts, but that
figure grew to $56 million after Gov. Gray Davis released his revised
state budget this week.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles is losing millions of dollars because 10% of its parking
meters don't work, according to an audit by City Controller Laura
Chick released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The meters are capable of functioning at a 2% failure rate, but
lack of timely maintenance increased the number of broken meters
fivefold. Cutting the number of inoperable meters by half would
generate $1 million for city coffers annually. The analysis also
showed that 96% of the vehicles parked at expired meters were not
cited, creating more lost revenue.</LD>
<LD>   "With an ever-tightening budget, I know that we could put those
funds to good use for our communities and neighborhoods," Chick wrote
in a letter to Mayor James K. Hahn.</LD>

<HD>Analyst Calls Budget Credible</HD>
<DH>Finance: She says Davis' plan would omit reserve in bid to
cut $23.6-billion deficit. State may face future shortfalls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>California will end the next fiscal year without a reserve and will
continue to face the prospect of annual shortfalls of $7 billion or
more under Gov. Gray Davis' budget proposal, according to a
nonpartisan state analyst.</LD>
<LD>   Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill, who advises lawmakers on
budget and policy matters, described Davis' revised 2002-03 budget as
a credible plan to dig the state out of a $23.6-billion shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   Davis outlined the $98.9-billion plan this week, relying on deep
spending cuts, tax hikes, borrowing and other measures to get the
state out of the red. The plan also includes a $516-million reserve.</LD>
<TE>   But Hill warned Thursday that the Davis administration overstated
revenue in the last fiscal year by $600 million because of an
accounting change it failed to make. Consequently, she said, that
shortage will carry forward and California is on track to end the
upcoming budget year without a rainy-day account.</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said the administration stands by
the governor's revised budget and maintained revenue would be
sufficient to cover the reserve.</TE>
<TE>   Even after Davis and lawmakers erase the current $23.6-billion
shortfall, Hill predicted that a budget gap of at least $7 billion
will confront California in the 2003-04 fiscal year and perhaps
beyond.</TE>
<TE>   She said one reason that spending will continue to outpace revenue
in California is the governor's proposal to delay paying local
governments for carrying out a variety of state laws. The change will
free up money to solve the state's current fiscal woes but is
expected to put pressure on the general fund in future years.</TE>
<TE>   The imbalance between expenses and revenues, Hill warned, could be
much larger than the $7-billion figure, which she initially floated
in February.</TE>
<TE>   Hill also took issue with the governor's expectation of about $1
billion more in funding from the federal government to help close the
$23.6-billion shortfall. So far, little of the money Davis is
counting on has come through.</TE>

<HD>Port of L.A. Covers Its Petroleum Coke</HD>
<DH>Health: The facility is storing the potentially
carcinogenic material in a $7.5-million barn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years of public outcry, lawsuits and environmental studies,
politicians and officials at the Port of Los Angeles announced
Thursday that all petroleum coke piles at the port have been covered.</LD>
<LD>   Assemblyman Alan Lowenthal (D-Long Beach) and representatives of
the South Coast Air Quality Management District and the Los Angeles
Export Terminal held a news conference Thursday to announce the
completion of an enormous storage barn on Terminal Island that will
house the potentially carcinogenic petroleum coke piles.</LD>
<LD>   The piles are now covered by the $7.5-million storage barn, which
is 105 feet tall and 240 feet wide. The barn was built by the export
terminal, which handles about half of the 5 million tons of coke
shipped out of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach every year.</LD>
<TE>   Petroleum coke, a coal-like byproduct of the oil refining process,
is exported to Asia for use as an industrial fuel. If inhaled in
sufficient quantities, the material can cause cancer, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd put it in these huge piles ... and it would blow on the
community," Lowenthal said. When he first got elected to the Long
Beach City Council in 1992, residents near the port complained to him
about the dust on their windows and boats, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Studies have shown a link between elevated levels of coke dust in
the air and the deaths of people with respiratory illness and heart
disease. An early study in Long Beach showed that coke dust comprised
12% to 15% of air pollutants.</TE>
<TE>   "We ship out some of the worst stuff in the world," Lowenthal
said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Los Angeles Export Terminal had argued that
installing roofs over the coke piles would be too costly, and they
said that dust was being controlled by sprinklers and other devices.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the terminal began building two $20-million concrete
domes covering 75,000 tons of coke each, said Jim Holland, vice
president of operations.</TE>
<TE>   Subsequent regulations by the AQMD mandated full enclosure of the
coke piles awaiting shipment that, at that point, were not covered.</TE>
<TE>   The new rules required equipment and procedural changes by January
2004 to facilities and trucks that handle petroleum coke. A bill
introduced by Lowenthal and signed by Gov. Gray Davis two years ago
advanced the deadline to next month.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Export Terminal "has always wanted to work with
the community," said Gerald Swan, the terminal's president. "We are
committed to a clean environment, and I hope that the vast sums of
money we have spent will render that very end."</TE>
<TE>   The Port of Long Beach has until Jan. 1, 2004, to cover parts of
its antiquated loading machinery.</TE>

<HD>Trial Begins for Pair in Murder of Retired Teacher</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A teenager will testify that he watched a friend rob a retired
teacher of $20 in her Compton home and then fatally shoot her in the
head, execution style, jurors were told Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Ollie Wayne Hawkins Jr., 16, described as a model student and
promising football star, will testify that the only mistake he made
was spending the day with the friend.</LD>
<LD>   On July 21, 2001, 68-year-old Kathryn Dawson was found dead of a
single gunshot wound in the head. Hawkins and Joe Patrick Gaines were
arrested after neighbors recognized them from sketches released by
the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<TE>   "[Hawkins] is a very passive type of person," said his attorney,
Marvin L. Part. "The only problem my client has was that his family
lived down the street from Gaines."</TE>
<TE>   Part said his client, a Dominguez High School athlete who had been
recruited by college football coaches, is different from Gaines, who
he said is the killer.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins had never been a member of a gang and had a clean criminal
record, Part said. Gaines, he told jurors, was a member of the
Neighborhood 127 Crips gang and was on probation.</TE>
<TE>   The day Dawson was murdered, the two teenagers were walking down
their street when Gaines asked Hawkins to hold his gun, Part said.
"He did something he shouldn't have done: He put the gun in his
pocket," the attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins said Gaines forced Dawson to lie down with a pillow over
her head and then shot her, Part said. "[Gaines] executed her ... for
a lousy 20 bucks," Part told jurors in Compton Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Gaines' attorney, Earl C. Broady, waived an opening statement.</TE>
<TE>   Gaines listened to Deputy Dist. Atty. Danette Meyers tell jurors
that the prosecution's case will rely on neighbors who will testify
that they saw the two teenagers at Dawson's doorstep.</TE>
<TE>   One of Gaines' friends, convicted felon Leo Armor, will testify
that he picked up the two defendants on the day of the killing and
took them to Gaines' house, Meyers said. Armor will tell jurors that
he saw Gaines bury the gun in his backyard, and that Gaines told him:
"I just popped the [woman]," she added.</TE>
<TE>   The trial is expected to last about two weeks. If convicted,
Hawkins and Gaines face life in prison without the possibility of
parole.</TE>
<TE>   "It's overwhelming to listen to somebody describe what happened,"
said Yolanda Spooney, Dawson's daughter. She said it was painful to
look at Gaines.</TE>
<TE>   Spooney said her mother, a substitute teacher for the Los Angeles
Unified School District who worked mostly in Watts, never opened her
door to strangers.</TE>

<HD>Ralph Dills, 92; Longtime Lawmaker</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ralph C. Dills, a Texas sharecropper's son who became the longest
serving California legislator, died Thursday in a nursing home in the
Northern California community of Rocklin. He was 92.</LD>
<LD>   His son, Gregory Dills, said the cause of death was old age.</LD>
<LD>   "My father simply stopped breathing while sleeping, at 5:30a.m.,"
he said.</LD>
<TE>   A Democrat, Ralph Dills served Gardena, Compton and Lawndale
throughout most of his political career.</TE>
<TE>   He served in the Assembly for 11 years and in the state Senate for
32 years.</TE>
<TE>   His accomplishments included writing the legislation that created
Cal State Long Beach, and El Camino College, and facilitating the
creation of the UCLA Law School.</TE>
<TE>   He also sponsored bills that instituted driver's education in high
school and advanced collective bargaining for teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Popular with the Japanese American community in Gardena, he was
one of just two Capitol lawmakers to oppose the internment of
Japanese Americans in World War II.</TE>
<TE>   He often told colleagues of his friendship with a community
member, Joe Kubota, who had once loaned him money to attend USC.</TE>
<TE>   The morning in 1942 that Japanese Americans were assembled for
transport to Manzanar, an internment camp in the Owens Valley, Dills
said, he drove Kubota to the assembly point at the Santa Anita
racetrack.</TE>
<TE>   Forty years later, Dills successfully wrote legislation, signed by
then-Gov. Jerry Brown, that gave partial reparations to internees.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Rosston, Texas, Dills moved to California with his parents
and eight siblings when he was 15.</TE>
<TE>   He graduated from Gardena High School in 1927 and earned a
bachelor's degree from UCLA, a master's degree from USC, and law
degrees from Loyola University and the University of the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   He was first elected to the Assembly in 1939. After spending 11
years there, he was a municipal judge in Compton for 14 years before
returning to the Legislature in 1966 as a state senator. He retired
in 1998 because of term limits.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, a victim of redistricting, he still managed to win in a
new district outside his core area, using the slogan, "Too old to
quit."</TE>
<TE>   An old-fashioned politician, Dills often was accused of catering
to special interests, such as the oil industry.</TE>
<TE>   He was once investigated by the FBI for vote-buying but was not
charged.</TE>
<TE>   And he usually spent most of his time at his 50-acre ranch in
Loomis, in Placer County, rather than in his home district in
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he repeatedly proved his political durability.</TE>
<TE>   When Robert Pauley, son of oil magnate Edwin W. Pauley, moved into
Dills' Gardena district in 1974, he thought that, with ample money,
he could defeat Dills in the Democratic primary.</TE>
<TE>   But when the votes were counted, Dills had 56% and Pauley ran
third with 21%. Another candidate got 23%.</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of the toughest men in the Legislature," Pauley said
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "He had support from the unions like none other," Pauley said.
"Our brochures had him in a black box, like he was deceased. But he
beat me handsomely. He had an organization I underestimated."</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, another Dills primary opponent, life insurance
underwriter Mickey Carson, sent a photographer to Dills' ranch to get
pictures of his "palatial" lifestyle outside the district.</TE>
<TE>   "Call it a mansion, if you want," he said. "All the newspaper
reporters seem to be interested in is where I sleep."</TE>
<TE>   Conservationists accused Dills in 1994 of having the worst
environmental record in the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   The senator acknowledged, "They were right. I did have the worst
record."</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, in his old district, "I had oil, oil, oil. Tideland
oil. Oil all over the joint. [And] I represented my district."</TE>
<TE>   In his new district, which included beach cities north to Venice,
Dills switched to a pro-environmentalist position.</TE>
<TE>   The League of Conservation Voters, which had endorsed an opponent
in the 1994 race, gave him a perfect rating for 1995-96.</TE>
<TE>   "I moved over to the beaches ... where they don't like oil," Dills
said.</TE>
<TE>   "They want nice, clean fresh air and water.... [Now], I'm 100%
with the environment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dills is survived by his daughter, Wendy Lewellen; two sons,
Gregory and Leighton; and three grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The family asked that donations in his memory be made to any
Masonic order.</TE>
<TE>   They said Dills was a 33rd Degree mason, in the Scottish and York
Rites.</TE>

<HD>DJ Pleads Guilty to Lewd Acts</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A radio personality pleaded guilty Thursday to two counts of
committing a lewd act upon a child after being charged with a series
of alleged sexual assaults on two 14-year-old girls he met through
his show.</LD>
<LD>   Firmo Martin Rosetti, known as morning host Hector Rocksetti on
Century City-based KLYY-FM (107.1), faces a maximum of three years
and eight months in state prison when he is sentenced June 13 by
Burbank Superior Court Judge Chesley McKay.</LD>
<LD>   Rosetti, 38, who allegedly offered to help one of the victims with
a music career, originally was charged with two dozen felony counts
of child molestation, rape and oral copulation. He would have faced
up to 24 years in prison if convicted on all counts.</LD>
<TE>   But Burbank Police Lt. Tim Stehr said authorities offered Rosetti
the plea agreement to keep the girls from having to testify in court.</TE>
<TE>   "Although the prison time may appear to be small compared to what
he could have gotten, we have to take into account the emotional
distress that would have resulted if the victims testified," Stehr
said.</TE>
<TE>   Police and prosecutors alleged that Rosetti picked up one of the
teenagers at her Long Beach home and told her he was taking her to a
recording session.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, police said, he had sex with her in his car and again at
his apartment in the 1500 block of Catalina Street in Burbank. Five
months later, the girl said, he assaulted her again in his apartment,
according to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   A week after Rosetti's arrest in February, relatives of a girl
from the San Gabriel Valley contacted authorities. Police said the
girl told them she and Rosetti had five sexual encounters from
September to January and that he would take her to his apartment
after picking her up near her school.</TE>
<TE>   Rosetti's lawyer could not be reached for comment Thursday.
Rosetti previously had denied engaging in any improper conduct with
either girl.</TE>

<LD>KCAL-TV Channel 9 news anchor Jerry Dunphy, whose trademark line
"From the desert to the sea to all of Southern California" has been a
fixture of local TV news for more than four decades, remained
hospitalized Thursday after suffering a heart attack.</LD>
<LD>   Dunphy reportedly collapsed outside his Wilshire Boulevard
condominium Wednesday morning and was revived by paramedics.
Executives at KCAL declined to disclose his condition or where he is
hospitalized.</LD>
<LD>   Afternoon anchor Sylvia Lopez announced Dunphy's hospitalization
at the beginning of the 4 p.m. newscast.</LD>
<TE>   "We begin tonight with a story that we would rather not have to
report," she said before reading a statement from Dunphy's family.</TE>

<HD>Man Convicted in Shooting Death of Northridge Jeweler</HD>
<DH>Courts: Slaying occurred during a midday robberty attempt
in December 2000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 29-year-old man was convicted Thursday of first-degree murder in
the shooting death of a jewelry store owner during a botched robbery
attempt in Northridge.</LD>
<LD>   Gaik Papazyan faces 50 years to life in prison for the killing of
jeweler Karo Zeytounyan, 44, of Diamond Bar in December 2000. He is
scheduled to be sentenced June 24 in San Fernando Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   The verdict, which jurors reached after two hours of deliberation,
caused emotional outbursts in the courtroom, which was filled with
about 20 members of Zeytounyan's family and about a dozen Papazyan
relatives.</LD>
<TE>   The two families had to be escorted out through separate exits by
sheriff's deputies.</TE>
<TE>   "We are glad that justice was served," said Zeytounyan's sister,
Liz Tokatlian, 34, of Los Angeles. "But this does not make things
better. Not by a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Zeytounyan's wife, Louiza, said she still does not feel a sense of
closure.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope the other ones involved are caught to face the same
justice," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Papazyan and possibly two others robbed Zeytounyan's Sunrise
Jewelry store on Dec. 7, 2000, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robin Allen.</TE>
<TE>   During the midday incident in the 8900 block of Tampa Avenue,
Papazyan shot Zeytounyan four times with a handgun and left jewelry
scattered on the floor around him, Allen said.</TE>
<TE>   Police described the incident as "a robbery gone wrong," but Allen
argued that Papazyan's intention was to kill Zeytounyan because he
came into the store armed with two loaded handguns and a silencer.</TE>
<TE>   Papazyan was arrested a few blocks away after someone followed him
and notified police. No other arrests have been made, Allen said.</TE>
<TE>   Zeytounyan, a native of Armenia, was the father of two boys ages
12 and 7 and owned a second shop in North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Papazyan's attorney said he plans to appeal.</TE>

<HD>Gold Line Given the Go-Ahead</HD>
<DH>Transit: Pasadena-L.A. light-rail project stays on track
after PUC supports design of crossings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The state Public Utilities Commission narrowly approved the design of
the light-rail line already under construction between Los Angeles
and Pasadena, calling for few changes other than the imposition of
speed and sound reductions.</LD>
<LD>   The commission--which oversees rail safety in the state--voted
3-to-2 Thursday in favor of the current plans for the railway, giving
a green light for street-level crossings that had been the subject of
concern among some who live along the nearly 14-mile route.</LD>
<LD>   "Significant public benefit will result in timely project
completion," said Commissioner Henry Duque, who touted the line as a
tool to improve air quality, boost job access and reduce auto
accidents. Trains mixing with cars and pedestrians along the route,
he said, "will be safe."</LD>
<TE>   Duque's plan won out over another blueprint, which called for a
putting the trains in long trenches at several intersections. That
plan would have been a huge blow to transit officials because it
could have cost close to $100 million and possibly have pushed the
railway's proposed July 2003 start date back a decade.</TE>
<TE>   During its deliberations, the commission focused mostly on busy
Del Mar Boulevard, just south of Pasadena's Old Town, where trains
will travel through an apartment complex that will limit sight lines
for train operators. Duque's plan calls on trains, which will run up
to 250 times daily, to not exceed 20 mph at the crossing. His plan
asks the PUC's rail safety staff to monitor the crossing and slow the
trains further if there are accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Commission President Loretta Lynch strongly disagreed, saying she
was troubled by Del Mar Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch was not convinced that safety measures at Del Mar--including
gates to keep cars from the tracks--would be adequate. She criticized
the plan to have PUC staff monitor, and possibly alter, train
speeds--moves likely to be made only after bad accidents.</TE>
<TE>   "By then," said Lynch, pushing for the train to be put into a
trench at Del Mar, "it would be too late."</TE>
<TE>   Siding with Lynch was Commissioner Carl Wood.</TE>
<TE>   Joining Duque were Commissioners Michael Peevey, a Pasadena-area
resident, and Geoffrey Brown. Before the vote, observers close to the
commission said they were unsure what would happen, but some that
speculated Brown would provide the swing vote.</TE>
<TE>   A San Francisco resident, Brown said the line had the backing of
scores of residents and almost every major politician from the Los
Angeles and Pasadena area. He noted that light-rail trains in his
city often run on bustling streets. "Compared to other lines that I
know, this will be a safe operation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most relieved Thursday was Rick Thorpe, chief executive of
the Los Angeles to Pasadena Metro Construction Authority, the agency
created in 1998 to build the line after a then-struggling MTA had
spent tens of millions of dollars planning it.</TE>
<TE>   Thorpe had been criticized for building before being granted
approval by the PUC, a move he argues he was forced into since he was
told to build as fast as possible on a tight budget of $451 million.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm completely relieved," he said. "I hate 3-2 votes, but in the
end, we prevailed and that's all that matters."</TE>
<TE>   Thorpe said construction at the crossings would begin as soon as
possible and added that the half-finished railway is about three
months behind schedule.</TE>
<TE>   A small group of citizens who had fought for years to put the
railway in trenches through Pasadena took the news hard. "It is a
turning point in the life of Pasadena," said Karen Cutts. "Its future
will go in the wrong direction."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Hoffman, a lawyer who has represented his neighbors in the
Mt. Washington area, said said most of his clients were willing to
accept a compromise floated by some PUC officials to limit train
speeds and reduce the use of horns. The commission voted for those
changes.</TE>
<TE>   "We are really pleased with the result, and proud of it," he said.
"We feel like we've won."</TE>

<HD>Jewish Activists See Signs of Hate</HD>
<DH>Bias: Concerns mount after a disturbance between
pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian groups at San Francisco State.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN and JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Jewish campus and community activists are expressing outrage over a
recent confrontation between pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian
demonstrators at San Francisco State University, saying the incident
reflects growing hostility toward Jewish causes there and on other
U.S. campuses.</LD>
<LD>   Concerns among Jewish activists also have been fueled by tensions
at UC Berkeley, including a controversy over a planned
pro-Palestinian English course. The class description referred to
"the brutal Israeli military occupation of Palestine," and it
initially urged "conservative thinkers" to avoid the class.</LD>
<LD>   Jonathan Bernstein, the San Francisco-based regional director of
the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights organization, said
rallies in the Bay Area protesting  the Israeli government frequently
have turned into expressions of hatred toward Jews.</LD>
<TE>   At San Francisco State, police were called to escort participants
to safety at a pro-Israel peace rally after they were confronted by
counterdemonstrators.</TE>
<TE>   No injuries were reported, and participants offer conflicting
accounts of the face-off. Bernstein, without naming specific groups,
said organizers of anti-Israel demonstrations "aren't speaking out
when it turns anti-Semitic."</TE>
<TE>   "You go to a lot of these demonstrations in San Francisco,
Berkeley and elsewhere and you see blatant hate, and no one is
forcing the demonstrators to remove their signs or stop saying things
like 'Hitler was right,'" Bernstein said.</TE>
<TE>   He also cited what he called an anti-Jewish "blood libel" on
fliers circulated for a pro-Palestinian rally at San Francisco State
that depicted a dead Palestinian child "slaughtered according to
Jewish rites under American license."</TE>
<TE>   Tensions between pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian groups have
simmered on campuses around the country this spring, fueled in part
by the continuing bloodshed in the Middle East. But the disturbance
at San Francisco State on May 7--and an impassioned, widely
distributed e-mail about the situation from the director of the
campus' Jewish Studies Program, Laurie Zoloth--spurred widespread
concerns among Jewish activists and other community leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, there are tensions," said Souleiman Ghali, president of the
Islamic Society of San Francisco. "People think the Palestinian
versus Israeli struggle has a place here."</TE>
<TE>   At San Francisco State, campus officials say they are reviewing a
videotape of the rally and interviewing students to determine whether
anyone should be criminally prosecuted, or disciplined.</TE>
<TE>   According to San Francisco State officials, what came before the
confrontation was a rally by about 350 pro-Israel students sponsored
by the Jewish campus organization Hillel and a nearby
counterdemonstration by roughly 75 pro-Palestinian students. The
situation, university officials said, grew uglier after demonstrators
started to disperse. They said each side hurled insults at the other,
and the videotape shows a male student stomping on an Israeli flag.</TE>
<TE>   Participants, however, offered conflicting accounts. Basil Awwad,
an officer with the General Union of Palestinian Students, which
organized the counterdemonstration, said Jewish students were the
first to hurl insults.</TE>
<TE>   "We were being called all kinds of racist slurs," said Awwad, as
he stood outside the group's office in the Cesar Chavez Student
Union.</TE>
<TE>   He added, "As usual, the Palestinians were made out to be the
aggressor, and that's just not true."</TE>
<TE>   Asif Hai, a member of the Muslim Student Union, said the face-off
was healthy even if it produced tensions. "Maybe students on this
campus are more awake to the reality of what's going on in the
world," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Seth Brysk, executive director for the San Francisco chapter of
Hillel, countered that Jewish students were backed against a wall by
the counterdemonstrators, prompting the need for the police escort.
Still, he said, his group has continued to reach out to Arab students
on campus.</TE>
<TE>   Zoloth, in her e-mail, issued a plea for advice on counseling
Jewish students on a campus that she said "has become a venue for
hate speech and anti-Semitism."</TE>
<TE>   Robert A. Corrigan, president of San Francisco State, said he has
received close to 1,000 e-mails about the incident, mainly from Jews.</TE>
<TE>   At Berkeley, where 41 students and 38 others were arrested last
month after pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied Wheeler Hall, a
new controversy emerged.</TE>
<TE>   It was triggered by a course description for a class being offered
this fall titled "The Politics and Poetics of Palestinian
Resistance."</TE>
<TE>   The description posted on the Internet said, in part, "The brutal
Israeli military occupation of Palestine, an occupation that has been
ongoing since 1948, has systematically displaced, killed and maimed
millions of Palestinian people." The description added, "This class
takes as its starting point the right of Palestinians to fight for
their own self-determination. Conservative thinkers are encouraged to
seek other sections."</TE>
<TE>   After the description was brought to the attention of Berkeley
administrators, the last sentence was removed. Officials said they
would monitor the class to ensure that all students were free to
express their views.</TE>
<TE>   Snehal Shingavi, 26, the UC Berkeley graduate student teaching the
course and a co-founder of the campus group Students for Justice in
Palestine, said that the "conservative thinkers" sentence was poor
judgment on his part. But, he said, "The controversy over my class
has little to do with the line, it has more to do with the content of
the course.... There is an attempt to silence the teaching of this
kind of material at the university level."</TE>

<HD>Health Coverage in O.C. Growing, Survey Finds</HD>
<DH>Medicine: A county official credits greater enrollment in
public programs. Still, about 69,000 children lack insurance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More Orange County residents had health care coverage in 2001 than in
1998, with the greatest improvement among Latino children, a new
study shows.</LD>
<LD>   The study was the second by the Orange County Health Needs
Assessment, and it compared results from the first survey in 1998
with one in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The study showed that while 240,000 adults--or 11.8%--still have
no health care coverage, the figure has dropped 31% since the 1998
report. The increase in coverage is attributed to more people
enrolling in the growing number of publicly supported insurance
programs, said Dr. Mark Horton, the county's public health officer.</LD>
<TE>   About 69,000 Orange County children still lack coverage. Nearly
half of those are Latino youngsters, but the number lacking coverage
has dropped 8.4% from 1998. In addition, 8% of children younger than
6 are without coverage.</TE>
<TE>   The survey found that 20% of households with incomes less than
$25,000 annually do not have health care coverage for their children</TE>
<TE>   Still, Horton said, the assessment shows "we've made significant
progress over the last three years."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the survey found that the number of people
insured through their jobs has declined 3%.</TE>
<TE>   The assessment surveyed 5,000 households by phone over the spring,
summer and early fall of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Health Needs Assessment is a nonprofit project
funded mainly by hospitals, health care systems and the county's
Health Care Agency.</TE>
<TE>   The survey also found that the birth rate for girls and women 15
to 19 has dropped 25%, reflecting similar figures across the country.
The number of infant deaths also went down, by 17.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the good news about access to health care, the survey
found that Orange County residents are not as healthy as people
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   County death rates for heart disease, stroke and cancer were
somewhat higher than the state's as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   For coronary heart disease, the county's death rate was 228.1 per
100,000 people versus a statewide average of 201.5 per 100,000.
Stroke death rates were 67.7 compared to 63.3 per 100,000. Cancer
death rates were 183.7 versus 179.8 per 100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Exercise and weight may play a factor, the survey suggested.</TE>
<TE>   Among adults 65 and older, 41% said they were overweight.</TE>
<TE>   Half of respondents surveyed said their children get less than the
half-hour of daily exercise recommended by the Centers for Disease
Control.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, parents reported that their children eat fast food an
average of 21/2 times a week. A full 25% of those parents reported
their children eat fast food four to seven times a week.</TE>

<HD>Project to Revitalize Harbor Puts Herons Out on Limb,
Critics Say</HD>
<DH>Development: Ventura County officials want a boating
facility, but neighbors say it would disturb one of the area's few
nesting sites for the birds.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bicyclists slow down, dog walkers look up, stroller-pushing parents
stop and point: Craning their necks, anyone on the path bordering
Channel Islands Harbor can take in a flock of immense birds preening
atop the evergreens on a grassy strip beside the water.</LD>
<LD>   For at least 20 years, the trees have been home to what some
experts say is one of Ventura County's few known nesting sites for
great blue herons and black-crowned night herons.</LD>
<LD>   Now they are also the focus of a conflict pitting neighborhood
residents against county officials who are planning a
20,000-square-foot boating facility for the narrow strip of parkland
just north of the Whale's Tail restaurant.</LD>
<TE>   Relying on about $4.2 million from the state and $1.8 million in
local funds, officials see the building invigorating the county-run
harbor, now dotted by empty storefronts and languishing restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Completion is expected in 2005. Classes would be offered in
sailing, kayaking and rowing to students from local schools and the
new Cal State Channel Islands. Also offered would be programs in
marine education--a point the project's critics view as ironic.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be unfortunate if some of the very resources the center
was committed to educating the public about were destroyed by
building the center," wrote Morgan Wehtje, a state Department of Fish
and Game biologist, in a letter to county officials.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the county's plan ran into renewed opposition from the
agency that serves as a town board for the unincorporated
neighborhoods around the harbor.</TE>
<TE>   The Channel Islands Beach Community Services District already had
told county officials the building would be a good addition to the
harbor--at one of six other sites.</TE>
<TE>   This week the district's board demanded a full-blown environmental
impact report, rejecting the county's claim the project would cause
only negligible environmental damage.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran yachtsmen at the board's meeting also questioned the
site's safety.</TE>
<TE>   "It's totally insane from a safety standpoint," said Mark Gray,
whose boating safety television show ran for three years on The
Learning Channel.</TE>
<TE>   Prevailing winds could sweep novice sailors into heavy boating
traffic, Gray said, while a site across the harbor would keep them
out of harm's way.</TE>
<TE>   County officials say the neighbors' fears are overblown.</TE>
<TE>   Lyn Krieger, the harbor director, said the harbor's ample food
supply will keep the herons around, if in other trees.</TE>
<TE>   "They came in because of the food source, and they'll stay because
of the food source," she said, citing opinions from consulting
biologists.</TE>
<TE>   Construction will start in August 2003 and will aim to keep
interference with nesting at a minimum, she said.</TE>
<TE>   With a 6-foot wing span, great blue herons are among the largest
raptors in North America.</TE>
<TE>   The birds are believed to nest in secluded spots at Lake Casitas
and the mouth of the Santa Clara River.</TE>
<TE>   But the harbor site, in trees wedged between a restroom building
and a parking lot, is the only documented rookery in Ventura County,
Wehtje said.</TE>
<TE>   While the county's plan seems to generate little enthusiasm around
the harbor, restaurant owner Michael Koutnik suggested that opponents
simply fear change.</TE>
<TE>   "If this had been built 20 years ago, they would have lived along
with it and it would have been the greatest thing since sliced
bread," said Koutnik, whose Whale's Tail would be one of the
restaurants closest to the center.</TE>

<LD>A Las Vegas grand jury agreed Thursday to indict a San Bernardino
County teacher, formally accusing her of 19 charges in connection
with the alleged abduction of her student, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The grand jury will publish its indictment today, said Clark
County Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Luzaich.</LD>
<LD>   Tanya Hadden will be charged with six counts of statutory sexual
seduction, 12 counts of sexual conduct between a school employee and
a pupil, and one count of first-degree kidnapping, Luzaich said.</LD>
<TE>   Hadden, a former Cajon High School science teacher, is also
expected to face charges in San Bernardino County, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Hadden, 33, and Richard Pena, 15, a student in one of her classes,
were discovered together late last month in a Las Vegas hotel. The
pair fled after police began investigating whether Hadden had served
alcohol to Pena and another student at a party, authorities say.</TE>

<HD>Kaiser Clerks Paid More for Helping Less</HD>
<DH>Health care: Bonuses were given for limiting members' calls
and doctors' appointments. HMO defends program but has dropped it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kaiser Permanente, the state's largest HMO, until recently had
awarded financial bonuses to call center clerks who spent the least
amount of time on the phone with each patient and limited the number
of doctors' appointments, internal documents show.</LD>
<LD>   From January 2000 until last December, telephone service
representatives at Kaiser's three call centers in Northern California
could earn a bonus of up to 10% of their salary if they arranged
appointments for 15% to 35% of callers and if they spent less than an
average of three minutes, 45 seconds on the phone per patient.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, a recent Kaiser-commissioned survey of 505 registered
nurses at those centers found they had "a serious concern" that
callers were being forced to wait too long for doctors' appointments.
The call centers, which handle appointments and inquiries for
Kaiser's 3million members in Northern California, are in Sacramento,
Vallejo and San Jose.</LD>
<TE>   Nurses "feel unable to help patients and said they spend a lot of
time dealing with frustrated members when they are not able to
schedule appointments," said the Terranova Consulting Group report,
obtained by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Nurses did not participate in the clerks' bonus program.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser spokesman Jim Anderson dismissed suggestions that the
bonuses were intended to make it more difficult for patients to
access care. Rather, he said, they were intended to reward good
service and were based on the call centers' past performance.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a pilot program, and it was discontinued because it was
determined that it wasn't working" and didn't improve service to
members, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always difficult to balance the amount of time spent with an
individual caller versus the amount of time that the next person has
to wait to talk to someone," Anderson said. "We'll always err on the
side of helping the person who is on the phone who needs our
assistance."</TE>
<TE>   Since the nurses survey, Anderson said, Kaiser has made
improvements in scheduling, training and appointment availability in
Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   The California Nurses Assn., the union representing Kaiser's
registered nurses, contends that the main problem with the call
centers is that unlicensed telephone clerks field patient calls and
make decisions about when to schedule appointments or refer a caller
to a medical advice nurse.</TE>
<TE>   That amounts to evaluating a patient's medical condition, a task
restricted to licensed medical personnel by state law, the union
contends.</TE>
<TE>   State HMO regulators said Thursday that they are investigating
that complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "If we weren't concerned, we wouldn't be looking at it," said
Daniel Zingale, director of the California Department of Managed
Health Care.</TE>
<TE>   Although Zingale would not discuss the inquiry in detail, he said
his office has the power to order Kaiser to change its call center
policies.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser knows of no state inquiry, Anderson said, adding that no
regulators have visited Kaiser facilities regarding these matters.
"If there are questions, we would be happy to work with whoever is
raising them and help them resolve them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One of Kaiser's own physicians found problems at the Vallejo call
center. Dr. Harvey Kayman, a doctor at the pediatric call center from
December 1999 until April 2000, wrote in a report the month he left
that the center needed a "complete revision of the mission, goals and
objectives ... so that it no longer functions as a barrier, but an
agent of communication."</TE>
<TE>   Kayman said pediatric medical providers sent him messages
reflecting their "distrust, anger, disappointment and pessimism about
the call center."</TE>
<TE>   Patients have complained about "the impersonal nature of the
service they receive" and believe that the call center "puts a
barrier between them and their clinical providers," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said Kayman's report was unsolicited. But, "interestingly
enough, many of the things listed in his report were already on the
drawing board for changes at the call center," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The incentive plan for the telephone clerks was unveiled in
January 2000 in company memos. The incentives were a joint pilot
program between Kaiser and Service Employees International Union
Local 250, which represents the telephone clerks.</TE>
<TE>   To qualify for a bonus, employees had to meet three of four
criteria, according to one memo:</TE>
<TE>   * Handle regular calls in less than three minutes and 45 seconds
and foreign language calls in under eight minutes 30 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   * Schedule or request appointments in 15% to 35% of cases.</TE>
<TE>   * Transfer fewer than 50% of calls--60% on nights and weekends--to
advice nurses for additional help.</TE>
<TE>   * Spend an average of 75% or more of the workday answering calls.</TE>
<TE>   Bonuses, from 2% to 10% of a worker's salary, were awarded if
staff members met or exceeded the targets, the document says. Other
factors to be considered were attendance, tardiness and customer
service. Each person could earn up to $625 in bonuses every quarter.</TE>
<TE>   An internal document, titled "Talking Points for Managers," said
the bonuses are a way to "reward and encourage performance
improvements."</TE>
<TE>   "Kaiser Permanente is making a financial commitment to its
employees for the purpose of improving our phone service to members,"
the document said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Linda Peeno, a former health plan medical director who now
testifies against HMOs in malpractice suits, said the Kaiser
incentive program was "egregious."</TE>
<TE>   "It just virtually ensures that you're not going to get
appropriate evaluation, and you're certainly not going to get access
to anyone who would be able to evaluate you appropriately," said
Peeno, whose own experiences in HMOs is the subject of the upcoming
Showtime movie "Damaged Care."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a recipe for not just minimal care, but no care."</TE>
<TE>   In the recent survey, Kaiser's call-center nurses reported feeling
pressure to spend little time with each patient.</TE>
<TE>   "The nurses are being forced to quickly deal with these people,
write it up and move on to the next one or else they're disciplined,"
said Morton Newman, one of the union's labor representatives.</TE>
<TE>   Nurses get regular reports outlining their average handling time,
and that criterion is factored into their annual evaluation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's tremendous pressure on the nurses to cut off the calls,
which is a conflict with their license," Newman said.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said there is no limit to the amount of time nurses can
spend with callers. The Kaiser documents, obtained by The Times, come
nine months after a top Kaiser official acknowledged past delays in
meeting patients' demands. He said those problems were rectified.</TE>
<TE>   According to minutes of a meeting last year, the chief executive
of Kaiser's Northern California physician group described how in the
past "we chose not to provide our patients with what they desired."
Kaiser documents suggested that his was done to save money and
"control demand."</TE>
<TE>   That strategy proved counterproductive because patients persisted
until they got past the telephonic triage system, the doctor said.</TE>

<HD>Mahony's 'Big Problem' Is Largely of His Own Making</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He didn't call the police.</LD>
<LD>   He didn't warn parishioners.</LD>
<LD>   He didn't check up on the molester who had confessed to him in
1986. That left the offending priest free to prey on more children
for another 14 years.</LD>
<TE>   I don't know whether to ask for a grand jury investigation of Los
Angeles Cardinal Roger M. Mahony or run to the nearest church and
light a candle for him.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, who has held himself up as a crusader against sexual abuse
by priests, is not the reformer he'd have you believe. The latest
proof is the case of Father Michael Baker, as detailed by Glenn F.
Bunting and other colleagues in Thursday's Times.</TE>
<TE>   For months now, those of us who've been covering the scandal in
the Roman Catholic Church have been aware of Father Baker. We knew
about Mahony's attorneys writing a $1.3-million check in 2000 to
quietly settle a claim by two brothers. They say Baker molested them
for 13 years after the priest confessed his compulsion to Mahony.</TE>
<TE>   But Mahony isn't an easy man to get answers out of, unless they're
the ones he wants you to hear. Here's what I'm talking about.</TE>
<TE>   After I'd hammered him in print for weeks, the cardinal stunned me
with an e-mail invitation for a personal tour of the new $200-million
downtown cathedral. It was my first clue he'd missed his true
calling. He should have gone into PR.</TE>
<TE>   Fine, I replied. The sooner the better, because I've got some
questions I'd like to ask. But after several cordial exchanges,
Mahony laid down the 11th Commandment: Thou shalt not ask questions
about anything but the cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   Was he kidding? He's sitting on top of a festering scandal, I've
got two or three dozen queries about what he knew and when, and he
thinks I'm going to come by to marvel at the Rog Mahal?</TE>
<TE>   In the end, he canceled my tour, and any hope of resurrecting it
faded soon thereafter. Mahony couldn't have been eager to see me
after I dug up the details on the way he handled a confessed molester
back when Mahony was bishop in Stockton. The priest molested again
and again after Mahony moved him around the diocese in the 1980s.
Sound familiar?</TE>
<TE>   But if I couldn't get to Mahony, my colleague Beth Shuster did.
Last month she asked him whether Father Baker had confessed his abuse
of minors.</TE>
<TE>   No recollection of it, Mahony said.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he told Shuster he thought another church official might
have met with Baker.</TE>
<TE>   Then, this Tuesday, he gave a third version. In a letter to
diocesan priests, he admitted that in 1986, "Baker disclosed to me
that he had problems in the past of acting out sexually with two
minors."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds like a case of repressed memory. But what caused the
epiphany?</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite likely that very soon the public media will highlight
the case," Mahony wrote to his priests. In the letter, he said Baker
was removed from the ministry after the allegations in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed he was. But not even then did Mahony call police. He wrote
a $1.3-million check instead.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as the scandal grew and Mahony promised everyone he had
handed the names of all known molesters to police, internal memos
revealed the cardinal's dilemma.</TE>
<TE>   Should he tell police about Baker, even though it would reflect
badly on him and the diocese? Or should he keep it quiet and risk
being dragged before a grand jury and, in his own words, get hit with
"charges of cover-up, concealing criminals etc. etc."</TE>
<TE>   His worst nightmare might actually now come true. L.A. County
Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley apparently woke from his nap long enough to
see that The Times was doing his job for him and ordered the cardinal
to either open up personnel files or answer to a grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   Either option might prove uncomfortable for Mahony, who just a few
weeks ago was wagging a finger at Boston Cardinal Bernard Law. If
Mahony were ever guilty of gross negligence like that, he promised,
he'd have trouble walking down a church aisle.</TE>
<TE>   But this story has been about hypocrisy and betrayal from Day One.</TE>
<TE>   "Our biggest problem" in dealing with Baker, Mahony told The
Times, "was that ... he wasn't found guilty of a criminal act. That's
a big problem."</TE>
<TE>   No it isn't. When a priest confesses to molesting children, there
are three things to do.</TE>
<TE>   First, call the police. Second, check on the victims. Third,
defrock the priest.</TE>
<TE>   To do anything less is a morally corrupt act of self-preservation,
an insult to victims and a disservice to countless honorable priests.</TE>
<TE>   Why can everyone but church leaders see the obvious?</TE>
<TE>   (Clarification: In Wednesday's column I said Gov. Davis had cut
education to balance the budget, but he actually just delayed a
$1.7-billion expenditure by one year).</TE>

<LD>A teacher at Santa Margarita Catholic High School has been arrested
on 10 counts of child molestation after a parent tipped off
authorities, an Orange County sheriff's spokesman said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Karl Sandoval, a ceramics teacher, was arrested Wednesday
at Huntington Memorial Hospital in South Pasadena, where he had
admitted himself to the psychiatric ward, sheriff's spokesman Jim
Amormino said.</LD>
<LD>   Sandoval, 49, was arrested and taken to Orange County Jail in
Santa Ana, where he was being held on $100,000 bail. He is to be
arraigned today at the Central Justice Center in Santa Ana.</LD>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials said the female victim is younger than
14. Amormino said she is not a student at the Rancho Santa Margarita
high school but does know Sandoval.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities allege the molestation happened between July 1, 2001,
and April 30. The girl's mother called investigators Monday, Amormino
said, and Sandoval checked himself into Huntington Memorial the same
day.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Schinderle, spokeswoman for the Diocese of Orange, said
Sandoval had been a faculty member at Santa Margarita for seven years
after transferring from a Roman Catholic high school in the
Archdiocese of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We're shocked and saddened by this," Schinderle said. "We haven't
had any negative reports regarding Sandoval." Apparently he was
well-liked by pupils, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Amormino said investigators suspect that Sandoval may have
molested other children. He encouraged anyone with information about
Sandoval to call the sheriff's sex crimes unit.</TE>

<TE>   Maria Schinderle, spokeswoman for the Diocese of Orange, said

<HD>Student Car Racers Snap to It</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Snapping mousetraps and purring motors signaled the potential
beginnings of 60 future engineering careers at the Mousetrap Racer
and Electric Vehicle Contest Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Students from nine Los Angeles schools were at the competition in
Watts, organized by the city's Department of Public Works for the
second year as a vehicle to lure young people into studying
engineering and possibly working for the agency in the future.</LD>
<LD>   Screams of excitement filled the Jordan High School gym as balsa
wood race cars, powered by thumb-size motors or propelled by the
snapping of household mousetraps, skidded 25 feet across the floor
and up an incline.</LD>
<TE>   The winner in the mousetrap racer contest, Leslie Andrews, had
painted his car blue and made it more aerodynamic by cutting a hole
in the back and sanding thin the wooden tires.</TE>
<TE>   Andrews, a sophomore at Southwest Middle College High School, said
the contest inspired him to consider a career as an automotive
technician.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the competitive part of the race that I liked, though,"
said Andrews, 16, who received a trophy and a gift certificate.
"Getting a little scared but knowing that I came out on top in the
end was the fun part."</TE>
<TE>   The event is one of eight annual engineering competitions the
department co-sponsors with the city's Operation Healthy
Neighborhoods and the nonprofit organization Future Scientists &amp;
Engineers of America.</TE>
<TE>   "These competitions are a hands-on way to demystify what an
engineer does," said Michael Simpson, council liaison for Public
Works. "It's a very early recruitment tool to make our work force
mirror the city of Los Angeles. It's different, but to get the kids'
interest, you have to do things like this."</TE>
<TE>   Between races, students made last-minute adjustments to their
cars, some undecorated except for a number, others adorned with
flames and glittery silver paint. Students groaned when their cars
flipped over on the torque testing ramp or made abrupt turns on the
floor. On the sidelines, a mini-repair shop was stocked with three
shoe boxes crammed with Krazy Glue, rubber bands and spare wheels.</TE>
<TE>   Boys outnumbered girls 2 to 1. One group of girls from the USC
Math, Science and Technology Magnet Center carved the sides of their
purple-and-black mousetrap car to read "Girls Only" and chipped out
the back to read "L.A." in Dodger-style print.</TE>
<TE>   Two girls from Jordan High took the third-place mousetrap trophy.
They said they were considering engineering careers.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely will now," said junior Giselle Gamino, 16, as she
spun the wheels on the teal-and-aqua car. "Now we have the
self-esteem to know we can build things and make them work--and beat
the boys."</TE>
<TE>   Belmont High School biology teacher Lorraine Wallis said the
competitions act as springboards. "We're always concerned about kids
in inner-city schools getting the exposure they need to the resources
that will uplift them," Wallis said. "This shows them the
possibilities for after high school are completely unlimited."</TE>
<TE>   The Public Works Department plans next year to add competitions
involving solar energy and sewer systems to its current lineup, which
includes catapult- and bridge-building contests.</TE>

<HD>Hundreds of Bent Nails Found in Park</HD>

<AU>H.G. REZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several hundred bent nails were found Thursday in a Santa Ana park,
and investigators are trying to determine if they were simply
discarded or left there to harm people.</LD>
<LD>   Police Sgt. Baltazar De La Riva said park workers discovered the
nails on a hiking and bike path.</LD>
<LD>   The nails were attached in strands for use in a nail gun, he said,
and were covered by leaves and debris. The strands ranged in length
from a few inches to a few feet, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The pointed ends of some of the nails were up, De La Riva said.</TE>
<TE>   "They were also bent and twisted in a manner that indicated they
were to be discarded, or to purposely expose the pointed end of the
nails."</TE>
<TE>   No nails were found in the adjacent areas of the park, including
the children's playground, De La Riva said.</TE>
<TE>   In the last three weeks, nails and razor blades have been found in
at least five parks and playgrounds in south Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   De La Riva said police will compare notes with Orange County
sheriff's investigators, who are working on the other cases, to try
to determine if the incidents are related.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Seventy-eight people have been arrested in the Los Angeles area in a
scheme to sell passing test scores to applicants who otherwise would
not qualify to work as certified nursing assistants, state
prosecutors said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said the fraudulently obtained
certificates were used to get jobs at 47 nursing homes in Los Angeles
and Orange counties.</LD>
<LD>   The scheme was first reported by a nursing home administrator who
noticed that an applicant could not speak, read or write English,
Lockyer said. The tests are given in English.</LD>
<TE>   An investigation by the attorney general's Medi-Cal fraud unit
found that applicants targeted paid as much as $600 apiece for
guarantees that passing test scores would be reported to the state.
Most of the defendants are applicants who await trial on misdemeanor
counts.</TE>

<HD>Prom Night Memories to Dye for: Purple Hair Clashing With
White Gown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Asked his biggest prom fear, Beverly Hills High sophomore Rambod
Behnam told the school newspaper: "During the slow dance, my hair dye
leaks onto my date's white dress." That's purple hair dye, for the
record.</LD>
<LD>   The latest trash talk in the sports world: The police log of the
Los Alamitos News-Enterprise reported that a resident "claimed the
trash collectors took his $360 portable basketball hoop along with
the trash."</LD>
<LD>   Not again! Major-leaguers are talking about going on strike,
thereby trashing another baseball season. I'm reminded of the
sarcastic sign posted by the Short Stop bar near Dodger Stadium
during the 1994 stoppage (see photo).</LD>
<TE>   I say, "Ptooey!": Don't know if you heard, but a Northern
California assemblyman has proposed that Bodie be named the state's
official ghost town. What an insult to Barstow's neighbor, Calico!
That dusty settlement not only had a colorful era as a boomtown in
the last century but is still making history. Why, Calico Ghost Town
is where Harbor City native David O'Dell (see photo) qualified for
the Guinness Book of Records a few years ago with the longest tobacco
spit in history: 49 feet, 51/2 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Escaping L.A.: Adrienne and Steve Dahlerbruch of Beverly Hills
found a true fast-food restaurant in the Netherlands (see photo). Its
sign is reminiscent of the old Army mess hall exhortation to
basic-training recruits: "Eat it here--swallow it outside."</TE>
<TE>   More food for thought: A couple of police log entries caught my
eye in the Hollywood Independent:</TE>
<TE>   * "A robber entered a restaurant and said to an employee, 'This is
a robbery.' When asked what he wanted, the robber said, 'Give me the
cookies.' The employee complied."</TE>
<TE>   * "A man drove up to an apartment building, got out of his car,
took 12 lemons off a tree in the yard and then drove off."</TE>
<TE>   Devil of a trend: Oregon author April Henry, whose Claire Montrose
mysteries contain clues in the form of vanity license plates, was in
this state recently on a promotional tour. She saw a real-life plate
that said S8NLVS, which moved her to comment: "In Oregon, hailing
Satan would be a big no-no." Not so here. No doubt confirming what
many people in other parts of the country feel about this depraved
state, California is also the home of vanity plates that say SATAN,
MESATAN and, one to think about in the future, SATANJR.</TE>

<HD>Ban on Tech Sales by State Advisors Passes Senate</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Backers say bill to bar consultants from selling
goods might have prevented Oracle deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Prodded by fallout from the state's questionable $95-million Oracle
software licensing contract, the Senate voted Thursday to ban
companies from advising the state on computer-related products and
then trying to sell the state the same goods.</LD>
<LD>   With a 36-0 vote, the Senate approved a bill by Sen. Debra Bowen
(D-Marina del Rey) to close a loophole in state purchasing law. Her
bill would end a 19-year-old conflict-of-interest exemption for
computer-related goods and services that allows information
technology consultants hired by the state to bid to provide products
recommended under the consulting contract.</LD>
<LD>   Bowen's SB 1467 is similar to bills that were vetoed by Govs. Pete
Wilson in 1998 and Gray Davis in 1999. Had one of those bills been
signed, supporters said, it might have prevented the Oracle contract,
which state auditors called one-sided and unnecessary in a scathing
report last month.</LD>
<TE>   "You're literally having the salesman draft your purchase order,
and that's the way it works routinely with high-tech procurement in
the state," said Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), who carried the
earlier, vetoed bills. State contract experts had urged vetoes,
arguing that limited competition in the technology industry justified
an exemption to the conflict-of-interest law.</TE>
<TE>   Bowen's bill heads next to the Assembly. Davis has taken no
position on it, a spokesman said, but is "looking at it closely."</TE>
<TE>   The state signed the Oracle agreement without validating the
claims of cost savings touted by Logicon, a go-between company that
stood to earn $28 million from the deal, which state officials are
seeking to rescind. A year before, Logicon was hired by the
Department of Information Technology to write an overview of the
state's software licensing options. Although the company never
completed the work and was not paid, its apparently conflicting
interest in the Oracle contract "sure would have raised a lot more
red flags" if legislation closing the loophole had been in place,
Bowen said.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Thursday, the governor named John Clark Kelso as interim
director of the Department of Information Technology. The governor
suspended department Director Elias Cortez earlier this month as
lawmakers began investigating the Oracle contract.</TE>
<TE>   Kelso, 42, directs the Institute for Legislative Practice at the
McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento. He briefly served as state
insurance commissioner after Chuck Quackenbush resigned in July 2000.</TE>

<LD>It's safe to say that Mary Zamora didn't see herself as symbolic of
anything when she abandoned Los Angeles 41 years ago for Orange
County.</LD>
<LD>   She was.</LD>
<LD>   Merely by deciding way back then that she didn't like the changing
racial makeup in her South-Central Los Angeles neighborhood and
opting for Tustin, hers was in the vanguard of a wave of families
that would establish Orange County as the anti-Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Concerned about possible racial tension? Too much concrete in
L.A.? Don't like city schools? Sick of urban life and longing for
something simpler? Something--let's tell like it is--more white,
perhaps?</TE>
<TE>   For thousands of Los Angeles families in the 1960s, that place was
Orange County--a mere freeway hop away.</TE>
<TE>   What an irony, then, that the place that came of age as the
anti-Los Angeles now resembles it more than ever. They're taking the
"sub" out of suburbia. That's what new census figures say about
Orange County, which probably means that, somewhere, Angelenos are
laughing ... as if they care.</TE>
<TE>   I met Mary Zamora on Thursday morning in the drapery shop she
helped found in 1961 and still owns. Now two weeks shy of 84, she
looks 20 years younger and says she still pulls more than her share
of the work at the company, Rose-Marie Draperies.</TE>
<TE>   It struck me as more than appropriate, given the topic of change,
that the store still sits on Main Street in the part of Tustin known
as Old Town.</TE>
<TE>   "When I opened it, there was nothing here," Zamora says. "This was
a ghost town. All these old buildings, half of them were closed.
There were only 3,000 people in Tustin when I came, and it was all
white."</TE>
<TE>   It was anti-Los Angeles in so many ways.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a drugstore on the corner over here, and every morning
at 9 they'd ring a big cowbell, and all of us would close our stores
for a half-hour and go over there for coffee."</TE>
<TE>   When she expanded her store to an adjoining building, one of her
first tasks was to "dig out an outdoor privy out front. And it cost
me money to fill the darn thing up."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Orange County was a much different place way back then.</TE>
<TE>   Though it's true Zamora didn't like the changing demographics of
her Los Angeles neighborhood, let's not cast stones. Her family was
among literally millions of white Americans from coast to coast in
the 1960s and 1970s that left increasingly integrated neighborhoods
for all-white suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Zamora says of Tustin, "a lot of the farmers around here
were Basque, and I was Basque."</TE>
<TE>   What about now? I ask Zamora. Tustin has grown to nearly 70,000.
One-third of its residents are foreign-born. Nearly half speak a
language other than English at home. Its public schools graduate
students from nationalities around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   It sounds like Orange County has, indeed, become Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Zamora doesn't buy that. She still loves Tustin and its ethnic
diversity and disputes that the city and county have become another
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "People who come here want a better living," she says. "But they
also want to keep life normal and be friends with everybody. If you
live next door to an Asian, you get to know them, you become
friends."</TE>
<TE>   That small-town feeling--which may be more pronounced in a quaint
place like Old Town--still is part of the Orange County identity,
Zamora says.</TE>
<TE>   She doesn't sugar-coat, however, the squabbles that arise when
ethnic groups merge. Like many latter-day whites in Orange County,
she thinks the emergent Latino population sometimes overreaches in
pursuing broad political agendas.</TE>
<TE>   "They're pushing us, I feel," she says.</TE>
<TE>   But she goes on to say she'd rather live in this place at this
time than in another all-white enclave. She makes a humorous point of
saying she doesn't much care for Newport Beach. "You think one way,
you get in a rut," she says. "You've got to think a lot of different
ways."</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say that she, like most humans, doesn't occasionally
long for simpler, quieter times.</TE>
<TE>   No matter the decade, however, census figures always seem
inevitably to take us further and further from those simpler, quieter
times.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Zamora says, Orange County isn't Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it'll ever be. It's because of the people who come
here. They think differently."</TE>

<LD>Kimberly Miles, 33, who received a lung in November 2000 in a rare
operation in which her sister and a friend donated parts of their
lungs, died Monday in Minneapolis from cystic fibrosis.</LD>
<LD>   Miles was born with the genetic disorder that affects the lungs,
digestive system and other organs. She managed to lead a full life in
her hometown, Black River Falls, Wis., where she lived with her son,
9, and his father.</LD>
<LD>   By 2000, doctors said they did not believe she would live long
enough to receive a lung from a cadaver. Miles' sister, Tammy Hoff,
and friend DorMae Gebhardt, both in their 30s, offered to be donors.</LD>
<TE>   The transplant was successful, and her new lungs, consisting of
one lobe from each donor, worked well. But she soon developed
digestive problems, probably from the cystic fibrosis.</TE>

<HD>Douglas Pike, 77; Historian, Archivist of the Vietnam War</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Douglas Pike, a leading historian of the Vietnam War known especially
for his authoritative writing about the Viet Cong, died Monday at a
hospital in Lubbock, Texas. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   Pike suffered a stroke in November and never fully recovered, said
his wife, Myrna.</LD>
<LD>   He was the author of eight books on Vietnam. His 1966 volume,
"Viet Cong: The Organization and Techniques of the National
Liberation Front of South Vietnam," established his credentials as a
scholar on the then still-unfolding war.</LD>
<TE>   His work drew heavily on his own impressive trove of documents
amassed during the 15 years he spent tracking the Viet Cong as a U.S.
foreign service officer in Asia. Among the estimated 7 million pages
of documents he collected are 15,000 books, 15,000 monographs and
3,000 slides.</TE>
<TE>   The archive includes a complete set of the original Pentagon
Papers, secret correspondence between American ambassadors and U.S.
presidents, and thousands of captured enemy documents.</TE>
<TE>   "He left the materials that will make it possible for future
generations of students to formulate their own questions and their
own answers" about one of the most vexing of America's wars, said
James Reckner, director of the Vietnam Center at Texas Tech
University, where most of Pike's collection is housed.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the competing perceptions of the nature, course and
purpose of the war are represented" in his archive, Pike said in
1988. "This is particularly valuable, since most of what Americans
know about the war is very parochial."</TE>
<TE>   Pike was born in Cass Lake, Minn., the son of a house builder and
a schoolteacher. He grew up in Minot, N.D., where later his plans to
become a journalist were interrupted by World War II. He entered the
Army Signal Corps and served in the South Pacific. He was among the
first American troops in Japan at the end of the war, and wrote about
the destruction of Hiroshima for the military newspaper Stars and
Stripes.</TE>
<TE>   After the war he studied journalism at the University of North
Dakota, then worked as a writer for the United Nations in South
Korea. In 1953 he earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from UC
Berkeley. He later earned a master's in international communications
from American University.</TE>
<TE>   In 1960 he became a foreign service officer with the United States
Information Agency and was assigned to what was then Saigon. The Viet
Cong was formed the month he arrived, "and we grew up together," he
noted in the preface to his 1986 book, "PAVN: People's Army of
Vietnam." Even after he was reassigned to Hong Kong, Taipei, Tokyo
and other Asian outposts, he continued his research on Vietnam and
witnessed most of the war's most searing events.</TE>
<TE>   "Viet Cong" was his first book-length work on the war, written in
1965, just as the American buildup in the Southeast Asian nation was
beginning. It was a landmark work describing the origins and purposes
of the Viet Cong, based in part on documents seized from the National
Liberation Front and on the many hours he spent interviewing Viet
Cong defectors and prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Pike later investigated the Hue massacre, which unfolded over 24
days in February 1968 during the Tet offensive. His findings,
reported on the front page of the Los Angeles Times and other papers
in 1969, described the slaughter of an estimated 6,000 civilians and
concluded that nearly all the killing was dictated by North
Vietnamese leaders for political purposes. His report was attacked by
critics of the war.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after starting his foreign service Pike established himself
as an expert on the Viet Cong, conducting research on his own time.
Gradually he assumed broader responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   At one point in the mid-1960s he ran a unit conducting
psychological warfare. An exchange he had with an American general
that was reported in David Halberstam's "The Best and the Brightest"
took place during a meeting on the importance of psychological
warfare.</TE>
<TE>   The general said his job was to kill members of the Viet Cong. But
Pike, already the historian, interjected that the French had killed
many Vietnamese fighters during their protracted conflict there and
still lost the war.</TE>
<TE>   "Didn't kill enough," the general replied.</TE>
<TE>   In "PAVN: People's Army of Vietnam," Pike traced the development
of what had become by then one of the world's largest armies, from
its beginnings at the end of World War II to the mid-1980s, when it
had more than 1 million members.</TE>
<TE>   Pike wrote that the American dilemma in Vietnam was compounded by
an utter ignorance of the mentality of the North Vietnamese high
command and strategy and the failure to understand its concept of
armed and political struggle.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, he wrote, was faced with "a strategy for which
there is no known proven counterstrategy."</TE>
<TE>   Pike retired from the foreign service in 1982 and joined the staff
of UC Berkeley, where he established the Indochina Archive.</TE>
<TE>   He also began to publish the quarterly Indochina Chronology, a
bible for Indochina scholars and observers that contained
comprehensive updates on events in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. He
produced the publication until he became ill late last year.</TE>
<TE>   Budget problems at Berkeley led Pike to take a job at Texas Tech's
Vietnam Center in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Although he considered himself a liberal, he did not strike other
liberals as one of their own, Reckner said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was always sensitive to the fact there were no blacks and
whites in Vietnam, just shades of gray. So when people criticized

<HD>Many Sources Probably Fouled Coast</HD>
<DH>Pollution: Several factors contributed to the 1999 closures
of miles of Huntington Beach shoreline, sanitation officials and
scientists believe.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There is a growing consensus by Orange County sanitation officials
and scientists that the 1999 beach closures in Huntington Beach may
have been caused not by a single source of pollution but by several
factors occurring at one time.</LD>
<LD>   The district this week released an exhaustive, $5-million study
that did not find a definitive source for the high bacteria levels at
the beach. The study found no substantial evidence that sewage dumped
from an ocean outfall four miles offshore was the cause, but
scientists could not rule it out, either.</LD>
<LD>   The findings match what other outside scientists are beginning to
believe: that a multitude of problems--from dirty urban runoff to
leaking sewer pipes--caused pollution levels to spike that summer.</LD>
<TE>   If this "multiple-source" theory proves true, it's a mixed
blessing for Huntington Beach residents and merchants who worry
bacteria levels could again rise, closing the coastline once again.</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand, some of the pollution sources cited by scientists
have since been fixed. But because there are so many possible causes
for the high bacteria counts, it makes it more difficult to develop a
single "magic bullet" that could fix the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Cumulatively, these things do not constitute a big smoking gun,"
said Kelly Christensen, a sanitation district environmental engineer.</TE>
<TE>   Among the possible culprits for the pollution:</TE>
<TE>   * Sewage leaks at several restrooms at Huntington State Beach. The
leaks have been repaired.</TE>
<TE>   * Contaminated water leaking from the Huntington Beach flood
control channel at Pacific Coast Highway and Beach Boulevard into a
salt marsh. The leak has been repaired.</TE>
<TE>   * Leaks in a 21-inch Orange County Sanitation District sewer line,
which will soon be replaced.</TE>
<TE>   * Two trailer parks--one in Huntington Beach and the other in
Newport Beach--use old sewer lines that leak badly. Each city is
repairing the lines.</TE>
<TE>   * Dirty runoff from storm drains near the Huntington Beach Pier
and around the mouth of the Santa Ana River.</TE>
<TE>   * Waste from several hundred gulls that spend nighttime hours
resting just beyond the surf zone.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists and some scientists remain convinced that the
sewage outfall is also a cause of the pollution.</TE>
<TE>   "To argue about whether we should be dumping 240 million gallons
of partially treated sewage in the ocean is like arguing how deck
furniture on the Titanic is arranged," said Christopher Evans,
executive director of the Surfrider Foundation, a San Clemente-based
environmental group. "It's goofy in the extreme."</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, officials have said a sewage plume emanating from
the outfall does not come closer than half a mile from the
shoreline--and usually is much farther out.</TE>
<TE>   But Cynthia Cudaback, a UC Santa Barbara scientist who served as a
peer reviewer analyzing the sanitation district report findings, said
that there may be some transport from the plume onto the shore--but
at levels lower than state standards.</TE>
<TE>   The study was launched after Stanley Grant, a UC Irvine scientist,
theorized that outfall may have caused the beach closures. Grant said
the results neither prove nor disprove his theory. But he believes
the outfall still might be one factor. "The surf zone is a recipient
of ... contamination from a number of different sources," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The study was handled by researchers from USC, the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography and the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School
under guidance by the U.S. Geological Survey and sanitation district
scientists. Scientists from UC Santa Barbara and the University of
Hawaii reviewed the results.</TE>
<TE>   The county's Sanitation District will soon decide whether to seek
a renewal of its waiver to the federal Clean Water Act.</TE>

<TE>   The county's Sanitation District will soon decide whether to seek
a renewal of its waiver to the federal Clean Water Act. The waiver
allows the agency to treat half of the waste water it pumps into the
ocean at levels less than those adopted by most of the nation's
16,000 sanitation districts.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups and three coastal cities, including
Huntington Beach, oppose extending the waiver. Sanitation district
officials say treating all of its outflow to the highest levels--by
using microorganisms to eliminate bacteria and viruses--would cost
more than $400 million.</TE>

<HD>Klamath Water Plan May Destroy Fish</HD>
<DH>Environment: A federal report says current irrigation
levels threaten salmon in the river. A solution is also offered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SCHOCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The National Marine Fisheries Service warned Thursday that plans to
provide water to farmers in the upper Klamath River Basin would
jeopardize the continued existence of coho salmon in the river.</LD>
<LD>   The service suggested that the federal government pull together
California, Oregan and other parties to create a plan to meet the
water needs of both farms and salmon.</LD>
<LD>   .</LD>
<TE>   In a long-awaited draft report, the Fisheries Service recommended
that the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation be required to provide only 57%
of the water flows that regulators deem necessary for the salmon's
survival. In what a service administrator calls an unusual step,
other parties--including the states of California and Oregon--will be
asked to help provide water in a plan to be developed in the next
several years.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to hold the bureau accountable for all the flows
the fish might need, but we will hold them accountable for their
contribution" to solving the problem, said James Lecky, assistant
regional administrator for the fisheries service, which is
responsible for protecting salmon under the Endangered Species Act.</TE>
<TE>   The new approach was hammered out in meetings between the
fisheries service and the Bureau of Reclamation, which operates a
94-year-old irrigation system serving hundreds of farms along the
California-Oregon border.</TE>
<TE>   That agency received the draft report Thursday, and its staff has
begun reviewing its contents, said bureau spokesman Jeff McCracken.</TE>
<TE>   The public can comment on the draft through May 24, and a final
version is expected June 1, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Keppen, executive director of the Klamath Water Users Assn.,
the leading farmers' group in the area, said he was heartened by the
report.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears to be a very innovative document," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The question of how to divide Klamath River water between basin
farmers and rare fish has long created controversy in the basin.</TE>
<TE>   But court decisions and a massive drought last year brought
matters to a head, as hundreds of farmers were denied water that was
sent down river to protect coho salmon.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1997, the fish has been listed as threatened under the
Endangered Species Act, meaning that the fisheries service must
review and approve Bureau of Reclamation irrigation plans.</TE>
<TE>   The water shut-off last year forced some farmers into bankruptcy
and prompted protests that the federal government was valuing fish
over people.</TE>
<TE>   The report issued Thursday reviews how the Bureau of Reclamation's
10-year plan for its irrigation project will affect coho salmon. It
sets out proposed water flows to be reached by the year 2010 that it
says will benefit the fish.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists called on the agency to explain why those
levels--higher than what are being delivered this year--are not being
required now.</TE>
<TE>   "My question to the agency is what is different about the year
2010? If the fish are going to need those flows in the year 2010, I
don't see how the agency can defend not requiring those flows now,"
said Kristen Boyles, attorney for Earthjustice, which represents
fishermen and environmentalists in a lawsuit brought last month.</TE>

<HD>Saul Pick, 85; Developed Cinerama Dome, Rebuilt Columbia
Studios</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saul Pick, one of the largest single land owners in Hollywood, who
built the Cinerama Dome, redeveloped a corner of Sunset and Vine, and
turned the abandoned Columbia Studios into the biggest independently
owned television and movie facility in Los Angeles, has died. He was
85.</LD>
<LD>   Pick died of pneumonia May 8 at UCLA Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   A German concentration camp survivor, he arrived in Los Angeles
with little money and did not speak a word of English. But by the
late 1950s, he had begun buying and developing many familiar
Hollywood landmarks.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to building the Cinerama Dome in 1963, Pick built the
two buildings on the southwest corner of Sunset and Vine that house
the Hollywood headquarters of Bank of America and Wells Fargo Bank.</TE>
<TE>   He also turned the former KHJ-TV studio on North Vine Street into
a thriving independent television facility that was bought by ABC in
1970.</TE>
<TE>   Pick also built the first high-rise hotel on the Sunset Strip.
Originally called Gene Autry's Hotel Continental when it opened in
1963, it is now called the Hyatt West Hollywood, but may best be
known as the Continental Hyatt House.</TE>
<TE>   But Pick's biggest project was the old Columbia Studios lot at the
intersection of Sunset and Gower.</TE>
<TE>   The onetime fiefdom of studio czar Harry Cohn and the former home
of director Frank Capra, the "Gower Gulch" studio had fallen into
disrepair when Pick and partner Nick Vanoff bought what was
considered a white elephant in 1976 for $6.2million.</TE>
<TE>   Several years earlier, Columbia Pictures had moved to the Warner
Bros. lot in Burbank, which became the jointly owned Burbank Studios,
and many of the old Gower lot's sound stages had been converted into
indoor tennis courts.</TE>
<TE>   But Pick and Vanoff, seeing an increasing demand for production
space, renovated the studio, whose antique doors, carpeting and even
toilet seats had been looted.</TE>
<TE>   By 1981, the renamed Sunset-Gower Studios had become a bustling
lot, with ABC renting a third of its 16 stages and some 50 other
tenants, including film director Robert Wise.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no sense of history and no sense of what it had been
until Saul took it over," said longtime tenant Paul Junger Witt, a
television and film producer ("The Golden Girls," "Soap") who began
his career at Columbia in the mid-1960s.</TE>
<TE>   "When Pick-Vanoff took over the studio, it was in disrepair, and
Saul painstakingly restored what was salvageable and built what
needed to be rebuilt and managed to save a true Hollywood landmark."</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, Pick and Vanoff also purchased the landmark Aquarius
Theater, which previously had been the Moulin Rouge nightclub and the
Earl Carroll Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   They converted it into a state-of-the art television theater that
for nine years was the home of "Star Search" and today is the
Nickelodeon Theater.</TE>
<TE>   Witt, who knew Pick well, marvels at the man and his legacy.</TE>
<TE>   "To experience the Holocaust and come to this country and build a
new life and leave behind important landmarks is testimony to a truly
remarkable individual," Witt said.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a tax attorney, Pick was born in Bendzin, Germany,
which is now part of Poland. He was an engineering student when he
was drafted into the Polish Army and captured by the Russians three
days into World War II.</TE>
<TE>   As a prisoner of war, he managed to escape twice, first from a
Russian POW camp and later from a Nazi prison camp, but was
recaptured.</TE>
<TE>   Pick met his future wife, Mala, in a forced-labor camp, but they
were separated when he was sent to Dachau, where he spent the last
two years of the war.</TE>
<TE>   Pick's parents and four of his eight siblings perished at
Auschwitz.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Mala tracked down Pick in a former German hospital,
where he was being treated for typhus. They were married in Munich
shortly after their reunion.</TE>
<TE>   In 1947, the couple immigrated to the United States, and moved to
Los Angeles where his wife had relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Pick found work as a carpenter's assistant. But after about a
year, he came home one day and declared, "I can't work for anybody
else."</TE>
<TE>   Tapping into the post-war housing boom in Los Angeles, he began
manufacturing aluminum doors and siding for houses.</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1950s, he had moved into real estate by buying both
the southwest and southeast corners of Sunset and Vine.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad was an incredibly optimistic man and a dreamer and builder
who, after the experiences in the war, felt anything was possible: It
was a miracle to be alive," said Pick's son, Mark, the managing
partner of Sunset-Gower Studios.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles) remembers Pick as a
man who not only took care of his own Hollywood property but "looked
out for the area. He tried to encourage other businesses to do
repairs."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg, a former member of the Los Angeles City Council, said
Pick also "did a lot of things that were very quiet," such as making
sizable donations to homeless outreach programs and making annual
donations for after-school groups in the area.</TE>
<TE>   "He was of the old school, which was a person who looked at the
bottom line, but he also looked at something other than the bottom
line; he wanted to know how the community as a whole was doing."</TE>
<TE>   Mala Pick died in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son, Pick is survived by his second wife,
Karen; his son, Bernard, two grandchildren; his brother, Moritz; and
sister, Sala Magier, all of Los Angeles.</TE>

<LD>Richard Tuite, 33, pleaded not guilty in the 1998 murder of Stephanie
Ann Crowe, 12, in Escondido. Judge David Szumowski ordered Tuite held
without bail and set a hearing for June 10.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said that Tuite, who was to be released from prison
Friday on an unrelated burglary conviction, is linked to the murder
by specks of the girl's blood found on his sweatshirt.</LD>
<LD>   Tuite's attorney said he will seek to shift attention to three
teenagers once charged in the case.</LD>

<LD>The state Senate on Thursday narrowly passed a bill to extend the
bicycle safety helmet law to children under 18 who ride skateboards,
inline and roller skates, and scooters. The parents of violators
would be fined $25 per offense.</LD>
<LD>   Without debate and with little discussion, the bill, SB 1924, by
Sen. Jack O'Connell (D-San Luis Obispo) was approved on a 21-15 vote,
the bare margin required. The Assembly will take it up next.</LD>

<LD>California State University trustees Wednesday approved raising
tuition for out-of-state students by nearly 15%, the first fee hike
for the system since 1994.</LD>
<LD>   If approved by the Legislature, tuition for a
non-California-resident student taking a full course load would rise
from $7,380 a year to $8,460, beginning this fall, Cal State
officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The fee hike, which had been widely anticipated, would affect
about 10,000 of the Cal State system's 390,000 students and would
generate $11.8 million a year, officials said. Fees for in-state
students were not changed.</LD>

<LD>A state agency has ordered a condominium association to pay $18,000
for refusing to let a dog live with its disabled owners.</LD>
<LD>   The Fair Employment and Housing Commission found that the Auburn
Woods I Homeowners' Assn. discriminated against Ed and Jayne Elebiari
for not letting them keep Pookie, a terrier mix, as a companion
animal.</LD>
<LD>   The couple said they suffered from severe depression, and after
Jayne Elebiari rescued Pookie from a shelter in 1999, their health
improved. Ed Elebiari has been disabled since 1992, when he was
involved in an automobile accident that required three brain
surgeries.</LD>

<LD>After 16 days and 102 witnesses, the prosecution rested its case
against murder defendant David Attias, who is on trial for allegedly
running down five Isla Vista pedestrians, killing four of them.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant Dist. Atty. Patrick McKinley on Tuesday questioned his
final witness, California Highway Patrol Sgt. David Robertson, who
supervised the extensive investigation. The prosecutor told jurors
that Attias, 20, intentionally ran over the victims.</LD>
<LD>   Attias' attorneys will begin calling witnesses Monday in an effort
to establish an insanity defense. He could be sentenced to life in
prison if convicted on the nine felony counts with which he's
charged.</LD>

<HD>SAT, ACT Officials Tell of Changes to Satisfy UC</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Representatives of the SAT and ACT college admissions tests briefed
University of California regents on possible changes to meet UC
demands, including adding writing samples to the exams.</LD>
<LD>   The regents, meeting this week at UCLA, appeared satisfied with
the proposals, and a faculty representative said the willingness of
the test-makers to change their products means UC will not have to
develop its own admissions test.</LD>
<LD>   The regents are not expected to vote on the issue until July at
the earliest. Any change would not affect students until the class
entering in 2006. The proposals stem from a call by UC President
Richard C. Atkinson last year for the university to stop using the
SAT in its admissions.</LD>
<TE>   In March, representatives of the College Board, which owns the
SAT, said they might beef up the math section, add a writing sample
and replace the analogies portion with questions measuring analytical
reading skills.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Ferguson, president of Iowa-based ACT Inc., told the
regents fewer changes would be required in the curriculum-based test,
but said an essay would be added to meet the UC's needs.</TE>

<LD>San Juan Capistrano officials took the first step this week toward
construction of the town's first public high school in four decades.</LD>
<LD>   The Planning Commission this week recommended that the school be
built in the hills on the eastern edge of the city and that
Whispering Hills, an accompanying upscale housing tract, be scaled
back.</LD>
<LD>   The tract should be no larger than 155 units, less than half the
356 homes that developer Dennis Gage had proposed, city officials
agreed.</LD>
<TE>   "This analysis has been exhausting and exhaustive," said Larry
Lawrence, consulting project manager for the city.</TE>
<TE>   The developer had asked for permission to build 356 homes in the
foothills east of Interstate 5. An alternative called for 193 homes
and a high school.</TE>
<TE>   A citizens group against large-scale development in the hills is
urging the city to consider an even more scaled-down version--103
homes and a high school--that would spare one of the two canyons that
would be affected by Whispering Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The project will go before the City Council on Tuesday, but city
staff is advising the council to delay a vote until June 4 to permit
time for more study.</TE>
<TE>   The envisioned high school, which would be called San Juan Hills,
is scheduled to open in 2005. Capistrano Union High School, a block
from the historic mission in the center of town, closed in 1963. The
new school is being financed in part by a $65-million bond approved
in 1999.</TE>

<HD>Secession Casts Pall on L.A.'s Credit</HD>
<DH>Finances: Bond firm finds outlook no longer stable, an
indication that investor ratings for city could drop after a
municipal breakup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing uncertainty caused by the secession campaign, a leading bond
firm on Thursday changed its forecast for Los Angeles' credit
standing from stable to negative, an indication that investor ratings
for the city could drop after a municipal breakup.</LD>
<LD>   The outlook report by Fitch Ratings does not lower the
higher-than-average AA rating on $840 million in city general
obligation bonds. But it warns investors that Los Angeles could have
more trouble paying its debts if the San Fernando Valley, harbor area
or Hollywood secedes.</LD>
<LD>   "We believe that if secession occurred it would create much
uncertainty regarding the city's credit quality," said Amy S.
Doppelt, managing director for the firm.</LD>
<TE>   Doppelt said the report charts the direction a bond rating would
likely take over one to two years but added it does not mean a
downgrade is inevitable. Much depends on whether voters approve
secession and, if approved, how well the new and old cities address
any financial problems that result, she said.</TE>
<TE>   If Los Angeles' bond rating is eventually lowered--a prospect
secession supporters discount--the city could be charged millions
more in interest costs on borrowed money because it would be
considered a higher debt risk. The city borrows by issuing bonds.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said they could not precisely estimate the cost of
a lower bond rating.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn called on the Local Agency Formation
Commission, which is considering placing the three secession
proposals before voters in November, to examine how much harm a lower
bond rating would cause Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Even before this is on the ballot it is already hurting Los
Angeles," Hahn said. "Clearly, Fitch is not buying LAFCO's analysis
of how Los Angeles is going to be hurt by secession."</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO Executive Director Larry Calemine has determined that the
Valley would do well financially as an independent city, without
inflicting fiscal harm on the rest of Los Angeles. He has made a
similar, preliminary finding for Hollywood cityhood.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine has concluded that the harbor area would not survive
financially on its own, though he is still examining that question.
The LAFCO board has yet to adopt Calemine's financial reports.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Close, chairman of the secession group Valley VOTE, said
the Fitch forecast is premature because the terms of a breakup have
not been completed. Those terms will include the amount of money a
breakaway city would pay Los Angeles in so-called alimony.</TE>
<TE>   Close said state law requires Los Angeles and any new city to
honor all debts after a secession.</TE>
<TE>   Others on Wall Street are taking a wait-and-see stance.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's Investor Service has maintained its "stable" outlook on
Los Angeles, though it is watching LAFCO's actions closely.</TE>
<TE>   "If secession happens, it won't be good for the city's credit
quality, but it won't necessarily result in a downgrade," Moody's
Eric Hoffmann said.</TE>

likely take over one to two years but does added it does not mean a
downgrade is inevitable. Much depends on whether voters approve
secession and, if approved, how well the new and old cities address
any financial problems that result, she said.</TE>
<TE>   If Los Angeles' bond rating is eventually lowered--a prospect
secession supporters discount--the city could be charged millions
more in interest costs on borrowed money because it would be
considered a higher debt risk. The city borrows by issuing bonds.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said they could not precisely estimate the cost of
a lower bond rating.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn called on the Local Agency Formation
Commission, which is considering placing the three secession
proposals before voters in November, to examine how much harm a lower
bond rating would cause Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Even before this is on the ballot it is already hurting Los
Angeles," Hahn said. "Clearly, Fitch is not buying LAFCO's analysis
of how Los Angeles is going to be hurt by secession."</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO Executive Director Larry Calemine has determined that the
Valley would do well financially as an independent city, without
inflicting fiscal harm on the rest of Los Angeles. He has made a
similar, preliminary finding for Hollywood cityhood.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine has concluded that the harbor area would not survive
financially on its own, though he is still examining that question.
The LAFCO board has yet to adopt Calemine's financial reports.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Close, chairman of the secession group Valley VOTE, said
the Fitch forecast is premature because the terms of a breakup have
not been completed.</TE>
<TE>   Those terms will include the amount of money a breakaway city
would pay Los Angeles in so-called alimony.</TE>
<TE>   Close said state law requires Los Angeles and any new city to
honor all debts after a secession.</TE>
<TE>   Others on Wall Street are taking a wait-and-see stance.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's Investor Service has maintained its "stable" outlook on
Los Angeles, though it is watching LAFCO's actions closely.</TE>
<TE>   "If secession happens, it won't be good for the city's credit
quality, but it won't necessarily result in a downgrade," Moody's
Eric Hoffmann said.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Endorses Downtown Stadium Plan</HD>
<DH>Sports: No city funds can be used, he warns. Help in
getting land is what's needed, backers say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA and MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn said Thursday that he strongly supports a
proposal by private developers to build a pro football stadium in
downtown Los Angeles--as long as the city does not foot the bill.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm really excited about bringing the NFL back to Los Angeles,"
Hahn said at a news conference at Staples Center with stadium
developers Tim Leiweke, Casey Wasserman and Ed Roski. "The plan you
outlined represents the best chance we have to do that."</LD>
<LD>   The three partners, with supermarket mogul Ron Burkle, have
proposed a $450-million, 64,000-seat stadium on 20 acres in the South
Park neighborhood, close to Staples. National Football League
officials have said that they are eager to get a team back in Los
Angeles, which has lost both the Rams and the Raiders.</LD>
<TE>   Councilwoman Jan Perry, whose district includes South Park, said a
stadium would help revitalize downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "Things were good when we finished the [Staples] arena, and
they're about to get better," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As city attorney, Hahn worked with Leiweke and his Anschutz
Entertainment Group on the creation of Staples Center, a
public-private partnership that cost the city $12 million--a fraction
of what most cities pay for a new sports arena.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the Staples model. There's no risk to taxpayers, no
increased taxes and no risk to the general fund," Hahn said. "We came
up with a different way of doing things."</TE>
<TE>   The developers reiterated that the city will pay nothing for the
football stadium. "The assistance we need out of the city is
acquiring land," Leiweke said.</TE>
<TE>   The developers already have acquired much of the land they need,
but say they intend to ask the city to use its power of eminent
domain to condemn the property of any holdouts. They also hope to
finance the land purchase through up to $100 million in municipal
bonds, which would be repaid from a tax on tickets, along with sales
taxes and excess property taxes at the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke added that if tax revenue comes up short, the developers
are prepared to pay off the shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   The only city agency that has the power of eminent domain is the
Community Redevelopment Agency, whose officials have been somewhat
miffed about the handling of the football stadium proposal. Plans for
the stadium were announced just as the City Council was about to vote
on a new redevelopment district that includes the site of the
proposed stadium, giving rise to concerns that the redevelopment
plan--which is aimed at building new housing, eliminating blight and
helping the homeless--was a fig leaf for the football stadium.</TE>
<TE>   So far, CRA officials said, there has been no contact between the
agency and the stadium group.</TE>
<TE>   "A stadium is not part of our plans," Donald Spivack, deputy
administrator of the agency, said Wednesday. "We have no involvement
in a football stadium. We have not been part of any discussion
related to a football stadium."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, CRA officials declined to comment further, referring
questions about the stadium to the mayor's office.</TE>
<TE>   Stadium Would Be on 20 Acres</TE>
<TE>   The site of the stadium remained an open question, with Leiweke
and others refusing to discuss potential sites for fear of driving up
land-acquisition costs. The land is known to be within walking
distance of Staples Center--with which it would share parking--and a
Blue Line light-rail station at Pico Boulevard and Flower Street.</TE>
<TE>   At 20 acres, the site would be the equivalent of about four square
blocks.</TE>
<TE>   One area that seems to match the developers' hints surrounds Hope
Street at about 11th and 12th streets, just east of Staples, a
neighborhood dominated by parking lots, warehouses and "For Sale"
signs.</TE>
<TE>   Hoyt Leisure, who owns a 47,000-square-foot building in the 1100
block of Hope Street, has entered into escrow with a buyer he
declined to identify.</TE>
<TE>   The land was part of a proposal for a South Park stadium years ago
that died after backers dropped the site in favor of the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Although the neighborhood's charms are mostly utilitarian, Joe
Berger, who owns a wholesale shoe business that rents space from
Leisure, said he would hate to see it razed to make way for a
football stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "I just can't see it here," said Berger, who has been a tenant for
two decades. "It would kill the area."</TE>
<TE>   The city's chief administrative officer, Bill Fujioka, said
municipal officials have not yet had a chance to study financing
proposals for the stadium. He said, however, that it should be
possible to structure the financing in a way that guarantees that the
city will be fully reimbursed, regardless of the success of the
stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the position taken by the mayor," he said, "it looks like
the direction we'll be taking."</TE>
<TE>   Eugene Grigsby, director of the Advanced Policy Institute at UCLA,
agreed that it should be possible for the city to avoid spending
taxpayer money on a new stadium, although he noted that it would be a
rare achievement. Most large sports stadiums and arenas built in the
United States in recent years have involved significant public
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Grigsby said he was less concerned with the financial risks than
with the urban policy implications of the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "It may pencil out," he said. "The bigger question is, do you want
this big, 60,000-seat monster sitting unoccupied 70% of the time in
downtown Los Angeles?"</TE>
<TE>   The developers have said the stadium would be used about 30 to 40
days a year, depending on whether the city lands one or two NFL
teams.</TE>
<TE>   Besides pro football, they hope to attract a college
team--presumably UCLA--as well as international soccer matches,
concerts and other events.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in San Diego, business leaders were scrambling to find
ways to keep the Chargers, one team being considered as a possible
Los Angeles franchise, from leaving.</TE>
<TE>   Biotechnology executive Ted Roth said a committee of San Diego
Chamber of Commerce members is looking to see if it is possible to
answer the Chargers' request for a new stadium. But Roth conceded
that time may be running out.</TE>
<TE>   ''We may not be able to put something together quickly enough, but
at least we can say we tried,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   And Mayor Dick Murphy continues to be incredulous that the
Chargers could consider leaving San Diego: ''If I owned an NFL team,
Los Angeles is the last place I'd move to."</TE>

<HD>Big Crowds Expected for Strawberry Festival</HD>
<DH>Event: The annual celebration in Oxnard takes place this
weekend, with plenty of food and a variety of musical acts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If a "strawberry-choco-taco" is what you have been craving, this is
your weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The 19th annual California Strawberry Festival runs Saturday and
Sunday in Oxnard, coming just as this year's strawberry season peaks
and paying homage to Ventura County's second-largest cash crop behind
lemons.</LD>
<LD>   Music, children's activities, arts and crafts, a wine pavilion and
lots of berry-laced food will be on deck both days from 10 a.m. to
6:30 p.m. at College Park, 3250 S. Rose Ave. Saturday's musical
lineup includes salsa and country groups, an Elvis impersonator and
Richard Street of the Temptations. Sunday's includes a Beatles
tribute, Latin rock and Christopher Cross.</LD>
<TE>   More than 57,000 people attended last year's celebration, and at
least that many are expected this weekend. The National Weather
Service in Oxnard predicts low clouds in the mornings and evenings
but sunny afternoons with temperatures in the high 60s.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers this year have moved the festival's food court to
create more space near the amphitheater and improve the flow of foot
traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Other changes include admission discounts for military personnel
with photo IDs and a new interactive bus exhibit for children.
Sponsored by Gull Wings Children's Museum in Oxnard, the bus has
areas where children can paint their faces and dig for faux fossils.</TE>
<TE>   The festival's scholarship programs have grown, with the creation
last fall of a $25,000 endowment at Cal State Channel Islands for
Ventura County students who work in a strawberry-related industry or
have parents who do.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo High School's athletic booster club will be slapping
together sweet tacos at one of the festival's 40 food booths.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard's new Pacifica High School is rolling out this nacho
recipe: Fried flour tortilla chips sprinkled with cinnamon, then
topped with whipped cream and--of course--sliced berries.</TE>
<TE>   California yields more strawberries than any place in the
world--$750 million worth last year. The Oxnard Plain is the state's
second-largest growing spot, behind the Watsonville-Salinas area.</TE>
<TE>   Strawberries brought in $186 million countywide in 2001, down from
the year before. But with 8,582 acres planted locally this
year--about 1,000 of those are new --and with months of mild
temperatures and clear skies, growers expect this year's numbers to
rebound.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been an excellent season," said festival Chairman Don
DeArmond, who runs a cooling and shipping business.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope that the future stays red for us."</TE>

<HD>Teacher's Binding of Pupil With Tape Is Probed</HD>
<DH>Education: Sixth-grader was gagged for talking. Despite
furor, his parents are forgiving of the act.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Alhambra teacher has been put on paid administrative leave after
taping a sixth-grader's mouth and binding his hands for talking too
much, district officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Barbara Cser, a mathematics teacher at Ramona Elementary School,
allegedly wrapped masking tape around the head and eyeglasses of the
student, 12-year-old Solomon Poch, on May 7. He was not injured,
according to a statement by Alhambra police.</LD>
<LD>   School administrators had Cser apologize to the boy in front of
the class the next day. She was put on administrative leave last week
while the district investigates the incident, said Natalie Lee
Gaither, spokeswoman for the Alhambra Unified School District.</LD>
<TE>   In response to a report filed by the school, Alhambra police will
also investigate to see if Cser committed any criminal violations.</TE>
<TE>   Cser could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The student's parents were not concerned about the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel the incident was the result of poor judgment made in a
joking environment," the boy's parents said in a written statement
translated by 18-year-old Victor Poch, Solomon's older brother. They
did not wish to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe there was no malice involved. We do not want to see a
good teacher and a school's name blemished because of an isolated
incident that does not truly reflect on how safe Ramona School really
is," the parents wrote.</TE>
<TE>   That didn't satisfy Peggy Tapia, whose daughter Sarah is in Cser's
class. "The teacher should have been removed immediately," said
Tapia, whose complaint triggered the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Other parents had differing opinions about the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "I never do this in my house with the children," said Mary Soto,
who has a second-grader in the school. "Nothing like this," she said,
crossing her wrists behind her back. "Not like a dog. They're not
animals."</TE>
<TE>   "It was crossing the line," said Marcel Adjibi, the father of a
first- and second-grader. "She had guidelines to follow. She was
trained. If she doesn't comply, she's not fit to teach."</TE>
<TE>   But Dolores Solis, whose daughter, Sara, is a third-grader at
Ramona, said she trusts the teachers at her daughter's school.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it was done out of meanness," she said.</TE>

<HD>Educators Cut Out Extras in Protest</HD>
<DH>Schools: Faculties in three O.C. districts protest stalled
contract talks by stopping all extracurricular work. Many say they
worked up to 55 hours a week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Until last month, Richard Glick's library study sessions were
considered somewhat of a tradition in his Advanced Placement calculus
class.</LD>
<LD>   Glick has been teaching the advanced math class at Aliso Niguel
High School in Aliso Viejo for seven years. He starts the
supplemental four-hour evening tutoring sessions each September,
offering them every three weeks or so in the fall, then two or three
times a week in the spring to help prepare the kids for the AP test.
Those who pass receive college credit for the class.</LD>
<LD>   And a few days before AP testing begins, he usually treats the
kids who attend, sometimes as many as 65, to pizza, an out-of-pocket
expense he hasn't minded--until now.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, Glick's teachers union and the Capistrano Unified
School District reached an impasse in contract negotiations, in which
the district's latest offer is a 1.2% increase in salaries and health
benefits combined. In protest, many of the union's 2,300 teachers
abandoned all extracurricular activities. Glick reluctantly gave up
his study sessions. Other teachers did the same. And that forced the
district to hire APEX Learning, an Internet service, to provide
tutoring for as many of its 3,538 AP students who want it, which
could cost the financially strapped district $30,000. AP testing ends
today.</TE>
<TE>   "We're putting our students first," said David Smollar, spokesman
for Capistrano Unified. "What would the union prefer we do--let the
students suffer?"</TE>
<TE>   The teachers, however, view it as a slap in the face.</TE>
<TE>   Many teachers say they work up to 15 hours more than the 40 hours
a week their contract requires--drafting exams, grading papers,
meeting with parents, chaperoning school events, coaching, tutoring.</TE>
<TE>   "By paying for something the teachers have been doing for free for
years ... the district has demonstrated that teacher volunteer labor
is really what keeps the district going," said Jim Corbett, who
teaches AP history at Capistrano Valley High School.</TE>
<TE>   Teacher contract negotiations have also stalled in the Irvine and
Saddleback Valley unified school districts, and faculty in those
districts have taken up the same "work-to-contract" protest.</TE>
<TE>   The breakdown comes at a time when all three districts are facing
budget shortfalls--the result of a weak economy and a $23.6-billion
gap in the state budget.</TE>
<TE>   "It does make it hard for teachers to continue fighting in the
face of program cuts," said Anne Caenn, Irvine Teachers Assn.
president. "But 25 out of 28 districts in the county have managed to
settle their contract disputes.... It just makes me wonder why our
district can't do the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Unified officials say they're limited in what they can
offer.</TE>
<TE>   "For teachers to say that they're not valued and that the district
is rolling in dough is nonsense," Smollar said. "The priority is to
provide for the students, so if the district has to scramble to find
the money to help students prepare for exams because the teachers are
refusing to do it, then that's what we're going to do."</TE>

<HD>Seeking to Arrest Immigrants' Fear of Police</HD>
<DH>Program aims to educate Vietnamese about U.S. justice and
explain ethnic group's culture to officers.</DH>

<LD>A Vietnamese-born woman who thought she had witnessed a home invasion
robbery asked if she should have called police, since in her homeland
she didn't trust law enforcement officials.</LD>
<LD>   Another wondered if the constant beatings she'd received from her
husband here were normal, because there was no law back in Vietnam
protecting women from such abuse. And a local businessman wanted to
know how to detect fraudulent checks, since all his transactions in
Vietnam had been in cash.</LD>
<LD>   These are just some of the legal questions posed by residents of
Orange County's Little Saigon, home to many of the 300,000 Vietnamese
Americans living in Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   And it's up to Linda Le to answer them.</TE>
<TE>   Le is coordinator of the Orange County district attorney's office
program designed to educate Vietnamese immigrants about how to report
crimes and where to go for help if they are victims.</TE>
<TE>   The Vietnamese Education Services Program, created in 1999, is
designed to break down stereotypes and apprehensions that some in the
Vietnamese community hold about law enforcement. Many Little Saigon
residents fled from the Communist regime in Vietnam, and some
maintain a distrust of police officers and government authority, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The toughest part about my job is getting people to open up to
you and trust you. When they hear you're from law enforcement, they
automatically shy away," said Le. "We know that no matter what, the
police officer is your first response. If they don't trust them, it's
going to be hard."</TE>
<TE>   The effort, funded with a $150,000 federal grant, includes a
50-member committee that was formed to discuss ways to tackle crime
in Little Saigon.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the program published a 60-page booklet in Vietnamese
listing phone numbers and tips for crime victims. Similar booklets
offering ways to avoid being victimized by home-invasion robberies
and immigration fraud will soon hit the printers. In June, a mock
trial will be held to educate the community about domestic abuse and
to make clear how the legal system works.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to observe so they don't get this fear [about the
system]," said Le, 29. Some immigrants are "so afraid that even
during jury duty, they don't come."</TE>
<TE>   Le spends her weekends at churches, passing out pamphlets and
explaining the program to those who will listen. Some just walk away
when they hear that she works for law enforcement. She attends the
Tet Festival, which attracts more than 100,000 people, to survey
immigrants about their crime fears. Focus group workshops are held
every month.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to understand what keeps them from working with
police," said Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas, who initiated the effort.</TE>
<TE>   Little Saigon is the focus of a major crackdown on organized
crime, ranging from illegal gambling to trademark infringement,
authorities say. An FBI crime survey of the area completed last year
reported activity by the Wah Ching gang--one of the best-known Asian
crime groups, with links to 300-year-old criminal societies in Hong
Kong. The survey also found that businesses in Little Saigon were
victims of protection rackets and extortion by organized syndicates.</TE>
<TE>   One of the challenges in dealing with crime in the Vietnamese
community is the culture of the immigrants, who come from a society
without trademark laws and where knockoff fashions are common,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   One goal of the district attorney's program is to help law
enforcement become more sensitive to the community, which officials
hope will in turn result in more cooperation. Le plans to spearhead a
class to teach police officers, attorneys and administrators about
Vietnamese culture.</TE>
<TE>   "We're training law enforcement in crime issues, like how to
respond to a Vietnamese victim in a car accident and how to approach
them," Le said.</TE>
<TE>   Commission member Cuong Cao, director of a Garden Grove-based
community service organization that promotes education and Vietnamese
arts, said the program has many good intentions.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no other program like this out there," Cao said. "It's
needed in our community, because some people don't understand the
law."</TE>
<TE>   But some members said they are disappointed and even losing
interest because they believe that the program hasn't reached the
audience it targets and that bureaucracy limits its potential.</TE>
<TE>   Some on the commission, made up of community leaders and business
owners, don't have time to volunteer. The volunteer group has
dwindled to 29 active members who now meet every two or three months,
rather than once a month, members said.</TE>
<TE>   Members hope to see more organization and involvement since being
notified that there will be funding to air public service
announcements on local Vietnamese language media, which play a major
communication role in the community.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said it's too early to determine whether their efforts
will prove successful. But he said it only takes a few people to make
a difference.</TE>
<TE>   "As people feel more comfortable with law enforcement and they
become more of a partnership, we're a lot more able to crack crimes,"
he said. "It doesn't take a thousand people. It only takes a few."</TE>

<HD>Abortion Foes Are Ruled a Threat</HD>
<DH>Court: 'Wanted' posters labeling doctors 'baby butchers'
are not protected by the 1st Amendment, U.S. appellate judges find.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Internet Web site and "wanted" posters created by militant
abortion foes were real threats to doctors and the clinics where they
worked and are not protected by the 1st Amendment, a federal appeals
court ruled Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "While advocating violence is protected" under the 1st Amendment,
"threatening a person with violence is not," Judge Pamela A. Rymer
wrote for the sharply divided court.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-5 decision came in a closely watched case that has been seen
as a test of how far courts will permit anti-abortion activists to
go. The ruling is binding in California and eight other Western
states.</LD>
<TE>   In 1999, four doctors who had been pictured on Wild West-style
wanted posters that labeled them "baby butchers," along with Planned
Parenthood and a clinic in Portland, Ore., won a $107-million jury
verdict and an injunction against anti-abortion activists.</TE>
<TE>   The injunction barred the activists from continuing to put up the
posters. Also at issue in the case was a Web site called "the
Nuremberg Files" that contained a list of doctors who provided
abortions, including in some instances their photos, address, car
license plate numbers and names of family members.</TE>
<TE>   The doctors were the first to win damages and an injunction under
the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinics Act, which bars the use of
force or threats of force to prevent access to abortion clinics.</TE>
<TE>   The four doctors filed suit after three other abortion providers
who had been named in wanted posters were shot and killed.</TE>
<TE>   The Web site featured the murdered doctors on a list of people
guilty of crimes against humanity. The names of doctors who had been
murdered were shown crossed off the list. The names of those who had
been shot and wounded were grayed.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants--13 individuals and two organizations, the American
Coalition of Life Activists and Advocates for Life
Ministries--denounced the ruling for restricting their free speech
rights and said they would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is another stop on the continuing exodus from the
1st Amendment in this nation," said Paul deParrie, one of the
defendants.</TE>
<TE>   DeParrie used to edit the magazine published by the Portland-based
Life Ministries group, which carried articles defending the murder of
abortion providers as a tool to protect the unborn.</TE>
<TE>   DeParrie said the organization had been forced to shut down after
the huge damage judgment in the Portland case, but he said he
continues to protest at clinics where abortions are performed.</TE>
<TE>   Neal Horsley, a Carrollton, Ga., computer programmer who operates
the Nuremberg Files Web site, was anything but cowed.</TE>
<TE>   "It strikes me that I am going to have to make some changes. I am
going to have to add six more bloody baby butchering judges to the
Nuremberg Files list," Horsley said.</TE>
<TE>   A day after the jury verdict in 1999, an Internet service provider
in Atlanta shut down the site. But Horsley has kept the site running,
using a server in South Africa and four others in places he declined
to name.</TE>
<TE>   Horsley is not a named defendant in the case, and it is unclear
how the ruling will affect him.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of abortion rights, meanwhile, hailed the decision,
saying it would afford protection to abortion providers.</TE>
<TE>   "The anti-choice people had reason to know the doctors would feel
threatened by the posters," said James F. Newhall, one of the
plaintiffs who said he has been performing abortions in Oregon since
1989.</TE>
<TE>   Newhall said he became very frightened in 1994 when he learned
from an FBI agent "a wanted poster had gone up with my name on it."</TE>
<TE>   By then, he said, four doctors whose names had appeared on prior
posters had been murdered.</TE>
<TE>   "I got involved in the lawsuit because I wanted to stop the
violence, and it appears that this has been successful. Not one
doctor has been murdered since the trial," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The last slaying of an abortion provider, that of Dr. Barnett
Slepian who was killed by a sniper near Buffalo, N.Y., came a few
months before the Portland trial began.</TE>
<TE>   Vicki Saporta, president of the National Abortion Federation, said
she thought a variety of factors--including the Portland lawsuit and
a task force launched by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and maintained by
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft--had contributed to a reduction in violence
at abortion clinics.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this decision is important for the continued protection
of abortion providers throughout the country," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The case has been in the appeals process for several years. In
March 2001, a three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals overturned the jury verdict, ruling that the anti-abortion
materials were protected speech.</TE>
<TE>   That ruling caused an outcry by supporters of abortion rights,
including 40 members of Congress. In October, the full 9th Circuit,
based in San Francisco, decided to reconsider the case, setting the
stage for Thursday's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's decision upheld the injunction against the
anti-abortion groups. But the 9th Circuit majority sent the case back
to District Judge Robert E. Jones to reexamine the size of the
punitive damage award.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling in Planned Parenthood of the Columbia/Willamette vs.
American Coalition of Life Activists featured an unusual ideological
division.</TE>
<TE>   Rymer, who was appointed by the first President Bush, was joined
in the majority by one appointee of President Carter and four
appointees of President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   The dissenters, who argued that the anti-abortion posters and Web
site were protected by the Constitution's free speech guarantees,
included two of the court's most liberal judges and three of its more
conservative members.</TE>
<TE>   "The defendants have not murdered anyone," wrote Judge Marsha
Berzon, one of the dissenters.</TE>
<TE>   "Neither their advocacy of doing so nor the posters and Web site
they published crossed the line into unprotected speech," she added.</TE>
<TE>   "If we are not willing to provide stringent 1st Amendment
protection ... to those with whom we as a society disagree as well as
those with whom we agree ... the 1st Amendment will become a dead
letter."</TE>
<TE>   Berzon, a Clinton appointee, was joined by Judge Stephen
Reinhardt, a Carter appointee, and three judges appointed by
presidents Reagan and Bush--Alex Kozinski, Diarmuid O'Scannlain and
Andrew J. Kleinfeld.</TE>
<TE>   Defining a 'True Threat'</TE>
<TE>   The central issue dividing the judges is what constitutes an
illegal "true threat," as distinct from vociferous advocacy that is
protected by the 1st Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   Rymer said the definition of a true threat is a statement that the
maker of the threat would know would be perceived by the recipient
"as a serious expression of intent to inflict bodily harm to that
person."</TE>
<TE>   Rymer said there was considerable evidence that the wanted posters
were an attempt to intimidate doctors.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence showed a pattern in which after three wanted posters
appeared, the physicians on them--David Gunn, George Patterson and
John Britton--were shot and killed. After these murders, Rymer said,
the American Coalition of Life Activists published "guilty" posters
in essentially the same format naming the four doctors who sued.</TE>
<TE>   Kozinski, in dissent, said he had no quarrel with that definition
of a true threat. But the majority failed to apply its own
definition, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Neither Dr. Gunn nor Dr. Patterson was killed by anyone connected
with the posters bearing their names," Kozinski said.</TE>
<TE>   The man who killed Dr. Britton participated in making a poster
naming Britton but was not a defendant in this case, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "All others who helped to make that poster, as well as those who
prepared the other posters, did not resort to violence," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "A true threat warns of violence or other harm that the speaker
controls," Kozinski wrote, and that was not the case here, he said.
Past U.S. Supreme Court decisions have said that a threat must be
explicit and likely to cause "imminent lawless action," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling marked the first time that the 9th Circuit had ever
found that a statement made in a public forum constituted a "true
threat" that was not entitled to 1st Amendment protection, Kozinski
added.</TE>
<TE>   Reinhardt also stressed that point. "It is a fundamental tenet of
First Amendment jurisprudence that political speech in a public arena
is different than purely private speech directed at an individual,"
he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Political speech, ugly or frightening as it may sometimes be,
lies at the heart of our democratic process. Private threats
delivered one-on-one do not. The majority's unwillingness to
recognize the difference is extremely troublesome," he wrote.</TE>

<HD>Harbor Plan Has Herons Out on Limb</HD>

boating facility, but critics say it would disturb one of area's few
known nesting sites for the birds.</DH>

<LD>Bicyclists slow down, dog-walkers look up, stroller-pushing parents
stop and point: Craning their necks, anyone on the path bordering
Channel Islands Harbor can take in a flock of immense birds preening
atop the evergreens on a grassy strip beside the water.</LD>
<LD>   For at least 20 years, the trees have been home to what some
experts say is one of Ventura County's few known nesting sites for
great blue herons and black-crowned night herons.</LD>
<LD>   Now they are also the focus of a conflict pitting neighborhood
residents against Ventura County officials who are planning a
20,000-square-foot boating facility for the narrow strip of parkland
just north of the Whale's Tail restaurant.</LD>
<TE>   Relying on about $4.2 million from the state and $1.8 million in
local funds, officials see the building invigorating the county-run
harbor, now dotted by empty storefronts and languishing restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Completion is scheduled for 2005. Classes would be offered in
sailing, kayaking and rowing to students from local schools and the
new Cal State Channel Islands. Also offered would be programs in
marine education--a point that the project's critics view as ironic.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be unfortunate if some of the very resources the center
was committed to educating the public about were destroyed by
building the center," wrote Morgan Wehtje, a state Department of Fish
and Game biologist, in a letter to county officials.</TE>
<TE>   This week the county's plan ran into renewed opposition from the
agency that serves as a town board for the unincorporated
neighborhoods around the harbor. The Channel Islands Beach Community
Services District already had told county officials the building
would be a good addition to the harbor--at one of six other sites.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the district's board demanded a full-blown
environmental impact report, rejecting the county's claim the project
would cause only negligible environmental damage.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran yachtsmen at the board's meeting also questioned the
site's safety.</TE>
<TE>   "It's totally insane from a safety standpoint," said Mark Gray,
whose boating safety TV show ran for three years on The Learning
Channel. Prevailing winds could sweep novice sailors into heavy
boating traffic, Gray said, while a site across the harbor would keep
them out of harm's way.</TE>
<TE>   County officials say the neighbors' fears are overblown.</TE>
<TE>   Lyn Krieger, the harbor director, said the harbor's ample food
supply will keep the herons around, if in other trees.</TE>
<TE>   "They came in because of the food source and they'll stay because
of the food source," she said, citing opinions from consulting
biologists. Construction is to start in August 2003 and will be done
to keep interference with nesting at a minimum, she said.</TE>
<TE>   With a 6-foot wing span, great blue herons are among the largest
water birds in North America. The birds are believed to nest in
secluded spots at Lake Casitas and the mouth of the Santa Clara
River.</TE>
<TE>   But the harbor site, in trees wedged between a restroom building
and a parking lot, is the only documented rookery in Ventura County,
Wehtje said.</TE>
<TE>   Krieger also expressed skepticism about the safety objections.</TE>
<TE>   "You never want a novice sailor blown back into the dock once
they've left," she said. "You always want them blown outward."</TE>
<TE>   While the county's plan seems to generate little enthusiasm around
the harbor, restaurant owner Michael Koutnik suggested that opponents
simply fear change.</TE>
<TE>   "If this had been built 20 years ago, they would have lived along
with it and it would have been the greatest thing since sliced
bread," said Koutnik, whose Whale's Tail would be one of the
restaurants closest to the center.</TE>
<TE>   But opponents at this week's meeting were more specific.</TE>
<TE>   The center's main building--50% larger than the Whale's
Tail--would block views from nearby homes, they said, while sites
across the harbor would not.</TE>
<TE>   But Krieger disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Not a single location won't block someone's view," she said,
adding "there's no guarantee when you locate across from a commercial
facility that your view will be uninterrupted forever."</TE>
<TE>   The county's "mitigated negative declaration"--a report concluding
that the project would have little environmental effect--is
inadequate, opponents contend.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is there no environmental impact report?" asked Trevor Smith,
a resident leading the opposition. "This has to be viewed in the full
context of other projects planned in the harbor."</TE>
<TE>   In its declaration, the county soft-pedals traffic to the center,
opponents contend. The documents state the facility would generate
just 35 to 40 trips daily.</TE>
<TE>   It also states the herons could be saved by sparing as many trees
as possible during construction and planting new ones nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Wehtje of the state Department of Fish and Game said that such
measures "wouldn't even come close" to helping the herons.</TE>
<TE>   "You could do that if you knew you weren't going to build for,
say, 10 years," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, she said, the colony would be disrupted, some birds
would die and others would not reproduce for years.</TE>
<TE>   Herons are known for their "nest-site fidelity," she said,
predicting that birds from the colony of dozens would scatter and
cause the flock to permanently thin.</TE>
<TE>   Residents intend to show up in force when Ventura County
supervisors consider the issue on June 18.</TE>
<TE>   Before that, Supervisor John Flynn, who represents the area, plans
to meet with several concerned residents and county planners.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope we can work this out," he said, adding that harbor revenue
has been dwindling.</TE>
<TE>   "Since 1985, there have been a series of problems that almost
killed the spirit of the harbor," he said. "We've got to turn that
around."</TE>

<LD>In the weeks leading up to an Ironman race, world champion
triathletes Heather Fuhr and Lori Bowden endure grueling training
sessions. But almost as important as the training they do together is
the time they spend recovering--preferably while watching "The Young
and the Restless."</LD>
<LD>   Fuhr and Bowden rank second and third in Ironman titles with 11
and nine respectively. Just because they are two of the best in the
sport doesn't mean they can't also be the best of friends.</LD>
<LD>   "Because our races are so long and we spend many many hours
training, we tend to enjoy the company of others that do the same
thing and can relate to us," Fuhr said. "... While she's an intense
competitor, we still have so much fun together."</LD>
<TE>   They are two of four world champions competing in Sunday's Ralph's
California Half Ironman in Oceanside, beginning at 7 a.m. World
champion Tim DeBoom (Boulder, Colo.) and former world champion Luc
van Lierde (Belgium) round out that field.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's competition, which includes a 1.2-mile swim, a 56-mile
bike ride and a half marathon (13.1 miles), is the first Ironman
North America event of the 2002 season.</TE>
<TE>   Fuhr and Bowden have been close friends for the last five years.
For the past few weeks, Bowden, who resides in Victoria, Canada, has
been staying and training with Fuhr in San Diego. Fuhr relocated to
Southern California from Canada in 1995 for better year-round
training conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Fuhr and Bowden train well together because of their similar
abilities. Both women ran in college--Bowden for the University of
Toronto and Fuhr for the University of Alberta--and both excel in
that phase of competition. Swimming is their weaker part of
competition. But beyond their physical similarities, the two are in
tune with each other.</TE>
<TE>   "We know what to do and we just do it. Sometimes when you're with
other people, it may turn into a race," Fuhr said, "but with Lori, we
know what the purpose of a workout is. If it's a hard bike ride--we
go do a hard bike ride. You don't have to think about it."</TE>
<TE>   Bowden, who trains by herself when she's at home, looks forward to
training with Fuhr because they push each other.</TE>
<TE>   It helps make the intense days--which may consist of a 90-minute
to two-hour swim, a five- to seven-hour bike ride and a 45-minute to
one-hour run--go by a little faster.</TE>
<TE>   "It's motivating to be out together," Bowden said. "We're the same
speed in everything we do, so it takes the guess work out of
everything."</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Wells would have done just fine with one run. The New York
Yankees decided to give him a lot more.</LD>
<LD>   After Alfonso Soriano hit a leadoff homer on the first pitch,
Wells and the Yankees were on their way, overwhelming the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays, 13-0, Thursday night at New York.</LD>
<LD>   With Wells (6-1) pitching a three-hitter, the Yankees posted their
most lopsided shutout since beating Cleveland, 14-0, on April 18,
1992.</LD>
<TE>   "In my mind, I'm thinking it's 1-0," Wells said. "I have to psyche
myself out and just keeping pitching."</TE>
<TE>   Wells walked none and struck out six in his 11th shutout, first
since 2000. He retired the first 10 hitters, winning a day shy of the
four-year anniversary of his perfect game against Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   "I had everything working," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Posada, Nick Johnson and Bernie Williams kept up New York's
early home-run barrage. The Yankees lead the majors with 62 homers,
including 14 in four games.</TE>
<TE>   A night after Tampa Bay got six runs in the top of the first, the
Yankees scored six times in the bottom half. Tampa Bay hurt itself,
tying a team record by making three errors in the inning.</TE>
<TE>   It was 11-0 after four innings and by then, every New York starter
had at least one hit.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 5, Boston 0--Barry Zito pitched five-hit ball for eight
innings at Boston as the A's won for only the third time in 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   Jermaine Dye hit a two-run double for Oakland, which avoided being
swept by Boston for the second week in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Koch finished the seven-hitter for Oakland's second shutout
of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Boston was blanked for the first time since Yankee pitcher Mike
Mussina came within one strike of a perfect game on Sept. 2 at Fenway
Park.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 15, Toronto 2--Mike Cameron hit a grand slam, and Mark
McLemore went five for five as the Mariners won another road game.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron's home run was his first since he tied a major league
record by hitting four on May 2 against the Chicago White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   McLemore's five hits matched a franchise record and equaled his
career high. He hit a three-run homer and also walked as the Mariners
improved to a major-league best 16-3 on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 4, Texas 0--Dan Wright pitched a five-hitter at Chicago
for his first career shutout.</TE>
<TE>   Wright (4-4), who gave up eight runs in 22/3 innings in his last
start against the Angels, was sharp against the Rangers. He struck
out four and walked one in his 21st start. Wright struck out Alex
Rodriguez to end Chicago's second shutout of the season. The Rangers
have been blanked twice.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 14, Kansas City 5--Torii Hunter homered twice at Kansas
City, Mo., and the Twins hit five home runs against the Royals for
the second time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Jacque Jones, Cristian Guzman and Tom Prince also homered for the
Twins, who added five doubles to set season highs in runs and hits
(18).</TE>
<TE>   Five of the Twins' nine road wins have come at Kauffman Stadium,
where Jones has hit five of his eight home runs. The Twins have hit
16 homers in 11 games against the Royals.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore at Cleveland--The game, the final scheduled meeting
between the teams this season, was rained out. No makeup date was
announced.</TE>

<HD>Appier Holds Option</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>With Kevin Appier and Aaron Sele signed through 2004 and Ramon Ortiz,
Scott Schoeneweis and Jarrod Washburn not eligible for free agency
before 2005, the Angels appear to have assembled a starting rotation
they could keep intact for several years.</LD>
<LD>   But Appier, whose 2.79 earned-run average ranks seventh in the
American League and who has lost once in his last 20 starts dating to
last summer, has the option to leave the Angels at the end of the
season.</LD>
<LD>   The New York Mets traded him to the Angels in December for Mo
Vaughn, one year after Appier signed a four-year, $42-million
contract with the Mets. As a player traded in the midst of a
multiyear contract, Appier retains the right to demand a trade at the
end of the season.</LD>
<TE>   "It's extremely, extremely, extremely unlikely that I would
exercise it," Appier said Thursday, before the Angels' game against
the Tigers was rained out. "I like it here. A lot would have to
change for me to do something like that.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't happy to be leaving New York. I signed there because I
wanted to play there. But, if I had to go someplace, this was cool,
especially after they signed Aaron and Percy [closer Troy Percival].
That made me feel a lot better about it."</TE>
<TE>   If Appier were to demand a trade, the Angels would have to comply
by next March or allow Appier to declare himself a free agent. Some
teams avoid that dilemma by sweetening the player's contract in
exchange for a waiver of the right to demand a trade.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels did not entertain that option, said Jeff Borris, the
agent for Appier. According to Borris, General Manager Bill Stoneman
pointed out that Appier will turn 35 in December and said the club
would take its chances that a pitcher of that age would be unlikely
to find a better contract if he elected free agency. Appier will
receive $11 million next year and $12 million in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "If it comes up, we'll deal with it," Stoneman said. "It's not
something we're focused on."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels and Tigers sat through a four-hour rain delay before
Thursday's game was postponed.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'd have brought my guitar, I could have written a whole
album," first baseman Scott Spiezio said.</TE>
<TE>   The teams waited so long because the Angels are not scheduled to
return to Detroit this year. They could return on a one-day stop on
the way to Kansas City (July 10) or Chicago (Aug. 5), but Tiger
President Dave Dombrowski said there was a "strong chance" the game
could be made up with the Tigers in Anaheim Aug. 12-15.</TE>
<TE>   With rain expected in Chicago this weekend, the Angels sent
infielders Benji Gil (ankle) and Shawn Wooten (thumb) to their
Arizona training facility to continue workouts. While Wooten is
expected to get most of his playing time as a right-handed hitter in
place of Spiezio or designated hitter Brad Fullmer, Manager Mike
Scioscia said Wooten also will practice at catcher and third base.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said the players could start minor league rehabilitation
assignments with triple-A Salt Lake as soon as next Friday and could
rejoin the Angels in two to three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel reliever Dennis Cook packed two souvenirs of his trip to
Comerica Park, a game ball and a snapshot.</TE>
<TE>   Cook got a game ball Wednesday, when he pitched in the 1,000th
inning of his career. Cook, 39, has pitched for nine teams since
making his major league debut in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it's a major milestone," he said. "It shows you persevered
and stuck around."</TE>
<TE>   Cook also had his picture taken with the Tigers' Hall of Fame
announcer, Ernie Harwell, 84, who is retiring after the season. Such
baseball legends as Vin Scully and Negro League hero Buck O'Neil have
preceded Harwell into Cook's small memorabilia collection.</TE>
<TE>   "He's one of the best announcers there is," Cook said. "He's
always friendly, and he always makes time for people. That's the kind
of guy whose picture I want on my wall."</TE>

<HD>Durazo Returns, Replaces Grace</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Erubiel Durazo, activated from the disabled list Thursday, will
replace Mark Grace as the Arizona Diamondbacks' everyday first
baseman.</LD>
<LD>   "The way Ruby played this spring, the way he played in his rehab,
it's very apparent that it's his time to show what he can do,"
Manager Bob Brenly said before Thursday night's game against
Philadelphia. "Gracy will still be a huge contributor to this
ballclub."</LD>
<LD>   Grace, who turns 38 on June 28, has been a starter throughout his
13-year major league career, but said he understands Brenly's
decision.</LD>
<TE>   "A big weapon is back now, and that's only going to help us,"
Grace said. "I'll come off the bench or play defense late, whatever
they want me to do."</TE>
<TE>   Durazo was hitting .535 with six homers, five doubles and 16 RBIs
in 16 games in spring training before breaking his wrist while
swinging at a pitch March 20 against San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Durazo will be a fixture in the cleanup spot in the batting order.</TE>
<TE>   Brenly has used seven players in the No. 4 spot this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Padres put slugger Phil Nevin on the 15-day disabled
list because of a sprained left elbow.</TE>
<TE>   The move was retroactive to Sunday, meaning the first baseman will
be eligible to be activated May 27, when the Padres open their next
home stand.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ken Griffey Jr. will remain out of the Reds' lineup until at least
next week as he recovers from an injured knee.</TE>
<TE>   "We're being cautious here," Cincinnati medical director Dr.
Timothy Kremchek said. "We don't want him to come back too soon."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Columbus Clipper Manager Brian Butterfield was fired and replaced
by former major league slugger Frank Howard on an interim basis.</TE>
<TE>   Howard, 65, has been a special assistant in the Yankee
organization.</TE>

<LD>It might not be safe to drive a Ford Explorer on Firestone tires--but
the tires have been deemed good enough for the Detroit Lions to play
on.</LD>
<LD>   Turns out the artificial turf in the Lions' new stadium will be
made partly from rubber derived from reclaimed Firestone tires.</LD>
<LD>   (Please, no jokes about the 2-14 Lions going from pushovers to
roll-overs.)</LD>
<TE>   The Lions are owned by William Clay Ford Sr., the father of the
auto maker's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., noted for his
commitment to reducing environmental impact. (Reportedly, none of the
millions of Firestone tires recalled and collected by Ford have been
sent to landfills.)</TE>
<TE>   Ford Field's "retread" playing surface will be produced by
FieldTurf, the same company that produced the artificial turf for the
New England Patriots' practice field, Ward's Auto World magazine
reported in a story picked up by the Detroit Free Press.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, not just any discarded tire is good enough to be
frozen, reduced to powder and mixed with silica sand to help produce
FieldTurf's synthetic grass.</TE>
<TE>   Reportedly, only 20% of the worn and discarded tires considered
met the company's standards.</TE>
<TE>   Headline alert: Even automobile industry reporters see the
potential here. From Eric Mayne of Ward's Auto World: "Detroit Ends
Losing Skid; Lions Win in Blowout."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Nine of the first 20 tournaments on the PGA Tour this
season have been won by golfers from countries other than the U.S.
What seven countries have produced winners? Extra credit for listing
the nine international players who have won tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   Uniform included: Want to pitch to Alex Rodriguez?</TE>
<TE>   The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports the Texas Rangers need
left-handers to throw batting practice before home games.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking for left-handers who can throw strikes, throw
straight and not hit anybody," bullpen catcher Nate Lasseter said.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, the Rangers and 29 other teams....</TE>
<TE>   No skinning this Shinn: Chris Shinn, one of Charlotte Hornet owner
George Shinn's three children, attended one of the final games in
Charlotte before the move to New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Though close to his father, he brought home 10 T-shirts with a
nasty reference to Shinn and minority owner Ray Wooldridge, both
reviled in Charlotte.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, that T-shirt is a collector's item," Chris Shinn, 27, a
musician who lives in Los Angeles, told the Charlotte Observer.
"You've got to know my family to understand why so many of them will
want one."</TE>
<TE>   Celtic spelling lesson: In light of that 66-64 game during
Boston's playoff series against Detroit, Randy Hill of Foxsports.com
called the Celtic coach "Jim 'Brien."</TE>
<TE>   "His team misplaced the O."</TE>
<TE>   The Piston performance also inspired Hill to update Detroit's
nickname--to "The Mortar City."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Spain (Sergio Garcia, Jose Maria Olazabal), Canada
(Ian Leggatt), South Africa (Ernie Els, Retief Goosen), New Zealand
(Craig Perks), Fiji (Vijay Singh), South Korea (K.J. Choi) and Japan
(Shigeki Maruyama).</TE>
<TE>   And finally: From Chris Shinn, son of the Hornet owner:</TE>
<TE>   "You know that TV show 'The Osbournes?' It reminds me a lot of our
family."</TE>

<HD>Northridge Earned Its Prime Position</HD>

<LD>Cal State Northridge needs two victories in a three-game series
against UC Irvine this weekend to clinch the Big West Conference
championship. If the Matadors win the title in their second season in
the conference, they can look back at two key instances that helped
determine their fate.</LD>
<LD>   On the weekend of April 26-28, Northridge (37-15, 16-5 in Big
West) went to Cal State Fullerton and swept three games from the
Titans to jump into first place. The 16th-ranked Matadors have never
relinquished the lead, winning 10 in a row at one time.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday is the other moment that stands out. Long Beach State had
gone to Northridge and stopped the Matadors' winning streak with two
lopsided victories. Fullerton (35-17, 14-7) had taken two games from
UC Riverside that weekend to pull within one game of Northridge in
Big West play before Sunday's games.</LD>
<TE>   Northridge trailed, 5-3, in the eighth inning Sunday before Tim
Arroyo hit a three-run home run and Rudy Simpson had a two-run double
during a seven-run rally that led to a 10-8 Matador victory.
Fullerton lost by the same score.</TE>
<TE>   Northridge Coach Mike Batesole refuses to think about what could
happen this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we're really concerned with Irvine," he said. "Any one
of five teams can finish strong and win the title. Irvine beats us
and sweeps next weekend, they win it."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine (31-22), made up of community college transfers and
freshmen, figured to be respectable. Without a program for nine
years, the Anteaters weren't expected to go 12-6 in their first 18
conference games and be in contention for a postseason berth.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just about playing hard and playing aggressive," said
Coach John Savage. "We have a ton of freshmen and they are getting a
ton of experience."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine relied on the pitching rotation of Glenn Swanson (8-4, 4.19
earned-run average), Brett Smith (4-1, 5.20), Sean Tracey (8-6, 4.10)
and Paul French (4-4, 3.77) to win early in the season. The offense
became a force in conference play. Center fielder Jon Horwitz and
first baseman Matt Anderson are tied for second in the league with
.392 averages.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC continues to hang on to the Pacific 10 Conference lead after
taking two of three from visiting Washington last weekend. The
19th-ranked Trojans (30-20, 13-5), who lost a 2-1, 11-inning
nonconference game Wednesday to Fullerton, lead No. 7 Stanford and
Washington by two games. They begin a three-game series tonight with
Arizona State in Tempe.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Reyes (4-0, 2.72), who will start tonight, is coming off
an eight-inning, one-run performance against the Huskies. But the
Trojans lost freshman pitcher J.P. Howell (3-4, 6.27 in 14
appearances), who left the team for personal reasons and is expected
to transfer.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford (35-15, 11-7) visits Jackie Robinson Stadium for a series
with UCLA (25-29, 8-10). The Bruins have won four of five and eight
of 12.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine (28-28, 16-11) swept a four-game weekend series against
St. Mary's to take the lead in the West Coast Conference's Coast
Division.</TE>
<TE>   After a midweek loss to Fullerton, the Waves put themselves in
position for the Coast title with hot hitting over the weekend by
Duke Sardinha. The junior, whose defensive problems at third base
prompted a move to right field, went 10 for 16 with two home runs and
10 runs batted in for the series. The Waves' magic number for
clinching a spot in the best-of-three WCC championship series next
week is two. They could get the division title today with a win at
Gonzaga and a Santa Clara loss to St. Mary's.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Marymount (20-33, 13-14 in West Division) finishes its
regular season at Portland after falling out of contention for the
division title last weekend.... Fullerton closer Chad Cordero (4-3,
3.22 ERA, 12 saves) and UCLA outfielder Adam Berry (16 homers, 45
RBIs) are among 40 semifinalists for the Dick Howser Trophy given to
the nation's top player by the National College Baseball Writers
Assn.... The NCBWA selected Long Beach's Paul McAnulty as its
national player of the week. Last week, McAnulty hit .467 with three
home runs and nine RBIs in four games.</TE>

<LD>Amanda Freed became the winningest pitcher in UCLA softball history
by throwing a one-hit shutout as the top-ranked Bruins defeated
Liberty, 3-0, in the first round of the NCAA regional playoffs
Thursday at Columbia, S.C.</LD>
<LD>   Freed, a senior, surpassed B'Ann Burns with her 97th career
victory. She struck out 10 and has 747 in her career, moving past
DeeDee Weiman into third place in Bruin history.</LD>
<LD>   Tairia Mims hit a two-run homer in the fifth inning, her 12th of
the season. UCLA (51-6) added another run in the sixth on a single by
Natasha Watley that scored Stephanie Ramos.</LD>
<TE>   Sixth-seeded Liberty (28-32) had the game's first scoring
opportunity when Mary Beth Kennell led off the third inning with a
single and reached third on an error and a sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda Goc hit a grounder to Freed, who threw to Mims at first for
the out. Kennell took off for home and Mims threw her out to end the
threat.</TE>
<TE>   In Fresno, Cal State Fullerton (51-11) took advantage of an
Evansville error in the sixth inning to score all three of its runs
in a 3-0 victory over the Aces. With one out and the bases loaded,
Evansville second baseman Haven Shank dropped a foul ball off the bat
of the Titans' Yasmin Mossadeghi.</TE>
<TE>   Mossadeghi hit into a fielder's choice to bring in Jodie Cox, and
Amy LaRocque's single scored Mossadeghi and Monica Lucatero.</TE>
<TE>   Cox gave up four hits and struck out five in improving to 18-4.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA claimed the doubles point and then got strong singles
performances from Sara Walker and Catherine Hawley to defeat USC,
4-1, in the third round of the NCAA women's tennis championships at
Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins (19-4) will play Georgia today in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Walker defeated Luana Magnani, 6-1, 6-2, and Hawley defeated
Melissa Esmero, 6-4, 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins' Lauren Fisher beat Tiffany Brymer, 2-6, 6-1, 7-2, and

eighth-inning rally with three bloop hits--one that drew chalk off
the left-field line--for a 4-3 come-from-behind victory over the
Montreal Expos on Thursday night, anything must seem possible to the
Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   A crowd of 21,408 in Dodger Stadium saw Chad Kreuter, a reserve
catcher with a .129 average, drop a lawn dart of a two-out RBI single
to right field to score Marquis Grissom with the winning run, ending
a string of eight games in which the Dodgers scored three runs or
fewer.</LD>
<TE>   Left-hander Omar Daal (4-0) struck out three of six batters in the
seventh and eighth innings to gain the victory, closer Eric Gagne
struck out two of three in the ninth for his 13th save, and third
baseman Adrian Beltre, moved from the seventh to second spot in the
order, and Grissom, the center fielder, each had three hits.</TE>
<TE>   "That was big," Daal said of the rally. "We were losing, and you
need to get runs any way you can. This was big for the team, the way
we scored those runs. We needed this game tonight."</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Eric Karros ended the Dodgers' 18-inning scoreless
streak with a two-out RBI single in the first inning and also sparked
the winning rally in the eighth with a leadoff bloop single to right.</TE>
<TE>   Cesar Izturis, who did not start at shortstop, came on as a
pinch-runner. Mark Grudzielanek, whose solo home run had pulled the
Dodgers within 3-2 in the sixth, popped to first, but Grissom,
fighting off an 0-2 pitch from Expo starter Tomo Ohka, flared a
double off the left-field line to score Izturis to make it 3-3.</TE>
<TE>   Hiram Bocachica struck out, and the pitcher's spot was next.
Dodger Manager Jim Tracy used reserve first baseman Dave Hansen as a
pinch-hitter in the sixth inning, so he had no choice but to hit
Kreuter, a move that would enable Tracy to shift catcher Paul Lo Duca
to first and use Kreuter behind the plate.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal Manager Frank Robinson, noting the switch-hitting
Kreuter's .154 average from the left side and .000 mark (0 for 5)
from the right side, countered with left-hander Graeme Lloyd. But
Kreuter foiled the strategy with his game-winning hit.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fun to get in there in that situation," Kreuter said.
"Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were neither lucky nor good in their previous two
games, managing four hits in shutout losses to the New York Mets, and
it was obvious the temperature in their dugout was rising.</TE>
<TE>   "You shouldn't get to a point where every inning you feel intense
pressure," Grudzielanek said. "You don't score, and every inning it's
like, 'Oh my God.' Before you know it, it's the sixth or seventh
inning, and you're pressing. Usually, it's one big inning that
triggers [the end of a slump]."</TE>
<TE>   It appeared the Dodgers would produce that inning in the fourth
when they loaded the bases with no outs, but Bocachica lined back to
the pitcher for a double play and starting pitcher Kevin Brown struck
out to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   They had two on with two out in the fifth, but center fielder Brad
Wilkerson made a running catch of Karros' drive to the gap in
left-center to end the inning. They failed to score after Grissom
doubled with no outs in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   After Beltre's leadoff single in the seventh, Green, who hasn't
hit a ball out of the infield in four games, grounded into his 12th
double play of the season, putting him on pace to shatter the
franchise record of 27, shared by Carl Furillo (1956) and Karros
(1996).</TE>
<TE>   The Expos had taken a 2-0 lead in the first inning when Vladimir
Guerrero launched a pitch from Brown an estimated 437 feet.</TE>

<LD>While the Dodger offense was muffled Tuesday and Wednesday, mustering
only four hits in consecutive shutouts at the hands of the New York
Mets, barely a peep could be heard out of the Dodger clubhouse.</LD>
<LD>   No raised voices. No heated closed-door meetings. No players
challenging their teammates. No vocal leadership, some would say.
Hogwash, first baseman Eric Karros would say.</LD>
<LD>   "To come in here and rant and rave just to hear yourself talk,
that's not what we're lacking right now," Karros said before Thursday
night's game against the Expos. "A lot of times those things are done
so you can tell the media that someone got up and spoke. That doesn't
mean [anything].</LD>
<TE>   "People made a big deal about [former Dodger pitcher] Carlos Perez
beating up a water cooler. Does that mean he's more emotional than
everyone else? No. That's the biggest amount of bull out there."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers don't seem to have that fiery clubhouse presence they
had when Kirk Gibson played in Los Angeles. There is no veteran
player you can point to and say, "This is his team," as the Boston
Red Sox could with Mo Vaughn in the mid-1990s and the Oakland A's
could with Jason Giambi in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Karros, the most veteran of Dodgers, has never been a vocal
presence, the type to call a team meeting or challenge a teammate
publicly. Right fielder Shawn Green is the team's most prominent
position player, but he's also one of baseball's most reserved
players and shies away from the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   Left fielder Brian Jordan has a reputation for being a team
leader, but he has been a Dodger for only three months. He also sat
out the last three games and said he'd be uncomfortable speaking up
from the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Catcher Paul Lo Duca seems to have the potential to become a
prominent clubhouse presence, but he's in only his second full big
league season, leaving him short on the experience required for such
status.</TE>
<TE>   "But if something needs to be said, there's a group of guys here
who will approach somebody and say something," Karros said. "Just
because we don't have an outwardly vocal guy doesn't mean those types
of players don't exist. Certain clubs need that. That's the least of
our concerns."</TE>
<TE>   After opening the season with 9-2 and 12-0 losses to San
Francisco, the Dodgers called a team meeting in which several players
spoke. They won six of their next eight games.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about one guy leading a team," Jordan said. "The media
has that perception, but it's all about the team. A leader may call a
meeting, but the point of a meeting is that everyone speaks up."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jesse Orosco, the team's left-handed relief specialist, went on
the disabled list Wednesday night because of a strained left rib-cage
muscle, an injury that has sidelined some pitchers for as much as six
weeks. Orosco's injury does not seem that severe, but the Dodgers are
being cautious with him.</TE>
<TE>   "It might take a week, it might take two or three weeks," Orosco
said. "My main concern is it's a muscle that is very vital to
pitching. You don't want to throw a pitch in a game situation and
blow it out. You want to make sure it's 100%. I feel bad it happened,
but the Dodgers made the right move."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, who suffered a slight strain of his lower back Monday
night, said he felt "a little better" Thursday but was unavailable
for the third consecutive game. He did not take batting practice or
throw. Asked how many games Jordan would have to sit out before
considering him a candidate for the disabled list, Manager Jim Tracy
said, "We're playing it by ear, taking it a day at a time." ...
Center fielder Dave Roberts sat out his fourth consecutive game
because of a strained right quadriceps. The leadoff batter hoped to
start Thursday, "but it's just not 100%," Roberts said. "I was
optimistic [Wednesday], but it didn't get any better [Thursday].
Hopefully, it won't be much longer, but it's definitely not a DL
situation."</TE>

<HD>Estes Leads With 65</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Estes shot a five-under-par 65 in windy conditions Thursday to
take a two-stroke lead in the Colonial at Fort Worth.</LD>
<LD>   Estes had a bogey-free round to match his best score of the year
and finish two strokes ahead of a group of nine players. The former
University of Texas player birdied the first two holes and also
closed with two straight birdies.</LD>
<LD>   "The winds were difficult, but I managed to combat the wind for
the most part," Estes said. "A lot of good shots didn't turn out
good, or some mis-hit ones turned out OK. It was difficult to pull
the right club."</LD>
<TE>   The breeze was blowing as usual over the historic 7,080-yard
layout known as Hogan's Alley, but the 10-20 mph wind gusted
throughout the day and swirled in different directions. Only 34 of
the 124 players were able to break par.</TE>
<TE>   David Duval, Steve Jones and Steve Lowery were at 67, along with
Esteban Toledo, Scott Verplank, Bob Tway, Brandt Jobe, Frank
Lickliter and Joel Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   Lowery was four under through 10 holes and then had seven
consecutive pars. But his round-ending bogey at the 402-yard ninth
hole, when his approach found a bunker behind the green, dropped him
out of sole possession of second place.</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Garcia, playing as a defending champion on the PGA Tour for
the first time, shot a 76.</TE>
<TE>   He had with an eagle on his second hole, the 609-yard No. 11, but
had eight bogeys and no birdies after that in his worst round of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Watson, who skipped this week's Senior PGA Tour event, Corey
Pavin and Carl Paulson were among 13 players at 68.</TE>
<TE>   Pavin, who got the last of his 14 PGA Tour wins in the 1996
Colonial, had a hole in one on the 178-yard 13th.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laura Davies heard last fall that Mount Vintage Plantation was her
kind of course. She showed it Thursday, shooting a five-under 67 to
take the first-round lead in the Asahi Ryokuken International at
North Augusta, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   Davies was scheduled to play in the inaugural tournament last
September, but was overseas and pulled out of the LPGA's first event
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard all my friends who play here say it was very hilly, and
then tell they thought it would really suit my game," said Davies,
who finished two shots ahead of Grace Park.</TE>
<TE>   When Davies played in the pro-am, she knew she'd found a place to
love.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no out of bounds. There's very little water. I can stand
up on the tee with confidence. And if I hit in the trees, you can
find it and get it out," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Annika Sorenstam, coming off a victory last week in the Aerus
Electrolux USA Championship, started with back-to-back birdies and
finished with an even-par 72.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Dodger right fielder has been shadow of hitter
who set club home run record last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shawn Green stood motionless Wednesday night as the Dodgers were shut
out for the eighth time this season, taking strike three on a
picture-perfect fastball over the middle of the plate to end a 2-0
New York Met victory.</LD>
<LD>   The familiar scene was disturbing for the frustrated right fielder
and struggling Dodgers, who expected Green to shoulder more
responsibility after trading Gary Sheffield to the Atlanta Braves in
January. Green acknowledges his swing has been out of sync since
spring training and he can't pinpoint the problem, though he
dismisses suggestions of being burdened by increased expectations.</LD>
<LD>   The franchise's single-season home run leader remains hopeful that
things will improve, but the punchless Dodgers need their star player
to find his way quickly.</LD>
<TE>   "I just feel really terrible," said batting coach Jack Clark, who
works with Green daily. "I wish there was something I could do or
say, because now it's at the point where you want to do and say a
lot, but I don't know. I'm sure that man has plenty of things going
on in his head and heart. He's such a big piece of this team and he's
not feeling what he wants to feel to help this team.</TE>
<TE>   "He just hasn't felt it since spring training. For whatever
reason, and I don't know whether it's the pressure from everyone
saying it's his team now, the fact that Sheff is gone or what. All I
know is I wish I had an answer for him. I wish we could go look at
film, get a little key or something and find the reason why we're not
getting there. But we're not at that point and it is what it is. Like
I said, I just don't know."</TE>
<TE>   After going 0 for 3 Thursday against Montreal, the left-handed
batter is hitting only .235 with three homers and 21 runs batted in.
Green is in a six-for-35 slump and has not homered since April 20,
spanning 21 games and 83 at-bats. He has hit into a team-high 12
double plays.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy recently moved Green from cleanup to third in
the batting order in front of Paul Lo Duca, hoping Green would get
better pitches to hit. In about one-third of the club's at-bats in
the No. 3 hole, Green is hitting .148 (nine for 61) with no homers
and three RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have the fewest homers in that spot in the major
leagues, and are tied for the lowest RBI total with the Milwaukee
Brewers, New York Yankees, Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis
Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not fair to put it all on Greenie," Lo Duca said. "Yeah,
Greenie is our focal point and we need him to do well, that's just
the bottom line, but he can't do it by himself. Everybody has to take
responsibility to get us going.</TE>
<TE>   "When other teams come to town, they feel they can beat us if they
get Shawn Green out. He's a marked player because he's earned it, but
we all have to do more to help him. No one expects Greenie to just
carry us."</TE>
<TE>   Green's power outage has contributed to the Dodgers ranking 15th
in the 16-team National League in runs and homers. Heart-of-the-order
batters Brian Jordan and Eric Karros also have not produced as hoped,
prompting Tracy to shuffle the batting order in an effort to
jump-start the offense, but Tracy recently singled out Green, saying
he could not determine the club's run-production potential until
Green gets going.</TE>
<TE>   Such is the spotlight for Green after he had arguably the best
season in franchise history in 2001, setting a team home-run record
with 49 while batting .297 with 31 doubles, 125 RBIs, 121 runs and a
.598 slugging percentage.</TE>
<TE>   "He was allowed to just go out and play last year," Karros said.
"There weren't any kind of expectations, so he just went out and he
performed.</TE>
<TE>   "He performed at a level that was probably better than any season
that I've seen in the last decade here, and you had a lot of great
seasons with Sheff and Mike [Piazza]. Now, this year, [expectations
changed] because of the year he had last year."</TE>
<TE>   Green was not upset about Tracy putting him on the spot, saying he
understands how this works.</TE>
<TE>   "With the year I had last year, and with some of the changes we
made, I understood I would have a big responsibility this year,"
Green said. "I knew it would be bigger than what it had ever been in
the past here, I think that's just pretty much common sense, and I
accept that.</TE>
<TE>   "But I've also gotten off to a lot of slow starts in my career.
The only difference this year is what I did last year, and the
numbers are going to come once my swing is right. But I can't try to
rush it and focus on the external expectations. That's not going to
help anything."</TE>
<TE>   Scouts who follow the Dodgers said Green's swing is longer than it
was last season, reducing his chances of making contact in the strike
zone. Clark, Tom Lasorda and Ira Green, Shawn's father, agree with
the assessment of the scouts and have approached Green about the
change.</TE>
<TE>   However, Green has not completely embraced their view.</TE>
<TE>   "We look at tapes, he's got all his good swings [from 2001] on his
own computer and we talk about the mental part of hitting all the
time," Clark said. "But he knows his swing better than anybody else.
No matter what I say or talk about, I can't try to change a guy's
stance unless he comes to me.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not ready to throw in the towel and start all over, and I
understand that. Sometimes he just looks so close. He'll get into
batting practice sometimes and work on some things and feel really
good. Then he'll come in during games and say, 'I don't know why I'm
missing those balls.'"</TE>
<TE>   Green traveled a similar road in 2000, struggling in his first
season at Chavez Ravine after signing a six-year, $84-million
contract. He batted .269 with 44 doubles, 24 homers and 99 RBIs--but
the Dodgers needed more.</TE>
<TE>   Now, they need even more from Green.</TE>
<TE>   "As an organization, you have to look at what numbers players put
up in the past, because that's your only gauge as to what's going to
happen in the future," he said. "Everybody just has a different
amount that's expected of him.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what's expected of me and I believe I'm going to get going
as soon as I can just get my swing right. I'm not worried because
it's really that simple."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers can only hope.</TE>

<HD>Dutton Enjoys Strong Meet</HD>

<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the first four weeks of the Hollywood Park meet, trainer Jerry
Dutton has nearly doubled his victory total for the first four months
of 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Dutton's 44 starters won four races before the start of the season
in Inglewood, but his horses have posted seven victories at Hollywood
Park and he leads the standings.</LD>
<LD>   Unable to win with any of his four runners on Thursday, after
winning twice Wednesday, Dutton has two opportunities to get back
into the circle tonight at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<TE>   In the second, a $60,000 allowance at 51/2 furlongs on the turf,
he will be represented by Always Game and in the sixth, a $32,000
maiden claimer for California-bred fillies and mares at six furlongs,
he will run longshot Shescominundone.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by a partnership that includes Dutton and wife Barbara,
Always Game already has a win at the meet. He won by two lengths at
the same distance April 27, but will have to improve to handle likely
favorite Astonished.</TE>
<TE>   Astonished, a 6-year-old gelded son of the English sire Weldnaas,
owned by Ron Charles and the Clear Valley Stable, lost by a head to
Malabar Gold in the San Simeon Handicap on April 21, the final day of
the Santa Anita meet. A repeat of that effort would make him very
hard to handle tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Shescominundone, a gray daughter of Runaway Groom, has three
seconds and a third in six starts, but ran poorly in her first start
of the meet on May 3. She faded after pressing the pace and wound up
fifth at 19-1.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Bull Ryder, Madeittothemoon and Glitterbend, who
finished close together in the sixth on April 26, head a solid field
of starter allowance types going six furlongs in tonight's seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Johnny Show. The 5-year-old gelding made it five
consecutive victories when he won Thursday's fourth at Hollywood
Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Frances Henderson. The trainer, who is based in
Northern California, is 0 for 24 in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Missionairess and
Southerly Flow in the third, singling Perfectly Pretty in the fourth
and using all in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/41. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $18.60/$227.60. Total money bet: $292.</TE>

<KH>KING NOTES</KH>
<HD>Divac Says He Defends, Not Flops</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>King center Vlade Divac is renowned around the NBA for flopping, yet
he insisted he doesn't know the definition of the word. If it means
falling theatrically on his backside after Shaquille O'Neal turns in
to him to shoot a basket, Divac pleaded not guilty Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know what is flopping," Divac said. "I think Derek Fisher
does a better job of that than I do. It's taking a charge. It's for
the refs to decide."</LD>
<LD>   Divac, singled out in the past as one of O'Neal's least favorite
opponents because of his flopping, then nudged a reporter gently in
the chest.</LD>
<TE>   "See," he said. "You flopped."</TE>
<TE>   After the laughter of other reporters had subsided, Divac
continued to defend his defense.</TE>
<TE>   "What am I supposed to do?" he asked. "Sorry, Shaq, but I can't
let you just come in here and dunk. I hope the refs decide what's
fair. I mean [O'Neal] is doing elbows and everything, which is not
allowed."</TE>
<TE>   Divac then offered this opinion of O'Neal: "For me, he's the best
player in the game. His size is his advantage. It's like me playing
against you [a reporter of average height]. You can't stop me."</TE>
<TE>   Divac waited for the giggling to stop before pressing on in a more
serious tone.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year, he is improving his game," he said of O'Neal. "He
didn't have a turnaround jump shot or a jump hook like he has now. He
has more weapons. He is a complete player right now."</TE>
<TE>   Asked how he might exploit O'Neal's injured right big toe, Divac
merely smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "Give him credit," he said. "He's played all year long in pain. I
think I'll have to use my quickness to the basket. Hopefully, the
refs will call some fouls."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chris Webber had this to say about flopping: "I'm the last person
to ask. As many offensive fouls as I get, I expect Shaq to get four a
game. Imagine what it will be like with Shaq going against Vlade, who
is 100 pounds [lighter]. Flopping is definitely a problem in the NBA.
I think they should call fouls for flopping. It's getting ridiculous
when you take a step in to a guy and he falls down."</TE>
<TE>   Webber on the referees: "I hope this is a series where the refs
don't read the papers. I hope they're sequestered, like a jury."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Peja Stojakovic, expected to be sidelined for at least the first
two games of the series because of a sprained right ankle, worked out
lightly at the Kings' practice facility. He walked on a treadmill,
rode an exercise bike and shot baskets, according to Coach Rick
Adelman.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scot Pollard had a snappy comeback for a reporter who wondered if
it was critical for the Kings to win Game 1 Saturday at Arco Arena.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like to get Game 1," he said, then paused before adding,
"and we would like to get Game 2 and Game 3 and Game 4. It takes four
wins to advance."</TE>
<TE>   Of the matchup between the Kings and Lakers, Pollard said, "In
Kobe [Bryant] and Shaq, they have a 1-2 punch that's probably the
best in the game. But I think we have the better team."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Suffice to say that each team is sure it can beat the other.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers are twice-defending NBA champions, looking to become
the fifth team to three-peat.</LD>
<LD>   The Sacramento Kings are Pacific Division champions, certain that
they have arrived after more than two decades of failure.</LD>
<TE>   Rick Fox sort of guaranteed victory, Samaki Walker seconded it
with a well-placed shot at the Kings' recent habit of collapsing.
Vlade Divac all but wrote off the Lakers months ago, and all of
Sacramento said, "Hear! Hear!"</TE>
<TE>   It wouldn't be much fun otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   After practice on Thursday, Fox spread his arms and raised his
eyebrows in defense of Walker.</TE>
<TE>   "Once again, here comes the truth," he said. "They can't run from
the truth. The truth is, what's happened in the past is a
characteristic of theirs. They know that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal removed his own stitches--seven from his right
index finger--before Tuesday's game against San Antonio, and then
team medical personnel sealed the wound with glue.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in my bathroom and, miraculously, in my drawer there were
some scissors and some tweezers," he said with a mischievous grin. "I
don't know how they got there. There was a little gold light saying,
'Take the stitches out.' I just wanted to touch the ball the last
time. With the stitches in there I really couldn't touch it.... So, I
just took them out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The voice in his bathroom also requested noise, apparently. O'Neal
said he'd like more for Games 3 and 4, which will be played at
Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Bring what you want to bring, except weapons," he said. "You can
bring instruments. Bring pots and pans. Bring what you want to bring.
Cell phones. Video cameras. Bring everything."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento guard Bobby Jackson on Kobe Bryant: "He scares us the
most of anyone in the league. He's so athletic, and he always wants
the ball. Doug Christie will guard him. It's going to be extremely
important how that plays out. Doug can't get into grabbing and
holding him. He has to make him work for everything."</TE>
<TE>   In two playoff games at Arco Arena last season, Bryant scored 36
and 48 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Derek Fisher, after King co-owner Gavin Maloof was seen dancing
with the King dance team Monday night: "It's probably human to
celebrate when you've done something good. But we learned that you
can't do that, because they really haven't done anything."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers will televise Games 1 and 2 on the Diamondvision
screens at Staples Center. Tickets are $10 for adults, $5 for
children, with proceeds going to the Lakers' Youth Foundation and
Staples Center Foundation.... Games 3, 4, 5 and 6 will be delayed on
KWKW, the Lakers' Spanish language station, because of conflicts with
the Dodgers. The games will be broadcast live in Spanish on KIRN
(670) and KWKU (1220).</TE>

<HD>And Away They Go</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Call it confidence, focus, determination or
whatever: The Lakers have won a record 11 consecutive road games in
playoffs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it darkens in Portland, when the motorcycle roars in Sacramento,
when the music blares in San Antonio, Rick Fox usually is sitting on
the press table beside the Laker bench, rocking gently, his eyes
closed, his head who knows where.</LD>
<LD>   When the public-address announcer shrieks the names of the other
five, Kobe Bryant picks through the plastic tray of gum, looking for
Bazooka. Last weekend in San Antonio, when the crowd was its most
hysterical and the sound effects at their most obnoxious, Bryant read
the comic, then the fortune, as if he were alone in his childhood
bedroom.</LD>
<LD>   Shaquille O'Neal, larger than anything on the arenas' big video
boards and typically unimpressed by the array of fireworks and theme
songs from above and the insults from behind, typically stands near
the corner of the floor, his warmup zipped to his chin, his eyes on
his toes.</LD>
<TE>   It is a different life on the road, where buildings fill first to
get a glimpse of the Lakers, then to see them lose, and to see Bryant
fail and O'Neal miss and the home team's players hug each other so
gratefully.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun to play on the road," Bryant said. "Everybody's against
you. The home team is playing with more confidence and you have to
elevate your game as a result. We've been able to do that."</TE>
<TE>   A so-so road team for much of the regular season, the Lakers
became the best playoff traveling team in the history of the league,
of any league, in any major professional sport. They take an 11-game
postseason road winning streak into Saturday's game in Sacramento, a
run that began in Portland last year and was extended again Sunday in
San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   It has proceeded by the length of a 22-point victory in Sacramento
last year and by the breadth of Robert Horry's three-pointer nearly
three weeks ago in Portland. It progressed by 12 points to win their
second consecutive NBA title on a Friday night in Philadelphia, by
Bryant's put-back Sunday in San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a year and nearly a dozen playoff games, since a
120-87 loss at Indiana in Game 5 of the 2000 NBA Finals, not a single
home fan has gone home happy when the Lakers have worn their purple,
other than the ones Bryant occasionally consoles on his way off the
floor.</TE>
<TE>   Through cowbells and screaming drunks and flying rubber balls and
hurled profanities and clever signs, through Tim Duncan and Allen
Iverson and Rasheed Wallace and Chris Webber all walking out of their
homes and driving their cars to their gyms, the Lakers are 11-0.</TE>
<TE>   The 1991-92 Chicago Bulls and 1995-96 Houston Rockets each won
eight consecutive road playoff games. The Lakers had eight going into
these playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's focus," Horry said Thursday afternoon. "That's all."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers can't agree why this streak has grown. Fox believes it
is the defense. Brian Shaw said the road, those endless nights of
Four Seasons hotels and chartered luxury jets, hardens them and draws
them closer. Phil Jackson said the Lakers play a more conservative
game in unfamiliar environs, so are less prone to errors. Derek
Fisher said they play well from memory, that they have gained
strength from their previous achievements away from home.</TE>
<TE>   Probably, it is all of those, and a little luck. Scottie Pippen
didn't get out on Horry. Jackson was ejected from Game 2 in San
Antonio last season and, so inspired, the Lakers came back from a
double-digit deficit. The Spurs couldn't make a fourth-quarter shot
for an entire weekend. It goes on.</TE>
<TE>   "We've figured out a way to win," Fisher said. "Not just on Kobe's
back. Not just on Shaq's back. Not just with a three from the corner
from Robert Horry. A number of different ways."</TE>
<TE>   In the last two seasons, 16 playoff games last year and eight this
year, the Lakers have shot better on the road (46.4% in 11 games)
than at home (45.5% in 13 games). At the same time, the Laker defense
has held its foes to the identical shooting percentage at home as
well as the road--40.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Away from Staples Center, the Lakers shoot three-pointers better
(42.9% to 32.7%), turn over the ball fewer times (12.3 to 14.1) and
score more in the fourth quarter (25.8 to 24.8).</TE>
<TE>   They also give the basketball to Bryant more.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very important part," Jackson said. "Another important
part, we know that Shaq gets charging fouls on the road, three-second
calls on the road. You have every fan standing up screaming in these
officials' ears, trying to help them out. He's got to play a much
more confined game when he goes on the road, which gives Kobe more
latitude."</TE>
<TE>   In these last two postseasons, Bryant has made more shots (11.3 to
8.7), taken more shots and averaged more points (30.9 to 26.2) on the
road. He has led the Lakers in scoring in eight of the 11 road wins.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, O'Neal averages 25.1 points in road games, more than
five points fewer than at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   So they stand on the verge of two games in three days at Arco
Arena, where the hatred is more brassy than the bells. They won twice
there last spring, in games two and three of a streak that has since
grown by eight. This is why, when the Kings danced over their
home-court advantage, when their center, Vlade Divac, predicted doom
for the Lakers because of it, the Lakers were unmoved. In the near
past, they have won these games, they have stolen these crowds, they
have burned these buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "The confidence lies in knowing what you do, or what you're
capable of doing, is still there," Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, ever courageous, shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nothing but noise," he said.</TE>

<LD>After ending a four-race losing streak on April 28, Dashing Knud will
try for a repeat in the first trial for the MBNA America California
Challenge Championship tonight at Los Alamitos.</LD>
<LD>   Winner of the Golden State Futurity and Los Alamitos Million as a
2-year-old in 2000, Dashing Knud won an allowance race in his second
start of the year for trainer Danny Cardoza.</LD>
<LD>   Set to break from the outside in the field of six, Dashing Knud
will be ridden by Kenny Hart and is the 3-5 favorite.</LD>
<TE>   In the second 440-yard trial, Chiarascuro is the 1-1 favorite
against four opponents. The 4-year-old Chicks Beduino gelding was
third behind Corona Kool and Hes My Dasher in the Los Alamitos Winter
Championship in his last start on March 2. Ramon Sanchez will ride
Chiarascuro, who has won three of 19.</TE>
<TE>   The 10 fastest qualifiers--or all but one of the horses running in
the two trials--will return for the MBNA Championship on June 1.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Special Queen SA. 2. It Happens. 3. Loose Fly. 4.
Wynhurst. 5. Priscillas New Doc. 6. Private Flyin. 7. Dashing Knud.
8. Chiarascuro. 9. Watch This Injun. 10. Sport Report.</TE>
<TE>   Four! In the first, let's use Special Queen SA, Betty Jean Hawkins
and Splash Dot Dash; Zoras and It Happens in the second, single Loose
Fly in the third and use the entry of Lord Triagain-Solongretsina and
Wynhurst in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: BR Raceroni moves off the rail for trainer
Chuck Treece in the ninth. Oh Just Lucky switches to jockey Joe
Badilla Jr. in the 10th after breaking poorly in her first race in
more than a year.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Is Moving Forward</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Blanco and Palencia, benched in scoreless first
half, provide the spark team needs to beat Bolivia, 1-0.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>They play these games for educational reasons, usually to learn who
can and can't cut it at the World Cup level. But the main achievement
for Mexico in Thursday night's 1-0 victory over Bolivia at San
Francisco Stadium at Candlestick Point was to confirm one thing Coach
Javier Aguirre already knew:</LD>
<LD>   Mexico is a much better team when forwards Cuauhtemoc Blanco and
Francisco Palencia are not on the bench.</LD>
<LD>   Blanco and Palencia sat and watched a lot of unimaginative soccer
as a veteran-shy Bolivia squad held Mexico scoreless for the first 45
minutes. Mexico had a couple chances early, with Luis Hernandez
squandering a prime opportunity in the fifth minute, getting to a
rebound off the crossbar but heading over the bar. Then, for the next
40 minutes, Mexico generated little.</LD>
<TE>   Actually, Blanco was sick. Not because of the soccer display in
front of him--he was battling a case of the flu.</TE>
<TE>   At halftime, however, Aguirre sent on Blanco and Palencia, hoping
they might create some sort of spark over the last 45 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Blanco and Palencia needed only two.</TE>
<TE>   In the 47th minute, Blanco split the Bolivian defense with a
superb through ball, freeing Palencia just outside the penalty area.
As the ball bounded just inside the box, Palencia struck with his
right foot and blasted the ball past goalkeeper Carlos Eguez just
inside the left post.</TE>
<TE>   It was a quick burst, like one of the cold wind gusts that swirled
through the stadium all night. A flash of what Mexico is capable of
when Blanco and Palencia are on the field together, briefly warming
the crowd of 37,217.</TE>
<TE>   Palencia provided a jolt of energy for a Mexican team that had
been booed at its last home game, an unimpressive 2-1 victory over
Colombia last Sunday in Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   And then, given the goal it needed, Mexico attended to the
basics--defense, avoiding injury, playing out the match.</TE>
<TE>   It was a step in the right direction, but afterward, Aguirre was
asked if he were running out of time to prepare his team for its
World Cup opener in Japan, June 3 against Croatia.</TE>
<TE>   "Two weeks is sufficient time to prepare my team," Aguirre said.
"We've had 40 days [in training camp already]. Two weeks is plenty of
time to have the team ready for the World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre acknowledged he is "not happy with everything. You can't
always be happy with everything. Especially considering the harsh
conditions tonight--the wind and the pressure [Bolivia applied]."</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre described Bolivia as "an uncomfortable rival. They ran a
lot and they pressured us. We played pretty good. We just didn't
score many goals."</TE>
<TE>   Mexico plays its final tuneup game Sunday against AC Milan at 2
p.m. at the Coliseum.</TE>

<HD>Mack, Laidler Sharing a Dream</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Karting has long been considered a starting point for becoming a
successful race driver, but few, if any, have tried making the
quantum leap from karts to Indy cars, skipping other developmental
series.</LD>
<LD>   George Mack, an African American driver from Inglewood, is in the
process of doing it.</LD>
<LD>   He is a regular in the Indy Racing League series and, with a
little luck and few more miles per hour from his G Force-Chevrolet,
he will become an Indianapolis 500 driver in Sunday's final round of
qualifying.</LD>
<TE>   Mack's racing had been limited to karting, where he had won
national and international recognition, before Marc Laidler, a Los
Angeles entrepreneur, began a search for an African American driver
to carry Laidler's 310 Racing's colors in big-time auto racing.</TE>
<TE>   310 Motoring, Laidler's main business, customizes automobiles for
celebrities such as Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, Jennifer Lopez,
Britney Spears, Gary Sheffield, Keyshawn Johnson, Denzel Washington
and the Sultan of Brunei.</TE>
<TE>   "Some friends took me to the CART race at Fontana last year and I
was blown away by the cars and the excitement," Laidler said. "I had
never understood racing, but I saw it as an untapped opportunity for
a minority racing team. I immediately began asking questions about
African American drivers and the conversations usually led to George
Mack."</TE>
<TE>   Mack, 30, had raced karts against such drivers as Richie Hearn,
Alex Barron, Bryan Herta and Anthony Lazzaro and had raced in Europe
as a teammate of Renault's Formula One driver, Jarno Trulli.</TE>
<TE>   However, since winning the International Karting Federation
championship in 1994, Mack had spent most of his time working at a
Honda dealership in Culver City and doing some testing for Mazda.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the IRL would give George a license, they said he had to
run laps at 180 and 185 [mph] at Homestead in Florida," Laidler said.
"He was right on. I was blown away at how good he looked."</TE>
<TE>   Laidler had a driver, now he needed cars and a team.</TE>
<TE>   "We were lucky," Laider said. "Clayton Cunningham had two G Force
cars and all the equipment, but no driver. I had a driver and no
equipment, so I bought the team from Cunningham."</TE>
<TE>   Mack has driven in all four IRL races this year. His best finishes
were 13th at Homestead and 16th at California Speedway. His best
qualifying was ninth at Nazareth, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   Then it was time for Indianapolis and its 2.5-mile rectangular
oval, the most famous and daunting racing facility in the world.</TE>
<TE>   And how did Mack feel when he took the first lap in his rookie
test?</TE>
<TE>   "I was scared as hell," he said. "There's no other way to put it."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, he has raised his speed close to the 226-mph bracket,
borderline for making the 33-car field on May 26.</TE>
<TE>   "I've felt more comfortable every time out," he said. "My fear now
is not doing what I have to do."</TE>
<TE>   Mack has logged 290 laps since practice opened May 5. Only
two-time champion Arie Luyendyk and Paul Tracy--also
non-qualifiers--have been on the track for more laps.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be fine in the race," Mack said. "I put my blinders on and
go into my own little world. I might be nervous, but I'll also be
intense and focused. Before the race, I'll listen to my Natalie Cole
'Stardust' CD. Her voice really calms me down and helps me focus."</TE>
<TE>   In their role as Indy's first African American team owner and
driver, Mack and the 310 Racing crew visited Flanner House, a
103-year-old educational and child development center originally
established in Indianapolis as a settlement house to serve African
American families migrating to Indiana from the Confederacy.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids loved it," Mack said. "We had one of our cars there and
you should have seen the kids' reaction to see a race car and a crew
up close. It brought back a lot of memories to me too. You know, I
was a kid once."</TE>
<TE>   The Ferrari Flap</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't that Ferrari's decision to have No. 2 driver Rubens
Barrichello slow down and allow No. 1 driver Michael Schumacher to
win Sunday's Austrian Grand Prix was out of order, it's that it was
so blatant.</TE>
<TE>   Those knowledgeable about F1 have known for years that being
teammates doesn't mean being equals in Grand Prix garages.</TE>
<TE>   What appears to have upset F1 authorities most was not
Barrichello's backing off, but Schumacher's insisting that his
Brazilian teammate stand on the winner's level during podium
ceremonies. And his giving Barrichello the winner's trophy.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: Ferrari and Schumacher will be given a massive fine
when the FIA reviews the situation at a special hearing on June
26--and it won't be for the "team strategy," but for the uproar
Schumacher caused on the podium.</TE>
<TE>   Even Schumacher was embarrassed.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to be honest to say no, it was probably the wrong decision
to win this race," he was quoted as saying. "If I had the chance to
turn it around, I would probably do so, but I cannot now."</TE>
<TE>   Barrichello, for his part, seemed not the least upset.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got the [winner's] trophy, which I will give to my wife,
whose birthday it was [race day], and to my mother, as well, because
[it was] Mother's Day," he said. "I'm a happy guy. I think the way
the race went, as everybody saw, it was probably one of the best
races of my life."</TE>
<TE>   He also has a multimillion-dollar contract with Ferrari that he
signed only a week earlier.</TE>
<TE>   At worst, the incident opens suspicions about the great victories
of some other Formula One legends--Juan Fangio, Jack Brabham, Mario
Andretti, Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna. How many times did they take
the checkered flag because of team orders?</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, how different is it from what happened at
Indianapolis last year when Raul Boesel flew in from Brazil to drive
for Fred Treadway.</TE>
<TE>   After he'd qualified, Boesel said: "It is one thing to qualify
well and another to have a good car for the race. I think we have
that car. Other teams had called, but when Treadway called, I didn't
think twice."</TE>
<TE>   Boesel's reward? For the race, the car he'd qualified was handed
over to Felipe Giaffone, the team's No. 1 driver, who had been bumped
from the field. Boesel sat out the race.</TE>
<TE>   Believe It or Not</TE>
<TE>   If Robbie Buhl had been .685 of a second faster in his 10-mile
qualifying run Sunday, his wife Becky would have become the only
woman to have been married to two Indianapolis 500 pole-sitters. That
was the margin by which Buhl trailed Bruno Junqueira.</TE>
<TE>   When Scott Brayton won the pole in 1995 and 1996, Becky was Mrs.
Brayton. Her husband was killed while practicing for the 1996 race
and Becky later married Buhl.</TE>
<TE>   Southland Notes</TE>
<TE>   A victory Saturday night at Perris Auto Speedway will give Cory
Kruseman a record 56 Sprint Car Racing Assn. wins, breaking him out
of a tie with 45-year-old Rip Williams. Kruseman won No. 55 Saturday
night at Manzanita Speedway in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Irwindale Dragstrip's stepped-up program will feature the Summit
Series on Sunday, starting at 11 a.m. Interest in the eighth-mile
strip has escalated since the start of weekly side-by-side racing
Thursday nights.</TE>
<TE>   For its Saturday night program, Irwindale will have three stock
car divisions--super late model, late model and modified 4s, and two
truck divisions--speed trucks and American race trucks. Tony Green of
Oak Hills will be out to retain his lead over Ben Walker of North
Hills in the super late models.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Auto Club's Ford Focus midget series will be at Orange
Show Speedway in San Bernardino on Saturday night. Todd Hunsaker of
Chino Hills has won three of the last four Ford Focus main events.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Flanders, the voice of Irwindale Speedway and the Toyota
Grand Prix of Long Beach, has been named chief announcer for CART
races, starting June 2 at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   The Championship Auto Racing Auxiliary donated $50,000 to the New
York Police and Fire Widows' and Children's Benefit fund. The money
was raised during CART's annual "Runway Madness" season-ending party
at Ontario. Since its inception in 1981, CARA Charities has raised
and donated more than $3.5 million to a variety of charitable
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Passing</TE>
<TE>   Paul Jones, 63, younger brother of 1963 Indianapolis 500 winner
Parnelli Jones, died Tuesday of a heart attack at his home in Norco.
Jones, a prominent California Racing Assn. sprint car driver in the
1960s and '70s, had trained horses in recent years with his son, Paul
Jr., at Los Alamitos. Services will be held Monday at 2 p.m. at
Pierce Bros. Mortuary in Riverside. Survivors also include his wife,
Joyce.</TE>

<LD>The Boston Celtics returned to practice Thursday in Waltham, Mass.,
with a warning for the New Jersey Nets: We're much more than Paul
Pierce and Antoine Walker.</LD>
<LD>   Those two scored 49.8% of Boston's points in the regular season
and 52.1% so far in the run to the Eastern Conference finals, which
begin Sunday at New Jersey.</LD>
<LD>   But the Nets must be ready for the defense of Eric Williams, the
shooting of Rodney Rogers and the inside play ofMark Blount. They all
helped put the Celtics in the conference finals for the first time
since 1988.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the way we've done it," Walker said as Boston resumed
workouts after a day off, "being very gutsy on the defensive end and
getting contributions from nine or 10 guys on a night-in and
night-out basis."</TE>
<TE>   Other Celtics agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "We're able to create mismatches," Erick Strickland said. "We have
a very versatile team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If Utah Jazz forward Karl Malone pursues an off-season trade, he
won't be going to Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty much impossible for us to do it," Maverick owner Mark
Cuban told the Deseret News.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, the Jazz and Mavericks explored a deal involving
Malone and Juwan Howard, who was eventually traded to Denver.</TE>
<TE>   "When we had Juwan's contract, there was a sensible way to
consider [a trade for Malone]," Cuban said. "Now, I don't see how we
could [do] it in a way that would work for us."</TE>

<HD>Capriati Zooms Past Pierce at Italian Open</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jennifer Capriati finished off Mary Pierce at the Italian Open before
some fans reached their seats Thursday night at Rome.</LD>
<LD>   Capriati needed just 34 minutes to win, 6-0, 6-0, in the match
between the last two French Open champions and join five other seeded
players in the quarterfinals at this clay-court tournament.</LD>
<LD>   The other seeded players advancing were No. 3 Kim Clijsters, No. 4
Serena Williams, No. 5 Justine Henin, No. 7 Amelie Mauresmo and No. 8
Sandrine Testud. But defending champion Jelena Dokic, seeded No. 6,
was stunned by Anastasia Myskina, 5-7, 6-4, 6-3.</LD>
<TE>   Pierce has dropped from No. 3 in the rankings to No. 172 because
of a series of injuries since she won the 2000 French Open.</TE>
<TE>   She entered the draw in Rome via the WTA Tour's protected ranking
rule, which helps injured players enter tournaments when they return
to action.</TE>
<TE>   "She's just coming back and it's hard for her in these big
matches," said Capriati, seeded No. 2 in Rome. "She made it very easy
for me."</TE>
<TE>   Williams used her strong serve and groundstrokes to overpower

<TE>   Andy Roddick lost to a qualifier in the third round of the Hamburg
Masters, while Lleyton Hewitt and Gustavo Kuerten advanced with
straight-set victories at Hamburg, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   The 13th-seeded Roddick had trouble with Julien Boutter's
overpowering serve and was beaten, 6-3, 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   Boutter broke Roddick's serve to take a 6-5 lead in the second set
and fired an ace on his second match point to clinch the upset.</TE>
<TE>   "He was serving huge; he hit some unreal shots from the baseline,"
Roddick said. "He went for broke and they went in. He beat me fair
and square."</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Hewitt, who has never won a red-clay tournament,
reached the quarterfinals by surviving two close games to defeat Jiri
Novak, 6-4, 6-3. Kuerten, the three-time French Open champion seeded
No. 2 at this $2.8-million tournament, topped Guillermo Canas, 7-5,
6-2.</TE>

<TE>   The integrity of Olympic sailing is threatened by "rampant"
cheating, the international sailing federation's president says.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement posted on the ISAF Web site, Paul Henderson said
sailing at Olympic level was "out of control" and urged the ISAF to
act before it "totally loses the integrity of the sport."</TE>
<TE>   "What is happening is analogous to taking performance enhancing
drugs in other sports," he said. "They are both cheating."</TE>
<TE>   Henderson recently visited Olympic class regattas in Hyeres,
France, and Miami and said "the cheating was rampant."</TE>
<TE>   He said sailors had a "complete disrespect" of the propulsion
rule, particularly in the Star, Finn, Europe and Laser classes. The
propulsion rule limits pumping of the sail and rocking the boat to
gain extra speed.</TE>

<HD>Maple Leafs Lose Players, Not Game</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Domi, Healey latest to get hurt, but Toronto
manages to beat Carolina, 2-1, as Joseph makes 31 saves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>It's hard to say just what the injury-riddled Toronto Maple Leafs are
playing on--adrenaline, emotion, focus.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever the formula, it's working in the Stanley Cup playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Alexander Mogilny and Jonas Hoglund scored, and Curtis Joseph
turned away 31 shots as Toronto ruined Carolina's first appearance in
the Eastern Conference finals, beating the Hurricanes, 2-1, in Game 1
on Thursday night.</LD>
<TE>   "Athletes sometimes get in that groove, even when they should be
fatigued," Toronto Coach Pat Quinn said. "There's a wall there
someplace, but clearly they mustered up some good strength."</TE>
<TE>   The Maple Leafs came into the best-of-seven series with Carolina
dragging and depleted after difficult seven-game series against the
New York Islanders and Ottawa Senators.</TE>
<TE>   And Tie Domi and Paul Healey became the eighth and ninth regulars
out of the lineup. Domi was scratched because of a leg injury and
Healey played only two shifts after taking a shot off his knee.</TE>
<TE>   But Toronto gave the Hurricanes lessons in grit and determination
by killing seven penalties in the first 28 minutes--and scoring when
it counted.</TE>
<TE>   "Our penalty-killers are on our [first two] lines, so that gives
them the extra burden to have to log a lot of ice time. That was a
real test for them," Quinn said.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina, the third-seeded team as the Southeast Division
champions, won its opening games against New Jersey and Montreal, but
heads into Game 2 on Sunday trailing.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's discouraging, it just shows what they are made
of and it shows what it takes in the big games," Carolina goalie
Arturs Irbe said. "Nobody ever said it was going to be easy, and we
have fallen behind, but there are still possibly six games to go.
There is room for improvement and to catch up."</TE>
<TE>   Quinn said his team shouldn't get too confident from the one-goal
win.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face it, that was a close game," Quinn said. "There were a
lot of good chances and we needed terrific goaltending. Let's see if
we can be good again [Sunday] and do the little things that help us
win."</TE>
<TE>   Carolina outscored Montreal, 17-3, over the final 140 minutes of
the semifinal series to close it out in six games.</TE>
<TE>   But open ice was much tougher to come by for the Hurricanes
against the more physical Maple Leafs.</TE>
<TE>   "Against Montreal, every loose puck, every rebound was right on
our tape," Erik Cole said. "We're going to have to keep doing what
we've been doing, get pucks to the net and create more traffic and
see what happens."</TE>
<TE>   After a 1-1 first period, Toronto killed four Carolina power plays
before getting one of its own with 7:15 left in the second.</TE>
<TE>   Hoglund tipped in a shot from the blue line by Nathan Dempsey for
his fourth of the playoffs. The goal was reviewed because the right
wing tipped the puck past Irbe with a raised stick, but the 2-1
Toronto lead stood after officials decided the stick was still below
the crossbar.</TE>
<TE>   Hoglund almost gave the Maple Leafs a two-goal lead with a minute
left in the period when he hit the left post.</TE>
<TE>   Seconds later, Joseph was called for a delay-of-game penalty as
the Hurricanes, scoring at 20.4% on the power play coming in, went
back to work with the man advantage.</TE>
<TE>   But the Hurricanes failed to get a shot on goal to start the third
with 1:23 of power-play time, and Toronto played a tight-checking
final 18 minutes to secure its third road win of the postseason.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to give them credit for the way they played, they
bottled up the neutral zone," said Jeff O'Neill, who scored
Carolina's goal. "For having only a day's rest and coming off a tough
series, I thought they played well.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have our best game, but that's what happens when a team
can frustrate you like that in the neutral zone."</TE>
<TE>   Carolina's momentum continued from its eight-goal Game 6 clincher
against Montreal, scoring 3:23 in and peppering Joseph for 15 shots
in the opening 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   But the Maple Leafs were able to salvage a 1-1 tie after the first
period.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A rivalry once considered the nastiest in hockey resumes Saturday
when the Detroit Red Wings and Colorado Avalanche meet in Game 1 of
the Western Conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   Detroit and Colorado, the West's top two teams in the regular
season, will meet for the fifth time in the playoffs since 1996.</LD>
<LD>   The Avalanche have won three of those series, including the last
two, in 1999 and 2000. The Red Wings beat Colorado in three of the
four games the teams played this season.</LD>
<TE>   "Detroit will be a great challenge for us, and we are excited to
play that series," goalie Patrick Roy said after shutting out San
Jose, 1-0, in Game 7 on Wednesday night, sending Colorado to the
conference finals for the sixth time in seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit, the regular-season leader, advanced to the conference
finals by dispatching St. Louis in five games.</TE>
<TE>   "We just know that it's probably the way it should be," Detroit's
Brendan Shanahan said. "We were the top two teams in the Western
Conference during the season, so it's only fitting that we're the
last two standing."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit and Colorado have combined to win four of the last six
Stanley Cups--the Red Wings in 1997 and 1998, and the Avalanche in
1996 and last year.</TE>
<TE>   Add to that a rivalry that has resulted in blood, brawls and
broken bones, and the elements of a fiercely contested series are
present.</TE>
<TE>   "Detroit has been in the back of our minds all the time, and you
watch them and see how well they are playing," Colorado defenseman
Rob Blake said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dave Tippett doesn't see the Dallas Stars as the team that
sputtered to a 10th-place finish in the Western Conference and missed
the playoffs last season.</TE>
<TE>   The man who was hired to coach the Stars on Thursday sees them
more like the team that made two trips to the Stanley Cup finals and
won five division titles in the last six seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a great core of players here, players that have won
before," said Tippett, who signed a three-year deal. "And even though
we are turning the page on an era that's been excellent for the
Dallas Stars, there's no reason we can't have that same success, if
not more success. Our sole purpose this year is to win the Stanley
Cup."</TE>
<TE>   Tippett, an assistant coach who stressed offense during his three
years with the Kings, replaces defense-minded Ken Hitchcock.</TE>
<TE>   Hitchcock was fired in January after players quit responding to
his demanding style.</TE>
<TE>   Hitchcock, who led Dallas to its only two Stanley Cup final
appearances and the 1999 championship, was hired Tuesday to coach the
Philadelphia Flyers.</TE>
<TE>   In 11 seasons as a player, Tippett was a hard-working defensive
forward with Hartford, Washington, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   As a coach, first with the Houston Aeros in the IHL and then with
the Kings, Tippett has shown a tendency to give his players offensive
freedom.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis Blues assistant coach Jimmy Roberts, who played and
coached in the NHL for almost four decades, retired from hockey.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts, 62, played for 15 seasons and had been an NHL head coach
three times. He was the interim Blues coach for nine games in the
1996-97 season, after Mike Keenan's departure and before the hiring
of Joel Quenneville.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts made his NHL debut in 1963 with the Montreal Canadiens,
playing on two Stanley Cup teams before 1967, when he was the first
player picked by the St. Louis Blues in the six-team expansion draft.
He returned to Montreal in a 1971 trade and won the Stanley Cup three
more times, in 1973, 1976 and 1977.</TE>

<LD>Lance Berkman tied Sammy Sosa for the major league lead with his 15th
homer, and Roy Oswalt struck out a season-high 11 in eight innings as
the Houston Astros beat Pittsburgh, 3-1, Thursday night at Houston.</LD>
<LD>   Oswalt (5-2) gave up one run and seven hits and one walk in his
longest outing of the season. He struck out his last four batters.</LD>
<LD>   With the score tied 1-1 in the eighth, Richard Hidalgo led off
with a single against reliever Brian Boehringer (0-1). After a
sacrifice, Boehringer intentionally walked Orlando Merced.</LD>
<TE>   The runners advanced on a groundout and Jose Vizcaino followed
with a two-run single to left off Scott Sauerbeck.</TE>
<TE>   Berkman led off the second inning with a shot that curved just
behind the foul pole in right field to give Houston a 1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing that's bothersome about this situation is how
people blow it out of proportion," Berkman said.</TE>
<TE>   "They get excited about me being tied for the lead. For Sammy
Sosa, that's not unusual. But my career high is 30 home runs. I
haven't even approached his plateau. For me to get overjoyed about
being tied for the home run lead would be ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 5, San Francisco 4--Mark DeRosa hit a tiebreaking single
and Chipper Jones added a three-run double in the eighth inning at
San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied at 1-1, Javy Lopez was walked by Jason Schmidt
(0-1) with one out and was replaced by pinch runner Marcus Giles.
After Giles stole second, Rafael Furcal walked and DeRosa singled up
the middle off Felix Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Sheffield walked to load the bases, then Jones his
bases-clearing double to the right-field wall.</TE>
<TE>   John Smoltz gave up a three-run homer to Benito Santiago with one
out in the ninth. The Giants put two runners on before Smoltz struck
out David Bell and Marvin Benard to end it.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 4, Philadelphia 2--Randy Johnson gave up a home run to
Jimmy Rollins on the game's first pitch, then shut down the Phillies
for the next six innings at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Although far from his overpowering best, Johnson (7-1) struck out
eight in seven innings to win for the first time in three starts.</TE>
<TE>   Erubiel Durazo, in his first game as Arizona's starting first
baseman, struck out in his first three at-bats, then doubled home a
run in Arizona's three-run seventh inning.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 10, Florida 3--Mike Hampton pitched eight innings in his
second straight strong start at Coors Field and Todd Zeile homered
and drove in four runs.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Estalella hit his fourth homer in as many games for the
Rockies, a three-run shot in a six-run first inning. Colorado has won
seven of 10 overall and nine of 10 at home.</TE>
<TE>   Hampton (2-5), the highest-paid pitcher in baseball, gave up three
runs and four hits to win for only the seventh time in his last 23
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   New York 3, San Diego 1--Al Leiter was dominant on the road again,
pitching six strong innings and driving in the go-ahead run at San
Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Leiter (5-2) gave up only an unearned run and seven hits to lower
his earned-run average in five road starts to 1.41.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 2, Milwaukee 1--Todd Walker's RBI single off Mike
DeJean in the 11th inning gave the Reds a four-game sweep at
Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   The Reds beat the Brewers for the seventh time in 11 days.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>This is shaping up to be a wildly interesting season on and beyond
the waterfront.</LD>
<LD>   In the Santa Barbara area, where an unusually long salmon run
remains in progress, whales have stolen the spotlight.</LD>
<LD>   Sleek and magnificent blue whales, the largest creatures on the
planet, have arrived almost a month early in the Santa Barbara
Channel, where they're foraging on krill, tiny shrimp-like
crustaceans that are turning large patches of channel waters
blood-red.</LD>
<TE>   The blue whales, which reach lengths of about 100 feet, are the
main attraction but humpback whales, their much smaller sidekicks,
have been stealing the show.</TE>
<TE>   Like the blues, the humpbacks have come to regard the
nutrient-rich channel as a seasonal home, and should remain through
most of the summer. Unlike the blues, they don't seem to mind the
presence of boats and, it often seems, are as curious about people as
people are about them.</TE>
<TE>   "On our first trip Sunday we had two humpbacks that came alongside
our bow and spy-hopped [poked their heads out of the water at] us for
about a half-hour," says Fred Benko, captain of the Condor Express
out of Santa Barbara's Sea Landing. (The 75-foot catamaran is making
a splash of its own; it cruises at 30 knots and can cross the channel
in less than an hour.)</TE>
<TE>   The 90-foot Rachel G of Captain Don's Whale Watching Adventures at
Sterns Wharf is off to a memorable start as well. Don Hedden said
that on Monday, his customers saw killer whales five miles off
Goleta, humpback whales farther offshore and blue whales on the outer
fringes of the channel.</TE>
<TE>   Condor Cruises can be reached at (888) 779-4253 or
www.condorcruises.com. Capt. Don's can be reached at (805) 969-5217
or www.captdon.com.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Krill is not the only crustacean swirling in offshore currents.
Pelagic red crabs have taken a northbound journey in bands of warm
water and have been washing ashore on mainland and island shores.</TE>
<TE>   The crabs normally don't make it this far north and are said by
some to signal the onset of an El Nino effect, though scientists are
uncertain. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is
predicting only a "weak or moderate" El Nino to develop in the next
six to nine months--nothing like the whopper that dramatically
altered weather patterns and wreaked global havoc in 1997-98.</TE>
<TE>   Some outside the scientific community aren't so sure. They see
many similarities. With the red crabs has come another strange
invader. By-the-wind sailors, small jellyfish-like creatures that use
an air-filled pocket as a sail, have come ashore recently as far
north as Monterey and are floating by the thousands off Baja
California. They typically remain well offshore and in tropical or
sub-tropical waters.</TE>
<TE>   "They're everywhere," said Gene Allshouse, owner of San Quintin
Sportfishing, which is located 120 miles south of Ensenada.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Farther south, at Cabo San Lucas, there are odd signs that may
mean nothing. Jeff Klassen, a prominent surf-fishing guide, predicted
an early and outstanding season based simply on forecasts of an
impending El Nino. He made his prediction because surf fishing before
the 1997-98 El Nino, he said, was "phenomenal."</TE>
<TE>   The same situation is developing at Land's End now. Baitfish are
more plentiful and schooling up unusually close to shore, as happened
in the spring of '97, and with the small fish have come the larger
predators--roosterfish, jack crevalle, pargo, etc.--to which surf
fishermen like to cast.</TE>
<TE>   "We're already getting jack crevalle to 30-plus pounds and huge
cubera snappers, which didn't even show last year," Klassen said. The
much larger roosterfish are fattening up on the outer fringes of the
bait schools, mostly on the Pacific side, and are just starting to
venture into casting range.</TE>
<TE>   Klassen's six-week Cabo season starts May 31. His annual three-day
roosterfish tournament, during which anglers fish 11/2 days in a
panga and 11/2 days from the beach, is June 27-29. Details: (360)
402-3474 or at www.Reel1in.com.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Up the gulf at Baja's East Cape, baitfish have also bunched up
unusually close to shore. Chucky Van Wormer, manager at Palmas de
Cortez, said he took advantage of the situation by donning a mask and
snorkel and swimming through the schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I was swimming through all those fish and all of a sudden I was
face to face with a 600-pound male sea lion," he said. "He did not
want to share those fish with me. He growled and showed me what he
had to bite with. I got out of the water."</TE>
<TE>   The water temperature has climbed to 80-82 degrees at the East
Cape, sparking an exceptional marlin bite offshore. Van Wormer said
his customers are averaging "a minimum" of two marlin releases and
logging as many as seven per day.</TE>
<TE>   The oddest catch was that last month of a long-billed
spearfish--an Atlantic Ocean species.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Hawaii, some are attributing the wacky weather of late to a
developing El Nino.</TE>
<TE>   "We have all the signs of an impending El Nino," said Rick
Gaffney, a Kailua-Kona captain and author. "We had a major snowfall
on Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa [Monday night] and have had some
occasional blustery conditions on the normally calm Kona coast."</TE>
<TE>   Also, Gaffney said, the fishing is far from typical.</TE>
<TE>   The spring run on spearfish has yet to develop. The tuna showed
very early, but the marlin, which typically arrive during the spring,
have not shown in their usual large numbers.</TE>
<TE>   What have shown are mahi-mahi, "tons of them, including some over
50 pounds," Gaffney said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   El Nino seems to have many messengers. One of them arrived in
October on Will Rogers State Beach near Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   It was a tiny northern fur seal pup that had come all the way from
San Miguel Island, a rookery located 60 miles off Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Severely malnourished, she ended up at the Marine Mammal Care
Center at Fort MacArthur in San Pedro. The center is accustomed to
getting elephant seals, harbor seals and sea lions.</TE>
<TE>   But it hadn't had a northern fur seal since the one that arrived
during the El Nino winter of 1997-98.</TE>
<TE>   The latest was only the fifth to have been brought to the facility
since it opened in October 1992. The previous four arrived
immediately before or during El Nino winters.</TE>
<TE>   Southland Bite</TE>
<TE>   * White seabass: The big news remains the white seabass bite at
Catalina. It's either slow or fantastic; timing is everything. For
example, on Wednesday the fish didn't decide to feed until 6 p.m.,
long after most of the boats had left. Anglers who stayed were
rewarded. On Thursday, fishermen on some boats caught their one-fish
limits in the dark, then the bite ended. This is the essence of
seabass fishing: You know they're there, but you never know when
they'll surface.</TE>
<TE>   * Barracuda: These speedy game fish are moving too fast for the
fleets to keep up with. They have appeared in Santa Monica Bay, then
off Huntington Beach and, Thursday, off San Clemente. Until more
schools show, fishing will be hit and miss.</TE>
<TE>   * Yellowtail: The fish are breezing around the Coronado Islands
and nearby Rockpile, but anglers aboard San Diego overnight boats are
having to wait between bites. Improvement appears imminent, however.</TE>
<TE>   * Albacore: Stay tuned. The flurry of two weeks ago has yet to be
repeated.</TE>
<TE>   Riding High</TE>
<TE>   The Surfers Hall of Fame in Huntington Beach on Saturday will
induct five-time U.S. champion Corky Carroll, Robert August of
"Endless Summer" fame and Robert "Wingnut" Weaver, the innovative
long-board specialist and one of the stars of "Endless Summer II."
The ceremony is at 10 a.m. in front of Huntington Surf and Sport on
the corner of Pacific Coast Highway and Main Street.</TE>
<TE>   Why them?</TE>
<TE>   "These three are special," Hall of Fame founder Aaron Pai said.
"They represent past eras and present eras of surfing. They're all
champions who had a lot of influence and a great amount of
contributions to the sport of surfing."</TE>
<TE>   Why this weekend?</TE>
<TE>   "We're like the Mann's Chinese Theater in that we have to have
them present to get their footprints and handprints, and hopefully an
inspirational saying that they can share with the public," Pai said.
"We had to choose a time when they were all available."</TE>
<TE>   The Hall of Fame, which had always been inside the store, is
moving outside beginning Saturday. More than 3,000 square feet of
sidewalk has been set aside for the imprints of future inductees.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 2, during the U.S. Open of Surfing, the Hall will induct
Kelly Slater, Laird Hamilton and Joel Tudor.</TE>
<TE>   Winding Up</TE>
<TE>   The National Safe Boating Campaign begins its weeklong run
Saturday, in advance of the busy and often deadly Memorial Day
holiday weekend. Boaters can do their part to cut down on the
senseless tragedies that occur every season by taking a free safety
course being offered by the Boat Owners Assn. of the United States.
The course is recognized by the U.S. Coast Guard, and can be taken
on-line at www.boatus.com.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I miss the NFL.</LD>
<LD>   There, I said it.</LD>
<LD>   I know that doesn't sound particularly cultured or enlightened.</LD>
<TE>   But it has been seven years now, and I no longer care who knows
it.</TE>
<TE>   I miss the NFL. I miss feeling connected to the rest of the
country on fall Sunday afternoons. I miss feeling connected to the
neighbors on winter Monday nights.</TE>
<TE>   I miss football-watching parties that mean something. I miss NFL
drafts that change something. I miss being swept up in an unmatched
feeling of civic unity engendered not by a sophisticated concert or
festival, but by the gross, gaudy, splendid Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   I miss hating the 49ers, feuding with the Broncos, ignoring the
Chargers. I miss Al Davis the way I miss a four-inch wood splinter in
the soft flesh of my foot, but that's another story.</TE>
<TE>   I miss the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   No, I don't miss it enough to put my tax money into a stadium;
nobody should be so misguided.</TE>
<TE>   And, no, I don't miss it enough to go begging for a team, the
dreadful results of which will be witnessed this fall by those
suckers.</TE>
<TE>   But I miss the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   Which makes me thrilled to discover that this latest stadium
proposal is a hit.</TE>
<TE>   We don't pay. We don't beg. And if we're lucky, maybe we don't
even have to deal with anyone named Spanos.</TE>
<TE>   I don't understand a lot of the economic quotes proffered in the
wake of the Anschutz Entertainment Group's announcement that it is
hoping to build a stadium that will bring an NFL team to town for the
first time since the summer of 1995.</TE>
<TE>   But I did understand one.</TE>
<TE>   "If this doesn't work, the NFL has to realize, they could be
taking the best shot they've ever had at bringing a team to Los
Angeles and screwing it up," said Tim Leiweke, AEG president.</TE>
<TE>   He's right. Of all the nutty ideas that have been floated in the
last eight years, this is the first one that truly flies.</TE>
<TE>   This could work. This can work. If the NFL is ever to return to
Los Angeles in Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's lifetime--and he
desperately needs it to complete his legacy--then this must work.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, the football interests here are being
represented by one group.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, this is a group with a resume, having already
built one of the most successful basketball arenas in the country.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, this is a group with some punch, telling the
NFL they are not interested in being used for expansion or leverage.</TE>
<TE>   And for the first time, it's their money, not ours.</TE>
<TE>   The Anschutz folks were pushed into agreeing to foot most of the
bill when they built Staples Center--for about the same price, $400
million to $450 million--and they have lived up to their word. We
have no reason not to believe them now.</TE>
<TE>   "I like what I heard," Mayor James K. Hahn said Thursday with a
grin. "This is a public-private partnership where the private side
pays the bills."</TE>
<TE>   We don't pay, and we don't beg.</TE>
<TE>   There will be no huge expansion fee. There will be no demeaning
visits by clueless NFL owners who wonder--as their own small markets
are dying--whether this town has enough sports heart.</TE>
<TE>   The message from the Anschutz folks to the football folks is a
simple one.</TE>
<TE>   You've got a team that wants to move? You loan us a few bucks and
give us a couple of Super Bowls, and we'll build them the Staples
Center of football stadiums.</TE>
<TE>   And if not?</TE>
<TE>   "If they don't show us good faith, Phil [Anschutz] and I will
disappear very quickly," Leiweke said.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the league was impressed or anything, but this week they
formed a committee just to direct the traffic, and good thing. Teams
are already lining up, led by San Diego or Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, I know, the Chargers are run by arguably the game's worst
owners who are not named Bidwill. And, yeah, the Colts have been a
joke since leaving Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   But a good owner is not going to move his team, right? So we're
going to get a dog. But maybe it will be an old dog, or a dog with
pups who want to change things, or a smart dog who will let sharp
young Casey Wasserman run the show.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't matter. They will learn quickly, in this market, they
either win or become the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   They will also learn what is already known by those who add UCLA
and USC football attendance totals when both teams play at home on
the same day.</TE>
<TE>   Before it was anything else, this was a football town. Even half
of those 120,000-plus folks who fill our college stadiums some
Saturdays would be enough for a pro team.</TE>
<TE>   So, you say, you have gotten along just fine without the NFL, that
you enjoy watching your three games every Sunday on TV. You are not
alone. The overwhelming feeling here has been apathy, and with good
reason.</TE>
<TE>   But don't you think that once a team arrives, you won't just be a
little interested? Even if you can't afford tickets won't you follow
them at least a little the way you follow other groups with "Los
Angeles" on the shirts?</TE>
<TE>   The last two Laker championship parades have shown that the pro
teams here are embraced by thousands of fans who will never see a
game in person. Just because many people here won't be attending
doesn't mean they won't be paying attention.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, the Anschutz folks are like any other real estate
outfit trying to get rich. But just as obviously, a team that won't
cost us anything is a valuable city asset. And that doesn't even
count a Super Bowl's economic impact of $200 million to $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   It would be more romantic to build the stadium at the Coliseum or
Rose Bowl. But it's going to be a lot cheaper, and far less
political, to build it on those South Park parking lots.</TE>
<TE>   And, certainly, it would be more Hollywood if the project were run
by somebody like former mogul Michael Ovitz. But his people never
showed us the money.</TE>
<TE>   The Anschutz group has shown us not only the money, but also the
ability to turn it into an arena that has energized three teams and
occasionally brought together a city.</TE>
<TE>   Now they want to do it again.</TE>
<TE>   It is time for our government and the NFL to show they are
listening.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Afghan boys and girls are streaming back into Kabul's schools at a
rate that is exceeding all expectations, a U.N. spokesman said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Manoel de Almeida e Silva said a "snap survey"--preliminary
polling by the United Nations Children's Fund of half the Afghan
capital's 200 elementary schools--found that 34% more children of
elementary school age were enrolled than had been expected. About
202,000 students are enrolled in Kabul's elementary schools, he said,
and 100,000 of them are girls--42% more than anticipated.</LD>
<LD>   During the hard-line Taliban regime's five-year rule, girls older
than 8 were not allowed to attend school.</LD>
<TE>   Almeida said first-grade enrollment showed a 68% increase since
school opened March 23.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations expects broader tallies of school enrollment
from Kabul and around the nation by the end of the month. There have
been complaints from rural areas that schools there have not been
assisted to the same degree as those in the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees called on countries such as Australia that have large
numbers of Afghan refugees not to pressure them to return home.</TE>
<TE>   UNHCR spokesman Yusuf Hassan said in Kabul that 590,000 Afghans
had returned to the shattered country since March 1, mainly from
neighboring Pakistan, but that about 40% were finding their homes had
been destroyed.</TE>

<HD>Poachers' Paradise in Papua</HD>
<DH>Indonesian police and troops' role in the illicit trade of
protected birds in the province makes it difficult for authorities to
crack down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ABEPURA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>In the dim light of the Indonesian warship, forestry police commander
Otis Howay could hear the rare birds calling, their bright song
reverberating in the metal chambers.</LD>
<LD>   He and two of his officers hurriedly searched the navy troop ship
for protected tropical birds being smuggled out of Indonesia's Papua
province, formerly Irian Jaya, by soldiers ending their tour of duty.
They confiscated seven black-capped lories, beautiful birds of vivid
red and green, but Howay is certain that there were many more.</LD>
<LD>   "It was very dark on the ship," he recounted. "I heard a lot of
voices of the birds, but I could not see them. The time was very
short, and the ship was about to leave."</LD>
<TE>   Illegally catching and selling protected wildlife are big business
in Papua, the untamed eastern province of Indonesia that makes up
half the island of New Guinea. Many indigenous islanders take part,
especially in hunting and catching the birds. But the biggest
smugglers, according to police and environmentalists, are members of
Indonesia's powerful military.</TE>
<TE>   "They are untouchable," said Roy Rindorindo of the World Wide Fund
for Nature in Jayapura, the provincial capital. "They have their own
ships and airplanes. They collect the birds, bring them back to
Jakarta and sell them."</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of protected birds are caught or killed by poachers and
smuggled out of the province each year, threatening the survival of
the remote island's rarest species, officials and environmentalists
say.</TE>
<TE>   B.G. Resubun, Howay's boss at the Natural Resources Conservation
Department, said the widespread involvement of soldiers and police in
the wildlife trade--something law enforcement officials
acknowledge--adds to the difficulty of cracking down.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very scared, because these people intimidate us," Resubun
said. "I can't prove it, but people know that high-level people have
a hobby of collecting all the endangered species."</TE>
<TE>   Demand for birds is great in Indonesia. It has long been a symbol
of prestige to own one, especially a lory or cockatoo, which sing or
can be trained to talk.</TE>
<TE>   Pet birds are most popular on the main island of Java, which is
less than a third the size of Papua but has a population of 121
million.</TE>
<TE>   According to Javanese tradition, a man must have five things to
rise above the ordinary: a house, a horse or car, the traditional
dagger known as a kris, a bird and, last of all, a wife.</TE>
<TE>   Bakdi Soemanto, professor of cultural sciences at the University
of Gajah Mada in Yogyakarta, said some Javanese believe that birds
can bring enlightenment or serve as a symbol of a person's character,
much as a birth sign would. Some birds, such as the lory, are thought
to ward off supernatural beings. But most of all, people like to hear
them sing.</TE>
<TE>   "Javanese people love birds," Soemanto said. "But the way they
love them is not by setting them free but by putting them in a cage."</TE>
<TE>   A recent trip to the Hamadi market in Jayapura showed that it was
easy to find protected birds for sale, dead or alive.</TE>
<TE>   Souvenir shops openly sold stuffed birds of paradise for the
equivalent of $25. They offered headdresses and ornaments made with
bird of paradise tail feathers, as well as decorated eggs of the
cassowary, whose leg bones are used to make knives. One shop owner
offered a black-capped lory for about $55, enough to support a family
here for a month.</TE>
<TE>   At an open stall, a trader named Mustafa was willing to sell a
sulfur-crested cockatoo for the equivalent of $65.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged that selling it was illegal but said taking it out
of the province would be easy.</TE>
<TE>   "You can carry it by airplane, by ship," he said. "You just
arrange it with the officer in the airport."</TE>
<TE>   So it seems. At the Jayapura airport and the harbor, a few of the
passengers wait to board with special luggage--small cardboard boxes
with holes cut in them. Sometimes, the boxes shake on their own.</TE>
<TE>   The forestry police say that they have tried to search the market
for protected birds but that every time they plan a raid, word leaks
out and the creatures are hidden by the time they arrive.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of our problems," said Resubun, the head of the
conservation department for Papua's eastern region. "If we make an
inspection, they know it in advance. We go to the market, and they
just laugh. Maybe we have to change our system."</TE>
<TE>   Resubun acknowledged that his agency is largely ineffective in
protecting wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   The department has 54 officers to patrol more than half the
province, he said. They share one car and one boat.</TE>
<TE>   "We are lacking control, I can say honestly," Resubun said.</TE>
<TE>   The military, whose main role in Papua is to keep the local
population in check, has operated with impunity here for decades. The
brief search that Howay and his men conducted on the troop ship in
March is rarer than the birds they are trying to protect.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers have been known to pull their weapons on the unarmed
forestry police when questioned about their activities, officials
say.</TE>
<TE>   Despite widespread knowledge of military involvement in the
illegal export of wildlife from the province, no soldier or officer
has been arrested for capturing or smuggling protected animals.</TE>
<TE>   "That is our weakness," Howay said. "We can't press charges
against the military."</TE>
<TE>   Papua Police Chief Made M. Pastika acknowledged that the army
plays a major part in smuggling wildlife from the province. Police
officers are involved too, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the illegal trafficking of the birds, endangered species,
is suspected [to be] done with the backing of the authorities, like
police and military personnel," he said. "We are very concerned about
this."</TE>
<TE>   One of the main army units allegedly involved in smuggling
wildlife is Kopassus, the elite force that once received training
from the U.S. military. Washington severed military ties with
Indonesia in 1999 after army-sponsored militias destroyed much of
East Timor, but some Bush administration officials and Indonesian
generals hope to resume cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Gen. Mahidin Simbolon, the Indonesian military commander in
Papua, said he has seen no evidence that soldiers or officers are
involved.</TE>
<TE>   He has advised his troops not to engage in the illegal wildlife
trade, he said, and has authorized searches of their belongings.</TE>
<TE>   Simbolon has also invited representatives of the World Wide Fund
for Nature to speak to the troops about protected wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   "There are indeed some accusations that the soldiers take them
out," the general said. "If that is true, then we have to take care
of it internally, and that is what we are doing at the moment."</TE>
<TE>   Papua is one of the least explored places on Earth. Slightly
larger than California, it has a population of 2.5 million, including
many tribespeople only decades removed from the Stone Age. Some
believe that there are still tribes in the rugged highlands of the
interior that have never had contact with the outside world.</TE>
<TE>   The diversity of the island's species is remarkable. There are
freshwater sharks and saltwater crocodiles, birdwing butterflies, and
fruit bats with a 5-foot wingspan. Among the island's mammals are
egg-laying echidnas and tree kangaroos that probably migrated to the
island from Australia when the two were linked by land 6,000 years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   A lack of mammalian predators has allowed the evolution of a great
variety of bird life on New Guinea, including 30 bird of paradise
species, renowned for their long, colorful tail feathers.</TE>
<TE>   Papua is also home to the endangered palm cockatoo; the cassowary,
with sharp claws that can disembowel a human; the Victoria crowned
pigeon with its majestic feather crest; the hornbill, with its huge
curved beak; and the brightly colored black-capped lory, a type of
parrot.</TE>
<TE>   Natives have long hunted the creatures, particularly the birds of
paradise, whose feathers are favored for decorating headdresses used
in ritual ceremonies and headhunting raids.</TE>
<TE>   International trade in the birds of paradise dates to the 14th
century, when their plumes adorned the headdresses of the sultans'
guards at the Turkish court.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 19th century, the feathers were so popular in Europe
that the birds became New Guinea's most valuable resource.</TE>
<TE>   Amid concern that the birds would be driven to extinction, trade
in birds of paradise was banned in 1924, but hunting has never
stopped.</TE>
<TE>   Hunters catch most birds by stringing nets between trees, but the
birds of paradise are among the hardest to nab. Usually, hunters
simply shoot them and stuff them for decoration. The males'
spectacular mating displays, occurring regularly in the mornings and
evenings, make them an easy target.</TE>
<TE>   In January, one forest police officer, Elsama Anton Wakum, 30,
confiscated five stuffed birds of paradise from a smuggler who
allegedly was delivering them from one police officer to another.</TE>
<TE>   Two nights later, Wakum was struck in the head with a piece of
wood. His body was found by the side of theroad in the morning. The
birds are missing. Police are investigating the slaying. Even when
the conservation department manages to seize live birds, they are not
always better off. Releasing a creature back into the wild requires a
pile of paperwork and signatures all the way up to the provincial
governor.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of being set free, many of the confiscated birds spend the
rest of their lives at a house in the town of Sentani, near the
Jayapura airport. One aging palm cockatoo is chained up in the yard.
A large hornbill has become a pet of the local children, who delight
in carrying it around. Sulfur-crested cockatoos are kept in a room
with windows too dirty to see out. Three Victoria crowned
pigeons--inveterate pacers--are kept in a narrow wooden cage with
barely enough room to turn around.</TE>
<TE>   Down the road, Dr. John Manangsang has set up an alternative bird
sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   It began when a soldier brought him a bird of paradise that he had
shot in the wing.</TE>
<TE>   Manangsang, a general practitioner, healed the bird and bought it.
Word spread, and soon he had acquired 40 birds of paradise, sea
eagles, hornbills and cockatoos, many of them wounded or ailing.</TE>
<TE>   He built an aviary for the birds of paradise and allowed the
public to come see them. He let his three crowned pigeons wander
freely in an outdoor enclosure.</TE>
<TE>   Manangsang said he was trying to protect the birds and keep them
from being smuggled out of Papua, but the conservation department
prosecuted him for possessing protected wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   The doctor lost in a lower court but appealed to the Supreme Court
and won. The conservation department issued him a license that allows
him to keep the birds.</TE>
<TE>   Now he dreams of building a facility where he can breed his birds
of paradise and release their offspring into the wild.</TE>
<TE>   "The birds are very threatened here, and I have to do something
about it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to educate people to love nature so that when we release
the birds, people will not kill them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Before inspecting the warship in March, Howay notified the navy
that he and his officers would come to search the soldiers'
possessions for illegal wildlife as the troops boarded. About 800
troops were scheduled to depart that day aboard the Teluk Penyu 535.</TE>
<TE>   But when the officers arrived at the appointed time, the soldiers
were already on board and the ship was about to leave. Howay and his
men were given less than half an hour to search the ship. One
officer, who was not in uniform, was not allowed on board.   Howay,
30, said he had planned to arrest any soldiers found to be smuggling
wildlife but decided that it would not be wise to try to take
suspects off the ship.</TE>
<TE>   "It is quite a risky thing to do," he said. "People ask me why we
can't do anything about the military, but the forestry police are
empty-handed while the military has weapons to scare people."</TE>

<DH>Afghanistan: For ethnic Hazaras who fled a Taliban
massacre, life in the cliffs is full of danger. Agencies try to help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAMIAN, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Sanawbar Hussain had walked the path a hundred times, up the steep
cliff from the cave where she makes her home. But this time, as she
hurried to reach her crying baby one day last winter, she stepped on
a land mine a few feet from the mouth of her cave.</LD>
<LD>   In one of the most remote corners of Afghanistan, in an area where
displaced families live in caves carved in sandstone cliffs, Hussain
managed to get emergency surgery at a tiny clinic run by the
International Committee of the Red Cross. A Finnish surgeon amputated
her right leg and saved her life.</LD>
<LD>   Land mines are just one hazard among many for the cave dwellers of
Bamian. The families scavenge for food while children die of disease
or malnutrition. They freeze in the harsh winters and breathe noxious
smoke from the crude stoves that heat their caves and their food.
There is little work for the men, no school for the children, no
solace for the women.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a very hard way to live, but our caves are all we have
left," said Hussain's husband, Mohammed, a long-limbed man with wild
black hair and yellow teeth.</TE>
<TE>   The Hussains and hundreds of other ethnic Hazaras, a Shiite Muslim
minority in a predominantly Sunni nation, have been living in caves
since the Taliban pillaged and burned a string of Hazara villages
west of Bamian in central Afghanistan last summer, slaughtering
thousands of people. International relief agencies have been
uncovering mass graves in the area since January.</TE>
<TE>   The caves were hewn in the same sheer cliffs as the two majestic
Buddha statues that were destroyed by the Taliban in March 2001. Some
are centuries old, cut in the cliff face by early Buddhist monks for
monastic cells and later used by ascetics, hermits and nomads. Many
once contained frescoes, statues and elaborate lantern roofs.</TE>
<TE>   The caves honeycomb the cliffs, some more than 100 feet up and
accessible only by roughhewn steps.</TE>
<TE>   About 400 people live in the caves, according to Werner Amrein,
head of the small Red Cross delegation in Bamian. Almost all are
Hazara survivors of the villages plundered by the Taliban. Every
three months, they receive Red Cross rations of rice, biscuits and
vegetable oil, along with blankets, tarps and jerrycans. The supplies
have helped reduce, but not eliminate, child mortality, Amrein said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the men, who normally are subsistence farmers, earn the
equivalent of a dollar a day hauling produce on donkey carts in the
Bamian bazaar. The women and children haul water from streams and
forage for firewood. The cave dwellers say their children aren't
allowed to attend Bamian's schools because they aren't registered in
the town.</TE>
<TE>   Karim Khalili, the Hazara warlord who rules Bamian and the
surrounding region known as Hazarajat, said the cave dwellers should
return to their villages as soon as possible and begin rebuilding
homes and schools. But the families say their fields have been mined
by the Taliban and they have no money for reconstruction.</TE>
<TE>   "The ones in the caves are the lucky ones," Khalili said,
shrugging. "Other refugees are living in the mountains, in tents, in
abandoned houses."</TE>
<TE>   Khalili himself had no home when he returned in triumph to Bamian
in mid-November after his soldiers drove out the Taliban with the
help of U.S. warplanes and Special Forces units. He said he lived
temporarily in the Red Cross clinic, which had been ransacked by the
Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   In Bamian, where caves are a prime residential option, housing is
primitive and in short supply.</TE>
<TE>   Khalili, for instance, now lives in what he calls his "guest
house," a modest, reconstructed concrete building where Special
Forces soldiers are frequent guests, arriving in pickups or dune
buggies.</TE>
<TE>   The Special Forces soldiers are housed in a rough, fortress-like
compound made of mud and clay, guarded by Khalili's gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   Red Cross officials and other Western relief workers live in a
tent city within a compound of mud and concrete buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Compared to some of the local housing options, the caves are airy
and relatively comfortable, thanks to "home improvements." The
dwellers have installed wooden doors and window frames fitted with
clear plastic. They've carved shelves into the walls, covered the
floors with tarps, and put decorations and coat hooks on the walls.</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece of each cave is a homemade stove, complete with
elaborate piping that vents most smoke but permits a permanent blue
haze to settle in, especially at mealtimes.</TE>
<TE>   "We can survive here, but we are accustomed to proper houses. We
had very fine homes before the Taliban destroyed them," said Mohammed
Hussein, a squat, bearded man of 35. He has carved an elaborate
staircase leading to his cave, halfway up the yellow cliffs, where
his family and his brother's family live in a single room.</TE>
<TE>   Just below Hussein's cave is the cave that housed Sanawbar
Hussain, who was eight months pregnant when she stepped on the land
mine on a dirt path above her home in late January. She lay bleeding
for 30 minutes, she said, before someone fetched her husband from the
bazaar and he found a car to take her to the clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Because the clinic had been plundered by the Taliban, it was
barely functioning and still being refurbished, said Norma McRae, the
project manager. But a tiny operating theater has been restored.
There, Dr. Yukka Siegberg, a Finnish surgeon who has performed more
than 3,000 amputations in Afghanistan, removed Hussain's right leg.
She lost her baby.</TE>
<TE>   After eight more visits for skin grafts to her left leg, Hussain
recuperated in a recovery room at the clinic. In the next bed was
another cave dweller, a premature baby named Sardar. Born in a cave,
she was a month old but weighed just 2 pounds. She fit easily into
the palm of Michael Woodman, a Zimbabwean physician who was trying to
save her.</TE>
<TE>   "The prognosis is pretty poor," Woodman said through a translator
to the baby's mother, Sima, a slender girl of 17. "She's so small and
weak."</TE>
<TE>   Sima was weak herself, and she sat slumped in a chair. She said
she had tried, with little success, to breast-feed the baby until her
mother insisted that they go to the clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Woodman began trying to feed the baby fortified infant formula
through a nose tube. Sardar, wrinkled, red-faced and barely visible
inside a swaddling cloth, let out a weak squawk. Woodman turned to
the mother. "I'm sorry," he said. "It really doesn't look good."</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks later, Hussain and her husband arrived in Kabul, the
capital, for treatment at a Red Cross orthopedic center. Freshly
scrubbed and seated in a wheelchair, she looked radiant and healthy.
The skin grafts had saved her left leg from amputation.</TE>
<TE>   Hussain had news about Sardar, the premature baby.</TE>
<TE>   "Alive," she said. "The baby is still alive." The infant formula
had saved the child, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Hussain faces several weeks of physical therapy. She will be
fitted for a prothesis and will learn to walk again.</TE>
<TE>   "She needs to work harder," said Alberto Cairo, the orthopedic
center's director, patting Hussain's shoulder. "She's lazy."</TE>
<TE>   Hussain blushed and smiled. "I want to learn to walk," she told
Cairo. "I want to be able to go back home."</TE>
<TE>   If she works hard, Cairo promised her, it will be only a matter of
weeks before she is back home in the caves of Bamian.</TE>

<HD>Carter Visit May Boost Growing Cuba Trade</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK FINEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HAVANA</DL>
<LD>Just across town from the diplomatic residence where former President
Carter spent three emotional hours Thursday with Cuba's top
dissidents, the container ship Express quietly docked in Havana
harbor.</LD>
<LD>   Aboard the 526-foot ship chartered out of Jacksonville, Fla., were
tons of frozen Michigan turkeys sold to Cuba by a trading company in
Carter's home state, Georgia, along with hundreds of thousands of
eggs from the American Northeast.</LD>
<LD>   The shipment is the latest in a series of American food imports to
this island now allowed despite a 4-decade-old U.S. trade embargo.</LD>
<TE>   The coincidental timing of the Express' arrival--coming as
Carter's five-day visit rekindles the debate about U.S.-Cuban
relations, the embargo and the issue of human rights in the island
nation--was symbolic of the incremental yet significant changes that
have taken place between the United States and Cuba in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   On the political front Thursday, there were clear signs that
Carter's trip is having an impact here.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling Communist Party's daily newspaper, Granma, surprised
many by filling more than two pages with a verbatim transcript of a
speech Carter gave Tuesday to the Cuban people. The televised address
included a bold call on Cuban President Fidel Castro to give his
people greater freedoms, along with an appeal to the Bush
administration to end the embargo.</TE>
<TE>   The Cuban government also permitted Carter to meet freely and in
private with nearly two dozen prominent dissidents, who then spoke
openly to the foreign media gathered outside. Most of the activists
were effusive in their thanks to Carter for, as one of them said,
"validating" their existence.</TE>
<TE>   But in the short term, the former president's trip might have an
even greater impact on economic relations between the U.S. and Cuba,
several analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Carter also sharply condemned Washington's Cuba policy during his
speech here. He called on America to take the first step in
normalizing relations by ending the embargo.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the White House's flat rejection of Carter's appeal to
lift the embargo and the widespread speculation that President Bush
will announce further sanctions during a visit to Florida next week,
Cuban officials and U.S. economic analysts say American exports to
Cuba are likely to increase in the coming months.</TE>
<TE>   Trade to Continue</TE>
<TE>   Despite Sanctions</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, said Vicki Huddleston, who heads the U.S.
diplomatic mission here, the trade will continue apace.</TE>
<TE>   "It has to," she said. "It's the law."</TE>
<TE>   The cash purchases were authorized by Bush's predecessor. In
October 2000, President Clinton signed the Trade Sanctions Reform and
Export Enhancement Act, which allows Cuba to buy U.S. food and
medicine, though only on a cash basis, as an exception to the
embargo.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Castro balked. The Cuban leader, who has remained in
power for 43 years despite the embargo and the collapse of his
longtime benefactor, the Soviet Union, said he would not buy "a
single grain" of American rice unless the U.S. lifted a cash-only
restriction.</TE>
<TE>   Hurricane Changes</TE>
<TE>   Castro's Position</TE>
<TE>   Then, in November, along came Hurricane Michelle. The storm
devastated the island's agricultural breadbasket, threatening Cuba's
strategic food reserves. In response, the U.S. government offered to
send food aid to the island.</TE>
<TE>   Castro declined. But the offer spawned separate yet parallel moves
by the Cuban leader and by the U.S. agricultural companies that have
been lobbying Congress for years to open the Cuban market.</TE>
<TE>   Castro initially said Cuba would make a one-time purchase of U.S.
goods to replenish food stocks. But it quickly became much more than
that.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's shipment on the Florida-based Crowley Liner Services,
which chartered the Express, was part of a third round of purchases
by Cuba's state-run Alimport, according to the company's president,
Pedro Alvarez. Crowley made the first U.S. food delivery in December.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at a news conference this week that was almost unnoticed
amid coverage of Carter's history-making visit, Alvarez said the
550,000 tons of American goods that Cuba has bought since the first
contract was signed in November represent 10% of the island's $1
billion in annual food imports. He added that Cuba plans to keep
buying, and even expand its purchases to include as many as 300 new
products, including brand-name items.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. industry sources believe that Cuba's annual food-import bill
is closer to $750 million but that the country remains a significant,
attractive and largely untapped market.</TE>
<TE>   "The blockade is hurting us," Alvarez said, "but it is hurting
U.S. companies even more, because it denies them easy access to a
nearby market."</TE>
<TE>   The portly, silver-haired Alvarez described himself as an
entrepreneur, "not a politician." But clearly, the food purchases and
the strategy behind them are as political as they are economic.</TE>
<TE>   "The purchases made in November clearly had a political
component," said John Kavulich, president of the New York-based
U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, which provides encyclopedic
commercial information about Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   "The Cuban government quite smartly determined in November 2001
that the way to re-energize the business community in the U.S. and
the way to re-energize Congress for initiatives on Cuba was to
provide financial value to a desired constituency," Kavulich added in
a telephone interview this week.</TE>
<TE>   An analysis published Wednesday by Kavulich's council of the
ensuing trade showed its broad potential political impact on the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The imported products--ranging from corn, rice and wheat to
chicken livers, turkey and peas--came from 27 U.S. states that have
344 of the 538 votes in the Electoral College.</TE>
<TE>   Those states also account for about 66% of the members of the
House and 54% of the Senate, the council said.</TE>
<TE>   And that was no coincidence, according to U.S. industry sources.
Many of the producing states are represented in Congress by
legislators who have been fighting the hardest to ease or lift the
Cuban embargo and to pass legislation permitting travel by U.S.
citizens to the island. Many of those same legislators issued
statements this week praising Carter's visit and strongly endorsing
his call to lift all U.S. sanctions on Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Such a voting bloc, analysts say, eventually could counter the
small yet vocal and vote-rich Cuban American lobby in South Florida,
which has influenced U.S.-Cuba policy for decades. The lobby has
helped shape national election results in the past and is crucial to
the reelection bid in November of the American president's brother,
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The political impact of U.S. food exports to Cuba has not been
lost on the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of a strategy to get financing and get the travel ban
lifted," Huddleston said, although the mission head added that the
food is helping Cubans at a time when the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
have further hurt their economy by cutting into vital tourist trade.</TE>
<TE>   U.S.-Cuba Trade</TE>
<TE>   Bolstered by Carter</TE>
<TE>   In March, conservatives in the Bush administration went so far as
to revoke Alvarez's visa to visit the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez insists that his trip was meant to reinforce business
relationships with his U.S. suppliers. Administration sources said
they suspected Alvarez's real motives were to lobby Congress and the
American people.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez denied the charge and said he will apply for another visa
in the coming days.</TE>
<TE>   Still, despite the toughening of the administration's position on
Cuba that has accompanied Carter's trip this week, some industry
analysts believe that the visit might well bolster the burgeoning
U.S.-Cuba trade.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite likely, there will be a spike in the commercial
transactions to compensate for or to deflect from what might not
happen on the political side," Kavulich said.</TE>
<TE>   Taking a longer view, he said: "The relationship between the U.S.
and Cuba has always been about a series of moments--not a single
moment.... The visit by President Carter is a significant moment, but
it's not a seminal moment. The relationship will change in
incremental steps."</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line: Many of the key steps will be in commerce.</TE>
<TE>   "What has been the barometer in the relationship in the last four
years? It's been the commercial angle," Kavulich said. "Commerce is
the only facet you can look at and say, 'Yeah, there have been
changes there.'"</TE>

<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Mexican police found a stolen truck on Thursday that had been
carrying 10 tons of sodium cyanide, but most of the deadly chemicals
were missing.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities discovered the truck abandoned along a highway in
Zacatlan, about 120 miles southeast of Mexico City in the state of
Puebla.</LD>
<LD>   Only about half a ton of the cyanide, contained in barrels, was
still inside the truck and investigators were searching for the
remainder, police said.</LD>
<TE>   One barrel had been opened, sparking concerns of a health hazard.
But officials found no evidence of contamination, said Frederico
Perez, director of police in neighboring Hidalgo state.</TE>
<TE>   No one has been arrested in connection with the truck robbery,
which took place last Friday. Police were seeking information about
three armed men who witnesses say stole the vehicle, Perez said.</TE>
<TE>   Sodium cyanide is used in gold and silver mining.</TE>
<TE>   If inhaled or ingested, it attacks the nervous system and can
cause a person to suffocate within minutes.</TE>

<HD>Sherpa Kin Among 54 on Everest</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KATMANDU, Nepal</DL>
<LD>It got crowded in the so-called Death Zone on Mt. Everest on
Thursday, as a record 54 people stood atop the world's highest
peak--including a grandson of one of the first two men to conquer it
in 1953. The son of the other was headed for the summit on a slower
route.</LD>
<LD>   Basking in rare, fine weather was Tashi Wangchuk Tenzing, whose
Sherpa grandfather, Tenzing Norgay, made history when he and New
Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary made it to the summit 49 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Still ascending in a separate expedition was Peter Hillary, who is
retracing his father's route with a National Geographic film crew.</LD>
<TE>   The two men had hoped to meet on the roof of the world--29,035
feet above sea level--to begin a year of celebrations ahead of the
50th anniversary of the first successful ascent, May 29, 1953.
However, Peter Hillary's route was slower and he was not among those
who made it to the top Thursday. Climbers cannot stay at the summit
for long, and by nightfall Tashi Wangchuk Tenzing was on his way back
down.</TE>
<TE>   Both men have climbed the mountain previously--Tenzing in 1997 and
Hillary in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Tenzing Norgay died in 1986, and the elder Hillary still lives in
New Zealand.</TE>

<LD>The European Union failed again Thursday to agree on the legal status
of 13 exiled Palestinian militants and conditions for them to enter
the EU under a deal with Israel.</LD>
<LD>   The militants, who were allowed by Israel to go into exile, are
staying under heavy guard at a hotel in Cyprus after spending five
weeks in Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity surrounded by Israeli
forces.</LD>
<LD>   A decision on the men was deferred until today.</LD>
<TE>   EU states have been wrangling since last week to decide the
destinations and legal status of the men, while Cyprus, a candidate
for EU membership, has twice extended a deadline for their departure.</TE>
<TE>   Six countries--Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain and
Portugal--have agreed to receive the men. Diplomats said it was
unclear whether others would also offer to take them in.</TE>
<TE>   Some countries say their laws prevent them from taking in the 13,
whom Israel has accused of planning attacks on Israelis.</TE>

<DL>HYDERABAD, India</DL>
<LD>The death toll from a heat wave in the southeastern Indian state of
Andhra Pradesh climbed to 622 Thursday, even as rain fell in some
areas, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said more deaths had been reported in remote coastal
districts. Most were of people admitted to a hospital after suffering
sunstroke in the last week.</LD>
<LD>   The heat wave is the worst in four years and comes ahead of the
annual monsoon rain that usually hits the coast of the southwestern
state of Kerala in June and spreads across the rest of the country
over the following three months.</LD>
<TE>   Officials said temperatures, which reached a peak of 118 degrees
in the worst-affected areas, had fallen in the preceding two days
because of the rain, the first since March.</TE>
<TE>   "I have seen many summers, but nothing like this year," said
Bheemudu, 44, a rickshaw puller in Vijaywada who uses only one name.
"When the hot wind hit my face, I felt as if I was set on fire."</TE>

<HD>Former Jordanian Legislator Sentenced</HD>
<DH>Trial: Toujan Faisal, the nation's first female lawmaker,
gets 11/2 years for criticizing regime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AMMAN, Jordan</DL>
<LD>A military court on Thursday convicted a former legislator--Jordan's
first female lawmaker--of harming the government's reputation by
publishing an open letter accusing the prime minister of financial
wrongdoing.</LD>
<LD>   The court then sentenced Toujan Faisal, a fierce critic of the
government and of Muslim extremists during her 1993-97 term in
parliament, to 11/2 years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   On being convicted, Faisal, standing near the bench in her dark
blue prison uniform, shouted: "Your decision was ready beforehand.
You already had checks from [Prime Minister Ali] abu Ragheb in your
pockets."</LD>
<TE>   The verdict cannot be appealed because the charges against her are
considered "minor misdemeanors and not crimes," said the court's
presiding judge, Col. Tayel Raqad.</TE>
<TE>   Zayed al Radaydeh, who had led the defense team, said he would
find a way to appeal the verdict anyway. "The verdict is illegal,
wrong and unconstitutional," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Faisal, 53, was charged with four counts, including publishing
false and exaggerated information abroad that harmed the reputation
and damaged the dignity of the Jordanian government, contempt of
judicial authorities and public administration, and mocking the
Islamic faith by insulting a mosque preacher.</TE>
<TE>   Raqad told Faisal she was found guilty on all four counts, and
then pronounced the sentence: "The court decided by consensus to
confine you to jail for 11/2 years."</TE>
<TE>   Faisal stood alone to hear the verdict. Her eight-member defense
team had withdrawn from the case last week, saying judges' rulings
had made it impossible for them to properly do their jobs. Faisal has
argued her case on her own since.</TE>

<HD>Body Is Alleged to Be Pearl's</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON and SHAMIM-UR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>At least two members of an outlawed extremist group led Pakistani
police Thursday to what they said was the body of slain American
journalist Daniel Pearl.</LD>
<LD>   Police said early today that forensic experts were examining the
body, found in a rural area on the northwestern outskirts of this
port city, to determine whether it was that of the Wall Street
Journal reporter, who was killed last winter.</LD>
<LD>   Reports in early February that Pearl's remains had been found
turned out to be false and were painful for Pearl's family and
embarrassing to Pakistani investigators. Karachi police commanders
were being more cautious early today, releasing little information.</LD>
<TE>   Although police suspect that the remains found in the unmarked
grave are those of Pearl, Pakistani presidential spokesman Maj. Gen.
Rashid Quereshi said this morning that the identity had not been
confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   "We have heard that certain tests must be done before they can
confirm it," Quereshi said. He added that he did not know what stage
the exhumation of the remains had reached or whether the forensic
procedures, such as DNA testing, had begun.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl attended Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, and his parents
live in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest of two suspected members of the banned group
Lashkar-e-Jhangvi earlier Thursday led to the latest step in the
investigation of Pearl's abduction Jan. 23 and his subsequent
slaying, a police source said.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani authorities originally identified seven suspects in the
killing, four of whom are on trial.</TE>
<TE>   Lashkar-e-Jhangvi is the military wing of Sipah-e-Sahaba, and both
groups have been accused of waging a terrorist war against minority
Shiite Muslims in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf banned the groups in a Jan. 12 speech in which he
promised to eradicate terrorism. But his critics say the campaign is
faltering, and they accuse elements of the military's Inter-Services
Intelligence Agency of secretly undermining the anti-terrorism
effort.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl was kidnapped while investigating possible links between
Pakistan-based Islamic extremists and Richard C. Reid, a Briton
accused of trying to set off explosives in his shoes during a flight
in December from Paris to Miami.</TE>
<TE>   The recovery of Pearl's body would be a significant boost to the
prosecution of the four men on trial in a special anti-terrorism
court in the Pakistani city of Hyderabad.</TE>
<TE>   The men, who have pleaded not guilty, include Ahmed Omar Saeed
Sheikh, an admitted kidnapper and well-known Islamist who was born in
Britain to Pakistani parents.</TE>
<TE>   Without a body, the prosecution has been relying on circumstantial
evidence, such as e-mails and a three-minute videotape allegedly sent
by the kidnappers. The tape shows Pearl apparently being decapitated.
When it was shown in court this week, the defense claimed it was a
fake.</TE>
<TE>   FBI video expert John Falgon acknowledged during cross-examination
Thursday that "such videos can be prepared through computers,"
defense attorney Rai Bashir told reporters afterward.</TE>
<TE>   The trial, which is closed to the media and other members of the
public, began April 22 inside Karachi's central jail out of security
concerns. It was moved to Hyderabad when prosecutors complained of
death threats and intimidation by the defendants.</TE>
<TE>   In briefings to reporters outside the jail, the prosecution has
accused the defendants of frequent outbursts and other attempts to
disrupt the proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf has said he will not extradite Sheikh or any suspects in
Pearl's slaying to the United States because he wants justice done in
Pakistan, to send a strong message to extremists.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh, a disciple of Pakistani militant leader Maulana Masood
Azhar, was jailed in India for the 1992 kidnapping of Californian
backpacker Bela Joseph Nuss and three British tourists.</TE>
<TE>   India's government released Azhar and Sheikh from prison in
December 1999 as part of a deal to win the release of passengers on
an Indian Airlines flight hijacked to the Afghan city of Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Watson reported from Dubai and special
correspondent Rahman from Karachi.</TE>

<HD>Man Cleared in Masoud Slaying Faces Extradition</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>An Egyptian man accused of conspiring to assassinate an Afghan
Northern Alliance leader was freed Thursday after a terrorist charge
against him was dismissed--but he was immediately rearrested on an
extradition warrant from the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Yasser Serri, who lives in London, was arrested in October in
connection with the killing of Ahmed Shah Masoud, a veteran guerrilla
commander who was mortally wounded in Afghanistan by two suicide
bombers Sept. 9.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors accused Serri of using his London-based group, the
Islamic Observation Center, to give fake journalist credentials to
two men who detonated a bomb hidden in their camera while they
interviewed the opposition leader in his northern Afghanistan
headquarters.</LD>
<TE>   In an interview with an Arabic newspaper before his arrest, Serri
said he wrote the letters but thought the men were legitimate
journalists. At London's Old Bailey court, Judge Peter Beaumont said
the evidence suggested that Serri's letters had been used by the
suicide bombers. But he said the original letters had been used as a
template and then forged, "thus using the applicant as an innocent
fall guy."</TE>
<TE>   Serri was one of four people charged in New York last month with
helping an imprisoned Muslim cleric, Omar Abdel Rahman, spread
terrorist messages from the prison where he is serving a life
sentence for plotting to blow up tunnels, the FBI's Manhattan
headquarters and the United Nations. Abdel Rahman is said to be the
leader of an Al Qaeda-linked organization called the Islamic Group.</TE>
<TE>   A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said a U.S. warrant alleged that Serri
provided money for Abdel Rahman "knowing or having reasonable cause
to suspect that the money would or may be used for the purpose of
terrorism" in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   He was scheduled to appear in court today.</TE>

<HD>Angry Investors Say Goodbye to AOL Chief</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc. chief Gerald Levin ended his 10-year reign over
the world's largest media conglomerate Thursday as many shareholders
blame him for selling the prized Time Warner assets to an overvalued
Internet giant at a fire-sale price.</LD>
<LD>   Looking gaunt and distraught at the company's annual shareholder
meeting Thursday, Levin turned over his job as chief executive to
protege Richard Parsons with a plea to investors for "faith, hope
and, above all, patience."</LD>
<LD>   In a solemn four-minute address, Levin thanked his family; his
"sturdy Irish wife" of 32 years, Barbara; board members and
executives past and present; and the company's 90,000 employees.</LD>
<TE>   "It has been a stunning ride," said the slight, 63-year-old Levin.
"What will I do now? I'm not going to Disney World.... I now close my
business career and fade away."</TE>
<TE>   The applause at the company-owned Apollo Theater was restrained.
Then five isolated supporters, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson,
stood up, and after several moments a polite standing ovation took
place.</TE>
<TE>   One AOL Time Warner executive said the company had been prepared
for Levin to be booed off the stage.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sad ending," said Jessica Reif Cohen, a media analyst at
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. "But this is the worst acquisition in media
history, given the decline in market value of AOL."</TE>
<TE>   Capping a decade of deal- making, Levin was heralded as the media
industry's most visionary leader in January 2000, when he unhatched
the audacious merger of new and old media by agreeing to sell Time
Warner to America Online for stock then valued at $156 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the value of the combined company's stock has plunged
to about $84 billion as the dot-com bubble burst and AOL's Internet
growth slowed. There also has been speculation that Levin was nudged
out by AOL Time Warner Chairman Steve Case because of his
increasingly autocratic style.</TE>
<TE>   At the Apollo Theater on Thursday, many shareholders were furious.
They lined up at microphones and faulted Case and Parsons for
everything from poor high-speed Internet service and a disappointing
stock price to bad management and excesses such as a new Manhattan
headquarters under construction, which one investor referred to as a
replica of the Taj Mahal.</TE>
<TE>   'Get the Job Done,'</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders Say</TE>
<TE>   One woman, who said she has owned Time Warner stock since the
1980s, asked shareholders to vote against the entire 15-member board
of directors, seated in the front row of the concert hall.</TE>
<TE>   "Time Warner received a pig in a poke," she said. "We were conned
into this."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Hariton, 36, a private investor, delivered a blistering
tirade against AOL Time Warner's executives, demanding that they
bring down the company's $27 billion in debt.</TE>
<TE>   "Get the job done," Hariton said, his face reddening. "These are
our hard-earned dollars, and you have decimated them."</TE>
<TE>   As Parsons takes over AOL Time Warner, his task is to reverse
declining advertising sales and slower subscriber growth at its
Internet service. AOL Time Warner has cut financial forecasts twice
since September, and its shares have fallen 41% this year.</TE>
<TE>   "[Our] growing pains have been aggravated by the ad recession,"
Parsons said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Parsons vowed to restore investor confidence by revitalizing
the online service, maintaining the "integrity" of the company's
finances, simplifying the structure of the company and re-energizing
the staff.</TE>
<TE>   But his lack of details infuriated some shareholders, who charged
that they were being given, as one put it, "lip service."</TE>
<TE>   Parsons, who served as Time Warner president under Levin, called
his old boss a mentor, a teacher, a strategist and an asset builder
whose transformation of publishing company Time Inc. into the world's
most powerful media giant will be measured accurately only with the
passage of time.</TE>
<TE>   Since Levin agreed to sell Time Warner to America Online, the
value of the world's leading Internet service has plummeted about
92%, according to a Merrill Lynch report published Wednesday. By
comparison, the collective value of Time Warner assets--including
cable channels HBO, CNN and TBS; movie studio Warner Bros.; Time,
People and Sports Illustrated magazines; and Time Warner Cable--has
remained relatively stable, according to the same report.</TE>
<TE>   AOL's stock peaked at about $95.80 a share a month before the
merger was announced. Shares of AOL Time Warner closed Thursday at
$18.90, up 5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Levin struck the AOL Time Warner deal at the height of the dot-com
mania, when the Internet was seen as the next great pipeline into the
home for delivering news, information and entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Orchestrating</TE>
<TE>   Acquisitions</TE>
<TE>   Levin also had been at the forefront of nearly every advance in
television technology since the 1970s. Levin, shortly after joining
Time Inc. in 1972, persuaded his bosses to transmit HBO cable
programs by satellite instead of by videotape, which led to an
explosion of the number of possible cable channels. It was also Levin
who, after orchestrating the marriage of Time Inc. and Warner
Communications in 1992, looked to leverage the company's publishing
and movie businesses by pushing more aggressively into the cable
business.</TE>
<TE>   Levin later bought Turner Broadcasting System, giving his company
a wide array of cable channels to feed through his pipes.</TE>
<TE>   The next step was to use cable's speedy pipes for connecting to
the Internet and for receiving phone calls. There, Time Warner faced
two rivals with head starts: AT&amp;T and America Online.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors in the fall of 1999 that AT&amp;T was talking to America Online
about a potential merger put Levin on the defensive, sources said.
Levin also was worried about a hostile takeover of Time Warner by
AOL.</TE>
<TE>   "Jerry thought that two outcomes were unbearable: a hostile
takeover and an AOL-AT&amp;T merger," said one media executive involved
in the situation.</TE>
<TE>   Few media pundits questioned the wisdom of the AOL-Time Warner
deal when it was announced.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the companies merged in January 2001, however, the
dot-com boom was waning. Soon AOL's Internet service, which Levin had
promised would be the growth engine of the new company, began to
sputter. Yet as other media companies revised their sales
projections, Levin stuck with his aggressive forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the events of Sept. 11, which had a devastating effect
on Levin, whose son Jonathan had been murdered in 1997. Company
executives said the terrorist attacks served as a horrifying reminder
for Levin of his personal tragedy. In Levin's farewell address
Thursday, he referred to the "unfathomable emptiness of a violent
death" and his empathy for the victims.</TE>
<TE>   Levin maintains that the decision to retire early was his alone.</TE>
<TE>   But sources said the AOL Time Warner board was worried about
Levin's "unrealistic financial expectations," and they said Case had
become concerned that Levin was making decisions without consulting
him.</TE>
<TE>   At a board meeting at America Online headquarters in November,
director Ted Turner made an impassioned speech calling for a
management change, said a source close to him. Turner, one of the
largest individual shareholders of AOL Time Warner, was upset when
Levin announced management responsibilities for the merged company
and cut Turner's operating role.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Turner also had become angry as his portfolio of AOL
Time Warner shares dropped in value and had asked his financial
advisors to present to Case details about the company's
underperformance.</TE>
<TE>   One source said that after the November board meeting, individual
board members approached Levin about the possibility of his stepping
down voluntarily.</TE>
<TE>   Case also was angered by an expensive--though losing--bid by Levin
in early December for AOL Time Warner to buy AT&amp;T's cable business,
sources said. While Levin was eager to make his company the biggest
cable operator, Case opposed the move.</TE>
<TE>   Within a week, Levin announced early retirement, saying he was
looking to put "the poetry" back into his life.</TE>
<TE>   Times wire services were used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>D.A. Demands Mahony Turn Over Documents on Abuse</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Head of the Los Angeles Archdiocese is told to
comply or face grand jury action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE and RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley on Thursday threatened
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony with a grand jury investigation unless the
archdiocese surrenders all documents related to the alleged sexual
abuse of children.</LD>
<LD>   Cooley told Mahony it was no longer acceptable to provide only
verbal information to law enforcement agencies, as he said the Los
Angeles Archdiocese has done until now. Without access to the
archdiocese's full written documentation on allegations, Cooley said,
Los Angeles police and sheriff's deputies are hampered in their
investigations.</LD>
<LD>   More than 30 priests are under investigation for alleged sexual
abuse of minors.</LD>
<TE>   Cooley's warning was the toughest yet from law enforcement after
nearly three months of guarded responses by the archdiocese. The
church has been asked by prosecutors and the news media for
information about priests whose conduct with children may have
warranted criminal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney acted Thursday in response to The Times'
disclosure that Mahony had knowingly transferred an abusive Los
Angeles priest from parish to parish, secretly settled a lawsuit
against him and then arranged for him to quietly retire two years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing short of a full accounting with written documentation is
acceptable," Cooley said in a letter to Mahony. "If it is not
forthcoming, the grand jury will be utilized to obtain it."</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese said in a statement that it has been cooperating
with all law enforcement agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "We look forward to resolving any misunderstanding that may exist
between us, and to continuing our cordial and productive
relationship," the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosure of Mahony's conduct in the case of Father Michael
Stephen Baker provoked outrage and disappointment among some laity on
Thursday. Mahony, anticipating The Times' story, faxed a letter of
apology Tuesday to the archdiocese's 1,200 priests.</TE>
<TE>   "If he knowingly sent an abusive priest back into ministry with
children, that's presumptive evidence that he is incompetent as a
bishop and should resign," said David Quackenbush, a professor at
Thomas Aquinas College, a Catholic liberal arts college in Santa
Paula. "If a priest killed a 10-year-old, he wouldn't be ministering
to children again. [Sex abuse] is attempted spiritual murder."</TE>
<TE>   John Connolly, a theologian at Loyola Marymount University in Los
Angeles, said the cardinal's actions in the Baker case "surprised and
disappointed" him because he had thought Mahony had been aggressively
dealing with sexual abuse allegations in the church. He also said
Mahony should have apologized not only to "my brother priests," as
the cardinal's letter was addressed, but to the laity as well.</TE>
<TE>   "All of this is a reflection of the fact that [church officials]
are still caught in this hiding thing," Connolly said. "We still have
a long way to go in dealing with this openly."</TE>
<TE>   But Connolly, a liberal theologian, said he would oppose calls for
Mahony's resignation because he is one of the few moderate cardinals
left in the American church. The Roman Catholic Church's response to
the molestation scandal is expected to be tested in June, when the
nation's bishops meet in Dallas to fashion new guidelines to dismiss
abusive priests. If Mahony were to resign, Connolly said, the
conservative Pope John Paul II would almost certainly appoint someone
"more reactionary."</TE>
<TE>   Several priests, however, said they were gratified that Mahony had
accepted responsibility for his actions in the Baker case and openly
apologized. Some also said the cardinal's actions should be
understood in the context of the times.</TE>
<TE>   When Baker confessed his deeds in 1986, said Father Bob Curtis, a
semi-retired Los Angeles priest, most dioceses believed that church
problems should be handled quietly "within the family" to avoid
shocking the faithful, who expected their priests to be icons of
perfection. Most also believed that sexual abuse could be treated
through counseling, Curtis and others said--a perception that has
been challenged by revelations across the nation that priests treated
for abuse had continued to molest other children.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say the archbishop was operating under the best
information at the time," said Father Vicente Lopez of St. Raphael
Church in Los Angeles. "Now, with painful hindsight, we recognize
[Baker's treatment] was inappropriate."</TE>
<TE>   But victims' groups rejected the argument that Mahony didn't know
any better at the time, because he had kept silent about Baker's
conduct until this week.</TE>
<TE>   "The old excuse, 'Back then we just didn't know any better,' won't
wash in this instance," said David Clohessy of St. Louis, national
director of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests.</TE>
<TE>   Clohessy said Mahony had engaged in "precisely the same type of
denial and cover-up" as Boston's Cardinal Bernard Law, whose lenient
treatment of priests accused of molestation sparked the current
church scandal earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley said his office had decided last week to demand greater
cooperation from the archdiocese, but he said it was the story in
Thursday's Times that prompted him to send the letter. The article
reported that Baker told Mahony in 1986 that he had molested young
boys, but that the cardinal reassigned him to parishes, where Baker
allegedly continued his sexual abuse of minors for more than a
decade.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Mahony approved a $1.3-million payment to two men who
said they had been abused by Baker from 1984 to 1999. The cardinal
arranged for the priest to quietly retire from the archdiocese the
same year that settlement was approved.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Mahony and the archdiocese were sued under a federal
racketeering law, alleging that Mahony protected abusive priests as
head of the archdiocese, a pattern of behavior the suit says
constitutes a criminal enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   As sex abuse scandals have swept the Roman Catholic Church
nationwide, prosecutors in Suffolk County, N.Y., and Cincinnati have
impaneled grand juries. Others have made similar demands for church
documents. Victims' rights groups and attorneys representing alleged
victims say that each diocese maintains a considerable file on each
priest on its rolls.</TE>
<TE>   In a March e-mail to one of his lawyers, Mahony expressed concern
about being called in front of a grand jury after a church attorney
balked at turning over to police the names of three priests.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't, today, 'consult' with the [LAPD] about those 3
names, I can guarantee you that I will get hauled into a Grand Jury
proceeding and I will be forced to give all the names, etc.," the
cardinal wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley said he already has sent Mahony a series of letters urging
him to provide information on reports of child molestation to police.
He said Mahony replied that such information had been provided.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the LAPD and other law enforcement agencies have said
publicly that the archdiocese has been cooperating with investigators
and has provided detectives with the names of priests recently
removed from the ministry. The archdiocese has also provided
information from its hotline on sexual abuse to the LAPD's Sexual
Exploited Child Unit.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Cmdr. Gary Brennan said investigators have
received some written documentation from the archdiocese about
ongoing investigations.</TE>
<TE>   "It is anticipated we will receive more documents. We have an
ongoing working relationship. Whether we have received everything
we're suppose to remains to be seen," Brennan said.</TE>
<TE>   But some law enforcement sources say the information supplied by
the archdiocese has been limited. "They make the tobacco boys look
like choirboys," said one officer, who compared the archdiocese's
reluctance to hand over files to that of tobacco company executives
accused of covering up the dangers of smoking cigarettes.</TE>

<HD>Attorney Denies Being at Meeting With Priest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An attorney for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles on Thursday denied a
claim that he attended a 1986 meeting at which a priest told Cardinal
Roger M. Mahony that he had sexually abused minors.</LD>
<LD>   The attorney, John P. McNicholas, said in a letter faxed to The
Times that he has never met the former priest, Michael Stephen Baker,
and never been in the same room with him.</LD>
<LD>   The Times quoted Baker in an article Thursday saying that he
attended a meeting in December 1986 with Mahony, his vicar for clergy
and McNicholas. In a series of interviews, Baker described the
meeting, including comments by McNicholas.</LD>
<TE>   McNicholas did not return calls to his office before the story was
published, nor on Thursday. A spokesman for the archdiocese, while
not challenging Baker's account of what happened at the meeting, said
Thursday that McNicholas was not present.</TE>

<HD>Ruling Upholds Firing on Basis of Religion</HD>
<DH>Law: Catholic medical clinic can dismiss an evangelical
Christian proselytizer, court finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Religious institutions cannot be held liable for discriminating
against employees on the basis of religion, the California Supreme
Court ruled unanimously Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The state high court threw out a lawsuit by an evangelical
Christian who was fired from a Catholic medical foundation after he
proselytized to other employees.</LD>
<LD>   The court held that the U.S. and California constitutions protect
thousands of religious employers--including religious publishing
houses, television and radio stations and churches and schools--from
litigation, said Jeffrey A. Berman, who represented several churches
and religious groups in the case.</LD>
<TE>   File clerk Terence Silo had "been counseled three times previously
... regarding Soul Saving on clinic premises," the Catholic nonprofit
employer wrote in Silo's termination papers.</TE>
<TE>   A Superior Court jury awarded Silo damages and attorney fees, and
a state Court of Appeal upheld the awards on the grounds that the
state Constitution bars religious discrimination in the workplace.
But the Supreme Court said Thursday that religious organizations have
the right under the 1st Amendment to "define themselves and their
religious message" and may fire workers for "objectionable religious
speech."</TE>
<TE>   Secular employers can still be held liable for religious
discrimination, but religions need "considerable discretion to choose
employees who will not interfere with their religious mission,"
Justice Carlos R. Moreno wrote for the court.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers in the case said the decision and other rulings permit
religious organizations to make hiring and firing decisions solely on
the basis of one's creed.</TE>
<TE>   "The impact of this is great for religious institutions," Berman
said. "It indicates that the California Supreme Court is sensitive to
the issue of religious autonomy and to both the state and federal
constitutional rights of religions to regulate themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's ruling stemmed from a lawsuit Silo filed against the
Catholic Healthcare West Medical Foundation. The organization hired
Silo in July 1991 to work in its medical records department in
Sacramento. More than a year later, Silo experienced a religious
conversion.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave my life to Christ," he testified at trial. "My heart was
filled with the Holy Spirit, and my life was changed."</TE>
<TE>   In January 1993, after already having received a poor performance
evaluation, Silo met with the managers at the clinic. A fellow
employee had complained that Silo told her not "to use the name of
God in vain," and a patient objected that Silo had been "preaching"
to him.</TE>
<TE>   The managers admonished Silo. He was not to use the word "God ...
unless it's off the clock"--not during work time, the court recounted
in Silo vs. CHW Medical Foundation. Silo was placed on probation the
following month and warned that he would lose his job unless he got
more work done.</TE>
<TE>   When he was fired that April, the termination papers cited three
incidents in which Silo had continued to "preach" and "Soul Save"
despite warnings. Three of his co-workers had complained of
harassment.</TE>
<TE>   Silo denied he had harassed anyone and insisted that his religious
discussions had occurred during his lunch hour.</TE>
<TE>   Catholic Healthcare West, which runs 42 hospitals in California,
Nevada and Arizona, denied that it had discriminated against Silo on
the basis of religion. The organization said it has a policy against
religious discrimination and fired Silo because of his work
performance.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday was the second time the case was before the high court.</TE>
<TE>   A Sacramento jury had found that Catholic Healthcare West had
shown religious prejudice and awarded Silo $6,305 in economic damages
and $1 for emotional distress. His lawyer was awarded $155,245 in
attorney fees.</TE>
<TE>   The 3rd District Court of Appeal initially ruled for Silo on the
grounds that the foundation could be held liable under the state Fair
Employment and Housing Act.</TE>
<TE>   The California Supreme Court asked the Court of Appeal to
reconsider that decision in light of precedents that have held
religious organizations exempt from the anti-discrimination law.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court then decided that Silo could prevail because the
California Constitution bars religious discrimination in the
workplace. Under the state Constitution, employers must try to
accommodate an employee's religious practices.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature in 1999 and 2000 passed amendments to the state's
fair employment law that will allow some religious discrimination
lawsuits against religiously affiliated hospitals. The court did not
rule on the constitutionality of those amendments Thursday because
the case was filed before their passage.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen W. Parrish, who represented Catholic Healthcare West, said
the decision indicates that the court, even with the more recent
amendments to the fair employment law, views religious discrimination
cases differently from other kinds of discrimination claims.</TE>
<TE>   The court noted, in fact, that it might rule another way if a
religious employer were sued for sex discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   "It is evident that restricting a religious employer's ability to
control religious speech in the workplace raises different
constitutional issues than does a prohibition of sexual
discrimination," Moreno wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Parrish said religious discrimination lawsuits are extremely
complex. "You almost need to seek legal advice before do anything
because these are such sensitive issues," Parrish said.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Drapkin, who represented a religious freedom organization
in the case, said the decision shows that the court realizes that the
"breadth of a religious organization's mission is not limited to
houses of worship."</TE>
<TE>   Catholic Healthcare West does not limit its services to Roman
Catholics, does not have a chaplaincy or chapel and does not sponsor
or conduct religious services or Bible studies on its premises or
display religious symbols.</TE>
<TE>   But the organization is exempt from state taxation as an entity
operated by the Roman Catholic Church in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony J. Poidmore, who represented Silo, said he advocates
religious freedom in many of his legal cases and believes the court
properly gave "more clear protection to what I term legitimately
religious employers."</TE>
<TE>   Poidmore said he objected to the fact that the medical foundation
was protected by its religious affiliation because, he said, it is
really a secular institution.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have an organization that is essentially secular, the
protections that are afforded to other employees should be afforded
to these types of employees," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Silo, now an evangelical Christian pastor, admitted that he was
"on fire" and perhaps too exuberant about "sharing the good news"
when he was first born again, Poidmore said.</TE>
<TE>   But Silo toned down his discussions about the Gospel after
receiving warnings, the lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   William J. Hunt, president and chief executive of Catholic
Healthcare West, said he was pleased that the court has recognized
the rights of religious institutions.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an obligation to look out for the interest of all of our
employees and patients," Hunt said. "This ruling reinforces our
ability to do that in accordance with our own beliefs."</TE>

<HD>Wildfire Halted at City's Edge</HD>
<DH>Drought: The 1,000-acre blaze has destroyed five upscale
homes near Prescott, Ariz. Firefighters have it nearly
half-contained.</DH>

<DL>PRESCOTT, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>A tempestuous fire feeding on dry ponderosa pines was pushed back
just outside the city's edge Thursday night after destroying five
upscale homes, yet another signal that the Western drought has
created precarious conditions for homeowners and firefighters.</LD>
<LD>   "Heavy fuels are quite terribly dry, and all you need is an
ignition source," said Mary Zabinski, a fire information officer for
the Southwest Interagency Coordination Center in Albuquerque.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of the 1,000-acre fire here is unknown, but
investigators have ruled out natural sources.</LD>
<TE>   So far this year, 1,881 fires have burned more than 190,000 acres
across the West, where a dozen fires are burning. Arizona, which is
battling two other fires, is experiencing its most severe drought in
105 years. Arizona's governor, Jane Dee Hull, like many of her
Western counterparts, weeks ago declared a drought emergency and is
seeking federal funds to aid farmers and ranchers.</TE>
<TE>   The fire threatened more than 2,000 homes here that stand among
towering, tinder-dry pine trees that officials worried would be
easily ignited by blowing embers. By Thursday night, the blaze was
45% contained and 1,150 firefighters were positioned to battle it
today.</TE>
<TE>   Zabinski and others said the fire danger was exacerbated by former
urban dwellers or absentee owners who build near a forest and don't
understand the importance of clearing brush and other vegetation from
around their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Cook, the local county fire marshal, agreed. "The common
thread among the homes that burned was that they didn't have
defensible space around them. People move into the urban interface
into the pine trees and don't want to cut down trees. We have to
educate them on that--and to not use combustible building materials."</TE>
<TE>   For years, city and county officials have discussed changing
building codes to require that homes in wooded neighborhoods be
constructed of materials that are more fire-resistant. This fire,
they said, brings a new sense of urgency to their plans.</TE>
<TE>   New building codes won't affect houses already constructed in this
popular, mile-high community 96 miles north of Phoenix, but would
address new construction in a county that has seen its population
explode by about 60% in 10 years. During the same period, Prescott
grew to about 34,000 from 26,500.</TE>
<TE>   Prescott is especially popular among onetime city folk who either
moved directly here or to cities such as Phoenix and, unwilling to
bear oppressively hot summers, have sought the refuge of Prescott's
more moderate climate.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Arizona's best-preserved town, they find more than 500
buildings on the National Registry of Historic Buildings, sharing a
quaint downtown of restaurants, taverns, boutiques, antique stores,
art galleries and Victorian homes.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Prescott is in mostly treeless flatlands, but its
southwestern corner--which was in the fire's path and is nestled
beneath 100-foot-high pine trees--which has become an increasingly
attractive home site.</TE>
<TE>   The custom homes that burned Wednesday were in the hilly,
contemporary Cathedral Pines subdivision, and are valued at between
$350,000 and $750,000 or more. Some burned so cleanly to their
foundations, fire investigators were hard-pressed to describe their
type of construction. Other homes, which had 30 feet or more of
vegetation clearance, escaped damage.</TE>
<TE>   The fire started in a campground Wednesday afternoon and swept
through four miles of forest in a matter of hours, forcing the
evacuation of more than 1,500 people in its path. It was stopped
three miles from downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Hand crews worked feverishly to clear brush around its perimeter.
Thursday evening, feared winds had failed to materialize, and fire
bosses said they had gained the upper hand.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Humbert, who spent 30 years as a fire management officer for
the U.S. Forest Service in Southern California and here before
becoming a local real estate agent, has watched Prescott's growth
push housing construction into the forest.</TE>
<TE>   "The lands adjacent to the national forest are highly
desirable--they've got a big backyard with great views," he said
Thursday. "But it's a high-risk area, and this is the fire that I've
been concerned would occur."</TE>
<TE>   Many are loath to remove the towering trees that shade their
homes--and say this fire won't cause them to reconsider.</TE>
<TE>   "We know the danger--but we know the beauty too," said Mary Lee
Aguilar, 81, who moved here 12 years ago from Whittier with her
husband, Joseph.</TE>
<TE>   As the fire marched toward their subdivision, Timber Woods, they
evacuated with their neighbors and spent Wednesday night on a cot at
the high school, along with scores of others after every available
motel room in town was quickly booked by locals.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, they moved into a vacated motel room, eager to return
home in a few days.</TE>
<TE>   "We had cleared out the pine needles and pine cones and the
brush," she said, "but we've got tall, beautiful pine trees 6 feet
from our wall, and I can't give them up. If I did, I might as well
move back to Whittier."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Julie Cart in Denver contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>Defendant Told of Church Blast, Ex-Wife Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BIRMINGHAM, Ala.</DL>
<LD>A former wife of an ex-Klansman testified at his murder trial
Thursday that he claimed to have placed the explosive device and
lighted the fuse in the 1963 church bombing that killed four black
girls.</LD>
<LD>   "He said he got out of the car and put the bomb under the stairs
the night before," said Willadean Brogdon, who was married to Bobby
Frank Cherry in the early 1970s.</LD>
<LD>   The 71-year-old Cherry is accused of joining other Ku Klux
Klansmen in planting the bomb at the 16th Street Baptist Church, a
rallying point for protests against segregation.</LD>
<TE>   Brogdon, who was married to Cherry from August 1970 to April 1973,
said he called her once when his car broke down near the church.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to get him and he said that was the church where he put
the bomb under the stairs," she said. "He said he lit the fuse."</TE>
<TE>   Under cross-examination, defense lawyer Mickey Johnson questioned
her description of the church. Brogdon testified that Cherry told her
the stairs where he placed the device looked different when rebuilt
after the bombing, but Johnson pointed out that there are no stairs
now on that side of the building.</TE>
<TE>   The bomb exploded about 10:20 a.m. on a Sunday. Whether Cherry
placed the bomb on a Saturday and might have returned later to light
the fuse was not explained.</TE>
<TE>   Other witnesses Thursday testified that Cherry claimed
responsibility for the blast, but with key differences.</TE>
<TE>   Brogdon's brother, Wayne Brogdon, said Cherry never mentioned
planting the bomb or lighting the fuse. "He told me he made the bomb
but it wasn't supposed to hurt anybody," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But George Ferris, Willadean Brogdon's nephew, quoted Cherry as
saying the church "was supposed to be full."</TE>
<TE>   The bombing on Sept. 15, 1963, was the deadliest act of violence
against the civil rights movement. Killed were Denise McNair, 11; and
Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson and Cynthia Wesley, who were 14.</TE>
<TE>   Klan member Thomas Blanton was convicted of murder and sentenced
to life imprisonment last year for his role in the church bombing.</TE>
<TE>   A third Klansman, Robert Chambliss, was convicted of murder in
1977 and died in prison. A fourth suspect, Herman Cash, died in 1994
without being charged.</TE>

<LD>   The grueling cleanup and search for remains at the World Trade
Center site will end with a solemn ceremony on May 30, Mayor Michael
R. Bloomberg said.</LD>
<TE>   The last heap of Sept. 11 debris is expected to be hauled away by
then. The job will have been completed three months faster than city
officials had predicted--in part because of the mild winter--at a
cost of about $750 million, or one-tenth the initial estimate.</TE>

<HD>Crack Appears in Bush Armor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Suddenly, President Bush is confronting questions that
bedeviled one of his predecessors: What did the president know and
when did he know it?</LD>
<LD>   The questions were prompted by the disclosure that Bush was
briefed in August about a heightened risk that Osama bin Laden's Al
Qaeda network may have been developing plans to hijack airplanes.
That, in turn, sparked speculation Thursday that the strong popular
support he gained for his response to the Sept. 11 attacks could now
be jeopardized.</LD>
<LD>   In public, administration officials emphasized that the briefing
Bush received Aug. 6 at his ranch was neither specific nor unusual,
given long-standing concerns about hijackings. Any effort to paint
the president as ignoring public safety would quickly be seen as
partisan, they said.</LD>
<TE>   However, the officials and their allies acknowledged privately
that they were well aware of the potential political damage, and they
scurried to control it.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like somebody was asleep at the switch; this is a
fundamental matter for the Bush presidency," said one Republican with
ties to the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Political analysts agreed, noting that what could be at risk is a
strong suit of the Bush presidency: a reputation for efficiency,
competency and responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first bit of information since the attacks that
doesn't necessarily put Bush in a great light and calls into question
how good a job [his administration] has done," said pollster Andrew
Kohut, who directs the Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the
Press. "It could, potentially, diminish some of the luster."</TE>
<TE>   The president's public opinion ratings reached remarkable heights
in the weeks after the attacks. Ten days after Sept. 11, 90% of those
surveyed in a Gallup poll approved of the way he was doing his job.</TE>
<TE>   That rating has dipped to 75% or so in most recent surveys--a
figure that still would comfort any president. But this deep
reservoir of public support for Bush could be undermined if questions
linger about whether his administration should have done more to
guard against hijackings.</TE>
<TE>   If it persists, "the idea that this White House might not have
done everything that could have been done ... will be extremely
troubling to the public," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster.</TE>
<TE>   "People will be open to a reasonable explanation, but the burden
is now on the president to offer a reasonable explanation as to why
he and the administration didn't do more," Garin said.</TE>
<TE>   In the short term, Garin said the White House also needs to
explain why news of the August briefing "took so long to get out."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Mann, a scholar at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution
think tank, noted that concerns about how well the government
fulfilled its responsibility to protect the nation had focused on the
FBI and CIA.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it gets to the White House.... It naturally raises
questions," Mann said.</TE>
<TE>   The questions about what Bush had been told, what he did with that
information and when the information reached him buzzed about
Washington on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The queries have a historical context.</TE>
<TE>   "What did the president know and when did he know it" became the
mantra of investigators looking into President Nixon's role in the
Watergate scandal. They were first posed publicly by Sen. Howard H.
Baker Jr., a Tennessee Republican who is now Bush's ambassador to
Japan.</TE>

<LD>In a rare display of high-level dissension, a top Army official took
issue Thursday with Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's decision
to cancel the $11-billion Crusader artillery program.</LD>
<LD>   Appearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Army Chief
of Staff Gen. Eric K. Shinseki said the abrupt program termination
would expose U.S. ground troops to more risk while a new generation
of weaponry is being developed.</LD>
<LD>   "That window of risk is extended now until we find a replacement
system," Shinseki testified.</LD>
<TE>   Shinseki's statement appeared to contradict assurances made to the
panel earlier in the day by Rumsfeld, and could add fuel to efforts
in Congress to keep the Crusader program alive.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld told committee members that his decision to kill the
program would provide greater protection to U.S. infantry by
accelerating development of more-advanced, so-called smart weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "Skipping Crusader to emphasize precision munitions and rocket
systems does not put U.S. forces at risk, as some have suggested,"
Rumsfeld said. "Rather, it will reduce future risk and speed the
introduction" of the other systems.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld testified that he respected the opinions of those who
want to continue the Crusader program. But he said he and President
Bush had come to a different conclusion after evaluating the future
needs of the entire U.S. military, not just the Army.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld faces stiff opposition within Congress for deciding to
call off acquisition of 480 mobile artillery cannons after the
government has spent $2 billion on the initial development of the
Crusader weapons. Lawmakers representing districts where the Crusader
would be built are attempting to overrule his action.</TE>
<TE>   The Defense secretary acknowledged that the Crusader, a
155-millimeter, self-propelled howitzer, would provide better ground
troop support than the Paladin cannons it would replace. "It's a good
piece of equipment," Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the additional $9 billion earmarked for the Crusader
could be put to even better use by developing precision-guided
munitions and rocket systems more suited to the battlefields of
tomorrow than "dumb" artillery cannons.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said he had reached his conclusion after lengthy
deliberations, and that Bush fully concurred.</TE>
<TE>   "The president ... is solidly behind this decision; there is no
ambiguity," Rumsfeld said. "It's no fun for him to cancel a program
that some people want. It's no fun for me ... [but] it's an
obligation we've got."</TE>
<TE>   Some committee members remained unconvinced. Sen. James M. Inhofe
(R-Okla.), who is expected to offer an amendment on the Senate floor
to overrule Rumsfeld's decision, questioned whether Bush was fully
informed about the Crusader's merits.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wonder if the president has had the briefings necessary"
to reach a conclusion, Inhofe said. "He's had a lot of things on his
mind."</TE>
<TE>   Several lawmakers were sharply critical of Rumsfeld's decision to
call off the program after previously endorsing a budget request for
$475 million in Crusader funding for the fiscal year that begins Oct.
1.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the House approved a defense funding measure containing
the $475 million, along with a nonbinding provision urging the
Pentagon to keep the program alive. The Senate has not yet voted on
the defense bill.</TE>
<TE>   Besides its inability to provide precise targeting, the Crusader
is extremely difficult to deploy, Rumsfeld said. Each mobile cannon
weighs about 40 tons, and must be accompanied by a resupply vehicle
weighing 34 tons.</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers Urge Plan to Control Wildlife Disease</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Agriculture Department and other federal
agencies have until the end of the month to draft a plan to help
states control a contagious, brain-wasting disease in deer and elk,
House lawmakers said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The deadly ailment, known as chronic wasting disease, has spread
to eight Western and Midwestern states. Scientists do not know if it
can infect humans who eat meat from diseased animals, but the World
Health Organization has advised against eating venison or any part of
an animal showing signs of the disease.</LD>
<LD>   Wisconsin officials announced two weeks ago that the state would
kill 15,000 white-tailed deer to stop the spread of the disease.</LD>
<TE>   Rep. Scott McInnis (R-Colo.), chairman of a House resources
subcommittee, urged the USDA and other federal agencies to quickly
put together a plan to help states control chronic wasting disease.</TE>
<TE>   If federal officials do not have a proposal ready by the end of
May, Congress will step in, McInnis told a subcommittee hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The ailment is part of a family of diseases that includes scrapie
and bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly called "mad cow"
disease. It slowly destroys the brain and nervous system of infected
deer and elk.</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin Gov. Scott McCallum urged the House panel to fund
research into whether chronic wasting disease can be transmitted to
humans, other wildlife or farm livestock. Since the first diseased
animal was found Feb. 28 in Wisconsin, the state has spent about
$600,000, he said.</TE>

<HD>NYC's Egan Amends Policy on Reporting Suspect Priests</HD>
<DH>Church: The cardinal had said clergy thought to be sex
offenders would face in-house inquiries. Now, their names will go to
area district attorneys.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The New York Archdiocese, under increasing pressure to cooperate with
law enforcement, now will automatically forward the names of all
priests suspected of sexual misconduct to local district attorneys.</LD>
<LD>   The plan, similar to a decision recently announced by the Brooklyn
Archdiocese, was developed after New York church officials initiated
discussions with local district attorneys, spokesman Joseph Zwilling
said in a statement this week.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, Cardinal Edward M. Egan announced that New York
priests suspected of sexual abuse would be subject to investigation
by a committee of church and lay officials. If the accusations were
found to have merit, he said, the name of the suspected cleric would
be sent to law enforcement officials.</LD>
<TE>   But that policy came under heavy attack from a host of church
critics, who said that Egan and other officials seemed more
interested in protecting priests and shielding the archdiocese from a
wave of lawsuits than they were in helping victims. Although Egan
insisted he would ''actively cooperate'' with district attorneys,
criticism mounted that the New York Archdiocese--the nation's third
largest, with more than 2.4 million parishioners--was lagging behind
the more aggressive policies concerning sexual abuse adopted by Roman
Catholic Church officials across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Egan also had been criticized for protecting priests suspected of
sexual abuse when he was archbishop of Bridgeport, Conn., during the
1990s. Recently revealed court transcripts in several cases of
alleged sexual abuse showed that he strongly defended church
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Egan, however, since has said that he was simply trying to ensure
that the legal process treated both sides fairly. Court records also
indicate that he transferred priests suspected of abuse to other
positions within the church, typically after they had been referred
for counseling or other treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the current controversy, grand jury investigations of alleged
church misconduct have begun in New York's Nassau and Westchester
counties. Some observers say these probes--along with pressures that
Egan may have received during a recent trip to the Vatican with other
U.S. cardinals to discuss the scandal--convinced him to drop his
long-standing objection to automatically sending the names to local
law enforcement officials of priests suspected of sexual abuses.</TE>
<TE>   ''Everyone who believes they know of something of this sort should
go directly to the authorities,'' Egan said last week before the
policy was formally unveiled. ''And any archdiocesan official who has
a suspicion of such a horror will do the same.''</TE>
<TE>   District attorneys representing the boroughs of Manhattan, the
Bronx and Queens--along with those in seven suburban counties that
are part of the diocese--expressed satisfaction that Egan's latest
plan was a sign of more direct cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   Zwilling, the church spokesman, said the archdiocese was prompted
to make the move by the recommendations of a special advisory
committee that was formed to investigate the sexual abuse issue. The
panel ''included psychiatrists, attorneys, a former district attorney
and a sitting judge,'' Zwilling said. ''They reviewed our policy and
said this is the direction we should be moving in.''</TE>
<TE>   But others question whether the policy will produce better
results.</TE>
<TE>   ''People like myself are still going to be skeptical,'' said
National Catholic League President William Donohue. ''I'll be
interested to see what happens the next time there's a miscreant
priest. What are they going to do about him? It takes courage to say,
'You no longer belong here. You've lost your vocation. It's time for
you to get out.'''</TE>

<HD>Critics Decry Decision on Forest</HD>
<DH>Environment: The Bush administration recommends against
protecting any more of Alaska's Tongass National Forest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has recommended against expanding the number
of federally protected acres in Alaska's Tongass National Forest,
where vast areas are already protected from logging, road building
and other development.</LD>
<LD>   In a proposal released Thursday, the administration recommended
that Congress not add to the 6.6 million acres that lawmakers have
already given special status in the world's largest intact temperate
rain forest.</LD>
<LD>   Officials from the U.S. Forest Service had evaluated expanding the
protected area by as much as 9 million acres, in response to a
federal court order.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, however, the administration recommended that
Congress designate as wilderness 1.4 million acres of Alaska's
Chugach National Forest, near Anchorage.</TE>
<TE>   The Tongass--a puzzle of islands and stretch of mainland that make
up most of Alaska's panhandle--is a recreational area for anglers,
whose only access to some of the world's best salmon and trout
fishing is by seaplane.</TE>
<TE>   The fate of its vast old-growth forests--home to grizzly bears,
wolves and other wildlife--has attracted the attention of
environmentalists around the world because half of the world's
temperate rain forests already have been logged.</TE>
<TE>   Forty percent of the world's remaining temperate rain
forests--ecosystems that draw their sustenance from the constant
cycling of water between land and sea--are in Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   "Future generations will ask how, in 9.4 million acres of the
world's last intact temperate rain forest, the Bush administration
didn't see one acre worth preserving as wilderness," said Deidre
McDonnell, an attorney with Earthjustice.</TE>
<TE>   The national environmental group, arguing on behalf of several
environmental groups, won the case against the government that
resulted in the judge's order.</TE>
<TE>   But Alaska's flagging timber industry also prizes the Tongass'
thick forests of hemlock and spruce, and the health of the industry
relies on its ability to continue logging there.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they made the right decision," said Owen Graham,
executive director of the Alaska Forest Assn. "There's already such a
vast amount of the Tongass set aside."</TE>
<TE>   The fate of the Tongass forest has emerged as the biggest test of
the Bush administration's pledge to uphold "roadless values." And
environmentalists said the proposal not to designate any additional
wilderness in the Tongass is the strongest signal yet that the Bush
administration is not committed to keeping backwoods areas wild.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Francis, a forest specialist for the Wilderness Society,
said the White House's position that it supports roadless policy is
nothing but a "ruse."</TE>
<TE>   "They have no intention of protecting wild forests for future
generations," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton administration planned to protect these forests as
part of its sweeping plan to ban new road building and commercial
logging in 58.5 million acres of national forests across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman, who runs the Forest Service,
pledged soon after assuming office to uphold "roadless values," while
announcing plans to alter aspects of the Clinton regulations.</TE>
<TE>   But the administration has been quietly moving away from that by
forging ahead with timber sales in roadless areas, including 33 in
the Tongass.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge blocked implementation of that plan in May 2001,
saying that the Clinton administration had violated the National
Environmental Policy Act in enacting the rule. An appeal is pending.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the administration is crafting its own version of
a roadless plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Being committed to roadless values does not necessarily mean we
decide to retain every acre in its current condition," said Mark Rey,
the undersecretary of the Agriculture Department with responsibility
for the Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   "It means being committed to the ecological and environmental
benefits of keeping these areas largely undeveloped."</TE>
<TE>   Rey said the Tongass wilderness proposal does not signal the
administration's plan for the 9 million acres of roadless area in the
forest.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's roadless policy and its final management
plan, both expected later this year, will spell out the fate of those
acres, Rey said.</TE>
<TE>   Rey said the bigger announcement was the recommendation to set
aside almost a quarter of Chugach National Forest as a wilderness
area, which would prohibit most development.</TE>
<TE>   "These acres are a world-class scenic and ecological treasure that
deserve wilderness protection," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Wilderness Act of 1964, Congress defined wilderness as "an
area where the Earth and its community of life are untrammeled by
man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Congress has set aside more than 100 million acres of
land as wilderness, allowing it to retain its "primeval character."</TE>

<HD>Getting a Peek at Power Behind Gamma Bursts</HD>
<DH>Space: With help from the Hubble telescope, scientists
learn that exploding stars cause the brilliant flashes of light.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since their accidental discovery by Cold War satellites monitoring
for nuclear tests in space 35 years ago, gamma ray bursts have been
among the most mysterious and extreme phenomena in the universe. No
one has been able to say just what monstrous objects trigger the
spectacular spasms of light, which burn for just seconds but with the
brilliance of 10 billion suns.</LD>
<LD>   The theories--some serious, others offbeat--have been nearly as
numerous as gamma ray burst sightings themselves: rotating black
holes, merging neutron stars, massive hyper-novas, alien spacecraft,
an entirely new kind of physics or nuclear explosions with perfect
efficiency. At least 140 theories have been advanced to explain these
flashes of light that can shine as brightly as all the stars in the
universe combined.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, two teams of astronomers, one at Caltech and one at
Notre Dame, announced that the Hubble Space Telescope--and follow-up
with telescopes on Earth--allowed them to find the culprit behind
these cosmic fireworks. They are death flares sent out by supernovas,
or exploding stars.</LD>
<TE>   "We've now got a very good idea of what the monster is underneath.
It's a massive collapsing star," said Dale Frail, a radio astronomer
at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M., who is
part of the Caltech team.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got a smoking gun here," said Jay Norris, an expert on
gamma ray bursts at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,
Md.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence Had Pointed</TE>
<TE>   to the Stars</TE>
<TE>   Norris said recent evidence has been leading astronomers toward
the idea that exploding stars probably cause the gamma ray bursts.
Among the discoveries was an April announcement by University of
Leicester astronomer James Reeves that the fireball-like afterglow of
a burst contained the same chemical elements created by a supernova.
Other observations show that the bursts originate in galaxies where
stars are hatching and dying at high rates.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, though, no one had made an observation crisp and
well-defined enough to prove it.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been a lot of what I call cocktail party suggestions"
about the origin of gamma ray bursts, said John Bahcall, an
astrophysicist at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Studies. "A
solid detection is a real breakthrough. It will transform the field."</TE>
<TE>   Making the observations--seeking the faint remnants of dying stars
from across the universe--proved extremely difficult. The success is
another example of astronomers using a new generation of powerful
telescopes to make observations that seemed impossible until
recently.</TE>
<TE>   "We've struggled for five years and only seen hints. Now it's
clear. It's a clean signature," said Shri Kulkarni, the Caltech
astronomer who led the team.</TE>
<TE>   Kris Stanek, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics who helped lead the Notre Dame team with astronomer
Peter Garnavich, called hunting for the source of the bursts "a
detective story as challenging as any faced by the famous Lt.
Columbo."</TE>
<TE>   The two teams made their observations Nov. 21 of a gamma ray burst
that occurred about 4 billion to 5 billion light-years from Earth.
They used the Hubble and several optical and radio telescopes in the
Southern Hemisphere. Using the Hubble, the team detected the remnants
of an exploded star, showing that a supernova accompanied the gamma
ray burst. They sighted a distinctive fingerprint of a supernova--a
"bump" in the light output that peaked a few weeks after the burst.</TE>
<TE>   "They're pretty good bumps," Norris said of the new data.</TE>
<TE>   The radio telescope observations helped confirm the theory by
showing the explosion took place in a cocoon of hot gas that could
only have been created by the massive star before it exploded. This
helps disprove the other leading theory: that the bursts come from a
collision of neutron stars, which are collapsed stars so dense they
pack the mass of a star the size of the sun into an area the size of
Chicago. The crash of neutron stars would not have left such a mess.</TE>
<TE>   "Once it became clear that we had not only seen the supernova, but
also the cocoon, I was very happy; I couldn't sleep for days," said
Paul Price, a graduate student at the Australian National University
and part of the Caltech team.</TE>
<TE>   Astronomers and theorists struggled for years to understand how
any object could send out such extreme amounts of energy. For years,
neutron star or black hole mergers were thought to be the only things
capable of expelling huge amounts of matter and energy at nearly the
speed of light. Theories ranged so widely because astronomers didn't
know where the gamma ray bursts came from and whether they were
originated within our own galaxy, even in our own solar system, or at
the distant edges of the universe.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Kulkarni led a Caltech team that used the Keck telescope
in Hawaii to determine that many of the objects were at "cosmological
distances"--so far away that they were created in the very earliest
epochs of the universe. The most distant burst recorded so far
occurred 30 billion light-years from Earth, Frail said. If the bursts
can be seen across huge distances, Kulkarni said, "it really makes
them the brightest objects in the universe."</TE>
<TE>   Norris also has discovered a class of gamma ray bursts that may
originate relatively nearby, just a few hundred million light-years
from Earth. These could also be caused by collapsing stars.</TE>
<TE>   500 May Go</TE>
<TE>   Unnoticed Each Day</TE>
<TE>   Other work on gamma ray bursts has shown that, while they are
bright, they are not as energetic as once believed. The energy from
the explosions is focused in narrow jets and is not expelled in all
directions, which would require more energy. When the beams of light
are pointed directly at Earth, they are very luminous. But many gamma
ray bursts that occur in the universe, perhaps as many as 500 a day,
are not pointed toward us and go undetected. There's still plenty of
work ahead. There is an entirely different class of gamma ray
burst--one that lasts less than two seconds and may be created by
black hole or neutron star crashes. The new supernova explanation
applies only to long-duration bursts, which make up the majority of
the several thousand gamma ray bursts that have been recorded.</TE>
<TE>   For the short-duration gamma ray bursts, there still is no
explanation. "We know nothing about them," Kulkarni said. "They
remain completely mysterious."</TE>

<LD>Provisions in the Republican welfare bill considered by the House on
Thursday:</LD>
<LD>   * Basic program: Renews block grants to states to run assistance
programs at $16.5billion per year.</LD>
<LD>   * Work requirements: Requires states to have 50% of their welfare
recipients in "work activities" for 40 hours per week immediately,
climbing to 70% by 2007.</LD>
<TE>   Requires that 24 of the 40 hours be spent in a regular job or a
community service position created by government; the other 16 hours
could be spent doing other activities designated by states.</TE>
<TE>   Allows states to put people in education, training, drug treatment
or other programs full time for three or four months every two years.</TE>
<TE>   * Child care: Increases funding for child-care subsidies by $2
billion over five years. The program now gets $4.8 billion each year.</TE>
<TE>   * Promoting marriage: Provides $100 million per year for
competitive grants for programs promoting healthy marriages. Provides
another $100 million for states, which would have to be equally
matched by states, for similar programs.</TE>
<TE>   * Time limits: Maintains the five-year lifetime limit.</TE>
<TE>   * Abstinence-only sex education: Continues state grants, at $50
million per year, to promote abstinence from sex until marriage.
Programs cannot discuss benefits of birth control.</TE>
<TE>   * State experiments: Allows states to ask permission to change
rules on a variety of programs. A last-minute change insisted upon by

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>It seems that last month was the second warmest April on record
worldwide, and was warmer and drier than usual for much of the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   The conditions led to a worsening drought in parts of the country,
particularly the Southwest and many cities along the Eastern
Seaboard, the National Climatic Data Center reported Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Overall it was the ninth warmest April on record for the U.S., at
an average of 54.6 degrees in the 48 contiguous states. That is 2.6
degrees above the 1895-2002 long-term average.</LD>
<TE>   Worldwide, preliminary data show the average land and ocean
temperature in April was 56.7 degrees, 1.03 degrees above the
long-term average.</TE>
<TE>   That's the second warmest average since 1880. The warmest April
worldwide was in 1998, when a strong El Nino warming of the
equatorial Pacific Ocean helped raise the readings. Researchers
report that another El Nino is developing, with sea-surface
temperatures rising above their usual levels in the Pacific.</TE>

<HD>11 New Moons of Jupiter Found</HD>
<DH>Space: The findings put the number of Jovian satellites at
39, the most recorded for any planet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A team of astronomers has found 11 new moons around Jupiter, bringing
the total number of Jovian satellites to 39.</LD>
<LD>   Jupiter now has more known satellites than any other planet.
Saturn is second with 30. Uranus has 20.</LD>
<LD>   Jupiter's newest additions were confirmed by the International
Astronomical Union and announced Thursday. They were first detected
in December by astronomers David Jewitt and Scott Sheppard of the
University of Hawaii and Jan Kleyna of Cambridge University using the
Canada-France-Hawaii telescope, a 3.6-meter optical telescope that
sports one of the largest digital cameras in the world.</LD>
<TE>   The satellites are all tiny compared to Jupiter's "Big Four"
moons--Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, which were originally
spotted by Galileo in 1610.</TE>
<TE>   Those hulking bodies are thousands of miles across; the newly
discovered satellites are between 1 and 2 miles across. The new
satellites are thought to be rocky, like asteroids or
planetesimals--the small chunks of dust, rock and frozen gas that
coalesced into planets as the solar system formed or were ejected
into distant reaches of the solar system to become comets.</TE>
<TE>   The new satellites are called "irregulars" because they have
looping, angled and eccentric orbits. Unlike the Big Four, the newly
discovered satellites spin in the opposite direction of Jupiter.
Jupiter has five families of satellites, differing in size and orbit
type.</TE>
<TE>   After Galileo's work, four new satellites were found around
Jupiter by the Voyager spacecraft and only nine more moons were found
by observers on Earth, all in the 20th century. The work was
painstaking: Astronomers looked for moons by scanning photographic
plates of the night sky under microscopes.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the search has become much easier because digital information
captured by telescopes can be analyzed quickly. The team that made
this discovery found 11 moons last year as well.</TE>
<TE>   "There's kind of a revolution going on," Jewitt said. "Now we do
it all by computers."</TE>
<TE>   They expect Jupiter will keep them busy for some time.</TE>
<TE>   "We think there are many, many more to be found. Maybe 100,"
Jewitt said.</TE>
<TE>   The team is not out to simply count moons.</TE>
<TE>   Because it approaches the size of the smallest stars and has so
many things orbiting it, Jupiter is often referred to by astronomers
as a mini solar system. Understanding how Jupiter acquired its
strange collection of satellites could lead to a better understanding
of how our solar system formed as well, Jewitt said.</TE>
<TE>   A chief question is how Jupiter acquired so many satellites. Did
its heft--300 times the mass of Earth--allow it to wrest them from an
orbit around the sun? Did some form from the same dusty disks that
spawned Jupiter and Earth? Were they speeding through the solar
system and only captured after a huge gassy atmosphere that may have
existed around Jupiter slowed them down? Are some of the tiny objects
the shattered remains of bigger moons?</TE>
<TE>   Said Jewitt: "We really don't know what's going on."</TE>

<HD>Attorneys for Lindh Want His Trial Moved to Bay Area</HD>
<DH>Courts: The defense team argues that the American Talib
can't get a fair trial in proximity to Washington, D.C.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Attorneys for John Walker Lindh argued in court Thursday that he
cannot get a fair trial in suburban Washington and that his case on
charges of betraying his country should either be dismissed or moved
to his native Bay Area.</LD>
<LD>   The lawyers, led by San Francisco attorney James J. Brosnahan,
complained that federal prosecutors had Lindh indicted in the
Washington suburb of Alexandria, Va., because it is near the scene of
the Sept. 11 attack on the Pentagon and home to countless residents
with connections to the U.S. military and the federal government.</LD>
<LD>   "John Lindh seeks dismissal of this case because, simply put, he
cannot get a fair trial," Brosnahan said in papers filed in federal
court in Alexandria.</LD>
<TE>   "The government, through repeated, prejudicial public statements,
has made a fair trial virtually unattainable. The Constitution allows
for only two possibilities: a fair trial or no trial."</TE>
<TE>   But moving the case to San Francisco would ease "a high level of
bias [that] persists against Mr. Lindh" in the Washington area and
also provide a convenience to the attorneys and potential witnesses
and be in the best "interest of justice," Brosnahan said.</TE>
<TE>   Long Trip for Parents</TE>
<TE>   He noted, for instance, that Lindh's parents are from Marin
County, and likely would be called to testify about controversial
e-mails their son sent from Central Asia, where he was studying Islam
and where he joined the Taliban in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "His parents reside in the Northern District of California,"
Brosnahan said. "The two-thousand mile barrier [to Alexandria] will
make it difficult for them to attend the trial and offer their
emotional support."</TE>
<TE>   Changes of venue, often sought in high-profile court cases, are
seldom granted, especially when judges are aware that potential
jurors from all over the country may have similar opinions on a
defendant's guilt or innocence.</TE>
<TE>   But it has happened. A noteworthy example is when the Oklahoma
City bombing trials for Timothy J. McVeigh and Terry L. Nichols were
moved to Denver after a federal judge ruled that the people of
Oklahoma were too biased against the defendants to find an impartial
jury there.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials prosecuting Lindh declined to comment Thursday
on the defense team's request.</TE>
<TE>   However, they are expected to respond in court with their own
explanation of why the trial, now scheduled to start in August,
should remain in Alexandria.</TE>
<TE>   Brosnahan said federal officials, from the Bush White House to
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, mounted a concerted campaign to poison
public opinion against Lindh, even to the point of alleging that
Lindh had a role in the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   No 9/11 Link Shown</TE>
<TE>   However, evidence so far in the case has shown that while Lindh
may have known about efforts by the Taliban and Al Qaeda to mount
terrorist strikes against the U.S., he has not been directly linked
to the airplane hijackings.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, he is facing life in prison on charges of taking up arms
against the United States and betraying his country by joining Osama
bin Laden's terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   "The Department of Justice chose Alexandria as the venue for
trials such as Mr. Lindh's, in part, because of the symbolism of
trying suspects near the site of the Pentagon attack," Brosnahan
said.</TE>
<TE>   "They chose ... an area that is home to the Pentagon and thousands
who were directly affected by the destruction of 9/11, but bears no
ties to Mr. Lindh or his alleged crimes."</TE>
<TE>   Yet holding the trial in San Francisco, he said, in addition to
making things easier for the Lindh family, also would accommodate
potential witnesses in California "who would be greatly
inconvenienced" by having to travel for trial to Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   He also noted that while Lindh's alleged crimes occurred abroad,
his religious convictions "may become an issue at trial, and he began
his study of religion in the Northern District of California."</TE>

<HD>Oil Report Shifts Focus Off ANWR</HD>
<DH>Energy: Federal study says different area of Alaska has
four times the reserves as was thought.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The sprawling National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska on the remote Arctic
coast contains four times more oil than previously believed, with
deposits even greater than those in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge, federal geologists reported Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   But the U.S. Geological Survey said the deposits are less
concentrated and more remote than ANWR's, and would prove more
lucrative to exploit only with a substantial increase in oil prices.</LD>
<LD>   The long-awaited report sets the stage for the Bush
administration's plan to open an additional 9.4 million acres of the
petroleum reserve to oil and gas leasing in 2004, a move that would
expand the industrial footprint on Alaska's North Slope into one of
the most remote and rugged reaches of the North American continent.</LD>
<TE>   The last official assessment of oil resources within the
23.5-million-acre petroleum reserve, conducted in 1980, estimated
there were only about 2 billion barrels of oil beneath the landscape
of rolling tundra, shallow ponds, lagoons and sand dunes.</TE>
<TE>   But new seismic technology and recent discoveries by the oil
industry on the outskirts of the reserve allowed USGS geologists to
get a better look, and they now say there is likely between 5.9
billion and 13.2 billion barrels of oil in the petroleum reserve,
with a mean estimate of 9.3 billion barrels.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, federal lands within the Arctic refuge--the subject
of a contentious debate in Congress this year before the Senate voted
against opening it for oil drilling--contain only 4.3billion to 11.8
billion barrels, with a mean estimate of 7.7 billion barrels.</TE>
<TE>   Those estimates are for what could technically be recovered from
the two areas, however, and they do not take into account the far
more important question of economics. The Arctic refuge contains less
oil and its development is more fraught with environmental
controversy, but its oil is much closer to existing roads and
pipelines and lies in larger, more easily developed pools, USGS
officials noted.</TE>
<TE>   The refuge's oil is largely concentrated within a 1.5-million-acre
section of the coastal plain in reservoirs as thick as 300 feet. The
oil in the petroleum reserve, government geologist Ken Bird said,
lies in reservoirs only about 50 feet thick, stretched across an area
300 miles wide and 200 miles from the coast inland to the Brooks
Range.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a huge, huge area, and a very important factor, because in
an economic analysis we have to evaluate the cost to transport any
discovered oil, which means you must calculate the cost of building
pipelines over to the main pipeline at Prudhoe Bay," Bird said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials were quick to emphasize that the
economics of production still favor development of the refuge, which
lies on the other side of Prudhoe Bay, to the east.</TE>
<TE>   "The significant thing about this report is it brings out the fact
that, at $20-a-barrel oil, there is very little economic oil in the
NPRA, and there is significant economic oil in the [ANWR] ... area,"
said Camden Toohey, the Interior Department's special representative
in Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   As long as oil prices remain below $35 a barrel, the USGS said, "a
larger volume of technically recoverable oil would be economic in the
[ANWR] ... area." Once prices exceed $35 a barrel, it said, NPRA and
ANWR "would have nearly equal volumes of economically recoverable
oil."</TE>
<TE>   Alaska crude oil prices currently are about $27 a barrel, but have
dipped far lower over the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of drilling in the Arctic refuge have conducted a
massive lobbying campaign this year to protect the narrow, fragile
coastal plain there. They said the new government estimates make it
clear that the refuge is not the only alternative for developing oil
in the Arctic area.</TE>
<TE>   The USGS report, said Adam Kolton of the Alaska Wilderness League,
"is the final nail in the coffin for Arctic refuge drilling in this
Congress. No one who's concerned about increasing oil production in
Alaska can with a straight face say the only option is the refuge."</TE>
<TE>   But conservationists said they were concerned that the government
is moving forward with oil development on millions of acres of Arctic
coastland without considering permanent protections for some of the
most sensitive areas.</TE>
<TE>   The petroleum reserve is a summer nesting and molting area for
millions of birds. It contains the largest lake in the North American
Arctic and its longest river, the Colville.</TE>
<TE>   In response to concerns from the conservation community, the
federal Bureau of Land Management recently removed 601,000 acres from
the original 9.6 million acres of the northwest NPRA under study for
oil leasing, including the entire Colville River watershed and one of
its tributaries, the Awuna River.</TE>
<TE>   BLM spokesman Ed Bovey said Thursday that the agency has decided
not to recommend a specific oil leasing strategy in the draft
Environmental Impact Statement, due in December. "I think they
[agency managers] just wanted to get a better feel for what the
public thought before they chose a course of action," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The BLM has scheduled a lease sale June 3 on 3 million acres in
the northeast section of the petroleum reserve, an area originally
leased in 1998. The decision to hold new leases came after Phillips
Alaska, which operates the 429-million-barrel Alpine field just
outside the NPRA, announced it had discovered oil in several wells
drilled under the initial lease sale.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips has not said how much oil it found, and spokeswoman Dawn
Patience said the company would have no comment on the new USGS
estimates. Likewise, BP Exploration Alaska, which drilled in the
petroleum reserve last year, did not comment on the report.</TE>

<HD>Priest Wrote Pope in '73 About Problems</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Top Roman Catholic Church officials knew as early as 1964 that a
Massachusetts priest was molesting children, newly released documents
reveal.</LD>
<LD>   The records of James A. Porter both push back the calendar on an
apparent church cover-up of pedophilia in the clergy and link
knowledge of the problem all the way to the Vatican.</LD>
<LD>   Included in the newest documents to surface in the vast scandal
over clerical sexual abuse is a 17-page letter from Porter to Pope
Paul VI in 1973, acknowledging that he had "become homosexually
involved with some of the youth" in his parish southeast of Boston.</LD>
<TE>   Porter was laicized, or defrocked, the same year. He married, had
children and, in 1993, was convicted of 41 counts of sexual abuse in
five Massachusetts parishes. He is scheduled to be released from
prison next year.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of pages of personnel files obtained under court order by
the Boston Herald included a 1964 memo about Porter written by Bishop
James Connolly of Fall River, Mass., after a meeting with Humberto
Medeiros, then a monsignor and chancellor of the Fall River diocese.</TE>
<TE>   The memo reported that "30 or 40" boys had made allegations
against Porter, causing "much concern among parents."</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, Medeiros rose to become cardinal. Upon his death in 1984,
he was succeeded by Bernard Law, who as archbishop of Boston is this
country's senior Catholic prelate.</TE>
<TE>   Law on Monday completed three days of a court-ordered deposition
in a civil lawsuit brought by 86 alleged victims of former priest
John J. Geoghan--who in January was sentenced to nine to 10 years in
prison on a single count of child molestation.</TE>
<TE>   Law has been under fire since documents printed in the Boston
Globe showed that church officials here repeatedly moved Geoghan to
parish duties involving children despite knowledge of sexual abuse
allegations against him.</TE>
<TE>   The new material about Porter "just shows that Law is no
aberration whatsoever--in fact his behavior is painfully typical,"
said David Clohessy, head of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by
Priests.</TE>
<TE>   "People who wanted to think Law was some kind of anomaly just
can't believe that anymore," Clohessy went on. "Anybody who wants to
define this as a bad apple problem can't see that the fault lies with
the barrel itself."</TE>
<TE>   Porter's letter to the pope recounts how Connolly "decided to send
me home to my family for a short while until the scandal of this
affair died down."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Porter continued in his missive to the pontiff, "Bishop
Connolly gave me another chance" and assigned him to another parish
in the Fall River diocese.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't recollect much about my stay there except that after a
short time, I again fell into the same situation that plagued me in
North Attleboro," where he was previously posted, Porter wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The new batch of documents shows that at least twice, Porter was
sent for treatment of his pedophilia to a church-run facility called
the Servants of Paraclete in New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   His first round of treatment at the facility took place in 1967,
the records reveal.</TE>

<HD>Congressional Gold Medals, Capitol Praise Bestowed on
Reagans</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush and lawmakers presented former President
Reagan and his wife, Nancy, with the highest civilian honor from
Congress on Thursday, praising Reagan as a leader who rescued America
from the malaise of the 1970s.</LD>
<LD>   Reagan, who is 91 and has Alzheimer's disease, did not attend the
Congressional Gold Medal ceremony. But he loomed large in the Capitol
hall where hundreds of lawmakers, Bush administration officials and
former Reagan administration officials gathered for the tribute.</LD>
<LD>   It was a nostalgic occasion for the largely Republican audience.
One speaker after another recalled Reagan as a leader who pulled the
United States into a prouder era, and whose legacy influences public
policy today.</LD>
<TE>   "Ronald Reagan believed in the strong character of the American
people, even when some on both the left and right were quite
skeptical of that character," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "Ronald Reagan is one of the largest figures of our time," he
said. "His name will always stand for courage and consistency, for
patriotism and resolve, and for humor and optimism."</TE>
<TE>   He kissed Nancy Reagan twice as he, Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.)
and House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) conferred the award on
her. The ceremony took place in the same room to which Reagan and his
wife had repaired after his first inauguration; where they had
learned that the hostages had been freed in Iran; and where Reagan
was inaugurated the second time because of bad weather.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to thank you, all of you, for all your expressions and
what you've said," Nancy Reagan said. Placing her hand on her heart,
she said, "And I, I can't say any more."</TE>
<TE>   Reagan once stood in front of the Berlin Wall and taunted Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, his Cold War adversary, with the cry,
"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!"</TE>
<TE>   But in a written tribute, Gorbachev said of Reagan, "We changed
the nature of relations between our countries by building trust."</TE>
<TE>   President Clinton signed the Gold Medal resolution for the Reagans
in July 2000. It praised Reagan, who served from 1981 to 1989, for
his leadership in restoring optimism to the nation and bringing an
end to the Cold War. Nancy Reagan was recognized for her efforts to
curb alcohol and drug abuse among the nation's youth.</TE>
<TE>   According to the White House, it is up to congressional leaders to
decide when to present the award to an honoree.</TE>
<TE>   George Washington received the first Congressional Gold Medal in
1776. The only other presidential couple to receive it was Gerald R.
and Betty Ford in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Bush previously gave the medal to the family of the late Cardinal
John O'Connor of New York and to 29 Navajo Indians for creating an
unbreakable code used by the Marines during World War II's fiercest
battles.</TE>

<HD>Former Classmate Testifies Skakel Confessed to Killing Girl</HD>
<DH>Trial: Witness says the Kennedy cousin spoke at length of
the incident, concluding, 'I did it.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NORWALK, Conn.</DL>
<LD>NORWALK, Conn. -- Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel made a tearful
confession about killing Martha Moxley when he attended a
substance-abuse treatment center in the 1970s, a former classmate
testified Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   John Higgins was one of three former students at the Elan School
in Maine to take the stand at Skakel's murder trial. Under
cross-examination, Higgins said he initially lied to an investigator
by withholding information about the confession.</LD>
<LD>   Skakel, 41, a nephew of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, is charged with
beating Moxley to death with a golf club in their Greenwich, Conn.,
neighborhood in 1975 when they were both 15. He could get life in
prison if convicted.</LD>
<TE>   Under questioning by prosecutors, Higgins described a prolonged
and tearful confession that took place while he and Skakel sat
together on a porch at Elan.</TE>
<TE>   Higgins said Skakel told him about a party at his home and that he
remembered going through some golf clubs in his garage.</TE>
<TE>   Skakel "related that he was running through some woods," Higgins
recalled. "He had a golf club in his hand. He looked up, he saw pine
trees. The next thing he remembers is he woke up in his house."</TE>
<TE>   Higgins said Skakel then made a "progression of statements"--first
saying he didn't know whether he had killed Moxley but eventually
saying, "I did it."</TE>
<TE>   Charles Seigan was the first of the former students to take the
stand. He testified that Skakel told classmates he was drunk the
night Moxley was beaten to death and that he did not know whether he
killed her.</TE>
<TE>   Seigan said Skakel's alleged involvement came up on several
occasions. The first time was during a group meeting of about 90
people called to confront Skakel about running away from Elan, Seigan
said.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Ricci, the school's director, "blurted out" the possibility
that Skakel had killed someone, Seigan said.</TE>
<TE>   During smaller group meetings, Skakel would say he was drunk and
had a blackout the night of the slaying, Seigan said.</TE>
<TE>   "He would generally come to tears, shake his head and say, 'I
don't know,'" Seigan said. "And there were other times when he was
irritated with the questions."</TE>
<TE>   Seigan described Elan as a "crazy place" where students were
forced to take part in boxing sessions and to publicly berate
classmates.</TE>
<TE>   Judge John F. Kavanewsky Jr. ruled that prosecutors could present
the written testimony of another Elan student, Gregory Coleman, who
died last year after using drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman admitted during pretrial hearings that he was on heroin
when he told a one-judge grand jury that Skakel confessed. But
Coleman stuck by his statement that Skakel told him: "I'm gonna get
away with murder. I'm a Kennedy."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Thursday, a former limousine driver for the Skakel family
took the stand.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Zicarelli said that in 1977, Skakel was crying during a
trip to the doctor's office in New York City and apologizing for his
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Skakel and his father, Rushton, had been arguing that morning,
Zicarelli said. Once in the city, Michael bolted from the car and
Zicarelli said he found him walking toward the doctor's office.</TE>
<TE>   Skakel told him "he had done something very bad, and he had to
either kill himself or get out of the country," Zicarelli testified.</TE>
<TE>   Zicarelli said he later asked Skakel what he had done that was so
terrible.</TE>
<TE>   "He said if I knew what he had done, I would never talk to him
again," Zicarelli said.</TE>
<TE>   Zicarelli testified that he gave two weeks' notice that day, and
was immediately fired by Rushton Skakel.</TE>

<HD>High School Smoking Drops to Its Lowest Level in a Decade</HD>
<DH>Health: Just 28.5% said they had had a cigarette in the
previous month. Officials credit higher taxes and school programs as
reasons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Smoking among U.S. high school students has dropped to its lowest
level in a decade, the government said Thursday, crediting steep
cigarette taxes and school programs that discourage youngsters from
taking up the habit.</LD>
<LD>   Just 28.5% of high-schoolers in a nationwide survey last year
reported they had smoked a cigarette in the previous month--down from
36.4% five years ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
said.</LD>
<LD>   The rate is the lowest since 1991, when 27.5% of high school
students said they smoked. The figure had climbed for most of the
1990s before reversing in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   "This is terrific news," said Matthew Myers, president of the
Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. "This is dramatic evidence that the
combination of tax increases and prevention programs are the
equivalent of a vaccine."</TE>
<TE>   The average retail price of cigarettes jumped 70% from December
1997 to May 2001, and CDC analysts said studies by health economists
show high cost deters many minors from smoking.</TE>
<TE>   Many states are pushing for even higher taxes on cigarettes,
particularly as they look for ways to raise money in a tough economy.
State taxes range from 2 cents a pack in Virginia to $1.50 in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC said high-schoolers also appear to be getting the
anti-smoking message pushed by national media campaigns, and
school-based anti-tobacco programs also appear to be sinking in.</TE>
<TE>   Health officials would like to see all the factors expanded in
coming years. They want the high school smoking rate to be much
lower--16% at most--by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   "The rates are starting to turn around, but we need a continued
effort," said Dr. Terry Pechacek of the CDC's Office on Smoking and
Health.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest data, smoking among freshmen, sophomores, juniors
and seniors all showed sharp declines from the highs of the 1990s.
Seniors still smoke most often--35.2%--and freshmen the least, at
23.9%.</TE>
<TE>   In the survey, an anonymous questionnaire given to 13,601
students, 63.9% of high school students said they had taken at least
one puff of a cigarette in their lifetimes. That was down from 70.2%
in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   And 13.8% said they were frequent smokers, defined as having
smoked on at least 20 days in the previous month. That figure was
16.7% in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, tobacco companies agreed to pay $246 billion to settle
lawsuits from states and accepted restrictions on advertising and
marketing. Some states use money from the settlement to pay for
anti-smoking programs.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Smith, a spokesman for tobacco giant Brown &amp; Williamson, said
the figures are good news. But he denied that raising cigarette
prices contributes to a decline in teenage smoking. He said that when
prices go up, teens simply turn to other places to find cheaper
cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids, unfortunately, are not price-sensitive," he said. "They can
afford to buy a $100 pair of sneakers. There's much more disposable
income in the hands of children than ever before."</TE>
<TE>   But the CDC's Pechacek said price increases are particularly
effective at deterring first-time smokers--youngsters who might have
borrowed or stolen a first cigarette but cannot afford a full pack or
carton.</TE>
<TE>   Boys in high school were more likely to smoke than girls, 29.2%,
compared with 27.7%. Girls were slightly more likely to smoke in the
survey taken in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   And whites were much more likely to say they smoke, 31.9%,
compared with just 14.7% of black students. Among Latino students,
26.6% said they smoked.</TE>

<HD>Study Cites Hazards of Space Junk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The main orbit for the world's communications satellites--about
22,000 miles out in space--could become hazardous and unusable unless
old, worn-out spacecraft are discarded into an orbiting junkyard
deeper in space, a study suggests.</LD>
<LD>   Orbiting spacecraft debris already presents a hazard in low Earth
orbit, say experts, noting that the International Space Station was
maneuvered Wednesday to avoid a potential collision.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Crowther, a British expert on orbiting space debris, said
the world could face an even more serious problem if spacecraft
operators don't clean up after themselves in geosynchronous orbit,
the high station used by most international communications
satellites.</LD>
<TE>   Without action, said Crowther, "crowding will occur and collisions
will be inevitable."</TE>
<TE>   Satellites that download television signals to dishes on the
ground are stationed about 22,300 miles above the equator, an orbit
that allows a satellite to remain in the same place in the sky
relative to a fixed point on the ground. That's why it is called a
geosynchronous orbit. Communication dishes aimed at such satellites
can remain stationary, pointing to the same place in the sky.</TE>
<TE>   "Geo-sync is a unique global resource," Crowther said. "There is
no place to move to once you have polluted this region."</TE>
<TE>   If satellites in geo-sync are simply left where they are after
they wear out, they could remain there for thousands of years. The
biggest risk is that their batteries or fuel tanks would explode,
creating a cloud of small particles, each of which could be lethal
for other satellites.</TE>
<TE>   "A small coin traveling at 10 kilometers a second [about 22,300
miles per hour] through space will have the same impact energy as a
small bus traveling at 100 kilometers an hour [62 mph] on the
ground," Crowther said in Science.</TE>
<TE>   The International Telecommunications Union, which allocates
positions in geo-sync, recommended years ago that satellite operators
send their worn-out spacecraft to a higher orbit where they will not
present a risk to other satellites.</TE>
<TE>   Not enough satellite owners are following the rules, said Nicholas
L. Johnson, chief scientist and manager for the orbital debris
program office at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.</TE>

<HD>Hospitalized Accused Priest Is Found Dead</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Connecticut prelate had resigned and is an
apparent suicide. He was being treated at a Catholic psychiatric
institution in Maryland.</DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SILVER SPRING, Md.</DL>
<LD>A Connecticut priest who resigned amid allegations of sexual
misconduct apparently killed himself Thursday at a Catholic
psychiatric hospital, church officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The Diocese of Bridgeport, Conn., identified the priest as Father
Alfred J. Bietighofer, 64, who left his parish in April and was
ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation.</LD>
<LD>   Bietighofer was found hanged in his room Thursday at St. Luke
Institute, according to Prince George's County police and hospital
officials.</LD>
<TE>   It's the second apparent suicide of a priest since the sex abuse
scandal engulfing the Roman Catholic Church erupted in Boston early
this year. Last month, a priest in Ohio was found dead after being
accused of molesting a girl.</TE>
<TE>   "I am profoundly saddened by the tragic death of Father Alfred
Bietighofer," Bridgeport Bishop William Lori said in a statement
Thursday. "To parishioners and to all those whom Father Bietighofer
assisted during the course of his priestly ministry, I extend my
sincere sympathy and prayers."</TE>
<TE>   Two men told diocesan officials Bietighofer abused them when they
were boys in the late 1970s and early 1980s, church officials said.
Bietighofer, who was assistant pastor of St. Andrew Parish in
Bridgeport, resigned April 29.</TE>
<TE>   "The allegations from the two gentlemen were credible enough to
warrant immediate action, in line with our policy," Lori said at the
time the priest resigned.</TE>
<TE>   Father Robert J. Crofut, pastor of St. Andrew Church, declined
comment Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   The Connecticut Post reported that the men accused Bietighofer of
fondling them when they were children when he was assigned to Blessed
Sacrament Church in Bridgeport.</TE>
<TE>   Bietighofer told the Post he did not know anything about the
allegations. Church officials said they weren't aware of the
allegations against Bietighofer until seeing the newspaper's story.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials did not report the allegations against
Bietighofer to authorities, but said they would cooperate if asked
for information.</TE>
<TE>   Bietighofer had served in the Bridgeport diocese since he was
ordained in 1965, except for two yearlong stints in Peru in the 1970s
and 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   St. Luke treats priests and nuns for a variety of mental health
problems, including alcoholism, depression and pedophilia. About a
quarter of the institute's 65 beds are used by clergy undergoing
treatment for sexual abuse problems. Its residential programs are
open to the religious; outpatient programs are open to anyone.</TE>
<TE>   It has become one of the best-known treatment centers and is used
heavily by U.S. and some international dioceses.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 priests have been dismissed or resigned across the
country since the sex abuse scandal emerged.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, a priest was shot and seriously wounded outside his
Baltimore home allegedly by a man who accused him of abuse nine years
ago.</TE>

<HD>Bush Team on Defensive in Threat Inquiry</HD>
<DH>Terror: White House 'did everything that it could' in
August, security advisor says. Congress pushes for explanation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration, on the defensive for the first time over
Sept. 11, mobilized Thursday to justify its handling of information
it received in August that Osama bin Laden's terrorist network might
seek to hijack U.S. aircraft.</LD>
<LD>   Responding to a barrage of questions from Capitol Hill, the White
House insisted that it was never presented with specific information
that would have enabled it to anticipate or prevent the attacks on
the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   "This government did everything that it could," said National
Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice. "There was nothing specific to
which to react. Had this president known of something more specific,
or that a plane was going to be used as a missile, he would have
acted."</LD>
<TE>   Rice's comments came during a news conference hastily arranged at
the White House after leading members of Congress had spent much of
the day calling for new inquiries into what the White House knew
about Al Qaeda's intentions, and what it had done to protect the
public.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) both expressed concern with the
administration's handling of the matter, and said expanded
investigations of Sept. 11 might be warranted.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm gravely concerned," Daschle said. "Why did it take eight
months for us to receive this information?" Gephardt called the fresh
disclosures "disturbing," and said White House officials need to
provide a full accounting of what they knew leading up to Sept. 11,
"when they knew it, and, most importantly, what was done about it."</TE>
<TE>   While not specifically criticizing President Bush, the comments
from dozens of lawmakers--mainly Democrats--represented the most
forceful challenge yet of the president on a matter relating directly
to the Sept. 11 attacks. Until now, the president's post-attack
popularity has rendered him beyond political reproach on
counterterrorism matters.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans accused Democrats of seeking to exploit the issue for
partisan gain. House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) called the
criticism aimed at the White House "deplorable" and "unconscionable."</TE>
<TE>   In a speech in New York on Thursday evening, Vice President Dick
Cheney said the attacks on the White House were "thoroughly
irresponsible and totally unworthy of national leaders in a time of
war." He also warned Congress against expanding investigations of the
intelligence agencies that might "interfere with the ongoing efforts
to prevent the next attack."</TE>
<TE>   And Bush, who attended a previously scheduled noontime meeting
with Republican senators in the Capitol, was said to have remarked
that there was a "sniff of politics in the air."</TE>
<TE>   The tempest was triggered by the White House's disclosure
Wednesday that President Bush was told in a CIA briefing Aug. 6 that
Bin Laden's network might seek to hijack airplanes. Previously, the
White House had said only that it had no indication of the Sept. 11
plot.</TE>
<TE>   Even critics of the administration acknowledged that the warning
appears to have been so vague that expecting the White House to have
foreseen Sept. 11 is unfair.</TE>
<TE>   But the disclosure added to mounting evidence that authorities
failed to act on clues and suspicions that, when combined, might have
provided a strong indication that a Sept. 11-style plot was at least
possible, if not underway.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI recently acknowledged that one of its agents in Phoenix
had warned in a memo last July of suspicious activity of Middle
Easterners in area flight schools. A month later, the FBI in
Minnesota took into custody flight school student Zacarias Moussaoui,
a man the bureau has since accused of being the intended 20th
hijacker.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't fault the White House on this," said Sen. Richard C.
Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence
Committee. "But if the information from Phoenix were combined with
the general warning [conveyed to Bush] and the incident in Minnesota,
I believe that we might have stopped or at least partially stopped
Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   Shelby is among the lawmakers leading a congressional
investigation of intelligence failures surrounding Sept. 11. In the
wake of these latest revelations, he said, "I fear there are a lot of
things we're just beginning to uncover in this investigation. And the
agencies don't want this uncovered."</TE>
<TE>   Rice said Thursday that the August briefing came to light this
week because it had been uncovered by that congressional
investigation. Sources familiar with the probe said investigators
learned of the warning Monday. The White House claims that some
members of Congress had received the same information Bush got in the
Aug. 6 briefing, but members of the intelligence committees disputed
that.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosure put the Bush White House in a defensive political
posture for much of the day. To help defuse the situation, top
officials turned to Rice, perceived as a persuasive, nonpartisan
figure in the administration.</TE>
<TE>   In a rare impromptu news conference, Rice presented the most
detailed accounting to date of the intelligence the administration
says it had leading up to Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   She stressed that none of the reports received by the White House
had any specific information pointing to the Sept. 11 plot. She also
said neither she nor Bush recalls being made aware before Sept. 11 of
the warning from the Phoenix FBI agent or the suspicions triggered by
Moussaoui's arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Rice said CIA Director George J. Tenet and FBI Director Robert
Mueller have been asked to determine whether it is possible that
either of those FBI matters was called to her or Bush's attention.</TE>
<TE>   The briefing the president received at his Texas ranch, she said,
dealt broadly with the methods of attack Al Qaeda had either used in
previous strikes, or might consider in the future. Hijacking a plane
was mentioned, she said, "but hijacking in the traditional sense,"
meaning the taking of a plane with the intent to demand a ransom.</TE>
<TE>   There was no sense, she said, that Al Qaeda "would try to use a
plane as a missile," even though in recent years authorities have
uncovered plots in the Philippines and France in which hijacked
aircraft were to be aimed at buildings including the CIA headquarters
and the Eiffel Tower.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, national security experts were primarily concerned that
Bin Laden might hijack a plane to demand the release of an Al Qaeda
operative such as the sheik convicted of conspiring to bomb New
York-area landmarks.</TE>
<TE>   The Aug. 6 briefing followed months of high activity in
intelligence channels trained on Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups,
Rice said. Most of the intelligence centered on likely overseas
targets. She said the administration never saw any reason to issue
the sort of public alert it has broadcast frequently since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said
Thursday that he had received briefings last summer similar to those
given to President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "There was never anything that we received that would have
predicted with credible and specific information anything resembling
the World Trade Center attacks," said Chet Lunner, the spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The information was relayed to the FAA and the airlines, he said.
But it is unclear what, if anything, was done.</TE>
<TE>   FAA regulations allowing passengers to bring aboard knives with a
blade up to four inches remained unchanged.</TE>

<HD>Marriage, Work Part of House Welfare Bill</HD>
<DH>Congress: The 229-197 near party-line vote reflects sharp
partisan divide over the issue. Only 14 Democrats supported the
measure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Seeking to launch a second stage of welfare reform, House members on
Thursday approved stiffer work requirements for people on welfare and
new efforts to promote marriage among the poor.</LD>
<LD>   As Congress conducted its first major debate on welfare since a
sweeping policy overhaul in 1996, the Republican majority also
approved a $2-billion hike in child-care spending, rejecting
Democrats' demands for a much larger increase.</LD>
<LD>   The final vote of 229 to 197 closely followed party lines and
reflected a sharp partisan divide over government's role in helping
those who depend on public aid or are struggling to escape it. Only
14 of the chamber's 211 Democrats supported the bill.</LD>
<TE>   "Millions of Americans have moved from welfare rolls to payrolls,
but our work is not finished," said Rep. J.C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma,
a top-ranking Republican. "We need to reach out a helping hand to
those remaining welfare recipients and help guide them into the work
force and independence."</TE>
<TE>   The bill, which embodies priorities of the Bush White House, would
maintain welfare spending at about $16.5 billion a year. The current
welfare law, enacted in 1996, expires in September.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans took credit Thursday for welfare reform as a historic
success and repeatedly needled Democrats for past predictions that it
would be a calamity for the poor. The 141-page bill is the
government's most significant initiative in welfare since 1996, when
Congress established work as the official goal, ended lifetime
entitlements to aid and gave the states new control over their
welfare programs.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the best social program in terms of improving people's
lives that we have ever had probably in the history of the Congress,"
said Rep. Michael N. Castle (R-Del.)</TE>
<TE>   The broad outlines of reform are now widely accepted in both
parties. But new disputes flared Thursday about how to move forward,
including questions about the treatment of immigrants, overall
funding levels and whether government should actively champion
marriage. The House GOP view on these matters is not universally
shared in the Democrat-controlled Senate, where welfare will be
debated next and members are seeking a bipartisan compromise.</TE>
<TE>   "In my state, we don't think the government has much business
getting into your life," Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus
(D-Mont.) said. "Marriage is a personal ... private choice."</TE>
<TE>   Under the GOP plan, states would use as much as $300 million for
experimental efforts to promote marriage and family stability. The
bill also would preserve a $50-million program to encourage sexual
abstinence for single people.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Thursday's debate focused on Republican efforts to sharply
scale upward the work expected of those receiving welfare.</TE>
<TE>   States would be expected to gradually move 70% of adult welfare
recipients into jobs, up from today's 50% target (and the actual rate
of about 40%). Further, it would narrow the definition of acceptable
work activities by imposing new limits on vocational education as a
substitute for work.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill also would establish a 40-hour week of activities
for welfare recipients, demanding 24 hours of actual work and leaving
open a more flexible 16 hours that states could use for many
purposes, including education, training and family activities. The
current law envisions a 30-hour week, but it applies to relatively
few recipients.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill also would allow certain exceptions to the 40-hour
week of activities, including as much as four months every two years
for welfare recipients to complete certain training programs.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe in the human spirit so strongly we feel that if you
raise that level of expectation they will rise to meet it," said Rep.
Clay E. Shaw Jr. (R-Fla.), recalling how the foes of welfare reform
had predicted it would lead to children sleeping on street grates.
"History tells us that we were right."</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats said the work proposal would take away the
flexibility states have in designing welfare programs, and create
pressure to establish large community service programs for recipients
to meet the work requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone agrees that the welfare reform bill of 1996 worked, but
it worked because we did not impose unrealistic, make-work
requirements on states and then leave them with no way to pay for
them," said Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.). "It worked because we
gave states the flexibility they needed to create a mixture of
training, services and work that helped their citizens find
decent-paying jobs."</TE>
<TE>   House Democrats also warned that the bill would saddle states with
costly new demands for child care and other expenses, amounting to an
"unfunded mandate" in the billions of dollars--$2.5 billion in
California alone, according to some estimates. They pushed to give
states more latitude to steer recipients into education and training
rather than into the first available job.</TE>
<TE>   They argued that, despite a decline in the welfare rolls of more
than 50% since 1996, government must do much more to help needy
families survive and ultimately move up the economic ladder.</TE>
<TE>   "While we have moved many off welfare, we have not achieved the
goals of promoting long-term economic independence, jobs that lift
and keep families out of poverty, or improved living standards for
millions of children," said Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez).</TE>
<TE>   Democrats maintained that stricter GOP work rules would spark an
explosion in demand for child care among low-income mothers. They
dismissed the Republicans' $2-billion hike as grossly inadequate,
instead proposing $11 billion and distributing survey data that
documented lengthy waiting lists for child care in most states.
(California has 280,000 on the waiting list.)</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that, if you're going to impose that heavy a work
requirement, you've got to give that mother some sense of security
that she's got some place to drop off her child," Rep. Xavier Becerra
(D-Los Angeles) said in an interview, adding, "You can't do it on the
cheap."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans countered that the sharp decline in welfare rolls
since the mid-1990s, to about 2.1 million households has freed up
resources the states can use for child-care needs. Accusations of an
unfunded mandate are "almost laughable," said Rep. John A. Boehner
(R-Ohio).</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the debate, House Republicans harked back to the heated
emotions of 1996, when the Democratic critics of welfare reform
conjured up horrific images of its impact on the poor: "They were
wrong then," said Ways and Means Committee Chairman William M. Thomas
(R-Bakersfield). "They're wrong now."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>August is a quiet time in this town. Congress is out of session, and
many bureaucrats head to the shore to escape the Beltway's stifling
humidity.</LD>
<LD>   But around the country last August, strange things were
happening--things that are now stirring increasingly troubling
questions about whether authorities back in Washington should have
suspected that a terrorist attack was imminent.</LD>
<LD>   In Minnesota, French Moroccan student Zacarias Moussaoui was taken
into custody after his strange behavior and flashy cash payments at a
flight school raised suspicions.</LD>
<TE>   In Arizona, an FBI agent warned in a lengthy memo that authorities
should be on the lookout for Al Qaeda-trained operatives using U.S.
flight schools.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, two Osama bin Laden associates who showed up on a
terrorist watch list--and who weeks later would help hijack the plane
that slammed into the Pentagon--were living quietly in the area
despite a coast-to-coast hunt by the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   And in Texas, a vacationing President Bush was told by the CIA
that Bin Laden operatives were seeking to hijack aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   All four episodes took place within a few weeks of each other last
summer. But poor communication, disjointed coordination among
intelligence agencies and questionable attention to counter-terrorism
operations may have hindered the ability of any one individual or
agency to determine their collective significance, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The new evidence about last summer becomes even more pronounced
against a backdrop of previous warnings about Al Qaeda-linked
terrorist threats against Americans in such far-flung spots as
Canada, France, Spain, Turkey and the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   In several of these episodes, U.S. authorities had eyewitness
testimony from Al Qaeda-trained terrorists. A Montreal-based
operative caught with massive amounts of explosives at the Canadian
border in December 1999 later admitted that he was planning to blow
up Los Angeles International Airport, and a terrorist caught in
Manila told police in 1996 that Al Qaeda was planning to hijack 11
U.S. airliners simultaneously and crash into CIA headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   The later information prompted the Federal Aviation Administration
to warn that "there is every reason to believe that civil aviation
will continue to be an attractive target for terrorist groups."</TE>
<TE>   And the FAA in late July 2001--just days before the CIA warning to
Bush--issued a report saying for the first time that Bin Laden and
his followers were "a significant threat to civil aviation."</TE>
<TE>   "That statement made it pretty plain that people ought to be
paying attention," said Gerald Kauvar, who was staff director of a
White House aviation safety commission during the Clinton
administration. "It strengthens the case that if security people got
this [warning], they should have acted on it."</TE>
<TE>   Many Democrats and even some Republicans in Congress said Thursday
that they were deeply troubled by the new revelations about what the
White House and the intelligence community knew in advance of Sept.
11, and they promised to investigate the administration's performance
fully in upcoming congressional hearings to determine whether the
White House dropped the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), head of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said he was particularly troubled by the disclosure that
an FBI agent in Phoenix had recommended last summer that
investigators probe possible terrorist plans and Bin Laden links
among Middle Eastern students at flight schools. The recommendation
never reached senior levels, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "How in the world could somebody have read this [FBI] document and
not had lights, firecrackers, rockets go off in their head that this
is something that is really important?" Graham asked.</TE>
<TE>   A former Justice Department official who asked not to be
identified said the controversy hinges on the question of whether the
administration kept information from the public.</TE>
<TE>   "They may not have known that the planes were going to be hijacked
and used as missiles, but given what they did know, how could they
not have warned the public?" the former official asked.</TE>
<TE>   For the last eight months, however, the Bush administration has
insisted that even in hindsight, there was no way intelligence
officials could have predicted and disrupted the tragic events of
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, just hours after the attacks, White House spokesman Ari
Fleischer said Bush had "no warnings" of an attack, and on Thursday,
the White House launched an aggressive defense of its actions
following the disclosure that the CIA had briefed Bush weeks before
the attacks about the prospect of Al Qaeda hijackings.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA's analysis for Bush was "the most generalized type of
information--there was no time, there was no place, there was no
method of attack," National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice told
reporters Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Rice acknowledged that there was "a lot of chatter" from
intelligence sources last spring and summer about the possibility of
more terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a clear concern that something was up, that something
was coming. But it was principally focused overseas," she said, with
particular concern about the threat of violence against Bush at the
Group of 8 economic summit in Italy last July.</TE>
<TE>   Over the summer of 2001, federal authorities put out multiple
alerts, internally and to law enforcement agencies, that warned about
the threat of terrorist attacks, Rice said. Authorities were so
concerned about the threat of attacks in Paris, Turkey and Italy that
they moved to suspend nonessential travel by U.S. counter-terrorism
staff, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous embassies around the world were shuttered and the
Pentagon last June abruptly ended military exercises in Jordan and
called the highest state of alert for U.S. military forces in the
Persian Gulf after intercepted communications indicated an imminent
attack by Bin Laden terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   But, Rice said, despite the high level of concern, putting out a
public warning about the threat of a hijacking "would have risked
shutting down" the aviation industry.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement and intelligence officials reacted angrily to the
second-guessing that erupted Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone wants to blame someone, but there was nothing the
intelligence community knew that could have prevented what happened
Sept. 11--period, end of story. This is all rhetoric," said one U.S.
official who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   An FBI official who also asked not to be identified said that
"people are asking legitimate questions, but Sept. 10 was a very
different time than Sept. 11. There was not the hypersensitivity to
these reports that there is now."</TE>
<TE>   The missed warning signals also point up the failure of different
U.S. intelligence agencies working in counter-terrorism to operate on
the same page, some analysts believe.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Sept. 11 hijackers Khalid Al-Midhar and Nawaq
Alhazmzi, for instance, the CIA alerted the FBI last August that the
two men were linked to Bin Laden and other terrorists and were
thought to have entered the United States, but FBI officials say they
were never told the urgency of that alert.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI searched for the two men in the days before Sept. 11, but
it was too late to find the pair, who had previously lived in San
Diego before they helped crash an American Airlines flight into the
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, more than a year before the terrorist attacks, FBI
agents in Phoenix had been monitoring a group of Middle Eastern
flight school students, including one who adhered to radical beliefs
about Islamic world domination.</TE>
<TE>   The revelations of the last few days have prompted many
intelligence and law enforcement specialists to ask what might have
happened last August if someone had been able to connect the dots. If
the FBI in Arizona knew that agents in Minneapolis had stumbled upon
Moussaoui at a flight school there--or that the CIA was warning the
president about the prospect of hijackings--could things have turned
out differently on Sept. 11? they ask.</TE>
<TE>   "What this means is that the same old confrontations, the same
cat-and-mouse game that has been going on for 50 years between the
CIA and the FBI, contributed to the inability of the U.S. government
to put together all of the intelligence needed to increase the
chances of predicting Sept. 11," said a former senior official in
counter-terrorism. ''It took 9/11, tragically, to force them to share
intelligence that they should have been sharing all along."</TE>

<HD>Nuclear Dump Called Insufficient</HD>
<DH>Environment: The Yucca Mountain site, as planned, can hold
only part of nation's waste.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham acknowledged
Thursday that a proposed Nevada waste dump will be too small to
accommodate all the nation's nuclear waste and might have to be
expanded.</LD>
<LD>   Under intense questioning from Nevada's two senators, Abraham
conceded that the Yucca Mountain repository as envisioned could
handle only a fraction of the waste expected to be generated by
commercial power plants and the government in the coming decade.</LD>
<LD>   Thousands of tons of "this stuff is still going to be [stored]
around the country," Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) told Abraham, who
acknowledged that probably would be the case.</LD>
<TE>   The Bush administration has argued repeatedly that the proposed
Nevada repository should be built so that radioactive waste now at
commercial power reactors and federal sites in 39 states can be
consolidated and better protected at a single location.</TE>
<TE>   About 45,000 tons of radioactive waste are kept around the
country. An additional 20,000 tons are expected to be generated by
power reactors before Yucca Mountain can be opened, Abraham said.</TE>
<TE>   If a federal license is obtained, the Yucca facility would be
scheduled to accept its first waste shipments in 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Abraham said it would receive a minimum 3,000 tons of waste a year
for 23 years. The industry has estimated that reactors produce about
2,000 tons of waste annually.</TE>
<TE>   Ensign and Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said those figures debunk the
administration's national security argument, as thousands of tons of
waste will remain without a central repository even after the Yucca
Mountain site becomes filled to capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Still, insisted Abraham, any waste taken to Yucca Mountain would
be waste no longer kept in less-safe temporary facilities including
some near highly populated or environmentally sensitive areas.</TE>
<TE>   After the hearing, Abraham opened the possibility that the Yucca
Mountain facility eventually might be expanded. Congress has limited
its initial design to 77,000 tons of waste, but Abraham said a future
energy secretary after 2007 can consider expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Abraham said the Nevada site has room for more than the initial
77,000 tons. It was unclear how such a move would affect the
project's licensing or the likelihood of further legal challenges by
Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush designated the Nevada site as the country's central
nuclear waste repository and said he would seek a federal license for
it. As was its right under a 1982 nuclear waste law, Nevada filed a
formal objection. That can be overridden only by majority vote of
both chambers of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The House already has overridden the Nevada veto. The Senate must
vote before July 26, or the Nevada objection will stand. The Nevadans
are waging a difficult fight. A survey in this week's National
Journal magazine showed that 48 senators already planned to vote
against Nevada, with 32 undecided.</TE>
<TE>   Abraham reiterated his conviction that the Yucca Mountain site,
which has been studied for two decades, is geologically safe to hold
the waste, which will remain highly radioactive for thousands of
years.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada's senators have long argued that if Yucca Mountain were
built, thousands of tons of used reactor fuel would still be kept at
reactors around the country.</TE>
<TE>   They also have argued that shipping waste would pose greater risks
than leaving the caches where they are.</TE>
<TE>   Abraham rejected claims that the waste would pose a transportation
hazard. The government and nuclear industry have had "30 years of
safe shipment of spent nuclear fuel ... without any harmful radiation
release," Abraham said.</TE>

berths from 1987-98, including four semifinal appearances and one
trip to the finals in 1998, the season he earned The Times' Orange
County coach of the year honors. His boys' teams also made the
playoffs three times from 1993-99.</TE>
<TE>   Leander, who moved to Temecula for more affordable housing,
returned to coaching this season, leading the Golden Bears (19-3) to
the Southwestern League title. Entering Thursday's match, he
predicted Temecula Valley would be a long way from playing to
Capistrano Valley's level.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was coaching at Capistrano Valley, we used to be the No. 3
team in league and would draw a team from Riverside in the first
round," he said. "They would have a great record, like us, but the
match would never be close."</TE>
<TE>   Capistrano Valley (17-2) was led by Logan Johnson in singles and
the doubles team of Chad Wallace and Ajay Ahluwalia, who swept at 6-0
in three sets.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Arritt</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton Troy 16, Riverside North 2--No. 1 singles player Jeffrey
Das did not lose a game while sweeping three sets and the No. 3
doubles team of freshmen Jeffrey Hsu and Patrick Yan won, 6-0, 6-0,
6-1, in another sweep for No. 2-seeded Troy (25-1), which has won 22
consecutive matches since a loss to Corona del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Mater Dei 10, Placentia El Dorado 8--Kaes Van't Hof
defeated Sergiu Modoc, 6-3, to cap a three-set sweep at No. 2 singles
for Mater Dei (16-4), which upset El Dorado (19-3) in a Southern
Section Division II second-round match at El Dorado. Mater Dei's No.
3 team of John Plou and Wes Burrows also swept three sets, 6-3, 6-4,
6-3, to help the Monarchs win seven of nine in doubles.</TE>

<LD>Dorsey High's chances of winning its fifth City Section boys' track
and field title in seven years took a big hit in the section
preliminaries at Van Nuys Birmingham on Thursday when Jermaine
Rolison strained his left hamstring in a qualifying heat of the
110-meter high hurdles and Donald Wilson failed to advance in the
long jump and triple jump.</LD>
<LD>   Rolison, the fastest returning high hurdler in the state at the
start of the season, felt his hamstring "pop" after the second of 10
hurdles. He cleared three more hurdles before pulling up.</LD>
<LD>   Wilson was the defending champion in the triple jump and was
expected to contend for the long-jump title.</LD>
<TE>   Two-time defending champion Woodland Hills Taft and host
Birmingham should battle for the boys' title in the section
championships next Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Reseda Cleveland will be favored in the girls' meet with defending
champion Birmingham and Dorsey its top challengers.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Noah Smith of Taft had the fastest qualifying time in the
boys' 100 with a career-best 10.72 seconds and in the 200 with a
21.85 clocking, but did not run on the Toreadors' relay teams because
of a "twinge" in his right hamstring.</TE>

<HD>Selig Says Fail-Safe Point Approaching</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Commissioner envisions six to eight teams going
out of business soon if system isn't changed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the baseball players' union considers possible strike dates in
response to the absence of progress in the labor negotiations and the
possibility that owners could unilaterally implement new work rules
after the World Series, Commissioner Bud Selig said Thursday that six
to eight unnamed clubs could go out of business if the current
economic system is not changed.</LD>
<LD>   "I would say six to eight can't exist another year, another year
and a half. We're talking about the immediate future," Selig said
during a luncheon meeting with editors and reporters of The Times.
"There's a lot of clubs that simply can't survive the status quo."</LD>
<LD>   In continuing to paint a bleak economic picture if the competitive
and revenue disparities are not addressed, Selig also said that the
survival of those clubs hinges strictly on a change in the system
because he is through trying to "prop them up" on his own with loans
from baseball's central fund or his own financial connections.</LD>
<TE>   He described that as the one area in which he has received the
most internal criticism--from owners of more stable clubs and his own
staff.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm out of that business," he said. "The lines of credit those
clubs have will still exist, but most are out of credit. They're at
the max.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball has $4 billion of debt, the bankers are nervous and the
losses are very real. You know how serious the problem is when six to
eight clubs are for sale, including the Angels."</TE>
<TE>   At Dodger Stadium Thursday night, union leader Don Fehr said he
had never heard Selig claim six to eight clubs could go under if the
system isn't changed and refused to say whether he believed that or
not.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me the most important thing is negotiating [a
collective bargaining] agreement so those things don't have to be
considered," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fehr added he would be "willing to hire a neutral party to grade"
whether the union or the owners have been more aggressive in pursuit
of an agreement. He has said that the owners have been generally
unresponsive to any union proposals and that it is hard to determine
where they are headed or what their objective is.</TE>
<TE>   In the continuation of a media campaign aimed at explaining and
selling the owners' need for a new economic system, Selig was
accompanied Thursday by Rob Manfred and Sandy Alderson, his vice
presidents of labor relations and baseball operations, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   They said it is the union that has been unwilling to participate
in meaningful negotiations and that the owners "remain committed to a
moderate set of proposals" while avoiding "all this talk about a
strike and interruption of play."</TE>
<TE>   The two key components of their "moderate set of proposals" call
for a 50% tax on all payroll above $98 million and an increase in the
sharing of local revenue from 20% to 50%.</TE>
<TE>   The union considers the tax tantamount to a salary cap and
privately believes that the high revenue clubs that drive the market
would be restricted in the signing of top players if forced to share
50% of local revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Union sources wonder if the owners are geared to make another
attempt at breaking the union and are deluded into thinking fans will
come back if the game is shut down for the ninth time.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to make a deal without having to worry about the fans
coming back," Manfred said. "Everything we have done during this go
around has been calculated to get an agreement without an
interruption."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, said Selig, he can't worry if his image and leadership
take a public beating. He said he understands the "insanity" of a
prolonged stoppage but hasn't thought about it and can't worry about
it considering that the severity of the industry's problems is
increasing by the month.</TE>
<TE>   Although baseball revenue has doubled to almost $3.5 billion since
the work stoppage of 1994-95, Selig said there has been an increasing
loss of faith and hope in too many cities and that baseball's polling
amid a season in which attendance is down 5% indicates that fans want
it fixed.</TE>
<TE>   He cited National Football League parity and the booming increase
in NFL franchise values as indicative of what can happen in a
"reasoned economic system."</TE>
<TE>   "Am I supposed to sit and watch our situation deteriorate just to
preserve the status quo?" he asked. "Ten years from now people would
ask, 'Commissioner, what the hell were you thinking about?' I can't
ignore it. It's too stark. If we don't address it now, the
consequences will be even worse [than a possible shutdown]."</TE>
<TE>   The owners have pledged not to initiate a lockout or to attempt a
unilateral implementation during the season or postseason, but the
off-season is another matter. A late-season strike would provide the
union with a measure of leverage in the face of a possible
implementation by the owners and could establish a deadline under
which negotiations often improve.</TE>
<TE>   "A little saber rattling can motivate people, but we're not at the
point yet," Manfred said, "and this [talk of a strike date by the
union] only raises the profile at a time where I don't believe it was
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, when people start talking about a strike you have to be
concerned, but my experience over the years is that if someone is
getting close to setting a strike date, you would expect them to be
anxious about getting a lot of time in the negotiating room and I
have not sensed that anxiousness in terms of the union's scheduling."</TE>

<LD>In a result that definitely will have caught the attention of U.S.
Coach Bruce Arena, South Korea on Thursday overwhelmed Scotland, 4-1,
before a crowd of 48,000 in Pusan, South Korea, to extend its
unbeaten streak to six games.</LD>
<LD>   Ahn Jung-Hwan scored twice after coming on as a second-half
substitute, and Lee Chun-Soo and Yoon Jong-Hwan also scored against a
young and inexperienced Scotland side, whose coach, Berti Vogts, was
so displeased with the performance that he ordered his players back
onto the field for a training session immediately after the match.</LD>

several league teams.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Ronaldo, who did make Brazil's team, is rumored to be
on the way out at Inter Milan and heading back to his old club,
Barcelona, which has recalled former coach Louis Van Gaal and also is
said to be chasing Ukrainian striker Andriy Shevchenko from AC Milan.
It could a double deal, with Ronaldo coming to Barcelona and then

Argentina's qualifying matches after leading the country to the FIFA

<HD>Smashing Success</HD>
<DH>Mater Dei junior Daniel Perales showed his power as a
toddler and now he's one of the best players in Southland</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fathers don't usually celebrate after a child breaks a window ...
unless it's for a good cause.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Perales was 3 when he broke his first window. His father,
Danny, had been tossing the ball to him in the front yard.</LD>
<LD>   "I really didn't think he'd take hold of the ball like he did, and
he slammed a line drive into the window," Danny said. "I was shocked.
I said, 'Oh my God.'"</LD>
<TE>   Little Daniel thought he was going to be punished.</TE>
<TE>   "His eyes got real big like he was in trouble," Danny said. "I
told him, 'That's a heck of a hit.'"</TE>
<TE>   That window was fixed, and Perales kept hitting. These days, he's
sending balls over fences as a junior center fielder for Santa Ana
Mater Dei High. He has tied the school record of 12 home runs held by
Pat Manning, a 1999 third-round draft pick of the Atlanta Braves,
entering the Monarchs' Southern Section Division III playoff opener
today against visiting Bellflower.</TE>
<TE>   His coach, Burt Call, said Perales is "probably the best
outfielder in Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   That praise isn't offered solely because of Perales' hitting
skills. It's his all-around play that has scouts and coaches buzzing.
His strong arm and ability to run down fly balls have enhanced his
reputation as someone who could be a five-tool player.</TE>
<TE>   "Every game, he comes ready to go," Call said. "Every at-bat, he
concentrates. He's had a great year offensively and defensively and
saved games for us."</TE>
<TE>   All anyone needs to know about Perales' ability is what he
accomplished in a game against top-ranked La Puente Bishop Amat and
its ace pitcher, Adam Simon, last March.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who signed with UCLA, is considered the No. 1 pitcher in
Southern California. He struck out 13 and tossed a four-hitter to
beat Mater Dei, 5-2, in a game at Cal State Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Perales hit two home runs, one to right field and the other to
center.</TE>
<TE>   "That was incredible," Call said. "The ball just jumped off his
bat."</TE>
<TE>   Said Perales: "I came into the game with a lot of confidence. I
knew there was a lot of hype on [Simon]. It was just timing. I was
timing him in the batter's box."</TE>
<TE>   Perales, 5 feet 11 and 175 pounds, bats and throws from the left
side. He has always been a much sought-after talent, playing on many
youth all-star teams. Last summer, he was a starter for the U.S.
World Youth team that won a gold medal in Veracruz, Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   His slender frame doesn't resemble that of a typical power hitter,
but he generates so much bat speed that when he makes firm contact,
the ball almost explodes.</TE>
<TE>   In the off-season, Perales worked on strengthening his upper body,
back and chest muscles. He still looks skinny, making him a deceiving
power threat. This season, he's batting .392 with 28 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   It's his love for baseball and natural skills that have made
Perales the player he is.</TE>
<TE>   "I have fun," he said. "It makes me relax. It just feels like a
whole different world from the world of responsibility and work."</TE>
<TE>   Perales has benefited from having four loyal, loving adults in his
life. He lives with his mother, stepfather and two younger siblings
in Orange, but his father and stepmother remain influential
supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "He has two fathers that really care for him and two mothers who
care for him," Danny said.</TE>
<TE>   Danny, a Santa Ana police officer for more than 20 years, has been
the disciplinarian. Gina, Perales' mother, is a school teacher.</TE>
<TE>   "My parents raised me to be real respectful," said Perales, who
has a 3.4 grade-point average. "My dad's big thing was be humble,
down to earth, play within yourself and have fun. And that's what I
do, playing a game I've been playing my whole life. They try to warn

<HD>A Happy Anniversary</HD>
<DH>Tennis: A year ago, Corina Morariu learned she had
leukemia. She's in remission and feels like celebrating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tennis player Corina Morariu searched for the right word to describe
today, the first anniversary of the day her world was shaken, the day
she learned she had acute leukemia.</LD>
<LD>   "We're going to have a little celebration, I guess," said Morariu,
who was the world's top-ranked women's doubles player in 2000. "I
don't know if you want to call it a celebration. A
Corina's-still-around celebration. I just keep thinking back to what
was happening to me last year. All the different things I went
through, and the emotions are sort of creeping back."</LD>
<LD>   The more she thought about it, the more "celebration" sounded like
the best word.</LD>
<TE>   "It's been a really hard year. I've gone through a lot. A
celebration too, in looking forward," she said. "Looking at all the
positives, at all the things I've been able to overcome."</TE>
<TE>   Her father, Albin, is a doctor and was the personal neurologist of
Tim Gullikson, who died of brain cancer in 1996. Albin reflected on
his feelings of a year ago, walking into his daughter's hospital room
for the toughest moment of his life.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, probably the most difficult thing I had to do was tell
her the diagnosis," he said. "I just debated if I should tell her, or
should I have somebody else. Finally, I took the bull by the horns."
There was an outpouring of support for Morariu, one of the best-liked
players on the tour. One visitor recalled how brave Morariu was in
the most emotional moments, even making a gentle joke about losing
her hair from chemotherapy treatments.</TE>
<TE>   Morariu has been in remission, but she still must take oral
chemotherapy every day for the next two years. She turned 24 in
January and was able to hit tennis balls that month for about five
minutes the first time back on the court.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fun. But it was so hard for me, just physically," she
said. "It was an unusual feeling because I've played since I was 5
years old. When you do it so often, it becomes second nature. For me
to be struggling so much to be able to do that was difficult. At the
same time, it was exciting I was able to get out there and be
outside.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I'm enjoying seeing myself progress physically after what
I've been through and after what my body has been through, the state
I was in late November, early December. I got out of the hospital and
I couldn't walk 20 yards. Now I'm practicing four hours a day,
running on the treadmill, doing all these things I took for granted
before that I get excited about now."</TE>
<TE>   She plans to play World TeamTennis in July and could return to the
tour in Southern California later that month, starting with doubles.
Tennis can serve as a platform in her new ambition, raising awareness
of blood-related cancers. Morariu recently signed as international
sports ambassador for the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society.</TE>
<TE>   "I honestly feel that my particular kind of leukemia has a good
prognosis, and that's not the case with all kinds of leukemia," she
said. "The reason my prognosis is good is because there has been
money put into research, and people have done all this work for them
to develop a drug that works in my kind of leukemia.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I owe my life to the people that have done that,
given their time, their money and have tried to raise awareness. I'm
just trying to ... do everything I can to increase the prognosis for
every kind of leukemia, as well as eventually find a cure. That's
more important to me than playing."</TE>

<LD>The Lakers versus the Kings is the series everyone has been waiting
for and it could be the playoff matchup that validates the Lakers as
one of the NBA's great dynasties.</LD>
<LD>   Sacramento will have home-court advantage in the series but that
may not mean much considering that the last time the Lakers lost a
road playoff game, Larry Bird was still coaching the Indiana Pacers
and A.C. Green was the Lakers' starting power forward.</LD>
<LD>   If it comes down to coaching, give the Lakers an edge.</LD>
<TE>   Sacramento's Rick Adelman does not have a great track record of
getting the most out of his teams in pressure playoff series, while
Laker Coach Phil Jackson seems to live for matchups like this,
cowbells and all.</TE>
<TE>   The last two seasons, the Lakers handled the Kings in the playoffs
with ease but they had a healthy Shaquille O'Neal, who dominated
Sacramento inside. O'Neal will not be 100% but the extra rest he has
had this week will help his nagging ankle injuries and that may prove
to be the difference between the teams.</TE>
<TE>   Because both teams are so familiar with each other's talents, this
series probably will be decided by whichever one executes the best. A
breakdown of Game 1:</TE>
<TE>   LAKERS' MOVE--After dealing with San Antonio's Tim Duncan for five
games, the Lakers will face an entirely different challenge against
Sacramento, the best passing team in the NBA. The Lakers' legs will
be tested against the up-tempo Kings because they are not as young as
they used to be. It also doesn't help that the Lakers have played
more games than any team in the league over the last three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Against the Spurs, the Lakers did not have to worry too much about
defending their outside shooting, but that will not be the case
against the Kings. The Laker perimeter players not only will have to
contest Sacramento's three-point shooters but they also will have to
help out rebounding. Long shots usually mean long rebounds, so look
for Kobe Bryant, Rick Fox and Derek Fisher to grab plenty of boards.</TE>
<TE>   When the Lakers go inside to O'Neal, he can't afford to get
frustrated with the Kings' flopping. Vlade Divac, Scot Pollard and
Chris Webber will try to get the Laker big man into foul trouble by
dropping to the floor at the slightest touch. But the Lakers can take
advantage of this tactic with ball movement and backdoor cuts to the
basket.</TE>
<TE>   KINGS' MOVE--One edge Sacramento figures to have over the Lakers
will be the backcourt tandem of Mike Bibby and Bobby Jackson. The
Lakers had some trouble when the Spurs went with guards Tony Parker
and Antonio Daniels, and Bibby and Jackson are much better offensive
players.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings can't get caught up playing the Lakers' tempo. They have
to force the play and have their big men run the floor.</TE>
<TE>   If Adelman can force Jackson to give heavy minutes to guards Brian
Shaw and Lindsey Hunter along with swingman Devean George, Sacramento
should have an advantage because of its better depth.</TE>
<TE>   In the second round, the Kings did a great job of spreading out
the Dallas Maverick defense.</TE>
<TE>   They will look to do the same thing against the Lakers, who may
have trouble slowing down the Kings' screen-and-roll plays. Webber is
a master at this because of his ability to drive to the basket and
shoot from the outside.</TE>
<TE>   KEY POINTS--Doug Christie of Sacramento is a solid defender with
long arms, but Bryant has had success against him. Although Bryant's
perimeter shot has been a little shaky during the playoffs, his
ability to penetrate and get off mid-range jumpers is always
effective.</TE>
<TE>   It will be important for Christie to make Bryant work on defense.
The Spurs' Bruce Bowen did a decent job on the Laker swingman, but
his weak offense allowed Bryant to float on defense. Christie has to
be aggressive on offense and not settle for perimeter shots.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento's Hedo Turkoglu will be Sacramento's X factor. With
Peja Stojakovic sidelined because of an ankle injury, Turkoglu
probably will be matched up against Fox, a crafty defender. Like
Christie, Turkoglu has to play aggressively but his biggest challenge
will be on the defensive end.</TE>

<HD>Questionable Move by Patrick</HD>

<LD>Dan Patrick drew mostly rave reviews when he was the anchor on ESPN's
"SportsCenter." And not for just putting up with Keith Olbermann.</LD>
<LD>   Since he began doing a daily show for ESPN Radio in September
1999, he has drawn more rave reviews, in this space and elsewhere,
particularly for his interviewing skills.</LD>
<LD>   Patrick, who is heard on KSPN (1110) in Los Angeles, always seems
to get his guests to open up. On the national level, he and Jim Rome
may be the best interviewers in sports-talk radio.</LD>
<TE>   Jose Canseco was a guest on Patrick's show Tuesday, a day after
announcing that he was retiring from baseball at 37. Canseco had been
playing for the Chicago White Sox's triple-A club in Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Canseco told Patrick he was going to write a tell-all book.
Canseco said he was going to name players who use steroids and
players who have had extramarital affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Canseco also said he had heard from Alex Rodriguez and other
players that he had been blackballed from baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick probed further, but Canseco kept saying, "It will all be
in the book."</TE>
<TE>   The interview then took an unusual turn, particularly considering
Patrick's journalistic savvy. We're not talking about Arnie Spanier
here.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick, going beyond the role of an objective interviewer, began
trying to talk Canseco out of writing the book. Regular partner Rob
Dibble, a former baseball player, supported Patrick's stand, as did
frequent guest host Sean Salisbury, a former football player.</TE>
<TE>   "Why write this?" Patrick asked. "Why write that story?"</TE>
<TE>   Canseco said he wanted to write the truth, something generally
respected by journalists.</TE>
<TE>   "Why hurt those people if they didn't hurt you?" Patrick asked.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick even offered to be a sounding board, telling Canseco he
would read the book before it was published, then tell Canseco what
he thought.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to interject my opinion, my emotion," Patrick said
later, off the air by phone. "This was live, unscripted radio. I was
also trying to find out how serious he was about writing the book, as
well as let him know what this tell-all book would do to him if he
ever wanted to get back into baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm guilty of having a conscious, then lock me up."</TE>
<TE>   Patrick said his style is to bond with the people he interviews.</TE>
<TE>   "I use that to my advantage," he said. "If they trust me, they'll
usually open up. If you think I stepped out of bounds by offering to
be a sounding board, then OK, I'm guilty. But I'll always stand by
the way I conduct an interview."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Canseco was a guest of Chris Myers and Bob Golic on
KMPC (1540), and said many of the same things he said to Patrick.
Myers said he pointed out the repercussions of writing such a book
but didn't try to talk Canseco out of it.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not my place," Myers said. "Maybe off the air, but not on
the air."</TE>
<TE>   Where's Marv?</TE>
<TE>   Game 1 of the NBA Western Conference finals between the Lakers and
Sacramento Kings will be on NBC Saturday at 3:30 p.m., immediately
following the Preakness.</TE>
<TE>   The announcers will be Mike Breen, Steve "Snapper" Jones and Bill
Walton.</TE>
<TE>   Marv Albert will take the day off to attend the wedding of his
oldest daughter, Jackie.</TE>
<TE>   Albert will then work with P.J. Carlesimo on Game 1 of the Eastern
Conference finals between Boston and New Jersey at 2:30 p.m. Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   NBC will have its NBA pregame show Saturday at 1:30 p.m., before
the Preakness.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, NBC will have a special one-hour pregame show at 1:30
to preview the draft lottery, which will be televised at halftime of
the Celtic-Net game.</TE>
<TE>   The final game of the Laker-San Antonio series Tuesday night on
Fox Sports Net got a 13.2 rating, believed to be the highest for a
Laker cable telecast.</TE>
<TE>   Where's Stuart?</TE>
<TE>   ESPN's Stuart Scott has been off the air since suffering an eye
injury while doing a first-hand report on the New York Jets'
mini-camp April 3. He was hit in the eye by a ball while trying to
catch a pass.</TE>
<TE>   Scott was among the ESPN announcers playing in Salisbury's recent
charity golf tournament in Del Mar and said the eye is slowly getting
back to normal. Part of the cornea had to be reattached and he still
has some vision problems.</TE>
<TE>   An ESPN spokesman said there is no timetable for Scott's return.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of Salisbury, word is, the former USC quarterback who
lives near ESPN in Bristol, Conn., will soon become a regular on
Patrick's show, along with Dibble. Salisbury's duties with ESPN and
ESPN2 will not change.</TE>
<TE>   Oops Department</TE>
<TE>   If you were watching the end of Game 5 of the San Jose-Colorado
NHL series Saturday, the Sharks were leading, 4-3, with 20.5 seconds
left when ABC suddenly switched to Detroit-St. Louis, which had
already ended.</TE>
<TE>   The Sharks scored an empty-net goal before ABC switched back with
2.5 seconds left. An ABC spokesman said it was simply a switching
mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Golf, Anyone?</TE>
<TE>   Pam Shriver, who in the 1980s was ranked No. 1 as a doubles tennis
player and among the top singles players, will be inducted into the
International Tennis Hall of Fame this summer. Now a tennis
commentator for ESPN, she is regarded as one of the best in the
business.</TE>
<TE>   Shriver will be honored Monday at the third Los Angeles Sports and
Entertainment Commission Celebrity Golf and Tennis Classic at Riviera
Country Club. She will play in the tennis part of the event.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll be hard for me to resist going out on the golf course," she
said. "The last time I played Riviera, I shot a 75."</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Todd Donoho, whose contract with Fox Sports Net is not being
renewed, will be leaving the regional sports network July 1. He might
end up back at Channel 7, where he once worked, although in a reduced
role. "He could have a role on 'Monday Night Live,' but probably not
as the main host," said Channel 7's general manager, Arnie Kleiner.
Bill Weir, who has been serving as the host of "Monday Night Live,"
is leaving the station.... Beginning Monday and lasting as long as
the Lakers remain in the NBA playoffs, Donoho will co-host a 1-3 p.m.
show on KSPN with Dave Stone.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net has hired Caroline Hughes, hostess of a popular
morning show on the ABC affiliate in El Paso, Texas, as a reporter
and anchor for the "Southern California Sports Report." Hughes used
to be on the production staff for Fox Sports Net's "Goin' Deep" and
started her career at Channel 9.... Fox Sports Net's Paul Sunderland
returned to work Thursday after taking some time off after the death
of his mother, Beryl Barone, 83, Monday. Barone, who lived in Malibu
the last 40 years, died within a week after learning she had acute
leukemia.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Frazier, a mainstay at Fox Sports Net in recent years, is
said to be leaving the network. His contract expires July 1, and he
could be headed for ESPN.... James Brown reported on the Sporting
News radio network (KMPC in L.A.) that Cris Carter would retire from
the Minnesota Vikings and join HBO's "Inside the NFL." An HBO
spokesman did not deny the report.</TE>
<TE>   Radio shows: An excellent golf show, "Tee It Up," is on KXTA
(1150) Saturdays 7-8 a.m. On the show are golf historian Kevin Smith,
golf instructor Bob Cisco, former caddie Evan Green, and Al
Gottfried, a sales account executive for the station. The show is
produced by Gottfried's 22-year-old son Adam, who has his own
production company, called Fourteenth Colony Productions.... Karch
Kiraly and Sinjin Smith will co-host a new weekly show, "The AVP
Hour," on KMPC Thursdays, 7-8 p.m., beginning next week.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Bruised in a Cruise</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Americans brush aside Jamaica, 5-0, in a World Cup
tuneup, but three players suffer minor injuries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Some victories come at a high cost--just ask Chris Armas--and the
United States almost had to foot the bill once again on Thursday
night.</LD>
<LD>   Continuing its preparatory march toward the World Cup, the
American team easily brushed aside Jamaica, beating the Reggae Boyz,
5-0, in front of 30,659 fans at Giants Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Far more important than the result, however, was the cost of the
victory. Or at least what it might have cost had things turned out
any worse. A brief accounting:</LD>
<TE>   * Defender Greg Vanney left at the end of the first half after
spraining his right knee.</TE>
<TE>   * Goalkeeper Kasey Keller limped off after 53 minutes with a badly
bruised left knee sustained in a collision with Jamaican forward Deon
Burton.</TE>
<TE>   * Striker Clint Mathis played less than 18 minutes as a
second-half substitute before injuring the big toe on his right foot.
He later had half the nail cut off.</TE>
<TE>   Each injury brought to mind Sunday, when the luckless Armas tore
the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee during a 2-1 victory
over Uruguay in Washington, D.C. The injury knocked the Chicago Fire
midfielder out of the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Arena, the U.S. coach, dismissed the latest batch of
injuries as nothing serious.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think there's anything severe there," he said. "Keller's
is a bruised knee, Mathis just got stepped on, and Vanney has a
slight sprain."</TE>
<TE>   The loss of any of the players would have been a serious blow to
the U.S. Keller, for instance, is battling Brad Friedel for the
starting job in goal. As it is, when he came off it gave No. 3 keeper
Tony Meola the chance to earn his 99th cap for the national team.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I could shake it off, but it wasn't going to happen so
I thought I'd get some ice on it as quickly as possible," Keller said
of the injury he incurred when he and Burton went for the ball and
smacked into each other. "If it had been a World Cup game, I don't
know if I would have come off.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't feel very good right now, but I'll keep my fingers
crossed. It could just be a little bone bruise. We'll see how it
feels tomorrow and go from there."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. controlled the game throughout, playing at a fast pace
and keeping Jamaica off balance. Arena started only one of the
players (Earnie Stewart) who had started against Uruguay and ended up
using 18 in all.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Wolff scored the first of his two goals in the 32nd minute to
give the U.S. a 1-0 lead at the half. Mathis was one of four
substitutes used by Arena in the second 45 minutes and it took him
only 1:47 to score his sixth goal.</TE>
<TE>   Wolff added another in the 60th minute, and it was left to
youngsters Landon Donovan and DaMarcus Beasley to complete the
scoring in the final six minutes, with Eddie Lewis assisting on both
goals.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I think we played well tonight," said Arena, who
overtook Bora Milutinovic and became the all-time leader in coaching
victories for the U.S. with 31.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our fitness level showed. The first half of the game was
played at a pretty high pace and I think we wore them out a little
bit."</TE>
<TE>   In the second game of the doubleheader, the New York/New Jersey
MetroStars tied AC Milan of Italy, 1-1, with Jose Mari Romero-Poyon
scoring for the Italian club and Tab Ramos tying it for the
MetroStars.</TE>

<BD>SACRAMENTO BEE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>And now a quick word about respect: Nope.</LD>
<LD>   On some levels, this Western Conference final between the Kings
and the Lakers is being touted as a quest for respect. It's a great
word, respect.</LD>
<LD>   You can throw it out there without actually saying what you mean,
and people will take it for whatever they will.</LD>
<TE>   Respect on the court? From the officials? In the mirror? From
Randy Newman?</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear. Still, the Kings want some respect from the Lakers,
and Sacramento seems to want some collective respect from Los
Angeles, and there is no question that all of that will come to pass.</TE>
<TE>   At precisely the same moment Pamela Anderson moves to Elk Grove.</TE>
<TE>   Not to burst any implants here, but there can't be a worse thing
to play for against L.A. than respect. If the Lakers had any respect
for the Kings, then a guy like Samaki Walker wouldn't be saying
things like, "This team has been known to fold."</TE>
<TE>   Who is Samaki Walker, you ask?</TE>
<TE>   Exactly.</TE>
<TE>   And we're just getting warmed up. The Kings over the past couple
of years have either been disrespected by the Lakers or pretty much
ignored altogether, and it's hard to decide which is the deeper cut.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento, the place? It almost never gets insulted by anyone
from L.A. It is hard, after all, to insult a place that never crosses
your mind.</TE>
<TE>   From some people you will hear that this series could change all
that, that this is the year the Kings earn their due from the Lakers
and, by extension, Sacramento from L.A.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing this series can change is the Kings' destiny as a
franchise, and for some strange reason we keep insisting that ought
to be enough.</TE>
<TE>   Forget respect from the Lakers; it ain't gonna happen. A year ago,
after his team swept Sacramento out of the second round, Shaquille
O'Neal memorably opined that the Kings were headed "back to the
expansionism," a destination that, happily, turned out to contain 61
victories during the next regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Part of what makes L.A. the franchise it is is an overwhelming
self-involvement. If you're the Lakers of Kobe and Shaq, it is all
about you all of the time. People around the Kings may want to
declare a rivalry, but to the Lakers, no disrespect, the Kings are
mostly just the team standing in the way.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento was the gnat on the shoulder of the Lakers for the past
two years, and there's nothing wrong with that. The Kings were still
building something that L.A., in large measure, already had finished.</TE>
<TE>   That the sense of inequality was significantly removed this
season, when the Kings got better and the Lakers didn't, doesn't mean
L.A. is suddenly showering the love. All Narcissus ever saw, after
all, was his own reflection.</TE>
<TE>   It's how winning franchises think.</TE>

<HD>Arafat Sets Timetable for Vote, Agrees to Overhaul</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Under pressure, the Palestinian leader promises
elections for president and parliament this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ and MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Bowing to intense pressure at home and abroad to reform his
government, Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat agreed
Thursday to revamp his Cabinet and hold presidential and
parliamentary elections within six months.</LD>
<LD>   Arafat's decision followed a sustained chorus of calls from his
people, world leaders and his arch-nemesis, Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon, to enact broad political reforms or be marginalized.
The Palestinian administration is widely perceived as being rife with
corruption.</LD>
<LD>   Some Palestinians, who have seen Arafat fail to deliver on
previous promises of reform, greeted the election announcement with
cautious optimism.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the best news the Palestinian people have received in
months, but it's [just] one step in the right direction," said Nabil
Amr, who recently resigned as the Palestinian Authority's minister
for parliamentary affairs to protest what he said was Arafat's
resistance to reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Many Palestinians saw their neighborhoods ripped apart during
Israel's recent six-week military offensive in the West Bank. Israel
attacked Palestinian militants after a suicide bomber killed more
than two dozen Jews in a crowded seaside hotel March 27 during a
ritual meal ushering in the Passover holiday.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview published Thursday, Sharon called on world leaders
to relegate Arafat to a ceremonial role and "force" on the
Palestinian people an interim government that would carry out
reforms. Israeli leaders maintain that the Palestinian Authority
supports and funds attacks against Israeli citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "There is still no concerted position about how to reform the
Palestinian Authority," Sharon said in the interview with Yediot
Aharonot, Israel's largest daily newspaper. "One thing is clear, and
that is, if Arafat carries it out, nothing will happen."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Military Reenters Jenin</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, witnesses reported early today that Israeli tanks and
soldiers reentered the Jenin refugee camp, scene of the heaviest
fighting during Israel's recent offensive. An army spokeswoman
described it as a "pinpoint operation." She added: "Arrests have been
made. When we are done, we will get out."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's remarks came after Arafat on Wednesday pledged to
Palestinian legislators that he would adopt unspecified reforms.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian leader's surprise announcement Thursday of an
election timetable showed that Arafat had succumbed to growing
domestic pressure to hold a vote despite the possibility that his
popularity among Palestinians may be waning.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Thursday, Palestinian legislators demanded that Arafat
trim his 30-member Cabinet to 19 people in less than seven weeks and
hold parliamentary and presidential elections by the beginning of
2003. They also called on him to streamline the Palestinian
Authority's ragtag security services.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the authentic, Palestinian home-grown program of reform:
structural, legal, procedural, personal," said legislator Hanan
Ashrawi, in apparent reference to international pressures to revamp
the government.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Arafat received the legislators' list of demands,
his advisor, Ahmed Abdel Rahman, announced in the West Bank city of
Ramallah that the Palestinian president had approved the package.</TE>
<TE>   "The core of the changes will be conducting general elections in a
period that will not exceed four to six months," Rahman said, adding
that Arafat has called for a meeting of his administration's election
body within two days.</TE>
<TE>   Amr, the former parliamentary affairs minister, called on
President Bush and other world leaders to pressure Sharon to lift
blockades of Palestinian towns and villages so that prospective
candidates could campaign effectively.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon showed no immediate signs Thursday of easing up the
pressure on Palestinians. Israeli tanks rolled into Beitunia, a
suburb of Ramallah, killing a member of Arafat's security forces. The
military said 25-year-old Ahmed Ghanam was planning to help carry out
a terrorist attack in nearby Jerusalem. About two dozen Palestinians
were arrested in other Israeli army raids near Nablus and other
areas, which Sharon said would continue until militants were
uprooted.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Arafat's challenge will be to enact enough reform
measures to blunt internal and external pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Elections May Put Pressure on Sharon</TE>
<TE>   But the run-up to Palestinian elections also could put Sharon
under pressure to pull Israeli troops out of the West Bank, end the
controls exerted over East Jerusalem and dismantle the many
checkpoints throughout the West Bank that restrict people from
moving--and voting.</TE>
<TE>   "Sharon either has to put up with this election or face up to the
world," said Ali Jirbawi, a political scientist with the West Bank's
Bir Zeit University.</TE>
<TE>   The elections, if held, would present Arafat with the most serious
challenge yet to his near-absolute rule. The last Palestinian
elections were held in 1996, and Arafat won with 88% of the vote. At
that time, however, there was greater optimism among Palestinians in
the wake of the 1993 Oslo peace accords. This time voters would
probably be far less hopeful, Jirbawi said.</TE>
<TE>   There would be many variables in the coming elections, including
what kind of rules apply and whether radical factions such as Hamas
and Islamic Jihad participate.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki said Arafat's performance at
the polls could strengthen his hand in the peace process. A strong
showing would give him a mandate in any future peace talks with
Israel, he said.</TE>

<LD>IRS audits--A story in Thursday's business section incorrectly stated
that the IRS reviews the books of all companies with assets of $250
million or more, but only audits about one-third of them. The story
should have stated that the IRS reviews the income tax returns of all
companies with assets of $10 million or more to determine whether
they require auditing. The IRS last year audited about one-third of
the companies with assets of $250 million or more.</LD>
