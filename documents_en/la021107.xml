<LD>Had you lived in Pasadena in 1889, you could have witnessed the
arrival of the first telescope atop the summit of Mt. Wilson. Imagine
how long it must have taken to build a trail to reach the top of the
mountain so the telescope could be put in place. Or what it was like
to see the universe in the Victorian era? Or better yet, how
astronomy was taught over 100 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Well you don't have to use your imagination because the Pasadena
Museum of History is presenting "Pasadena Looks at the Universe"
through Dec. 1.</LD>
<LD>   The exhibition begins with a look at how astronomy was taught in
the 1890s and concludes with today's discoveries made possible by the
Hubble Telescope and the Palomar and Keck Observatories. Children and
adults can enjoy hands-on learning activities via computers, solar
puzzles, worksheets, and more. You can even assemble your own alien!
The museum is also open on special nights so you can see the stars
with on-site telescopes.</LD>
<TE>   "Pasadena Looks at the Universe" is being presented in partnership
with Caltech, Carnegie Observatories, the Pasadena Civic Center, the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Mt. Wilson Institute.</TE>
<TE>   For more information, call (626) 577-1660 or visit

<HD>'The Flag Is for Everyone'</HD>
<DH>The story so far: A discussion is taking place in Mrs.
Vickroy's class about whether the United States should go to war with
Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Marjorie Flathers</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everyone in the class said they were worried about war, especially if
it came to America.</LD>
<LD>   "I know the news these days can scare you," Mrs. Vickroy said. She
pulled the wall map down in front of the chalkboard. "Here is the
United States." She pointed at the map. "And here is Iraq. Look, it's
about the size of the state of Texas, and it's very far away.
Sometimes things on TV seem like they are much larger and closer than
they are."</LD>
<LD>   "Like I said, USA rules!" Marshall repeated.</LD>
<TE>   "Right on!" Ashley agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "However," Mrs. Vickroy continued, "no one can be positive
something won't happen in this country. It is a confusing and
upsetting time for adults too, but one thing is sure. Every adult,
whether it's your parents or your teachers or someone else, will do
their best to keep you safe. Remember that when you can't sleep at
night."</TE>
<TE>   "Why do people start wars, anyway?" Marisol asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, think about your own lives for a moment. Do you ever get
into arguments or fights?"</TE>
<TE>   All the heads in the class nodded "yes."</TE>
<TE>   "I had a fight with Adam yesterday, but he started it," Marshall
said.</TE>
<TE>   "You said I was a wimpy soccer player because I missed that goal!"
Adam shot back. "I hit you because I'm a good soccer player and that
made me mad!"</TE>
<TE>   "No, you're not! We lost the game, wimp!" Marshall shouted.</TE>
<TE>   "You better take that back!" Adam got up from his desk.</TE>
<TE>   "That's enough," Mrs. Vickroy said, walking between the two boys.
"Do you see, class? This is how conflicts can get started. For you,
it can be about things as simple as soccer games, but for countries,
it's over much more serious things."</TE>
<TE>   Tomorrow: How will the discussion end?</TE>

<HD>'8 Mile' soundtrack tops chart</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Hilburn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a familiar name at the top of the national album sales chart
again this week: Eminem.</LD>
<LD>   The explosive rapper, who already has spent six weeks at No. 1
this year with his "The Eminem Show" album, reentered the chart at
No. 1 Wednesday as part of the soundtrack for his upcoming film, "8
Mile."</LD>
<LD>   The album sold 702,000 copies during its first week in the stores,
according to Nielsen SoundScan. That's far fewer than the 1.3 million
copies that "Show" sold during its first week in May, but it's the
fifth-highest single-week total of the year, and very impressive for
a soundtrack package.</LD>
<TE>   Eminem is featured on four tracks on the album, which includes
music "from and inspired by" the film, which opens Friday. The movie
is a stark, loosely biographical tale of a young man, played by
Eminem, struggling against his insecurities and harsh surroundings to
become a rap star.</TE>
<TE>   "The Eminem Show," with total sales nearing 6.5 million, ranks No.
8 this week.</TE>
<TE>   It was a strong week for new arrivals on the chart. Christina
Aguilera's "Stripped" finished No. 2 with sales of 330,000, while a
Nirvana greatest-hits package finished No. 3 with sales of 234,000.</TE>
<TE>   Other Top 10 arrivals this week: Rascal Flatts and Tori Amos at
No. 5 and No. 7, respectively. On the singles front, Madonna's "Die
Another Day" remains No. 1.</TE>

<HD>Artists step up for a cause</HD>
<DH>A rock-solid Lucinda Williams anchors 5-hour benefit for
women's issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Appleford</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Great things come from good intentions, which was true enough in the
music Tuesday at the Wiltern for a benefit for the Step-Up Women's
Network, with a lineup headed by Lucinda Williams and a powerful cast
of singer-songwriters.</LD>
<LD>   But the five-hour concert was no dry exercise in philanthropy. It
was instead marked by sometimes stripped down but always worthwhile
sets by Williams, Joe Henry, Neil Finn, Aimee Mann, John Doe and
newcomer Rosey -- or what Finn called "amazing people for a good
cause."</LD>
<LD>   That cause includes research into breast cancer, education
programs for girls and an end to violence against women.</LD>
<TE>   "It's important for people to get outside of themselves, to
realize there's a world out there and we're all connected," Williams
said backstage before her set. "Artists have a responsibility, is the
way I look at it."</TE>
<TE>   The night also made for a powerful, if unplanned statement on the
health of a certain blend of musical depth and grace, represented by
soaring melodies and thoughtful, challenging lyrics, ending with a
preview of songs from Williams' album-in-progress.</TE>
<TE>   In leather jeans and a black Harley-Davidson T-shirt, Williams led
her band through a tough, bristling folk-rock set with a Rolling
Stones vibe. There were words of longing and passionate reminiscence
on "Those Three Days" and "World Without Tears," before the explosive
"Real Live Bleeding Fingers and Broken Guitar Strings," a set-closing
rocker that she said was inspired by Paul Westerberg of the
Replacements.</TE>
<TE>   For his set, Finn was joined by Jon Brion on toy piano and other
diminutive keyboards, adding festive melodies to Finn's already
elegant pop. Mann re-created her own moving, hooked-filled rock, as
crisp and precise at the Wiltern as on her recordings. Focused and at
ease behind the microphone, she performed strong and deeply
vulnerable songs from the soundtrack to "Magnolia" and her newest
album, "Humpty Dumpty."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Henry played the moody, atmospheric songs of his recent,
career-defining albums, as a kind of noir Dylan with a jazz fixation.
John Doe performed acoustic, almost jazzy takes on songs from his new
solo album, "Dim Stars Bright Sky," joined by Grant-Lee Phillips on
the song "This Town." And Rosey's short set was both sultry and
charismatic, suggesting yet another generation of curious musical
minds.</TE>

<LD>   Eminem's art mirrors his life</LD>
<LD>   Eminem lays down a dramatic beat in Curtis Hanson's hip-hopera "8
Mile." The former Marshall Mathers steps into the role of an aspiring
rapper in mid-'90s Detroit, following a path not unlike his own,
working a dead-end job by day and throwing down rhymes in the city's
clubs by night. Kim Basinger, Brittany Murphy and Mekhi Phifer
co-star.</LD>

and drug use, opens Friday in general release.</TE>

<TE>   Filling the  lo-fi void</TE>
<TE>   Badly Drawn and Moldy don't sound like alluring qualities, but
fans of Damon Gough and Adam Green know better. English
singer-songwriter Gough, of course, is Badly Drawn Boy, who collected
a cult following with his intimate, winsome debut and the "About a
Boy" soundtrack and who has gone bigger and louder on his new album,
"Have You Fed the Fish?" Filling that lo-fi void at the Wiltern will
be second-billed Adam Green, whose old band the Moldy Peaches was the
critics' oddball pick and whose new album, "Garfield," carries on the
minimalist-eccentric tradition.</TE>
<TE>   Badly Drawn Boy, with Adam Green, Wiltern, 3790 Wilshire Blvd.,

serious Noh drama is devoted in large part to the inner lives of
ghosts, Kyogen theater is a form of comic drama that deals with
everyday life. The two are traditionally performed alternately on the
same program and share a common heritage. "Miracles and Mischief: Noh
and Kyogen Theater in Japan," opening Sunday at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art, introduces Los Angeles to the performance art
forms through their famous carved wooden masks, elaborate woven and
embellished costumes, lacquered musical instruments and painted
screens and hand scrolls.</TE>
<TE>   "Miracles and Mischief: Noh and Kyogen Theater in Japan," Los
Angeles County Museum of Art, 5905 Wilshire Blvd., L.A. Ends Feb. 2.
Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, noon to 8 p.m.; Fridays, noon to 9
p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.; $7; students and
seniors, $5; children and younger students, $1; children 5 and
younger, free. (323) 857-6000.</TE>

<TE>   Far from Sirk's style</TE>
<TE>   The bright colors and stylized costumes of "Far From Heaven" belie
secrets and conflicts unlike anything in the 1950s Douglas Sirk
melodramas on which it is modeled. Writer-director Todd Haynes, indie
producer Christine Vachon and star Julianne Moore, who collaborated
on the 1995 critics' favorite, "Safe," team up again on this ode to
the "women's films" of the studio-system era. Dennis Quaid, Dennis
Haysbert, Patricia Clarkson and Viola Davis also star.</TE>
<TE>   "Far From Heaven," rated PG-13 for mature thematic elements,
sexual content, brief violence and language, opens Friday in selected

<LD>THEATER</LD>
<LD>   'Violet Hour' at SCR</LD>
<LD>   When Richard Greenberg, the most prolific in South Coast
Repertory's stable of acclaimed contemporary playwrights, heard that
the theater was building a new stage, he volunteered to write the
first play produced there. Hence "The Violet Hour," which traces a
fateful afternoon and early evening in 1919 Manhattan. Fledgling
publisher John Pace Seavering has enough capital to put out one book.
But he has two on his desk: his best buddy's novel, and his
songstress lover's memoir. Both authors insist that their fates
depend on his decision.</LD>
<TE>   "The Violet Hour," South Coast Repertory's Julianne Argyros Stage,
655 Town Center Dr., Costa Mesa. Tuesdays-Fridays, 7:45 p.m.
Saturdays-Sundays, 2 p.m. and 7:45 p.m. Preview Thursday, Nov. 7,
opens Friday. Ends Nov. 24. $19-$54, with a pay-what-you-will show

<DL></DL>
<LD>Eight p.m. is apparently too early for celebrities.</LD>
<LD>   It is the much ballyhooed VIP opening for the paintings of Rolling
Stone Ronnie Wood, and outside Hamilton-Selway Fine Art on Melrose a
flock of paparazzi is going hungry. They've been here three hours
now, pushing and shoving in the chill night air, vying hard for a
coveted view of a lamentably unpopulated red carpet. There are a few
people inside, watching the door and looking at each other rather
than the art and parading their much-sought-after "Ronnie Wood VIP"
laminates like war medals, hard won and gleaming. None of them appear
to be famous.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, at around 9 p.m. there is suddenly a blinding barrage of
flashbulbs, which accompany the arrival of the venerable Rod Stewart,
caramel haired, perfectly tanned and trailed by a towering blond. He
is quickly followed by Tim Allen and someone who looks a lot like
Jack Nicholson, but isn't. The party has finally begun. Now that the
electric buzz of rock star charisma is coursing it's way through the
room, attention finally begins to settle on the large number of oils,
lithographs and etchings that line the gallery walls.</LD>
<TE>   Ronnie Wood is not your typical Sunday painter. He's had formal
training, working for a short time as a commercial artist in his 20s
before the seduction of girls and guitars. His paintings show a solid
technical ability and an ease with the medium that comes from nearly
47 years (Wood has been painting proficiently since the age of 13) at
the easel.</TE>
<TE>   "I can paint," says Wood in a phone interview earlier in the
afternoon, "so if they don't like it, I can say, 'OK, you don't like
it' and not feel too badly. But I don't get much of that, fingers
crossed."</TE>
<TE>   Wood's work, most of which is simply and clearly expressed, is
accessible and energetic and infused with the kind of sensibility
that comes from creating art from easy pleasure rather than inner
struggle. Wood, plainly put, just likes to paint.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike the music, it's a solo effort, no one else to blame. But
then again, no one else gets the satisfaction out of it," says Wood
of his work. "There's no kind of therapy like what you get from
starting and seeing a picture through. Over the years you're never
quite satisfied, and like the music you're always learning and trying
out new techniques. But that's the beauty of art. It's a lovely form
of expression."</TE>
<TE>   Working primarily in portraiture, Wood obeys the age-old adage of
"paint what you know" and most of his broad, bright canvases are
populated by famous friends and bandmates. Bob Dylan plays his guitar
in a wash of vibrant strokes. The Who's infamous drummer, Keith Moon,
peers out impishly from a nicely composed sketch. There is Keith
rehearsing, Charlie in the studio, Mick with lips pursed into his
trademark pout.</TE>
<TE>   The piece that seems to be getting the most attention on this
night, however, is a large oil of Muhammad Ali. The boxing great is
rendered large and imposing, looming victorious over a fallen foe,
who rests (save for a knee) just out of frame. It has been just
announced that Ali himself will sign the painting. Wood's paintings
range from $25,000 to $200,000, while some limited edition prints can
be had for $300.</TE>
<TE>   The champagne is flowing. Stewart strolls through the gallery, in
yellow silk tie and pinstripe, playing the perfect British dandy.
Alicia Silverstone stands in a corner looking hard at a triptych of
Eric Clapton, Keith Richards and Jimi Hendrix. Allen chortles by the
hors d'oeuvres. Just before 10 another blinding flash of bulbs
announces, at long last, the arrival of the man of the hour, who
bounces into the room, tiny, midnight haired and brimming with
uncontained excitement. The room erupts in wild applause. Ronnie Wood
smiles happily.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you! Thank you so much everyone!" he shouts. "Bugger off!"
comes a voice from the back. Heads turn. It's Stewart, grinning
madly, "They're too damn expensive."</TE>

<HD>A party with strings attached</HD>
<DH>Stars come out to turn Guitar Nights' fifth anniversary
into a special evening.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Pisano's Guitar Nights have been among the Southland's most
consistently entertaining musical experiences. An intimate acoustic
setting; a different, gifted guest artist every week, working in
tandem with the estimable accompaniment (and soloing) of Pisano: No
wonder the programs have continued to draw capacity crowds.</LD>
<LD>   The Guitar Nights have moved through a variety of locations over
the past few years. And on Tuesday night, in the elegant environs of
their current home -- Spazio in Sherman Oaks -- Pisano celebrated the
program's fifth anniversary with an all-star assemblage of jazz
guitarists. Most were onstage at one point or another, but the packed
house was also sprinkled with other guitarists -- Kenny Burrell, for
one -- who simply showed up to share a very special evening with
their fellow instrumentalists.</LD>
<LD>   Toward the end of the night, in fact, Barry Zweig -- who had been
the first guest artist to perform -- was still wandering from table
to table, happily muttering, "Man, isn't this something? This is
really something!"</LD>
<TE>   Zweig's opening appearance, highlighted by a light-footed romp
through "Just Friends," set the stage for what would be an
extraordinary display of the range of styles and manners included
under the broad umbrella of "jazz guitar" playing. Following Zweig's
smoothly flowing approach, Thom Rotella took a distinctly different
path. Unleashing a sequence of angular, darting lines in an opening
blues, he dipped into Wes Montgomery's trademark octave-line
improvising in a hard-driving "My Foolish Heart."</TE>
<TE>   Sid Jacobs, up next, added an entirely different slant via his
remarkable guitar transcriptions of the piano music of Bill Evans.
And Laurence Juber -- pointing out that, as the only player of a
flattop guitar, he felt like "the proverbial pork chop at a bar
mitzvah" -- delivered an energized group of solo tunes. Occasionally
tapping the strings to produce a propulsive rhythmic surge, he
offered yet another provocative guitar perspective.</TE>
<TE>   The diversity continued with a vocal/guitar medley from Dori
Caymmi, brilliantly transforming "Samba de Uma Nota So" into a
stunning ballad and evocatively combining "Desafinado" with the
classic "Aquarella do Brasil."</TE>
<TE>   And there was still more to come: duo performances by Jim Fox and
Bob Bain and Ron Anthony and Ron Afiff; the hard-grooving interplay
between Pisano and veteran guitarist Al Viola on "In a Mellow Tone";
and the arrival of the jazz blues guitar in the talented hands and
fingers of Phil Upchurch, slipping and sliding his way through "St.
Louis Blues" and "All Blues."</TE>
<TE>   In short, an amazing night to remember -- made even better by the
knowledge that Pisano's Guitar Nights continue on, embarking toward
further anniversaries in programs every Tuesday night at Spazio. Next
week's guest star: veteran studio guitarist and USC studio jazz
faculty member Pat Kelley.</TE>

<DH>The L.A. kid in him still thrills at the sight of snow --
and ski season's opening.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Benjamin Weissman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three images: I'm skiing through a glade of trees at the base of
Jackson Hole, Wyo., as a small herd of moose appears to my right --
they exhale huge jets of steam from their nostrils. Driving above
Fernie, Canada, early one February morning, a dozen big horn sheep
amble across the road. In Alaska a grizzly bear straight out of
hibernation grabs his/her feet and slides 2,000 feet down a snowfield
on its rear end. For an L.A. boy frequently caught in traffic, those
euphoric episodes resonate. They are the winter wonders of the world.</LD>
<LD>   My father, Murray, who learned to ski while on leave in the Navy
during WWII, first took me to Mammoth Mountain in 1963 when I was 5
years old. The drive lasted half the day. When we first encountered
snow on the road above Bishop, I begged Murray to pull over and let
me touch it. I was surprised by the texture; I had expected something
soft. It was crunchy and granular, a little unstable. The snow was
dirty, splattered with black mud dots from cars and snowplows. I
threw a snowball at our car and it exploded just like the
cherry-flavored snow cone I heaved at the back wall of my first-grade
classroom after school.</LD>
<TE>   Forty years later, I continue to trek up to Mammoth, and my awe of
snow and mountains is even greater. I'm unable to sleep the night
before a ski trip. I set the alarm for 2:30 a.m., but my hummingbird
heart barely lets me doze. In bed I'm in a state of high alert,
imagining my alpine future, transported from bone-dry Los Angeles 300
miles north to Mammoth. Opening day for most resorts is Thanksgiving.
Mammoth traditionally kicks things off weeks before Colorado and Utah
(this year it's today), unless early snowfalls permit an even earlier
opening date (e.g., blessed El Ninos).</TE>
<TE>   By 3 a.m. on opening day, Hirsch and Carl, my caffeinated ski
posse, are assembled in vehicle, zombie-groggy, primed for action or
car sleep. At sunrise, we're eating cold Casa Bianca pizza in the
Mojave Desert. At 7:40 a.m., we pull into Mammoth Lakes, lug all gear
into cabin, pretend to stretch muscles, dress pronto like instant
astronauts (we all wear helmets now), suck down more espressos, hoist
skis over shoulder and march to the hill, first in line for Canyon
Express. Thirty minutes pass, a huge line forms behind us, as the
lifties swat each chair with a plastic bat to bang last night's snow
off the frigid seat cushions. How rare to see so many competitive men
and women coexisting, all happy about the same thing, anxious and
pushy of course, but ridiculously cheerful about a fundamental
element, the accumulation of snowflakes.</TE>
<TE>   The first run of the season is so surreal (do we remember how to
do this?), but it all comes back. Hirsch and Carl, both ex-racers,
get in a tuck and beeline to the chair that will take us to favorite
secret spots. I follow. A few chairlifts later we are perched above
Dragon's Tail, a steep, tree-protected powder reserve. Fresh snow is
sexy. It teases you with a come-hither sparkle. Looking down through
dense fir trees, we each pick out our lines, and in a spontaneous
eager fit we all drop in at the same time and rip it up.</TE>
<TE>   My father and I are lifelong atheists, but when we see snow slowly
falling from the sky, fat perfect flakes landing on our shoulders
with the gentlest, most discreet fluff-fluff sound, we become
recklessly devout. We love snow. When Murray turned 70, he retired
from skiing, but as his 77th birthday approaches, he's threatening to
demo some fatties. "I might be slow walking up a flight of stairs,"
he says, "but I can ski down anything."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In politics, the champagne toasts and the Barbara Walters interview
go to the victor. The loser gets stuck with the concession speech.</LD>
<LD>   How he or she handles that dubious democratic duty can go a long
way toward binding up the wounds of a nasty campaign, uniting the
electorate behind the winner and, not coincidentally, giving a boost
to the loser's future career prospects.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday's election results offered several good instances of how
to sound gracious when your opponent has just eaten your lunch,
according to some serious students of political rhetoric. Republican
candidate Bill Simon, who lost the race for California governor to
incumbent Gray Davis, and U.S. Sen. Jean Carnahan, who failed in her
re-election bid to represent Missouri, were among the standouts.</LD>
<TE>   Former Vice President Walter Mondale was judged by some to have
delivered an exemplary speech under unusually trying circumstances.
"Walter Mondale's concession speech was really a model for what you
want to do in that rhetorical moment," said John Logie, professor of
rhetoric at the University of Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Given barely a week to campaign for a U.S. Senate seat after he'd
agreed to replace Democratic incumbent Paul Wellstone, who'd been
killed in a plane crash, Mondale lost to Republican challenger Norm
Coleman. Mondale fulfilled two basic requirements of a good
concession speech: reaffirming the goals of the campaign while
striking a bipartisan tone, Logie said.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him that the U.S. Senate is the best job in America, and I
think that he will love it," Mondale told his supporters. He went on
to urge young Democrats to stay active in politics: "You are our
future and you are the trustees of the legacy of social justice and
decency. Stand up and keep fighting."</TE>
<TE>   "What Mondale did was effectively empower Norm Coleman to do his
job," Logie said. "In a fierce political fight, it is often hard for
opponents to concede in a way that creates a space for a winner to
begin to build what you would hope would be a bipartisan coalition."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever harsh words and bad blood may flow between candidates
during the campaign, it's bad form to use a concession speech to
second-guess an opponent's victory or replay old arguments, Logie
suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a ceremonial aspect to what we do here," Logie said.
"Even if you have some serious disagreements, and I have no question
that Walter Mondale had disagreements with [Coleman], Mondale has
been around long enough to know you lose nothing by focusing on the
hopeful elements."</TE>
<TE>   "Hopeful" isn't the first word you'd think of to describe some
memorable concession speeches.</TE>
<TE>   In defeat, some politicians rise to lofty poetic heights, offering
gracious words of support to the victor while bringing tears to the
eyes of his or her faithful followers. Adlai Stevenson lost the
presidency twice to Dwight Eisenhower, but set the gold standard for
modern concession speeches by quoting Abraham Lincoln in his failed
1952 run for the White House. After an unsuccessful election bid,
Stevenson related, Lincoln said "he felt like a little boy who had
stubbed his toe in the dark. He said that he was too old to cry but
it hurt too much to laugh."</TE>
<TE>   At the opposite extreme, Richard Nixon sank into the rhetorical
mulch of sour grapes, grumbling to journalists when he lost the
California governor's race in 1962 that "you won't have Nixon to kick
around anymore."</TE>
<TE>   A touch of self-deprecating humor can help set a conciliatory tone
and salve the sting of defeat for a vanquished politician, said Tom
Hollihan, a professor at USC's Annenberg School for Communication.
When Jimmy Carter lost the White House to Ronald Reagan in 1980, he
said that he accepted the decision of the American people, though
"not with the same enthusiasm that I accepted the decision four years
ago."</TE>
<TE>   Though some interpreted Carter's remark as snarky, Hollihan said,
humor can be a way of acknowledging that "even in these moments of
loss when things somehow seem larger than life, life goes on."</TE>

<HD>Chamber group in need of a leader</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Small chamber groups tend to fall into two types: those dominated by
a single person and those made up of contending individuals. But what
happens when no one takes the lead, as was the case with Southwest
Chamber Music members Tuesday at Zipper Hall at the Colburn School of
Performing Arts?</LD>
<LD>   In the case of Max Reger's Quintet in C minor for Piano and
Strings, it meant music without a strong profile or character, a
sense of flow, direction or goal, and in general many missed
opportunities. Violinists Mark Menzies and Johnny Chang, violist Jan
Karlin, cellist Paula Fehrenbach and pianist Gayle Blankenburg had
all the notes, but kept deferring to each other. The music's drama
just dissipated.</LD>
<LD>   The program, the third of four concerts in the series called
"Autumn Twilight: Late Romantic Music from 1875 to 1918," opened with
a rare piece of piano music by Wagner, "Album Leaf for Betty Schott,"
and continued with Liszt's "The Lugubrious Gondola" for cello and
piano and "At the Grave of Richard Wagner" for piano. All were
carefully played by Blankenburg alone or with Fehrenbach.</LD>
<TE>   The other big piece was Mahler's "Songs of a Wayfarer" arranged
for voice and 10 instrumentalists by Schoenberg at a time, 1921, when
performances of Mahler's music were hard to come by. Soprano Kathleen
Roland was the low-voltage soloist. The ensemble honored Schoenberg's
wise and delicate balance of sonorities. Founding artistic director
Jeff von der Schmidt conducted cautiously.</TE>

<HD>Giuliani film heads to Canada; N.Y. not happy</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>With a movie about former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani set to start
shooting in Montreal today, a Brooklyn congressman called for tax
credits to offset the Canadian film industry's competitive advantage.</LD>
<LD>   "Today, somewhere in Canada, USA Network is making a movie about
the mayor of New York," Rep. Anthony Weiner said Wednesday. "I guess
they're going to show him watching baseball games at the [Toronto]
SkyDome, or eating pommes frites rather than eating at Patsy's."</LD>
<LD>   Members of the Screen Actors Guild and other film industry unions
joined Weiner, a Democrat, in front of City Hall to urge federal
legislation that would provide producers with a 25% tax credit for
wages if they film in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   "What we have to do is level the playing field between ourselves
and these other countries," said former SAG President Richard Masur.</TE>
<TE>   Canada offers wage-based incentives that can cover 35% of labor
expenses. Entertainment industry executives estimate that those
credits have cost the United States 25,000 jobs and $10 billion
annually for each of the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   The two-hour Giuliani movie, "Rudy!," is the latest example of the
trend. It's based on Wayne Barrett's biography and stars James Woods
in the title role.</TE>
<TE>   Weiner, who is co-sponsoring the U.S. Independent Film and
Television Production Incentive Act, said New York's film industry
has been particularly hard hit since Canada implemented tax credits
in 1998. California legislators also have discussed ways to offer
filmmakers wage-based tax credits for filming here.</TE>

<LD>Beginning next month, the Museum of Television &amp; Radio will screen
what it says is a never-before-seen tape of Frank Sinatra's 1979
concert in Egypt.</LD>
<LD>   The concert, staged in front of the pyramids and the sphinx,
marked Sinatra's first visit to Egypt and was undertaken to honor
President Anwar Sadat for his efforts to make peace with Israel.</LD>
<LD>   Museum officials said the concert was taped for documentation but
not for public consumption.</LD>
<TE>   But, working with the Sinatra family, they have "reconstructed the
performance from various archival materials" and will screen it at
their Beverly Hills locale from Dec. 6 to Feb. 23.</TE>

<LD>HBO has both co-creators of "NYPD Blue" working on dramatic series
for the pay channel, with producer Steven Bochco closing a deal on a
long-in-development project that would unfold entirely in the bedroom
of a married couple.</LD>
<LD>   The pay service has committed to the series, which likely won't
premiere until 2004. All the action would be set in the bedroom,
bathroom and closet area, providing an intimate look at a single
relationship.</LD>

own HBO series, "Deadwood," a western mixing fictional and real-life
characters.</LD>

unspecified damages and a court order stopping ABC from airing the

<HD>'La Boheme' backed by popular demand at Opera Pacific</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Swed</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"La Boheme" is regularly called the most popular of all operas, and
it probably is, usurping the position held in the 20th century by
Gounod's "Faust" and Bizet's "Carmen." The musical "Rent," based on
Puccini's opera, has certainly broadened "Boheme's" appeal outside
the opera sphere, and now the actual opera daringly heads to Broadway
in a new Baz Luhrmann production.</LD>
<LD>   One beneficiary of the recent "Boheme" publicity is undoubtedly
Opera Pacific, which opened its season Tuesday night at the Orange
County Performing Arts Center. Apparently all it took was hanging out
the "Boheme" shingle. Despite a no-name cast and a production
imported from Canadian Opera, which couldn't promise Luhrmann-like
visual allure, ticket demand was great enough for the company to add
a sixth performance to the originally scheduled five.</LD>
<LD>   Like "The Nutcracker," Rolling Stones tours and other performance
perennials, it is hard to have an outright disaster with "Boheme."
Audiences come preconditioned. Short of complete incompetence, the
horseplay always gets laughs, the dying Mimi never fails to bring a
tear to the eye.</LD>
<TE>   And so it was Tuesday in Segerstrom Hall in a perfectly
professional but otherwise unremarkable outing for Puccini's young
Parisian artists. Opera Pacific has been the company that tries
harder in the last couple of years, and although this "Boheme" offers
none of the originality that the company has shown it can bring to
opera production and performance, it has at least moved beyond the
kind of overblown garishness of its previous attempt at "Boheme" 3
1/2 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfram Skalicki's cartoonish sets, backed by a Van Gogh sky, look
like a bad painting by Marcello, the bohemian painter in the opera.
The earth-tone costumes by Robert Perdziola come from a different
production, at Santa Fe Opera. Bernard Uzan's direction has just
enough detail to keep the staging alive but not enough to make it
fresh.</TE>
<TE>   Misha Didyk is young and ardent, as a Rodolfo should be, but
vocally that ardor comes in the form of pushing a smallish voice with
a large wavering vibrato. Robin Follman makes an unusually forthright
Mimi, so enthusiastic about her consumption that even her coughs seem
to have determined vocal purpose. Though a strong, secure and silvery
soprano, she too suffers from a wide vibrato that reinforced Didyk's
in their duets. Add to that the persistent hearing-aid whistle coming
from somewhere in the audience and there were times when it sounded
as though some latter-day Parisian bohemian composer had touched up
Puccini's score with 21st century spectral harmonies.</TE>
<TE>   The effect wasn't necessarily unpleasant.</TE>
<TE>   The other bohemians proved more generally satisfying. Displaying a
powerful, focused, warm baritone, Frank Hernandez was the burly
Marcello. Anita Johnson brought a welcome dignity and gorgeous high
notes to Musetta. Kyle Ketelsen was the firm, moving Colline;
Gregorio Gonzalez, the gregarious Schaunard.</TE>
<TE>   Three seasons ago, Opera Pacific ran roughshod over "Boheme," the
orchestra barely coping. Under music director John DeMain, Tuesday's
playing was elegant. The chorus is still rough, but the children, as
always, are a delight.</TE>

<HD>Hooked on 'Rent'</HD>
<DH>Known as 'Rent'- heads, they're die-hard fans who love this
musical's message about love.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Verini</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Seasons of Love." "Another Day." "One Song Glory." "Take Me or Leave
Me."</LD>
<LD>   To most people, these are just a series of sentence fragments, or
possibly the names of Elton John's cats. But to a young woman named
Kimi Sasaki, and to a cadre of devoted musical fans like her, these
are the passwords to bliss. They are gospel.</LD>
<LD>   What they really are, for those of you living under that
generous-sized rock that skips most new musicals, are just a few of
the songs from "Rent," the fishnet-laden, "La Boheme"-inspired rock
opera by Jonathan Larson that exploded onto Broadway in 1996 and
spawned successful touring companies.</LD>
<TE>   If you go to the Wilshire Theatre to see "Rent" -- returning
Wednesday to Los Angeles for the first time in 3 1/2 years -- you
likely will witness several dozen Kimis waiting eagerly outside, in a
state of suspended (non-chemical) euphoria.</TE>
<TE>   What is it about "Rent" that has attracted a respectable cult
following, though not quite on the order of the Grateful Dead?</TE>
<TE>   "It's real," says Sasaki, 21, an undergraduate at UC Irvine. She
should know. She has seen "Rent" eight times, knows just about every
song by heart, and runs a Web site devoted to one of the actors in
the current road tour. "Everyone feels lost and confused at moments
in their lives. But you find strength in your friends and family, and
go on. That's what it's about."</TE>
<TE>   Sasaki admits that she has never been, much less met, an
HIV-positive bohemian artist trying to make ends meet while belting
out anthems in the cafes of downtown Manhattan's ethnic melting pot
(the character description for more or less every character in
"Rent").</TE>
<TE>   But the show's return to town is nonetheless a watershed moment
for her. Sasaki and her fellow "Rent"-heads, as they sometimes call
themselves, will camp out overnight in front of the Wilshire Theatre
for tickets. They will spend hours e-mailing each other to discuss
staging details and cast members. They will whisper in hushed tones
about new videotape bootlegs of the show, and they will travel
hundreds of miles to see the show again -- and again -- after its Los
Angeles run ends Nov. 17. Some of them will even travel across the
state or country to audition for the show. At an open audition in
Burbank last month, "Rent"-heads who also act had come from as far as
San Francisco and Boston to sing 12 bars in front of an overworked
casting director.</TE>
<TE>   Why all the fuss? "Rent" is fun, sure. The music is catchy. But
the stuff of obsession?</TE>
<TE>   Sasaki points to one of her favorite numbers, the duet "Without
You," which is sung by the dying musician, Roger, and the
heroin-addicted prostitute, Mimi, the lovers at the center of the
story. "It's not just Roger and Mimi's song, even though they're the
ones singing it. It's everyone's song who's ever been in love."</TE>
<TE>   "I think people relate to the no-day-but-today message," said
Megan Maxwell, 20, a student at USC and 16-show veteran who has
traveled as far as New York and San Francisco to see new productions.
"Everybody wants to live their life that way. But they can't always
do it."</TE>
<TE>   Emily Brunsten, a shy 14-year-old who got hooked after seeing the
show twice on Broadway, agreed. "I had problems with friends and
everything and just didn't really, like, care. But 'Rent' made me
appreciate my life more. It's about what a gift it is to be living."</TE>
<TE>   Much to Emily's chagrin, her mother is taking her to see the show
but won't allow her to camp out for tickets -- a rite of passage for
"Rent"-heads known as "rushing." More than six years after its
premiere, the Broadway production of "Rent" and its touring companies
still carry on the tradition of reserving the first two rows of seats
for sale the day of the show (two hours before the curtain). They're
sold at $20 each. (Standard ticket prices range from $32 to $69.50.)</TE>
<TE>   For die-hard fans, this means a lot of long nights spent on cold
pavement. "Rent"-heads take it very seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Chrissy Tamplin, a 24-year-old computer engineer, has rushed six
times -- since April. "After a while you get to know the cast and the
cast gets to know you, and they visit you on the rush line," she
said. "It's a big thing, you know."</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of the most amazing experiences of my life," said
Taylor Williams, 16. "You end up falling asleep next to somebody you
don't know, talking to someone you never met. There are roaches on
the floor. Homeless people offer us money."</TE>
<TE>   For Williams, rushing is a way to get closer to the
dignity-in-poverty spirit of the characters. Despite the fact that
its story originates in 19th century Paris, "Rent" is, for Williams,
a trip to an exotic part of his own society, one seldom glimpsed in
the suburbs of Los Angeles. "There's a lot that isn't Rockefeller
Center. There's a lot out there that most of us don't see."</TE>
<TE>   But for Sasaki, "Rent" is still all about the love. "The messages
are timeless," she says. " 'No Day but Today.' 'Seasons of Love.'
You're not alone. It's very inspirational. And that's why after all
these years it's still around. It's a celebration of life. What can
be more important than that?"</TE>

<HD>Prime-time takes on the death penalty</HD>
<DH>The issue makes for dramatic crime-show story lines and
gets viewers thinking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Craig Tomashoff</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last season, while filming an episode of her crime-busting CBS series
"C.S.I.," Marg Helgenberger was supposed to tell a killer, "You're
going to get the chair." When she asked the show's producers about
the line of dialogue, they explained that her tough-as-nails
investigator was clearly for the death penalty.</LD>
<LD>   "That's a personal decision people don't take lightly," says
Helgenberger, who opposes capital punishment. After successfully
getting the line lifted from the script, she also proposed that the
series do an episode focusing on the death penalty. That show airs
tonight, with her character trying to discover whether new DNA
research might exonerate a man she helped send to death row.</LD>
<LD>   "At the end of last season, the death penalty was on my mind, and
when I suggested doing something on it, they went ahead with it," she
explains. "This is a controversial issue, but one that I think people
want to talk about."</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, last week's "Law &amp; Order" on NBC revolved around a
murder case in which the conservative new district attorney played by
Fred Thompson pushes for the death penalty, only to eventually
discover that the alleged killers were innocent. Also, a recent
episode of Lifetime's legal drama "For the People" explored two
prosecutors' views as they sought the death penalty. Last May, the
CBS crime show "The District" also focused on the legal and moral
dilemmas presented by capital punishment. And several times since its
premiere in 1997, "The Practice" has used the death penalty as a
central plot point.</TE>
<TE>   From "L.A. Law" to "The West Wing," other prime-time dramas past
and present have also tackled the topic. There are plenty of
hot-button issues in the world, such as abortion, gun control and
euthanasia. Yet there's something about the death penalty that
continues to intrigue TV producers and viewers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one issue that you can present and know that everyone gets
it right upfront," says Jonathan Shapiro, a producer on "The
Practice." "Other issues, I think, have more gray area involved."</TE>
<TE>   "Crime is something that affects all of us," says "C.S.I."
executive producer Carol Mendelsohn. "And crime has consequences, and
the death penalty is a part of that. And that makes it organic to the
arena we're dealing with, or that any show that involves crime is
dealing with."</TE>
<TE>   "It's something that can be discussed," adds Cathy LePard,
executive producer of "For the People." "There are other issues you
discuss with your friends, but they provoke such passions, it's hard
to do them in a series. With the death penalty, it seems like there
is room for movement on the issue. You feel like if you discuss it
enough, you can bridge the gap between the two sides."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, prime-time TV isn't exactly a graduate-level course in
morality. If you can't entertain viewers, nobody is going to show up
to witness the philosophical debate. Crass though it may seem, the
death penalty plays perfectly into television's need for gripping
stories.</TE>
<TE>   "The death penalty is dramatic. There are life-and-death stakes,
which is as compelling as you can get," says Michael Chernuchin,
executive producer of "Law &amp; Order."</TE>
<TE>   And, says Shapiro, "you start with the fact that the stakes could
not be higher. Then add the last-minute time element. And add the
fact that audiences have strong opinions about the topic."</TE>
<TE>   Plenty of feature films have also dealt with the topic, everything
from the humorous ("The Front Page") to the humanistic ("Dead Man
Walking") to the haunting ("The Green Mile"). However, there's
something about television's prominent role in society that
apparently makes it a more viable forum for discussing the death
penalty. While it might be nice to assume that viewers get their
information about controversial topics from television news, the fact
is that prime-time programming is not only more prevalent, but it
also seems to be considered more believable.</TE>
<TE>   "People get some of their information from the news, but not all
of it comes from there," says Richard Dieter, director of the Death
Penalty Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit agency
that studies capital punishment. "They get a lot from popular
culture, from their favorite TV shows. For instance, when polls ask
people about DNA testing in capital punishment cases and whether or
not some people have been executed unfairly, something like 90% agree
that they have been. It's hard to believe there would be that strong
a feeling without both the media and pop culture playing a role."</TE>
<TE>   Drama producers seem well aware of this and enjoy the challenge of
"stirring some kind of debate," says Chernuchin. But, the "Law &amp;
Order" producer adds, "we always try to take a balanced approach.
Nobody is writing these as a screed."</TE>
<TE>   Yet what seems impartial to Hollywood producers seems like a
manifesto to death penalty proponents like Dianne Clements, who heads
a Texas-based organization called Justice for All. The way she sees
it, shows that feature a capital punishment episode often "make
heroes out of murderers."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, they take a sympathetic view of the killer,
painting him (and it's almost always a him) as someone caught up in a
biased criminal justice system. "They may be written to depict real
life, but these shows could never adequately depict what the family
of a victim goes through," Clements says. "If you watch these shows,
you'd think all the system does is convict innocent people. That's so
far from the truth, and I wish somebody would do something more
balanced."</TE>
<TE>   These days, the focus of most death penalty episodes does seem to
have shifted as the debate in the real world has shifted. Instead of
a pure and simple morality play about capital punishment itself, the
shows are dealing more with the problems with its application.
According to Dieter, 12 convicts on death row in the last nine years
have been exonerated when new DNA evidence raised questions about
their guilt. "The morality argument does seem to be a bit old,"
Dieter says. "It's important, but it seems old. And television is
picking up on that shift in the debate. Some of the earliest images
of those people walking off death row and into the arms of their
friends and family were so amazing, producers naturally said that
would make a great show."</TE>
<TE>   This shift in debate plays perfectly into the hands of a show like
"C.S.I.," which is dedicated to following the science of criminal
investigations. To shoot Thursday's episode, producers had an exact
replica of an execution chamber built on the set. A Nevada warden who
used to preside over lethal injections was hired to play that role.
Sticking with the show's trademark camera tricks, the episode opens
with shots of the injection swimming into a prisoner's bloodstream.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a morally intriguing area for us to explore," Mendelsohn
says. "I thought in doing it that if I could just get behind the eyes
and inside the body of someone on death row, maybe I'd understand it
all a little better. We did that in our episode, and the truth is, I
still don't know what to think."</TE>
<TE>   "It stirs debate and it's thought-provoking," Helgenberger says of
this week's episode. "Anything that does that is good. This is an
issue that hasn't gone away and won't go away until we find a way to
resolve it, if that's even possible."</TE>

<LD>In a few short years, Hideo Nakata has emerged as a modern master of
the horror picture. "The Ring," the remake of his 1998 feature of the
same name, is a box-office hit, and his "Dark Waters" is sure to be
ranked among the strongest offerings in the AFI Fest 2002, where it
screens at the ArcLight Saturday and Monday at 10 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   A compelling and stylish work of psychological suspense, it turns
upon a familiar device: placing an already unnerved individual into
an increasingly unsettling situation. Hitomi Kuroki's Yoshimi
Matsubara is in the throes of a custody battle with her ex-husband
over their 5-year-old daughter, Inuko. Thrown by the unexpectedness
of the conflict, Yoshimi realizes she must come across as a strong,
capable mother if she is to retain custody. Heartened that she's able
to resume her job as a proofreader and find a good school for Inuko,
she is less than thrilled by settling into an immense, rundown but
affordable apartment house. Her own unit has been freshened up, but
she fails to notice an ominous wet spot on her living room ceiling.</LD>
<LD>   What ensues is pretty scary, yet everything that occurs serves to
underline the transcendent strength of a mother's love for her child.
"Dark Waters" becomes eerie and chilling but it is a beautiful, even
poetic film of considerable accomplishment.</LD>
<TE>   "The Struma," a superb documentary with the suspense of a
Hitchcock thriller, brings together three men: David Stoliar, a Bend,
Ore., retired oil company executive; Greg Buxton, a British computer
programmer and deep-sea diver; and Simcha Jacobovici, a Canadian
filmmaker, to bring to light one of the least-known yet worst
civilian catastrophes of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 24, 1942, the Struma, a steam yacht built in Newcastle in
1867 for an English gentleman and designed to accommodate 100 people,
exploded in the icy waters of the Black Sea, costing the lives of 768
Jewish refugees, mainly from Romania and heading for Palestine.
Stoliar was the blast's sole survivor. The paternal grandparents of
Buxton were among the victims, and he became determined to locate the
remains of the Struma in tribute to them. Jacobovici, of Romanian
Jewish descent, was eager not to make "just another Holocaust
documentary."</TE>
<TE>   Jacobovici has succeeded triumphantly, for his documentary
generates suspense on two levels: Will he solve the mystery of the
explosion, and will Turkey actually allow Buxton to proceed
unimpeded? The answers reveal how the ruthless political expediencies
of the past continue to reverberate.</TE>

<DH>L.A.'s Ladyfest invites women to share their power and
pride while taking part in social, political and arts events.</DH>

<AU>Susan Carpenter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Ladyfest Los Angeles kicks off Friday, it will be one-stop
shopping for the aspiring renaissance woman. Not only can attendees
learn how to create online comics, write songs and cook soul food,
they can also take sweatshop tours and learn to become political
activists. And they can do it between watching bands, movies and
various other performances, all of them pro-girl, anti-corporate and
do-it-yourself.</LD>
<LD>   It's all part of the eclectic and empowering mix that was
pioneered two years ago at the original Ladyfest -- a six-day
festival in Olympia, Wash., of all things feminist that was attended
by 2,000 or so teen and twentysomething women (and a handful of
open-minded men).</LD>
<LD>   "It was amazing that this one little event in this tiny town
brought together all these women from all different backgrounds. I
was blown away because I'd never experienced anything like that
before," said Christene Kings, 30. An L.A. musician, she traveled to
Olympia to see the bands but was so inspired that she gathered a
bunch of like-minded friends to re-create it in L.A.</LD>
<TE>   Kings and the other dozen organizers of this weekend's event are
doing exactly what Lady- fest's founders had challenged women to do:
Live up to the festival's do-it-yourself ethos and bring Ladyfest to
their towns. New York and Chicago stepped up to the plate last year.
This year, in addition to L.A., there will be events in Georgia and
Europe. Next year, there will be a minor explosion, with Ladyfests
scheduled to take place in Philadelphia; Seattle; Florida; Texas;
Colorado; Manchester, England; Hamburg, Germany; and Melbourne,
Australia.</TE>
<TE>   "Revolution grrrl style now!"-- the early '90s battle cry
trumpeted by third-wave feminist icon Kathleen Hanna -- is, it seems,
not only alive today, but thriving.</TE>
<TE>   Lead singer of the political pop-punk band Bikini Kill, Hanna was
a key player in Riot Grrrl, a controversial and often misunderstood
underground musical and social movement founded in the early '90s.
While Ladyfest is not officially affiliated with Riot Grrrl, some of
its founders were the same and, thus, the sensibilities are similar.</TE>
<TE>   The Riot Grrrl movement encouraged young women to form their own
bands, writing lyrics to combat the rampant sexism they not only
heard on the radio but experienced in their lives. It suggested they
reject traditional women's magazines that told them how to act, look
and think, and to start creating their own. And it helped them form
support groups to talk about personal issues with other women.</TE>
<TE>   The schedule for Ladyfest Los Angeles encompasses many themes.
There will be panel discussions on health and gender issues,
workshops on songwriting and cameraless animation, and performances
by any number of women who've rejected what society says is
acceptable to pursue their artistic visions -- all offered in the
hopes that attendees will come away from the event a more self-aware
and inspired to do their own thing.</TE>
<TE>   The lineup for Ladyfest Los Angeles is not as aggressively
countercultural, politically biting or as wide-ranging as the
original, which included workshops on self-defense, traveling solo,
auto mechanics and the making of alternative menstrual products.</TE>
<TE>   Though this weekend's event touches on some hot-button issues,
i.e. sweatshops, and will donate all proceeds to a women's center
that treats victims of domestic violence, it is, overall, far more
arts-oriented.</TE>
<TE>   At that, the program excels. Significant time is given to a wide
variety of literary talks, spoken-word performances, film screenings
and bands, mostly localIn a city as spread out and isolating as L.A.,
Ladyfest has another goal: community-building.</TE>
<TE>   "I started making movies when I was 15. It took years for me to
meet other girls who made movies," said Brooke Olsen, 32, the
festival's production coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Idealistic and inclusive, Ladyfest is open to both genders and all
age groups, from a 6-year-old skateboarder to a 17-year-old
transsexual or 70-something filmmaker.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was 15, I had no idea that something like this could
exist," Kings said. "Had I known, I think my life would have been way
different."</TE>

<TE>   All I can say about the Damned is bow down when they come to your
town. The veteran punk band served up such hot goth lava at the
Hollywood Athletic Club's Halloween Masquerade Ball on Oct. 26, they
lit the house on fire. Wait, that was opening act the Toilet Boys,
whose fierce brand of glam rock is highlighted by pyrotechnics, which
always leave the crowd smoldering.... And what a crowd: In 10 years
of slogging these streets, I've never seen mo' better costumes. The
parade of Heaven's Gaters was weird, creepy weird. I asked the guy in
the Hamburglar costume, "What gives?" And he said, "What could be
more evil than McDonald's?" And I thought clowns were scary.... So I
heard Jack Grisham's mom did an in-store. The legendary T.S.O.L.
frontman who put the P in punk gives away all his memorabilia to fans
so his mom went shopping in the L.B.C. to stock up on his old albums.
Word got out and she was signing autographs for hours. T.S.O.L.
pillages the House of Blues on the Strip on Nov. 23 and 24.... Walk
this way: Star Shoes plans to celebrate its birthday on Sunday. Be
there or be square.... Steve Dimon's backward "Hi-five" came in handy
this week. The Joya promoter, who's known for saying hello to folks
with a knuckle-to-knuckle version of everyone's favorite geek
greeting, taught me the ol' slap shake a few years back. And I ran
into so many scene vets at Glen E. Friedman's photo exhibit at
Sixspace in downtown L.A. on Saturday, I had to pull the backslap out
of my arsenal. From Adolescents to Z Boys, the underground art, rap
and punk world came out to pay their respects to the legendary
photographer. The exhibit runs through Nov. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Tossed in the Brig</TE>
<TE>   Good news for Venice: Sugar owner David Reiss tells me his latest
club, the Brig, is booming. We hear the hot night to check it out is
Tuesdays. And nightlife guru Brad Johnson (Roxbury/Georgia/Sunset
Room) debuted his new sweet spot, Menemsha, a Venice bar and
restaurant named after an East Coast fishing village. With multiple
fireplaces and Johnson's food rep, should be a hot spot for
late-night lobster luvas.... And speaking of the finer things in
life, Greg Morris is moving on up. A former partner in such rock 'n'
roll spots as the Martini Lounge, the Garage and the Joint, Morris
has two new gems, the Spanish Kitchen and the Belmont, classing
things up on La Cienega. Bravo....</TE>
<TE>   Coming and going</TE>
<TE>   Thug life lives! The new Transplants album is gangsta punk at its
finest and we hear bad boys of rock Motochrist are writing a new
album. I feel so dirty.... Gonna see the Toledo Show tonight at the
Sunset Room. The master choreographer-dancer-jazz singer's causing
quite a stir. We even hear the Forty Deuce girls have been hanging
out there. Probably copping his moves....This just in: On Saturday,
Cherry promoter and DJ Mike Messex is partnering up with his old pal
Bruce Perdew (Blue) on Sucker, a sexy new Saturday at WeHo's Ultra
Suede (see "Openings" in Night Life list for more info).... We also
hear the wild burlesque revue the Velvet Hammer comes to the Mayan
Theatre on Nov. 14 and 21. So sexy it's almost evil.</TE>

<HD>David Cross speaks up on 'Shut Up'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Hundley</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Being funny ain't easy. If David Cross' new live stand-up CD is any
indication, the road to comedic success is paved with cruel
rejection, bitter embarrassment and painful schoolyard humiliations.</LD>
<LD>   With his partner, Bob Odenkirk, Cross was one of the warped minds
behind the short-lived and much-missed HBO sketch comedy "Mr. Show."
As a solo act he's taken his distinctive brand of humor (misanthrope
amusement threaded through with hilarious streaks of righteous
indignation) out onto the open road. Performing alongside various
bands in rock clubs and dive bars across the nation, Cross recorded
his journey for posterity, the resulting double album "Shut Up You
... Baby!," out this week on Seattle's Sub Pop label.</LD>
<LD>   "Opening up for bands is always tough," says Cross from his home
in New York City, "but I'm much more comfortable on those stages than
at comedy clubs. It's more my crowd. The bands that I work with are
total Emo-core, shoe gazers, that sort of thing. I try to go out with
bands who share a certain aesthetic and affinity for the same sort of
stuff. If you like a certain type music, you'll probably think I'm
funny."</LD>
<TE>   Cross' act, foul mouthed and razor sharp, doesn't shy away from
vicious social criticism and outright political dissent. He takes
shots at everything from the Bush administration to the recent
scandals in the Catholic Church to the inherent materialism and
shallowness of the city of L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't hate it, exactly," says Cross of Los Angeles, "it's just
a bad place for me to live. The things that people talk about being
great about L.A. I have no interest in. I don't like the weather and
it's aesthetically quite ugly. But it does has a tremendous amount of
good comedians!"</TE>

<HD>L.A. defines happy hour</HD>
<DH>The drinks are cold, the food is good and cheap, and the
scenery isn't bad, either.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julia Gaynor</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Word on the street was that it couldn't possibly exist. Not here,
anyway. Happy hour was an old-fashioned relic from the days when
two-martini lunches were de rigueur, when a man could call his
secretary "honey" and feel good about it.</LD>
<LD>   It's dated, irrelevant. Or at the very least, it's something other
cities do. We're too sophisticated for that. Or too health-conscious.
At the end of the day, we go to the gym, the self-improvement class,
the "networking" schmooze. We don't have "appetizer deals" or "drink
specials." We have $9 martinis.</LD>
<LD>   We don't bond after work with our co-workers. We race to our SUVs
and clog the freeways, desperate to isolate ourselves even further in
our gated communities. We have too far to drive. We have too much to
do. We wouldn't be caught dead drinking that early in the day. And as
for meeting people?</LD>
<TE>   That's what the Internet's for. Right?</TE>
<TE>   Wrong. L.A. does indeed have happy hours. We have so many that you
could go to a different spot every day for months and never hit the
same place twice.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, you probably wouldn't. And really, you probably
shouldn't. Many of them still resemble abysmal throwbacks to
yesteryear, complete with stale beer and rubber chicken wings. But
there's a new breed today; fresh and lively Southern California
reincarnations of a ritual as American as yard sales. Let's face it:
These days, we're not as likely to blithely slap down $12 for a vodka
tonic when we can get it somewhere else for half-price.</TE>
<TE>   To uncover the happy hour renaissance, the search went from Malibu
to Pasadena, spanning more than 35 bars and restaurants over several
weeks. The result? Whether you want to go around the corner or
venture beyond the familiar, L.A. has a happy hour destination to
suit almost everyone.</TE>
<TE>   There's entertainment-industry happy hour, happy hour by the
beach, upscale happy hour, sushi happy hour, Hollywood-hipster happy
hour, happy hour for corporate suits, working stiffs and the older
generation. For those whose work hours aren't compatible, there's
late-night happy hour and weekend happy hour. If you can't stand the
thought of traditional happy-hour food -- piles of glop steaming away
on top of the Sterno -- despair not. Some of L.A.'s top-notch
restaurants offer appetizer specials cheap.</TE>
<TE>   Of course there are countless small local bars that have their own
versions, but it is the more distinctive happy hours that are
redefining the city's after-work style.</TE>
<TE>   7:30 p.m. Tuesday</TE>
<TE>   First stop was the Well, a dark and chicly designed watering hole
in the heart of Hollywood -- in one of the ZIP Codes where you're
most likely to find overpriced cocktails. Rimma Aranovich drinks $3
vodka tonics and eats $4 bar food that's meal-sized. "One of the best
things about this place is that the happy hour is from 6 to 9, so
people who work till 7 or 8 can still make it here and reap the
rewards," the 28-year-old set designer says.</TE>
<TE>   Young, pretty people filter in and out while a mix of hip-hop and
rock music plays in the background. "Hey, James," someone says to the
man behind the bar before joining a friend at one of the round,
candlelit booths. Absolutely everyone says hello to James Rhea, the
manager, as if he's the Sam Malone of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   He says the Well is trying to change happy hour's image, take it
into the 21st century. "People think of happy hour and think of El
Torito, or something cheesy that your grandparents did. It doesn't
have to be like that," Rhea says. The Well's happy hour crowd is
mostly industry people, he says, employees from Nickelodeon across
the street, workers in the office building that houses the bar and
some Hollywood locals.</TE>
<TE>   There are some people reading scripts, others having business
meetings, even a man at the bar solving theorems as he studies for
his business school entrance exam. As the evening wears on, though,
the atmosphere has more of a pickup vibe. Attractive young things
drift in to case the place, looking for their next date or next
business contact: In Hollywood, either is considered a success.</TE>
<TE>   All L.A. happy hours share the goal of providing a pit stop where
people can decompress or let off steam. Above all, happy hour is
about the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's $1 beer or $3 sushi, all-you-can-eat buffet or a
half-price martini, there will be some special to lure you in. Once a
happy hour has won your heart, the next step is commitment, becoming
a regular. And then, everybody will know your name.</TE>
<TE>   Happy hours are not all created equal. But along the happy hour
highway, you will encounter some definite standouts. They've all got
a bit of the "Cheers" factor and are worth visiting. Here are scenes
from the tour:</TE>
<TE>   5:30 p.m. Friday</TE>
<TE>   At McCormick &amp; Schmick's downtown, the outdoor patio buzzes loudly
with rowdy conversation; every table is full.</TE>
<TE>   This is a post-work crowd; bankers, lawyers, other local business
people come with their ties loosened to kvetch about work, wait for
traffic to die down, or feast on the incredible $1.95 burgers,
quesadillas or other outrageously cheap food on offer from 3 to 11
p.m. Men are in suits or business casual, women wear twin sets and
slacks. This could be anywhere in America at this time of day.</TE>
<TE>   The waitress brings a beer to a regular who didn't even have to
order first.</TE>
<TE>   Edmund Sumner, a 25-year-old sales consultant for Minolta who's
sitting with his boss, looks the picture of a future corporate
raider, kind of a Mini-Me of the man sitting across from him. He says
they like to kill time here between work and Clippers games. "We talk
about work and women. I have to gain wisdom from my elders," he says,
smirking. Then he adds, "The canvas here is always painted well."
Translation: The women are hot.</TE>
<TE>   They're not the only ones who feel that way. Inside, six
attractive women in their 20s sit at a round table. They're being
checked out and chatted up by a gaggle of men in suits.</TE>
<TE>   "He just asked me out," a brunet mouths excitedly to her friend.
"Should I go out with him?"</TE>
<TE>   "Which one is he?" her friend mouths back.</TE>
<TE>   "The one with the blue tie."</TE>
<TE>   "Definitely."</TE>
<TE>   One of the women at the table, Michelle Rodriguez, is a film
publicist who lives and works in Hollywood. She says they take the
subway here on Friday nights because they're tired of the Hollywood
scene. "It's the most social happy hour in L.A.," she says. "More
people will actually talk to you here than anywhere else."</TE>
<TE>   One final note on McCormick &amp; Schmick's: There are several
branches of this chain, and the one in Beverly Hills does not have
the "Cheers" factor. The staff is dismissive of the happy hour crowd,
practically ignoring them in favor of the full-paying customers, and
you can't special-order your burger. In Beverly Hills, you get what
you pay for.</TE>
<TE>   6 p.m. Wednesday</TE>
<TE>   It's time for the beach and Chaya Venice. The place is packed, and
the rule here is that you must be seated at the bar or a table to
enjoy the generous sushi happy hour. But hey, this is Venice, man,
the laid-back capital of the world, and your hostess, Chanel, does
her best to make it easy for you.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd here is well-heeled, very good-looking, 30s and 40s,
mostly locals who seem to know one another or want to get to know one
another better. Most people are chatting with friends, but several
sit alone, reading or talking to the bartender.</TE>
<TE>   Chrissie Wilson, a writer and resident Venetian, is tall and
striking, with a mane of mussed long blond hair. She's perched at the
sushi bar, a $3 bowl of miso soup to her right, a glass of chardonnay
to her left. She says she stops by several times a week and doesn't
have any problem showing up on her own. "This is my local. When
you're in a city and live alone, there's always that sense of being
out of the loop a bit, and it's nice if there's a place you can go
and feel at home. I'm never awkward coming by myself." Plus, she
adds, people on the staff treat regulars like friends. This is
evident by the number of times Chanel hugs entering patrons.</TE>
<TE>   There are no drink specials here, but you can order $3 sushi or
scallops from one of the best restaurants in L.A. and enjoy a few
hours of very civilized chill time, Venetian-style.</TE>
<TE>   7 p.m. Thursday</TE>
<TE>   At Meet Me Cafe, four slightly self-conscious bongo players play
enthusiastically in the corner; stylish girls in ultra-low cut jeans
sprawl on comfy couches; and beautiful boys in black sip $3 beers and
munch on $2 falafel with tahini, eyes darting to see who's arrived.</TE>
<TE>   This funky Beverly Hills restaurant is a popular lunch spot with
the entertainment industry folk who work around Robertson and
Wilshire boulevards, and once a week it opens its doors for industry
happy hour, cashing in on the glut of agents, models, actors, and
writers who visit or work at one of the acronyms in this 'hood: CAA,
BMG, ICM and the like.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea of Meet Me is just that," owner Ronit Mory says.
"Customers get a chance to hook up in an informal setting. Last week,
a regular who's a model met a producer, and who knows?" The question
lingers with that special Hollywood brand of optimism until you see
what truly sets this place apart: two books, one red and one blue,
that are part of the in-house dating service.</TE>
<TE>   Each book includes customers' personal profiles -- red for women,
blue for men, anonymous of course -- for other patrons who are single
and looking. If you like what you see, give a waiter the
corresponding code number for the desired personal and Ronit will do
the rest, arranging a date at the cafe. For those not in the market
for a model or agent to date, the books are an entertaining read.</TE>
<TE>   7 p.m. Friday</TE>
<TE>   This is definitely the night for Ciudad. Downtown again, and
definitely not disappointed. A six-piece Latin band plays lively
salsa music in the large open-air courtyard in front of the
restaurant. Tables are filling up. Birthday parties, leaving do's,
conventioneers bonding in the comfort zone of happy hour. On offer
are abbreviated versions of Ciudad's out-of this world food for less
than $5, as well as $3.50 mojitos and the most spectacular white wine
sangria you could imagine. Four young men in khakis nurse beers at
the bar inside.</TE>
<TE>   It's happy hour, but this group looks glum. "This is a very
special happy hour place for us but not a very happy day," Geoff
Wullscalager says.</TE>
<TE>   Three of them were laid off from their law firm and they
immediately came here to console one another, a place they usually
flock to for end-of-the-week celebration, because as Wullscalager
says, "if you're a regular, they really make you feel like you
belong. In Oregon, where I'm from, there are lots of bars where
everybody knows your name. It blows me away that a place in downtown
L.A. has a corner bar feel too." Although he lives in Pasadena, he
says, he'll continue to go to Ciudad even if it isn't close, simply
because it's the right happy hour for him.</TE>
<TE>   5 p.m Friday</TE>
<TE>   Dukes in Malibu is like a scene from "Magnum P.I.," circa 1982.
Towheads with tans sit next to sun-kissed beach babes sporting
mirrored sunglasses and visors, most wearing shorts and sandals.
There's a timeless kitsch about Malibu that matches the retro feel of
happy hour perfectly.</TE>
<TE>   Dukes is vast, but happy hour happens in the Barefoot Bar, a cozy
offshoot of the main restaurant. There's a sports bar inside and a
wooden deck suspended over the Pacific Ocean with grassy
umbrella-topped tables outside. Something about the sea air and waves
crashing on the rocks below sets a serene scene: lots of
contemplative silences and couples kissing gently, oblivious to the
fact that they're not alone.</TE>
<TE>   A sporty looking waitress sashays over in a mini-sarong and tank
top. Would you like to try a beach drink? Say, the Lava Flow,
Tropical Itch or Beach Boy? All sound suitably festive, but today is
Friday and it's Mai Tai Madness: When mai tais are $3.50 during happy
hour, the choice is simple. Other daily specials include Big
Wednesdays, with $2 Bud and Bud Light drafts, and Taco Tuesdays, with
enormous fish tacos for $1.95.</TE>
<TE>   Some computer support technicians do "employee bonding" at a table
in the corner. "We're sharing our pain," quips Jason Antoyan, a
25-year-old member of the trio as he orders his second margarita.
"I'm a great employee," he jokes. "When I'm not working, that is."
They all laugh, then look out at the sea, their faces tranquil and
calm. It seems you just can't help feeling content at happy hour in
"the 'Bu."</TE>

<LD>Everyone seems to be looking for his 15 minutes of fame through
unscripted TV these days, but chances for success are slimmer than a
toothpick -- in some cases as little as 1 in 50,000. Looking to beat
the odds? You may want to check out "How to Land a Spot on Reality
TV," a Nov. 19 class offered by the Learning Annex and moderated by
Jim Dobson, a celebrity publicist whose clients include Benicio del
Toro and Roseanne, as well as various unscripted-TV "stars."</LD>
<LD>   Share experiences will be Marcellas Reynolds, the flamboyant gay
diva who shacked up in a Studio City house for "Big Brother"; Rebekah
Holly, one of the eligible women on "Bachelorettes in Alaska"; and
Blake Mycoskie, the sexy contestant who traipsed around the world for
"The Amazing Race."</LD>
<LD>   What they have in common, other than being charming and
attractive, Dobson said, is that they are "diverse, with different
experiences and backgrounds." Their secret for landing on prime-time
TV: playing up those idiosyncrasies. Sheila Conlin, a casting
director who's looking for "Bootcamp" competitors, will round out the
panel.</LD>
<TE>   Dobson will cover techniques for getting on a show and putting
together a standout audition tape. Strategies for winning and
profiting from the program after the season is over also will be
covered, even though the odds say few, if any, students will have
that opportunity.</TE>

<HD>French to the core, and ravishingly so</HD>
<DH>Bastide presents its impressive tasting menus in a chic
setting.</DH>

<LD>Finalement. After two years of planning, more than a year of
construction and months of test dinners and private parties, Bastide
is open. The letter B picked out in glass beads on either side of a
doorway among antique shops on Melrose Place marks the spot of chef
Alain Giraud's new restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   Two silvery-leafed olive trees stand over a serene courtyard
garden. Andree Putman, the Paris designer, has turned the small house
at the back into a ravishingly chic restaurant. As reconfigured by
Putman, Bastide encompasses a trio of intimate dining rooms divided
by shimmering crystal bead curtains. The middle room, open to the sky
in fine weather, features a dramatic cascade of plants.</LD>
<LD>   Bastide is French all the way -- French chef, designer, sommelier
-- and, to my knowledge, in a first for L.A., it pours only French
wines. How this will fly remains to be seen, though I haven't seen
any California winemakers picketing out front -- yet.</LD>
<TE>   The cooking, of course, is French too, with references to Giraud's
native Provence. No a la carte options here (or corkage, for that
matter), just a choice of several tasting menus ranging from $60 to
$90. The seasonal menu (right now, figs) is the most interesting. The
grand "Bastide" menu, the most lavish. It's very classic, very
delicious and surprisingly conservative for a restaurant with
ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   Giraud's foie gras is amazing; a plump little cushion of duck
liver in a syrupy fig sauce made with Banyuls, a sweet red dessert
wine from Provence. I loved the soothing grapefruit sorbet bathed in
Noilly Pratt vermouth served after it, followed by rack of lamb in a
dusky black olive sauce and panisse: tender chickpea batter fried to
a pale gold. To finish, Giraud sends out lavender ice cream enrobed
in meringue and berries and a plate of impeccable petits fours.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't end there. The first few evenings, sommelier Christophe
Rolland made the rounds wielding an impressive jeroboam of 1986
Chateau d'Yquem.</TE>
<TE>   Bienvenue, Bastide, a Los Angeles.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After decades of trying to remember the correct salt-shot-lime
sequence (or is it shot-lime-salt?), tequila drinkers may welcome
news that a traditional drink style is not only removing the
indecision, but offering a colorful alternative.</LD>
<LD>   Called the "Bandera," it's one of the things that Mexican
travelers, especially those in the Guadalajara region, are learning.
Granted, it's not up there with cultural lessons such as avoiding tap
water or realizing those young men in tattered Levi's toting
automatic weapons on the street corners are only there for your peace
of mind, but it does add some spice to consuming Mexico's national
adult beverage.</LD>
<LD>   Named for the Mexican flag, the Bandera consists of three
ingredients, each served in a tall shot glass.</LD>
<TE>   First up, representing the flag's green stripe, is lime juice. If
you can get them -- and you usually can in reputable establishments
-- go with Persian limes, which are sweeter than the American
variety.</TE>
<TE>   In the middle glass goes the tequila. I recommend a good reposado
such as Tradicional by Jose Cuervo, though Don Julio will do in a
pinch. And finally, a red shot of sangrita, which is essentially
super-spicy Bloody Mary mix.</TE>
<TE>   As for the proper drinking order, there isn't one. It's freestyle.
Sip some tequila, then a little lime juice. Or go tequila, sangrita,
lime. Mix, match, have fun.</TE>

<KH>My Favorite Weekend: Eric McKain</KH>
<HD>Craving post-show creature comforts</HD>

<AU>Carolyn Patricia Scott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the musicians who makes "The Lion King" roar, herds of
antelope leap and imitates the fluttering of birds in flight is
percussionist Eric McKain. During the musical's extended Southland
engagement, the Angeleno has been enjoying all of the comforts of
home.</LD>
<LD>   Exotic weekend</LD>
<LD>   Traveling to someplace beautiful, relaxing and romantic, that's my
ideal weekend -- to go to the Caribbean, preferably the Bahamas,
Jamaica or St. Martin's, that's the best.</LD>
<TE>   Closer to home</TE>
<TE>   But a weekend isn't enough time for that. So when I'm not
traveling or touring I love going to the beach. I have this spot up
near the Channel Islands and I sit on this particular rock. The seals
swim there, you see the kelp. Look at the islands.... Sometimes I'll
go to Catalina -- take the boat to the island, have dinner and come
back.</TE>
<TE>   I really enjoy driving. I take my car, we go up the coast on the
101 to the Malibu Fish market. There I'll have fish and chips
outdoors and look at that beautiful view. .</TE>
<TE>   Shaping up</TE>
<TE>   I work out mornings; I'll take a five-mile walk through Pan
Pacific Park, around the tar pits. I'll do that maybe five times a
week. I like racquetball; an in-law, one of the Pointer Sisters, has
a court in her house -- or I go to the YMCA. If I feel really
energetic, I'll hike up the trail to Mt. Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The dinner hour</TE>
<TE>   I do love a good steak -- for that I go to Ernie Morton's on La
Cienega. Oh, and I like Yamashiro in Hollywood; there you can have an
intimate conversation, the atmosphere's really soothing and the view
is awesome. For Thai food, it's Chan Dara. Tidal Wave in Gower Gulch
on Sunset, their jambalaya is killer.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping time</TE>
<TE>   On days off I might sit in with friends -- other musicians that're
playing somewhere, or I'll stop by the Professional Drum Shop across
from the musicians' union in Hollywood. I like checking out what's
new, talking with guys that are knowledgeable about the business --
I'll even try out some of the instruments. You know, just experiment
with the sounds.</TE>
<TE>   After dark</TE>
<TE>   For nightlife, I like dancing to, you know, the old stuff -- '70s
and '60s music. For that we go to Little J's in downtown L.A., then
there's the old Club House in Ladera Heights playing the funk hipster
stuff. And we like to salsa dance at El Floridita Cuban restaurant on
Fountain and Vine. There we can eat -- fried rice, black beans, fried
plantains, a garlic sauce dip that's happening -- then we dance.</TE>
<TE>   Cheers</TE>
<TE>   Cocktails? I head to the top of the Bonaventure -- it rotates, and
you can see views around the city. The Kibbitz Room in Cantor's is my
local bar, and at Farmers Market, they've got a wine and beer bar;
all my friends hang out there and people from CBS, writers and
producers, janitors, street people. It's not a racial thing, it's
just a great crowd. And then there's the infamous Frolic Room right
next to the Pantages. The Frolic has so much Hollywood history -- all
of old Hollywood drank there. Can't forget Jumbo's Clown Room --
that's a strip club -- but the drinks are good, really!</TE>

<LD>Think you're overqualified for your job?</LD>
<LD>   Meet Abdoulaye N'Go, head usher at the Geffen Playhouse. He's
studied dance with choreographer Katherine Dunham, and drama all over
the world, from the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco to
the Conservatoire National D'Art Dramatique de Paris.  In his early
40s, he was born in Senegal and is a native speaker of French and the
African dialect Wolof. He also speaks Spanish and Mandarin and is
finishing his master's in Italian literature at UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Inner vision</TE>
<TE>   N'Gom wants to be an international character actor and he's on his
way with small roles in "Green Card," as well as "Dharma &amp; Greg" and
other TV shows. His Broadway and off-Broadway credits include an
appearance at the Manhattan Theatre Club in "Boesman and Lena,"
directed by Athol Fugard.</TE>
<TE>   Style</TE>
<TE>   Patrons hear his melodious voice and say he ought to be on stage.
His response? "In L.A. everybody's an actor. I'd rather say I'm a
student of the theater."</TE>
<TE>   Perks</TE>
<TE>   Meeting Brendan Fraser during the Geffen's "Four Dogs and a Bone."
That led to a role in "George of the Jungle" and its sequel.</TE>
<TE>   Seat mix-ups</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the time it's the wrong night."</TE>
<TE>   No small parts</TE>
<TE>   He ushers because he adores theater and needs the flexible
schedule to take auditions. "Maybe some of us are long-distance
runners and maybe God is giving us a job that we are above, but we're
doing it so well that one day we'll make it, because we are fully
prepared."</TE>
<TE>   Career  philosophy</TE>
<TE>   "Success is measured by the sum total of all the obstacles you've
overcome. That is stronger than the millions you'll make because it
forms your character, it's part of your blood."</TE>

<HD>Lively take on a 'slow, steady' tale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lynne Heffley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tina (the tortoise) Shellback to her dad, who's less than thrilled
that she has agreed to race Harry (the hare) Fastfeet: "You told me
that slow and steady wins the race." Mr. Shellback: "In life, yes.
Against a hare, no."</LD>
<LD>   The Shellback family motto, "Be nice at any price," is sorely
tested against the Fastfeet creed -- "Don't Just Win. Dominate" -- in
"Tortoise vs. Hare ... This Time It's Personal," a lively romp at
Burbank's Falcon Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   The bespectacled, very nice, very slow Tina (Sarina Ranftl) just
wants to be pals with Harry (Omar D. Brancato), but, egged on by his
martially minded mom, Sergeant Fastfeet (Roberta Wall), Harry taunts
Tina until she accepts his challenge to race.</LD>
<TE>   Played out in the theater aisles and through the rows of seats,
the race has its usual result, after plodding Tina prepares with some
serious physical training and loud encouragement from the audience,
while overconfident Harry stuffs himself and has to sleep it off. In
the end, Harry and Tina find they have more in common than they
thought, and their parents learn a lesson in friendship too.</TE>
<TE>   Playwright Thorin Alexander, director Scott Marshall and the cast,
including Jennifer Jean Snyder as a combination good
fairy-emcee-sports announcer, infuse the familiar tale with
feel-good, comic bounce. Costume designer Rachel Myers adds to the
fun, especially with the tortoises' wittily nerdy attire, and Andrea
Housh's leafy, dappled lighting adds depth to set designer Rob
Zylowski's visuals.</TE>

<DH>Hidden away in Carson is a treasure trove of antique
printing presses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Valerie J. Nelson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stepping into the International Printing Museum in Carson feels a bit
like taking a chance on a mystery gift in plain wrap. For inside the
unassuming building, practically hidden in an industrial mall across
from a Kmart, is a collection of antique printing presses that even
the Smithsonian is said to envy.</LD>
<LD>   The museum has one of the largest private collections of antique
printing presses in the world, says Mark Barbour, director of the
museum established in 1988. The 150 major pieces and thousands of
small ones are from the personal collection of Ernest A. Lindner, a
Los Angeles printing equipment dealer who spent 50 years wandering
the world trying to preserve 19th and early 20th century presses.
(Lindner, who died last year, often acquired equipment in trade.)</LD>
<LD>   The treasures quickly reveal themselves on the crowded museum
floor during a 60-minute tour that spans more than 500 years of
history. Leading the way is our enthusiastic tour guide, Phil
Soinsky, who also portrays Ben Franklin in shows at the museum.
Soinsky is acting more like a game-show host, spewing out printing
trivia and firing questions at his seven-person audience.</LD>
<TE>   "What do you think of when you think of Ben Franklin?" he asks.
People respond: printer, prolific inventor, publisher. "The $100
bill," my daughter says. (She is 14.)</TE>
<TE>   The tour begins in "Ben Franklin's working Colonial print shop,"
with a press from 1806, the third-oldest American-made printing press
in existence. It quickly segues to a re-creation of a Gutenberg press
from 1440 on which "Master Adam," a boy on the tour tapped to be an
apprentice, helps print the parables of Solomon on paper glowing with
preprinted illuminated text.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest deal to people is that they see the machines
working," Soinsky says later. "In some museums, it's like, 'Don't
touch, just observe.' "</TE>
<TE>   Our guide fashions type out of hot metal, then delivers a speedy
English-language history lesson that touches on the origin of the
expression "out of sorts." (When printers ran out of sorted letters,
they were not able to finish their work.)</TE>
<TE>   Adam's younger sister, who looks about 3, is mildly out of sorts
and wants to leave halfway through. The museum, which gives tours to
as many as 20,000 schoolchildren a year, recommends children be in at
least fifth grade, but Soinsky says some "sharp cookies" in third
grade have done just fine.</TE>
<TE>   Like many of the presses, a show-stopping ornate machine from 1824
is used to frame a larger story. A tale of Early American marketing
prowess is told through the Columbian Press, which dripped with
American symbols and failed here, yet became a sensation in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   When one press, built by a minister in 1870 who couldn't afford to
buy one, is set in motion, the group is asked to guess what it
resembles (a grasshopper). But when Soinsky sits to work a Linotype
machine from the same era, the keys just sputter.</TE>
<TE>   Soinsky shrugs. In the "outside world" there was a mechanic to
troubleshoot for every six Linotypes, he says. Today, one
"actor-writer-cartoonist" keeps the show going before ending the tour
in a back room, where groups (by appointment) reenact the
Constitutional Convention.</TE>

<LD>An Appalachian Twelfth Night -- Entering the Globe Playhouse in West
Hollywood, theatergoers find a mountain hoedown in progress, with
lively folk songs spurring some participants to break into
foot-stomping dances. This Dancing Barefoot production sets
Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" in 1938 in Kentucky coal-mining
country, where the story of separated twins, each thinking the other
dead, finds a comfortable home. Playfully conceived by Robert L.
Williams and touchingly rendered by director Susan Lambert, the
staging benefits from extensive use of old-time folk music, under Rob
Kendt's supervision. It's a toe-tapping, laugh-spreading good time.</LD>

Hollywood, (310) 285-5575.</LD>

<LD>You told the brief story of musician Ryan Adams, who stopped a
concert when a fan jokingly yelled out a request for a song by Bryan
Adams ("Quick Takes," Oct. 17). Ryan turned on the lights and refused
to continue until said fan was ejected from the arena. You didn't
mention if Mr. Adams had a solitary tear rolling pitifully down his
cheek while all this happened.</LD>
<LD>   This amusing story reminded me of a performance I had the pleasure
of seeing a few years ago of New York rocker Patty Smyth. The show
was a fund-raising concert she put on for the benefit of the firemen
who saved her Malibu-area home from fire during a summer dry spell.</LD>
<LD>   During the show, Patty asked the house what they wanted to hear. A
fan screamed "Because the Night," a hit for poet-singer Patti Smith,
she of the hairy armpits. The crowd got a good laugh out of it and so
did the lovely Miss Smyth, who not only complied with the request but
put her own extemporaneous spin on it, fashioning some pretty amusing
lyrics to a song she introduced as "Because the Fire" and dedicating
it with gratitude to all the firemen in the audience.</LD>

<LD>Thank you for printing the Linda Blair article ("My Favorite
Weekend," Oct. 31). It is nice to know that some actors use their
celebrity for causes other than self-promotion.</LD>
<LD>   Ms. Blair is a wonderful advocate for the animals, speaking on
their behalf, raising money for their care, and most of all by going
vegan. She is promoting the best possible way to help animals, which
is not to eat them.</LD>
<LD>   Animals raised for food suffer tremendously their whole, short
lives, only to be cruelly slaughtered in the end. I hope more people
follow her lead and decide that animals need our care, not our
dominance. We all share this earth, and what we need now is peace,
not violence.</LD>

<HD>In '8 Mile,' he doesn't miss a beat</HD>
<DH>The film's Mekhi Phifer knows the rhythm and pulse of
street life -- he once lived it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew John Ignatius Vontz</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "8 Mile," the custom-made vehicle for the acting debut of rapper
Eminem, the story works hard to communicate the gritty Detroit roots
of his multi-platinum-selling hip-hop pain. For his main supporting
actor, Mekhi Phifer, the connections among the streets, hip-hop and
the actor's life were an easy reach.</LD>
<LD>   Phifer, 27, grew up rapping and living the hip-hop life in the
vibrant streets of Harlem. In the Curtis Hanson-directed film, he
plays Future, the best friend of Eminem's character, Jimmy, in the
Three One Third rap crew. For Eminem -- a.k.a. Marshall Mathers --
the role of Jimmy presented a serious challenge: He had to bring his
significant presence to a whole new medium.</LD>
<LD>   For Phifer, this transition from streets to beats to film leads
came years earlier. At the age of 19, Phifer had never acted before
when his cousin dragged him to an open casting call for Spike Lee's
film "Clockers."</LD>
<TE>   Lacking a publicity photo of himself, Phifer popped into a
Woolworth's photo booth and brought a photo with him to the audition.
He beat out more than 1,000 actors to land a lead role, and his
performance in the 1995 film was impressive enough to launch a
successful acting career that has seen him star in 21 films,
including "O" and "Impostor" and add the role of Dr. Gregory Pratt on
"ER" this season.</TE>
<TE>   The intense rehearsal process for "8 Mile" fostered a tight
camaraderie among the cast that mirrored the bond shared within the
rival crews of rappers that are the film's focus.</TE>
<TE>   "We went to the malls, we went to the football games, we went to
the rap battles, we went out to the clubs and spent time with each
other and became friends," Phifer says. "All the experiences that
we've had together have been great and life-altering for all of us."</TE>
<TE>   His co-stars say Phifer's attitude was a major catalyst for the
sense of purpose in work and play that emerged on set and off during
filming.</TE>
<TE>   "Always if you did something good, he came up and slapped you on
the back," says Eugene Byrd, who plays Wink in "8 Mile." "He got
excited about the process, about us getting together and having fun."</TE>
<TE>   The cast remains close-knit and still hangs tight, months after
the film wrapped -- when their schedules permit, that is.</TE>
<TE>   "Omar Miller [who plays the character of Sol George] moved around
the corner from me out here in L.A.," says Malik Barnhardt, who plays
Moochie in "8 Mile" and has had roles alongside Phifer in "Brian's
Song" and the MTV hip-hopera "Carmen." "We're friends for life from
this movie. We're constantly talking about the next movie when we can
all come together."</TE>
<TE>   Uniting people with his goodwill and positive attitude is nothing
new for Phifer. Since his improbable rise to stardom in "Clockers,"
Phifer has made a point of giving outsiders a chance in the film
industry and building both his business affairs and posse of friends
on the basis of these relationships.</TE>
<TE>   Phifer founded his production company Ki-Kel Entertainment with
Kelly Hilaire, whom he met on a video shoot in 1996. He also met
Barnhardt, who was supposed to be an extra on the shoot that day,
hired him as a production assistant, and then helped him launch his
acting career. Phifer's partner in his Internet business mekhi.net is
Sly Phifer, his cousin who brought him to the "Clockers" audition.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a couple people hired on films as PAs and things like
that," Phifer says. "I'm not here to save the world. Another guy that
tried to do that, his name is Jesus, and look at what happened to
him."</TE>
<TE>   But no matter how far he soars beyond the "8 Mile" situation he
faced growing up in Harlem, like Eminem's character Jimmy he tries to
stay true to his roots and use his positive attitude to elevate
himself and his friends.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm definitely from a ghetto situation, but it has a lot of
culture, a lot of energy, a lot of raw talent," Phifer says.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no tricks, there's no gimmicks, there's no money, there's
no pyrotechnics, and that's what I love about being where I'm from.
You learn to just keep it real and go with what you know."</TE>

<KH>A NIGHT AT WINDOWS</KH>
<HD>Jazz at high elevation</HD>
<DH>Inviting, upscale location offers a great view and some
gifted performers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dean Kuipers</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tall, laid-back saxophonist Cal Bennett and his powerful quartet lay
into a rolling funk version of Miles Davis' "All Blues," and slowly
the true character of the room is revealed. This modal bop sound,
born in smoky basement clubs in the gritty core of urban America,
rolls around the orange-hued interior of Windows' dining room, high
atop downtown L.A.'s Transamerica Building, and then out through the
great glass walls, dissipating into the lights of L.A. winking far
below. Even Miles' compressed, urgent vibe succumbs to the sense of
infinite space here, relaxed by the room's elevated chill.</LD>
<LD>   Far from being a hipster hangout, Windows' new Saturday jazz
night, ongoing weekly since August, is strictly upscale. Top local
jazz acts like Bennett, there until Nov. 16, play only for diners
sitting down to chef Carlos Andrade's increasingly noted cuisine,
especially his mind-blowing filet and New York steaks. It's been
consistently sold out, but at $80 to $100 per couple for dinner, the
killer jazz is going to hurt for young swingers.</LD>
<LD>   But the jazz is only where the night starts. After 10:30, diners
and those who just come for drinks and dancing with an unbeatable
view pack into a late-night R&amp;B and funk DJ party in Windows' Sunset
Room.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a music crowd looking to go more upscale, to have dinner,
to go to a place with a dress code," says Fred Loc, partner in the
Highland Jazz Society, which has hosted long-running Saturday night
parties at Atlas, Chicago Bar &amp; Grill and Calypso before landing at
Windows.</TE>
<TE>   "But if you step into the other room after 10:30 or so, it's a
party," Loc says. "We sweat the windows out every weekend, people jam
the place until 2 a.m."</TE>
<TE>   The dining room scene, for its part, is chill but not sedate. Loc
and his partner DJ General Lee (the pair also bill themselves as
Worldwide Entertainment and also DJ Laker games, celeb parties and
many Staples events) like their jazz mean and simmering.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett, for instance, can hold back to let Windows diners gaze
out at the sun setting over the ocean miles away or the moon rising
over the San Gabriels, but even then his smooth, funk-inflected sound
is never saccharine or thin. After listening to his newest indie
album, "Cal Bennett Live at the Blue Note Las Vegas," seeing his
quartet here, driven by rock steady drummer Cedric Anderson, is like
watching a train pull away slowly: pure tension and potential. With
keyboardist Jerome Academia and Eddie Townes on six-string electric
fretless bass, Bennett moves through originals like "Glow in the
Dark" with the freshness of early-'70s George Benson or the
occasional funk of Steely Dan.</TE>
<TE>   Loc's experimenting more with danceable sounds in the dining room
too, looking to bring in Latin jazz bands in early 2003 for a get-up
salsa nights.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the diversity," says Loc. "I got a party of 40 Latin jazz
lovers coming in this weekend. There are people coming up here who
want hot salsa in a place with a dress code too. We can do that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

St.,. L.A.</TE>

<HD>In the land of gracious living</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anne Valdespino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Orange County we live a little more graciously. We like our
easy-access beaches, big backyards and malls with acres of
non-structure parking. Our club-going habits follow suit. We don't
get that "waiting for eternity behind the velvet rope" thing because
we refuse to stand in line for anything but hot Krispy Kreme
doughnuts or Easter service at the Crystal Cathedral.</LD>
<LD>   Accordingly, happy hour in O.C. is low-key. The scene might be
lively and standing room only, but it's generally non-attitudinal and
come-as-you-are, whether you just got off work in your blue pinstripe
suit or wandered in from the beach in sandy flip-flops and a damp
sundress.</LD>
<LD>   It's not about spiffing up to get past the doorman; it's about
unwinding for a few minutes or a few hours while reveling in our
laid-back lifestyle.</LD>
<TE>   A bit of paradise</TE>
<TE>   The California sun lights a view that could be mistaken for the
French Riviera. A cliff-side patio next to a rose garden hugs a bluff
above a brilliant blue Pacific. Pelicans glide by on the soft salt
air and, if you look carefully, you'll occasionally catch a dolphin's
fin breaking the surface of the water.</TE>
<TE>   Las Brisas in Laguna Beach is paradise for everyone but the
waitresses in Hawaiian print mini-dresses. They shuttle back and
forth from the bar to a patio with a fire ring and blue Mexican tile
counters.</TE>
<TE>   Happy-hour imbibers order margaritas on the rocks, Coronas, Cosmos
and green apple martinis as they snack on a buffet of chips, salsa,
veggies, dips, tacos, enchiladas, rice and beans.</TE>
<TE>   For a couple of women in their 20s, the ocean view, not the men,
is the big draw.</TE>
<TE>   "The best place for happy hour is anywhere by the beach," said
Kristin Maxwell, 25, of San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "That way, you can just look around if you have nothing to say."</TE>
<TE>   .</TE>
<TE>   After a day at the office</TE>
<TE>   If the Clubhouse in Costa Mesa were a day of the week, it would be
casual Friday. That's because it's part business, part play. Take
that dark wood and marble-topped bar with the leather accents.
Decadent, yes, but look up and you'll see a news ticker and CNN on
the big TV monitor. At the end of the bar there's a champagne bucket
filled with today's papers.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder it attracts guys and gals in Oxford shirts and slacks
who drop briefcases and cell phones for beer, wines by the glass and
all manner of martinis with names like Small Good Voodoo Daddy,
Colada-tini, Jack Lemon and Dean Martini.</TE>
<TE>   The music is canned Barry Manilow and Bruce Hornsby. The crowd
doesn't care. People are here to rehash their day at the office.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to hear my friends, not the music," said Robert Lizano of
Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   Miami rhapsody</TE>
<TE>   The crowd at Habana acts as if it's on an all-expenses-paid Miami
vacation. "Mo-JI-to!!!" they shout as the bartender mixes another
round. Huge glass jarras filled with mixers line the bar: Thin slices
of apple float in neon green liquid for the apple martinis; the lemon
drop potion looks like lemonade topped with fresh citrus slices.</TE>
<TE>   The bartenders mix Cuba Libres and made-to-order mojitos, muddling
the mint and lime in front of patrons, using a wooden pestle.</TE>
<TE>   There's a special bar menu, and appetizers from the dinner menu
are half-price. Among them: crab cakes made with black beans and corn
and rare ahi served with tostones (slices of plantain fried golden
brown and topped with avocado slices). The eats have a Nuevo
Latino-Caribbean twist that makes you feel like you're on a cruise.</TE>
<TE>   Artsy enclave</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Ana, they're dusting off grand old buildings to breathe
new life into downtown at the Artists Village. Storefront theaters,
galleries and new restaurants have sprung up, encouraging foot
traffic in and around the Santora Building, a Spanish colonial
treasure frosted with loads of baroque curlicues.</TE>
<TE>   But step inside and leave the 18th century architecture behind
during happy hour at Memphis, where you can soak in the swank '50s
mod-industrial decor. The best spot for happy hour is on the other
side of a brushed aluminum divider that snakes a curvy path along a
dark wood floor. Get settled on the comfortable green leather
banquette with burnt orange upholstered back. Order a mint julep and
get ready for soul food-fusion cuisine.</TE>

<HD>The hottest thing in warmup</HD>
<DH>DJ Kazell is one of the top openers in the business, a
master at setting mood and building suspense.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis Romero</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kazell arrives at Spundae's VIP tent and quickly hands over his guest
list, a crumpled half-sheet of paper containing six handwritten
names. Wearing a black polo shirt, gray khakis and black, hybrid
sport shoes, he rushes into the empty DJ booth and begins to shuffle
through his aluminum record box, coming up with a CD-R containing
ambient washes and drum-free synthetic brilliance.</LD>
<LD>   His sound is spread out from pretty, melodic tech-house (think
David Alvarado) to the tribal drums of modern progressive (Danny
Tenaglia) to the charging, psychedelic techno of Southern
California's Moontribe DJs (Brad, Daniel, Trevor, John Kelley), with
whom Kazell often plays. He spins the kinder, gentler genres during
warmups (he plays BT's vocal-trance hit "Mercury &amp; Solace" at Spundae
before handing off the decks to San Francisco's Jerry Bonham), but
rocks out when he's the headliner (sporting a goatee grin, Kazell
notches up the beats per minute and unleashes the sexed-up bass line
of Lemon8's "Lose Control" later at Insomnia).</LD>
<LD>   Kazell is an opener -- among the best, able to add suspense and
leave the climax to the headliner. It's not about grandstanding. It's
about creating the appetizer for the evening's journey.</LD>
<TE>   On this evening, Herman McClain, 27, is the first paying customer.
He hangs over the booth's railing and studies Kazell as he operates
the studio-size mixer, moving a level up a hair, tweaking the bass on
time as two records spin in sync. By 11 the floor is raving, fists
are shaking and more than 100 people wait in line outside. McClain,
an aspiring DJ who wears silver headphones around his neck, says he
takes a bus from Canoga Park each weekend to watch Kazell build the
dance floor from calm to thunderstorm.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen his last three sets, and he's really inspirational,"
says the video game store worker. "He will start really low. He has a
certain way of doing a build. He does long, funky mixes with lots of
tribal sounds."</TE>
<TE>   Kazell started spinning vinyl in his childhood bedroom in
Manchester, England, 12 years ago when "I should have been getting on
with my life and getting a job," the lanky, long-haired 30-year-old
says with a shrug. He has no regrets, however. He holds down Los
Angeles' most coveted DJ "residencies" at Spundae and with the roving
Liquified parties that are the Los Angeles home for British
cover-jocks Sasha &amp; John Digweed.</TE>
<TE>   At the Hollywood mega-club he had warmed up the turntables for
Carl Cox, often cited as the world's top club-circuit DJ. With one of
the West Coast's most prestigious DJ resumes, Kazell plans to build
on his rare record by touring more and producing his own tracks.
"He's really shy, and he's not really aggressive like other DJs,"
says GeorgeBennitez, longtime host of after-hours club Insomnia.</TE>
<TE>   Kazell was part of a small exodus of influential Brits, including
New York DJ DB, San Francisco's Wicked crew trio and Moonshine
Music's Levy brothers, who came to the United States at the dawn of
the '90s after English rave culture became overshadowed by gangs,
drugs and violence.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a dark place, man," Kazell says. "It's a scary thing when
you go out in Manchester. I got mugged a couple of times." He grew up
on Happy Mondays, student nights at the Hacienda and hip-hop,
although his teen-age fancy soon turned to spinning up-tempo "funky
breaks," a raved-up blend of house and rap. His mother was a
university lecturer and his father owned an office cleaning firm, but
Kevin Bazell -- his birth name -- forsook higher ed in favor of
taking off for America with Manchester bud Damian Murphy in 1991. The
two helped bring fledgling DJs Sasha and Digweed to the Southeast
with roving Liquid Groove parties in Miami, Orlando, Fla., Atlanta
and Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Little did they know that the duo would become the biggest names
in worldwide mix-CD sales by the millennium. The relationship endured
as Kazell and Murphy moved to Los Angeles in the mid-'90s, slotting
Kazell as the L.A. opener for Digweed and giving Murphy's renamed
Liquified parties a virtual lock on the pair's area appearances.</TE>
<TE>   About two years ago, Kazell went to a newly opened vinyl shop
asking for work as a buyer, and he ended up with another prized
warmup job, this one at Spundae, a mandatory stop for jet-set jocks.</TE>
<TE>   Neil Thomas, owner of the late Global Grooves record store on
Santa Monica's Main Street and a partner in Spundae Worldwide, was
one of the principals who gave Kazell that shot at the 1,800-capacity
club. "I have to have opening DJs who know how to warm up properly,"
Thomas says. "He's opened up for all the greats. He takes the time to
research.... He takes the music very, very seriously."</TE>
<TE>   While Kazell appreciates the icy aggression of the Mancunian
sound, he feels his mesmerizing blends and break-beat roots represent
the toasted West Coast more than the industrial north of England.</TE>
<TE>   "The Moontribe guys influenced me," he says. "Doc Martin
influenced me. DJ Dan, he influenced me. I thought his was unlike any
house I've ever heard before -- West Coast funk. There seems to be a
deeper level of interest in California. If you look for something
deeper, more spiritual, you can find it here."</TE>

<LD>"In Absentia," the new album from British band Porcupine Tree, is a
radio programmer's delight, but most radio programmers don't know
about it yet. A brooding journey into space-rock, the album moves
from gorgeous acoustic ruminations to sharp heavy-metal stabs and
flighty ambient experiments that echo Radiohead. So why, aside from
the band's cult following, isn't anyone listening? Porcupine Tree is
a prog-rock band, that's why, and that tag is tainted with the worst
excesses of '70s arena rock: men in Mylar capes playing Mellotron
keyboards while dry ice vapors billow up from their silver platform
shoes.</LD>
<LD>   "The true definition of prog-rock is that it's a style of music
that can incorporate any genre of music," says Porcupine Tree leader
Steven Wilson. "But I have ambivalence about using the term. A lot of
people tend to think of it as music that was made 30 years ago."</LD>
<LD>   In the '70s, progressive rock was massive. British bands Yes,
Genesis, and Emerson, Lake and Palmer toyed with conventional rock
notions of time and space, writing epic compositions with symphonic
sweep and odd meters that filled football stadiums with loyalists all
over the world. Other venturesome bands -- King Crimson, Focus,
Gentle Giant -- didn't sell as many albums but attracted large,
worshipful fan bases.</LD>
<TE>   Welcome back, my friends, to the show that never ends. Thanks to
an underground that has nurtured new bands and rallied support for
old ones, prog-rock is making a return.</TE>
<TE>   For those who like their rock songs to stretch beyond three
minutes, flash some accomplished technique and move into
unpredictable musical terrain, the new prog-rock is a godsend. Not
all of it clicks, of course -- there are those bands that would
rather ape the classics than try anything new -- but the best of the
neo-proggers, such as Maudlin of the Well and Cancer Conspiracy, are
redefining what it means to be prog in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Even mainstream bands are betraying their prog-rock roots. A
sprawling concept album like the Flaming Lips' "Yoshimi Battles the
Pink Robots" owes a debt to old-school Genesis, and despite leader
Thom Yorke's protestations to the contrary, Radiohead's recent work
is striated with Pink Floyd's head-rock drone.</TE>
<TE>   The fans of the new prog-rock tend to be either nostalgists
looking for a way to bring back the past or younger advocates who
found prog-rock in the sprawling art-metal suites of Megadeth and
Metallica.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, Rick Wakeman represents everything that's wrong with
prog-rock," says Mike Thaxton, 27, referring to the Yes keyboardist.
Thaxton is a Metallica fan and co-organizer of this year's second
annual ProgWest festival, a two-day event this weekend in Claremont.
Thaxton's ProgWest partner, 47-year-old Bob Rosenthal, thinks
otherwise. "I'm looking to relive those glory days," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Both camps, however, are united in their disdain for contemporary
rock's failure to think big. A hunger for epic music is being fed by
a thriving network of bands, festivals and Web sites devoted to the
new prog-rock movement.</TE>
<TE>   The contemporary prog-rock landscape is multifarious. There are
bands such as Spock's Beard and the Flower Kings that attempt to
create the pastoral beauty of Yes. Maudlin of the Well leans toward
the death-metal squall of Slayer but with folk undercurrents.
Azigza's tricky fusion is a nod to guitarist John McLaughlin's
influential '70s prog-jazz band Mahavishnu Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   It's not only about new bands. A clutch of vintage proggers has
been brought back to life by the movement. Seventies German band
Nektar and the Italian prog-rockers Museo Rosenbach, who released one
(very collectible) album during their brief career, have been lured
out of retirement to play at various prog-rock festivals. "You've got
a lot of unbelievably obscure bands from the '70s who realize there
are 4,000 people they can target directly over the Internet," Thaxton
says. "The impact of the Internet on this movement has been huge."</TE>
<TE>   The new prog-rock movement began in the early '90s, right around
the time that Nirvana was making punk safe for mall rats. "In the
early '90s, most prog-rock bands were considered dinosaur bands,"
Rosenthal says. "Grunge was doing its thing. Even big bands like
Aerosmith were having trouble."</TE>
<TE>   But a nascent prog-rock scene began to emerge, made whole by the
Web. The first ProgFest, held at UCLA's Royce Hall in 1993, ignited a
spark. Soon prog-rock festivals sprouted all over the country. Now
there is a large network of artist- and fan-driven Web sites and a
thriving festival circuit.</TE>
<TE>   "The fans are real, and they care about the music," says L.A.
native Neal Morse, the former leader of Spock's Beard. One of
neo-prog's most popular bands, Spock's Beard contacts its fan base
with a Web site that Morse had run. "The Web has completely changed
my life," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "The coolest part of being in this band has been talking to people
after we've played," says IZZ guitarist John Galgano, who, like every
other new prog artist, was changed inalterably upon hearing Genesis
and Yes for the first time as a teenager. "That's what it's all
about; no one's in this to make money right now."</TE>
<TE>   At its best, prog-rock functions with open ears, folding in
contemporary sounds. Steven Wilson, who is regarded as something of a
role model among the younger prog-rock artists, incorporates heavy
metal, folk and electronic elements on Porcupine Tree's "In
Absentia." "If you're going to be prog in 2002, you should
incorporate things like trip-hop in your music," Wilson says.</TE>
<TE>   Prog-rock, according to Rosenthal, is present in the music of
critically acclaimed bands like Sigur Ros and Mogwai, yet the bands
themselves won't cop to the label. When prog-rock can finally emerge
from the shadows without shame, Rosenthal claims, the movement will
reign triumphant.</TE>
<TE>   "Bands like Mercury Rev and Mogwai, that's not prog-rock?"
Rosenthal asks. "Just once, I'd like to see a band like Radiohead
come out and say, 'Hi, we're prog.' "</TE>

<LD>The place</LD>
<LD>   An oasis of African American culture, Los Angeles is lucky to have
Leimert Park. One of the city's rare walking districts, it is a haven
for artists, poets and musicians, who have numerous outlets for their
crafts and creations in the various galleries, shops and performance
spaces.</LD>
<LD>   Where to find it</LD>
<TE>   South Central Los Angeles. Anchored by Leimert Park on its south
end, it is bounded by Crenshaw Boulevard to the west, Leimert
Boulevard to the east and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to the
north.</TE>
<TE>   The main drag</TE>
<TE>   The 4300 block of Degnan Boulevard has more culture per square
inch than most neighborhoods in the city. A mecca of African
Americana, it's packed with art galleries, eateries and shops, as
well as jazz clubs.</TE>
<TE>   The arts</TE>
<TE>   The storefront studio Dance Collective offers classes in a variety
of disciplines -- from West African to Cuban to salsa. Classes often
fill and spill over onto the sidewalk, turning practice into
performance. Sunday afternoons, a drum circle forms to pound out
beats in the park. The Museum in Black is a treasure trove of African
and African American history. The front room is jammed with statues,
masks, pottery and instruments from all parts of Africa; the back is
loaded with 5,000 pieces of black memorabilia, much of it from the
slavery era. Gallery Plus offers contemporary African American art
and books. The Zambezi Bazaar features ethnic jewelry and clothing,
with a pretty great selection of vintage jazz vinyl and rare books
upstairs. For handmade jewelry, visit Sika. For stained glass and
mosaics, peek inside Ramsess Glass.</TE>
<TE>   Nightlife</TE>
<TE>   Largely regarded as the best blues bar in the city, the
40-year-old Babe's &amp; Ricky's Inn once played host to blues legends
B.B. King and John Lee Hooker. These days, live acts perform five
nights a week. For jazz, poetry and spoken-word performances, visit
the legendary World Stage or Lucy Florence Coffee House. The Regency
West Theater is a supper club, playing host to theatrical and comedy
performances. Thursday nights, Project Blowed opens its doors to
aspiring rappers.</TE>
<TE>   Great eats</TE>
<TE>   Authentic soul food is around almost every corner. Check out the
Kitchen or M&amp;M's for some of the best in the area. The smell of
mesquite will lead you to Phillip's, a hole-in-the-wall barbecue
joint that serves to-die-for baby-back ribs and fixins. The Jerk Pit
makes excellent and reasonably priced Jamaican fast food. And La
Fuente del Sabor cooks up authentic Mexican and Salvadoran fare in a
festive and colorful environment.</TE>
<TE>   History</TE>
<TE>   The area is named after William H. Leimert, a real estate
developer who purchased 240 acres there in 1927. Predominantly a
white neighborhood, its demographics began to shift after 1942, when
President Franklin D. Roosevelt desegregated manufacturing plants.
Local government began to neglect the neighborhood, contributing to
its decline. Following the 1992 riots, a coalition formed to develop
the area into what it is today.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Frenchman with curls longer than mine spots me inside the Coffee
Bean on Main Street and chases me for two blocks in Santa Monica
because, after 10 years of living in Los Angeles, he has learned that
destiny could use a little help. Steve Martin addressed this
loveless-Angeleno phenomenon when he wrote in "L.A. Story": "It's not
like New York where you meet people walking down the street. In L.A.,
you practically have to hit someone with your car." Or, in the style
of an open Frenchman, become an urban Forrest Gump, dashing through
beach traffic and around window-shopping pedestrians, to make your
point.</LD>
<LD>   So, on a sunny September afternoon, in this car town of millions,
where chance meetings are as rare as natural breasts, the Frenchman
spins it this way: "We do not live in a village. If I don't come
running after you, we'd probably never see each other again."</LD>
<LD>   After three years -- and counting -- of the singles scene in Los
Angeles, I can appreciate the romanticism in his foreign stride.</LD>
<TE>   With so many people, of so many backgrounds, living in one city,
why is finding a special someone so challenging? Does the smog cloud
our judgment and block our hearts? If we are all in search of the
One, shouldn't a lot of "ones" have found each other by now?</TE>
<TE>   I stop and listen to the Frenchman -- not because I am so
interested, but because that's what you do when a man comes running
at you, full speed, yelling your name. (He overheard it at the coffee
shop.) He tells me he's a French teacher and offers to meet me
sometime over coffee so we could practice our French together. I tell
him I am taking a long break. Staring at my vanilla latte, he asks,
"A break from coffee? You have one in your hand."</TE>
<TE>   "A break from men. Not just you, all of you."</TE>
<TE>   "Ah," he says gently. "I understand. I have been through a lot of
bad times with my ex-girlfriend. Can't we be friends?"</TE>
<TE>   Ay ay ay, the question that Harry and Sally debated for an entire
movie but never quite answered. Instantly, the confrontational Cuban
reporter in me demands: "Why do you want to be my friend?"</TE>
<TE>   The Frenchman is baffled. In his country, people value and look
forward to these gestures. But here, in Santa Monica, something is
very wrong with the woman he thought was cute enough for an urban
chase. He steps away but then comes back: "Your spirit and your smile
moved me. I cannot explain these things. I just ran."</TE>
<TE>   I like his answer, so I tell him he can give me his number if he
wants to. As he jots it down, he mumbles that he knows I will never
use it.</TE>
<TE>   Driving up the coast toward Malibu later that afternoon, I think
about fate and choices. Is the road to love completely paved by
destiny or do mere mortals play a hand by seizing or missing
opportunities? In a town where those who are the best at pretending
seem to have the most success, is finding genuine love impossible? As
I get out of my car at Zuma Beach and see a couple cuddling on a
blanket, I remember something else Steve Martin said about finding
the love of your life in Los Angeles: "There is someone for everyone
even if you need a pickax, a compass and night goggles to find them."</TE>
<TE>   Then I think of the Frenchman, and the natural course of love in
countries where family and friendship are celebrated more than money,
ambition or celebrity, places where meaningful connections between
people are everything.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe my Saturday afternoon sprinter was onto something. Maybe it
does take a village.</TE>

<DH>Undaunted by age or injury, armchair quarterbacks are the
backbone of their favorite teams.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anne Valdespino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the final minutes of the game, when your team is down to its last
ounce of strength, with no remaining timeouts and nothing left but
hope, who can you count on? The armchair quarterback, that's who. In
the height of football season, that overstuffed recliner is hallowed
ground. Pets, kids and spouses make way, it's time to get serious
about being a fan again.</LD>
<LD>   Take it from Tom Arnold, the voice of the fan on Fox Sports Net's
"Best Damned Sports Show Period." A dedicated armchair QB, he's
turned the pastime into a profession, faithfully watching games
surrounded by a huge collection of sports memorabilia, which includes
hundreds of baseball caps with logos of pro teams, a football
autographed by the 1939 Heisman Trophy winner, Iowa halfback Nile
Kinnick, and the cap the New York Yankees' David Wells wore in the
'98 World Series.</LD>
<LD>   And you better believe he concentrates on the game. When we
interviewed him on the phone Saturday, he did not take his eyes off
the game, although he did look up and express his gratitude when the
wife brought in food. He then talked about his approach to armchair
quarterbacking. He said it's better than being a real QB because
you'll never be sidelined by age or injury. "Athletes can only play
for so long, but a fan can be a fan forever."</LD>
<TE>   What is the sacred duty of the armchair quarterback?</TE>
<TE>   You have to be there for your team. So, if you happen to be
standing up and the team's doing well, you have to remain standing
for the rest of the game. Once the Lakers were losing to Sacramento.
I went outside to smoke a cigar and they started coming back -- so I
had to stay outside for the rest of the game. You don't want to be
the one who jinxed your team.</TE>
<TE>   Tell us about your throne.</TE>
<TE>   It's a designer chair I picked up at Sharper Image. It's black
leather and my wife hates it because it doesn't "go" with anything.
It's a massage chair and a recliner. You're getting your butt worked
on and you're watching the team. You've got a remote for the chair
and a remote for the TV. It's the best of all worlds.</TE>
<TE>   Where do you watch the game?</TE>
<TE>   In my office upstairs. It's the only place in the house that I'm
allowed to smoke cigars. When I'm watching the game, life beyond this
office does not exist.</TE>
<TE>   Who do you root for?</TE>
<TE>   The Hawkeyes. That's my team because I grew up in Iowa. The New
York Giants is another.</TE>
<TE>   And obviously the Lakers -- I have to, I live in Beverly Hills and
Shaq is my next-door neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   What's your favorite armchair chow?</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes I will have the giant Fritos with bean dip. And I like
meat. I have mini cheeseburgers; that way you can eat 12 or 14 and
not feel so bad.</TE>
<TE>   Do you worry about spills?</TE>
<TE>   The problem is I don't. I'm not allowed to watch sports in bed
anymore because I got ketchup and jelly on the silk sheets. That's
really hard to blame on the dogs.</TE>
<TE>   What's the difference between an armchair QB and a regular fan?</TE>
<TE>   You have more responsibility. You feel that you can do something
spiritually -- through prayer or whatever -- that can get your team
over the hump.</TE>
<TE>   Any words of armchair wisdom?</TE>
<TE>   Don't let people put you down. We have an important role and if
other people can't appreciate it, feel sorry for them. You can't tell
me that the Angels would have won without the fans. The rally monkey
is one thing, but it was really all those armchair QBs, pounding
thunder sticks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The chairs</TE>
<TE>   Harris Scott 1803 recliner</TE>
<TE>   Description/options: Stainless-steel rivets. Available in rocker
and swivel rocker.</TE>
<TE>   Colors: Green, brown, blue and wine.</TE>
<TE>   On the Web: furniturefind.com</TE>
<TE>   Price: $449</TE>
<TE>   Perfect for: Joe Montana, retired 49ers QB. A no-nonsense chair
with heavy-gauge construction that can take a beating and come back
again and again. For all the times we wondered if the
severely-injured-but-never-say-die Montana would ever hang up his
helmet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winston, a recliner by Lane Home Furnishings</TE>
<TE>   Description/options: High-leg recliner with cherry finish and
nailhead trim. Queen Anne design with wingback styling and rolled
arms and ball-and-claw legs. The ottoman extends from beneath.</TE>
<TE>   Finishes: In fabrics including velvet, leather and vinyl.</TE>
<TE>   On the Web: www.lanefurniture.com</TE>
<TE>   Price: $899.99</TE>
<TE>   Perfect for: Former Dallas Cowboys QB Troy Aikman. The soft-spoken
star, who drove a pickup and was never known for dancing in the end
zone, might like this recliner that doesn't look like a recliner.
This elegantly understated chair has a sneaky foot rest hidden
underneath.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York glider and ottoman from Relax-R Recliners</TE>
<TE>   Description/options: Three-motion glider/recliner/swivel with
matching ottoman.</TE>
<TE>   Colors: Burgundy, black, chestnut, surf, adobe. Or in faux
leathers: cobblestone, nubuck, brown, black.</TE>
<TE>   On the Web: www.relax-r-chair.com</TE>
<TE>   Price: $699 to $1,099, plus $49 for shipping.</TE>
<TE>   Perfect for: John Elway, retired Denver Broncos QB. Remember when
Elway refused to sign with the Colts? And the time he almost retired
only to come back and lead his team to a Super Bowl victory in 1998?
With its three-way glide/recline/swivel function, this is the ideal
chair for the dude who just can't make up his mind.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Crandell recliner from La-Z-Boy</TE>
<TE>   Description/options:</TE>
<TE>   "Easygoing, casual looks." Jumbo proportions. Extra tall rocker
base. Extension leg rest. Can get with massage and heat.</TE>
<TE>   Colors: Red, rust, green, oyster, brown, blue, aqua, plaid.
Leather available.</TE>
<TE>   On the Web: www.Lazboy.com</TE>
<TE>   Price: $1,059 to $1,239.</TE>
<TE>   Perfect for: Dan Marino, retired Miami Dolphins QB. Jumbo
proportions fit the 6-foot-4 Marino and the price tag fits his
confident, even cocky personality. Remember his cameo in "Ace
Ventura: Pet Detective"? Massage will soothe the guy who broke all
the records and still lost the Super Bowl in 1985. The heat feature
will come in handy with his host of injuries: knees, neck, ankle and
Achilles tendon.</TE>

<HD>'Frontline' searches for truth in troubled spots</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Sachs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's an ongoing game of cat-and-mouse, of hide-and-seek, of
truth-or-dare, where fingers are pointed and shrill voices shout out
claims of "Liar!" to anyone who will listen.</LD>
<LD>   But this scenario isn't being played out in the schoolyard down
the street but on a growing number of locales on the world stage, two
of which are examined in tonight's disturbing episode of the PBS
series "Frontline/World" (9 p.m. on KCET, 10 p.m. on KVCR).</LD>
<LD>   First stop is Iraq, where reports of weapons building has led to a
relentless Bush administration campaign calling for inspections of
the country's manufacturing facilities. But "Frontline" correspondent
Sam Kiley tries a different approach, seeking permission to enter
Baghdad to ferret out the truth behind rumors of human rights
violations that have allegedly taken the form of periodic beheadings
of Iraqi women on the city streets.</LD>
<TE>   It's largely a mission in frustration, as Kiley is intimidated,
bullied and finally tossed out, and an exchange with an Iraqi citizen
reveals what he's up against. When the citizen is asked if he
supports the country's leader, he replies, "I always support Saddam
Hussein because he's an Arab."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," says Kiley, "but you can have good Arabs and bad Arabs."</TE>
<TE>   "No," replies the man. "The worst Arab is better than any American
or Zionist or British."</TE>
<TE>   The second segment shows an Occidental Oil pipeline in Colombia
that is blown up so often by rebels protesting U.S. exploitation that
it operates only one day in five.</TE>
<TE>   But the rebels' hit-and-run attacks are also spilling oil into
local farms and rivers, making the Colombians the other losers in
this game.</TE>

<LD>"The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"</LD>
<LD>   Kieran Culkin, Emile Hirsch</LD>
<LD>   Columbia TriStar, $28</LD>
<TE>   This is an offbeat and thought-provoking coming-of-age story based
on the novel by the late Chris Furhman about the friendship between
two Catholic schoolboys (Culkin and Hirsch) who are always causing
mischief. Their lives take a tragic turn when they steal a statute of
the Virgin Mary from the school.</TE>
<TE>   The decent DVD includes an "Anatomy of a Scene" episode from the
Sundance Channel series, interviews with the cast and filmmakers,
deleted scenes, interesting commentary from Todd McFarlane on the
animation scenes, and breezy commentary with director Peter Care and
writer Jeff Stockwell.</TE>

<TE>   "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya  Sisterhood"</TE>
<TE>   Sandra Bullock and Ellen Burstyn</TE>
<TE>   Warner Home Video, $23 for VHS; $27 for DVD</TE>
<TE>   Callie Khouri, who won an Oscar in 1991 for her screenplay for
"Thelma &amp; Louise," made her directorial debut with this "women's
picture" based on Rebecca Wells' best-selling novel about the bonds
between female friends and mothers and daughters. It boasts some
engaging performances from Burstyn, Bullock, Maggie Smith, Shirley
Knight and Ashley Judd. But Khouri doesn't seem to know when to end
scenes, so the film is overlong and labored.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition is available in wide- and full-screen and
features additional scenes, a documentary on the "page-to-screen
journey" and an interactive scrapbook featuring clips from the film
and interviews with the actresses talking about their characters. The
disc also features two passable commentaries: one with Khouri and
Judd, the other with Khouri, producers Bonnie Bruckheimer and Hunt
Lowry, executive producer Lisa Stewart, editor Andrew Marcus and
composer T-Bone Burnett.</TE>

<LD>'Turnbuckle' double takes</LD>
<LD>   A wonderfully idiosyncratic sculptor, Bill McEwen, has a habit of
inspiring double takes.</LD>
<LD>   It's not only that his work tends to be a perplexing and
intriguing blend of ideas at once raw and rational, funky and
technophile. There is also the matter of strange contexts adding fizz
to his art, whether with his large public sculpture placed in front
of the Ventura Government Center in the mid-'90s or the quirky
compound structures fixed to the outside wall of the Buenaventura
Gallery. He also had a one-person show there more recently, with
sculptural gizmos spreading their metal tentacles around and on the
inside walls of the gallery.</LD>
<TE>   McEwen's current cause for pleasant alarm greets the visitor to
the Upstairs Gallery at Natalie's Fine Threads. Regulars making the
trek upstairs will find the large, audacious piece he calls
"Turnbuckle 22: Secondary Triad, Orange, Greens and Violets." If the
title sounds like a blend of the scientific, the artistic and the
hardware-related, it's for a reason.</TE>
<TE>   Filling, and screwed directly into, the wall at the top of the
stairway is a site-specific work full of the usual McEwen elements.
Organic-shaped blocks are painted thickly with non-shy colors, and
the structure is held together with metal apparatuses, including
poles, cables, huge bolts and other implements of construction. It's
something to see.</TE>
<TE>   Farther into the gallery, we find smaller pieces, looking
Lilliputian by comparison but with the same approach and the same
tendency to latch onto the wall of the host art space. Again, McEwen
relies on nuts and bolts to do his aesthetic bidding, mixed with
conventional surfaces gooped up with paint and a stubborn, admirable
insistence on going his own way.</TE>
<TE>   His contrasting gallery mate, Arline Tepper, is a sobering
counterweight to his outlandishness and a more conventional sculptor.
Her sleek alabaster sculptures blend smooth, sinuous contours and
occasional rough textures, pointing up the essential nature of the
stone, in a polished state and otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Camerata kickoff</TE>
<TE>   The Ojai Camerata has had its ups and downs over the years, with a
musical-chair shift of directors, but a will to survive and celebrate
chamber music in the area has held the organization in good stead
despite the odds. New to the director post is Wynant Morton, chair of
the Cal Lutheran music department, who will lead a premiere-stocked
program this weekend to open "A Season of Firsts."</TE>
<TE>   On the program are new works by Ojai-based Gregory Haggard as well
as Leslie Hogan and Linda Holland, both of whom are behind the
"Current Sounds" new music series in Santa Barbara and Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   These pieces refer, in some way, to the tragedy of Sept. 11, 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Yet another new work on the program is "Life Rounded With Sleep,"
by Connecticut-based composer Kevin Isaacs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Centennial nod</TE>
<TE>   Richard Rodgers, the great American songsmith whose work with
Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein gave us a trove of classics, would
have turned 100 this year.</TE>
<TE>   It's a ripe time for a toast, including here on the Ventura County
scene, courtesy of the Backlot Theater.</TE>
<TE>   For the occasion, the Thousand Oaks company is serving up a
lesser-known late-period Rodgers musical, "Two by Two," a seriocomic
take on the Noah's Ark saga. Based on Clifford Odets' "The Flowering
Peach," the musical features lyrics by Martin Charmin and book by
Peter Stone.</TE>
<TE>   This production is directed by Paul Marquie, with musical
direction by Nancy Monson. The Noah in question is Don Pearlman, with
key roles also going to Eleanor Brand, Jim Harlow and Steve Perren.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia Suit Accuses Deloitte of Negligence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp. sued its former accountants Wednesday,
accusing Deloitte &amp; Touche of failing to report "self-dealing and
financial chicanery" by founder John Rigas and family members that
sent the cable television company spiraling into Bankruptcy Court.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit accuses Deloitte of professional negligence and breach
of its contract.</LD>
<LD>   "These wrongful acts resulted in billions of dollars in damages to
the company -- damages which were preventable if Deloitte had acted
consistently with its professional responsibilities as Adelphia's
outside auditor," the lawsuit states.</LD>
<TE>   Though not naming a specific damage amount, the lawsuit seeks
compensation for resulting injury to the company as well as punitive
damages.</TE>
<TE>   Deloitte representatives did not immediately return a call
Wednesday seeking comment on the lawsuit, filed in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Rigas, Adelphia's founder; his sons Timothy, 46, and Michael, 48;
and two other executives were indicted by a federal grand jury in
September on charges of securities fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia, which has more than 5.7 million cable television
subscribers, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection June 25.</TE>
<TE>   The company fired Deloitte &amp; Touche as its auditor June 9.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit says the accounting firm should have been aware of
abuses, such as the $3.1 billion in debt run up by Rigas family
enterprises under loan agreements that left Adelphia liable in the
event of a default.</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleges that Deloitte &amp; Touche, which also provided
auditing services for private Rigas family entities, knew about the
family's dealings but failed to reveal the information.</TE>
<TE>   "If the board and the audit committee had been informed of the
misconduct of the Rigas family," the lawsuit states, "they could
have, and would have, acted to stop and remedy the misconduct."</TE>

<HD>In Search of Broad Technological Compatibility</HD>
<DH>Regulators will look into ways of sharing airwaves to be
used in many wireless devices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jube Shiver Jr.</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Cell phones, remote controls, wireless radios -- can't
they all just get along?</LD>
<LD>   Federal regulators believe so, and they are expected today to
launch a sweeping examination of the government's management of the
nation's valuable airwaves, a move that could pave the way for
cheaper and more innovative wireless devices.</LD>
<LD>   At their monthly meeting, members of the Federal Communications
Commission are scheduled to consider a highly anticipated report on
spectrum management that recommends a more flexible approach to
sharing the airwaves, including an overhaul of the standards for
governing airwave interference and provisions to allow owners of
airwave licenses to resell them under certain circumstances.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, the agency also is expected to authorize the opening
up of more airwaves for advanced wireless services.</TE>
<TE>   Although the report is still being fine-tuned and may not be
released until later this month, its emergence represents the first
significant response to a nearly decade-long push for more flexible
use of the airwaves by companies such as Intel Corp. and Microsoft
Corp., free-speech advocates and influential thinkers such as
Stanford University law professor Lawrence Lessig.</TE>
<TE>   They say the airwaves should be treated like the Internet, an open
communications system that nobody owns. They want the nearly
70-year-old system of government regulation of the airwaves modified
so that individuals and entrepreneurs would be free to use and trade
any spectrum, so long as they did not interfere with other users.</TE>
<TE>   But some powerful wireless industry lobbying groups -- which also
are longtime supporters of spectrum reform -- are concerned that the
FCC may not pay enough attention to potential interference problems.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to see the specifics," said Thomas Wheeler, president of
the Cellular Telecommunications &amp; Internet Assn. in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Among other details, Wheeler said the FCC would have to wrestle
with how to police interference among rivals trying to gain a
competitive advantage. "There needs to be some kind of strong
sanction, not just a fine" against users that cause airwave
interference, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of a more flexible approach say deregulation will
enable more innovative wireless devices and boost wireless networking
technologies such as WiFi and ultra-wide-band, which have helped spur
demand for wireless networks for PCs and other machines. Shipments of
equipment for wireless networking are expected to balloon from 9
million units in 2001 to about 56 million by 2006, according to the
research group Allied Business Intelligence Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Experts believe that with deregulation, WiFi and ultra-wideband
could leapfrog the deployment of high-speed Internet access through
phone and cable-TV lines, making cheap and ubiquitous broadband
access available nationwide by 2006.</TE>
<TE>   University of Pennsylvania professors Gerald R. Faulhaber and
David J. Farber say a good way to kick off this new wireless era
would be to conduct a one-time "big bang auction" for all the
nation's airwaves and then allow secondary trading of the spectrum.</TE>
<TE>   "Individuals and corporations would be able to buy, sell and lease
specific frequencies in specific locations subject to power [and
other technical] limitations, and would possess the right to ...
[transmit] at anytime without interference," they wrote in a July
filing to the FCC.</TE>
<TE>   FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell didn't return a call seeking
comment. But he signaled last week that spectrum reform will be a
cornerstone of his effort to revive the beleaguered telecom industry.</TE>
<TE>   "We should develop policies that avoid interference rules that are
barriers to entry," he said during an address at the University of
Colorado in Boulder. "While the proliferation of technology strains
the old paradigm, it is also technology that will ultimately free
spectrum from its former shackles."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign has gathered steam in recent months, spurred by
industry advances.</TE>
<TE>   A technology called software defined radio, or SDR, was authorized
by the FCC last year and is being used to develop intelligent
transceivers that can navigate through the congested airwaves without
causing electro-magnetic interference.</TE>
<TE>   SDR allows telecom service providers to offer devices that can
jump from one communications channel to another as transmission
standards change and as unused airwaves become available.</TE>
<TE>   Such flexibility would be especially valuable in the United
States, which -- unlike Europe and Asia -- has more than four
competing cellular phone standards as well as a host of wireless
computer network standards. Engineers envision a day when a cell
phone or hand-held computer will automatically reprogram itself to
access all of these networks and even act as a TV remote or pager.</TE>
<TE>   "SDR can mitigate the downsides of having multiple wireless
transmission standards by making more efficient use of spectrum,"
said Vanu Bose, chief executive of Vanu Inc., a Cambridge, Mass.,
start-up that will demonstrate a software defined radio device later
this month in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, several bills have been introduced to promote
airwave reform, including a measure by Rep. Edward J. Markey
(D-Mass.) that would more than double the amount of spectrum
available for unregulated wireless services such as WiFi.</TE>
<TE>   "Spectrum reform is coming this year one way or another -- whether
through legislation or through the FCC," said Ellen Goodman, an
associate professor of law at Rutgers University who has followed the
issue.</TE>

<HD>Amgen Shares Fall 7.7% After Downgrade</HD>
<DH>Analyst says sales of three of the biotech firm's key drugs
may fall short of expectations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Denise Gellene</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Amgen Inc., the world's largest biotechnology company,
dropped Wednesday after an analyst downgraded the stock and cited
concerns about three of the company's key drugs.</LD>
<LD>   Amgen's shares closed down 7.7% after a report by UBS Warburg's
Meirev Chovav said there was "limited upside potential" in stock of
the industry bellwether.</LD>
<LD>   Her report followed a decision by Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks,
to postpone until February a meeting in New York with analysts that
had been scheduled for Nov. 21.</LD>
<TE>   Most analysts on Wall Street recommend that investors buy Amgen
stock. But Chovav cut her rating to "hold" from "buy" and said sales
of three drugs may fall short of expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Chovav said Wall Street estimates of $1.3 billion in sales for the
rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel are too high because approval of
Humira, a competing drug from Abbott Laboratories, could come before
the end of the year -- four months sooner than expected.</TE>
<TE>   She said $1.1 billion represents the "best-case scenario" for
Enbrel sales in 2003 and it assumes that a factory in Rhode Island
will receive FDA approval in the first quarter of next year. The
factory, needed to ease a shortage of Enbrel, is scheduled for an FDA
inspection next week.</TE>
<TE>   Chovav said last week's decision by the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services to lower the hospital outpatient payment rates for
Aranesp will limit sales of the drug.</TE>
<TE>   She said Aranesp, a second-generation anemia treatment, will be
reimbursed at a disadvantage to Procrit, which is marketed by Johnson
&amp; Johnson under a license from Amgen. She estimated that Procrit will
be reimbursed at 68.2% of its average wholesale price, while Aranesp
would be reimbursed at 47.6% of its average wholesale price. The
hospital outpatient market accounts for 10% of Aranesp's current
sales.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Chovav said that as much as $74 million in excess
inventories of Neupogen may have accumulated in the second and third
quarters, and that will result in lower fourth-quarter sales of the
drug. Neupogen is used to prevent infections in cancer patients whose
immune systems are compromised by chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen spokesman Jeff Richardson said sales of Neupogen are driven
by demand. "We don't see any inventory issues."</TE>
<TE>   Amgen, in a statement late Tuesday, said it postponed its meeting
with analysts because it couldn't fully address concerns about
Enbrel, Aranesp and a patent lawsuit with Transkaryotic Therapies of
Cambridge, Mass. An appeals court decision is due soon in the case
involving Epogen, Amgen's best-selling drug. Richardson wouldn't
elaborate on the statement.</TE>
<TE>   S.G. Cowan analyst Eric Schmidt said Amgen had legitimate reasons
to postpone its meeting and that investors overreacted to the news.
The timing was awkward, considering next week's factory inspection,
he said. And Amgen probably wasn't ready to discuss its strategy on
Medicare reimbursement, which he expects Amgen to fight on a
"legislative, legal and lobbying level."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview this week, Amgen Chairman and Chief Executive
Kevin W. Sharer said he was "cautiously optimistic" that the factory
in West Greenwich, R.I., would receive FDA approval in first-quarter
2003. Amgen has stuck by that forecast since it announced the
$9.6-billion purchase of Immunex, developer of Enbrel, last December.</TE>
<TE>   Sharer said that although the company was "comfortable" with the
deadline last year, meeting it will be a "heroic" accomplishment due
to problems later discovered at the factory Amgen acquired in the
Immunex deal.</TE>
<TE>   Sharer said Amgen did its due diligence before buying Immunex and
taking on the factory project, but likened the process to buying a
car: "You don't know what you have until you drive it."</TE>
<TE>   Amgen closed Wednesday at $46.81, down $3.87, on Nasdaq, in an
otherwise strong session for major drug shares.</TE>

<HD>Credit Card Holders May Miss Out on Rate Cut</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not all borrowers will enjoy the benefits of the Federal Reserve's
latest interest rate cut, which will lower some key borrowing rates
but won't help consumers who are carrying big credit card balances.</LD>
<LD>   Those holding home equity lines of credit and variable rate
personal loans could see an immediate benefit from the Fed's decision
Wednesday to lower its benchmark lending rate by a half-point to
1.25%. These loan rates are usually tied directly to the prime rate
that banks charge their best customers, and some banks Wednesday were
already cutting their prime rates to 4.25% -- the lowest since the
1950s.</LD>
<LD>   But credit card rates aren't expected to budge. And with few
expecting further Fed rate cuts this year, some experts said now may
be the last chance for consumers to restructure debt and lock in
today's low rates.</LD>
<TE>   "This looks to be the final call for people who haven't yet taken
advantage of the opportunity" to repay other debts by getting a home
equity loan or refinancing their mortgage, said Greg McBride,
financial analyst with rate-tracker BankRate.com in North Palm Beach,
Fla.</TE>
<TE>   "This is perceived to be the rate cut that will jump start the
economy. When that recovery takes hold, we will inevitably begin to
see higher interest rates."</TE>
<TE>   While many credit cards have variable interest rates, this rate
cut wasn't expected to have any effect on the millions of consumers
who carry balances, said Robert McKinley, publisher of CardTrack.com,
a Web site that tracks credit card offers.</TE>
<TE>   The reason: Most credit card companies have put "floors" under
their variable-rate cards, which assure that credit card rates don't
fall below set thresholds. Those thresholds, which are often set at
13% or 14%, were reached roughly a year ago, McKinley noted. Many
credit card issuers have since moved to offering fixed-rate cards to
avoid any question about whether consumer rates will drop with prime
rates.</TE>
<TE>   "As a matter of fact, many issuers have been raising rates on card
holders whose credit scores have declined," McKinley said. "MBNA [one
of the nation's biggest credit card issuers] is now charging some
customers 24.98% if they determine that the customer's risk has
increased."</TE>
<TE>   Rates for new auto loans are expected to fall in tandem with the
Fed's move, benefiting those now shopping for a car.</TE>
<TE>   However, since many consumers already took advantage of
promotional zero-percent offers that automakers used to move cars
last year, the effect of the rate cut on auto loans was muted, said
Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J.,
interest rate research and analysis firm.</TE>
<TE>   As for long-term interest rates, such as on mortgages, the Fed
doesn't directly control those rates. It can influence them with its
changes in short-term rates, but the trend in long-term rates is
determined by the marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed cut short-term rates because it believes the economy is
weak. If investors begin to believe the economy will pick up,
however, they could push longer-term rates higher.</TE>
<TE>   Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages were running at about 6.125%
for a conventional loan Wednesday, said Steven Foster, president of
Vista Financial, a North Hollywood-based mortgage brokerage. That's
up slightly from three weeks ago, when the rate for a 30-year
mortgage with no points was below 6%, he said. But it's still very
low by historical standards.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, rates for home equity lines of credit, which are
variable-rate loans tied directly to the prime rate, are plunging.</TE>
<TE>   As of Wednesday, the nationwide average home equity loan rate was
5.21% compared with 5.98% a year ago, and 9.27% in November 2000,
McBride said.</TE>
<TE>   That record low rate is likely to spur another wave of
refinancings, with consumers rolling auto and credit card loans into
either home equity lines of credit or newly secured first mortgages,
Gumbinger said.</TE>
<TE>   However, home equity loans can be dangerous for consumers who
remain in debt for long periods, Foster cautioned. That's because the
loan rates, while low now, can rise rapidly if the economy begins to
grow and interest rates start to rise.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Outlook for other interest rates</TE>
<TE>   Here's a look at what may happen with other lending and investment
rates in the near term in the wake of the Fed's move:</TE>
<TE>   Item: Prime lending rate</TE>
<TE>   Current rate: 4.75% (most banks)</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: A few banks on Wednesday cut their prime rates in tandem
with the Fed's move, to 4.25%. Most major banks didn't announce cuts,
perhaps because the size of the Fed's reduction was a surprise. But
the industry is expected to go along with a half-point cut as early
as today. The prime is a benchmark for many business and consumer
loan rates.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Item: Money market mutual fund average yield (seven-day)</TE>
<TE>   Current rate: 1.21%</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Money-fund tracker IMoneyNet.com predicted Wednesday that
fund yields, already at record lows, will fall by a half point over
the next six weeks, tracking the Fed's cut.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Item: 1-year CD yield (U.S. average)</TE>
<TE>   Current rate: 1.73%</TE>
<TE>   Outlook:  CD yields, like money fund yields, already are at record
lows. Whether banks cut CD rates by a full half point will depend on
how hungry they are to attract or retain deposits, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Item: 10-year Treasury note yield</TE>
<TE>   Current rate: 4.03%</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Fed doesn't directly control long-term interest
rates. Cuts in short-term rates can put downward pressure on
long-term rates, but bond yields ultimately are determined by
investors' perception of the economy's strength and the level of
inflation. For now, investors generally believe the economy is weak.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Item: 30-year mortgage rate (Freddie Mac)</TE>
<TE>   Current rate: 6.13%</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Mortgage rates tend to track 10-year Treasury note
yields. If investors believe the economy will remain weak for some
time, and T-note yields fall further, mortgage rates would follow.</TE>

<HD>Local Governments Sue WorldCom</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of California local governments and a public pension on
Wednesday filed suit against WorldCom Inc. executives and its
investment banks in the latest bid to recover money lost in the
company's failure.</LD>
<LD>   The $55-million lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior
Court, charges the underwriters and company executives with selling
bonds between 1998 and 2001 based on false financial statements.</LD>
<LD>   It names former WorldCom Chief Executive Bernard J. Ebbers, former
Chief Financial Officer Scott D. Sullivan and current CEO John W.
Sidgmore.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuit is the latest by a local government or pension fund to
sue WorldCom and the banks who underwrote its bonds, plaintiff
lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen employee pension funds representing California counties
and one city government joined in filing the lawsuit that seeks to
recover investments in the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "Public employees should not have to sacrifice the security of
their retirement because the nation's largest banks won't follow the
law and put together an honest bond deal," said Louse Renne, San
Francisco's former city attorney, who filed the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit also names banks involved in the bond issues,
including: J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, Lehman
Bros., Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse First Boston, Goldman Sachs
and UBS Warburg.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Sullivan asked a federal judge to move his trial to
Washington or dismiss six of the seven counts of fraud against him
relating to the company's $9-billion accounting scandal.</TE>

<HD>Wall Street, Washington Buzzing About Possible Successors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas S. Mulligan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Even before Harvey L. Pitt announced his resignation Tuesday night as
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, names of possible
successors began flying around Wall Street and Washington.</LD>
<LD>   The list includes high-profile politicians, academics and several
people with experience at the agency. Here are some of the names most
frequently mentioned, along with brief biographies and early
handicapping of their chances:</LD>
<LD>   * James R. Doty, 62, former SEC general counsel. Colleagues praise
the former Rhodes scholar's manner and work ethic as top lawyer for
the SEC during the first Bush administration. However, his close ties
with the Bush family could both help and hurt. Democrats probably
would scrutinize the SEC's decision, while Doty was general counsel,
to close an investigation of the current President Bush's
controversial trading in Harken Energy Corp. shares.</LD>
<TE>   * Frank G. Zarb, 67, former chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market.
His Nasdaq ties could be a mixed blessing after the dot-com collapse,
but he has deep Republican roots, having served as energy advisor to
President Ford and as a high Labor Department official under
President Nixon. He is close to Vice President Dick Cheney.</TE>
<TE>   * Richard C. Breeden, 52, former SEC chairman and current WorldCom
bankruptcy monitor. The longtime regulator also is mentioned as a
possible head of the new accounting oversight board if the current
chairman, former FBI and CIA Director William H. Webster, withdraws.</TE>
<TE>   * Frank Keating, 58, outgoing Oklahoma governor. Keating, who is
stepping down because of term limits, has never been a regulator but
has enforcement experience as a former FBI agent. As a respected
politician, he might face a smoother confirmation process than other
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   * Joseph Grundfest, 51, Stanford University law and business
professor. Grundfest, an SEC commissioner in the 1980s, is considered
an enemy of the trial lawyers bar, heading a research organization
that monitors securities lawsuits. That wouldn't bother the Bush
administration, analysts say, but Democrats could rake over
Grundfest's Silicon Valley connections in confirmation hearings. He
is a director of Oracle Corp. and Garage.com Inc.</TE>
<TE>   * Laura S. Unger, 41, former SEC commissioner. She was acting
chairwoman before Pitt's appointment and is familiar with the
pressure-cooker atmosphere, but she could face questions about
possible SEC passivity while the Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc.
scandals were brewing.</TE>
<TE>   * Paul S. Atkins, 44, current SEC commissioner. A possible interim
appointee, he could be passed over for the permanent post because of
his relative youth, some say. His previous job as a partner in
accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers could raise questions.</TE>
<TE>   * Stanley Sporkin, 70, securities lawyer. The former federal
judge, another former SEC chairman, is widely respected, but some
consider him too old to return to the job.</TE>
<TE>   * Rudolph W. Giuliani, 58, former New York mayor. As a tough
former federal prosecutor who is both Republican and widely known,
Giuliani strikes some as a dream candidate. But he said Wednesday he
isn't interested in the job. In any case, some experts doubted Bush
would want to place a potential rival into a high-visibility job.</TE>
<TE>   Others mentioned include Michael Chertoff, assistant U.S. attorney
general and head of the Justice Department's criminal division; Gary
Lynch, general counsel for Credit Suisse First Boston, who was the
SEC enforcement chief during the insider-trading probes of the 1980s;
former SEC Commissioner Richard Y. Roberts; and Texas Securities
Commissioner Denise Voigt Crawford.</TE>

<HD>Recovery Is Forecast for Chip Industry in 2003</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After suffering its worst-ever downturn in 2001, the semiconductor
industry is poised for double-digit growth next year, according to
two forecasts released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Semiconductor Industry Assn. projected that global chip sales
would grow nearly 20% to $169 billion in 2003. The forecast, based on
a survey of its members, also predicted sales to grow 22% in 2004,
but leveling off in 2005 for a compounded annual growth rate of 8% to
10%.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, independent research firm Gartner Inc. pegged a more
conservative growth rate of 12% in 2003, powered by next-generation
cell phones and a pickup in demand for desktop computers, a sector
that drives more than half of all chip sales.</LD>
<TE>   "The long-awaited recovery is underway," said Jerry Sanders,
chairman of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. in Sunnyvale, Calif., the
second-largest maker of computer microprocessors. "Unfortunately, it
doesn't feel much like a recovery."</TE>
<TE>   Sanders said at a news conference that the industry is heading
into a period of slower growth after the go-go years leading up to
the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "This represents a sea change for the industry," Sanders said.
"Clearly, we can no longer rely on a rising tide to lift all boats."</TE>
<TE>   Gartner's forecast stems from a more cautious outlook of the
electronics industry, according to Richard Gordon, Gartner's
principal analyst, who said the trade group's numbers were "awfully
aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   Both groups estimate sales growth between 1% and 2% this year
after a 32% decline in chip sales in 2001.</TE>

<HD>Cisco Reports Profit on Increased Sales</HD>

<LD>Cisco Systems Inc., the largest maker of specialized computers for
directing Internet traffic, Wednesday reported quarterly net income
of $618 million as sales rose 9%, besting analysts' expectations.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, the San Jose-based company lost $268 million, or 4
cents a share, in the quarter.</LD>
<LD>   But Cisco warned that sales in the current quarter would hold
steady or fall by as much as 4%, sending shares of the technology
bellwether down 11 cents to $12.85 in after-hours trading.</LD>
<TE>   The results were announced after the market closed. In regular
Nasdaq trading, Cisco shares gained 27 cents to $12.96.</TE>
<TE>   Sales in its fiscal first quarter grew to $4.85 billion from $4.45
billion in the same period last year. Net income in the three months
ended Oct. 26 amounted to 8 cents a share. Cisco took a $412-million
pretax charge for the declining market value of publicly traded
investments.</TE>
<TE>   "By focusing on what we can control and influence, we saw dramatic
year-over-year improvements in net income, gross margins and
profitable market share gains," said Chief Executive John Chambers.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that the number of new orders is declining, Chief Financial
Officer Larry Carter said second-quarter revenue could slip by 3% or
4% from the $4.85 billion in the quarter just ended. Analysts had
expected sales to increase to $4.89 billion, according to Thomson
First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco has lost less revenue and stock market value than many of
its competitors in the last year, and it has been saving money by
laying off employees. But as the economic slowdown spreads, it hasn't
been able to completely escape the fallout.</TE>
<TE>   "Cisco is doing what it can internally," said C.E. Unterberg,
Towbin analyst Mark Sue, who rates Cisco shares "market perform" and
doesn't own Cisco shares. "Nevertheless, it's still part of an
industry that's suffering from reduced spending." Unterberg doesn't
do investment banking business with Cisco.</TE>

<HD>Conexant to Receive Early Loan Payments</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James S. Granelli</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Conexant Systems Inc. said Wednesday that it will receive $140
million in early payments on loans made to a wireless telephone unit
it had spun off into a merger last spring. Shares of the Newport
Beach communications chip developer rose 22%.</LD>
<LD>   Conexant, which has seen its stock plummet even as it improved
sales over the last year, said it should get the money immediately
from wireless chip maker Skyworks Solutions Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Skyworks, based in Woburn, Mass., sold $200 million in debt
securities Wednesday and said it would use the proceeds to pay down
its $215 million in debts to Conexant.</LD>
<TE>   Spokeswoman Lisa M. Briggs said the new bonds and early repayment
to Conexant allow Skyworks to save a significant amount in interest.</TE>
<TE>   Conexant's stock closed up 39 cents at $2.19 on Nasdaq, but it
climbed as high as $2.31 during trading Wednesday. It has lost 49% of
its value this year.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts see the early payment as a good sign for Conexant.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the status of financial markets, investors might have been
concerned about whether Conexant was going to be getting its money
back," said analyst F. Drake Johnstone of Davenport &amp; Co. in
Richmond, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Conexant also sold its specialty chip manufacturing plant this
year to a joint venture with the Carlyle Group. It is left with a
computer, fax and broadband chip business that analysts expect to be
profitable by the end of the year and with a money-losing Internet
equipment unit called Mindspeed Technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Mindspeed initially was scheduled to be spun off two years ago,
but the crash in the semiconductor market forced Conexant to put
those plans on the shelf. The unit is still expected to be sold once
revenue growth is assured.</TE>
<TE>   "Until they spin off Mindspeed, there won't be any end to the
losses," said analyst Kalpesh Kapadia of C.E. Unterberg, Towbin in
San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Skyworks, created by the merger of Conexant's wireless unit and
Alpha Industries Inc., owes Conexant $150 million for a Mexicali,
Mexico, manufacturing plant that was part of the merger and $65
million on a $100-million line of credit.</TE>
<TE>   From the proceeds of the debt securities, Skyworks will pay $105
million on the facility and $35 million on the loan. It will pay the
rest of the loan by June and has a new note to pay the remaining $45
million on the plant by June 2005.</TE>

<HD>Dole Swings to Profit in Quarter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Melinda Fulmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Greater demand for packaged produce and higher banana prices in Asia
helped Dole Food Co. swing to a third-quarter profit, but shares fell
Wednesday as the world's largest fruit and vegetable shipper warned
of lower-than-expected profit in the fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Dole earned $14.7 million, or 26 cents a share, in the quarter
ended Oct. 5, contrasted with a loss of $94.8 million, or $1.70, a
year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Sales rose about 4% to $1.25 billion from $1.21 billion last year,
as the Westlake Village-based company sold more bagged salads and
packaged fruit bowls, increased volume at its European ripening and
distribution facility and fetched higher prices for its fresh fruit,
including its premium sweet pineapple.</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, the company was not badly affected by the recent
disruptions at West Coast ports, losing just $250,000 to $500,000,
rather than the $2.4 million company officials had originally
anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   "The fresh-fruit business is doing well and they are beating
numbers," said Eric Larson, an analyst at US Bancorp Piper Jaffray.</TE>
<TE>   Net income included a 2-cent-per-share gain from Dole's sale of a
Spanish citrus and vegetable producer and a French dried-fruit
company, plus the recovery of a previously written-off investment in
Honduras.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding those gains, Dole's earnings of 24 cents a share
exceeded the 21-cent estimate from analysts polled by Thomson First
Call.</TE>
<TE>   However, Lawrence A. Kern, Dole's president and chief operating
officer, warned that the company's profit outlook for the fourth
quarter and the full year will be lower than expected, as competition
heats up in the banana business in North America and as the company
finishes the last of the cost-cutting measures and divestitures that
had boosted earnings in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   "Our challenge going forward is to grow Dole's earnings by growing
market share in our core businesses through internal growth and
selective acquisitions," Kern said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, acquisitions in Dole's core fruit and vegetable
businesses will be "difficult to achieve" given the company's
dominant market position.</TE>
<TE>   Dole itself is in the midst of acquisition negotiations. Chairman
and Chief Executive David Murdock made an offer in late September to
take the company private by buying the 76% of the company he doesn't
already own. His initial offer of $29.50 a share was rebuffed, but
Murdock and the company are still negotiating.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Larson said the company's lowered guidance shouldn't
greatly affect these negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Dole forecast fourth-quarter profit at 20 cents to 24 cents a
share, short of the 27 cents expected by analysts. And it said it
would earn $2.65 a share for the year, which was at the low end of
analysts' expectations.</TE>
<TE>   The weaker outlook reflects expected lower North American prices
on bananas in the fourth quarter, flattening sales of packaged
lettuce and fruit as well as continued weak prices in the company's
bulk vegetable business.</TE>
<TE>   Dole shares dropped 37 cents to close at $28.87 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Enron CFO Pleads Not Guilty</HD>
<DH>Andrew Fastow is accused of enriching himself through fraud
that cost investors billions of dollars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Former Enron Corp. Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow on
Wednesday pleaded not guilty to charges he masterminded a fraud that
cost investors billions of dollars.</LD>
<LD>   Indicted on 78 counts, the 40-year-old former executive faces as
many as 20 years in prison on each of the most serious charges.
Fastow is accused of enriching himself through fraud and money
laundering and attempting to cover up the accounting scandal as it
triggered the energy company's collapse.</LD>
<LD>   "Your honor, in answer to each of the charges, I am not guilty,"
Fastow said.</LD>
<TE>   Enron sought bankruptcy protection in December after restating
more than $586 million in earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Its collapse destroyed employee retirement accounts and cost more
than 4,500 workers their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow, the highest-ranking executive charged in the case, is
refusing to cooperate with the government's investigation,
prosecutors say.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow has been free on a $5-million bond since he was first
charged Oct. 2. A pretrial conference is scheduled for Jan. 13 before
U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt.</TE>
<TE>   Enron evolved from an interstate pipeline company into the world's
largest energy trader. It reported annual revenue of more than $100
billion, with interests in electricity, natural gas,
telecommunications and water.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow was in his mid-30s when he created and ran partnerships for
the energy trader that brought him more than $30 million and hid $1
billion in debt, a report for the company's board of directors has
alleged.</TE>
<TE>   He was ousted as chief financial officer a year ago after Enron
revealed partnerships he controlled, including LJM Cayman and LJM2
Co-Investment, had cost the company millions of dollars. LJM2 filed
for bankruptcy protection in September.</TE>
<TE>   But Fastow's attorneys have said everything their client did was
approved by top Enron executives and that Fastow does not believe he
committed any crimes. The only executives over Fastow during that
time were former Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling and former Enron
Chairman Kenneth L. Lay.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials said they are seeking to freeze $21
million of Fastow's assets. The Securities and Exchange Commission
has said it would try to force Fastow to surrender "ill-gotten
gains," including his salary.</TE>

<HD>FCC Is Expected to Readopt Rules on Equal Employment</HD>
<DH>Courts have rejected the regulations twice, but the
agency's chairman says they are vital to increasing diversity on
television.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edmund Sanders</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Hoping the third time is a charm, the Federal Communications
Commission today is expected to readopt rules requiring broadcasters,
cable operators and satellite providers to broaden their outreach for
minority and female employees.</LD>
<LD>   The contested rules have been tossed out twice by a federal
appeals court, which said the agency created de facto quotas and
pressured broadcasters to hire based on race and gender.</LD>
<LD>   Some predicted that the rules would die quietly under FCC Chairman
Michael K. Powell, a Republican with a hands-off regulatory approach.
But Powell, son of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, has championed
the equal opportunity rules, saying they are vital to increasing
diversity on television.</LD>
<TE>   The new rules are expected to require broadcasters and
pay-television providers to do broad outreach before filling any
full-time position, and participate in recruiting activities such as
job fairs and advertising campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   The commissioners are expected to delay action on one of the most
controversial elements of the rules: requiring broadcasters to file
annual reports listing the race and title of all employees, sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   Cable operators have long supported the proposed rules, but state
broadcasting associations and the National Assn. of Broadcasters
remain opposed, saying the rules would violate their rights and
impose burdensome new paperwork requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcasters also oppose the annual reports, saying they fear they
could be used by civil rights groups to file discrimination lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   An NAB spokesman declined to comment, but association attorneys
have said in filings that they would prefer tax credits to encourage
minority and female hiring.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller broadcasters are particularly opposed to the rules, saying
that even a simple requirement to post all job listings could have
unintended consequences.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're not happy with your morning-drive [disc jockey] and you
want to hire someone else, you may not want him to know about that,"
said Barry Gottfried, an attorney representing several state
broadcasting associations.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, broadcasters proposed listing some, but not all, job
openings on the Internet, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the equal employment opportunity rules say they are
astounded by broadcasters' opposition, particularly in light of
studies that show their industry has a poor record in hiring minority
and female workers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most modest program you could have," said David
Honig, executive director of the Minority Media &amp; Telecom Council,
the leading proponent of the rules. "That exposes to me that these
groups are not interested in integrating their businesses."</TE>
<TE>   He said a recent study by two Rutgers University law professors
found that minority and female employment was so low at some
broadcast companies that researchers concluded that discrimination
must be intentional.</TE>
<TE>   The original equal employment rules were adopted in the 1960s and
required broadcasters' work force to reflect the diversity of their
community. But those rules were thrown out in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The commission's second attempt to draft rules ran into similar
problems in 2001, when a federal appellate court found one provision
was unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   In crafting the new rules, Powell sought to address the court's
concerns and reduce the chance of reversal. But Commissioner Michael
J. Copps, the sole Democrat at the FCC, complained that the new rules
now are not tough enough, sources said.</TE>

<HD>Honda May Ship Through Mexico</HD>
<DH>Japanese automaker says it is seeking ways to avoid parts
shipment delays such as those caused by last month's shutdown of
ports on the West Coast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Honda Motor Co. said Wednesday that it may begin transporting some
imported parts through Mexico to avoid production disruptions such as
those caused by last month's shutdown of U.S. West Coast ports.</LD>
<LD>   Honda, which ranks fifth in U.S. vehicle sales, also wants
permission to speed U.S.-bound parts shipments so it has more
inventory if a similar bottleneck occurs.</LD>
<LD>   The Tokyo-based automaker, projected to make 1.22 million
passenger cars and light trucks at North American plants this year,
lost 25,000 units of production after shipments of minor parts such
as water hose clips, bolts and screws were stuck at West Coast ports.</LD>
<TE>   The company is considering steps to keep future distribution snags
from closing plants, said Dan Bonawitz, Honda's vice president for
corporate planning and logistics.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working with [U.S.] Customs right now on fast-tracking
border crossings or port entries, so we're in the early stages of
that," Bonawitz said in an interview in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "We also look at options like bringing more in through Mexico. We
brought in one ship there this time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Honda makes 80% of the cars and trucks it sells in North America
at local plants that get 95% of their parts from local suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   The automaker's factories rank among North America's most
efficient, in part because they rely on "just-in-time" deliveries of
components and keep relatively small inventories.</TE>
<TE>   Last month's 10-day lockout of West Coast dockworkers forced
several automakers to charter air-cargo carriers to fly in some parts
shipments and led to brief shutdowns at Honda plants in the United
States and Canada; a Northern California auto plant shared by Toyota
Motor Corp. and General Motors Corp.; and Mitsubishi Motors Corp.'s
Illinois plant.</TE>
<TE>   Honda's U.S.-traded shares fell 31 cents , or 1.7%, to $17.79 on
the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has fallen 13% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Torrance-based Toyota Motor Sales America, the largest import
brand and fourth-biggest car company in the U.S., used ports in
Mexico during the lockout for a small amount of cargo but there is
"no consideration of any permanent diversion. Our backlog ... is all
caught up," said spokesman Mike Michels.</TE>
<TE>   Hyundai Motor America, the South Korean car importer based in
Fountain Valley, is not considering use of Mexican ports, either,
spokesman Mike Anson said.</TE>

<HD>Idealab Spawning Discord</HD>
<DH>Founder is battling investors who say he's enriching
himself. They want the firm dissolved.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In a small room in Pasadena that looks like a high school machine
shop, the man whose high-tech incubator once spawned some of the
hottest companies in Southern California is in the midst of what he
insists could be his biggest idea ever.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Gross spends most of his time here these days, behind glass
doors, tweaking the design of solar engines at a venture tentatively
called Pasadena Power. Though the business hasn't been formally
launched, Gross -- never known for understatement -- declares
unabashedly that it "will change the world."</LD>
<LD>   "It's like the atom bomb with its significance for the planet," he
said.</LD>
<TE>   Unless, that is, Gross' business empire gets blown apart first.</TE>
<TE>   Gross, who once had hundreds of millions of dollars thrown at him
by some of the smartest investors in America, is locked in a bitter
court battle with some of those same backers. They want to shut down
his incubator, Idealab Inc., and take back as much of their capital
as they can get.</TE>
<TE>   The next showdown will come today when Los Angeles County Superior
Court Judge Ralph Dau is set to decide which charges in the
investors' complaint, including "deceit by concealment" and "breach
of fiduciary duty," can go forward to trial, expected to start early
next year.</TE>
<TE>   Dau also is expected to decide whether these shareholders, who own
only about 10% of Idealab even though they had put up about 96% of
its capital at its peak, are significant enough investors to call for
the firm to be dissolved.</TE>
<TE>   Civil court documents filed this year by the group of about 40
angry investors maintain that Gross wants to use the estimated $350
million of liquid assets that Idealab has left to support salaries
for himself; his new wife, Marcia Goodstein, who is the company's
president and chief operating officer; and his brother Larry --
rather than create companies that make both sense and profits.</TE>
<TE>   Among those leveling the allegations: an investing arm of Dell
Computer Corp.; mutual fund giant T. Rowe Price; a group of former
top executives at Microsoft Corp.; and Jeffrey Berg, who heads talent
agency International Creative Management.</TE>
<TE>   The investors rushed to give Gross $1 billion in cash in exchange
for so-called preferred shares in early 2000, just as the tech-sector
boom was peaking and as Idealab was considering going public. Now,
the investors contend that Gross has mismanaged the company and is
using it to his own ends.</TE>
<TE>   Gross, 44, says he has no intention of shutting down. He intends
to prove that the incubator concept -- in which Idealab spawned such
hits as Internet search engine Overture.com, as well such bombs as
EToys Inc. -- is still viable.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Gross, who at one point could claim to have generated more
than 6,000 jobs and millions of dollars in shareholder wealth from
more than 50 companies, says he has new ventures in development that
will surely flourish.</TE>
<TE>   He promises to make money for the very same investors who are so
angry with him now -- if they'd only leave him alone.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, the investors contend that their main beef isn't
with Gross' high concepts; rather, it's with what they see as his
high living.</TE>
<TE>   "We're willing to go the distance and will go the distance," said
one former investor who asked not to be named. "We're not going to
sit by and watch Idealab spend $50 million a year to support the
lavish lifestyles of Bill Gross and his wife with what we believe is
our money."</TE>
<TE>   Added Jay Ferguson, a partner with Kline Hawkes, a Los Angeles
venture fund that holds about $40 million of Idealab's preferred
shares and is a plaintiff in the suit: This "is not at all about Bill
Gross' plans for the future. It's not about what great ideas he has.
It's about the abuses we allege in the complaint. We can't stand by
and see what's going on and look the other way. This is about doing
what's right for our own stakeholders."</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs allege that Gross' salary increased 60% in 2001 to
$400,000 and Goodstein's salary increased 85% to $350,000 after they
received the investors' money. However, Gross counters that in the
six years that Idealab has existed, his salary and bonus has averaged
$300,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs also allege Idealab lent almost $36 million to
Gross and Goodstein and other former directors. Gross acknowledges
taking a loan of $30 million to buy into the preferred stock in 2000,
but says he paid it back within 30 days using a personal bank loan.</TE>
<TE>   Gross calls the investors' accusations "completely false," adding,
"All the money at Idealab is being used to build new companies."</TE>
<TE>   "The only money I've taken out of Idealab is my salary," he said.
"There is no way I could be supporting the lifestyle they are
claiming."</TE>
<TE>   Gross says he put $42 million into Idealab at the same time the
preferred investors did and on the same terms. He says he stands as
the fifth-largest cash investor in the company and thus has more
money at risk than many of those suing him.</TE>
<TE>   Because Idealab is a private company, the investors can't sell
their shares in a marketplace. Idealab in December offered to buy
them out at 10 cents on the dollar, a deal they refused. The
investors then asked for 37 cents on the dollar, an amount that Gross
rejected in April.</TE>
<TE>   So how did this creative genius put himself in this position?</TE>
<TE>   The son of an Encino orthodontist, Gross has always had an
entrepreneurial bent. While at Caltech, he built stereo speakers and
sold them to classmates. In 1996, after selling Knowledge Adventure,
an educational software firm he founded, Gross decided to start
Idealab.</TE>
<TE>   The original company name was Bill Gross' Idealab, because there
already was an Idealab in California. His initial investors -- who
are not part of the lawsuit -- included director Steven Spielberg and
actor Michael Douglas.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the distraction of the lawsuit, Gross keeps plugging away,
working out of the same cavernous office space off Colorado Boulevard
that he has always occupied.</TE>
<TE>   Idealab now counts about 10 ventures being explored under its
roof. The incubator employs 100 people, fewer than half what it did
during the heyday of the dot-coms.</TE>
<TE>   Gross is betting big on Evolution Robotics. Unveiled this year,
the company has produced a robot called ER1, which looks like a
laptop on wheels -- though you have to supply the laptop -- with a
digital camera attached. It can see, so it can recognize certain
things, be programmed to perform certain tasks and respond to
commands. At $600, it's one of the cheapest robots around, says
Gross, and is available for Christmas shopping in stores such as
CompUSA and FAO Schwarz.</TE>
<TE>   Another major project is Omnilux, a wireless broadband company
that Gross predicts will offer low-cost but fast Internet service.
The company makes Omni-Nodes, which can sit on a customer's roof and
create low-cost broadband networks for various places, including
hard-to-serve areas.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Pasadena Power, the most secretive of Gross'
ventures.</TE>
<TE>   Although Gross has his supporters in the local high-tech
community, some wonder about his stubbornness, given the dot-com
shakeout and the collapse of similar Internet incubators, such as
CMGI and Internet Capital Group.</TE>
<TE>   "If anything suffered and died in the dot-com boom, it's the
concept of vision as a substitute for sound business practices," said
Jon Goodman, who ran USC's technology business incubator, knows as
EC2, for six years before the university shut it down in June.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fool's gold," Goodman said. "It flies in the face of
everything we've seen in the past 20 years. If Gross makes this work,
he'll be the first one. Then we could say he has business skills that
no one else has ever had."</TE>
<TE>   As for Gross, does he ever have doubts? Does he worry that his
ideas might not pan out?</TE>
<TE>   "Never. I never have doubts," he said. "Not when I see what we are
doing here."</TE>

<HD>SEC Proposes Rule for Corporate Counsel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Corporate lawyers would be forced to report evidence of misconduct to
top executives and company boards under a rule proposed Wednesday by
the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   A public comment period will be opened on the proposal. A rule is
required under a new federal accounting law and would be the first
national standard of its kind.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed rule would require that company attorneys report
wrongdoing first to the chief executive or chief legal counsel. If
the executive's response is inadequate, the lawyers would have to
report their concerns to the board of directors, its audit committee,
or another independent board group.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed rule is "historic and it is revolutionary," said SEC
Commissioner Roel Campos as the panel voted unanimously to submit it
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "The changes are an important and necessary development in the
American legal and business jurisprudence," Campos said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers who violate the requirement could be barred from
practicing before the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very serious sanction," said Karl Groskaufmanis, a partner
at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson in Washington. "If you
have the kind of practice that requires you to be before the SEC,
then it's not just a slap on the wrist. It has potential for
significantly impairing your ability to earn a living."</TE>
<TE>   The draft rule results from an amendment added by Sen. John
Edwards (D-N.C.) to accounting-overhaul legislation signed July 30 by
President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The law sought to restore confidence in financial markets shaken
by accounting scandals at Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc., Xerox Corp. and
other firms.</TE>
<TE>   The new law follows allegations that Enron's main law firm,
Houston-based Vinson &amp; Elkins, should have demanded greater public
disclosure about off-the-books partnerships that hid $1 billion in
Enron losses.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed rule would require the SEC to issue standards of
professional conduct for lawyers who represent public companies
before the SEC. A new rule must be finalized by Jan. 26.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney would have to report evidence of "material" violations
of the securities laws. The SEC defines a material violation as one
that a reasonable investor would want to know about.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole notion is, if you are the lawyer to the corporation,
your loyalty is to the corporation, not to the individuals who may
have hired you," said SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt, in what could be
one of his final votes. Pitt on Tuesday submitted his resignation.</TE>
<TE>   The American Bar Assn. said it had no comment until the SEC
releases the full rule package.</TE>

<HD>Wall St. Buoyed by Hefty Fed Rate Cut</HD>
<DH>Analysts say the central bank's move and GOP election gains
may give the rally more fuel. But others caution that the economy is
still ailing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks zigzagged their way to moderate gains Wednesday as investors
digested two major developments: the GOP's victory in Tuesday's
midterm elections and the Federal Reserve's surprisingly deep cut in
interest rates.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a new level of enthusiasm on Wall Street, but the jury
is still out on just what the Republican agenda will be," said Andrew
Parmentier, policy analyst at Friedman Billings Ramsey in Arlington,
Va.</LD>
<LD>   The Fed's dramatic half-point interest rate cut, meanwhile, was
meant to have a psychological effect, analysts said, noting that
rates already were at 41-year lows.</LD>
<TE>   "In front of the holiday shopping season, the message is, 'Don't
worry, keep spending,' " said Mario DeRose, fixed- income analyst at
brokerage Edward Jones in St. Louis. Some analysts fretted, however,
that the size of the rate cut signals that the Fed has serious doubts
about the U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average surged after the Fed's
announcement, then sank before rallying again to close 92.74 points,
or 1.1%, higher at 8,771.01. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index
gained 8.37 points, or 0.9%, to 923.76, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq
composite rose 17.82 points, or 1.3%, to 1,418.99.</TE>
<TE>   Winners swamped losers by 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange
and on Nasdaq in heavy trading.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, some short-term Treasury yields finished little
changed despite the big rate cut. Analysts had said a quarter-point
cut was "priced in" to the Treasury market.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors apparently think this is the end of the line for
interest rates," said Jeffrey Gundlach, manager of the TCW Galileo
Total Return fund in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on two-year Treasury notes rose to 1.83% from 1.81% on
Tuesday, while the yield on the benchmark 10-year T-note eased to
4.03% from 4.07%. Very short-term yields were more strongly affected,
however, with the yield on the six-month T-bill falling to 1.24% from
1.41%.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the election results and the Fed's move could give
Wall Street's monthlong rally more fuel, bolstering hopes that the 2
1/2-year bear market bottomed out in October. The Dow has gained
20.4% since falling to a five-year low Oct. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Strategists expect Republicans -- who now control both houses of
Congress -- to push for tax cuts and other measures perceived warmly
on Wall Street, while shying away from business regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Although the economic stimulus of tax cuts would be welcomed by
investors, analyst Parmentier said, the GOP might risk raising
skepticism if it were to add government personnel -- for example, in
funding the homeland security department.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, he said, industry sectors likely to benefit from the
GOP's agenda include brand-name drug stocks, now seen as less
vulnerable to price limits; insurers, whose asbestos liability might
be capped under tort reform; and oil producers, which could be helped
by new domestic production.</TE>
<TE>   Drug stocks jumped Wednesday, including Pfizer, up $1.02 to
$33.64; Bristol-Myers Squibb, up $1.12 to $26.99; and
Schering-Plough, up $1.02 to $22.40.</TE>
<TE>   Defense stocks, also viewed by analysts as a potential beneficiary
of the Republican agenda, rallied as well, including Lockheed Martin,
up $1.30 to $54.95; Northrop Grumman, up $3.92 to $100.40; and
Boeing, up $2.06 to $33.58.</TE>
<TE>   With its key interest rate now at 1.25%, the Fed has little room
to trim rates further, analysts caution, and its 11 cuts in 2001 so
far have resulted in a mixed bag of economic data.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fed may not have much ammunition left to address any
exogenous shock, be it a recession in Europe or a supply shock in the
energy markets," said Jack Caffrey, equity strategist at J.P. Morgan
Private Bank in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Some believe the Fed may have been using its "ammunition" on
Wednesday to, in effect, drive investors out of money market funds
and into stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The average seven-day money market yield already is near a record
low at 1.2%. That rate probably will fall to about 0.75% in the
coming six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge hit for savers," Gundlach said. "It would seem the
Fed is trying to encourage the stock market rally to continue."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts also caution that the Fed's unmistakable message was that
the U.S. economy still needs help.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors should have mixed emotions about the Fed's actions,"
Caffrey said. "Yes, lower interest rates justify higher valuations on
stocks, but if economic conditions are so weak that expected earnings
don't come through, then it's a different story."</TE>
<TE>   Although the rate cut could help keep the market's rally going for
a while, he said, once fourth-quarter earnings "confession season"
begins this month, investors could get spooked if it appears
consumers aren't spending.</TE>
<TE>   In the currency market, meanwhile, the euro passed $1 for the
first time since July, closing at $1.003, up from 99.9 cents Tuesday,
as the greenback slumped.</TE>

<LD>Never lacking for ambition in its quest for new markets, Microsoft
Corp. is taking aim on what many consider a relatively secure redoubt
from the march of technology: pen and paper.</LD>
<LD>   After years of hype and promises, more than a dozen computer
makers today will begin selling portable computers featuring
Microsoft's tablet software, which allows users to enter text with
keyboards or a stylus similar to those for hand-held organizers from
Palm Inc. and others.</LD>
<LD>   Previous attempts at pen-based computing wiped out smaller Silicon
Valley firms and helped lead to the ouster of Apple Computer Inc.
Chief Executive John Sculley, who backed the ill-fated Newton.</LD>
<TE>   But Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates has made the Tablet a pet
project, pouring $400 million into research and development and
pledging another $70 million on marketing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm personally thrilled to see that product get into the market,"
Gates said. "Over the next three to four years, a high percentage of
portables will be tablets."</TE>
<TE>   If tablet products by Hewlett-Packard Co., Acer Inc., Toshiba,
Fujitsu and others do succeed, it will be in part because Microsoft
has scaled down its hopes.</TE>
<TE>   The handwriting recognition, while better than those in tablet's
precursors, works for only about half of the population, by
Microsoft's estimates.</TE>
<TE>   So the software giant recommended that its hardware partners
include a keyboard. Some models, including HP's, detach from that
keyboard. Others fold the keyboard under the screen, turning the
machine into a slim slate.</TE>
<TE>   The computers also let users skip handwriting recognition and
store their handwritten jottings as they appear, either by themselves
or as annotations to typed documents.</TE>
<TE>   Computer makers are charging between about $1,700 and $2,400 for
the tablet products and see them as a niche within the existing
market for the high-end notebook machines favored by meeting-bound
executives and mobile professionals.</TE>
<TE>   "Long-term, we think they will settle at 10[%] to 20% of total
volume" for personal computers, said HP Senior Vice President Jim
McDonnell.</TE>
<TE>   Others are less sanguine: Gartner Inc. researchers projected
Wednesday that tablets will account for just 1.2% of notebook
shipments in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "Lack of application support, clumsy hardware designs and a price
premium will be barriers for most users," said Gartner Vice President
Ken Dulaney.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street firms likewise expect negligible impact on Microsoft's
earnings. "I personally like it, but I'm a geek," said Charles Di
Bona, a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst.</TE>
<TE>   Tablets could benefit from the increasing availability of wireless
Internet access, according to other analysts and Gates, who uses an
Acer one.</TE>
<TE>   "For college students, it's a very attractive product," Gates
said. "Then again, it's very attractive for me -- when I'm sitting in
a meeting, I want to be able to look at my schedule, browse the Web
and take notes."</TE>

<HD>Pan Pacific Retail to Buy Center Trust</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Defoe</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pan Pacific Retail Properties Inc., the largest U.S. West Coast
shopping center operator, agreed to buy rival Center Trust Inc. for
$219 million in stock, plus assumed debt. The purchase ends a
money-losing investment by Center Trust's largest shareholder,
Lazard.</LD>
<LD>   San Diego-based Pan Pacific will issue 0.218 share of its stock
for each share of Center Trust, said Stuart Tanz, Pan Pacific's
president and chief executive. That values Center Trust at $7.45 a
share, a 31% premium to their closing price Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The deal also includes the assumption or retirement of $364
million of debt and transaction costs.</LD>
<TE>   A real estate fund managed by Lazard bought a controlling interest
in Manhattan Beach-based Center Trust when shares of the real estate
investment trust, then known as Alexander Haagen Properties, were
trading at about $14.50. The New York-based investment bank will own
an 8% stake in the combined company.</TE>
<TE>   "Center Trust is a mixed bag," said Tom Trotman, a fund manager
with Delaware Management Co., which owns 1.13 million shares of Pan
Pacific. Tanz "knows the markets extremely well. We have faith in
him. It's going to be interesting to see what they do with the weaker
assets."</TE>
<TE>   The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter
and is subject to approval of shareholders owning two-thirds of the
company's stock. Lazard, which owns a 52% stake in Center Trust, has
agreed to vote in favor of the sale.</TE>
<TE>   Pan Pacific shares fell 6 cents to $34.18 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Center Trust rose $1.53 to $7.22 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   The purchase would boost Pan Pacific's holdings by about 20% to
138 shopping centers with 19.4 million square feet of space.</TE>
<TE>   "It enhances and balances our geographic distribution and broadens
our tenant diversification," Tanz said. "We will pare some of their
assets."</TE>
<TE>   Center Trust's shopping centers are largely based in Southern
California, including the Media City Center in Burbank and the
Fullerton Town Center, and are anchored by supermarkets.</TE>

<HD>Rents on Rodeo Fall in Rankings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leslie Earnest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rodeo Drive rents lost ground this year in a worldwide ranking of the
most expensive pockets of retail real estate, according to a study
released today.</LD>
<LD>   Rents in the tony Beverly Hills shopping district between Wilshire
and Santa Monica boulevards ranked 32nd out of 223 locations in the
year ended June 30, compared with a ranking of 17 out of 221
locations the year before.</LD>
<LD>   Nationwide, the street's rents remained the sixth-most expensive,
the same ranking as last year, according to the annual report by
Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a global real estate services firm based in New
York.</LD>
<TE>   Annual rents on Rodeo Drive were, on average, $220 per square foot
in the more recent period, compared with $240 the previous year, an
8.3% decrease.</TE>
<TE>   But the lower worldwide ranking is more a reflection of rising
rents elsewhere than of sliding rents locally, a spokesman for
Cushman &amp; Wakefield said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the study, the world's highest rents were in New
York, on Fifth Avenue and on East 57th Street, where retailers pay
$700 per square foot annually, ahead of Avenue des Champs-Elysees in
Paris, where rents were $577.</TE>
<TE>   The strongest growth worldwide was in central Kuwait City, where
rents surged 180% to $104 as more Western-style shopping centers were
built, the report says. In the U.S., the heartiest growth was on New
York's Madison Avenue, where rents jumped 25% to $650 per square
foot.</TE>
<TE>   Overall nationwide, demand remained "relatively firm despite the
uncertain economic conditions," the report says, with prime rents
rising 2.9% for the year.</TE>

<LD>A federal judge ruled that J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. must go to trial
to try to obtain almost $1 billion in disputed Enron Corp.-related
surety bond payments from insurers, the bank said.</LD>
<LD>   Manhattan federal Judge Jed Rakoff denied the bank summary
judgment in the case, which now goes to trial Dec. 2.</LD>
<LD>   J.P. Morgan sued 11 insurers after energy trader Enron went
bankrupt and failed to deliver oil and gas to two of the bank's
offshore trading units.</LD>
<TE>   The insurers say they were misled about the nature of the deals
they were insuring and claim they do not have to pay.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Nokia, Siemens, Ericsson and NTT DoCoMo Inc. agreed to reduce royalty
payments for faster wireless technology to boost their chances of
getting chosen by phone companies over San Diego-based Qualcomm Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The companies aim to keep royalties related to wideband
code-division multiple access technology at less than 5% of the price
of the equipment. That's less than companies must pay Qualcomm, which
is the most significant single owner of patents for WCDMA and
cdma2000, a rival technology.</LD>
<LD>   Companies such as Nokia and Qualcomm are lobbying for phone
companies to deploy their so-called third-generation technologies to
offer mobile customers new services.</LD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler Group announced a recall of about 500,000
minivans and offered an extended warranty on 1.3 million more because
of a problem in the steering wheel.</LD>
<LD>   The recall covers some 1996-98 models of Dodge Caravan, Grand
Caravan, Plymouth Voyager, Grand Voyager and Chrysler Town &amp; Country.</LD>
<LD>   The recall will close a 20-month government investigation of a
problem with the clock spring, which provides power to some parts in
the steering wheel.</LD>
<TE>   Chrysler said it will send letters this month to owners of
recalled vehicles. The automaker says that if the air bag warning
light remains on for more than a few seconds after the van is
started, it should be taken to a dealer for inspection.</TE>

<LD>Homestore Inc. expects to report a third-quarter net loss of about
$40 million, narrower than a year-earlier loss of $106.6 million,
according to preliminary financial results released by the Westlake
Village-based company.</LD>
<LD>   The online real estate company said it expects to report revenue
of $64 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30, down sharply from a
year earlier. Homestore is expected to report its third-quarter
results Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Federal officials have been investigating the company's accounting
practices and deals with key business partners since revelations last
fall that $160 million in Homestore revenue was improperly recorded
in 2000 and 2001.</LD>

<HD>Looking Ahead at the SEC</HD>
<DH>White House faces a major challenge in naming a new
chairman to replace Harvey Pitt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- Harvey L. Pitt presided over a meeting of the Securities
and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, but across Washington and Wall
Street the focus was already on who might next occupy Pitt's chair at
the table.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration faces a major challenge in naming a new
SEC chairman to replace Pitt, who resigned under pressure Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Many securities law experts said Bush must seek candidates who not
only are above reproach, but who also could forge consensus on the
now badly fractured SEC board.</LD>
<TE>   "You've got to find someone who is able to form coalitions and who
has a more statesman-like personality" than Pitt, said John Coffee, a
Columbia University law professor. "All the great SEC chairmen have
been consensus builders."</TE>
<TE>   The White House also may have a second vacancy to worry about:
William H. Webster, handpicked by Pitt in late October to head the
nation's new accounting oversight board, may be pressured to follow
Pitt out the door, many observers said.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt told Bush on Tuesday that he would depart as the nation's top
markets regulator, conceding that the furor over his 15-month tenure
was damaging the agency. Pitt said he would stay until a replacement
was named.</TE>
<TE>   Though an acclaimed securities lawyer, Pitt, 57, was continually
criticized for arrogance and for antagonizing many of the people whom
he needed to support his policies.</TE>
<TE>   Names of several possible successors have been discussed in
Washington and Wall Street circles in recent days. They include
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former New York mayor who prosecuted
white-collar criminals in the 1980s as a U.S. attorney; Frank G.
Zarb, a onetime head of the National Assn. of Securities Dealers; and
James R. Doty, a Washington lawyer who once served as SEC general
counsel.</TE>
<TE>   But Giuliani has taken himself out of consideration.</TE>
<TE>   Until a permanent successor is in place, Bush may designate one of
the agency's two Republican commissioners, Paul Atkins or Cynthia
Glassman, as acting chairman, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The other two commissioners, besides Pitt, are Democrats Roel
Campos and Harvey Goldschmid.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the White House said Wednesday that it was too early
to determine how soon the president would nominate a permanent
replacement for Pitt.</TE>
<TE>   One Bush aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said he had
seen no signs of movement, but that it was an issue on which Bush and
his top advisors wanted to proceed quickly.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said a replacement would
be nominated "as soon as the transition allows."</TE>
<TE>   But he said "I can't guess" whether the task will be completed
within weeks or months.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that anybody has a firm handle on how long that
could be," he said, indicating that the White House intended to hold
firmly to its practice of not adding to speculation about personnel
moves.</TE>
<TE>   After a candidate is chosen, it could take at least two weeks for
the FBI to do a background check. The nominee then would have to be
confirmed by the Senate, though that task became easier with
Tuesday's elections, as the GOP regained control of the chamber.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating the process, some experts said, is the question of
whether many of the top candidates would want the job.</TE>
<TE>   A new chairman could establish a powerful legacy at what is widely
viewed as a historic turning point in markets and in corporate
governance, in the wake of this year's accounting scandals and the
SEC's current campaign to force fundamental reforms on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   But Pitt suffered through intense media scrutiny, and the glare
may be even greater for his successor, at least at the outset.</TE>
<TE>   That spotlight may have dissuaded others from taking the job in
the past. Before Pitt was named 15 months ago, several other
candidates reportedly rejected the position.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't easy for them to find someone for the job when they got
Harvey," said Jonathan Macey, a securities law professor at Cornell
University.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Pitt's resignation has increased pressure on Webster,
78, to step down from the accounting oversight board.</TE>
<TE>   Webster was Pitt's choice to run the panel, which was created by
Congress in July to oversee the accounting industry and restore
investor trust in corporate financial data. But the process by which
Webster was picked ultimately cost Pitt his job.</TE>
<TE>   Webster said he informed Pitt before the SEC's Oct. 25 vote on
accounting board members that he had headed the audit committee of a
company, U.S. Technologies Inc., that had been sued by shareholders
for fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The audit committee also dismissed the firm's outside accountants
one month after the auditors questioned the company's financial
controls.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt did not reveal those facts to other commissioners before the
vote, sparking an outcry when they came to light.</TE>
<TE>   Webster this week said he would consider quitting if his presence
became an impediment to the board's work. Many observers expect him
to resign soon. He could not be reached for comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Many SEC observers predict that Robert Herdman, the agency's chief
accountant, also will resign. At Pitt's request, Herdman handled the
vetting of Webster before the SEC's vote.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt's resignation and the uncertainty surrounding Webster have
hurt SEC morale and slowed major policy initiatives, experts said.
But the oversight panel may be suffering the greater setback at the
moment.</TE>
<TE>   The panel, which must rely on the SEC to help coordinate its
start, lacks such necessities as office space, staff and funding. By
law it must be functional by late April, but it has yet to hold its
first meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Staff writer James Gerstenzang in Washington contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>Sonicblue's Sales Surge, Quarterly Loss Shrinks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Buoyed by strong sales of video products, Sonicblue Inc. on Wednesday
reported higher revenue and smaller losses for the third quarter
despite shrinking margins and the tardy arrival of new devices.</LD>
<LD>   But company executives acknowledged that they have several looming
problems that cloud the outlook for next year. These include the
potential delisting of Sonicblue's common stock and the large loans
that come due next October.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Clara, Calif.-based maker of digital audio and video
devices is trying to renegotiate the nearly $180 million in loans,
Chief Financial Officer Marcus K. Smith said, and it has asked the
Nasdaq exchange to shift it into the small-cap listings. The move
would give the company, which faces delisting on Nov. 18, at least 90
more days to lift its share price above the $1 minimum.</LD>
<TE>   Shares rose 6 cents on Wednesday to 76 cents.</TE>
<TE>   After the markets closed, the company reported a loss of $32.4
million, or 33 cents a share, compared with a loss of $55.3 million
in the same quarter last year. Sales rose to $78.4 million, up more
than 40% from last year.</TE>
<TE>   More than three-quarters of the sales were in video products, such
as DVD-VCR combination units, Smith said. A growing percentage came
in products whose profit margins are being narrowed by competition,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The company's gross margins for the quarter stood at only 7%, in
part because a new line of portable digital audio players didn't
arrive until late September, Smith said. The problems at the West
Coast ports contributed to that delay, but Chief Executive L. Gregory
Ballard said the main cause was the company waiting too long to do
product development.</TE>
<TE>   Ballard said retailers are demanding more of the company's
ReplayTV digital video recorders than its manufacturers can supply.
Sonicblue realizes only a fraction of revenue from those sales
immediately, however, so they've had no meaningful effect on the
company's bottom line, he said.</TE>

<HD>Regulators Present Evidence Against 12 Securities Firms</HD>
<DH>Findings by agencies probing analyst conflicts of interest
increase the chances of brokerages facing fines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. regulators have presented evidence that 12 of the largest
securities firms pressured analysts to promote investment-banking
clients, people familiar with the situation said.</LD>
<LD>   Citigroup Inc., U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc. and Credit Suisse
First Boston Inc. are among firms from which e-mail and other
internal documents were cited at a meeting among regulators Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The findings increase the likelihood that major securities firms
may face fines to head off charges they misled investors. When that
might happen was clouded Tuesday by the resignation of Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt.</LD>
<TE>   "We hope we can conduct any transactions with firms even without a
chairman," said New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer, who more than a
year ago began the investigations that later were joined by the SEC
and other regulators. "We'll have to wait to see how this unfolds,"
he said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the SEC, NASD (formerly the National Assn. of
Securities Dealers), New York Stock Exchange and regulatory agencies
from about a dozen states shared the material among themselves as
they sought to build their conflict-of- interest cases, the people
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The more smoking guns they have, the more bargaining chips they
have," said James Angel, a Georgetown University finance professor
and former visiting academic at the NASD. "It reflects on the basic
credibility of the firms. The firms may want to settle quickly to
keep this from dragging on any longer."</TE>
<TE>   The nine other firms in the negotiations are Morgan Stanley,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bear Stearns Cos., J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.,
Deutsche Bank, Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc., Thomas Weisel Partners,
UBS Warburg and Merrill Lynch.</TE>
<TE>   SEC Staff Seeks Fraud</TE>
<TE>   Charges Against Firms</TE>
<TE>   In the latest move by regulators in another Wall Street probe, SEC
investigators have told Goldman Sachs Group and J.P. Morgan Chase
that they plan to ask the agency to file fraud and market
manipulation charges against the firms, in connection with their
handling of initial public stock offerings.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC's staff alleges that the companies allotted shares in
initial public offerings to investors who promised to buy more stock
later at a higher price, ensuring a gain when trading began.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau, who said the company
received the so-called Wells notice in recent weeks alerting it to
the possibility of charges, said the bank denied any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman spokesman Lucas Van Praag said Goldman did nothing wrong
in allocating IPO shares.</TE>
<TE>   SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC notification is one of the last steps before the agency's
staff asks the commission to file a civil lawsuit or administrative
proceeding. After firms receive Wells notices, they are given a
chance to argue why a case shouldn't be brought.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan shares fell 41 cents to $22.06 and Goldman Sachs
shares lost 19 cents to $76.55, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>CBS Sues to Block New ABC Program</HD>
<DH>The network claims that 'Celebrity,' an alleged knockoff of
'Survivor' with famous contestants, would infringe its copyright.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Meg James</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Firing a shot aimed at defending its lucrative "Survivor" franchise,
CBS on Wednesday sued to block rival ABC from airing an alleged
knockoff show called "I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here."</LD>
<LD>   In its copyright infringement complaint filed in federal court in
New York, CBS asked a judge to stop ABC and Granada Entertainment USA
from "producing, broadcasting, displaying, publishing or otherwise
disseminating 'Celebrity' " or any other show modeled after
"Survivor."</LD>
<LD>   ABC executives declined to comment, saying they have not reviewed
the lawsuit. Granada Entertainment issued a statement calling the
infringement claim "unfounded," and promised to fight the
allegations.</LD>
<TE>   The Walt Disney Co.-owned network in September announced the
hiring of London-based Granada to produce 15 episodes of the show,
which first aired in August in Britain. ABC said its version would be
broadcast on consecutive nights, and considered airing the episodes
during the all-important February sweeps.</TE>
<TE>   "The series will follow the [Britain] version of dropping eight
celebrities in one of the world's most inhospitable climates with
just basic rations of rice and water," read ABC's Sept. 18 news
release. "They are at the mercy of television viewers who single out
a celebrity a night to undertake a physical challenge in order to win
enough food for the rest of the group."</TE>
<TE>   Contestants picked for the show would "not just be actors and
actresses but a wide variety of famous and infamous headline-makers,"
according to the ABC release.</TE>
<TE>   TV viewers, not show contestants, would vote for their favorites
to remain "in the camp" during the show's final week, similar to Fox
Broadcasting's summer sensation "American Idol," in which TV viewers
voted to keep their favorite would-be star on the program.</TE>
<TE>   In its 18-page lawsuit, Viacom-owned CBS alleged: " 'Celebrity'
was consciously designed to mimic 'Survivor' and unfairly trade on
its success."</TE>
<TE>   Similar to "Survivor," the ABC show will follow a group of people
stranded in a remote location as they compete in a series of physical
and mental challenges. Each episode ends with an "elimination
ceremony," the suit alleges.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, CBS sued Fox to halt broadcasts of a show called "Boot
Camp." That case quietly settled when "Boot Camp" failed in the
ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Castaway Productions Ltd., which owns the British rights to
"Survivor," also sued Granada in September for copyright
infringement. That case also is pending.</TE>

<HD>Syncor May Have Broken Bribery Laws</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. Scott Reckard and Ronald D. White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nuclear medicine provider Syncor International Corp. said Wednesday
that it may have broken U.S. bribery laws by making payments to
health-care facilities in Taiwan and China -- a disclosure that
hammered the stock price of the Woodland Hills company and put on
hold its pending acquisition by Cardinal Health Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Syncor Chairman Monty Fu and his brother, Moses Fu, who directs
the company's Asian operations, are on leave "pending completion of
an investigation into their involvement in the payments," the company
said.</LD>
<LD>   Monty Fu also stepped aside as a director, while a special
committee of Syncor's outside board members looks into possible
violations of the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars U.S.
companies from bribing foreign officials.</LD>
<TE>   The company wouldn't provide details about the payments that are
under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Syncor said it "does not currently believe" the questionable
payments are material to its financial results, but added that it
won't know for sure until the inquiry is complete.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the more pressing question is whether drug
wholesaling giant Cardinal -- which discovered the irregularities
last week during the pre-merger due-diligence process -- will call
off its deal to buy the much smaller Syncor for more than $900
million in stock and assumption of $200 million in debt.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal's interest is in Syncor's main business, the largest U.S.
chain of pharmacies that dispenses radioactive materials used in
diagnosing and, in some cases, treating diseases.</TE>
<TE>   As a unit of Dublin, Ohio-based Cardinal, Syncor would gain
leverage next year in renegotiating a key contract with Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. under which its 130 U.S. pharmacies sell Cardiolite, a
radioactive liquid that allows doctors to make images of blood flow
around patients' hearts. Cardiolite, which combines Bristol-Myers
chemicals with Syncor's expertise in radioactive substances, is by
far the company's most important product, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "If the merger doesn't go through, Syncor has a host of problems
trying to make it as a stand-alone," said Andrew L. Speller, an
analyst at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons, who Wednesday downgraded Syncor
shares from "hold" to "sell." Speller said Cardinal, for its part,
would be little affected if the deal fell apart.</TE>
<TE>   Syncor said after Cardinal alerted it to the problems, senior
managers notified the company's board, which decided by Saturday to
create the committee of outside directors. Attempting to defuse the
potentially explosive issue, the panel hired Robert Bennett, the
prominent Washington lawyer who represents Enron Corp. in its
dealings with the government.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett and a Cardinal attorney met Tuesday with officials of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department,
assuring them the company is serious about uncovering and correcting
any potential wrongdoing, a Syncor spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   SEC and Justice Department officials declined to comment. Bennett
and the independent directors couldn't be reached. Neither could the
Fus.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal's chief executive, Robert D. Walter, said he supported
Syncor's actions but has ordered a review of whether the merger
should be completed.</TE>
<TE>   "We consider this a very serious situation and we will continue to
closely monitor events," Walter said in an interview. "Cardinal
Health maintains the highest ethical standards in all of our
businesses, and we approach acquisitions with the same standards."</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Raymond G. Falci of Bear Stearns said Cardinal will
proceed cautiously but may well complete the deal because "there is
still a lot of strategic value in Syncor." A deal with Syncor, he
said, would give Cardinal "a leadership position" in nuclear medicine
distribution and a geographic presence in 80% of the major markets in
the U.S. "This could be one of the big growth areas in the
pharmaceutical industry," Falci added.</TE>
<TE>   Allan J. Mayer, a spokesman for Syncor, said the company is
investigating transactions in all foreign countries where it
operates, not just in China and Taiwan, where Cardinal turned up
questionable payments. "At this point, no questions have been raised
about the domestic operations, and none are expected to be," Mayer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Syncor rescheduled a shareholder meeting to Dec. 6 from Nov. 19 to
vote on the Cardinal deal. Its shares closed down $8.52 to $27.40 on
Nasdaq, a loss of 24%. Cardinal shares were up 72 cents to $70.01 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Audit Tenet Hospital Bills</HD>
<DH>Focus will be on large Medicare payments. Meanwhile, state
seeks to curb Redding doctors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Lee</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tenet Healthcare Corp. disclosed Wednesday that U.S. regulators are
preparing to audit its hospitals to determine whether the Santa
Barbara-based company properly billed Medicare for certain services.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services said the
audit, which was first made known to Tenet on Oct. 28, was prompted
by concerns raised by a contractor that processes Medicare claims for
the government.</LD>
<LD>   Department officials declined to provide details, but said the
audit would examine "outlier payments" made to Tenet's hospitals
nationally. These payments are special Medicare funds that are paid
to hospitals for unusually costly procedures, and Tenet has been
receiving an extraordinarily high share of these reimbursements.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said both the audit and the fact that Tenet waited more
than a week to disclose it presented problems.</TE>
<TE>   A Tenet spokesman defended the timing of the company's release,
saying it was waiting to get more specifics, but analysts expressed
exasperation at a company that has been rocked in the last two weeks
by a series of events that have hurt its credibility and erased
nearly half its stock price.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet was roundly criticized by investors after it waited a day to
disclose a federal raid last week at its hospital in Redding.</TE>
<TE>   "Here we go again," said Sheryl Skolnick, an analyst at Fulcrum
Global Partners in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet, the nation's second-largest publicly traded hospital
company, with 113 facilities, has been reeling amid Wall Street
questions about outlier Medicare payments and the investigation of
alleged medical fraud involving two doctors at the Redding facility.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the California attorney general's office, acting on
the request of the state medical board, said it would seek a court
order to prevent the two doctors, Chae Hyun Moon and Fidel
Realyvasquez Jr., from practicing medicine pending the outcome of the
probe.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney general spokesman said that papers seeking a temporary
restraining order probably would be filed Friday in Shasta County and
that a hearing would be held Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Moon, head of cardiology at Redding Medical Center, and
Realyvasquez, who is chairman of Redding Medical's cardiac surgery,
have continued to see patients since Oct. 31, when the FBI made
public that it was investigating whether the two doctors performed
numerous unnecessary heart procedures since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Joseph, executive director of the California Medical Board,
said Wednesday that based on the FBI's affidavit and his agency's
investigation, "we do believe there has been a violation of medical
practices."</TE>
<TE>   Realyvasquez's attorney, Malcolm Segal of Sacramento, said, "I
don't think there is any basis for" a restraining order. He added,
"When all this is done, I'm confident that Dr. Realyvasquez will be
exonerated."</TE>
<TE>   Moon could not be reached for comment, and his lawyer, John W.
Reese Jr. of Redding, did not return calls Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The two doctors have not been charged with anything. Tenet
executives have said it is up to the medical staff at Redding to
decide doctors' practicing privileges, although the company this week
took the step of having outside medical experts review the two
doctors' pending cases before any procedures are performed.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet has not been named as a target in the medical fraud
investigation, but the problems facing Moon and Realyvasquez could
eventually have a significant effect on the company's finances.</TE>
<TE>   Although Redding is a relatively small hospital, with 238 beds, it
is one of the company's most profitable -- largely because of the
high-volume cardiology program the two doctors established.</TE>
<TE>   Among other sources of revenue, Redding Medical Center receives an
unusually large share of outlier payments because the hospital
performs many specialized and costly heart procedures. Outlier
payments at Tenet have been a focus on Wall Street since Oct. 28,
when an analyst downgraded its stock and suggested that the company
relies too much on these special payments.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet, in a statement Wednesday, tried to put the best foot
forward on the federal audit.</TE>
<TE>   "We are pleased to cooperate with this audit, as we are confident
that it will demonstrate that our hospitals did, in fact, obey the
rules," said Jeffrey Barbakow, chairman and chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Shares were off 6 cents at $26.28 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Holtz, a spokeswoman for the Inspector General's Office at
the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, said
Wednesday that the agency notified Tenet by telephone of the audit
Oct. 28 -- the same day as the analyst's report.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet executives scheduled a conference call with analysts today
to provide details of outlier payments. They have said these payments
would account for about 5% of its revenue in the current fiscal year,
or about $780 million.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Weakley, the UBS Warburg analyst who first raised the outlier
issue, calculated that about 23% of Tenet's Medicare reimbursements
come from outlier payments, compared with an average of about 6% for
other comparable hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Despite persistent questions from analysts, Tenet has not yet said
how much these outlier payments contribute to earnings.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government has said it planned to review the entire
outlier payment program in the next year or so.</TE>

<HD>New Use for Thoratec's HeartMate Approved</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kerry Dooley</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thoratec Corp. on Wednesday won U.S. approval to sell an implantable
heart device as a permanent treatment for patients too sick for
transplants, opening a new market for the product.</LD>
<LD>   Thoratec already sells the HeartMate for use in heart failure
patients awaiting transplants. The device costs about $60,000 to
$70,000 and is too large for implantation in many women and some men,
said Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst Keay Nakae.</LD>
<LD>   Thoratec, which is based in Pleasanton, Calif., is racing with
Arrow International Inc. and World Heart Corp. to develop smaller and
less expensive products that do the same job, helping the heart pump
oxygen-rich blood out to the body, Nakae said.</LD>
<TE>   Doctors will be more likely to use later, improved versions of the
device for patients, he added.</TE>
<TE>   The new HeartMate use "is a great first step, but you are going to
need better second-generation devices," Nakae said.</TE>
<TE>   The approval by the Food and Drug Administration may raise
HeartMate's 2003 sales by about $10 million to $92 million, he said.
Revenue may be higher if the U.S. government's Medicare plan for the
elderly pays for the new use of the device, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Thoratec said it expects Medicare to issue guidelines for
reimbursement of permanent HeartMate use in the second half of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   HeartMate is about 4 inches in diameter and 2 inches thick. It
weighs more than 2 pounds. The batteries for the device remain
outside of the patient's body, carried in holster-like garments.</TE>
<TE>   About 2 million to 3 million Americans have heart muscle so
damaged that the organ no longer can pump blood adequately. Some of
the patients can be treated with medicines and only the most
seriously ill qualify for HeartMate.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Thoratec fell 7 cents to $9.24 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>A Landslide Loss for Hussein</HD>
<DH>Republican gains have given Bush his mandate to go to war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James P. Pinkerton</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York. E-mail: pinkerto@ix.netcom .com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nobody, it seems, knows anything about election forecasting. But
after the fact, everybody knows that the Republicans had a great
night.</LD>
<LD>   Of 10 political savants queried by the Washington Post on Sunday,
only three correctly predicted that the GOP would take over the
Senate, and only one got the right number of Republicans in the
House.</LD>
<LD>   Similarly, a Zogby/MSNBC tracking poll, released on Monday,
"called" seven of the most competitive Senate races, getting three
right, three wrong, with one still in doubt.</LD>
<TE>   And Tuesday morning, pundit Charlie Cook said of the Senate
contest, "If either side can be said to have even the slightest
advantage, it is Democrats."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, relying on the experts for insight into specific
electoral events is little better than a coin flip -- or maybe a
little worse. So it appears that election picking should be seen as
less of a semiscientific effort and more of a guessing game,
alongside such speculative ventures as predicting the stock market or
the winner of the next Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the numbers in question were small. The Republicans
have gained two, or maybe three, Senate seats, plus a few in the
House.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the implications are enormous because those tiny changes will
give Republicans a majority in the Senate again -- the first time the
party in the White House has gained a chamber in a midterm since the
election of senators began -- and allow them to keep control the
House.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, less than a month ago GOP spinners were attempting
to manage expectations downward, reminding spin-ees that the average
midterm election loss for the party holding the White House was 27.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the whole field of midterm electionology will have to be
rethought in the wake of Tuesday's results because the "iron law" --
that the party holding the White House loses congressional seats in
the off-year election -- has been broken twice in a row now, in 1998
as well as in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   But brittle statisticalizing aside, the reality is that Bush got a
huge boost, and much of that juice came from his hard-nosed foreign
policy.</TE>
<TE>   The president has talked little about the economy this year; for
most of the campaign season, the White House clearly preferred to let
its "sound bite of the day" concern Iraq, not the economy, stupid.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, sometimes Bush got a little carried away, as on Sept.
23 when he brayed that Senate Democrats were "not interested in the
security of the American people." Those words were widely criticized
at the time and, interestingly enough, have disappeared from the
White House Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the White House and the Republicans used a prospective
Department of Homeland Security as a wedge issue, seeking to define
Democrats who opposed the Bush bill as mere stooges of the public
employee unions, which were demanding labor control of the would-be
agency.</TE>
<TE>   That wedging worked, most notably in Georgia, where Sen. Max
Cleland (D), a triple amputee from Vietnam who had voted against Bush
on homeland security legislation, was defeated Tuesday by Rep. Saxby
Chambliss, a Republican who served in law school during that combat
era.</TE>
<TE>   So for the most part, the White House stayed masterfully on
message, and the message paid off.</TE>
<TE>   Now, of course, having won the Congress, Bush has to deliver. Item
No. 1 is the Iraq war.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, various big guns on the right have boomed out
their displeasure at American Middle East policy, questioning whether
Bush is serious about getting rid of Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   A Nov. 1 Washington Post column by Charles Krauthammer was
headlined "Don't Go Wobbly." Krauthammer demanded that Bush bypass
the go-slow pleading of Secretary of State Colin Powell and get on
with the Iraq-attacking.</TE>
<TE>   Bush probably will do just that. Yes, he has horsed around with
the United Nations for two months, but the Pentagon needed that time
anyway to put its forces into position.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, most American allies are still not reconciled to an
Iraq operation, but they didn't vote on Tuesday; the American people
voted.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to give Bush a mandate for military action, Americans gave
him one, much to the surprise of Washington pundits. Now it should be
no surprise what Bush does next.</TE>

<HD>Video Cameras Can Help Bring Justice More Sharply Into
Focus</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Schleiff</AU>
<BD>Henry Schleiff is chairman and chief executive of Court
TV, which is producing an original TV movie on the Michael Crowe
case.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just as DNA testing is revolutionizing the criminal justice system,
the video camera -- a staple of the television industry and of many
households -- is being called on to increase the transparency of that
system.</LD>
<LD>   DNA testing has revolutionized forensics by turning microscopic
evidence into irrefutable proof. Its extraordinary power comes from
its ability to use advanced and objective science and technology to
free the wrongly convicted and confirm the guilt of others. That
power provides great reassurance, but its pivotal role in reversing
several high-profile convictions also points out that there are
underlying flaws in the criminal justice process and that innocent
people do sometimes get convicted.</LD>
<LD>   It's tempting to think that DNA testing will right every wrong.
Unfortunately, DNA can solve only a relatively small number of cases,
generally those involving the presence of bodily fluids, hair or
skin. They are often highly visible cases -- murders and sexual
assaults, in particular -- but the vast majority of crimes have to be
solved without it. The challenge to the justice system is to reduce
the points of uncertainty in solving crimes.</LD>
<TE>   One point of uncertainty involves the process of interrogation and
confession, and that's where the call for video cameras is being
made. Just as they do in courtrooms across the nation, video cameras
have the power to make clear precisely what goes on. If a confession
is coerced through improper interrogation, it will be known.</TE>
<TE>   Allegations of coerced confessions, particularly involving
teenagers, have repeatedly surfaced, most recently in the case of the
New York City teenagers convicted in the 1989 rape of a Central Park
jogger.</TE>
<TE>   The concept of confessing to a crime that you did not commit seems
baffling, but a surprising number of teenagers do it. Once arrested
and separated from family and friends, they become frightened and
disoriented. A desire to do whatever is necessary to minimize the
problem can cause them to falsely confess.</TE>
<TE>   The case of Michael Crowe, a 14-year-old from Escondido, Calif.,
arrested in 1998 for the murder of his 12-year-old sister, is a
powerful example.</TE>
<TE>   From the outset, the police were suspicious of his reaction to his
sister's death and did not fully investigate another significant
lead: a vagrant who was arrested in the neighborhood with blood on
his clothes. Under intense police pressure, Crowe confessed.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, the police taped both the interrogation of Crowe and
his confession. When those tapes were later shown to a judge, it
became apparent that the confession had been coerced.</TE>
<TE>   Crowe was ultimately released, but only after he and his family
were put through an unimaginable ordeal. A DNA test later revealed
that the blood on the vagrant's clothes matched that of Crowe's
sister.</TE>
<TE>   The solution to the problem of coerced confessions by teenagers is
to make the system more transparent.</TE>
<TE>   If the interrogations and confessions of juveniles are routinely
videotaped, any coercion probably will be revealed. If the police act
properly, any suggestions that they exerted undue pressure will be
refuted.</TE>
<TE>   In the Central Park jogger case, the police may now wish that the
teenagers' interrogations had been taped along with their
confessions. Without complete tapes, suspicion of coercion may grow.</TE>
<TE>   Only two states -- Alaska and Minnesota -- require the taping of
interrogations. The taping of confessions is more common. But the
taping of confessions does not reveal what went on before; it does
not expose any coercion that may have taken place.</TE>
<TE>   Police departments are typically resistant to the taping of
interrogations. It is seen as an additional level of bureaucracy and
a restriction on the leverage -- not physical but emotional -- that
may be necessary to get the truly guilty to confess. Clearly not
everyone who confesses is innocent.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of juveniles, however, it seems hard to argue against
taped interrogations and confessions.</TE>
<TE>   The case of Michael Crowe is evidence enough.</TE>

<HD>Leftists Turn Blind Eye to Iraqis' Plight</HD>
<DH>Tyranny victims need U.S. help to win rights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Norah Vincent</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a writer and a senior fellow at the
Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after
9/11 to study terrorism. Web site: www.norahvincent.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If -- or almost certainly when -- we go to war in Iraq, it will not
be for humanitarian reasons. We will go to strike preemptively at
terrorism's biggest opportunist and shadiest eminence grise, Saddam
Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   But we will go for other, less presentable, reasons too. We will
go, as we did in 1991, to secure our oil interests in the region, to
wrest an indispensable commodity from the hands of a hostile vendor.
And finally, it's probably fair to say we will also go so that Bush
fils may correct his father's lingering mistake and at last depose
this gravest of political threats: a humiliated megalomaniac left
standing.</LD>
<LD>   The antiwar left finds none of these reasons sufficiently
compelling to justify an attack that it feels sure will slaughter
innocent Iraqi starvelings in hecatombs and further distress a
population already punished by draconian U.N. sanctions imposed after
the Gulf War.</LD>
<TE>   Fair enough. There is an admirably principled stand to be taken
against the sometimes bellicose Bush administration's justifications
for war in Iraq, especially when it concerns the fate of already
imperiled civilians. But in keeping with its habitual
anti-establishment posturing, the left has placed the blame for the
alleged atrocities against the Iraqi people almost exclusively on the
U.S. rather than on the party most directly responsible for them,
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   This has put the left in the odd position of bewailing crimes
committed against the Iraqi people while at the same time doing
everything in its power to oppose the only means -- violence -- of
toppling the very perpetrator of these crimes.</TE>
<TE>   War alone, however anathema it may seem on principle to the
pacifist contingent, can secure a reprieve for the tortured Iraqi
people and is therefore justifiable in humanitarian terms.</TE>
<TE>   Appeasement, though, far from ensuring peace, would subject Iraqis
to yet more violence, subjugation and deprivation at the hands of
their kleptocratic leader. Diplomacy has failed. There is no
bargaining with Hussein, no appealing to his better nature even on
domestic issues. This is hardly surprising because he is a confessed
admirer and epigone of Josef Stalin.</TE>
<TE>   The establishment left's failure to make this argument and its
strange apologetics for Hussein are reminiscent, in fact, of the
odious stand it once took on Hussein's hero. For most of the last
century, the left turned a blind eye again and again to the
documented suffering of the Soviet people as well as to Stalin's
infliction of it.</TE>
<TE>   This posture was then, and is now, nothing less than an
unconscionable betrayal of one of the left's purportedly most
cherished principles: an ongoing commitment to social justice and
human rights. The left prefers to believe that the Iraqi people
unanimously support the status quo and oppose the American agenda,
though copious evidence to the contrary has surfaced in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   When, after a sham landslide reelection, Hussein emptied his
prisons last month, family members of missing political prisoners
protested openly, demanding to know why their loved ones remained
unaccounted for.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, the West caught a glimpse of true public opinion in
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Western journalists reported being
surreptitiously approached by civilians who assured them that many
Iraqis secretly supported President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi people need and want our help. Can the left, in good
conscience, be deaf to their cause?</TE>

<LD>President Bush can justifiably take pride in the GOP's historic
victory Tuesday. Bush, who put his prestige on the line in vigorously
campaigning, played a key role in becoming the first Republican
president since Theodore Roosevelt in 1902 and 1906 to see his party
gain seats in a midterm election. But the question facing a president
who entered office on a platform of "compassionate conservatism" is
simple. Will Bush follow in Roosevelt's footsteps by using GOP
dominance to pursue policies that broaden his party's appeal? Or will
he pursue a more radical agenda?</LD>
<LD>   As impressive as the GOP results are, they do not constitute a
mandate for sweeping changes in tax policies, judicial independence,
civil rights and the environment. The margin of victory in both the
Senate and the House was too narrow to support the conclusion that
the electorate has moved decisively to the right. The internal
disarray and timidity of the Democrats surely played as much a part
in pushing the GOP over the top as Bush's shrewd and relentless focus
on the fight against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   When Congress reconvenes Tuesday, it probably will shove through
important stalled legislation. Two good bills likely to pass in the
lame-duck session are terrorism insurance for businesses and a
Medicare giveback that will benefit nursing homes, hospitals and home
health-care providers.</LD>
<TE>   The real test of the administration's program will come next year.
With a limping economy, Bush may well push for accelerating his
10-year tax cut and making it permanent. If the economy really heads
south, there may be a case for a targeted tax cut that stimulates
where interest rate cuts -- the latest, a half-percentage-point
reduction, came Wednesday -- have failed. But making the tax cuts
permanent was a bad idea in the last Congress and it remains a lousy
one: It would cause massive federal deficits. After 2012, permanent
tax cuts would cost the Treasury about $4 trillion in revenues over
the following decade.</TE>
<TE>   Another harbinger of extremist policies will be if the
administration returns to its proposal for opening Alaska's Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.</TE>
<TE>   But there are hopeful signs. Bush has worked patiently with the
United Nations Security Council to reach a new resolution on Iraq
rather than rushing headlong into a unilateral war. He has also
carefully attempted to push North Korea to abandon its nuclear arms
program. At home, the United States could only benefit from the
administration's taking a similarly restrained  approach in domestic
matters.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, voters gave Bush a rare opportunity to put his stamp
on politics for decades. But only if in victory he pursues
magnanimity and follows mainstream policies that unite the country.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Education was the big winner Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Deplorable though the election was -- dismal turnout, bland
candidates, relentless negative television ads -- once again
California voters generally chose well on the ballot propositions.</LD>
<LD>   A majority of near-landslide proportions -- 59% -- backed
higher-quality education by voting for Proposition 47, a
$13.5-billion bond issue for construction and renovation of public
school buildings and college and university facilities. By a like
margin, voters in the Los Angeles Unified School District approved a
$3.3-billion school construction bond measure. The district can use
that money to match the money it will get from the state.</LD>
<TE>   Statewide, voters approved a $2.1-billion bond issue for
low-income housing and shelters and a $3.4-billion issue for a
variety of water supply projects and to buy pristine lands that are
threatened with development.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, they also supported Proposition 49, the initiative
put on the ballot by Arnold Schwarzenegger to divert $550 million a
year from the state's general fund to pay for after-school programs.
The idea is commendable, but with the state facing a budget crisis
this is not a good time to earmark so much money to start a new
program. The governor and Legislature should decide spending
priorities.</TE>
<TE>   The Proposition 49 campaign gave Schwarzenegger wide exposure in
the political arena, leading to speculation that this campaign was a
warmup for a GOP run for governor in 2006. "I'll be back," the
actor-turned-activist vowed. But he said it would be to help
implement the program.</TE>
<TE>   Voters were more discerning in rejecting two ballot initiatives:
Proposition 51, to dedicate about $1 billion a year in sales taxes to
a long list of dubious transportation projects; and Proposition 52,
to allow prospective voters to register at the polls on election day,
a possible invitation to voter fraud. Proposition 51 was bankrolled
primarily by interests that would have benefited from projects
financed by the measure. Both initiatives lost decisively even though
the sponsors advertised extensively on television and there was
little visible opposition. People saw through the misleading ads and
voted smart.</TE>

<LD>Voters citywide said Tuesday to keep Los Angeles united, defeating
San Fernando Valley secession 2 to 1, and Hollywood secession by an
even wider margin. Now it's time for secession advocates to accept
that victory and get to work to make the city better.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, victory. Even its critics, and this page has been a big one,
credit the Valley secession movement with spurring reforms at City
Hall. The momentum already generated by neighborhood councils isn't
going to stop with Tuesday's vote, not with hundreds of ordinary
Angelenos busily organizing to get the city's ear on traffic,
graffiti and other neighborhood concerns.</LD>
<LD>   As loath as secession leaders may be to admit it, their movement
even energized Mayor James K. Hahn. With a temperament more languid
than lively, Hahn got off to a lackluster start in office. Then the
secession campaign gave him a focus, one he rightly made into not
just defeating a breakup but giving residents a reason to stay.</LD>
<TE>   The once-invisible mayor was suddenly everywhere, especially in
the Valley. Got a pothole? A buckled sidewalk? An untrimmed tree?
Hahn would all but show up himself, toolbox in hand.</TE>
<TE>   By election day, the strait-laced mayor was singing "I Love L.A."
and twirling his sister, City Councilwoman Janice Hahn, in an
impromptu jitterbug. (OK, maybe he's getting a little too relaxed.)
The trick, of course, will be to keep working to make the city -- on
both sides of Mulholland Drive -- a better place to live.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor and City Council members were back in the Valley the day
after the election pledging just that, and we urge them to be bold in
carrying out that promise. But making the city work isn't the job of
just its elected leaders. In reforming its antiquated charter to
create the grass-roots councils and regional planning boards, the
city gave residents a template to get things done in their
neighborhoods. But it's like voting -- you have to get up and do it.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, some secession leaders have already declared that
they won't work with this mayor or give up trying to break up this
city. Forget that Hollywood secession, a last-minute effort
bankrolled by a nightclub owner who wanted to be mayor, lost
overwhelmingly even within the proposed new city's borders. Never
mind that Valley secession, promoted for decades, barely eked out a
majority in the Valley itself, winning 50.77% of votes there and only
33% citywide. Secession leaders say they will ask a court to throw
out the citywide votes or will launch a statewide initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Rejecting the very thing they said they wanted -- a vote of the
people -- is typical of a movement that has continually spurned the
reforms it spurred.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders first backed, then dismissed neighborhood
councils without giving them a chance -- in a huff over the reform
commission's decision to make the councils advisory only. They
supported a change in state law eliminating the City Council's veto
power over secession in exchange for requiring a citywide vote --
until they lost that vote. Now some of them want the Legislature to
change the law again.</TE>
<TE>   Government is the art of consensus and compromise. Secession is
about storming out of the room when things don't go exactly your way.
No one's calling for holding hands and singing "Kumbaya" -- just
rolling up sleeves and working together as one city.</TE>

<LD>Re "Get a Handle on Casinos," editorial, Nov. 4:</LD>
<LD>   Given the history of Native Americans' treatment by settlers,
miners, missionaries, land speculators, ranchers, oilmen and local,
state and federal governments, you must have a broken sense of irony
to complain of the "uncontrolled effects of casino construction and
expansion on local communities."</LD>
<LD>   A little inequity in the tribes' favor does not seem such a bad
thing, given the historical perspective.</LD>

<TE>   It's a sad lesson that our political system has taught to the
Native Americans: Either contribute large sums of money to
politicians or remain marginalized.</TE>
<TE>   Now, like others who lobby for special interests, Native Americans
become another symbol of the need for public financing of campaigns.</TE>

<LD>Is it just me, or are our highways filthy? For many months now I have
been acutely aware of the enormous amount of wastepaper, containers
and even furniture dumped at the side of our freeways. My guess is
that the garbage is piling up faster than the Adopt-a-Highway folks
can clean it up. As I showed a friend from the East Coast around our
county recently, I was embarrassed by the condition of our roadsides.
It saddens me that we have so little respect for the beauty of our
home.</LD>
<LD>   With the gargantuan problems facing our nation and the world
today, this may seem a petty gripe. But if we cannot even respect
ourselves and our own environment, how on Earth can we hope to
respect others?</LD>

<LD>Re "GOP Takes Control of Senate," Nov. 6: This is a day which will
live in infamy. The Bush cartel has consolidated its power and now
controls the executive branch, the U.S. House, Senate and Supreme
Court. The most right-wing government in American history is now free
to pursue its goals, unimpeded by dissent. It is a sobering thought
to realize that the world's most dangerous man, George W. Bush, will
now preside over an agenda inspired by fear, loathing and greed.</LD>
<LD>   To the American voters who stayed away from the polls, you got
what you deserved. When, in the near future, you ask how this could
have happened, take a good, hard look at yourself in the mirror.</LD>

actually offer Americans a clear, compelling alternative.</TE>

Republican or Democrat is not the issue here. This is about "the

<TE>   The Democrats deserve the defeat they suffered on Tuesday. Their
failure to stand strong against the Bush administration's rollback of
every progressive policy of the last 50 years has given validity to
President Bush and left the public believing the fight was based only
on party rather than principle. Sen. Paul Wellstone was the lone
beacon of integrity in the debates of the Senate. His death signaled
the end of any serious opposition by the Democrats to the Bush
policies.</TE>

<LD>Re "41 Hurt in 198-Vehicle Smashup," Nov. 4: It's called tailgating!
Tailgating is the most common complaint about drivers in the entire
country, but in California it is de rigueur, it is expected, it is
the style, and it is stupid. The great majority of drivers know how
to put pedal to the metal but they haven't the slightest idea about
the distance requirements for stopping the beast or the time to react
for events ahead of them.</LD>

<TE>   I'd like to think that after 198 cars collided due to a dangerous
mix of poor visibility and high speed, Angelenos will now drive
smarter when conditions deteriorate. But I doubt it. Everyone has the
attitude that something like the 198-car pile-up would never happen
to them. News flash: There are 198 drivers who also thought it would
never happen to them.</TE>

<LD>Re "Jewish Radical Irv Rubin Gravely Injured in Jail," Nov. 5: I had
the honor of talking to Irv Rubin on two occasions, in regard to the
slave labor used during World War II by the parent builder of the
WWII memorial on the National Mall in Washington, Philipp Holzmann. I
hesitate to commend everything Rubin did or said, but let it be known
that on a personal level Rubin was a kind and honorable man.</LD>
<LD>   He was very supportive of my efforts to expose the hypocrisy of
having "Hitler's builder" participate in the sacred memorial to the
heroes of WWII, and I will never forget the kind words he said to me,
and his determination to never let the profiteers of death forget
that people of honor will "never forget."</LD>

<TE>   So, Rubin's wife believes that someone tried to murder him when he
slit his throat and took a header off a jail balcony because he
"would never have violated Jewish law by taking his own life." How
interesting. Doesn't Jewish law also prohibit trying to blow up
people -- even people of another religion?</TE>

<LD>Wow, Bill Simon did better in the California governor's race than
anyone expected (Nov. 6). Despite being the worst Republican
candidate in recent history, he came within five points of beating
Gov. Gray Davis. If only the GOP had nominated someone more
experienced, competent and moderate, it could've won the governor's
race easily.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe the losers will learn a lesson and change their strategy in
four years. But probably not. They seem to be content nominating
right-wing ideologues who can't win a general election.</LD>

<TE>   I am a 75-year-old, lifelong Democrat who was looking for an
alternative to Davis. As usual, the California Republican Party
decided it would rather be "right" than victorious. One could
maintain that I could have voted for a third party, but I am certain
that's a wasted vote. It's really time for the Republicans to
recognize where the electorate of this state is and give us
candidates that reflect this.</TE>

<LD>Re "U.S. Enters a Legal Gray Zone," Nov. 5: It now appears that we
have a new terrorist to add to the list along with Osama bin Laden,
and that is President Bush himself. The fact that Bush allowed the
CIA to kill suspected Al Qaeda members -- who were only suspects, who
might have been enemies of the U.S. -- brings up some important
questions: Can we now assassinate Saddam Hussein, Fidel Castro and
the heads of other governments, such as North Korea, that we define
as enemies of the U.S.? Does it make the CIA an international
terrorist organization whose members could be subject to
international law and be charged with war crimes?</LD>
<LD>   As M. Cherif Bassiouni, professor of international law, was quoted
as saying, "It suddenly puts governments at the same level as
terrorists."</LD>
<LD>   I now fear President Bush as much as I do Bin Laden and Al Qaeda.
I believe that Bush's new, reckless policy can only make the U.S.
even more vulnerable to further terrorist attacks.</LD>

win a battle. After recent events like the assassinations in Yemen, I
am afraid they are close to winning the war.</TE>

<LD>Re "AQMD Puts Off Ban on Solvent," Nov. 2: There's a chemical that
could harm me every time I go into a dry cleaner. There are
alternative ways to clean clothes that are safe for workers and
consumers and profitable for cleaners. And the South Coast Air
Quality Management District can't decide whether to phase the poison
out ... 17 years from now? With this kind of leadership, no wonder
L.A.'s air is still the dirtiest in the nation. I hope the clean-air
board shows some courage and gets rid of perchloroethylene. And I
hope some enterprising cleaners out my way switch to wet cleaning
long before the 17-year deadline kicks in. When they do, they'll have
my business.</LD>

<HD>Bruce Achauer, 59; Plastic Surgeon, O.C. Burn Center
Director</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Haldane</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Bruce M. Achauer, director of the UC Irvine Medical Center's
Regional Burn Center for 22 years and an internationally recognized
expert on reconstructive surgery, has died of an unidentified
bacterial infection.</LD>
<LD>   Achauer would have turned 60 on Monday. "It was very unexpected
and shocking for all of us," said Victoria VanderKam, the Orange burn
center's program director and nurse manager who had worked with him
for more than 20 years. "Bruce was an extraordinary person. We are
shocked, stunned and devastated."</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Marianne Cinat, the center's co-director since 1998, said,
"People here are very saddened. It's a huge loss."</LD>
<TE>   Achauer -- whose patients included David Rothenberg, a 6-year-old
who was set afire by his father in a Buena Park motel room in 1983,
and Cheryl Bess, a teenage girl who had been assaulted and burned
with acid in 1984 -- died about 11 p.m. Monday in a San Antonio
hospital after falling ill over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Achauer was there to attend the annual conference of the National
American Society of Plastic Surgeons.</TE>
<TE>   "He was here on Wednesday, he did surgery and we all saw him,"
VanderKam said. "On Thursday he flies out, and on Tuesday morning we
hear that he's dead. There's a lot of emotion here, a lot of grief
and a lot of tears."</TE>
<TE>   During his 35-year career, Achauer conducted major medical
research projects, wrote more than 150 scientific articles and four
books, taught at several universities, treated both famous and
indigent patients and became one of the world's preeminent plastic
surgeons.</TE>
<TE>   He recently completed a two-year term as president of the American
Board of Plastic Surgery, the field's governing body, and had
published a five-volume textbook, considered, VanderKam said, "the
comprehensive bible of plastic surgery" in America.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a passion for burn care," she said. "He was involved in
developing and refining new types of treatment."</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of Stanford University and Houston's Baylor College of
Medicine, Achauer -- who chose his career at age 13 after working in
his father's pharmacy -- interned at San Francisco General Hospital
beginning in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   While there, he observed plastic surgeons reconstructing
disfigured patients and decided that that's what he wanted to
specialize in.</TE>
<TE>   "Plastic surgery is precise and creative, and the reconstructive
cases are all unique and difficult," he said. "Each presents a new
challenge, [and] I'm also able to develop a long-term relationship
with my patients."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, said Beverly Brenda, administrator of his private
practice in Orange, those patients included many victims of
life-threatening disfigurements -- often in foreign countries --
whose services were funded by the elective "aesthetic" surgeries he
performed for pay.</TE>
<TE>   Achauer is survived by his wife, Tamara, and two grown daughters,
Allison and Hilary.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral services will be private.</TE>

<HD>Baseball Lawsuit Goes on Road</HD>
<DH>The fight over Barry Bonds' 73rd home run ball moves to law
school for a day of arguments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rone Tempest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The ball fight continues.</LD>
<LD>   A seven-game World Series has come and gone. The trees are
shedding russet and orange leaves. Sports talk has turned to
basketball and hockey.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the tawdry tussle over Barry Bonds' record 73rd home run ball
resumed Wednesday where it began more than three weeks ago.</LD>
<TE>   When it is all over, estimated one participant in the civil
lawsuit, the trial could end up costing close to the $1 million the
record-setting ball is said to be worth to collectors.</TE>
<TE>   "I would think that the cost to both parties would be a
significant piece of what the ball is worth," said Keith Kamisugi, a
public relations spokesman for Patrick Hayashi, who ended up with the
historic ball when the slugger knocked it into the stands at San
Francisco's Pacific Bell Park on Oct. 7, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In an unusual twist, part of the trial was held Wednesday before
several hundred students at UC Hastings College of the Law in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Hastings law professor Marsha Cohen said she came up with the idea
because of the extraordinary interest among the legal community. The
case deals with areas in the law of property that have not been
addressed since 1805, when they were debated in a landmark
fox-hunting case.</TE>
<TE>   Presiding Superior Court Judge Kevin McCarthy, who also teaches at
Hastings, embraced the proposal for a round-table discussion among
legal scholars -- three from the plaintiffs and one for the defense
-- that took place Wednesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Triano, attorney for Berkeley restaurateur Alex Popov, who
first snagged the ball -- only to lose track of it in the resulting
melee -- claims the whole courtroom fight could have been avoided if
Hayashi had agreed to his client's initial offer a year ago to
"settle things over a beer."</TE>
<TE>   Despite four attempts at arbitration, two weeks in court and
general ridicule in the San Francisco public arena, both claimants to
the ball remain intransigent, dug in at the plate for the full count.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony so far has included that of a 15-year-old fan who
claimed that someone bit him on the leg in the dog-pile scramble for
the ball and from a folksy major league umpire who told the court,
"I'm a judge too, on the field."</TE>
<TE>   Umpire Jim Evans, a veteran of 28 years on the diamond, was
brought in from Kissimmee, Fla., for the trial and paid $150 an hour
for his efforts. A biomedical engineer called by the defense was paid
$275 an hour. Each side in the suit has three lawyers, in a city
where attorneys generally get from $200 to $500 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the spiraling costs, the prospect of reaching a
Solomonesque solution in which the two sides split the proceeds from
auctioning off the ball appears more and more remote.</TE>
<TE>   "We will do whatever it takes to win," said Hayashi attorney
Donald Tamaki. "We had four opportunities, and in each case the other
side rejected it."</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Triano said there are higher principles at stake, not
just cash. He claims Popov, a strapping 6-footer, was mugged by
riotous souvenir seekers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone wants to see ballparks turned into European
soccer riots," Triano said.</TE>
<TE>   "What's it going to take: an 8-year-old child getting trampled to
death?"</TE>

<KH>THE WINONA RYDER VERDICT</KH>
<HD>Will Conviction Tarnish or Burnish Image?</HD>
<DH>Hollywood experts say outcome of the case will have a
negligible effect on the actress' career.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Calvo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Longevity in Hollywood demands great looks and good connections, and
any handler worth his 10% commission knows it also calls for a tight
hold around the sharp corners of a comeback.</LD>
<LD>   Actress Winona Ryder may be in for a white-knuckle ride over the
next few months, but experts across Hollywood said Wednesday
morning's conviction for grand theft and vandalism will not have a
long-lasting impact on her career.</LD>
<LD>   Ryder, 31, was arrested last December at Saks Fifth Avenue in
Beverly Hills with more than $5,500 of goods in her possession. She
was charged with felony grand theft, burglary and vandalism. For the
last week she sat in court but did not testify on her own behalf.</LD>
<TE>   For an actress who established her screen presence more than a
decade ago with offbeat, cynical flicks like "Heathers" (1989) and
"Edward Scissorhands" (1990), daily trial coverage has been a jolt of
unwanted, unmanaged Jerry Springer-esque exposure. At one point, she
injured her arm in the crush of media following her into the
courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Meyer of Sitrick &amp; Co., one of the biggest crisis management
firms in the country, said the "injury day" was emblematic of how
poorly Ryder's ordeal has been handled from the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   "She was only charged with shoplifting, not felony hit-and-run or
child molestation. It should have been a 48-hour story, not a
six-month story. Why this wasn't resolved very quickly, I don't
understand," Meyer said, adding that the pair of convictions were "a
real blow."</TE>
<TE>   "The easiest way out of something like this is to acknowledge you
did it and throw yourself on the public's mercy. Show remorse. Be
contrite. People love that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder's sentencing hearing is scheduled for Dec. 6, and while
prosecutors in the case say they will not ask that the Academy
Award-nominated siren serve time, the trial and its preparation cut
into time she spent on developing film projects.</TE>
<TE>   Her publicist, Mara Buxbaum, insists business is booming, but the
claim that Ryder was approached this year to star in at least one
film could not be independently confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   Buxbaum said Ryder will "definitely not be doing the talk show
circuit" after the trial, although the actress probably will sit down
at some point for the obligatory tell-all interview.</TE>
<TE>   One publicist, whose roster of clients includes big movie stars
and producers, said Ryder should lie low for several months and turn
down all requests for tell-all TV shows and books.</TE>
<TE>   "She will be offered scripts and roles. She will not be shut out,"
the publicist predicted. "There are certain crimes people look past.
Spousal abuse or child abuse, you don't get a lot of sympathy. Drugs
and shoplifting, people look past it. They're not going to oust her."</TE>
<TE>   Another agent, who also agreed to talk only on condition of
anonymity, said difficult actors are not uncommon. The agent said
producers and studios need to be gently reassured that Ryder remains
stable.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is that instead of being No. 2 on the list, she might be
No. 3. It won't make a difference about her career," the agent said,
emphasizing that Ryder should look for high-profile, creative
scripts, and she should stay away from smaller projects or projects
whose only appeal is another A-list star.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were Winona's agent today, I would be much more interested
in an Eric Roth [screenwriter of "The Insider," "Forrest Gump"]
script than I would be in her playing against Edward Norton. I would
be much more interested in her doing a picture with [director] Peter
Weir ["Dead Poets Society," "The Truman Show"] than a picture with
Matt Damon."</TE>
<TE>   But Fox Filmed Entertainment Chairman Tom Rothman, whose company
made "Alien Resurrection" (1997) and "The Crucible" (1996) with
Ryder, said observers are over-thinking her next big move. Ryder's
reputation, Rothman said, is so solid that the convictions cannot
tarnish it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not in any active discussions with her, but I certainly would
hire her again in a minute," Rothman said. "She's reliable,
committed, disciplined."</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, during the legal maelstrom, she stuck with her
commitment to promote the film, "Mr. Deeds," in which she co-starred
with Adam Sandler. She hosted NBC's "Saturday Night Live" and during
the opening monologue poked fun at her legal troubles, pretending to
swipe things from the set.</TE>
<TE>   It was at about the same time that she posed for the cover of W
magazine wearing a T-shirt with her picture and the words "Free
Winona."</TE>
<TE>   Those appearances left many Hollywood image crafters scratching
their heads. They thought her humorous approach to the charges only
added to negative buzz.</TE>
<TE>   But Lorne Michaels, executive producer of "Saturday Night Live,"
said his show has always been a good place for celebrities and
politicians to confront gossip.</TE>
<TE>   "When something from your personal life is a big part of the
public's perception of you, you have to deal with it," Michaels said.
"You have to be topical."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Walter, a professor in the screenwriting program at UCLA's
School of Theater, Film and Television, said Ryder's career was
already losing steam -- but because of her age, not because of the
trial. At 31, she has spent nearly half her life in the spotlight,
robbing her of the coveted titles of either "ingenue" or "newcomer."
So, while some advisors-for-hire winced at the daily trial coverage,
Walter thought it offered a nice bump to a career that had reached a
plateau.</TE>
<TE>   "Remember Robert Mitchum and his marijuana bust? The man went to
prison for that for several months," Walter said. "He waltzed right
out of jail."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchum was arrested in 1948 after authorities caught him toking
up with an actress in an L.A. apartment. He served two months on a
prison honor farm, but in 1951 an appeals court overturned the guilty
verdict. Still, the original conviction, in the words of the New York
Times, "enhanced his image as a rebel."</TE>

<HD>Vinnette Carroll, 80; Pioneering Theater Director</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>Vinnette Carroll, Broadway's first black woman director, died Tuesday
in Lauderhill, Fla. Carroll, who brought African American-oriented
musical theater to a wider public in the 1970s, had suffered a stroke
last year and had symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, though the exact
cause of death was not announced. She was 80.</LD>
<LD>   Carroll, who also was an actress, was best known for directing
Micki Grant's musical revue "Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope" in the
early 1970s and for adapting the Gospel According to St. Matthew into
the 1976 musical "Your Arms Too Short to Box With God," which Carroll
also staged.</LD>
<LD>   "Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope" was developed from Carroll's
off-off-Broadway Urban Arts Corps and eventually became a hit on
Broadway, where Carroll received a Tony Award nomination. In Los
Angeles, Carroll staged "Cope" at the Mark Taper Forum in 1972 in a
production that then moved to the Huntington Hartford (now the
Doolittle) Theatre in Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   "She was a force of nature," said Taper artistic director Gordon
Davidson, "and she loved being a mentor and generator of
opportunities for others."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll developed "Your Arms" for the Spoleto, Italy, Festival of
Two Worlds in 1975, premiered it at Ford's Theatre in Washington and
then took it to Broadway, where she received Tony nominations for her
script and staging.</TE>
<TE>   "No one knows how to energize a stage better than she does," wrote
Newsweek critic Jack Kroll. The show returned to Broadway twice and
also toured.</TE>
<TE>   Her work of that era was "breathtakingly exciting," said Barbara
Hauptman, executive director of the Society of Stage Directors and
Choreographers and a former Urban Arts managing director. "And she
had the best, most infectious laugh ever."</TE>
<TE>   In a 1979 interview, Carroll told The Times, "I decided my
salvation was to create something for myself, a theater for myself
and others where your main worry wasn't getting a [television]
series. When I first heard gospel -- I'd grown up in the Anglican
church -- I just flipped. 'You mean religion can be like this?' I
said."</TE>
<TE>   The daughter of a dentist, Carroll spent much of her childhood
with grandparents in Jamaica. But she was brought to New York at the
age of 10. She and her sisters became the only black students at
their New York public school.</TE>
<TE>   She credited her "very cultured" mother with many of her values.
"She didn't want us to be bitter about race," she said. "If we used
slang, she'd say, 'How poverty-stricken of you.' "</TE>
<TE>   Prodded by her father to become a doctor, Carroll graduated from
Long Island University and received a master's degree in psychology
from New York University. She was on the brink of obtaining a
doctorate from Columbia University, when she decided that her true
passion was in the theater.</TE>
<TE>   After studying acting with the director Erwin Piscator, she began
acting and directing in the '50s, staging a production of "Dark of
the Moon" at the Harlem YMCA with a cast that included James Earl
Jones, Roscoe Lee Browne and Cicely Tyson. She received a 1961 Obie
Award for "Moon on a Rainbow Shawl" and a 1964 Emmy Award for
co-conceiving and supervising the TV program "Beyond the Blues."</TE>
<TE>   In 1967, Carroll became the first director of the New York State
Arts Council's Ghetto Arts Program and began to develop the Urban
Arts Corps. She also made her Los Angeles directing debut that year,
at Inner City Cultural Center.</TE>
<TE>   Among her film credits as an actress were "One Potato, Two
Potato," "Up the Down Staircase" and "Alice's Restaurant."</TE>
<TE>   She had lived in Florida since 1980 and operated the Vinnette
Carroll Repertory Company in Fort Lauderdale.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by a sister, Dorothy Hudgins, of New York and
Florida.</TE>

<HD>Tamara Hareven, 65; Professor and Writer on Family Studies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tamara Kern Hareven, a historian whose interest in the family ranged
from the effects of industrialization to the silk-weaving tradition,
has died. Hareven, who was 65, died Oct. 18 in a hospital in Newark,
Del., of kidney disease, according to a family friend, Perry F.
Goldlust.</LD>
<LD>   Hareven, who was Unidel professor of family studies and history at
the University of Delaware in Newark, began studying the family at
the Amoskeag Mills in Manchester, N.H. Her book stemming from that
study -- "Amoskeag: Life and Work in an American City"(1978) -- was
praised at the time by Benjamin DeMott in the Atlantic magazine as
"no-frills history, solid and grainy."</LD>
<LD>   "Yet the lives here recorded do breathe -- attain, indeed,
considerable cumulative impact before the end," DeMott said. The book
won the New England Oral History Assn. Award.</LD>
<TE>   Hareven doubted myths popular before the 20th century regarding
the family as a social institution. For example, she questioned the
American nostalgia for the idea that three generations -- parents,
children and grandparents -- had once routinely lived under one roof
and that industrialization had robbed them of this happy model.
Hareven said grandparents survived only rarely to even know their
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   She also promoted the idea of families once again offering lodging
to others, a common arrangement in the United States in the 19th
century that died away with the availability of housing and the move
toward privacy.</TE>
<TE>   "We're now seeing the limitations to privacy, how it isolates the
elderly," she told the Associated Press in 1980. "They're willing to
trade privacy for companionship." The elderly could help young
families and give children the opportunity to learn from older
people, she said.</TE>
<TE>   She also studied divorce in China and silk weavers in Japan,
France and Austria, especially the way their skills were passed down
from one generation to the next. Her book on that topic, "The Silk
Weavers of Kyoto: Family and Work in a Changing Traditional Society,"
is due from the University of California Press this month.</TE>
<TE>   Her other books on the family include "Family Time and Industrial
Time: The Relationship Between the Family and Work in a New England
Industrial Community" (1982). She also was editor of many other books
on the family and kinship.</TE>
<TE>   Hareven was born May 10, 1937, in Romania, where she and her
parents were imprisoned by the Nazis during World War II. All
survived and moved to Israel when the war was over.</TE>
<TE>   She received her bachelor's degree from Hebrew University of
Jerusalem, her master's from the University of Chicago and her
doctorate from Ohio State University. She was a senior Fulbright
fellow to India in 1978 and to Japan in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   She had no immediate survivors.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two anti-logging activists were arrested in the latest skirmish
between Pacific Lumber Co. and Humboldt County demonstrators.</LD>
<LD>   A man and a woman, who refused to give their names, were arrested
Tuesday and booked for investigation of trespassing and interfering
with a legal business.</LD>
<LD>   The two sides are disputing the interpretation of a recent
Superior Court ruling. Activists say it orders the timber company to
halt logging operations. Pacific Lumber disagrees.</LD>
<TE>   At least a dozen people are occupying trees on Pacific Lumber land
in Freshwater. One woman calling herself Remedy has been living in an
ancient redwood for seven months.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, several tree-sitters on Pacific Lumber land in the
Mattole forest were arrested because those trees were scheduled for
cutting.</TE>
<TE>   The latest arrests came as Pacific Lumber employees were cutting
trees near the site of the protests to build logging access roads,
part of the company's state-approved timber harvest plan, according
to a Pacific lumber spokeswoman.</TE>

<LD>The Diocese of Fresno will not make its annual contribution to a

the diocese's investments, church leaders said.</LD>
<LD>   The diocese usually gives $150,000 to Catholic Charities USA to
buy food and help more than 75,000 people with medical, utility and
rent bills from Bakersfield to Merced.</LD>
<LD>   Catholic Charities also helps support immigration, refugees,
senior citizens, health and youth services programs, including Big
Brothers and Big Sisters, and a halfway house in Bakersfield.</LD>
<TE>   Bishop John T. Steinbock said funds also have been cut for
cathedral restoration, KNXT-TV, and capital improvements in poorer
parishes.</TE>
<TE>   Catholic Charities is seeking alternative funding, said Mary Kay

<HD>Impulse to Shoplift Treatable, Experts Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Benedict Carey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actress Winona Ryder has not said what prompted her to take more than
$5,500 in clothes and accessories from Saks Fifth Avenue last year.
But psychiatrists say people who shoplift to serve a compulsive urge
may suffer from a treatable mental disorder.</LD>
<LD>   For people who repeatedly take things they don't need, a condition
known as kleptomania, the inner struggle can be extremely difficult
to overcome: the breathless thrill of walking past the cashier with
stolen goods against the stinging shame of having broken the law.</LD>
<LD>   "Kleptomaniacs are people who usually see themselves as having a
serious moral failing," said Dr. Jon Grant, who runs the Impulse
Control Disorder program at the University of Minnesota Medical
School in Minneapolis. "The key is to get them to see the problem as
an illness, as a problem in the brain."</LD>
<TE>   Like compulsive gambling, experts say, kleptomania is an impulse
problem rooted in chemical cravings as real as any for alcohol or
tobacco -- and the habit is as hard to break as drug addiction.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers in the past year, however, have discovered several
promising treatments.</TE>
<TE>   In one study, Stanford University researchers studied compulsive
shoppers, whose impulse control problems are similar to those of
kleptomaniacs. Using a Prozac-like antidepressant, citalopram, the
researchers reduced urges significantly in 17 of 22 of the patients.</TE>
<TE>   In another study, Grant reported that naltrexone, a medication
used to treat alcoholism, reduced the urge to steal, as well as the
thrill that comes with stealing, in 13 kleptomaniacs. In an ongoing
follow-up involving 30 compulsive shoplifters, Grant said, the drug
has reduced cravings 60% to 70% of the time, "sometimes down to
zero."</TE>
<TE>   Medication by itself rarely turns people's lives around,
psychiatrists say. Most compulsive shoplifters also need to identify
and avoid the situations that get them into trouble, such as fancy
display cases, jewelry counters or shopping after a stressful
workday. Instead, experts say, they must learn to distract themselves
when they feel the urge. Weekly therapy sessions can help; so can
supportive friends and family members.</TE>
<TE>   "With some of my patients, I have to tell them they simply cannot
go into a store again, unless they have someone with them," said Dr.
Donald Black, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Iowa who
studies impulse control problems. "If you've got someone with you who
knows about the problem, you're much less likely to take anything."</TE>
<TE>   Will Cupchik, a Toronto psychologist who has studied and treated
what he calls "atypical theft offenders" for 30 years, said most
kleptomaniacs begin to break the law in response to some personal
crisis: divorce, the death of a loved one or job loss. Sometimes
discovering the underlying crisis helps to resolve the problem, he
has found.</TE>

<HD>UC to Review New Admissions Policy</HD>
<DH>The system's most selective campuses will examine how
hard-luck stories affect choices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Silverstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A University of California faculty committee on Wednesday defended
the system against criticism that its most selective campuses rely
too heavily on stories of students' personal hardships in making
admissions decisions.</LD>
<LD>   But the panel's report also urged UCLA, UC Irvine and UC Berkeley
to review the role that hardship stories play in their admissions
decisions, and to inform the public of their conclusions.</LD>
<LD>   The faculty committee, known as the Board of Admissions and
Relations with Schools, said it will look into requiring letters of
recommendation for applicants, at least in part to verify the
personal statements and other information submitted by students. In
addition, the panel has assigned a subcommittee to evaluate the UC
application with an eye toward, among other things, "reducing the
possibility that [students] will submit personal statements
substantially written by third parties."</LD>
<TE>   Still, Barbara A. Sawrey, chairwoman of the group and a chemistry
professor at UC San Diego, said reviews so far have shown that "the
vast majority of students are trustworthy with the information they
give us."</TE>
<TE>   The 35-page report was intended to assess an admissions policy
known as comprehensive review, which was launched for this fall's
freshman class at the six most selective UC campuses. Comprehensive
review reflects an expansion of UC's emphasis on personal
achievement, rather than simply grade-point averages and SAT scores,
in considering applicants.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of personal achievement taken into account by admissions
officials includes leadership, special talents and personal stories
of triumph over adversity. The panel, Sawrey said, has found that
"this is largely a successful venture ... and we think we see ways
that we can even make it better."</TE>
<TE>   But the plan has drawn criticism from parents and college
counselors who say that too many students with outstanding high
school records and SATs are unfairly being turned away by such
campuses as UCLA and UC Berkeley. Instead, the critics say, less
qualified students are being admitted who submit fabricated or
exaggerated written statements saying they have overcome severe
hardships.</TE>
<TE>   The report is due to be discussed at the UC Board of Regents
meeting next week.</TE>

<HD>Baker Decides It's Time for a Non-Giant Step</HD>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Dusty Baker, you just managed your team in the World Series, where
are you going to go now?</LD>
<LD>   Chicago, maybe. Possibly ESPN.</LD>
<LD>   Just don't say Pacific Bell Park. The San Francisco Giants called
a hastily arranged news conference late Wednesday afternoon and
announced that Baker isn't coming back for his 11th year as manager.</LD>
<TE>   Less than two weeks after guiding the Giants into the World
Series, where they lost to the Angels in seven games, the three-time
National League manager of the year is looking for a job. Baker, 53,
whose contract expired Wednesday, had been dropping some
not-so-subtle hints that managing the Giants another day wasn't in
his plans.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's why Giant General Manager Brian Sabean didn't sound
surprised when he announced the Baker Era with the Giants had come to
an end.</TE>
<TE>   Sabean and Jeff Moorad, Baker's agent, talked Tuesday night and
Wednesday morning. Sabean came away convinced there could be no deal.</TE>
<TE>   "It has become increasingly apparent that Dusty's interest in
exploring opportunities elsewhere is paramount in his mind," Sabean
said. "There remained noncompensation issues that he seemed reluctant
to embrace."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, it wasn't about the money, although Baker's
two-year deal with the Giants was worth an estimated $2.5 million
annually. Yet almost from the moment he signed his last contract in
2000, there have been reports that Baker was at odds with the Giants'
managing general partner, Peter Magowan. He had told friends that he
was indeed upset with Magowan as well as chief executive officer
Larry Baer, largely over a perceived lack of respect.</TE>
<TE>   He also told insiders before the playoffs began that he did not
intend to return to the Giants. Baker was also intrigued by the
possibility of working as a network analyst for ESPN's baseball
telecasts and made discreet inquiries.</TE>
<TE>   The relationship between Baker had been tenuous for some time.
Sources said that on the flight to San Francisco after the Giants had
been eliminated by the New York Mets in the first round of last
year's playoff, Baker was disturbed that Magowan made no effort to
compliment him or the team on an otherwise successful season.</TE>
<TE>   Baker also felt that Magowan put "undue pressure" on him and the
team this year by saying in the spring, at a time when Baker was
recovering from prostate cancer surgery, that this was a World
Series-caliber team, a team with no holes.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, while Baker had acknowledged that there was an
agreement with Magowan in the spring that his and Sabean's contracts
wouldn't be negotiated until the Giants were done playing, sources
said that he felt his 10 years with the club and three
manager-of-the-year awards deserved an earlier offer than the one
finally discussed Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Amid a Bay Area perception that Magowan was envious of the credit
Baker received for the Giants' success, Baker, in turn, admitted in
recent interviews that he had grown weary of being blamed on Bay Area
talk shows when the team came up short, as it did in the World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he ended up at the end of the day taking things
personally," said Sabean, who added, "We felt slighted that for
whatever reason Dusty was more comfortable talking up other
situations. I couldn't understand that. We were never sent the
message that we were still the right organization for him.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't differentiate if they wanted an offer to use as a
springboard elsewhere or as a fallback in case elsewhere didn't work
out."</TE>
<TE>   So where will Baker wind up? The Cubs have not interviewed anyone
to replace the fired Bruce Kimm, and they do not seem to be flinching
at a potential Baker salary of $5 million a year for at least three
years.</TE>
<TE>   The Seattle Mariners have interviewed nearly two dozen candidates
to replace Lou Piniella, but Wednesday night they said they are not
interested in Baker.</TE>
<TE>   Moorad said it was possible that Baker would take time off rather
than return to the dugout next season, but "his preferred option is
to continue managing."</TE>
<TE>   As for who's replacing Baker, Sabean said he would soon have a
short list of candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Chances are, whoever takes over for Baker will have a hard act to
follow. Baker's record was 840-715, and he was named manager of the
year in 1993, 1997 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants' World Series appearance against the Angels was their
first since 1989 and only their second since 1962.</TE>
<TE>   Baker is the first manager to leave a World Series team since
1973, when Dick Williams managed the Oakland A's to the championship
then retired. The Angels hired Williams in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Fregosi, a former assistant general manager under Sabean, is a
candidate to replace Baker.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Roenicke, who was the Giants' triple-A manager before joining
the Angels' coaching staff three years ago, said he's interested in
the San Francisco job.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obviously a great team," Roenicke said.</TE>
<TE>   Roenicke, the Angels' third-base coach, interviewed for a major
league managerial job for the first time Tuesday, with the Mariners,
though he was not included among their four finalists. General
Manager Pat Gillick said he had a "mystery candidate" to replace
Piniella.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, it's not Baker.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Angel pitching coach Bud Black, who withdrew from
consideration for the Cleveland Indian manager's job, also is
believed to be interested in replacing Baker. Black played for the
Giants from 1991 to '94.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Ross Newhan and Bill Shaikin, the Chicago
Tribune and Associated Press contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>Angel General Manager Bill Stoneman said Wednesday he has offered
contract extensions to the entire coaching staff -- Ron Roenicke
(third base), Bud Black (pitching) Joe Maddon (bench), Alfredo
Griffin (first base), Mickey Hatcher (hitting) and Bobby Ramos
(bullpen).</LD>
<LD>   Stoneman also said that outfielder Tim Salmon had arthroscopic
surgery to remove damaged cartilage in his left knee but is expected
to be ready for spring training. So is third baseman Troy Glaus, who
Stoneman said would soon undergo surgery to cut an enlarged nerve in
his right foot.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels also released reserve outfielder Julio Ramirez, who hit
batted .281 in 29 games.</LD>

<TE>   The Seattle Mariners decided to decline their one-year option on
designated hitter Edgar Martinez, leaving the immediate future
unclear for one of the team's most popular players.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners had a $10-million option and had to decide by
midnight whether to use it. General Manager Pat Gillick said he's not
certain what course Martinez will choose next.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Red Sox have hired renowned baseball author and
statistical maven Bill James as an advisor to baseball operations,
the Hartford Courant reported.... New York Yankee reliever Steve
Karsay will have surgery today for a herniated disk in his lower
back.... The Atlanta Braves hired Otis Nixon as coordinator of
baserunning and bunting. Nixon is 17th in career stolen bases with
620.... Former Phillies manager Terry Francona was hired as bench
coach by the Oakland Athletics.</TE>

<HD>The Eighth Dirty Word in the NBA? Rebuilding</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave D'Allessandro in the Newark (N.J.) Star-Ledger: "The dirtiest
word in the NBA has 10 letters, and most general managers are unable
to say it publicly without fear of embarrassment or ridicule....</LD>
<LD>   "Pat Riley knows the word, and has the courage to use it. But just
once. Then don't bring it up again....</LD>
<LD>   " 'Rebuilding,' says the staunch Miami advocate, spitting it out
as if he were saying 'Phil Jackson' or something. 'I hate the word
rebuilding because I have to fight off those thought processes of it
from other people.' "</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NFL record for points in a season?</TE>
<TE>   Dream on: Dave Boling in the Tacoma News Tribune: "Critics might
want to scold Washington State football fans for violation of
protocol with their display of roses in the stands at a game in early
November.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't happen to think that they're premature as much as
short-sighted. They're not aiming high enough. They should be waving
corn chips.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not start out passing out bags of corn chips and dishes of
salsa to emphasize the team's chances of playing in the Tostitos
Fiesta Bowl ... the national championship game."</TE>
<TE>   Unusual reaction: Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times: "Joe
Paterno, please note: Tyrone Willingham was never classier than when
he refused to say an unkind word about the referee who blew that
apparent touchdown catch in the end zone Saturday [against Boston
College].</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure I've ever heard a coach say he was sure the refs
were doing the best they could."</TE>
<TE>   Long way to go: The Cincinnati Bengals became the last NFL team to
win a game this season -- against the expansion Houston Texans.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to build off this and not get too relaxed," receiver Chad
Johnson told Associated Press. "Everybody needs to stay humble."</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Jon Kitna said that won't be a problem. "Why would you
be overly joyful?" he said. "We're 1-7."</TE>
<TE>   New occupation: After the Arizona Cardinals' 27-14 loss to St.
Louis, Pedro Gomez of the Arizona Republic said, "It's time to turn
[quarterback] Jake Plummer into Liquid Plumber and follow directions
on the bottle."</TE>
<TE>   High praise: Jeff Gordon of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch,
commenting on running back Marshall Faulk: "He is the best football
player St. Louis has ever had and may well be the best football
player in the game today."</TE>
<TE>   Spin-off: From comedy writer Earl Hochman: "With women's wrestling
scheduled to make its Olympic debut in Athens in 2004, already more
than 300 candidates have expressed interest in trying out -- 295 from
'The Jerry Springer Show.' "</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Paul Hornung of the Green Bay Packers scored 176
points in 1960 on 15 touchdowns, 15 field goals and 41 conversion
kicks.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: "This is what's called an off-year election because
there's no presidential elections," says Jay Leno. "It's kind of like
the Winter Olympics. We pretend to care."</TE>

<HD>Clippers Take Best Shot, Lose</HD>
<DH>Brand misses from five feet in closing seconds, allowing
76ers to escape with a 101-99 overtime win. Iverson scores 34.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>When Allen Iverson swished jump shots from improbable angles or
seemed to be suspended in midair while passing to open teammates, the
Clippers simply set their jaws and went back to work.</LD>
<LD>   When calls didn't go their way, the Clippers took a deep breath
and kept playing Wednesday against Iverson and the Philadelphia
76ers.</LD>
<LD>   When the game went to overtime and the 76ers took a three-point
lead on Iverson's 20-foot jump shot, the Clippers seemed poised to
take it back in the final seconds. They got the basketball into the
right man's hands, but he missed and the 76ers staved off the
Clippers, 101-99, only after Elton Brand missed a five-foot jumper
with six seconds remaining in overtime before a lively crowd of
16,651 at the First Union Center.</LD>
<TE>   "That's my shot," Brand said. "Tough, tough, tough. I was hoping
the ball would hit the front of the rim and bounce in like it usually
does. I made that shot probably three times tonight."</TE>
<TE>   It was difficult to pin the Clippers' third loss in four games to
start the season on Brand. Iverson certainly had a sizable role,
scoring 34 points on 11-for-28 shooting in 48 minutes. Brand was the
Clippers' best player, although not their only one who excelled in
the first game of a four-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   Brand scored 21 points on seven-for-12 shooting and took a
season-high 19 rebounds in 47 minutes. Michael Olowokandi had 14
points and 13 rebounds in 47 minutes. Andre Miller had 13 points and
13 assists in 45 minutes. Eric Piatkowski and Corey Maggette scored
18 points apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Maggette, playing with damaged cartilage in his right knee, helped
the Clippers build a 74-62 lead with 2:24 remaining in the third
quarter by scoring 17 points in the period. To that point, it was the
Clippers' best basketball of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "We should have been able to finish them off," Brand said. "Give
credit to Philadelphia. They played hard. They didn't want to lose
either. They gained momentum in the fourth quarter. Allen really
stepped up his play."</TE>
<TE>   The 76ers' 12-2 run to end the third quarter put an end to any
thoughts the Clippers had of turning the game into a runaway.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson wouldn't let it happen. He almost made the 76ers winners
in the final seconds of regulation, but couldn't bank home an
off-balance jumper from the right wing with Miller hounding him.</TE>
<TE>   Miller was a little too close, according to Iverson.</TE>
<TE>   "I was fouled," said Iverson, who injured his right hand on the
play, "but that one you just have to let go."</TE>
<TE>   Iverson didn't miss on a 20-footer from the left wing with Keyon
Dooling pestering him with 45.2 seconds left in overtime, however,
giving Philadelphia a 100-97 lead. In overtime, Clipper Coach Alvin
Gentry had Dooling instead of Miller guarding Iverson. Miller picked
up his fifth foul with 6.6 seconds left in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Miller cut the Clippers' deficit to 100-99 with two free throws
with 34.6 to play. After a steal and a timeout with 17.1 left, the
Clippers got the ball into Brand's hands.</TE>
<TE>   Brand swept past earthbound 76er forward Mark Bryant, moving into
the paint and launching what looked like a game-winner.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the ball bounced off the rim, into Iverson's hands.
Miller grabbed Iverson with 0.4 remaining and he made one of two free
throws to account for the final score.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking at the clock," Brand would later say when asked about
his pivotal miss. "I see six seconds left and I'm thinking, 'Put it
in.' All I needed was a little more touch on it. I got a tough bounce
off the rim. It's more than one shot, though. We didn't execute the
way we could have the entire game."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers trailed, 47-43, by halftime, a noteworthy start
because Maggette and Quentin Richardson each played with knee
injuries.</TE>

<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>The Clippers limped into town to begin a four-game trip against the
76ers as banged up as ever.</LD>
<LD>   Quentin Richardson suffered a hyperextended right knee in Sunday's
victory over the Detroit Pistons. An MRI exam showed no damaged
cartilage and he played 22 minutes Wednesday against Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   Corey Maggette's right knee swelled after Sunday's game and after
Monday's practice. An MRI exam showed torn cartilage, but he played
39 minutes against the 76ers. Arthroscopic surgery remains a
possibility, but Maggette is determined to play with the pain.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Alvin Gentry has stopped worrying about what might next
happen to his walking wounded. He will closely monitor how much he
plays Richardson and Maggette and limit their practice time in order
to keep them as sound as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "We're struggling with our health, but that's nothing new," Gentry
said before the Clippers' overtime loss to the 76ers.</TE>
<TE>   Lamar Odom re-injured his sprained right ankle and had it placed
in a cast Aug. 26. Elton Brand underwent arthroscopic surgery to
remove damaged cartilage Sept. 26. Michael Olowokandi suffered from
tendinitis in his left knee and a strained left hip flexor.
Richardson sprained his right knee while performing a conditioning
drill on the fourth day of training camp.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry planned to have all four in the starting lineup, with
Maggette as a key reserve when the regular season began last week.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll play him if he can play," Gentry said of Maggette. "If he
can't play, I'll play somebody else. He can't be silly about this. If
he's physically able to play, he'll play. Corey's got to be smart
about it, but if he's able to play, we need him out there."</TE>
<TE>   Of Richardson, Gentry said, "It's hard to tell right now. I'll
know more after we stick him out there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eric Piatkowski played his 558th game as a Clipper, tying him for
second with Loy Vaught on the franchise's all-time list.</TE>

<LD>   "If Tony [Pedregon] wins, I win. If I win, I win. So what could be
better?"</LD>
<LD>   The way Pedregon looks at it, he wants to win to make a statement
for his family and for second-generation drivers.</LD>
<TE>   "If I could win, it would be huge for the Pedregon family, being
the first time John has been beaten since [brother] Cruz did it 10
years ago. It would be huge for the whole family, growing up the way
we did in Southern California watching our dad drive."</TE>
<TE>   The catch: Force is Pedregon's boss. Also his mentor and biggest
rooter.</TE>
<TE>   Both say they will be going all out, with no team orders except to
try to win, when the 38th annual Auto Club NHRA Finals get underway
today at Pomona Raceway.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys in the shop gave me a great hot rod and they gave Tony a
great hot rod, so we'll shoot it out and see what happens," Force
said. "No matter what, a Castrol Mustang will be the champion."</TE>
<TE>   The funny car championship race, involving only Force and
Pedregon, is the only National Hot Rod Assn. professional title yet
to be decided. Larry Dixon in top fuel, Jeg Coughlin in pro stock and
Angelle Savoie in pro stock bike, all clinched their titles last
month in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Force has won nine consecutive funny car crowns since Cruz
Pedregon upset him in 1992. Going into the season's final event,
Force, 53, has a 31-point lead over his 37-year-old protege -- the
equivalent of two rounds of racing. If Force can reach the semifinals
Sunday, Pedregon cannot catch him even if he wins the event.</TE>
<TE>   "I need some help, no doubt about it," Pedregon said, "but as
tight as the fields have been this year, you've got to fight for
every round. John's been upset in the early rounds before. I just
have to mind my own business and make sure I don't stumble."</TE>
<TE>   The first professional qualifying session will start at 1:45 p.m.
today with one Friday and two Saturday to set the 16-car field for
final eliminations.</TE>
<TE>   Pedregon had been the hottest driver in funny cars -- short wheel
base cars with a fiberglass replica of a production car, capable of
325 mph in less than five seconds from a standing start -- until he
met the boss in Las Vegas. In the last five events, Pedregon has won
three finals and qualified No. 1 four times.</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas produced a dramatic final-round match of the teammates
that Force won with a 4.82-second run at 305.22 mph to 4.86 and
301.94.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz, the older brother, also is a funny car entrant, but has been
giving Tony some advice.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me to check the ladder after Saturday's final qualifying
round and see who was between me and the finals, and who was between
John and the finals, and start figuring out how to get there," Tony
said.</TE>
<TE>   "An ideal situation for me would be to be in the same half of the
draw with John and catch him in an early round. That way I could
control my own destiny."</TE>
<TE>   The Castrol teammates have met four times this season, Force
winning three.</TE>
<TE>   "I love Tony and I'd love to see him be champion, but when I get
out there on the line the competitor in me comes out and I'll do
whatever it takes to beat him," Force said. "It's great that we get
to settle it in Pomona on our home track. Both of us came up the same
way, scrapping for parts and money trying to make a name for
ourselves in this area before we hit on the right combination.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I went 15 years out here before I won anything. Tony
hasn't been around that long, but he knows what it's like when you
wonder if you'll ever win. It's a great feeling, for me, that no
matter what happens I'll be a winner."</TE>

<LD>Miami last suffered a football loss in September 2000, is defending
national champion and ranks No. 1 this week in pass defense.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Coker has yet to lose a game as head coach -- the guy has
had almost two years to polish his first, post-loss locker room
speech -- while Hurricane quarterback Ken Dorsey is a leading
contender for the Heisman Trophy.</LD>
<LD>   In other words, someone call 911.</LD>
<TE>   Forget that Miami's 30-game winning streak leaves the program only
17 short of Oklahoma's major college record of 47, an astounding
achievement in the era of scholarship limits.</TE>
<TE>   The sense is that Miami is on the ropes, one sucker punch from
losing its title belt, Larry Holmes on last legs.</TE>
<TE>   Miami plays at Tennessee on Saturday in what amounts to another
program-defining moment. The Hurricanes already have fallen in the
polls and somewhat out of favor. Last week's 25-point road victory at
Rutgers didn't impress Associated Press voters, who dropped the
Hurricanes to No. 2 in their poll, setting off a chain reaction that
left the Hurricanes at No. 3 in the bowl championship series rankings
and, at least temporarily, out of the national title game.</TE>
<TE>   In most sports, the champion is the champion until taken down, but
that's not the way it works under college football's Dewey Decimal
Points System.</TE>
<TE>   Miami's panic impulses have been felt and recorded by an array of
gadgetry; it's almost as if the Hurricanes have been hooked up to a
BCS lie-detector test -- and failed.</TE>
<TE>   Truth is, there is something wrong with the Hurricanes. They've
had to come from behind to win their last three games, and while you
used to think Miami tended to turn its talent off and on like a
faucet, no title contender in its right mind spots Rutgers a 17-14
fourth-quarter lead without paying a political price.</TE>
<TE>   Coker says his team is starting to remind him of the 1998 UCLA
Bruins, meaning Coker must be into his 15th bottle of Pepto-Bismol.</TE>
<TE>   "If they beat us they play for the national championship," Coker
said of the team's Dec. 5 matchup that year.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd won several games all year long by outscoring their
opponent."</TE>
<TE>   (Note: Coker knows his history: UCLA kept its unbeaten season
alive with harrowing victories against Oregon, Stanford and Oregon
State.)</TE>
<TE>   UCLA was 10-0 entering the Miami game.</TE>
<TE>   "That day," Coker continued, "we outscored them, 49-45, and cost
them an opportunity to play for the national title.</TE>
<TE>   "You just can't continually live on the edge."</TE>
<TE>   Miami, like UCLA in '98, has been playing with 10 toes over the
ledge:</TE>
<TE>   * Oct. 12: The Hurricanes needed two fourth-quarter touchdowns to
take the lead on Florida State, 28-27, then held on as Seminole
kicker Xavier Beitia missed a 43-yard field-goal attempt as time
expired.</TE>
<TE>   * Oct. 26. Miami and West Virginia were tied at 17-17 in the third
quarter before the Hurricanes prevailed, 40-23. Miami rushed for a
season-low 102 yards and gave up a season-high 363.</TE>
<TE>   * Nov. 2. Miami trailed Rutgers, No. 145 in this week's Sagarin
ratings, before a fourth-quarter blitz produced a 42-17 victory that
raised eyebrows, not confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at the score and it's a 25-point win on the road," Coker
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is fine, but it's not fine. We have things we have to
get corrected. The thing we can't do is accept just a win."</TE>
<TE>   Miami had 13 penalties in the game, nine on special teams. The
Hurricanes lead the Big East in mistakes, averaging 87 penalty yards
a game.</TE>
<TE>   While the defensive secondary has been superb, Miami ranks only
77th nationally in rush defense -- Miami of Ohio is No. 50 -- and has
committed as many turnovers, 17, as it has forced.</TE>
<TE>   With remaining games against Tennessee, Pittsburgh and Virginia
Tech, Coker knows his team can't keep living like this.</TE>
<TE>   Said Coker: "Hopefully we're intelligent players and coaches, we
see that and understand it."</TE>
<TE>   Big Ten Mess</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know" was the wrong answer.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State Coach Bobby Williams spoke those words Saturday
when asked if he had lost control of his team and Athletic Director
Ron Mason used the comments as grounds for firing Williams on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Mason correctly read "I don't know" as meaning "yes I have" and
mercifully put to an end a situation that was getting uglier by the
minute.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State opened the season at No. 18 in the preseason polls
and climbed as high as No. 15 after a 2-0 start, but it has been an
Irwin Allen movie ever since, one disaster heaped on another.</TE>
<TE>   The Williams era came to a crashing conclusion after last
weekend's 49-3 loss to Michigan, which dropped Michigan State's
record to 3-6. It was learned afterward that starting quarterback
Jeff Smoker, benched for an undisclosed reason, had checked into a
rehab center for a substance abuse problem.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, Mason received a phone call with news that Dawan
Moss, the team's starting tailback, had been arrested after an
alleged drunken altercation with police.</TE>
<TE>   Smoker and Moss were team captains.</TE>
<TE>   With sordid innuendo sweeping Internet chat rooms, Mason had no
recourse but to fire the coach.</TE>
<TE>   Would Williams have survived had the Spartans had a better record?</TE>
<TE>   The short answer: you bet.</TE>
<TE>   When things are going great guns -- on the field, not in the
dormitory -- nothing short of manslaughter stops a parade toward a
major bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State offensive coordinator Morris Watts, the 64-year-old
lifetime assistant who will take over for Williams on an interim
basis, said problems tend to evaporate when you win.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't go as far to say that they're swept under the table or
anything like that," Watts said. "But sometimes the fact that things
are going great is more important than that little side note that
just happened."</TE>
<TE>   Williams couldn't survive the double-whammy of poor play and
internal combustion.</TE>
<TE>   The Michigan State mess is only the latest in a series of Big Ten
missteps. Here's the quick roundup: A Michigan player was shot in the
off-season, the officiating has been odorous to the point Penn State
Coach Joe Paterno insinuated bias because one referee lived in Ann
Arbor, Mich. More recently, Purdue quarterback Brandon Kirsch broke
his hand throwing a punch at a fraternity party.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, Wisconsin tailback Anthony Davis suffered a stab
wound to the thigh in a domestic dispute and you could start a
reality television show chronicling a season with the Michigan State
Spartans.</TE>
<TE>   A Numbers Game</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Williams, of course, wasn't just a coach, he was one of only
four African American coaches in Division I-A football. Floyd Keith,
executive director of the Black Coaches Assn., has devoted much time
and energy into increasing the number of minority coaches in the
game, so Williams' firing was a blow.</TE>
<TE>   Given the situation, however, the BCA couldn't cry foul.</TE>
<TE>   "I would much rather have Bobby in place," Keith said in a phone
interview this week. "But no one is naive here. We all understand
that coaching itself has its own hazards, irrespective of a lot of
circumstances. There are a lot of things that occur that you can't
control.</TE>
<TE>   "You weigh it and you measure it. If something would have been
expressed to me that this was not a fair decision, or completely
abstract, then maybe our association would have some comments. I've
talked with Bobby, talked with Michigan State. It's unfortunate. I
know this was not easy for either party."</TE>
<TE>   Keith's only hope is that Michigan State will consider another
minority as Williams' replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Watts, the interim coach, is white but not seeking the full-time
position.</TE>
<TE>   With Williams ousted, the remaining major college black coaches
are Fitz Hill of San Jose State, New Mexico State's Tony Samuel and
Tyrone Willingham of Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Hurry-Up Offense</TE>
<TE>   Remember the outrage last year when Nebraska advanced to the
national title game without winning its division in the Big 12
Conference?</TE>
<TE>   It could happen again. Texas is No. 4 in this week's BCS rankings
and may need only two of the three schools ahead of it to lose to
make it to the Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The Longhorns can by finishing 11-1 and advance to Tempe despite
finishing second in the Big 12's South Division to Oklahoma, which
beat Texas on Oct. 12. There was talk in the off-season about
amending BCS language to require that title-game participants had won
their conference titles, but the major conference commissioners
decided against it.</TE>
<TE>   Texas is glad they did. Pacific 10 Conference Commissioner Tom
Hansen said this week it was unfair to exclude a school from BCS
consideration just because it didn't win its conference title. The
problem is two conferences, the Big 12 and Southeastern, have
championship games.</TE>
<TE>   "For what we're doing here with the BCS, you need to look at the
11- and 12-game schedule, not just the conference schedule," Hansen
said. "To decide who is No. 1 and No. 2, which is all we're doing,
let's let everyone stand on their record."</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma has a commanding 3.53-point lead over Ohio State in this
week's BCS rankings so it's conceivable the Sooners could lose the
Big 12 title game and still finish No. 2 and play for the national
title. Wouldn't that be a hoot?</TE>
<TE>   We'll find out Saturday if it's really 1993 all over again. That
year, Notre Dame's national title hopes were dashed with a loss to
Boston College a week after the Irish upset Florida State.</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend, Notre Dame lost to Boston College a week after it
beat Florida State. In 1993, after beating Notre Dame, Boston College
followed with a loss to West Virginia. Boston College plays at West
Virginia on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Nutty note of the week: Miami plays at Tennessee in a game with
national implications. Rutgers (1-8) led both schools at the half
before losing.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Earns Right to Defend Title</HD>

<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>It's time to break out the geographic dictionaries and to start
learning some new names. An atlas wouldn't be a bad idea, either.</LD>
<LD>   Places like Chengdu and Wuhan have suddenly taken on new meaning.
Knowing the difference between Hangkou and Hangzhou is suddenly
important.</LD>
<LD>   And then, of course, there is Shanghai.</LD>
<TE>   All five cities are in China, naturally, and that's where the
United States women's national team is heading after qualifying for
the fourth FIFA Women's World Cup with a 7-0 victory over Costa Rica
Wednesday night in the semifinals of the CONCACAF Gold Cup.</TE>
<TE>   It was Cindy Parlow who clinched the U.S. its place in the finals
with a deserving hat trick that gave the world champions the chance
to defend the title they won in 1999 at the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Costa Rica, ably marshaled by defender and captain Gabriela
Trujillo, put up a brave resistance, holding the game scoreless for
almost 30 minutes before the Americans broke through. The second
half, however, was a one-way street -- straight to Shanghai, where
the World Cup opens on Sept. 24.</TE>
<TE>   Joining the U.S. in the 16-nation tournament will be Canada, which
made hard work of defeating Mexico, 2-0, in Wednesday night's other
semifinal in front of what was left of the crowd of 10,079.</TE>
<TE>   Two own goals destroyed Mexico's hopes. Dioselina Valderrama
deflected a free kick by Canada's Sharlota Nonen into her own net in
the 10th minute and Elizabeth Gomez beat her own goalkeeper in the
70th while trying to clear the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico can still reach the World Cup if it defeats Costa Rica in
the third-place game Saturday afternoon at the Rose Bowl and then
wins a home-and-home playoff with the third-place team in Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Five of the American players are more than familiar with China.
Joy Fawcett, Julie Foudy, Mia Hamm, Kristine Lilly and Brandi
Chastain were all there in 1991, helping the U.S. win the first
women's world championship.</TE>
<TE>   So, too, for that matter, was U.S. Coach April Heinrichs, a
world-class player in those days.</TE>
<TE>   "The best part of today was really our players' response to
winning," Heinrichs said. "They were just absolutely, genuinely
elated that we've earned the right to go back to the World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   With Heinrichs electing to rest Tiffeny Milbrett, who had scored
five first-half goals Saturday in a rout of Panama, it was left to
the lanky Parlow to spearhead the U.S. offense.</TE>
<TE>   It took a while for things to click, but once Parlow had found the
back of the net the first time, redirecting a hard cross from Foudy
past lively Costa Rica goalkeeper Marie Claire Herra in the 30th
minute, there was no stopping her.</TE>
<TE>   "I was joking with her [Milbrett] about it," Parlow said afterward
of her hat trick. "I told her it took me three games to get five
goals [in the tournament] and it only took her about 25 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. led, 1-0, at the half, but two goals in the space of
three minutes early in the second half proved to be Costa Rica's
undoing.</TE>
<TE>   The first came in the 49th minute, when Cat Reddick, playing an
excellent game at right back, came down the wing and crossed the ball
deep to the back post. Parlow, climbing above a defender, sent a
sharp, twisting downward header just inside the left post beyond
Herra's reach.</TE>
<TE>   Three minutes later she scored in exactly the same place, this
time shouldering her way through two defenders, knocking one of them
to the ground, to score her third goal. It was the fifth hat trick of
her international career.</TE>
<TE>   After that, Costa Rica's defense wilted.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Hucles scored her first goal for the national team in the
65th minute, stabbing in a pass from Parlow that was flicked on by a
Shannon MacMillan header.</TE>
<TE>   That made it 4-0, and in the 71st minute, Hamm, the world's
all-time leading goal scorer, replaced Parlow, further deflating
Costa Rican spirits.</TE>
<TE>   But it was an own goal by Costa Rica's Cinthia Lopez, a MacMillan
goal off a rocket-like shot, and Lilly's 90th international goal in
the 90th minute, that finished the scoring.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. thus became the fifth country to qualify for the World
Cup, joining Germany, Norway, Russia and Sweden. China qualifies
automatically as host.</TE>
<TE>   "This was our goal, to qualify tonight," said Hamm.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure April will get us there about four times before the
World Cup," said Foudy. "I think she has a thing about China."</TE>

<HD>Bettors Are Leery of Pick Six Payoffs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Hollywood Park elevator door opened at the third floor Wednesday
and trainer Mel Stute started to get on.</LD>
<LD>   "Wait a second," said Stute, one ear crooked as he got halfway
through the door. "I gotta hear this payoff. It's gonna be a good
one."</LD>
<LD>   Stute heard Vic Stauffer, the track announcer, say that the
third-race trifecta had paid $1,354.80. Fully inside the elevator
now, Stute flaunted the winning ticket. "This could be the start of a
very nice day," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Stute, 75, has been training horses for 55 years and betting on
them even longer. An eon ago, he and three partners cashed a $240,000
pick six ticket at Agua Caliente in Tijuana. This was so far back
that the bet was called the 5-10 (the fifth through the 10th races),
and the U.S. tracks hadn't even introduced the pick six yet.</TE>
<TE>   "At Caliente," Stute said, "you wrote out your own betting slip.
It wasn't always on the up-and-up. They found guys cheating on the
pick six even then."</TE>
<TE>   What Stute was implying, before saddling a horse on opening day at
Hollywood Park, was that the alleged rigging of the Breeders' Cup
pick six at Arlington Park last month was not breaking any new
ground. There are the cynical horseplayers, some of whom could be
found at Hollywood Park on Wednesday, who feel that pick six
shenanigans may have been going on in the U.S. since the bet
originated at Hollywood in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   "You think and hope that what happened on Breeders' Cup day was a
one-time thing," said Gary Young, a professional clocker who also
bets horses for a living. "But you can't help but think that these
guys have pulled this before. I was born in the morning, but I wasn't
born yesterday morning. It's mind-boggling, that all of the pick six
bets aren't fed into the [host track's] system until after the first
four races have been run. Then there's a guy, sitting in the computer
room that processes the bets in Delaware, who has the password that
gets him into the system. That's like giving the fox the keys to the
henhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "If guys like this haven't already done this in California, they
were surely on their way here. California, after all, is the capital
of the pick six."</TE>
<TE>   As the last race in Wednesday's pick six approached, it seemed a
cinch that there wouldn't be a winning ticket, which would trigger a
carry-over of part of the pool for today's players. The opening race
in the pick six -- Stute's boxcar trifecta race -- was won by a 41-1
longshot, and the next-to-last race, the Bien Bien Stakes, went to
Music's Storm at 24-1. But after the recent Breeders' Cup experience,
bettors are gunshy.</TE>
<TE>   "Just watch," somebody in the grandstand said sardonically after
the fifth race in the pick six. "There'll be one winning ticket.
Bought by some guy back East at an off-track betting place that
nobody's ever heard of."</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, no ticket was sold with all six winners, and one
ticket with five winners was worth $35,522.80. The carry-over for
today's card is almost $83,000.</TE>
<TE>   It's that carry-over that might induce trainer Darrell Vienna to
invest in the pick six.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the only time I play," Vienna said. "One of my clients
will call when there's a carry-over and suggest that we get together
and put in a ticket."</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, Vienna was part of a pick six payoff that totaled
about $270,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We did it with a ticket that cost only $64," Vienna said. "One of
our winners was an $80 horse."</TE>
<TE>   At the Breeders' Cup, there were pick six horses that paid $54,
$28.40 and $89, but the six winning tickets, all put in by one bettor
and worth more than $3 million counting consolation, five-out-of-six
combinations, were guaranteed winners after only four races had been
run. The tickets were altered at that juncture, and then the revised
ticket included all of the horses in the final two races.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys wouldn't have been caught if they hadn't punched in
tickets that were so obvious," said a Hollywood Park bettor who only
wanted to be known as Bob. "They could have expanded their ticket and
no one would have noticed. But they wanted the whole [betting] pool.
It was your classic example of racetrack greed."</TE>
<TE>   Like Gary Young, Vienna thinks the three suspects had probably
struck before.</TE>
<TE>   "I have the feeling that these guys had done this so many times
before that they figured they didn't have to be careful," Vienna
said.</TE>

<HD>Firm to Assess Computer Betting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Wharton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The horse racing industry has enlisted a major accounting firm and
its team of high-tech security experts to help deal with the kind of
computer betting scam that allegedly occurred during Breeders' Cup
races last month.</LD>
<LD>   But even as experts began analyzing tote systems that handle
wagers for tracks nationwide, a troubling question echoed across the
sport: Might such scams have gone undetected in the past?</LD>
<LD>   Executives from the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young said they have
been hired only to assess the systems, not to review past activity.
As yet, they are not even sure such a review would be possible.</LD>
<TE>   Some track executives -- eager to win back mistrustful bettors --
remained hopeful.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd welcome that kind of scrutiny," said Rick Baedeker,
president of Hollywood Park. "We have no reason to believe there have
been other incidents but we want to be diligent in making sure that's
the case."</TE>
<TE>   As the industry pursued damage control, an investigation of the
incident that sparked this concern reportedly widened to include a
third person.</TE>
<TE>   Racing officials became suspicious of the one ticket that
accounted for all six of the winning Breeders' Cup pick six wagers --
each worth $428,392. The ticket, purchased through an off-track
account wagering service in upstate New York, used one horse in each
of the first four races and all the horses in the final two races. It
was purchased by Derrick Davis, a self-employed computer repairman
from Baltimore, in a $12 denomination, costing $1,152.</TE>
<TE>   Autotote, the company that processed the wager, subsequently fired
one of its software engineers, Chris Harn, and claimed he rigged the
ticket by inserting winners after four of the six races were run.</TE>
<TE>   Harn and Davis attended Drexel University in the 1990s and were
reportedly fraternity brothers. Wednesday, the Associated Press
reported that another fraternity brother, Glen DaSilva of New York,
is under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Though the $3 million in winnings -- which included consolation
payoffs for five winners -- have been withheld, no one has been
charged and attorneys for Harn and Davis said their clients are
innocent.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of what investigators find, the industry has been
staggered and the National Thoroughbred Racing Assn. has convened the
emergency panel that hired Ernst &amp; Young.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we're interested in any assistance," said Craig
Fravel, a Del Mar executive vice president and NTRA board member.
"We're being very open-minded and we think hiring outside experts is
a positive step."</TE>
<TE>   Details of the accounting firm's probe could be released after an
NTRA meeting today. But searching for past scams by examining records
from Autotote and two other tote companies that service American
tracks would involve scrutinizing countless wagers.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Beyond the Glory: Brett Hull"</LD>
<LD>   Where: Fox Sports Net, Sunday, 8 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   The latest installment of "Beyond the Glory" tells the story of
Brett Hull, the son of a hockey legend who early on couldn't escape
his father's shadow or the scars of a broken home.</TE>
<TE>   But Hull emerged from the shadows, faced down the skeptics, set
family records and wrote a legend all his own. One of four sons of
Hall of Famer Bobby Hull Brett, who was born in Chicago in 1964, was
the chubby one.</TE>
<TE>   But his father thought Brett had the best chance of becoming an
NHL player because of his knack for shooting the puck.</TE>
<TE>   Brett's path was far from traditional and not without challenges,
including a difficult, abusive home life. Brett's siblings and mother
speak out on what it was like growing up in the Hull household and
the show includes a candid interview with Bobby.</TE>
<TE>   Brett seemed to lose interest in hockey after his parents
separated in 1982 when he was 17.</TE>
<TE>   But he fell in love with the sport again and may have saved a
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Gretzky, Brett's teammate with the St. Louis Blues, says
this about what Brett meant to the team and the city: "If it wasn't
for Brett Hull, the Blues wouldn't be in St. Louis today. It was a
great sports city, but at the time it was a struggling hockey city.
Brett Hull made the St. Louis Blues."</TE>
<TE>   Brett comes across as outspoken as his father. Says Bobby: "I've
never been one to pull punches.... When things aren't right, I tell
it like it is. And Brett is saying the same things I said 30 years
ago."</TE>

<LD>SOUTHERN SECTION</LD>
<LD>   Fountain Valley (3-5, 2-1) vs. Anaheim Esperanza (7-1, 2-1) at
Placentia Valencia HS, 7, tonight</LD>
<LD>   The winner will probably be runner-up for the Sunset League title
to Los Alamitos, which has defeated both teams. Esperanza, No. 8 in
The Times' rankings and No. 4 in the Southern Section's Division I
poll, is coming off a solid defensive effort against Huntington
Beach, holding the region's leading rusher, Pat Harrigan, who came in
averaging 252 yards a game, to only 61 yards in 15 carries. Fountain
Valley has bounced back from a dreadful opening month, when it lost
its first four games, including the first two by shutout.</LD>

<TE>   Anaheim Servite (8-1, 2-1) at Bellflower St. John Bosco (6-2,
3-0), 7:30 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   St. John Bosco, ranked No. 15 by The Times and No. 6 in the
section's Division I poll, has been the surprise of the Serra League
with victories over Loyola, Santa Margarita and Bishop Amat. A
victory over Servite would set up a final-week showdown with Santa
Ana Mater Dei for the league title. Mater Dei, also unbeaten in
league, plays Santa Margarita on Saturday. Servite, ranked No. 9 by
The Times and No. 4 in Division I, looked like a shoo-in for the
league title two weeks ago, but needs to rebound from a shaky
performance against Mater Dei last week.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Culver City (8-0, 3-0) at El Segundo (8-0, 3-0), 7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   This should be an enjoyable Pioneer League title decider for those
who like lots of scoring. El Segundo, No. 10 in Division X, is led by
quarterback Matt Engle and is averaging 42.1 points. Culver City, No.
3 in Division X, is led by quarterback Alex Cueva and is averaging
41.3 points. Engle has been intercepted only twice; Cueva only once.
Culver City may have better speed and athleticism, but El Segundo's
receivers are tough to stop because they don't drop passes.</TE>
<TE>   -- Eric Sondheimer</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Compton Dominguez (5-3, 2-0) at Downey (4-3, 2-0), 7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez, ranked No. 8 in the Division III poll, tries for its
third consecutive victory after emerging from a rough nonleague
schedule that cost the Dons three losses and Anthony Wheat, their
quarterback and free safety who is out for the season with a knee
injury sustained during a 37-0 loss to Long Beach Jordan on Oct. 11.
The winner clinches a tie for the San Gabriel Valley League title
and, potentially, a better seeding for the Division III playoffs.
Both teams have had strong defensive efforts in recent weeks,
including Downey's 28-0 league victory over Paramount last week.</TE>
<TE>   -- Mike Bresnahan</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana (7-1, 4-0) vs. Costa Mesa (6-2, 4-0) at Orange Coast
College, 7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   The revamped Golden West League has brought a resurgence to Santa
Ana. The Saints have won seven in a row and already have more
victories this season than they have had since a 9-3 season in 1989.
Since then, Santa Ana has endured three 0-10 seasons and three 1-9
seasons. This is a school that won a Southern Section title in 1985
and played in the section final in 1986. If the Saints are to win
their first league title since 1988, they will have to do so without
quarterback Omar Carrasco, who broke his foot last week and is out
for the season. Costa Mesa, No. 8 in Division VII, finished third in
the Pacific Coast League last season before losing in the first round
of the Division IX playoffs. The Mustangs are led by Keola Asuega,
who has rushed for 1,326 yards and 14 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   -- Peter Yoon</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Covina Northview (7-1, 3-0) vs. Pomona (7-1, 3-0) at Ganesha HS, 7
p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Pomona will try to tackle Northview's high-powered option offense
in the battle for the Valle Vista League title. Northview, No. 2 in
Division IX, is led by James Overstreet, who has rushed for 685 yards
and five touchdowns, Remington Hawkins, who has rushed for 470 yards
and 10 touchdowns, and quarterback Danny Bonilla, who has rushed for
314 yards and passed for 556. Northview is more seasoned, having
played a tougher schedule, but Pomona's Paul Thomas is averaging more
than seven yards per carry, and Mike Worrell more than eight.</TE>
<TE>   Pomona is No. 9 in Division IX. .</TE>
<TE>   -- Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CITY SECTION</TE>
<TE>   Carson (6-2, 3-0) at Gardena (6-2, 3-0), 7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   If Gardena pulls off the home victory, it will clinch its first
title in the Marine League since 1974 and be the league's No. 1
representative in the City playoffs. Carson needs victories over the
Panthers and Wilmington Banning next week to win the title outright.
Each team features a run-oriented attack that occasionally mixes in a
pass. Brandon Myles (620 yards, 11.9 average) and Jonathan Johnson
(494 yards) are the Colts' main rushers. Jason Franklin (530 yards)
and DeAndre Hughes (494 yards) give the Panthers balance in the
backfield. Carson quarterback Beau Davis has thrown for 914 yards and
eight touchdowns but is only completing 44% of his passes. Gardena's
LaFerrell Payne is one of the better running quarterbacks in the
section with a team-leading 596 yards. Gardena was in a position to
contend for the league title last year but Carson romped to a 48-0
victory.</TE>

<HD>Etiwanda's Poe Is on the Fast Track at Mt. SAC</HD>

<LD>Senior Michael Poe of Etiwanda got the confidence boost he needed
Tuesday when he won the Baseline League cross-country finals at Mount
San Antonio College with a career best of 14 minutes 57 seconds over
the 2.91-mile layout.</LD>
<LD>   Poe placed fourth in the Division I races of the Southern Section
and state championships last year, but finished a disappointing 13th
in 15:19 in the individual sweepstakes race of the Mt. SAC
Invitational on Oct. 26.</LD>
<LD>   "I was going into the race just to get my confidence up because of
my previous poor performance at Mt. SAC," Poe said. "I didn't feel
very good warming up, but I felt fine once the race started."</LD>
<TE>   Poe had a large lead when he passed the mile mark in 4:51 and he
won by 66 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt a little fatigued at the end because Mt. SAC's a hard
course," Poe said. "But I'm pretty sure if someone had come up on
[me], I could have gone faster."</TE>

<TE>   Jennie Lee of Huntington Beach Edison won the Sunset League girls'
golf title and qualified for the Southern Section individual finals
with a birdie on the first playoff hole Wednesday at El Prado Golf
Course.</TE>
<TE>   Lee tied at three-over-par 75 with Jennifer Osborn and Jane Chin
of Huntington Beach Marina and Jamie Oliver of Los Alamitos. Osborn
finished second and also gained entry into the section finals with a
par on the fourth playoff hole.</TE>

<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Dept. and principals from Sherman Oaks
Notre Dame and La Canada St. Francis are investigating an altercation
between a Notre Dame assistant football coach and a St. Francis
player that took place Friday during halftime of a Mission League
game in Sherman Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   The assistant coach, Lawrence Watkins, and the player, linebacker
Jason Turner, each filed a police report after the incident. Turner
alleged that Watkins hit him in the chest as the teams were coming
off the field, said Jason Lee, a spokesman for the LAPD. Watkins
alleged that Turner hit him on the left side of his body. Neither
reported sustaining injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie Connelly, principal at Notre Dame, said she and St.
Francis Principal Tom Moran "are in the process of resolving the
issue. We have the same philosophy and mission in our sports
programs, which is integrity, sportsmanship and teaching the kids
values beyond their athletic skills."</TE>
<TE>   Connelly declined to say whether Watkins has been disciplined for
his role in the incident.</TE>

<LD>With letter of intent day Wednesday, UC Santa Barbara has received
two late commitments in baseball, landing All-Southern Section
shortstop Chris Valaika from Newhall Hart and pitcher David Filipiak
from Laguna Hills.</LD>
<LD>   Another Laguna Hills baseball player, left-handed pitcher Kevin
Barnum, has committed to California.</LD>
<LD>   Drean Rucker of Moreno Valley Canyon Springs, considered among the
top linebackers in Southern California, has committed to USC.</LD>
<TE>   Oak Park senior Brandon Beck, the 2002 Tri-Valley League golfer of
the year, has also committed to California. Beck, who had a stroke
average of 72.9 for the Eagles in 2002, finished fifth in the
Southern Section individual finals. His seven-under-par 65 at Soule
Park in Ojai at the league finals established a school and league
record.</TE>
<TE>   Shaina Zaidi, a 5-foot-8 point guard from L.A. Marlborough, has
committed to UCLA. Zaidi averaged 22 points, eight rebounds and six
assists last season.</TE>
<TE>   Mandie Rowell, a pole vaulter at Santa Margarita, has committed to
Utah. She was the Orange County champion in 2001 but missed last
season because of an ankle injury.</TE>

<LD>There's nothing that can damage an athletic program faster than
arrogance. And make no mistake, arrogance is the reason Westchester
High's defending state champion boys' basketball team has lost two
top transfers for this season and might be sanctioned for alleged
rule violations.</LD>
<LD>   Too many people associated with the Comets failed to heed warning
signs when junior guard Gabriel Pruitt checked in from Compton
Centennial and sophomore forward Ray Reese arrived from Carson.</LD>
<LD>   It was obvious to seemingly everyone but Westchester officials
that both high-profile transfers should be scrutinized.</LD>
<TE>   In a 7-0 decision by a specially convened City Section rules
panel, Pruitt and Reese have been declared ineligible for one year.
Next week, the same committee may determine if Westchester
representatives illegally recruited the players and if the program
deserves any punishment.</TE>
<TE>   The decision was reached Tuesday, in the shadows of the 10 freeway
near downtown Los Angeles, in an atmosphere with all the intensity of
a championship basketball game between bitter rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Behind locked doors, in a cramped Los Angeles Unified School
District driver's training bungalow with no air conditioning,
attorneys, administrators, coaches and parents representing
Westchester and Carson made impassioned presentations trying to
convince the rules committee that their testimony was truthful and
compelling.</TE>
<TE>   Emotions were so high that school police were called after
Westchester assistant Marlon Morton directed a profanity-filled
tirade at reporters and Carson officials outside the bungalow. He
later calmed down and apologized.</TE>
<TE>   The ugly side of high school basketball was on full display, with
the issue of transfers front and center.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like my integrity questioned," Westchester Coach Ed Azzam
said. "We're not perfect and never have been, but we do try very hard
to follow the rules and it's real important to me that my reputation
suffers because we have transfers."</TE>
<TE>   Frustration levels have been rising throughout the coaching
community because of constant player movement, particularly in
basketball.</TE>
<TE>   Recruiting is suspected whenever a top player switches schools
even though legitimate issues can be involved. The challenge is
figuring out the truth.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't argue the fact we have transfers every single year,"
Azzam said. "Why do they come and how do they come? I have no idea.
Is Westchester an attractive place to go to if you're a basketball
player? Yes it is. The perception is no matter who we get in, we
recruited them."</TE>
<TE>   Westchester has been the beneficiary of transfer students but also
has lost its share.</TE>
<TE>   Hassan Adams, the best player on the Comets' state championship
team last season, came from L.A. Verbum Dei. David Bluthenthal and
Brandon Granville, who went on to play for USC, came to Westchester
from Venice and Playa del Rey St. Bernard, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   But Westchester lost center Jamal Sampson to Santa Ana Mater Dei,
guard Jason Hart to Inglewood and forward Tremaine Fowlkes to L.A.
Crenshaw, and they all ended up playing in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   As for Pruitt and Reese, it's not going to be fun having to sit
out this season, but they shouldn't be worried about their college
futures.</TE>
<TE>   If they take care of academics, missing a year of high school
basketball won't matter. Jordan Farmar sat out two months last season
after transferring from Lake Balboa Birmingham to Woodland Hills
Taft. Now that he's about to begin his junior season, he's ranked
among the top guards on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Azzam, who is about to enter his 24th year of coaching, insists
that neither he nor any of his assistants recruit players. He said he
supports a proposal scheduled to be voted on by the City Section in
March that would make transfer students ineligible for one year if
they do not change residences.</TE>
<TE>   Let's hope he gets his wish. The proposed rule won't end the
debate on transfers, but it would simplify things and start a thawing
process in the bitter relationship among coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Westchester administrators also should start taking seriously
questions of player eligibility when another school raises legitimate
concerns.</TE>

<HD>Change Is Great for Pomona</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Southern Section realigned divisions for football, moving
some schools to different leagues, no one was happier than the
players at Pomona High.</LD>
<LD>   Certainly, Coach John Capraro recognized the significance.</LD>
<LD>   "We were thinking that we weren't going to have to play [Covina]
Charter Oak and [Hacienda Heights] Los Altos anymore," said Capraro,
whose Red Devils were moved from the Miramonte League to the Valle
Vista League, which is in Division IX.</LD>
<TE>   "The Miramonte League has consistently been the best league in
Division VII, and this year, in Division VI," Capraro said. "You
throw in [Hacienda Heights] Wilson and [Pomona] Garey, who are
physical, and you have to be well-prepared each week to play the
whole Miramonte League schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not to say you don't have to be in the Valle Vista League,
but five of the last six years, a Miramonte League team has won the
championship."</TE>
<TE>   Pomona is 7-1, 3-0 in its new league -- the same record as Covina
Northview, which it plays Friday at Ganesha High. Northview is ranked
second in the division in the section's poll; Pomona is ninth.</TE>
<TE>   "It was almost unfair for those guys," Northview Coach Bill
Zernickow said of Pomona. "When you're in a league that's so tough,
it's hard to get a positive image of yourself and your team. They're
better this year, and they're having a revival because they've had
some success."</TE>
<TE>   That success comes from a united effort and solid leadership from
seniors Husain Abdullah, a wide receiver and safety, and two-way
linemen Faleolo Toia and Desmond Maxwell.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a bunch of guys who, when they play as a unit, are
sound," Capraro said. "No one kid is a team for us."</TE>
<TE>   Running back Paul Thomas, a junior, has rushed for more than 800
yards, and senior quarterback Josh Huerta doesn't make many mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "We always felt if we had a chance to get to the playoffs in
Division VII, we could do some things," Capraro said. "We did that
last year by upsetting [Gardena] Serra. [But] every year, we knew the
first two playoff spots were going to Los Altos and Charter Oak.</TE>
<TE>   "We figure we're playing schools [in Division IX] more like us,
competition-wise, skill-wise, size-wise."</TE>
<TE>   Capraro, whose teams haven't won a league championship in his
eight seasons, is cautiously approaching what could be a watershed
season.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't played anybody," Capraro said. "We'll find out how
good we are Friday night because Northview is a heck of a football
team.</TE>
<TE>   "What people have to understand is, we're not doing anything
different from what we did the last eight years."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Millikan Coach Kirk Diego wasn't even sure the Stanford
band could have helped his team Friday against Compton.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams trailed, 15-14, after Compton scored with one second left
in the Moore League game. All Compton had to do was kick off, make a
tackle, then celebrate a rare league victory.</TE>
<TE>   However ...</TE>
<TE>   Compton was penalized for excessive celebration after its
touchdown, forcing the Tarbabes to kick from their 25-yard line
rather than the 40.</TE>
<TE>   Compton attempted an on-side kick to reduce the chances of
Millikan returning it for a touchdown, like California did in 1982,
when it used five laterals and made its way through the bewildered
Stanford band for the winning touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   However ...</TE>
<TE>   A Compton player illegally touched the ball before it traveled 10
yards, giving the Rams possession at the Compton 31 with still one
second left.</TE>
<TE>   Diego initially called for a pass into the end zone, but after
receiving input from his assistants, decided to send out Tom Peale,
who routinely makes field goals from 50-plus yards during practice.
Peale was short on the 48-yard attempt.</TE>
<TE>   However ...</TE>
<TE>   Compton was off-sides on the play, allowing Peale another chance
from 43 yards. This one sailed through the uprights, giving the Rams
a 17-15 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "That was pretty amazing," said Diego, in his second year at
Millikan. "Four plays and three penalties, all in one second."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Foothill running back Mike Liti, a senior, has tried to pay homage
to his Tongan heritage by asking newspapers to refer to him as
Maikolo, a derivative of his father's name, Kolo, who was born in
Tonga.</TE>
<TE>   And how is he referred to by his teammates?</TE>
<TE>   "The kids at school," his father said, "call him Mike."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Laborde rushed 44 times for a school-record 304 yards,
including touchdown runs of 24, 15, 33, eight and two yards in Lebec
Frazier Mountain's 35-19 High Desert League victory over Rosamond.</TE>
<TE>   He broke the record of 215 yards he set a week earlier against
Bishop, which had broken the record of 165 he set the week before
against Lake Isabella Kern Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "The old record was something like 148 yards -- nothing real
special," Coach Jason Fayter said. "He had his three best games of
the year since missing two games with a neck stinger."</TE>
<TE>   For the season, Laborde has 915 yards and 12 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Salter, a two-way senior starter at Westlake Village Oaks
Christian, returned home Saturday after an eight-day hospital stay
for head injuries he suffered after falling asleep at the wheel of
the family SUV and hitting a tree at more than 60 mph on Oct. 25.</TE>
<TE>   Salter, a 6-foot-3, 190-pounder who played defensive end and wide
receiver, was wearing a seat belt, and the air bags deployed in the
SUV he was driving the night his team played Carpinteria, according
to Coach Bill Redell.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he'll come back to school full time until after
Thanksgiving," Redell said. "I talked to him [Tuesday]. He's in great
spirits, but he's disappointed he won't be able to play football the
rest of the year."</TE>
<TE>   Players from nearby Oak Park High sent a get-well card to Salter.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a classy thing," Redell said. "They're our rival, but one
of their players brought a card to our practice to give him. It shows
there are a few more important things than football."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks senior Jesse Ainsworth twice exceeded the school
record for longest field goal in a 30-7 victory over Simi Valley
Royal.</TE>
<TE>   Ainsworth, also a 6-3, 200-pound defensive lineman, had field
goals of 41, 55 and 56 yards, breaking the 51-yard standard set by
Jack Wilson in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Ainsworth will attend Arizona State next year.</TE>
<TE>   "His 55-yarder was really strong," Coach Mike Sanders said. "I've
seen Jesse kick 60 yards before without any problem. I'm worried
about the protection and the snap, I'm not really worried about the
kick."</TE>
<TE>   Ainsworth, who kicks off a one-inch tee instead of the high
school-standard two-inch tee for field goals to prepare himself for
college, has made 10 of 11 attempts this season.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After beginning his career with three victories, Capo Di Capo hasn't
had much luck reaching the winner's circle.</LD>
<LD>   The 5-year-old Capote gelding, owned by actor Albert Finney and
Karen and Mickey Taylor of Seattle Slew fame, has lost 10 of his last
11. However, things could change today. A winner in both his races at
Hollywood Park, Capo Di Capo will break from the rail against seven
others in the seventh, a $55,000 allowance at seven furlongs. The
race is the fifth leg of a pick six with a carry-over of $82,886.</LD>
<LD>   Now trained by Neil French after beginning his career with Richard
Mandella, Capo Di Capo is the 4-1 third choice on Russ Hudak's
morning line. He will be ridden by Alex Solis, his most frequent
jockey.</LD>
<TE>   The field includes three others who have won at Hollywood Park.
Golden Hare, who is trained by Mandella, rallied from last to win at
6 1/2 furlongs here during the spring; High Wire Act, in his first
race since June 14; and Last Parade, who was 30-1 when he upset
Palmeiro and six others nearly a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the field are the Bob Baffert-trained So Urgent and
Skip To The Stone, longshot Not For Me and Lugny.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: A full field of $50,000 3-year-olds get together
in the sixth at Hollywood Park. Six Hitter and Malone are the ones to
beat.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Mike Mitchell. The trainer finished Oak Tree on a roll,
winning with eight of 23 starters and had another winner (Go Girl Go)
on the first day at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Omar Berrio and Chance Rollins. The two jockeys were a
combined five for 100 at Oak Tree.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A place pick all using Candita in the first,
Rmisvesta and Bella Nunzi in the second, Darling Demon and Maruka in
the third, singling Gamblin Town in the fourth, Roberta's Mango and
Cee's Valley Girl in the fifth, singling Malone in the sixth and
Golden Hare in the seventh and Treink and Jade Vixen in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/1. Money: Previous day/meet
total. $3.60/$3.60. Total money bet: $16.</TE>

<HD>Eloranta Out at Least a Week With Knee Injury</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>OTTAWA</DL>
<LD>Mikko Eloranta did not make the transcontinental flight with the
Kings from San Jose on Wednesday, the Finnish winger returning
instead to Los Angeles for tests on his sprained left knee.</LD>
<LD>   An MRI exam revealed no tearing, but Eloranta, injured in a
knee-on-knee collision with Bryan Marchment of the San Jose Sharks in
the third period of the Kings' 5-2 loss Tuesday night, is expected to
be sidelined for at least a week.</LD>
<LD>   Craig Johnson probably will fill in for Eloranta on a checking
line with Brad Chartrand and Ian Laperriere, Coach Andy Murray said.</LD>
<TE>   "They're similar players," he said of Johnson and Eloranta.</TE>
<TE>   Enforcer Ken Belanger, who suffered a concussion Tuesday night,
made the trip east. He is scheduled for a neurological exam today in
Ottawa.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jaroslav Modry's goal Tuesday night was his fifth in four games.</TE>
<TE>   "We encourage our defensemen to get involved in the attack,"
Murray said. "But I'm a little concerned about Modry's defensive game
right now. Modry and [Lubomir] Visnovsky defensively were not very
good. They have to be better."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ziggy Palffy, who sat out six games because of a groin strain, has
no points in the four games since Jason Allison was sidelined because
of a knee injury and has not scored a goal since the season opener
Oct. 9.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he can play better," Murray said. "I think he wants to
play better. We need him to play better."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Johnson has no goals in 13 games, Erik Rasmussen has
none in 12 and Jaroslav Bednar has none in 11. Bryan Smolinski has
two in 13. Eric Belanger, who had three goals in the first four
games, has none in the last nine.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Of the 38 goals given up by the Kings in 13 games, 22 have been
scored in the third period or overtime, six in their last two games.</TE>
<TE>   "What's interesting is that [in the last two games], we thought
the third period was our best period," Murray said. "Territorially,
we dominated the third period [against the Sharks]. I think at one
point the shots were 15-3. We were all over them.</TE>
<TE>   "But what happened there: We didn't score and you're pressing and
it's getting late.... We've had an inability to score timely goals."</TE>

<HD>Fisher Finds Serenity</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BOSTON -- The tattoo on Derek Fisher's forearm, so fresh the skin
around it is still reddish, is a Chinese character Fisher said
translates into "To be faithful in heart, mind and spirit."</LD>
<LD>   It is done in broad, dark strokes, so as not to be a passing
thought but a life's map.</LD>
<LD>   Fisher, who turned 28 in August, has never been stronger, he said,
both in body and in temperament. He is wrapped in muscle, rapt in the
game he plays, deeply satisfied in a personal relationship he
recently resumed.</LD>
<TE>   And so, standing not long ago in a tattoo parlor, as he had more
than once before but never committed to ink on skin, Fisher ordered
what he believed would define him and then rolled up his sleeve.</TE>
<TE>   "I've thought about getting one over the years," said Fisher, who
otherwise is unpainted. "But I wanted something that meant something
to me."</TE>
<TE>   His faith, he said, is in his family, in God, in himself and in
his occupation. Free of the foot surgeries and the hours of
rehabilitation, having pushed through a third consecutive
championship postseason during which his abilities were frequently
and publicly questioned, Fisher said he was pleased with where he is,
with so much more to go.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything I believe in and I stand for, 'To be faithful in
heart, mind and spirit' to that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox, serving the last of his six-game suspension tonight,
joined the team Wednesday morning. He'll watch the game on television
tonight, though he wasn't sure where. "I don't know how beloved I am
in the area," he said. "I've had things thrown at me in a couple
places here, and that was when I was a Celtic." ... Shaquille O'Neal
practiced for about an hour Wednesday, mostly in half-court drills.
He won't play in a game until Tuesday at the earliest.</TE>

<TE>   Update -- The Celtics played Wednesday night in Chicago, allowing
the Lakers the luxury of being the more rested team in a strange
town. The Lakers have had some trouble defending Celtic forward Paul
Pierce, having allowed him 33, 33 and 42 points in the last three
meetings.</TE>

<LD>Owner-trainer Janet Van Bebber has a horse in the $500,000 Champion
of Champions, which will be run Dec. 14, and his name is not Tailor
Fit.</LD>
<LD>   Streakin Sin Tacha, a 4-year-old gelding, earned a spot in the
Grade I race with a decisive victory in the $300,000 MBNA American
Challenge Championship Saturday night at Lone Star Park.</LD>
<LD>   Tailor Fit, last year's Champion of Champions winner also trained
by Van Bebber, was among the horses beaten by Streakin Sin Tacha.
Ridden by Alvin Brossette, the son of Streakin La Jolla completed the
440 yards in 21.279 seconds. Other qualifiers for the Champion of
Champions include Corona Kool, Whosleavingwho and A Ransom.</LD>
<TE>   On the same night, A Secret Account earned his sixth career stakes
victory at Los Alamitos when he won the $15,000 Cash Rate Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Tylers Cash Flow. 2. Magical Nick. 3. Pals Eyes. 4.
Dreamer Beamer. 5. Whispering Lies. 6. Wilyacrossmyvalle. 7. One Fast

<HD>It Shakes a Village</HD>
<DH>Mammoth looking more like a world-class ski resort, and
some in the community wonder if that's a good thing</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Pete Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MAMMOTH LAKES</DL>
<LD>The forecast calls for a significant whitening of the landscape today
and through much of the weekend, thanks to the arrival of the
season's first major storm, which couldn't be more welcome.</LD>
<LD>   Today is a big day in this small but growing Eastern Sierra city.
Not only will Mammoth Lakes celebrate the beginning of another season
at the world-renowned Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, it will usher in a
new era.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time since its lifts began carrying people up the
nearby slopes nearly 50 years ago, one of the finest ski and
snowboard areas in North America will have the look -- and eventually
the feel -- of an actual resort.</LD>
<TE>   The Village at Mammoth, a sprawling four-story condominium complex
long in the planning stages, sprang up dramatically during the
off-season near the intersection of Minaret Road and Main Street and
is scheduled to open in February.</TE>
<TE>   Designed to give the town a central gathering place, the village
covers 20 acres and boasts 166 one-, two- and three-bedroom luxury
rental units as well as dozens of restaurants, bars and retail
stores. It also features a new gondola, scheduled to open as early as
Christmas, which will carry skiers and snowboarders to the slopes
without having first to drive or catch a shuttle to any of three base
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is happy with so monumental a change, which will
forever alter a destination that for so long has had a woodsy,
down-to-earth feel. In fact, though the conversion of Mammoth into a
pedestrian village-type community was part of a vision statement
adopted by the community 10 years ago, emotions have been mixed for
the last several months.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll bring about such a big change and that's both good and
bad," said Nancy Bristow, who moved here 10 years ago because of the
small-town feel. "It'll mean more business for everyone, and real
estate prices will go up. But on the other hand, there will probably
be more crime and more traffic and congestion."</TE>
<TE>   As for the Village Gondola, which like the base facilities will be
serviced via shuttle from anywhere in town, it'll provide a fourth
access point to the slopes, helping to alleviate crowding at the
three others.</TE>
<TE>   But it has some locals on edge because, as it covers the one-mile
distance to the Canyon Lodge base facility, it will carry skiers and
snowboarders directly through the backyards and over the rooftops of
residents whose property abuts or intrudes into an easement held by
the ski area since the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   "People are saying we'll need to put up shower curtains now,"
joked Kathy Copeland, in whose backyard a 100-foot gondola tower
recently was erected. "Nobody will be able to see into my bathroom
window, but if they could I'd give them a show."</TE>
<TE>   Since the partnership began six years ago with the town, ski area
and the development company, Intrawest, controversy has swirled over
a variety of issues related to growth, such as water demands and
affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   The push to bring major commercial airline service to Mammoth has
recently gained momentum, further fueling the debate over what's
right and wrong for the town and surrounding environment.</TE>
<TE>   "Even I have mixed feelings," Mayor Rick Wood said. "People who
came here years ago loved it for what it was, so there is this
undercurrent of anxiety about what it's really going to be like when
it's done, and I share that anxiety."</TE>
<TE>   But the reality, Wood added, is that Mammoth must change if it is
going to compete with world-class resorts sprinkled throughout the
mountainous West. And that the new Mammoth, like it or not, is here
to stay.</TE>
<TE>   This is, he pointed out, what Dave McCoy envisioned as he
developed the ski area from a single rope-tow operation in 1953 to a
world-class facility that today boasts 27 lifts, among them
state-of-the-art high-speed quad chairs and, now, three gondolas.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to maintain its prominence among an always fastidious
skiing and snowboarding public, Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, which logs
more than a million visitors a year to lead California resorts, has
spent millions over the years -- $175 million in the last five years
alone -- on improvements.</TE>
<TE>   But whereas those expenditures went largely toward things such as
terrain parks, upgrading the chair lift networks, enhancing guest
services and expanding snow-making capabilities, this year the focus
has shifted toward the village and its gondola.</TE>
<TE>   Mammoth is spending $24 million on a project that also includes a
services center for skiers, a restaurant at the base of the gondola,
and ski and snowboard shops within a village.</TE>
<TE>   Only some of the money will actually remain on the hill. Most
noteworthy among on-mountain improvements is the construction, thanks
to a grooming machine called a Zaugg Pipe Monster, of what is being
called a Super-Duper Pipe, 600 feet long and with 22-foot walls,
enabling 35-foot launches from top riders.</TE>
<TE>   "All we need now is enough snow to cover it up," ski area
spokeswoman Joani Lynch said.</TE>
<TE>   Today's storm, expected to drop as much as a foot of powder,
should provide a much-needed boost. Mammoth will open on a very
limited basis, the only open trails being Broadway and Fascination,
serviced via Broadway Express.</TE>
<TE>   More lifts and terrain will open as conditions allow.</TE>

<HD>Knicks End Skid, Thanks to Nailon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lee Nailon gave the New York Knicks exactly what they missed during
an 0-4 start -- a second offensive option at crunch time.</LD>
<LD>   Nailon scored 10 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter and the
Knicks defeated Sacramento, 95-88, Wednesday night at Madison Square
Garden to hand the Kings their first three-game losing streak in two
seasons.</LD>
<LD>   "The last two or three games our fourth quarters had been bad. I
wanted to step up and let everyone know that we can win games,"
Nailon said. "We've been in games, but have not put together a fourth
quarter."</LD>
<TE>   Nailon signed with the Knicks after being released by New Orleans
following an argument with Coach Paul Silas during an exhibition
game. Nailon started 41 games for the Hornets last season when Jamal
Mashburn was injured.</TE>
<TE>   Allan Houston scored 21 points for the Knicks, who had six players
in double figures. Chris Webber scored 22 points for the Kings, who
played their fourth road game in five nights.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 99, New Jersey 93 -- Ray Allen scored 29 points and Toni
Kukoc had 26 at Milwaukee, where the Bucks sent the Nets to their
first loss.</TE>
<TE>   The defending Eastern Conference champions were trying to start
5-0 for the first time in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kidd led New Jersey with 24 points, but Richard Jefferson,
averaging a team-high 17.3 points, was held to one point.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans 86, Seattle 84 -- Baron Davis had 23 points, 10
rebounds and nine assists at New Orleans, and the Hornets handed the
SuperSonics their first loss.</TE>
<TE>   Davis got the best of his showdown with fellow All-Star guard Gary
Payton, who had 29 points and nine assists.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 106, Toronto 92 -- Dirk Nowitzki had 28 points and 13
rebounds at Toronto to help the Mavericks remain unbeaten.</TE>
<TE>   Voshon Lenard scored 20 points for the Raptors, who were without
the injured Vince Carter and Antonio Davis, and who played without
starting center Jelani McCoy after the first quarter. McCoy left
because of back spasms.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 107, Cleveland 100 -- Jerry Stackhouse scored 35 points
at Washington and the Wizards ended a two-game skid.</TE>
<TE>   Stackhouse scored eight consecutive points in a game-opening 19-3
run.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jordan was 0 for 4 from the field after three quarters but
averted the first scoreless game of his career with a jumper and an
acrobatic move for a layup down the stretch. He finished with six
points.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 91, Chicago 69 -- Antoine Walker scored a season-high 22
points to spark the Celtics at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulls shot just under 30% from the field and committed 20
turnovers -- twice as many as the Celtics -- including five by rookie
Jay Williams. Boston scored 22 points off the turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 80, Utah 78 -- Jon Barry made a three-point basket with
22.3 seconds left at Salt Lake City, and the Pistons took advantage
of a rare night off for Karl Malone.</TE>
<TE>   Malone, bothered by a head cold and held scoreless Sunday at
Seattle for the first time in his career, sat out for only the 10th
time.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 93, Atlanta 88 -- Penny Hardaway scored 16 of his 20
points in the fourth quarter, helping the Suns rally from a 14-point
deficit at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Marion had 26 points and nine rebounds to help end Atlanta's
three-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Portland 94, Memphis 88 -- Rasheed Wallace had 18 points and eight
rebounds for the Trail Blazers at Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis (0-5) is the league's only winless team.</TE>

<HD>Legendary High School Coach Wootten to Quit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After winning more games than any high school boys' basketball coach
and sending 13 players to the NBA, Morgan Wootten will put down his
whistle and end a career that spanned 46 years.</LD>
<LD>   Wootten, 71, announced his retirement Wednesday at a news
conference at DeMatha High in Hyattsville, Md., where he compiled a
1,274-192 record since taking the job in 1956.</LD>
<LD>   "I just finally got that gut feeling that now is the time,"
Wootten said. "I thought about it all summer long. And then, in early
September, there was no question in my mind. I wanted to do it the
right way."</LD>
<TE>   Two years ago, Wootten became only the third high school coach to
be inducted into the basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   He never had a losing season and his teams won at least 20 games
in 44 consecutive seasons. The Stags were voted national champion
five times.</TE>
<TE>   Wootten turned down several lucrative offers to leave DeMatha to
coach in college, but said he never regretted staying at DeMatha.</TE>
<TE>   Among the players he coached who went to the NBA were Adrian
Dantley, Kenny Carr, Danny Ferry and Sidney Lowe. During the 1960s,
DeMatha ended the 71-game winning streak of New York's Power Memorial
Academy, which was led by Lew Alcindor (later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar).</TE>

Oregon, UCLA, Arizona State, California, USC, Stanford, Washington,
Oregon State and Washington State.</TE>

<TE>   The Big West Conference, which may lose its second member in the

<TE>   Commissioner Dennis Farrell said UC Davis has not been formally
invited but hopes to make such an announcement in the next month.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is a nationally recognized Division II program but has been
actively seeking a move to Division I.</TE>
<TE>   Students at Davis will vote on a Nov. 12 referendum that will fund
an additional $4 million for additional scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   Davis Athletic Director Greg Warzecka said the school expects to
meet a Dec. 1 deadline to announce its exploratory status as Division
I member in 2002-03.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kurt Warner starts throwing today, confident he'll have to sit out
only one more game because of a broken pinkie.</LD>
<LD>   The St. Louis Rams' quarterback, who won his second
most-valuable-player award last season, also agrees with his coach
that he deserves his job back whenever he's healthy.</LD>
<LD>   Backup Marc Bulger has led the Rams to three victories; Warner was
0-4 before getting hurt.</LD>
<TE>   "Marc's played tremendous, no question about it," Warner said
Wednesday. "But I feel I've earned the right to call this my team and
when I'm healthy I'm going to be back in there."</TE>
<TE>   Warner could be back for the Nov. 18 game against the Chicago
Bears.</TE>
<TE>   Bulger will start at home against the San Diego Chargers on
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Mike Martz quashed a potential quarterback controversy for
the second time in three days.</TE>
<TE>   "I've just never been part of the amnesia crowd, I guess," Martz
said.</TE>
<TE>   "How in the world could you turn your back on a guy that's done so
much? I don't understand that, I don't deal with it very well."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis Colt running backs Edgerrin James and Ricky Williams
will sit out for the second consecutive game Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   James had been playing on a surgically repaired left knee before

also has rib cartilage damage. Williams has a hamstring injury.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota receiver Derrick Alexander is out for the season because

<TE>   Zach Wiegert was put on injured reserve by the Jacksonville
Jaguars, who have lost both starting offensive tackles in the span of
three weeks. Wiegert had surgery on his left knee Wednesday....
Kansas City linebacker Lew Bush was suspended for four games after
testing positive for a banned substance. The Chiefs said the action
was taken after a routine test by the league, which ordered the
suspension because of a violation of "anabolic steroid and substance
policy."</TE>

<LD>The Florida Panthers made sure Mario Lemieux didn't spoil their
night.</LD>
<LD>   Valeri Bure scored at 2:19 of overtime and the Panthers overcame a
late goal by Lemieux to beat the Pittsburgh Penguins, 4-3, Wednesday
night at Sunrise, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Bure took a pass from Kristian Huselius and squeezed the puck past
Johan Hedberg on the right side for a power-play goal, ending the
Penguins' four-game winning streak.</LD>
<TE>   The Panthers appeared headed for a win in regulation until
Lemieux, the NHL's leading scorer with 29 points, tied the score,
3-3, with nine seconds left the third period.</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Luongo stopped 26 shots for the second victory of his
career in nine starts against the Penguins.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 4, Vancouver 0 -- Mike Modano had two goals and an assist,
and Brenden Morrow scored on a penalty shot to help the Stars hand
the Canucks their first road loss.</TE>
<TE>   Marty Turco stopped 26 shots for the Stars.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 5, Colorado 2 -- Marian Hossa scored three goals -- the
second hat trick of his career -- and Daniel Alfredsson had a goal
and two assists as the Senators dropped the Avalanche to 0-3-3 at
home.</TE>
<TE>   Magnus Arvedson also scored and Patrick Lalime had 36 saves for
Ottawa, which extended its franchise record by scoring a power-play
goal in its ninth consecutive game.</TE>

<LD>When Jelena Dokic speaks, she looks down. At her fingers, at the
table where she is sitting, at her feet. She looks across the room,
at the wall, at the door. She looks longingly at the door. She is
eager for the escape it provides, for the way out it signifies.</LD>
<LD>   Dokic has played 28 tennis tournaments this year and has come to
Los Angeles to play in No. 29. To compare, top-ranked Serena Williams
has played 12 events. Second-ranked Venus Williams has played in 15.
It is no wonder Dokic is pale. She seems thin and she is tired.</LD>
<LD>   "Mentally and physically, it has been a hard year," Dokic says.</LD>
<TE>   She is 19 and has been a citizen of Yugoslavia, the place of her
birth. She has been taken to Australia, where her father and coach,
Damir, hoped for a country's tennis association to take his daughter
and family, welcome them and hand them the means to make Jelena a
star.</TE>
<TE>   But things didn't work out. They seldom seem to when Damir is
involved, and now the family has relocated to Belgrade after being
rumored to be seeking refuge in Britain, in a country without much
female tennis talent, where Jelena's talent might be better
appreciated by the country's federation.</TE>
<TE>   His daughter is sweet, soft-spoken and fluent in Serbo-Croatian
and English. But Damir is a caricature of the bad tennis father. He
has been banned from tournaments for sixth months. He has been
photographed passed out on sidewalks outside tournaments and was
tossed out of the U.S. Open two years ago for throwing a profane
tantrum about the price of salmon in the players' lounge while his
embarrassed daughter stood by, both supporting the man who gave her a
racket and having her cheeks turn red and her eyes fill with tears at
the public humiliation.</TE>
<TE>   Last month it was reported that Dokic had requested Damir and her
mother, Liliana, be banned from her matches, though Dokic says that
isn't true.</TE>
<TE>   She looks up and smiles only when Enrique Bernoldi is mentioned.
Bernoldi, a Brazilian Formula One race car driver, has been Dokic's
constant companion the last couple of months, after his team suffered
financial problems and couldn't field cars in end-of-season races.</TE>
<TE>   "I've driven with Enrique and gone 265 kilometers an hour," Dokic
says proudly. The speed -- about 165 mph -- the freedom, Dokic says
she loves it, and who can blame her?</TE>
<TE>   Dokic has no coach, other than her father, and no agent to protect
her from demands on her time, from questions she might not want to
answer.</TE>
<TE>   Here comes yet another young, female tennis player who must
wrestle in a public way with the issues of a father who is the sole
promoter, facilitator, king-maker, mastermind of the career, and who
also stumbles and bumbles across the stage he has created for his
daughter with behavior the daughter privately despises from a man she
very much loves.</TE>
<TE>   It has happened so often, with Steffi Graf and Mary Pierce and
Venus and Serena Williams, teenage girls left alone on a podium to
explain some outrageous act or statement from the father.</TE>
<TE>   Dokic has been ranked as high as No. 4 in the world this year,
though since a second-round loss at the U.S. Open, she has trundled,
exhausted, across Europe trying to defend computer points earned from
a year ago but only losing ground in a series of early-round losses.</TE>
<TE>   "I am going to do things differently next year," says Dokic, who
plays her opening match at the Home Depot WTA Championships today at
Staples Center against Anastasia Myskina of Russia. "I am going to
play much less, maybe 20 or 22 tournaments, and I am going to prepare
better for the Grand Slams."</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing Dokic will say against her father, who is
suspected of putting his daughter's name to an unusual, public
declaration of support for a Serbian nationalist political candidate
during the summer.</TE>
<TE>   While refusing to deny she made the statement, Dokic says, "I am
not interested in politics. I am not political. I am only a tennis
player."</TE>
<TE>   Bernoldi, through a WTA spokesman, says he is not giving
interviews. Dokic calls him "a kindred spirit" and says he is the one
person she has found who understands her determination and athletic
focus. She met Bernoldi, 24, at a tournament in London six months ago
and, Dokic says, the connection was immediate.</TE>
<TE>   "We found a way to talk to each other right away," she says. "He
has been very good for my mind."</TE>
<TE>   Dokic has been a pro for nearly four years and her considerable
talent -- she has an elegantly lethal forehand and smooth movement --
has been apparent since she knocked Martina Hingis out of Wimbledon
in the first round in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there has been concern about Dokic and the distractions from
her father for nearly that long. Some tour officials worry that Damir
orchestrated Jelena's brutal playing schedule this year and that her
unwillingness to replace Damir with a full-time coach who might help
her add depth to her power game is hurting her progress.</TE>
<TE>   None of this is true, Dokic says. "My father is the person who has
always understood me and wanted the best for me," she says as she
twists her fingers into a pattern that resembles prison bars. "When I
was 11, he took us to Australia because it would be best, and when he
thought Australia was not the best, he took us back to Yugoslavia."</TE>
<TE>   Damir isn't here. His tired, sad-eyed daughter is. She talks more
eagerly of the approaching holiday she anticipates than this last
tournament. Around her the Williams sisters are heading off to
announce a new sponsorship deal. Lindsay Davenport is happily
recounting the occasion of her recent engagement. Monica Seles speaks
eloquently of the joy she gets from competing at tennis.</TE>
<TE>   Dokic walks out of the noisy room, aimed at the door, heading for
her release.</TE>

<HD>Scioscia Takes One for Team</HD>
<DH>Angel skipper is a solid choice for American League manager
of the year. Cardinals' La Russa gets NL honor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the waning days of his tenure as the Angel general manager, in the
final days of a wretched 1999 season, Bill Bavasi met with Don Baylor
and Phil Garner about the team's managerial vacancy. Both men were
interested in the job, and Bavasi recommended both to Disney
executives interested in hiring a big-name manager.</LD>
<LD>   But as those executives then dawdled for weeks in replacing
Bavasi, the Detroit Tigers grabbed Garner and the Chicago Cubs nabbed
Baylor. The new general manager, Bill Stoneman, settled for Mike
Scioscia, otherwise bound for a minor league managerial job with the
Colorado Rockies.</LD>
<LD>   Funny how things work out. Three years later, Baylor is out of
work. Garner is out of work. And, 10 days after the Angels won their
first World Series championship, Scioscia was honored Wednesday as
the American League manager of the year.</LD>
<TE>   On a conference call conducted as he chaperoned his daughter's
fifth-grade class on a field trip to a Thousand Oaks botanical
garden, Scioscia deflected the honor onto his players.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud to accept this award on their behalf," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The National League honoree was Tony La Russa of the St. Louis
Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals won 97 games and the NL Central title during an
emotionally trying season that included the deaths of pitcher Darryl
Kile and beloved broadcaster Jack Buck, four days apart. Nothing
could prepare La Russa for the leadership inherent in trying to
balance what he called "personal sadness and professional
responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Said La Russa: "I don't think anybody will ever be able to
describe just how sad and how deeply affected everybody was.... This
award is a recognition our club and our organization didn't give into
it."</TE>
<TE>   The voting, conducted by the Baseball Writers Assn. of America,
was concluded before the playoffs started. Scioscia received no extra
credit for leading the Angels to the World Series, but he got credit
for leading a team that finished last year 41 games out of first
place and started this year 6-14 to a club-record 99 victories and
the Angels' first playoff berth in 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   Of the three other AL managers to receive votes -- in order,
Oakland's Art Howe, Minnesota's Ron Gardenhire and the Yankees' Joe
Torre -- none led a team that finished with a losing record last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia selected an enthusiastic and relatively young coaching
staff that helped restore joy to a clubhouse torn apart by mutiny
during the final year under former manager Terry Collins. Two of
those coaches, Bud Black and Ron Roenicke, have been considered for
managerial openings this year. Another, Alfredo Griffin, has been
called the next great Dominican manager by former Montreal manager
Felipe Alou.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Scioscia persuaded the Angel hitters to sacrifice
at-bats -- not to mention their statistics -- so that the team could
win via bunts, stolen bases and hit-and-run plays. It worked, in no
small measure because Scioscia empowered the players to enforce the
plan and take credit for its success.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that he talks about all these people who had input into
our success speaks volumes for Mike," Stoneman said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's obviously at the center of all that. He understands very
clearly that baseball is a team game and we need everybody to pull
their weight. He's very appreciative when everybody does, and that
leadership helps get the players to understand."</TE>
<TE>   Center fielder and team leader Darin Erstad said repeatedly during
the season that "I would love to play for Mike Scioscia the rest of
my career." After the Angels won the World Series championship, ace
pitcher Jarrod Washburn saluted Scioscia and said, "I hope I never
have to play for anyone else."</TE>
<TE>   In Scioscia, the Angels have found not only success but stability.
He is the 16th manager in club history, but next season he will
become the first since Bill Rigney -- the Angels' expansion manager
-- to be the opening day manager for four consecutive years.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman declined to discuss whether the Angels would consider
reworking Scioscia's contract. Howe, who never has led a team to a
postseason series victory, left the A's for a reported four-year,
$9.4-million deal with the New York Mets.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels originally signed Scioscia to a three-year contract
worth about $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, they extended his contract through 2005, upgrading the
final year of the original deal and making the four guaranteed years
worth about $3 million.</TE>

<LD>I was sitting with Elgin Baylor in Staples Center on Wednesday
afternoon, and if you had noticed Elgin Baylor sitting all by himself
indoors on a wonderful sunny day watching two women playing tennis,
you'd have gone out of your way, too, to make sure the Clippers'
general manager was feeling all right.</LD>
<LD>   I had been vaccinated before coming to the women's tournament, and
because I know there have been cases of some strange side effects
after getting a flu shot, I tried talking to Baylor in the event he
had just gotten his and was now delirious and had no idea where he
was.</LD>
<LD>   "You know, I'd like to know why she's wearing a watch too," Baylor
said after I pointed to the flashy wristwatch one of the tennis
players was wearing. "I'll betcha it's because she's superstitious."</LD>
<TE>   When I arrived at Staples Center, I couldn't think of any good
reason to actually talk to a tennis player, but now I was on a
mission to satisfy Baylor's curiosity. So I went to the Chick Hearn
Press Room only to discover the tennis reporters were watching "Days
of Our Lives."</TE>
<TE>   That would explain why Sports Editor and tennis groupie Bill Dwyre
knows all about Lexie Carver's being thrown in jail on kidnapping
charges, and to be honest, I can't blame tennis reporters for
watching anything but tennis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   JUSTINE HENIN, the wristwatch player, took her place on the podium
so the tennis reporters could pay homage, and said, "It's hard to
find the great motivation" to play when the arena is almost empty.</TE>
<TE>   The tennis reporters seemed to appreciate that, but I found that
odd, asking her, "Isn't the money [$765,000 to the winner] enough
motivation" to play tennis for a couple of hours?</TE>
<TE>   She came back with some double talk, so then I let her have it: "I
don't watch a lot of tennis," I said. "Why do you wear a watch out
there? Are you paid to wear a watch -- you know, an endorsement?"</TE>
<TE>   "No," she said, and you would have thought I had asked her for
Anna Kournikova's phone number with the dirty look I got.</TE>
<TE>   When the news conference ended, I went to Henin but was stopped by
an official who scolded me for being "too direct."</TE>
<TE>   Then Henin said, "too aggressive," and that's when I noticed
Baylor standing in the rear of the room, and I knew he was dying to
know if he was right, so I asked her again about the watch and she
crumbled. (Imagine what the sight of one of the Williams sisters is
going to do to her).</TE>
<TE>   "I have a contract with Rolex to wear a watch when I play," she
admitted, and I was about to tell her she had just lied to everyone a
few minutes earlier, but, perturbed, she cut off an interview with
another Times reporter, made a face and walked out.</TE>
<TE>   A short time later one of the tournament's public relations
officials came to me and said, "Don't write that column."</TE>
<TE>   I found that amusing, of course, because if I agreed not to write
a column every time a public relations official or Dwyre told me not
to write a column, I'd never have a column in the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea you were one of those columnists," the official
said, "and you can quote me on that."</TE>
<TE>   Now I was really confused. First I'm told not to write a column,
and then I'm told to quote the official in the newspaper. I asked for
a clarification and the official began crying and then scurried from
the room.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THEY ADVERTISED that the top 16 women in tennis were going to be
here, but when the first match started, the announcer introduced
Elena Dementieva, "the 19th-ranked player in the world."</TE>
<TE>   I found this odd and asked a tournament official, who directed me
to Jeremy, who then sent me to Rob, who said he couldn't talk, but
Jim could. By that time I forgot what I wanted to ask.</TE>
<TE>   When the first match started, and then the second, I noticed both
of them had something in common: No one was here to watch the women
play. So I went to the front of Staples to see if the doors were
still locked, and ran into the guy who was selling programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Sold 10," he said, which makes him the best salesman I've ever
met because the programs didn't include a schedule of who was
playing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MOST OF the concession stands were closed, although they had
charged folks as much as $1,250 to attend all 10 sessions of this
tournament, but I guess everyone realized no one would bother to show
up to watch Henin play.</TE>
<TE>   I counted 87 fans on one side of the arena and 93 on the other
side and sat in section 116 so it could be said someone did. That
left sections 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 117, 118, 104 and
107 empty. I think I would have noticed the "Justine Henin Fan Club"
if it was there.</TE>
<TE>   Take the smallest imaginable Sparks' crowd, subtract several
thousand, and that's how many fans showed up for the evening session
to watch Lindsay Davenport collapse against Monica Seles. I'd provide
a more accurate count, but as of 10 p.m. officials were too
embarrassed to announce the attendance, saying the doors were still
open and somebody might walk in -- by accident.</TE>
<TE>   The Staples' folks have a seven-year commitment for this
tournament, which means if they want to draw a crowd, they better fix
it so Kournikova gets an invite the next six years.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a much prettier girl here than Kournikova," one official
said. "Daniela Hantuchova will be playing [this afternoon]."</TE>

<LD>Bugs Bunny in goal? Wile E. Coyote on the right wing? Tweety as
referee?</LD>
<LD>   The possibilities became almost endless Wednesday when UEFA,
European soccer's ruling body, named Warner Bros. as the exclusive
worldwide licensing agent for the 2004 European Championship in
Portugal.</LD>
<LD>   The American entertainment conglomerate, part of the AOL Time
Warner media group, will be in charge of all merchandising for the
quadrennial 16-nation event, which is second only to the World Cup in
significance.</LD>
<TE>   Warner Bros., through its consumer products division, will not
only have control of on-site retail sales but also will create the
tournament mascot.</TE>
<TE>   "Warner Bros. is a household name all over the world," said
Gilberto Madail, the Euro 2004 chairman. "The prestige of the
European Championship will become even greater with this new
venture."</TE>
<TE>   The European Championship will be played in nine Portuguese cities
from June 12 to July 4, 2004.</TE>
<TE>   MLS Waiver Draft</TE>
<TE>   Only three of the 26 players waived by Major League Soccer clubs
Tuesday were selected by other teams in the MLS waiver draft
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Former Galaxy defender Craig Waibel was selected by the San Jose
Earthquakes; former Southern Methodist University striker Luchi
Gonzalez, one of only eight players to win both the Hermann Trophy
and MAC Award as college player of the year, was chosen by the
Columbus Crew after being waived by the Earthquakes; and former
Chicago Fire defender Billy Sleeth was picked up by the Colorado
Rapids.</TE>
<TE>   Among the 23 players not selected were two former U.S. national
team players: goalkeeper Juergen Sommer and striker Roy Lassiter.</TE>
<TE>   Nicol Signs</TE>
<TE>   Steve Nicol was officially named coach of the New England
Revolution on Wednesday, agreeing to a two-year contract after
serving as interim coach for much of the 2002 MLS season and taking
the team to the title game before losing to the Galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   Former assistant coach Renato Capobianco, the husband of former
U.S. women's national team World Cup-winning goalkeeper Mary Harvey,
was named director of soccer by the Revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis Scores</TE>
<TE>   U.S. World Cup winger Eddie Lewis, a former UCLA player, created
the first goal and scored the second as Preston North End of the
English first division upset Birmingham City of the English Premier
League, 2-0, in the English League Cup Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   The upsets continued Wednesday night as Premier League clubs West
Ham United, Arsenal, Leeds United and Tottenham Hotspur all crashed
out of the competition.</TE>
<TE>   Galaxy Earns Tie</TE>
<TE>   Brian Mullan of the Galaxy scored in the 84th minute to force a
1-1 tie with Santos Laguna of Mexico's First Division in an
exhibition at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Rodrigio Ruiz scored an unassisted goal for Santos Laguna in the
61st minute.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy played without two starters from its victory in last
month's MLS Cup. Forward Carlos Ruiz, the league's most valuable
player and leading goal scorer, was excused to play with Guatemala's
national team.</TE>
<TE>   Galaxy midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos was given time off to attend
an English-language class he is taking to help bolster a future
coaching career.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina Changes</TE>
<TE>   Argentina, the 2002 World Cup favorite that was surprisingly
eliminated in the first round of Korea/Japan '02, will play its first
post-World Cup game Nov. 20 against Japan in Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Coach Marcelo Bielsa named a 20-man roster for the
match but did not select a single Argentine-based player.</TE>

<HD>Down, Never Out</HD>
<DH>Seles fights back from seven match points to break
nine-match losing streak to Davenport with 3-6, 7-6 (6), 6-3 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Dillman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Lindsay Davenport, routine turned random, and ultimately
ruthless, in a matter of minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Her spot in the quarterfinals of the Home Depot WTA Championships
was practically in front of her, in essence, there for the taking.
Not once, not twice and not three times ... but seven times.</LD>
<LD>   Davenport squandered seven match points in her first-round match
against Monica Seles on Wednesday night at Staples Center, as the
sixth-seeded Seles defeated Davenport, 3-6, 7-6 (6), 6-3, in two
hours eight minutes before an estimated 3,200. The match points all
came in the second set, one in the 10th game, two in the 12th game
and four more in the tiebreaker.</LD>
<TE>   "It was definitely a weird match, to say the least," Seles said.
"I toughed it out. I was running down a lot of shots and Lindsay got
frustrated."</TE>
<TE>   It was a significant breakthrough for Seles on many levels. Seles,
who will turn 29 in December, had not played a tournament since
losing in the semifinals at Bahia, Brazil, the week after the U.S.
Open and had to spend most of the year fending off annoying inquiries
about retirement. Seles had not defeated Davenport since 1997, in
three sets in the Manhattan Beach final. Davenport won nine straight
matches against Seles, dropping just two sets. She led their series,
9-2, before Wednesday's match.</TE>
<TE>   In the quarterfinals, Seles will face No. 2 Venus Williams, a 6-2,
7-6 (7) winner over Patty Schnyder of Switzerland in the final match
of Wednesday's evening session.</TE>
<TE>   Almost more than anyone else, Seles wanted to be here. She dearly
wanted to play in these Championships at least one more time before
she retired and that prospect seemed doubtful when the event moved
from New York to Munich, Germany, last year.</TE>
<TE>   Seles has not played any events there since she was stabbed in
Hamburg in 1993. So she was delighted when officials decided to move
the season-ending tournament to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Seles said on Wednesday that when she played Martina Hingis --
losing in three sets -- in the final of the 2000 Championships in New
York that she thought it was her last time in the event. After having
gone through that process, returning, and winning, made it much more
gratifying.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport, who lives a short car ride away in Laguna Beach, had
been pleased by the move of the tournament, too. At least until the
second set.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed as though it was going to be a run-of-the-mill victory,
as Davenport took the first set, 6-3, and led, 3-0, in the second.
Seles kept scrambling and broke Davenport's serve in the fifth game
of the second. But once Davenport starting piling up the match
points, it seemed inconceivable that Seles could fight her way out of
it especially since she had been idle since September.</TE>
<TE>   On the first three match points, Davenport netted a backhand
return, netted a backhand on an approach shot by Seles and netted
another forehand. In the tiebreaker, Davenport established a
commanding 6-2 lead, but Seles stormed back, saving four more match
points with sharp forehand winners on two of them. By then,
Davenport's negative body language showed it was slipping away. At
6-6, Davenport hit a backhand long and Seles won it on her first set
point when Davenport netted a forehand volley.</TE>
<TE>   In the third, the decisive break came in the eighth game. Seles
broke Davenport at love to take a 5-3 lead. Energized, Seles finished
strongly and served out the match at love. She needed one match point
to do it, securing the victory when Davenport hit a backhand in the
net.</TE>
<TE>   "It kept snowballing on me," Davenport said. "There's no question
she plays well when she's down and steps it up a level and at the
same time I didn't."</TE>
<TE>   They shared a warm moment at the net, and this particular match-up
is never an easy one for either. Seles and Davenport are close
friends, have been on several Fed Cup teams together and even have
the same agent. But Seles has a way of saving match points when she
plays tournaments in Southern California. She fought off six of them
in the quarterfinals at Manhattan Beach against Serena Williams in
the quarterfinals last year and won it.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think you have to go for your shots at that stage," she
said. "[There's] a little bit of luck.... I was having a hard time
not playing for the last two months. I was having problems on the
return. It was a very up-and-down match on both sides."</TE>

<HD>Henin Vows to Remain True to Her Tennis Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lauren Peterson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If No. 4-seeded Justine Henin of Belgium wins the Home Depot WTA
Championships, it will be only one highlight for her this month.</LD>
<LD>   Henin, 20, who opened the tournament with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over
Elena Dementieva of Russia on Wednesday, plans to marry her fiance of
two years, Pierre-Yves Hardenne, in Belgium on Nov. 16.</LD>
<LD>   "It's all set. My agent and my family took care of everything,"
she said. "When I'm out on the court, I'm not thinking about my
wedding at all. I'm just focused on my match."</LD>
<TE>   To win the championships, Henin will have to get past fellow
Belgian Kim Clijsters, the fifth-seeded player who rolled past
American Chanda Rubin, 6-1, 6-2, in another first-round match.</TE>
<TE>   The pair have gone head-to-head three times this year, with
Clijsters winning twice. They have split eight meetings since 1998,
with Clijsters winning in the semifinals of the 2001 French Open and
in the quarterfinals of this year's Australian Open.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always a little special," Henin said. "I mean, it's a
different match for us than to play another player. But we have to
deal with that because we will have to play many times in the
future."</TE>
<TE>   The future is now. Henin and Clijsters will meet in the
quarterfinals Friday or Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's great for Belgium to have both," Clijsters said.
"But I don't really focus on the player in front of me. I know I have
to stay focused to win."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A 57-minute rout by Clijsters wasn't the sort of ending Rubin had
in mind for a season that was otherwise triumphant.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely been a fairly good year coming into this
tournament," she said. "I only had half a year of tournaments, so it
was great for me to be here and have a shot out there today. I'm just
disappointed I didn't take better advantage of it."</TE>
<TE>   Rubin had surgery on her left knee in 2001 and again in January,
missing the Australian Open.</TE>
<TE>   She returned in May and won nine matches in Grand Slam events, and
won tournaments in Eastbourne and Manhattan Beach.</TE>
<TE>   In August, she defeated No. 1 Serena Williams, 6-2, 4-6, 7-5 --
the only player to do so since May -- in the quarterfinals of the
Manhattan Beach event, where she also beat Lindsay Davenport in a
three-set title match.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, it's been a good year," Rubin said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The crowds for the tournament's first appearance at Staples Center
were sparse. Tournament officials would not release an attendance
figure for the day session but said 6,247 tickets were sold for the
two sessions. They said about 3,200 attended the night matches.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew going into it that our Wednesday day, Thursday day and
Friday days were going to be slow," said tournament director John
Arrix, who attributed the light turnout to fans' school and work
commitments. "This is very typical for a day session of an indoor
tournament during the week."</TE>

<LD>If only the performance of identical twins was as symmetrical as
their looks.</LD>
<LD>   Then Mat Ball would have 10 sacks from left defensive end to match
Dave Ball's 10 sacks from right defensive end.</LD>
<LD>   But Mat has only one sack, and he admits the disparity bothers
him. Dave, however, knows the feeling. After all, Dave was cut from a
youth soccer team, not Mat. And Dave watched Mat star on their high
school basketball team.</LD>
<TE>   Coaches, however, believe both Balls will be rolling soon.</TE>
<TE>   "They have similar skills and Mat might end up better than Dave,"
defensive line coach Don Johnson said. "He chased down [Washington
quarterback] Cody Pickett from all the way across the field last week
and didn't get a sack because it was a one-yard gain."</TE>
<TE>   Mat played linebacker last season and is re-learning end as a
backup to senior Rusty Williams. Next season the Balls could be
senior bookend starters. And they could be equally devastating, like
two rooks on a chess board.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what I want to see," Dave said. "Mat and I making life
miserable for quarterbacks together."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Marcedes Lewis came to UCLA from Long Beach Poly High highly
celebrated. Coaches marveled at his athleticism, versatility and
maturity. All those qualities are still present, he just hasn't had
much opportunity to exhibit them.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, 6 feet 7, is used sparingly as a tight end and wide
receiver. He has run several fade routes in the end zone designed to
take advantage of his height but has yet to make the catch.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis has appeared in all nine games, but has only four catches
for 23 yards. His longest reception, of eight yards, came on a fake
field goal.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in Coach [Bob] Toledo," Lewis said. "I trust what he's
been doing with me. I'll develop into the all-around tight end I know
I can become."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arizona redshirt freshman quarterback Nic Costa is expected to get
extended playing time in place of senior Jason Johnson, who needs 88
yards to become Arizona's single-season passing leader.</TE>
<TE>   Costa, considered the Wildcat quarterback of the future, played
the fourth quarter of last week's 38-3 loss to Oregon State and in
three appearances has completed five of 15 passes for 46 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we need to stick [Costa] in the game for a series here
and there," Coach John Mackovic said. "The biggest thing is how he
conducts himself, and can he make some plays. The quarterback,
ultimately, has to be able to make some plays."</TE>
<TE>   Costa is more mobile than Johnson, who has been sacked 18 times in
the last three games. Johnson is not happy with sharing the job.</TE>
<TE>   "As a senior who has fought my heart out all season long, I feel
that I should be out there every play," he said. "But I respect Coach
Mackovic's decisions and understand we have to look to the future."</TE>

<HD>Trojans Step Up in Weight Class to Prepare for Stanford</HD>

<LD>USC's defense continued to prepare Wednesday for a Stanford rushing
attack that ranks third in the Pacific 10 Conference at 149.4 yards a
game.</LD>
<LD>   The Cardinal features 6-foot-2, 235-pound running back Kerry
Carter, who scored four touchdowns against the Trojans last season,
and 6-2, 250-pound fullback Casey Moore.</LD>
<LD>   To simulate the running style of the burly backs, Trojan freshman
Brandon Hancock and redshirt sophomore Lee Webb were moved down to
the scout team this week.</LD>
<TE>   Hancock is 6-1, 235 pounds, Webb, 5-11, 240. Middle linebacker
Mike Pollard described the two as punishing stand-ins.</TE>
<TE>   "Both of those guys are physical and pretty fast," Pollard said.
"They bring it."</TE>
<TE>   Fullbacks Malaefou MacKenzie, Chad Pierson and Sunny Byrd are in
their final years of eligibility, so Hancock and Webb will compete
for a starting position next season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to have the ball in my hands -- it reminds me of high
school," said Hancock, who gained 1,280 yards last year at Fresno
Clovis West High, but has only three carries for eight yards this
season. "To go against the [first-string defense] play after play
after play is great experience."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's game marks the third time this season that USC is the
visiting opponent for homecoming.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans almost ruined Washington State's festivities before
losing in overtime, and spoiled Oregon's celebration by routing the
Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   USC has lost to Stanford three times in a row and last won in Palo
Alto in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "They might have scheduled us for homecoming because of the
previous games, but we're a whole different team," sophomore
defensive end Kenechi Udeze said. "If they think it's going to be a
cakewalk, they're going to have some problems."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman punter Tom Malone leads the Pac-10 and ranks 17th in the
nation with an average of 42.6 yards per kick.</TE>
<TE>   Malone said his poor performance in a Sept. 21 loss at Kansas
State motivated him to "not let anything like that happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Malone averaged 40 yards for three punts against Oregon on Oct.
26.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no substitute for game experience, and the last couple
of weeks I've felt a lot more comfortable," Malone said. "I'm sure
there's things that can happen that you don't even think of, but for
the most part, I think I've been in pretty much every situation."</TE>

<CX>   College football -- Saturday's USC-Stanford game was not the
homecoming game for Stanford, as reported in a Sports story Thursday.
The same story also reported that Stanford quarterback Kerry Carter
had scored four touchdowns against the Trojans last season. Carter
scored those touchdowns two seasons ago when Stanford defeated USC,
32-30.</CX>

<HD>Two Transfers to Westchester Are Ineligible</HD>
<DH>Panel rules Pruitt, Reese gave false information when
switching schools. They are suspended from competition for one year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two top high school basketball players have been suspended from
competition for one year because they provided false information in
transferring to Westchester High, a City Section rules committee
determined.</LD>
<LD>   Gabriel Pruitt, a junior guard who transferred from Compton
Centennial, and Ray Reese, a sophomore forward who transferred from
Carson, were declared ineligible. The announcement was made Wednesday
by City Section Commissioner Barbara Fiege, one day after the
committee voted 7-0 (with one abstention) for the suspensions.</LD>
<LD>   Westchester was not sanctioned, but Fiege said punitive action
against the school and its basketball program might be discussed at a
rules committee meeting Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Wednesday's action was taken because a panel, specially convened
to investigate allegations brought against Westchester, found that
Pruitt and Reese had violated a rule in which a parent, guardian or
student cannot provide false information regarding any aspect of a
player's eligibility status, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Carson officials said Reese did not live at the address he
provided after leaving his former school.</TE>
<TE>   "I had faith in the system," Carson assistant principal Rosie
Martinez said. "I would be surprised if we didn't get the ruling."</TE>
<TE>   Allegations by Carson officials that Westchester Athletic Director
Brian Henderson used undue influence and assistant coach Marlon
Morton recruited Reese were not cited by the committee as reasons for
Reese's ineligibility.</TE>
<TE>   The players could challenge the ruling before a section appeals
committee. Basketball practice for City schools begins Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Yopp, an attorney for Reese, said there was "some bumbling
of the paperwork at Westchester."</TE>
<TE>   "Once the paperwork issues are straightened out, we are confident
that Ray will be eligible," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Pruitt's attorney declined comment. Pruitt initially lived in the
Manual Arts district, but apparently used his only allowable
inter-district transfer to go to Centennial, in the Compton Unified
School District.</TE>
<TE>   Westchester Coach Ed Azzam said he turns away dozens of transfers
every year. Accepting transfers is difficult, he said, because of
"this nonsense we have to go through."</TE>
<TE>   "I told [Henderson], 'No more transfers,' " Azzam said. "It's a
pain. It's very frustrating."</TE>
<TE>   The school was placed on probation for one year in 2000 because
former guard Hassan Adams, star of the Comets' state-champion team
last season, played for Westchester in a summer tournament while
still officially enrolled at Verbum Dei.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the Narbonne girls' basketball team was banned from the
playoffs for one year because three standout players, all reportedly
from the same summer traveling team, used phony home addresses to
gain admittance.</TE>
<TE>   The Gauchos were also stripped of state and City Section titles
won earlier that year.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, the Van Nuys girls' volleyball team was banned from
postseason play for two years because a star player had fabricated
her address.</TE>

<TE>Key to Election Tables</TE>
<TE>   An asterisk (*) denotes an incumbent candidate; a double asterisk
(**) denotes an appointed incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   Elected candidates and approved measures -- or those leading with
99% of precincts reporting -- are in bold type. Results are not
official and could be affected by absentee ballots. The secretary of
state's office said Wednesday that roughly 500,000 absentee ballots
statewide were still being counted.</TE>
<TE>   Percentages may not add up to 100 because of rounding.</TE>
<TE>   District locations are identified by county. In Los Angeles,
Orange and Ventura counties, they are identified by community.</TE>
<TE>   Uncontested local offices and write-in candidates are not included
in the tables.</TE>

<TE>   Key to Election Tables</TE>
<TE>   An asterisk (*) denotes an incumbent candidate; a double asterisk
(**) denotes an appointed incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   Elected candidates and approved measures -- or those leading with
99% of precincts reporting -- are in bold type. Results are not
official and could be affected by absentee ballots. The secretary of
state's office said Wednesday that roughly 500,000 absentee ballots
statewide were still being counted.</TE>
<TE>   Percentages may not add up to 100 because of rounding.</TE>
<TE>   District locations are identified by county. In Los Angeles,
Orange and Ventura counties, they are identified by community.</TE>
<TE>   Uncontested local offices and write-in candidates are not included
in the tables.</TE>

<TE>Key to Election Tables</TE>
<TE>   An asterisk (*) denotes an incumbent candidate; a double asterisk
(**) denotes an appointed incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   Elected candidates and approved measures -- or those leading with
99% of precincts reporting -- are in bold type. Results are not
official and could be affected by absentee ballots. The secretary of
state's office said Wednesday that roughly 500,000 absentee ballots
statewide were still being counted.</TE>
<TE>   Percentages may not add up to 100 because of rounding.</TE>
<TE>   District locations are identified by county. In Los Angeles,
Orange and Ventura counties, they are identified by community.</TE>
<TE>   Uncontested local offices and write-in candidates are not included
in the tables.</TE>

<LD>A veteran police officer who supervises Anaheim's Explorer program
was charged with having a sexual encounter with a 17-year-old
recruit, authorities said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Jason David Rosewarne, 31, of Corona was ordered by the district
attorney's office to appear for arraignment at West Orange County
Superior Court in Westminster on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   He was charged Oct. 25 with one felony count of oral copulation
with a minor, said Susan Schroeder, spokeswoman for the district
attorney's office.</LD>
<TE>   If convicted, he faces up to three years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Rosewarne had been with the Anaheim Police Department for seven
years, serving first as a dispatcher, then as a patrolman, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   He and the girl, who was not identified because of her age, were
at an Explorer social outing Aug. 22 when the incident occurred,
Schroeder said.</TE>
<TE>   Rosewarne was placed on administrative leave. Anaheim police are
conducting an internal investigation, said Sgt. Mike Hidalgo.</TE>
<TE>   Rosewarne was the advisor to the department's Explorer program for
six months, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   He oversaw about 50 recruits who volunteer to assist at the scenes
of fires, fingerprint children, direct traffic and search for missing
people.</TE>
<TE>   The program is designed for students ages 14 to 21.</TE>

<TE>Key to Election Tables</TE>
<TE>   An asterisk (*) denotes an incumbent candidate; a double asterisk
(**) denotes an appointed incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   Elected candidates and approved measures -- or those leading with
99% of precincts reporting -- are in bold type. Results are not
official and could be affected by absentee ballots. The secretary of
state's office said Wednesday that roughly 500,000 absentee ballots
statewide were still being counted.</TE>
<TE>   Percentages may not add up to 100 because of rounding.</TE>
<TE>   District locations are identified by county. In Los Angeles,
Orange and Ventura counties, they are identified by community.</TE>
<TE>   Uncontested local offices and write-in candidates are not included
in the tables.</TE>

<TE>   An asterisk (*) denotes an incumbent candidate; a double asterisk
(**) denotes an appointed incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   Elected candidates and approved measures -- or those leading with
99% of precincts reporting -- are in bold type. Results are not
official and could be affected by absentee ballots. The secretary of
state's office said Wednesday that roughly 500,000 absentee ballots
statewide were still being counted.</TE>
<TE>   Percentages may not add up to 100 because of rounding.</TE>
<TE>   District locations are identified by county. In Los Angeles,
Orange and Ventura counties, they are identified by community.</TE>
<TE>   Uncontested local offices and write-in candidates are not included
in the tables.</TE>

<TE>   An asterisk (*) denotes an incumbent candidate; a double asterisk
(**) denotes an appointed incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   Elected candidates and approved measures -- or those leading with
99% of precincts reporting -- are in bold type. Results are not
official and could be affected by absentee ballots. The secretary of
state's office said Wednesday that roughly 500,000 absentee ballots
statewide were still being counted.</TE>
<TE>   Percentages may not add up to 100 because of rounding.</TE>
<TE>   District locations are identified by county. In Los Angeles,
Orange and Ventura counties, they are identified by community.</TE>
<TE>   Uncontested local offices and write-in candidates are not included
in the tables.</TE>

<TE>   An asterisk (*) denotes an incumbent candidate; a double asterisk
(**) denotes an appointed incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   Elected candidates and approved measures -- or those leading with
99% of precincts reporting -- are in bold type. Results are not
official and could be affected by absentee ballots. The secretary of
state's office said Wednesday that roughly 500,000 absentee ballots
statewide were still being counted.</TE>
<TE>   Percentages may not add up to 100 because of rounding.</TE>
<TE>   District locations are identified by county. In Los Angeles,
Orange and Ventura counties, they are identified by community.</TE>
<TE>   Uncontested local offices and write-in candidates are not included
in the tables.</TE>

<TE>Key to Election Tables</TE>
<TE>   An asterisk (*) denotes an incumbent candidate; a double asterisk
(**) denotes an appointed incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   Elected candidates and approved measures -- or those leading with
99% of precincts reporting -- are in bold type. Results are not
official and could be affected by absentee ballots. The secretary of
state's office said Wednesday that roughly 500,000 absentee ballots
statewide were still being counted.</TE>
<TE>   Percentages may not add up to 100 because of rounding.</TE>
<TE>   District locations are identified by county. In Los Angeles,
Orange and Ventura counties, they are identified by community.</TE>
<TE>   Uncontested local offices and write-in candidates are not included
in the tables.</TE>

<TE>   Key to Election Tables</TE>
<TE>   An asterisk (*) denotes an incumbent candidate; a double asterisk
(**) denotes an appointed incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   Elected candidates and approved measures -- or those leading with
99% of precincts reporting -- are in bold type. Results are not
official and could be affected by absentee ballots. The secretary of
state's office said Wednesday that roughly 500,000 absentee ballots
statewide were still being counted.</TE>
<TE>   Percentages may not add up to 100 because of rounding.</TE>
<TE>   District locations are identified by county. In Los Angeles,
Orange and Ventura counties, they are identified by community.</TE>
<TE>   Uncontested local offices and write-in candidates are not included
in the tables.</TE>

<HD>Secessionists Weigh Options</HD>
<DH>After defeat at the polls, Valley cityhood leaders consider
strategies and take heart in local win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sue Fox and Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hours after their hopes of forging a separate city from Los Angeles
died at the polls, San Fernando Valley secessionists grasped onto a
silver lining Wednesday in the slender margin of yes votes cast by
Valley voters.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles voters rejected both Valley and Hollywood breakup
proposals by resounding margins in Tuesday's election. But in the
Valley, the secession movement's birthplace and enduring stronghold,
voters were almost evenly split.</LD>
<LD>   With all precincts reporting, the secession proposal was hugging a
narrow lead -- 50.77% to 49.23% -- in the Valley. The difference is
3,760 votes, according to the Los Angeles County registrar-recorder.</LD>
<TE>   About 31,500 absentee and provisional ballots from the Valley
remain to be counted. To alter the Valley outcome, about 56% of the
outstanding ballots would have to go against secession.</TE>
<TE>   The breakup plan carried the Valley in Tuesday's returns even
though it lost in three of the region's five council districts -- the
2nd, 6th and 7th, all in the East Valley, according to a breakdown
released by the county. The vote totals against secession in the
three districts ranged from 53.7% to 57.6%</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders had predicted they would get broad support in
the East Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The strongest opposition to secession was in South-Central Los
Angeles. In the 8th Council District there, 89.8% of voters cast
ballots against secession. More than 82% of the voters in the two
East Los Angeles council districts also opposed secession.</TE>
<TE>   Valley secession leader Jeff Brain said he was not surprised by
those results because unions and council members focused heavily on
persuading Latino and African American voters there to oppose the
breakup.</TE>
<TE>   "Without money to educate people there, what they said stuck,"
Brain said.</TE>
<TE>   Secession did best in the West Valley, the birthplace of the
movement.</TE>
<TE>   In the northwest Valley's 12th Council District, which includes
Northridge, Granada Hills and Chatsworth, 61% of voters supported
secession, the largest percentage citywide. Hal Bernson represents
the district.</TE>
<TE>   The southwest Valley's 3rd District, represented by Dennis Zine,
posted the second-highest return for secession -- 56.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the council districts that include San Pedro, which is
also proposing secession, and Hollywood voted against the breakup.</TE>
<TE>   The win in the Valley is a hollow victory at best: Under
California law, secessions must pass citywide. But the split decision
somewhat strengthens the political hand of separatists who have long
argued that City Hall neglects the Valley while sponging up its tax
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   As the day after the election dawned clear and sunny over the
Valley, secession leaders hailed the Valley vote as evidence that
their grass-roots campaign -- or at least, its central goal of
siphoning power away from City Hall -- was still alive.</TE>
<TE>   "We were outspent, outgunned, outnumbered," said Laurette Healey,
a co-chair of the San Fernando Valley Independence Committee. "We
came to the people with a simple truth, the truth of bringing
government closer to the people who live here.... The idea of local
control will resonate for a very, very long time."</TE>
<TE>   In a sign that City Hall is absorbing the message, Council
President Alex Padilla and other Valley council members plan to meet
today with secession leaders to explore ways to devolve power across
the city's far-flung neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Looking bleary-eyed but cheerful, a cluster of Valley
secessionists returned Wednesday morning to the same Sherman Oaks
hotel where they had watched their dream of a new city die the night
before.</TE>
<TE>   Flanked by several of the would-be council members elected to
represent the Valley had cityhood passed, leaders of the six-year
breakaway movement vowed to keep up the pressure for local control.</TE>
<TE>   "This is more than a government in exile," said secession leader
Richard Katz. "Given the unprecedented nature of the opposition we
faced, the victory in the Valley is significant.... The burden now
shifts to the city. We have made our case for reform."</TE>
<TE>   Voter turnout in the Valley was higher than in other parts of Los
Angeles, but not by much. Citywide, 38.6% of voters cast ballots
Tuesday, while in the Valley the figure was 43.5%. The Valley
typically has a higher turnout than the rest of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn and other breakup opponents spent $7 million
to squash secession in its own backyard. Separatists took comfort in
their slim Valley victory, saying that the Valley's demand for more
efficient, responsive government could not be denied.</TE>
<TE>   What remains to be seen, breakup proponents said, is just what
shape new reform efforts may take. A borough system, neighborhood
councils with enhanced power, or another secession movement were all
mentioned as possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Close, chairman of the secession group Valley VOTE, said
cityhood advocates were still exploring their options.</TE>
<TE>   Close had previously threatened a lawsuit challenging the
constitutionality of the state's rule that municipal breakups be put
to a citywide vote, but on Wednesday, secession leaders said they
were considering a broad range of possible next steps.</TE>
<TE>   Other options, Close said, include trying to revise the state law
to allow only Valley voters to decide whether to form a new city or
sponsoring a statewide ballot initiative to liberate the Valley from
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, the millionaire nightclub owner who was the driving
force behind that cityhood effort made it clear he was throwing in
the towel.</TE>
<TE>   Gene La Pietra, who spent $2.5 million on the secession campaign,
canceled a post-election news conference, saying he needed to pick up
his niece at school. But he, too, characterized the losing effort as
"a victory" of sorts, saying it drew attention to Hollywood's
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Several political observers said that the struggling secession
movement's best days may be behind it.</TE>
<TE>   Citywide, voters snubbed Valley cityhood by a huge margin, about
67% to 33%. The Hollywood independence measure was even less popular,
with 71% of voters opposing it.</TE>
<TE>   "It really wasn't much of a mandate, even if it wins in the
Valley," said Parke Skelton, a political strategist who helped guide
anti-secession efforts for the County Federation of Labor. "I think
people will be able to avoid taking any real dramatic steps to
restructure city government."</TE>
<TE>   The shifting demographics of the Valley, which is tilting more
Latino and Democratic, may also put a damper on future breakup
efforts, political experts said. Valley cityhood claims its strongest
base of support among what could be called the Valley's old guard:
white, affluent, Republican men.</TE>
<TE>   "It's possible that secession will never get onto the ballot
again," said Bruce Cain, director of the Institute of Governmental
Studies at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Cain said that the breakup plan's doom was sealed when state Sen.
Richard Alarcon, a Sylmar Democrat sympathetic to Valley cityhood,
decided not to run for Valley mayor and started campaigning against
secession.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me when Alarcon pulled out and the inner-city Latino
community mobilized against this, a lot of the air went out of the
balloon," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But the issue won't die if the issue is whether the San Fernando
Valley gets equal treatment in terms of services or representation or
respect," he continued. " ... In one way or another, the city's going
to have to address it, whether it's with boroughs or some other way
of decentralizing government."</TE>
<TE>   David Fleming, a prominent Valley lawyer and secession backer,
said that boroughs deserve a closer look. Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg
(D-Sherman Oaks) floated a borough proposal several months ago as an
alternative to secession, but the City Council declined to put it on
the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, Fleming said, Hahn ignores the Valley's
dissatisfaction at his own peril.</TE>
<TE>   "Half the Valley stood up last night and said, 'We don't want to
be part of your city anymore.' That's got to scare any incumbent,"
Fleming said. "Jim Hahn's got a lot of fences to mend."</TE>

<CX>   Valley secession -- A map in the Thursday California section showing
the vote on San Fernando Valley secession incorrectly used a
calculation based on the total ballots cast in each precinct, rather
than ballots cast on the secession measure. The overall pattern shown
on the published map is correct, but in a few parts of the East
Valley and the Westside, the calculation error resulted in precincts
being placed in the wrong category. A corrected map can be viewed on
the Times' Web site at http://www.latimes.com/secession.</CX>

<HD>Will 'Terminator' Be Back ... in Politics?</HD>

<LD>Workers readied the Boyle Heights gym for the Tuesday night victory
party celebrating the passage of Proposition 49, the initiative for
after-school programs. They flanked the stage with giant cutouts of
Arnold Schwarzenegger hoisting two children in his arms.</LD>
<LD>   A giant TV screen was tuned to the news when footage appeared of
Schwarzenegger at his Pacific Palisades polling place.</LD>
<LD>   "Arnold, you were just on the TV!" someone called.</LD>
<TE>   The former bodybuilder turned movie star looked over.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know how many times I've seen myself on a big screen,
guys? What's the matter with you?" he boomed back to laughter in the
gym of the Hollenbeck Youth Center.</TE>
<TE>   After 34 years in this country, he still has his Austrian accent,
although now it's less the mark of the immigrant and more the
trademark of the Terminator. At 55, Schwarzenegger is possessed of a
razor-sharp square jaw and jutting cheekbones -- none of it from
plastic surgery or cosmetic tinkering, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But throughout election day, ever mindful of the TV cameras,
Schwarzenegger's personal makeup artist was on hand for touch-ups.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his denials, Schwarzenegger couldn't help but look like
someone trying out for the role of rising political star.</TE>
<TE>   In the boxing ring of the youth center, Schwarzenegger verbally
sparred with a succession of TV reporters. The first flurry of
questions were about Proposition 49, the initiative that
Schwarzenegger championed for more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Children are our future ... we have to take care of our kids
because if we don't, they end up going to prison and that costs the
state more," he said in accented sound bites.</TE>
<TE>   What reporters really wanted to know was this: Will the now
wealthy star and businessman -- who is fond of saying that he could
only achieve this success in America -- use the success of
Proposition 49 to launch his own political career?</TE>
<TE>   "Some people will say this is your ramping up for the governor's
mansion," one reporter said.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold ducked effortlessly. "Well, if you could find the
governor's mansion, I'd say 'Maybe,' but there is no mansion," he
said with a laugh, referring to Gov. Gray Davis' ranch-style house in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he said, "my wife would kill me if I took her there." He
laughed as if letting the reporter -- and onlookers -- in on a
private joke. He's been married 16 years to Maria Shriver, the NBC
news correspondent and Kennedy family member.</TE>
<TE>   As he deflected inquiries about his political ambitions,
Schwarzenegger appeared every inch the charismatic candidate that
California Republicans could use. He especially looked like a
political candidate when he was denying that he was a political
candidate.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, I want to be the leader of this movement,"
Schwarzenegger said of the measure, which will pay for after-school
education and recreational activities for elementary- and
middle-school children in California.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger hinted last year at his political ambitions, saying
that he first called friends about running for governor.</TE>
<TE>   "It was immediately brought to my attention that I could win," he
said. "It was immediately brought to my attention there was a huge
void in the Republican Party. It was a tremendous, enthusiastic
reaction. But that does not mean I was going to jump at it."</TE>
<TE>   He said he declined to pursue the idea because of conflicts with
his day job. "I found out I couldn't get out of my obligations. It
was so tied to foreign rights and toys and -- they would have had to
sue me because they would have been sued. You would have seen the ad:
'If Arnold's best friend and producer could not trust him to do
'Terminator 3,' how could we trust him with the fifth-largest
economy?' You don't want to start a campaign with that."</TE>
<TE>   "Terminator 3" opens next summer. So what about down the road?</TE>
<TE>   "Could be ...." he said before steering the conversation back to
Proposition 49. He would only reveal his plans to spend Wednesday
celebrating his wife's 47th birthday. "I have a whole bunch of
different gifts -- like a saddle for her horse," he said. "And
clothes -- I buy most of her clothes. I know exactly what looks good
on her."</TE>
<TE>Schwarzenegger, the father of four children, is not just a Hollywood
shill for after-school programs. For more than a decade, he's worked
with Danny Hernandez, the president of the Hollenbeck Youth Center.
He donated the weights in the weight room and helped set up a
computer room. The actor also expanded the local Inner-City Games,
conceived by Hernandez, into a national program.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a local hero here," said Los Angeles City Councilman Nick
Pacheco at the Proposition 49 victory party.</TE>
<TE>Schwarzenegger said he was deeply involved in the campaign. "When I
was on the 'Terminator' set in Los Angeles, as soon as I was finished
with my shooting, I would go to my trailer and do fund-raising
calls."</TE>
<TE>   He put up $1 million of his own money for the $10-million
initiative campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger's election day started early, with reporters
trailing him and Shriver as the couple voted.</TE>
<TE>   "Good morning!" Schwarzenegger called to election workers. "Ready
for the action?"</TE>
<TE>   "Nine cameras," whispered George Gorton, delighted by the media
entourage. Gorton, the Proposition 49 campaign manager, was a top
campaign aide to former Gov. Pete Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger didn't charm everyone at the polling place.</TE>
<TE>   "He's pompous -- and has a terrible hair dye job," said Sara
Nichols, a 55-year-old election volunteer. "They treat him like God
and all he does is make these violent movies. How does he reconcile
all his support for children with making his fame and fortune on
violent movies children shouldn't see?"</TE>
<TE>   More than 12 hours later, Schwarzenegger climbed to the stage at
the Hollenbeck center. Behind him were two dozen children who had
waited hours to stand with him as he gave his speech about 11 p.m. He
introduced his in-laws, Eunice and Sargent Shriver. And then he
thanked his wife for taking care of their children's after-school
activities.</TE>
<TE>   He finished off his speech with his trademark "I'll be back!" from
the Terminator movies.</TE>
<TE>   Balloons and confetti fell on the crowd, and the children ran
around the room in a frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   As the gym emptied, Hernandez, standing on the floor, glanced up
at the windows on the second floor that look down on the gym. He saw
Schwarzenegger.</TE>
<TE>   The movie star grinned at him and flexed his biceps.</TE>

<HD>Police Union, Chief Agree to Overhaul Complaint Process</HD>
<DH>The accord, which must be approved by Police Commission,
scraps controversial system imposed by Bernard C. Parks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Winton and Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles police union and Chief William J. Bratton announced
Wednesday that they have agreed to overhaul the police complaint
system that has been the subject of controversy and consternation
among police officers for years.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement, which will become official with a special order
from Bratton, calls for a new system designed to address minor
complaints quickly while ensuring that they are properly tracked and
dealt with, say union and LAPD officials.</LD>
<LD>   The policy adopts changes proposed by the Los Angeles Police
Commission and Mayor James K. Hahn's office in June. It requires the
commission's final approval.</LD>
<TE>   The agreement allows complaints that supervisors deem minor to be
addressed through dispute resolution rather than formal
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a positive step," said Cmdr. Jim McDonnell, who is heading
Bratton's transition team. "It allows for a more reasonable
[discipline] standard without compromising accountability, and it
sends a positive message to both the officers and the community."</TE>
<TE>   Instituted in 1998 by Chief Bernard C. Parks, the department's
complaint process has drawn criticism from rank-and-file officers and
union officials, who have charged that the disciplinary system
seriously damaged morale by treating frivolous claims on a par with
corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials cited several instances, including investigations
of a desk officer who told a woman who complained that laser beams
were piercing her brain to turn them off.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new system, LAPD officials can apply their judgment to
such cases, steering them into mediation rather than a formal
investigation and possible board of rights hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the old system, a serious allegation of racism, brutality
or discrimination was handled the same way as a minor allegation such
as an officer's speaking in the wrong tone of voice or [with an]
attitude," said union general counsel Hank Hernandez.</TE>
<TE>   "With the new process, minor complaints are dealt with in a
nondisciplinary form," Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   Those complaints would be formalized and tracked, Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   It also allows the person filing a complaint to discuss it with
the officer face to face in the presence of a mediator.</TE>
<TE>   The reform process began during the tenure of interim Chief Martin
Pomeroy.</TE>
<TE>   The acting chief, who replaced Parks in April, began dealing with
a backlog of disciplinary complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday agreed to
lift a hiring freeze on top positions within the LAPD, clearing the
way for Bratton to begin appointing his own management team.</TE>
<TE>   The motion allows Bratton to appoint an assistant chief, two
deputy chiefs, two commanders, six captains and several civilian
police administrators.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton is seeking to replace Assistant Chief David Gascon, who
retired last week, and to fill several impending vacancies. Assistant
Chief J.I. Davis and Deputy Chief Willie Pannell are expected to
retire at the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're giving to the chief of police the opportunity to select
those people who are going to put together the task of revitalizing
the Los Angeles Police Department," said Councilman Tom LaBonge. But
Councilman Nate Holden, who voted against the motion, said it gives
Bratton the power to drive out those who ran the department under
Parks and would hurt officers' morale.</TE>
<TE>   "These are loyal, dedicated police officers ... who have been
working for this department for many, many years," he said. Other
council members said the intent was not to force anyone out.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no one being asked to leave by this motion," said
Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski.</TE>
<TE>   "All we're doing is giving latitude to the chief to look at this
command staff and make some appointments," she said.</TE>
<TE>   McDonnell said all the positions are either open or will be with
planned retirements.</TE>

<KH>ELECTION 2002</KH>
<HD>Council Winners, With No City to Lead, Look to Reforms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kristina Sauerwein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With election night circles under their eyes, the winners of the San
Fernando Valley mayoral and city council races stumbled out of bed
for a Wednesday morning news conference, raised their hands locked in
victory and vowed to reform local government.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is that the offices the candidates won don't exist.</LD>
<LD>   It was a risk Valley and Hollywood candidates accepted when they
campaigned to lead imagined cities that failed to materialize when
voters rejected the two secession measures on Tuesday's ballot.</LD>
<TE>   In the Valley, the top vote-getters for the mayoral and 14 council
seats saw their hopes of taking the oath evaporate, even though
slightly more than half the voters in the proposed city supported the
breakaway bid.</TE>
<TE>   Secession in both areas required a citywide majority to carry.</TE>
<TE>   "This morning I got a call from a council member in West
Hollywood, and he called me 'councilman,' " said Scott Svonkin, one
of about a dozen candidates at the news conference at the Radisson
Hotel in Sherman Oaks. "But technically, I'm not."</TE>
<TE>   Nor is Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge) the mayor of the
proposed Valley city, though he soundly defeated nine contenders for
the post. On Wednesday, secessionists were calling Richman "Mr.
Mayor."</TE>
<TE>   "I ran to make a difference," Richman said after the news
conference. "The status quo is not OK."</TE>
<TE>   Richman, who was reelected Tuesday to his 38th District Assembly
seat, said that over the next few days he plans to discuss the
Valley's needs with Los Angeles City Council members and the
candidates who would have represented a new city.</TE>
<TE>   He would also like to sit down with his almost-counterpart, Mayor
James K. Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed [secession] failed," said Richman, who raised
$200,000 for his mayoral campaign. "But this is an occasion where a
majority of the people in the Valley voted for a new city. It's not
just an obligation to serve them, but it's a privilege. It's truly an
honor."</TE>
<TE>   The election results might also allow the-mayor-that-wasn't to be
honored.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll get to be in all the parades," quipped Richman's younger
brother, Craig Richman, a prosecutor in the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Others predicted Richman's victory will be more than symbolic, and
will allow him to play a significant role in city politics.</TE>
<TE>   "We would look to him as a leader," said Gary Thomas, chairman of
the Republican Coalition of the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign strategist Mitchell Englander said he and Richman have
discussed roles that a mayor of the nonexistent Valley city could
play. "He becomes spokesman for the Valley ... a voice and face for
the Valley ... to work with the leadership of the city of Los Angeles
on issues that the Valley cares about," Englander said. "We have a
lot of work ahead of us."</TE>
<TE>   As the top council vote-getter for the vanquished Hollywood city,
which voters rejected by a wide margin, Rosa Martinez pledged
Wednesday that she too will hound Hahn to pay more attention to one
of the world's most famous communities.</TE>
<TE>   Nightclub owner Gene La Pietra, who bankrolled the Hollywood
secession movement, also won one of the five at-large council seats,
finishing second. It was an expensive victory: La Pietra spent about
$2.5 million of his own money. "I'm proud of the campaign we ran," La
Pietra said.</TE>
<TE>   Other Hollywood council winners were simply stunned.</TE>
<TE>   "Apparently, I've been elected to an office that doesn't exist,"
said C. Edward Dilkes, an attorney who finished fourth in the
Hollywood balloting.</TE>
<TE>   Former Assemblywoman Paula Boland overwhelmingly won the seat in
the Valley's 3rd district, which included parts of West Hills,
Winnetka, Canoga Park, Porter Ranch and Chatsworth. She plans to run
in the March election to replace L.A. Councilman Hal Bernson.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel there was a mandate tonight," Boland said late Tuesday as
returns rolled in. "People want my voice. They want to bring that
voice to City Hall."</TE>
<TE>   Boland sponsored a 1996 Assembly bill that would have set the
stage for a breakaway initiative. It died in the state Senate, but a
compromise version was approved the following year.</TE>
<TE>   She said of her phantom council seat: "It's kind of like being a
king without a kingdom."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Sharon Bernstein, Caitlin Liu and Stephanie
Stassel contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>A Word of Advice for Davis About Running for President:
Don't</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Governor, don't even think about it. Don't waste one moment
daydreaming about running for president.</LD>
<LD>   Close the door. Shut it out.</LD>
<LD>   At least for 2004 -- tempting though it might be, now that
Democrats have tanked nationally.</LD>
<TE>   Actually, I'd argue that despite Gov. Gray Davis'
narrower-than-projected reelection victory (5 points), his
presidential prospects improved Tuesday. That's because fewer
Democrats were left standing and some of those still erect are
wobbling.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) no longer will be the Senate majority
leader. Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) failed again to lead Democrats
into a House majority.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia's Democratic governor, Roy Barnes, had White House
ambitions, but he was kicked out of office.</TE>
<TE>   New York, Florida, Texas all have Republican governors. Michigan
elected a rising star Democrat, Jennifer Granholm, but she was born
in Canada and is ineligible for the White House. Illinois will have a
new Democratic governor with a tongue-twisting name: Blagojevich.</TE>
<TE>   The Sunday national talk shows will be calling on California's
governor to speak for Democrats across America. After all, he and his
ticket survived the national Republican onslaught. Tell us, governor,
what is your secret for Democratic victory?</TE>
<TE>   The answer Davis cannot give: Work night and day hitting up
special interests for a record $70 million. Use the money to destroy
your strongest potential opponent and secure the GOP nomination for
the weakest gubernatorial candidate ever. Then bludgeon him.</TE>
<TE>   But, of course, as long as the GOP keeps fielding candidates who
oppose abortion rights, gun control and environmental protections,
the party's going to be spitting in the eye of moderate swing voters.</TE>
<TE>   Are these merely California issues, or can they be used as
Democratic weapons nationally? Davis ad-maker David Doak thinks they
can be and Democratic candidates have been foolish not to try.</TE>
<TE>   "We should run affirmatively on social issues -- 'choice,' the
environment, being worker-friendly. Gun control. We need to polarize
issues more and not be afraid to stand for something."</TE>
<TE>   That describes Davis, at least on these litmus-test issues. After
Tuesday, Doak predicts national politicos "will be knocking on his
door."</TE>
<TE>   Don't open it, governor.</TE>
<TE>   Don't be seduced by the siren song that landed predecessors Pete
Wilson and Jerry Brown -- your old boss -- on the political rocks.</TE>
<TE>   Ask Wilson: The job of California governor is too big and the
distance too great between Sacramento and New Hampshire. "It's very
difficult to do the [governor's] job and adequately campaign," he
lamented to me after his 1995 misadventure.</TE>
<TE>   It's ego-gratifying and stature-building to be blessed by the
Great Mentioner as a potential presidential or even veep candidate.</TE>
<TE>   But here's the history: No sitting California governor ever has
been nominated, let alone been elected president. Two have been
nominated for vice president; neither elected. (The legendary Earl
Warren, as a running mate, couldn't even carry the state for Tom
Dewey.)</TE>
<TE>   More importantly, California voters don't take kindly to offering
an unpopular governor -- Wilson or Davis -- a second chance, only to
watch him bolt for New Hampshire shortly after his inauguration.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is not dumb. He watched Brown and Wilson be humiliated.
Although he won't say "never" -- as Wilson foolishly did -- this
governor does not seem to be tempted.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray and I have never had a conversation about the presidency in
the nine years I've been with him," reports chief strategist Garry
South.</TE>
<TE>   "All I'm going to say," Davis told me Wednesday, "is I have one
goal, which is to leave California a better place. You know how much
work that's going to take. I'm devoting my energies to that. I'm not
fueling any speculation.... "</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference, however, Davis emphasized points that could
strengthen his national resume: "It's not easy to stand up against a
national [Republican] tide."</TE>
<TE>   "In California, the Democratic Party stands for something. We're
leading America in many areas. In stem cell research. Paid family
leave. Combating global warming. Sensible gun laws....</TE>
<TE>   "California has returned to its natural role as a national
leader."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, however, must return to popularity before he can run again
for anything.</TE>
<TE>   The Times exit poll found that 60% of voters had an unfavorable
impression of him; 61% disapproved of his job performance.</TE>
<TE>   Davis clearly needs to rehabilitate himself with voters. By
governing effectively.</TE>
<TE>   Tackle the dogged budget deficit head-on. Be bold. Don't flinch
from tax increases and deep cuts. That's unpopular, but real
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Don't even think Oval Office. Well, if you're rehabilitating
yourself, governor, maybe it's OK to daydream about 2008.</TE>

<LD>Seventh-grade students had just gathered Wednesday for life science
class at Pasadena's Washington Middle School when a 15-foot section
of ceiling plaster above them collapsed, slightly injuring two.</LD>
<LD>   For most of the 26 students, the rain of light debris at 8 a.m.
was simply frightening, but one girl suffered a wrist injury and one
boy went into shock and had abrasions. They were treated at
Huntington Memorial Hospital and released.</LD>
<LD>   The school was built in 1923, and Pasadena Unified School District
spokesman Erik A. Nasarenko said part of a recent bond issue is being
spent on renovating the campus.</LD>
<TE>   Teacher Jim Robinette said his students, mostly 12-year-olds, had
undergone emergency training, so that "when it happened, faster than
an earthquake," they knew to take cover and then evacuate.</TE>
<TE>   "A little plaster came down, and then the whole thing came," he
said. "We were out of the room very quickly."</TE>
<TE>   The main school building was closed temporarily for inspection, as
firefighters, police and structural engineers, including personnel
from the state architect's office, arrived to try to determine the
cause. The classroom's wood ceiling beams appeared uncompromised.</TE>

<HD>Time Will Tell if It's a Democratic Sweep</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>In vivid contrast to their fortunes nationwide, Democrats in
California hovered Wednesday on the cusp of sweeping all statewide
offices, a feat no political party has pulled off since 1946.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans' lone hope of avoiding a shutout was the race for
state controller, in which conservative state Sen. Tom McClintock
remained on the heels of Democrat Steve Westly with as many as
700,000 ballots yet to be counted.</LD>
<LD>   With Westly's lead a slim one, the secretary of state's office
called the race a toss-up. A final, official result may be delayed
until next week, as outstanding absentee and provisional ballots from
the 58 counties are tallied.</LD>
<TE>   But Westly, a wealthy former EBay executive and longtime
Democratic Party activist, said he remains "cautiously optimistic" he
will prevail, and analysts from both parties said it was likely.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately, a lot of the votes that are outstanding are from Los
Angeles, San Francisco and Alameda counties, and we think those will
break our way," Westly said.</TE>
<TE>   McClintock declined to be interviewed. But his campaign director,
David Reade, said the lawmaker from Thousand Oaks remained hopeful of
withstanding the Democratic juggernaut.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of counting yet to be done," Reade said. "This is
not over yet."</TE>
<TE>   In the other so-called down ballot races, the GOP was skunked.
Democratic political consultant Darry Sragow said the results show
the Republican Party is "thoroughly out of step with California,
because their candidates had a great opportunity this year and could
have scored some big gains."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans said the results were not entirely bleak. Many took
heart in the relatively modest margins of victory recorded by
Democrats, except in the officially nonpartisan race for
superintendent of public instruction, where state Sen. Jack O'Connell
(D-San Luis Obispo) trounced Republican Katherine Smith of Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Though incumbent Democrats Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, Treasurer
Phil Angelides and Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer all won reelection, the
largest margin, according to unofficial results, was 9 percentage
points -- in the treasurer's race.</TE>
<TE>   In the contests with no incumbents, Democrat John Garamendi became
state insurance commissioner, but his Republican foe trailed by only
5 percentage points. Assemblyman Kevin Shelley (D-San Francisco) won
the race for secretary of state, but his victory margin was small as
well.</TE>
<TE>   "If these races had been landslides, the results might have had a
strong psychological impact," said GOP strategist Dan Schnur. "But
because the Republican candidates ran so close, even while being
outspent in some cases 3 to 1, it actually provides some
encouragement moving forward."</TE>
<TE>   Schnur and others, however, conceded that the failure of any
Republicans to grab a statewide office -- barring a McClintock win --
leaves the GOP with a weak bench.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, the results leave the party without a statewide leader,"
GOP consultant Richard Temple said. Given that vacuum, he said
"everybody is talking" about Arnold Schwarzenegger.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got the money and people know who he is," Temple said. "He's
been proven to be effective, formidable and talented," most recently
in his successful promotion of Proposition 49 on Tuesday's ballot.</TE>
<TE>   In the Legislature, meanwhile, Republicans picked up two seats in
the Assembly, and were hopeful that the outstanding absentee ballots
might hand them a third. Also uncertain -- but tilting toward
Democrats -- was the outcome of a Senate race in the San Joaquin
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   But for the most part, there was little mystery in the legislative
races, because of a carefully scripted redrawing of district
boundaries by party leaders last year: "The majority in the
Assembly," Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) declared, "is still
firmly in the hands of the Democrats."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, perhaps the most interesting change beneath the Capitol
dome has to do with sexual orientation -- not political persuasion.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats Mark Leno, a San Francisco supervisor, and John Laird, a
former Santa Cruz mayor, won Assembly seats and became the first
openly gay men in the statehouse. They join lesbians Jackie Goldberg
(D-Los Angeles) and Christine Kehoe (D-San Diego), both reelected in
the lower house, and Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica).</TE>

<HD>$46,834 Labeled Misused at EIDC</HD>
<DH>Film agency leader conspired with Pittsburgh official,
affidavit says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Berry and Anita M. Busch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cody Cluff, head of the Entertainment Industry Development Corp.,
conspired to misappropriate $46,834 in funds with the Pittsburgh film
commissioner to whom he once sent flowers and an "I love you" note,
according to allegations in court documents.</LD>
<LD>   The figure was disclosed in an affidavit for a search in
Pittsburgh earlier this week. It is more than three times what had
been previously alleged.</LD>
<LD>   The document alleged that Cluff lacked authority to give EIDC
funds to the Pittsburgh Film Office and a national film advocacy
group called FilmUS, both of which are headed by Dawn Keezer. Cluff
is acting secretary of FilmUS, a group of 196 state and local film
commissioners organized to stem the flow of film production from the
U.S.</LD>
<TE>   The 20-page document , prepared by the Los Angeles County district
attorney's office, also cited a $1,489 bill paid for by the EIDC for
a "Mr. and Mrs. Cody and Dawn Cluff" in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Councilman Dennis Zine, who resigned from the
EIDC board recently, called the new allegations "embarrassing" to
elected officials.</TE>
<TE>   "The more we learn, the more twisted the operation of Cody Cluff
and the EIDC seems to be," he said Wednesday. "It creates greater
suspicion about the alleged misappropriation of funds, whether it's
public or private."</TE>
<TE>   Cluff's attorney, Tom Brown, said that his client had done nothing
wrong. Brown said the prosecutor's focus on the relationship between
Keezer and Cluff "diverts attention from the real issue." He said the
office of Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley has used
tactics worthy of the National Enquirer.</TE>
<TE>   "It just doesn't have anything to do with what could or could not
have been done with the funds," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Keezer's attorney, Stanton Levenson of Pittsburgh, said that
"there is nothing in the affidavit that could be construed as
conspiracy," regardless of whether the two had a romantic
relationship. Levenson said he had no information about the
relationship.</TE>
<TE>   In the affidavit, senior investigator Kimberly Michael wrote,
"Because of Cluff's personal relationship with Keezer, I believe he
offered financial support for the Pittsburgh Film Office by using
public funds from the EIDC."</TE>
<TE>   She said, "Cluff ... did not have the authority to loan, grant or
give public monies to any other agency or facility without the
approval of the board of directors of the EIDC."</TE>
<TE>   EIDC, which coordinates the issuing of film permits in Los Angeles
County, spent as much as $25,000 on legal fees and tax preparation to
set up and incorporate FilmUS. In the affidavit, investigators said
money directed to the Pittsburgh Film Office and FilmUS by Cluff was
a misuse of public funds because, they contend, the EIDC is public
and was not organized to create other businesses in California or in
other states.</TE>
<TE>   The legal question of whether the EIDC is public or private will
ultimately be resolved in court and will be a key factor in
determining whether the EIDC's funds were misspent.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no misappropriation of funds," said Brown, asserting
that the EIDC is a private corporation.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have alleged in court papers that the misuse of funds
by Cluff and EIDC includes money spent for personal expense accounts
and political contributions made by the office to elected officials,
some of whom serve on EIDC's board of directors and executive
committee.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the EIDC's executive committee meeting, which was
scheduled for today, was canceled Wednesday for lack of a quorum. The
committee had been scheduled to discuss bids received for an audit of
the EIDC.</TE>
<TE>   The affidavit led to a search in Pittsburgh on Tuesday, the third
raid involving nine locations in its investigation of Cluff and the
EIDC.</TE>
<TE>   The search was carried out by investigators from Los Angeles and
Allegheny counties and the FBI at the Pittsburgh Film Office,
Keezer's home and the Mendelson Art Gallery, where Cluff purchased an
$8,700 painting, according to the affidavit. Brown said that the
painting hangs in Cluff's EIDC office.</TE>
<TE>   Michael questioned the legitimacy of FilmUS, whose board includes
commissioners from New York, Michigan and Virginia. The group has no
staff, and none of its board is salaried.</TE>
<TE>   FilmUS "does not seem to have a tangible existence or function,"
Michael said. "I have not discovered evidence of FilmUS serving any
legitimate purpose."</TE>
<TE>   The agency is well-known in Hollywood, and its representatives
have lobbied Congress for tax breaks to entice filmmakers to remain
in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the other expenses revealed in the affidavit included
Federal Express bills for expenses to transport such items as a
Pittsburgh Film Office phone charger, Keezer's FilmUS business cards,
and numerous FilmUS documents.</TE>

<HD>El Toro Park Plan Lost Funds in Vote</HD>

<LD>Is the Great Park turning into the Great Lot?</LD>
<LD>   With the rejection of Proposition 51, Irvine won't get $120
million it had hoped to use to begin transforming the closed El Toro
Marine base into a massive open space and recreation area.</LD>
<LD>   The ballot measure was resoundingly defeated in every Orange
County city -- including Irvine -- as well as statewide, suggesting
that even local voters don't want general fund money redirected to
the Great Park.</LD>
<TE>   No problem, says Irvine Mayor Larry Agran, who was reelected
Tuesday on a platform of getting the park built. He said the $120
million would have merely been icing on the cake. Agran says he is
confident that fees from developers permitted to build on 15% of the
4,700-acre base will pay for the whole project. He insists he will
keep his vow not to raise taxes for the park.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this sets us back maybe a year," Agran said.</TE>
<TE>   Other park proponents warn that it's much worse than that. Without
the massive infusion of cash from the state budget, they say, large
swaths of the base could remain untouched for years -- or even
decades.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine anyone saying this money was icing on the cake,"
said former Irvine Mayor Christina L. Shea, who will rejoin the park
planning process if she holds onto her razor-thin lead over Agran
ally Mitch Goldstone in Tuesday's City Council election. "This money
was the cake, the plate and the serving utensils, to boot."</TE>
<TE>   Voters endorsed the park plan in March when they approved a county
ballot initiative that killed a proposed airport at the base. But the
Proposition 51 defeat suggests that residents may be less
enthusiastic about seeing the park actually get built than they were
about using it as a reason to kill the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's vote also reflects the confusing nature of the
proposition, which included dozens of projects statewide and was
pitched as a "safe school bus" and "transportation" measure.</TE>
<TE>   While Agran expresses confidence that developers will pay for the
whole thing, he has yet to disclose the math behind his plan.</TE>
<TE>   Under it, developers who win the right to build at the base
through public auction would contribute to the park. Urban planners
say it costs up to $200,000 an acre to build and maintain the kind of
park Agran envisions.</TE>
<TE>   And many in the building industry are skeptical that developers
will be willing to foot the whole bill, especially for the right to
build on land that lacks infrastructure and may need to be insured
against the risk of toxic contamination, despite promises by the
federal government to clean it.</TE>
<TE>   City officials, however, say much of the park will pay for itself,
including an area for privately built golf courses, a satellite
campus that Cal State Fullerton plans to expand, a veterans cemetery
and a museum.</TE>
<TE>   "We would not have put together a financial plan that was betting
on some vote," said City Manager Allison Hart. "The park will proceed
exactly as it was proposed."</TE>
<TE>   Many in the public are keen to see that financial plan.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no way to critique their plan because they haven't told
anyone what they are doing," said Richard Gollis, chair of the Orange
County chapter of the Urban Land Institute. "There have been no
disclosures as to what is going on."</TE>
<TE>   Critics warned that the measure would steer funds away from
education, health care and other areas to fund "luxury" projects such
as Irvine's park.</TE>

details will all come soon. "This is a complex land transaction," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   That's not a good enough answer for Shea. "Everything is being
done in private, and I don't think that is fair," she said. "We've
got a whole lot of shadow games and shell games and nobody knows what
is going on."</TE>
<TE>   One element of the park financing plan that city officials have
disclosed is that developer fees will get Irvine only the most
bare-bones of parks.</TE>
<TE>   It will take other money to buy the "jewelry," they say, which
could be anything from stone walls to ponds.</TE>
<TE>   Where that money will come from following the defeat of
Proposition 51 is unknown. The Great Park was one of dozens of
projects across the state that would have been bumped to the front of
the line for state funding if the measure had passed.</TE>
<TE>   Critics warned that the measure would steer funds away from
education, health care and other areas to fund "luxury" projects such
as Irvine's park. And state lawmakers accused the measure's drafters
of "initiative pimping" by including millions of dollars for projects
that would benefit developers in exchange for hefty campaign
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Agran touted Proposition 51 as a chance to return Orange County
its fair share of funding. He says he intends to be at El Toro with a
jackhammer by late next year to help tear the runways up. He promises
that the entire park will be built within 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I've grown used to all the doomsayers and doubters and defeatists
and professional pessimists," he said. "They say it can't be done. To
them, I say, 'nuts.' "</TE>

<HD>Hahn Reaches Out to Enfold Secessionists</HD>
<DH>In a morning-after speech, the mayor outlines his strategy
for bringing the city back together and promises meaningful changes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Shuster and Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn welcomed the San Fernando Valley back
to the fold Wednesday, a day after efforts to create new cities there
and in Hollywood failed, saying he wants separatists to join with him
to move the city forward.</LD>
<LD>   The mayor, who led a multimillion-dollar campaign to defeat the
secession efforts, appeared at a Van Nuys hotel Wednesday morning to
cheers and a standing ovation from about 250 people, including some
elected officials, city department heads, commissioners and community
leaders.</LD>
<LD>   Several of them said the mayor's morning-after speech was among
his best. He was interrupted 20 times by applause.</LD>
<TE>   "Yesterday, the voters of Los Angeles sent a strong, strong
message to keep Los Angeles united," Hahn said. "The secession debate
has forever changed our city. It already has changed the way the city
does business.... Join us in moving Los Angeles forward."</TE>
<TE>   It was the beginning of another campaign of sorts for the mayor,
who plans to roll out several new initiatives to improve city
services in the Valley and to prove that he takes seriously
secessionists' complaints that City Hall has been unresponsive.</TE>
<TE>   He announced that he will host a meeting next month with the
candidates who ran for council and mayoral offices in the proposed
cities.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn also will announce today the establishment of the first phase
of the city's new toll-free 311 system, which is designed to relieve
the 911 system of nonemergency calls and to enable residents to
access hundreds of city services more easily.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the mayor will host a round-table discussion of
community policing with the city's new police chief, William J.
Bratton, and others.</TE>
<TE>   Next week, Hahn will hold a series of media events, including one
on working with the school district to find new school sites and
another to discuss reforms in city departments.</TE>
<TE>   But even some of those who were asked to sit on the stage behind
the mayor as he spoke Wednesday said Hahn faces a difficult task in
convincing secessionists that City Hall will be responsive.</TE>
<TE>   While both secession measures were soundly defeated citywide,
50.8% of Valley voters supported breaking away, demonstrating a deep
reservoir of dissatisfaction with Los Angeles. Hollywood voters
overwhelmingly rejected splitting off from the city.</TE>
<TE>   "It will take a lot of work for the mayor," said Police
Commissioner Bert Boeckmann, a Valley car dealer who was a secession
supporter but who didn't contribute as much money to the campaign as
some expected. "I think, if he's sincere, people will see it, and I
think that will lessen what I think are their very real concerns."</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, said the Hahn administration already has made
strides in focusing on local city services, including adding more
money for such neighborhood improvements as street paving and
sidewalk repairs.</TE>
<TE>   "He already is moving the government. It's less rhetoric and more
action than we've seen in years," said George Keiffer, an attorney
who has advised the mayor and who served as the former head of the
appointed charter reform commission. "He knows how to move this
ship."</TE>
<TE>   In his speech, Hahn highlighted many of the initiatives he has
undertaken this year, including creating neighborhood councils and
area planning panels to give residents more say in governmental
decisions, rebuilding the Los Angeles Police Department by hiring a
new chief, implementing a more flexible work schedule, streamlining
the hiring process and building new parks and libraries.Hahn also
announced that the city's bond rating had been adjusted from negative
to stable by Fitch Ratings. He said the upgrade was a direct result
of the failure of the two secession efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Calling the secession vote a wake-up call, nine members of the Los
Angeles City Council also pledged from the steps of Van Nuys City
Hall to continue neighborhood improvements.</TE>
<TE>   "The people of the San Fernando Valley have spoken," said Council
President Alex Padilla. "We've heard the concerns of those who
supported secession. We've heard you loud and clear. Let us assure
you today that we are here to work harder than ever to meet the
challenges and needs of all communities in the city of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   While secessionists suspected that increases in street repairs and
tree trimming in recent months were part of an effort to blunt the
momentum of secession, City Council members said Wednesday it is part
of a continuing improvement being pushed by a "new" council, most of
whose members have been elected in the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   Council members also called for a period of healing so that Valley
secessionists can be brought into the process of revamping City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like we've got some making up to do," said Councilwoman
Cindy Miscikowski, quoting a lyric from the Neil Sedaka song
"Breaking Up Is Hard to Do."</TE>
<TE>   The unofficial gathering of a council majority at Van Nuys City
Hall will be followed next week by an official council meeting at 6
p.m. Wednesday at Mission College in Sylmar, where the agenda will
include a plan to create seven new council committees based on
geography.</TE>
<TE>   Under that plan, proposed by Councilman Tom LaBonge, a cluster of
north Valley council members would hold a town hall meeting
periodically to discuss local issues, as would south Valley council
members and those on the Westside and Eastside and in other parts of
the city.</TE>

<DH>The controversial Anaheim high school board member was too
extreme to win a third term, observers say.</DH>

<LD>It's a sign of the times, say Latino activists and political
observers, that an Anaheim school board member who made headlines for
proposing to bill foreign countries for the cost of educating illegal
immigrants has failed to win a third term.</LD>
<LD>   Harald G. Martin placed fifth in a field of 12 candidates seeking
three seats on the Anaheim Union High School District board,
according to preliminary election results released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Harald Martin is someone known -- maybe even nationwide -- for
his belligerent and, some would say, outrageous attitudes and
actions," said Chapman University political science professor Fred
Smoller.</LD>
<TE>   "But the middle winds are blowing through American politics.
People who are extremists or are perceived to be extremists don't do
well."</TE>
<TE>   Martin, a 47-year-old Anaheim police officer, could not be reached
for comment Wednesday. But supporters lamented his defeat and lauded
his accomplishments in eight years on the local high school board.</TE>
<TE>   Board President Katherine H. Smith, who lost her bid for state
superintendent of public instruction, said Martin is leaving a legacy
of concern for children and their success.</TE>
<TE>   "Harald was the driving force behind all the things to change the
environment and make it better," Smith said. "He set the pace, and
the direction is there. We will pick it up and follow it."</TE>
<TE>   Besides wanting to bill foreign governments for illegal
immigrants, a proposal that federal officials refused to enact,
Martin suggested a board policy to expel known gang members from
district campuses and supported a plan to reinstitute paddling as a
form of school discipline.</TE>
<TE>   The board instead voted to ban gang-related attire and behavior.
The state Assembly rejected the paddling plan.</TE>
<TE>   Acting as a private citizen, Martin also led a successful effort
to place an immigration official in the city jail to deport
undocumented arrestees and dumped a ton of manure in a city park in
an effort to drive away drug dealers.</TE>
<TE>   "He always had a lot of good ideas and a lot of ideas that upset
people," said Robert Stewart, a former district trustee who had often
sided with Martin on controversial issues and was elected Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally, one outnumbered the other."</TE>
<TE>   Incumbent Thomas Holguin and former Northern California school
board member Denise Mansfield-Reinking also took seats.</TE>
<TE>   One of Martin's most vocal opponents -- Anaheim activist Amin
David of the League of United Latin American Citizens -- also
challenged Martin at the polls Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   David, who came in 11th with little more than a third of the
11,840 votes Martin collected, said winning was never the point of
his own campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted the opportunity to shout loud and clear about the evil
effects that Martin has on the board," David said. "And I have been
victorious. The mission was to make sure Harald Martin did not get
reelected."</TE>

<LD>When Rico Mendez was 3, he lost his dad to disease. A few years
later, his mother was jailed. The New York native came west to live
with relatives in Los Angeles, but he said he left them at age 18
after too many taunts that he was nothing but a bum.</LD>
<LD>   In September 2001, Mendez found himself in circumstances he had
never imagined: frightened, depressed, hungry and homeless.</LD>
<LD>   That's when he found Covenant House, the nation's largest
nonprofit organization serving homeless and runaway young people. In
the year since, Mendez has undergone a startling transformation.</LD>
<TE>   Not only does he have three square meals a day and a warm, safe
place to sleep, but he has also landed a job as an usher at El
Capitan Theatre in Hollywood and is preparing for his high school
equivalency degree, thanks to Covenant House's educational and
employment skills center. He has discovered a cause of his learning
problems: attention deficit disorder, which Covenant House's on-site
health clinic diagnosed and treated.</TE>
<TE>   And Mendez says he has found a new inner peace, thanks to
conversations with ministers that the faith-based organization makes
available.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a new man," Mendez, 20, said recently as he shared his story
along with four other participants in the program. "When I first
called Covenant House, I was crying, with nowhere to go. My life has
done a 180-degree turn."</TE>
<TE>   Covenant House was established by a Catholic priest in New York in
1972 and today operates 21 centers in the United States, Central
America, Mexico and Canada. The Los Angeles affiliate, in an
eye-catching rust, mustard and purple building on Western Avenue in
Hollywood, began in 1988 with its signature service: "street
outreach" to find and help homeless youths.</TE>
<TE>   Covenant House California offers emergency housing and a full
range of medical, employment and educational services. Sister Mary
Rose McGeady, president of the California operation, said her staff
also tries to offer something essential to rehabilitation that most
of her charges have never received: "unconditional love and absolute
respect."</TE>
<TE>   According to Executive Director George Lozano, the Los Angeles
branch serves as many as 100 young people a day who range in age from
22 to as young as 11. The $9-million California operation, which
includes a site in Oakland, is largely funded by private donations --
including $15,000 from last year's Los Angeles Times Holiday
Campaign.</TE>
<TE>   For Charles Frazier, who said he left an abusive father at age 17
three years ago, Covenant House has brought a loving new family,
support to realize his dream of studying sports management at Santa
Monica College and rich life experiences -- a chance earlier this
year, for instance, to hear Pope John Paul II speak in Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   "If it weren't for Covenant House," Frazier said, "Lord knows
where I'd be."</TE>

<LD>Take my joke. Please.</LD>
<LD>   It could make you feel better.</LD>
<LD>   UC Irvine researchers have found that even looking forward to a
funny event creates physiological changes that reduce stress. Results
of the study were presented Wednesday at a meeting of the Society for
Neuroscience in Orlando, Fla.</LD>
<TE>   A team led by Lee Berk, assistant professor of family medicine and
a researcher at the Susan Samueli Center for Complementary and
Alternative Medicine, tested 16 men at Loma Linda University. The
eight who were told three days ahead of time that they would watch a
funny video saw the levels of three stress hormones drop.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the researchers found the men showed increases in
endorphins and growth hormones, both of which reduce stress.</TE>
<TE>   "The anticipation of a funny event changes mood states, which
appears to trigger profound physiological changes in the body," Berk
said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Berk said, mood and body changes last well after the
actual event, suggesting that "optimism and ... anticipation of
positive experiences appear to help in recovery from illness,
supporting the reality that there may be a biology to the concept of
hope."</TE>

<HD>Backers of Failed 'Living Wage' Vow to Press On</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martha Groves</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Disappointed but not dejected by the narrow defeat of Santa Monica's
"living wage" measure, proponents said Wednesday they would continue
their battle to boost the pay of the city's service workers.</LD>
<LD>   Business leaders who opposed the measure, meanwhile, acknowledged
that backers of Measure JJ had raised valid social concerns but said
their proposed solution was unworkable. The ordinance's supporters
had worthy goals, but "their approach wasn't wise," said Tom Larmore,
who heads the Chamber of Commerce's issues committee.</LD>
<LD>   Both sides agreed that the hard-fought issue of pay for the
working poor, which has put Santa Monica in the national spotlight,
isn't going away.</LD>
<TE>   Measure JJ failed by a slim 745 votes, with 12,608 ballots cast in
favor and 13,353 against.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to continue to work for ... justice for these people
who woke up this morning and still had to figure out how to buy food
and pay rent," said the Rev. Sandie Richards, a United Methodist
minister at Church in Ocean Park in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   The mood of Richards and other Measure JJ proponents was much more
subdued than it was Tuesday night, when they celebrated the end of a
bruising campaign with Cuban music, Mexican folk dancers and Thai
food. By midnight, with early returns moving against them,
disheartened volunteers began heading for home.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, they said, they were defeated by the argument that the
measure threatened to take funds away from schools, libraries and
other services. The campaign against the measure was funded largely
by the city's luxury hotels.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the 90 or so living-wage ordinances across the nation
cover companies that have contracts with cities. Santa Monica's
proposal drew attention as the first that would have established a
minimum wage for private employers of hotel maids, food-service
workers and others.</TE>
<TE>   Passed last year by the Santa Monica City Council, the ordinance
would have required businesses in the city's coastal tourism zone
with more than $5 million a year in gross sales to pay their
employees $10.50 an hour with health benefits or $12.25 without.
Business leaders launched a signature-gathering campaign to put the
issue on Tuesday's ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Larmore said the business community wants the City Council to
convene a meeting of Santa Monica residents and business owners to
discuss the issues raised in the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   One solution would be to have the chamber sponsor a health program
that businesses could tap into.</TE>
<TE>   Richards dismissed Larmore's suggestion, saying the city's large
luxury hotels in the past have failed to negotiate in good faith.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Sonn, a living-wage proponent at the Brennan Center for
Justice at New York University's School of Law, called the defeat of
Measure JJ "an unfortunate short-term setback" for the national
living-wage movement. "Living-wage policies that reach beyond the
city-contracted sector and affect some of the private labor market
are ... an important new direction," he said.</TE>

<HD>Back to Drawing Board for Museums</HD>
<DH>With Measure A's failure, art and natural history
facilities must seek other fund sources.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They knew it was a long shot. But the backers of Measure A figured it
was a worthwhile gamble to spend $5 million in hopes that voters
would embrace a $250-million "earthquake and fire safety" bond issue
to bankroll capital improvement projects at Los Angeles County's art
and natural history museums, along with a handful of other cultural
facilities.</LD>
<LD>   The gamble failed. Though Measure A drew 60.4% of the votes cast
in Los Angeles County, about 10,000 more votes than Gov. Gray Davis
won here in his reelection victory, it fell short of the 66.7% it
needed for passage.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, the county's homeowners won't see their property
taxes rise next year by $6.96 per $250,000 of assessed value. And the
museums, whose upgrade-and-expansion plans together amount to an
estimated $600 million in coming years, now face anew the question of
where all that money will come from.</LD>
<TE>   Officials at both museums say they have no immediate plans to pare
their ambitions or slow their schedules.</TE>
<TE>   "I really believe that the right mix is one-third public money and
two-thirds private, which parallels how we cover our operating
expenses. These are public buildings, and the collections are owned
by the public," said Jane Pisano, president and director of the
Natural History Museum.</TE>
<TE>   "At worst, it delays plans, rather than eliminates them," said Eli
Broad, the philanthropist who gave $1.19 million to the Measure A
campaign, then loaned another $1 million in its closing days. Broad
also conceded, however, that "in this economy, it's going to be a
tough, slow road to raise the kind of money that LACMA and the
Natural History Museum need."</TE>
<TE>   Broad, who has hinted at a future gift of at least $25 million to
the LACMA campaign, added, "I can't do it alone. Where does all the
rest come from?"</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky praised Broad's "courage" in
bankrolling the campaign, noting that early on, "I advised him
against this; the odds were very slim. We were drawing to an inside
straight."</TE>
<TE>   LACMA's plans call for razing the four central buildings of the
museum complex, which dates to the 1960s, and replacing them with a
new campus designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas. The cost has
been broadly estimated at $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Natural History Museum, whose oldest sections date to 1913,
remains at an early stage in its expansion and renovation plans, but
it also expects the project to include replacing some parts of the
current complex and renovating others, at a cost estimated at $300
million.</TE>
<TE>   The Measure A campaign spent most of its $5 million on 30-second
television spots and mailers.</TE>
<TE>   Measure A's opponents, who included the local leaders of the
Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. and the Libertarian Party, spent
nothing on advertising but asserted in ballot arguments that the
"earthquake and fire safety" language used by backers was a smoke
screen for a batch of new and improved buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Under Measure A's provisions, the county would have provided $98
million each to LACMA and the Natural History Museum, provided that
each institution separately raised $112.5 million in matching funds
by November 2012.</TE>
<TE>   The measure called for an additional $54 million in bond money for
cultural facilities in the county, including new performing arts
facilities at Cal State Northridge and in the San Gabriel Valley,
along with a new cultural arts complex at El Pueblo de Los Angeles
historic district downtown. Yaroslavsky declined to give up on all
those projects. However, he added, "I think the San Gabriel project
is dead."</TE>
<TE>   Though the postelection hunt for funds will be challenging, the
Natural History Museum's Pisano noted there are places to look. On
Nov. 1, Pisano said, she learned that the governor's office plans to
direct $6 million in state funds toward preservation efforts in the
oldest portion of the museum.</TE>

<HD>Prop. 51 Author Resigns Position</HD>
<DH>Jerry Meral says leaving conservation league is unrelated
to failure of the ballot measure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Vogel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The author of Proposition 51, the traffic congestion measure defeated
by voters Tuesday, has resigned as executive director of the Planning
and Conservation League.</LD>
<LD>   Jerry Meral said his departure has nothing to do with heavy
criticism of Proposition 51 as a "pay for play" initiative tailored
to benefit developers and Indian tribes.</LD>
<LD>   Meral announced his resignation last Thursday, he said, because
his schoolteacher wife is retiring and they plan to move to the
Northern California coast. He said he will work part time raising
money for an endowment for the Planning and Conservation League
Foundation.</LD>
<TE>   Proposition 51 was one of only two initiatives on Tuesday's ballot
to lose. It was trailing Wednesday 59% to 41%, with all but absentee
ballots counted. Meral blamed newspaper coverage and legislative
hearings for swaying voters.</TE>
<TE>   "The press about where the contributions came from and the
opposition of some of the politicians must have made the difference,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   A former high-ranking water official for Democratic Gov. Jerry
Brown, Meral has made the league one of California's most prolific
initiative writers in his two decades as executive director. The
Sacramento environmental group has backed nine measures since 1972,
and five of them passed.</TE>
<TE>   Meral denied that he was pressured into stepping down, despite a
sharply worded letter written to the league's board of directors in
September by state Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco).
Burton called the group's approach to Proposition 51 "shortsighted,
simplistic and heartless," and accused the group of "becoming a whore
for the self-aggrandizement of Jerry Meral instead of being an
organization committed to saving the environment."</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 51 would have shifted away from the general fund
one-third of vehicle sales tax revenue, amounting to roughly $1
billion next year. The money instead would have been used to fund
more than 40 detailed projects.</TE>
<TE>   Though the league called the initiative a "traffic congestion
relief and safe school bus act," the projects ranged from
construction of a railroad museum in Sacramento to bus parking at the
Music Concourse in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the projects attracted large donors to the Yes on 51
campaign. Pardee Construction and Pardee Homes, for example, gave
$700,000. The home builder would have benefited from a connector
linking Interstate 5 and California 56 in San Diego County, for which
Proposition 51 would have earmarked $137 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians donated $750,000. The
initiative included $120 million for a rail line to Indio passing
near the tribe's Palm Springs resort and casino.</TE>
<TE>   Meral conceded that crafting the measure to attract donors was
distasteful, but he said it was necessary in a state where it takes
about $1 million to gather the signatures to qualify a measure for
the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "There were no interest groups we could identify who would give
money simply out of the goodness of their hearts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   League board member Tony Rossman, a San Francisco attorney,
agreed. He said the board supported the initiative in spite of
Burton's letter and other criticism because the Legislature and
transportation agencies have failed to fix California's traffic
congestion problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Jerry was trying to find a new way to solve the problem, and we
were solidly behind him on that," Rossman said.</TE>
<TE>   He said there was no sense among board members that Meral had to
leave for the 37-year-old nonprofit to remain effective. But, he
said, "certainly one implication of the Proposition 51 loss is that
we're going to see the initiative process more judiciously used in
the future."</TE>

<HD>Recipient of Sex Abuse Settlement Wants Priest's Slander
Suit Tossed</HD>
<DH>The San Francisco woman says the Orange County cleric's
litigation is an attempt to silence and punish her for having spoken
out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Phil Willon and William Lobdell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A San Francisco woman who received a $1.2-million sexual abuse
settlement from the Roman Catholic Church this year filed a motion
Wednesday asking a judge to throw out a slander lawsuit brought by a
high-ranking Orange County priest.</LD>
<LD>   Lori Haigh, 38, filed a motion in San Francisco Superior Court
calling the defamation suit by Msgr. Lawrence J. Baird of the Diocese
of Orange a groundless "scare tactic" designed to silence and punish
her for having spoken out.</LD>
<LD>   She said Baird's legal action infringed on her right to free
speech and violated California's law against "SLAPP" suits --
strategic lawsuits against public participation.</LD>
<TE>   "Msgr. Baird's public humiliation of me and his lawsuit has
reopened my old wounds and in many ways inflicted deeper ones," Haigh
said in court papers. "I feel like I've been tarnished and shunned by
God."</TE>
<TE>   The state anti-SLAPP law is designed to keep developers,
corporations and other institutions from filing frivolous suits
solely to silence activists and whistle-blowers. If a judge finds
Baird's slander suit to be groundless, the action could be dismissed
and he could be required to pay Haigh's legal fees.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Catholic Church's sexual abuse scandal surfaced in
January, at least five other priests in the country have filed
slander suits against those accusing them of sexual misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Baird on Wednesday referred all inquiries to his attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Baird, the chief spokesman for the Orange diocese and a key
liaison between the church and the business community, filed suit
against Haigh after she made allegations against him in announcing
her settlement with the dioceses of Orange and Los Angeles in April.</TE>
<TE>   The church settled her contention that, as a teenager, she was
sexually molested by Father John Lenihan.</TE>
<TE>   At a press conference concerning the settlement, Haigh said she
had sought Baird's help 20 years ago while she was still being
abused, and that he made sexual advances toward her.</TE>
<TE>   Baird vigorously denied any misconduct and, at his own press
conference, added that he had never even met with Haigh. Baird
demanded that she retract her comments.</TE>
<TE>   "I have 100% memory that I have never made any inappropriate
contact with any person during my 33 years as a priest," Baird said
at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Until that day, Baird was an unnamed, peripheral character in
Haigh's lawsuit, which alleged that Lenihan impregnated her at age 16
and then paid for her abortion. Lenihan, now out of the priesthood,
has not commented on the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after making her allegations against Baird, Haigh took a
lie-detector test and "passed with flying colors," according to a
court declaration filed by Dr. Edward I. Gelb, an L.A.-based forensic
psychophysiologist and former president of the American Polygraph
Assn. Gelb conducted the test.</TE>
<TE>   Baird's attorney, Robert C. Baker of Los Angeles, said later that
lie-detector tests are easy to manipulate, which is why they are not
admissible as evidence in court. Because of that, Baird would not
take a polygraph test, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Goldowitz of the California Anti-SLAPP Project in Berkeley,
one of Haigh's attorneys in the case, said the state's anti-SLAPP law
is designed to prevent powerful corporations or other entities from
dragging activists and other citizens through expensive litigation
solely to retaliate against them for exercising their 1st Amendment
rights.</TE>
<TE>   Goldowitz said Baird has no chance of winning his defamation
lawsuit because, as a public figure, he is required to prove that
Haigh knowingly made false allegations or that she showed reckless
disregard as to whether the accusations were false.</TE>
<TE>   "She clearly did not know or believe it was false. That's
reflected by her lie-detector test," Goldowitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Goldowitz said that if Baird wants to prove he has been wrongly
accused, he should submit to a polygraph test.</TE>
<TE>   Judge A. James Robertson is scheduled to consider the motion Nov.
27.</TE>

<HD>Judge Orders Girl, 16, Transferred From Jail</HD>
<DH>Murder defendant had been moved last month from juvenile
hall for disciplinary reasons. Her lawyer says she was held in
virtual isolation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Guccione</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge has ordered a 16-year-old female murder defendant who has
been incarcerated in virtual isolation at the Twin Towers
Correctional Facility for nearly a month be returned to a juvenile
hall.</LD>
<LD>   Anait Msryan, who has been in custody since 2000, was transferred
on Oct. 9 from juvenile hall to the sheriff's custody for fighting,
gang activity and possession of contraband, including money,
alcohol-based mouthwash, tongue rings and a sexual device, according
to a probation official.</LD>
<LD>   But Superior Court Judge Terry A. Green found the disciplinary
offenses cited by probation officials did not warrant Msryan's
transfer. On Tuesday, he ordered Msryan moved back to juvenile hall.</LD>
<TE>   Green called Msryan "a challenging individual" for probation
officials but said she did not appear to be any worse than other
juvenile offenders in their custody.</TE>
<TE>   Her attorney, Theodore S. Flier, and Peter Glick, legal counsel
for Sheriff Lee Baca, had asked the judge to move Msryan out of Twin
Towers because of inadequate housing for teenage girls.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no housing facility at the county jail for [minor]
females so she is segregated from all the other people in custody,"
Flier said in court. "She is, in effect, in solitary confinement."</TE>
<TE>   Msryan is charged in the stabbing death of 17-year-old Raul
Aguirre, a Glendale student who was trying to break up a fight
between rival gang members outside Hoover High School.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Msryan drove the getaway car for her boyfriend,
Karen Terteryan, now 20, and Rafael Gevorgyan, now 17, who are also
charged in Aguirre's slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Msryan had been housed in juvenile halls since her May 2000
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   All three defendants have remained in custody while their
attorneys and prosecutors fought over the process in which the
original indictments were issued. After a successful appellate court
ruling for the defendants, prosecutors refiled murder charges last
December.</TE>

<LD>Dan Fink of L.A. noticed that the folks at the 99 Cents Only Stores
were offering a free beach ball to any customer who brought in a
voting stub. "Aren't they encouraging political hot air?" Fink asked.</LD>
<LD>   Saks and the city: William Halladay sent along a shot of a banner
that was spotted Wednesday within minutes of the jury verdict in the
shoplifting trial of a well-known actress (see photo).</LD>
<LD>   Food for thought: Mary Ellen Miranda of West Covina and Kevin Akin
of Riverside were puzzled by a notation on a packet of cashews (see
accompanying).</LD>
<TE>   Akin marveled how the producer had narrowed down the place of
origin "to two huge countries and a whole continent."</TE>
<TE>   And he speculated whether such descriptions might catch on "in
other areas of life. How about stainless steel precision tools
labeled, 'Made in Sweden or Romania or Southeast Asia,' or a car
'Made in Germany or Serbia or South America?' "</TE>
<TE>   Made in Pomona: "The glitz, the glamour, the glory -- it's all
right here in Pomona," say the organizers of the city's Smogdance
Film Festival. And who can dispute them?</TE>
<TE>   Some of the entries in the Nov. 15-17 extravaganza:</TE>
<TE>   * "The Provider" (by Sarah Shute, 20 minutes), the story of a
"desperate dad of the future (who) haggles over brain goulash" (a
popular meal).</TE>
<TE>   * "Father's Day" (Jeff Burton, 21 minutes), some "evocative
unedited 'found footage' " of a belly dancer at a family celebration.</TE>
<TE>   * "Downsizing" (J Brad Wilke, 16 minutes), in which "little
Johnnie gets 'downsized' out of his own family."</TE>
<TE>   * "Convoy" (David Estis, 3 minutes), an "ode to the I-5 Freeway."
This one, by the way, is set at a truck stop north of the San
Fernando Valley's new secessionist city -- oh, that's right, L.A.
wasn't downsized after all.</TE>
<TE>   There are limits: One of the entries that was rejected for
Smogdance was "Toilet Bowl Confessions." (Don't ask.)</TE>
<TE>   Old business: Al Dominguez sent along a shot with a sort of
Halloween theme (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Anybody out there? The radio talk show host who calls himself Mr.
KABC had pushed KABC newsman Rob Marinko for the governorship on his
program as an alternative to Gray and Bill.</TE>
<TE>   Marinko didn't win -- which isn't surprising, since even some
people at the radio station were unaware of his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend, a caller to Ira Fistell, another yak show host on
KABC-AM (790), brought up the Marinko candidacy and it became evident
that Fistell had no idea what the caller was talking about.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the caller said he was referring to a campaign being
pushed on Mr. KABC's show, to which Fistell said, "I don't listen."</TE>
<TE>   Hey, I'm no talk show fan, myself.</TE>

<HD>Student Pen Pals Meet Face to Face</HD>
<DH>Youths from the Valley and downtown hook up through a
program designed to bring together children of different backgrounds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patricia Ward Biederman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 140 fourth- and fifth-graders had been writing to one another
since school started this fall, but they didn't meet face-to-face
until Wednesday. Half were from nearby Serrania Avenue School, half
from downtown's 93rd Street School. They gathered in the green bowl
of a Woodland Hills park.</LD>
<LD>   Their matchmakers were the Los Angeles Museum of Tolerance and the
Ruby Bridges Foundation.</LD>
<LD>   Based in New York, the foundation was established by Ruby Bridges
Hall, whose name may not be familiar but whose picture is an American
icon.</LD>
<TE>   She was the model for the 1964 Norman Rockwell painting of an
African American girl, alone in her pigtails and white dress, being
escorted to school by armed marshals. Ruby was 6 when she became the
first African American to integrate a Southern grade school in New
Orleans in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation's aim is stated on its Web site: "Racism is a
grown-up disease. Let's stop using kids to spread it."</TE>
<TE>   All 140 youngsters know about Ruby Bridges because she sent each
one a copy of her book "Through My Eyes."</TE>
<TE>   "She really signed it--in pen," said 10-year-old Shannon Russell,
a Serrania fifth-grader. Shannon had read the book and said: "I
didn't like the way she was treated."</TE>
<TE>   Shannon's principal, Susan Babit, beamed: "I'm very proud of how
sensitive you are," Babit said. "Do you remember what Dr. King said?
You have to judge people by the content of their character, not by
the color of their skin."</TE>
<TE>   Ellen Tellez, a fourth-grade teacher at 93rd Street, keeps her
classroom supplied with books full of jokes that are funny without
making fun of anyone. She said she tries to teach her children to
speak out against injustice and to do it effectively.</TE>
<TE>   Tellez praised the program in the park for bringing together
children who might otherwise not have meet. And, she said, "they are
able to share personal experiences so they see that they have all
these things in common ... joys ... fears ... concerns about their
families."</TE>
<TE>   But the youngsters seemed more interested in soccer and pizza than
the program's noble purpose. And because each child had been assigned
a pen pal months ago, each had an almost-friend even before the
meeting in the park.</TE>
<TE>   The Serrania students made autograph books for their pen pals,
welcomed them with a big banner and gave each a Mickey Mouse pen.</TE>
<TE>   Ten-year-olds Kevin Esqueda and Kyle DiBiase sat next to each
other on the grass, eating pizza. They had known each other for less
than an hour, but they were already finishing each other's sentences.</TE>
<TE>   When asked what they liked about the program, Kevin began, "People
learn about us," and Kyle continued, "and you make friends."</TE>
<TE>   They had already established their shared enthusiasm for
spaghetti. But Kevin is a hamburger man. "Hot dogs for me," said
Kyle.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Deutsch, a counselor at 93rd Street, said the program
eliminates barriers and "opens new vistas" for both groups of
students.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of our children see drug deals going down every morning and
prostitutes on the streets, but you see them out here, and you don't
know who's who," Deutsch said.</TE>
<TE>   Suburbia also has its perils: "That's real," the urban teachers
warned, pointing to a sign in the park that reads:
"Caution--rattlesnakes."</TE>
<TE>   Betsy Hammond, executive director of the Ruby Bridges Foundation,
said the organization hopes to learn from the pilot program, tweak it
and replicate it elsewhere. Schools in West Los Angeles and Pacific
Palisades are also participating.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one thing to say what you're going to do, and it's another
to see them living it out," Hammond said. "It touches your heart."</TE>
<TE>   As the adults talked about their vision for a world where
character trumps class or color, a boy's voice rang out: "When do we
get to play on our own?"</TE>

<HD>An Attitude Adjustment Gave Pringle the Edge in Anaheim</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Anaheim mayoral election was still months away, but Curt Pringle
made the critical move of his campaign in August.</LD>
<LD>   The Republican, who 14 years ago was dogged by controversy when
the local GOP stationed guards at polling places in Latino
neighborhoods to block suspected illegal immigrants from voting,
stood shoulder to shoulder with Latino activists who once scorned
him. Together, they advocated on behalf of Mexico-based Gigante, a
supermarket trying to open in Anaheim amid resistance from city
planners.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, it paid off. Residents elected Pringle as their mayor
-- along with two Latino council members -- ushering in what many say
is a new beginning for a city that is now nearly 50% Latino.</LD>
<TE>   Though Latinos did not turn out in droves to support Pringle,
neither did they rally against him. An analysis of turnout in
precincts dominated by Latino voters showed that no mayoral candidate
emerged as the top choice.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a renaissance here," said Amin David, president of Los
Amigos of Orange County, a Latino-rights group. "Curt Pringle did a
masterful thing in the Gigante situation. It brought us into an arena
that we never thought we'd be in together."</TE>
<TE>   Activist Nativo Lopez agreed: "Curt Pringle of 2002 is not the
Curt Pringle of 1988. I don't think he's the same person
ideologically." Those familiar with the Gigante controversy -- the
focus of national media attention when the city redevelopment
director called the store too Hispanic -- use such words as
"pragmatic" and "clever" to describe Pringle's alliance with Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   The politician rode the wave of Republican success all the way to
Assembly speaker during the 1990s, only to lose his electoral luster
in a disastrous run for state treasurer four years ago. In that race,
Latinos reminded voters of Pringle's poll-guard past.</TE>
<TE>   This year, there was no such effort.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't take him on," said Latino activist Art Montez.</TE>
<TE>   Pringle, 43, said he hopes Anaheim residents will focus on his
ability to build consensus rather than on controversial actions from
his past.</TE>
<TE>   "The way you get things done in any diverse community is to figure
out who you want to build bridges to, and then build them," Pringle
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pringle said he has moved beyond the poll guard controversy.
Latino leaders are also ready to move forward.</TE>
<TE>   "This where the word 'tolerance' takes effect," Montez said.
"Everyone is forgiven for their sins, given their abilities and
actions and what they do to show remorse. Gigante was a big one."</TE>
<TE>   But his stand on Gigante is not enough to convince his mayoral
opponent, Lucille Kring, or outgoing Mayor Tom Daly that Pringle is a
changed person.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's too soon to say," Daly said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Pringle continues building coalitions with Latinos, Daly
said it is clear they are a larger political presence in Anaheim than
ever.</TE>
<TE>   Newcomer Richard Chavez upset former Councilman Bob Zemel as the
second highest vote-getter in the council race. Chavez, a city
firefighter who will resign before he takes office, targeted
Spanish-speaking neighborhoods. Bob Hernandez, who finished first, is
a former firefighter.</TE>
<TE>   "We pursued the Hispanic community, typically where nobody had
ever knocked on doors," Chavez said. "I think candidates like Curt
Pringle and the Republican Party have been forced to pay attention to
what's going on demographically in Anaheim."</TE>

<TE>   "This where the word 'tolerance' takes effect," Montez said.
"Everyone is forgiven for their sins, given their abilities and
actions and what they do to show remorse. Gigante was a big one."</TE>
<TE>   But his stand on Gigante is not enough to convince his mayoral
opponent, Lucille Kring, or outgoing Mayor Tom Daly that Pringle is a
changed person.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's too soon to say," Daly said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Pringle continues building coalitions with Latinos, Daly
said it is clear they are a larger political presence in Anaheim than
ever.</TE>
<TE>   Newcomer Richard Chavez upset former Councilman Bob Zemel as the
second highest vote-getter in the council race. Chavez, a city
firefighter who will resign before he takes office, targeted
Spanish-speaking neighborhoods. Bob Hernandez, who finished first, is
a former firefighter.</TE>
<TE>   "We pursued the Hispanic community, typically where nobody had
ever knocked on doors," Chavez said. "I think candidates like Curt
Pringle and the Republican Party have been forced to pay attention to
what's going on demographically in Anaheim."</TE>

<HD>Caltrans Blames Ramp Design, Work</HD>
<DH>Transit agency says it expects the engineering firm, prime
contractor to repair freeway bridge. The companies disagree that
they're at fault.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Designers and the prime contractor are responsible for construction
flaws that might delay the opening of a $12-million ramp linking the
San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways, Caltrans officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The state transportation department has told CH2M Hill, an
international engineering firm, and C.C. Myers Inc., a construction
company based in Rancho Cordova, that they must repair the towering
structure before it can be opened for traffic. The ramp is a two-way
connector designed to carry carpool-lane traffic leaving the
southbound 55 and the northbound 405.</LD>
<LD>   "We have identified apparent design and construction
deficiencies," said Pam Gorniak, a Caltrans spokeswoman, in a
prepared statement. "We have instructed the responsible parties to
submit remedial plans that address their deficiencies."</LD>
<TE>   CH2M Hill officials could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
C.C. Myers Inc. referred all questions to Caltrans. Gorniak said both
companies disagree with the department's conclusions but would not
elaborate. No lawsuits have been filed.</TE>
<TE>   The carpool connector is part of a $125-million project designed
to relieve congestion at the busy interchange of the San Diego and
Costa Mesa freeways. The improvements are a collaborative effort
between Caltrans and the Orange County Transportation Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Work was halted on the towering ramp two months ago when
construction crews found that concrete was cracking and falling off
the supporting walls that run the length of the connector. The
unusual condition is known as spalling.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said the condition affects about 5% of the concrete
that covers the bridge's reinforcing steel along the inside of the
roadway's curve. Although spalling has been found in dozens of spots,
the connector is in no danger of collapsing and no concrete is
falling off the structure.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Grebner, an OCTA engineer and project manager, said the
concrete might have been dislodged within the ramp when construction
crews using hydraulic machinery applied tension to reinforcing cables
that run through it. The tension, which is designed to strengthen the
structure, caused the cables to move unexpectedly, popping off the
cement.</TE>
<TE>   Repair work might involve as little as repouring sections of
concrete along the half-mile ramp or, in the worst-case scenario,
rebuilding the elevated road bed, except for the columns and
foundations.</TE>
<TE>   The connector was scheduled to go into service next April. But
officials said the defects could postpone the opening until the end
of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Gorniak said that as soon as the spalling was discovered, Caltrans
notified CH2M Hill and C.C. Myers. A subsequent evaluation by the
department, she said, indicated that the companies were responsible.</TE>
<TE>   Both firms have until the end of the year to come up with plans to
repair the ramp. Ken Smart, OCTA's general counsel, said the
contracts for the interchange project hold designers, construction
companies and management companies responsible for the services and
products they provide.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now we are letting the engineers and the others involved in
the construction do their thing," Smart said. "We need to come up
with a remedy. We need to get things fixed and the road opened for
the traveling public."</TE>

<KH>THE WINONA RYDER VERDICT</KH>
<HD>Ryder Found Guilty in Shoplifting Case</HD>
<DH>The D.A. plans to ask for probation, not jail time.
Actress' lawyer says he'll seek a new trial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman and Cara Mia DiMassa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Film star Winona Ryder was convicted Wednesday of felony grand theft
and vandalism for shoplifting more than $5,500 in designer
merchandise from Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills.</LD>
<LD>   The Oscar-nominated actress, who was acquitted of a burglary
charge, sat motionless as she watched the Superior Court clerk read
the verdicts. Ryder refused to discuss the case before leaving the
courthouse, saying only, "I'm sorry. Thanks for asking. I just can't
talk right now."</LD>
<LD>   Though Ryder faces a possible three-year  prison term, prosecutors
said they do not plan to demand jail time at her sentencing hearing
Dec. 6. Deputy Dist. Atty. Ann Rundle said she will ask the judge to
place Ryder, who has no prior criminal record, on probation. Rundle
will also ask that Ryder pay restitution to the department store and
undertake community service.</LD>
<TE>   "We were simply asking for Ms. Ryder to take responsibility for
her conduct, and that's what this trial has been about," Rundle said
to a herd of reporters and photographers outside the Beverly Hills
courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder purchased $3,700 worth of merchandise with a credit card
before leaving Saks with an additional 20 items that she did not pay
for. Much of the prosecution's case centered around a lengthy
videotape that showed Ryder, the star of such films as "The Age of
Innocence" and "Girl, Interrupted," walking through the store laden
with shopping bags.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder's attorney, Mark Geragos, who sped off in his sports car
with his client after the verdict, said later, "I'm disappointed and
plan to file a motion for new trial." He said he would not comment
further until after the sentencing hearing. Geragos argued during the
trial that his client was a victim of overzealous security guards who
planted evidence and lied to ensure a conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Elden S. Fox allowed Ryder, 31, to remain free on $20,000
bail until sentencing, declaring that she is not a flight risk.</TE>
<TE>   The six men and six women of the jury deliberated for five hours
on Tuesday and another 30 minutes Wednesday before signaling the
judge that they had reached a decision. The verdicts were read at
11:40 a.m. in the packed courtroom. The jurors, who included
Hollywood producer Peter Guber, did not look at Ryder as they walked
in. Afterward, they declined to speak to reporters and were escorted
to their cars by sheriff's deputies.</TE>
<TE>   "I have fulfilled my obligation to the court as a private citizen
and will have no further comment on the matter," said Guber in a
statement issued Wednesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Juror With Connections</TE>
<TE>   Guber's selection as a juror raised questions among attorneys and
producers because he headed Sony Pictures while the studio was
producing three of Ryder's films. Several other jurors also had ties
to the entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   Alternate juror Sherman Pore said Wednesday afternoon that he was
surprised by the verdicts and wishes that he had been in the
deliberation room. The defense raised many questions that were not
answered by the prosecution, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pore said he wondered, for example, why police did not fingerprint
sensor tags that matched merchandise found on Ryder and why the
security manager put two other tags found in Ryder's dressing room
back into circulation at the store. Pore also said he believed that a
key prosecution witness, Saks security guard Colleen Rainey, showed
through her demeanor that she was bent on prosecuting rather than
testifying.</TE>
<TE>   "Do I think she is guilty? Probably," said Pore, a retired
mechanical maintenance engineer. "But do I think they proved it
beyond a reasonable doubt? I don't think so."</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley issued a brief statement Wednesday
afternoon saying that he hoped the sentence would address the
defendant's problems that may have led her to commit the crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "The jury trial verdicts indicate that in Los Angeles County
justice is blind regardless of the status of the accused," Cooley's
statement read.</TE>
<TE>   Saks attorney Kenneth Metzner, who was accused by Geragos of
conspiring with security guards to fabricate evidence, thanked the
jury, the district attorney's office and the Beverly Hills Police
Department.</TE>
<TE>   "From the beginning of the events which gave rise to this case,
through trial, Saks Fifth Avenue has remained committed to doing the
right thing," he said in a prepared statement outside court. "Saks is
proud of the professionalism and integrity displayed by its asset
protection staff and sales associates involved in this matter."</TE>
<TE>   Rundle, who called six witnesses, argued  that Ryder shoplifted
the merchandise for the thrill of it and had her own "5 for 1" bonus
program, stealing five items for every one she purchased.</TE>
<TE>   Saks security manager Kenneth Evans, who came to the courthouse
Wednesday to hear the verdict, testified that he followed Ryder on
store surveillance cameras, watching her stuff socks and hair bows
into a hat and select items off racks without checking their prices.</TE>
<TE>   Security guard Rainey told jurors that she peeked through slats in
Ryder's dressing room door and saw her snip sensor tags off two
purses, cutting holes in blouses and injuring her own finger in the
process. Ryder then left the store without paying for items including
a $760 Marc Jacobs thermal top and a $540 Natori handbag, Rainey told
jurors.</TE>
<TE>   Both Evans and Rainey testified that Ryder told them she took the
clothes and accessories as research for a film role. Rainey also
testified that Ryder said, "Didn't my assistant pay for it?" The
security tapes showed no assistant with Ryder.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors were not permitted by Judge Fox to show jurors
statements Ryder signed for Saks employees that she had stolen the
merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   Rundle said the burglary charge required prosecutors to prove that
Ryder had the intent to steal when she entered the department store
on Dec. 12 last year. Rundle argued to jurors that Ryder came
equipped with scissors to cut off sensor tags and a garment bag to
conceal merchandise, but the prosecutor conceded Wednesday, "We knew
that this would be a difficult decision for the jury because we did
not have evidence of when she specifically entered the store."</TE>
<TE>   Saks guards said they did not begin to follow Ryder on
surveillance cameras until after she had purchased a pair of shoes at
the store.</TE>
<TE>   In Ryder's Defense</TE>
<TE>   Geragos, who called four witnesses, argued that there was no theft
and that his client was simply shopping that day as she frequently
did at the posh department store. Geragos suggested that Rainey
profited from the case and that Evans just wanted to appease his
corporate bosses.</TE>
<TE>   The main defense witness was Michael Shoar, a former Saks employee
who testified that Evans told him shortly after Ryder's arrest that
he planned to make up evidence to prove the charges. Rundle, during
cross-examination, depicted Shoar as a disgruntled former employee,
getting him to admit that he was suing Saks and held a recent protest
in front of the Beverly Hills store.</TE>
<TE>   The defense also called a Beverly Hills police officer and the
spokeswoman from the district attorney's office, who testified that
they mistakenly told reporters that Ryder was seen on videotape
snipping tags. Geragos insists that Saks employees changed their
stories after prosecutors realized that the tape did not show what
they thought.</TE>
<TE>   While the trial concerned relatively minor charges, it drew
reporters from as far as England and Italy, who packed the courthouse
each day and lined up outside to photograph the film star as she
walked in with an entourage.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder, who showed up in stylish suits or dresses each day, took
notes as she listened to testimony. As some prosecution witnesses
testified, she sighed and shook her head, turning back to her family
with looks of disbelief. But at breaks, she chatted courteously with
the prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   After the verdicts were read, Ryder, wearing a plum-colored dress,
looked back at her family and friends and gave a quick, almost sad,
smile.</TE>
<TE>   "Winona is grateful to her family, friends and those who have
supported her," Ryder's publicist, Mara Buxbaum said later. "She was
preparing for the worst and hoping for the best."</TE>
<TE>   Rundle said later that she believed Ryder was a nice person. "This
was never about her character, only her conduct," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The case went to trial after neither side would budge during plea
negotiations -- prosecutors insisting that Ryder plead to a felony
charge and defense attorneys holding out for a misdemeanor.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the trial had some light moments, including Rundle's
Top 10 list during her closing argument about what the law on
shoplifting does not say. Among the items: Only poor people steal,
and Saks deserves to get ripped off because it sells $200 hair bows.
Geragos mocked testimony that Ryder damaged merchandise by snipping
off sensor tags, asking jurors whether they believed his client
planned to start a line of "Winona Wear" with holes in the blouses.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, a state Court of Appeal ruled twice that Judge
Fox had erred in holding closed hearings and withholding transcripts
and jury questionnaires from the public. The rulings came in response
to legal motions from several media organizations.</TE>
<TE>   At the appellate court's direction, Fox released the
questionnaires Wednesday. All but two of the jurors and alternates
had read news articles or seen TV reports about Ryder before the
trial began, according to the questionnaires. "I am fairly familiar
with the charges and have heard that a drug aspect of the case was
dropped early on," one wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Only one expressed any feelings of sympathy toward Ryder before
the trial began. "I believe she has been vilified in the press to
some extent," the questionnaire read.</TE>
<TE>   Although the names of the jurors had been removed from the jury
questionnaires before they were distributed to the public, one
appeared to be Guber's form. "I am in the entertainment business,
former chairman and CEO of various major companies," it read. But he
added that there was no doubt whether he could be fair and objective
in the case.</TE>

<HD>School Bonds Set State Record</HD>
<DH>Local and statewide measures will provide $22 billion to
add and upgrade campuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Solomon Moore and Duke Helfand</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Start with a generous helping of sympathy for children in badly
overcrowded schools. Add a new, lower election threshold required for
passage. Toss in a big campaign push by developers and unions.</LD>
<LD>   With that, California created a recipe for the approval Tuesday of
about $22.4 billion worth of school construction bonds, the largest
amount from a single election day in state history.</LD>
<LD>   Voters approved bond issues in 90 local school districts -- 86% of
those that attempted such ballot measures. Statewide, Proposition 47,
which will provide $13 billion to K-12 systems and public colleges
and universities, won 58.9% of the vote.</LD>
<TE>   "This shows strong public support for schools in California," said
state Sen. Jack O'Connell (D-San Luis Obispo) who won Tuesday's
election for state superintendent of public instruction. "People are
still willing to invest in public education because they understand
that it is the great equalizer."</TE>
<TE>   A proposition two years ago lowered the threshold for passage for
local school construction bonds -- from 66.6% to 55% -- and set the
stage for what is expected to be a school building boom for the next
decade.</TE>
<TE>   But many districts, including Sacramento City Unified and the Los
Angeles Unified School District, garnered more than two-thirds of the
vote. Los Angeles Unified's Measure K will provide $3.3 billion for
as many as 120 new campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Some education officials said the big vote margins showed that
Californians understood how dilapidated and inadequate many public
school campuses have become. Others contend that the bond votes were
referendums on how public education has improved in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "If the schools were not showing progress -- were not being
responsible -- there would not be the public support" for such
massive bond sales, said Kerry Mazzoni, state secretary of education.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles schools Supt. Roy Romer said the 68% approval for the
local measure was a redemption for the nation's second-largest school
system, whose public image has been battered in recent years by
revelations of school construction waste and mismanagement.</TE>
<TE>   "We've frankly turned a corner enough in terms of trust and
confidence," Romer said. "They know this place is turning around."</TE>
<TE>   Well-funded campaigns also buoyed the prospects for state and
local school bonds. The California Building Industry Assn. raised
$1.6 million for Proposition 47, which was backed by about $9 million
in donations. The California Teachers Assn. raised $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a strong case that public schools were literally falling
down," CTA President Wayne Johnson said. "The California electorate
responded and said we don't want that; we want our kids to go to
school in decent facilities."</TE>
<TE>   The state bonds will provide matching funds for new schools and
renovations, mainly to local districts that were able to pass their
own bonds. The state bond measure also allocates about $1.65 billion
for colleges and university facilities.</TE>
<TE>   School districts across the state are seeking campus sites and
racing to complete funding applications to take advantage of the new
bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Even such staggering amounts of money won't be enough. About 1.2
million students attend overcrowded schools and, officials say,
school districts will need at least $25 billion to completely upgrade
old campuses and solve overcrowding problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that voters get it," said Kevin Gordon, executive
director of the California Assn. of School Business Officials. "They
know that if you don't invest in education, you'll never improve the
economy. And we've been talking about the under-funding of school
facilities for almost 20 years."</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 13 made such bond issues necessary, education analysts
say, because it sharply limited the amount of property taxes that
local governments and school districts could raise.</TE>
<TE>   Another hurdle was the two-thirds vote previously required for any
local bond measure, said Rick Simpson, an education consultant to
Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City). "It kept the passage
rate low. Anecdotally, we heard that many districts, based on
demographics and polling, sort of engaged in a self-selection process
and wouldn't even try to pass bonds."</TE>
<TE>   Fueled by a baby boomlet and immigration, California's public
schools absorbed 1 million additional students between 1985 and 1990.
So the pressure grew for change, Simpson added.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Gov. Pete Wilson called a special statewide election and
gave California a chance to vote to lower the requirement for passage
of bond propositions to a simple majority. It failed twice before
voters two years ago finally passed Proposition 39, which lowered the
threshold to 55% for local education measures.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell, the newly elected state superintendent, was one of the
sponsors of that change. Since the 55% requirement became law, many
more school districts have been able to get voter approval for bonds
and become eligible for state matching funds, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Before that, school districts only passed bonds about 50% of the
time," O'Connell said.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Rueben, an education researcher for the Public Policy
Institute of California, said districts were even less successful
before the threshold changed. She estimated that only one-third of
local bond propositions were approved before 2000.</TE>

<HD>Trial Ordered in Woman's Rape, Slaying</HD>
<DH>Judge rules there is sufficient evidence for case to
proceed against former prison inmate accused of a 1993 killing in
Port Hueneme.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former prison inmate accused of raping and strangling a Port
Hueneme woman in her townhome nine years ago will stand trial next
year on capital murder charges.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County Superior Court Judge Donald Coleman on Wednesday
ordered Michael Schultz, 33, to stand trial on one count of
first-degree murder and allegations that he killed Cynthia Burger,
44, during a rape and burglary.</LD>
<LD>   Coleman, who will preside over the trial, found there was
sufficient evidence presented at a preliminary hearing this week to
put the case before a jury in mid-January.</LD>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, prosecutors and defense attorneys said they
are eager to start the trial.</TE>
<TE>   A grand jury indicted Schultz two years ago, but the case has been
delayed for months by a variety of legal challenges and missteps.</TE>
<TE>   The delays began when a judge set aside the indictment after
ruling that the grand jury contained too few women and was therefore
defective. Weeks later, a second judge ruled that prosecutors
incorrectly filed new charges, and dismissed the case.</TE>
<TE>   The matter went before a state appellate court, which reinstated
the charges. Defense lawyers unsuccessfully appealed to the
California Supreme Court and the matter was set for a preliminary
hearing before Coleman.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors, who are seeking the death penalty, allege that
Schultz broke into Burger's condominium Aug. 5, 1993, raped and
strangled her, then set her home ablaze to try to cover up the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Schultz admitted as much during a 1999 conversation with his
then-fiancee, Therresa Mooney, according to her testimony at the
preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Mooney testified that Schultz, a former Ventura resident who was
serving a prison sentence for assaulting a police officer, told her
he raped and killed Burger and expressed concern that DNA evidence
could link him to the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't going to tell anybody," Mooney testified.</TE>
<TE>   But after a year, she broke her silence and called a police
detective.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him that I knew of a murder that had happened to a woman
named Cynthia Burger," Mooney said.</TE>
<TE>   She testified that she told the detective the killer was serving
time in state prison. She identified him as Schultz. And she
suggested that if investigators tested his DNA, "they'd probably find
a match."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators obtained a search warrant that compelled Schultz to
provide a blood sample. His DNA was matched to genetic material
extracted from semen found in Burger's body, according to court
testimony.</TE>
<TE>   In other testimony, the county coroner told the judge that Burger
died from strangulation.</TE>
<TE>   A fire investigator testified that the condominium fire was
ignited by someone setting fire to Burger's bed sheets.</TE>
<TE>   Burger's older sister also testified at the hearing, telling the
judge that her sister's jewelry, purse and wallet were missing from
her home after the slaying.</TE>

<KH>SURROUNDINGS HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME</KH>
<HD>Gallery of Stars Only Comes Out at Night</HD>
<DH>A beautification project puts artists to work painting
portraits on steel roll-up doors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Pool</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Call it Hollywood's really late show.</LD>
<LD>   Only true night owls are around to watch when this group of movie
stars drops in on Hollywood Boulevard for a little after-hours
whimsy.</LD>
<LD>   The celebrities are wearing acrylic smiles as their likenesses are
painted on the roll-down security doors of nearly 150 shops that line
part of the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</LD>
<TE>   It's part of a city-sponsored beautification project for the
beleaguered street.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble is, the stylized portraits of Harrison Ford, Myrna Loy and
others are visible only when stores are closed and tourists are gone.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder the artists who have spent hundreds of chilly nighttime
hours painting the corrugated steel doors call their growing exhibit
the "Night Gallery."</TE>
<TE>   "This is such a big project. And, at the moment, such a big
secret," lamented artist Susan Krieg, who has supervised the crew of
professional painters and muralists handling the boulevard brush-up.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the security doors were installed after the 1992 riots.
Dark and grubby-looking, they shut off the light and liveliness of
the street when shopkeepers lower them, lock them and leave for the
night.</TE>
<TE>   Even worse, they are targets for graffiti.</TE>
<TE>   When the roll-down doors began being spray-painted, a
community-based cleanup group called the Hollywood Beautification
Team experimented with placing celebrities on them to dissuade the
vandals.</TE>
<TE>   As a test, five faces were painted along a stretch of the
boulevard west of Cherokee Avenue. When only one was vandalized,
officials decided to launch the art project using an $80,000
first-phase grant from the city's Community Redevelopment Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-four doors have been decorated so far with durable mural
paints topped with an anti-graffiti coating. The artists intend to
return to paint 50 more after taking a winter break. Fifty additional
portraits after that will complete the project.</TE>
<TE>   Those who have seen the paintings are enthusiastic.</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell you that this door sure looks a lot better than that
one," said Bob Allen, a Hollywood home improvement products salesman,
as he paused to admire a door depicting singer-actor John Raitt that
is next to an unpainted door in the boulevard's 6500 block.</TE>
<TE>   Krieg, of North Hollywood, said she and her team of six artists
try to match celebrity faces with the stars names along the Walk of
Fame. The Hollywood Beautification Team provides portraits of the
stars selected to be painted.</TE>
<TE>   Some stores have put in special requests.</TE>
<TE>   "Frederick's of Hollywood wanted females. They got Eva Gabor and
Norma Shearer. The Hollywood Magic owner demanded Orson Welles. A sex
shop wanted a really sexy person. Eva Gabor was already taken, and I
didn't think Angela Lansbury wanted to go there. So they didn't get
anything," Krieg said.</TE>
<TE>   Zgan dancewear shop owner Morris Sharaf was uncertain of the real
names of the stars on his double-wide security door. "It's Tarzan and
his girlfriend and their chimp," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That would be Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan and a
1930s scene-stealer named Cheetah.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been here 22 years, and this is better than changing the
trees or putting in new asphalt. Whoever thought of this is a
genius," said Sharaf. "Even though I'm not here at night, it's a
fabulous thing they did for Hollywood Boulevard."</TE>
<TE>   Sharaf's store is flanked by paintings of Gene Autry and Frank
Sinatra.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, at Cherokee and Hollywood, a seven-door section outside a
T-shirt shop features the largest single installation: Gene
Roddenberry, Leonard Nimoy, William Shatner, DeForest Kelley, George
Takei, James Doohan, Nichelle Nichols and Walter Koenig.</TE>
<TE>   "Sadly, they don't go down until about 11:30 at night," Krieg said
of the "Star Trek" doors, which artist team members Preston Craig,
Jasser Membrano, Jennifer Snoeyink, Todd Swerdloff, Kate Jones and
Geoff Tuttle helped her paint.</TE>
<TE>   Craig, of Van Nuys, said painting realistic-looking portraits on
the three-dimensional corrugated steel roll-ups was a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   So was dealing with some of the characters who inhabit the
boulevard at 2:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "The drama of Hollywood doesn't begin at the studios. It begins at
street level," Craig said with a laugh. "Between the hookers coming
by and propositioning you and the gangbangers and the clubbers going
to and from nightclubs, we had quite an audience."</TE>
<TE>   The artists learned to look the other way when drug dealers did
their business along the sidewalk. Most of the time, patrolling
police officers kept an eye on the painters during their six-hour
nighttime stints, Craig said. So did some of the street people.</TE>
<TE>   "Some came by several times a night to check on us. Some would
just come and talk to us. I had one guy stand two hours one night
talking about everything -- art, history, the studios.</TE>
<TE>   "He was still standing there talking when a British tourist
stopped to watch. Soon he was talking to the British guy about
Winston Churchill. It was like a scene out of Monty Python."</TE>

<HD>S.F. Accuses Company of Fraud in Airport Work</HD>
<DH>Lawsuit alleges Tutor- Saliba, which lost similar case to
MTA, inflated billing. The head of the Sylmar firm says suit is
unfounded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kurt Streeter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sylmar-based construction giant Tutor-Saliba engaged in a complex
pattern of fraud and inflated its billing during work on the San
Francisco International Airport expansion, completed two years ago, a
civil lawsuit alleges.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed Tuesday by the San Francisco city attorney's
office, comes a little more than one year after Tutor-Saliba was
found guilty of fraud for its 1990s construction work in Los Angeles
on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Red Line subway. The
company was ordered to pay $51 million in damages and legal fees in
that case.</LD>
<LD>   "The public needs to send a message to companies like this," said
San Francisco City Atty. Dennis Herrera. "We are not going to be
taken advantage of."</LD>
<TE>   The San Francisco lawsuit seeks $30 million in damages and asks
that Tutor-Saliba be banned from public works projects in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Tutor-Saliba's president, Ronald Tutor, said that the lawsuit was
bogus and that Herrera was trying to unfairly capitalize on the MTA
case. He contended that the airport is happy with his company's work.</TE>
<TE>   "We've worked with that airport for 20 years, and we have a great
relationship with them," Tutor said.</TE>
<TE>   A San Francisco airport spokesman, Mike McCarron, declined
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The original airport construction contract was for $620 million.
The lawsuit alleges that Tutor-Saliba inflated the cost by more than
$100 million over the agreed figure.</TE>
<TE>   Tutor-Saliba, one of the nation's largest public works
construction firms, is also alleged to have created bogus minority
firms as fronts and to have purposely kept false and misleading
records.</TE>
<TE>   Among the new construction built by Tutor-Saliba were airport
offices, parking garages, boarding areas and a station for commuter
trains.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron said the work was finished in 2000.</TE>

<HD>Vote Could Boost Nurses' Union Hopes</HD>
<DH>Two labor-backed candidates win seats on five-member
Antelope Valley Hospital board that had blocked earlier attempts to
organize.</DH>

<LD>Two union-backed candidates won seats on the board that controls
Antelope Valley Hospital, giving new hope to labor organizers in
their struggle to form a nurses union at the 350-bed facility.</LD>
<LD>   June Snow and Don Parazo, both endorsed by the California Nurses
Assn., were the top vote-getters in a seven-candidate race for two
open seats. They replace incumbents Chairman Gary Hill and Vice
Chairman Don Bean on the five-member board of the Antelope Valley
Health Care District.</LD>
<LD>   Snow, a former nurse at the hospital, received 27% of the vote,
and Parazo, a physician, picked up 23% of the more than 76,000 votes
cast.</LD>
<TE>   The current board unanimously opposed attempts by registered
nurses in May to form a union at the Lancaster hospital and hired
attorneys to fight the unionization vote in court.</TE>
<TE>   Snow said Wednesday that she plans to introduce a motion when she
takes office in December that would effectively end the board's
opposition to the unionization effort. Parazo said he would support
such a motion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a waste of patient-care dollars," said Snow of the
anti-union stance.</TE>
<TE>   Snow and Parazo said they hope to gain the vote of another board
member to give union backers the majority they need.</TE>
<TE>   Board member Abdallah Farrukh said Wednesday he would consider
supporting such a motion, but he would want assurances that
unionization would not affect patient care.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make sure a strike doesn't happen at our institution,"
he said. "And I'd have to be convinced that a union would [increase]
the number of nurses."</TE>
<TE>   Board treasurer Steve Fox said he still believes the nurses' votes
to form a union were invalid because they were not taken in secret,
as a health district regulation stipulates.</TE>
<TE>   "The right of self-determination is a decision employees should
make in a secret ballot election," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth board member, Deborah Rice, could not be reached on
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Nurses association officials say a majority of registered nurses
filled out cards indicating their preference for a union in the May
vote, believing that the hospital had to recognize them under a new
state law. The hospital board, however, has maintained that the
district regulation takes precedence.</TE>
<TE>   In October, a state Public Employment Relations Board judge ruled
that the hospital must recognize the cards. The health care district
is appealing that decision.</TE>
<TE>   Although uncertain about having a majority of the board behind
them, nurses association officials still hailed Tuesday's vote as a
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It was only the board that was holding this up," said Liz Jacobs,
a spokeswoman for the nurses. "I would assume they'd want to move
on."</TE>
<TE>   Dwindling health-care choices in the high desert have brought
increased attention to Antelope Valley Hospital. The valley's
population grew by about 27%, to 318,000, in the last decade while
two of five area hospitals closed. Due to budget cuts, the county-run
High Desert Hospital in Lancaster could end its inpatient services by
March.</TE>

<HD>Villaraigosa Will Seek Pacheco's City Council Seat</HD>
<DH>The former legislator and mayoral hopeful says he misses
public life. A hard-fought race is predicted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tina Daunt</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former state Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, who lost the race
for Los Angeles mayor last year, said Wednesday that he will run for
City Council.</LD>
<LD>   Villaraigosa told The Times that he is prepared to challenge
incumbent Nick Pacheco in the March election to represent the 14th
Council District, which includes parts of Boyle Heights, Eagle Rock
and Mount Washington.</LD>
<LD>   The campaign promises to be an expensive and hard-fought contest.
Both men are proven fund-raisers, and Pacheco recently said he would
attack Villaraigosa's character if the former speaker entered the
race.</LD>
<TE>   For his part, Villaraigosa said he is ready for the battle after a
17-month respite from politics.</TE>
<TE>   "I was born and raised in Boyle Heights, and I've lived in this
community my entire life," said Villaraigosa, who recently moved into
the district to run for the seat. "It's a part of the city that
deserves more effective representation."</TE>
<TE>   Although some City Hall insiders speculated that Villaraigosa
would use the position as a steppingstone to run against Mayor James
K. Hahn in two years, the former legislator said he intends to
complete the four-year council term if he is elected.</TE>
<TE>   "Should the people honor me with their support, I believe I have
to unequivocally say to them that I intend to fulfill my full term, "
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor declined to comment Wednesday on Villaraigosa's
decision. His candidacy presents the mayor with the prospect of a
City Council that could include a man he defeated and a man he
ousted: former Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, who is running in the
9th District.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco, a staunch Hahn supporter, said he is prepared to face the
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel really good about it," the councilman said Wednesday. "I
just want to continue doing my job. I know Antonio is looking for a
title.... You have a clear choice between Nick Pacheco, who cares
about the community, and Antonio Villaraigosa, who cares about his
political career."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, city political pundits said they anticipate that the race
between the two will turn into "war."</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be very, very aggressive by both camps," said
political consultant Rick Taylor. "I don't think anyone goes in as a
front-runner. "Nick has the edge, because he is the incumbent and he
has the power of the office itself. On the other hand, Antonio is
somewhat of a folk hero in the community. He will be a challenger who
understands what goes into a political campaign."</TE>
<TE>   After losing to Hahn in the 2001 election, Villaraigosa -- who
spent six years in the Legislature, including two as Assembly speaker
-- announced that he was taking a break from politics so he could
spend more time with his family and work on a variety of corporate
and nonprofit projects.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, he has co-chaired an effort to build a
biomedical research park at USC. He has also been serving as a senior
USC fellow coordinating urban issue forums.</TE>
<TE>   Villaraigosa said that, although he has enjoyed the work, he
misses public office. He spent the last few months debating whether
to enter the race for the 14th Council District. Some people urged
him to run for Congress or another state office, Villaraigosa said,
but he wants to get back into politics in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe if we are going to make L.A. the great city of the
world, L.A. has to grow together," Villaraigosa said. "We have left
some communities behind. I want to work hard to do the small things
and the big things to make the district a great and vibrant place to
live."</TE>
<TE>   During last year's redistricting of council districts, Pacheco's
was realigned to include most of Mount Washington, but not the block
where Villaraigosa lived. Villaraigosa accuses Pacheco of
"gerrymandering" the boundaries to keep the former legislator in the
1st District. Pacheco denies the allegation.</TE>
<TE>   The 1st District seat is not open in the March election. As a
result, Villaraigosa moved his family a month ago to a rental house
near Eagle Rock so he could run in the 14th District.</TE>
<TE>   Villaraigosa and Pacheco have sparred before. Some of their
animosity goes back to four years ago, when Villaraigosa backed
Pacheco's opponent in the council race, Victor Griego.</TE>
<TE>   Relations worsened during the mayoral campaign, when a nonprofit
group set up by Pacheco emerged as a peripheral player in a
controversial automated phone call placed to thousands of residents
by the mayoral campaign of Rep. Xavier Becerra, whom Pacheco
supported. Pacheco's group owned the phone bank that was used to make
the calls, in which a woman impersonating Supervisor Gloria Molina
attacked Villaraigosa's mayoral bid. Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley looked
into the matter but decided not to prosecute anyone over it.</TE>
<TE>   After the incident, Pacheco went to work aggressively raising
money for his reelection bid because he anticipated that Molina and
Villaraigosa would organize against him.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Pacheco has raised more than $300,000 for his council
race. Villaraigosa, meanwhile, cannot start raising money until he
files this week to run for office.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco is also actively seeking endorsements. On Wednesday,
Richard Riordan promised over lunch that he would support Pacheco,
even though the former mayor actively campaigned for Villaraigosa in
his race against Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been loyal to me all along," Riordan said of Pacheco. "He
has done a good job on the City Council. I'm supporting him."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, meanwhile, said he believes that Villaraigosa's political
career is at stake.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Nick Pacheco will give Antonio the run of his life,"
Taylor said. "I think Antonio understands the political situation.</TE>
<TE>   "If he isn't successful, it will mean he will probably leave
public service as a career and continue on in the private sector,"
Taylor added. "I'm not saying it is a do-or-die situation, but you
only get a few chances in politics, and he's rolling the dice on this
one."</TE>

<HD>Voters Stick to Middle Ground on Growth</HD>
<DH>Statewide, several new developments are decisively
rejected. However, measures that would further tighten limits also
lose.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In a split decision on urban sprawl, California voters rejected
several large development projects Tuesday, but balked at imposing
strict new limits on home building in cities around the state.</LD>
<LD>   Voters blocked construction of thousands of new dwellings in
Ventura and Alameda counties, but in a litmus test for just how far
activists can push growth controls, second-generation ballot measures
failed in Sonoma County, Berkeley and Simi Valley.</LD>
<LD>   "Politically, this state is evenly divided about everything, and
this shows we are deeply split about growth, too," said William
Fulton, a Ventura-based planning expert.</LD>
<TE>   In deciding a mixed bag of about two dozen local growth measures
Tuesday, voters continued a ballot-box war that California pioneered
three decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   One common thread this time was that voters opted for the status
quo by rejecting virtually every growth-related measure -- whether
pro-growth or no-growth.</TE>
<TE>   That could be the result of a low turnout statewide and a sagging
economy, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "People are still concerned about growth, but they're more
concerned about economic security," said Bill Higgins, a director
with the research arm of the California League of Cities. "When it
comes down to food on the table or a pretty view out the window,
voters tend to err on the side of food on the table."</TE>
<TE>   In affluent Ventura County, which Fulton describes as the nation's
"ground zero" for growth control, voters rose up against a Ventura
hillside housing project and a canyon subdivision in Santa Paula.</TE>
<TE>   The measures, backed by well-heeled campaigns, were crushed by
about 2 to 1. Together, they would have added more than 3,600 homes.</TE>
<TE>   Slow-growth leaders said the results reaffirm their faith in the
strict anti-sprawl laws that Ventura County voters began adopting in
1995.</TE>
<TE>   "Recently, the planning decisions at the ballot box have been
better than the decisions by the elected officials," said Jim
Procter, an attorney and opponent of the Santa Paula development.</TE>
<TE>   But those who lost saw things differently.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, ballot-box planning does not work," said Margaret
Merryman, a backer of Ventura's hillside project. She stressed that
it would have preserved 3,050 acres as open space while building on
about 700 acres.</TE>
<TE>   "They may feel like it works today, because they achieved their
goal," she said of the project's opponents. "But what about the
long-range ramifications?"</TE>
<TE>   She said Ventura now could be presented with piecemeal building
proposals with no coherence, unlike the six-neighborhood, 20-year
plan she supported.</TE>
<TE>   Apart from those victories, slow-growth activists stumbled in Simi
Valley, where they lost a bid to further tighten growth boundaries,
and in Ojai, where a traffic-related initiative lost overwhelmingly.</TE>
<TE>   Results were also mixed in Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   Alameda County had half a dozen measures on ballots in four
cities, and slow-growth activists won most of them. That included a
battle to preserve hillsides in Fremont, to stop housing on a
300-acre parcel in Pleasanton and to scale back a major
hotel-and-restaurant proposal on the Berkeley waterfront.</TE>
<TE>   Confusingly, both sides won in dueling initiatives in the island
city of Alameda that centered on a 22-acre rail yard.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything's still up in the air," said open-space advocate Jean
Sweeney.</TE>
<TE>   Pro-growth forces won in the town of Tiburon in Marin County, in
Windsor in Sonoma County and in the Central Valley towns of Galt and
West Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   The agricultural Central Valley generally has not embraced
growth-control measures.</TE>
<TE>   But the losses in Marin and Sonoma counties were surprising, said
Fulton, who analyzes growth trends in a monthly newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   He compared them to Ojai's defeat of a growth measure.</TE>
<TE>   "The towns are so small and anti-growth already, that the voters
may not have seen the need to have extreme slow-growth measures,"
Fulton said.</TE>
<TE>   Fulton said he is hopeful Tuesday's results will move advocates
beyond fights about growth boundaries and get them to focus on how to
accommodate new residents within existing borders.</TE>
<TE>   That is what happened in Watsonville on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   A ballot measure that represented a compromise between
traditionally polarized groups -- preservationists and business
interests -- passed with 60.2% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   "This was really a milestone ... and hopefully it will be a new
trend statewide," said Chris Johnson-Lyons, a member of a wetlands
protection group involved in the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Detwiler, a consultant to the state Senate Local Government
Committee, said he sees the Watsonville compromise as a model of good
growth planning.</TE>

competition, which insists on winners and losers," Detwiler said.
"Communities may get results, but they don't get solutions."</TE>

<HD>Rucchin Does the Dirty Work</HD>
<DH>Center makes the difference, assisting on both Mighty Duck
goals in 2-1 victory over Nashville.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How much the Mighty Ducks have missed Steve Rucchin the previous two
seasons was evident again Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Rucchin went goal-less. Yet he was a big reason the Ducks came
away with a 2-1 victory over the Nashville Predators. What the 11,729
fans at the Arrowhead Pond saw was vintage Rucchin, which has been on
the shelf much of the past two seasons because of injuries.</LD>
<LD>   He did the bump and grind, like in his prime, behind the net to
set up Paul Kariya's second-period goal. He showed the patience of a
veteran, waiting out the Predator defense, then fed Petr Sykora for
the game-winning goal on a third-period power play.</LD>
<TE>   The assists extended Rucchin's point streak to seven games,
matching his career high.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a long year," Rucchin said. "There may be times when you
guys are coming to me and asking, 'What's going on.' But as long as
the team wins, and I can help it, that is good enough."</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin was unable to help the past two seasons, missing 110 of
164 games due to injuries. And the Ducks didn't win.</TE>
<TE>   Those things appear to be behind him. Rucchin leads the Ducks with
16 points.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone talks about all the guys we brought in this year, but to
me Steve is the guy every night," Duck Coach Mike Babcock said.</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin was big on the power play in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   Kariya passed to Rucchin in the corner. Rucchin held on to it
until Sykora was able to slip unseen on the backside. His goal gave
the Ducks a 2-1 lead five minutes into the period.</TE>
<TE>   A power-play goal in the third period, a novel idea and a big step
forward for a team that finished last with the man advantage last
season.</TE>
<TE>   "A year ago, that game would have probably been, 1-1, or worse,"
Kariya said. "That's the difference we've been talking about."</TE>
<TE>   The difference in beating the Predators, the Western Conference's
last-place team, was necessary to extend their hopes of being a
playoff contender. The Ducks started the game five points out of
eighth place and play six of their next seven games on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no question we had to win that one," Rucchin said. "Two
points is two points."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks got the two by holding off Nashville down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   The predators didn't have a shot on goal until 13 minutes 5
seconds of the first period, but ended up out-shooting the Ducks,
35-25. Nashville had 17 shots in the third period. Duck goalie
Jean-Sebastien Giguere made key saves, and caught a break when Jason
York, traded by the Ducks two weeks ago, hit the post on a power play
with less than five minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was any justice in the hockey world, that one goes in,"
York said.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't and the Ducks managed to kill three penalties in the
final nine minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Kariya scored the Ducks' first goal at 12:04 of the second period.
But it was Rucchin who did the dirty work.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve's an honest player who has more skill than your average 6-4
guy," Babcock said. "He knocks pucks down and makes good plays."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Officials Announce 2 Terrorism Indictments</HD>
<DH>Three men arrested in Hong Kong and four others in a second
case sought to use drug sales to acquire weapons, authorities allege.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Vartabedian</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Government prosecutors unsealed two indictments Wednesday alleging
that terrorists tried to use drug sales to finance weapons purchases,
including one in San Diego that charges three men with plotting to
buy Stinger missiles intended for the Al Qaeda network.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department asserted that the two cases bolster its
conviction that drug profits are helping to finance global terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The three men indicted in San Diego -- two Pakistanis and an
American from Minneapolis -- were arrested Sept. 20 and are being
held by Chinese authorities in Hong Kong, pending an extradition
hearing next week, Justice Department officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   The other indictment was brought in Houston against four alleged
members of a right-wing Colombian paramilitary group, the United
Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, or AUC, accusing them of trying to
negotiate a deal for five shipping containers of weapons in exchange
for cash and cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   "This multimillion-dollar cocaine-for-arms deal is yet another
example of the convergence of violence and terrorism with drug
trafficking," Drug Enforcement Administration chief Asa Hutchinson
said Wednesday. "We have demonstrated that drug traffickers and
terrorists work out of the same jungle, they plan in the same cave
and they train in the same desert."</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, however, declined to say whether the
three men in the San Diego indictment were linked to Al Qaeda or
known drug traffickers.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft and Hutchinson, along with FBI Director Robert S. Mueller
III, spoke at a high-profile news conference in Washington but
released few details about the two investigations.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego indictment alleges that meetings between the three
suspects and FBI undercover agents, who conveyed that they had
Stinger missiles, began around April 11 in San Diego. By Sept. 18,
the indictment alleges, the three had met with FBI agents at a Hong
Kong hotel to sell 1,320 pounds of heroin and 5 tons of hashish for
four Stinger missiles.</TE>
<TE>   The three men said that "they intended to sell the Stinger
antiaircraft missiles ... to members of the Taliban, an organization
which the defendants indicated was the same as Al Qaeda," according
to the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Stinger missiles are a shoulder-fired antiaircraft weapon
developed by the Army. The deal-making was caught on videotape in
Hong Kong, and law enforcement authorities in the Chinese territory
assisted in the arrests, Ashcroft said.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego indictment names two men from Peshawar, Pakistan:
Syed Mustajab Shah, 54, and Muhammed Abid Afridi, 29. Also named is
Ilyas Ali, 55, of Minneapolis. No details about the men, any criminal
histories, any links to terrorist groups or their role in the drug
business were released. Terrorism experts contacted by The Times said
the men were not recognized terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "If they were big fish, we would know," said Juliette Kayyem of
the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and a former
member of the National Commission on Terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The more detailed Houston indictment alleges that four AUC
officials negotiated with undercover FBI and DEA agents in Panama to
buy 9,000 assault rifles, submachine guns, sniper rifles, 300
pistols, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, 300,000 grenades,
shoulder-fired missiles and about 60 million rounds of ammunition.
The men were offering to pay $25 million in cash and cocaine for the
shipment, the indictment alleges.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office in Houston described the AUC as an
umbrella organization that consolidated local and regional
paramilitary groups in Colombia. The group, Colombian authorities
allege, has conducted 804 assassinations and "75 massacres with 507
victims." The State Department has listed the group as a terrorist
organization.</TE>
<TE>   The four men named in the indictment are Uwe Jensen, 66, and
Carlos Ali Romero Varela, both of Houston; Cesar Lopez; and an
individual identified only as Commandant Emilio. Jensen was arrested
Tuesday in Houston, and the three others were taken into custody in
Costa Rica on Tuesday after a final meeting with undercover U.S.
agents.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Bush administration has made a strong case that
terrorism is closely linked to drug dealing, outside terrorism
experts are more cautious in making that link. For example, a recent
report by the Council on Foreign Relations on the financing of
terrorist organizations hardly mentioned the drug trade.</TE>
<TE>   Kayyem said that terrorist organizations historically have sought
to draw as little attention as possible and generally have raised the
bulk of their money from charitable fund-raising, government
sponsorship and legitimate enterprises.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would you want to support one criminal activity with another
criminal activity?" she said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you get caught with one, it may disclose the other."</TE>
<TE>   But Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at the Rand Corp. think tank
in Santa Monica, said there is evidence that terrorist groups are
deep into the drug trade, noting that the ousted Taliban regime in
Afghanistan used drug cultivation to support itself and that as the
U.S. increases its pressure on funding sources for terrorist groups,
the groups are seeking to develop drug businesses.</TE>

<LD>Braving snow and crowds, thousands of Mongolian Buddhists gathered to
hear the Dalai Lama preach despite China's criticism of the visit.</LD>
<LD>   The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader spoke for more than two hours
at a convention center in the capital, Ulan Bator, that was filled to
its capacity of 5,000. Hundreds stood outside to listen over
loudspeakers.</LD>
<LD>   The Dalai Lama arrived Monday on his first visit in nearly seven
years to Mongolia, which shares religious and cultural ties with
Tibet. China occupied Tibet in 1950.</LD>

<LD>Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi lost his bid to have judges
in his corruption trial removed.</LD>
<LD>   A Milan appeals court rejected arguments by Berlusconi's lawyers
that judges are biased in the case. The premier and a lawmaker in his
party are accused of bribing Rome judges to win a favorable ruling in
a bid to acquire a food conglomerate.</LD>
<LD>   Berlusconi, a billionaire who entered politics a decade ago, has
long blamed his legal troubles on Milan's "biased" prosecutors and
judges. He has denied all criminal accusations.</LD>

<HD>Power Change in Shadow of Triumvirate</HD>
<DH>Chinese leadership is expected to make way for a new crop
of rulers. But the traditional political culture will remain
influential.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anthony Kuhn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>A trio of elderly men stares out from billboards, paintings and
statues, as political art across China heralds the upcoming change of
leadership. The works depict the three men who, during their combined
53 years of rule over the People's Republic, watched the comings and
goings of 11 American administrations.</LD>
<LD>   Intended to portray the authority of age and rightful succession,
the images of Mao Tse-tung, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin are a
visual bid to confer legitimacy on the hand-over of power to a new
generation of leaders, expected at the Communist Party's 16th
National Congress, which begins Friday.</LD>
<LD>   But the imagery also has dynastic overtones, suggesting to
observers that, despite limited reforms, the transfer of power in
China has not progressed far from the pre-modern days of patriarchs
who enjoyed lifelong tenure and chose their own successors.</LD>
<TE>   The influence of traditional political culture and the realities
of how power works in China, analysts point out, make it unlikely
that President Jiang Zemin, or any Chinese leader, would cede power
of his own accord.</TE>
<TE>   "As with imperial power, lifelong tenure has existed all along in
China, especially for top leaders," said Yu Haocheng, a visiting
scholar at UCLA. "Despite the republican revolution of 1911 and the
Communist revolution of 1949, up to the present day, this problem has
still not been resolved."</TE>
<TE>   Transitions from one generation of leaders to the next have been
periods of greatest instability for Communist states, none of which
has found a reliable method for transferring power. Of the eight
successors chosen during the first two generations of Chinese
Communist leadership, six failed to hold on to power.</TE>
<TE>   In China, generations served as natural divisions for clans in
society and dynasties in government. The Chinese word for dynasty,
chaodai, includes the character for generation. Confucian thought
reinforced the patriarchal system by requiring obedience to emperors,
fathers and husbands.</TE>
<TE>   Following in this tradition, the first two Communist leaders, Mao
and Deng, essentially ruled until they died. They relinquished
official posts but not clout. For much of their rule, they were
neither heads of state nor party; their power was too vast to be
trammeled by any official rank or title. They designated and groomed
heirs, only to replace them amid recurring doubts that successors
would preserve their legacies.</TE>
<TE>   "I, in fact, am the core of the second generation," Deng reminded
colleagues in 1989. "Because we have this core, the change of two
leaders has not affected our party's leadership," he added, referring
to his sacking of two party secretaries, both designated successors.</TE>
<TE>   Successor Chosen</TE>
<TE>   Deng not only picked Jiang as his heir but also selected current
Vice President Hu Jintao as Jiang's successor. The move, in effect
depriving Jiang of a coveted prerogative, could create friction
between the outgoing and incoming leaders and complicate the
transition.</TE>
<TE>   Jiang "feels a need to protect and consolidate his legacy as only
he can do," said Thomas Bartlett, a historian at La Trobe University
in Melbourne, Australia.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Communist Party Charter, the National Congress
elects the Central Committee, which in turn chooses the party chief.
In fact, both organizations are reduced to rubber-stamping the chosen
heir.</TE>
<TE>   Under Deng, the party amended its charter to ban lifelong tenure
for its leaders. Although the age of leaders has declined, no
retirement age or term limits have been specified. A 1982 regulation
stipulates that "among party and state leaders, we need to leave a
few old revolutionaries who are over the age limit for retirement."</TE>
<TE>   At the 15th National Congress in 1997, party chiefs reportedly
agreed that 70 should be the retirement age for members of the
Politburo Standing Committee, the seven-member leadership. However,
the rule remains sketchy and unwritten. Some party members say the
age actually was set at 72 so that Jiang, then 71, could remain in
power while ousting potential rival Qiao Shi, then 73.</TE>
<TE>   One result of each generation's clinging to power is that younger
leaders cannot take control or launch major reforms while their
elders remain alive. Accordingly, media here have made no mention of
the fourth generation of leaders that is supposed to take power soon
and continue to issue thinly veiled calls for obedience to Jiang in
the name of stability and unity.</TE>
<TE>   Some officials argue that the leadership is younger and better
educated than past rulers and governs more by consensus. They predict
that the upcoming transition will be smooth and orderly.</TE>
<TE>   But to other Chinese, rule by consensus points more to Jiang's
weakness relative to his colleagues than to democratization at the
top. The corruption-related downfall of several high-ranking
officials with ties to leaders in Beijing further suggests that
skirmishing behind the scenes continues.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been changes in the country's political culture, but
these are very recent developments," said Ma Qingyu, professor of
public administration at the China National School of Administration.</TE>
<TE>   In more modern countries, constitutional government "has tamed the
despotic and brutal nature of power, while China, by comparison,
still shows a predominantly traditional face in this respect," Ma
wrote in his recent book, "Farewell Sisyphus." Ma cited the worship
of power as an enduring feature of Chinese political culture.</TE>
<TE>   Surviving Power</TE>
<TE>   Analysts note that for Chinese leaders, clinging to power is not
just a function of vanity or greed but also of survival. In power,
officials must eliminate rivals to show their strength. In
retirement, they must retain power to protect their lives, families
and property against vengeful adversaries.</TE>
<TE>   Wang Dongjing, professor of economics at the Central Party School,
a training ground for officials, noted in a recent edition of Nanfeng
Chuang magazine that in Chinese politics, "anyone who possesses real
power, if he is not careful, will become the object of people's
plotting and be toppled when he least expects it."</TE>

<HD>Airliner Crashes in Fog; 20 Killed</HD>
<DH>A pilot and a passenger on the Luxembourg carrier survive.
Cause of accident is unknown.</DH>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LUXEMBOURG</DL>
<LD>A twin-engine plane smashed into a field in thick fog Wednesday near
Luxembourg's international airport and burst into flames, killing 20
of the 22 people aboard. The pilot and a passenger survived.</LD>
<LD>   The Luxair Fokker 50, carrying 19 passengers and three crew
members on a flight from Berlin, crashed about three miles from the
airport while preparing to land. The field is only a few hundred
yards from a residential area.</LD>
<LD>   The passenger who survived the crash and the fire that engulfed
the wreckage only fractured his hand, government spokesman Guy
Schuller said.</LD>
<TE>   "They are quite light injuries," he said. He declined to identify
the passenger.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot, a Luxembourger, was badly injured after being trapped
in the cockpit, but Schuller said his life was not in danger.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators were trying to pin down the cause of the crash, the
first in Luxair's 40-year history, airline Chief Executive Christian
Heinzmann said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything was normal," Luxembourg Transportation Minister Henri
Grethen said. "What we know is that the pilot did not signal any
danger."</TE>
<TE>   Rescue workers managed to pull five survivors from the wreckage
and rush them to a hospital, but three died of their injuries.
Fifteen of those on board were German, two were French and five were
from Luxembourg, a tiny nation of 380,000 shoehorned between Germany,
Belgium and France.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The United States has expelled four Cuban diplomats, two from
Washington and two from the United Nations in New York, the State
Department said.</LD>
<LD>   The diplomats at the Cuban Interests Section in Washington,
identified as First Secretaries Oscar Redondo Toledo and Gustavo
Machin Gomez, were given until Monday to leave the U.S., spokesman
Richard Boucher said.</LD>
<LD>   The United States declared them persona non grata in response to
the activities of Ana Belen Montes, a former U.S. intelligence
officer who was sentenced to 25 years in jail in October for spying
for Cuba, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Those expelled from the Cuban U.N. mission were Francisco Gonzalez
Garcia, a counselor, and Carlos Augusto Suanes Flexas, a second
secretary, a U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher said the men "have been requested to leave the United
States for engaging in activities deemed to be harmful to the United
States outside their official capacity" -- apparently a euphemism for
spying.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher did not say whether the Washington diplomats played any
part in the Montes case.</TE>
<TE>   Montes, who analyzed intelligence about Cuba for the Defense
Intelligence Agency, has admitted to spying for Cuba for ideological
reasons.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. citizen of Puerto Rican descent, she said she opposed U.S.
policy toward Cuba and wanted to help the Communist island nation.</TE>

<HD>Yangtze Blockage Completed</HD>
<DH>The world's biggest hydroelectric project can reportedly
begin operating next year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>China finished blocking the Yangtze River at the Three Gorges Dam on
Wednesday, paving the way for the world's biggest hydroelectricity
and flood-control project to come on line next year, state media
said.</LD>
<LD>   The controversial $25-billion dam is forcing the relocation of 1.2
million peasants living along the river's banks and will submerge
ancient villages and relics. The completion of the blocking came two
days before a crucial Communist Party congress opens in Beijing.</LD>
<LD>   State television showed dump trucks and bulldozers pouring
boulders into the dam's final opening, a diversion canal built in
1997 for boats to navigate the river during construction.</LD>
<TE>   Li Peng, the No. 2 official in the Communist Party and longtime
power industry official who is expected to retire from his party post
at the congress, watched through binoculars.</TE>
<TE>   He called the dam one of the greatest engineering feats in
history, the official New China News Agency said.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration of a country's national affairs becomes easier
when its rivers are tamed," Li said, citing an old saying.</TE>
<TE>   The Yangtze waters now flow through 22 diversion holes in the
lower part of the dam, in the central province of Hubei.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the dam, planned decades ago but begun only in 1993,
is not a practical solution to either flooding or China's power
needs.</TE>

<HD>Egypt TV Series Sets Off Dispute Over Its Origins</HD>
<DH>Mubarak aide dismisses critics of 'historical drama'
allegedly based on anti-Semitic tract.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>The holy month of Ramadan brings with it not only prayer and
abstinence but the largest television audiences of the year as
families break the daily fast with bountiful evening meals that last
for hours and are eaten in front of TV sets.</LD>
<LD>   Egypt's eight channels boost their advertising rates during
Ramadan and vie for viewers by broadcasting soap operas and
often-controversial series.</LD>
<LD>   This year, the controversy has gone international, with censors
allowing the broadcast of "Horseman Without a Horse," about an
Egyptian journalist struggling against British imperialism and
Zionism. The series, set in the Middle East of the 19th and 20th
centuries and billed as a historical drama, premiered Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   "The series presents historical facts commenting on the beginning
of Zionism," director Ahmed Badr Eddin said.</TE>
<TE>   And that is exactly what has ignited a rancorous global debate
that has reached the U.S. State Department and stirred anger in
Israel and among American Jewish organizations.</TE>
<TE>   At least some of the research for "Horseman" is allegedly based on
"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion," a century-old document
recognized almost universally as an anti-Semitic fraud concocted by
the secret police in czarist Russia. Hate-filled at best, "The
Protocols" spells out the alleged secret plans of Jewish leaders to
attain world domination and was cited by Adolf Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Ambassador C. David Welch met with Egyptian officials to
express concern that "Horseman" could inflame anti-Israeli tensions
and, if it relied on "The Protocols" for research, would present a
grievously erroneous account of history.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy reached the office of Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on Tuesday, with spokesman Nabil Osman issuing a statement
saying it was "immature" and "unintelligent" to prejudge a work of
art. The series does deal with the Zionist movement and the plight of
the Palestinians, he said, but it does not promote anti-Semitic or
religious hatred and is not based on "the so-called Protocols."</TE>
<TE>   "It is neither acceptable nor reasonable to selectively heap
accusations of anti-Semitism on artists simply because they
sympathize with the plight of the Palestinian people and thus are
critical of Israeli policies and practices," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Protocols," which Jews consider "a warrant for genocide," is
widely available in the Arab world. Scholars here say it is not used
in any Arab studies center and is issued only by poorly regarded
publishers. But critics say the presence of "The Protocols" reflects
extraordinary ignorance of or deliberate disregard for Jewish
sensitivities.</TE>
<TE>   Arabs "don't see it as anti-Semitic; they see it as anti-Israeli,"
Abdel Moneim Said, head of the Al Ahram Center for Political and
Strategic Studies, said in the Cairo Times. "The whole
Israeli-Palestinian situation is distorting everything in the region.</TE>
<TE>   "People are feeling a big insult and a deep wound, and the only
way to strike back is by doing things like this," he said. "They
discovered that this is what makes Americans and Israelis mad, and so
they do it."</TE>

<HD>A Reversal of Roles for Israel's Ex-Premier</HD>
<DH>Netanyahu, sworn in as Sharon's foreign minister, has his
sights set on a higher post in a nation much changed since he last
held power.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilkinson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Three years after he was drummed from office, Benjamin Netanyahu
formally launched his return to power Wednesday, taking the oath of
foreign minister in Israel's caretaker government but keeping his
eyes on a higher prize.</LD>
<LD>   The former prime minister's return is the latest twist in a
tumultuous political tangle that toppled Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon's coalition government and set the stage for Israel's third
national election in four years.</LD>
<LD>   With balloting scarcely 11 weeks away and nine months ahead of
schedule, Netanyahu is confronting an enormously changed Israel.</LD>
<TE>   Israelis are poorer today than they have been in a long time. They
are dying in political violence at a pace unmatched in decades.</TE>
<TE>   By any objective measure, the incumbent political party overseeing
such domestic tribulations should be in dire straits. Not here. The
candidate of the right-wing Likud Party will almost certainly become
the next prime minister of Israel, whether it's Netanyahu or his
archrival, Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   The reasons behind that apparent paradox help explain the
fundamental political and psychological changes in Israel wrought by
more than two years of dead-end fighting with the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Most Israelis blame the violence -- a relentless march of suicide
bombings and army assaults -- on Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat and his failure to reach agreement with then-Prime
Minister Ehud Barak at the Camp David peace talks in July 2000.
Whether that blame is completely justified, most Israelis have become
convinced that they cannot make peace with Arafat and that military
force is the answer.</TE>
<TE>   This is a nation founded by Holocaust survivors and informed by
repeated war; nevertheless, by the last decade Israelis were
beginning to have confidence in the survival of the Jewish state. But
the uncertainties of the last two years have revived deep-seated
feelings of fear and danger.</TE>
<TE>   "The siege mentality is back," veteran Israeli pollster Rafi Smith
said Wednesday. "Everything is covered by the cloud of the intifada."</TE>
<TE>   And with a siege mentality, Smith said, a disillusioned, anxious
public lurches to the right and becomes more hard-line. Doves become
hawks. And few Israelis are keen to alter their leadership, despite a
consensus that things are going very badly, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon came to office in a landslide with a promise to make
Israelis safe again. In the 20 months since, he launched Israel's
largest military offensive in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since the
1967 Middle East War, partly to wipe out what he views as Palestinian
terrorism, and partly to wipe out Arafat and his Palestinian
Authority. Most of the West Bank and much of the Gaza Strip today
remain occupied by Israeli forces.</TE>
<TE>   No End to Conflict</TE>
<TE>   But the violence hasn't stopped. Two more Israelis were killed
Wednesday when a Palestinian gunman who belonged to the radical
Islamic movement Hamas infiltrated a Jewish settlement in the Gaza
Strip. The gunman also was killed.</TE>
<TE>   The economy has been devastated by the war and a related collapse
in tourism to Israel. A new government report says nearly one in five
Israelis is living below the poverty line, defined as an annual
income of $11,208 for a family of four. Three years ago, the figure
was one in six.</TE>
<TE>   Still, polls published Wednesday show that Likud will probably
coast to victory in the election, tentatively set for Jan. 28. Likud
would win 33 places in the 120-seat parliament, up from 19, and
right-wing parties in general would fare well, according to the
survey by Israel's Dahaf polling institute.</TE>
<TE>   The center-left Labor Party, whose withdrawal from the government
precipitated its fall, would be the big loser. Dahaf's polling showed
the once dominant party losing seven seats to become a 19-member
delegation in parliament.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, part of Likud's assured popularity has to do with Labor's
decline. Labor isn't perceived as much of an alternative, Smith said.
Associated with a failed peace process and with the policy of making
overtures to Arafat, Labor has lost much of its centrist support,
while its left wing became disenchanted over the party's long
alliance with Sharon and Likud.</TE>
<TE>   For Labor, the next few weeks are less about winning the
premiership and more about salvaging the party, which could split
over internal differences, analysts here say.</TE>
<TE>   In party primaries to be held Nov. 19, Labor voters will choose
their leader and candidate for prime minister from among the current
party head, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, who just stepped down as Sharon's
defense minister; Amram Mitzna, the popular mayor of Israel's
northern port city of Haifa; and veteran Labor politician Haim Ramon.</TE>
<TE>   Mitzna is ahead in internal Labor polls but is seen as a leftist
who would probably get creamed by the Likud candidate.</TE>
<TE>   The more interesting and potentially nasty battle will be between
Sharon and Netanyahu for the leadership of Likud.</TE>
<TE>   Despite an intense rivalry and mutual disdain, Netanyahu agreed to
enter Sharon's lame-duck government as foreign minister. Sharon, who
holds a six-point lead over Netanyahu in the Dahaf poll, apparently
believes that he can better control Netanyahu by having him inside
the tent and less able to attack. But it's a gamble, because
Netanyahu will seize the position as a platform from which to
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Netanyahu, silver-haired and silver-tongued, wasted no time in
making clear what job he's after.</TE>
<TE>   "What people are looking for today is a way to get the country out
of the muck," he told reporters after the brief inauguration ceremony
Wednesday. "I believe I have that way."</TE>
<TE>   Netanyahu has positioned himself to the right of Sharon, much as
Sharon did when Netanyahu reluctantly brought the elder politician
into his government in 1998. The former prime minister advocates
expelling Arafat from the region and taking an even tougher line
against the Palestinians. He opposes the formation of a Palestinian
state.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, by faint contrast, promised Washington that he wouldn't
expel Arafat and has voiced support for the eventual establishment of
a small, weakened Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   The date for the Likud primary and the final Sharon-Netanyahu
showdown hasn't been set, but Sharon is eager to hold it sooner
rather than later to afford Netanyahu little time to rally his
supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon aides said Wednesday night that they would like to stage
the primary before Labor's vote to focus party members on the
Sharon-Netanyahu battle rather than on calculations about who would
do better against the Labor candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Wartime Election</TE>
<TE>   An election during war with the Palestinians bodes chaos, and the
news was greeted with a certain amount of apprehension and dismay
here. These elections are widely seen as personal contests for party
control -- a private game among politicians, as one local commentator
put it -- rather than a dispute over vision and policy.</TE>
<TE>   For the next 11 weeks, Israeli officials will be consumed with
internal politics, paralyzing all diplomacy as the intifada drags on.</TE>
<TE>   Netanyahu said Wednesday that he intends to shelve the most recent
U.S. initiative aimed at pushing Israelis and Palestinians back
toward peace talks, at least until after an anticipated American
assault on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "The question of who will govern here in the near future is more
important than perhaps it has ever been before," the country's
largest newspaper, Yediot Aharonot, said Wednesday in an editorial.
"Voters are likely to be placing their ballots in the box at the same
time as U.S. soldiers drop bombs on Baghdad."</TE>

<HD>No Olive Branches in the Grove</HD>
<DH>Jewish settlers in the West Bank dispense frontier justice
to hinder attacks. Palestinians insist they only want to harvest
their crops.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>YASUF, West Bank</DL>
<LD>The villagers gathered at first light on a road running along the
ridge of a hillside dusted with olive trees. They carried burlap
sacks, rakes and tarpaulins, and their donkeys carried ladders, as
they prepared to harvest olives with the same techniques used since
biblical times.</LD>
<LD>   They were scampering down the hill toward the trees when four
jeeps came careening down the road, churning up dust and screeching
to a halt.</LD>
<LD>   Out of one jeep hopped a red-haired man wearing a skullcap and
earrings and swinging a metal pipe -- a resident of the nearby Jewish
settlement of Tappuah. Three others carried automatic weapons.
Another settler with a grizzled beard arrived on a donkey. He carried
a machete along with an M-16.</LD>
<TE>   "Get the hell out of here!" screamed one of the men as he ran down
the hillside after the Palestinian olive pickers. When he was just
above them, he scooped up a stone and took aim.</TE>
<TE>   An elderly Palestinian supervising his sons at work propped
himself up with his cane and gestured for his family to run to
safety.</TE>
<TE>   "Yalla," Ahmed Abdullah Obya, 74, told his sons. "Let's go."</TE>
<TE>   So began a fairly typical morning in the olive groves of the West
Bank. Almost every day since the start of the olive harvest early
last month, Jewish settlers have harassed or even attacked
Palestinian pickers. These ugly encounters represent some of the most
in-your-face violence between Jew and Arab and are frequently likened
to the Wild West -- although a more geographically appropriate
analogy might be the eye-for-an-eye code of the Bible.</TE>
<TE>   Jewish settlers readily admit that they send out posses to
administer crude frontier justice to the Palestinians, but they say
such actions are warranted by Palestinian terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Arabs hit us once, they get it back a thousand times,"
said Yaacov Hayman, 48, who lives in the West Bank settlement of
Itamar, where 11 Jews have been slain by Palestinians over the last
year.</TE>
<TE>   The settlers also fear that Palestinians will use the olive trees
as cover to creep up on their homes and attack. "We live out here,
and sometimes we have to take matters into our own hands," Hayman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the olive battles take place near the West Bank city of
Nablus, where some of the most militant settlers live.</TE>
<TE>   The jeeps at the Yasuf skirmish, which was witnessed by a
reporter, photographer and peace activists, were plastered with
bumper stickers advocating the expulsion of Arabs from Israel, the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip. One settler wore a T-shirt bearing the
image of Rabbi Meir Kahane, the late militant. Kahane was the
spiritual inspiration for Kahane Chai, which is banned in Israel and
listed by the State Department as a terrorist organization.</TE>
<TE>   "Be careful. These people are mishuggah," warned a young Israeli
soldier, using the Hebrew word for crazy, speaking at the skirmish in
Yasuf to a couple of the peace activists. The army, called in that
morning to head off a clash, arrived late but stepped in between the
two groups and prevented the rock-throwing from escalating into worse
violence.</TE>
<TE>   Peace Activists Hurt</TE>
<TE>   The so-called olive wars have been waged in the West Bank since
Jewish settlements started sprouting in the late 1970s, but never
have they had such ferocity. A 24-year-old Palestinian was shot to
death Oct. 6 as he helped a neighbor pick olives in Aqraba. Scores
have been injured, among them four peace activists who were beaten
with stones and rifle butts Oct. 27 while helping olive pickers in
the village of Yanoun.</TE>
<TE>   Yet another casualty of the olive wars is the West Bank economy,
already hobbled by two years of violence and increasingly dependent
on earnings from the olive.</TE>
<TE>   The arid, stony hills of the West Bank produce about $150 million
of olives each year, less than 4% of the Palestinian economy in a
good year. But in bad times -- and these are the worst of them -- the
olives are the bedrock of many a family's household budget.</TE>
<TE>   "They will make us go hungry by preventing us from picking our
olives. It is their way of kicking us out," complained Obya, the old
man who went slinking home after the incident in the groves.</TE>
<TE>   Obya is the patriarch of a family of 27: five sons, their wives
and children, all living under one roof. Theirs is a rambling
three-story house, attesting to the $1,000 a month each that four of
the sons -- the fifth is a student -- used to earn working in Israel
before the current uprising.</TE>
<TE>   When the men had jobs, they would send their wives and children
into the groves. Olive picking is not terribly arduous work; it
involves brushing one's hands along a branch until the olives fall
into a basket or onto a tarp. Picking was more of an autumnal picnic
than serious employment. Families would gather under the trees,
bringing thermoses of tea and eating fresh figs; a fig tree is
planted on each terrace of olives to provide the snacks.</TE>
<TE>   "You couldn't build a house like ours with olives. When the work
was good, some people wouldn't bother to take a day off for the
olives," Obya said. "Now everybody is out of work. The olives are all
we have."</TE>
<TE>   The Obya family owns 300 trees, each producing on average enough
olives to give a barrel, or 5.3 gallons, of oil. Prices are low this
year because the harvest is especially bountiful and the economy
poor. Still, the oil should fetch at least $30 a barrel. (The
leftover chaff is used for fire-starter.) That means that after
expenses the family could get about $5,000 for its oil. Not much for
a family of 27, but enough to get by -- if only they can pick the
olives.</TE>
<TE>   Olive Trees Off Limits</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that about half the family's trees are near
Tappuah. The Jewish residents have decided that no Palestinian may
pick olives within a clear view of the settlement, whose red-roofed
homes are perched high on a hill that can be seen from more than two
miles.</TE>
<TE>   And the Obya family takes the settlers seriously when they say no.
In 1988, two relatives were shot in a skirmish with Tappuah
residents. The radical settlement, which is built largely on land
confiscated from families in Yasuf, has a yeshiva dedicated to
Kahane. The late militant's son, Binyamin, lived in Tappuah until
December 2000, when he and his wife were slain by Palestinian
militants.</TE>
<TE>   "We know enough to be scared of those people," said one of Obya's
sons, Wajdi. "We've tried four times to get out to pick those olives,
and each time they chase us away."</TE>
<TE>   "Those olive trees were there when I was boy, when my father was a
boy, before the settlers ever came here," interjected his father.</TE>
<TE>   Mahmoud abu Salah, the head of Yasuf's council, says many families
are in a worse predicament. "The poor people don't have anything more
than olive oil and bread," he said. "We used to grow wheat here too,
but the land was confiscated."</TE>
<TE>   About 30 minutes down a bumpy dirt road lined with prickly pear
cactus is a slightly larger town, Salfit, where Yasuf residents bring
their olives to be pressed.</TE>
<TE>   The press is an elaborate contraption that fills a garage. It
cleans the olives, grinds them pits and all, then presses out the
oil. The machine was imported from Italy three years ago at a cost of
$350,000 by an agricultural cooperative, which receives as
compensation one barrel of oil for every 10 it presses for the
farmers.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way we'll ever make back the money," said Abdul Aziz
Masri, the manager of the press. "It's a bad year. People are afraid
of the settlers so they pick their olives too early. It makes the oil
bitter and acidic. You can't export it. We can barely sell it."</TE>
<TE>   By some estimates, 13% of the West Bank is covered with olive
groves. One reason is that Palestinian landowners tend to plant the
trees to mark territory, some under the erroneous belief that the
move will prevent the land from being confiscated.</TE>
<TE>   The Salfit area used to boast the best olive oil in the region and
exported it to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   To the extent that Yasuf (population 2,300) has a tourist
attraction, it is an olive tree that legend says dates to the Roman
period. When villagers grow new trees, they graft a branch from the
ancient tree onto a sapling grown from an olive pit that is fed to a
sheep, then extracted from its stool -- a West Bank tradition that is
believed to give strength to the new tree.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians like to say that the olive tree is their symbol, just
as the cedar is the symbol of Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   "The Palestinians identify with the gnarled roots of this tree dug
deep into the land," said Arik Ascherman, a rabbi and director of
Rabbis for Human Rights.</TE>
<TE>   The olives have become a favorite cause of Israeli and foreign
peace activists. Each morning for the last month, volunteers have
traipsed into the groves, bringing cameras and cell phones, to help
the Palestinians, who are often too terrorized to call the police.</TE>
<TE>   Ascherman's group has been pushing the Israeli police and army to
be more proactive in protecting the pickers. Too often, he says,
security forces are so wary of the settlers' short fuses that they
order Palestinians out of their own groves.</TE>
<TE>   "I know they feel the same anger toward Palestinians that all
Israelis do after two years of terrorism. They may have lost friends
or relatives," Ascherman said. "But when they don't do their jobs,
they send a message to settlers that they can do what they want with
impunity. That also sends a message to Palestinians that there is no
point in going through established channels, that there is no law and
order, and in the end that endangers all of us."</TE>
<TE>   In Aqraba, also near Nablus, villagers complain that police
ignored an Oct. 5 attack by 20 settlers who surrounded six pickers,
beating them with rifle butts and stones, seriously injuring four
people.</TE>
<TE>   "I would know his face. He had red hair, sideburns," said olive
picker Atef Beni Jaber, 41, of the settler who led the pack. Beni
Jaber sustained a deep gash in his forehead, which required seven
stitches. His cousin lost an eye from being hit by a rifle.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody [with the police] took a statement from me," Beni Jaber
said. "When we complained, they said we should get a camera and try
to take a picture. A picture! Can you imagine?"</TE>
<TE>   Slain by Settlers</TE>
<TE>   The next day, the settlers struck again. This time Hani Minyeh, a
grocery clerk who was helping a neighbor pick olives, was shot and
died.</TE>
<TE>   Gil Kleinman, an Israeli police spokesman, said seven settlers
were detained for questioning in the killing and later released. A
gun belonging to one of them was seized for ballistics testing.</TE>
<TE>   "We do arrest Israelis if they are breaking the law. We try not to
make distinctions between Israeli and Palestinian lawbreakers,"
Kleinman said. There were nine arrests in the last two weeks of
settlers who allegedly attacked Palestinians or picked olives from
trees that were not theirs. All have been released on bail.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard these days to find anybody who will defend the behavior
of the settlers toward the olive pickers. Even the spokesman for the
Yesha Council, the settlers' lobbying organization in Jerusalem,
complains about the more militant communities, such as Itamar and
Tappuah, implicated in the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no control over these people," said Ezra Rosenfeld of
Yesha, though he added that settlers have legitimate security
concerns. "We are living in a reign of terror, and people have to
take precautions."</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials say the olive wars have less to do with
olives than with the struggle in the West Bank over the land and who
controls it.</TE>
<TE>   Hayman, the settler from Itamar, agrees:</TE>
<TE>   "God gave this land to the Jewish people. The minute other people
question Jewish sovereignty over the land they not only have no right
to pick olives, they have no right to be here," he said. "They can
decide what is more important to them: olive oil or [their] blood."</TE>

<HD>Pakistan Delays Opening Session of Parliament</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Pakistan's military government on Wednesday postponed the opening
session of the newly elected parliament by a week.</LD>
<LD>   The opening had been set for Friday. The government of President
Pervez Musharraf said the delay was in response to requests by some
political parties and for logistical reasons.</LD>
<LD>   Opposition leaders, however, said the delay was intended to give a
pro-Musharraf party a better chance of forming a coalition
government. No party won a majority in the Oct. 10 elections.</LD>
<TE>   Farhatullah Babar, a spokesman for the main opposition group, the
Pakistan People's Party, said the postponement was meant "to bolster
the chances of the king's party," a reference to a faction of the
Pakistan Muslim League, the PML-Q, which backs Musharraf.</TE>
<TE>   The pro-Musharraf party holds 103 of parliament's 342 seats.</TE>
<TE>   The Pakistan People's Party of former Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto has 80 seats, followed by the United Action Forum, a grouping
of Islamic parties, with 59. Smaller parties and independents
together control the remaining 100 seats.</TE>
<TE>   The Islamic alliance said that it had reached an agreement with
pro-democracy parties to form a majority coalition and that they had
put forward a hard-line Islamic cleric as their choice for prime
minister.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to delay the session followed a request by the
pro-Musharraf party.</TE>

<HD>Pentagon Moving B-2 Bombers to New Roosts Closer to Baghdad</HD>
<DH>Hangars will be built on an Indian Ocean island and in
Britain to shorten the distance the aircraft would have to fly in
case of a war with Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Hendren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KNOB NOSTER, Mo</DL>
<LD>KNOB NOSTER, Mo. -- The Pentagon is moving the jet that fired the
opening salvos of the last two U.S. wars to within easy striking
distance of Iraq, erecting tent-like portable hangars for the
batwinged B-2 bomber on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia.</LD>
<LD>   Four of the new $2.5-million maintenance hangars, each serving two
planes, will be built on the British-held isle and one at Fairford,
England. It will be the first time B-2s will be stationed overseas
instead of here at Whiteman Air Force Base.</LD>
<LD>   The foreign positioning of the radar-deflecting aircraft has been
in the works for years, officials say. But the timing suggests the
key role the B-2 is likely to play if there is a second war in the
Persian Gulf, military analysts say.</LD>
<TE>   If the U.S. launches war on Iraq, the B-2s will be critical in
taking out an antiaircraft system that has been improved with
fiber-optic communications and updated equipment and has had a decade
to adapt to the tactics of U.S. and British planes patrolling
"no-fly" zones over Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Diego Garcia is a five-hour flight from Baghdad. B-2s based there
could each make three sorties every two days, military analysts say.
It took nearly two days for the B-2s to reach Afghanistan from
central Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   The futuristic bomber -- housed at the same base the Enola Gay
left to drop the first atomic bomb, on Hiroshima in 1945 -- was
created to carry nuclear weapons into the Soviet Union. But by the
time the first plane, the Spirit of Missouri, touched down at
Whiteman in 1993, that enemy was gone.</TE>
<TE>   In both Kosovo and Afghanistan, military analysts say, the B-2
adapted well to its new mission: carrying conventional weapons in the
opening strike of a war.</TE>
<TE>   "The B-2 bomber was designed specifically to kick the door down
and kill targets," said Col. Doug Raaburg, commander of the 509th
Bomb Wing at Whiteman.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has long planned to station B-2s at three sites from
which they can strike trouble spots throughout the world within 24
hours: Guam for Asian targets, Britain for European targets and Diego
Garcia for the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Military officials wouldn't say exactly when the B-2s bound for
Diego Garcia and Britain -- as many as 16, some of them housed in
permanent hangars, out of a fleet of 21 -- will be in position. But
they will be ready "in case we get the call," Raaburg said.</TE>
<TE>   Even many B-2 advocates concede that the aircraft played no more
than a cameo role in Afghanistan, where air defenses were few.</TE>
<TE>   But Iraq has one of the most dense air defense systems in the
world. It is a hodgepodge of technology from Russia, Yugoslavia and
France. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime has installed
fiber-optic communications systems that are redundant, in case one is
destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqis have built new facilities, reinforced others and added
radar, experts say. How much of it has been destroyed by U.S. and
British planes patrolling the country's northern and southern no-fly
zones remains unclear, but those areas do not include Baghdad, where
Hussein has placed his best air defenses.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have to use the B-2s in Afghanistan because you didn't
need it," said Rep. Norman D. Dicks (D-Wash.), an unabashed B-2
aficionado. "You're going to need it in Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   After its introduction in 1993 at a cost of $2 billion each, the
B-2 was criticized as too delicate -- critics erroneously said it
couldn't fly in the rain -- and too expensive. But since the
devastating opening bombing runs in Kosovo, analysts say, it has
become the Pentagon's first-strike weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Eight B-2s could drop as many as 576 bombs on Iraqi air defenses
in the first three days of a war, seizing control of the airspace. It
takes three minutes for a B-2 to drop 16 satellite-guided "smart"
bombs. It is the only plane that can carry the 5,000-pound explosive
that crew members call "the crowd pleaser," which burrows up to 20
feet into rock and destroys underground bunkers with massive force.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts predict that after the first few days of an assault
on Iraq, the B-2s would be shuttled off to the sidelines, as they
were after performing just six missions in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   But others note that during the entire 1991 Persian Gulf War, the
plane that Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf used most to bomb targets in
Baghdad was the earlier-generation stealth fighter, the F-117,
because it could evade detection. With a second war likely to focus
far more firepower on the Iraqi capital, the B-2 would be the weapon
of choice, perhaps along with F-117s, said John Pike, a defense
analyst at GlobalSecurity.org, an Alexandria, Va., research group.</TE>
<TE>   "Baghdad is the center of gravity in this war, so I would suspect
that the B-2s would be going downtown until the war is over," Pike
said.</TE>
<TE>   Placing B-2s at Diego Garcia frees up bases nearer Iraq to host
shorter-range bombers and fighters in Qatar, Kuwait, Turkey and
Jordan. The U.S. Central Command recently made room for the B-2s by
moving B-1 bombers from Diego Garcia to Amman, Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   After the introduction of the B-2, which was built in Palmdale by
Northrop Grumman, war planners were skittish about using it. They
feared that losing a $2-billion plane would cause a political
backlash at home.</TE>
<TE>   No one knew for certain how well it would work in combat, where
the pilots are extremely vulnerable if spotted. Flying a B-2 is
something of an act of faith.</TE>
<TE>   It has no high-speed afterburner, no missiles to return fire --
nothing to protect it but stealth.</TE>
<TE>   It is called the stealth bomber because its sleek shape helps it
evade radar. Maintaining the shape of the smooth composite skin is
such a delicate endeavor that maintenance crews cover seams, rivets
and any dents from bugs or birds with radar-absorbing tape after each
mission.</TE>
<TE>   The painstaking maintenance, which would be done at Diego Garcia
in the new portable hangars, can mean the difference between life and
death.</TE>
<TE>   One kink in the body could tip off ground radar to the bomber's
location. Air Force officials believe that the only stealth fighter
to be shot down, an F-117, was struck in Yugoslavia because radar on
the ground bounced off the open bomb bay doors.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the risk to the pilots, any missions from Diego Garcia to
Baghdad would be over in the wink of an eye, comparatively speaking.</TE>
<TE>   B-2 pilots fly missions never envisioned before -- a record 44 1/2
hours to Afghanistan, by circuitous routes -- and they have forged
their own on-board lifestyle. The trips are so long that pilots
consulted sleep therapists. (They were advised to load up on
carbohydrates and sleep either less than 45 minutes or more than two
hours to avoid the drowsiness brought on by waking during a deep
sleep.)</TE>
<TE>   Pilots steal naps in lounge chairs from Kmart that they stash
behind the two seats.</TE>
<TE>   After a lengthy trek to the target, they turn around and head home
without ever seeing the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "At no other time in the world are you so removed yet so
involved," said a B-2 captain who asked to be identified by his
codename, Pita.</TE>

<CX>   Enola Gay -- A Nov. 7 story in Section A stated that the Pentagon's
B-2 bombers are housed at the same base from which the Enola Gay left
to drop an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II. In
fact, the B-2s are based at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri; the
Enola Gay, a B-29 bomber, departed from an air base on the Northern
Mariana island of Tinian in the South Pacific, where it was based.</CX>

<HD>'Unknown Child' From Titanic Finally Identified</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>HALIFAX, Canada</DL>
<LD>It has taken 90 years, the latest in DNA technology and a television
documentary to do it, but the "Unknown Child" from the Titanic has
finally been identified.</LD>
<LD>   The crew of the Canadian recovery ship Mackay-Bennett found the
body of the young, fair-haired boy a few days after the steamer sank,
killing more than 1,500 people.</LD>
<LD>   There was no identification, and the crewmen decided to take the
body to Halifax and pay for a proper funeral, burying the coffin at
the top of a hill in Fairview Lawn Cemetery, along with 120 other
Titanic victims.</LD>
<TE>   The headstone reads "Unknown Child," and over the years it has
attracted the attention of cemetery visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Now the experts have determined it was the body of Eino Viljami
Panula, who was 13 months old when the Titanic sank April 15, 1912.
He was one of five brothers from Finland who died in the disaster,
along with their mother.</TE>
<TE>   "The unknown child is now a known child, identified and returned
to his family," said Ryan Parr of Canada's Lakehead University, who
coordinated the work of more than 50 scientists, genealogists and
Titanic researchers.</TE>
<TE>   Eino's mother, Maria Emilia Ojala, and her five sons were
traveling to the United States to join her husband, John Panula, who
was working in Pennsylvania when the Titanic hit an iceberg and sank.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, producers of the television series "Secrets of the
Dead" contacted Finnish bank clerk Magda Schleifer, 68, and asked if
she would donate a blood sample for DNA testing to see if the unknown
child was related to her.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time she had heard about an unknown child, and
she said she wanted to help if she could, especially since the lost
child was around the age of her granddaughter.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Schleifer visited the grave with other relatives. She
said she knew that her grandmother's sister and her five sons had
drowned when the Titanic sank, but the family's loss became more real
when blood tests confirmed the unknown child was Eino.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been more and more a family story, and now it's more like
something really happened," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 150 victims of the Titanic buried in three graveyards in
Halifax, 45 remain unidentified. But the unknown child had always
stood out.</TE>
<TE>   When scientists exhumed the remains from the grave last year, they
found only a wrist bone weighing less than a quarter of an ounce and
three teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Parr said a copper medallion inscribed "Our Babe" and placed in
the coffin by the sailors may have helped preserve the bone fragment
from oxidation.</TE>
<TE>   "The romantic explanation is that the sailors felt so much for
that little boy that they put the medallion to make sure he was
preserved long enough for us to find him and identify him," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The family decided that the boy's remains would stay in Halifax.
"The child has been taken care of here," Schleifer said.</TE>

<HD>Conn. Family Among Dead in Train Fire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NORTH BRANFORD, Conn.</DL>
<LD>A family that perished in a train fire in France early Wednesday was
returning from a one-day visit to Paris, where the father had asked
his wife to marry him 16 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Salvatore Michael Amore, 43, and his relatives had been
vacationing in Germany, said sister-in-law Anna Marie Amore.</LD>
<LD>   "They called Saturday. They were excited. They were having a great
time," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Besides Salvatore Amore, the victims were his wife, Jeanne, 43;
daughter Emily Jeanne, 12; son Michael Bernhardt, 8; and mother,
Susanne, 72.</TE>
<TE>   Salvatore Amore was a partner in an accounting firm in West Haven
and an adjunct professor of accounting at Quinnipiac University in
Hamden.</TE>
<TE>   The Amores were killed when a fire on an overnight train filled a
sleeping car with smoke. The blaze, which killed 12 people and
injured nine, initially was blamed on an electrical short circuit.
But the French rail authority SNCF said that the assessment was
premature and that the cause was under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The train had no smoke detectors, even though cigarette smoking is
allowed in designated cars.</TE>
<TE>   The fire began three hours after the train left Paris as it passed
through the city of Nancy on its way to Munich, Germany.</TE>

<DL>ANKARA, Turkey</DL>
<LD>The leader of the party that won Turkey's weekend election refused
Wednesday to commit to allowing U.S. warplanes to use Turkish bases
in any war with Iraq and said he hoped Washington would seek a
peaceful resolution to the standoff with Baghdad.</LD>
<LD>   "The most preferred result is to resolve this issue in peace,"
said Recep Tayyip Erdogan of the Islamic-rooted Justice and
Development Party. "We don't want blood, tears or death."</LD>
<LD>   Erdogan has said his party is looking to follow a moderate,
pro-Western path. He says that while his party opposes a war in Iraq,
it would respect decisions made by the U.N.</LD>
<TE>   Turkey's military, which has close ties with the Pentagon, has
also raised concerns over a war next door, but military analysts have
said the generals would almost certainly provide logistical support
in the event the U.S. strikes Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Armed forces chief Gen. Hilmi Ozkok said Wednesday that the U.S.
should avoid a war in Iraq but that Turkey's differences with
Washington over the issue could be ironed out.</TE>

<HD>Russia, Syria Still Wary on U.N. Iraq Resolution</HD>
<DH>U.S. officials, having appeased France, work to overcome
remaining concerns as they push for a vote by the Security Council on
Friday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie farley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Security Council members Wednesday greeted the final U.S.-British
resolution on Iraq positively, with the exception of Russia and
Syria, which are concerned that language in the text could still be
used to trigger military action without U.N. approval.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. is pushing for a vote on Friday, hoping to wrap up nearly
eight weeks of intense negotiations. After reaching basic agreement
with France on Tuesday night, officials from President Bush down were
working to overcome reservations by Russia, Syria and, to a lesser
extent, China.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell canceled a weekend trip to
South Korea to oversee the high-stakes vote. "The secretary wants to
make sure he can continue to work the process, if it's necessary,"
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. "But we do expect
we'll get a vote on Friday."</LD>
<TE>   Russia's ambassador to the U.N., Sergei V. Lavrov, said Moscow
still had "deep concerns" that even after revisions, the resolution
retained language that could allow the U.S. to strike Iraq. He added
that Russia could not agree to demands on Iraqi officials and weapons
inspectors that were impossible to meet.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not there yet," Lavrov said of the resolution. "It's a
work in progress."</TE>
<TE>   Since the draft was introduced, the U.S. has amended it
significantly, incorporating changes suggested by other nations. To
allay concerns that the U.S. would use a resolution as a license to
attack Iraq without further U.N. approval, the U.S. agreed to
France's "two step" proposal that inspectors be sent in first and, if
they were blocked, the Security Council would then discuss what the
consequences should be.</TE>
<TE>   In a stroke of diplomatic "creative ambiguity," the text does not
insist that the U.S. wait for a council decision to take action
against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the changes, the U.S. bottom line remains the same: Iraq
must disarm immediately and will face "serious consequences" if it
doesn't. Though the U.S. would consult with the council if inspectors
ran into trouble, Washington reserved the right to act on its own for
self-defense, as authorized by Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking after the U.S. formally presented the revised draft to
the 15-member council, U.S. Ambassador John D. Negroponte said that
Washington had "come a long, long way" to satisfy the concerns of
other council members and that Iraq had "a final opportunity" to
disarm.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a lot of talk over the weeks about so-called
hidden triggers, that somehow this resolution is intended to be used
by the United States as a pretext for the immediate use of force,"
Negroponte said. "President Bush has said on repeated occasions that
as far as he's concerned, the use of force -- war -- would be a last
resort. He wants to give the United Nations and the Security Council
a chance."</TE>
<TE>   China and Syria echoed Russia's concerns, though not as strongly.
Chinese diplomats repeated their desire to solve the problem "through
political means," but they are expected to abstain or vote in favor
of the resolution. Syria, the lone Arab representative on the
council, has been expected to vote against it, but it showed hints of
softening in Wednesday's discussions in the Security Council chamber.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, every delegation stressed the need for
Security Council unity to send the strongest possible message to
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that his country must disarm. That
chorus raised hopes for a unanimous vote but also increased pressure
on the United States and its co-sponsor, Britain, to polish the
resolution into something that all members could support.</TE>
<TE>   "If the council this time is divided, then the mission given to
the inspectors will be much more difficult," French Ambassador
Jean-David Levitte said. "So our stated goal is to be unanimous if
possible, and we will do whatever possible to meet that goal."</TE>
<TE>   That message was an important one from France. Until a last-minute
understanding reached with the U.S. on Tuesday, it had led opposition
to the U.S.-British resolution. U.S. officials feared that if France
abstained from a vote, other countries would follow suit, weakening
the gravity of the message sent to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Though French officials hailed concessions won by Paris on
Wednesday, President Jacques Chirac has yet to formally approve the
text. Chirac telephoned Russian President Vladimir V. Putin to
discuss the new resolution, and both agreed that "ambiguities" that
could be used to trigger an attack on Iraq must be removed, Chirac's
spokeswoman said. But she added that both leaders acknowledged "many
improvements" to the draft.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's position remains a question mark. Though Moscow is not
talking about a veto, it is dangling the threat of abstention to win
further changes in the text, said an official close to the
negotiations. Russia wants to ensure that only a new "material
breach" of the resolution -- not past violations -- would justify an
attack on Iraq and that the Security Council, not the U.S. alone,
would have the power to decide on any assault.</TE>
<TE>   If Russia abstains, as it did in the 1999 vote on the resolution
creating a new weapons inspection regime, other nations with
reservations will be likely to join it. Bush is scheduled to have
what diplomats called a "pivotal" phone call with Putin today.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be more difficult for France to vote in favor of the
resolution if Russia abstains," a council diplomat said. But he added
that France would probably push for a few last-minute touch-ups in
the text rather than abstain.</TE>
<TE>   Although Negroponte presented the draft as the final version, he
said a few changes were still possible to accommodate any remaining
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The chief U.N. weapons inspector, Hans Blix, said there were
"practical difficulties" for Iraq to complete a full declaration of
its weapons within the 30-day deadline stipulated in the resolution,
especially for "dual-use" chemicals and equipment in Baghdad's
petrochemical industry.</TE>
<TE>   Blix has also questioned whether provisions allowing inspectors to
take Iraqi scientists and family members out of the country for
interviews are practical or legal. But Washington seems committed to
keeping the clause, which is designed to shelter knowledgeable Iraqis
from government intimidation. Negroponte emphasized that it was not
an "obligation" for Blix's team, but an "opportunity" should he
choose to use it.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has stayed largely behind
the scenes in the past few weeks, said he hoped the council would
speak with one voice.</TE>
<TE>   "I would prefer to see a unanimous decision, 15 to 0," Annan said.
"That is when we are really effective."</TE>

<HD>The Fed Issues a Rate Cut Surprise</HD>
<DH>The benchmark interest rate is trimmed half a point to its
lowest level since 1961. Businesses, not consumers, most likely will
be affected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter G. Gosselin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Federal Reserve ended almost a year on the sidelines Wednesday by
cutting its benchmark interest rate a surprising half-point to just
1.25% and acknowledging that it worries that the nation's economic
recovery is faltering.</LD>
<LD>   The central bank's policymaking Federal Open Market Committee
acted after two months of rising unemployment, falling consumer
confidence and a new nose dive by American manufacturers suggested
that the economy has been unable to sustain the growth spurt it put
on earlier this year.</LD>
<LD>   The 12-member panel voted unanimously to cut the signal-sending
federal funds rate to its lowest level since July 1961.</LD>
<TE>   Policymakers suggested that the new rate cut was all that was
needed to coax the country back to economic health and that no
further reductions were planned.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's ... monetary easing should prove helpful as the economy
works its way through this current soft spot," a Fed statement said.</TE>
<TE>   But the unexpectedly large rate cut -- and the suggestion that
this was the last one -- appeared to disconcert some investors. The
Dow Jones industrial average wobbled back and forth across the
loss-gain line several times in the hours after the Fed decision. The
Dow ultimately closed up 92.74 points, or 1.1%, at 8,771.01.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fed is taking out an insurance policy against weakness in the
economy that might accumulate," said Allan Meltzer, an economist at
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh who has finished the first
volume of a history of the central bank.</TE>
<TE>   Economists said the policymakers' latest action was unlikely to
result in steep new reductions in the rates that most Americans see.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they're going to get a big drop in mortgage rates,"
said Doug Duncan, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Assn. of
America. Instead, analysts said, the central bank hoped the new cut
would help revive corporate investment by lowering business borrowing
costs.</TE>
<TE>   The latest cut in the funds rate, the interest banks charge one
another for overnight loans, is the 12th since the Fed began reducing
rates in early 2001 in hopes of protecting the economy from the
fallout of the tech- sector bust and stock market crash of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But it is the first since Dec. 11, when the central bank said
weakness in demand for goods and services showed "signs of abating."</TE>
<TE>   In the 11 months since then, weakness in consumer demand did more
than abate; it vanished in a wild frenzy of spending as Americans
borrowed to buy near-record numbers of houses and new autos. But
spending by businesses has shown only a slight sign of improvement.</TE>
<TE>   In an encouraging sign late Wednesday, computer network giant
Cisco Systems Inc. said it made a larger-than-expected profit in its
fiscal first quarter ended Oct. 26, in contrast to its
multimillion-dollar loss a year earlier. But economists doubted that
either the Cisco news or the new Fed action spelled the start of a
quick turnaround for corporate America.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't expect any sharp bounce-back in business confidence and
hiring," said Bank of America Corp. economist Mickey D. Levy.
"Monetary policy doesn't work that fast."</TE>
<TE>   The size of policymakers' latest cut and the fact that it came
when the funds rate was already at a 41-year low set off a debate
over whether the Fed is truly worried about the economy or convinced
that recovery is around the corner.</TE>
<TE>   Optimists cited the Fed's statement, and especially its use of the
phrase "soft spot"' to describe the economy's condition, as evidence
that there is no serious problem.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Soft spot' implies something temporary," said Dean Maki, a
former Fed economist who is now an economist with Putnam Investments
in Boston. "They see this as a temporary deterioration in the data
and believe conditions will improve in a few months."</TE>
<TE>   But pessimists said the size and timing of the cut suggested that
the central bank believes the economy may be headed for trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "The size alone tells you that the data was sufficiently bad that
they thought they had to act decisively," said Goldman Sachs
economist Ed McKelvey. "They had all sorts of reasons for cutting
only half as much."</TE>
<TE>   Fed officials and outside analysts repeatedly have said the U.S.
must avoid the fate of Japan, whose central bank failed to grasp the
destructive power of the country's stock crash and real estate bust
of the early 1990s and failed to cut interest rates fast enough to
avert a crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed appeared to be acting out of concern for not repeating the
Japanese experience when it repeatedly slashed the funds rate in
2001, reducing it from 6.5% to 1.75%.</TE>
<TE>   But then it stopped cutting. Although minutes of some of their
meetings this year show that Fed policymakers continued to study
parallels between the Japanese and American stock crashes, they
apparently believed they had done enough to prevent a similar
economic fate. Japan's economy has been stagnant for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Pessimists said Wednesday that the fact that the Fed resumed its
rate cuts showed that the central bank had concluded it may not have
done enough after all and that the United States could face a
downward economic spiral similar to Japan's.</TE>
<TE>   If it does, these pessimists said, policymakers could be forced to
take a series of drastic steps. Among the possibilities: reducing
interests rates to near zero; enacting large tax cuts on top of those
approved last year; and a Fed-engineered flooding of the banking
system with credit, as occurred after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>

<HD>More Teamwork Expected From Davis</HD>
<DH>Returned to office by a slim margin, he faces budget
troubles and a polarized Legislature. 'It has to be a new day,' one
legislator says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Morain</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis, wounded by a shaky reelection showing, will face a
budgetary morass in his second term, a more combative group of
Republican legislators and fewer Democratic allies than he's used to,
lawmakers and others said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Failing to receive 50% of the votes cast Tuesday, the Democratic
governor bested his Republican challenger, political novice Bill
Simon Jr., by a margin of merely 5%. Four Democrats who won statewide
office Tuesday received more votes than Davis.</LD>
<LD>   Adding to his woes, Davis will confront a Legislature likely to be
more polarized, with larger numbers of liberals and conservatives,
than he has faced in his first term.</LD>
<TE>   "He is going to have to rehabilitate himself," Sen. Don Perata
(D-Alameda) said Wednesday. "It has got to be a new day."</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference Wednesday, Davis did not appear to be
particularly chastened by the narrowness of his victory. But he
struck a somewhat conciliatory tone as he pledged to improve schools
and expand health care for poor people -- "within the financial
limits that the economy is providing."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to work hard with people on both sides of the aisle,"
Davis said. "That's what voters expect."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' second term is starting out to be far different from the
one that followed his election in 1998. He swept into office then
with a 20-point landslide, giving Democrats control of Sacramento for
the first time in 16 years. He arrived in office to find a
multibillion-dollar budget surplus, a bounty that allowed him to cut
taxes and expand an array of programs.</TE>
<TE>   Emboldened by circumstances, Davis at times seemed to treat the
Legislature as an extension of his administration, rather than as an
equal branch of government. He went so far as to complain to the San
Francisco Chronicle editorial board in 1999 that the Legislature had
refused to follow his moderate course.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a totally different view of the world than I do,
totally different," Davis said. "It was my vision that commanded a
20-point victory, the largest victory in 40 years. People expect
government to reflect the vision that I suggested. Nobody else in the
Legislature ran statewide. Their job is to implement my vision. That
is their job."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, legislators recalled that statement with some
derision and pointedly noted that, on Tuesday, Davis received fewer
votes that four down-ballot officials, all Democrats -- Lt. Gov. Cruz
Bustamante, Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, Treasurer Phil Angelides and
Sen. Jack O'Connell (D-San Luis Obispo), who was elected
superintendent of public instruction.</TE>
<TE>   "Looks like Bill Lockyer is the new leader of the Democratic
Party," said Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga.
"Guess we'll be implementing Jack O'Connell's vision," said Senate
President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco).</TE>
<TE>   The Senate is led by Burton and other Democrats who are more
liberal than the centrist governor. Democrats appear to have retained
a 26-14 majority in the upper house, though Republicans could pick up
a seat if a close race in the San Joaquin Valley shifts, once
absentee votes are tallied.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats also hold a majority in the Assembly, expected to be 48
to 32. That represents a gain of two seats by Republicans. While that
shift is small, it could make Davis' task more difficult next summer
when he pieces together support for his budget proposal, which must
pass both houses by a two-thirds vote.</TE>
<TE>   Although Davis refused Wednesday to say whether he would propose
tax increases, some aides say privately that they don't see how the
budget gap can be closed otherwise. The shortfall in the coming year
could rival this year's budget gap of $24 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Republicans are going to be in any mood to deal
with this guy," said Sacramento consultant Wayne Johnson, who
represents several Republican legislators. "It will be a long time
before Gray Davis gets Republican votes on a budget if it raises
taxes."</TE>
<TE>   Davis and the Legislature failed to reach a budget compromise this
year until September, two months past the constitutional deadline for
establishing a budget.</TE>
<TE>   To obtain the two-thirds majorities in the Senate and Assembly,
Davis needed support from all Democrats, plus one Republican senator
and four Assembly Republicans. Four of the five Republican
legislators who voted for that budget were lame ducks, forced to
retire by term limits. Their replacements are expected to be more
partisan.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a big budget deficit and there are no longer any
independent Republicans," Burton said. "They're hard-line people, so
it is going to be tough."</TE>
<TE>   The coming budget battle could be made more contentious by
turnover in the administration, especially if Finance Director Tim
Gage and Cabinet Secretary Susan Kennedy depart, as some expect, and
Davis fails to find respected replacements. Gage and Kennedy
generally have had good relations with legislators and have been
instrumental in piecing together past budgets.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Davis has alienated some allies, notably
Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles), who won a state Senate seat
Tuesday. The governor is losing other friendly legislators, including
Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), forced by term limits to
retire.</TE>
<TE>   Several moderates are also leaving, among them Assemblyman Dennis
Cardoza (D-Modesto), who worked with Davis to block or temper
legislation pushed by liberal legislators. Cardoza won the
congressional seat held by Rep. Gary Condit (D-Ceres).</TE>
<TE>   "It really was an imperial performance," Sen. Perata said of
Davis' first term. "Now, fast-forward to today, he would be well
advised to work with us. He and his staff need to immediately open up
to the leadership to Senate and Assembly."</TE>
<TE>   At least some of Davis' friends echo that advice, suggesting that
he become a more humble leader. This is not a time for Davis to make
demands on legislators, said Phil Trounstine, who was Davis'
communications director for two years during his term. Rather, he
predicted, Davis will become more collaborative. "Don't be
surprised," said Trounstine, "if you hear strains of 'Kumbaya'
wafting from across Capitol park."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Trauma Care Network Is Revived, but at a Cost</HD>
<DH>Measure B, which adds to property tax, extends a lifeline.
Union support makes job cuts difficult.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A decisive vote in favor of a new property tax has recast the debate
over Los Angeles County's foundering health-care system, probably
saving two full-service public hospitals from closure -- at least for
now.</LD>
<LD>   Measure B, which passed with 73.2% of the vote, earned more
support than any other initiative or candidate in the county. The
measure, which is expected to generate $168 million annually,
apparently resonated with voters who feared collapse of emergency and
trauma-care services in the nation's second-largest health system.</LD>
<LD>   "Yesterday we were talking about closing hospitals," Supervisor
Zev Yaroslavsky said at a news conference Wednesday morning. "Today,
we can talk about how to keep them open."</LD>
<TE>   Measure B, however, doesn't solve all the county's budget woes:
The county Department of Health Services still faces a deficit of
$332 million to $582 million in three years.</TE>
<TE>   The approval also leaves county supervisors indebted to a key
labor union, which donated about three-quarters of the $2 million
spent to promote the proposition, making it even tougher for
supervisors to cut jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the federal government made it clear Wednesday that it
would not step in to fill the budget hole.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no plans to be a knight in shining armor," said Tom
Scully, administrator of the U.S. Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid
Services, who toured some of the county's public hospitals Wednesday,
including Harbor-UCLA Medical Center near Torrance. "I don't expect
to be a savior or hero."</TE>
<TE>   Scully commended voters for approving Measure B but made it clear
that he still opposed the county's request for a $1.4-billion
bailout. He also demanded that the county make its system more
efficient. The county health department serves about 800,000 people a
year, most of them poor patients without insurance.</TE>
<TE>   We need to "come up with a responsible fix that doesn't waste
taxpayers' money," Scully said.</TE>
<TE>   The only agreement to come out of the supervisors' meeting with
Scully at Harbor-UCLA was to continue private negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   County health officials said their negotiating position was
strengthened by county voters' willingness to directly tax their
property -- the first such decision since passage of tax-slashing
Proposition 13 in 1978. Yaroslavsky said the approval was all the
more remarkable because the late Howard Jarvis, one of the promoters
of Proposition 13, based his movement in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The county's dire financial straits became apparent in recent
months when officials shut 11 community clinics, opted to convert
High Desert Hospital in Lancaster to an outpatient facility and
decided to shut the Rancho Los Amigos rehabilitation center in
Downey.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with the prospect of closing two of the county's four
full-service public hospitals -- Harbor-UCLA and Olive View-UCLA
Medical Center in Sylmar -- supervisors voted 3 to 2 in July to put
Measure B on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative imposes a tax of 3 cents per square foot on
residential and commercial property, or about $42 a year for a
1,400-square-foot home.</TE>
<TE>   Proceeds from Measure B must be used solely for emergency rooms,
trauma centers and bioterrorism preparedness.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of running an organized campaign, opponents gambled that
it was unlikely the measure would pass with the two-thirds vote
necessary to raise property taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Even supervisors who supported the measure didn't think they could
reach this goal. But backers say the measure's prospects improved two
weeks ago when a union-backed coalition began running a television ad
that dramatized people's fears.</TE>
<TE>   The ad showed a sweating paramedic in an ambulance making an
urgent radio call about the injured child he's treating -- only to be
told that the nearest hospital is closed to trauma patients. A
dispatcher directs him to another hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too far!" the paramedic says, as the boy's distraught mother
looks on.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very emotional," said Robert Blendon, a health-policy
professor at Harvard University. "People can understand that."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Don Knabe, who initially opposed the ballot measure but
switched sides days before the election, said he was "really
surprised by the depth and scope of the victory." He said voters
understood that they may be "one heart attack, one car wreck, one of
God's winks" away from needing the trauma network, which has dwindled
from 22 hospitals in 1985 to 13.</TE>
<TE>   County supervisors heaped much of the credit for the victory on
the Service Employees International Union, whose local 660 represents
19,000 county medical workers, among them nurses and laboratory
technicians.</TE>
<TE>   But county supervisors may have boxed themselves into a corner.
The most costly element of the health-care system is labor, but the
supervisors' political alliance with the union makes deep job cuts
unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders want the county to revoke its decision to close High
Desert Hospital and Rancho Los Amigos. Both public hospitals do not
have ERs.</TE>
<TE>   If hospitals and employees must be spared, that would leave few
places to cut. One prime candidate may be funding for a network of
private clinics.</TE>
<TE>   But then, the county runs the risk of breaking a promise it made
in 1995 to the federal government to shift its massive health-care
system away from costly hospital care to less expensive outpatient
treatment. That pledge was made in exchange for two bailouts of more
than $2 billion from the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   By 9 a.m. Wednesday, Local 660 officials had already printed
stickers directed at President Bush and Gov. Gray Davis: "We did our
part ... Now you do yours! Keep our communities healthy!"</TE>
<TE>   Davis told reporters Wednesday that his administration is working
on a plan to improve the health-care systems in Los Angeles and other
counties. Davis said the resulting proposal may be presented to a
special legislative session.</TE>
<TE>   The governor stressed that "we cannot keep the public health
system viable in Los Angeles without full participation by the
federal government. They have to be the senior partner."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at Harbor-UCLA, Scully blamed the state for diverting
federal money to its own coffers, rather than sending it to public
and private hospitals in Los Angeles County that serve a large number
of poor people.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's top health-care official, Grantland Johnson,
insisted that the money was properly spent.</TE>
<TE>   Scully also visited Olive View-UCLA, where the hospital's top
medical staff explained that the hospital's emergency room receives a
crush of patients every day and night.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting in the emergency room with about 55 others was a Reseda
man, Joe Harriman, with a bandage around his left pinkie, crushed
Wednesday while he was working on a car.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine the Valley without this hospital," said Harriman,
22. "We need this place."</TE>

<HD>Humbled in Victory, Davis Tries New Tack</HD>
<DH>'I do want to lead this state to a better place,' governor
says, pledging a bipartisan approach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Matea Gold and Gregg Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a chastening reelection in which voters rebuked his tenure and
campaign, Gov. Gray Davis on Wednesday called his victory "an honor
and a humbling experience" and pledged to work in a spirit of
bipartisanship during his second term.</LD>
<LD>   At a midmorning news conference at a Century City hotel, where
Democrats on Tuesday night celebrated their potential sweep of
statewide offices, Davis promised to be a "governor for all the
people, whether they voted for me or not."</LD>
<LD>   "I do want to lead this state to a better place than where I found
it," he said. For his part, Simon remained out of public view
Wednesday, as he visited supporters and thanked them for their
efforts.</LD>
<TE>   The governor, who beat GOP challenger Bill Simon Jr. just 47.4% to
42.4% in Tuesday's election, did not appear shaken by the close
results, which followed weeks of predictions by his advisors that he
would soundly defeat the Republican gubernatorial nominee.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis' slim margin of victory in an election with a record low
turnout underscored a deep discontent within the California
electorate. Three out of five voters said they have an unfavorable
impression of the man they sent back to the governor's office,
according to an exit poll conducted by The Times. Slightly more than
a third said their main reason for voting for him was merely to pick
the best of a bad lot of candidates. One in 10 voters cast a ballot
for a third-party candidate -- three times as many as did so four
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Many Californians, voting officials said, simply didn't bother to
go to the polls Tuesday. With about 500,000 absentee and provisional
ballots still uncounted, the secretary of state's office estimated
the final voter turnout at 50% to 53% -- substantially lower than the
record low of 58% in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, the voters spoke with silence this year," said
Beth Miller, chief assistant secretary of state.</TE>
<TE>   Electorate Split</TE>
<TE>   Despite voter frustration with the nasty tone of the campaign and
a slew of Republican victories across the country, the 2002 elections
showed anew that California's electorate is split down the spine of
the state. Davis captured the strip of counties along the state's
coast that is home to its urban centers; 14 of the 18 counties that
Davis won abut either the Pacific Ocean or San Francisco Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, in contrast, won the inland counties from the northern
reaches of the state to San Bernardino and Riverside; he also won
chunks of the coastline, including the counties of San Diego, Orange,
Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a huge Republican prairie fire coming out this way, and
we kind of braked it, right at the Sierra Nevada," said Davis
political strategist Garry South, referring to the GOP gains
elsewhere in the country.</TE>
<TE>   In California, by contrast, voters handed Democrats a potential
takeover of statewide offices. Incumbent Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante
beat GOP challenger Bruce McPherson, 49.5% to 41.7%. Kevin Shelley
overcame Keith Olberg for secretary of state, 46.3% to 42.3%.
Incumbent Phil Angelides held on to his job of state treasurer with
49.4% of the vote; challenger Phillip Gregory Conlon garnered 40.5%.
Similarly, Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer won reelection over Dick Ackerman,
51.4% to 40.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Onetime Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi recaptured his old
office, beating GOP hopeful Gary Mendoza, 46.6% to 41.6%. And in the
nonpartisan race for superintendent of public instruction, Democrat
Jack O'Connell trounced Republican Katherine Smith, 61.8% to 38.2%.</TE>
<TE>   The only statewide race that remained up in the air Wednesday was
the contest for state controller, where Democrat Steve Westly held a
slight 26,000-vote lead over Republican Tom McClintock. Officials at
the secretary of state's office said the results would not be
complete until the end of the week, at the earliest, when the
outstanding ballots are due to be processed.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the Democratic domination, GOP leaders refused to concede
that the losses meant their party is troubled. They noted the close
returns in many contests and the apparent gain of a few seats in the
state Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is a great election for California Republicans," said
Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte. "Gray Davis won by five points.
Most governors win reelection by a landslide."</TE>
<TE>   The difference between Davis' 20-point romp over Republican Dan
Lungren in 1998, and his squeaker this year was evident across the
state. The governor won 1.7 million fewer votes Tuesday than he did
four years ago, a stark verdict that will probably not change
markedly, once the final votes are counted.</TE>
<TE>   In many counties, Davis' share of the electorate dropped 10 points
or more from 1998. This year, many of those votes went to Simon in
conservative areas, but moderate and liberal voters switched their
allegiance to the Green Party candidate, Peter Camejo.</TE>
<TE>   In San Bernardino, for example, Davis pulled 53% of the vote in
1998 and only 41% on Tuesday. Simon won 50%, seven points more than
Lungren had. In Sacramento County, Davis' share of the vote fell from
57% to 42%, and Simon gained six points over Lungren.</TE>
<TE>   In Alameda County, one of the state's Democratic strongholds and a
place where Davis overwhelmed Lungren 73% to 23%, the governor beat
Simon 62% to 22%. Camejo won 11% of the vote, substantially more than
the 1.8% that Dan Hamburg, his predecessor as Green Party nominee,
received in 1998. In San Francisco, Camejo captured second place over
Simon with 16% of the vote, and Davis' share of the electorate
dropped from 80% in 1998 to 66% Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Davis insisted that his victory -- no matter how narrow -- was a
vindication for his administration during a year when voters rejected
both incumbent governors and Democrats in other parts of the country.</TE>
<TE>   "There were at least 15 changes in statehouses across the country,
from one party to another," Davis told reporters. "When people are
feeling some angst, they make changes. That's why I'm so proud that
the Democratic ticket held strong. The people were still willing to
put their faith in us."</TE>
<TE>   He praised California Democrats for withstanding "a national tide"
of Republican victory and credited President Bush with steering the
GOP to its historic midterm victory in congressional races.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to give credit where credit is due," the governor said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' campaign aides, brought to the defensive by the tight
victory, said focusing on the margin misses the larger significance
of the potential Democratic sweep in statewide races.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't see it as a hobbled mandate," one senior Davis aide
said. "I see it as an empowering mandate, particularly in regards to
where the rest of the country is."</TE>
<TE>   South attributed the margin to a low Democratic turnout, a
phenomenon in a number of states where Democrats were defeated
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   No Real Message</TE>
<TE>   "Democrats, for some strange reason, didn't go out and vote in the
force that we thought they would," South said. "My only theory is, I
don't think the national Democrats had a real message in this
campaign. You had people running for the Senate out there saying, 'I
support Bush on Iraq, I support the tax cut. I support the president
on this.' Well, OK, why not just elect a Republican?"</TE>
<TE>   Davis may be required to govern differently in his second term,
political analysts said, especially as he approaches the state's
looming budget shortfall. But Davis has served in public office for
decades, making it hard for some to imagine how he will change now.
On Wednesday, he gave few clues: He alluded, for instance, to the
budget problems, but would not detail how he intends to address them.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans said the weak affirmation for Davis' second term
signals a strong dissatisfaction with the incumbent governor that
could have been exploited by a stronger challenger. Given the
circumstances, Simon's defeat was destined to inspire a traditional
postelection round of consternation about the party's future
direction.</TE>
<TE>   "It is so obvious that simply an adequate, not a brilliant,
campaign would have prevailed against Davis," said a GOP consultant,
Arnold Steinberg.</TE>
<TE>   Some party leaders predicted the close returns would energize the
state GOP, which has been riven by in-fighting and ideological
differences. In two years, California Republicans will be ready to
mount a serious effort for President Bush's reelection, said Duf
Sundheim, head of the Lincoln Club of Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   "We just weren't there this time," Sundheim said. "That's just the
reality.... It was kind of like, you're working on a ship when the
war starts, and the ship is just three-quarters of the way finished."</TE>
<TE>   However, in a sign of the internal feuding that surfaced regularly
in the campaign, state GOP Chairman Shawn Steel blasted other party
leaders for failing to raise more money for the Republican ticket,
criticizing what he called an "anti-conservative" attitude among
Bush's surrogates in California.</TE>
<TE>   "The ticket was ideal," he said. "We just needed a better ground
game. One of the great tragedies in this election was our ground game
was anemic compared to the Democrats'."</TE>
<TE>   But Rob Stutzman, the Republican consultant who serves as
spokesman for the state party, said he "couldn't disagree more" with
Steel's remarks.</TE>
<TE>   "We begin today working not to tear each other down, but to
build a party that can deliver the state for the president in 2004," he
said. "That's what I believe most party leaders are committed to."</TE>
<TE>   Both parties will have to make significant efforts to engage the
electorate before that race. Voters surveyed Tuesday expressed
disgust with their options in this year's contest, with
overwhelmingly negative views of both major party candidates,
according to The Times exit poll.</TE>
<TE>   When asked which candidate would do a better job on
bread-and-butter issues like education, energy and crime, between a
quarter and a third of voters said "neither."</TE>
<TE>   The electorate was dramatically different from the one that
elected Davis in 1998, with whites making up three-quarters of the
voters, up from 64% four years ago. The share of Latino voters
dropped from 13% to 10%, and blacks from 13% to just 4%. Asian
turnout fell slightly, from 8% of voters to 6%. Those numbers suggest
that Democrats failed to energize much of the party's minority base.</TE>

<TE>   How the poll was conducted: The Times Poll interviewed 3,444
voters as they left 60 polling places across California during voting
hours Tuesday. Precincts were chosen based on the pattern of turnout
in past statewide elections. The survey was by a confidential,
self-administered questionnaire in English and Spanish. The margin of
sampling error for percentages based on the entire sample is plus or
minus 2 percentage points; for some subgroups the error margin may be
somewhat higher. Because the survey does not include absentee voters

<HD>State Stands Alone Against GOP Tilt</HD>
<DH>Staunchly Democratic California could face indifference
from the Congress and Bush. But, in the end, it is too important to
ignore.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Z. Barabak</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1949, author Carey McWilliams published his classic work on
California, calling the bumptious, booming state "The Great
Exception." On election day, California proved itself the exception
once more.</LD>
<LD>   While the rest of America tilted Republican, the great contrarian
state emphatically backed Democrats, rewarding the party with
possibly its first ticket-wide sweep in more than 100 years.</LD>
<LD>   There may be consequences to this quirkiness -- and not just
adding to the state's shopworn image as the far-out land of tofu and
hot tubs.</LD>
<TE>   The Bush White House, which has never shown much affinity for
California, has even less incentive to pay attention now as
strategists begin plotting the president's reelection plan. "The
problem is the state is such a sinkhole for money," said one White
House political advisor.</TE>
<TE>   California's debilitated GOP -- its chairman openly at war with
the president's top man in the state -- has been all but
disenfranchised by party leaders in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, where California has long engendered hostility,
the state's overwhelmingly Democratic congressional delegation is an
even more distinct minority in the new, more Republican Congress.
Instead of pushing for new environmental protections or expanded
abortion rights, liberal lawmakers may end up fighting efforts to
roll back current laws.</TE>
<TE>   The infamous "ABC Syndrome," as in "Anywhere But California," may
soon have added adherents. The state will find out in the next few
months when it comes calling for help with Los Angeles' health-care
crisis, California's continuing water needs, and efforts to recoup
money lost in last year's energy crunch.</TE>
<TE>   And yet the saving grace -- what has long been California's saving
grace -- is its sheer size and import: physically, economically and
psychologically.</TE>
<TE>   "You just can't turn your back on it," said Republican campaign
strategist Scott Reed, who managed Bob Dole's unsuccessful 1996
presidential campaign, which ended in a California drubbing.
"Republicans nationally cannot afford to write off those 55 electoral
votes before Labor Day. It takes too many other states to make them
up."</TE>
<TE>   Democrat Barbara Boxer, the state's junior United States senator,
agreed. "They said that would happen after 2000," when Bush lost
California in a landslide. "It didn't. It can't."</TE>
<TE>   With Tuesday's results, California's leadership is now one of the
most thoroughly Democratic of any state. Hawaii and Maryland, two
long-standing party bastions, both elected Republican governors, as
did left-leaning Massachusetts and Rhode Island.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, California not only reelected Democrat Gray Davis to
a second term but also voted six of his party peers into statewide
office. In one other contest, Democrat Steve Westly was leading the
race for controller, but the outcome was too close to call. If Westly
prevails -- and a count of absentee ballots could take some time --
it would complete the first Democratic sweep in California since
1882.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the election wreckage, Republicans took solace in gaining at
least two Assembly seats and possibly a third. But the party remains
vastly outnumbered in the Legislature, and its spokesmen resorted
Wednesday to claiming moral victories, like keeping Davis' margin
over businessman Bill Simon Jr. in single digits -- 47% to 42% -- and
forcing others on the Democratic ticket to wait a few extra hours to
deliver victory speeches.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't think of a state in the country where Republicans are in
worse shape," said Tony Quinn, a former GOP strategist and a leading
California political demographer.</TE>
<TE>   It has been a dramatic shift away from the state's historic
Republican leanings, slow-building but powerful like an avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   Female voters in California -- who outnumber men -- steadily fled
the GOP over the last two decades as the conservative wing of the
Republican Party gained ascendancy. Latinos were antagonized by
Republican anti-immigration rhetoric and GOP Gov. Pete Wilson's 1994
support for Proposition 187, the measure that sought to deny many
benefits to illegal migrants. Many grew energized and began siding
overwhelmingly with Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, many of the GOP's most loyal followers -- the ones who
supported Ronald Reagan for governor and twice for president --
either died or retired to such places as Arizona, Colorado or Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   The result is terrain that is politically inhospitable to even the
best-intentioned Republicans. President Bush campaigned hard and
spent millions in his losing effort to carry the state in 2000. Once
he took office, it was months before Bush paid his first presidential
visit, and he took a hands-off approach when the electricity crisis
hit.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he kept an active role in the state's politics, working
through his proxies to assume financial control over the California
Republican Party and even helping coax Richard Riordan into the
governor's race. The former L.A. mayor, with his appeal to Latino
voters and support for abortion rights and gun control, was seen as
just the kind of maverick who could refashion the California GOP's
harsh image.</TE>
<TE>   After Riordan imploded and Simon won the Republican primary, Bush
helped raise several million dollars for the nominee. The president
visited California five times on Simon's behalf, albeit grudgingly
the last time in mid-August.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the White House barely hid its disdain for Simon and his
feuding strategists; some angry party activists noted that the
president never returned after Labor Day, when a visit might have
helped the most.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the ultimate hypocrisy," said K.B. Forbes, a GOP strategist
with roots in the party's conservative wing. "They keep talking about
building a bigger, better Republican Party, and they've done nothing
like that."</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Steel, the embattled chairman of the state GOP, also chimed
in Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The same group that managed the failed Bush [California] campaign
in 2000 now has control of the party, and so we've got the same
results," Steel said. "Had we had a more mature, sophisticated team,
like the Reagan cabinet, we would be better funded and more unified
and more appealing to conservatives."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, the president's chief California emissary, Westside
businessman Gerald L. Parsky, expressed pleasure with the party's
progress.</TE>
<TE>   "We started coming out of a 1998 gubernatorial election we lost by
20 points. In 2000 we lost by 11 points. Here we have only lost by 5
points, and I think that's thanks to the commitment of the
president," said Parsky, who led efforts to seize control of the
state GOP from Steel and his grass-roots allies.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, however, a campaign consultant close to the White House
was more dubious about the president's California prospects in 2004.
His advice: "Pretend you're running, but don't run."</TE>
<TE>   That means that the state probably should not count on the kind of
blandishments bestowed on, say, Florida, which has enjoyed the
fullest panoply of administration goodies, from environmental
projects to health-care benefits to repeated presidential visits.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush cannot be too stinting, either. For one thing, California
provides a huge chunk of the money the Republican Party collects
nationally -- and neglected campaign donors are not happy, or repeat,
donors.</TE>
<TE>   And there are lawmakers, with California constituents, who also
would not appreciate being taken for granted.</TE>
<TE>   "We are both too big and too important," said Rep. David Dreier, a
San Dimas Republican close to the Bush White House. "We are the 21st
century economy, we embody that, and the president understands that.
And the moment he fails to, I'll be there to remind him."</TE>

<HD>Strong Showing by Bush Puts More Pressure on Democrats</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>By demonstrating George W. Bush's political strength, the Republican
gains in Tuesday's midterm elections paradoxically will increase
pressure on leading Democrats -- especially those who might run
against him in 2004 -- to more sharply criticize and confront the
president, analysts in both parties say.</LD>
<LD>   Among dazed Democrats, the most common explanation for their
losses was the failure of the party's congressional leadership to
articulate a systematic critique of Bush's record, particularly on
the economy.</LD>
<LD>   That conviction is already increasing the demand among activists
for a more comprehensive and combative alternative to the Bush agenda
from potential 2004 presidential contenders.</LD>
<TE>   "The people who are going to run for president are going to
understand ... you have to have a strategic approach that provides a
telling critique of his domestic and economic and international
affairs programs," said John Podesta, former White House chief of
staff for President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's results infused urgency into the Democratic search for
new approaches by underscoring Bush's continuing strength,
particularly in the more culturally conservative states that he won
in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Across the Midwest and the South, Bush appeared to inspire a big
turnout of the GOP base. Bush's influence was -- most dramatic in the
South, where Republicans decisively reversed half a decade of modest
Democratic gains -- and showed how difficult it will be for Democrats
to crack Bush's stranglehold on the region in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "A Democrat will have to have extraordinary good luck in 2004 to
carry any significant number of Southern states -- and maybe any
Southern state," said Whit Ayres, an Atlanta-based GOP pollster.</TE>
<TE>   No single national trend cut through the disparate results of 34
Senate, 36 gubernatorial and 435 House races. Each party scored
successes in states that lean toward the other -- with Republicans,
for instance, winning governorships in the Democratic strongholds of
Massachusetts and Maryland, and Democrats capturing the governorship
in Tennessee and the Senate seat in Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   But largely, the GOP did best in the places where Bush was already
strong. The three Senate seats that Republicans won from Democrats
were in Georgia and Missouri -- which Bush won in 2000 -- and in
Minnesota, where he significantly improved the GOP showing from 1996
and lost only narrowly to Al Gore. In a runoff election next month,
Republicans have a shot at capturing a Democratic Senate seat in
Louisiana, another state Bush carried.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Democrats were almost entirely frustrated in their bids
for GOP Senate seats in states Bush won. All of the seven most
serious Democratic Senate challengers were running in these states.
Among them, the only winner was Mark Pryor, who defeated Republican
Sen. Tim Hutchinson in Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   The results in the South were especially emphatic. Democrats were
handed a once-in-a-generation opportunity when four venerable
Southern GOP senators -- including Jesse Helms in North Carolina,
Strom Thurmond in South Carolina and Phil Gramm in Texas -- decided
to retire this year, leaving open seats. But the Republicans won all
four contests by resounding margins.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the results reaffirmed the general Republican strength in
the South -- and the particular appeal of Bush across the region. In
2000, Bush defeated Gore in every Southern state; based on Tuesday's
results, he would begin the 2004 race as a clear favorite to again
sweep the region.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the voting reaffirmed one of the central political story
lines of the Bush presidency: his extraordinary hold on his base. An
election-day voter survey by the GOP polling firm Public Opinion
Strategies suggested the Republican gains came more from mobilizing
their base than from converting swing voters.</TE>
<TE>   In the survey, independent voters gave a slight edge to Democratic
congressional candidates. But GOP candidates won a higher level of
support from Republican voters than Democratic candidates did among
voters from their party. And Republicans surged to the polls: The
survey found that GOP partisans made up a considerably larger share
of the electorate Tuesday than they do of the nation overall.</TE>
<TE>   If Bush maintains such a high level of support and enthusiasm
among GOP voters, it will be difficult for Democrats to seriously
challenge him in all but a handful of the states he won in 2000, even
some Democratic analysts agree. "There is no margin of error for the
Democrats," said Chris Lehane, Gore's chief spokesman in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The demonstration of Bush's continuing strength in securing his
base will probably increase the concern among Democrats about finding
a nominee who can appeal widely to swing voters and swing states.
From all points on the ideological spectrum, leading party thinkers
agreed that to do so, Democrats will have to chart a new course.</TE>
<TE>   The second-guessing about the party's message and agenda began so
fast after Tuesday's voting that it might be called pre-criminations.</TE>
<TE>   Liberal voices such as Americans for Democratic Action, and
centrists such as the Democratic Leadership Council, quickly unified
behind a common complaint that the party's national leadership -- and
many of its individual candidates -- failed to draw sharp enough
lines of distinction with Bush, especially on economic issues.</TE>
<TE>   The ADA complained that the party had conceded too much ground to
Bush and fallen into the "mushy middle." DLC leaders complained that
the Democrats relied too much on enticing narrow groups of voters
with specific programs -- such as a prescription drug plan under
Medicare for seniors -- while failing to shape an overall economic
message that could attract swing voters.</TE>
<TE>   Senior congressional aides defend their approach, arguing that a
national message of opposition to Bush on tax cuts or his tough
policy toward Iraq would have been counterproductive because so many
of the competitive House and Senate races were in conservative,
pro-Bush areas. But many of those making that argument agree the
party will have to think bigger to challenge Bush in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The most immediate effect of this rapidly emerging consensus will
be to increase pressure on the likely 2004 presidential contenders to
offer bolder ideas and to challenge Bush's ideas more forcefully.</TE>
<TE>   Two possible contenders -- Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman of
Connecticut and John Edwards of North Carolina -- have already called
for rolling back Bush's tax cut; Podesta predicts that "every single
person running for president" will have to join them.</TE>
<TE>   Strategists for the prospective 2004 candidates are still trying
to sort out who the debacle hurts and helps. The results freed Rep.
Richard A. Gephardt (D--Mo.) to decide to resign as House minority
leader and focus on a probable bid for the presidency -- but the
setback also will dim his luster. It also should hurt Sen. Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.), who helped design and resolutely defended the
less-confrontational strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Some predict that the desire for a fresh face will encourage a
second look at Edwards, whose star has faded a bit in some Democratic
quarters in recent months. And the demand for a sharper edge could
help Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), who has shown less reluctance than
most to confront Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Several Democrats said it isn't clear how the losses might affect
Gore. Ironically, the former vice president has become so estranged
from the Democratic leadership in Washington that he may be immune
from the backlash against the strategy those leaders devised for
these stunning midterm elections.</TE>

<HD>5 Country Music Awards for Jackson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>Alan Jackson couldn't go wrong Wednesday, taking home his second
entertainer-of-the-year award and four other honors at the annual
Country Music Assn. Awards.</LD>
<LD>   His five awards tied a record for most received in one year.
Johnny Cash had that many in 1969, as did Vince Gill in 1993.</LD>
<LD>   "CMA's been a little too generous to me tonight," Jackson said
while accepting the top honor. "There's probably people who are a
little more exciting on stage, but I just walk out there and sing."</LD>
<TE>   Jackson, who was nominated a record 10 times, was also named male
vocalist of the year, won album of the year for "Drive," and song and
single of the year for his Sept. 11-themed "Where Were You (When the
World Stopped Turning)." His debut of the song at last year's
telecast stopped the show.</TE>
<TE>   The night also signaled the return of Shania Twain to the national
spotlight. She added a bit of pop to the show, bounding onto the
stage in a black cat suit to sing "I'm Gonna Getcha Good" -- her
first network performance since beginning an almost three-year hiatus
in 1999, when she was CMA entertainer of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't have the scary impact that I thought it would," Twain
said of her performance. She releases a new album later this month.</TE>
<TE>   An emotional Martina McBride accepted her second
female-vocalist-of-the-year award after performing her new single,
"Concrete Angel," for the crowd at the Grand Ole Opry House. She also
won in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not prepared for this emotion that I'm feeling, it's just
so amazing that I get to live this dream," she said as she wiped away
tears.</TE>
<TE>   The Dixie Chicks were named vocal group of the year for the fourth
time; Brooks &amp; Dunn took home their 10th award for vocal duo of the
year; and Brad Paisley beat out Jackson for music video of the year
for "I'm Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin' Song)."</TE>
<TE>   Gill, hosting the show for the 11th consecutive year, joked after
Twain's performance about his yearly effort to lose weight before the
awards.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lost 26 pounds for this year's show. I lose 20 more, I'm
showing my belly button like" Twain, he said with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Dolly Parton welcomed the Country Music Hall of Fame's newest
inductees -- Bill Carlisle and Porter Wagoner -- with a video montage
of their careers.</TE>
<TE>   Country trio Rascal Flatts won the Horizon Award, which goes to a
performer or group considered to have good career prospects.</TE>
<TE>   Before the show, Willie Nelson received the vocal event of the
year award for "Mendocino County Line," his single with Lee Ann
Womack.</TE>

<HD>Bush Gets Credit, Clout for Leading GOP Sweep</HD>
<DH>The president appears to have gained political muscle,
leading foreign diplomats to predict a greater willingness to attack
Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Doyle McManus</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Ever since he saw his father's presidency collapse in 1992, George W.
Bush has argued that a president must sometimes invest some
"political capital" if he wants to watch it grow.</LD>
<LD>   By staking his prestige on this year's congressional campaign,
Bush proved his own theory: He risked some capital, but the
investment paid off big.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans and Democrats alike credited Bush on Wednesday for a
good measure of the GOP's unexpected success. "It was a reflection of
a very popular president who broke all records in terms of his
willingness to go around the country and campaign for his
candidates," said a deflated Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle of
South Dakota.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, Bush now appears significantly more powerful than
during the first two years of his presidency, with a freer hand on
domestic issues such as tax cuts and international issues such as
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "George W. Bush has always benefited from being underestimated,
just as Ronald Reagan was," said Kenneth M. Duberstein, Reagan's last
White House chief of staff. "But there came a time when Reagan could
no longer be underestimated. That time may just have arrived for
Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "To be an effective president, you need to be both feared and
revered, here and abroad," Duberstein said. "After this election,
Democrats obviously don't want Bush to come into their districts
anymore....</TE>
<TE>   "Overseas, people now have to perceive the United States as
Bushland. And that will strengthen his hand around the world."</TE>
<TE>   Foreign diplomats agreed. Several, refusing to be quoted by name,
said they expected the election to strengthen Bush's willingness to
launch military action against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesmen said the president's foreign policy
positions would not be affected by his newly strengthened political
standing.</TE>
<TE>   But other U.S. and foreign officials said the GOP victory could
only bolster Bush's hawkish position on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "The likelihood that the American president will feel even more
self-confident about his own views than prior to the election is
great," Karsten Voigt, a top aide to German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, told Reuters news agency.</TE>
<TE>   During the campaign, Bush often invoked the war on terrorism and
his confrontation with Iraq. These are unusual issues to raise in a
midterm congressional election, because such contests are normally
fought over domestic concerns.</TE>
<TE>   But there was political calculation in Bush's strategy. Democrats
complained that he was focusing on war to divert attention from the
faltering economy; Republicans said he was merely reminding voters
that they approved of his leadership in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of people were concerned about national security,"
Daschle said. "We weren't able to break through on economic issues."</TE>
<TE>   "Bush and [political aide] Karl Rove did something quite
brilliant," said Samuel Popkin, a political scientist at UC San Diego
and former advisor to several Democratic campaigns. "They raised the
president's profile in a midterm campaign, they talked about foreign
policy, and they benefited from it."</TE>
<TE>   The only parallel in recent history, he said, was the
congressional election of 1962, shortly after the Cuban missile
crisis, when President Kennedy campaigned as a foreign policy leader
and held Democratic losses to a minimum.</TE>
<TE>   The White House struck a deliberately modest tone Wednesday,
offering what spokesman Ari Fleischer called "a touch of
graciousness" in place of overt boasts of victory.</TE>
<TE>   The modesty extended to the president's plans for the remaining
two years of his first term, but that was partly because Bush and his
aides believe in focusing on a small number of priorities at a time
and partly because they have not decided fully how they want to
exploit their new congressional majority.</TE>
<TE>   "The president has two major priorities for the future, and they
involve the protection of the homeland, including our national
security, and strengthening America's economy," Fleischer told
reporters several times.</TE>
<TE>   Pressed for a more detailed agenda, he listed a series of
unfinished items from the last two years: the establishment of a
Department of Homeland Security, a terrorism insurance bill, a new
national energy policy and a larger role for religious charities in
government-funded social services.</TE>
<TE>   On two major initiatives that Bush once espoused in principle,
overhauls of the Social Security system and the federal income tax,
Fleischer ducked. "It's too soon to say," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If history is any guide, one result of the president's new
congressional majority will be increased pressure from conservatives
for some of their cherished goals, including more tax cuts and an end
to the corporate income tax.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Democrats controlled the Senate, Bush had an excuse for
not delivering everything the conservatives wanted," Popkin noted.
"Now he has to deliver."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, noted political scientist Fred I. Greenstein of
Princeton University, every Republican in the Senate "now owes a debt
to Bush."</TE>
<TE>   "Who knows whether his campaign trips were any more responsible
for this outcome than a rooster's crow is for the sunrise?" he said.
"But he put himself on the line, and he gets the credit.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the opposite of what we've come to expect of a
presidency," Greenstein noted. "Most recent presidencies started out
strong, ran into trouble and fell apart. This one started in doubt,
in a contested election, and has only gotten stronger. It's as if
we're playing the videotape backwards."</TE>

<HD>Exercise Can Lessen Cholesterol Danger, Researchers Find</HD>
<DH>Study shows that staying active changes the size and
density of proteins that carry the substance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Need another reason to exercise? Scientists have discovered that
working out makes cholesterol less dangerous.</LD>
<LD>   A study found that even modest exercise changes the size and
density of cholesterol-carrying proteins so they do less damage. And
the benefits occur even if a person's total cholesterol and their
weight remain the same.</LD>
<LD>   Staying active has many health benefits, but improving cholesterol
is not usually considered one of them. People who exercise will often
lose weight, and although that can improve their cholesterol levels,
exercise by itself was thought to have little or no effect.</LD>
<TE>   Workouts fail to lower LDL, the dangerous form of cholesterol, and
only rigorous exercise can nudge up HDL, the good form that protects
against heart attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But the study, by Dr. William E. Kraus of Duke University, found a
new way that exercise can affect cholesterol -- by altering the
number and size of the particles that carry cholesterol through the
bloodstream.</TE>
<TE>   "People in the exercise field have always wondered why it doesn't
affect total cholesterol and LDL," Kraus said. "We always knew low
levels of exercise are helpful. This helps solve that paradox."</TE>
<TE>   His work, published in today's issue of the New England Journal of
Medicine, is the latest chapter in an evolving view of cholesterol's
effects. A generation ago, doctors worried only about the total
amount of cholesterol. Later, the importance of the main subtypes,
especially HDL, became apparent. Now experts are turning their
attentions to the physical structure of cholesterol in the
bloodstream.</TE>
<TE>   Cholesterol is an essential fat, or lipid. It circulates through
the body by attaching to protein particles.</TE>
<TE>   Cholesterol appears more likely to clog the arteries when it is
carried by small, dense protein particles than when it is moved by
relatively large, fluffy ones.</TE>
<TE>   The latest study finds that people who exercise develop these
bigger particles, even if their total amount of cholesterol stays the
same.</TE>
<TE>   "Using this analysis shows clearly that exercise has beneficial
effects that are not revealed by standard tests," said Dr. Ronald M.
Krauss of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, who studies the
protein particles.</TE>
<TE>   The study, conducted at Duke and East Carolina University,
involved 111 sedentary, overweight men and women. They were randomly
assigned to three exercise groups: the equivalent of walking 12 miles
a week, jogging 12 miles a week or jogging 20 miles a week. All were
instructed to eat enough to keep their weights constant.</TE>
<TE>   They found that the cholesterol effects of walking and jogging 12
miles were the same, while jogging 20 miles resulted in more
pronounced changes.</TE>
<TE>   Measuring protein particle size is sometimes done in large medical
centers, but it is not part of standard physicals. Kraus said he
expects the tests, which cost two or three times more than standard
cholesterol tests, to become more widely used.</TE>

<HD>Bush Gets Credit, Clout for Leading GOP Sweep</HD>
<DH>'Let's roll!' says Sen. Lott, likely to be majority leader,
as Republicans plan for Senate takeover. Homeland security, tax cuts
are at top of agenda.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Republicans on Wednesday moved to consolidate their
power in Congress, preparing to take over leadership of the Senate
and to advance President Bush's long-stalled legislative and judicial
agenda.</LD>
<LD>   "Let's roll!" said Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.), the expected
majority leader in the GOP-controlled Senate, who was on the phone at
7 a.m. with President Bush, one of a series of conversations among
Republican leaders throughout the day.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans and Democrats alike agreed that the GOP's showing in
Tuesday's congressional elections was a vote of confidence in Bush,
who campaigned feverishly on his party's behalf. But Bush himself
avoided public statements to avoid seeming to gloat, aides said.</LD>
<TE>   Through a spokesman, Bush said the message of the election was
that voters wanted to end the gridlock in Washington. He has sought
to reorganize homeland security programs, cut taxes and get more
conservative judges on the federal bench.</TE>
<TE>   "The credit goes to the candidates and to those who focused on
changing the tone, people who want to work together to get things
done," Bush was quoted as saying by White House Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer</TE>
<TE>   In the House, the GOP added at least five seats to its slim
majority -- an unexpectedly big gain for a midterm election, when the
president's party almost always loses seats in that chamber.</TE>
<TE>   That set off a round of finger pointing and introspection among
dismayed Democrats. Adding to the turmoil, House Minority Leader
Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) has decided to step down as party leader.
He is expected to pursue plans to run for president.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of Tuesday's vote, some disgruntled Democrats had
called for his resignation as leader.</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, the GOP's net gain of two seats so far will give
them 51 in the 100-member chamber when the next Congress convenes in
January. Going into Tuesday's vote, Democrats controlled the Senate
by a single seat.</TE>
<TE>   Upon assuming the majority, Republicans will have the power to set
the Senate's legislative agenda, move Bush's judicial and Cabinet
nominations to a vote and take over chairmanships of legislative
committees.</TE>
<TE>   And with the entire legislative branch as well as the White House
controlled by the Republicans, the GOP inherits a new burden of
responsibility for addressing the nation's problems. It will now be
harder for the party leaders to blame Senate Democrats for blocking
the president's agenda, as they did relentlessly during the 2002
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a little bit of trepidation," said a top House GOP
leadership aide. "Now that we control all the levers, the onus is on
us."</TE>
<TE>   Some Republicans already are concerned that the high expectations
of enhanced GOP power are going to be hard to meet, especially with
such a narrow majority in the notoriously balky Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "The Senate was designed by our forefathers to be very slow and
difficult to move," said Lott. "And, boy, they succeeded."</TE>
<TE>   The final makeup of both the new House and Senate was still
somewhat unsettled Wednesday. Two House races remained undecided;
pending those results, the chamber's breakdown will be 228
Republicans, 204 Democrats and one Independent.</TE>
<TE>   Along with 51 Republicans, the new Senate apparently will include
at least 47 Democrats and one independent. The remaining seat will be
decided in a Dec. 7 runoff in Louisiana. Democratic incumbent Mary
Landrieu led a pack of challengers in Tuesday's results but she
failed to garner 50% of the vote, forcing the runoff.</TE>
<TE>   There also is some uncertainty over the outcome of South Dakota's
Senate race. Although Democratic incumbent Tim Johnson on Wednesday
declared victory, his roughly 500-vote win over Republican John R.
Thune may be subject to a recount.</TE>
<TE>   Many Democrats on Wednesday attributed their setbacks to the
difficulties of vying with the political clout Bush has gained since
he launched a war on terrorism following the Sept. 11 attacks on
America last year. The Democrats also noted that Bush threw his
prestige and vast fund-raising abilities into shoring up GOP
candidates -- many of whom were running in states and districts that
he carried in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, we could not compete with the power of the bully
pulpit and a wartime president," said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.),
chairwoman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "Now Republicans will have to deliver on the issues on which they
campaigned."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans argued that their gains were also a tribute to the
Democrats' lack of a compelling alternative to Bush's agenda and
their record of blocking Bush initiatives in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "The American people have indicated that they want the Congress
... [and] the president to work together, to get things done, to
produce results, not get tangled up in the partisan politics that we
saw so much of this year here in the Senate," Lott said.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP's majority margin in Congress is still quite narrow. But
many on Capitol Hill believe the party will be in a stronger position
to push its agenda than it was in the first months after the 2000
election, when it also controlled the White House, Senate and House.
Republicans lost their Senate majority in mid-2001 when Sen. James M.
Jeffords of Vermont left the GOP to become an independent and support
Democrats for the chamber's leadership posts.</TE>
<TE>   Since Jeffords' defection, the Sept. 11 attacks and Bush's
response have transformed him from a president who took office under
disputed circumstances to a popular leader.</TE>
<TE>   The result, said a Senate GOP advisor, is that the GOP's agenda in
Congress will be guided more than ever by Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "The great truth from [Tuesday's] election is that the president
is the power in the Republican Party," said the advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans may get their first taste of majority control later
this month, as the outgoing Congress meets in a lame-duck session.</TE>
<TE>   Although most new members elected Tuesday will not take office
until early January, Republican Jim Talent of Missouri will be sworn
in to the Senate as soon as his election is certified by state
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Talent on Tuesday defeated Democratic incumbent Jean Carnahan, who
was appointed to temporarily fill the remainder of a six-year term in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   When Talent takes office, that will give Republicans 50 senators
in the current Congress -- giving control to the GOP because Vice
President Dick Cheney has the power to break a Senate tie. However,
it may take two weeks for Talent's election to be certified, meaning
Democrats would still control the lame-duck session when it convenes
next week.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever Republicans take control, Fleischer said Bush wants GOP
lawmakers to push several initiatives that have been stalled by
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   These include his proposal to create a Department of Homeland
Security, his plan to give a bigger role to faith-based institutions
in providing social services, new energy legislation that would
emphasize domestic production and making permanent the 10-year tax
cut Congress passed last year.</TE>
<TE>   GOP control of Senate committees will give his agenda a key boost.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the Judiciary Committee -- which under the
chairmanship of liberal Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) has blocked some of
Bush's nominees to the federal bench -- will be headed by
conservative Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah).</TE>
<TE>   However, the GOP's slim majority will not be enough to turn the
Senate into a rubber stamp for Bush's initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   That's because the chamber's rules require 60 votes to cut off
delaying tactics, such as filibusters. So Republicans will need some
Democratic support to move major bills.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a huge mistake not to proceed in a bipartisan way
because [Republicans] just now have a bare majority," said Sen.
Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).</TE>
<TE>   A good illustration of the extent and limits of the GOP's power in
the Senate is the outlook for energy legislation, stalled for months
in a House-Senate conference committee.</TE>
<TE>   David Nemtzow, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, a
bipartisan coalition of business, consumer and environmental leaders,
said Tuesday's results should give new life to some pro-production
provisions the White House has sought.</TE>
<TE>   But one of Bush's favorite energy initiatives -- drilling in a
portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge -- is still likely to
face a Democratic filibuster that would require 60 votes to defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Also, at least one of the newly elected GOP senators, Norm Coleman
of Minnesota, has come out against Arctic drilling.</TE>

<HD>Gephardt to Leave Leadership Post</HD>
<DH>Resigning as minority chief of the House could free the
Democrat for a presidential bid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, a likely presidential contender who has led
his party in four fruitless tries to reclaim the House, intends to
announce today that he will step down as minority leader, aides to
the Missouri Democrat said.</LD>
<LD>   The two leading candidates to succeed him are Reps. Nancy Pelosi
of San Francisco and Martin Frost of Texas.</LD>
<LD>   The contest between the liberal Pelosi and the somewhat more
centrist Frost could help chart a new ideological course for an
opposition party that is struggling to determine whether it needs an
overhaul or a mere makeover to retake power in the legislative and
executive branches.</LD>
<TE>   Setbacks in this week's midterm elections left Gephardt's rank and
file dispirited -- and a few openly rebellious. Democratic lawmakers,
dissecting the results, privately worried that the party needs to
find a voice able to connect with the concerns of voters.</TE>
<TE>   As the voice of the House Democrats for the last eight years,
Gephardt inevitably drew fresh scrutiny. So too did his counterpart
across the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) appeared set on running again for
party leader despite the loss of the Democratic Senate majority.
There were no immediate indications that Daschle would face a
challenge from within his ranks.</TE>
<TE>   That was not necessarily true, however, for Gephardt.</TE>
<TE>   Hours before word of his decision spread late Wednesday, Reps.
Harold E. Ford Jr. (D-Tenn.) and Peter Deutsch (D-Fla.) publicly
suggested that Gephardt should not run.</TE>
<TE>   "After four tries, you have to give somebody else a shot," Ford
told CNN. "I'm not alone, I might add."</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt's allies, angered at the breach of rank, dismissed such
talk as sour grapes from lawmakers of modest stature who harbor other
political motives.</TE>
<TE>   But the clear implication was that Gephardt would have faced some
degree of opposition -- although not necessarily defeat -- if he had
sought to lead the party again.</TE>
<TE>   Although aides insist that he has not made up his mind about a
2004 presidential run, Gephardt's decision to leave the House
leadership has immediate repercussions for the Democratic field of
presidential aspirants now taking shape. Freed from leadership duties
on Capitol Hill, Gephardt would be able to throw himself full-tilt
into preparations for a bid for the nomination to oppose President
Bush.</TE>
<TE>   It also would set the stage for a furious one-week race to succeed
him as the leader of slightly more than 200 Democrats still smarting
from this week's Republican wins.</TE>
<TE>   In Tuesday's elections, the GOP added at least five seats to its
House majority, even though history suggests that the president's
party should lose ground in a midterm election.</TE>
<TE>   In three previous tries for the majority in 1996, 1998 and 2000 --
all during Bill Clinton's presidency -- Gephardt's Democrats gained
ground against the Republicans but came up short each time.</TE>
<TE>   The election to replace Gephardt will be held Nov. 14.</TE>
<TE>   The two veteran Democrats who are seeking his post have been
waging a shadow, intraparty leadership contest for months.</TE>
<TE>   Pelosi is seen as one of the party's rising stars, a zealous
fund-raiser and an expert on foreign affairs and national security.
Frost is a pragmatic tactician with broad political experience,
having led party campaign committees and redistricting efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Pelosi, unlike Gephardt, voted against the congressional
resolution that authorizes Bush to use force against Iraq. Frost
voted for it. But on many issues the two are in sync.</TE>
<TE>   As minority whip, Pelosi is the second-ranking House Democrat.
Frost, as caucus chairman, is No. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Had Democrats gained the majority, they might have vied for the
positions of majority leader or possibly speaker. In the minority,
they will be seeking the high-profile role of leader of the House
opposition. The winner of the election will require majority support
on a secret ballot of the Democratic members.</TE>
<TE>   On election night, Pelosi told reporters in a conference call that
the party should have found a way to criticize Republicans more
strongly.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think it behooves the national party to be clear enough
about the distinction between the two parties," Pelosi said. "We may
not have been strong enough with our message to the public."</TE>
<TE>   Frost, meanwhile, was tacking toward the center.</TE>
<TE>   "The country moved to the right yesterday, and House Democrats
won't win a majority by moving further to the left," said a Frost
spokesman, Tom Eisenhauer.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some of the Democrats who triumphed in swing districts
this week backed Bush in the war on terror and on other national
security issues. Some voted for his 2001 tax cut. Others opposed gun
control or abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt, 61, was acknowledged by many Democrats as an effective
minority leader because he managed to bridge the differences between
the conservative and liberal wings of the party. There were some
party defections on his watch, but not many.</TE>
<TE>   He became minority leader after Republicans captured the House in
the watershed 1994 elections. In January 1995, as the last Democratic
majority leader, it fell to him to hand the gavel to incoming Speaker
Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). Gephardt thought he would soon recapture it,
but he never did.</TE>
<TE>   This week, he easily won his 14th term representing St. Louis
suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   Asked on CNN Wednesday morning about his political plans, Gephardt
was noncommittal. "There are decisions you've got to look at, and I
will do that with my family and figure it all out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After consulting with lawmakers in a day of marathon telephone
calls, he informed his aides of his decision late Wednesday
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   One said Gephardt sounded "very upbeat" as he thanked his staff in
a conference call. "This is his moment and he's seizing it," the aide
said.</TE>
<TE>   Enduring this year's setbacks, Gephardt told staff, was "the
hardest thing in my life."</TE>
<TE>   A Democratic source insisted that the decision to step down as
leader was not tantamount to deciding to run for president.</TE>
<TE>   But, the source said, it "is a big step. It's not announcing. It's
a lean in that direction."</TE>
<TE>   In abandoning the leadership post, the source said, Gephardt
concluded it was not fair to other Democrats for him to be distracted
by his deliberations on a run for president. Gephardt lost a bid for
the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "You could do both jobs, but it's not in the interest of the
caucus," the source said.</TE>

<HD>Timber, Oil Policies Now Take the Fore</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Environmentalists, cringing as they watched Republicans tighten the
GOP's grip on Congress, said Wednesday they fear the election results
could cripple the fight against widespread logging in national
forests and oil drilling in an Alaska wildlife refuge.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's very, very bad news for the environment of the
West," said Debbie Sease, Sierra Club national legislative director.
"I think it's going to result in more timber being cut in our
national forests. There'll be attempts to weaken the Endangered
Species Act."</LD>
<LD>   But Chris West, vice president of the timber industry's American
Forest Resource Council here, said he hopes the results mean
political rhetoric will be replaced by serious discussion.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not doom and gloom for the environmentalists. It's just, now
we're going to have an open debate about these issues," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Because Republicans reclaimed control of the Senate from Democrats
on Tuesday, the GOP will set its agenda and run its committees. Along
with a stronger hold on the House, the Republican gains mean
President Bush's agenda on natural resource issues faces a friendlier
reception when Congress returns next year.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, the outlook for Bush's proposals to cut wildfire
risk by allowing loggers more access to the national forests, and to
increase energy supplies by allowing oil companies to drill in the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, has improved.</TE>
<TE>   The House approved an energy bill in August that included drilling
in the Arctic refuge, but the Senate, now controlled by Democrats,
has rejected development there.</TE>
<TE>   The forest conflict centers on disagreement about how much logging
should be allowed to remove unnaturally high levels of brush and
small trees that have resulted from decades of suppressing fires.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the thinning programs are abused to remove larger,
commercial-size timber. Environmentalists say Republicans and timber
industry representatives are trying to fast-track forest-thinning
projects by circumventing key environmental laws and judicial
reviews.</TE>
<TE>   Groups including the American Lands Alliance, Citizens for Better
Forestry and the National Forest Protection Alliance planned rallies
across the country today to protest the Bush-backed forest
legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very dangerous time," said Brian Vincent, California
organizer for the American Lands Alliance.</TE>

<HD>Execution of Schizophrenic Killer Stayed</HD>
<DH>The Supreme Court grants last-minute reprieve to the Texas
man after lawyers argue he was improperly declared competent.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>HUNTSVILLE, Texas</DL>
<LD>In a surprise move, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a last-minute
reprieve Wednesday night to a paranoid schizophrenic murderer, whose
case drew widespread attention because it raised questions about
executing the mentally ill.</LD>
<LD>   The stay was issued after an eleventh-hour appeal filed by James
Colburn's lawyers. The 42-year-old was scheduled to be put to death
by lethal injection at the state prison here.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a relief, a blessing from God," Colburn told officials
before he was led to the van that would take him back to death row.
"I'm relieved for my family."</LD>
<TE>   The stay shocked people gathered here for Colburn's execution,
coming only a day after the U.S. Supreme Court, in a vote of 7 to 2,
refused to review the case.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Marcus, director of the Texas Defender Service, said that
Wednesday's appeal asserted that Colburn had been denied due process
of law when a Texas court ruled that he was competent to be executed.</TE>
<TE>   A 1986 Supreme Court decision, Ford vs. Wainwright, barred the
execution of convicted murderers who have become so mentally ill that
they do not know they are about to be killed and why.</TE>
<TE>   The decision also established that if there is a question about
the inmate's competency to be executed, he has to be afforded a
hearing and the opportunity to present evidence on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "All that was denied to Mr. Colburn," said Marcus.</TE>
<TE>   Marcus and Richard Burr, a Houston attorney who won the Ford case
in the Supreme Court, said it was rare for executions to be barred
because the inmate was determined to be incompetent, but they said
they did not have precise figures on how often such an action has
happened.</TE>
<TE>   The stay gives Colburn's lawyers 90 days to file a detailed brief
explaining why the Supreme Court should give Colburn a full hearing
on the competency issue.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the Texas attorney general's office said that
she was not aware of the Supreme Court action and could not comment.</TE>
<TE>   Colburn's death sentence drew protests from human rights advocates
that he lacked the capacity to understand his crime.</TE>
<TE>   There is no doubt that Colburn, a former bricklayer and carpenter,
killed 55-year-old Peggy Louis Murphy in 1994. Murphy, a waitress,
was hitchhiking on a road north of Houston when Colburn invited her
to his apartment for a drink.</TE>
<TE>   By his own admission, Colburn gave Murphy a beer, then tried to
rape her. As they struggled, he choked Murphy and stabbed her in the
throat with a steak knife.</TE>
<TE>   Although he was institutionalized at least twice after being
diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 14, two psychologists judged
Colburn competent to stand trial in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Dist. Atty. Jay Hileman told the jury that Colburn, who
turned himself in after the murder, could distinguish between right
and wrong and should be held accountable for his actions.
"Attributing this violence, this horrible cruelty ... to paranoid
schizophrenia is naive and oversimplistic," Hileman said during the
trial in Montgomery County, north of Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "He did it because he's mean."</TE>
<TE>   It took 20 minutes for the jury to convict Colburn of capital
murder, and two hours to sentence him to death.</TE>
<TE>   Colburn's lawyers appealed on the grounds that he could not help
in his defense because anti-psychotic drugs made him so drowsy that
he napped during the trial, at times snoring loudly. The U.S. 5th
Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the claim, ruling earlier this year
that "whether Colburn fell asleep once or slept through most of his
trial is not dispositive of Colburn's competence."</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court on Tuesday had declined to review the case based
on that issue.</TE>
<TE>   Last June, the Supreme Court banned the execution of mentally
retarded inmates. But the ruling did not address the issue of whether
mental illness was a bar to execution.</TE>
<TE>   The high court's June ruling should naturally be extended to
situations like Colburn's, said Philip H. Hilder, one of his
appellate lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   "In blunt terms, he is out of his mind from a condition not of his
doing," Hilder said. "We're not asking that he be excused for a
murder. We're asking that he be treated."</TE>
<TE>   "The system needs to take into account a person's mental illness
when determining what charges to file and how to prosecute," said
Oscar Morgan, a consultant for policy and programs at the Alexandria,
Va.-based National Mental Health Assn.</TE>

<HD>Governorships Nearly Reach Parity</HD>
<DH>Democrats take some solace in victories in key states. The
new alignment could be crucial in the next presidential contest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For downcast Democrats, a lone bright spot emerged Wednesday: Their
gains in gubernatorial elections drew them near parity with
Republicans in an important measure of political strength.</LD>
<LD>   With the outcome uncertain in Alabama, Republicans were on track
to hold 25 governorships next year and the Democrats 24.</LD>
<LD>   Oregon and Arizona completed counts Wednesday that resulted in
narrow Democratic wins, while in Alabama the Democratic incumbent and
the Republican challenger each claimed victory in a contest probably
headed for a recount.</LD>
<TE>   Democratic officials were optimistic that they could pull even
with the GOP; Republicans said they could retain the majority they
have held for eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the final tally, Democrats cheered the climb from
their current total of 21 governorships -- savoring solid takeovers
in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Arizona and Michigan and upsets in
traditionally Republican states such as Wyoming and Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Other states wrested from the GOP were Tennessee, Wisconsin and
New Mexico. Democrats also took a governorship now held by an
independent in Maine.</TE>
<TE>   Though the gains were smaller than some Democrats had predicted,
they were nonetheless real -- and they offered a sharp contrast to
the party's demoralizing losses in the House and the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "Our gubernatorial pickups will give us an edge in fund-raising
and grass-roots organizing going into 2004," said Terry McAuliffe,
chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He proclaimed the
Democrats "in good shape" for the presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, though, took from Democrats the governorships of
Maryland, for the first time in 36 years; Hawaii, for the first time
in 40 years; and, surprisingly, Georgia, for the first time since
after the Civil War. They also captured governorships in New
Hampshire, Vermont and South Carolina, all now held by Democrats, and
Minnesota, held by an independent.</TE>
<TE>   And GOP incumbents beat back Democratic challenges in Florida,
Texas and New York. The decisive victories of Govs. Jeb Bush, Rick
Perry and George Pataki in those large states far outshined the
meager sub-50% reelection win recorded by Democratic California Gov.
Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "We made huge inroads getting back to Southern Republican
strongholds," said Connecticut Gov. John G. Rowland, chairman of the
Republican Governors Assn. "And we surprised everybody by winning
some New England states.... All in all, we've built a strong, solid
base and foundation for the president's reelection."</TE>
<TE>   There was good reason for presidential politics to be on the minds
of party strategists. In recent years, the road to the White House
has led through the statehouses, and governors can deploy large
political organizations to help presidential candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Before Tuesday's elections, Republicans governed in 27 states with
298 votes -- a majority -- in the Electoral College, which will
choose the next president. After the elections, Democrats will govern
at least 24 states, and possibly 25. That would total at least 282
electoral votes -- not counting three in the Democratic-led District
of Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   Put another way: Since 1995, a majority of Americans have lived in
states with Republican governors. Next year, most will live under
Democratic governors.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon remained in Democratic hands when Ted Kulongoski pulled out
a razor-thin victory Wednesday over Republican Kevin Mannix.</TE>
<TE>   In Arizona, Democrat Janet Napolitano narrowly defeated Republican
Matt Salmon.</TE>
<TE>   A Napolitano victory sets two precedents: She will be the first
woman to succeed a female governor, outgoing Republican incumbent
Jane Dee Hull. And she will be one of a record six women to serve
next year as governors. There are now five.</TE>
<TE>   In Alabama, both sides claimed victory in a cliffhanger where the
outcome could be determined by recounts or the courts. Unofficial
returns initially showed that Gov. Donald Siegelman, a Democrat, had
beaten Republican Bob Riley by a whisker. On that basis, Siegelman
was declared the victor early Wednesday by news organizations,
including The Times and Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   But Riley made a stunning turnabout after Republican-dominated
Baldwin County revised its vote total due to what election officials
called a computer tabulation error. The revision stripped Siegelman
of roughly 6,000 votes and left Riley with a lead of more than 3,000
votes.</TE>
<TE>   Both candidates declared victory and dispatched supporters to
recheck vote totals throughout the state. "How sweet it is,"
Siegelman told supporters at a party in Montgomery. Riley, likewise,
told supporters in Talladega: "We win. Alabama's got a new day
coming."</TE>

<HD>Extortion Charges in Smart Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>A South Carolina man was charged Wednesday with trying to extort $3
million for the safe return of Elizabeth Smart, the 14-year-old girl
who vanished from her bedroom in June.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI said it couldn't rule out Walter Holloway, 18, as the
kidnapper until they found him Tuesday in Charleston, S.C., typing
his latest demands by e-mail.</LD>
<LD>   According to an arrest warrant, Holloway confessed he kept up a
regular correspondence with Salt Lake City police and the Smart
family, boasting he was "the only real kidnapper," threatening to
hurt the girl and saying, "Tell [Elizabeth's father] Ed he can have
Elizabeth back as soon as I get the ransom."</LD>
<TE>   Holloway sent 38 messages over the last two months before the FBI
found him in front of a computer at his parent's house. The family
did not return a telephone message Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Holloway was being held on felony charges of extortion and sending
threatening messages across state lines. The charges carry up to 25
years in prison, said U.S. Atty. Paul Warner, who plans to seek a
grand jury indictment next week and bring Holloway to Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   The bungled extortion "makes me sick," Ed Smart said. He said it
kept authorities from devoting full attention to finding his
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Holloway allegedly warned police they would be shot by snipers if
they tried to interfere with a money drop that was never arranged.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agent James H. Burrus Jr. said investigators didn't believe
Holloway had Elizabeth or knew any of the details of her
disappearance, but couldn't be certain until they traced him using
his Internet service provider. He was using the screen name
"Elizabethsmartkidnapper."</TE>

<HD>Ready or Not, Voters Had Chances to Take the Initiative</HD>
<DH>Of 202 ballot measures, marijuana legalization and
bilingual education were hot-button issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to weaning the nation off bilingual education, Silicon
Valley businessman Ron Unz succeeded in Massachusetts, arguably the
most liberal state in the nation, and says he's on a roll. Never mind
that a similar issue was defeated in Colorado, he says.</LD>
<LD>   When it comes to legalizing marijuana, Bruce Mirken hoped to win
over Nevada, with its brothels and other assorted vices, but was
trounced. Now he's regrouping.</LD>
<LD>   Few other initiatives and referendums confronting voters across
the country Tuesday -- 202 measures in 40 states -- addressed such
basic social issues: Should buying and smoking marijuana for personal
enjoyment be legalized and how best to help immigrant children learn
in the classroom?</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, Tuesday's election results have forced government agencies
across the country to deal with new challenges, while letting others
off the hook.</TE>
<TE>   Florida voters put the onus on educators to enact two measures
that were narrowly approved -- one that requires that 4-year-olds be
offered a "high quality pre-kindergarten learning opportunity" and
another to limit class sizes.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers in two states, on the other hand, won't have to wrestle
with tax cuts, while two other states won new revenue sources. A
Massachusetts measure to eliminate the state income tax, and an
Arkansas initiative to abolish certain food and medicine taxes, were
both defeated. Legislatures in Tennessee and North Dakota were given
voter blessing to launch lotteries.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon voters rejected as too pricey a $20-billion plan to offer
medical coverage to all residents, and also turned back a proposal to
require labeling of certain genetically engineered foods. They
approved, however, raising the state's minimum wage next year to
$6.90 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri voters rejected a quadruple increase in cigarette taxes,
while Arizona voters supported a doubling of cigarette taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Voters similarly were contrary on the question of bilingual
education.</TE>
<TE>   Massachusetts was the first state to adopt bilingual education.
With the state reversing itself, Unz said it's time for federal
action. Unz successfully campaigned to replace bilingual education
programs with English immersion in California in 1998 and Arizona in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ridiculous to keep doing this state by state with initiative
campaigns. At some point, the federal government should take up the
issue," Unz said Wednesday. The Massachusetts measure passed by a
more than 2-to-1 margin.</TE>
<TE>   Unz contended that the measure was defeated in Colorado because
Patricia Stryker, a wealthy medical equipment heiress whose child is
learning Spanish, contributed $3.1 million to finance an advertising
blitz to defeat the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of bilingual education warned Wednesday that politicians
shouldn't be too quick to run with the Massachusetts vote, and should
take Colorado's vote to heart.</TE>
<TE>   Delia Pompa, executive director of the National Assn. for
Bilingual Education, said that, based on a voting analysis, 92% of
Massachusetts' Latino community -- who best know the value of
bilingual education -- opposed the English-immersion measure.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, she said, the measure failed to carry in some of the
state's most enlightened communities, including Boston, Cambridge and
Amherst.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's defeat, she said, reflected voters' understanding that
"the issue of bilingual education is complex and can't be addressed
in 10-word sound bites. There's no one-size-fits-all approach to
anything in education."</TE>
<TE>   While Unz claimed his issue gained momentum Tuesday, the push to
legalize marijuana clearly hit a roadblock in Nevada. Less dramatic
measures -- to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of
marijuana in Arizona, and to divert marijuana users to drug programs
rather than jail in Ohio -- also failed to win voter support.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington-based Marijuana Policy Project, with help from
three wealthy benefactors, spent more than $2 million on the Nevada
measure, but won the support of only 39% of the voters.</TE>
<TE>   Mirken, spokesman for the marijuana advocacy group, said Nevada
was targeted for philosophical and logistical reasons. Voters two
years ago approved the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes, and
gathering enough signatures to put the issue on Tuesday's ballot was
manageable.</TE>
<TE>   "And Nevadans do have a bit of an independent, libertarian streak,
and our research indicated they might be receptive to this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Nevadans are a conservative lot "who don't want their loved
ones exposed to the dangers of more drugs being available," said
Sandy Heverly, executive director of Stop DUI, which campaigned
alongside law enforcement agencies to defeat the pot issue.</TE>
<TE>   "Nevada has her vices ... and it leads people to believe anything
is acceptable here," she said. "It's not. Their agenda -- to legalize
drugs in Nevada today and then in Anytown, USA, tomorrow -- won't be
tolerated."</TE>
<TE>   Mirken conceded Wednesday that the nation may not be ready to
change its attitude toward the recreational smoking of marijuana. "We
knew that would be a substantial leap for people, but it was time to
put it on the table in a serious way. We ran into a conservative,
Republican trend. We've got some thinking and strategizing to do
before we attempt it again."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the group would continue to champion the
medicinal use of marijuana, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 202 ballot measures nationwide, 53 were initiated by voter
petitions and close to half of them were approved, according to an
analysis by the Initiative and Referendum Institute and
http://www.ballotwatch.org.</TE>

<LD>President Bush is expected to quickly revive his attempt to fill the
federal bench with conservatives, a prospect that already has
energized liberal advocacy groups to mobilize for a showdown in a
new, GOP-controlled Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Long frustrated by Democrats who have blocked some of his judicial
nominees, Bush recently declared a "vacancy crisis" and called on
voters to elect a GOP Senate -- a wish that came true Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   White House aides on Wednesday indicated that Bush could quickly
submit new judicial nominations, possibly including several who were
rejected by the Democratic- controlled Judiciary Committee.</LD>
<TE>   "Even in a Democrat-controlled Senate, there were enough Democrats
to confirm the president's judges; but the process was used to keep
them bottled up and killed in committee," said White House Press
Secretary Ari Fleischer. "I think those days may be over."</TE>
<TE>   He declined to discuss individual prospective nominees, citing a
longtime White House policy of not discussing personnel matters
prematurely.</TE>
<TE>   But legal sources mentioned several possibilities, including Texas
Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen and Charles W. Pickering, a
Mississippi jurist. Both nominees to the New Orleans-based U.S. 5th
Circuit Court of Appeals were rejected by the judiciary panel earlier
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Although Democrats will still be able to resort to tactics such as
the filibuster to try to block Bush's judicial picks, their minority
status will make the odds of success that much longer.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm convinced that the next two years will determine what the law
of the land will be for several decades. There's that much at stake,"
said Ralph Neas, president of People for the American Way, a liberal
advocacy group based here.</TE>
<TE>   For such groups, the worst-case scenario will be if vacancies on
the high court arise, because they fear Bush will appoint
conservatives in the mold of Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin
Scalia. "If the Scalia-Thomas court had one or two more like them,
more than 100 Supreme Court precedents would be overturned," Neas
predicted.</TE>
<TE>   Several justices, including Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist,
are rumored to have postponed their retirements until the political
climate becomes more favorable for their successors to be confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   And now, with Republicans soon to control the Senate, that
prospect looms, said Kate Michelman, head of the National Abortion
and Reproductive Rights Action League.</TE>
<TE>   "The implications are pretty serious," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The president has made no secret of the fact that one of his
goals in campaigning for Republican anti-choice senators around the
country was to gain control of the Judiciary Committee so that he
could succeed in appointing conservative judicial activists -- from
the Supreme Court to the district courts."</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists also were alarmed by the potential of a GOP
Senate's predisposition toward Bush's nominees.</TE>
<TE>   "We also have concerns with people already on the courts who have
extreme views that threaten basic protections for the environment and
public health," said Glenn Sugameli, an attorney with Earthjustice, a
nonprofit, public-interest law firm.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative activists, however, believe that the court needs more
jurists like Scalia and Thomas who would uphold their beliefs
opposing abortion and freeing businesses from environmental
constraints.</TE>
<TE>   Among the groups that hailed a GOP takeover of the Senate were the
Family Research Council and the Concerned Women for America, two
conservative activist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Genevieve Wood, a spokeswoman for the council, said the
organization would welcome the renominations of such judges as
Pickering and Owen.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no reason why those people can't be brought back," she
said. "They have the right credentials and solid judicial
philosophies."</TE>
<TE>   Concerned Women for America joined in calling on Bush to
renominate those who had been denied a full Senate vote. They include
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Carolyn Kuhl, whose nomination to
the San Francisco-based U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals was blocked
by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.); Miguel Estrada's nomination to the
District of Columbia Circuit; Michael W. McConnell to the 10th
Circuit, based in Denver; and Dennis Shedd to the 4th Circuit in
Richmond, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "The new Republican majority is a clear sign that the American
people are frustrated with obstruction tactics," said Thomas Jipping,
senior fellow in legal studies at Concerned Women for America. "In
many ways, the election was a referendum on the Democrats' policy of
obstructionism, and they lost."</TE>
<TE>   A ranking administration lawyer said the fact that the judiciary
panel will now be headed by a Republican "will change the whole world
for people like Kuhl" and others who have not been able to get
hearings because of Democratic opposition.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Bush has increasingly vented his frustration at
Senate Democrats for blocking his nominations.</TE>
<TE>   During a campaign appearance in Jackson, Miss., for Republican
Rep. Charles W. "Chip" Pickering of Mississippi, Bush raged at the
treatment of the candidate's father, Charles Pickering. "The people
who control the Senate maligned this good man's character.... We need
to change the United States Senate so that we end this kind of
politics on the judiciary and allow good people ... to serve our
nation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And just six days before the midterm elections, Bush proposed
overhauling the judicial nomination process, setting specific
deadlines for the Senate to act on each nomination -- a proposal
widely seen by Democrats as politically motivated.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also warned that 9% of all federal judgeships are vacant,
with a 17% vacancy rate at the 12 regional courts of appeals and a
one-third vacancy rate on the District of Columbia's Court of
Appeals, which handles many constitutional and far-reaching
regulatory issues.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats reject Bush's criticism that they have been slow to act
on his judicial nominations, noting that the Judiciary Committee has
voted on 100 such nominees, approving 98 in the 15 months since
Democrats took control of the Senate. In any case, Republicans such
as Senate GOP leader Trent Lott of Mississippi are eagerly
anticipating the prospect of confirming Bush's judicial nominees -- a
development that did not escape White House notice.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that control of the Senate has switched, I think it is far
more likely that many of these good, bipartisan names will be able to
move forward," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), who soon must turn over the
Judiciary Committee's chairmanship to Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah),
vowed to fight on.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration wants to immunize the government from
lawsuits for the next five years when endangered Florida manatees are
unintentionally injured or killed in collisions with government
watercraft or mishaps around docks, boat ramps and marinas.</LD>
<LD>   Sam Hamilton, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Southeast
regional director, said Wednesday that regulations under the Marine
Mammal Protection Act "expose government agencies to potential
liability" when manatees are harmed.</LD>
<LD>   The agency says the proposed regulatory change would apply to
northwest Florida counties along the Gulf of Mexico, the upper St.
John's River and the Atlantic Coast. Six hearings on the proposal
will be held next month in affected communities.</LD>
<TE>   In the proposal, the Fish and Wildlife Service said it also
intends stricter enforcement of speed zones in the Atlantic. The
government would still be liable for unintentional harm to manatees
in southwestern Florida counties along the Gulf Coast, where the
manatee population is considered to be under greater threat.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed regulatory changes were issued as U.S. District Judge
Emmet Sullivan again threatened to hold Interior Secretary Gale A.
Norton in contempt, this time because she did not meet a Friday
deadline for publishing the changes.</TE>

<HD>In Minnesota, Mondale Leaves Politics Quietly</HD>
<DH>He's dispatched in Senate race by Norm Coleman, who adds to
gains made by the GOP.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Slater</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. PAUL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale came out of retirement for
just one week before quietly and humbly returning Wednesday, ushered
back by a respectful and even somber Sen.-elect Norm Coleman, a
53-year-old Republican who has been down many times in his political
life only to rise again.</LD>
<LD>   As the strategists and pundits tried to make sense of the oddest,
saddest Senate race in the country -- pondering why traditionally
left-leaning Minnesotans contributed Tuesday to the Republicans'
gains nationwide -- the loser and the winner alike spoke to
supporters with near reverence.</LD>
<LD>   "In what is obviously the end of my last campaign, I want to say
to Minnesotans: 'You've always treated me decently, you've always
listened to me ... and now you've made your decision,' " said an
emotional Mondale, 74. "We respect it. I am so proud of this state
and so proud of its people."</LD>
<TE>   A few hours later, across town at the capital, it was the
53-year-old victor's turn. He too spoke in a tone befitting a
campaign that was changed irrevocably when his first opponent, Sen.
Paul Wellstone, was killed in a plane crash.</TE>
<TE>   "I am here at a time of almost indescribable joy ... but also at a
time of sadness," Coleman said. "We suffered, in the midst of this
most incredible campaign, the loss of our senator.</TE>
<TE>   "I will go more than halfway," he continued, "to make sure that no
one feels disenfranchised by the results" of Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   After Wellstone died, along with his wife, daughter and five
others, and Mondale agreed to fill in, election officials were forced
to create a separate ballot for the Senate race, and then count those
ballots by hand. The race remained close throughout the wee hours,
and it became clear only about 5 a.m. Wednesday that Coleman had
thwarted Mondale's charge.</TE>
<TE>   The race was frequently compared to two others -- the New Jersey
contest between former U.S. Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, a Democrat, and
Republican Doug Forrester; and the 2000 Senate race in Missouri in
which Democratic candidate Gov. Mel Carnahan was killed in a plane
crash but was elected anyway over Republican incumbent John Ashcroft.
Carnahan's wife, Jean, was appointed to take her late husband's
place.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Minnesota race was very different.</TE>
<TE>   Carnahan had ridden to Washington on what analysts came to call a
"sympathy vote," and, with only a two-year appointment, failed to
make her mark. She was defeated Tuesday by Republican Jim Talent, a
former congressman.</TE>
<TE>   The Lautenberg comparison was more fair, observers agreed, in that
the 78-year-old Lautenberg is a well-known former senator who stepped
in when Sen. Robert Torricelli bowed out of the contest as he came
under scrutiny for campaign finance discrepancies.</TE>
<TE>   Although Lautenberg had slightly more than three weeks to
campaign, that was still three times as long as Mondale had. And
Lautenberg faced a virtual unknown, Republican businessman Doug
Forrester, while Democrat Mondale faced in Coleman a veteran
politician who had built a formidable network of volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   "Coleman had been campaigning for Senate for two years, and for
two years before that he'd campaigned for governor and narrowly
lost," said Lilly Goren, a political scientist at the College of St.
Catherine, referring to Coleman's 1998 gubernatorial loss to Gov.
Jesse Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Lautenberg also was active in public life until just a year ago,
when he retired from the Senate, Goren noted, whereas Mondale has
kept a much lower profile since he was trounced in the 1984
presidential race by Ronald Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   The one event that many believed may have cost Mondale votes was a
memorial for Wellstone that for a time took on the air of a campaign
rally, angering many voters. Even Mondale expressed disappointment
with the partisanship.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, who hasn't lost the accent of his native Brooklyn, N.Y.,
here in "MinnesOHta," as natives pronounce it, first sought the
Democrat-Farmer-Labor Party's nomination for mayor of St. Paul in
1989, but didn't get it. He was overlooked again in 1993, but ran
against the nominee anyway, and won.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, he switched parties, and while mayor ran against Democrat
Hubert "Skip" Humphrey III and Reform Party candidate Ventura for the
governorship. When Ventura won, many here expected Coleman to fade
away when his mayorship ended.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, President Bush asked him to take on Wellstone, a serious
liberal with a famous get-out-the-vote machine in a Democratic state.</TE>
<TE>   Pundits again wrote off Coleman -- until he took the lead in the
polls earlier this year, a lead that Wellstone had closed just before
he died. And again they wrote Coleman off when Mondale, the dean of
Minnesota politicians, took Wellstone's place and, within days, the
lead in the polls.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very surprised," University of Minnesota political scientist
Lisa Disch said of the outcome. "I thought Minnesota voters would
take the balance of power in Washington very seriously," and vote for
a Democrat to keep Republicans from holding the White House, the
House of Representatives and the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we seeing a popular shift to the right here?" Disch asked
rhetorically. "And if so, what's bringing it about? Recession? War?
It's a very interesting change."</TE>
<TE>   One of the few people who didn't seem surprised by Coleman's clear
victory was Coleman, who campaigned tirelessly on the theme, it might
be said, of tirelessness.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll win this because of hard work," he said perhaps hundreds of
times at rallies.</TE>
<TE>   As he stood on the Capitol steps Wednesday with his wife, Laurie,
and children, Jacob and Sara, Coleman looked exhausted. And happy.
And, perhaps, sad. Friends say that despite his rancorous fight with
Wellstone, Coleman was deeply shaken by his death.</TE>
<TE>   In his brief remarks, Coleman explained how, during a traditional
Jewish wedding ceremony, the couple break a glass. "In part, it
signifies this time of greatest joy, [but] you also reflect on the
things that fall apart in life, the sadness and the tears," he said.
"I know that I have a lot of growing to do to stand in the shoes that
I now stand in."</TE>

<HD>Missouri's Affable New 'Go-To Guy'</HD>
<DH>The Senate race barely decided, GOP's Jim Talent already
has a long list of priorities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Even before Jim Talent took the stage at his victory party early
Wednesday, the elated crowd waving pompoms for him in a hotel
ballroom broke into a frenzied chant: "Swear him in! Swear him in!
Swear him in!"</LD>
<LD>   They won't have long to wait.</LD>
<LD>   The Republican Talent, a former congressman, squeaked past
incumbent Democrat Jean Carnahan, winning by fewer than 25,000 votes
the right to represent Missouri in the U.S. Senate. His triumph will
send him to Washington for four years, to finish out the term that
Carnahan was appointed to in 2000 after her husband won election
posthumously.</LD>
<TE>   Under Missouri law, Carnahan's term will end as soon as the
election results are certified. That should take about two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   When Talent gets to Washington, he has a long list of priorities
to tackle -- most of them neatly aligned with President Bush's
agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Talent promised Missouri voters that he would work to cut taxes,
to build a missile-defense system, to ban most abortions and to open
an Alaskan wildlife refuge to oil drilling.</TE>
<TE>   He wants to push private insurance companies to cover prescription
drugs.</TE>
<TE>   He wants to shore up Social Security. And he wants to do it all
with help from the Democrats -- even though his party will soon
control both the Senate and the House.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have to work together," Talent said in his victory
speech.</TE>
<TE>   It was a conciliatory ending to a bruising campaign. And it was,
by all accounts, very much in character for Jim Talent.</TE>
<TE>   In his eight years in the U.S. House, the 46-year-old lawyer with
the folksy manner and sharp mind for detail racked up a very
conservative voting record. He also earned a reputation as a
genuinely nice guy, eager to get along with his colleagues even as he
staked out positions that most Democrats could never support.</TE>
<TE>   When he set out to unseat Carnahan, some pundits predicted the
campaign would remain genteel, given both candidates' low-key
personalities.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, the stakes were too high for polite campaigning.
National interest groups -- business for Talent, labor for Carnahan
-- poured millions into the contest, airing acrid attack ads and
staging huge get-out-the-vote drives in recent days, with volunteers
going door-to-door in each party's strongholds, pleading with
residents to make it to the polls.</TE>
<TE>   Bush pulled out all the stops as well, making five campaign trips
to Missouri, including a rousing rally for Talent on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts credited Talent's victory to a strong turnout in rural
Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   Although he did worse than he had expected in urban and suburban
turf, his message seemed to resonate in the conservative farm towns.
So did his personality.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, he was a more engaging and appealing candidate," said
Steven Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St.
Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Talent ran a "puppy-dog Republican" campaign, Smith added -- "the
arched eyebrows, the demonstration of empathy ... the compassionate
conservatism."</TE>
<TE>   A father of three, Talent featured his children prominently in his
commercials.</TE>
<TE>   He quotes the Bible readily and speaks with an easy, down-home
demeanor; he dismisses the notion of weapon inspections in Iraq, for
instance, with a breezy "Been there, done that, got the T-shirt."
Promising to repeal the estate tax, he jokes: "Death is enough of a
burden without making it a taxable event." On human cloning: "I don't
want to live in a world where I'm walking down the sidewalk ... and
see myself coming."</TE>
<TE>   Under the affable slogans, Talent is known for his command of
complex issues, especially national defense, health care and welfare
reform. State GOP leader John Hancock predicted that, even as a
freshman, Talent will become "one of the absolute leaders in the
Senate ... a go-to guy for crafting policies."</TE>
<TE>   That prospect has such Democratic activists as Bridgette Williams
scrambling to assess what went wrong Tuesday -- and to figure out how
to fix it, fast.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, president of the Greater Kansas City AFL-CIO, vowed that
her group would start looking immediately for candidates who could
reenergize the Democratic base. Carnahan was proud to say that she
voted with Bush more than 70% of the time. Williams hopes the next
candidate the Democrats field will be proud to say that he or she
fought the Republicans tooth and nail.</TE>
<TE>   "If they ever want to get back in the game, the Democrats have to
go back to their roots and rethink what they stand for," Williams
said. "We've got to have candidates who are not afraid to speak out."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Rebuked Over Tape for Moussaoui</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>The federal judge overseeing the terrorist trial of Zacarias
Moussaoui chastised government prosecutors Wednesday for giving a
blank videotape to Moussaoui, after he asked for a copy of a
broadcast interview with an alleged organizer of last year's Sept. 11
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Moussaoui, 34, is accused of conspiring with 19 members of suicide
teams to commit terrorism, hijack aircraft and kill more than 3,000
people in four jetliners, the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   Moussaoui had asked for a videotape of a broadcast interview with
Ramzi Binalshibh, who was interviewed in June over two days in
Pakistan by an Al Jazeera investigative reporter. Days after the
broadcast, Binalshibh was captured in Pakistan.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said that the government's
handing over the blank tape was "an inexcusable error, which must be
corrected immediately." Moussaoui had complained in a sealed court
filing Tuesday about the blank tape.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office declined to comment
about the tape.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators believe that Binalshibh, a Yemeni, was a member of a
Hamburg, Germany-based terrorist cell led by Mohamed Atta, the
suspected leader of the hijackings. Binalshibh unsuccessfully sought
to enter the United States at least four times before Sept. 11 but
was refused a visa, and allegedly sent $14,000 to Moussaoui and
others from Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors disclosed earlier that a charred business card found
at the Sept. 11, 2001, crash site in Shanksville, Pa., bore a
handwritten address in Germany that was connected to a telephone
number belonging to Binalshibh. They said Moussaoui also had called
the phone number at that address.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said court papers outlining Moussaoui's complaint about
the blank tape were being kept sealed because they were "replete with
irrelevant and inflammatory rhetoric, including messages to third
parties and a prayer for the destruction of the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui, who is representing himself, is set to stand trial June
30.</TE>

<HD>O.J. Simpson Arrest Warrant Withdrawn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>A judge withdrew an arrest warrant for O.J. Simpson after his
attorney appeared in court Wednesday on a charge that the former
football star sped through a manatee zone in a power boat.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Ana Maria Pando had issued a bench warrant for Simpson after
he and his attorney missed a court hearing earlier in the day. The
warrant meant Simpson could have been arrested if he were stopped by
police.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorney Yale Galanter said he didn't attend the first
hearing because of a notification mix-up.</LD>
<TE>   Pando rescheduled the hearing for Nov. 22, said Ed Griffith, a
spokesman for the Miami-Dade state attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson was deciding whether to pay the $65 fine stemming from a
July 4 outing on Biscayne Bay, Galanter said. The second-degree
misdemeanor charge of failure to pay a citation would be dropped if
Simpson paid the fine, Griffith said.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson chose to plead innocent in September instead of paying the
fine. He was ticketed for creating a wake in a manatee zone near
downtown Miami, the equivalent of a speeding ticket.</TE>
<TE>   The plea, however, was filed five days after Simpson was issued an
"affidavit of noncompliance" by Judge Martin Shapiro for failing to
appear for a Sept. 12 arraignment.</TE>
<TE>   Galanter said that Simpson wasn't required to appear in court on
that date. He said the ticket was issued based on a subjective call
by the officer.</TE>
<TE>   Galanter has said a Simpson girlfriend, Christie Prody, and
another couple were on board the boat steered by Simpson, who now
lives in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson was acquitted of murder charges in the 1994 slayings of
his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman.</TE>
<TE>   A civil jury later held Simpson liable for the killings and
ordered him to pay the victims' survivors $33.5 million. He has not
worked since. Any money he makes could be seized to satisfy that
judgment, which remains largely unpaid.</TE>
<TE>   He continues to maintain his innocence in the killings.</TE>

<HD>Couple Believed to Have Plague</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A couple visiting from New Mexico are believed to have bubonic
plague, health officials said Wednesday. If the cases are confirmed,
they would be the first in New York City in more than 100 years.</LD>
<LD>   The two are "being evaluated for plague," Health Commissioner
Thomas Frieden told a news conference. The male patient, 53, is a
presumptive positive for the illness and is in critical condition, he
said. The female patient, 47, is in stable condition, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   There is no risk to New Yorkers as bubonic plague is not
contagious, Frieden said. Officials are "confident" the couple's
exposure to the plague occurred in New Mexico, he said.</LD>
<TE>   "All the epidemiological evidence suggests that these infections
were naturally acquired in New Mexico," Frieden said. The source of
the infection is "believed to be rodents or rodent fleas near their
home," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Plague is spread when an infected person has plague pneumonia and
coughs droplets containing the plague bacteria into air breathed by a
noninfected person.</TE>
<TE>   Bubonic plague, which swept through Europe during the Middle Ages,
has largely been eradicated. But the illness does still occur, with
about a dozen cases reported each year in the United States, mostly
in the rural Southwest, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The unidentified couple went to the emergency room at Beth Israel
Medical Center in Manhattan on Tuesday night after several days of
flu-like symptoms, high fevers and swollen lymph nodes, the hospital
said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   They were immediately placed in isolation, the hospital said.</TE>
<TE>   If detected early, the illness is treatable with antibiotics.
Bubonic plague occurs in areas where infection of wild animals is
common.</TE>
<TE>   Plague also is one of the most feared potential biological
weapons.</TE>

<HD>Looking to History, Pundits Never Saw This One Coming</HD>
<DH>Predictions made on the talk shows now look ludicrous. And
there is concern among pollsters about doing credible surveys in a
cynical age.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Johanna Neuman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Pundits and pollsters filled the airwaves last weekend with their
election predictions. They talked of races too tight to call, a
Senate likely to stay in Democratic hands and a president without
coattails.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Republicans have picked up five seats in the House so
far, and two in the Senate, recapturing that chamber with a 51-47
margin that could improve next month if Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.)
loses a runoff.</LD>
<LD>   The predictions now seem ludicrous, even among those with an ax to
grind.</LD>
<TE>   "George Bush has never had coattails," Democratic National
Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the
Press." By stumping at 90 campaign events and putting his prestige on
the line, President Bush "made a strategic error," McAuliffe said.</TE>
<TE>   McAuliffe's bluster can be dismissed as the expected cheerleading
of a partisan spinner, part of a party leader's job. But what of the
journalists and pollsters paid to exercise independent judgment? Why
did they miss the Republican victories?</TE>
<TE>   Robert Blendon, a political analyst who directs Harvard
University's Opinion Research Program, thinks the chattering class
failed to see the trend because they were seduced by history. Except
he thinks they were looking at the wrong textbooks.</TE>
<TE>   Conventional wisdom holds that presidents always lose votes in
Congress in their first midterm elections. But Franklin D. Roosevelt
picked up seats the year after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor,
and John F. Kennedy picked up seats the month after the Cuban missile
crisis. The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks may have had a similar effect
on this year's electorate.</TE>
<TE>   "The pundits should have been more alert to the possibility of a
different history," Blendon said. "After an attack, people want to
make the president strong."</TE>
<TE>   Pollsters also seemed to have blinders on, oblivious to the size
of the spreads. Most polls had Florida's Republican Gov. Jeb Bush in
a tight race against Democratic challenger Bill McBride, within the
4-percentage-point margin of error. He won running away, 56% to 43%.
Ditto in Georgia, where everyone said Democratic incumbent Sen. Max
Cleland would triumph but Republican Rep. Saxby Chambliss took it,
53% to 46%. Then there's Elizabeth Hanford Dole, the Republican
candidate in North Carolina's Senate race, who was said to be
clinging to a shrinking lead. She beat Erskine Bowles, 54% to 45%.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to portray polling as a science, but it's a witchcraft
kind of art," said Norm Ornstein, a political scholar at the American
Enterprise Institute. "When it comes to the midterm elections, we're
trying to predict how 35% of the electorate will vote, but we don't
know which 35% will turn out. It's beyond embarrassing."</TE>
<TE>   More distressing, he noted, is that there seems to be no penalty
for punditry that misses the mark. Like former football players
trying to call the Super Bowl or Wall Street analysts paid small
fortunes to forecast the market, political pundits are seen as
feeding the cultural imperative to fill the airwaves by predicting
the unpredictable: human behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the sin of broadcasting in the modern age," Ornstein said.
"No matter how wrong you are, the punishment is you get your own show
on cable television."</TE>
<TE>   To hear the pollsters tell it, their mistakes were less in the
numbers than in the air.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to sound like an apologist, but there's a pack
mentality," said Jennifer Duffy, who tracked Senate campaigns for the
Cook Political Report. "Over the weekend there started to be this
Democratic buzz and little data to back it up."</TE>
<TE>   ABC News predicted in its online note that Dole was in trouble.
The Washington Post hinted at a Democratic tilt, in Duffy's eyes. And
polls were all over the map. In Minnesota, a poll commissioned by the
St. Paul Pioneer Press and Minnesota Public Radio had Republican Norm
Coleman up by 6 points, while the Minneapolis Star-Tribune poll
predicted Democrat Walter F. Mondale by 5 points. With 98% of
precincts reporting, Coleman was leading, 50% to 47%.</TE>
<TE>   "There are widely divergent polls because everybody with three
telephone lines thinks they're a pollster," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of scientific credentials or professional standards for
pollsters is a concern to critics. Ever since the 1948 presidential
election, when pollsters stopped talking to voters three weeks before
the election and called it for Republican Thomas E. Dewey, the ghost
of Harry S. Truman (along with the famous and erroneous Chicago
Tribune headline proclaiming "Dewey Defeats Truman") has haunted
pollsters and journalists.</TE>
<TE>   But even within the cadre of professional pollsters, there is
growing concern about the ability to do credible polls in a cynical
age.</TE>
<TE>   John Zogby, a pollster who gained a near Zeus-like status in
political circles with his all-alone prediction in 1996 that Pat
Buchanan would win the New Hampshire primary, says that when he got
into the business in 1984, he could count on a healthy response rate
from voters he called. "When I started, two of every three voters
would answer the poll," he said. Now, angered by telemarketers and
less impressed by a long-distance call, more voters are hanging up.
Response rate is shrinking, and with it, credibility.</TE>
<TE>   "If the response rates go under 20%, it will be impossible to
claim that we have a representative sample," Zogby said.</TE>
<TE>   Zogby missed some races Tuesday -- "I really blew it in Colorado,"
he notes, where he picked Democrat Tom Strickland to win by 49% to
44%, and in fact Republican Wayne Allard took it away, 51% to 45%.</TE>
<TE>   But pollsters did much better on a national barometer of public
opinion called generic national polling. Calculated to take the
national pulse, the ballot asks voters, without naming names, whether
they would prefer a Republican or a Democrat in Congress. A Gallup
Poll over the weekend for USA Today and CNN found that in House
races, likely voters preferred Republicans to Democrats, 51% to 45%.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Edsall, a veteran political reporter for the Washington Post,
got an e-mail Monday from Anthony Fabrizio, the pollster for Bob
Dole's 1996 presidential race who now does GOP polling at Fabrizio,
McLaughlin &amp; Associates. In it, the firm predicted Republicans would
emerge with a 51-49 majority.</TE>
<TE>   Edsall promptly e-mailed back, saying he had as much faith in
Fabrizio's predictions as he did in a poker hand.</TE>

<HD>Alaska Oil Pipeline Reopens Following Post-Quake Repairs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ANCHORAGE, Alaska</DL>
<LD>Oil began flowing through the trans-Alaska pipeline again Wednesday
morning, after crews made repairs following a magnitude 7.9
earthquake Sunday that moved the line up to 7 feet in places.</LD>
<LD>   "They're slowly, slowly, slowly ramping up," said Mike Heatwole of
Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. "They're going to watch that section
closely."</LD>
<LD>   The line, which carries about one-sixth of the nation's oil
production, was shut down after Sunday's earthquake. There were no
leaks or spills, but the pipeline moved horizontally during the
temblor, and some supports were damaged.</LD>
<TE>   Aftershocks were continuing in the region around the damaged
pipeline supports, and Marnie Isaacs of Alyeska said officials want
to make sure temporary supports placed under the line in several
places are adequate to absorb new quakes.</TE>
<TE>   Tanker loading at Valdez could resume as early as this morning,
Heatwole said.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from halting the oil flow, Sunday's quake caused major
damage to roads and some other facilities.</TE>
<TE>   State officials said temporary repairs were in place allowing
traffic to move on most major roadways.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of repairing quake-damaged roads will be about $20
million, said Joseph Perkins, commissioner of the Department of
Transportation and Public Facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The Alaska Earthquake Information Center reported two minor quakes
Wednesday morning, one magnitude 3.9 and the other 4.0. Dozens have
been logged since the major quake Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The affected area of the pipeline is about 150 miles south of
Fairbanks in a region that was known to be earthquake-prone when the
line was built. Special precautions were taken along that section of
the line, which is above ground.</TE>
<TE>   The Sunday earthquake was reportedly so strong that it churned up
waves on a Louisiana lake and rippled swimming pools on the East
Coast. It also temporarily muddied well water in homes more than
3,000 miles away, geologists said.</TE>
<TE>   Well-drilling companies got scores of calls this week from
Pennsylvania customers complaining about water turning cloudy or
muddy.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really brown, like diluted iced tea," said Joanne Volm of
Harleysville, Pa. "The kids didn't want to bathe in it."</TE>
<TE>   Waverly Person, a U.S. Geological Survey geophysicist in Golden,
Colo., said stirred-up wells were widespread.</TE>
<TE>   "This type of phenomenon happens with big, shallow earthquakes,"
Person said. "The surface waves from this earthquake were recorded
for hours and they were just rolling around and around the Earth."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the strength of Sunday's quake, no serious injuries were
reported.</TE>

<HD>Voters Back Tougher Smoking Restrictions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RENO</DL>
<LD>Voters in Nevada's two most populous counties told lawmakers in the
state with the largest percentage of smokers in the nation that they
don't want kids and cigarettes in the same building.</LD>
<LD>   Clark and Washoe counties approved virtually identical advisory
measures Tuesday to toughen local restrictions on smokers beyond
state law and ban smoking entirely in places children are likely to
be.</LD>
<LD>   Both issues will be submitted to the next Legislature.</LD>
<TE>   Erin Dixon, tobacco control program coordinator for Washoe County,
said the first measure is a matter of local control over smoking.</TE>
<TE>   The second would ban all smoking in schools, grocery stores,
restaurants and government buildings, which often have designated
smoking areas.</TE>
<TE>   The measures won similar support in both counties -- about 3 to 2
for the tougher restrictions and 2 to 1 for the broader ban on
smoking.</TE>
<TE>   One-third of adult Nevadans smoke, compared with 20% nationally.</TE>
<TE>   Clark County voters also turned back any tax increases to fund
services to the homeless, while Washoe County rejected fluoridating
its water and continuing with the Reno train trench project, all by
margins of about 3 to 2.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Nevada voters told the Legislature they're unhappy with
Nevada Power Co. after its request for nearly $1 billion in rate
hikes and are looking for a public takeover.</TE>
<TE>   An advisory measure passed 57% to 43% despite the almost $1.6
million Nevada Power spent fighting it. State Consumer Advocate Tim
Hay said customers are disappointed with Nevada Power and want a
change. About half of the rate hike request was rejected by state
regulators.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern Nevada Water Authority has offered $3.2 billion to
buy the Las Vegas-based electric utility from its stockholder-owned
parent, Sierra Pacific Resources of Reno. The utility's executives
say Nevada Power's not for sale.</TE>
<TE>   On the eastern Nevada line, voters in both Wendovers favor
consolidation. Now it's up to the two city governments, the states of
Nevada and Utah, Congress and ultimately the president.</TE>
<TE>   Voters in casino-rich West Wendover, Nev., approved the merger of
the two cities, 248 to 191. And on the depressed Utah side, Wendover
voters approved the merger, 110 to 61.</TE>
<TE>   It's an advisory measure, so none of the governments is bound by
the voting.</TE>
<TE>   The unification would require moving the state line to include the
Utah Wendover in Nevada, a move that would require congressional
approval. Republican Reps. Jim Gibbons of Nevada and James V. Hansen
of Utah co-sponsored the annexation bill in the House.</TE>

<HD>Sniper Suspects Charged in Killing of Virginia Woman</HD>
<DH>Prosecutor says he has enough evidence to go to trial in
FBI analyst's slaying. It's still unclear which jurisdiction will try
the pair first.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FAIRFAX, Va.</DL>
<LD>A Virginia prosecutor charged sniper suspects John Allen Muhammad and
17-year-old Lee Boyd Malvo with capital murder Wednesday in the
killing of an FBI analyst, saying he believes he has sufficient
evidence to go to trial immediately.</LD>
<LD>   Muhammad and Malvo, who have been accused in 17 shootings in four
states and Washington, D.C., were charged with murder in the Oct. 14
shooting of Linda Franklin in the parking deck of a Home Depot. They
also were charged with using a firearm in the commission of a felony.</LD>
<LD>   Fairfax Commonwealth Atty. Robert F. Horan Jr. said he waited
longer than other prosecutors to bring charges because he wanted to
see the evidence in the case. He said his decision to act now is
"because I was satisfied I had enough evidence to go to trial."</LD>
<TE>   It remained uncertain which jurisdiction will try the suspects
first. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said Wednesday that the decision will
be made after a "fact-driven analysis" of where prosecutors have the
best evidence and the best law to bring about the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's well-understood on my part that I believe
appropriate penalties for the kinds of atrocities that have been
committed to include the ultimate sanction of the death penalty,"
Ashcroft told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The two men have been accused of killing 12 people and wounding
five in Alabama, Louisiana, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad was indicted in Fairfax County by a grand jury; Malvo was
charged in a juvenile court petition, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Horan, who wouldn't discuss specific evidence in the case,
rejected the idea that prosecutors have been bickering over who will
try the snipers first. He called it "absolute nonsense."</TE>
<TE>   "It's the duty of each of us to pursue homicide charges," Horan
said. He said he will respect Ashcroft's decision about who
prosecutes first, but that if the attorney general defers to the
states, Virginia should go first because it has a strong death
penalty statute "that has stood the test of time."</TE>
<TE>   Horan added that if the case is sent to Virginia, he'll meet with
the prosecutors in Prince William and Spotsylvania counties, where
fatal sniper shootings also took place, to decide who will prosecute
first based on the best evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Investigations are pending into several other shootings, including
one in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement sources have said a laptop computer seized from
Muhammad's car was stolen Sept. 5 in a robbery-shooting outside a
pizzeria in Prince George's County, Md. An employee was wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors earlier filed charges against Muhammad under
weapons and extortion laws that could bring the death penalty.
Federal charges also have apparently been brought against Malvo, but
officials will not say so because he is a juvenile.</TE>
<TE>   State's Atty. Douglas Gansler of Montgomery County, Md., who filed
six murder charges against the suspects, said the ultimate decision
rests with the federal government, which has the men in custody.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft said he has met twice with FBI Director Robert S. Mueller
III to discuss evidence in the case and is working closely with state
investigators in reaching his decision.</TE>

<HD>Gone With the Winds of Change: Democrats in Georgia</HD>
<DH>For the first time since Reconstruction, the Republicans
grab the governorship. Victory underscores the new politics in the
South.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ken Ellingwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Georgians awoke Wednesday to find their state's political landscape
reshaped by a Republican upset that swept out an incumbent U.S.
senator and installed the state's first GOP governor in 130 years.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts and political operatives described the scale of the
Republican win -- which also toppled a long-reigning House speaker
and blunted Democrats' hopes of dominating Georgia's congressional
delegation -- as nothing short of historic in a state that became the
last to elect a Republican governor since Reconstruction.</LD>
<LD>   The GOP victories that unseated Democratic Sen. Max Cleland and
Gov. Roy Barnes, analysts said, signaled that the Republican tide
that years ago washed over much of the South finally had lapped up on
Georgia's shores in a meaningful way.</LD>
<TE>   "We're headed for a new day in Georgia politics," proclaimed a
weary but ebullient Saxby Chambliss, a four-term House Republican who
defeated Cleland by 7 percentage points after a $25-million contest
most notable for its acrimonious tone.</TE>
<TE>   The Chambliss win -- and an even more surprising victory by
Republican Sonny Perdue in the governor's contest -- were "stunning"
results for Georgia, said Michael Binford, a political scientist at
Georgia State University. "It was a major upset. People are still
trying to figure out what was going on."</TE>
<TE>   Theories fluttered like yesterday's campaign posters. But there
was general agreement on several factors explaining the Republican
sweep in Georgia, including the trend favoring the GOP nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Most observers agreed that Chambliss, along with Republican
candidates in close contests around the country, benefited heavily
from the popularity of President Bush, who visited Georgia three
times recently on the congressman's behalf. The most recent
presidential swing came Saturday, amid polls that showed Cleland's
lead dwindling.</TE>
<TE>   "George Bush was very effective at getting support to Saxby
Chambliss. He campaigned for him extensively, raising money, and
helped him in the debate on homeland security," Binford said.</TE>
<TE>   Chambliss, who chairs a House subcommittee on terrorism, appeared
to have gained from the public's anxiety over homeland security since
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In one television commercial hammering Cleland as soft on national
security, photographs of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein flashed
on the screen to accent descriptions of how Cleland had voted
repeatedly against homeland security legislation favored by Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The national defense gambit was all the more remarkable because
Cleland -- who preferred a competing homeland security measure that
he said provided better worker protections -- lost his right arm and
both legs during combat in Vietnam. He once ran the Department of
Veteran Affairs. Cleland objected that his patriotism was being
questioned, but some damage was done.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes' loss in the gubernatorial race was more surprising. He
made ample use of the largess afforded by his incumbency, spending
about $20 million -- six times the amount spent by Perdue, a state
senator who switched from Democrat to Republican in 1998. Polls gave
Barnes the lead going into the final days of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But Barnes, who was at the end of his first term, fell victim to
voter resentment over several of his more controversial moves as
governor -- including creation of a new state flag that greatly
shrank the prominence of the Confederate battle flag symbol.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes privately approved the design last year, which was whisked
through the state Legislature without debate. The maneuver angered
many Georgia residents, particularly rural voters who showed up in
high numbers Tuesday to register their displeasure with Barnes.</TE>
<TE>   Perdue has said he favors putting the flag issue to a referendum.
Turnout was noticeably higher in many rural counties that picked
Perdue over Barnes.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes also faced displeasure from teachers opposed to his
education reform program and from opponents of a controversial
highway, called the Northern Arc, that is planned in the outskirts of
Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   The state teachers union, which normally favors Democrats, did not
endorse a candidate.</TE>
<TE>   A redistricting plan favoring the Democrats also appeared heavy
handed to many voters.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of smaller groups of people antagonized by the
governor for one reason or another," said Whit Ayres, an
Atlanta-based GOP pollster.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Ayres and others described Tuesday's results as a
breakthrough for Republicans in Georgia, where the GOP managed to
align their upscale voters in the suburbs with rural residents in
corners of the state where Democrats once held sway.</TE>
<TE>   The defeat of House Speaker Tom Murphy, who served for 42 years
and was the archetype of the old-style, loyal, "yellow dog" Democrat,
was one more sign of just how much politics here suddenly looks
different.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Republicans who were appropriating the rhetoric of the
civil rights era. "Free at last! Free at last! Thank God almighty,
free at last!" Perdue exulted before a jubilant crowd of backers. In
the crowd, a supporter waved the former state flag dominated by the
Confederate symbol.</TE>
<TE>   While other states in the South grew accustomed to electing
Republicans as governors and senators during the last 30 years, the
Democratic Party's lock on Georgia held.</TE>
<TE>   Ayres said that was partly due to a lack of "superstar" GOP
candidates in the mold of Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and to the
appeal of right-leaning Democrats, such as Zell Miller, who now will
be the state's ranking U.S. senator.</TE>
<TE>   But even Democrats conceded that that era may be over.</TE>
<TE>   To them, the state's political map is stark and bifurcated:
Atlanta remains a Democratic stronghold -- thanks in part to a
sizable black population -- while much of the rest of the state may
have more in common with Republicans than with a national Democratic
leadership, which it views as too liberal. In the middle is a
suburban belt that promises to be the battleground of the future,
said Tim Phillips, who managed Barnes' campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "The fight is over the SUV drivers, not the pickup truck drivers,"
Phillips said. "The fight over the pickup truck drivers is over."</TE>
<TE>   But all is not lost for the Democrats -- the Republicans now have
to govern with a legislature still controlled by Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "What that means to the future of Georgia depends on how
Republicans operate in office and how the Democrats respond,"
Phillips said. "It's certainly not hopeless."</TE>

<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Democrats knew they had talked a big game. They could see that they
were up against culture, current events and inertia, that it would be
hard to seize any, let alone all, of the state's top elected slots.</LD>
<LD>   But few analysts forecast the dramatic stumble Texas Democrats
took this week. After all the racial strategizing, all the cash and
all the heady expectations, the party ended the campaign exactly
where it began: utterly marginalized in a government flush with
President Bush's former statehouse friends. In a downfall probably
caused by voters' paltry participation, Democrats once again failed
to win a single statewide election.</LD>
<LD>   "This was supposed to have been a heroic effort," University of
Texas political scientist Bruce Buchanan said. "But apparently the
[Democratic] turnout machine didn't work. They spent plenty of money,
but we have to infer that it wasn't effective."</LD>
<TE>   In the end, the Democrats failed to lure the white, centrist vote
they needed to sway the election, analysts said. Moreover, the
racially mixed ticket apparently wasn't enough to galvanize the
state's minority vote in the numbers Democrats had needed to overcome
the weight of incumbency -- and the influence of the former
Republican governor in the White House.</TE>
<TE>   "The Democratic Party will really have to go back to the drawing
board and figure out what went wrong," Democratic consultant George
Strong said, "and why they can't appeal to Anglo voters."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't long ago that Texas was a sturdy Democratic bastion. It
was in the 1980s that, tugged by conservative economics and pushed
away by liberal social politics, white voters turned en masse to the
Republicans. A weakened Democratic Party was left hungry to yank the
state back, and it saw its salvation in demographics. The party
looked to the burgeoning Latino population, and upheld the "browning"
of Texas as the proof positive that Democrats would rise again in the
land of LBJ.</TE>
<TE>   And so they ignored the odds, assembled a "dream team" of
candidates, and declared 2002 the year of the great comeback.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats picked Ron Kirk, the business-friendly centrist who had
made history as Dallas' first black mayor, for the Senate race. Next
tapped was Tony Sanchez, a Latino oilman who rallied the crowds with
flawless Spanish and promised to wrest the governor's office from the
grip of career politicians. The party rounded out the ticket with a
white candidate for lieutenant governor named John Sharp, a
perennially popular legislator and comptroller.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts point to Sanchez as the comeback's soft spot. In
debates and vigorous advertisements, Republican incumbent Rick Perry
hammered at his opponent -- and there were plenty of opportunities
for attack.</TE>
<TE>   Most damaging was a recent spot that linked Sanchez to drug
traffickers who killed a Drug Enforcement Administration agent in
Mexico. That final blow got Sanchez angry enough to call Perry "a
liar," and it drew angry rebukes from groups who believed Republicans
were playing on racist stereotypes about wealthy Latinos. But the
damage was done.</TE>
<TE>   "The candidate at the top of the ticket for Democrats had a flaw,"
Rice University political scientist Bob Stein said. "He may not be a
crook, and he may not even be negligent, but what Rick Perry was able
to convey was that this guy was not the guy" to run the state.</TE>
<TE>   It was Sanchez who lost most dramatically -- by a ratio of nearly
2 to 1 -- and who was most reluctant to concede. The oil magnate
emerged bleary-eyed Wednesday to deliver a terse concession speech in
Austin, then turned away without answering questions.</TE>
<TE>   Going into the elections, Democratic die-hards admitted -- some
privately, some publicly -- that a complete turnaround was highly
improbable. Sanchez was lagging far down in the polls going into the
election. Kirk was closer, but Sharp was the only candidate who
appeared poised to win without staging an upset.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough when you've got the former governor sitting in the
White House," said Democratic contributor Aletha Beane, 59. "I have
friends who vote Republican because they think it's the churchy thing
to do."</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats expected to come closer than they did. Kirk hoped to
come within spitting range of his GOP rival, Atty. Gen. John Cornyn,
and an upset was regarded as a strong possibility. Instead, Kirk lost
with 42% of the vote to Cornyn's 56%.</TE>
<TE>   In the race for lieutenant governor, Sharp narrowly lost to
Republican David Dewhurst, a state land commissioner and former CIA
agent.</TE>
<TE>   Then there were the lower ballot races, where Democrats hoped to
catch some votes.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of volunteers streamed through minority and lower-income
neighborhoods on election day to pound on doors and offer free
baby-sitting or a ride to the polls.</TE>
<TE>   The Democrats counted on the "knock and drag" ritual to
counterbalance the voting in the white, generally Republican suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   It was the last-minute get-out-the-vote effort, they said, that
would prove that the pollsters had undercounted minority voters and
therefore underestimated Democratic standing.</TE>
<TE>   But if anything, the polls overstated the Democrats' position.</TE>

<HD>TV Networks Learn to Do Without Exit Poll System</HD>
<DH>Media firms use their own data and election tallies as
backup plans to Voter News Service.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the television networks' fierce quest to be over-prepared and
competitive on election night, some discovered they can make do
without Voter News Service, the consortium of broadcast and print
news organizations that provides exit polling information from across
the country.</LD>
<LD>   VNS, which took the fall for the erroneous early projections
during the 2000 election, set out last year to overhaul its hardware
and method of analysis but warned many networks that Tuesday night
could be touch and go because of the roll-out.</LD>
<LD>   All of the members of the 12-year-old consortium -- Fox News
Service, Associated Press, CNN, NBC, CBS and ABC -- came up with
backup plans. CBS and NBC, for example, polled 2,600 people the
weekend before the election and then used tabulated votes from both
VNS and AP on election night. Fox News Service polled 900 voters
Tuesday night in 10 key states with tightly fought races, including
Texas, Minnesota and Colorado.</LD>
<TE>   Not to be outdone, CNN executives built their own mini-version of
VNS called "RealVote," which cost an estimated $1 million for more
than 600 workers to fan out to sample precincts in 10 states and
report back with actual vote tallies.</TE>
<TE>   "We were capable of making calls without relying solely on VNS,"
CNN spokeswoman Christa Robinson said Wednesday. "We had a safety
net, and it worked."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, CNN was able to call the Florida governor's race for
incumbent Jeb Bush at 8:20 p.m., well ahead of VNS and most other
networks, based on "RealVote."</TE>
<TE>   Inside the control room Tuesday, CNN executives had the data to
make the call even earlier, at 8 p.m., but political director Tom
Hannon sent it back through the computer for double-checking, amid
nervous laughter about the need to get it right, given the problems
with calling the state in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   If VNS' election coverage was messy Tuesday for the "greater good"
of the presidential election in 2004, the networks' day-after
conclusions about how to plan for that race varied.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Shine, executive producer at Fox, said simply: "Absolutely
we'll have a backup," while CNN, CBS, NBC and ABC said they had to
evaluate their options. ABC spokeswoman Cathie Levine said executives
will be looking at their coverage and at VNS' problems and then will
"ask some tough questions."</TE>
<TE>   All five  networks and AP pay a fee to belong to VNS, although
they each have the option to leave the service. Shine is betting
every network executive will conduct a VNS post-mortem.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure head executives are asking, 'What do we next?' " said
Shine. " 'Where do we go from here? Can we trust it? Will it work in
the future?' "</TE>
<TE>   In terms of style, the comparative lack of VNS-supplied analysis
struck viewers differently. Some, like GOP pollster Anthony Fabrizio,
thought he was getting only half the story.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I was back in the 1960s, waiting for Univac to spit
the stuff out," he said. "After the 2000 election, I think maybe they
tried to fix something that may not have been broken. Florida was
called wrong in 2000 for several reasons."</TE>

<HD>White House Looks to Move Bush Agenda</HD>
<DH>President doesn't gloat over GOP wins and calls for
bipartisan support in lame-duck session.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Sometime before he quit tracking the election results -- he took his
final call from political advisor Karl Rove at roughly 2 a.m. EST --
President Bush told his aides, "I'll be sleeping in."</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, he was uncharacteristically tardy in reaching the Oval
Office on Wednesday. He didn't get to work until shortly after 7 a.m.
-- about 10 minutes later than usual.</LD>
<LD>   But when he showed up, said a senior aide, "There was a spring in
his step."</LD>
<TE>   For good reason. Bush campaigned long and hard for the GOP cause
this fall, and the outcome could hardly have been more pleasing.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than suffering losses common to the president's party
during midterm elections, the Republicans recaptured the Senate and
widened their slim margin of control in the House.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Bush's mission Wednesday -- and that of his aides --
was to avoid any public display that could look like gloating.</TE>
<TE>   Bush spent much of the day on the telephone, congratulating
winners, consoling losers and meeting with aides about the
legislative agenda -- for the lame-duck session of Congress that
begins next week and the 108th Congress that convenes in January,
aides said.</TE>
<TE>   He had no meetings, other than with staff members, and kept well
out of the public eye.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer made an effort to present the
administration as reaching out to Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   As he listed calls that Bush made to candidates, the first name he
mentioned was Mark Pryor, the Arkansas Democrat who unseated
Republican Sen. Tim Hutchinson, for whom Bush had campaigned on
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The White House staff was in a festive mood -- as one senior aide
described it, "a cross between euphoric and unbelieving." There was a
steady stream of hugs exchanged as staffers encountered each other in
their quiet, compact West Wing quarters.</TE>
<TE>   When Rove arrived at 7:30 a.m. at the daily meeting of the White
House senior staff in the Roosevelt Room, near the president's
office, his colleagues greeted him with prolonged applause, said one
participant.</TE>
<TE>   Then, this aide said, they quickly got to work, paying little heed
to ubiquitous television reports that throughout the day detailed the
voting results.</TE>
<TE>   The immediate problem for the White House -- if it can be called a
problem -- was how to portray the results. Fleischer, mindful of the
decision not to appear overjoyed, declined to claim a mandate for the
president.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the suggestion of a voters' mandate crept into the White
House reviews of the results.</TE>
<TE>   "The president is going to continue to press for his agenda. He
thinks it is worthy and deserving of bipartisan support. And I think
that was the message we heard last night from the country," Fleischer
said.</TE>
<TE>   One veteran of senior White House jobs in previous GOP
administrations said that after speaking with White House aides, "The
mood from the president on down is 'let's roll up our sleeves and
figure out how we'll work in a bipartisan fashion.' "</TE>
<TE>   This source, who did not want to be named, added: "But there is a
deep sense of accomplishment, and a smile on everybody's faces."</TE>

<HD>Yale, Stanford Drop Early Pledges</HD>
<DH>Schools will shift to nonbinding programs that will allow
students greater choice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rebecca Trounson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two of the nation's most competitive universities announced Wednesday
that they will drop their binding early admission programs in favor
of less controversial alternatives.</LD>
<LD>   In separate announcements within hours of each other, Yale and
Stanford said they are abandoning "early decision" programs under
which students apply months early to a single institution and pledge
to enroll if accepted. Critics say the programs, in place at many of
the nation's top schools, have contributed to a growing frenzy
surrounding the college admission process and favor affluent
students, whose parents and high schools tend to be the most
sophisticated about the process.</LD>
<LD>   Both universities said they will shift to nonbinding "early
action" programs, in which students also apply and are accepted
months before the traditional spring admission cycle -- but are not
required to decide immediately whether they will attend. At both
institutions, the change will take effect for those starting college
in the fall of 2004.</LD>
<TE>   In making his announcement, Yale President Richard C. Levin said
he has grown increasingly troubled by what he and others see as
stress and other negative effects brought about by the early decision
programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Students shouldn't have to make a final decision so early in
their senior year [of high school]," Levin said in an interview. "By
loosening our early admission rules, we will reduce the need for
students to make these strategic decisions about where to apply
first."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he said, "we can help level the playing field for
students who need financial aid." Students who require help paying
for college are often uncomfortable applying early because they need
to compare financial aid packages offered by various schools.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, Levin proposed that his and other elite institutions
agree to abandon the binding programs and, in a sign of how
competitive the college admission process has become, said his
university could not afford to make such a move alone.</TE>
<TE>   Levin's comments last fall helped fuel a growing debate over the
early programs. It was further intensified by new research showing
that early application to a competitive school improved the odds for
admission by the equivalent of about 100 extra points on the SAT
exam.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Levin said Yale had decided to go forward on its own
and hoped other schools might follow suit. "We feel strongly that
this is the right thing to do," he said, despite the risk that the
move might result in fewer students accepting Yale's offer of
admission.</TE>
<TE>   For colleges, a clear benefit of the binding early admission
programs is that they allow the schools to lock in talented young
scholars early, thus enhancing their standings in influential
rankings published by U.S. News &amp; World Report and others.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford, which has had an early decision program since the
mid-1990s, made its own announcement late Wednesday. University
officials said the decision was independent of Yale's but was also
timed to come after the Nov. 1 deadline for this fall's early
applicants.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford said it had hoped to have time to consult with the
National Assn. for College Admission Counseling, whose guidelines
urge colleges to allow students to apply early to as many schools as
they want.</TE>
<TE>   But the school went ahead when it learned of Yale's announcement.</TE>
<TE>   Both Stanford and Yale's new policies ask students to agree not to
file early applications to other schools, although they are free to
apply elsewhere in the regular spring admissions cycle and make a
final choice in May.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard, which until Wednesday was alone in the Ivy League in
offering a nonbinding early action policy, sparked a brief furor this
summer by hinting that it might continue requiring its early action
applicants not to apply early elsewhere. It eventually bowed to the
admission group's guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear Wednesday how many other competitive schools
might follow Yale and Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   At least one, the University of Pennsylvania, said it is not
considering a change. Admissions dean Lee Stetson, an outspoken
proponent of binding early decision, said he continued to believe
that the program benefits students and universities such as his.</TE>
<TE>   He also predicted that the publicity was likely to raise the
profile of such options at Penn and other universities.</TE>

<HD>Study Finds No Link Between MMR Vaccine and Autism</HD>
<DH>Danish researchers say results are relevant in trying to
understand rise in U.S. cases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rosie Mestel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A study of 500,000 Danish children has found no link between
receiving the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and developing the
devastating childhood disorder known as autism.</LD>
<LD>   The study, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine,
is the latest of several studies to negate the suspicion, held by
many parents, that the MMR vaccine is behind the recent dramatic rise
in autism cases. In California, the number of autistic children
receiving services from the state's Department of Developmental
Services climbed 273% between 1987 and 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Although the study is from Denmark, it is relevant for the United
States, the authors said. The two countries use the same MMR vaccine
and use very similar medical criteria for diagnosing autistic
children.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier studies had concluded there is no evidence of a MMR-autism
link. But several scientists said the study was particularly powerful
because it was so large and allowed researchers to track children
individually.</TE>
<TE>   All residents of Denmark are given an identification number, and
later medical events such as vaccinations and psychiatric diagnoses
are routinely recorded.</TE>
<TE>   The study, led by epidemiologist Dr. Kreesten Meldgaard Madsen of
the Danish Epidemiology Science Center, analyzed data for all Danish
children born between January 1991 and December 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Of those 537,303 children, 440,655 had received an MMR vaccine and
96,648 had not. A total of 316 had been diagnosed with autistic
disorder, and 422 had been diagnosed with other, closely related
conditions collectively known as autism spectrum disorders.</TE>
<TE>   Analyzing the data, the scientists found that children who had
been vaccinated were statistically no more likely to develop autism
than children who had not been vaccinated.</TE>
<TE>   The study was co-authored by scientists at the Danish center in
Aarhus and Copenhagen, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope the study finally lays to rest the idea that the MMR
vaccine causes autism," said Dr. Jay M. Lieberman, chief of pediatric
infectious diseases at Miller Children's Hospital in Long Beach.
Lieberman said that he has been troubled by an increase in the
numbers of parents refusing the MMR vaccination out of fears that it
will hurt their children.</TE>
<TE>   Measles kills about 600,000 people worldwide each year, Lieberman
said. It killed more than 140 people in the United States during a
1989-91 outbreak caused by inadequate vaccination among
schoolchildren. Rubella causes birth defects when it infects pregnant
women, and was once a leading cause of deafness in the U.S. before
MMR vaccinations became routine.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists are still seeking an explanation for the apparent rise
in autism cases. They know that genetics is involved -- autism tends
to run in families -- and have narrowed down the location of some of
the possible genes. Because the rate of the disorder appears to have
risen, scientists are also investigating possible environmental
factors such as exposure to thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative
used in some vaccines. The MMR vaccine does not contain thimerosal.</TE>
<TE>   But many scientists still suspect that at least some of the
seeming rise is due to increased diagnosis instead of an actual
increase. Parents, teachers and doctors are all far more aware of
autism than in years past, said Catherine Lord, professor of
psychology and psychiatry at the University of Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   A recent UC Davis study concluded that the steep increase in
California cases could not be explained in this fashion. Until
larger-scale surveys are undertaken, "I think we just don't know,"
Lord said.</TE>
<TE>   Parent activists who strongly suspect an MMR-autism link say the
Danish study still does not lay the matter to rest.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not at all convinced by it," said Bernard Rimland, director
of the Autism Research Institute in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Rimland said that rates of autism in the Danish study were lower
than those in the U.S., leading him to suspect that data could not be
extrapolated to the U.S. situation.</TE>
<TE>   Liz Birt, a Chicago-based activist and mother of an autistic
child, said the study was flawed because it did not look at the
effect of the MMR vaccine on a certain type of autism that she
believes is linked.</TE>

<HD>Cholesterol Drugs May Help MS Patients</HD>
<DH>Study finds statins, now used to treat heart ailments, may
also fight autoimmune diseases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas H. Maugh II</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A widely used family of cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins may
provide an effective, inexpensive treatment for multiple sclerosis,
several studies suggest.</LD>
<LD>   One small trial in humans is already underway and a second, larger
one will probably begin early next year, researchers said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The statins have revolutionized the treatment of heart disease,
reducing heart attack deaths substantially in patients with high
cholesterol levels and even in those with normal levels. The new
studies suggest that the drugs will also prove valuable in treating
autoimmune diseases -- not only multiple sclerosis, but perhaps
insulin-dependent diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and others.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the successes in animals, experts cautioned physicians
against prescribing the drugs for MS patients before trials are
completed.</TE>
<TE>   "We know these drugs are pretty safe when given to people who have
high cholesterol, who are usually older and who have heart disease,"
said Patricia A. O'Looney, director of Biomedical Research Programs
for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. "The question is, can it
be given safely to someone who has MS, who is younger and who has
regular cholesterol levels?"</TE>
<TE>   Researchers are excited nonetheless because the preliminary
results look promising. In addition to the two previously mentioned
trials, researchers are also drawing up plans for other trials in
which statins would be used in conjunction with existing therapies in
an effort to boost their effectiveness. "There are going to be many
other trials," said Dr. Scott Zamvil of UC San Francisco, who led the
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that afflicts an
estimated 250,000 to 350,000 people in the United States and more
than 1 million worldwide. For reasons that are not clear, the immune
system of patients attacks and destroys the myelin sheathes that,
like the insulation on copper wire, coat nerve fibers.</TE>
<TE>   Destruction of the myelin, in effect, short-circuits the nerves,
leading to a spectrum of symptoms, including poor muscle control,
paralysis, blindness, brain damage and death. Current treatments
include three forms of synthetically produced interferons and a
totally synthetic polymer called copaxone. Each of these must be
given by injection, and they are expensive, ranging from $10,000 to
as much as $17,000 per year. They are effective only about a third of
the time, and they can have significant side effects.</TE>
<TE>   Statins, in contrast, are taken orally and are substantially
cheaper. They have been taken by millions of Americans and have few
side effects, although liver and muscle damage can occur in rare
cases. The drugs block the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver.</TE>
<TE>   The current research on statins was stimulated by a 1995 UCLA
study that showed that heart transplant patients who received the
drugs were significantly less likely to reject the donor organs,
independent of the drugs' effects on the patients' cholesterol.
Statins are now used routinely in such patients to help reduce
rejection.</TE>
<TE>   A variety of animal and tissue culture experiments since have
shown that the drugs reduce inflammation in humans. Last month,
German and Austrian researchers reported that statins could alter the
activity of cultured immune cells taken from patients with MS,
changing the cells into a form that would no longer attack myelin.</TE>
<TE>   A team headed by UC San Francisco's Zamvil and immunologist Sawsan
Youssef of Stanford University studied mice with an experimentally
induced disease called EAE that closely resembles MS. They report in
today's issue of Nature that Lipitor -- also known by its generic
name atorvastatin -- significantly delayed progression when given in
the early stages of the disease. It also reversed paralysis when
given in later stages.</TE>
<TE>   "The animal data is quite striking," Zamvil said. "We have to be
cautious because it is an animal study, but it is really quite
exciting."</TE>
<TE>   Zamvil is seeking approval from the Food and Drug Administration
for a multi-center clinical trial that will enroll 126 patients who
have had an initial episode of MS. The one-year study will examine
whether an 80-milligram daily dose of Lipitor will prevent
progression to full-blown MS. That is the highest dose approved by
the FDA for lowering cholesterol. USC will be the L.A. center for the
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Another team already is conducting a trial in which 32 patients
with relapsing-remitting MS are being treated with simvastatin, which
is commonly known by the brand name Zocor.</TE>

<HD>San Francisco to Consider Growing Pot After Prop. S Passes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John M. Glionna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Officials here will name a panel to seriously consider entering the
pot-growing business now that voters have approved a measure
directing them to study whether this city should cultivate and sell
its own medical marijuana.</LD>
<LD>   In what officials called a first-step gesture of defiance against
the federal government's zero-tolerance marijuana policy, voters
passed Proposition S by a 2-1 ratio.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco Supervisor Mark Leno said officials will name a
three-member committee to "hold hearings and bring in professional
expertise," exploring legal and medical ramifications of the program.</LD>
<TE>   "We're breaking new ground here," Leno said. "Our mission is to
fulfill the will of the voters."</TE>
<TE>   The success of the controversial measure, which was not backed by
Mayor Willie Brown, has miffed federal officials, who have made
arrests at medicinal pot clubs in San Francisco and elsewhere in
California.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor of San Francisco has said publicly he doesn't think the
city should get into the pot-growing business, and we support him,"
said Richard Meyer, a spokesman for the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration in San Francisco. "It's an illegal substance."</TE>
<TE>   Brown spokesman P.J. Johnston said the mayor did not take a
position on Proposition S. Though a supporter of citizen access to
medical marijuana, Brown doesn't believe the measure moves in the
right direction. "It's a little too wacky, even for San Francisco,"
Johnston said.</TE>
<TE>   Other issues settled by California voters Tuesday ranged from the
substantive to the quirky.</TE>
<TE>   * In Oakland, a city recently racked by homicides, voters passed a
measure to hire 100 police officers but defeated a companion tax
measure that would have paid for them.</TE>
<TE>   Erica Herrold, a spokeswoman for Mayor Jerry Brown, called the
election outcome "bittersweet."</TE>
<TE>   In a city suffering from considerable budget deficits, "we really
don't know how we're going to pay for these officers," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "But Mayor Brown is committed to rolling up his sleeves and
finding a way to accomplish the voter mandate. We're going to have to
look at some creative financing."</TE>
<TE>   * In adjacent Berkeley, residents soundly rejected an initiative
that would have required that all coffee in city cafes be grown in an
environmentally friendly way and sold at a "fair trade" price as a
way to help struggling Third World growers. Opponents of Measure O,
which would have tripled the price paid to growers, defeated the
proposal by a 70% margin.</TE>
<TE>   * In San Francisco, voters also passed a measure to change the way
the city assists the homeless. Sponsored by Supervisor Gavin Newsom,
a mayoral hopeful, Proposition N slashes city welfare payments made
to about 3,000 people from $395 to just $59 a month, using the
savings to create more affordable housing and services.</TE>
<TE>   In a split decision on urban sprawl, California voters rejected
large development projects Tuesday, but balked at imposing new limits
on home building in cities around the state.</TE>
<TE>   Voters blocked construction of thousands of new dwellings in
Ventura and Alameda counties, but in a litmus test for just how far
activists could go, a second generation of growth controls failed in
Sonoma County, Berkeley and Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   And an environmental backlash measure in rural Nevada County,
which would have reimbursed property owners when local regulations
prevented full development of their land, also lost handily.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada County Supervisor Peter Van Zant said voters realized the
measure would have drained county coffers and set a dangerous
precedent.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, Superior Court Judge Bonnie Dumanis defeated Dist.
Atty. Paul Pfingst, a two-term incumbent. Pfingst's reelection bid
was hurt by a vote of no confidence from his deputies and controversy
over his handling of several high-profile cases.</TE>
<TE>   Although Dumanis is leading Pfingst by nearly 3,000 votes, 80,000
absentee ballots remain to be counted. But Pfingst all but conceded
the election in an e-mail to his staff.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Jenifer Ragland in Ventura, Tony Perry in San
Diego and special correspondent Emily Gurnon in Eureka contributed to
this report.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A police review board has ruled that two Burbank officers were
justified in shooting and wounding an armed parolee during a traffic
stop.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling issued Monday by a Burbank police shooting inquiry
board clears the officers in the Sept. 21 shooting of Carl Strunk,
22, of Burbank.</LD>
<LD>   Strunk is being held without bail pending arraignment Dec. 19 on
two counts each of attempted murder of a police officer, assault with
a deadly weapon and being a convicted felon in possession of a
firearm.</LD>
<TE>   Officers Chris Canales, 34, and Fernando Munoz, 30, had stopped a
car containing Strunk and three others when Strunk allegedly drew a
handgun and tried to shoot the officers. Canales and Munoz opened
fire, hitting Strunk several times. No one else was injured.</TE>
<TE>   Strunk had two handguns and fired one shot at the officers, police
said.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Nielsen's message of preserving the small-town character of San
Juan Capistrano got through to voters, who overwhelmingly rejected
two large development projects Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   But the messenger? He didn't quite make the same connection.
Nielsen, running for a two-year council seat on a slow-growth
platform, fell to businessman Joe Soto, 48.7% to 38.9%.</LD>
<LD>   The mixed election day message was similar in Newport Beach, where
voters adopted one of the state's toughest development laws two years
ago. But Tuesday, voters rejected three of the four candidates
running under the so-called Greenlight banner, including the author
of the slow-growth initiative.</LD>
<TE>   In Fullerton, council candidates who campaigned on a platform of
preserving 510 acres of the West Coyote Hills area were defeated in
the city election, even though the land is one of the city's last
pieces of undeveloped property.</TE>
<TE>   West Coyote Hills is set to be developed with 760 homes, an
elementary school and stores. Construction would be clustered around
pockets of coastal sage scrub, a habitat of the endangered California
gnatcatcher. The developer might be asked to create an endowment to
help build, maintain and operate a nature center on the site.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the way the voting went, the people feel that we will act
in their best interest," said Fullerton Councilman Don Bankhead, who
was reelected Tuesday. "But I don't feel that the candidates' defeat
is any indication that the community at large supports more housing
and development."</TE>
<TE>   Though San Juan Capistrano's Nielsen said he was disappointed that
voters didn't rally behind his council campaign, he was pleased that
they turned down an upscale housing development that included a new
high school and rejected the idea of selling city property to retail
giant Home Depot. The Whispering Hills/high school project was
defeated 56.6% to 43.4%. The Home Depot measure, which was an
advisory vote, was quashed 69% to 31%.</TE>
<TE>   "It proves the citizens place an extraordinarily high value on
retaining the character of our community," said Nielsen, a software
executive whose citizens group led the campaign against Whispering
Hills. "And spending hundreds of thousands of dollars [on campaign
ads] isn't going to change that."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Eggers, another preservationist who worked to defeat the
Whispering Hills project narrowly, also lost his bid to win a
four-year council seat. Incumbents Wyatt Hart, Diane Bathgate and
David M. Swerdlin were reelected. Eggers finished fourth, 126 votes
behind Swerdlin.</TE>
<TE>   San Juan Hills High School, which was scheduled to open in 2005,
would have been the town's first public high school in more than 40
years.</TE>
<TE>   Capistrano Unified Supt. James A. Fleming said the project will be
delayed indefinitely.</TE>

<LD>The drama definitely was elsewhere Tuesday as Orange County's
congressional and legislative incumbents won reelection by huge
margins.</LD>
<LD>   The only open seat -- to replace Assemblyman Bill Campbell
(R-Villa Park) -- became a slam dunk months ago, when no other
candidate chose to take on Supervisor Todd Spitzer for the Republican
nomination.</LD>
<LD>   Spitzer got 73% of the vote Tuesday in the GOP-dominant 71st
District. He'll be sworn in next month, setting up a February special
election to replace him on the board.</LD>
<TE>   Gratified by his 77% showing in Orange County, Spitzer
acknowledged that only about 60% of voters in Riverside County voted
for him. "There's a healthy skepticism about someone from Orange
County," he said of the county's eastern neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer will spend the rest of this week and next in Sacramento
for orientation meetings before he's sworn in next month. Campbell
has declared that he'll run for Spitzer's board seat. Other likely
candidates: Councilman Michael Alvarez of Orange and Tom Coad, policy
chief for his wife, Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Incumbents easily reelected to represent the county were Reps. Ed
Royce, Gary Miller, Dana Rohrabacher, Chris Cox and Ken Calvert, all
Republicans, and Democrat Loretta Sanchez. In the state Senate,
Democrat Joe Dunn and Republican Bill Morrow cruised to reelection.
Rejoining the county Assembly delegation were Republicans Tom Harman,
Ken Maddox, John Campbell, Lynn Daucher, Rod Pacheco and Pat Bates,
and Democrat Lou Correa.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The results were dismal for several comeback attempts around the
county by former elected officials.</TE>
<TE>   Ex-Anaheim Councilman Bob Zemel fell short in his attempt to win
back his seat. In Fountain Valley, former Orange County Supervisor
Roger R. Stanton also failed to become a member of that city's
council.</TE>
<TE>   Comeback attempts by former council members failed elsewhere in
Orange County. Joy Neugebauer lost in Westminster, Phil Schwartze
came up short in San Juan Capistrano and Mike Eggers was defeated in
San Clemente. Chuck Conlosh lost in Fountain Valley and Jack Mauller
was defeated in Buena Park.</TE>
<TE>   Having better luck were Melody Carruth, elected again to the
Laguna Hills City Council, and former Irvine Mayor Christina Shea,
who has a razor-thin lead for an Irvine council seat.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Several incumbent council members also were defeated Tuesday. They
were Steve Vargas in Brea, Harold Kaufman in Dana Point, Jan Flory in
Fullerton, Sherri Butterfield and Susan Withrow in Mission Viejo and
Scott Diehl in San Clemente. Expensive campaigns fueled by money from
interests outside Orange County emerged in the Dana Point and Mission
Viejo races.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lan Nguyen was about 800 votes short of becoming the first
minority representative on the Garden Grove Unified School District
board. He came in third in voting for two seats, which were won by
incumbents Bob Harden and Terry Cantrell.</TE>

<KH>ELECTION 2002</KH>
<HD>Low Turnout Is a Tacit Vote for Status Quo</HD>
<DH>Most incumbents retain their seats, though some newcomers
break through. Growth measures -- both for and against -- go down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With one of the lowest turnouts in Ventura County history, Tuesday's
election showed that residents are in no mood for dramatic change.</LD>
<LD>   Incumbents easily held on to their seats in the county's two
congressional and four Assembly races. In council races in nine
cities, current officeholders generally fared far better than their
challengers. And for nearly all the questions posed on the ballot,
from allowing development on Ventura's hillsides to imposing a $15
parcel tax for a swimming pool in Fillmore, the answer from voters
was thunderingly clear: No.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, though, new political figures upset the status
quo in several places. Members of a slate that billed itself as
"certified slow growth" candidates were among the big vote-getters in
Thousand Oaks, although ballots were still being counted in some
close races. And in Santa Paula, the most popular candidate was a
school administrator who never had run for office before.</LD>
<TE>   Preliminary results indicated that just 42.5% of the county's
registered voters had participated in the 2002 election, making the
turnout in Ventura the eighth-lowest in California's 58 counties.
Statewide, the turnout was 44.8%</TE>
<TE>   However, Bruce Bradley, the county's assistant registrar of
voters, said the final figures won't be as glaringly low.</TE>
<TE>   Some 30,000 absentee ballots that arrived at election headquarters
Monday and Tuesday have yet to be counted, he said. When they are
tallied by sometime next week, the county turnout probably will stand
at 49%.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers just weren't there, despite the issues," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Paradoxically, aggressive registration drives might contribute to
low turnout. "We have a lot of people on the roster who have never
been at a polling place," Bradley said.</TE>
<TE>   The negative overtones of the campaign for governor between Bill
Simon and Gov. Gray Davis may have turned off some prospective
voters, said Herb Gooch, a political analyst who teaches at Cal
Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "Negative campaigns depress the vote," Gooch said. "People just
say, 'Why bother?' "</TE>
<TE>   Gooch said low turnout also increases the power of organized
efforts to get out the vote for one side or another.</TE>
<TE>   In Thousand Oaks, Gooch said, the election reflected the
effectiveness of the slow-growth network organized by Linda Parks, a
former Thousand Oaks council member who is about to join the county
Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the last three elections, people associated with her
movement have brought in the same numbers," he said. "She has a
fairly reliable mechanism to get out the base vote, and she
delivers."</TE>
<TE>   Randy Hoffman, who lost his bid for a council seat, called the
vote in Thousand Oaks "a monument to low voter turnout."</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman urged his opponents from the slow-growth slate "to shift
from a mode of blind attack to one of responsible leadership.... For
the sake of all Thousand Oaks residents, I hope to be pleasantly
surprised," he said in a written statement.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Wilson, a restaurant owner and part of the four-member slate,
scored a substantial victory over Hoffman and will serve the last two
years of Parks' council term.</TE>
<TE>   In the battle for three other open seats, incumbent Andy Fox won
handily. Slate candidate Claudia Bill-de la Pena was in the No. 2
position, with council member Dennis Gillette lagging behind her by
just 65 votes and slow-growth candidate Michael Farris behind him by
only 95 votes. Elections officials said absentee ballots could be
crucial in determining the second- and third-place finishers, who
will fill the remaining two seats.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, two candidates in Ojai are sure only that they might be
somewhere close to taking office. In preliminary results, Bruce
Roland was just 10 votes behind Carol B. Smith in their quest for the
third open seat on the City Council. Incumbents Joe De Vito and David
Bury took the first two seats.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of cool," Roland said. "I left a message for Carol on
her machine ... that we're in for a wild couple of weeks."</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Paula, incumbent Rick Cook was among the three council
winners. But political novice Gabino Aguirre, a continuation high
school principal in Moorpark, led the voting and urban planner Mary
Ann Krause took second. The newcomers both opposed a measure that
would have allowed massive development in an outlying canyon and
doubled the city's area. The measure lost by a wide margin.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula voters also said no to a measure that would have
carved the town into five voting districts. The measure stemmed from
a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit charging that the city's
at-large voting system kept Latinos from being elected as council
members.</TE>
<TE>   Other local measures also went down. In Ojai, residents rejected
by a ratio of more than 2 to 1 a proposal to restrict development by
limiting the traffic it could generate. In Fillmore, the City Council
failed on its third try to resurrect the dilapidated Fillmore High
School pool by imposing a $15 tax on each property in town.</TE>
<TE>   In Oxnard, the county's most populous city, voters reelected Mayor
Manuel Lopez and Councilman Dean Maulhardt while tapping former
Councilman Andres Herrera to fill an open seat.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been gone long enough for them to see me as a new face, but
I also offered them the experience of an incumbent," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Incumbency played a poignant role in the race for the Oak Park
school board. Running for his fourth term, 73-year-old Bob Kahn died
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   He drew 562 votes, placing fifth in a field of six.</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana City Council Gains a Latino Majority</HD>
<DH>Mike Garcia's election means the makeup of the panel
finally reflects city populace.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Mena</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the election of Mike Garcia on Tuesday, Santa Ana's City Council
gained its first Latino majority -- two decades after the city's
population reached that milestone.</LD>
<LD>   Garcia handily beat five competitors in Ward 6 with 42.5% of the
vote.</LD>
<LD>   Garcia, a 31-year-old city-planning consultant, joins Mayor Miguel
Pulido, who ran unopposed, and incumbents Jose Solorio and Claudia
Alvarez to form the Latino majority on the seven-member council.</LD>
<TE>   Council members, however, downplay the significance of the moment.
And the four have varied political views, making it unlikely they
will vote as a bloc. But observers say the election demonstrates how
Latinos are gaining political power in a city that is now 76% Latino.</TE>
<TE>   "It serves as an example that Latinos can make a contribution,"
Garcia said. "At the same time, it's not something I've given a lot
of thought to."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Walker, chairman of Santa Ana Neighborhood Communication
Linkages, an umbrella group of 57 neighborhood groups in the city,
said the council's demographics should resemble the city's
population. "It's high time," he said. "I just hope we see that it
means the best for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Political observers point out that Garcia received endorsements
from individuals and groups that support the status quo, including
most incumbents and police and fire organizations. He also was able
to get support from janitors and labor unions that traditionally have
chosen more left-of-center candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "The results really validate that the city is going in the right
direction," Solorio said.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez said the Latino majority could encourage some residents
who have felt uncomfortable approaching the board. But more
important, the result shows that voters in conservative Orange County
have concluded "that we are not that scary," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Rosalind Gold, senior policy and research director at National
Assn. of Latino Election Officials, said most California cities with
Latino populations as big as Santa Ana's already have Latino
majorities on their councils. Santa Ana may lag behind because the
city has grown rapidly in recent years with immigrants from Mexico
and Central America who cannot yet vote, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's election illustrates "continuing empowerment," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Garcia received endorsements from many city
institutions, he is a political newcomer.</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Robert L. Henson, who placed second in the Ward 6 race
with 16% of the vote, contended during the campaign that Mayor Pulido
backed Garcia as a candidate who would follow his lead on the
council. Pulido did not return calls seeking comment, but Garcia
disputed the contention.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked hard to get a variety of supporters," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia works for Rosenow Spevacek Group, a Santa Ana-based
city-planning consulting company that has just signed a deal with the
city. Under the agreement, the group and two other companies will
take possession of three downtown buildings, provided each spends
about $500,000 in renovations.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia says his job has given him insights on how cities work and
what can help Santa Ana. Among his first tasks will be to forge
better relations with business associations.</TE>

<HD>The Battle's Far From Over for Santa Ana Trustee Palacio</HD>
<DH>The controversial school board president is counting on
using his big win to help defeat a recall effort targeting one of his
allies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Yi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Ana school board President John Palacio emerged from the dust
of a reelection election battle with a commanding victory over a
determined slate of challengers, but he was not about to let his
guard down.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday's election "was a referendum that the district is moving
in the right direction," said Palacio, who finished first in a field
of eight candidates seeking two seats. Palacio survived a campaign to
oust him and change the board's composition, garnering 23% of the
votes cast, according to preliminary results released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The 32-year-old consultant and former municipal employee vowed to
build on the momentum of his victory to defeat a recall effort
against fellow trustee and ally Nativo Lopez. A special recall
election is scheduled for Feb. 4.</LD>
<TE>   Opponents of Lopez and Palacio successfully ousted board majority
member Nadia Maria Davis, who came in fourth, with 14% of the votes.
But the two candidates backed by recall supporters and City Hall
leaders failed to win a seat on the five-member Santa Ana Unified
School District's governing board.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, former trustee Audrey Y. Noji regained a seat on the
board, coming in second with 17% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Challengers Lupe Moreno and Oscar Garza came in third and fifth,
respectively, despite being backed by Santa Ana Mayor Miguel A.
Pulido and businessman Ron Unz, the anti-bilingual education activist
who jumped into Santa Ana elections to help opponents of Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   The two challengers still held on to hope Wednesday while the
county registrar of voters counts about 65,000 absentee and
provisional votes countywide. Garza said he may consider putting his
name forward to replace Lopez should the recall succeed. Moreno said
she won't run in the recall. Candidates have until Nov. 21 to get
their names on the recall ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes in the continuing struggle for control of the
62,000-student district grew larger Tuesday with passage of
Proposition 47, the $13-billion statewide school bond measure that
could mean an additional $100 million or more for Santa Ana's school
projects.</TE>
<TE>   The pace of adding classrooms in the severely overcrowded school
district has been one of the most contentious issues in the current
political battle. In 1999, Santa Ana voters passed $145 million in
local bonds, but the district is only now moving on major projects.</TE>
<TE>   Palacio and Lopez say the district was hindered by the city's lack
of undeveloped land for new schools. They also say that City Hall and
Mayor Pulido stood in the way of at least one new elementary campus,
instead backing a luxury-home complex on the property in the city's
affluent north end. Pulido hasn't returned calls seeking comment on
school district issues.</TE>
<TE>   Recall supporters also say Lopez has illegally promoted bilingual
education in the mostly Latino district by encouraging parents to
seek waivers from English-only instruction. Lopez denies the charge.</TE>
<TE>   "The margin of John's victory is a repudiation of both Miguel
Pulido and Ron Unz and their attempt to wrest control of the school
district for property and ideological reasons," Lopez countered
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of continued political vitriol disheartened some in
the district.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a mess," said Kim Gerda, who has a daughter in elementary
school.</TE>
<TE>   "What I hope happens in the recall is that candidates emerge who
will look at ... children's needs."</TE>

<HD>Experts Say Scandal Did Not Play Big Role in Trustee Race</HD>
<DH>One incumbent is reelected and another loses, though both
opposed a settlement for the college district's controversial chief.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One Ventura County community college trustee was reelected and one
was ousted, a split decision that shows Ventura County voters were
less concerned about a financial scandal at the district than about
the best candidate overall, experts said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Trustees Art Hernandez and John Tallman voted earlier this year
against a $203,000 contract settlement for former Chancellor Philip
Westin, who resigned last month amid allegations he abused his
expense account. But their opposition to the costly buyout led to
decidedly different results at the polls.</LD>
<LD>   Voters in Oxnard, El Rio and Port Hueneme handed a victory to
Hernandez, who captured 50% of the vote in Area 5. His closest rival,
Sylvia Munoz-Schnopp, received 24%.</LD>
<TE>   Hernandez may have benefited in his nonpartisan race from a
vigorous Democratic campaign in Oxnard spearheaded by Rep. Lois Capps
(D-Santa Barbara), said Herb Gooch, a political analyst at Cal
Lutheran University.</TE>
<TE>   "Oxnard was worked heavily by the Capps campaign people and that
probably helped Hernandez," Gooch said.</TE>
<TE>   Tallman, a retired vice chancellor of the district and Westin's
biggest critic on the board, was defeated by Mary Anne Rooney, an
adult education teacher from Oxnard who ran a broad-based campaign
advocating reform. Rooney received 49% of the vote in Area 1, which
covers Ventura and a portion of Oxnard and Port Hueneme, to Tallman's
37%. Gooch said he thought Tallman may have been out-hustled by
Rooney's shoe-leather campaign.</TE>
<TE>   A third winner is Thousand Oaks resident Cheryl Heitmann, known
for her work as a fund-raiser for local nonprofit groups. Heitmann,
who will replace retiring trustee Norman Nagel, received 38% of the
vote to 23% for her closest rival, Sandy Patrizio.</TE>
<TE>   "I think voters responded to the fact that I have deep roots in
the community and have been an educational activist for 16 years and
care deeply about public education," Heitmann said.</TE>
<TE>   The three all ran campaigns that relied heavily on face-to-face
encounters with voters at farmers markets, coffee klatches and public
events.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they know I'm committed to the area," said Hernandez, a
former Oxnard Union High School District board member. "They were
comfortable knowing what I represented in the past and that I have
the best interests of the community in mind. It allowed them to say,
'We think we will continue to support him.' "</TE>
<TE>   Voters also may have been swayed by Hernandez's endorsements from
Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez and two former Oxnard College presidents,
Ed Robings and Steve Arvizu.</TE>
<TE>   Tallman could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   During the campaign, the candidates agreed the public's faith and
trust in the five-member board were seriously eroded after it was
revealed Westin had charged the district $119,000 over four years on
meals, car repairs and computers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think voters wanted some new leadership and people were
comfortable with me," Rooney said Wednesday. "I went out and met
people at the grass-roots level at meetings, functions and homes.
They saw I had passion about the district and that I would try to
find some common ground."</TE>
