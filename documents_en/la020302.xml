<HD>The Season for Playing Hard to Get</HD>
<DH>Television*  It's time to cast pilots, but determining
which actors are available can be a  challenge for all involved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like CEOs who don't fly coach, movie actors prefer not to do
television. This is a problem, particularly during pilot season, the
mad scramble for talent that marks the months of January through
April in the TV business, when casting for the fall's new dramas and
sitcoms takes on the urgency of a Barneys warehouse sale.</LD>
<LD>   To save on phone calls, the industry compiles lists.</LD>
<LD>   "We have this ritual where we go from agency to agency, and they
give us this extraordinary list of actors," said one studio
executive, who wanted to be anonymous lest he anger some of those on
the lists.</LD>
<TE>   Each actor's name, he said, is accompanied by an abbreviation:
Avail. means "available"; NA means "not available" but with wiggle
room (perhaps there's a scheduling conflict); NI means "not
interested"; and NI with an asterisk means "never interested."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in this pilot season, for instance, Paul Rudd was briefly
Avail., then he slipped to NA; a few weeks ago his agent was saying
Rudd was so NI he was no longer interested in "engaging [the
networks] in a series TV conversation."</TE>
<TE>   Who is Paul Rudd, and why is he so scared of television? Although
he may be unknown to most of the country, to TV creators and
executives, Rudd is a catch: a feature actor who is good looking, can
handle comedy and can pass for 25 to 35. A guy with prestige credits
(the movie "Clueless," the Neal Labute series of one-act plays,
"Bash."). And last but not least, a guy who (this can't be stressed
enough) isn't doing television.</TE>
<TE>   The TV business loves feature actors who aren't doing television.
The only actors the TV business loves more are the ones who won't
even discuss doing television.</TE>
<TE>   Despite gains the medium has made in recent years with acclaimed,
lavishly produced dramas like "The West Wing" and "The Practice" and
such sharp water-cooler comedies as "Friends" and "Sex and the City,"
television still carries its stigma of banality.</TE>
<TE>   The politics are ingrained. For feature actors fending off the
ruthless ageism of their business, doing television is like moving to
Florida: It's where you go to retire.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, actress Sally Field seemed to be running from this
perception as she stood on a soundstage at Raleigh Studios in
Hollywood to preview her new ABC drama, "The Court," for advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   Field, who plays a U.S. Supreme Court justice on the show, which
premieres later this month, wanted to make one thing clear: She'd had
no intention of returning to series television before "The Court"
came into her life.</TE>
<TE>   What Field didn't mention was that she'd been courting TV
producers as far back as 1997, when she entertained offers to do a
CBS sitcom.</TE>
<TE>   For younger actors, particularly those who like to take on
off-kilter roles in independent films, TV is perceived as a creative
comedown. It's as if doing TV ensures that someday James Lipton, the
thespian-friendly host of Bravo's "Inside the Actor's Studio," is
going to ask about that dramatic choice you made on a season finale
of "JAG."</TE>
<TE>   Still, from where executives sit, it doesn't hurt to ask. "What's
perplexing is that everyone knows that television makes stars, yet we
still chase after big names with huge offers because we believe that
will give a show an advantage," said Ted Harbert, president of NBC
Studios, which is producing more than a dozen pilots.</TE>
<TE>   And so, each pilot season involves the same game: burning through
a wish list of celebrity names, which are bandied about studio and
network offices as pilot scripts are read and orders made.</TE>
<TE>   According to a random survey of studio and network executives,
writers and casting agents, perennial targets include Matthew
Broderick, Michael Keaton, Alec Baldwin (as opposed to other
Baldwins), Kevin Kline, Marisa Tomei, Mary-Louise Parker, Dennis
Quaid, Janeane Garofalo and Bill Pullman.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for Baldwin, Rudd, Keaton and Tomei, to name four,
either did not respond or declined to be interviewed. Indeed, for
agents, pilot season can be precarious. Think of all that "Avail."
can symbolize, including a fading feature career or the free-fall of
an actor pushing 50 and tumbling down the celebrity food chain. One
studio executive noted that agents can be fired just for taking a TV
offer to a client.</TE>
<TE>   In the parlance of this game, the term "not doing television"
merits further dissection. Susan Sarandon and Michael Douglas don't
do television, but they have visited in that foreign
dignitary-at-the-White House sort of way, Sarandon guest-starring on
the Fox comedy "Malcolm in the Middle" and Douglas appearing on an
upcoming episode of NBC's "Will &amp; Grace."</TE>
<TE>   Other actors flirt more deeply. Just last year, Tomei read the
pilot for "Leap of Faith," a midseason NBC comedy about Manhattan
singles that premiered last week, and was interested enough to
convene a reading of the script with other actors. Then she passed on
the project.</TE>
<TE>   To understand the desperation with which the TV industry pursues
people like Baldwin, Tomei and Rudd, consider the daunting task that
pilot season presents: Over several months, studios, networks,
producers and casting executives have to find and agree upon leads,
second leads and third leads for close to 100 drama and comedy
pilots, a fraction of which will get ordered for the fall.</TE>
<TE>   With competition fierce, having a name actor in your project is
the easiest way to pre-sell a show to a network, advertisers and the
public. Thus, each pilot season entails casting familiar TV faces,
but not before checking the list of people who are either unwilling
to do television, unwilling to do television but willing to discuss
it or willing to both discuss and do television (this perhaps
unfairly leaves out actors willing to do television but unwilling to
discuss it).</TE>
<TE>   "Those names, when they're brought up in the beginning, it really
helps people focus on the type [producers are looking for]," said
Sharon Klein, senior vice president of casting at Fox. It's not so
much that they expect to get Alec Baldwin, she said, but "it helps
you get to the essence of the character."</TE>
<TE>   For what it's worth, Klein said that this year a run on quirky
comic actors has her searching for a "Paul Giamatti type," referring
to the co-star of the current release "Big Fat Liar."</TE>
<TE>   But "we need a Paul Giamatti type" is not the greatest way to
evolve a show, say critics, who would like to see the industry
embrace more original concepts. "If [networks and studios] would
emphasize the level of humor a little more and not be so obsessed
with casting sensibilities, they'd have better shows," said manager
Rick Messina, partner in Messina-Baker, whose clients include
comedian-actors Tim Allen, Drew Carey and Garofalo.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the problem with actors is they're cast in shows that are
not developed to their strengths. Who really knows what Matthew
Broderick's like? He's a charming, terrific actor with a great
innocence, but is that enough?"</TE>
<TE>   You don't have to be Broderick's agent (who declined comment) to
understand why the actor hasn't done a series yet. He's coming off a
lucrative turn in the Tony Award-winning Broadway smash "The
Producers," and on screen he's been able to string together a series
of finely drawn roles, most recently in "Election" and "You Can Count
on Me." Of course, before the current run there was also "Inspector
Gadget," and "Godzilla," but hey, at least he didn't do a sitcom.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Johnson, a producer who works in both features ("Bugsy,"
"What Lies Beneath") and television (CBS' "The Guardian"), said the
dilemma for many actors can be one of time and money.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is less 'Am I a TV actor?' [than] the five-year
commitment" to a successful series, said Johnson. "In a freelance
business, and in a business where people can easily get bored, five
years is a long time."</TE>
<TE>   For this reason, actors settling down with families--and reluctant
to be away for months at a time--are considered better bets. Vincent
D'Onofrio, for instance, took a role in the NBC drama "Law &amp; Order:
Criminal Intent" shortly after becoming a father.</TE>
<TE>   These days, you can almost predict when a star will show up on TV
by reviewing www.imdb.com, the Internet movie database that allows
you the opportunity to root around in an actor's career.</TE>
<TE>   Want to know the last time certain stars had top billing? Who
produced his or her last film? Whether or not the star has done a TV
movie? Check imbd.com, do the math and you just might determine how
soon the "Avail." sign will go up.</TE>

<HD>Last Stand for 'Once and Again'?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Much to the disappointment of an intensely loyal audience whose
numbers fall into the "not quite big enough" category for ABC, "Once
and Again" faces an almost certain shutdown following a brief
resurrection scheduled for this month.</LD>
<LD>   The drama, which stars Sela Ward and Billy Campbell and premiered
in 1999, was pulled in January, prompting viewers to dash off e-mails
to network executives and the show's producers, Ed Zwick and Marshall
Herskovitz. The series, which has bounced around ABC's schedule,
returns Monday for what many presume will be its last flight of
episodes.</LD>
<LD>   For fans, the drama provided an honest look at the demands placed
on families in the wake of divorce and conflicts that arise as adults
seek to find love again.</LD>
<TE>   ABC has yet to make any final determination about the show's
future (the network will officially set next fall's schedule in May).
But with the network having already reduced the number of episodes
ordered, the producers acknowledge the program's prospects for a
fourth season appear bleak.</TE>
<TE>   "Never say never," Herskovitz said. "But I think the greatest
possibility is that the show will end when we go off the air in the
spring."</TE>
<TE>   Herskovitz added that the criteria of what qualifies as a success,
given the shrinking audience for network television, have blurred.</TE>
<TE>   "A big hit today has 18% of the [available] viewing audience
watching. A failure has 8% watching. That's absurd," Herskovitz said.</TE>
<TE>   "Once and Again" broke ground in a number of ways, not the least
of which was to place Ward front and center as a sexy 40-something
woman in a TV landscape overrun by midriff-wearing 20-somethings. The
actress won an Emmy for her role as Lily Manning in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The show also continues to deal with challenging dramatic issues.
The March 11 episode, for example, will feature a lesbian theme with
two teenage girls kissing.</TE>
<TE>   So what, if anything, have Zwick and Herskovitz learned from their
most recent experience trying to make a quality drama? Not much,
Herskovitz said, maintaining that "Once and Again" is just as good as
"thirtysomething," the series he and Zwick produced in the 1980s,
exploring the same sort of universal and contemporary themes.</TE>
<TE>   "Our idea of 'targeting' was to say, 'Ooh, there are a lot of
divorced people in the country, maybe a lot of people will watch,'"
Herskovitz said.</TE>
<TE>   "Once and Again" returns Monday night at 10 on ABC. The network
has rated that episode TV-PG-V (may be unsuitable for young children,
with a special advisory for violence).</TE>

<HD>Jigs, Reels and Bob Dylan Too</HD>
<DH>Pop Music: The Irish American band Solas broadens its
traditional approach with more contemporary repertoire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD HARRINGTON</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Wall Street Journal once called the superb Irish American
ensemble Solas "spirited and refreshingly risk-taking," but it's
unlikely many Wall Street analysts would encourage the kind of
dramatic change evident on their new album, "Edge of Silence."</LD>
<LD>   After all, when you're an internationally acclaimed supergroup
known for championing a traditional Irish repertoire fired by jigs
and reels and graced by aching ballads, it might appear risky to
suddenly start interpreting tunes by Tom Waits, Bob Dylan, Jesse
Colin Young and Nick Drake, not to mention adding electric guitar and
drum loops to the mix.</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, hearing Solas' brooding "Georgia Lee," you'd
think it was an ancient murder ballad, which could go a long way to
ameliorating relations with fans of Irish music, including the
genre's hard-core traditionalists.</LD>
<TE>   "Without question, it was something we gave thought to," says
Seamus Egan, Solas' founder and multi-instrument virtuoso (flute, tin
whistle, mandolin, banjo, guitar, bodhran and percussion). "For fans
who've enjoyed the more traditional elements on our previous albums,
I think on first listen, this record might seem quite different.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt we wanted, and needed, to make this step, but we didn't
want to completely abandon where we come from," Egan adds. "I think
that as much as possible we tried to keep intact the bits of Solas
that have allowed us to be what we have been in the past and
hopefully broaden that out a little bit and retain that feel."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, old-line Solas fans will thrill to lively instrumentals
like "Legless" and "Charmy Chaplin."</TE>
<TE>   "When people hear Irish music, they think it's stomping their foot
to a jig or hearing the plaintive ballad," Egan says. "The thing is,
it doesn't have to be just that. There's a way that you approach
music as a traditional Irish musician that can be placed on more
contemporary material."</TE>
<TE>   Solas reconfigures the seldom-heard Dylan song "Dignity," Young's
"Darkness, Darkness" (in a manner reminiscent of Fairport Convention)
and Nick Drake's "Clothes of Sand" (featuring the decidedly Drake-ish
lead vocal debut of button accordionist Mick McAuley). They also
offer two haunting ballads by Philadelphia neighbor Antje Duvekot.</TE>
<TE>   As Egan points out, Solas has gradually introduced new elements
into its albums, such as percussionist Steve Holloway and bassist
Chico Huff, who appeared on 1998's "Words That Remain," and soon
after started touring with the band.</TE>
<TE>   "We actually wanted to bring bass and drums out for the live shows
much sooner than we did," Egan says. "We were a bit apprehensive what
the reaction would be.... We knew that we felt better playing with
them--it allowed us to open up the arrangements and audience reaction
seemed to be appreciative, though I'm sure there were some grumblings
here and there."</TE>
<TE>   Now, he says, the surprise of seeing bass and drums on stage won't
be an issue. "One of the new additions on this tour is the electric
guitar--it's the first time we've had it on record, too."</TE>
<TE>   This tour, Solas may finally do a concert version of its greatest
hit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the only one," Egan chortles, referring to "I Will Remember
You," from the soundtrack to the 1995 film "The Brothers McMullen."
Sarah McLachlan's version eventually went Top 10 and earned her a
Grammy.</TE>
<TE>   "Folks have been onto us about playing it but it just never felt
like it had a comfortable spot in our show. But with the broader
approach to material on this record, now it fits."</TE>

<DH>One day after her Grammy triumph, a determined  Alicia Keys
gets back to business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You'd think you'd be able to find Alicia Keys' dressing room at the
Wiltern Theatre on the night after the Grammys just by listening for
all the party noise. If there were ever a reason to celebrate, it's
after winning five Grammys, tying Lauryn Hill's 1999 record for the
most ever by a female artist in a single year.</LD>
<LD>   But the long hallway leading to the dressing room was quiet before
her sold-out concert Thursday. Inside the room, Keys was preparing
for the show, seemingly the same way she does any other night on a
tour that has been going almost nonstop since last summer.</LD>
<LD>   The only references to Wednesday's Grammys were the headlines on a
stack of newspapers from around the country. The singer-songwriter's
mother, Terri Augello, picked them up at a local newsstand so she
could check out the Grammy coverage.</LD>
<TE>   Augello didn't have to look far, because her daughter's picture
was on the front page of most of them. Her five victories, including
best new artist and song of the year for "Fallin'," upstaged even
veteran rockers U2 and the massive "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
soundtrack cast.</TE>
<TE>   The low-key scene is typical, say members of Keys' touring family,
because the 21-year-old New Yorker is focused on music, not the
accompanying glitter of the pop world. She stopped by the party
hosted by her record company, BMG, for about 30 minutes after the
Grammy ceremony, then headed to her hotel to get some rest.</TE>
<TE>   Keys has been so busy touring and doing promotional chores since
her debut album, "Songs in A Minor," was released last summer that
she has had only about three weeks off. But the young artist, who
appears to be as disciplined and dedicated as she is gifted, used
most of that time to work on new ideas in the recording studio.</TE>
<TE>   "All the success has been wonderful, but I don't want to get
distracted from the music," Keys said in her dressing room. "One
thing that helps me is I have a close group around me.... My mom, my
musical partners, my manager.... If I didn't have them, I'd probably
be a mess because things have been happening fast."</TE>
<TE>   After playing some shows in Europe this month, Keys will begin
work on a new album in April, but her label, Clive Davis' J Records,
isn't finished pushing singles from "Minor."</TE>
<TE>   One of the collection's most dynamic tracks, a funky remake of
Prince's "Why Don't U Call Me Anymore," is expected to be released
shortly in this country, while "Girlfriend," a lighter R&amp;B exercise,
will be the next single in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   But that's probably going to be  the label's last push for the
album, which has sold 8 million copies worldwide and been in the U.S.
top 20 since its release. Keys doesn't want to overexpose herself on
the radio or appear to be milking the  recording. She's already
looking forward to her new music.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just at the beginning [of my career] and there are going to
be a lot of expectations next time, but that doesn't bother me," she
said. "I've got a million things I want to try on the album."</TE>
<TE>   Though Keys didn't preview any new songs during her almost
two-hour set, she and her 10-piece band, which included a turntablist
and a three-piece horn section, did offer lots of new ideas in their
treatment of the old songs.</TE>
<TE>   The question with all young performers is the depth of their
vision. You can have a great voice, captivating stage presence and
even some disarming tunes, but it doesn't mean a lot if you don't
have a strong sense of artistic imagination and drive.</TE>
<TE>   From the opening moments of her showcase at the Roxy last May,
Keys was a striking force, someone whose voice, songwriting, piano
playing and stage command all caught your attention.</TE>
<TE>   Best of all, she mixed contemporary hip-hop textures with soul
music tradition in ways that seemed intriguing. Still, you couldn't
fully tell where she wanted to go musically.</TE>
<TE>   In the album, she moved in sometimes conflicting directions--from
the youthful, top 40 pop attitude of "Girlfriend" to the funky
sensuality of the Prince tune to the neo-soul urgency of "Fallin'."</TE>
<TE>   The worry was that Keys could have no true musical compass, that
she would simply move back and forth between musical textures--or
that success with any one of them would make her concentrate on that
style.</TE>
<TE>   The revelation at Thursday's concert (the first of two nights at
the Wiltern) was that Keys appears to be well on her way to
developing that personal vision. Whether introducing her version of
Sting's "Fragile" or reworking her own songs, she exhibited a
dimension and depth that carried the stamp of a serious, rapidly
maturing artist.</TE>
<TE>   She and the musicians (including three backup singers) have
reworked the album tunes, extending them with edgier and more
passionate fibers. On record, "Rock Wit U" seemed annoyingly generic,
but she and the band have turned it into a liberating workout. And
her already striking rendition of the Prince song has become an even
rowdier exercise.</TE>
<TE>   Another sign of Keys' confidence and ambition is the way she has
even redesigned "Fallin'," adding all sorts of dramatic punctuation
rather than sticking with the more streamlined hit version.</TE>
<TE>   In the show's staging and in her manner, Keys also revealed a
strong sense of theatrical flair, engaging in some "sisterly" talk
with the audience and saluting her hip-hop street roots by performing
in front of a tenement backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   It's always risky trying to predict which new artists have the
talent and drive to be around for the long run, and the Grammy voters
have often been burned. Remember the Starland Vocal Band? A Taste of
Honey? Milli Vanilli? In Keys, however, it looks as if the voters can
all take a deep breath. The best may be yet to come.</TE>

<HD>Wincing at the Future in 'Jeremiah'</HD>

<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's the premise for the new Showtime series, "Jeremiah":</LD>
<LD>   It's been 15 years since a mysterious, devastating plague known as
the Big Death hit Earth, killing billions while sparing only those
under the age of puberty to make their way on a bleak, lawless planet
that is now a desolate scrap heap. No food to speak of, no
electricity, no security, no fun, no Britney Spears. Pretty grim,
huh?</LD>
<LD>   If you think this virus is deadly, though, try watching the
two-hour premiere.</LD>
<TE>   Based on a comic series by Belgian Hermann Huppen and created by
J. Michael Straczynski, "Jeremiah" has Luke Perry as a beacon of
humanity in a futuristic society gone darkly over the edge, and
Malcolm-Jamal Warner as his amiable pal, Kurdy. Jeremiah is a tough,
courageous, independent, visionary loner who keeps alive memories of
his dead father, in contrast to the less idealistic, less intense
Kurdy.</TE>
<TE>   Prior to relocating to their regular Friday night time slot,
Jeremiah and Purdy on Sunday clash with the notorious Theo (Kim
Hawthorne), a bossy gangbanger who, despite being scrawny, somehow
imposes her will through terror.</TE>
<TE>   Why do all these big, ugly thugs tremble at the sight of her?
Because she is demonically, mercilessly, brutally, sadistically ...
sexy. You'll wince and hide your eyes when she has some guy tied up,
stands in front of him in her micro-mini and snarls while lecturing
him on what it's like for a girl to reach puberty and have no one to,
you know, have some fun with. Talk about torture.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Jeremiah and Kurdy encounter a group of neo-Nazi skinheads
who plan to kill "racial inferiors," then link up with an enlightened
society living in an oasis of luxury while everyone on the outside
suffers.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the regular series will improve. "Jeremiah" begins,
however, as a slow-moving, ungainly morality tale encumbered by bad
acting and a lead in Perry who is un-magnetic and unpersuasive.</TE>
<TE>   All of it adds up to a long night that feels like the Big Death.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Jeremiah" premieres Sunday night at 8 on Showtime and will seen
regularly on Friday nights. The network has rated it TV-14 (may be
unsuitable for children under 14).</TE>

said 'I love you' to a man just to get that man to have sex with
them. The other 87% said 'I love you' to a man just to get rid of the
guy." (Jay Leno)</LD>
<LD>   Keeping Score: "Enron's former CEO, Kenneth Lay, recently sold his
interest in the Houston Texans, who begin play in the NFL next fall.
He would have been a great owner. Even when the team was trailing by
40 points, the scoreboard would show them leading by 10." (Argus
Hamilton)</LD>

blame our problems on besides Enron." (Ira Lawson)</LD>

<HD>Grammy for 'O Brother' a Worthy Surprise</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding Robert Hilburn's Grammy analysis ("It's Time to Nominate a
New System," A13, Feb. 28): To claim that the "O Brother, Where Art
Thou?" soundtrack is somehow less deserving as best album than U2's
or Bob Dylan's latest discs because of the way the Grammy voting
process works is simply missing the point. The Grammys on the whole
are just self-congratulatory kisses from the major-label industry to
itself, and the fact that any deserving albums are nominated, let
alone victorious, is always a pleasant and unexpected surprise.</LD>
<LD>   NICK BISCHOFF</LD>

<TE>   Thank goodness for the "O Brother" win. Popular music is in
trouble these days, and we need to get back to our roots in order to
change things. If it weren't for the Stanley Brothers and Bill
Monroe, these sorry, untalented, snotty pop "performers" would never
have been able to get a chance to ruin music in the first place. I
for one am all [for] exposing the musical inadequacies of Britney and
'N Sync (and hip-hop for that matter). I hope they enjoy the ride,
because in 50 or 60 years, no one will remember who they were and
they certainly won't win a Grammy.</TE>
<TE>   JOHN MIDDLETON</TE>
<TE>   Florida</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" was the most distinguished album of
the year because it got the most votes: not critics votes, not the
public's votes, not politicians' votes, but musicians'
votes--commonly referred to as peers. Robert Hilburn seems to be
confused about this as he cites the "500 U.S. pop music critics'"
opinions. They can give their own awards and he can cast his vote in
that contest and participate in determining how the voting should be
conducted.</TE>

<TE>   Of the Grammy-winning CDs that I own, I was initially exposed to
none of them on Los Angeles airwaves. This illustrates the sad state
of music radio since the federal government, via the FCC, allowed
large corporations to own most of the stations, eliminating
creativity in favor of the bottom line. No longer are there small or
medium owners in the business for the love of the music. Relevant
music radio is over.</TE>

<TE>   How could they cut short the Grammy winners' speeches when Ray
Romano was given endless time with his painful-to-watch sketch? They
are so insulting to the audience's intelligence. Well, I hope
everyone associated with the Grammys, especially the producers, get a
clue! And I think the public should be told if Romano actually took a
gift basket home since, as he said, he's already been blessed with so
much.</TE>

<LD>I found Jan Breslauer's review of "Lobby Hero," Kenneth Lonergan's
play at South Coast Rep, to be blatantly reactive to the success the
author has recently been enjoying ("A Less Than Heroic Effort, on All
Fronts," F1, Feb. 25). This is a bizarre attitude to bring into the
theater, and I cannot help but feel that Breslauer's mind was made up
before the curtain went up. What's more, she felt the need not only
to attack the production she was watching but also Lonergan's
previous work, stating that "This Is Our Youth" was nothing more than
hip cynicism and that those who enjoyed it were "limousine liberals,"
a phrase which I suppose means artsy bourgeois? Or, more simply put,
a class of theatergoer she considers herself better than, whoever
they are. Breslauer is doggedly closed off to what makes theater
wonderful: rhythms of speech, subtle surprises of character, loving
details and the risks of sudden earnestness that lie hidden in a
cynical landscape. She is not doing any of us any favors by sharing
her heroic, anti-hip judgments.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding Kenneth Turan's review of "We Were Soldiers" ("Battle Saga
at War With Itself," F1, Feb. 28): The logic displayed in his review
is flawed at best, and displays a fundamental lack of knowledge of
war and its participants that is common among those who have never
experienced the hell of combat. Turan says the movie: " ... deftly
sidesteps the messy question of why we were in Vietnam in the first
place in favor of giving deserving soldiers the old-fashioned heroic
warrior treatment." He misses the point of a film titled "We Were
Soldiers." As a Vietnam veteran, wounded in action at age 19 during a
furious firefight in the 1968 Tet offensive near Khe Sanh, I can tell
you with no doubt that the typical ground soldier (grunt) in any war
does not really know or care about the politics that brought about
the war or the political decisions that put him there. All you know
is the sheer terror of you and your buddies facing off against
another armed group of young boys who probably don't know why they
are there either.</LD>
<TE>   Just because Vietnam came to be an "incorrect" war, do you think
the dying soldiers that fought there did not, or had no right to, cry
for their mothers, say good-bye to wives or be proud to die for their
country? There have been many movies about the whys and how-comes
concerning our role in Vietnam. These films tend to cast the soldier
into the role of an abstract extra or sideman, the pawn of those
politicians. This film is not titled "Why We Were Soldiers," so it
should portray the reality of a soldier's life.</TE>

<HD>Image Awards: Fame Is the Benchmark</HD>
<DH>Commentary: Instead of honoring the best work of African
Americans in film and TV, these honors from the NAACP tend to
celebrate familiar faces.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANICE RHOSHALLE LITTLEJOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Somebody ought to boycott the NAACP.</LD>
<LD>   It's bad enough that the organization screams and shouts that
Hollywood isn't employing African Americans in film and
television--going so far as to threaten boycotts against the
broadcast networks. But when they have an opportunity to honor those
who are working--as they purport to do with their annual Image
Awards, which were handed out last week and broadcast Friday on
Fox--the NAACP fails to honor the very best.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of recognizing works based on their quality, the Image
Awards is a popularity contest to celebrate familiar faces. The
problem begins with the submission process, which even some of those
working on shows find to be flawed. What it amounts to is that any
Tom, Dick or Jane with $100 can submit any artist for a nomination,
just as long as the nominee has released something in film,
television, music or literature between Jan. 1 and Dec. 31. Those
with the most submissions get on the ballot.</LD>
<TE>   The votes are then cast by subscribers to the NAACP's Crisis
magazine, the readership of which, I am told by NAACP members, is
primarily older women. That might explain why Della Reese has
consistently won for best actress in a drama series for "Touched by
an Angel" since 1994, despite the fact that this year's nominees
Nicole Ari Parker ("Soul Food") and Lorraine Toussaint ("Any Day
Now") delivered some of the strongest dramatic performances on TV
last year by an actress of any race.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Harvey is also a popular repeat winner. Both the star and
his series, the recently ended "The Steve Harvey Show," beat Bernie
Mac and his critically lauded Fox series, "The Bernie Mac Show,"
which, by most accounts, is the hottest comedy on television.</TE>
<TE>   It's one of those things that made me go, "Hmm," until I had a
chat with Clayola Brown, Image Awards vice chairman, at a pre-awards
gala. She went on and on about what a wonderful supporter Harvey is
of the NAACP and how much they love the guy. Ah, I see now. He's the
favorite son.</TE>
<TE>   But I still find myself scratching my head about Isaac Hayes, who
three years ago was nominated as best supporting actor in a comedy
series for his voice-over as Chef in Comedy Central's irreverent
cartoon "South Park."</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that he was competing against live-action actors, but
here's a one-dimensional character, whose sole motivation in any
given episode is to feed little white children during the day and get
women in the sack at night. Aren't these the kinds of buffoonish
images of African Americans that the NAACP ridiculed the networks for
in "Beulah" and "Amos N' Andy" in the 1940s?</TE>
<TE>   Certainly one can applaud Denzel Washington's deserving best actor
win for "Training Day," for which he's also an Oscar nominee. (Had he
lost to "Baby Boy's" singer-turned-actor Tyrese, any sane person in
Hollywood would have grabbed a picket sign.)</TE>
<TE>   Halle Berry received a best actress Image Award for her
less-than-impressive role in "Swordfish," which essentially was more
a supporting part than the lead. Then again, every actress listed in
that category has supporting parts, with the exception of Vivica A.
Fox for "Two Can Play That Game." Berry, however, also gave a
noteworthy, Oscar-nominated lead performance in "Monster's Ball."
Guess the Crisis voters missed the screening.</TE>
<TE>   I'll confess, I've been suspect of these awards for a long time,
going back to the day when teenage WB stars Tia and Tamera Mowry were
nominated, and won, for best actress in a comedy series. Yes, they're
twins, and they play twins on TV. But they're also two individual
people and should be nominated and awarded individually.</TE>
<TE>   It also doesn't help matters much when true actors are
overshadowed by high-profile personalities. Last year, for example,
Rosa Parks won best supporting actress in a drama for her guest
appearance on, you guessed it, "Touched by an Angel."</TE>
<TE>   The NAACP should honor Parks, and has honored this civil rights
legend, for her activism. But to award her outstanding supporting
actress? Give me a break.</TE>
<TE>   This year's Parks was Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds. An actor he is
not, even by his own account, but the singer-producer still managed
to make the ballot for best supporting actor because of a guest
appearance on "Soul Food," which he produces with his wife, Tracey
Edmonds.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, like the Golden Globes (and unlike the Emmys),
one-time-only TV performers are lumped into the same category with
series regulars, which, in this case, means the nomination could have
gone to "Soul Food's" Darrin Dewitt Henson or Rockmond Dunbar, "Third
Watch's" Coby Bell or any African American actor on "Oz." These are
talented performers who toil and sweat on series, week in and week
out.</TE>
<TE>   Such oversights rankle some within the industry. Even "Soul Food"
producer Felicia Henderson, whose show was just honored for best
drama series, complained last year about losing to the NAACP's
diversity poster drama, CBS' "City of Angels," a program that drew
mostly negative reviews and was off the air by the time of the awards
ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   More than a few industry folks that I've spoken with over the last
few weeks have complained that the awards are hopelessly flawed and
should be reexamined. For starters, just opening the submission
process to more people working within the entertainment industry
would at least provide a better, more diverse list of personalities
to be recognized.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, as an African American, I think it's great to have an awards
show that honors the achievements of African American talent. It
would be truly great, though, if the NAACP worked harder to recognize
them. If they don't, I'll be working on my sign for next year.</TE>

<HD>A Taste for Partying Over Politics</HD>
<DH>Busta Rhymes leads a rap-act triple bill at the Universal
Amphitheatre that's long on raucous, feel-good attitude but short on
substance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC WEINGARTEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone who attended the rap triple bill at the Universal Amphitheater
on Thursday looking for a complex worldview or an evolved take on the
usual hip-hop tropes would have been sorely disappointed.</LD>
<LD>   Bubba Sparxxx, Ludacris and headliner Busta Rhymes all belong to
hip-hop's good-times contingent, rejecting gangsta rap's sloganeering
and the radical politics of critically lauded new acts such as the
Coup in favor of raucous and frequently lewd celebrations of
self-satisfaction.</LD>
<LD>   Opening act Sparxxx, a protege of producer Timbaland, has
attempted to carve his own niche as a good ol' boy with a rifle rack
in his pickup and an occasionally piquant drawl in his delivery.
Appearing onstage in a suede warmup suit--the de rigueur hip-hop
wardrobe--the Georgian was a strident defender of debauchery in such
songs as "Betty Betty" and "Ugly" and provided visual aid by
frequently grabbing his crotch, just in case anyone couldn't parse
the lyrical nuances. Sparxxx worked hard to get the crowd amped, but
only his amusing redneck reprobate anthem "Bubba Talk" got a big
rise.</LD>
<TE>   Summoning crowd enthusiasm was not an issue for Ludacris, the
Atlanta rapper whose frame of reference doesn't extend much beyond
the windshield of his Mercedes. He's a chronicler of the urban
prosaic, his raps the hip-hop equivalent of observational stand-up
comedy.</TE>
<TE>   Most of his songs were prefaced by "did you ever notice?"-style
introductions, and the songs themselves stood up for prolific
lovemaking, decried slowpoke drivers and dissed duplicitous women. A
competent if uninteresting rapper, Ludacris elicited mass hand-waving
eruptions with his nasty-goofy material.</TE>
<TE>   Given the company he was sharing the stage with, Busta Rhymes came
off like a deep thinker during his hourlong closing set. One of a
handful of hip-hop performers who has endured for more than a decade,
Rhymes has cleared a space all to himself as a silver-tongued
vaudevillian with astonishing technique and bluster to spare. His
current album, "Genesis," seems to be a move toward a more
reflective, if somewhat confused, songwriting approach, but the inner
prankster is not that easily suppressed.</TE>
<TE>   Starting his set with a few tracks from the record, which seems to
be some kind of live-free-and-multiply manifesto, Rhymes charged
through his long string of hits, which are among the most
entertaining in contemporary hip-hop. With their knotty verbal
feints, fractured beats and general air of purposeful frivolity,
songs such as "Whoo-Hah (Got You All in Check)" and "Put Your Hands
Where My Eyes Can See" are tailor-made for big-arena chant-alongs.</TE>
<TE>   And nothing gets a hip-hop crowd in a frenzy quite like an A-list
cameo: P. Diddy and the Neptunes' Pharrell Williams bounded out
during Rhymes' latest single, "Pass the Courvoisier," keeping the
evening's party-hearty theme close to the surface.</TE>

<LD>   Leno Joke Has NBC In Damage Control</LD>
<LD>   Fresh on the heels of its Olympics ratings triumph, NBC is
engaging in some damage control--defending the "irreverent comedy" of
"Tonight Show" host Jay Leno, who incurred the wrath of South Korean
officials with a joke in a recent monologue.</LD>
<TE>   South Korean short-track skater Kim Dong Sung, the comedian
quipped, "was so mad over being disqualified that he went home and
kicked the dog, and then ate him"--a reference to the often-ridiculed
Korean practice of eating dog meat. Former Prime Minister Kim Jong
Pil called Leno "ill-mannered" and said, "We should not let a man,
one without common sense, host a TV program." He vowed to send a
letter of protest to NBC.</TE>
<TE>   As of Thursday, there was no sign of the letter at the
network--which explained, in its statement, that "by its nature,
comedy can be impolite, and the humor on 'The Tonight Show' is no
exception."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Decline in African American Faces</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in five years, no black reporter was among the
top 25 on the network evening news programs in 2001, as measured by
the number of stories they reported.</TE>
<TE>   According to a study released Thursday by the Center for Media and
Public Affairs, Byron Pitts of CBS and Pierre Thomas of ABC were tied
for 28th place, with 72 appearances on their news programs. Only one
other black reporter, Randall Pinkston of CBS, was in the top 50, the
center said. A year earlier, two black reporters made the top 10.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the study found that the number of stories reported by
all minorities and women was up slightly over 2000. Eighty-eight
percent of the stories were reported by whites and 75% by men, the
report said.</TE>
<TE>   The most visible network news reporter last year was John Roberts
on CBS, who reported 177 stories. Robert Hager was the leader at NBC
with 159 stories, followed by Terry Moran's 138 stories on ABC.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Survivor' Premiere Topped by 'Friends'</TE>
<TE>   "Survivor: Marquesas," CBS' fourth edition of the unscripted
series franchise, premiered Thursday to an estimated 23.2 million
viewers, slightly below the debut for the third installment in
October.</TE>
<TE>   The program lost to "Friends" (27.5 million viewers) in its first
half-hour, but beat the premiere of NBC's heavily promoted new 8:30
p.m. show, "Leap of Faith," which, at 20.8 million viewers, fell a
respectable 25% off its "Friends" lead-in audience.</TE>
<TE>   The big story of the night, actually, may have been CBS' "CSI:
Crime Scene Investigation," which rose to a record 28.8 million
viewers following "Survivor," dominating NBC's comedies in its time
slot and drawing a bigger audience than "ER" did at 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   CBS will repeat the first episode of "Survivor" this Wednesday.</TE>

<TE>   Security Questioned in Limp Bizkit Fan Death</TE>
<TE>   Limp Bizkit's tour manager testified Friday that a Sydney concert
where a teenage girl was killed was understaffed and poorly managed.
Safety, he said, was compromised in an effort to cut costs.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander Murdoch MacLeod, the first associate of the band to
appear at the Sydney inquest into the death of 15-year-old Jessica
Michalik, said that security guards and medical personnel were poorly
trained--and insufficient for the number of people in the mosh pit.
He said he expressed his concerns to concert organizers that day--and
a week before the performance.</TE>
<TE>   "My state of mind prior to them starting the performance was one
of fear," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Michalik was caught in a crowd crush and suffered a heart attack
at the concert on Jan. 26, 2001. She died five days later. Six other
people were hospitalized after the multi-band event, called the Big
Day Out, which drew a crowd of 65,000. Limp Bizkit pulled out of its
Australian tour afterward and criticized concert organizers for
providing inadequate security and safety measures, a claim organizers
denied.</TE>
<TE>   The case, in which two band members will give evidence, was
adjourned until June 6.</TE>

<TE>   Elvis to Appear</TE>
<TE>   On Some Quarters</TE>
<TE>   The King of Rock 'n' Roll will soon resurface--and in mint
condition, it seems.</TE>
<TE>   Elvis Presley Enterprises has licensed a company to have him
replace George Washington on some of Tennessee's 2002
quarters--souvenirs honoring the singer on the 25th anniversary of
his death.</TE>
<TE>   The coins, in which a color portrait of Elvis is fused over the
face of the nation's first president, went into production this month
through the International Collectors Society.</TE>
<TE>   Though the British colony of Gibraltar mints Elvis coins as part
of its currency, the refaced quarter is the only option in U.S.
currency, according to Pete Davidson, senior licensing manager for
Presley Enterprises.</TE>
<TE>   Defacing U.S. currency is a misdemeanor crime, said Secret Service
agent Tim Viertel. Still, the Elvis quarters are in a gray area
because they are not part of a deceptive scheme. "I don't know of a
U.S. Attorney's office around who would prosecute it," Viertel said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a developer has indicated interest in building a
$500-million Elvis-themed resort, "Elvis Presley Ranch," on the spot
in Memphis where the King and Priscilla Presley spent their
honeymoon, USA Today reports. The singer sold the land, then known as
the Circle G Ranch, in 1974 when the marriage fell apart.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   S.F. Museum Design Is Under Criticism</TE>
<TE>   Comparing the design of the proposed new $185-million M.H. de
Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park to a
"1960's motel in Las Vegas," a citizens group has filed a suit to
block construction on the project, according to the San Francisco
Chronicle.</TE>
<TE>   The venue, badly damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, was
finally closed to the public a year ago. Plans call for the
demolition of the old museum and the opening of a new structure in
2005. For seven years, the project has been shrouded in
controversy--the subject of City Hall hearings and previous legal
action.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, said the
design--a sleek glass-faced affair with a 144-foot tower--was too
bold and not "park-friendly." People for a New de Young contend that
the new museum, designed by Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and
Pierre de Meuron, will urbanize the park, hurt its historical value,
increase traffic and cast shadows on a nearby children's play area.
It also charges that the project violates the California
Environmental Quality Act.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the lawsuit is without merit," museum spokeswoman
Caroline Macmillan said. "The Board of Supervisors voted 10-1 that
the revised [environmental impact report] was adequate, accurate, and
complete, and we believe the court will find that to be the case."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Tickets for Paul McCartney's upcoming tour appearance at the
Arrowhead Pond will go on sale March 24--a day later than previously
announced.... The launch trailer for "Star Wars Episode II: Attack of
the Clones" will premiere on Fox TV in prime time on March 10. The
movie opens May 16.... Cirque du Soleil's "Dralion," opening next to
the Queen Mary in Long Beach on Wednesday, has extended its run to
April 7.... After eight years of hosting Univision's popular
investigative show "Primer Impacto," Maria Celeste Arraras has
departed the program, deciding not to renew her contract with the
network.... The Directors Guild of America is documenting 47 years of
DGA award-winning movies for television. The exhibition goes up this
weekend in its lobby at 7920 Sunset Blvd.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Art and commerce, under the guises of TV programming and corporate
sponsorship, have been crossing paths for years. From the
black-and-white days of "Kraft Television Theatre" to the crafty
product placements in series ever since, the two have sustained each
other in a synergistic dance of necessity.</LD>
<LD>   But the twin engines meet head-on Sunday with the debut on the WB
of the newest "Survivor" knockoff, a show whose title might just as
well describe what remains of the line between program and product:
"No Boundaries."</LD>
<LD>   Produced by a partnership of Ford Motor Co. and Lions Gate
Television, the weekly show sends 15 contestants into the Great White
North for 30 days to compete for $100,000 in prize money--and a Ford
Explorer. Their route from Vancouver Island, Canada, up to the Arctic
Circle is negotiated by ship, by train, by helicopter--and by Ford
SUVs.</LD>
<TE>   And not only that, but the last name of each of the contestants is
Ford. Well, that last part isn't really true, but perhaps it's
something to think about for next season.</TE>
<TE>   Is "No Boundaries" strong enough to survive for another season?
Although it's not likely to win any new converts to the genre,
"reality" fans will find enough to hold their interest. All the
familiar ingredients are here: one-by-one elimination of the
contestants (who range in age from 19 to 53); competitions for
rewards; group votes; bickering and paranoia; and plenty of whispered
plotting aimed at building alliances.</TE>
<TE>   There are some notable new wrinkles: Food is provided. A leader is
voted on by the group every two days, and the winner is immune from
elimination, but also must decide who is next to go. And when it's
time to make the cut, it's done so in a face-to-face meeting between
leader and castoff, guaranteeing some uncomfortable moments worth
watching.</TE>
<TE>   Given the frosty locale, don't tune in expecting to see the men
and women lounging about with bared chests and bikinis. Think parkas
and runny noses. But, as the series continues, there's some
late-night cuddling in the tents that's slightly more akin to
"Temptation Island" than "Survivor."</TE>
<TE>   The challenge competitions (crossing above icy rivers along a
tightrope; rappelling across a mountainside) tend to drag and aren't
as well-conceived as in "Survivor," but host Troy Hartman and group
guide Melanie McLaren do their utmost to keep spirits up.</TE>

<HD>It's Smooth Sailing in Turbulent Seas</HD>
<DH>Under guest conductor Franz Welser-Most, L.A. Philharmonic
adroitly navigates two eventful Finnish works.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Franz Welser-Most's name appears on the Los Angeles Philharmonic
schedule most seasons. That's not likely to continue, and not because
he has had a high cancellation rate due to recurring back problems.</LD>
<LD>   In the fall, he becomes music director of the prestigious
Cleveland Orchestra, and music directors of American orchestras are
seldom available for--and sometimes contractually prevented
from--guest-conducting other American ensembles. That alone makes the
42-year-old Austrian conductor's visit to the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion of great interest. But Thursday night, he showed that he had
a few tricks up his sleeve that were more than interesting in their
own right.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps it was as a good-natured jab to Los Angeles that
Welser-Most is concentrating on Finnish music for this week's
program, which begins with Kaija Saariaho's "Du Cristal" and
concludes with Sibelius' First Symphony.</LD>
<TE>   Three years ago, during the Cleveland Orchestra's search, the
previous Philharmonic management loudly boasted that its own music
director, Esa-Pekka Salonen, had turned down an offer for the post.</TE>
<TE>   But Welser-Most's programming of "Du Cristal" also appeared  an
act of respect for Salonen and the Philharmonic. Saariaho's first
work for orchestra, it was commissioned by the Philharmonic in 1990
and dedicated to Salonen. Now she is composing a new piece for
Welser-Most to premiere during his first season in Cleveland. In Los
Angeles, he could study the source of her orchestral sound, which is
extraordinary.</TE>
<TE>   "Du Cristal" (From Crystal) takes its title from biophysics and
was written during the composer's year in residence at UC San Diego.
For about 19 minutes, it presents the sensation of being immersed in
an exotic environment. I would imagine that this is what deep-sea
diving might be like. The work presents a kind of sonic soup made of
viscous, sensuously orchestrated, sustained chords that keep changing
but not in readily perceptible ways.</TE>
<TE>   But this comfortable harmonic sea through which the ear floats is
full of incident. There are fleeting, colorful solos; individual
instruments flash by like brilliant tropical fish. Exotic, deep bass
wind instruments lure us into dangerous depths where we are subject
to ominous waves of percussive thunder. Nothing is predictable but
everything wondrous.  Welser-Most and an expert and alert
Philharmonic gave themselves over fully to these remarkable sounds.</TE>
<TE>   The warm waters of sunny La Jolla clearly had an influence on
Saariaho, and there was also an unusual  southerly glow to
Welser-Most's Sibelius. The First Symphony opens with a long, somber
melody for solo clarinet, underscored by a quiet but foreboding
timpani roll. But Michele Zukovsky, playing as softly as a clarinet
can be played, made it ravishing, as if a distant siren song floating
over water, an irresistibly alluring call.</TE>
<TE>   And then  the music came on as a great, unstoppable rush.
Sibelius, whose music (even in the early Romantic works like this
symphony) can sound so strange and violent, here was almost
embracing. Rapt melodies became occasions for great outpourings of
expression.</TE>
<TE>   This was a complex performance, so fast at times that syncopated
inner lines were smudged like colors in a Turner painting. The
Philharmonic played with the verve of a whirlwind.</TE>
<TE>   In between Saariaho and Sibelius, Welser-Most offered a respite of
classical calm with Haydn's D-major Cello Concerto. Like the
conductor, the soloist, Andrew Shulman, is someone we won't be
hearing again after this season. Hired with great fanfare as the
orchestra's principal cellist, he resigned last summer after but one
season, although he agreed to stay on a second while the orchestra
holds a new search. He leaves in June. The often-euphemistic reason
given for his resignation, which came at the end of his probationary
period, is the desire to explore career options.</TE>
<TE>   Orchestras are large families all unhappy in their own ways, their
inner dynamics a mystery to outsiders. From a listener's point of
view, however, the cello section under Shulman has been robust; his
solos with the orchestra never let you down. In the Haydn, however,
he didn't seem to project quite as strongly as he does sitting among
his section, nor did the high-lying parts of the first movement sound
altogether certain. Still, there was a flexibility to his Haydn that
slowly began to win one over. The slow movement was perfectly poised.
By the Finale, the cello seemed a gleeful sailing ship, the musical
seas  that the Finnish composers stirred up were here entirely well
behaved.</TE>
<TE>   The personal dynamics underlying this performance may not be
altogether comfortable, but the surface was a pleasure.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Philharmonic program repeats tonight at 8 and
Sunday at 2:30 p.m., $12 to $78, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 135 N.
Grand Ave., downtown Los Angeles, (323) 850-2000.</TE>

<HD>Modified Truths in 'Crossed Over'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood has some peculiar ideas about re-creating real-life events
for the screen. Rarely does the unvarnished truth arrive. Instead,
it's rewritten to fit some formula or to serve an agenda.</LD>
<LD>   It comes as no surprise, then, that real events have been altered
in the CBS movie "Crossed Over" (Sunday, 9 p.m.), about the
friendship between Karla Faye Tucker, the pickax murderer who became
the focus of international attention when she was executed in Texas
in 1998, and Beverly Lowry, a mother paralyzed with grief after the
hit-and-run death of her teenage son.</LD>
<LD>   But the subtle attempts to de-emphasize Tucker's role in a
gruesome double murder--along with not-so-subtle anti-death-penalty
messages larded throughout the movie--should give viewers pause.</LD>
<TE>   Admittedly, such egregiousness is easier to overlook when the
filmmaking is this fine. Diane Keaton turns in a nicely understated
yet powerful performance as Lowry, a prim, well-put-together woman
who becomes a shadow of her former self after her son's death.</TE>
<TE>   Opposite her, Jennifer Jason Leigh dissolves almost eerily into
the role of Tucker, a tough young woman with a disconcertingly sweet
face and newfound religion. Director Bobby Roth and cinematographer
Eric Van Haren Noman find artful ways to frame their sometimes
disturbing, sometimes poignant story.</TE>
<TE>   But in spooky black-and-white flashbacks, Tucker is depicted to
have played a much less active role in the killing of Deborah
Thornton than she is documented to have had, and when her character
is strapped to a table, arms perpendicular to her sides, to receive
her lethal injection, she is photographed from overhead so that she
looks like she's being crucified. A topic as serious as the death
penalty deserves a fairer discussion than it receives here.</TE>

<HD>R&amp;B's 'Good Times Roll' on KLON</HD>
<DH>Radio* The musical genre finally gets its day in the sun
with an intimate and detailed documentary that's a coup of sorts for
the lower-profile station.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC WEINGARTEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The basic contours of rock 'n' roll history--how African American
blues was appropriated by white musicians and morphed into rock--are
easily called up by even casual fans. Ken Burns certainly raised
consciousness about jazz history last year with his 19-hour PBS
documentary "Jazz," and an ambitious series on the blues is headed to
public television in fall 2003.</LD>
<LD>   That leaves rhythm and blues, that hot-wired variation on the
blues, as the last major 20th century popular music form ripe for
lengthy exegesis.</LD>
<LD>   Starting last Monday and continuing through next week, a 13-hour
documentary series about the evolution of R&amp;B called "Let the Good
Times Roll" is running for 13 consecutive nights in L.A., but you
can't see it on KCET. It's a radio documentary, broadcast locally by
KLON-FM (88.1), that dispenses with the smooth chronological story
arc that has become synonymous with Burns' style in favor of a saga
that shambles amiably through the post-war years when the genre
blossomed, stopping occasionally to take a deeper look at specific
musical trends and sociological subplots.</LD>
<TE>   Nabbing the rights to broadcast "Let the Good Times Roll" in L.A.
is a bit of a coup for KLON, the jazz and blues station which has a
lower profile than that of public radio powerhouse KCRW. But KLON
program director Rene Engel, a veteran of L.A. public radio and an
R&amp;B fanatic, was determined to claim it for the station. "The program
works as a real unifier for us," says Engel. "It's the sort of thing
we need to do. And the first two episodes, which touch on Central
Avenue jazz and R&amp;B and doo-wop, really focus on L.A. music history."</TE>
<TE>   Narrated by R&amp;B legend Jerry Butler and featuring interviews with
Ahmet Ertegun, Ben E. King and a host of others, "Let the Good Times
Roll" takes in its subject with the voracious sweep and scope of a
typical Burns survey. It also takes full advantage of radio's
intimacy to lure the listener as wizened, weather-beaten voices--some
300 in all--tell a mesmerizing tale of race and redemption forged in
a furious musical tempest.</TE>
<TE>   The series was conceived and produced by the Rhythm and Blues
Foundation, a not-for-profit organization that provides financial
assistance to veteran R&amp;B musicians. The foundation is best known for
its annual fund-raising Pioneer Awards ceremony, which recognizes the
achievement of past legends.</TE>
<TE>   "Susan Jenkins, the former executive director of the Rhythm and
Blues Foundation, had the idea of the series as a way of recognizing
the pioneers of R&amp;B, aside from the awards show," says series'
producer Lex Gillespie, whose $220,000 budget came from the Corp. for
Public Broadcasting and the National Endowment for the Arts (Public
Radio International is the show's distributor). Although that's a
fraction of the $6 million Ken Burns spent on "Jazz," Gillespie
jokes, "I felt guilty spending all that money!"</TE>
<TE>   Gillespie spent three years piecing together the raw materials for
"Let the Good Times Roll," interviewing 300 musicians, promoters,
producers, radio deejays, songwriters and a host of others and
amassing nearly 280 songs. In the process, he clocked thousands of
air miles, traveling from Mississippi to Los Angeles in search of
great anecdotes.</TE>
<TE>   "I really tried not to tell the same stories that everyone has
heard so many times," he says. "When you're talking about something
like Motown, countless books have been written on the subject, so we
tried to go behind the scenes, make it less personality-driven."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the wisest artistic choice was to devote entire episodes
to often overlooked but crucial aspects of R&amp;B's evolution. Episode
5, titled "Honkers, Bar Walkers and Screamers," profiles the great
sax players of R&amp;B's golden age, which roughly spanned 1945 through
1970. Episode 6, "Bold, Bawdy and Banned," examines the ways in which
R&amp;B artists subverted mainstream radio with salacious "coded" lyrical
content. Discussing his notorious song "Work With Me, Annie" on the
show, Hank Ballard explains the logic of his thinly veiled euphemism:
"Sex is work! You've gotta work to please your woman!"</TE>
<TE>   "I've been around for 40 years, and a lot of the stuff in there, I
didn't know," says Butler, a former member of the Impressions and
current Rhythm and Blues Foundation board chairman. "It will be
mind-blowing to all the music bluffs who think they know everything
that came down the pike."</TE>
<TE>   Butler's warm, avuncular presence as the series' host provides
"Let the Good Times Roll" with a living eyewitness who often throws
the narrative into sharp relief with anecdotes taken from his
autobiography, "Only the Strong Survive." "I conducted a long oral
history with him," says Gillespie, "and I could just pull the stories
out whenever they were appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Lacking the hushed gravitas of "Jazz" and the scholarly rigor of
author Peter Guralnick's book, "Sweet Soul Music," "Let the Good
Times Roll" nonetheless does a fine job of chronicling the ways in
which R&amp;B mirrored the social struggles of African Americans during
the pre-civil-rights era. Although for years R&amp;B functioned as a
shadow movement created by black musicians marginalized by
segregation for a black audience eager to embrace it, the music sowed
the seeds of social change when it began to cross over.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked Julian Bond, the great civil rights leader, what role R&amp;B
music played in the struggles for civil rights," says Gillespie. "He
said that when white kids started listening to black radio, that just
opened the door just slightly for changes to take place. Almost like
the Berlin Wall falling."</TE>
<TE>   "Let the Good Times Roll," KLON-FM (88.1) 7 to 8 p.m. tonight
through March 9.</TE>

<HD>Ashcroft's Statements on Christianity</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "What's God Got to Do With It?" Commentary, Feb. 26: Sorry, but as
a secular citizen who receives many of the benefits of a nation built
on Judeo-Christian principles, I'm not alarmed by Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft's outward acknowledgment of his faith. But I am alarmed by
the relentless assault on Christianity from the politically
intolerant left.</LD>
<LD>   At the National Religious Broadcasters convention Ashcroft also
said (on TV) that his religion does not allow him to impose his
beliefs on others. How much more plainly can he speak? This new
attorney general is honest. That is why I trust him.</LD>
<LD>   Marc Atkinson</LD>
<TE>   Tujunga</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thank you, Robert Scheer, for pointing out that virtue and
responsibility are not dependent upon faith in a major religion. An
argument can even be made for an inverse relationship between them.
Without the assumptions of a purposeful master designer of the
universe or the accessible forgiveness of a benevolent God to absolve
us of our wrongdoings, there can be only one course to a better life
on Earth. That course lies in each individual developing his or her
own human potential to act with honor and caring toward others.
Should the tenets of any religion eventually earn a worldwide
consensus, those who had lived so without the motivation of religious
faith would still have taken the right tack.</TE>
<TE>   Rene Dernburg</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Poor Robert Scheer. His bile, always issued from the left, has now
apparently choked off what remaining reasoning powers he had left. In
a desperate attempt to tar Ashcroft with anything, he chooses to
assail Ashcroft's statement that the source of freedom and human
dignity is the creator. Scheer then concludes that this is some scary
statement of religious intolerance.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, it is merely a recognition of the sentiments of the
founding fathers--and the Declaration of Independence, in particular.
This view of natural rights is, in fact, the only one that truly
protects all the freedoms we enjoy, even the freedom of ideological
columnists to demonstrate their ignorance in print.</TE>
<TE>   James S. Bell</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yes! Yes! Yes! Thank "God" for Scheer . . . and for a Constitution
that provides that no U.S. citizen can legally be penalized for what
he or she believes or does not believe. In America we have both
freedom of religion and freedom from religion, if that fits one's
view of the universe.</TE>

<LD>Since we announced CC, the world's first cat clone, Genetic Savings &amp;
Clone has been criticized by some advocates of animal rescue
shelters. Wayne Pacelle of the Humane Society was quoted saying, "We
all understand the impulse to hold on to an animal you love, but this
is the wrong way to do it" (Feb. 15).</LD>
<LD>   We do get calls from people who want us to make their animals
immortal, but we gently correct their misconceptions and steer them
toward animal adoption or grief counseling resources. The fact is,
our clients want animals they can't obtain from shelters or breeders;
they seek genetic duplicates of specific animals. That doesn't mean
that they, or we, are callous about the plight of shelter animals.</LD>
<LD>   Our code of bioethics states that we'll help reduce the cat and
dog population. Last year we committed $750,000 to an effort at the
University of Virginia to develop an injectable sterilant for cats
and dogs. This low-cost, nonsurgical alternative to spaying and
neutering could be an important solution to the problem. We also gave
$250,000 to spay/neuter clinics.</LD>

<LD>Ansel Adams was a great artist, but I am confident he is turning over
in his grave at the destruction being wreaked on his beloved planet
("America's Wilderness Eye," editorial, Feb. 23). Today he would be
photographing the growing deserts, the crumbling glaciers, the
once-snow-covered mountains now dry and barren, the dwindling
fisheries, the destruction from the exaggerated weather patterns. We
are now on an accelerating path to extinction of species in nature.</LD>
<LD>   Since we belong to nature, that includes our species. We need that
story told in pictures. Until then, a concise report can be found at
http://www.eces.org, a nonprofit voluntary Web site whose simple
facts are chilling.</LD>

<LD>"Vote Threatens Ruling Coalition" (Opinion, Feb. 24) illuminated that
Santa Monica's at-large election system enacted in 1946 was inspired
in part by the racist intent to keep African Americans out of
government. Long ago the Voting Rights Act eliminated similar
at-large election systems from the South and replaced them with more
democratic, district-based systems.</LD>
<LD>   Passage of the district electoral reform Veritas measure on the
November ballot will not only allow "progressive" Santa Monica to

<LD>Re "Say Yes to Prop. 42," Commentary, Feb. 25: When are people
finally going to understand that there is no such thing as "something
for nothing"? Larry McCarthy says that we will be able to accomplish
a long list of road repairs and improvements as well as extension of
commuter rail lines and improvements to bus service "without raising
one dollar of additional tax." His premise (and this is mirrored by
the TV ads) is that if we force the politicians to spend the money
that is raised from fuel taxes on highways and public transportation,
we will be able to improve California's transportation system without
increasing taxes.</LD>
<LD>   The obvious question that is not being asked or answered is "What
are these funds being spent on now?" If these funds are now going to
be spent on highways and transportation, whatever they were being
used for previously is going to have to be replaced with other
funding sources, which means . . . you guessed it. Increased taxes.</LD>
<LD>   In the context of the state's overall budget the numbers are not
that big, even considering that with the reduction of federal moneys
for highways that President Bush is proposing, California will need
to come up with additional funds. The improvements are needed
(desperately). The projects will create jobs and stimulate the
economy. I agree. Just don't insult my intelligence by telling me it
is going to be free.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Hang On, State's Roads a Rough Ride," Feb. 26: I propose using
the road maintenance money to expand light rail along the San Diego
Freeway instead. The Southern California Assn. of Governments'
regional transportation plan projects freeway commute speeds reduced
into the teens by 2020--despite spending our money on more roads and
maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   The article states that massive road maintenance projects are
needed to reduce increased vehicle operating costs. Our roads are
becoming so jammed that poor road conditions will have far less
impact on auto repairs as cars crawl to their destinations.</TE>

<TE>   The Times' Feb. 18 editorial urged voters to reject Proposition 42
on Tuesday's ballot. The Auto Club believes that voters should
approve it. This measure would permanently dedicate the state's share
of the sales tax on gasoline (over $1 billion per year) to help
repair and rehabilitate the state's crumbling transportation
infrastructure without increasing taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Our roads and freeways are suffering from neglect and all of us
who travel on them feel the impact. Highway spending in California
has dropped from about $60 per 1,000 vehicle miles driven in the
1960s to (adjusting for inflation) less than $4 today, the least of
any state in the nation. Southern California drivers spend 40 to 60
hours a year delayed in traffic congestion, costing drivers from $700
to $1,000 each year in time and gasoline and over $500 in unnecessary
repairs.</TE>
<TE>   We must make transportation investment a priority once again if we
want to preserve and improve our quality of life. Proposition 42 is a
start.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Latinos Have Waited Long Enough for the Belmont Complex,"
Commentary, Feb. 24:</LD>
<LD>   As an LAUSD teacher and United Teachers of Los Angeles member, I
was saddened but not surprised by how Frank del Olmo and some Latino
leaders have now apparently turned against their friend and ally,
UTLA. Many of us have long thought it is a mistake for the UTLA to
use teachers' money, and to take political stands in the name of
teachers, on any issues except labor issues affecting teachers in the
LAUSD. Nevertheless, throwing caution to the wind, we of UTLA, always
a friend to Latino activists and their issues in Los Angeles, decided
to formally oppose Proposition 227 and later funded lawsuits to
overturn Proposition 227 on behalf of parents who wished their
children to resume being taught to read, write and compute in
Spanish.</LD>
<LD>   Now that the UTLA is speaking up in the context of Belmont about
legitimate teacher labor issues presented by some charter schools, do
UTLA's onetime Latino activist friends and allies support us, or at
least remain neutral? No. Some of them, including Del Olmo, actually
turn on us, publicly criticizing and opposing us. This is a perfect
illustration of the old cliche: No good deed goes unpunished.
Hopefully, we of UTLA have learned our lesson.</LD>

<TE>   As I understand it, the Belmont Learning Complex was abandoned
because of worries of environmental contamination and various
illnesses caused by the contamination. Now the Alliance for a Better
Community and Del Olmo are pushing the LAUSD to complete the learning
complex and open it. Will the ABC and Del Olmo assume the potential
financial liability for illnesses coming from the ground
contamination? Just wondering.</TE>

<LD>Re "The Bush Oil-Igarchy Protection Package," Commentary, Feb. 22:
Arianna Huffington makes the ludicrous argument that campaign
contributions made by Occidental Petroleum during the Clinton era
induced the Bush administration to propose funding a plan to protect
an Oxy pipeline in Colombia. Last year, terrorist attacks on the
pipeline, operated by the Colombian government, cost Colombia a
half-billion dollars. The government gets 85 cents of every dollar of
revenue.</LD>
<LD>   The disruptions devastated the state of Arauca (population
240,000), which depends on the pipeline for 98% of its budget.
Hospital service was curtailed and thousands of workers, including
teachers and doctors, went for months without paychecks.</LD>
<LD>   In declaring that the attacks put a "downward drag" on Oxy's
profits, Huffington obviously ignored Oxy's announcement of record
earnings in 2001 for its oil and gas operations, despite the worst
year ever in Colombia.</LD>
<TE>   Oxy's billion-barrel discovery in 1983 transformed Colombia from
an oil importer to an exporter, generated billions of dollars for the
Colombian government, created thousands of good-paying jobs--and
produced an attractive return on investment for Oxy.</TE>

<HD>The State of California vs. the Catholic Church</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS J. CURRY</AU>
<BD>Thomas J. Curry is auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese
of Los Angeles in charge of the Santa Barbara region and author of
"Farewell to Christendom: The Future of Church and State in America"
(Oxford University Press, 2001).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Religious liberty is under attack by the state of California. It is
using the Women's Contraception Equity Act, now before the California
Supreme Court, to justify its attempt to gain control over religion
and churches.</LD>
<LD>   The law requires employers who provide prescription drug coverage
to include contraception coverage in their employee health insurance
plans. Though it provides for exemptions for some religious groups,
granting these exemptions would require the government and courts to
decide religious matters. Catholic Charities, which had sued to stop
the state from enforcing the 1999 law, argues that the law would
force it to violate the teaching of the Catholic Church. Two lower
courts have ruled against the church.</LD>
<LD>   The state says that Catholic Charities, one of the church's main
charitable arms, is a secular rather than a religious organization.
While religious organizations always have been subject to legitimate
secular legislation, for the state to claim that it will define what
are religious organizations represents a new and dangerous claim to
power.</LD>
<TE>   The state presents an even bolder argument: that the purpose of
Catholic Charities is not to inculcate "religious values." If
accepted, this argument would make the government the definer of
religious teaching and values.</TE>
<TE>   The state also argues that for Catholic Charities to qualify for
an exemption, it must hire mostly Catholics and must limit its
outreach for the most part to Catholics. If the state wins this case,
the government will have the right to define which employees of
Catholic Charities are Catholic. Will courts examine workers'
religious beliefs? Will judges or state officials count baptized
Catholics or only practicing Catholics? And who will determine what
constitutes "practicing"? Will poor people seeking help from Catholic
Charities have to produce baptismal certificates as a proof of
eligibility?</TE>
<TE>   The Women's Contraception Act punishes churches whose service to
the poor involves no religious requirement. In attempting to define
religion and to confine it within narrow sectarian boundaries,
California is in effect establishing religion.</TE>
<TE>   The state argues that the law's intent is to promote fairness and
the rights of women. But no right should be advanced by sacrificing
one of the most fundamental and treasured of all our freedoms, that
of religious liberty and the independence of churches.</TE>
<TE>   If California wins this case, it will be empowered to define what
is or is not a religious organization. It will have the authority to
determine religious values and to adjudicate church membership. In
that event, not only will the Catholic Church lose but so will all
other churches and so will the right to religious freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the Catholic position on contraception is controversial. Yes,
many Californians are opposed to it. It would be tragic, however, if
this opposition is allowed to obscure an attack by the state of
California on the shared American treasure of religious liberty.</TE>

when I student-taught kindergarten. I checked out some easy picture
books with repetitive stories, like "The Three Billy Goats Gruff"
from the public library. After reading these books aloud to my
students, I put the copies out for the children to look at in their
free time. The result? The kids fought over the books I had read to
them in class.</LD>
<LD>   Without any prompting, they would "read" these books aloud to each
other--pretending that they had mastered reading in English.</LD>
<LD>   They were thrilled and so was I. Even as a trained professional
teacher, I realized that the formal objective I had written in my
lesson plans didn't matter.</LD>
<TE>   It didn't matter that the students couldn't read yet or that they
might not score as well as their English-speaking classmates on
standardized tests in future years. What mattered was that they saw
books as fun and enjoyable, not a chore.</TE>
<TE>   As an ex-teacher and, currently, as an assistant children's
librarian, I know that everyone wants children to read, but it seems
we want children to read only to perform better in school and on
tests.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers, parents, politicians and even our libraries seem to have
forgotten about promoting reading for pleasure.</TE>
<TE>   However, due to the state's test-score paranoia, schools now
participate in Accelerated Reader's Programs where books are listed
with grade level and possible points next to each title. When a child
is finished reading a book from this list (on non-school time), a
test is administered and points awarded for a passing score.</TE>
<TE>   The intrinsic rewards of reading are once again forgotten. If
parents wanted their children to love reading, they would demand that
their children pick out their own library books. Instead, parents
more often locate books on their child's behalf, which, whatever a
parent's misguided intention, is cheating.</TE>
<TE>   One of a teacher's objectives in assigning research papers or
outside reading is, after all, for students to become frequent
library-users and competent book-hunters.</TE>
<TE>   If California's government wanted children to love reading, then
our children would have more than a mere five classroom books per
student when the national average of books per student is 17.</TE>
<TE>   California would have more than one school library media
specialist for every 3,548 students when the national
librarian-to-student ratio is one per 953.</TE>
<TE>   If California public libraries wanted children to love reading,
they would stop spending precious funds on videos and computers for
games and free Internet access. Getting kids to love reading means
getting kids more books to love.</TE>
<TE>   It may be that California's low standardized test scores are the
direct result of our collective failure to promote a love of books
and reading.</TE>
<TE>   The solution to our indifference is simple. Run to the local
public library and check out a book. Public libraries rely on the
statistics of how many people walk through their doors and what is
checked out to prove that they need funding to buy more books.</TE>
<TE>   In honor of Read Across America Day, which was recently, let's
start spending our money and energy on proving that we love to read,
rather than trying to prove that we can test well.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "No Wonder Women Feel They Must Have Face Lifts" (Commentary, Feb.
22), Joan Jacobs Brumberg and Jacquelyn Jackson make the point that
the compulsion to conform to culturally defined standards of beauty
begins early in childhood. As a therapist, I have seen girls as young
as 5 worrying about being "fat" or "ugly." Girls of all ages need to
be recognized and praised for their inner beauty, for attributes such
as their creativity, strength, intellectual curiosity, leadership
skills or compassion for the lives of others.</LD>
<LD>   "Turn Beauty Inside Out Day," a celebration of reclaiming what it
really means to be beautiful, will be held on May 15. Girls all over
our country will be organizing local community events, conducting
letter writing campaigns, holding marches or other media events to
raise issue awareness. This event is being sponsored by New Moon, an
organization for girls based in Minnesota. For more information call
(800) 381-4743, ext. 19.</LD>

<TE>   Brumberg and Jackson join the endless parade of peddlers who try
to turn a buck by convincing members of a particular faction of their
victimization, in this case young females who appear to require
elderly, overweight and unattractive ladies as role models. As the
son and husband of women who capably think for themselves, this
perpetual notion of girls as victims of the fashion and image
industries has never resonated with me.</TE>
<TE>   As for the dearth of female elders in high-profile positions, I
might point out that Anne Robinson ("Weakest Link"), Madeleine
Albright and Susan Sarandon should provide plenty of guidance for
those clamoring for leadership.</TE>

<TE>   I am a 52-year-old, "white American woman," well past my time of
"youthful beauty." I've never colored or permed my hair, never had
plastic surgery or "a needle pushing poison" into my face. I have,
sometimes proudly and sometimes heartbreakingly, earned every gray
hair, every wrinkle and sag I have. I feel no anxiety or shame at the
outward evidence of my aging and have no plans to chemically or
surgically attempt to reverse or slow the process.</TE>
<TE>   When all children are brought up to value the mind and heart above
physical beauty, when advertisers regularly employ those whose true
beauty shows through the deep wrinkles and age spots and thinning
hair, then perhaps society as a whole will realize that "youthful
beauty" is as meaningless to a woman's worth as wax on a tortoise's
shell.</TE>

narcissistic, stupid and self-destructive. The individuals are sick,
not the society.</TE>

<LD>Re "Ideologues Have Hijacked an Important Debate," Opinion, Feb. 24:
Jonah Goldberg "politely" savages Pat Buchanan, Samuel Francis and
Peter Brimelow for their stands in opposition to immigration
(particularly illegal) to the United States. He refers to these men
as hysterical and paints them with the same brush as Afrocentrists,
La Raza, et al. However, nowhere in the article does Goldberg address
the facts. Nowhere does he discuss what rampant immigration is doing
to our schools, our health care system and our criminal justice
system.</LD>
<LD>   Goldberg is apparently a conservative in name only, one who no
longer believes in any principle other than winning elections.
Goldberg's ad hominem attacks on these three men are as unfortunate
as they are condescending. He would be better served by caring less
about offending potential voters and more about what is happening to
his country.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is fascinating that political correctness has now infected even
right-wing Republicans, as demonstrated in Goldberg's denunciation of
Americans (e.g., Brimelow's VDARE.com) who prefer our culture to that
of the Taliban, for example.</TE>
<TE>   However, Goldberg is quite correct to note that it is not about
race. There is a world of difference between an American black family
and Somali immigrants whose women have been mutilated by barbarities
now illegal in this country. (Among the many objectionable cultural
practices accompanying Third World immigrants has been female genital
mutilation.)</TE>
<TE>   Seeing brutal cultural norms in Islamic countries has awakened
many naive Americans to the fact that cultures are not all equal or
worthy of respect. As a feminist, I have particular misgivings about
the U.S. admitting millions of immigrants from cultures that regard
women as subhuman property. I could do without such diversity.</TE>

<TE>   The real, unmentioned problem about current levels of immigration
is overpopulation. According to the Census Bureau, the population of
the U.S. will reach half a billion within 50 years at our present
growth rate, virtually all of which is due to immigration, both legal
and otherwise. It's time for a moratorium on all immigration.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"States Cut Back Coverage for Poor" (Feb. 25), on cutting back health
care for poor children, makes my blood boil. As a liberal Democrat, I
am in agreement with President Bush's war on terrorism and I know it
consumes a large part of our federal budget. However, I am angry with
the entire federal government for not giving us national health care.
With the addition of prescription drug coverage, our model for
Medicare should be extended to cover every man, woman and child in
the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   England, France and Germany--in fact, most of the civilized
countries in the world--have free health care, some better than
others, of course. I often hear the criticism that people in those
countries have to wait for certain treatments that are not urgent,
but they should realize that everyone still has the option of using
private doctors, as we do here.</LD>
<LD>   Stacey Peck</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So Utah, the state with plenty of money to court and host the 2002
Winter Olympics, cannot come up with its 20% to fund health insurance
for poor children. With our federal government paying 80% for the
popular children's health insurance program, isn't it a sense of
misplaced priorities that makes states--including California--limit
or drop their support for the health of our wealthy nation's
impoverished children?</TE>
<TE>   That looks like a mighty inhumane budget cut to me. And reduced
medical insurance will also prove expensive as the costs of what
medical care these poor kids do get are transferred to our
overburdened emergency room network.</TE>

<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We see that when it comes to providing necessary health care to
families that need it (poor, yet who do not qualify for Medicaid),
the Republicans once again rise from their caves to pronounce to the
world: "Unless we rein in this very generous program--the Cadillac of
all programs--it's going to bust our budget and force a tax
increase," said Diane Kinderwater, a spokeswoman for New Mexico's
Republican Gov. Gary Johnson. Or much worse, our very own California
state Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside) states, "We're only making our
budget deficit worse and we're doing it in the worst possible way."</TE>
<TE>   Are these Republicans for real? Since when does any Republican
give a hoot about deficit spending or raising taxes--remember,
bombing indefinitely and the phrase "Read my lips."</TE>

<LD>"Tax Loophole, With a Beach" (editorial, Feb. 24) didn't go quite far
enough. The tax loopholes are as big as the whole West Coast! In the
Business Week magazine article you quote, it was stated that "52 of
the 250 biggest U.S. companies paid effective tax rates of 10% or
less in 1998 (the last year for which such data are available).
Nearly half of those paid no taxes or got refunds."</LD>
<LD>   Now consider that the stimulus package passed by the House last
fall proposed to eliminate the alternative minimum tax for
businesses, making refunds retroactive to 1986. This would have
returned billions to these "poor, overtaxed" corporations ($1.4
billion to IBM, $700 million to General Electric and $240 million to
his friends at Enron).</LD>
<LD>   Our president pushed through his $1.4-trillion tax reduction
package, which gave 38% of the reduction to the top 5% of wage
earners. With such largess it is obvious that the poor and middle
class will be left to pay the government's bills.</LD>

<TE>   Congress has created this abominable tax code and Congress must
fix it.</TE>
<TE>   Corporations don't pay taxes anyway--you do--so solve the problem
by eliminating the corporate income tax or just legislate a flat tax
with no deductions.</TE>

I can get a tax deduction for the $15,000 our family spent on medical
bills this past year. Many people believe that being on Medicare
means that participants get a total free ride on medical bills. It's
not true! Why shouldn't the government allow all of us to deduct all
medical expenses? Why should nonincorporated, average citizens have
to exceed 7.5% of total income before they can take a deduction?</TE>
<TE>   Businesses pay medical for employees. Then they are allowed to
deduct the total amount as a business expense, and neither the
company nor the employee has to pay tax on it.</TE>
<TE>   Why can't all of us, employed or unemployed, have a full
deduction? That's certainly better, and fairer, than the current
alternative for us. That alternative? Merely have $750,000 in a bank
(at a 2% rate on savings) to cover our yearly $15,000 medical. Gosh,
anybody can do that.</TE>

<HD>Disney Stores to Get Redesign</HD>
<DH>Retail: Overhaul would turn the chain into two specialty
outlets--one for kids, one for parents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the latest effort to revive its struggling retail store chain,
Walt Disney Co. said Friday that it will turn it into two groups of
specialty stores.</LD>
<LD>   The renamed Disney Play stores will target 3- to 10-year-olds and
stock toys, costumes based on Disney characters and plush Mickey
Mouse and Winnie the Pooh dolls.</LD>
<LD>   The other outlets will be called Disney Kids at Home, which will
be aimed at parents seeking bed and bath products, apparel and home
furnishings for their kids.</LD>
<TE>   Disney said the overhaul will cost $200 million over the next
three years. It plans to continue closing under-performing stores.</TE>
<TE>   But the design change isn't likely to produce a quick upturn in
sales, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Just getting people into the store is something they're having
difficulty with," said Katherine Styponias, an analyst with
Prudential Securities, noting that the recession has slowed sales in
Disney's merchandise business. "They're competing with a lot more
[non-Disney characters], and their core audience is a lot smaller
than it used to be."</TE>
<TE>   However, Disney said its unprofitable store chain will show a
profit this year.</TE>
<TE>   Disney began testing prototypes of the new stores in Canoga Park
and Torrance late last year.</TE>
<TE>   "As a specialty retailer, we need to focus on our core customers,"
said Peter Whitford, president of Disney Stores Worldwide. "Unless
you're the size of a department store, it's hard to be all things to
all people."</TE>
<TE>   The overhaul comes as Disney is scaling back its retail chain,
from a high of more than 500 stores in the U.S. to about 350 by 2005.
The remaining U.S. stores will be remodeled according to one of the
two specialty groups, though some locations might be a mix of both.
The 189 overseas stores will remain Disney Stores, which sell
everything from lunch boxes to movies and toys.</TE>
<TE>   Disney launched the store chain in 1987 and it was an important
money maker for the company in the 1990s, when hit animated movies
such as "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin" created a huge demand
for figurines, pajamas, clocks and toys based on popular characters.</TE>
<TE>   But Disney built too many stores, saturated the market with its
library of characters and failed to keep the merchandise fresh with
changing trends, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Other entertainment companies also struggled in the retail arena,
and Warner Bros. pulled out of the retail business last year.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's retail stores accounted for only 4% of Disney's consumer
products division's $834 million in sales in the latest quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the unit's sales are from licensing Disney characters for
merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's previous store redesign came 18 months ago, when the
company said it would overhaul 350 of its Disney Stores and close 100
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Those new stores, which began with prototypes in Costa Mesa and
Cherry Hill, N.J., were more spacious and had a high-tech look,
equipped with computers customers could use to buy theme park
tickets.</TE>
<TE>   About 20 stores had been redesigned when Disney in April tapped
veteran retail executive Whitford, formerly chief executive of
Structure, the men's sportswear division of Limited Inc., to head the
retail operation.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the analysts were correct. [In the past] the merchandise
was stale," Whitford said. "We need to work with a lot more speed to
ensure that we are meeting the needs of our guests."</TE>

<LD>First Alliance Corp. and its founder reached a settlement Friday of
predatory-lending lawsuits by the Federal Trade Commission, six
states and several private plaintiff groups--a deal that could bring
possibly $75 million in restitution to thousands of borrowers.</LD>
<LD>   The Irvine home-equity lender was accused of systematically
cheating homeowners on refinancing deals and concealing huge
origination fees. The interest on many loans inevitably would be much
higher than the initial rate, the suits said.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, signed by attorneys for all parties, would provide funds
to cover claims as far back as 1992.</LD>
<TE>   "We have a tentative agreement, and I think it will work out,"
said Herschel Elkins, head of the consumer law unit at the California
attorney general's office. He declined to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   Others involved in the case said First Alliance would liquidate
its assets to provide most of the money to a redress fund for
borrowers. The assets of the company, which filed for bankruptcy in
2000, is believed to be worth more than $70 million, most of which
would be available for the fund after other debts are paid.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the settlement, First Alliance's founder, Brian
Chisick, and his wife, who still own 80% of the company, have agreed
to provide millions of dollars of their own, people involved in the
negotiations said. Without admitting guilt, the Chisicks also agreed
to be banned from the lending business for life. The agreement must
be approved by the FTC, the state attorneys general and District
Judge David O. Carter in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   In an offshoot case, several attorneys representing borrowers have
sued the financial firms that lent money to First Alliance and
bundled its loans into securities for sale to investors. The
defendants, Lehman Bros. Holdings, Prudential Securities and First
Union Bank, deny wrongdoing.</TE>

<LD>FleetBoston Financial Corp.'s Fleet National Bank, a lender to Global
Crossing Ltd., said the fiber-optic network operator's proposal to
sell assets to two Asian rivals is unfair to creditors.</LD>
<LD>   Hamilton, Bermuda-based Global Crossing, which in January filed
for the fourth-largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy in U.S. history, agreed
to sell a 79% stake to Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., controlled by Hong
Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, and Singapore Technologies Telemedia
Ltd., for $750 million.</LD>
<LD>   Fleet National Bank, which is owed at least $77 million by Global
Crossing, contends the price is too low and the arrangement would
give the company's creditors less value than if it were to liquidate,
according to papers filed Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New
York.</LD>
<TE>   The arrangement "violates a fundamental precept of the Chapter 11
process--to reorganize or otherwise liquidate property of the estate
in a manner which maximizes the value available to creditors,"
according to the papers.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Hutchison-ST Telemedia buyout proposal, creditors owed
about $12.4 billion would receive 21% of the reorganized company's
new shares, $800 million in notes and $300 million in cash, according
to Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   In other action Friday, attorneys representing Global Crossing
shareholders asked a federal judge to order the company's auditor,
Andersen, to make an inventory of which Global Crossing documents it
had retained or destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   The request covers all documents that Andersen had in its
possession before Jan. 10, when the company instituted a policy
banning document destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The law firm, San Diego-based Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &amp;
Lerach, also asked the judge to appoint an independent expert to
review and secure Global Crossing-related information at Andersen
offices.</TE>

<LD>Ford Motor Co. paid an undisclosed amount to settle claims by a Texan
who says he was paralyzed when his Expedition sport-utility vehicle
flipped and the roof collapsed.</LD>
<LD>   The case was the first involving the Expedition's roof design to
go to trial.</LD>
<LD>   The car maker, which already faces at least $600 million in legal
claims involving rollovers of its smaller Explorer sport-utility
vehicles, agreed to settle after the trial judge urged both sides to
reach an accord.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm glad it's over," said Charles Roland of Maude, Texas, who
blamed a defective roof and faulty seat belts for injuries that left
him a paraplegic.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Ford rose 76 cents to close at $15.64 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>Imax Corp. reported a fourth-quarter profit, boosted by a one-time
gain, and predicted it will return to profitability this year after a
tough 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The Mississauga, Canada-based maker of big-screen movie-systems
recorded net income of $19.3 million, or 63 cents a share, in the
quarter, compared with a loss of $32.5 million, or $1.08, a year
earlier.</LD>
<LD>   But profit was boosted by a extraordinary gain of $31.2 million,
linked to the company's buyback of its 5.75% convertible subordinated
notes due April 2003.</LD>
<TE>   Imax said it has retired about $90 million of the $100 million of
the notes outstanding for less than 24% of their face value.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue in the quarter dropped 26% to $33.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   Imax stock jumped 38 cents to $3.89 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc. said Friday that it reduced its sales and
cash flow forecasts after cutting prices. The third-largest U.S.
mobile-telephone company also is paying $285 million to buy the rest
of a joint wireless venture in Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   Wireless service sales, excluding an acquisition, will rise this
year by a "low double digits" percentage, AT&amp;T Wireless said. The
company had forecast growth in the "low teens."</LD>
<LD>   Separately, the company agreed to buy the 49% of AT&amp;T Wireless PCS
of Philadelphia that it didn't own for cash from Chicago-based Exelon
Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of AT&amp;T Wireless fell $1.49 to $8.60 on the New York Stock
Exchange. They have fallen 30% this year. Exelon shares rose $1.24 to
$50.52, also on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T Wireless said earnings, excluding depreciation and
amortization, would rise to the "low to mid-20s" in percentage
growth. That's less than an earlier company forecast, which excluded
TeleCorp, acquired last month.</TE>

third quarter, their smallest increase in five years, the Office of
Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight said.</LD>
<LD>   This sharp slowdown in home appreciation could drain a financial
resource for homeowners, who have kept the recession from worsening.
Americans have not pared back spending despite growing unemployment
and a poor stock market.</LD>
<LD>   Homeowners have benefited from rapid home appreciation by selling
their homes, or borrowing against higher home values through
refinancing, or by taking out home equity loans.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sprint Corp. said it had lined up a $1-billion bank loan, helping
allay investor fears of an imminent cash crunch. Its shares rose as
much as 7%.</LD>
<LD>   To obtain the loan from Citibank and Deutsche Bank, Sprint pledged
its phone directory publishing business as collateral. It hired the
banks' investment banking arms to help it explore the possible sale
of the business.</LD>
<LD>   Kansas City, Mo.-based Sprint also said it planned to extend its
accounts receivable program to include receivables of its Sprint PCS
Group Inc. wireless telephone unit, giving it access to more than
$500 million of additional cash.</LD>
<TE>   Sprint shares have fallen this year on fears that the company
would be shut out of the commercial paper market and forced to tap
its $5-billion bank credit line, usually a last resort.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Sprint fell 20 cents to $12.48, while Sprint PCS shares
fell 42 cents to $8.83, both on the NYSE.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Billionaire financier Carl Icahn filed a $300-million lawsuit against
the owners of former nightclub king Ian Schrager's trendy hotels,
charging they cheated shareholders in three real estate ventures.</LD>
<LD>   Icahn, the famed 1980s corporate raider best known for battles for
control of Texaco, TWA and Reynolds Tobacco, turned to the New York
State Supreme Court to redress what he says is a "blatant disregard
for shareholders" in three real estate investment trusts, Shelbourne
Properties I, II and III .</LD>
<LD>   Icahn offered to buy the REITs, but Shelbourne's management
company, NorthStar Capital Investment Corp., kept his highest bid
from shareholders, according to the suit.</LD>
<TE>   The suit, filed late last month, alleges that NorthStar failed to
present to Shelbourne board members details of Icahn's sweetened
$190-million bid for the three REITs.</TE>
<TE>   Calls to NorthStar and Shelbourne for comment weren't immediately
returned.</TE>

<HD>Russia to Impose Ban on Poultry From U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Russia will ban imports of U.S. poultry as of March 10, saying it is
concerned that chlorine-based disinfectants used by U.S. producers
such as Tyson Foods Inc. may cause cancer, the Agriculture Ministry
said.</LD>
<LD>   Mikhail Kravchuk, head of the ministry's veterinary department,
approved the ban after the U.S. failed to respond to Russia's request
for a list of drugs and hormones added to chicken feed.</LD>
<LD>   The decision came two days after Russian steelmakers asked the
government to block U.S. chicken imports, worth about $660 million
last year, if the Bush administration imposed sanctions on Russian
steel.</LD>
<TE>   Russia is the world's largest poultry importer and the U.S. is its
No. 1 supplier. The European Union barred U.S. poultry imports in
1997 because of laws banning the use of chlorine in processing.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Settles Arizona Lawsuit</HD>
<DH>Courts: Auditor agrees to pay $217 million in damages for
failing to uncover fraud in Baptist Foundation investment fund.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The troubled Andersen accounting firm agreed to pay $217 million in
damages Friday for failing to uncover fraud involving an
Arizona-based investment fund it audited.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen's willingness to reach a settlement with the Arizona
attorney general's office is part of a broad strategy to resolve
pending claims as it prepares to deal with the fallout from its
failure to report serious financial problems at Enron Corp., analysts
said. Trial in the Arizona case had been set to begin Monday.</LD>
<LD>   In its initial discussions with attorneys representing Enron
shareholders, the nation's fifth-largest accounting firm has floated
a settlement figure in the $750-million range, including a
$250-million payment from insurance and subsequent annual
installments, according to an attorney familiar with the discussions.</LD>
<TE>   In the Arizona case, Andersen was accused of ignoring warnings
that the Baptist Foundation of Arizona investment fund was using
off-balance-sheet ventures to hide losses.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1948, the foundation raised money for religious causes
by selling notes to churches and private investors. It offered rates
that were typically better than savings accounts, and the fund
claimed that it would use its share of investment earnings to advance
Christian projects.</TE>
<TE>   Soured real estate investments created huge losses for the fund,
and Arizona officials said it gradually turned into a giant Ponzi
scheme in which 13,000 investors lost nearly $600 million.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement is the largest victim-restitution award obtained by
Arizona and the second-largest settlement in the accounting industry
unrelated to the savings-and-loan scandals more than a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   The payment, combined with the $220 million in remaining assets of
the foundation and settlements with other parties in the case, will
allow investors to recover up to 83% of the money they placed with
the fund before its 1999 bankruptcy, Arizona Atty. Gen. Janet
Napolitano said.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen partner Jay Ozer and audit engagement manager Ann
McGrath, both of whom had primary responsibility over Andersen's
audits of the fund, will relinquish their CPA licenses, Napolitano
said. Ozer has retired from the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Though acknowledging that the Baptist Foundation of Arizona was a
"massive fraud," Andersen said in a statement:</TE>
<TE>   "We made a business decision to settle this matter, without
admitting or denying any wrongdoing, to enable our firm to move
forward without the uncertainty and distraction of costly and
protracted litigation in Arizona."</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys involved in the Enron case said settlement of the
Arizona lawsuit represents a strategy by Andersen to try to resolve
its biggest claims quickly to restore confidence in the firm and halt
the flight of clients and staff.</TE>
<TE>   The investigative report completed by an Enron board special
committee determined that Andersen failed to fulfill its audit
responsibilities or raise red flags about the energy trader's
questionable practices.</TE>
<TE>   Pharmaceutical firm Merck &amp; Co. said Friday that it would replace
Andersen with PricewaterhouseCoopers, ending a three-decade
relationship with the accounting firm. Merck said the decision
followed "a rigorous selection process."</TE>
<TE>   Merck was one of two companies in the Dow Jones industrial average
audited by Andersen and accounted for $6.3 million in billings.</TE>
<TE>   In the three-month period ended Thursday, Andersen had lost 32
audit clients and gained five, according to Auditor-Trak, a service
of Atlanta-based Strafford Publications. During the same period a
year ago, Andersen had a net loss of 16 clients.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Cheffers, who operates the AccountingMalpractice.com Web
site, said a trial in the case would have created even more negative
publicity for the firm, hurting morale and its business prospects and
"escalating the problems they are already encountering."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen is close to another settlement, in which it will pay
about $10 million to settle claims arising from its work for
fast-food chain Boston Chicken, according to a source involved in the
case who said the settlement amount is nearly equal to what the
accounting firm would have to spend to defend itself if the matter
went to trial.</TE>
<TE>   "Andersen is going to pay out big chunks of money over the next
few months," said Howard Schilit of the Center for Financial Research
and Analysis in Rockville, Md. "They really want to this behind them
as quickly as they can."</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys involved in the Enron case said they believe that
because the claims were filed in different years, it is unlikely that
the Arizona settlement will eat funds available to settle Enron
claims.</TE>
<TE>   But they also acknowledged that they had not seen Andersen's
insurance policies and have yet to develop a clear understanding of
how much money the company can afford to pay in a settlement and
still remain a viable business.</TE>
<TE>   Among accounting industry settlements, only the $335-million
payment by Ernst &amp; Young over its work for Cendant Corp. is higher,
said Arthur Bowman, editor of trade newsletter Bowman's Accounting
Report, although there is wide consensus that any agreement in the
Enron case would dwarf all others.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has paid large sums previously to settle claims against
its auditing work.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting firm agreed to pay $110 million to settle an
accounting fraud lawsuit involving appliance maker Sunbeam Corp. in
May. A month later, Andersen paid a $7-million fine to settle a
landmark fraud lawsuit over the firm's audits of Houston-based Waste
Management Inc.</TE>
<TE>   In a related development Friday, U.S. District Judge Melinda
Harmon in Houston signaled her desire to see a speedy resolution to
the massive class-action lawsuit against Enron executives and
Andersen by scheduling the trial to start Dec. 1, 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "This means there will be a very expedited discovery schedule that
will move this case along quickly," said Charlie S. Parker, a Houston
attorney who represents New York City pension funds in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Parker noted that in issuing orders for the trial date, Harmon
wrote that the schedule was "firm," emphasizing her intent not to let
the case drag on for years.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Companies Taking Heed of EU</HD>
<DH>Government: Brussels demonstrates its growing clout in a
series of antitrust moves against American firms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN IRITANI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BRUSSELS</DL>
<LD>A spate of tough antitrust actions by European bureaucrats and the
smooth introduction of a regional currency, the euro, have raised the
European Union's profile, reminding U.S. firms that they ignore
Brussels at their own peril.</LD>
<LD>   That message came through loud and clear during the recent visit
by General Electric Co. Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt, whose firm
suffered a humiliating defeat last year when EU regulators squashed
the company's proposed $47-billion acquisition of Honeywell
International Inc.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to appealing that decision, Immelt has moved his
European headquarters from London to Brussels, the seat of the
15-member EU, and appointed Nani Beccalli, an Italian, as the voice
for GE in Europe. GE has one-fourth of its worldwide assets in
Europe.</LD>
<TE>   "This is my first visit to Brussels since becoming chairman of
GE," Immelt said in a speech to European policymakers and business
leaders Jan. 28. "You told my predecessor, Jack Welch, to 'go home'
last June.... Since then, we have become much smarter and moved our
European headquarters to Brussels. Now, if you tell me to go home, I
won't need to get on a plane."</TE>
<TE>   Other U.S. firms are reaching the same conclusion about the
growing influence of the European Union, particularly in economic
matters, said U.S. government officials and business leaders. They
pointed to the explosion in lobbying, with estimates that up to
10,000 people here are involved in the business of influencing
government, compared with just hundreds a decade ago. London remains
the most popular base for U.S. companies, but Brussels boasts 300
European headquarters among its 1,300 American firms.</TE>
<TE>   "What has dawned on U.S. companies more and more is that with the
evolution of European institutions, the power has little by little
moved from the national member states to Brussels," said Elaine
Cruikshanks, chief executive of Hill &amp; Knowlton's Western European
operations. "The balance is always changing, but you have to keep
your eye on the ball on where the power lies."</TE>
<TE>   Though U.S. executives have started taking notice, the overall
understanding about the transition of the EU from a trading
organization to a regional economic and political power remains
woefully inadequate, said Jeremy Davies, a British expatriate who
serves on the advisory board of the European Union Center of
California, a nonprofit educational group.</TE>
<TE>   Davies, a former partner with PricewaterhouseCoopers, said this
knowledge gap is particularly evident here in California, where
business and government leaders have focused their energies on
developing relations across the Pacific. He pointed out that the EU
is already one of California's top trading partners and its leading
foreign investor.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have established investors, it may be much easier to
grow new investment with them rather than chasing some of the Asia
Pacific countries who are more focused on their own development than
investing in the U.S.," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mastering the nuances of the euro world isn't easy. With five
governing institutions--the parliament, council, commission, court of
justice and the court of auditors--it isn't always easy figuring out
exactly whose arm to twist. Just navigating the paperwork is a
formidable task, though official EU documents are translated into the
11 languages spoken within the 370-million-person region.</TE>
<TE>   Under the leadership of former French President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing, EU officials this week launched a yearlong constitutional
convention aimed at clarifying some of the thorny issues of
sovereignty and jurisdiction. Streamlining the bureaucracy and more
clearly defining the division of power among members is even more
important as the EU moves forward with plans to add 10 new members
from Central and Eastern Europe. The relatively trouble-free
introduction of the euro within a 12-member bloc of the EU has
simplified cross-border business, and the increased efficiency has
made the region more competitive with the rest of the world.</TE>
<TE>   EU muscle-flexing in the areas of competition policy and trade,
including long-running disputes over steel and hormone-fed beef, has
received the most attention in the United States. In addition to
quashing the GE deal, European regulators gave a thumbs down to the
WorldCom Inc.-Sprint Corp. merger and Microsoft's proposed takeover
of British cable operator Telewest Communications.</TE>
<TE>   But there are many other areas where the EU is developing regional
policies or standards that have far-reaching implications for foreign
firms operating in Europe, said Rockwell Schnabel, newly appointed
U.S. ambassador to the EU.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, two-thirds of the issues that used to be handled at the
capital level are handled in Brussels," he said. "That is why, when
you drive around, you see all this building going on.... This thing
is exploding and people are moving here because of it."</TE>
<TE>   EU officials wield power in transportation, communication,
environment, food safety and public health. But as Europe has moved
further down the road of regional integration, that sphere of
influence has expanded to include issues such as securities
regulation and Internet privacy.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts are underway to establish an EU legal standard for
patenting computer software, a system for classifying and labeling
chemicals and regulations on insider trading and corporate takeover
rules.</TE>
<TE>   Getting the EU's diverse members to toe the line isn't easy.
Dissatisfied governments have balked at implementing EU directives on
electricity deregulation and food safety. Germany has refused to
support proposed regulations on corporate takeovers unless the EU
provides protection for Volkswagen against a hostile buyer.</TE>
<TE>   Schnabel, a Los Angeles investment banker who served as a trade
official and diplomat in the previous Bush administration, said he is
working with EU authorities to get U.S. firms greater access to the
complex EU decision-making process. Unlike the U.S., the EU does not
have a system requiring lawmakers to open the legislative process to
the general public.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Schnabel said, U.S. firms had little input into the
EU's decision last year to impose new restrictions on products
containing genetically modified organisms. The U.S. claims the new
labeling requirements could cost U.S. firms as much as $4 billion and
violate global trade rules.</TE>
<TE>   "These rules are put on the books and our companies have little
input initially," he said.</TE>
<TE>   S. Linn Williams, former president and chief executive of Edison
Mission Energy's European division, said EU officials are much less
likely than their U.S. counterparts to consult with individual
companies, preferring to get their information through trade
associations. Europe's legal and regulatory process also makes it
difficult for foreign firms to know whether to make their case with
individual governments or the EU.</TE>
<TE>   Though the EU commission is responsible for drafting legislation
and the parliament and council share responsibility for enacting
laws, the issues are usually driven by member nations.</TE>
<TE>   That means real change often comes from the bottom up. California
winemakers are in a dispute with the EU over restrictions on labeling
imported wine. Though French and Italian winemakers can press their
case through their own governments, California winemakers would need
to lobby the U.S. government, key European winemaking governments and
EU bureaucrats, said Williams, a former U.S. trade official.</TE>
<TE>   "On labeling, California winemakers would be very wise to talk to
France, Italy, Spain and Portugal," he said. "If they can work out a
compromise with them, the chances are it will work in Brussels."</TE>

<HD>Manufacturing Activity Finally Starts to Perk Up</HD>
<DH>Economy: Reports on consumer spending and personal income
also provide upbeat data.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. manufacturing activity grew for the first time in a year and a
half, an industry report showed Friday, signaling that the sector may
have emerged from its deep recession.</LD>
<LD>   The Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing index rose to
54.7 last month, a stronger-than-expected increase that marked the
first time since July 2000 that the measure has entered positive
territory.</LD>
<LD>   A reading above 50 signals expansion in the nation's factories.
February's increase marks the fourth consecutive month of growth in
the index, which stood at 49.9 in January. Fourteen out of 20
industries reported growth in the latest report, including producers
of high-tech goods such as computers and electronic components.</LD>
<TE>   "The growth was broad-based ... and new orders were particularly
strong," said Norbert J. Ore, head of ISM's Business Survey
Committee. "I think the first quarter is going to be better than
anyone anticipated."</TE>
<TE>   Separately, government figures Friday showed that U.S. personal
spending rose 0.4% in January, as consumers continued to do their
part.</TE>
<TE>   Steady consumer spending has been a lifeline for the U.S. economy
over the last year, and one of the reasons economists are predicting
the recent recession will prove one of the briefest and mildest on
record.</TE>
<TE>   Personal income also rose 0.4% in January, the biggest rise in six
months.</TE>
<TE>   And in yet another report released Friday, the Commerce Department
said U.S. construction spending rose 1.5% in January. That was the
heftiest increase in a year, thanks to mild weather, continued low
mortgage interest rates and a pop in public construction.</TE>
<TE>   The string of positive economic news unleashed the bulls on Wall
Street as Friday's reports capped a week of upbeat economic news,
including the upward revision of the fourth-quarter growth in gross
domestic product to 1.4%.</TE>
<TE>   That was higher than most analysts expected, prompting some to
revise their own growth forecast upward and to declare the recession
over.</TE>
<TE>   Not all the economic news was rosy, however. The University of
Michigan's consumer sentiment index dropped to 90.7 for the month
from 93 in January, due in part to consumers' fears about the stock
market, the veracity of corporate earnings and the safety of their
retirement nest eggs in the wake of the Enron scandal.</TE>
<TE>   But what consumers say and what they do are often quite different,
said Keitaro Matsuda, senior vice president of economic research at
Union Bank of California. He noted that consumers have continued to
ring up credit card debt, snap up new cars and purchase new housing
despite the economic downturn. Consumer spending is about two-thirds
of the economy and strong sales have fueled the growth.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers say they're worried about the future, but they keep
spending money," Matsuda said. "Actions speak much louder than
words."</TE>
<TE>   He and other economists pointed to the ISM index as the most
significant of the batch of economic reports released Friday. They
said the record inventory liquidation seen throughout corporate
America in late 2001 has companies scurrying to boost production to
rebuild stockpiles.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a great big fire sale in the fourth quarter ... but
demand didn't turn out to be as bad as everyone had feared," said
Nancy Sidhu, senior economist with the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corp. "Now orders have gone up fairly dramatically, so
companies are beginning to scramble."</TE>
<TE>   The new orders component of the ISM index rocketed to 62.8, up
from 55.3 in January. The big question for the manufacturing sector,
analysts said, is whether that momentum can be sustained beyond this
temporary restocking windfall. Only when companies resume purchasing
computers and other capital goods will the manufacturing recovery be
complete, says economist John Mitchell of U.S. Bancorp in Portland,
Ore.</TE>
<TE>   "Given all the excess [factory] capacity and continued weak
corporate earnings, the upturn in business spending may be slow in
coming," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, analysts said hiring remains weak in the nation's
factories, and is not likely to increase for some time. Employment is
a lagging indicator that most economists expect to keep increasing
even as the economy recovers.</TE>
<TE>   That's because companies aren't likely to hire new workers until
they are sure that the rebound is for real. Instead, they'll give
more hours to workers already on the payroll, many of whom have seen
their hours and overtime slashed during the downturn.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's manufacturing sector went into recession six months
before the rest of the economy and has shed more than 1.5 million
jobs, more than any other sector. California alone lost nearly
134,000 factory jobs last year.</TE>
<TE>   But despite a continued weak hiring picture and no strong surge in
business investment on the horizon, analysts said the worst probably
is over for the nation's manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   The manufacturing recovery "will still be choppy ... but we've
moved into an expansion mode," said David Littmann, chief economist
with Comerica Bank in Detroit.</TE>

<HD>State Farm Records Its Largest Loss Ever</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Increases in homeowner and auto claims and
slump in investment returns lead to a $5-billion shortfall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. lost a record $5 billion
last year as the company was pummeled by huge increases in homeowner
and auto claims as well as declines in investment returns, company
officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The massive loss on revenue of $40 billion was the insurer's
largest ever and could lead to additional premium increases
nationwide, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   "This does not auger well for other companies in the same
marketplace," said Martin Weiss, chairman of independent rating firm
Weiss Ratings Inc. Insurers "are going to be jacking up prices and
trying to restore profitability."</LD>
<TE>   In 2000, State Farm had a profit of $400 million.</TE>
<TE>   Although nearly untouched by the world's largest insurance
disaster--the World Trade Center attacks Sept. 11--State Farm lost
$317 million last year to Midwest windstorms, which caused  the
fifth-largest catastrophe loss in the insurer's history.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, water damage claims, prompted largely by mold
concerns, cost its Texas subsidiary $625 million in capital reserves
last year, State Farm spokesman Dick Luedke said. Higher medical,
repair and fraud costs also contributed to big increases in the
severity of auto claims, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Insurers normally offset underwriting losses by selling profitable
investments--usually stocks and bonds purchased with policyholders'
unused premiums. But investment returns plunged last year. Instead of
the $3.4 billion in realized capital gains the insurer reported in
2000, Bloomington, Ill.-based State Farm had only $300 million in
gains.</TE>
<TE>   State Farm, the nation's largest auto and homeowner insurer, also
suffered from new accounting rules that for the first time forced
insurers to recognize losses in investments they had not yet sold.
The insurer had $2.8 billion in such unrealized losses.</TE>
<TE>   "You had a convergence of a bad stock market and a negative cycle
for the insurance business," Weiss said. "Instead of one offsetting
the other, they had losses on both sides."</TE>
<TE>   All the red ink caused State Farm's net worth to drop $5.7 billion
to $38 billion. Similar but smaller capital losses at Farmers
Insurance Group led Standard &amp; Poor's to downgrade the Los
Angeles-based insurer's credit rating this month. Meanwhile, A.M.
Best cut its financial strength rating of State Farm's California
subsidiary, State Farm General Insurance Co., because of losses in
the insurer's homeowners' line.</TE>
<TE>   The State Farm parent company probably will face downgrades
because of its latest losses, but analysts said the company remains
one of the strongest homeowner and auto insurers in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   The losses are "nothing to sneeze at, but they had a sizable
cushion to absorb them," said A.M. Best analyst Anthony Diodato.</TE>
<TE>   That cushion is the envy of State Farm's competitors, which gripe
that the insurer's reluctance to raise rates in the last year has
prevented rivals from increasing theirs as much as they would like.
Investor Warren Buffett complained last year about State Farm's
willingness to suffer big losses, saying it put rivals such as
Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s Geico Corp. at a disadvantage.</TE>
<TE>   "State Farm still has a lot of excess capital," said A.M. Best
financial analyst Richard Attanasio. "They can lose more than some of
their competitors."</TE>
<TE>   For example, Allstate Corp., State Farm's next-largest rival and
the nation's biggest publicly traded insurer, has capital reserves of
$13 billion--and considerable pressure from shareholders to maintain
profitability, analysts said. By contrast, State Farm is a mutual
company owned by its policyholders. Instead of showing a profit,
State Farm's goal typically is to break even, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   State Farm can't continue to lose money indefinitely, however.</TE>
<TE>   "State Farm is going to have to raise its rates eventually to
recoup, or at least get back to a steady state," said Don Watson,
director of Standard &amp; Poor's insurance ratings group. If State Farm
does increase premiums substantially, Watson predicted, other
insurers will follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't be surprised to see auto and homeowners' rates across
the board nationally increase by 7% to 9% this year," Watson said.</TE>
<TE>   State Farm already has received approval for two 6.9% increases in
homeowner insurance premiums in California and recently requested an
additional 6.7% boost. Allstate is waiting for regulatory approval of
a 22.3% homeowners premium increase, while Farmers has requested a
series of five increases ranging from 5% to 6.9%.</TE>

<HD>Economy Fuels Stocks</HD>
<DH>Market Zooms on New Data Pointing to a Solid Recovery</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks soared Friday as "Enronitis" worries faded on the heels of
more evidence that the economy is back on a solid growth track.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 262.73 points, or 2.6%, to
10,368.86, its highest close since Aug. 27.</LD>
<LD>   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite, which has been hammered
in recent weeks, rebounded 71.25 points, or 4.1%, to 1,802.74. It was
Nasdaq's biggest one-day gain since Dec. 5, and was led by
semiconductor stocks.</LD>
<TE>   The blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 2.3%, also the
biggest gain since Dec. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Market pros said fresh data Friday on the manufacturing sector and
on consumer spending ended the debate for many investors on whether
the economy is in recovery mode after last year's slump.</TE>
<TE>   "Today everyone is a believer that the economic recovery is real,"
said Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset
Management in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Despite increasing signs this year that economic activity was
rebounding, Wall Street's powerful fourth-quarter rally gave way to
heavy profit-taking in many stocks in January and February.</TE>
<TE>   The market has been under pressure in part because of investors'
concerns that the failures of Enron Corp. and Global Crossing Ltd.
could be followed by many more corporate collapses tied to illegal or
improper accounting.</TE>
<TE>   But those fears took a back seat Friday to excitement about a turn
in the economy that could revitalize corporate earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "Recovery is the future. Enron is the past," said Al Goldman,
veteran market strategist at brokerage A.G. Edwards in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Though some analysts say that view may be underestimating the
potential for more firms to be caught in accounting controversies,
buyers were aggressive Friday. And unlike in recent sessions, when
stocks rallied early in the day only to fade in the afternoon,
Friday's surge gained steam in the final half hour of trading.</TE>
<TE>   Beaten-down tech shares led the rally. Intel surged $2.43 to
$30.98 and the SOX semiconductor stock index leaped 11%. Other tech
winners included IBM, up $4.90 to $103.02, and Veritas Software, up
$3.71 to $39.20.</TE>
<TE>   Many consumer-related stocks were strong, including Procter &amp;
Gamble, up $2.76 to $87.55, and Target, up $1.25 to $43.15. Home
builders' shares also were hot.</TE>
<TE>   Trading was active, but far from record levels. Likewise, market
breadth--the ratio of rising stocks to falling stocks--wasn't as
strong as the gains in key indexes might imply. Winners topped losers
by 22 to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange and by 23 to 12 on Nasdaq.
On dramatic turnaround days on Wall Street, winners often outnumber
losers by 3 to 1 or 4 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   With Friday's gains the Nasdaq index was up 4.5% for the
week--snapping a four-week losing streak--while the S&amp;P 500 rose 3.9%
and the Dow was up 4%.</TE>
<TE>   Still, among major indexes only the Dow is in positive territory
this year, with a gain of 3.5% since Dec. 31. The Nasdaq is down 7.6%
and the S&amp;P index is off 1.4%.</TE>
<TE>   The rally's ability to sustain itself in the first few days of
next week will be a key test, some experts said. If buyers continue
to pour back into the market, a rebound could become self-fulfilling
by pulling in more investors who have been sidelined this year.</TE>
<TE>   Buying by "short sellers" also could help power the market higher.
With near-record levels of stocks sold short--meaning borrowed and
sold in a bet on declining prices--a rising market would force more
short sellers to buy stocks to close out their bets.</TE>
<TE>   But late Friday, software giant Oracle provided a reminder that
companies' struggles aren't over: The firm warned that its earnings
in the quarter just ended will be below expectations. Oracle shares,
down 63 cents to $15.99 in regular trading, fell to $14.71 after
hours.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, some market pros say investors now have more reason to be
bullish than bearish, with the economy seemingly on a sure growth
track while short-term interest rates remain at 40-year lows.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Keon, investment strategist at Prudential Securities in New
York, said the average price-to-earnings ratio of blue-chip stocks is
about 20 based on estimated operating earnings for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Though investors still may be nervous about earnings estimates
given accounting concerns, Keon said the market isn't overvalued, and
is more appealing than many alternatives, such as money-market funds
paying annualized yields of less than 1.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Long-term interest rates could pose a challenge for Wall Street,
however, some analysts warn.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury bond yields surged Friday. Bond investors' fear is that a
robust recovery could drive long-term yields sharply higher. The
10-year T-note yield rose to 4.98% Friday from 4.88% Thursday.</TE>

<HD>File-Sharing Firms Feud Over Users</HD>
<DH>Internet: Kazaa.com recruits from Morpheus' network after
glitch prevents some from using the service.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A range war has broken out in the wild, wild West of online
file-swapping, with two of the most popular--and arguably
illegal--services battling publicly over users.</LD>
<LD>   The battle pits StreamCast Networks' Morpheus, the leading
file-sharing system, against Sharman Networks' Kazaa.com, No. 2 but
gaining. Once joined by a common software, they're now in
splitsville, with Kazaa.com trying to grab Morpheus' users before the
latter runs off to another network.</LD>
<LD>   Laced with intrigue and finger-pointing, the dispute comes as both
services are trying to defend themselves against a copyright
infringement lawsuit by the music and movie industries. A preliminary
hearing in the case is scheduled Monday in federal court in Los
Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   At stake is the devotion of millions of consumers who use Morpheus
and Kazaa.com to download MP3s, movies, software and other files  for
free.</TE>
<TE>   Users have downloaded versions of Morpheus' software more than 53
million times from CNet's Downloads.com Web site, while Kazaa.com's
software has been downloaded almost 39 million times, according to
Downloads.com.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute bubbled to the surface after Morpheus' network crashed
Tuesday. Morpheus' users couldn't connect to the FastTrack network
that united Morpheus, Kazaa.com and a third file-sharing service,
Grokster Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Griffin, chief executive of Nashville-based StreamCast, said
the company supplying the FastTrack software--Kazaa, a Dutch firm and
former owner of Kazaa.com--made a new version available to Sharman,
which is based in Australia, and Grokster, which is based in the West
Indies, but not to Morpheus.</TE>
<TE>   Although Morpheus' users didn't lose their connection to Kazaa.com
and Grokster immediately, they found themselves cut off from the
other services and each other Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Broes, chief executive of the Vidius Inc. Internet security
firm and an expert on peer-to-peer networks, speculated that
computers running the new version of the FastTrack software simply
refuse to connect to computers running the old version.</TE>
<TE>   That refusal would have a trickle-down effect, effectively
preventing Morpheus' users with the old software from forming their
own network, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after Morpheus crashed, Kazaa.com started trying to
convert Morpheus' users. On Friday, Sharman announced the "Kazaa
media desktop migration tool" to let Morpheus' users transfer their
user name and settings to Kazaa.com.</TE>
<TE>   "Many users have already transferred from Morpheus to Kazaa,"
Chief Executive Nicola Hemming said in a news release, in part
because "they have quickly realized that Kazaa media desktop gives
them all Morpheus did and much more."</TE>
<TE>   Kazaa.com and Morpheus are supported by advertising revenue, which
rises or falls with the number of users and the amount of time they
spend on the services. And both rely on the "network effect": the
more people who run their software, the more files there are to
download and the more attractive they become to new users.</TE>
<TE>   Later on Friday, Morpheus was expected to release a new version of
the software that would connect its users to Gnutella, a rival
file-sharing network.</TE>
<TE>   Created three years ago by software engineers at an AOL Time
Warner Inc. affiliate, the Gnutella approach has fewer adherents
because it's harder to use and much slower than the FastTrack-based
systems.</TE>
<TE>   Griffin said Morpheus had planned to let users connect to the
millions of file-sharing computers on both FastTrack and Gnutella.
"Our goal was to let Morpheus be a unification tool," he said. "It
would appear to me that someone doesn't like that objective."</TE>
<TE>   Another possibility is that the separation of U.S.-based Morpheus
may give overseas-based Kazaa.com and Grokster some legal advantage
in the music and movie industries' lawsuit, which names all three as
defendants.</TE>
<TE>   Grokster executives couldn't be reached, but Kelly Larabee, a
spokeswoman for Kazaa.com, said her company had nothing to do with
Morpheus' network problems.</TE>
<TE>   She added, "We have no reason to have them go away. We'd rather
them stay on FastTrack."</TE>
<TE>   If they left, all their shared files would be lost to Kazaa.com
and Grokster users, making those services less attractive.</TE>
<TE>   But analyst P.J. McNealy said it wouldn't matter in the long run
because none of the services were likely to survive the copyright
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "I think all these folks are playing in a temporary world because
they're all building their businesses on someone else's intellectual
property. The nuances aren't that important," McNealy said.</TE>
<TE>   "They've all been sued. And none of the file-sharing services have
won because the courts have come down on the side of intellectual
property."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Morpheus and Kazaa.com have argued that they aren't
violating copyright law because there are many legitimate uses for a
file-sharing network. Griffin also argues that Morpheus has no
control over the network, which he said sustains itself--unless it's
under attack.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Yahoo Inc. shares rose 15% after an analyst said sales of advertising
this quarter on the most-used network of Web sites would be higher
than some forecasts.</LD>
<LD>   Yahoo climbed $2.15 to $16.61.</LD>
<LD>   Sales of advertising on Yahoo's Web sites are likely to rise as
the U.S. economy recovers and as Yahoo takes advertising customers
from Internet sites that have failed, SoundView Technology Group
analyst Jordan Rohan said. Rohan raised his sales estimate for 2002
to $793 million from $778 million. Yahoo had forecast 2002 sales of
$750 million to $800 million, up from $717.4 million in 2001.</LD>

<HD>SCE Wins $1.8 Billion in Financing to Repay Debts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California Edison said it secured $1.8 billion in financing
to repay most of its $5.5 billion in electricity-related debts as
scheduled Friday, a move that won the Rosemead utility a boost in its
credit rating.</LD>
<LD>   SCE's credit still is in junk territory despite the increase by
Moody's Investors Service, which raised SCE's first mortgage bonds to
Ba2 from B3 and upgraded SCE's senior unsecured debt to Ba3 from
Caa2. Moody's upgraded the senior debt of SCE parent Edison
International to B3 from Caa3.</LD>
<LD>   SCE said it closed Friday on a $1.6-billion loan from a group led
by J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney
and sold $200 million in pollution control bonds. Combined with cash
on hand accumulated because of electricity rates that are higher than
current costs, this allowed the utility to pay off $4.8 billion in
power debts and other defaults that piled up during the state's
electricity crisis.</LD>
<TE>   The remaining amount will be repaid during the next few months,
SCE said.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy-law
protection, but SCE pursued a settlement--first with Gov. Gray Davis
and the state Legislature and then through state regulators. The
Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco consumer group, is fighting
the settlement in court.</TE>
<TE>   "This major step in returning Southern California Edison to
financial health will hasten the state's exit from the power purchase
business," Davis said. "That is clearly in the best interests of all
consumers and our state's economy."</TE>

<HD>Skilling Says Congress Is Acting as 'Judge and Jury'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Former Enron Corp. Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling fired back
Friday at congressional leaders who have questioned his honesty and
integrity.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee,
Skilling accused lawmakers of using taxpayer money to subsidize a
public relations effort at his expense.</LD>
<LD>   "It has become clear ... that your subcommittee's inquiry has
devolved from an honorable quest for the truth into a media circus in
which members of Congress throw around half-truths and distortions at
will," Skilling wrote.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, congressional committee leaders, including Rep. W.J.
"Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) and James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), said
Skilling's recent testimony about his role in Enron's collapse
conflicts with the recollections of other Enron employees, raising
serious questions about the accuracy of Skilling's testimony.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview on CNN's "Larry King Live" that aired Friday
night, Skilling said, "It's an election year, and during an election
year, I guess you would expect something like that to happen, but I
think that Congress is acting as judge and jury."</TE>
<TE>   During his first television interview since Enron's Dec. 2
bankruptcy, Skilling defended his former boss, saying he did not
believe former Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay was aware of any
accounting problems or improprieties at the company.</TE>
<TE>   Until Aug. 14--the date Skilling resigned--"I can't believe that
Ken would have had any knowledge of an issue with the accounting
statements," Skilling said.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling, who has insisted he didn't know of any problems,
declined to point the finger at former Chief Financial Officer Andrew
S. Fastow, who ran and profited from the off-the-books partnerships
that led to Enron's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "Andy is a very bright, very energetic person," Skilling said.
"And just in the same way that I sure hope people aren't pointing
accusing fingers at me, I'm going to wait and see how the facts come
out before I want to start pointing fingers at anybody else."</TE>

<HD>China Gets to Meet 'Friends'</HD>
<DH>Entertainment:  News Corp.'s new local-language channel
will carry Mandarin version of the sitcom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Move over Ross and Rachel, here come Tang Jinsong and Su Feifei.</LD>
<LD>   News Corp. is hoping a Mandarin version of the hit U.S. sitcom
"Friends" will win it fans when it launches a long-coveted
local-language channel in China in the next few weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Called "Joyful Youth," the newly filmed program will be among a
host of locally produced talk shows, dramas and game shows that News
Corp.'s Hong Kong-based unit Star Group will offer  1 million cable
TV viewers in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong.</LD>
<TE>   The new channel--called Xingkong Weishi, or Star Satellite
TV--marks News Corp. chief Rupert Murdoch's biggest victory to date
in his long and sometimes tumultuous courtship of China and its
massive but tightly restricted media market.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, China gave permission to Xingkong, Hong Kong-based
Phoenix Satellite TV and AOL Time Warner's China Entertainment TV
(CETV) permission for cable distribution in Guangdong. Phoenix is 38%
owned by News Corp.</TE>
<TE>   That marked the first time foreign channels were given legal
access to ordinary Chinese homes. News Corp. and other foreign
broadcasters have been restricted for decades to hotels rated three
stars or more and residence compounds approved for foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   "The new channel is the most important initiative we have going on
at this time" in China, said News Corp. broadcasting executive Jamie
Davis, who is heading the channel.</TE>
<TE>   Now comes the hard part. Building on lessons Star learned in
India, Davis is banking on local language programming to win viewers
for what it hopes will in the long term become a national channel
reaching China's 100 million homes with cable TV. Never mind that
Star's new channel will carry Mandarin language programming in a
mostly Cantonese-speaking province.</TE>
<TE>   "In order to really capture the hearts of the audience here, you
must be local. And that means to speak the local language," said
Davis, a 35-year-old Chicago native.</TE>
<TE>   Xingkong Weishi will be limited at first to airing in the Pearl
River Delta region under the terms of its agreement with China, which
also call for News Corp. to make an English channel of state
broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) available in Los Angeles
and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   But News Corp. and AOL hope their landing rights will be expanded
beyond Guangdong.</TE>
<TE>   The foreign firms hope last year's agreement giving them access in
Guangdong was a signal that Beijing is willing to relax its grip on
China's airwaves.</TE>

<HD>Shares of Knight Trading Fall After Web Postings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Knight Trading Group Inc.'s shares tumbled 14% Friday after postings
on Internet message boards said one of the firm's traders had been
arrested. The company said that no arrest took place and that it was
under investigation by neither the Securities and Exchange Commission
nor the FBI.</LD>
<LD>   One individual posted messages on message boards operated by Yahoo
Inc. and Raging Bull at about 1:30 p.m. New York time, Knight said in
a statement on its Web site.</LD>
<LD>   The postings are "totally untrue," Knight spokeswoman Margaret
Wyrwas said.</LD>
<TE>   Knight, based in Jersey City, N.J., and the biggest market maker
on the Nasdaq Stock Market, said it was working with Yahoo and Raging
Bull to remove the messages. The company said it was working
"throughout the marketplace to quash further distribution of this
false information."</TE>
<TE>   Knight stock plunged $1.11 to $6.85 in Nasdaq trading, its lowest
level since November 1998. More than 12.5 million shares changed
hands, about 12 times the three-month daily average for the stock.</TE>
<TE>   CIBC World Markets Kenneth Worthington downgraded Knight's stock
Friday to "hold" from "buy." Worthington said he had been planning to
downgrade the stock because he didn't see "a catalyst" for the
company's earnings to improve. He said his downgrade wasn't a result
of the rumor.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Knight agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle regulatory
charges that it repeatedly violated trading rules. The firm neither
admitted nor denied any wrongdoing. Among the shortcomings cited in
the settlement order were inadequate supervisory procedures at the
firm.</TE>

<HD>Oil Prices Hit 4-Month High Amid Supply Curbs</HD>
<DH>Energy: OPEC says it will maintain its curbs on output for
the rest of the year, despite signs of increasing demand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. oil prices shot to a four-month high Friday as OPEC producers
said they would keep the lid on supply for the rest of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Near-term crude futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped
66 cents to $22.40 a barrel, its highest level since mid-October and
a gain of more than 25% in the last six weeks. Gasoline prices rose
in tandem, rising for the eighth week in a row and pushing their
year-to-date increase to 35%.</LD>
<LD>   The latest push came after OPEC Secretary-General Ali Rodriguez
said he saw the cartel maintaining stringent output curbs for the
rest of the year, and that OPEC wanted prices at least 10% above
current levels.</LD>
<TE>   OPEC has joined with five other leading exporters to pledge supply
cuts of nearly 2 million barrels a day this year, a move that is
cutting into supplies built up during last year's economic slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   "This market will go into overdrive if they don't raise production
in the second half of the year," said Paul Horsnell of J.P. Morgan.</TE>
<TE>   Tight OPEC supply curbs pushed U.S. crude prices to post-Persian
Gulf War highs of more than $37 a barrel in 2000, before a downturn
in demand last year sent prices crashing back to less than $17 a
barrel.</TE>
<TE>   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries already has
committed to keep supply curbs for the first half of this year, and
will seek to persuade Russia--which had pledged to cut output for the
first quarter--to join for the full six months.</TE>
<TE>   The cartel is particularly keen to stop supplies building during
the second quarter after winter heating fuel consumption peaks and
before driving demand picks up during the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Oil prices already were heading up on news that the U.S. economy
grew faster than first thought in the fourth quarter, reinforcing
recent signs that fuel demand is emerging from the doldrums.</TE>
<TE>   Gasoline consumption in the last month has averaged 8.4 million
barrels a day, 2.5% above last year, bolstered by heavy sales of
gas-guzzling sport-utility vehicles, warm winter weather and lower
prices at the pump.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. refiners also have reduced supply to counter weak prices. The
Energy Information Administration on Wednesday showed total U.S. oil
inventories falling 0.6% last week to 1 billion barrels.</TE>
<TE>   Additional price gains have come from nagging worries about
possible disruption to supply from key Middle East producer Iraq,
which accounts for about 5% of global oil exports. Traders fear
Iraq--branded as part of a global "axis of evil" by President
Bush--could become the next target of U.S. reprisals for terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, gasoline prices in Southern California rose for the
eighth consecutive week as crude prices rose and refineries began
preparing reformulated fuel for the summer, according to a survey
released Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Since Jan. 1, average gas prices in the Los Angeles-Long Beach
area have climbed 34 cents to $1.34 a gallon, the Automobile Club of
Southern California said.</TE>
<TE>   The surplus created by weak consumer demand that helped send
gasoline prices down to about 99 cents a gallon in December has
largely vanished as refineries slowed production.</TE>

<HD>FAA Picks El Toro as Site for Air Marshals</HD>
<DH>9/11: The base will be regional headquarters for security
force but won't be training facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As part of a national push to increase airline security, the closed
El Toro Marine Corps Air Station has been selected as the regional
headquarters for Southern California-based air marshals, Federal
Aviation Administration officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The Transportation Security Administration--formed after Sept.
11--was considering El Toro as a site for a West Coast air marshals'
training academy, but transportation officials said the base has been
rejected.</LD>
<LD>   "Whether El Toro is used as a training facility or a regional
headquarters for the sky marshals, we're happy," said Gary Simon,
executive director of the El Toro Local Redevelopment Agency.</LD>
<TE>   "In either event, reusing El Toro to support national security is
a wonderful thing," Simon said. "That's what closed military bases
are good for."</TE>
<TE>   How the headquarters would affect plans for a park or airport at
the site was unclear.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government has been in a hurry-up mode to hire and
train hundreds of sky marshals. The number of air marshals patrolling
commercial flights had dwindled from a high of 2,000 to 32 at the
time of the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   According to a Dec. 31 memo from the FAA to the Department of the
Navy, which owns the base, a three-story building once used as a
flight simulator for Marines will be used as an administrative
headquarters for the air marshal program.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI may also occupy a portion of the building for
administrative purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said the county is working on a long-term lease that would
permit the FAA to use the facility at no cost. Details are still
being worked out.</TE>
<TE>   "I could see a scenario where a portion of the base remains in the
federal government's hands for national security purposes," Simon
said.</TE>
<TE>   Such a deal, he said, might go on indefinitely and regardless of
the ultimate use of the base.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said an air-marshal field office at El Toro would not
interfere with the county's ongoing effort to lease office space at
the base, an interim use that helps defray the county's operating
costs there. "The building they are using isn't something that was in
our plans," Simon said. "First of all, it has no windows."</TE>
<TE>   The number of air marshals who would use the three-story building
is confidential, said Jerry Snyder, an FAA spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "The air marshals would use El Toro as a field office, where they
could work on a computer and do briefings and such," Snyder said.</TE>
<TE>   The air marshal program has a training site in Atlantic City, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   The Transportation Security Agency, which is taking over the air
marshals program from the FAA, would not say why El Toro was
scratched as a West Coast training site.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a number of facilities that are equal or better for our
needs than El Toro," a senior official with the agency said.</TE>

<HD>Bill Links Transit Funds to El Toro Airport</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Measure would withhold transportation money from
any Southern California county that doesn't handle its share of air
passengers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A powerful Democratic assemblyman from the South Bay wants the state
Legislature to approve a bill that would withhold transportation
money from any Southern California county that doesn't provide enough
airport space.</LD>
<LD>   The bill doesn't mention Orange County specifically but would
apply if the county doesn't build an airport at the closed El Toro
Marine base to handle nearly 30-million passengers a year by 2025. It
was introduced as county voters prepare to decide Tuesday whether to
scuttle plans for an airport and rezone El Toro for a large park.</LD>
<LD>   Assemblyman George Nakano (D-Torrance), who also chairs the
Assembly Democratic caucus, introduced the bill Feb. 21--one day
before the deadline for submitting bills for this legislative
session.</LD>
<TE>   The threshold for El Toro passengers comes from a 25-year forecast
for regional airport growth approved last year by the Southern
California Assn. of Governments. John Wayne Airport was set at
8.4-million passengers a year--its current limit, which county
supervisors hope to boost to 9.8 million in the next 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   The SCAG plan also capped Los Angeles International Airport at 78
million, a move made after intense lobbying by Los Angeles and state
representatives to shift airport growth to outlying areas. The
forecast for Ontario International Airport, which handled about
6.5-million passengers last year and is owned by Los Angeles, was 30
million.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going after Orange County, but it's high time someone
other than the residents of El Segundo, Manhattan Beach and Hermosa
Beach bear the burden for planes flying over their heads" from LAX,
said Becky Ames, Nakano's chief of staff. "Southern California has
put together a plan and it should be followed."</TE>
<TE>   If approved, the bill would cut off funds approved through the
state every two years for certain transportation projects. Last year,
a total of $340 million was available statewide.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the Orange County Transportation Authority has asked
for $18 million, including $8 million to add an auxiliary lane on the
westbound Riverside Freeway, $5 million for a new Metrolink station
in Yorba Linda, $3 million to expand parking at the Fullerton
Metrolink station and $2 million in rail improvements in Placentia.
The California Transportation Commission will vote on the request
next month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sad commentary to mix transportation funds with the
airport in a desperate act to thwart the will of the people here in
Orange County," said Susan Withrow, an OCTA board member and
councilwoman in Mission Viejo, which opposes the new airport.</TE>
<TE>   El Segundo Mayor Mike Gordon, who pushed for the bill--designated
AB2333--said the SCAG plan was approved by city and county
representatives across Southern California except for two council
members from south Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "It is critical that Orange County be a full player in meeting
their aviation demand for Southern California," he said. "If they
don't, there should be consequences."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Chuck Smith, an El Toro airport supporter and an OCTA
board member, said he was briefed on the bill in his role as a member
of the Southern California Regional Airport Authority. The bill
allows the authority to review airports and counties for compliance
with the SCAG forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   Because of his multiple roles, Smith said he doesn't support the
bill--but he said he won't oppose it either. He has long argued that
Orange County should handle more of the estimated 7 million local
passengers a year who use LAX or Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   ''The problem is that this kind of [sanction] is going to happen,
and it's going to happen at the federal level too,'' Smith said.
"Citizens of Orange County have to wake up that we have to do these
kinds of things, like build a new airport. It's not this, 'I've got
mine, so stay out of my area' kind of thing."</TE>
<TE>   Nakano said as much in October 1999, when he attended an Assembly
transportation committee hearing in Santa Ana organized by
Assemblyman Lou Correa (D-Santa Ana), who supports the new airport.
"You can't just cram everything into LAX," Nakano said at the
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The Assembly's involvement signaled a growing trend in Southern
California to view airport growth--and opposition to it--in terms of
regional needs, not just through a local community.</TE>

<LD>It has been eight years since the Northridge earthquake devastated
CSUN, and campus officials hope $12 million in new construction
projects will wrap up the last of quake-related repairs by fall.</LD>
<LD>   Major roads will be resurfaced, open spaces will be restored to
their natural green state and remaining portable classrooms will be
removed as part of the finishing touches of Cal State Northridge's
$408-million earthquake recovery, most of it paid with funds from the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.</LD>
<LD>   "In terms of campus appearance and inconvenience, it will look
like more construction is being done--it won't look like it is
waning," said campus architect Deborah Wylie. "But when it's done,
the campus will have a brightened, enhanced appearance."</LD>
<TE>   As part of the projects, six 11-foot-high brick signs bearing
CSUN's name will be installed at intersections along Nordhoff Street
and a soccer field will be added to the east side of campus. Soccer
players currently use the football field at North Campus Stadium,
which is soon to be torn down.</TE>
<TE>   With all classes back in permanent buildings, the remaining
portable classrooms, as well as the white "domes" that once housed
the library and the admissions and records department, will be
removed. Several lawns on which the temporary buildings were
constructed will get new grass, trees and lighting.</TE>
<TE>   To accommodate paving crews, traffic on portions of Lindley
Avenue, Plummer Street and Etiwanda Avenue will be limited to one way
from May until possibly October. Landscaped medians will be added and
some campus streets will get curbs and gutters for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   But even after these projects are finished, students and
professors won't get a respite from the construction sights and
sounds that have plagued the campus for so many years. Work on
several major buildings and a parking structure is to continue
through 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Construction began in January of four swimming pools next to the
Center of Achievement for the Physically Disabled, where CSUN
students provide low-cost exercise therapy for 400 disabled people.</TE>
<TE>   The new Abbott and Linda Brown Western Center for Adaptive Aquatic
Therapy will include a heated pool with underwater treadmills, a
large whirlpool spa, a cool water pool for heat-sensitive people and
the West Coast's first movable-floor pool, which will be able to
change depth to accommodate wheelchair-users.</TE>
<TE>   Once the $4.5-million facility opens, the center will be able to
serve twice as many people.</TE>
<TE>   "It will probably be the model for the nation as to what a
university can do for the community," Director Sam Britten said.</TE>
<TE>   The Browns contributed $2 million, $1 million came from the
federal government and the remainder is being raised through private
donations.</TE>
<TE>   In May, construction is to begin on the $7.8-million Sierra
Center, which will have two floors for food services as well as
offices for University Corp., which manages commercial ventures on
campus.</TE>
<TE>   In June, work is to start on a new $14-million parking structure
with nearly 1,400 spaces that will be funded with parking permit
fees. Unlike the parking structure that collapsed in the Northridge
earthquake, this one will be made with concrete poured on site, not
precast concrete walls. Officials say the move should make the
structure safer.</TE>
<TE>   In late summer, a $15-million renovation of the student union
building is to begin. Funding will come from student fee increases of
$35 a semester.</TE>
<TE>   And if the Los Angeles Unified School District board gives its
approval next month, construction of a $35-million, 870-student
academy for high school students interested in pursuing teaching
careers will start in August.</TE>

<HD>Hells Angel Under House Arrest Seeks to Attend Mother's
Funeral</HD>
<DH>Court: George Christie Jr. and his jailed son, both of whom
are charged with racketeering, ask a judge to allow them to be
present at services.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Indicted Hells Angels leader George Christie Jr. and his son are
pleading for court permission to attend the funeral of Christie's
mother, who died Thursday from complications of pancreatic cancer.</LD>
<LD>   The 54-year-old Christie remains under house arrest a year after
being indicted on racketeering charges for allegedly running a
narcotics ring that sold drugs to teenagers.</LD>
<LD>   Under the terms of his release, Christie cannot leave his Ventura
residence except to make court appearances.</LD>
<TE>   For a while, 82-year-old Georgia Christie, who lived in Ventura,
visited her son at his home, but when her condition deteriorated last
month their visits stopped.</TE>
<TE>   Advised that her death was imminent, Christie obtained an
emergency court order Thursday and was allowed to go to her bedside.
She died an hour after he arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Now, amid planning funeral arrangements, Christie says he and his
25-year-old son, who remains jailed on the same charges, are seeking
permission to attend the services.</TE>
<TE>   "I would hope that the court would grant all of our family members
permission to attend the funeral and I have a feeling they are going
to," Christie said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   His son appeared in Ventura County Superior Court on Friday
afternoon and made a request for a 24-hour furlough from jail, which
prosecutors opposed.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin Suh argued that George Christie III is
being held on serious charges in lieu of $1-million bail.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Kevin McGee agreed that it would not be appropriate to
release Christie on his own recognizance to attend the service. But
McGee expressed sympathy for the situation and gave the defense two
days to come up with an alternative proposal, such as electronic
monitoring.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the elder Christie said his lawyer is trying to
negotiate modifications to his house arrest to attend the funeral.</TE>
<TE>   "The district attorney's office has a job to do and I understand
that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is something I have to deal with in order to put my mother to
rest."</TE>
<TE>   Christie, his ex-wife, their son and several members of the
Ventura chapter of the Hells Angels motorcycle club were indicted
last year on narcotics charges.</TE>
<TE>   Christie spent 11 months behind bars before posting a $1-million
bond in early January. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud,
tax evasion, selling drugs to minors and the use of a street gang in
a criminal conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   No trial date has been set.</TE>

<HD>Election Oversight Top Issue in Clerk-Recorder Race</HD>
<DH>Vote: In a crowded, six-candidate field, a consensus
emerges to discard punch-card ballots and replace them with a more
modern, electronic method.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With six candidates, the race for Ventura County clerk and recorder
has the biggest field on Tuesday's local ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The job's principal duties include issuing marriage licenses and
recording births, deaths and property transactions.</LD>
<LD>   But the clerk's biggest responsibility is to monitor elections, a
highly-sensitive task that gained new prominence after the 2000
Florida election debacle.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, most candidates are campaigning to modernize Ventura
County's election system, which still relies on punch cards.</TE>
<TE>   If approved Tuesday, a California bond measure could give counties
a $3-to-$1 match to pay for new computerized voting machines.</TE>
<TE>   While the county's punch-card system has one of the lower error
rates in the state, candidates still believe it would be worthwhile
to modernize to a touch-screen system. To update Ventura County's
system could cost upwards of</TE>
<TE>   $5 million, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   For now, county voters must decide who among the half a dozen
candidates is most qualified to serve as clerk and recorder, a post
that pays $110,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates are assistant county recorder Philip J. Schmit,
Oxnard City Clerk Daniel Martinez, former county Republican Party
Chairwoman Jackie Rodgers, county Board of Education trustee Yvonne
Gallegos Bodle, Simi Valley financial executive John Reid and
Moorpark attorney Michael Wesner.</TE>
<TE>   In a contest that has mostly been friendly and low-key, Schmit,
who is backed by incumbent Richard Dean, and Rodgers have at times
come under fire for issues involving their personal and political
backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   Schmit, 57, acknowledges being audited by the federal government
for failing to pay sufficient income tax from 1989 to 1994. But he
blamed the matter on an accountant's error and said he has since paid
what he owed--about $27,000 in back taxes, interest and penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Schmit, a former gas company service technician who joined the
recorder's office 12 years ago, says the clerk-recorder post is a
natural next step in his public service career.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Dean's support, Schmit has received contributions
from Assessor Dan Goodwin, Treasurer-Tax Collector Hal Pittman and
Fire Chief Bob Roper. Schmit has raised about $20,000, including
$6,500 in personal loans.</TE>
<TE>   Rodgers, 37, who resigned as head of the county's Republican Party
to join the clerk's race, has had to defend her ability to oversee
elections impartially. She took charge of the local GOP two years ago
as the group's first black chair and as a champion of the party's
conservative wing.</TE>
<TE>   The Oxnard real estate agent, who once worked in the Santa Barbara
County clerk's office, says she would never let politics influence
her job. Rodgers said she believes her election would encourage
higher turnout and participation among female and minority voters.</TE>
<TE>   "I just feel I can do an awful lot to break those barriers,"
Rodgers said. She has raised about $18,000, more than half in loans
from herself and two aides to Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks).
Contributors also include California Republican Party Chairman Shawn
Steel.</TE>
<TE>   Bodle, 62, of Oxnard, has raised the most money to date, with
about $38,000, mostly from personal loans. She holds a doctorate in
policy and organizational studies from UC Santa Barbara and teaches
accounting at Ventura College.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to updating the county's voting system, Bodle wants to
do more to increase turnout. She is supported by the largest county
government employees union.</TE>
<TE>   More Proposals for Assisting Voters</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, 43, has served as Oxnard's clerk for nine years. He says
the county clerk should work more closely with individual cities and
schools to develop voter education programs, including cable news
programming to explain bond measures and other ballot initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   He also proposes extending the recorder's hours of operation on
Fridays to allow more home buyers to complete real estate closings in
time to move in on weekends. Most of his $22,000 campaign
contributions are from personal loans.</TE>
<TE>   Reid, 58, of Simi Valley, is chief financial officer for a
Northridge software firm. He became interested in the election
process during the Florida recount.</TE>
<TE>   He wants to equip voting precincts with laptop computers to check
voter eligibility at the polls; the county now uses printed lists. He
also wants to change machines from the punch-card system to an
ATM-style touch system. Reid has raised slightly less than $1,800,
including an $1,100 personal loan.</TE>
<TE>   Wesner, 52, an attorney and county planning commissioner who lives
in Moorpark, says his legal background has prepared him for the
clerk-recorder job because he has often filed death certificates and
obtained title information from the office.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand what the average taxpayer faces when they go to the
counter," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wesner thinks the county should consider accepting electronically
notarized records and should open a full-service clerk-recorder
branch in eastern Ventura County. Wesner's campaign war chest is
listed at $42, which he spent to attend two Republican lunches.</TE>

<HD>Concordia Will Have Business School</HD>
<DH>Education: The program will be upgraded starting this fall
at the university campus in Irvine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The trustees of Concordia University voted unanimously Friday to
upgrade its business programs into a separate school at the Irvine
campus.</LD>
<LD>   "It's going to have a significant impact on Concordia because it
will elevate our business programs to a much higher status of
visibility and status within the university," said Jack Preus,
Concordia's president.</LD>
<LD>   There are 187 undergraduate business students at the Lutheran
school and 50 in the master of business administration program. MBA
candidates take classes mostly at night and on weekends.</LD>
<TE>   The business division now is part of the School of Arts and
Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   The university started its first graduate program in business, the
entrepreneurial MBA, three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Concordia expects about 20% more business students in each of the
first two years of the upgraded program, said Doug Fleischli, a
university spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Two faculty members will be added in the next two years, Preus
said.</TE>
<TE>   An important component to the program will be Christian
principles, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we don't mean is a different way of counting numbers," Preus
said. "What we do mean is our faith informs how we act. In our
programs, we'll give great attention to issues of business ethics,
integrity and those kinds of things."</TE>
<TE>   The business school will start operation in August, the beginning
of the next academic year.</TE>
<TE>   Fund-raising is expected to begin soon to pay for a $12-million
education and business technology building.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Christensen, Concordia's executive vice president for
university advancement, said the business school is a response to
student demand. A survey of the 1,500-student campus found that 40%
of undergraduates want to go into business. Another 40% become
teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Business schools in Orange County include those at UC Irvine, Cal
State Fullerton, Chapman University, Azusa Pacific University and
Pepperdine University.</TE>

<HD>Activists Hail Decision to Halt Recycler's Discharge of
Waste</HD>
<DH>Cleanup: The state will monitor ground water near the
Halaco metals plant in Oxnard. But the company denies facility is
hurting the environment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Environmental activists and local officials Friday hailed the state's
decision to crack down on the Halaco metal recycler that for years
has been accused of polluting wetlands along the shoreline near
Oxnard.</LD>
<LD>   However, a representative for Halaco Engineering Inc. denied that
the plant was environmentally harmful and said the state's action
could threaten the company's survival.</LD>
<LD>   Halaco has been ordered by the state's Regional Water Quality
Control Board to stop the soupy discharges that since 1970 have
yielded 40-foot-high slag heaps near Ormond Beach.</LD>
<TE>   The discharges, which amount to half a million gallons of
contaminated water each month, are to end by December.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, state officials have vowed to keep a close eye on
the plant, checking ground water near the site for contamination.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking forward to closely monitoring Halaco to ensure that
the order's provisions are met," said Dennis Dickerson, executive
officer of the water board.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists have criticized the state for failing to
effectively scrutinize Halaco over the years, despite repeated
complaints.</TE>
<TE>   The company Friday said it will spend more than $1 million to meet
the agency's long list of technical requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "That's huge for a small business," said Dave Gable, one of
Halaco's owners.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're delayed by other regulatory agencies so that we can't
comply with the board's requests, we may have a serious problem," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The plant, which has about 40 employees, recycles aluminum and
magnesium scrap.</TE>
<TE>   Gable characterized his company as environmentally conscious,
saying its recycling process uses just 4% of the energy that would
otherwise be used in extracting metal from raw ore.</TE>
<TE>   He said Halaco operations haven't damaged nearby wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the company have been "making a political statement,
not a factual statement," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists scoffed at Halaco's contentions. They have
accused the company of spewing carcinogens into the air and dumping
radioactive materials on its grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials have said they have complied with air pollution
standards. Radioactive thorium on the site is left over from
processes used 30 years ago and poses no hazard, according to the
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Such reassurances don't sway Drew Bohan, an attorney who heads the
ChannelKeeper environmental group in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a decades-long history of fighting tooth and nail
whenever a regulatory agency tries to do anything," said Bohan, whose
group sued Halaco last year over its alleged violations.</TE>
<TE>   He called the water quality board's order "a momentous decision,"
capping years of wrist slapping by enforcement agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "The board really saved the day," Bohan said. "I was really proud
to have these folks as our appointed officials."</TE>
<TE>   The board also won praise from John Flynn, the county supervisor
whose district includes Halaco.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about time we brought a bad neighbor under control," he
Flynn said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I think we've got something that will work."</TE>

<HD>Trust Fund for Affordable Housing Approved</HD>
<DH>Council: Construction money will be redirected from other
city revenues and phased in until it reaches $100 million by the
2003-04 fiscal year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council unanimously approved a plan Friday to
create a $100-million trust fund to build affordable housing
throughout the city.</LD>
<LD>   For housing advocates who have been fighting for such a fund for
more than three years, the vote brought cheers and sighs of relief.</LD>
<LD>   "To have a unanimous vote means that we did our job," said Jan
Breidenbach of Housing L.A. "Los Angeles is going to be changed."</LD>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn unveiled the plan in January. It has received
the support of housing advocates and the city's business community.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. is a great city where no one, especially workers, should be
forced to live in overcrowded conditions or slum conditions," Hahn
said at a news conference Friday. "We are moving from a housing
crisis to a housing revival."</TE>
<TE>   The trust fund will be built without imposing new fees or
subtracting from existing services, the mayor said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Eric Garcetti called the plan a heroic accomplishment
at a time when the city is facing a budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   According to housing experts, the city needs to build 4,000 to
5,000 units of affordable housing a year to meet growing demand. The
city has been able to build about 900 yearly, Garcetti said.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the housing fund is $10.5 million. Under the plan,
$42.4 million will be added during the 2002-03 fiscal year and $47.1
million more will be added in the 2003-04 fiscal year, increasing the
fund to $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   The dollars will come from redirecting city revenue from several
sources, including Community Redevelopment Agency funds, federal
community development block grants and an anticipated increase in
vehicle license fees, according to the mayor's plan. Tobacco
settlement funds also will be added.</TE>
<TE>   However, Councilman Nate Holden expressed concern that the plan
might take away from funds that could be used to pay for more police
and fire services--services that he says are essential to ensuring
that all housing is safe.</TE>
<TE>   He said the council would be paying lip service by approving the
plan without definite funding.</TE>
<TE>   However, advocates say they aren't worried about the funds
materializing.</TE>
<TE>   "Having the money phased in is perfectly reasonable," Breidenbach
said. "They've made their commitment."</TE>
<TE>   Historically, the city has spent about $23 per person annually on
affordable housing compared with New York, which spends $89 per
person, and Chicago, which spends $76 per person, the mayor's office
says. It also noted that 39% of Los Angeles residents are homeowners.
The national average is 66%.</TE>
<TE>   Although the trust fund will eventually be the largest such fund
of any city in the country, advocates say, some council members said
they know it will not eliminate Los Angeles' housing crunch.</TE>
<TE>   "We are so far behind that this is just the beginning of
addressing the problem," said Councilman Nick Pacheco.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be another five to 10 years before we get on pace or
really make a dent."</TE>
<TE>   "We are falling further and further behind each year," Garcetti
said. "But we can at least stem the tide."</TE>
<TE>   City officials estimate that the fund will help build an
additional 2,000 units yearly, but Pacheco and Garcetti are hopeful
that number can be 3,000 to 4,000 units.</TE>
<TE>   "It all depends on how we configure it, " Pacheco said, adding
that the city will need to decide how much to devote to multiunit
housing, single-family housing or to rehabilitating blighted
structures.</TE>
<TE>   The plan calls for an advisory committee that will include community
and business leaders, housing advocates and land use experts to decide
how and where the trust fund should be spent.</TE>
<TE>   That committee should be put in place now, rather than waiting
until the fund is in place, Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Another challenge the city will face, Pacheco said, is changing
the public's image of affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   "Far too often when we talk about affordable housing, communities
don't welcome [it]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "People look at affordable housing as a place where crime will
occur. We need to break down that myth. Renters aren't second-class
citizens."</TE>

<HD>Thwarted Kidnapper Still Sought by Police</HD>
<DH>Crime: Detectives ask help finding man who fired at
witness, officer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police detectives Friday asked for help finding a man who
tried to kidnap a woman, shot at a bystander, then exchanged gunfire
with an undercover officer in Hollywood last week.</LD>
<LD>   "The suspect committed three very serious crimes in the span of 10
minutes and is willing to shoot at people unprovoked," said Det. Mike
Whalen of the Los Angeles Police Department's Robbery-Homicide
Division.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the unidentified man tried to abduct a woman while she
was walking home through an alley in the 6100 block of Eleanor Avenue
about 8:15 a.m. on Feb. 22.</LD>
<TE>   Whalen said the attacker, believed to be in his 20s, grabbed the
32-year-old woman from behind and tried to force her into a two-door,
black Honda Civic. The woman, who told police she did not know the
assailant, was able to get away by kicking, screaming and apparently
scaring the man, Whalen said.</TE>
<TE>   The attacker drove away and fired several shots at a 37-year-old
man who was standing north of the alley, Whalen said. The man, who
witnessed the attempted kidnapping, suffered a minor wound and was
treated at the scene, Det. Robert Bub said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said an undercover Los Angeles officer who was in the area
investigating an unrelated case heard the gunshots and followed the
fleeing man in an unmarked car. The man stopped his car at Orange
Drive just south of Melrose Avenue and fired several shots at the
officer, Whalen said.</TE>
<TE>   The officer fired back, shattering the gunman's rear window,
driver-side window and front windshield, Whalen said. The officer was
not hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators believe the man was wounded, either by a gunshot or
shattered glass, Bub said.</TE>
<TE>   The man is wanted for attempted kidnapping and attempted murder,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information may call investigators at the LAPD's
Robbery-Homicide Division at (213) 485-2531.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Write-In Candidates Get Boost in Court</HD>
<DH>Election: Voters are to be made aware at polling places
they can get a list of names. Opponents of indicted Superior Court
judge hail the ruling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD and MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a highly unusual ruling, an Orange County judge on Friday sided
with challengers to Superior Court Judge Ronald C. Kline and ordered
election officials to post signs at polling places alerting voters
that they can receive a list of write-in candidates.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling gives a significant boost to write-in candidates, who
are traditionally longshots because their names don't appear on
ballots. County attorneys said they cannot recall such a step ever
being taken.</LD>
<LD>   Election officials must now display signs that will undoubtedly
draw attention to write-in races at 1,716 polling places countywide.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling affects all races in which write-ins are candidates but
will particularly favor those opposing Kline, whose name is the only
one that will appear on the ballot. Kline faces charges of child
molestation and possessing child pornography.</TE>
<TE>   "It changes the dynamic of the election," said Dana Point attorney
John Adams, one of the write-in hopefuls. "I think that before this
ruling, it was wishful thinking that Judge Kline could be beat."</TE>
<TE>   County election officials had previously refused requests to post
the names of write-ins at polling places, citing a recommendation
from the California secretary of state's office against the practice.</TE>
<TE>   But Friday morning, a group of voters together with one of Kline's
election opponents sued the county, arguing that Registrar of Voters
Rosalyn Lever was unfairly depriving voters of information about
qualified candidates.</TE>
<TE>   After some hesitation, Judge Gregory H. Lewis agreed. Lewis
ordered that voters should be made aware that they can ask for a list
of write-ins running in every race--not just those running against
Kline--when they pick up their ballots for Tuesday's primary
election.</TE>
<TE>   Three people running for governor, lieutenant governor and county
supervisor also have qualified as write-ins. But outside Lewis' Santa
Ana courtroom, it was clear which race had the most at stake in the
judge's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Kline's opponents applauded as they left the courtroom and hailed
the order as a victory that could sway the outcome of the election.</TE>
<TE>   With only three days before polling, their biggest hurdle has
become spreading word that Kline is not running unopposed for another
six-year term. The last successful write-in in Orange County was in
1986, and political observers have said Kline's challengers face an
uphill battle.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the psychological effect will be to remind voters about
this race," said Dan Dutcher, a former judge running for Kline's
seat.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling marked a compromise between election practices in
Orange County and what the write-ins had hoped for.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, voters could request a list of write-in candidates at
polling stations but few knew they had such an option. The issue
divided county officials. Supervisor Todd Spitzer attended Friday's
court hearing and asked the judge to rule against the county.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers working on behalf of the voters who filed the legal action
asked Lewis to order that a list of the names of the write-ins be
displayed where voters pick up their ballots.</TE>
<TE>   County attorneys did not oppose the request, but the judge
expressed concern that such a posting would give an unfair advantage
to write-ins.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts praised the judge's compromise as a creative way to
solve the problem without giving too much help to any one candidate.</TE>
<TE>   "The question here is: Does it confer an unfair advantage on the
write-in candidates?" said Los Angeles attorney Manny Klausner, who
specializes in election law.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd say it neutralizes a bit the advantage of the candidate
listed on the ballot, but it's not unfair."</TE>

<HD>O.C. Spurns Suit by Man Wrongfully Convicted</HD>
<DH>Courts: County admits he didn't commit murder, but says
that public defender's office acted appropriately 20 years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though two branches of county government say DeWayne McKinney was
wrongly convicted of murder 20 years ago, attorneys defending Orange
County against McKinney's civil lawsuit are once again opening the
case.</LD>
<LD>   County attorneys are trying to get a judge to throw out McKinney's
lawsuit by presenting evidence that his original attorneys might have
had reason to believe at the time that he was guilty.</LD>
<LD>   McKinney filed suit against the public defender's office after his
release in 2000, contending his lawyers sat on evidence of his
innocence for more than 15 years. He is also suing the Orange Police
Department, claiming a detective lied to witnesses about evidence in
the case.</LD>
<TE>   The public defender's office reopened the case in 1998 and found
evidence of McKinney's innocence. The district attorney conducted a
separate investigation and asked that the case be thrown out, saying
prosecutors in that office believed another man probably committed
the murder.</TE>
<TE>   McKinney, seeking $10 million in damages, claims his attorneys
didn't properly act on the statements of two prisoners who said
another man killed the manager of a Burger King during a 1980
robbery.</TE>
<TE>   The county, however, said the prisoners lacked credibility and
that McKinney's attorneys had good reason not to pursue the case
further. They say he failed a polygraph test shortly after his
conviction. The polygraph examiner concluded that some of his answers
showed "clear evidence of deception," county lawyers allege in court
documents.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit has placed Public Defender Carl Holmes in an awkward
position. In a deposition as part of the suit, Holmes testified that
he remains convinced of McKinney's innocence. But Holmes' lawyers are
trying to prove lawyers in the office had reason to believe McKinney
was guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Holmes declined to comment further. McKinney's lawyers contend in
court documents that the polygraph test was unreliable. They hired a
polygraph expert who said the 1982 tests show no deception by
McKinney.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Gary Taylor is scheduled to consider the
county's motion to dismiss the lawsuit this month.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing will focus on whether the public defender had a duty
to defend McKinney after his conviction.</TE>

<DH>Admonitions to visitors--the obvious, the informative, the

<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Perched on the edge of a campground in Sequoia &amp; Kings Canyon
National Parks is a small sign intended either to promote safety or
provide comic relief. It says: "No Tents Allowed on Roadway."</LD>
<LD>   The sign is one of well over 6,500 in the twin parks, which may
strike some as a bit much for an area where the hand of man is
supposed to be largely invisible.</LD>
<LD>   But in most large national parks in the West, signs are deemed to
be essential. How else do you prevent people from getting lost in the
wilderness or sleeping in the road?</LD>
<TE>   Signs are so important that most Western parks employ at least one
sign maker. It is a job that requires creativity, craftsmanship and
an economy of words.</TE>
<TE>   "Signs are something you take for granted and don't really think
about until there's a sign not there and you need it," says Steve
Esson, who has been making signs at Sequoia &amp; Kings Canyon since
1995. "My clients in this park are people on vacation. They're
relaxed. They're not in a normal state of mind. You have to find a
way to get their attention very quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Although it seems reasonable to think that a finite number of
signs are needed in what is essentially wilderness, the demand for
new or replacement signs in national parks never slows.</TE>
<TE>   Falling trees, wildfires and floods claim some signs. Others take
a beating from salty air at coastal parks, from the pervasive
dampness of redwood forests and the intense ultraviolet light found
in the Sierra.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife--particularly birds--also deliver insults on a regular
basis. "A grizzly bear can't walk past a sign without knocking them
over. They bite them, swat at them and paw at them," said Dave Yeats,
the sign maker at Glacier National Park in northwest Montana.</TE>
<TE>   People also contribute to the damage.</TE>
<TE>   Snowplows knock over dozens of signs in mountain parks each year,
as do inattentive motorists focused on the scenery rather than the
road. Vandals claim a few, and thieves swipe them, generally because
of their decorative value.</TE>
<TE>   One such sign was in the Muir Hut, an igloo-shaped structure made
of rock at the top of 12,000-foot Muir Pass in the Kings Canyon back
country. The hut was built in 1930 for backpackers stuck at the top
of the pass during lightning storms.</TE>
<TE>   It had a sign banning overnight camping. Weighing only a couple of
pounds, it was easy pickings and disappeared every summer.</TE>
<TE>   Esson's solution was to add some heft. A new sign was constructed
of anodized aluminum. It featured the likeness of John Muir and the
logo of the Sierra Club, which Muir founded. Esson then bolted the
sign into a 60-pound concrete log that was flown by helicopter to the
top of the pass. The new sign now sits over the mantel of the hut and
hasn't budged an inch since being installed last year.</TE>
<TE>   In Sequoia &amp; Kings Canyon and other parks, the most arresting
signs are the ones installed to protect the environment from people
and people from the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors to Western parks will find signs warning them not to chop
down trees, feed wildlife, ignite wildfires, take dogs on trails,
clean dishes in creeks, litter, pick wildflowers, trample fragile
vegetation and take objects from archeological sites.</TE>
<TE>   A novel sign in Alaska's Denali National Park reads:</TE>
<TE>   "All Arctic Ground Squirrels. Warning. Refuse ALL handouts from
humans. They mean well but their food will make you slow and fat ...
easy bear bait."</TE>
<TE>   But most signs in parks warn people of lurking dangers.</TE>
<TE>   At a beach at Point Reyes National Seashore, one sign warns
visitors of sneaker waves, riptides, a strong undertow and sharks.</TE>
<TE>   At Wyoming's Yellowstone National Park and California's Lassen
Volcanic National Park, boiling mud pots, erupting geysers and other
piping hot geothermal features may not look inviting, but park
officials leave nothing to chance or common sense. They have posted
signs warning people not leap into the roiling, steaming waters.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, rivers with strong currents, cold waters and slippery
rocks have inspired a class of signs warning people of the obvious
dangers.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the photo phenomenon. Because park visitors often
go to dangerous extremes to take pictures, signs have been posted at
the top of Yosemite's waterfalls and the rim of the Grand Canyon
warning visitors that landing on rocks after falling a few hundred
feet will, indeed, be fatal.</TE>
<TE>   When he isn't in his workshop building more signs, Esson is doing
reconnaissance work, backpacking 150 miles each year, checking on the
condition of his handiwork and quizzing hikers he meets on the
effectiveness of his signs.</TE>
<TE>   One of Esson's current projects is redesigning entrance signs for
Kings Canyon. The importance of the job is hard to overstate. The
design must impart the uniqueness of the landscape visitors are about
to enter while subtly assuring them that under the National Park
Service's stewardship, the place is in good hands.</TE>
<TE>   Esson made two small-scale models of the preliminary design. Both
were imperfect in ways that can jolt a sign maker awake in the middle
of the night. Neither sign featured the parks' emblematic sequoia
tree. Neither incorporated a view of Kings Canyon that was actually
within park boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   So, Esson went back to the drawing board. The result is a
beautiful sign with a detailed carving of a giant sequoia and granite
overlays representing Kings Canyon. He got the idea for the canyon
view from a photo he took on a backpacking trip looking west down the
park's Bubbs Creek drainage.</TE>
<TE>   "The park service is in charge of some of the most beautiful areas
of the world, and we want signs to look good for them," Esson said.
"Something like this Kings Canyon entrance sign will be there for
years. For a few generations, at least, millions of people are going
to pull over and take photos standing by that sign with their
families."</TE>
<TE>   Which, Esson believes, is a very good sign.</TE>

<HD>Family Ties Make for Political Drama in S.F.</HD>
<DH>Contest: Bay city is caught up in the race for public
defender, thanks to the daughter of a powerful state politician.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA HALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>In Hollywood, conventional wisdom says you can't make movies about
politics because no one cares enough to watch.</LD>
<LD>   In San Francisco, you can't hold a political race without everyone
watching every minute.</LD>
<LD>   This election season's most captivating race here stars the
daughter of a storied San Francisco politician and the son of a
Sacramento auto mechanic. Other featured players are the father who
got his colleagues to contribute to his child's campaign and the
mayor--Dad's buddy for decades--who insists he hasn't greased the
daughter's path. Clint Eastwood makes a cameo appearance as the main
draw at a fund-raiser for her.</LD>
<TE>   The prize? The position of public defender--that unglamorous
office that defends accused criminals who can't afford counsel. It
pays $140,000, about as much as a third-year associate in a tony San
Francisco law firm makes.</TE>
<TE>   But Kimiko Burton and Jeff Adachi want it bad, and San Francisco
seems intrigued.</TE>
<TE>   Burton, 37, who was appointed public defender last year by Mayor
Willie Brown after her predecessor left during his term, is the
latest of the fabled Burton clan to run for political office. She is
the only child of state Sen. John Burton, arguably the most powerful
politician in the state next to Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Her uncle was the late U.S. Rep. Phil Burton, legendary champion
of social and environmental causes. She worked in the public
defender's office for five years in the early '90s before leaving to
work for the state Board of Equalization, California's tax authority.</TE>
<TE>   Adachi, 42, who once had a job as a duck plucker--"40 cents a
duck, it's pretty good when you're a teenager," he said--worked in
the public defender's office for 15 years, rising to chief attorney,
until Kim Burton came in and replaced him with her own chief of
staff.</TE>
<TE>   This year they've both walked neighborhoods and attended house
parties. They've submitted themselves to grueling rounds of
interviews with San Francisco's dozens of Democratic clubs, as if
they were going through sorority rush.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I've wanted to do is be a public defender," says
Adachi.</TE>
<TE>   "It is where my passion lies," says Burton.</TE>
<TE>   Unusual System for an Unusual City</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear why San Francisco is the only city in the state and
one of two in the country--the other is Tampa, Fla.--that elects a
public defender. But it's fitting that the phenomenon would occur in
a city with a strong social conscience. If any body politic would
want to have a hand in deciding who represents its poor on criminal
charges, it would be San Francisco's.</TE>
<TE>   That said, the office rarely generates election heat. The city's
first public defender, Frank Egan, was elected in 1921. Not since he
was tried and convicted in 1932 of murdering a client--he was
moonlighting in trusts and estates work--has so much attention been
focused on the public defender's office.</TE>
<TE>   But San Franciscans love a good show, and this is the juiciest
thing going. "There's nothing else all that exciting," says a local
litigator who follows politics. "We've hardly heard of [gubernatorial
candidate Richard] Riordan."</TE>
<TE>   Many see the race, rightly or wrongly, as a gauge of how much
power the Burton name still carries.</TE>
<TE>   "[John Burton's] daughter's race is his canary in the mine
shaft--to see if there is any oxygen left for the Burton machine in
San Francisco," says Peter Keane, the dean of Golden Gate Law School
and a supporter of Adachi. "I think it has tremendous symbolic
importance."</TE>
<TE>   Here, Burton is about as high-profile a family name as you can
get. The Burtons are beloved as protectors of the poor, civil rights
and the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Burton is credited with creating Golden Gate National
Recreation Area. John Burton is a formidable political force; the
Burtons have lost one election among them in 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   A small city (population 770,000) with a long history of social
activism, San Francisco has a political structure built not on party
politics--most players are liberal or ultra-liberal--but on issues,
people and relationships.</TE>
<TE>   As the tapestry of personal connections goes, it ranks somewhere
between a Tolstoy novel and "The Young and the Restless." Not as
complex as the former; not as much sex as the latter.</TE>
<TE>   Kimiko Burton's campaign has been fraught with rumors about how
she got appointed to the job in the first place. When Public Defender
Jeff Brown left last year for a seat on the Public Utilities
Commission, both Burton and Adachi wanted the job and told the mayor
as much.</TE>
<TE>   Adachi was the No. 2 lawyer in the office; he estimates he handled
2,500 cases, 100 of them as jury trials, over the course of 15 years.
Burton was director of the mayor's Criminal Justice Council,
coordinating city departments involved in criminal justice issues and
bringing in $46 million in federal and state grants. She helped fund
a variety of juvenile justice programs, including a high school to
help troubled youths.</TE>
<TE>   But rumors spread that Brown appointed Burton as a favor to her
father.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know Jeff Adachi from Adam," says an exasperated Brown.
"I have known Kimiko Burton since her birth. Why, in the name of
heaven, if I have an opportunity to name someone, would I name
someone I don't know?"</TE>
<TE>   Burton has been endorsed by all the local heavyweights--the mayor,
Sen. Barbara Boxer, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi.
If she loses, political observers wonder, is the Burton dynasty
damaged?</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever the outcome, it will show what machine politics is all
about," says Sam Kwong, president of the Chinese American Democratic
Club, which has endorsed Adachi.</TE>
<TE>   John Burton could face the electorate himself in another two
years. There is speculation that if he must leave the state Senate
due to term limits in 2004, he may run for mayor. Or he could try to
stay in the Senate if Proposition 45 passes. (That ballot initiative
essentially says politicians must comply with term limits unless they
get a written excuse from their constituents.)</TE>
<TE>   "This is about the future of San Francisco politics," says Adachi,
stoking a theme that he has made a key part of his campaign. In his
modest townhouse law office on sloping Fillmore Street, just below
the stately mansions of Pacific Heights, Adachi has posted charts
tracking his opponent's spending. "This is about whether the next
generation of machine politicians will be put in place or whether
independent politicians like myself will win."</TE>
<TE>   Those are fighting words, folks say.</TE>
<TE>   "This man [Adachi] has come by and said, 'You're a juggernaut and
I'm a fresh face,'" says Ed Moose, a restaurateur who's been
schmoozing with politicians for three decades, most recently at his
own place, Moose's, on Washington Square. As well-read on politics as
any consultant, Moose counts himself a longtime John Burton friend
and admirer.</TE>
<TE>   "Shoot--this wouldn't bother John a bit," says Moose, sitting at
his bar, nursing a small vodka with a grapefruit-juice chaser, "but
you start saying things about his daughter and it's infuriating. It's
personal."</TE>
<TE>   The Burtons protest that Adachi isn't all that independent. They
like to note that he appeared in a commercial for Willie Brown during
the last mayoral campaign. (Adachi says it was a tiny part in a big
commercial.)</TE>
<TE>   No Apologies for Burton's Backing</TE>
<TE>   In a contest of political clout, Kimiko Burton wins. Neither
Burton denies this.</TE>
<TE>   "I stand guilty of trying to help my daughter," says John Burton,
who is known for his ability to persuade people to do what he wants.
"I sent out a letter," he says, estimating it went to about 700 or
800 people, "and said, 'My daughter is running and I'd appreciate
your help with it--and if you don't, I'm going to shoot you.'"</TE>
<TE>   Burton offers that statement in his trademark playful but blunt
manner--and dismisses critics who insist he is twisting arms. "Nobody
has done anything they didn't want to do," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Burton adds that many of the marquee names who support his
daughter know her well. "She's known Barbara Boxer since she was 10.
She worked for Nancy Pelosi."</TE>
<TE>   But he acknowledges that the race is significant beyond who gets
to run the public defender's office.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people who have been in the city less than six
years who have no concept of the contributions my brother and I have
made to the city," he says. "What they know is that anybody who has
been around is bad, so new people are good."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Brown, the former public defender, had a famous California
name when he beat his opponent in his first race, in 1978. "I had a
very gentlemanly race in 1978," says Brown, a cousin of Jerry Brown,
the former governor and the current mayor of Oakland. (Jeff Brown ran
five more times unopposed.)</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing gentle about this contest. It's downright catty.</TE>
<TE>   Adachi says Burton doesn't have enough experience to be a
misdemeanor supervisor in the office. Burton suggests Adachi puts
courtroom performance above clients' best interests. Jeff Brown
un-endorsed Adachi, switching his support to Burton, saying Adachi
cuts corners.</TE>
<TE>   Law school dean Keane--chief attorney in the public defender's
office before Adachi--calls his successor "a first-rate trial
lawyer," and says Burton was a complainer and a "princess" during her
early years as a deputy public defender.</TE>
<TE>   Down the street from Burton's campaign headquarters, in a dark
wood-walled eatery called Kate O'Brien's, the Irish-born bar manager,
Janis Geraghty, can't vote, but she still knows the players. "She had
her benefit here, and my boyfriend played at an Adachi benefit,"
Geraghty says. "I liked them both."</TE>
<TE>   Given all the nastiness, it's surprising how similar the two
candidates are--graduates of Hastings College of Law, proud liberals,
married, parents of one toddler apiece, descendants of Japanese
Americans. All of Adachi's grandparents were interned in camps for
Japanese Americans during World War II. Burton's maternal grandmother
escaped internment only because she lived in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Burton grew up marching with her father and boycotting grapes.
Adachi volunteered on a wrongly convicted Korean immigrant's defense
team.</TE>
<TE>   But Adachi believes public defenders should be vigorous in court.
"When I started in the office, I set out immediately to establish
myself as a trial lawyer," he says. "I worked hard at learning the
science and art and skill of being a trial lawyer."</TE>
<TE>   Burton contends that the key is to serve the client, and that
doesn't always mean going to trial--an arena in which she concedes
that she has less experience than Adachi. "But I'm not afraid to go
to trial," she says. "The fact that you've done X number of trials
doesn't make you a better lawyer."</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco Chronicle has endorsed Adachi, but even at this
point no one seems ready to predict who will win. No matter who
triumphs, San Franciscans are engrossed in the show.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have to watch TV," quips Robert Barnes, past president
of the Alice B. Toklas Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender
Democratic Club, which supports Burton. "We have drama in politics."</TE>

<HD>Riordan Does Stand-Up Act When Not Stumping</HD>
<DH>Campaign: A former aide questions his decision to do a
comedy show when he has lost edge in last days of race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Richard Riordan was making his way through a bustling lunchtime crowd
at a barbecue joint in San Luis Obispo when a man called out:
"Hey--as long as you get Gray Davis out of office, we'll be happy."</LD>
<LD>   The Republican candidate for governor responded with a joke about
the starched and blow-dried Democrat he hopes to toss out of office.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm going to outlaw hairspray," Riordan said. "That'll make him
move out of California."</LD>
<TE>   It sounded spontaneous, but Riordan was actually testing the line
for a new stand-up comedy routine, which, as it turns out, is taking
up a good part of his time and energy on the last weekend before the
GOP primary. On Friday, Riordan flew here, to the least Republican
part of California, for a two-night gig with a troupe of friends at
San Francisco State University.</TE>
<TE>   "I promised to do this a year ago," Riordan said. "I'm living up
to my promise."</TE>
<TE>   True to form, the most unorthodox candidate in the fiercely
contested primary is concluding his campaign in the most unorthodox
of ways.</TE>
<TE>   Just a few weeks ago, the former Los Angeles mayor was treating
the primary as little more than a nuisance on the way to his
inevitable November showdown with Davis. His standard response to
jabs from GOP rivals was simply to laugh, and as late as mid-January,
he was still planning to take a four-day ski trip to Idaho two weeks
before the election.</TE>
<TE>   But with conservative rival Bill Simon Jr. surging in the polls
and threatening to capture the GOP nomination on Tuesday, Riordan is
struggling to adjust to a radically changed political landscape.</TE>
<TE>   His own advisors warn that his campaign is in deep trouble. His
wave of new television ads bashing Simon reflect their fear that
Riordan's candidacy could founder Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Yet at a tense juncture when many candidates would cancel personal
obligations and focus entirely on the race, Riordan is sticking with
his comedy act. His campaign scheduled his weekend around his two
performances with Don Knotts and other less well-known Hollywood
comedians in the "Yarmy's Army" troupe. The shows will raise money
for San Francisco State's athletics department. Today, Riordan plans
two campaign stops, both in the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   Pollster Arnold Steinberg, a former Riordan advisor, said the
candidate was wasting valuable time writing gag lines, rehearsing and
performing in the shows and campaigning far from his Southern
California base--just when voters finally are tuned into the race.
Riordan's campaign managers, he said, "don't seem to have the
professionalism to control the candidate and to say no."</TE>
<TE>   "If there was a campaign plan, it shouldn't include this, and if
it does, it's the wrong plan," Steinberg said. "In a campaign, the
candidate is not in charge; the campaign is in charge."</TE>
<TE>   Candidates typically clear their personal calendars in the final
stage of a race. That enables the political professionals running
their campaigns to deploy them wherever they can best meet
late-shifting strategic needs. In a state as vast as California,
where television is the crucial means of reaching voters, candidates
also typically race to several media markets a day to maximize their
exposure on the local news. Ideally, the news coverage--which is much
harder to attract in earlier stages of the race--complements the
message of the campaign's television ads.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, though, has kept a remarkably light public schedule
during the final weeks of his campaign. Aside from Sacramento, the
last time he stumped in the Central Valley--a Republican
stronghold--was a trip to Fresno 31 days ago.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Riordan's only public event was a press conference
in Huntington Beach. On Thursday, the only event was a lunchtime
visit to an outdoor shopping plaza in San Luis Obispo. His campaign
barred television crews from covering his speech that evening at a
fund-raiser in Burlingame near San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday--two days before the election--Riordan again plans just
one public event, at the end of his early morning bike ride along the
Los Angeles Marathon route.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that Riordan is not working hard. He hosted other
fund-raisers this week in Sacramento, Santa Barbara and Newport
Beach. He and his wife, Nancy Daly Riordan, got their pictures taken
with hundreds of donors. He has spent hours on the phone doing radio
interviews. He has flown around the state seeking newspaper
endorsements from editorial boards. And on some days, he has had as
many as three public events. On Monday, he plans campaign stops in at
least four regions of California.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing plenty," Riordan said. "I've been around the state
every day now, and I'll be doing some over the weekend."</TE>
<TE>   On the stump, Riordan has fine-tuned his message to appeal to
Republicans who, according to polls, are turning to his more
conservative rivals--Simon and, to a lesser extent, Secretary of
State Bill Jones. Riordan has focused more and more on his support
for the death penalty and a ban on bilingual education.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that every child has to learn to read, write and think
in English," he said in a KABC-AM radio interview.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan has weaned himself from the habit of telling Republican
crowds they should respect people regardless of their sexual
orientation. But he voices no regrets for focusing on his support for
abortion rights and other moderate views that irk many conservative
Republicans, saying he wanted "to be the same person in the primary
and in the final."</TE>
<TE>   And every day, he blames his plunge in popularity on the
governor's $8-million worth of anti-Riordan ads.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis has done something that's historic," Riordan told
nearly 300 supporters at his "pre-primary victory" dinner Thursday in
Burlingame. "He has run a campaign to hijack the Republican Party."</TE>
<TE>   Notably absent on the campaign trail are the vast majority of the
208 elected officials who have endorsed Riordan--often a sign of
dimming confidence in a candidate's prospects for success. Not one
elected official showed up at Riordan's event in Huntington Beach on
Wednesday, in the heart of Republican-heavy Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   At the Burlingame dinner, Katie Boyd, Riordan's Northern
California finance chairwoman, could not find any elected officials
other than state Assemblyman Abel Maldonado (R-Santa Maria).</TE>
<TE>   "There are some who are aspiring to run," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. David Dreier (R-San Dimas), who campaigned with Riordan
Friday in Hollywood, said many of the candidate's other supporters
were tied up "just doing other things," many of them in Washington
and Sacramento. Rep. Mary Bono (R-Palm Springs), he said, wanted to
stump with Riordan on Monday, but had a "dinner in Palm Springs that
she just could not miss."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan advisors denied elected officials were avoiding
appearances with him and insisted he was keeping a rigorous campaign
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "The more people see him, the more they like him," campaign
political director Kevin Spillane said. But on the eve of his comedy
routine in San Francisco, the gaffe-prone candidate acknowledged he
would need to watch how he uses his wit--and confessed to ambivalence
about the hairspray joke.</TE>
<TE>   "I promised my wife I would tell no jokes about Gray Davis,"
Riordan said. "Like jokes about his hair."</TE>

<HD>Rocketdyne Case Ends in a Mistrial</HD>
<DH>Courts: Jury's 10-2 vote isn't enough to convict two former
employees accused in fatal blast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Riverside jury deadlocked Friday on whether two former Rocketdyne
employees illegally burned chemical waste that resulted in a deadly
1994 blast at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory near Simi Valley.</LD>
<LD>   After more than a week of deliberations, the jury of eight men and
four women voted 10-2 in favor of guilty on three charges. But that
was short of the unanimous verdict required for a criminal
conviction.</LD>
<LD>   The defendants, Joseph E. Flanagan, 61, of Stanwood, Wash., and
Edgar R. Wilson, 65, of Chatsworth, are charged with violating
federal environmental laws.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Robert J. Timlin declared a
mistrial and set a March 18 hearing. Assistant U.S. Atty. William
Carter will have to decide whether to retry the case.</TE>
<TE>   "No decision has been made at this point in time," said Thom
Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys obviously wanted a verdict of not guilty, but
said they were satisfied with a hung jury.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Flanagan and I are pleased that after five years of
investigation and a four-month trial ... the government could not
convince 12 people of guilt on any of the charges," said Flanagan's
attorney, John D. Vandevelde. "We are prepared to try this case
repeatedly until Dr. Flanagan is fully exonerated."</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Sharenow, Wilson's attorney, said his client maintains his
innocence.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that the government should just drop the case and not
waste any more taxpayer money," he said. Sharenow estimates the
government has spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in its
seven-year investigation and prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan and Wilson are accused of illegally burning chemical
waste at the field laboratory on July 21, 1994, and July, 26, 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan, then director of Rocketdyne's Chemical Technology Group,
also is charged with illegal waste storage.</TE>
<TE>   Each count carries a maximum penalty of up to five years in prison
and a $250,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   A third defendant, James F. Weber, 52, of Moorpark, pleaded guilty
in August to illegally storing explosive materials, a misdemeanor. He
has not yet been sentenced.</TE>
<TE>   At trial, Carter argued the defendants knew they were burning
waste. He said they followed a procedure similar to that used at the
laboratory's old burn pit.</TE>
<TE>   They poured chemicals on top of sawdust in a large aluminum pan
and ignited them, he said. They did not measure the ingredients, nor
did they collect data.</TE>
<TE>   The first burns took place on July 21, 1994. Five men, including
Wilson and Weber, ignited the chemicals but had to stop when sparks
created a nearby brush fire.</TE>
<TE>   Five days later, the men met again and conducted two burns before
the chemicals exploded. The blast killed scientists Otto K. Heiney,
53, of Canoga Park, and Larry A. Pugh, 51, of Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan was not present, but was the men's supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   Both Flanagan and Wilson testified that they believed the burns
were legitimate scientific tests.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan said he did not direct, approve or plan any "phony
testing" or illegal storage.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said he was told Flanagan had authorized using excess
rocket propellants for overpressure tests.</TE>
<TE>   He admitted to once burning waste, but said he was reprimanded and
never did it again.</TE>
<TE>   A witness for the prosecution, Lee Wells, 70, of Newbury Park, was
severely burned in the explosion and was granted immunity to testify
against the defendants. He said he assumed that they were burning
hazardous waste.</TE>
<TE>   Heiney's widow, Judy, also testified for the prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   She said her husband confided his growing frustration with "stupid
environmental rules" and how the lab could "get around" them. She
said her husband would not have acted without Flanagan's approval.</TE>
<TE>   For the same incidents, Rocketdyne's then parent company, Rockwell
International Corp., pleaded guilty in 1996 to mishandling hazardous
chemicals and paid a $6.5-million fine.</TE>

<HD>Some Officials Question L.A. Marathon Costs</HD>
<DH>Services: Spending raises concerns about whether city gets
its money's worth. Backers point to publicity and revenue from
visitors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT and GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Marathon is expected to bring 23,000 runners to the
city and pump $22 million into the local economy this week. Still,
some local officials worry that the event is costing the city too
much.</LD>
<LD>   Under Los Angeles Marathon Inc.'s current contract, the company
must pay about $130,000 annually to the city for the right to hold
the marathon, to be held Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   But the city spends more than $500,000 to control traffic, close
streets and patrol the route. On top of that, the Department of Water
and Power sponsors the marathon to the tune of $112,000 a year.</LD>
<TE>   Now confronted with a $200-million budget deficit, some officials
who have supported the marathon are questioning whether Los Angeles
is getting its money's worth from the run and other special events.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of those dirty little secrets at City Hall," said
Councilman Jack Weiss. "We're spending like it's the boss' money. We
are not paying attention to the overall amounts of money that are
going out for these things."</TE>
<TE>   The marathon is not the only event that receives free city
services. Los Angeles routinely waives fees for the Academy Awards,
the Grammys and other gatherings--big and small. Police estimate that
they spent "hundreds of thousands of dollars" in public money to
provide security for the Emmy Awards after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Many officials argue that the prestige of having big events in the
city outweighs the public expense. They also note that the city
benefits indirectly, through increases in sales tax and hotel bed tax
revenues.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason L.A. doesn't have a football team is that they kind of
have this attitude that we're so great we don't have to do anything
to bring great stuff to our city," said William Burke, president of
Los Angeles Marathon and husband of county Supervisor Yvonne
Brathwaite Burke.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not of that belief. I think you have to do something that
shows off your good points," he said. "You have to toot your own
horn. It doesn't take a genius to know that the rest of the country
is used to seeing us when there is an earthquake, fire or drive-by
shooting. This shows our good side."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Weiss and City Controller Laura Chick are asking the
city's number-crunchers to figure out how much Los Angeles spends on
services for all special events.</TE>
<TE>   "There's all this discussion on how the marathon helps the city's
economy bring in people and money," Chick said. "That's great and
important. But still we must spend our money in a businesslike and
thoughtful way."</TE>
<TE>   Weiss said many people fear that Los Angeles would lose events to
other cities if it didn't pick up the tab on services.</TE>
<TE>   "People argue that if you don't waive the fees, they'll just move
the events to New York. Well let's find out if that's true," he said.
"We need to get everything out into the open, so people will know
whether this is a good or bad use of city resources."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is not alone in helping underwrite extravaganzas. The
city of New York spends a staggering $4.3 million on services for its
marathon, which drew 25,000 runners last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Cities are always comping these events," said Bob Stern, the head
of the Center for Governmental Studies in Los Angeles. "They believe
it's more than just money, it's also prestige. Look at all the cities
trying to get the Olympics. It makes us feel good. But it sure costs
us a lot of money."</TE>
<TE>   If moneymaking events are seeking public funds, Stern says, they
should open their books for scrutiny and pay what they can afford.</TE>
<TE>   "As a condition for city money, you should be required to make
your books public," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, then-Councilman Mike Feuer suggested that the city be
allowed to audit Los Angeles Marathon Inc. before approving any more
city subsidies for the event. He also wanted to analyze marathon
contracts in other large cities.</TE>
<TE>   His concerns came after a campaign money-laundering scandal
involving Burke's firm. Los Angeles Marathon Inc. was fined $200,000
by the Ethics Commission in 1994 after funneling about 100
contributions, topping $50,000, into a half-dozen council campaigns.
Councilman Nate Holden, a longtime friend of Burke's, topped the
list, receiving about $9,000 in contributions.</TE>
<TE>   "The money-laundering issue was in the back of people's minds,"
Feuer said. "There were questions as to how much profit the marathon
was making relative to what the city was providing. I just wanted
some answers."</TE>
<TE>   Feuer's colleagues, however, accused him of losing sight of the
larger picture--Los Angeles' image around the world. They charged
that he was "nickel and diming" the marathon.</TE>
<TE>   They voted to extend Burke's contract to 2005 without the audit.
Then in October 2001, the council voted to extend the contract again,
this time to 2010. Council members, including Weiss, unanimously
approved a provision that made it clear that the city would pick up
the tab for much of the police and transportation services.</TE>
<TE>   Holden led the charge for the contract extension.</TE>
<TE>   "We have over 20,000 runners coming from all over the world," he
said. "It's a benefit."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Burke noted that organizers of other events are not
required to pay fees.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the only major event held in the city of Los Angeles that
has a tremendous economic impact in the city that pays this kind of
fee," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Dodgers get all those services free. When the Raiders were
here, they got all those services. You ask the Staples Center, the
day they had the parade when the Lakers won the championship and they
had all the police down there--not a dime."</TE>
<TE>   Burke added: "Ask me how much the Academy Awards and how much the
Grammy Awards paid. I'm the only guy in town who pays."</TE>

<HD>Out in Front, Simon Sticks to Quirky, Disciplined Routine</HD>
<DH>Politics: Despite his new status as the favorite in the GOP
primary, he reminds his staff to stay focused. And he always, always
smiles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whether he's playing with a model F-22, handling a wooden guitar
frame or shaking the hands of senior citizens and high school
students who have never heard of him, Bill Simon Jr. has a beatific
grin on his face that makes him look like a kid still thrilled with a
new toy.</LD>
<LD>   It's the same smile he had five months ago, when he sat at single
digits in the polls and was written off as the most unlikely major
candidate for governor in years. But even though his standing has
changed dramatically--Simon is even with or ahead of the erstwhile
front-runner in the Republican primary, former Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan--the rookie candidate has not.</LD>
<LD>   Simon still greets strangers at campaign events with the cry, "How
are you, buddy?"--though now some people recognize him. He keeps
talking about improving California's infrastructure, and, improbably,
seems enthusiastic about the topic. And whether he is talking about
his four children or attacking his friend Riordan on taxes, he
always, always smiles.</LD>
<TE>   "He may be a heck of a lot more polished than a lot of people
think," said Allan Hoffenblum, a veteran GOP analyst who backs
Riordan but says he has been impressed by Simon. "There's no doubt
he's disciplined; he stayed on track."</TE>
<TE>   Simon certainly brings his own set of quirks to campaign events.
When asked about issues he is not prepared to discuss--whether it is
extending health insurance or the behavior of the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power during the energy crisis--Simon will
confess he does not know enough to answer the question.</TE>
<TE>   He usually defers to other speakers at campaign events. On
Thursday, at a news conference to unveil an initiative to increase
the homeowners' tax exemption he is sponsoring with the Howard Jarvis
Taxpayer Assn., for example, Simon made only brief remarks before
giving most of the applause lines over to the anti-tax group's
president.</TE>
<TE>   And Simon has a penchant for unprompted quips, followed with a
slap on the back and a hearty laugh that overwhelms whatever response
he may elicit. At Garfield High School in East Los Angeles, he
marveled at how the principal could control her 4,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a hard enough time keeping track of four," the candidate
said. "What's your secret? Handcuffs?" he laughed.</TE>
<TE>   During a tour of Oakland's Chinatown, an Asian supporter pointed
out the number of banks and said Chinese people like saving money.</TE>
<TE>   "Not just gambling?" Simon quipped. He laughed again.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's handlers have cultivated the candidate's Boy Scout image,
repeatedly calling him "the candidate of ideas." Some were unnerved
when word of a mildly off-color joke of Simon's recently made it into
print.</TE>
<TE>   The Bill Simon the public is most likely to see is the one on
display Friday outside the Santa Monica cable television studio where
he had just taped an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by a swarm of reporters about how it feels to be seen as the
front-runner, wooed by the White House, Simon replied: "You have to
say, 'Wow.'</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to be happy, but you've got to say to yourself, 'Let's
stay with the campaign.' At the end of the day, I tell all our guys
and gals to stay humble and stay on message."</TE>
<TE>   The wide-eyed campaign persona also permeates Simon's television
ads.</TE>
<TE>   A soft-spoken Simon speaks directly to the camera--even when
attacking Riordan for his past support of Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's handlers say that they consciously chose to provide a
"softer" attack spot than is normal, believing that voters are turned
off by standard negative commercials and want a more positive tone.</TE>
<TE>   The handlers also wanted voters to get a long look at Simon, even
if it is filtered through the television screen.</TE>
<TE>   "With Bill, they look at him and say he's honest," spokesman Jamie
Fisfis said. "He's a very disciplined candidate. It helps that he's
actually passionate about what he's saying.... He has become a very
skilled candidate in that regard."</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, Simon, a Pacific Palisades financier who has never
before run for elected office, has proved to be a smoother campaigner
than Riordan, who despite his eight years in elected office has been
knocked off message repeatedly in the last few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Simon is on message even when no one cares.</TE>
<TE>   At a senior citizens center in Hollywood last month, he circled
the room shaking the hands of silver-haired men and women who were
clearly more interested in their lunches.</TE>
<TE>   It was not a friendly crowd for a self-proclaimed "conservative
Republican"--some booed when President Bush's name was mentioned.</TE>
<TE>   The senior citizens ate their lunches and chatted with one another
during Simon's speech.</TE>
<TE>   "If you remember one thing today about Bill Simon," he said, "it's
that I'm the one who will lower taxes."</TE>
<TE>   This week he found more receptive audiences on a tour of small
businesses that he said would prosper under his economic stimulus
plan--largely a capital gains tax cut, coupled with rolling back
regulations and reforming workers' compensation.</TE>
<TE>   He also demonstrated one thing that has changed in his
campaign--its pace. It used to be that Simon held one public event a
day and answered questions until there were none left.</TE>
<TE>   In the final days of the race, he is dashing up and down the
state. Today, he has five public events.</TE>
<TE>   At Burbank's Cardona Manufacturing on Wednesday, Simon slid from
his car and studiously ignored the chanting Riordan supporters toting
anti-Simon signs.</TE>
<TE>   It was his second stop of the day, but Simon's trademark dark suit
was smooth, his American flag tie smartly knotted.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the small plant, Simon--television cameras in tow--got a
brief tour of the space where the 25-employee company makes small
airplane parts.</TE>
<TE>   Before Simon left, owner Louis Cardona gave him a toy F-22.</TE>
<TE>   When he pushed a button and a red light lit up in the cockpit,
Simon's eyes flashed as well. "My son is going to like this," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The next stop, G&amp;L Guitar in Fullerton, at first glance seemed
like an unlikely stop for a conservative Republican candidate.</TE>
<TE>   One sticker in the window featured a woman in a bikini straddling
an electric guitar.</TE>
<TE>   But Simon got a warm greeting from the plant manager and a
camera-ready tour of the workshops inside.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a beauty," Simon said in an awed voice as he watched a
craftsman work on a handmade, cherry-red electric guitar.</TE>
<TE>   He ably switched from craft connoisseur to glad-hander, shaking
every available hand in the woodshop, including that of a man with a
shaved head who called himself Reno and said he was in a local band
called Mister Meringue.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, as reporters peppered Simon with questions about
his frequent failure to vote in Republican primaries and Riordan's
criticism of his inherited wealth, the candidate calmly dealt with
the inquiries, smile still on his face.</TE>
<TE>   A nervous aide, eye on his watch, announced that there would be no
more questions.</TE>
<TE>   One more was shouted out--did Simon vote for Ronald Reagan, one of
his self-proclaimed heroes, in 1980?</TE>
<TE>   Simon gave his hearty laugh, smiled and waved. He ducked into his
car, and rode off.</TE>

<HD>Tustin Gets Base; School Talks Continue</HD>
<DH>Development: The Navy will give up its former helicopter
site. Santa Ana Unified hasn't approved an offer yet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Navy officials agreed late Thursday to give most of the closed Tustin
helicopter base to the city of Tustin, but tense negotiations
continue with the Santa Ana Unified School District, which wants part
of the land.</LD>
<LD>   The Navy will transfer the property even if Tustin cannot make a
deal with Santa Ana Unified, said Tustin City Manager William A.
Huston. But he said he hopes a pact would be ready to bring Monday to
trustees of Santa Ana Unified and Rancho Santiago Community College
District. The college district reached a tentative agreement this
week for part of the land.</LD>
<LD>   Settling the dispute "is in everyone's best interests," Huston
said Friday before rejoining the negotiations. "We're prepared to do
whatever it takes."</LD>
<TE>   Even though the Navy will give the land to Tustin, any attempt to
use it would be blocked by state law unless the city shares with the
schools. Under a law that took effect Jan. 1, Tustin cannot zone or
develop the 1,600-acre base unless the city gives 100 acres to the
Santa Ana districts or agrees to a different settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The law also complicates the Navy's plan to sell 240 acres of the
base for new homes and use the money to help pay for base closures
slated for 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin officials filed suit last week saying the state statute
interferes with the federal base-disposal process. But pursuing the
suit could tie up base development for years and would be costly to
the city, the districts and the military, Huston said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Tustin officials on Friday applauded the agreement with the
Navy as the first step in transforming the former Tustin Marine Corps
Helicopter Air Station, which closed in July 1999, into homes, a golf
course, schools, parks and businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "This signing was a huge milestone that we've been waiting a long
time for," Councilwoman Tracy Wills Worley said. "At the end of the
day, we've all had to compromise."</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Santiago college district officials agreed Thursday to
accept Tustin's offer of 15 acres within a 100-acre parcel called the
Learning Village that Tustin intended to give to the South Orange
County Community College District.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 22 acres in the same area have been offered to Santa
Ana Unified, plus $38 million from Tustin to the district for
purchase of land elsewhere to build a high school. The district has
had trouble finding suitable sites in Santa Ana, which has little
remaining undeveloped land.</TE>
<TE>   Possible contamination of those acres has been the sticking point
for months between Santa Ana Unified officials and Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Unified officials want assurances that the designated 22
acres can pass rigorous tests required by the state Department of
Toxic Substances Control for potential school sites.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want to make sure that the deal makes sense for the
students and families of Santa Ana," Supt. Al Mijares said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been at this for four days, and I think we've made a lot of
progress. But we haven't resolved it."</TE>
<TE>   Mijares said he will meet with Tustin officials Monday to continue
hammering out details.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin and the Santa Ana school districts have been at odds for
eight years over the districts' request for property on the base, a
corner of which is within their boundaries.</TE>

<HD>Man Is Guilty in Sinking of Yacht</HD>
<DH>Courts: A Beverly Hills lawyer scuttled the vessel off
Italy in 1992 in a $3.5-million insurance scam. He said it was the
work of drug smugglers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Beverly Hills lawyer who claimed that his luxury yacht was seized
and scuttled by drug runners on its maiden voyage off the coast of
Italy was convicted Friday of insurance fraud.</LD>
<LD>   A Los Angeles federal court jury found that Rex K. DeGeorge
concocted the tale of piracy on the high seas in order to bilk the
vessel's insurance carrier out of $3.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   DeGeorge was not in court when the jury returned its guilty
verdicts on all 16 criminal counts against him. A defense lawyer told
U.S. District Judge Lourdes G. Baird that the 65-year-old defendant
was undergoing surgery to clear a clogged coronary artery.</LD>
<TE>   DeGeorge, who remains free on $700,000 bond, is facing a maximum
of 80 years in prison when he is sentenced May 13.</TE>
<TE>   "The greatest insurance scam artist in the history of California
has been found guilty. It's a good day," said Neil Lerner, an
insurance company lawyer who won a federal civil action against
DeGeorge in connection with the yacht's sinking.</TE>
<TE>   DeGeorge has a history of losing yachts on the open seas and then
collecting on the insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the jury just couldn't get past the fact of the prior
losses," defense attorney Mark Geragos said after the verdict. "That
was a hump that we just couldn't get over."</TE>
<TE>   The criminal case against DeGeorge dates from 1992, when he bought
the Principe di Pictor, a top-of-the-line 76-foot motor yacht, for
$1.9 million in cash from an Italian shipbuilder.</TE>
<TE>   Before taking out insurance on the vessel, prosecutors alleged,
DeGeorge orchestrated a series of sham financial transactions that
inflated the boat's value to $3.5 million and concealed his
ownership.</TE>
<TE>   Lerner, acting on behalf of Cigna Property and Casualty Co.,
investigated and unraveled the scheme. The insurance company refused
to pay and got a federal judge to rescind the policy on grounds that
DeGeorge had concealed his claims record.</TE>
<TE>   The judge who tried the case was so outraged by what he heard that
he referred the matter to the U.S. attorney's office for a criminal
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, DeGeorge and two associates were indicted in 1999 on
charges of trying to sink the yacht in order to collect on the
inflated insurance policy.</TE>
<TE>   Paul A. Ebeling, 62, of St. Louis, and Gabriel Falco, 36, of
Amagansett, N.Y., later pleaded guilty in the case and testified
against DeGeorge in the three-week trial.</TE>
<TE>   Ebeling and Falco said they and DeGeorge used electric drills and
saws to cut holes in the Principe's fiberglass hull through the night
of Nov. 7, 1992, in international waters about 50 miles from Naples.</TE>
<TE>   But the plot went awry when an Italian coast guard cutter happened
upon the yacht while it was still afloat the next morning.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing that their scuttling efforts would be discovered, they
tossed the power tools overboard and climbed into two dinghies as the
cutter drew closer.</TE>
<TE>   DeGeorge, meanwhile, sketched out a story to tell their rescuers.
It went like this:</TE>
<TE>   After taking delivery of the yacht in Viareggio, DeGeorge hired an
Italian captain to sail the vessel south to Naples and then to
Greece. When they reached Naples, the captain quit in a dispute over
money.</TE>
<TE>   Scrambling to find a replacement, they were befriended by a
stranger who identified himself as Capt. Andrea Libovich, a former
Russian submariner. He agreed to take them to Greece with the help of
two crewmates.</TE>
<TE>   While on the open seas, however, Libovich and his cohorts pulled
guns on the Americans, locking them in a compartment below deck.</TE>
<TE>   DeGeorge suggested that Libovich might be a member of a smuggling
ring that wanted the yacht to run drugs into Italy. But when the
Russian captain realized that the Principe wasn't fast enough to
outrun the Italian coast guard, he and his men tried to sink her by
cutting holes in the hull.</TE>
<TE>   The pirates fled in a black speedboat that picked them up and
headed toward the Libyan coast before the Italian cutter arrived,
according to DeGeorge.</TE>
<TE>   From the outset, the Italian coast guard was suspicious about the
Americans' account, Assistant U.S. Atty. Eileen Decker told the Los
Angeles jury.</TE>
<TE>   Decker said the Americans had not bothered to use the Principe's
working radio transmitter to summon help after the pirates departed.
Also, they didn't seem particularly happy to see their rescuers, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   After towing the Principe back to port, Italian authorities placed
DeGeorge, Ebeling and Falco under house arrest while investigators
looked into their story.</TE>
<TE>   "They found no evidence that Libovich ever existed," Decker said.</TE>
<TE>   But no charges were filed, and Italian authorities eventually let
the Americans go.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Geragos said Italian authorities turned against
DeGeorge only after receiving false information through a U.S. law
enforcement attache in Rome that his client had been linked to an
international drug-smuggling ring.</TE>
<TE>   With DeGeorge as their principal target, he said, the Italians
made no effort to look for Libovich.</TE>
<TE>   "Libovich was real," Geragos told the jury.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, he said, they tore apart the Principe "piece, by piece,
by piece," searching for drugs. The vessel had sustained about
$50,000 damage at sea, and it was a total wreck by the time Italian
drug agents finished with it, Geragos said. The vessel sank in port.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos also challenged the prosecution's claim that DeGeorge
artificially inflated the Principe's value when he arranged for it to
be insured.</TE>
<TE>   He said the vessel was originally listed for sale at $3.5 million,
but that DeGeorge managed to get the price down to $1.9 million
through skillful negotiations and by taking advantage of wild
fluctuations in the Italian currency exchange rate.</TE>
<TE>   DeGeorge did not take the stand during his trial.</TE>
<TE>   Baird allowed prosecutors to mention DeGeorge's previous yacht
sinkings, but barred them from presenting details of those incidents
because it might prejudice the jury.</TE>
<TE>   According to civil court records not introduced in the trial,
DeGeorge filed 32 property loss claims with various insurance
carriers from 1976 to 1990, three of which were for the sinking of
yachts he owned.</TE>
<TE>   In 1970, he reported that his 43-foot yacht was stolen off the
coast of Los Angeles by a couple of Peruvian coffee merchants who had
expressed an interest in buying it. On an overnight test run, he
said, the Peruvians drugged him and a companion. When the couple came
to, DeGeorge said, they escaped in the yacht's dinghy. Five days
later, DeGeorge reported the loss to police. No trace was found of
the yacht or the Peruvians. DeGeorge received $43,000, the full
policy value, from Hartford Insurance Co.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, DeGeorge bought a 57-foot racing yacht and went sailing
with Ebeling off the coast of Italy. About midnight on a starless,
moonless night, he said, they struck "a low-profile dark object that
was not visible." DeGeorge and Ebeling escaped in a dinghy just
before the vessel sank. Lloyds of London at first declined his claim
but paid $194,000 after DeGeorge threatened to sue.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, DeGeorge collected $245,000 in insurance money after
claiming that his 47-foot yacht was blown up in a failed
assassination attempt off the Southern California coast. He told
Fireman's Fund that the attempt on his life grew out of a rancorous
business lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   DeGeorge and his wife managed to escape in a dinghy before the
yacht sank. He did not report the episode to law enforcement
authorities when he got back to Marina del Rey, but four days later
he filed an insurance claim.</TE>

<LD>March Madness is not just about college basketball. It also describes
the state's election system. California voters will go to the polls
Tuesday to nominate candidates for the November general election,
then endure eight more months of political ads and mailings, eight
more months of desperate fund-raising, eight ridiculously long months
of grasping for public attention. To say nothing of the fact that
voters are paying almost no attention to a primary conducted this
early.</LD>
<LD>   California is in this absurd situation because of the rush in
recent years to give the state some say in the presidential selection
process, moving the primary earlier and earlier to get ahead of other
states. For the sake of consistency, the primary is held in March
even in years like this one, in which there is no presidential
primary.</LD>
<LD>   Enter state Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine), who has a plan for a
return to sanity. He has introduced a bill to move the primary
election to the second week in September and to hold a separate
presidential primary in March every four years. September may be a
little late for primary elections in such a big state, but Johnson is
certainly on the right track with his bill, SB 1975.</LD>
<TE>   For half a century, California held its presidential and state
primaries in early June. Time and again, the presidential nominations
were sewn up before that, and the state's votes were irrelevant. The
Legislature moved the primary to the third week in March for the 1996
election, but it made no difference. Too many states jumped to even
earlier election dates.</TE>
<TE>   So California moved its primary to the first week in March in
2000, but with marginal impact at best on the nomination process. It
also ended up stuck with a far-too-early state primary. So it's up to
the state to split the primaries, despite a bit of added expense.
This two-primary system, with nonpresidential voting in September, is
used in New York, Connecticut, Florida, Washington and Arizona, among
several other states.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, California had dual primaries from 1912 until 1944--a
presidential primary in May and the regular state primary at the end
of August. The primaries were then combined and moved to the first
week in June. Alfie Charles of the secretary of state's office says
the archives indicate that the major reason was to save money, and
perhaps to help voters in the armed services. But no one then
envisioned holding the primary as early as March.</TE>
<TE>   Officials expect a low voter turnout Tuesday. And Johnson makes
the valid point that many potential candidates aren't running because
they would have had to declare their candidacies more than a year
before the general election and start raising money.</TE>
<TE>   There's no accurate estimate of the cost of holding a separate
primary in presidential years. One guess made in the 1990s was as
much as $40 million. But the cost should become less as newer, more
efficient voting systems are adopted. The cost of the present setup
can't be measured, but it is calculated in voter apathy--wasting the
very currency of democracy.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As any insomniac who has listened to a TV station's early morning
sign-off knows, broadcasters are licensed by the Federal
Communications Commission to operate "in the public interest.'' Not
that you'd know that by watching the programming.</LD>
<LD>   A study released last week by the Kaiser Family Foundation found
broadcasters retreating from commitments to public service that they
made just before Congress handed them a set of regulatory breaks in
the mid-1990s. Among these commitments was running more public
service announcements--educational messages often produced by
nonprofit groups, of the sort that helped increase seat belt use and
reduce drunk driving.</LD>
<LD>   The study is unfortunate proof that the FCC and its chairman,
Michael K. Powell, take their oversight duties too lightly. The
analysis, titled "Shouting to Be Heard," found that while 20% of all
TV air time is devoted to paid commercials, only 0.4% of all TV air
time goes to public service announcements, and almost half of these
announcements air between midnight and 6 a.m.</LD>
<TE>   One FCC commissioner, Michael J. Copps, responded that if
broadcasters didn't improve their public interest efforts there would
"be a reaction." That's uselessly vague, but Copps did note that TV
station "license renewal has become pretty much a postcard affair"
for the FCC, and he said that in the future the commission should
conduct "a somewhat more rigorous examination" of how each station
met its public interest requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Even in such a bashfully modest proposal, Copps faces opposition
from at least two fellow commissioners, Kathleen Q. Abernathy and
Kevin J. Martin, who say that any public interest requirement
violates broadcasters' 1st Amendment free-speech rights.</TE>
<TE>   Public service announcements are part of a larger public service
issue that includes whether broadcasters should have to offer
discounts to political candidates for ads during campaigns. Abernathy
and Martin have aligned themselves with Senate Minority Leader Trent
Lott (R-Miss.), who leads the opposition to any enforced public
service, particularly involving campaigns. The current system favors
incumbents, who usually have established fund-raising networks.
"We're going about [campaign reform] all wrong," Lott argued. "I
prefer a fundamental approach.... It's called freedom."</TE>
<TE>   Not all political candidates, however, will agree that freedom
means spending $750 million each election cycle to reach the American
people, who supposedly own the airwaves.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators intent on deregulation at all costs have turned public
ownership into fiction, with help from Congress. The Kaiser study
illuminates just a part of the problem.</TE>

<LD>Quietly, with not much more than local debate, criticism and news
coverage little noticed beyond each state, most of the nation's
governors have now given their 2002 State of the State addresses,
laying out detailed economic, educational, social and political
blueprints for the next year or so. In many ways these plans,
carefully sculpted and staged statements of political and financial
intent, have far more practical impact on American lives than a
president's closely chronicled State of the Union shopping list each
January.</LD>
<TE>   State of the State speeches provide useful, comprehensive insights
into the political priorities of governments closest to American
citizens after this country's worst act of terrorism. What emerges
strikingly from dozens of speeches is the presence of familiar social
and financial challenges and the actual absence of unease or panic, a
comforting sense of normalcy, resolve and continuum less than 180
days after 9/11. To be sure, every governor acknowledges that now
infamous date, usually introducing an audience member who helped
recovery efforts or a soldier newly returned from Afghanistan--and
noting increased security costs. But the dominant themes were
perennials. The budget: Virtually every state confronts a deficit
with revenues below projections and spending above. Virtually every
state is choosing to address the squeeze by carefully apportioned
spending cuts, not revenue increases (except for tobacco taxes, still
fair game). Education: This is always a top professed priority. Many
governors cited improved test scores and vowed new investments, with
South Carolina's Jim Hodges even proposing a copy of Tom Brokaw's
book "The Greatest Generation" for every child. The worst cost
overruns are in health care, primarily likely-to-be-cut Medicaid, the
state-federal health insurance program for 39 million poor. Even cost
saving is traditional: hiring freezes, delayed spending and
maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   The speeches are important rituals, setting a state's political
agenda for debate and action while providing a measuring rod for
citizens and media. Interestingly, a new study by the Stateline.org
Web site, which analyzes state governments, revealed that governors
are far more effective than presidents in achieving their annual
speech objectives, even though four of the last five presidents had
been governors. Modern voters do like doers when choosing chief
executives. But ex-governors find that managing an immense federal
bureaucracy and complex, less personal legislative relationships is a
lot harder than operating in down-home state capitals where the
players run into each other at Rotary lunches and high school
basketball games.</TE>

<HD>Disabled Decry Plan to Alter Ride Service</HD>
<DH>Transit: As demand soars, board seeks to raise fares for
those who don't make reservations a day in advance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many disabled residents are incensed by proposed changes in a service
that provides van and car rides throughout Los Angeles County. If
approved by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the changes
will mean higher prices and less flexibility for those who depend on
the service.</LD>
<LD>   This week, the board of Access Services, a nonprofit organization
that runs the service, approved a plan that would require riders to
pay more unless they reserve rides at least one day in advance.</LD>
<LD>   Board members say the changes are needed to accommodate a growing
demand for the service. The MTA board, which provides the
organization's funding, will vote on the proposal in April.</LD>
<TE>   Access Services has a fleet of 400 sedans and vans equipped with
lifts that are dispatched all over the county to transport disabled
people. Currently, users can call dispatchers 24 hours a day and give
as little as 45 minutes' notice before they need a ride. Cost is
based on the distance traveled--from $1.50 to $4.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposed changes, similar rates would apply only to
rides reserved at least a day in advance. Same-day rides would cost
$15 regardless of distance. Hours that dispatchers are available
would also be limited.</TE>
<TE>   Changing the service would save $9.8 million to $13.8 million,
said Access Services Director Richard DeRock.</TE>
<TE>   The savings are needed to ensure that the organization can meet
growing demand while providing at least the level of service required
by federal law, he said.</TE>
<TE>   When the MTA approved Access Services' five-year plan and budget
last year, the agency planned for 5% annual growth. But since last
year, the number of trips has increased by 30%.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not so much a budget issue as it is we have riders coming
out of our ears," DeRock said at a recent meeting of an Access
Services advisory committee.</TE>
<TE>   "We're proposing these changes because we can't see a way to make
this financial situation work."</TE>
<TE>   Many who use the service are unhappy. At one recent meeting of the
Access Services board, nearly 60 disabled commuters--some zooming up
to the podium in electric wheelchairs, others struggling with speech
impediments--made impassioned pleas to maintain same-day service at
current prices.</TE>
<TE>   ''The removal of same-day ridership will be devastating to the
Access rider population,'' said Kurt Hagen, a user of the service.
''What if you were told you couldn't drive your car unless you
reserved it the day before, and if you did use it on the same day,
you had to pay a higher price for gas? That's roughly the equivalent
of what's being imposed on us.''</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Russell, a peer counselor at Southern California
Rehabilitation Services, said 1,200 of her center's clients need
same-day service but will not be able to afford it. Their average
income is about $800 a month, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "People can't always plan 24 hours in advance," Russell said.
"What if people get sick and want to go home from work? They can't do
that."</TE>

<HD>Bill Makes Transit Funds Hinge on El Toro Airport</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A powerful Democratic assemblyman from the South Bay wants the state
Legislature to approve a bill that would withhold transportation
money from any Southern California county that doesn't provide enough
airport space.</LD>
<LD>   The bill doesn't mention Orange County specifically but would
apply if the county doesn't build an airport at the closed El Toro
Marine base to handle nearly 30 million passengers a year by 2025. It
was introduced as county voters prepare to decide Tuesday whether to
scuttle plans for an airport and rezone El Toro for a large park.</LD>
<LD>   Assemblyman George Nakano (D-Torrance), who also chairs the
Assembly Democratic caucus, introduced the bill Feb. 21--one day
before the deadline for submitting bills for this legislative
session.</LD>
<TE>   The threshold for El Toro passengers comes from a 25-year forecast
for regional airport growth approved last year by the Southern
California Assn. of Governments. John Wayne Airport was set at
8.4-million passengers a year--its current limit, which county
supervisors hope to boost to 9.8 million in the next 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   The SCAG plan also capped Los Angeles International Airport at 78
million, a move made after intense lobbying by Los Angeles and state
representatives to shift airport growth to outlying areas. The
forecast for Ontario International Airport, which handled about 6.5
million passengers last year and is owned by Los Angeles, was 30
million.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going after Orange County, but it's high time someone
other than the residents of El Segundo, Manhattan Beach and Hermosa
Beach bear the burden for planes flying over their heads," said Becky
Ames, Nakano's chief of staff. "Southern California has put together
a plan and it should be followed."</TE>
<TE>   If approved, the bill would cut off funds approved through the
state every two years for certain transportation projects. Last year,
a total of $340 million was available statewide.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the Orange County Transportation Authority has asked
for $18 million, including $8million to add an auxiliary lane on the
westbound Riverside Freeway, $5 million for a new Metrolink station
in Yorba Linda, $3 million to expand parking at the Fullerton
Metrolink station and $2 million in rail improvements in Placentia.
The California Transportation Commission will vote on the request
next month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sad commentary to mix transportation funds with the
airport in a desperate act to thwart the will of the people here in
Orange County," said Susan Withrow, an OCTA board member and
councilwoman in Mission Viejo, which opposes the new airport.</TE>
<TE>   El Segundo Mayor Mike Gordon, who pushed for the bill--designated
AB2333--said the SCAG plan was approved by city and county
representatives across Southern California except for two council
members from south Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "It is critical that Orange County be a full player in meeting
their aviation demand for Southern California," he said. "If they
don't, there should be consequences."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Chuck Smith, an El Toro airport supporter and an OCTA
board member, said he was briefed on the bill in his role as a member
of the Southern California Regional Airport Authority. The bill
allows the authority to review airports and counties for compliance
with the SCAG forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   Because of his multiple roles, Smith said he doesn't support the
bill--but he won't oppose it either. He has long argued that Orange
County should handle more of the estimated 7 million local passengers
a year who use LAX or Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   ''The problem is that this kind of [sanction] is going to happen,
and it's going to happen at the federal level too,'' Smith said. "The
citizens of Orange County have to wake up that we have to do these
kinds of things, like build a new airport. It's not this, 'I've got
mine, so stay out of my area' kind of thing."</TE>

<HD>Depicting a Catholic Order Buffeted, Like the Church
Itself, by Change</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch, a contributing writer for the Los
Angeles Times Book Review, is the author of, most recently, "The
Woman Who Laughed at God: The Untold History of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Perhaps the most startling revelation in "Passionate Uncertainty:
Inside the American Jesuits"--one that sums up all the stresses that
afflict the single largest male order in Catholicism--is the simple
fact that former Jesuits now outnumber active Jesuits in the United
States.</LD>
<LD>   "The crushing demographics are wrapped in mystery," write Peter
McDonough and Eugene C. Bianchi with a sense of drama that enlivens
their whole scholarly enterprise. "Nearly 500 years of existence make
for tradition as mundane institutions go, yet the tradition itself
appears to be curiously unstable."</LD>
<LD>   The Society of Jesus dates back to the 16th century, when it was
founded by Ignatius of Loyola as a missionary order whose special
calling eventually focused on the education of youth around the
world. The order was suppressed by a distrustful pope in 1773,
restored after the French Revolution and revolutionized by the
sweeping reforms of the Second Vatican Council in 1963. "By 1965,
when the council drew to a close, the Jesuits were at their peak,
with more than 35,000 men around the world, about 8,500 of whom were
Americans," observe the authors of "Passionate Uncertainty." "Even
then, however, signs of trouble were detectable."</LD>
<TE>   The Jesuits have been buffeted by the same crosscurrents that have
been eroding the foundation of the rest of traditional Catholicism
over the last several decades, including the struggle for social
justice embodied in so-called "liberation theology," the activism of
lay Catholics who demanded both a greater role in the governance of
the church and a greater degree of freedom in the governance of their
private lives, and the "self-absorption [and] soft-boiled
spirituality" that the authors dub "designer Catholicism." Some
Jesuits work to change the church from the inside, some resist the
forces of change, but many more have simply walked away. A generation
after Vatican II, the membership of the order has declined to 20,000
or so, and fewer than 4,000 of them are Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "So, the tightly woven subculture of the Society of Jesus has
unraveled into a melange of countercultures," the authors sum up.
"The connection between who Jesuits are and what they do remains
unsettled."</TE>
<TE>   "Passionate Uncertainty" is based on a study of some 400 current
and former Jesuits. McDonough, a political science professor at
Arizona State University, and Bianchi, professor emeritus of religion
at Emory University, explain their data with intellectual elegance
and a lively rhetorical style. They have a gift for summing up a
complex idea in a few deft words, while allowing their informants to
express what has befallen the order in poignant words of their own.</TE>
<TE>   Some priests, for example, suggest that they would have made very
different decisions about their vocations if they had only enjoyed
the freedom of choice that now prevails among otherwise pious
Catholics: "I wanted to be either a priest or a baseball player,"
explains a 69-year-old former Jesuit who left the order after a
quarter-century. "Looking back, I sense that a feeling of free
decision in this area just evaporated."</TE>
<TE>   Other priests bemoan the loss of old traditions: "I hate the fact
that we have dropped clerical dress and are embarrassed to be
recognized as priests," says a priest who remains a Jesuit after 50
years in the order. "I hate the sloppy way we do liturgy, the fact
that liturgical vessels are now cheap five-and-dime glassware. I hate
the fact that liturgical music is just guitar music. But I still love
God and the church and try to say a public Mass as reverently as I
can despite the liturgical chaos."</TE>
<TE>   Today, many Jesuits live in what the authors call "tacit dissent"
against the refusal of the Roman Catholic Church to ordain women as
priests, for example, or to soften the strictures against birth
control. As the Catholic population increases--and the membership of
the order decreases--the schools that have always been the raison
d'etre of the Jesuits are "increasingly staffed and run by laymen and
laywomen," report McDonough and Bianchi. Between the cross hairs of
these conflicts are the Jesuits themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "The Jesuits are in a bind," the authors conclude. "They cannot go
back, insofar as that course would entail a return to clerical
dominance in an age of lay ascendancy. But they cannot move forward
without placing their clerical identity at risk."</TE>
<TE>   "Passionate Uncertainty" does not end on a note of gloom. The
authors suggest that the sheer diversity of belief and practice
within the order offers its best chance of survival--and a sure sign
that the Jesuits will continue to come up with surprising changes in
their own identity and function. "Spiritually, Jesuits have
reinvented themselves," the authors sum up. "The result is remarkable
longevity and low predictability."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The baggage claim area in Terminal 3 at Los Angeles International
Airport was evacuated for an hour Friday after an airport employee
spotted an unattended bag near a concrete pillar on the lower level
roadway.</LD>
<LD>   Vehicle traffic on the lower level was diverted about 3:10 p.m.,
while the Los Angeles Police Department bomb squad checked the bag.
An hour later, the bomb squad cleared the bag, which turned out to be
a carrying case with a camera inside, an airport spokeswoman said. No
identification was found on the bag.</LD>
<LD>   The evacuation was the fifth in as many days at the world's
third-busiest airport. Three of the five incidents occurred because
travelers had left their bags behind.</LD>

<HD>Campus' Finishing Touches</HD>
<DH>Recovery: Cal State Northridge hopes to complete repairs
from 1994 quake with $12 million in projects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE STASSEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has been eight years since an earthquake devastated Cal State
Northridge, and campus officials hope $12 million in new construction
projects will wrap up the last of quake-related repairs by fall.</LD>
<LD>   Major roads will be resurfaced, open spaces will be restored to
their natural green state and remaining portable classrooms will be
removed as part of the finishing touches of Cal State Northridge's
$408-million earthquake recovery, most of it paid with funds from the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.</LD>
<LD>   "In terms of campus appearance and inconvenience, it will look
like more construction is being done--it won't look like it is
waning," said campus architect Deborah Wylie. "But when it's done,
the campus will have a brightened, enhanced appearance."</LD>
<TE>   As part of the projects, six 11-foot-high brick signs bearing the
school's name will be installed at intersections along Nordhoff
Street and a soccer field will be added to the east side of campus.
Soccer players currently use the football field at North Campus
Stadium, which is soon to be torn down.</TE>
<TE>   With all classes back in permanent buildings, the remaining
portable classrooms, as well as the white "domes" that once housed
the library and the admissions and records department, will be
removed. Several lawns on which the temporary buildings were
constructed will get new grass, trees and lighting.</TE>
<TE>   To accommodate paving crews, traffic on portions of Lindley
Avenue, Plummer Street and Etiwanda Avenue will be limited to one way
from May until possibly October. Landscaped medians will be added and
some campus streets will get curbs and gutters for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   But even after these projects are finished, students and
professors won't get a respite from the construction sights and
sounds that have plagued the campus for so many years. Work on
several major buildings and a parking structure is to continue
through 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Construction began in January of four swimming pools next to the
Center of Achievement for the Physically Disabled, where Cal State
Northridge students provide low-cost exercise therapy for 400
disabled people.</TE>
<TE>   The new Abbott and Linda Brown Western Center for Adaptive Aquatic
Therapy will include a heated pool with underwater treadmills, a
large whirlpool spa, a cool water pool for heat-sensitive people and
the West Coast's first movable-floor pool, which will be able to
change depth to accommodate wheelchair users.</TE>
<TE>   Once the $4.5-million facility opens, the center will be able to
serve twice as many people.</TE>
<TE>   "It will probably be the model for the nation as to what a
university can do for the community," Director Sam Britten said.</TE>
<TE>   In May, construction is to begin on the $7.8-million Sierra
Center, which will have two floors for food services as well as
offices for University Corp., which manages commercial ventures on
campus.</TE>
<TE>   In June, work is to start on a new $14-million parking structure
with nearly 1,400 spaces that will be funded with parking permit
fees.</TE>
<TE>   In late summer, a $15-million renovation of the student union
building is to begin. Funding will come from student fee increases of
$35 a semester.</TE>
<TE>   And if the Los Angeles Unified School District board gives its
approval next month, construction of a $35-million, 870-student
academy for high school students interested in pursuing teaching
careers will start in August.</TE>

<HD>CSU Strike Appears Unlikely as Talks Progress</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The prospect of a strike by Cal State University faculty members
appeared to fade Friday as both sides in the contract talks reported
major progress in negotiating a three-year labor pact.</LD>
<LD>   Officials with the California Faculty Assn., which negotiates for
the university's 22,000 teachers, librarians and psychological
counselors, will meet this afternoon in Los Angeles to review
proposals and possibly vote on a tentative agreement.</LD>
<LD>   Union representatives and CSU administrators cautioned Friday that
various contract issues still need to be resolved, although they
declined to specify which ones.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a very sensitive moment in the negotiations," said union
spokeswoman Alice Sunshine.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the possibility of a tentative agreement, Sunshine said,
"We could have it now, or we could blow it now."</TE>
<TE>   CSU spokeswoman Colleen Bentley-Adler gave a similar assessment.
"There's been a lot of progress, but there are a couple of hitches,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   A breakthrough in the long-acrimonious negotiations came with the
delivery of a neutral fact-finder's report early this week. Although
few details were provided, officials said the report provided
possible compromises on key issues.</TE>
<TE>   The state's budget crunch, a result of California's economic
slowdown, also has pushed the administration and the union toward a
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The union initially sought a 5.7% pay increase this year but has
moved toward accepting the 2% raise proposed by CSU. For full-time
employees, the union pay scale now ranges from $41,940 for an
assistant professor to $90,804 for a full professor.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials have balked at union proposals for
expanded medical benefits for part-time faculty members, increased
stipends for department chairs and pay increases for new professors
moving up the ladder toward tenure.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders have repeatedly threatened to strike over what they
called the lack of progress in the talks to replace the previous
three-year contract, which expired June 30.</TE>
<TE>   The union has aimed much of its criticism directly at CSU
Chancellor Charles B. Reed, maintaining that since he took the helm
of the 22-campus system in 1998 the administration has hardened its
positions in contract talks and other labor-related matters.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last month, the union has set up picket lines protesting
Reed's leadership at five events where the chancellor spoke,
including a session in New York and another, on Tuesday, at Cal State
Dominguez Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The California Faculty Assn., founded in 1978, has never gone on
strike over a contract dispute. The last large-scale walkouts by CSU
faculty members came in the late 1960s, when strikes were staged to
protest the nation's involvement in the Vietnam War.</TE>
<TE>   The rising hope that a strike will be averted and a tentative
contract agreement reached was a relief to Martin Fiebert, a
psychology professor at Cal State Long Beach and president of the
campus chapter of the faculty union.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been putting a lot of energy into preparing for a strike
authorization vote at each of our campuses, but we'd all be relieved
not to take that action," Fiebert said. "It would be a lot better for
everyone, from the faculty to the administration to the students."</TE>

<HD>Yun Tau Chee, 73; Miss Hawaii of 1948, First Asian in Miss
America Pageant</HD>

<LD>Yun Tau Chee, who as the first Miss Hawaii helped break the color
barrier in the Miss America pageant, died Feb. 21 in Kailua, Hawaii.
She was 73 and had cancer of the duodenum.</LD>
<LD>   Chee was the runner-up in the first Miss Hawaii contest in 1948
and took the crown after the winner was disqualified for not having
enough high school credits.</LD>
<LD>   Later that year, Chee, whose ancestry was Chinese, traveled to
Atlantic City, N.J., for the Miss America pageant, becoming the first
Asian American contestant.</LD>
<TE>   The pageant, founded in 1921, had a long history of racial
exclusion. Sometime during the 1930s, a rule was adopted specifying
that contestants "must be of good health and of the white race."
Until at least 1940, all contestants had to complete a biological
data sheet that asked them to outline their lineage.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in 1941, Mifauny Shunatona, a Native American from Oklahoma,
was admitted to the pageant. In 1945, Bess Myerson became the first
Jewish Miss America. Three years later, Chee and Irma Nydia Vasquez
from Puerto Rico pushed the ethnic boundaries further when they
joined the pageant.</TE>
<TE>   More than two decades would pass before the pageant had its first
black contestant, Cheryl Brown of Iowa, in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   Chee was born Yun Tau Zane in Kohala, Hawaii. She was a
20-year-old home economics major at the University of Hawaii when she
won the Miss Hawaii title. She vied for Miss America because she
hoped to earn money for college.</TE>
<TE>   She learned the hula from Hawaiian hula master Winona Beamer and
performed the dance for the talent portion of the national pageant
wearing a holoku, a traditional Hawaiian fitted gown with a flowing
train.</TE>
<TE>   People were "intrigued that I didn't trip on the train," she
recalled in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Having grown up among the many cultures that make up Hawaiian
society, she was not aware she was making history as the pageant's
first entrant of Asian ancestry, according to her husband, Hon Ting
Chee. "Being from Hawaii, she didn't have any idea of the
discrimination on the mainland," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But she was greeted warmly by the other contestants. "They were
all together for the same purpose," he said, "so they were friendly
to her."</TE>
<TE>   Although Chee did not win the national title, she was named Miss
Congeniality, which came with a $1,000 scholarship. After graduating
from the University of Hawaii, she earned her teaching certificate at
the University of Wisconsin. She taught kindergarten in Hawaii for 33
years, retiring in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   She and her husband had four sons, including twins who died of
cancer within months of each other. She is survived by sons Derrick
and Brandon, three brothers and three sisters.</TE>

<HD>Now That's a Joyful Noise</HD>
<DH>Didja hear the one about the Christian comedian? It's no
joke--religious humor is a growing trend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARSHALL ALLEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"There are a lot of misconceptions about what it means to be a
born-again Christian. It's pretty simple, really. You just bow your
head, say a simple prayer, and when you open your eyes you're a
registered Republican with a firearm."</LD>
<LD>   --Christian comedian Thor Ramsey</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Evangelical Christians are better known for the religious right
than for riotous laughter, but as stand-up Christian comedy gains
momentum, the giggling is growing.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent "Comics 4 Christ" show at Woodland Hills Community
Church, four comedians kept an audience of hundreds rolling.</TE>
<TE>   The man who lined up the acts was "gospel comedian" Vernard "Bone"
Hampton, one of several dozen Christian comics who perform in secular
venues and in church shows around Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Their humor is reflected in the advice Hampton says his pastor
gave him for finding a good woman at church: "Watch 'em when they
come into church. Do they come into church like they've been there
before? Or do they have their ID out 'cause they think it's a club?
During praise and worship, are they praising the Lord, or raising the
roof? Do they think Mary was a virgin, or that Mary was a Virgo?"</TE>
<TE>   The mainly evangelical Christians who attend these events are able
to laugh wholeheartedly, without the anxiety that would be part of
the price of admission at a typically raunchy secular comedy club in
Hollywood or West Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "When I wanted to get married, my pastor told me I should leave
the men alone, trust God, and take myself off the market. I said,
'Not only am I NOT off the market, I'm in the front aisle with a
clearance sign on my chest. It says: "No Refund, No Exchange, Buy One
Get It All Free, SE HABLA ESPANOL."'"</TE>
<TE>   --Comedian Sherri Shepherd</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Embracing culture through a medium like comedy is a relatively new
concept in evangelical Christianity, said Rob Johnston, professor of
theology and culture at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   For much of the 20th century, most Protestant churches did all
they could to remove themselves from popular culture. But over the
past 20 to 30 years, the evangelical Christian community has begun to
cautiously reverse that, Johnston said. Pastors of mega-churches,
ever-conscious of the art of performance, have been expected for
years to include humor in their sermons, Johnston noted.</TE>
<TE>   "Comics 4 Christ" is one of several church-based shows in L.A.
that provide a more sophisticated view of Christianity to people who
may be hostile to it. "Most Christians today recognize that life was
created to be enjoyed with each other and God," Johnston said. "For
us to be able to laugh together is appropriate and wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   Thor Ramsey, the headliner of the recent "Comics 4 Christ" show
and producer of his own "Pure Comedy" show, offers another theory:
When it comes to trends, evangelical Christians generally lag a
decade or two behind secular culture, he said. Stand-up comedy boomed
in the '80s, and now Christians are catching up.</TE>
<TE>   Ramsey was a full-time comedian before he became a Christian. He
took a year off, turned his blue routine squeaky clean and added a
short profession of faith to the act. "When I first came back to
comedy, I didn't feel the psychological need to perform to the
crowd," he said. "It was the most freeing time I've felt in comedy."</TE>
<TE>   Sherri Shepherd struggled harder to make the same transition.
Becoming a Christian did not immediately remove her appreciation of
how her "nasty and dirty" style of comedy worked on an audience.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember being on my knees crying, saying, 'I can't let this
go! You're going to give me something better?'" Shepherd said. In
what she describes as an act of faith, she says she removed swearing
and sexuality from her act and then found God answering her prayer
for new material.</TE>
<TE>   God "opened the doors of creativity so wide that sometimes the
ideas come so fast I can't even write them down," said Shepherd, who
has also been a series regular on several TV shows.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "I made the mistake of purchasing a Bible at the 99 Cents store,
and I got an "irregular" Bible. My Bible had a few pages missing;
some Scripture was misquoted. It wasn't the King James Version--it
was the Rick James version."</TE>
<TE>   --''Bone'' Hampton</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One thing stand-up comedy clubs and churches have in common is a
reputation for segregating white from black. This has led to a
distinctly black "gospel" style of comedy, but also to a commitment
to be inclusive.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1997, many L.A.-based Christian comedians have performed at
Lamont Bonman's "Gospel Komedy SLAMMs"--the biggest and most
established Christian comedy show in the area.</TE>
<TE>   The shows are produced almost weekly at venues throughout L.A. and
have a "Showtime at the Apollo" feel to them, often drawing more than
1,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   Bonman says he tries to integrate Christianity by booking comics
from different racial backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   "I think one reason people like Malcolm X and Ali went to Islam is
because of the prejudice they saw in the [white] church--especially
in the South," Bonman said.</TE>
<TE>   Bonman said he recently asked a secular black comedy promoter why
he didn't tap into the white audience. "White people don't want to
sit next to black people," the promoter told him.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's important that we tear down the walls," Bonman said.</TE>
<TE>   Hampton says he also tries to achieve a racial and gender mix at
"Comics 4 Christ" bookings. At the Woodland Hills show, the Rev.
Garry Zeigler, pastor of Spirit Food Ministries, which rents space at
Woodland Hills Community Church, was on board with the push for
integration. Zeigler said there are no racial boundaries when people
share a relationship with Jesus Christ. When he invited members of
the audience to hug one another and say "I love you" after the show,
they complied with gusto.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine a country where pot is legal. Domino's would deliver your
pizza, and it would already be eaten."</TE>
<TE>   --Thor Ramsey</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ramsey says one of the most common questions he gets from
Christians is: Isn't "Christian comedian" an oxymoron? His answer:
Christian comedians use stand-up as a vehicle for sharing their
faith.</TE>
<TE>   Ramsey's "Pure Comedy" show, based in his home church, Anaheim
Vineyard Christian Fellowship, lets people who aren't Christians know
that "God is good and Christians are OK," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Audience members are encouraged to bring non-Christian friends by
paying only $1 per friend when the Christian pays the $10 full price.</TE>
<TE>   People turned off by Christian concepts of church or God may not
become Christians at the show, but they might move a step closer to
the faith, Ramsey believes.</TE>
<TE>   "Humor breaks down walls," he said. "You won't laugh at someone
you don't like."</TE>
<TE>   Bonman is even more direct in sharing the faith with
nonchurchgoers at his shows. The title of his show, "SLAMM," is an
acronym for Salvation, Laughter and Ministering Music. It features
comedy, music and an "altar call"--a presentation that invites people
to follow Christ.</TE>
<TE>   Bonman envisions himself as a Billy Graham with punch lines.</TE>
<TE>   "My vision is to see stadiums full of people who wouldn't normally
go to church, with the same results as Billy Graham."</TE>

<HD>Kin to Be Paid in Farm Workers' Crash</HD>
<DH>Courts: A judge rules that commute of 13 tomato pickers
killed in a 1999 accident is covered under workers' comp; survivors
also qualify.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FRESNO</DL>
<LD>The families of 13 tomato pickers killed in a crash returning home
from work and two survivors are eligible for more than $2 million
after a judge ruled that their commute was covered under workers'
compensation.</LD>
<LD>   In a decision made public Friday by the Workers' Compensation
Appeals Board, a judge ruled that the farm workers were exceptions to
a "going and coming" rule that prevents commuters from collecting
workers' comp benefits.</LD>
<LD>   Green Valley Ag, a farm labor contractor, and Terra Linda Farms
were found liable to pay workers' compensation claims and death
benefits to the victims of the Aug. 9, 1999, crash in Five Points,
west of Fresno.</LD>
<TE>   "It's been something that I've been waiting for," said crash
survivor Lucila Gonzalez, 23, who had several surgeries to repair her
liver. "I cried a lot. They had to take me to the bathroom and shower
me. I couldn't move for three months."</TE>
<TE>   The workers were headed home in the early morning when their van
slammed into a big-rig truck that was making an illegal turn, killing
all but two of the tomato pickers.</TE>
<TE>   The crash spurred reform of farm worker transportation vehicles,
requiring seats and seat belts in vans.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Stephen Webster said the survivors could collect workers'
comp because they were required to use the labor contractor for
transportation and the labor contractor and the grower benefited from
the provided transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Each family will be entitled to $200,000 in death benefits, said
Robert Perez, the farm workers' attorney. The companies also will pay
past medical bills and medical benefits for life.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez's bills totaled $1.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Javier Alabart, a lawyer for Green Valley Ag and its insurance
company, didn't know if his clients would appeal.</TE>
<TE>   He said the case was difficult because the law is slanted in favor
of the workers and because the facts were so horrible.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a heart-wrenching case because you have relatively young
people, hard-working individuals working for minimum wage, with
families here or in Mexico and they're dead," Alabart said. "There's
not much you can do about that."</TE>
<TE>   Alabart emphasized that the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board is
a no-fault system and that the judge did not blame the contractor or
the farm.</TE>
<TE>   In a final comment, however, the judge made a scathing remark
about conditions for farm workers.</TE>
<TE>   "We, as a society, should be ashamed to allow our fellow human
beings to be treated in this disgraceful and obscene manner," Webster
said.</TE>
<TE>   Arturo Rodriguez, United Farm Workers union president, said he
hopes legislation will be passed to protect the health and safety of
the workers.</TE>
<TE>   The union has tried unsuccessfully three times to get legislation
passed to make growers and farm labor contractors jointly liable for
accidents on the job.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not too much to ask that employers, like any other employers
in the nation, be responsible for the lives of their employees,"
Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   Francisco Arellano, whose wife, Angelina, died in the accident,
said he would have liked to have seen safety measures in place.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care about the money," Arellano said, angrily fighting
back tears.</TE>
<TE>   "How'd you feel if your [spouse] died? My children talk about
their mother all the time."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles City Controller Laura Chick refused to pay for several
Department of Water and Power parties that she said reveal the
agency's "frivolous" attitude toward public money, and she forwarded
the bills Friday to the City Council for review.</LD>
<LD>   DWP officials said they are working with Chick's office to develop
guidelines to control spending on events and sponsorships.</LD>
<LD>   Dubbing the DWP the "Department of Wasteful Practices," Chick
scrawled "DENIED" on an enlarged mock-up of a bill for a mid-February
concert for large business customers that cost about $27,000. The tab
included $16 a person for soft drinks.</LD>
<TE>   "These expenses have been flying under the radar for a long time,"
Chick said. "I'm drawing the line in the sand."</TE>
<TE>   Sitting on a table next to her were $16 worth of refreshments she
had bought, including a gallon of Sparkletts water, a case of Pepsi
and three liters of soda.</TE>
<TE>   "That's seems like a little much for one person to drink during an
hour-and-a-half reception," Chick said. "It's hard to say how this
brings bang for the buck and added value to the average ratepayer."</TE>
<TE>   Sponsors are expected to eventually pay most of the Green L.A.
concert bills, said David Wiggs, the department's general manager.</TE>
<TE>   Wiggs said officials support Chick's efforts to monitor the
department's spending. "We're going to try to tighten up the policies
and get them a little more specific," he said. "We need to have some
better guidelines to follow as to what's not appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Events such as the concert for VIP business customers and
workshops for everyday citizens are essential to educate the city
about the department's energy conservation programs, Wiggs said.</TE>

<LD>A group of tenant leaders and residents of the city-run San Fernando
Gardens housing development called Friday for a criminal
investigation of the Los Angeles Housing Authority over allegations
of mismanagement and misappropriation of funds.</LD>
<LD>   About 20 residents protested outside the Pacoima housing
development and called for the city attorney and district attorney to
investigate Housing Authority finances.</LD>
<LD>   "The residents are fed up with personal abuse suffered by me and
many others," said Sandra Obando, president of the San Fernando
Gardens Resident Management Council.</LD>
<TE>   Obando said the investigation should look into allegations that
money has been misspent by the authority, as well as "retaliatory and
vindictive actions" against tenant groups, including the termination
of contracts held by tenant groups to provide their own security and
moving services.</TE>
<TE>   The Times recently reported that the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development is conducting an audit of the Housing
Authority. The audit was launched after federal officials received
allegations from some tenant leaders and a contractor that city
managers accepted cash meant for poor residents, manipulated bids on
contracts, tolerated double-billing by a consultant and took away
contracts from those who complained.</TE>
<TE>   Agency representatives denied the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Agency attorney Martha Shen-Urquidez said a security contract with
the tenant council at San Fernando Gardens was terminated when a
strike by guards prevented the tenant group from fulfilling its
obligation to protect construction sites at the development.</TE>
<TE>   About a dozen security guards held their own march Friday, saying
Obando and other critics do not speak for all the residents.</TE>

<HD>Murder Is Charged in Fire Death of Gay Man</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Santa Barbara man has been charged with murder, arson and a hate
crime for allegedly setting a sleeping acquaintance on fire at least
in part because the man was gay.</LD>
<LD>   About 3 p.m. Sunday, Clinton Scott Risetter, 37, awoke in flames.
He made his way to his apartment patio, where he died before
firefighters reached the scene.</LD>
<LD>   At 6:40 a.m. Tuesday, Martin Hartmann, 38, walked into the Santa
Barbara Police Department and said he had poured gasoline on Risetter
and ignited it, police said. He apparently had entered the apartment
through an unlocked door.</LD>
<TE>   Hartmann said he had known Risetter for several months but learned
just two weeks ago that he was gay. Hartmann also told police
Risetter was depressed.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Hartmann claimed he set the fire both because he hates
gays and to end Risetter's misery, Police Lt. Michael Aspland said.</TE>
<TE>   "Hartmann coming in was a major break. We had no idea who did it,"
Aspland said.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing Hartmann's account, police took a bloodhound to
Risetter's apartment.</TE>
<TE>   The dog followed the scent from Hartmann's clothing into
Risetter's bedroom and to the bed, the lieutenant said.</TE>
<TE>   Hartmann was known to Santa Barbara police as a suspected
arsonist, Aspland said.</TE>
<TE>   They believe he may have set 10 fires in the past 10 years. They
had questioned but never arrested him.</TE>
<TE>   Hartmann lived with his mother about a half mile from Risetter's
apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Hartmann was to be arraigned Thursday, but the proceeding was
delayed at the request of his defense attorney, who asked for more
time to decide on a plea.</TE>

<HD>Write-In Candidates Get Boost in Court</HD>
<DH>Election: Voters are to be made aware they can get a list
of names. Foes of O.C. judge hail ruling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD and MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a highly unusual ruling, an Orange County judge on Friday sided
with challengers to Superior Court Judge Ronald C. Kline and ordered
election officials to post signs at polling places alerting voters
that they can receive a list of write-in candidates.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling gives a significant boost to write-in candidates, who
are traditionally longshots because their names don't appear on
ballots. County attorneys said they cannot recall such a step ever
being taken.</LD>
<LD>   Election officials must now display signs that will undoubtedly
draw attention to write-in races at 1,716 polling places countywide.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling affects all races in which write-ins are candidates but
will particularly favor those opposing Kline, whose name is the only
one that will appear on the ballot. Kline faces charges of child
molestation and possessing child pornography.</TE>
<TE>   "It changes the dynamic of the election," said Dana Point attorney
John Adams, one of the write-in hopefuls. "I think that before this
ruling, it was wishful thinking that Judge Kline could be beat."</TE>
<TE>   County election officials had previously refused requests to post
the names of write-ins at polling places, citing a recommendation
from the California Secretary of State's office against the practice.</TE>
<TE>   But Friday morning, a group of voters together with one of Kline's
election opponents sued the county, arguing that Registrar of Voters
Rosalyn Lever was unfairly depriving voters of information about
qualified candidates.</TE>
<TE>   After some hesitation, Judge Gregory H. Lewis agreed. Lewis
ordered that voters should be made aware that they can ask for a list
of write-ins running in every race--not just those running against
Kline--when they pick up their ballots for Tuesday's primary
election.</TE>
<TE>   Three people running for governor, lieutenant governor and county
supervisor also have qualified as write-ins. But outside Lewis' Santa
Ana courtroom, it was clear which race had most at stake in the
judge's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Kline's opponents applauded as they left the courtroom and hailed
the order as a victory that could sway the outcome of the election.</TE>
<TE>   With only four days before polling, their biggest hurdle has
become spreading word that Kline is not running unopposed for another
six-year term. The last successful write-in candidacy in Orange
County was in 1986, and political observers have so far said Kline's
challengers face an uphill battle.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the psychological effect will be to remind voters about
this race," said Dan Dutcher, a former judge running for Kline's
seat.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling marked a compromise between election practices in
Orange County and what the write-ins had hoped for.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, voters could request a list of write-in candidates at
polling stations but few knew they had such an option. The issue
divided county officials. Supervisor Todd Spitzer attended Friday's
court hearing and asked the judge to rule against the county.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers working on behalf of the voters who filed the legal action
asked Lewis to order that a list of the names of the write-ins be
displayed where voters pick up their ballots.</TE>
<TE>   County attorneys did not oppose the request, but the judge
expressed concern that such a posting would give an unfair advantage
to write-ins.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts praised the judge's compromise as a creative way to
solve the problem without giving too much help to any one candidate.</TE>
<TE>   "The question here is: Does it confer an unfair advantage on the
write-in candidates?" said Los Angeles attorney Manny Klausner, who
specializes in election law.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd say it neutralizes a bit the advantage of the candidate
listed on the ballot, but it's not unfair."</TE>

<HD>Groundbreaking for UC Merced Is Delayed</HD>
<DH>Education: Suit by environmentalists helps push ceremony to
September. Campus is still expected to open to students in 2004.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A groundbreaking ceremony for the new University of California campus
near Merced has been delayed from May to September, partly as a
result of a recent legal challenge, a university official said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   But UC Merced spokesman James Grant said the delay is not expected
to keep the campus from opening to students as planned in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   In January, the university's regents set the stage for the
groundbreaking, approving the project's environmental impact report
and plans for construction of its $225-million first phase. The
campus, the university's 10th, is the first new UC branch to be
launched since the mid-1960s.</LD>
<TE>   But late last month, three San Joaquin Valley environmental groups
filed suit to stop construction, accusing the university of haphazard
planning and inadequate environmental reviews for the 2000-acre
project.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have said frequently that UC officials, under pressure
from the governor's office and state legislators to complete the
campus as quickly as possible, have failed to address its potential
environmental impacts. The planned site, northeast of Merced, is in
an area of sensitive wetlands and prime grazing and agricultural
lands.</TE>
<TE>   The pending suit, filed in Superior Court in Merced County, asked
for an injunction against all activity related to the project, until
the university is found to be in compliance with applicable
environmental laws.</TE>
<TE>   Grant said university officials decided this week to delay the
groundbreaking, and a planned inauguration ceremony for UC Merced
Chancellor Carol Tomlinson-Keasey, because of uncertainty stemming
from the lawsuit, and possible scheduling conflicts. The opening of a
new UC center in Washington, also planned for May, could have made it
difficult for many guests to attend both the Washington and Merced
ceremonies, the spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still committed to moving forward as fast as we can," Grant
said.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the project said they were pleased but not surprised
at Friday's announcement, adding that they anticipate further delays
as their lawsuit moves forward.</TE>

<HD>Nurses State Their Case to Senate Panel</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Garfield hospital is accused of unfair labor
practices. Its officials decline to appear at hearing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSE CARDENAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the latest twist of a long-running labor dispute between hundreds
of nurses and the nation's second-biggest hospital chain, a state
Senate panel held a hearing Friday in Monterey Park to investigate
allegations of unfair labor practices at Garfield Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   The hearing, called by the Senate Industrial Relations Committee,
is the latest act in a drama that has unfolded over more than a year
and included a brief strike in December.</LD>
<LD>   The committee came to town at the urging of state Sen. Gloria
Romero (D-Los Angeles), a member of the panel.</LD>
<TE>   To open the hearing, officials noted that representatives of
Garfield and Tenet Healthcare Corp.--which owns 44 hospitals in the
state, 19 of them in the Southland--declined to appear.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the California State Senate," said Romero. "I want to
state my disappointment that [the hospital administrator] is not
here."</TE>
<TE>   Garfield's chief executive, Phil Cohen, sent a letter stating that
he had to attend a previously scheduled employee retreat. The letter
also explained some of the hospital's positions.</TE>
<TE>   Also absent was Stephanie Sloggett-O'Dell, director of Tenet
Health Systems, who was scheduled to speak.</TE>
<TE>   The Monterey Park labor dispute is the second problem facing Tenet
in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, seven lawsuits were filed in various courts in
the region alleging that Tenet ran a two-tier billing system that
overcharged poor Latinos as part of a scheme to take advantage of a
federally funded charity care program.</TE>
<TE>   The Garfield conflict traces back to late 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Garfield's 450 nurses, trying to address what they
perceived as poor staffing, patient care and working conditions,
decided to unionize.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately, the hospital and Service Employees International
Union disagreed on whether a segment of the employees were "charge
nurses"--supervisors--and therefore not allowed by law to vote.</TE>
<TE>   The National Labor Relations Board ruled that the nurses in
question could vote.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2001, a secret ballot vote was held, and the majority
of the nurses opted to be represented by the union. In August, the
NLRB certified the election.</TE>
<TE>   The board also handed down five unfair labor practice indictments
against Garfield--including an accusation that it asked employees to
spy on one another.</TE>
<TE>   Those allegations will be addressed in April during a hearing
before the regional branch of the NLRB.</TE>
<TE>   Since the election, Garfield administrators have refused to
bargain, said Jim Moreau, a union representative.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts by the nurses, union leaders and politicians to get the
hospital to talk have included a daylong strike and two marches to
Cohen's office.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's hearing was attended by about 150 Monterey Park
residents, local officials and nurses.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever they would give to me, I would take," said Daisy Dai
Chun Lee, a nurse of 25 years. "Sometimes I would take up to 15
patients by myself. When I would get home, my feet would be hurting.
I want to cry."</TE>
<TE>   Like many of the patients the hospital serves, some testifying
said that many of the nurses are immigrant women from Asia and Latin
America who are used to being submissive.</TE>
<TE>   The purpose of the hearing, said Romero and state Sen. Richard
Alarcon (D-Sylmar)--the committee chairman--was to see whether state
law can be changed to, among other things, force employers to bargain
after an election.</TE>

<LD>Why didn't the chicken make it across the road? I don't know, but Len
Schleikorn of Malibu found the victim in a shop in Australia (see

inside a vehicle, snapped by Daniel Love and several other readers
(see photo).</LD>
<LD>   By way of explanation, Schleikorn added: "In checking with the

<TE>   Just two of the six original signs remain standing, and there are
suspicions that some were removed by an artist (or artists). Traction
Avenue store owner Joel Bloom knows of one that was terminated by
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "It went down for [the filming of] a Schwarzenegger movie," Bloom
said.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold, I want to hear you say: "I'll be back ... with that sign."</TE>
<TE>   Touch of humanity: "I just got a telephone call that started with
a woman's voice saying, 'I am calling you personally,'" said Richard
Sherer. He added: "It was a taped message."</TE>
<TE>   Seeing orange: After a reader spotted a Rolls Royce with the
license plate NO MSTRD, Ina Nevin of Manhattan Beach recalled seeing
a Rolls driver with a different attitude. His coupe was parked in a
lot with a jar of Grey Poupon on the dashboard. Which reminds me:
I've got to clean that McDonald's ketchup stain off the floor of my
old Honda.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: An item here about a Calabasas dog show for mutts
brought a note from Mike Kirwan of Venice, who recalled a story about
a mutt owner who was taking his hound to a pedigreed dog show. A
friend told him the mutt had no chance to win. "Yes," responded his
owner, "but think of the contacts he'll make."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Nahas, 79, the driving force behind the building of the
Oakland Coliseum complex in the 1960s, died in his sleep Feb. 7 at
his home in Palm Desert.</LD>
<LD>   An immigrant shopkeeper's son from the Midwest, Nahas went into
the real estate field as a young man and gained success as a
developer of shopping centers and housing in the Bay Area cities of
Castro Valley and Orinda and in the Lake Tahoe area.</LD>
<LD>   Known for his passion in promoting the East Bay, Nahas in the
early 1960s was named chairman of the new Oakland-Alameda County
Coliseum Inc., a nonprofit corporation formed to create a sports and
entertainment complex.</LD>
<TE>   After successfully negotiating with the Raiders' Al Davis, Nahas
persuaded Charles O. Finley to move the Kansas City A's to the West
Coast. The $24-million Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum opened in
1966.</TE>
<TE>   Nahas was chairman of R.T. Nahas Co. of Castro Valley, with
affiliates in Idaho and Nevada. He was active in the Urban Land
Institute for 50 years, and served as its president for two years.</TE>

Sound Effects</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oskar Sala, 91, the German composer and physicist who produced the
eerie bird sound effects for Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds," died of
undisclosed causes Tuesday in Berlin.</LD>
<LD>   The bird cries were generated on a musical instrument known as a
mixture-trautonium, whose design was improved by Sala. The
instrument's predecessor was the trautonium, which was invented in
1929 and billed as the world's first electronic instrument.</LD>
<LD>   The sounds produced by the mixture-trautonium are generated by
saw-tooth oscillations of low-voltage neon lamps and can be varied
with filters.</LD>
<TE>   Born in the eastern German town of Greiz, Sala mastered the
instrument and performed with the Berlin Philharmonic several times.
The instrument--the precursor to the synthesizer--was often used in
German TV commercials in the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Sala donated his original mixture-trautonium to the German Museum
for Contemporary Technology in Bonn in 1995.</TE>

Heart Assn. and the Walnut Valley Rotary Club.</LD>
<TE>   He was elected vice president of the Assn. of California School
Administrators in May and was twice awarded the organization's Marcus

<LD>A community memorial for slain Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel
Pearl is planned for March 9 at his alma mater, Birmingham Senior
High School in Van Nuys.</LD>
<LD>   The school's principal, Doris Lasiter, said tentative plans are
underway for a gathering of religious and civic leaders, music
ensembles and school choirs.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Saunders, who graduated with Pearl in 1981, is helping to
establish a college scholarship in his classmate's name that would be
awarded to a Birmingham student aspiring to a career in international
journalism.</LD>
<TE>   Pearl, 38, was abducted in the Pakistani port city of Karachi on
Jan. 23 while investigating local ties between alleged "shoe bomber"
Richard C. Reid and Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.</TE>
<TE>   Before news of his death on Feb. 21, organizers had planned a
vigil at Encino's Lanai Elementary School, which Pearl also attended.
The location was later changed to the high school.</TE>
<TE>   The memorial is tentatively scheduled for 7:30 p.m. at Birmingham
Senior High, 17000 Haynes St.</TE>

<HD>Mailer Using Reagan Quote Causes Furor</HD>
<DH>Politics: Prop. 45 foes say that claiming the ailing former
president would have supported it is 'deceptive,' 'grotesque.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN and JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Opponents of Proposition 45, an initiative that would alter
California's strict term limits law, harshly criticized a mailer sent
to Republican households implying that former President Ronald Reagan
would have backed the measure.</LD>
<LD>   And foes of Proposition 42, who two weeks ago hadn't even mounted
a campaign, are spending $3 million on a TV ad blitz to defeat the
measure, which would earmark a gasoline sales tax for transportation.</LD>
<LD>   The Proposition 45 mailer includes a photo of Reagan and a 1989
statement in which the former president and California governor, now
suffering from Alzheimer's disease, expressed opposition to term
limits. "Like President Reagan, Proposition 45 puts its faith in the
voters to make the right decisions for themselves," the mailer says.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a grotesque, disreputable and disrespectful
misappropriation of President Reagan's name and image," said Dan
Schnur, a Republican and manager of the No-on-45 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd say it's fair to call it deceptive," said California
Republican Party spokesman Rob Stutsman, noting that the GOP opposes
the initiative, while the state Democratic Party is the biggest
financial backer of the measure, having spent $3.2 million for its
passage.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, Assembly members are limited to three two-year terms,
and state senators can serve two four-year terms. Under Proposition
45, legislators could run for two more two-year terms in the
Assembly, and one more four-year term in the Senate, if they gathered
signatures of 20% of the voters who cast ballots in the prior
election. .</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the former president and First Lady Nancy Reagan
said they have expressed no opinion on any candidates or propositions
on Tuesday's ballot.</TE>
<TE>   But Bill Carrick, who is managing the Yes-on-45 campaign, said the
ad "implies only one thing. President Reagan didn't like term limits.
He made it very clear."</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than 40% of registered voters are expected to turn out for
Tuesday's election, but interest groups are spending millions on
ballot measures and legislative primary contests.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most high-profile efforts involves Proposition 42,
which would dedicate the gasoline sales tax to transportation
projects. It is backed by business groups, road construction
companies and some labor unions.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of sales tax varies with the price of gasoline. But the
state Department of Finance estimates that the tax will bring in $678
million next year.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing that the proposition would strip money from public schools
and other state programs, the California Teachers Assn. and the
Service Employees International Union, which represents 141,000 state
workers and 40,000 Los Angeles County workers, have pumped $3 million
into a TV campaign to defeat the measure.</TE>
<TE>   The latest Field poll showed 61% of likely voters favored the
proposition, with 23% opposed.</TE>
<TE>   "As people get a deeper understanding of what 42 is, it is going
to lose support," said Carrick, who produced the ads for the two
unions.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation advocates reject a key contention in a television
spot by opponents that Proposition 42 won't take effect until 2008.</TE>
<TE>   "I know with campaign advertising you can be ... loose with the
truth," said Steve Schnaidt, staff director of the Senate
Transportation Committee. "But in the interest of accuracy, it's not
true."</TE>
<TE>   Schnaidt said Proposition 42 would embed in the state Constitution
provisions of a law that requires gas sales tax to be spent on
transportation projects from July 2003 through June 2008. The measure
would also require that the tax continue to be used for
transportation projects beyond 2008.</TE>

<LD>   The federal government has been in a hurry-up mode to hire and

<LD>The Russian Orthodox Church this week labeled as "irrational" Pope
John Paul II's plan to make a "virtual visit" to Moscow via a
satellite linkup between the Vatican and the Russian capital.</LD>
<LD>   The Moscow Patriarchate reacted angrily to the announcement that
the Roman Catholic pontiff will recite the rosary today with young
Russian Catholics gathered in Moscow's Cathedral of the Immaculate
Conception.</LD>
<LD>   Russia's Catholic bishops arranged the virtual visit after the
patriarchate responded to the creation of four Catholic dioceses in
Russia earlier this month by ruling out an actual papal visit to
Moscow in the foreseeable future.</LD>

<LD>NEW HAVEN, Conn.--Los Angeles' just-retired Episcopal bishop has been
appointed interim head of the troubled Berkeley Divinity School at
Yale.</LD>
<LD>   The Rt. Rev. Frederick Borsch, 66, began at Berkeley this week and
will remain until a dean is named. Borsch will not be a candidate for
the permanent job, according to Christian Sonne, chairman of the
school's board of trustees.</LD>
<LD>   Borsch replaces Ralph William Franklin, who left in December to
work for the Episcopal Diocese of New York after auditors questioned
his management of the school's finances. Auditors accused Franklin of
using the school's money for personal expenses.</LD>

congregations, many Roman Catholic churches in central and eastern
Connecticut are merging or reducing Sunday services.</LD>
<LD>   In the last decade, about 60 churches in central and eastern
Connecticut have linked services or shared priests, said Msgr. Thomas
Ginty, chancellor of the Archdiocese of Hartford.</LD>
<LD>   Smaller congregations, typically in poor areas, are financially

<LD>SPRINGFIELD, Mo.--The Assemblies of God hopes to maintain its
missionary work in Belgium despite having four church volunteers
deported from the country for violating work permit laws.</LD>
<LD>   The denomination said it was unaware until they were detained that
Belgium strictly enforced a 1999 law requiring work permits for
missionaries serving outside the pulpit and church ministry.</LD>
<LD>   The American women were volunteering Feb. 7 in a media office and
a Christian academy in the town of Sint-Genesius-Rode when police
took them into custody, saying they were working illegally on tourist
visas.</LD>

<HD>Mistrial Declared in Rocketdyne Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: Jury's 10-2 vote isn't enough to convict two former
employees accused in fatal explosion at lab in 1994.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Riverside jury deadlocked Friday on whether two former Rocketdyne
employees illegally burned chemical waste that resulted in a deadly
1994 blast at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory near Chatsworth.</LD>
<LD>   After more than a week of deliberations, the jury of eight men and
four women voted 10-2 in favor of guilty on three charges. But that
was short of the unanimous verdict required for a criminal
conviction.</LD>
<LD>   The defendants, Joseph E. Flanagan, 61, of Stanwood, Wash., and
Edgar R. Wilson, 65, of Chatsworth, are charged with violating
federal environmental laws.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Robert J. Timlin declared a
mistrial and set a March 18 hearing. Assistant U.S. Atty. William
Carter will have to decide whether to retry the case.</TE>
<TE>   "No decision has been made at this point in time," said Thom
Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys obviously wanted a verdict of not guilty, but
said they were satisfied with a hung jury.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Flanagan and I are pleased that after five years of
investigation and a four-month trial ... the government could not
convince 12 people of guilt on any of the charges," said Flanagan's
attorney, John D. Vandevelde. "We are prepared to try this case
repeatedly until Dr. Flanagan is fully exonerated."</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Sharenow, Wilson's attorney, said his client maintains his
innocence.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that the government should just drop the case and not
waste any more taxpayer money," he said. Sharenow estimates the
government has spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in its
seven-year investigation and prosecution of the case.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan and Wilson are accused of illegally burning chemical
waste at the field laboratory on July 21, 1994 and July 26, 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan, then director of Rocketdyne's Chemical Technology Group,
also is charged with illegal waste storage.</TE>
<TE>   Each count carries a maximum penalty of up to five years in prison
and a $250,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   A third defendant, James F. Weber, 52, of Moorpark, pleaded guilty
in August to illegally storing explosive materials, a misdemeanor. He
has not yet been sentenced.</TE>
<TE>   At trial, Carter argued the defendants knew they were burning
waste. He said they followed a procedure similar to that used at the
laboratory's old burn pit.</TE>
<TE>   They poured chemicals on top of sawdust in a large aluminum pan
and ignited them, he said. They did not measure the ingredients, nor
did they collect data.</TE>
<TE>   The first burns took place on July 21, 1994. Five men, including
Wilson and Weber, ignited the chemicals but had to stop when sparks
created a nearby brush fire.</TE>
<TE>   Five days later, the men met again and conducted two burns before
the chemicals exploded. The blast killed scientists Otto K. Heiney,
53, of Canoga Park, and Larry A. Pugh, 51, of Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan was not present, but was the men's supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   Both Flanagan and Wilson testified that they believed the burns
were legitimate scientific tests.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan said he did not direct, approve or plan any "phony
testing" or illegal storage.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said he was told Flanagan had authorized using excess
rocket propellants for overpressure tests. He admitted to once
burning waste, but said he was reprimanded and never did it again.</TE>
<TE>   A witness for the prosecution, Lee Wells, 70, of Newbury Park, was
severely burned in the explosion and was granted immunity to testify
against the defendants. He said he assumed that they were burning
hazardous waste.</TE>
<TE>   Heiney's widow, Judy, also testified for the prosecution. She said
her husband confided his growing frustration with "stupid
environmental rules" and how the lab could "get around" them. She
said her husband would not have acted without Flanagan's approval.</TE>
<TE>   For the same incidents, Rocketdyne's then parent company, Rockwell
International Corp., pleaded guilty in 1996 to mishandling hazardous
chemicals and paid a $6.5-million fine.</TE>

<HD>Scientists Study Whether Fungus Now in Foothills</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists are trying to determine whether the fungus-like organism
that causes sudden oak death in trees has reached the foothills of
the Sierra Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   Yellowish maple leaves were found in the foothills last fall, but
scientists have not matched the DNA taken from the diseased leaves to
the pathogen that causes sudden oak death, Phytophthora ramorum, said
Matteo Garbelotto, a forest pathologist with the University of
California, Berkeley.</LD>
<LD>   "The symptom was similar to what we've seen here on the coast, but
they're so generic that it could be anything," he said. "There's
hundreds of things that could cause a yellow spot."</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds more samples need to be collected and tested before a
match can be confirmed, and that can't happen until leaves start
growing back on the trees, Garbelotto said.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a match, it would be the first one found outside the
California and Oregon coastal region.</TE>
<TE>   If the pathogen is found in the Sierra Nevada foothills, it's
still unclear if conditions would be right for it to develop into the
disease, said Katie Facino, a spokeswoman with the California
Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention.</TE>

<LD>An off-duty U.S. Secret Service agent in town to protect Vice
President Dick Cheney bit off part of a man's ear during a brawl
outside a bar last month, authorities said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The fight, involving four agents, occurred Feb. 18, said Sgt. Rob
Morse of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department.</LD>

some good lumps,'' Morse said.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Minnesota obstetrician accused of killing her 13-year-old son
contends a child pornography ring may be funding her defense against
her will and is not allowing her access to a fair trial.</LD>
<LD>   During an interview Thursday with two Bay Area media outlets,
Donna Anderson recited a rambling list of names, her work history and
vague allegations.</LD>
<LD>   Anderson, 48, is being held in the San Mateo County Jail's medical
wing on charges she stabbed her son, Stephen Burns, to death Feb. 24
in her ex-husband's home.</LD>
<TE>   Anderson, who lives in Shoreview, Minn., quit her job last month
as an obstetrician at Regions Hospital in St. Paul. Her son was
planning to live with relatives in the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's court-appointed attorney, Jeff Boyarsky, said Thursday
he may pursue an insanity defense in the case, but cautioned it's
still too early to say for sure.</TE>

<HD>Dormitories for Migrant Farm Workers on Ballot</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Napa Valley voters are being asked to approve dormitories for
hundreds of migrant farm workers who have been sleeping in cars or
under the stars for years.</LD>
<LD>   Measure L, as the Tuesday ballot proposal is called, would
authorize five new housing camps and 300 new beds. That would nearly
triple the valley's supply of government-regulated accommodations and
ensure a pool of cheap and available labor for vineyard owners.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a demand for beds," said Angel Sanchez Ortega, 38, who
makes about $400 a week picking grapes and shares a room with two
other men. "Build more camps. A lot of people need it."</LD>
<TE>   The problem is most acute during the fall harvest, when hundreds
of workers come from Mexico to find jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Measure L would permit the new camps for single men who can show
they work at the vineyards and have immigration papers. They would
have to pay $10 a day.</TE>
<TE>   If the measure passes, groundbreaking at one site would take place
in April on seven acres donated by Joseph Phelps Vineyards.</TE>

<HD>San Francisco Airport Hit by Bay Area Economic Tailspin</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Officials roll back expansion plans and take
steps to rein in operating costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A devastating one-two punch of jittery post-Sept. 11 air travelers
and the Bay Area's economic tailspin has prompted officials to roll
back their ambitious expansion plans at San Francisco International,
the nation's sixth-busiest airport.</LD>
<LD>   Airport commissioners voted recently to trim operating costs by
23%, approving a $570-million budget they say will translate into a
host of belt-tightening measures--including postponement of the
construction of a new hotel and renovating an aging terminal.</LD>
<LD>   Like airports nationwide, San Francisco International has suffered
a significant drop in air travel following the terrorist attacks.
Last year, the airport saw a 5.4 million decline in the number of
passengers from the previous year. Also driven by the wholesale
collapse of technology sector firms, the slump has brought a drastic
cut in airport revenues: Sales at concourse shops, restaurants and
bars are down a whopping $60 million--20% from a year ago.</LD>
<TE>   But city officials say the airport has long operated without
proper scrutiny and that operators have made decisions--such as
opening a new international terminal in 2000 and spending millions to
research the costly construction of a new runway--that have helped
put the facility in financial jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   With revenues down, the airport is projected to send about $21
million to City Hall, down from the $30-million annual average.</TE>
<TE>   Calling the airport's newest budget "a warning light on the
dashboard," Supervisor Aaron Peskin recently called for an
independent audit of the airport's finances, the first in 30 years.
The Board of Supervisors, which has final say on the facility's
budget, has yet to vote on the matter, but Peskin is not prepared to
rubber-stamp the newest request.</TE>
<TE>   "This airport has always operated as an autonomous city within a
city--as long as they sent their check to City Hall every year, the
idea was 'Don't question them,'" said Peskin, chairman of the board's
finance committee. "Well, I think it's time to rein them in, go over
their budget with a fine-toothed comb, to send in a team to do an
audit and not just accept what it is they're bringing every
year--ideas like a new international terminal."</TE>
<TE>   He called the airport one of the region's key economic engines.
"And it's hurting," Peskin said. "I want to be sure we wake up in two
years and see its fiscal health restored."</TE>
<TE>   Airport officials bristled at Peskin's tone.</TE>
<TE>   "It's troubling that it appears we're not trustworthy, but our
books are open," said airport spokesman Ron Wilson. "This airport is
certainly not going broke. We are not an Enron. But we know we have
to be very responsible in operating this airport with our reduced
amount of cash flow."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson acknowledged that much has changed since officials opened
the international terminal, a cavernous gem designed to capitalize on
the new rush of Pacific Rim travelers, whose numbers had soared 10%
annually in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Then the sky fell. In 2001, total flights dropped nearly 10%, from
429,000 to 387,000. Passengers also fell from 40 million to 34.6
million.</TE>
<TE>   "We were flying high then but now things are different," Wilson
said. "Still, this airport isn't responsible for international
events."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, airport officials have launched what Wilson calls an
ambitious plan to rein in costs.</TE>
<TE>   While stressing they have made no cutbacks in passenger screening,
officials have reduced parking rates to attract more customers. They
have frozen hiring and cut back on equipment purchases and the hiring
of expensive consultants.</TE>
<TE>   Airport operators have also renegotiated rents with most of the
137 concessionaires who run businesses in the various concourses in
an attempt to help them through hard financial times. Most have seen
business plummet with new security rules that forbid visitors beyond
perimeter checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of a minimum annual guarantee, rents for concessions are
now based on a percentage of their gross sales--a rate officials say
will remain for the foreseeable future.</TE>
<TE>   Before the change, business owners were paying as much as 60% of
gross sales for rent. Several businesses have also closed.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the financial suffering has come at the international
terminal, which some concessionaires have described as a passenger
ghost town.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you feel like you have the entire terminal to
yourself," said Mark Thornton, a managing partner of the San
Francisco Golf shop. "We have these huge gaps in the day with
absolutely no customers."</TE>
<TE>   But Peskin said unregulated spending has put the airport in a
serious financial hole. He pointed out that the airport is $4.1
billion in debt from its international terminal and other projects.
Half of the 2002 budget--or some $300 million--will go solely to pay
the interest on those loans.</TE>
<TE>   "One problem is that these airport expansion plans have been
phenomenally predetermined," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Peskin pointed to a controversial new runway airport officials say
is needed to keep pace with the region's growth--a project he called
the largest local use of public funds since the building of the
Golden Gate Bridge nearly 70 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Officials are studying whether to fill 300 to 700 acres of San
Francisco Bay for a new runway and have conducted what they call an
unprecedented four-year, $66-million study of the plan's
environmental effects on the fragile bay.</TE>
<TE>   They are also investigating several mitigation plans that include
restoring a vast swath of wetlands in Sonoma County.</TE>
<TE>   Airport spokeswoman Kandace Bender said that the leaner budget
would not delay the ongoing environmental studies, which officials
hope to finish by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   But with the air traffic slowdown since September--and the
speculation about when passengers will return to the skies--Peskin
says it's time to reconsider the need for such a project.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to ask the question 'if,' not 'when,'" he said of the
runway project. "They're talking of spending billions of dollars on
this project. It's not just throwing a couple of spadefuls of dirt in
the water. If started, this thing would take a decade to finish.</TE>
<TE>   "Meanwhile, things change. For a politician watching out for the
public's tax dollars, not to ask these kind of questions would be
folly."</TE>
<TE>   Bender said officials can't decide on the project's future until
all the studies are done.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe a single San Francisco supervisor can decide
whether the modernization of a critical airport can go forward," she
said. "That has to be made collectively by the region."</TE>

<DL>FRANKLINTON, La.</DL>
<LD>Civil libertarians won a battle over public religious displays in
this small Louisiana town. But residents say they're victors too.</LD>
<LD>   More than 1,000 signs proclaiming that "God Is Lord Over All" now
dot lawns and storefronts around the town of 4,000.</LD>
<LD>   A local sign-maker has sold about 2,800 more to people from
surrounding towns, and a traveling salesman has started hawking them
in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Florida.</LD>
<TE>   The signs are a response to a lawsuit from the Louisiana branch of
the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU sued Franklinton and
forced town officials to remove four signs from public property that
said, "Jesus Is Lord Over Franklinton."</TE>
<TE>   Residents responded by planting similar signs in their frontyards.
In many neighborhoods, it's now tough to find a yard that doesn't
have one.</TE>
<TE>   "There was sort of an outcry from the Christian community," said
Gene Richards, pastor of Hill Crest Baptist Church. "It seems the
ACLU is trying to de-Christianize the community."</TE>
<TE>   ACLU officials say they are merely defending the Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   The civil liberties group filed its federal lawsuit a month ago,
demanding the removal of the signs leading into town. ACLU officials
named Washington Parish and town officials in their complaint, saying
public money was used to erect the signs--which they say violate the
country's constitutional provision for separation of church and
state.</TE>
<TE>   Parish President M.E. Taylor acknowledged that parish road crews
put up the signs, but he said residents paid for them.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans resident Linton Carney, who joined the ACLU as a
plaintiff, said he was offended when he saw the signs in July while
driving through Franklinton, which is 55 miles north of New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so upset to see such a sign that makes non-Christians
unwelcome in Franklinton," Carney said when the suit was filed. "Can
you imagine the hostility that Jews, Muslims, members of other
minority faiths and nonbelievers must feel when living in or passing
through that community?"</TE>
<TE>   Word about the lawsuit spread. The idea to put signs on private
property came independently to pastors and a group of residents
organizing their annual parish fair, said Madonna Fowler, 54, a
retired Franklinton teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners put them in their yards. Some put them inside car
windows. Business owners planted them in front of Radio Shack, Crown
Auto Sales and Winston Refrigeration.</TE>
<TE>   Word spread.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they're in every town in Washington Parish," said Scott
Blair, owner of All Star Graphics, which makes the $3 and $5 signs.</TE>

<HD>Dave Smith, 64; Helped Usher in Literary Journalism at The
Times</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Smith, a stylish and often elegant writer who covered a number
of high-profile stories for The Times--including the trial of Robert
F. Kennedy's assassin Sirhan Sirhan and the hunt for the Zodiac
killer, has died. He was 64.</LD>
<LD>   Smith, who retired from The Times in the mid-1980s, was found dead
in his Tucson home on Feb. 20. According to his friend and executor,
John Flynn, the cause of death was a heart attack. He is survived by
a brother, Jeff Smith, who also lives in Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   Former colleagues of Smith recalled him as one of the finest pure
writers to ever work at The Times.</LD>
<TE>   A complex man--sensitive and vulnerable with a nervous
disposition, who also could be extravagantly ebullient and
witty--Smith came to The Times in 1968, when the paper began to
experiment with more literary journalism, allowing some of its
writers the luxury of months-long deadlines, ample space and license
to write like novelists, with dialogue, narrative form and other
devices not usual to daily journalism of the era.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first of those takeouts, as they were called in the
newsroom, was Smith's piece on Benny Smith, a young man who walked
calmly into a beauty parlor in Mesa, Ariz., on Nov. 12, 1966, ordered
several women and two little girls to lie in a circle and then shot
each of them. Two survived.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's piece, which ran nearly 8,000 words, was a psychological
profile of the killer's troubled, lonely youth, his sense of
alienation and his motives for committing the mass killings, which
then were still rare in American life.</TE>
<TE>   His opening paragraphs signaled that this was a different kind of
newspaper story:</TE>
<TE>   "When he was 13, Benny Smith began to experience an identity
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not the fashionable sort of identity crisis that people
discuss over cocktails, nor the sort that moves writers or film
directors to create the existential art of the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead, quietly and quite unnoticed, Benny went insane."</TE>
<TE>   (For the full text of the story, go to latimes.com/davesmith.)</TE>
<TE>   Benny Smith was sentenced to death, but after a series of legal
maneuvers and a retrial in which he pleaded guilty to all charges, he
received a life prison sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's report on the killings created a stir in the newsroom and
in the journalism community at large. There were sharp divisions
within the staff on whether the piece belonged in the paper at all.</TE>
<TE>   William F. Thomas, then the paper's Metro editor, who later became
the editor of The Times, believed strongly that it did. He had hired
Smith and was intrigued by the kind of stylish, almost poetic prose
writers like Smith brought to the paper.</TE>
<TE>   "He was in that group that included [the late] Charles Powers ...
who were hired because they could write," Thomas said. "They all had
unique style."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Presque Isle, Maine, David Mortimer Smith grew up in
Arizona, graduating from Tucson High School and later the University
of Arizona. While in college, Smith worked for the Tucson Daily Star,
writing feature stories and film reviews that were so polished they
went immediately into the paper.</TE>
<TE>   After graduate work at UCLA, he worked at the Culver City Evening
Star-News and the Venice Vanguard before landing a job with
Associated Press, first in its Los Angeles bureau and later the New
York office.</TE>
<TE>   Smith came to The Times in January 1968, and his piece on Benny
Smith ran in the Monday, April 15, edition, taking up most of the
second section.</TE>
<TE>   The story, which received a variety of prizes, demonstrated to top
Times editors that there was a place in newspapers for literary
writing.</TE>
<TE>   From then on, Smith was assigned to a number of high-profile
stories and become known for his work on mass murder cases, including
the Zodiac killings. An adept daily deadline writer, Smith would
pound out stories with incredible speed when the gods of creativity
were with him. But his strongest work came in the longer story form,
where he could use his keen observations to paint fascinating word
pictures.</TE>
<TE>   A strong voice in the paper through the mid-1970s, his creativity
was later hampered by abrupt mood swings and other inner demons. He
returned to the Tucson area after his retirement and lived a quiet
life, collecting regional art and antiques and participating in some
choral singing.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his penchant for dark subjects in his most productive
years, Smith could also write with sly humor, as evidenced in these
opening paragraphs from a piece on the founder of the First Church of
Satan:</TE>
<TE>   "The high priest and founder of the First Church of Satan pours
another generous round of bourbon that is, God help us, out of this
world, then calls up the staircase:</TE>
<TE>   "'Diane, c'mere a minute, honey. What was that phone call
again--the one from Orange County?'</TE>
<TE>   "'I can't come down now,' she wailed. 'I'm setting my hair.'</TE>
<TE>   "But she does anyway, bouncing pertly into the room in bare feet,
black slacks and a blonde head bristling with plastic curlers. Slim,
petite and 27, Mrs. Anton Szandor LaVey takes a seat in an antique
wire-and-walnut potty chair.</TE>
<TE>   "So there we are--as American as crabapple pie--Mr. and Mrs.
Anti-Christ in their parlor, he magisterially enthroned in an old
barber's chair, discussing the trials and tribulations of the
religious life."</TE>

<HD>Missing Permit Does What Others Can't: Shut Down a New
Strip Club</HD>
<DH>Pico Rivera: City's first adult business hopes to reopen
Monday. Protesters vow to fight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Imperial Showgirls strip club's opening was not as grand as its
owners, LeRoy and Glenn Smith, hoped it would be.</LD>
<LD>   One dancer briefly performed for a lone customer before the doors
of Pico Rivera's first adult business closed soon after opening at
5:30 p.m. Friday while several hundreds protested outside.</LD>
<LD>   The owners agreed to shut down for the night to comply with the
Los Angeles County fire inspectors' safety code. They anticipate
reopening Monday after an inspection is conducted.</LD>
<TE>   "This is our 1st Amendment right to be here," said Glenn Smith,
48. "The same way it is their 1st Amendment right to protest."</TE>
<TE>   The club, which still has the marquee of the previous business, is
not welcomed in the city, even though a federal court judge ruled
Feb. 19 that it could stay.</TE>
<TE>   The club first opened Jan. 7 but shut down three days later
because city officials discovered that it was operating without
permits and within a city zone that did not allow adult-oriented
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   In the February ruling, U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian said
the club could open because it was unconstitutional to not allow a
business to operate and voided the city zoning ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also ruled that the club owners had 10 days to receive
all proper licenses and permits.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Pico Rivera Councilman David Armenta said the club does
not have the required permits, prompting a call to the county fire
inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Jon Diamond, the Smiths' attorney, said building plans have
been filed, a health inspection was made, and only one more
inspection needs to be made. The inspection to receive a certificate
of occupancy will be done Monday, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done everything to get this place opened," Diamond said.
"But every city does the same thing when you open up a strip club."</TE>
<TE>   The full-nude, 18-and-over club will have security guards and will
not serve alcohol. It is not the first time the Smiths have ventured
into the adult entertainment industry. The brothers own another
Imperial Showgirls in Anaheim and are involved with other adult
establishments.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, the Smiths purchased the Pico Rivera property,
which was once a billiard hall in the 9300 block of Slauson Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans have choices," said Diamond, a legal expert in
adult-oriented business. "Some choose to watch artistic, erotic
striptease dancing and some do not."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Friday, about 300 people marched and shouted outside
the club. Some protesters brought their children.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need a strip club," shouted 16-year-old Carina Farias,
encouraging passing motorists to honk their horns. "This is only
going to cause problems."</TE>
<TE>   City officials, religious leaders and residents, calling
themselves "the unwelcoming committee," protested along Slauson. They
vowed to picket and protest every day until the club is run out of
town.</TE>
<TE>   Joining residents at Friday's protests were Rep. Grace Napolitano
(D-Norwalk) and 58th Assembly District candidate Chuck Fuentes.</TE>
<TE>   "This will not be a successful business endeavor for the owners,"
Fuentes said. "We will picket until they are gone."</TE>
<TE>   Sammie Ramirez, 42, skipped work so she and her 18-year-old son,
Louis, could attend the protest.</TE>
<TE>   "Just over there is a McDonald's play area," said Ramirez as she
held a sign reading "No Nudes." "The owners do not care about the
residents of this city."</TE>

<HD>Tustin Gets Base; Uses Still Disputed</HD>
<DH>Development: The Navy will give up its former helicopter
site. A college district agrees to a land offer, but Santa Ana
Unified still hasn't.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Navy officials agreed late Thursday to give most of the closed Tustin
helicopter base to the city of Tustin, but tense negotiations
continue with the Santa Ana Unified School District, which wants part
of the land.</LD>
<LD>   The Navy will transfer the property even if Tustin cannot make a
deal with Santa Ana Unified, said Tustin City Manager William A.
Huston. But he said he hopes a pact would be ready to bring Monday to
trustees of Santa Ana Unified and Rancho Santiago Community College
District. The college district reached a tentative agreement this
week for part of the land.</LD>
<LD>   Settling the dispute "is in everyone's best interests," Huston
said Friday before rejoining the negotiations. "We're prepared to do
whatever it takes."</LD>
<TE>   Even though the Navy will give the land to Tustin, any attempt to
use it would be blocked by state law unless the city shares with the
schools. Under a law that took effect Jan. 1, Tustin cannot zone or
develop the 1,600-acre base unless the city gives 100 acres to the
Santa Ana districts or agrees to a different settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The law also complicates the Navy's plan to sell 240 acres of the
base for new homes and use the money to help pay for base closures
slated for 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin officials filed suit last week saying the state statute
interferes with the federal base-disposal process. But pursuing the
suit could tie up base development for years and would be costly to
the city, the districts and the military, Huston said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Tustin officials on Friday applauded the agreement with the
Navy as the first step in transforming the former Tustin Marine Corps
Helicopter Air Station, which closed in July 1999, into homes, a golf
course, schools, parks and businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "This signing was a huge milestone that we've been waiting a long
time for," Councilwoman Tracy Wills Worley said. "At the end of the
day, we've all had to compromise."</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Santiago college district officials agreed Thursday to
accept Tustin's offer of 15 acres within a 100-acre parcel called the
Learning Village that Tustin intended to give to the South Orange
County Community College District.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 22 acres in the same area have been offered to Santa
Ana Unified, plus $38 million from Tustin to the district for
purchase of land elsewhere to build a high school. The district has
had trouble finding suitable sites in Santa Ana, which has little
remaining undeveloped land.</TE>
<TE>   Possible contamination of those 22 acres offered by Tustin has
been the sticking point for months between Santa Ana Unified
officials and Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Unified officials want assurances that the designated 22
acres can pass rigorous tests required by the state Department of
Toxic Substances Control for potential school sites.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want to make sure that the deal makes sense for the
students and families of Santa Ana," Supt. Al Mijares said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been at this for four days, and I think we've made a lot of
progress. But we haven't resolved it."</TE>
<TE>   Mijares said he will meet with Tustin officials Monday to continue
hammering out details.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin and the Santa Ana school districts have been at odds for
eight years over the districts' request for property on the base.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>City Council members moved a step closer this week to adopting a
so-called living-wage ordinance.</LD>
<LD>   A majority of the council directed city staff at a meeting to draw
up a proposal guaranteeing $9 per hour plus health benefits, or
$11.25 per hour without the benefits, to city employees and employees
of city contractors.</LD>
<LD>   No deadline has been set to vote on such a plan, but at least two
council members would like to vote before July, when the new budget
year begins, said Das Williams, spokesman for the Ventura County
Living Wage Coalition.</LD>
<TE>   The plan could cost taxpayers about $1 million a year, Williams
said.</TE>

California 126 near Wells Road in Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   Eulala Keller, 85, was driving east when traffic began slowing
because of road construction, the California Highway Patrol reported.
Keller, who was traveling about 65 mph, apparently didn't slow
quickly enough and plowed into a car ahead of her, which then hit a
cement truck.</LD>
<LD>   A passing CHP officer gave Keller cardiopulmonary resuscitation
until paramedics arrived. She was taken to Santa Paula Memorial
Hospital, where she was pronounced dead about 2:30 p.m. The occupants
of the other two vehicles were not seriously injured, the CHP said.</LD>

<LD>Twenty drivers were issued citations at the same Oxnard intersection
this week for failure to yield during a safety check conducted by
local police.</LD>
<LD>   An undercover police sergeant in civilian clothes spent several
hours Wednesday morning walking across Pleasant Valley Road at
Perkins Road in a marked crosswalk.</LD>
<LD>   During the operation, the second of its kind in recent weeks,
patrol officers who were parked nearby cited drivers who failed to
stop for the sergeant, officials said. A driver who had yielded was
rear-ended by another driver who was not paying attention, officials
said. No one was injured.</LD>
<TE>   Police said they will conduct similar operations in the hope of
increasing pedestrian safety.</TE>

<HD>Fugitive Is Arrested in Shooting Deaths of 3 at Eastside
Party</HD>

<LD>A fugitive suspected of killing three people at a New Year's party in
Lincoln Heights was arrested as he tried to reenter the country from
Mexico, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service inspectors arrested
Javier Olivares Jr., 19, on Thursday night at the San Ysidro border
crossing, said Capt. Paul Pesqueira of the Los Angeles Police
Department.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said that early Jan. 1, a female accomplice drove
Olivares to a house in the 100 block of West Avenue 28, where he
approached a crowd and allegedly fired several shots from an assault
rifle. Felipe Meza and Juan Manuel Torres, both 20, and Leonel
Mendival, 29, were killed and a woman was injured.</LD>
<TE>   Olivares' alleged accomplice, Marcia Estrada, 27, was arrested on
unrelated charges in Kern County several days later. She was charged
in connection with the Jan. 1 shooting later that month, said Lt. Joe
Mariana.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses identified Olivares as a member of a local gang, and
said he was angry because a fellow gang member had "disrespected" one
of his female friends, Pesqueira said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was some type of argument several hours before [the
shooting] that didn't involve him," Pesqueira said. "The argument
involved two females. Another person got involved, and based on that
prior argument, he decides that he was going to do some payback
because he believed this friend of his was disrespected or perhaps
battered."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they think Olivares traveled to the Midwest. They
don't know when he left the country.</TE>
<TE>   Olivares, who is from the Mexican state of Jalisco, was a
passenger in a car with two others when a border inspector detained
him because he presented a photocopied birth certificate that
belonged to someone else, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   An electronic check of his fingerprints showed he was wanted by
the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   "This represents outstanding work by our officers," said Adele J.
Fasano, director of the immigration service's San Diego office.
"Technology plays an important role, but cases like this one are also
a testament to our officers' training and expertise."</TE>
<TE>   Detectives from the LAPD's Hollenbeck Division are returning
Olivares to Los Angeles, and he will be arraigned early next week,
Mariana said.</TE>

<HD>He Wants Best of Both Worlds</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Mandella sends Cagney and Kudos out for Santa
Anita Handicap today, then he'll think about Dubai.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since its inception in 1996, that race in the far-off desert, the
Dubai World Cup, has been a bugbear for local winter racing, coming
as it does on the heels of the Santa Anita Handicap. Such stellar
attractions as Soul Of The Matter, Silver Charm, Malek and Captain
Steve have skipped the Big 'Cap and then run only weeks later for the
bigger bucks in Dubai.</LD>
<LD>   But this year is a little different. With 14 horses, the biggest
field in 19 years, today's 65th Big 'Cap is not engulfed by the World
Cup, and in fact trainer Richard Mandella, who is running two horses
at Santa Anita, might be using the 11/4-mile race as a prep for
Dubai. A $1-million prep for a $6-million race? Well, why not?</LD>
<LD>   Mandella, one of only four trainers to win the Santa Anita
Handicap in consecutive years, has played the local race and the
Dubai World Cup all possible ways: He has skipped Santa Anita to run
in the desert; he has run the same horses in both races, despite the
8,800-mile one-way trip to Dubai; and he has run horses at Santa
Anita and then passed on the World Cup.</LD>
<TE>   This year, Mandella's plan, which recently went slightly awry, was
to combine those stratagems. He was going to withhold Redattore, his
San Antonio Handicap winner, from the Big 'Cap and run him in Dubai,
then assess Cagney and Kudos after their runs today at Santa Anita,
to see how much bounce-back they had in them. Cagney and Kudos are
still possible for Dubai, where Mandella horses have finished second
three times, but it appears that Redattore will stay home, the torn
frog area on the bottom of one of his feet needing extra time to
heal.</TE>
<TE>   Cagney and Kudos, 8-1 and 15-1, respectively, on the morning line,
are the kind of horses that Mandella does the best with in the Big
'Cap. He has started three favorites in the race--Gentlemen twice and
Best Pal--but his two winners sneaked up on the public and most
handicappers. In 1997, Siphon was 5-1 when he led an unprecedented
1-2-3 finish by Mandella, who was second with Sandpit and third with
Gentlemen. The next year, the wheels all but came off the historic
race when Silver Charm came up lame the day before, and when
Gentlemen, at five cents on the dollar, bled from the lungs and ran
last in a four-horse field. Malek's win, at the same 5-1 odds as
Siphon the year before, left Mandella looking like the Mona Lisa. In
1999, Malek didn't run in the Big 'Cap and finished second in Dubai.</TE>
<TE>   Sandpit's second-place finish in 1997, as an 8-year-old, came in
the 34th race of his career, but it was only his second start on
dirt. Cagney and Kudos are both 5-year-olds and Mandella hasn't
waited as long to see if they can be converted from grass to dirt.
Today will be Cagney's first dirt start since he ran for the first
time, finishing sixth, in Brazil in February 2000. Kudos' career
began in California with two lackluster dirt races, then after 14
starts on grass he returned to the main track on Feb. 17 and won the
San Marino Handicap at 11/4 miles. The San Marino, scheduled to be
run on grass, was switched to dirt because of rain.</TE>
<TE>   "It's funny," Mandella said. "Kudos had been working on the dirt
going into the San Marino and doing really well. A couple of weeks
before the race, I said to Jerry Moss [the owner of Kudos] that I
almost hoped it would rain, so we could try him on dirt."</TE>
<TE>   Mandella likes the way Cagney, a Brazilian-bred, is entering the
race. He won the Burke Handicap, on grass, at Santa Anita in October,
but then a month later finished 12th in the Japan Cup. In his last
start, on Jan. 21, Cagney was third, beaten by half a length, as
Irish Prize won the 11/4-mile San Marcos Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   "Since Japan," Mandella said, "he's been sharper than ever.
Usually making that trip all the way over there knocks a horse out,
but that hasn't happened with this one."</TE>
<TE>   Having traveled from Brazil to California, and then to Tokyo and
back, makes Cagney the sort that won't be affected by the long haul
to Dubai. Mandella hopes he runs well enough today to get a chance in
the World Cup on March 23. Running horses back that quickly in major
races isn't Mandella's style, but with Dubai there are special
considerations.</TE>
<TE>   "On average," Mandella said, "it's better not to run in the Santa
Anita Handicap if you're planning on Dubai. But most of the horses
I've run over there came out of South America and weren't eligible
for the Breeders' Cup, and it would have cost their owners too much
to supplement them. So the Dubai race becomes their Breeders' Cup.
It's early in the year, but there's no way around it."</TE>
<TE>   The Dubai World Cup started out at $4 million, but last year its
purse was bumped from $5 million to $6 million. It's now the richest
race in the world and $2 million more than the richest Breeders' Cup
race.</TE>
<TE>   "The Dubai purse is sure part of the equation," the puckish
Mandella said. "We all have our price, don't we, and $6 million is
mine. But at least you can say that I'm not cheap."</TE>
<TE>   Pat Valenzuela, who rides Western Pride in the Santa Anita
Handicap, rode two winners Friday that were disqualified to second
place by the stewards. In the third race, Valenzuela's mount, Calzada
Kid, won by 11/2 lengths but was penalized for crowding the favorite,
Qui's Rush In, in the stretch. Qui's Rush In was moved to first
place. In the last race, Song Minister and Valenzuela beat Timely
Runner by a neck, but they were disqualified for drifting out in the
stretch. Timely Runner was declared the winner. Timely Runner had
been winless in 13 starts and the DQ gave Qui's Rush In her first win
in nine tries.... High Society, making her U.S. debut and running for
the first time in six months, won the La Habra Stakes by one length
in 1:124/5, fastest clocking for the stake since it was switched from
a dirt race to the distance of about 61/2 furlongs on grass in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Came Home, winner of four of five starts, is the 4-5 morning-line
favorite for today's San Rafael, a prep for the Santa Anita Derby.
Fonz's, who had two wins and two seconds in four starts last year and
was runner-up to Siphonic in the Hollywood Futurity, is 7-2.</TE>
<TE>   Val Royal, winner of the Breeders' Cup Mile in October in his last
start, is the 2-1 favorite in the Jimmy Kilroe Mile. Val Royal began
last year with a second-place finish behind Road To Slew in the
Kilroe. At 3-1 is Irish Prize, who was fourth in the Breeders' Cup.
Irish Prize has already won at the meet, scoring a victory against
Continental Red in the San Marcos Handicap.... Jerry Bailey will ride
Repent in the Louisiana Derby on March 10 and Gary Stevens will ride
High Star in the Florida Derby on March 16.... Arromanches, a
9-year-old that had won 10 in a row, finished fifth Thursday for for
a $65,000 claiming price at Aqueduct.</TE>

<HD>Another Last Shot for Kobe</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Bryant brawls with Reggie Miller after the
final buzzer in Lakers' 96-84 victory over Pacers. Suspension
expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The game had ended. But the action was just beginning.</LD>
<LD>   As the Lakers were walking off the court after beating the Indiana
Pacers, 96-84, Friday night at Staples Center, the Lakers' Kobe
Bryant and the Pacers' Reggie Miller met at half court.</LD>
<LD>   Arms out in front, palms open, they appeared to be talking. The
talking appeared to get louder.</LD>
<TE>   Suddenly, Bryant took a swing at Miller with his right hand.
Miller grabbed Bryant in a bearhug and the two tumbled over the
scorer's table.</TE>
<TE>   Players and coaches from both sides waded in to break it up.</TE>
<TE>   When the players were separated, Indiana's Austin Croshere
appeared to have suffered the most damage. His uniform in tatters,
scratches around his neck and down his back, he looked as if he had
been wrestling a lion.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody comes at me, I'm going to defend myself," Bryant said in
a statement. He and Miller weren't available for more explanations.</TE>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson was cautious in his comments.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a hotly contested ballgame," he said, "and a very physical
basketball game out there. After the game, it looked like Kobe and
Miller lined up and went after each other.... I imagine there was a
lot of talking going on during the course of the game."</TE>
<TE>   As for Bryant's recent tendency to speak with his fists (he
punched Samaki Walker last week), Jackson said, "He has been very
aggressive basketball-wise and I don't mind that as long as it is
within the context of playing basketball."</TE>
<TE>   Does Jackson feel it is inevitable Bryant will be suspended?</TE>
<TE>   "More than likely," Jackson said. "I am not going to feed into it,
but we are going to have to deal with that on Sunday for sure."</TE>
<TE>   It all happened so suddenly.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought they were going to say goodbye," Laker forward Robert
Horry said. "That's all I know. Then all hell broke loose.</TE>
<TE>   "Kobe was just being Kobe. Going out and playing hard and things
happen. I don't know what was going on in his head. I was kind of
surprised."</TE>
<TE>   Horry looked at the crowd of reporters and added, "You know, we
also had a game tonight."</TE>
<TE>   That they did.</TE>
<TE>   Led by Shaquille O'Neal's 33 points (14 of 21 from the floor) and
12 rebounds and Bryant's 25 points, the Lakers zoomed into an early
lead, were caught in the fourth quarter, but then pulled away to
improve to 40-17.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal and another Miller, Brad, were supposed to be the centers
of combustion when the game began.</TE>
<TE>   In the past few days, O'Neal kept saying his differences with Brad
Miller were in the past and he was moving on.</TE>
<TE>   Right, moving on, over, around and through Miller.</TE>
<TE>   It has been nearly two months since O'Neal popped a gasket in
Chicago when he felt Miller, then a member of the Bulls, was
overdoing the Hack-a-Shaq routine. O'Neal took a wild swing at
Miller, but missed his target.</TE>
<TE>   For that, O'Neal was suspended three games and fined $15,000.</TE>
<TE>   Friday night, O'Neal and Miller, subsequently traded to the
Pacers, met again.</TE>
<TE>   And O'Neal, who has refused to comment on their earlier
confrontation, let his feelings be known on the court.</TE>
<TE>   He easily won the opening tipoff from Miller.</TE>
<TE>   And then, he easily went to the hoop.</TE>
<TE>   Again and again and again.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal scored on a turnaround jump shot, a layup, a dunk. It began
to look like a layup drill.</TE>
<TE>   He scored the first eight Laker points as they took an 11-0 lead
and 11 of their first 13.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind Miller. At the rate he was going, O'Neal was taking aim
at Wilt Chamberlain and his record 100 points in a single game.</TE>
<TE>   The way the game turned out, the Lakers didn't even get 100
points.</TE>
<TE>   With the Pacers sending 7-foot Jermaine O'Neal and 6-11 Jeff
Foster into the defensive battle with O'Neal along with Miller, the
Laker center finished the first half with 19 points in 19 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   And what looked at first like an O'Neal highlight film turned into
a tight game.</TE>
<TE>   After taking a 23-8 lead in the first quarter, Lakers finished the
period up 26-16. By the half, Indiana cut the lead to eight at 49-41.
By the end of three quarters, the Lakers were clinging to a 69-67
advantage.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of the fourth quarter, Croshere, trying to get around
defender Mark Madsen at the three-point line, hesitated too long,
letting the 24-second clock run out.</TE>
<TE>   But a minute later, he found himself again face to face with
Madsen. And this time, Croshere got around Madsen for the layup that
enabled the Pacers to tie the score for the first time since O'Neal
won the opening tipoff.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Marathon Duel Isn't So Clear-Cut</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A duel of champions. That's how organizers of the Los Angeles
Marathon have billed the men's division of the race that will held
for the 17th time Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Benson Mbithi, the 2000 champion, versus last year's winner,
Stephen Ndungu.</LD>
<LD>   And the race might well turn out that way.</LD>
<TE>   But don't be surprised if neither Kenyan is the first man to cross
the finish line of the reconfigured 26-mile 385-yard course, which
will start at Grand Avenue near Second Street and finish on Hope
Street just north of Olympic Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   No man has won consecutive titles in the L.A. Marathon.</TE>
<TE>   Only one, Art Boileau of Canada in 1987 and 1989, has won two
men's titles.</TE>
<TE>   More significant, the marathon--any marathon--is an extremely
unpredictable race. Of all the track and field events contested in
the Olympic Games or World Championships, few have had as many gold
medalists who were not among the pre-meet favorites as the marathon.</TE>
<TE>   The longer the race, the greater the opportunity for things to go
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   A runner who is experiencing an off day on the track, in a race
such as the 1,500 meters, can often overcome that condition by
employing better tactics than his or her competitors.</TE>
<TE>   An off day is more difficult to overcome in the marathon because
it can lead to an elite runner running several minutes slower than
usual.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, elite marathoners who run the best race of their
lives can cut two or three minutes off their previous best.</TE>
<TE>   All of which means that any man in Sunday's race who has run 2
hours 15 minutes or faster could conceivably contend for the title in
a race that Mbithi and Ndungu expect to be won in the range of 2:09
to 2:10. Runners with notable accomplishments on the track also have
made some smashing debuts in major marathons over the years.</TE>
<TE>   That makes Julio Valle of Mexico worth watching Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Valle won the 10,000 meters in the Mount San Antonio College
Relays in 1998, and his career bests of 28:14.38 in that event and
13:33.84 in the 5,000 are faster than anybody else in the field.</TE>
<TE>   Those facts don't make Valle a favorite, but they bode well for
him if he is among the leaders in the final miles of the race.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Burke, president of the L.A. Marathon, might have gotten a
little carried away earlier in the week when he said that the winner
of the men's race might break 2:07 if the weather is right Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   A redesigned, flatter course will no doubt lead to faster times
than in previous years, but a sub-2:07 clocking would make the winner
only the 15th man in history to break that barrier.</TE>

<HD>Arkansas Buys Out Coach</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Richardson gets $3-million deal after
controversial statements involving race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nolan Richardson coached Arkansas to the 1994 NCAA men's basketball
title and helped pave the way for a generation of African American
coaches, but his long career at the school ended Friday when Arkansas
bought out his contract in the wake of Richardson's complaints he is
treated differently because he is black.</LD>
<LD>   Chancellor John White called the decision difficult and didn't
cite Richardson's remarks in his written statement, but agreed with
Athletic Director Frank Broyles that it was "time for a change in
leadership for the best interests of the basketball team."</LD>
<LD>   The school will pay Richardson $3 million for the remaining six
years of his contract.</LD>
<TE>   Richardson, who hired a Little Rock civil rights attorney this
week, had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   It had been a rare season of frustration for Richardson, whose
Razorbacks are 13-14.</TE>
<TE>   The week of turmoil began last Saturday when Richardson said after
a loss to Kentucky that, "If they go ahead and pay me my money, they
can take the job tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Then, in a rambling and impassioned speech at a news conference
Monday, he complained that none of the reporters in the room were
black, and that he was treated differently as the only black among
the 17 head coaches at the school.</TE>
<TE>   "See, my great-great-grandfather came over on the ship, I didn't,"
he said. "And I don't think you understand what I'm saying. My
great-great-grandfather came over on the ship. Not Nolan Richardson.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not come over on that ship, so I expect to be treated a
little bit different.... Because I know for a fact that I do not play
on the same level as the other coaches around this school play on. I
know that you know that. And people of my color know that. And that
angers me."</TE>
<TE>   Richardson also said this week that, socially, Fayetteville "is
not that good for a black athlete."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the program's academic record faced criticism Friday
when a previously scheduled ESPN "Outside the Lines" program focused
on Arkansas as one of 36 men's basketball programs that had a 0%
graduation rate for African American players who entered school from
1990 to '94.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Richardson's comments that created a public stir, and
he was summoned to two days of meetings with the chancellor and
athletic director after White said there had been "a lot of overall
damage to the program."</TE>
<TE>   Richardson expressed a desire to stay at Arkansas, but those talks
ended Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "He has made many valuable contributions to the University of
Arkansas and has provided exemplary service to causes and charities
throughout the state," White said in a statement. "His legacy will
last forever, but it is now time to look to the future."</TE>
<TE>   Temple Coach John Chaney, a close friend of Richardson's who spoke
to him during the week, criticized Arkansas on Friday for lack of
loyalty after Richardson's 17 years at the school, saying he believes
Richardson's outbursts were triggered when he learned his job was in
danger.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the most important statement Nolan made was, 'Where
there's smoke, there's fire,'" Chaney said. "He was angry and
frustrated that somebody leaked something about letting him go.</TE>
<TE>   "Nolan figures like I do: Some of us, black or white, when we've
been around that long and been loyal to the university, to have fans
or any reporter question what we do isn't right.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very proud man, and rightfully so. He brought about a lot
of pride to the state of Arkansas and all that know him. He
participated in the fight for youngsters, working very hard in the
Black Coaches Assn. to try to bring opportunity to youngsters.</TE>
<TE>   "He's something special. For the administration to do what they
did to him, I think that's unfair....</TE>
<TE>   "A guy who has been so good, they can look past that.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he made his statement because he got very angry.</TE>
<TE>   "Arkansas, I don't know how many black coaches they have--you tell
me if he was not speaking for all of us. They're in the SEC, which
doesn't have a black football coach anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "I honestly believe he's really telling it like it is."</TE>
<TE>   Richardson led Arkansas to three Final Four appearances and five
conference championships. His coaching record, including five seasons
at Tulsa, is 508-206 with 16 NCAA appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant coach Mike Anderson is to take over as interim coach for
Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   Though Richardson is expected to resurface as a college or NBA
coach, his legacy includes a series of "firsts" for African
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   During his college career at Texas Western, he was the only black
player on a team that after he left became famous as the first NCAA
champion with an all-black starting five in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   He later became the first African American junior college coach in
Texas, and was the first black Division I coach in the state of
Oklahoma when he was hired at Tulsa.</TE>
<TE>   When Arkansas joined the SEC, he was the first black coach in
conference history.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a tremendous, tremendous basketball coach," said Oregon
Coach Ernie Kent, a member of the board of directors of the National
Assn. of Basketball Coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been one of those trend-setters for young black coaches like
myself.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got into this, you looked at Nolan, George Raveling, John
Chaney, John Thompson. Those were the guys you looked at. They opened
the door for us.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too bad, because he's done so many great things, so many
positive things, for the school."</TE>

<HD>Hasegawa Wasn't in a Hurry to Leave</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PEORIA, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>As Shigetoshi Hasegawa stands in the Seattle Mariners' clubhouse, he
hasn't quite gotten over his divorce from the Angels.</LD>
<LD>   "I put the Seattle uniform on, and I feel like an enemy," Hasegawa
said before the Angels' 15-2 Cactus League victory over the Mariners
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Hasegawa didn't want to leave the Angels, the team with which he
signed after jumping from Japanese baseball to the major leagues. He
served as a reliable reliever during his five years with the Angels,
lived in Newport Beach year-round, and developed into one of the
team's more popular players.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels released him in December, but not before making him a
one-year contract offer that included a raise from his 2001 salary of
$1.15 million. The Angels also warned Hasegawa and his agent, Ed
Kleven, that if a contract agreement could not be reached, the team
would release the pitcher rather than risk an arbitration hearing, in
which his salary could have been doubled.</TE>
<TE>   If Hasegawa wanted to stay and the Angels offered a raise, why
didn't he sign? Neither the pitcher nor his agent would reveal what
the Angels offered, but Hasegawa said the bid was considerably below
market value. Kleven denied that the players' union deemed the offer
too low and pressured Hasegawa to reject it. Hasegawa also said he
had hoped that the Angels would offer a multiyear contract.</TE>
<TE>   In signing with the Mariners, Hasegawa did well. Seattle signed
him for this season, at a base salary of about $1.7 million, with
incentives and a 2003 option that could increase the value of the
deal to $4.5 million over two years.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners have reached the playoffs the past two seasons. "I've
never been there," Hasegawa said. "I want to play in October too."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This could have been Shawn Wooten's big break. It was not, and for
that he is very grateful.</TE>
<TE>   A pitch from Seattle's Freddy Garcia hit Wooten on his left hand,
driving Wooten to his knees in pain. Minutes later, as he walked off
the field with a trainer, Wooten took off his batting helmet and
slammed it to the ground, convinced a bone was broken and his spot on
the opening-day roster was in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for Wooten, X-rays revealed nothing more than a bad
bruise, and he is expected to miss only a few days, pending the
results of follow-up exams. Wooten, who will split time with Scott
Spiezio at first base this season, was still in pain, but relieved.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to fight for a job," Wooten said. "[Missing] four to
six weeks or longer would definitely hamper that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When the Angels traded infielder Wilmy Caceres to the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays for pitcher Mickey Callaway in December, it appeared Angel
General Manager Bill Stoneman had swapped a good-field, no-hit
shortstop prospect for a pitcher who could start in triple A or
relieve in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   The trade suddenly got better for the Angels Thursday, when the
Devil Rays learned Caceres is 28, not 23. At that age, he is no
longer a prospect.</TE>
<TE>   And, of all the Dominicans revealed this spring to be older than
reported, Caceres is not the typical one or two years older, but
five.</TE>
<TE>   "He might get the cup for biggest lie," Stoneman joked.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had 19 hits in the victory, including three from Tim
Salmon and a home run from Darin Erstad.... The Angels agreed to
terms on one-year contracts with 11 players, including second baseman
Adam Kennedy ($375,000), shortstop David Eckstein ($280,000), Wooten
($250,000), pitcher Ben Weber ($240,000) and pitcher Matt Wise
($215,000).... Single-game tickets for the 2002 season go on sale
today. The Edison Field box office opens at 9 a.m.</TE>

<HD>Rookie Takes Mound After Darr Accident</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ben Howard made his San Diego Padre debut Friday, pitching two weeks
after surviving an auto accident that killed teammate Mike Darr and
one of Darr's friends.</LD>
<LD>   Howard pitched 12/3 innings of a 6-1 loss to the Colorado Rockies
at Tucson. He came on with one out in the fourth inning and struck
out Todd Helton and Todd Zeile. In the fifth, Howard walked Benny
Agbayani but did not give up a hit or run.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm still trying to recover," said Howard, whose fastball was
clocked as high as 92 mph. "My ribs are still pretty sore. But I
think it's coming back pretty well. My arm feels good."</LD>
<TE>   Howard, 23, has been advised not to talk publicly about the
accident that killed Darr and Duane Johnson on Feb. 15. The SUV Darr
was driving rolled over on a highway near the Padres' camp in Peoria,
Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona highway patrol officials said the accident appeared to be
alcohol related. Darr and Johnson were not wearing seat belts and
were ejected. Howard, a passenger in the back seat, was wearing a
seat belt and sustained minor injuries that did not require
hospitalization.</TE>
<TE>   Howard spent most of last season at Class-A Lake Elsinore, where
he was 8-2 with a 2.83 earned-run average. He is not a candidate to
make the Padres' opening day roster.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has come to see how I'm doing," Howard said of his
teammates. "That's helped me out a lot. They haven't let me just sit
in my locker by myself with my thoughts."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Cub outfielder Sammy Sosa will miss two to three days
after straining his right ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Sosa was injured during Thursday's game against San Francisco.
X-rays Friday were negative.</TE>
<TE>   "Its nothing to be alarmed about," Cub Manager Don Baylor said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati Red right-handers Chris Booker and Jose Silva are
scheduled for arthroscopic surgery on Monday. Booker has torn
cartilage in his right shoulder and could miss the entire season.
Silva is to have bone chips removed from his right elbow and could be
back in mid-May.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The New York Mets signed outfielder Jay Payton and three other
players to one-year contracts. Outfielder Gary Matthews Jr. and
pitcher Kane Davis, both acquired since last season, and
infielder-outfielder Jorge Toca also signed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former players Bill Madlock, Tom Lawless and Jeff Newman were
hired by the commissioner's office as field assistants and will
report to Bob Watson.</TE>

<LD>   Utah State (21-5, 13-4) at Cal State Northridge (11-15, 10-7),
7--The Matadors are playing to improve their seeding for next week's
Big West Conference tournament. They can also keep the Aggies from
winning the regular-season title outright. Northridge is coming off a
stellar defensive effort in holding Idaho to 46 points, the lowest
total by a Matador opponent in 12 years. Utah State's chances for an
NCAA at-large berth may have disappeared in its loss to Pacific
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Cal State Fullerton (4-22, 1-16) at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo
(15-10, 9-8), 7--This is Fullerton's last chance to equal its victory
total of a year ago. The Titans, who have lost 10 consecutive games,
came close Thursday against UC Santa Barbara, but lost, 54-52.
Fullerton guard Ryan Dillon made seven of 10 three-point shots and
finished with 22 points. Cal Poly, which will be seeded sixth in the
conference tournament, defeated Riverside, 65-60, on Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   UC Riverside (8-17, 5-12) at UC Santa Barbara (16-10, 10-7), 7,
KPRO (1570)--Riverside, ending its first season as a member of the
Big West, is coming off a 60-65 loss to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.
Santa Barbara wants to keep its momentum as the Gauchos prepare for
next week's conference tournament. Santa Barbara defeated Cal State
Fullerton, 54-52, on Thursday when guard Jacoby Atako made two free
throws and had a steal in the final 10 seconds.</TE>

<HD>Pagan Leads Way for Verbum Dei</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It was no surprise that Los Angeles Verbum Dei standouts Richard
Chaney and Tai Turner turned in big performances Friday during the
Eagles' Southern Section Division IV-A boys' basketball championship
game.</LD>
<LD>   But Michael Pagan? A 5-foot-7 point guard who couldn't sleep the
night before because of derogatory comments about him on the
Internet? A little-known sophomore who said he had "dinosaurs" in his
stomach because he was nervous?</LD>
<LD>   On his way to scoring a career-high 22 points in top-seeded Verbum
Dei's 84-75 victory over third-seeded Gardena Serra before a
near-capacity crowd at Loyola Marymount, Pagan was a Tyrannosaurus
Rex. He played with poise and precision against Serra's Eugene Jeter
after reading Internet reports saying he wouldn't be able to keep up
with the heralded guard. Pagan had six rebounds and four assists.</LD>
<TE>   "[He] played one heck of a game," Serra Coach Dwan Hurt said of
Pagan, who hit a three-pointer during a 10-0 run in the third quarter
to put Verbum Dei comfortably ahead. "He hit the shots when they
needed him to and handled the press."</TE>
<TE>   Chaney scored 23 points and grabbed 12 rebounds and Turner added
18 points for Verbum Dei (27-3), which won its first section title
since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "I've really been waiting for a day like this," said Pagan, who
transferred to Verbum Dei after spending his freshman season at Long
Beach Poly. "I feel great."</TE>
<TE>   Jeter scored 24 points but made only six of 24 shots for Serra
(26-4).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake 80, El Segundo 62--Sophomore
forward Bryce Taylor scored 10 of his team-high 29 points during a
19-5 run in the first half of the Division IV-AA final at Loyola,
leading the second-seeded Wolverines (26-5) to their first section
title since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded El Segundo (27-5), which trailed by 18 points at
halftime, cut its deficit to 68-60 on a three-pointer by Jeramie
Hopson, who finished with 23 points, midway through the fourth
quarter before Harvard-Westlake responded with a 10-0 run to put the
game away.</TE>
<TE>   Dashawn Strong had 31 points for the Eagles, who shot 64% from the
field in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Weinstein added 18 points for Harvard-Westlake.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Palos Verdes Estates Rolling Hills Prep 79, L.A. Ribet Academy
70--Sophomores Curtis Allen, D.J. Wright and Jason Daley combined for
67 points as the top-seeded Huskies (20-6) pulled away from the
second-seeded Fighting Frogs (20-9) in the Division V-AA championship
game at Loyola for their first section title since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Allen scored 28 points on 12-of-19 shooting, Wright added 21
points on seven-of-11 shooting and Daley had 18 points on six-of-nine
shooting for Rolling Hills Prep, which shot a blistering 78.9% from
the field in the second half and 60.4% for the game.</TE>
<TE>   Lionnell Johnson made a steal and converted a three-point play to
put Ribet ahead, 50-48, late in the third quarter before Rolling
Hills Prep went on an 11-0 run to take control. Wright scored five
points during the decisive push.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Price 84, Tarzana Stoneridge Prep 46--The Knights became the
fifth team to win four consecutive Southern Section championships by
storming to the Division V-A title at Loyola.</TE>
<TE>   Price (27-6) took a 25-3 lead after the first quarter as
Stoneridge Prep missed 16 of 17 shots and committed 11 turnovers.
Four players finished in double figures for the top-seeded Knights,
led by Derrick Williams with 19.</TE>
<TE>   James Spencer scored 18 points to lead second-seeded Stoneridge
Prep (23-6).</TE>
<TE>   Price's 38-point victory was the third-biggest margin in a final
in the section's 87-year tournament history, equaling the difference
in Price's victory over Antelope Valley Christian last year.</TE>

<LD>David Wells has returned to the Yankees as a slimmer, and reportedly
more health-conscious, pitcher than he was when he played for New
York in 1997 and 1998.</LD>
<LD>   John Harper of the New York Daily News commented on the change in
his lifestyle: "With the help of a personal trainer he hired after
his back surgery in July, Wells went from party animal to workout
fanatic.</LD>
<LD>   "He lost 30 pounds and dropped his body fat to 15% from 23%. He
even gave up beer for six months."</LD>
<TE>   Said Wells: "I'll still go out and have a social cocktail, I'm
sure there will be times when I'll have more than one or two. But
it's really not a big part of my nature anymore."</TE>
<TE>   At least, in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the men's NCAA Division I basketball record
for points in a game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Perfect match: Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle on Bill
Romanowski joining the Oakland Raiders: "They lost their beloved
coach [Jon Gruden], their aging players have aged another year, and
the only thing that can save this team is an infusion of dark and
menacing attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "Romo just might be the man who can lead the Raiders back to the
Stone Age."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Romo: "I'm glad Romanowski has joined the Raiders," Chronicle
reader Michael Cannon said. "But since he was acquitted on charges of
illegally obtaining prescription diet pills last year, I'm surprised
he had enough of a criminal record to qualify."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lame excuse: Mike Piazza commenting to the New York Daily News
about the owners blaming the players for making too much money: "It's
like smokers suing the cigarette companies or the obese people suing
McDonald's. Nobody forced them to overspend."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He'll fit in: Ken Rudulph of Fox's "Best Damn Sports Show Period"
on John Rocker's movie role as a homicidal maniac who slashed teens
at a country club birthday party: "Rocker had such a good time making
the movie, he plans to star in another horror film this summer
titled, 'The Texas Rangers Pitching Staff.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First things first: Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times: "That's
a good idea to put ivy on the outside of Wrigley Field.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, how about some players inside."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1957, Lou Filippo was declared the
winner over Carlos Ortiz at Hollywood Legion Stadium. Referee Dick
Young disqualified Ortiz for hitting after the bell in the ninth
round.</TE>
<TE>   Within an hour, State Athletic Commission officials changed the
verdict to "no decision."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz went on to win the world lightweight title in 1962.</TE>
<TE>   Filippo retired and later became a world-class referee, working
more than 100 championship bouts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Frank Selvy of Furman, 100 points against Newberry
on Feb. 13, 1954.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: When Chicago Bull forward Charles Oakley was told
that he would play less than his younger teammates for the remainder
of the regular season, this was his reply: "I'm cool with whatever.
I'll just keep eating my bread, sipping my soup and serving my time.
But the chicken is going to lay some more eggs one day."</TE>

<LD>Ninth-ranked Marquette, led by Dwyane Wade with 16 points, capped an
undefeated home season Friday night by defeating DePaul, 72-53, at
Milwaukee.</LD>
<LD>   The victory keeps the Golden Eagles alive in their quest for a
Conference USA title.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a great way for us to close out the [regular] season,"
Marquette Coach Tom Crean said.</LD>
<TE>   Marquette (24-5, 13-3) would be the American Division co-champion
if Memphis, the National Division champion, wins Sunday at No. 4
Cincinnati (26-3, 13-2).</TE>

last two games--at Cincinnati and East Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Lance Williams scored 12 points and Andre Brown 10 for the Blue
Demons (9-19, 2-14), who shot 30% (16 of 54).</TE>
<TE>   They started nine of 14, then went seven of 40.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to win shooting like that," DePaul Coach Pat

<TE>   The Golden Eagles opened the second half with a 12-4 run to take a
53-38 lead. The Blue Demons didn't get closer than 10 the rest of the
game.</TE>
<TE>   The sellout crowd of 18,788 at the Bradley Center set a record as

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Maggette Probably Is Out for the Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Corey Maggette probably will sit out the rest of the regular season
because of dislocated bones in his right hand, Clipper Coach Alvin
Gentry said Friday. Maggette, who had been filling in for the injured
Lamar Odom as the team's starting small forward, also had
arthroscopic surgery on his left knee Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll be surprised if Corey plays again this year," Gentry said.
"He's going to be out at least another month, and that gets us into
April. It doesn't make sense to rush him back as the season is
winding down. If we're in the playoffs, it's a different story."</LD>
<LD>   Maggette injured himself during the Clippers' loss last week at
Orlando, punching the scorer's table in anger after a referee's call
went against him. He had been nursing a sore knee for several months
and it was decided that he would undergo the arthroscopic procedure
while his hand injury sidelined him.</LD>
<TE>   "If anyone can do it, he can," Gentry said of Maggette's wish to
return before the end of the regular season. "I told him not to get
crazy with this thing. He's got to be healthy before he plays again.
It's funny. He's played through the knee, an elbow, a shoulder and he
does this to himself."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry also indicated backup point guard Keyon Dooling might be
sidelined for most of the rest of the season and the team is seeking
free-agent help for the short term. Dooling suffered a sprained left
ankle Nov. 14 and is not yet sound.</TE>
<TE>   "At this stage, we're not going to rush him back," Gentry said.
"We're also not going to have just two point guards [starter Jeff
McInnis and backup Earl Boykins] on our roster."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Michael Olowokandi practiced with the team Friday and will
play tonight. Olowokandi sprained his left knee Monday against
Memphis and did not play Tuesday against Houston. An MRI exam taken
Thursday was negative.</TE>

<TE>   Update--The teams have not played since the Clippers lost to the
Warriors in their home opener Nov. 3 at Staples Center. Golden State
has lost nine of 11, including Friday's home loss to the Sacramento
Kings. Tonight's game is the lone home game for the Clippers in a
stretch during which they play nine of 10 on the road. They were 3-2
on their recent trip to Miami, Orlando, Indiana, Memphis and Houston.
They begin a four-game trip Wednesday against the Bucks at Milwaukee.</TE>

<DH>Dickau Became Gonzaga's Latest Unselfish Superstar With an
Assist From the Original, John Stockton</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SPOKANE, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Jack and Dan's tavern sits a few blocks from the Gonzaga campus, the
sort of place where Dan Dickau's parents stop for a sandwich when
they're in town and college kids gather to watch their Zags.</LD>
<LD>   It is most remarkable in what it doesn't announce.</LD>
<LD>   "You walk in and you have no idea John Stockton's dad owns the
place," said Dickau, the Gonzaga point guard. "I think there's maybe
two Utah Jazz pennants up. I think there's maybe one neon Utah Jazz
sign, then a portrait of John and Karl Malone. I think that's
probably all there is. And it's not like those things are right in
front where everyone can see."</LD>
<TE>   The biggest nod to basketball on a recent night, in fact, was a
board that read "Watch the Zags here! See Dan Dickau [move up] on the
all-time assist list."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a place that doesn't call attention to the family or
anything like that," Dickau said. "I think that's how John Stockton
approaches the game of basketball."</TE>
<TE>   Dickau is the latest heir to Stockton at Gonzaga, and he has taken
the Bulldogs to a height Stockton's teams never reached, a No. 7
national ranking. They'll defend it in the West Coast Conference
tournament beginning today in San Diego--for once, in no desperate
need of winning to make the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   No one is suggesting Dickau will ever become the NBA's all-time
assist and steal leader, but already he has followed in Stockton's
steps, finding a rare opportunity to learn from the player he admires
more than any other.</TE>
<TE>   As a youngster in Vancouver, Wash., Dickau collected Stockton
trading cards. He even wore Stockton's No. 12 in high school and for
two seasons at the University of Washington before he let go of the
idea he had to play in the Pacific 10 and followed his heart and a
high school teammate, Zach Gourde, to Spokane.</TE>
<TE>   It was a move that seemed puzzling then and looks brilliant now,
but it was where Dickau had to leave No. 12 behind, even though
Gonzaga has yet to officially retire Stockton's number.</TE>
<TE>   "I never actually asked for his number because I knew I wasn't
going to get it," Dickau said. "I knew 12 wasn't going to be handed
out. So I just basically asked if I could get 21. I figure that was
the closest thing I could get, just reverse the numbers and make it
21."</TE>
<TE>   It has been a lucky 21 for Dickau, almost matching the 20.6-point
scoring average that has helped make him a Wooden Award candidate.</TE>
<TE>   He's no pure gunner, but a savvy point guard who runs the offense
and hands out almost five assists a game. He also shoots the lights
out from three-point range--a distance from which he approaches 50%,
making 102 of 214 this season.</TE>
<TE>   He is a gym rat and a basketball purist. And when Stockton is in
town preparing for training camp in the fall, that makes two of them.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I knew he helped out the guys a little bit and he
played pickup, but I never imagined I'd be coming down in the
mornings and hanging around with John Stockton and shooting around,"
Dickau said.</TE>
<TE>   But that's the way it went, particularly last fall, when Dickau--a
graduate student who already has earned his degree--had a light class
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Together, they got ready for the season.</TE>
<TE>   "He loves to play. He'll stay in the gym all day long," Stockton
told the Salt Lake Tribune. "He's a leader. He's tough. He's a
competitor. Guys with those qualities, they usually keep getting
better and better."</TE>
<TE>   In the mornings, Dickau and Stockton met at the gym, where they'd
shoot for about an hour, then just talk hoops.</TE>
<TE>   In the afternoons, Stockton joined the Gonzaga players for pickup
games.</TE>
<TE>   You could say Dickau had a heavy class load after all.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you get a chance to play against the greatest point
guard ever, you can't help but learn," Dickau said.</TE>
<TE>   "Every pass of his is in the right spot. It's almost unbelievable
how [Stockton] enters the ball into the post and it's exactly in the
right spot to lead the player into the move.</TE>
<TE>   "If a guy comes off a screen, almost every time, it's right in the
shooting pocket so it's almost effortless to shoot.</TE>
<TE>   "If he's driving into the lane penetrating, he always knows where
his 'outs' are if his lane to the basket gets cut off. He sees
everything. He's just an amazing player."</TE>
<TE>   The comparisons are inevitable, and they are silly.</TE>
<TE>   One player is one of the 50 greatest in NBA history. The other is
a college senior.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think in those terms--never have," said Stockton, the
only first-round draft pick Gonzaga has produced, in 1984. "But I
know we never went to the Elite Eight or the Sweet Sixteen when I was
there.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't play the kind of schedule they play now. So I think
it's fair to say he's doing what he's doing against better
competition."</TE>
<TE>   The seeds for Gonzaga's success were sown before Dickau arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Santangelo and Casey Calvary were the stars of the teams that
made it to the Elite Eight and the Sweet Sixteen in 1999 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Dickau sat out the 1999-2000 season under transfer rules, then
helped Gonzaga back to the Sweet Sixteen last season.</TE>
<TE>   This season, with Calvary's distinguished career over, it became
Dickau's team.</TE>
<TE>   "He spent his redshirt year here learning to see things from a
coach's perspective," said Mark Few, who took over as Gonzaga's coach
after the team's first NCAA run in 1999 and has taken the program to
even greater prominence. "He's such a smart player, and he's gotten
quite a bit bigger and stronger.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody works harder at his game than Dan. He's just--I don't want
to say psycho, but he's very organized and dedicated.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got his routine. He shoots 200, 300 shots a day and takes
care of his body. I think he and John are very much alike that way.
They do a great job of working on their basketball skills, taking
care of their bodies. He's in great shape, stretches, eats right.
I've never even seen him drink pop."</TE>
<TE>   He is a young man who has the world by a string.</TE>
<TE>   At Gonzaga games, the crowd rocks out to a version of the old
Commodores' song "Brick House," with lyrics adapted in praise of
Dickau.</TE>
<TE>   He's Dan Dick-au....</TE>
<TE>   He don't talk trash, just plays good 'D'</TE>
<TE>   Makes the other team look like jayvee</TE>
<TE>   He knows he's smart, he'll earn a degree</TE>
<TE>   And he can knock down game-winning threes</TE>
<TE>   Aw, he's Dan Dick-au....</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe someone sat down and took the time to write a
song," Dickau said. "It's ... different. I don't know. It's cool,
though. If someone wants to write a song, it shows us we're doing
something right as a team.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've got one of the greatest student sections in the
country. They're pretty sweet."</TE>
<TE>   He's also getting a lot of notice for his engagement to a Portland
Trail Blazer dancer. Dickau and Heather Nevenner plan to be married
Aug. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Having an NBA dancer for a fiancee seems a little flashy until you
understand they've known each other since high school, where she
played basketball too.</TE>
<TE>   "Her senior year, she won a state championship," Dickau said. "I
never got one. That's a sore spot with me."</TE>
<TE>   They talk about the what-ifs next year--whether Nevenner, an
aspiring elementary school teacher, might keep dancing wherever they
land next season--though Dickau doesn't want to get too far ahead of
himself.</TE>
<TE>   At 6 feet, his height is a bit of a question, along with his
ability to play defense. But there is plenty for NBA scouts to like.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll be drafted," one NBA executive said. "If it were only
seniors, he'd be a first-round pick, but you have to wait to see who
comes out early and who comes out of high school.</TE>
<TE>   "But he knows how to play. He makes big shots, and he's skilled
enough."</TE>
<TE>   Then, of course, there are those Stockton seminars.</TE>
<TE>   "He's such a good college player, and those type of guys usually
get a chance at the next level," Stockton said.</TE>
<TE>   "From there, it's up to him. All you can ask for is the
opportunity, and it looks like he's going to get that."</TE>
<TE>   What next season or even this month's NCAA tournament holds is
anyone's guess. But everything seems to go Dickau's way, right down
to his much-discussed hairstyle.</TE>
<TE>   He has the sort of locks people would pay a lot of money for in
L.A.--a hard-to-get, just-woke-up Hollywood look--and Dickau gets it
by ... just waking up.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wash my hair every morning, and some days I dry it with a
towel, some days I don't," he said. "Usually it falls however it
falls."</TE>
<TE>   Like his shots, it's usually just right.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Adams Says L.A. Smeared Him</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Former Dodger pitcher Terry Adams, who signed an incentive-laden deal
with Philadelphia this winter, claimed the Dodgers depressed his
market value by spreading rumors that his elbow wasn't sound.</LD>
<LD>   When a string of injuries ravaged the Dodger rotation last season,
Adams stepped in from the bullpen and went 10-6 with a 4.16
earned-run average in 22 starts, helping the team remain in
contention. But the Dodgers didn't make a contract offer to Adams
after the season.</LD>
<LD>   "It really was troublesome to meIt affected my free-agent year.
When the Dodgers didn't offer me a contract, it made other teams
think there was something wrong with me," Adams told the Philadelphia
Inquirer.</LD>
<TE>   Dodger General Manager Dan Evans said no team personnel made
derogatory comments about Adams, and any questions about his health
were referred to his agent. The decision not to offer Adams
arbitration, Evans said, was based on other moves the Dodgers made
and anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   "We made the trade for [Omar] Daal, we thought we could sign
[Hideo] Nomo and we did a few days later, and we knew [Kazuhisa]
Ishii would be available," Evans said. "We liked them better than
Adams, and we didn't feel arbitration was a good risk at the time.
Terry pitched well for us, and we wish him the best."</TE>
<TE>   Adams said he received initial offers from Boston, Atlanta and
Texas and claimed he was close to a four-year, $28-million deal with
the Red Sox until they backed off for medical reasons. He signed a
one-year, $2.7-million deal with the Phillies that includes two
option years and could grow to $19.5 million with incentives.</TE>
<TE>   Adams claimed the Dodgers made their decision not to offer him a
contract after examining him for only 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "If I went in and they had done a series of tests, I could have
accepted that," Adams said. "I think they made a decision based on
the fact that the team signed [Andy] Ashby and [Darren] Dreifort to
long-term deals last year and they got hurt."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy said it's "unfair to over-evaluate someone this
early in spring," and that had to provide some relief for Daal, who
was ripped for five runs on nine hits in 12/3 innings of the Dodgers'
6-2 exhibition loss to Houston on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Daal, who is guaranteed $5 million, is battling Eric Gagne and
Odalis Perez for the fifth rotation spot, but listening to him, you'd
hardly think there was any competition.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel I have to prove anything to anybody," said Daal, who
went 13-7 with a 4.46 ERA for the Phillies last season. "Everyone
knows what I can do."</TE>
<TE>   Daal's first pitch of the game Friday was lofted over the
left-field wall by Astro second baseman Jose Vizcaino. The former
Dodger also had a two-run double.</TE>
<TE>   "I was overthrowing, and that's why the ball was up all the time,
but my arm felt great," Daal said. "I don't care if there are seven
pitchers for five spots. If I do my job, I'm going to be there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Brown, recovering from elbow surgery, had a strong 60-pitch
bullpen workout. He's probably a week away from appearing in an
exhibition game.... The Dodgers had only four hits Friday, including
a solo home run by Adrian Beltre against Houston closer Billy Wagner.</TE>

<KH>DUCK NOTES</KH>
<HD>McInnis Finds Going Rough</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The word frustrated doesn't begin to describe Mighty Duck left wing
Marty McInnis' feelings.</LD>
<LD>   He has two goals in his last 30 games. He has none in his last 13
games. With nine goals this season, he is averaging about three every
20 games.</LD>
<LD>   "It's beyond frustrating," McInnis said. "You go through cycles
where it's unbearable.</LD>
<TE>   "I've tried everything. I've tried new sticks. When things aren't
going the way you want, you go back to keeping the game simple, play
the game rather than sit there analyzing. Obviously I can play."</TE>
<TE>   Duck management thought so too; it gave McInnis a three-year,
$5-million contract extension a year ago. A fair price for a guy who
scored at least 18 goals in four of the last five seasons--he scored
10 in the 1999-2000 season when he was slowed by a groin injury that
required off-season surgery.</TE>
<TE>   But McInnis' drought has reached the point where Coach Bryan
Murray would like to see him change tactics.</TE>
<TE>   "When you shoot from the angles in this league and don't get to
the front of the net, it's a hard game to score goals," Murray said.
"It seems to me that he needs to make more of an effort to get
himself in scoring position. It means taking a little abuse more
often, and not being satisfied to shoot from the perimeter as often."</TE>
<TE>   McInnis has always been streaky, scoring goals in bunches. But
there has been only one streak this season. He had two goals in the
first 22 games, then five in the next seven. Then the bottom fell
out.</TE>
<TE>   He has had some tough luck, hitting posts and having good
opportunities turned away by goalies.</TE>
<TE>   "What happens so often is guys go through cycles where nothing
goes in," Murray said. "Marty, to me, has always been a guy who
should get 15-20 goals a year for you."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' practice Friday included a colorful tongue-lashing from
Murray and assistant coach Guy Charron, both of whom were unhappy
about the effort during drills.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think that in a couple of drills we should have worked
harder," Murray said. "Half of them are going like hell, as they
normally do, but we had a few guys who just didn't work as hard as
they should have. There are times when you have to send a message."</TE>
<TE>   The message being that there are 20 games left, even if the Ducks
are out of the playoff race.</TE>
<TE>   "I want these guys to play through until the 82nd game of the
year," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right wing Jeff Friesen returned to practice Friday after missing
Thursday to rest a sore left ankle.... Center Andy McDonald, who
suffered a concussion against Minnesota on Wednesday, probably will
not play Sunday against Chicago.... Marc Chouinard, who injured a
shoulder Wednesday, will not make the trip.</TE>

<HD>Els (67) Up by Two as Doral Gets Scary</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even with 25-mph gusts making Doral's Blue Monster play two strokes
harder, the Big Easy made it look like a breeze Friday in the Genuity
Championship.</LD>
<LD>   Ernie Els saved par from thick rough behind the 18th green to
polish off a five-under-par 67 and take a two-stroke lead over Briny
Baird going into the weekend at Miami, with Tiger Woods lurking four
strokes back and in serious contention for the first time this year.</LD>
<LD>   Els, at 11-under 133, is the only player in the field without a
bogey. Baird had a 66 and will be in the final group today in his
hometown.</LD>
<TE>   Woods was in the group at 137 after an adventurous two-under 70,
the first time he has broken par in the second round this year.</TE>
<TE>   Others were not so lucky:</TE>
<TE>   * Chris DiMarco, the first-round leader at 65, shot a 79 and
narrowly made it to the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   * Davis Love III took a quintuple-bogey 9 on the par-four third
hole. He missed the cut, shooting a 77 for a 147 total.</TE>
<TE>   * British Open champion David Duval made only three pars in his
first 10 holes, had a 73 and missed the cut for the first time since
last year at Pebble Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Ty Tryon kept his streak going. The 17-year-old has yet to break

defending champion Lorie Kane during the second round of the

<TE>   Fujii, one of two Japanese tour players who received sponsor

<HD>Olympics Take Toll on Miller</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Helping the United States win a silver medal in the Olympics seems
not to have slowed King winger Adam Deadmarsh, who has five points in
two games since returning from Salt Lake City, but it apparently wore
out defenseman Aaron Miller.</LD>
<LD>   "Part mental, part physical," interim Coach Dave Tippett said of
his reasons for giving Miller a day off from practice Friday as the
Kings prepared for today's game against the Columbus Blue Jackets.
"It's a tough couple weeks. I think he played a lot more minutes [at
the Olympics] than Deader.</LD>
<LD>   "The two games [since the Olympics], he would probably admit,
weren't his two best games. So, he's just getting a mental and
physical break."</LD>
<TE>   Deadmarsh, meanwhile, seems energized by his Olympic experience.
His post-Olympic play continued a February hot streak in which he
racked up five goals and seven assists in seven games, tied for the
team points lead for the month with Jason Allison and one more than
Ziggy Palffy, his new linemates.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's been great," Tippett said of Deadmarsh's energetic
play. "He went through a little bit of a flat spell [in January], but
maybe two weeks before the break he was really chasing down loose
pucks. He's just been relentless.</TE>
<TE>   "On power plays, you're always looking for second chances, and
he's given us a lot of second chances. It's a credit to him to go
through the whole Olympic thing and then, in these two games, he was
full of energy, full of life."</TE>
<TE>   Deadmarsh, who had two goals and an assist in Tuesday night's 5-1
victory at Columbus, has nine points in three games against the Blue
Jackets.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to dwell on it too much," he said of his success
against the second-year expansion team. "I've just been kind of lucky
a few games."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net originally planned to televise today's game but
dropped it from the schedule because ABC owns exclusive rights to the
time slot. ABC, meanwhile, dropped its plan to televise the Kings'
game against the Pittsburgh Penguins on March 16 at Staples Center
even before Thursday's announcement that Mario Lemieux probably will
not play again this season.</TE>

<HD>Hearn Hopes to Be Back in a Few Weeks</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Laker announcer Chick Hearn, recovering from hip surgery, is ahead of
schedule in his rehabilitation and hopes to be back on the air in a
few weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "I may do only home games until the start of the playoffs," said
Hearn, speaking from his hospital bed at Valley Presbyterian Hospital
in Van Nuys. "But once the playoffs begin, I will do all the games,
home and away.</LD>
<LD>   "Tell everyone I am in good spirits."</LD>
<TE>   Marge Hearn said her husband has undertaken a vigorous program
with the hope of making it back to complete his 41st season as the
team's announcer.</TE>
<TE>   "He is working so hard," she said. "He is determined to do this."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn, whose streak of 3,338 consecutive games behind the Laker
microphone was broken earlier this season when he had open-heart
surgery, underwent a second operation Feb. 19 after falling and
breaking his hip.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Friday was the deadline for adding a player who would be eligible
for the playoffs, but it passed without the Lakers flinching.</TE>
<TE>   Although 6-foot-10, 270-pound center Ike Austin, among others, was
put on waivers, Laker General Manager Mitch Kupchak says he is
content to head into the postseason with the roster he has.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, you have to watch the waiver wire," Kupchak said, "but
we like this group of players. We feel this group has earned the
right to defend its title.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had some ups and downs this season, but the major reason is
that Shaq [O'Neal] has been injured."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If there is a Laker concern, it's depth in the rebounding
department because of the absence of Samaki Walker. The power forward
has sat out the last six games because of a hyperextended right
elbow.</TE>
<TE>   "If he was going to be out several months," Kupchak said, "then
maybe we would have thought about doing something."</TE>
<TE>   Walker is hoping to be back for Tuesday's game against the New
Jersey Nets at Staples Center, but he acknowledges there is still
swelling and pain in the elbow.</TE>
<TE>   "It's excruciating pain," Walker said. "I'd like to be back, but I
won't predict anything."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson refuses to place the blame for the lapse in
rebounding on the loss of Walker.</TE>
<TE>   "We just have to rebound as a team," Jackson said. "It's not just
one individual."</TE>
<TE>   Walker was averaging 7.0 rebounds, slightly fewer than the
combined efforts of Robert Horry (5.5) and Slava Medvedenko (2.3).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After playing six of their last seven on the road, the Lakers will
play five of six at home, the exception being Wednesday's game in
Salt Lake City.</TE>

<LD>If Randy Harvey [Feb. 25] can't think of any Ugly American Awards, I
sure can. Here it goes:</LD>
<LD>   Ugly American Award: American Media</LD>
<LD>   1. For coming to the rescue of Canadian pairs figure skaters and
turning on them as soon as they were awarded the gold (proving that
there must be something or someone to hate at all times in America).</LD>
<TE>   2. For heavily favoring the Canadian men's hockey team before the
competition and all but considering it eliminated from the tournament
after a first game and a meaningless loss to Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   3. For all but ignoring the Croatian skier's unprecedented four
gold medals. What was her name again?</TE>
<TE>   4. For scoffing at, but then embracing, and then scoffing at
again, the Olympic sport of curling, which in my humble opinion
requires much more talent than jumping on a skeleton sled and sliding
down a hill ... but America got a gold, right?</TE>
<TE>   5. For being stupid enough to print a column that claims that
Wayne Gretzky blamed the media for Canada's hockey problems. What
color medal did they win? Or should I spell it colour? Then Mr.
Harvey can claim that I can't spell.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Sorenson</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'd like to know what variety of "American propaganda" is helping
Wayne Gretzky build his huge home here in Southern California? Seems
he should think twice before opening his mouth and vilifying the
United States when it's obvious he and his family are fully enjoying
the American Dream.</TE>
<TE>   Trish Castro</TE>
<TE>   Montebello</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Randy Harvey was duped by George Steinbrenner. Even Homer Simpson
could have made George's suggestion to "spend more for more medals."
The U.S. is now the East Germany of the 21st century--outspending
everyone and winning is everything. Just like George's Yankees,
cost-effectiveness would put the U.S. at the bottom. It is nothing to
be proud of.</TE>
<TE>   Don Gustav</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Palisades</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Simply put, these were the most corrupt and political Olympic
Games ever. From the way they were awarded to Salt Lake City, to the
judges' controversy in skating.</TE>
<TE>   From the too many athletes caught using banned substances, to the
ridiculous NBC coverage.</TE>
<TE>   When I was a kid, the Games were a moment to rejoice, a true
testimonial of honesty, joy and pure athleticism. Everybody in front
of the TV witnessing the greatness of famous and unknown athletes. A
milestone in everybody's life.</TE>
<TE>   All that is left is an endless soap opera of delayed tapes and
corrupt officials.</TE>
<TE>   Manu Appelius</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Matt Stein [Viewpoint, Feb. 23] cruelly and unfairly labeled
Michelle Kwan as the Greatest Choker in Sports.</TE>
<TE>   As many do, he measures success by the color of a medal. He's dead
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The Olympic gods have denied a gold medal to Kwan for whatever
reason, but they gave her a heart of gold along with her silver and
bronze medals.</TE>
<TE>   Sid Gruber</TE>
<TE>   North Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Kwan: the Chris Evert of figure skating. Beauty, skill
and, above all, total class.</TE>
<TE>   Robert M. Imm</TE>
<TE>   Sunland</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After Michelle Kwan got knocked down to a silver medal by a Tara
in 1998 and to a bronze this year by a Sarah, if a Farrah competes in
the 2006 Olympic trials, Michelle should withdraw.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Epstein</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Is Sarah Hughes just another over-hyped athletic spoiled brat? It
appears so. Apparently, Ms. Hughes was too sick with flu to take part
in the closing ceremony. Maybe it was just a case of Ms. Hughes
forgetting to eat her Wheaties on Sunday. Because she certainly had
no problem Monday, posing and smiling as she unveiled her likeness on
a box of the breakfast of champions.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Balazs</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I see where Bill Plaschke continues his drive to be the new Jim
Murray. The style is clear: Alternating touching human interest
stories with "hit pieces," the formula is bound to result in the
coronation of a new reigning columnist.</TE>
<TE>   The difference, however, is that Plaschke's attacks come across as
mean-spirited and devoid of humor. The recent Apolo Anton Ohno slam
is a perfect example. As I read the column, all I could wonder to
myself is, what is the motivation behind this? Was he rejected for an
interview or a pro-am golf pairing?</TE>
<TE>   Slamming Ohno's sport of short-track skating is also unfair. It is
a wacky event, to be sure. However, it requires athleticism, skill
and determination to excel. Compare this with the non-sport of
curling--overweight people moving stones with brooms. Curling, Mr.
Plaschke, was the Murray slant. Poke fun at the humor of this entry
in Winter Olympics, or how snowboarding is now a world-class Olympic
event. Meanwhile, Ohno handled the disappointments of his
unpredictable yet athletic sport with grace and class rarely seen by
professional athletes of the "We Wuz Robbed" mentality.</TE>
<TE>   The only conclusion I could come up with was that the columnist
was envious of the young athlete's looks and marquee quality name. A
solution: Run the next Murraylike attempt with header: Soul Plaschke.</TE>

<TE>   Wait a minute. Am I missing something? How many members of the
U.S. Olympic hockey team were born in the U.S.? I'd guess none of
them. In 1980, before the professionals took over, they were all
Americans. Isn't what we had on Sunday really a glorified NHL
All-Star game? Please enlighten me on this!</TE>

<LD>Which team would you rather back?</LD>
<LD>   Question 1: A team that goes 24-3, wins the Pac-10, wins a lot of
games handily, and makes the Sweet 16, or, an underachieving team
that goes 17-10, finishes in the middle of the Pac-10 and gets to the
Sweet 16? Coach Steve Lavin would say that each team has achieved
equal success.</LD>
<LD>   Question 2: A team that goes 24-3, is the Pac-10 champion, is
ranked in the top five all season, but loses in the first round of
the NCAA tournament, or, the 17-10 team that finishes in the middle
of the Pac-10, loses to mediocre teams, and barely beats others by
one or two points, and makes the Sweet 16? Lavin would say the latter
has had a more successful season and should blow its horn.</LD>
<TE>   Question 3: Name the Sweet 16 last year (or any year).</TE>
<TE>   Which team has had a better season and gives its supporters more
to enjoy? How do you think Lavin justifies keeping his job?</TE>
<TE>   Douglas L. Walton</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Last time I looked, a coach was generally evaluated by his
won-lost record. Except in this town. Steve Lavin is rolling to his
sixth 20-win, NCAA tournament season in six years. The Bruins have
defeated Kansas, Alabama, Stanford, USC and Arizona. His reward?
Almost a weekly litany of abuse, including your staff (Diane Pucin
with her so caring concern for UCLA fans) and the usual Saturday
letter jerks. Do you ever hear Bibby being blasted after getting
trounced at Arizona or California? Montgomery after being swept at
home? Matt Doherty at North Carolina?</TE>
<TE>   I said it last year and I say it again now that we have beaten
Stanford three years in a row on their court: Stay off his back and
let Coach Lavin coach.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Epstein</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As longtime UCLA football and basketball fans, we applauded Peter
Dalis' decision to reject the invitation to the Humanitarian Bowl as
being beneath our dignity. We urge him to take the same high road
when the NIT bid that Steve Lavin's coaching has earned arrives on
his desk.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Rubin</TE>
<TE>   and Terrence Scott</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I have been a Bruin fan for nearly 50 years. Needless to say,
during that time, I have experienced many emotional ups and downs.
I've learned patience and tolerance. Rarely, if ever, have I
criticized my beloved Bruins. One thing has remained consistent
during those years: I have faithfully supported the players and
coaches simply because they are Bruins--but I just can't take it any
longer.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Lavin's lack of basic of coaching skills is truly alarming.
While coaches of opposing teams draw up plays on their chalkboards
and execute timely substitutions and timeouts, Mr. Sweet 16 can only

<TE>   The UCLA Bruins seem to think that wearing matching headbands is
the equivalent of team unity. Sadly, with Steve Lavin at the helm,
one could expect no more from these undercoached, underperforming
Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   It boggles the mind that any player would want to play under
Lavin. An incoming freshman is guaranteed that he will graduate with
less talent than he had his freshman year.</TE>
<TE>   It's time for Lavin to hang up his hair gel and fade quietly into
the sunset.</TE>

<TE>   Definition of natural progression? Pepperdine's basketball coach
moves to UCLA (a la Jim Harrick). Wouldn't that be an interesting
cross-town scenario:</TE>
<TE>   Henry Bibby, UCLA All-American, coaching at USC. Paul Westphal,
USC All-American, coaching at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Diane Kieffer</TE>
<TE>   Malibu</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Clearly it's time to finally and seriously consider a coaching
change when a program's season has been a model of inconsistency that
has subjected its fans to a three-month, full-tilt mood swing. With
big wins against top-ranked opponents and even bigger losses--the
30-point blowout loss to Oregon and the embarrassing loss to
conference weakling Arizona State--can change at the top possibly
come soon enough? I just hope Lute Olson doesn't have too much
trouble finding another gig.</TE>

<LD>Those poor, pampered millionaires of the PGA. As if winning a major
championship is justification for initiating a new tour so that the
rich can become even more pathetically rich. Many of these guys,
after winning a major, have rarely, if ever, won another tournament.
And they should be given a separate tour?</LD>
<LD>   To lament the fact that many of the former major winners, because
of eroding skills, infirmity, old age or all three, aren't in the
hunt come Sunday afternoon is akin to bemoaning the fact that Seattle
Slew is a step closer to the glue factory than the Kentucky Derby;
that Carl Yastrzemski is better suited to painting the Green Monster
than defending it; that Kareem has a better chance of success in the
Sky Bar than with the sky hook.</LD>

<TE>   Regarding Colin Montgomerie and the "heckling" he put up with at
La Costa:</TE>
<TE>   As a member of the group that followed Scott McCarron ("the ones
in T-shirts, shorts, cap backward and a beer in their hand"), please
let me correct Montgomerie that most of us actually had two beers in
our hands. We were there to root for Scott, not against Monty. One of
us inadvertently cheered when Montgomerie missed a putt on 12, but it
was quickly cut off.</TE>
<TE>   So, if Monty wants to use fan heckling as an excuse for his
continued poor play on this side of the pond, and therefore not play
in the States anymore, don't let the Concorde door hit you on your
... flight back.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>* Start: 8:45 a.m. on Grand Avenue near Second Street. Wheelchair
race starts at 8:20.</LD>
<LD>   * The runners: An estimated 23,000 will start the race, including
about 40 elite male and female competitors.</LD>
<LD>   * The rollers: Saul Mendoza of Wimberly, Texas, is going for his
sixth consecutive victory in the men's wheelchair division. Ariadne
Hernandez of Mexico is favored to win her second consecutive women's
title.</LD>
<TE>   * The finish: On Hope Street, north of Olympic Boulevard. The
winner of the men's race will cross the finish line about 10:55 a.m.,
with the first woman expected to finish 20-25 minutes later. Runners
averaging 10 minutes per mile will finish about 1:10 p.m. Anyone
averaging more than 12:30 per mile will have to run on the sidewalks
and obey regular traffic laws because streets will be reopened.</TE>
<TE>   * The view: Spectators can watch the race from the sidewalk nearly
anywhere along the course.</TE>
<TE>   * The tube: 8:30-11:30 a.m., Channel 9.</TE>
<TE>   * The favorites: Defending champion Stephen Ndungu and 2000 winner
Benson Mbithi are expected to be among the leaders in the men's race,
which includes fellow Kenyan Ronald Mogaka. Lucia Subano of Kenya,
Aurica Buia of Romania and Lyubov Denisova of Russia are leading
entries in the women's race.</TE>
<TE>   * The longshots: Sylmar native Peter De La Cerda, who finished a
surprising second in the 2000 U.S. Olympic marathon trials, will try
to become the first American to finish among the top five in the
men's race since 1995. Luminita Talpos of Romania, ninth in the 1999
world half-marathon championships, will make her marathon debut.</TE>
<TE>   * The spoils: The first-place finishers in the men's and women's
division will receive $25,000 and a 2002 Honda Accord V-6 valued at
$25,300.TR</TE>
<TE>   * Last year: Ndungu took the lead after 18 miles and clocked 2
hours 13 minutes 13 seconds to win the men's race by two minutes.
Elana Paramonova of Russia won the women's race in 2:36:58 after
passing Nuta Olaru of Romania with 11/2 miles left.</TE>
<TE>   * History lesson: Paul Pilkington and Olga Appell are the last
Americans to win the men's and women's titles with their victories in
1994. Pilkington was the designated pacesetter that year, but decided
to finish the race when he had a two-minute lead on the rest of the
field with 10 miles left. His 2:12:13 clocking gave him a 39-second
margin of victory over Luca Barzaghi of Italy. Appell won the women's
race in a career-best 2:28:12 nine days after becoming a U.S.
citizen.</TE>
<TE>   Fast facts: Simon Bor of Kenya averaged 4:56 per mile when he set
a course record of 2:09:25 in the 1999 marathon. Madina Biktagirova
of the Commonwealth of Independent States averaged 5:35 when she set
the women's course record of 2:26:23 in 1992.</TE>

<LD>The Toronto Raptors hope they can turn their season around the way
the Portland Trail Blazers have.</LD>
<LD>   Rasheed Wallace scored 20 points Friday night as the Trail Blazers
extended their winning streak to eight with a 91-81 victory at
Toronto, the Raptors' 10th consecutive loss.</LD>
<LD>   Damon Stoudamire had 19 points, and Dale Davis had 16 rebounds and
13 points for the Trail Blazers, who have won five consecutive road
games and 21 of 27 overall.</LD>
<TE>   Portland was 13-18 when Toronto handed the Trail Blazers their
season-high sixth consecutive loss on Jan. 2.</TE>
<TE>   "[Toronto] Coach [Lenny] Wilkens had an interesting point after
the game. He said, 'Just as easily as we got into this, we can get
out of this,'" Toronto's Morris Peterson said.</TE>
<TE>   Vince Carter, playing his third game since coming off the injured
list, scored 25 points for the Raptors, who are on their longest
losing streak in four years. They dropped 13 in a row from March 20
to April 12, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 110, New Jersey 102--Allen Iverson, who did not start
as punishment for being late to the morning shootaround, shook off a
leg injury to score 43 points at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry Kittles scored 16 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter to
pace the Eastern Conference-leading Nets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 100, Boston 87--Jamal Mashburn had 20 points and nine
rebounds, and Baron Davis had 19 points and eight assists as the
Hornets scored the first 10 points of the game at Boston and coasted
to victory.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Pierce scored 20 points, and Antoine Walker had 16 points and
nine rebounds for Boston, which has lost four consecutive since
trading Joe Johnson, Milt Palacio and next year's first-round pick to
Phoenix for Tony Delk and Rodney Rogers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York 89, Seattle 87--Howard Eisley, promoted from
third-stringer to backup, led the Knicks to their first victory since
Feb. 13.</TE>
<TE>   Eisley had 14 points and eight assists and played the final 14
minutes at New York as the Knicks ended a six-game losing streak and
ended Seattle's road winning streak at eight games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 110, Orlando 102--Cliff Robinson scored 24 points, and
Jerry Stackhouse returned to the lineup to score 23 as the Pistons
won at Auburn Hills, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Stackhouse had been expected to sit out his second consecutive
game because of a strained shoulder, but he decided he could play
after participating in pregame warmups.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 85, Minnesota 77--Tim Duncan had 25 points and 11
rebounds, and David Robinson had 18 points as the Spurs held off the
Timberwolves at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing 78-75 late in the fourth quarter, the Timberwolves had
several chances down the stretch to score but couldn't crack the Spur
defense and were forced into hurried shots with the shot clock
winding down.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Denver 96, Memphis 83--Juwan Howard had 24 points and nine
rebounds, and Tim Hardaway scored 17 of his season-high 22 points in
the third quarter at Denver as the Nuggets ended a six-game losing
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio McDyess, who missed the first 54 games of the season after
having surgery on his left knee, returned to the lineup for the
Nuggets. He had seven points and three rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 90, Washington 81--Travis Best made consecutive long
jumpers with less than two minutes left and Jalen Rose made four free
throws down the stretch as the Bulls won at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   With Michael Jordan in Washington recuperating from knee surgery,
the Wizards lost their seventh consecutive despite a strong effort
from Richard Hamilton. He scored 30 points after making a gametime
decision to play despite flulike symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 116, Golden State 109--Chris Webber celebrated his 29th
birthday with 32 points, nine rebounds and eight assists and Peja
Stojakovic scored 26 as the Kings improved to 13-13 on the road with
a victory at Oakland. The Warriors have lost 23 of 27.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Grand American series driver Jeff Clinton was killed during practice
Friday when his open-wheel, open-cockpit race car veered off course,
flipped repeatedly and landed upside down.</LD>
<LD>   The 38-year-old St. Louis driver died at the scene, officials at
Homestead-Miami Speedway in Florida said.</LD>
<LD>   Clinton, who was practicing for today's Nextel 250 race, lost
control of the car and crashed heading into Turn 1. Grand American
and Miami-Dade County officials will investigate the accident.</LD>
<TE>   Team officials refused to say whether Clinton was wearing a
head-and-neck restraint.</TE>
<TE>   Track officials canceled qualifying Friday and set the starting
grid for the race according to series standings.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton was in his second season--his first full one--for
Archangel Motorsport Services. Team owner Mike Johnson withdrew his
second entry from today's race.</TE>
<TE>   The accident delayed Indy Racing League qualifying for nearly
three hours before Sam Hornish won the pole for the IRL season opener
today. The Grand Am cars returned to the track a short time later for
a final practice session.</TE>
<TE>   Driving a Haas-Carter Racing Ford without a sponsor, Todd Bodine
made the most of a bad situation by winning the pole for the
UAW-DaimlerChrysler 400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Bodine turned a lap of 172.850 mph, breaking the track qualifying
record of 172.563 set in 2000 by Ricky Rudd. That was also just good
enough--by 0.002 of a second--to keep rookie Ryan Newman  and his
172.839 lap off the pole.</TE>
<TE>   Rubens Barrichello upstaged Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher,
setting a track record in qualifying for the Australian Grand Prix at
Melbourne, the opening event of the Formula One season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Burton, making his first Busch Series start of the season,
drove to the pole position for today's Sam's Town 300 at Las Vegas
Motor Speedway. Burton's lap of 169.168 mph relegated Jimmy Spencer,
at 169.051, to the outside of the front row for 300-mile race.</TE>

<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Jennifer Capriati shook off a slow start and advanced
to the semifinals of the State Farm Classic by defeating sixth-seeded
Barbara Schett of Austria, 7-5, 6-3, at Scottsdale, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Serena Williams, seeded third, also moved to the semifinals by
defeating Nicole Pratt of Australia, 6-2, 7-5. She will play
second-seeded Martina Hingis of Switzerland, who defeated Daja
Bedanova of the Czech Republic, 6-4, 0-6, 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   Top-ranked Lleyton Hewitt fought off a late spurt by Todd Martin
for a 6-3, 7-5 victory in the quarterfinals of the Siebel Open at San
Jose. Hewitt will face fourth-seeded Jan-Michael Gambill, who ousted
Wayne Arthurs, 7-5, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (4). Gambill had 22 aces and was
never broken in the match.</TE>
<TE>   Second-seeded Andre Agassi easily defeated South African Wayne
Ferreira,  6-4, 6-4, and will play the winner of a late match between
Andy Roddick and Davis Cup teammate James Blake.</TE>
<TE>   Anna Kournikova of Russia was eliminated from the Abierto Mexicano
Pegaso tournament, losing to Katarina Srebotnik of Slovenia, 5-7,
6-3, 6-1, at Acapulco.</TE>
<TE>   Srebotnik will face Paola Suarez of Argentina in today's final.
Suarez, seeded seventh, handily defeated top-seeded Elena Dementieva
of Russia, 7-5, 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic upset second-seeded Yevgeny
Kafelnikov of Russia, 6-1, 6-1, in the quarterfinals of the Dubai
Open at the United Arab Emirates. No. 3 Thomas Johansson of Sweden
defeated Tim Henman of England, 6-4, 6-3, and will play Younes El
Aynaoui of Morocco, who defeated Rainer Schuettler of Germany, 6-7
(3), 6-4, 6-3.</TE>

<TE>   Track and Field</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Pate pulled off the fourth-best indoor long jump in history
to win the title at the USA Track &amp; Field Indoor Championships at New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Pate's leap of 28 feet, 21/4 inches was the longest indoors in the
world in three years, and the best by an American since Carl Lewis
set the world record of 28-101/4 in New York in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Powell set the outdoor mark of 29-41/2 in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Nelson won his second consecutive shotput national title with
a toss of 70-9 1/4.</TE>

<TE>   Canadian Eric Lucas successfully defended his World Boxing Council

fell to 49-10 and says he won't retire until he gets 50 victories.</TE>

<HD>Grbac's Stay in Baltimore Is Short One</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Elvis Grbac, signed a year ago to upgrade the Baltimore Raven
offense, was released by the team Friday as it continued its purge of
veterans.</LD>
<LD>   Grbac, who left the Kansas City Chiefs as a free agent last March
to sign a five-year, $30-million deal with the Ravens, decided to
leave the team rather than accept a restructured contract. He would
have received a $6-million bonus if he had been on Baltimore's roster
as of 1 p.m. Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "We're disappointed for us and for Elvis," Raven Coach Brian
Billick said. "We thought a new contract would not only give us
obvious help with our salary cap, but benefit Elvis too. We were
looking forward to facing the challenges of next season, when we
believed he would play at a higher level for us."</LD>
<TE>   The Ravens signed Grbac less than three months after defeating the
New York Giants in the 2001 Super Bowl. He was supposed to provide
more offensive punch that his predecessor, Trent Dilfer, but threw 18
interceptions and only 15 touchdown passes.</TE>
<TE>   Grbac's exit leaves Baltimore with two options at
quarterback--veteran Randall Cunningham, who turns 39 this month, and
Chris Redman, who has thrown three passes in two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Five-time all-pro linebacker Jessie Armstead, released by the New
York Giants a day earlier, agreed to a $4.5-million, three-year
contract with the Washington Redskins.</TE>
<TE>   The Redskins also reached agreement with former University of
Florida receiver Reidel Anthony on a one-year deal and worked to
complete a trade with Houston for former Gator quarterback Danny
Wuerffel.</TE>
<TE>   Agent Jason Rosenhaus confirmed the deals for Armstead and
Anthony. The Redskins announced that Armstead had agreed to terms. An
announcement on Anthony was expected later.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Antowain Smith, the running back who revived New England's rushing
game last season, signed a five-year contract to remain with the
Patriots. The Boston Globe's Web site, citing unidentified league
sources, reported the deal was for almost $21 million, with a signing
bonus of about $5 million.... Chicago Bear quarterback Jim Miller
agreed to a five-year contract. Financial terms of the deal were not
disclosed.... Quarterback Jeff Blake, sidelined by injury in 2000 and
replaced as a starter by Aaron Brooks in 2001, was released by the
New Orleans Saints.... The Dallas Cowboys re-signed safety Darren
Woodson to a five-year, $20-million year deal that should keep him
with his only NFL team for the rest of his career.... The Carolina
Panthers claimed running back Joe Montgomery off waivers from the New
York Giants. The Giants released the injury-prone Montgomery in a
salary-cap move earlier this week. The Panthers assume the final year
of Montgomery's contract worth the league minimum of $375,000.... The
Houston Texans claimed wide receiver Trevor Insley off waivers from
the Indianapolis Colts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 former Philadelphia Eagle cheerleaders will join a
lawsuit against 29 NFL teams, charging that visiting players peeped
on them in a Veterans Stadium locker room, their lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, filed in state court in Philadelphia, now has 44
plaintiffs but will be expanded for a second time next week, said
lawyer Michael J. McKenna of Cherry Hill, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   McKenna said that 117 women have contacted him, all but 10 of whom
have returned signed documents indicating they will participate in
the suit.</TE>

<LD>   City Championship</LD>
<LD>   Tonight at the Forum</LD>
<TE>   Fairfax (29-3) vs. Westchester (27-2), 7</TE>
<TE>   The league rivals have already played three times, Westchester
winning twice, including a surprisingly easy 100-68 victory on Jan.
8. But Fairfax won at Westchester, 66-62, on Jan. 25. Westchester,
seeking its third consecutive City Section championship, received
double-figure scoring from six players in an 83-63 semifinal victory
over Fremont. Arizona-bound guard Hassan Adams has had a superb
season and this week became the Comets' first McDonald's
All-American. Fairfax swingman Evan Burns, who has committed to UCLA,
scored 15 points in a 68-59 semifinal victory over Dorsey. Fairfax
has not won a City title since 1987. The game will be broadcast by
cable Channel 36 on a delayed basis, beginning at 9 p.m.</TE>

<TE>   Southern Section</TE>
<TE>   Today at Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim</TE>
<TE>   Division I-AA</TE>
<TE>   Rialto Eisenhower (27-2) vs.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Poly (27-3), 8:30</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Poly Coach Ron Palmer is concerned his second-seeded
Jackrabbits haven't played well in big games this season. Their
losses were to their toughest competition: Compton Centennial, St.
Louis Vashon and Eisenhower. Still, the meltdowns will be forgotten
if the Jackrabbits can defeat top-seeded Eisenhower. When the teams
met in December, Eisenhower posted a 14-point victory behind strong
efforts from Cory McJimson (28 points), Sean Marshall (20) and Johnny
Dukes (12). Poly's front line of Marcedes Lewis, Bobby Jones and
Reggie Butler must avoid foul trouble and dominate the interior if
the Jackrabbits, who are making their fifth appearance in the finals
in six years, are to win their first title since 2000. Eisenhower is
playing in its first championship game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Division I-A</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Loyola (26-3) vs. Thousand Oaks (27-3), 2:15</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-seeded Loyola and third-seeded Thousand Oaks reached the
championship game because of outstanding man-to-man defense. Each
applies steady pressure and features exceptional rebounders. The key
matchup is at center. Ben Olson of Thousand Oaks, a 6-foot-5 senior
who is averaging 14.5 points and seven rebounds, has used his
athleticism and mobility to create defensive mismatches. But Loyola
has a versatile 6-7 center in junior Chris Rucker, who runs the court
and blocks shots. Much focus will be on each team's top shooter.
Loyola has junior Omar Wilkes, who averages 20 points. Thousand Oaks
counters with senior Dave Anderson, who averages 17.3 points and is
shooting 62.5% from three-point range during the playoffs. Loyola's
only basketball title came in 1953.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Division II-AA</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Mater Dei (26-4) vs. Pasadena (26-4), 6:30</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Mater Dei has won 19 consecutive games, while
second-seeded Pasadena has won 18 in a row. The Monarchs, who are
seeking a fourth consecutive section title, are heavy favorites, but
the guard-oriented Bulldogs are scrappy enough to keep things
interesting. Guards Dino Wilburn and Duwan Rice are excellent
ballhandlers who often drive and pass to center Mackenzie Clark, who
neutralized Inglewood's DeAngelo Collins in Pasadena's semifinal
victory. The Bulldogs, seeking their first section title since 1995,
will need to contain Mater Dei guard Wesley Washington and curtail
the Monarchs' transition game to have a chance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Division II-A</TE>
<TE>   Riverside King (27-3) vs. Redondo Union (22-6), 12:30</TE>
<TE>   Third-seeded Redondo Union has won 16 of 17 games since Wendell
White and Eddie Topps returned from injuries. The Sea Hawks, who seek
a second consecutive section title, knocked off second-seeded Santa
Margarita in a semifinal and will need to play their best to beat the
top-seeded Wolves. King's Marvin Lea, one of the most dominating
players in the Southern Section, is capable of scoring 30 or more
points. Redondo's Keith Ellison is another hard-nosed player who gets
the job done.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Division III-AA</TE>
<TE>   La Puente Bishop Amat (24-6) vs.</TE>
<TE>   Palm Desert (25-4), 10:45 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-seeded Bishop Amat has reached the final in Coach Ray
Lokar's first season, while third-seeded Palm Desert is making its
first championship-game appearance in the school's 16-year history.
Bishop Amat possesses more size and depth, but Palm Desert features
excellent ball movement and defense. Loyola Marymount-bound forward
John Haywood averages 18 points and eight rebounds for the Lancers,
and Paul Porter averages 15 points. Palm Desert is led by seniors
Donald Brady, Chase McQuillen and Josh Zazulia, the school's all-time
leading scorer. Bishop Amat won its only finals appearance in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Division III-A</TE>
<TE>   Compton Centennial (28-0) vs.</TE>
<TE>   Torrance Bishop Montgomery (23-6), 9 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Montgomery defeated Centennial the last two seasons in the
section final and again in the state playoffs, but this time the
top-seeded and undefeated Apaches come in as slight favorites.
Centennial has three big-time players: Gabriel Pruitt, who is
averaging 20 points during the playoffs, 6-foot-7 Darius Sanders (17
points) and Sterling Byrd (16.7). Centennial Coach Rod Palmer said he
is concerned about stopping Bishop Montgomery's tandem of Fred
Washington (22.4) and Gavin Lee (15.1). While the Apaches squeaked
past their last two opponents, Bishop Montgomery won its last two
games by an average of 37 points.</TE>

<TE>   GIRLS' BASKETBALL FINALS</TE>
<TE>   City Championship</TE>
<TE>   Today at the Forum</TE>
<TE>   Harbor City Narbonne (24-3) vs. Chatsworth (22-7), 5</TE>
<TE>   Narbonne has cruised through the playoffs with victories of 43, 51
and 26 points. Chatsworth scrambled in victories over Crenshaw,
48-45, and Chatsworth, 47-44. If the third-seeded Chancellors can
keep the score close in the fourth quarter--and they will have to do
that by shooting a high percentage-- their recent victories might
prove to be an advantage. Top-seeded Narbonne may be too physical for
Chatsworth to get many second opportunities to score. The game will
be broadcast by cable Channel 36 on at 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Southern Section Finals</TE>
<TE>   Today at the Pyramid in Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   Division I-A</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente (26-3) vs. Newhall Hart (25-4), 8:15</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded San Clemente and third-seeded Hart each has a set of
fine guards, but there could be a matchup problem with San Clemente's
6-3 sophomore, Lindsey Pluimer, who is averaging 23.4 points and 11.8
rebounds. She has been too much for nearly all-comers, though she has
drawn additional coverage and more physical play lately. Hart is
making its first appearance in a title game since winning consecutive
championships in 1989-90. San Clemente, defending Division I-AA
champion, is in the finals for the fourth time in five years. Hart's
Ashlee Trebilcock averages 16.7 points, Brandi Kimble 14.5 and Amanda
Patton 14.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Division II-AA</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton Troy (27-2) vs. Ventura (27-2), 6:30</TE>
<TE>   This is top-seeded Troy's fourth title game in five years, and the
Warriors hope to beat the Channel League champions for the second
year in a row. Last year, Troy beat undefeated Ventura Buena. Each
team features competent three-point shooters, Troy's Alicia Komaki
and Meghan McGuire and second-seeded Ventura's Jenni Dooley and Katy
O'Brien. But in an arena setting, inside play could prove pivotal,
and the advantage could be swung by Troy's Amanda Livingston, who
averages 19.3 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Division III-AA</TE>
<TE>   Lakewood Artesia (23-5) vs. Apple Valley (24-4), 2:45</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Artesia won its other championship game appearances, in
1983 and last season, when it defeated Pasadena Muir, 76-47, for the
Division II-A title. Katie McElree averages 21.9 points for Apple
Valley, which has never played in a championship game. Though the Sun
Devils are taller at the guard position and boast senior Katie
McElree, who averages 21.9 points, Artesia will have an advantage in
quickness, and that's something that has given Apple Valley trouble.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Division IV-AA</TE>
<TE>   Playa del Rey St. Bernard (20-7) vs.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Fe Springs St. Paul (24-7), 1</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded and defending champion St. Bernard had little trouble
with St. Paul in Del Rey League play, winning, 58-30, on Jan. 10 and
62-44 on Jan. 31. Georgia-bound senior Alexis Kendricks leads a St.
Bernard team that has outscored four playoff opponents by an average
of 35 points and seeks its fifth section title in six seasons. St.
Paul, seeded ninth, upset third-seeded Cerritos Valley Christian,
55-51, in the quarterfinals and has set a school record for
victories.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Division IV-A</TE>
<TE>   Montebello Cantwell-Sacred Heart (22-5) vs.</TE>
<TE>   Van Nuys Montclair Prep (20-5), 11:15 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Third-seeded Montclair Prep is seeking its second consecutive
section championship after winning the Division V-AA title last
season. The Mounties are paced by junior Eshaya Murphy, the
Southland's leading scorer and rebounder. Murphy, averaging 31.9
points and 22 rebounds, scored three points in the final 31 seconds
of the 55-52 semifinal victory over Huntington Beach Brethren
Christian. Cantwell-Sacred Heart's Kathy Suria, who averaged 14.5
points during the regular season, is averaging 21 in the playoffs,
including 30 in a 72-57 upset of top-seeded Brentwood in the second
round.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Division V-AA</TE>
<TE>   Rolling Hills Prep (21-6) vs.</TE>
<TE>   Granada Hills Hillcrest Christian (16-9), 9:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Charmaine Jones is averaging 26 points in three playoff games for
top-seeded Rolling Hills Prep. Third-seeded Hillcrest Christian,
making its first appearance in a final, is led by Kayla Rutherford,
who is averaging more than 20 points in the playoffs.</TE>

<DH>Time Has Come for This Laker Hit Parade to Stop</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal came to Staples Center on Friday night with a smile
on his face. He seemed more eager to give Brad Miller a big hug then
a big punch. When Miller was spelled by Jeff Foster, O'Neal put his
head on Foster's shoulder and left it there until Foster had to
giggle. O'Neal smiled.</LD>
<LD>   For all the knucklehead Laker fans who wanted O'Neal to retaliate
with escalating violence, please!</LD>
<LD>   For those who thought O'Neal should have hit Miller harder on Jan.
12 when Miller was playing for the Chicago Bulls and using
extracurricular force to impose some sort of control over O'Neal,
which caused O'Neal to throw an extracurricular punch at the back of
Miller's head ... please!</LD>
<TE>   Violence is not the answer.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe, are you listening?</TE>
<TE>   Such a lack of discipline Bryant showed.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers beat the Pacers, 96-84, in the big Shaq-Brad Miller
rematch. And now we'll be waiting for the Kobe-Reggie Miller rematch.
The game was over, the players were walking off the court. Except
that Bryant and Miller had a problem with each other. And Bryant
threw a punch. And everybody came out throwing punches. Jerseys were
torn. Bad words were exchanged. Bryant will probably be serving a
suspension.</TE>
<TE>   Over what? Bryant's team had won. Whatever else had happened,
Bryant is on the championship team. Miller had a bad game, a bad
night and Bryant should have walked off the court without a backward
glance.</TE>
<TE>   Have the Lakers learned nothing from Shaq's attack on Brad Miller
last month?</TE>
<TE>   Shaq seems to have learned. Shaq played with verve, not anger,
Friday night. Shaq played to have fun and not fisticuffs.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Miller may have had blood dripping from his mouth late in the
second quarter. Ball boys may have had to mop up the lane and Miller
may have had to hold a towel to his mouth while arguing with a
heckler. And O'Neal had one of those "Who, me?" make-believe innocent
looks on his face as he shot two free throws. Miller got the foul,
O'Neal got in the free shot even if the free throw didn't score a
direct hit. That's revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Violence is not the answer.</TE>
<TE>   Going to O'Neal seven of the first eight times the Lakers had the
ball, that was the answer.</TE>
<TE>   This game between the Lakers and the Pacers, Brad Miller's new
team, started like this:</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal hook shot over Brad Miller; O'Neal layup over Brad Miller
plus a free throw for a three-point play; O'Neal layup over Brad
Miller; O'Neal missing layup over Brad Miller but Robert Horry
scoring on the rebound, in effect an assist to O'Neal; O'Neal
rim-rattling slam over Brad Miller; Lindsey Hunter miss; O'Neal even
bigger slam over Brad Miller.</TE>
<TE>   No words necessary. No punches needed. Revenge exacted. Point
made. Kobe? Did you get the point?</TE>
<TE>   But maybe Kobe had gotten the wrong point last month when Laker
Coach Phil Jackson defended Shaq. Maybe Kobe got the wrong point when
all of Laker fandom seemed to feel Shaq had the right to knock heads
first, take names later.</TE>
<TE>   So Kobe threw the first punch against Reggie Miller, and will
Jackson be making excuses again? Excuses or not, another Laker star
will be missing a game or maybe more for taking violent action.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq had the right idea at the beginning of the evening. He
established that he was in no way bothered by playing against Brad
Miller now or ever again. If Bryant had a problem with Reggie Miller,
he could have addressed it with his basketball in another meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers don't need this distraction.</TE>
<TE>   Because there was a problem when the Lakers quit throwing it to
O'Neal on every possession. The Lakers went ahead, 15-2, when it was
all Shaq, all the time. When it wasn't all about Shaq, when it was
about Horry and Rick Fox and Derek Fisher and Slava Medvedenko and
Lindsey Hunter and sometimes even Bryant, the Pacers joined the game.
It got closer and closer.</TE>
<TE>   It became about Ron Artest and his springy legs and strong will,
and about another O'Neal, Jermaine, and his long arms, and about
Jamaal Tinsley and his fadeaway jump shot and good court sense.</TE>
<TE>   Since Shaq has come back from his toe-induced injury sabbatical,
there has been an intense joy in the way he has played.</TE>
<TE>   Did you see the sneaky, secret, one-handed pass Shaq made at the
perfect time while Devean George was in full stride, which George was
able to convert into a running layup? Smiles all around for that, and
on the next play, O'Neal brought the ball up court, a Harlem
Globetrotter in the making with his easy, breezy dribbling style.</TE>
<TE>   Laughs all around.</TE>
<TE>   There was not so much laughter when Austin Croshere, once a
budding star and now a rather big disappointment for the Pacers,
dribbled through Mark Madsen as if Madsen were an apparition and
scored a dunk to tie the game.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacers were suddenly made a team of strangers when they made
the big trade Feb. 19 by shipping off Jalen Rose, Travis Best and
Norm Richardson for Artest, Miller, Ron Mercer and Kevin Ollie. Rose
and Best were integral Pacer parts. Yet the Pacer choreography was
much quicker, smoother and more entertaining than the mid-game
plodding of the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the sore toe, Shaq runs with a bounce. The other Lakers
seem to have heavy legs. A team having won two straight championships
can be expected to find a Friday night game in March something dull
and onerous, but soon it must be time for all the Lakers to discover
whatever motivation it was Shaq found during his injury timeout.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Kobe found his inner anger and that's not the right mood
as playoff time nears.</TE>
<TE>   Violence is not the answer.</TE>

<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>The International Olympic Committee scoffed at Austrian claims that
there were legitimate medical uses for the blood-transfusion
equipment found in a house used by the nation's cross-country skiers
at the Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   The Austrian ski federation said its athletes used the material
for ultraviolet radiation treatment of their blood, describing the
method as being "exclusively for disease prevention" and not doping.</LD>
<LD>   "First, it doesn't sound credible," IOC medical director Patrick
Schamasch said Friday. "Second, any kind of blood manipulation is
part of the doping definition. The Austrian position is not relevant
for me."</LD>
<TE>   World Anti-Doping Agency chairman Dick Pound said, "It sounds so
far-fetched that it has no credibility."</TE>
<TE>   The IOC began an investigation Thursday after cleaners found blood
transfusion bags, tubes and needles in a closet in Midway, Utah, near
the Nordic ski venue at Soldier Hollow. The house had been rented to
the Austrian team and was used by about 10 athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Austria won three Olympic medals in Nordic events. Christian
Hoffmann won silver and Mikhail Botvinov bronze in the 30-kilometer
race. Wolfgang Perner took the bronze in the 10-kilometer biathlon
sprint.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the IOC is investigating two more positive drug tests
from the Games.</TE>
<TE>   One case involves the steroid nandrolone, and the other involves
the stimulant methamphetamine, the IOC said Friday. It didn't
identify the athletes or sports involved.</TE>

<DL>EUGENE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>As they did in their two regular-season meetings, UCLA and California
struggled against themselves as much as each other for most of their
Pacific 10 Conference tournament first-round game Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Eventually someone had to win, and the Bruins outlasted the Bears
for the third time this season, 46-42, before 5,842 at McArthur
Court. Bruin reserve guard Gennifer Arranaga led all scorers with 17
points.</LD>
<LD>   The "reward" for UCLA (9-19) is a quarterfinal date with
regular-season conference champion and top-seeded Stanford today. In
their two meetings this season, the Cardinal outscored the Bruins by
a combined 49 points.</LD>
<TE>   The Bears, led by Ami Forney with 11 points, ended their season at
7-21.</TE>
<TE>   Neither team had so much as a lukewarm hand in the first half.
UCLA made only seven of 23 attempts (30.4%); California was equally
frosty, with eight baskets in 29 shots (27.6%). Despite missing their
first five shots, the Bruins worked their way to a 20-16 lead with
3:28 left in the half. But they did not score again and Cal rallied
for a 21-20 lead at the half.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins finally got untracked after halftime, ripping off a
19-4 run that put them in charge, 39-30, with 9:49 to play.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA still led, 43-34, with 4:14 to play, but another Bruin cold
spell kept Cal close. A 10-foot bank shot by Arranaga at the 9:49
mark was the last field goal the Bruins made. UCLA's final seven
points came at the foul line.</TE>
<TE>   Cal got as close as 43-42 with 34 seconds left. But Bruin forward
Whitney Jones made two free throws, and Cal guard Jackie Lord missed
a three-point shot that would have tied it with seven seconds to
play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oregon 85, Washington State 67--Oregon (16-12) got 16 points from
Edniesha Curry and advanced to meet Washington today. Washington
State (2-27) lost its final 24 games and is the first Pac-10 team to
go a full season without a conference win.</TE>

<HD>Lynwood Rises to Win Title</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>By the time they hit the floor Friday night, Long Beach Poly and
Lynwood were the only remaining undefeated teams in the Southern
Section. By the time they left, only Lynwood's record was
unblemished. Both rose to the occasion, but it was Lynwood that
walked away with a 53-50 victory before a near-capacity crowd at the
Long Beach Pyramid in the section's Division I-AA girls' basketball
championship game.</LD>
<LD>   With Janice Bright on the bench with an ankle injury for the last
6 minutes 55 seconds, Lynwood (29-0) made its 45-36 lead hold up, but
not without some anxious moments. Poly pulled to within 49-48 with
1:20 remaining on Daisy Benjamin's drive to the basket, and
Benjamin's putback with 2.9 seconds left made it 51-50.</LD>
<LD>   By the time Poly (32-1) fouled Lynwood's Sade Wiley-Gatewood,
there was only one-tenth of a second left, and Wiley-Gatewood made
both free throws for the final score.</LD>
<TE>   "They were more than we expected," said Gatewood, who scored 20
and played despite aggravating shin splints in the first quarter.
"Poly's a great team."</TE>
<TE>   Lynwood (29-0) came into the game ranked No. 1 by The Times and
No. 1 in the nation by some ranking organizations. Poly (32-1), No. 3
in The Times' last ranking of the regular season, is ranked as high
as No. 12 nationally.</TE>
<TE>   It is Lynwood's fourth section title and its second in a row after
winning the Division I-AAA title a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Torrance Bishop Montgomery 61, Pasadena Muir 54--Muir led by as
many as 12 in the first half and by seven, 50-43, with 5:10 left in
the game before Bishop Montgomery rallied behind Noelle Quinn to win
its second title in three years, taking the Division III-A
championship at the Pyramid.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn scored 25 points and had 12 rebounds, six assists and four
steals. She scored nine points in a 72-second span to give the
Knights a 56-54 lead with 2:07 remaining, and Bishop Montgomery made
five of six free throws to close the game.</TE>
<TE>   Muir's 6-5 center, Tye'sha Fluker, fouled out with seven seconds
left. She scored only two of her 23 points in the second half, making
her only field goal attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Redondo Union 42, North Torrance 30--The Sea Hawks rallied in the
second half of the Division II-A final at the Pyramid to beat their
Bay League rival in the lowest scoring girls' championship game since
1996.</TE>
<TE>   Redondo (23-7) led, 3-0, after one quarter and trailed, 9-8, at
halftime before outscoring North Torrance (24-7), 20-6, in the third
quarter. Ofa Tulikihihifo scored nine of her 12 points in the first
four minutes of the second half to help the third-seeded Sea Hawks to
their second title in three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Traci Elliot scored 14 points and Julia Pitts had 11 points and 12
rebounds for fourth-seeded North Torrance, which made only two of 28
shots through three quarters and lost in the final for the second
consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   The Saxons finished the game eight for 41 (19.5%) from the field.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Pilgrim 71, Hemet Baptist Christian 33--The top-seeded
Patriots took a 27-5 lead and cruised to their fourth consecutive
Division V-A championship and fifth title in the past six seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Amber Cunningham scored 19 points, Brittany James had 15 and
Sharae Benitez made eight of 10 free throws and finished with 11
points for Pilgrim (26-3).</TE>
<TE>   Jamie De Kiewiet scored 10 points and ReAnne Lappinga and Staci
Burger each added eight for second-seeded Baptist Christian (23-1),
which fell to the Patriots in the playoffs for the third consecutive
season.</TE>

<DL>STOCKTON</DL>
<LD>All eyes were on Darrel Vasquez of Bakersfield High Friday during the
state wrestling championships at University of the Pacific, and for
good reason. Vasquez, a senior wrestling at 125 pounds, is going for
his record fourth consecutive individual state title.</LD>
<LD>   Vasquez, who won at 119 pounds last year, 112 in 2000 and 103 in
1999, got his pursuit of history rolling in impressive fashion in the
opening rounds, winning with a pin and two technical falls as he
advanced to the semifinals today.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm feeling really good that I got through the first day,"
Vasquez said. "It's been a mental grind pretty much all year."</LD>
<TE>   Bakersfield leads the team standings with 109.5 points, a
commanding 48.5 points ahead of second-place Poway.</TE>
<TE>   Bakersfield, which had 10 wrestlers qualify for the state meet,
had eight advance to the semifinals and is almost assured of breaking
the state team record of 170 points, set last year by Santa Ana
Calvary Chapel.</TE>
<TE>   Two-time defending state champion Calvary Chapel, which had
171-pounder Joe Williams as its only wrestler to make the semifinals,
is in sixth place with 33.5 points, which leads Southern Section
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Covina Northview had James Clay advance to the 160-pound
semifinals and is in seventh place with 32 points. Kirk Davis (189
pounds) and Arturo Basulto (heavyweight) made the semifinals for
Arroyo Grande, which is in eighth place with 30 points. Jeremy
Mendoza (119) and Jeff Bristol (140) advanced for Temecula Valley,
which has 27 points and is 10th.</TE>
<TE>   The surprise of the tournament may have been K.C. Shaw, a
189-pounder from Rancho Cucamonga. Shaw, who finished fifth at the
Masters last week and is in his first year as a wrestler, advanced to
the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Cadwallader of Brethren Christian will wrestle Jeff Moriarty
of Poway in the semifinals, but will not get a rematch of his Masters
final, in which he defeated Buck Barger of Villa Park. Barger lost,
10-6, to Kirk Fitzpatrick of Union City James Logan in the
quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Will German of San Fernando still has hopes of becoming the first
City Section wrestler to place twice at the state meet. He lost his
first match in the 171-pound bracket, but won three consecutive
matches in the consolation bracket and needs two more victories today
to place.</TE>

<HD>Scores Are Blowing Up in the Wind</HD>
<DH>Senior golf: Purtzer (70) and Morgan (71) are the only
players to break par during a gusty first round at Valencia.</DH>

<LD>Golf carts weren't tipping over ... but it's not a good sign when the
first, second and last impression of the Valencia Country Club on
Friday was a cold blast of wind.</LD>
<LD>   Welcome to the wind tunnel.</LD>
<LD>   This was an especially devious wind at the $1.45-million SBC
Senior Classic, which runs through Sunday. It changed direction. It
swirled.</LD>
<TE>   And it turned the 190-yard, par-three No. 3 into a little hole of
horror, where Jim Sheerin had a triple-bogey on his way to
seven-over-par 79.</TE>
<TE>   All day you would watch a golfer's pants flutter and flap and then
cease for a moment as he lined up a shot.</TE>
<TE>   At 1 p.m., local weather reports had the winds clocked from the
north at 17 mph, gusting into the 20s. Today's forecast calls for
gusts surging past 30 mph.</TE>
<TE>   As for Friday, scores responded, gusting accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   Only two players, Tom Purtzer (70) and Gil Morgan (71), bettered
par of 72.</TE>
<TE>   In last year's first round, 37 players shot par or better, and 17
were in the 60s.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, four players--Howard Twitty, Tom Watson, Gary McCord
and Walter Hall--were even at 72.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Jim Colbert shot a five-over 77. Ed Dougherty
and Gary Player were at 80, Jim Dent and Miller Barber were at 81,
and Dan O'Neill shot 83.</TE>
<TE>   The average score was 75.86, very high on the senior tour. The
conditions were some of the worst seen on the tour since the first
round of the 1998 Senior U.S. Open at Riviera, where the average
score was 78.91.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, at this event, rains softened the greens. To say Friday
featured a slightly different set of circumstances is an
understatement.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like night and day," said Terry Dill, who shot 77.</TE>
<TE>   Said Morgan, who salvaged his round with birdies on the final two
holes: "The greens are as quick and treacherous as we've played this
year."</TE>
<TE>   Purtzer, the leader, concurred.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of an awkward day, as you can tell by the scores,"
said Purtzer, who had three birdies and one bogey. "Nobody is making
a lot of birdies out there. It's hard to figure out where the wind is
going.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, the most difficult thing for me was the tee shots. I
haven't played this golf course enough to know, when the wind is
blowing like this, what to hit off of each tee.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of a learning experience. I made some mistakes out
there. But overall, I'm very pleased with the score, especially with
the conditions.... There were some exciting shots out there today. It
made you look silly at times. It was a test today."</TE>
<TE>   Purtzer, who turned 50 in December, is in his first year on the
Senior PGA Tour, playing only his fourth tournament. He survived the
tough conditions, showing patience amid the swirling winds. Perhaps
his patience comes from being the father of young twins, a boy and
girl, who are 3.</TE>
<TE>   "They're over here this week," he said, smiling. "I'm trying to
figure out if it keeps me young or if it's aging me by twos. It's
been great."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the week, the two-day SBC Senior Classic Pro-Am raised
$45,000 for charity. Actor Lee Majors and golf pro Tom Wargo won with
a team score of nine-under-par 63. The prize money of $10,000 was
donated by Majors to support Alzheimer's research.</TE>

<HD>McBride Is Back to Business for U.S. Men</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brian McBride returns from his Caribbean honeymoon to lead the United
States against Honduras today as the U.S. men's national soccer team
continues its preparation for the 2002 World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   The 1 p.m. game at Safeco Field in Seattle will be televised live
by ESPN and Telemundo.</LD>
<LD>   McBride, whose four-goal performance led the U.S. to the CONCACAF
Gold Cup last month, missed the team's subsequent 1-0 loss to Italy
in Sicily because he was getting married.</LD>
<TE>   The Columbus Crew striker has scored 18 goals for the U.S. team,
fourth-highest behind Eric Wynalda, Joe-Max Moore and Bruce Murray.
Today, he spearheads an attack that also includes Landon Donovan,
Clint Mathis and the Galaxy's Cobi Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Honduras, which barely failed to reach the World Cup when it lost
its final qualifying game to Mexico, should not be taken lightly by
the U.S. The teams split their qualifying series, with the U.S.
winning, 2-1, in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, and Honduras winning, 3-2,
in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Coach Ernesto Luzardo's side was named FIFA's team of
the year for 2001 after finishing a surprising third in the Copa
America tournament in Colombia. It won the Carlsberg Cup in Hong Kong
last month, routing World Cup-bound Slovenia, 5-1, in the process.</TE>
<TE>   The team's newest standout is striker Saul Martinez, who plays for
Nacional in Uruguay and who has scored seven goals in 14 games for
his country. The U.S. team, which has a 3-2-3 all-time record against
Honduras, has not played in Seattle since it earned a 1-1 tie against
Russia at the Kingdome before the 1994 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Another game was added to the Americans' pre-World Cup itinerary
Friday when it was announced that the U.S. will play Mexico on April
3 at Invesco Field in Denver as the second half of a doubleheader
that also features a Major League Soccer game between the Colorado
Rapids and D.C. United.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Alburfeira, Portugal, the U.S. women's national team earned a
1-1 tie with Sweden on Friday in the opening game of the ninth
Algarve Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Shannon MacMillan of the San Diego Spirit put the U.S.
team ahead in the 31st minute, taking a square pass from Tiffeny
Milbrett and blasting a shot past Swedish goalkeeper Caroline
Jonsson.</TE>
<TE>   The Swedes controlled the second half, however, and secured the
tie because of miscommunication between U.S. defender Joy Fawcett and
goalkeeper LaKeysia Beene, each of whom thought the other was going
for a loose ball. Sweden's Victoria Svensson stole it and drove it
into the empty net from long range.</TE>
<TE>   "We did enough to win the game," U.S. Coach April Heinrichs said.
"But we always take a tie as a loss. That's what separates us from
the rest of the world; our standards are higher."</TE>
<TE>   The level of play will have to be higher, too, against England on
Sunday if the U.S. is to have a chance of winning the 12-nation
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic gold medalist Norway, the U.S. opponent on Tuesday,
defeated England, 3-1, Friday and leads Group B.</TE>
<TE>   In other games, European champion Germany blanked Denmark, 3-0,
and China routed Finland, 4-1, in Group A. In Group C, Canada
defeated Scotland, 3-0, and Wales won its first-ever Algarve Cup
match, beating host Portugal, 1-0.</TE>

<HD>Chatsworth's Guntz Is Pitcher Perfect</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SONDHEIMER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Someone should hook a heart monitor to Chatsworth High pitcher Joe
Guntz to prove that he actually has a pulse. Guntz refuses to become
rattled in tension-filled situations. While others are biting nails
or pacing, he doesn't sweat, doesn't grimace and doesn't worry.</LD>
<LD>   "It's remarkable his composure out there," catcher Jordan Sisson
said. "He never shows the slightest sense of being afraid."</LD>
<LD>   It was vintage Guntz on Friday in the baseball season opener for
Chatsworth, ranked third in the Southland by The Times. Guntz entered
with a 25-0 career record. He was facing seventh-ranked West Hills
Chaminade and USC-bound left-hander Bobby Paschal.</LD>
<TE>   Never before had Guntz been so close to defeat. Chaminade had the
winning run on third base with one out in the bottom of the seventh
inning. "Joe was being Joe," Coach Tom Meusborn said. "You can't tell
if he's throwing a no-hitter or a 10-hitter."</TE>
<TE>   Guntz got a strikeout and groundout to end the inning, then
Chatsworth scored three runs in the eighth to pull out a 6-3 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "He scares the heck out of you every inning," assistant Chuck
Hatfield said.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, in the City Championship game at Dodger Stadium,
Guntz got a called third strike in the seventh inning with the tying
and winning runs on base to secure a 2-1 victory over Roosevelt.</TE>
<TE>   Guntz is trying to pull off the stunning feat of making it through
high school without losing a game on the mound.</TE>
<TE>   "That's an incredible thing to do," Chaminade Coach Scott Drootin
said.</TE>
<TE>   And Guntz might do it. He won't face a better opponent this season
than Chaminade, which reached the Southern Section Division IV
semifinals and returns seven starters. And he won't face a better
pitcher than Paschal, who was 12-1 with a 1.08 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles had waited months to take on Guntz in the most
anticipated opening-week game involving San Fernando Valley teams
since 1997, when Granada Hills Kennedy took on Antelope Valley and 50
professional scouts watched future major league pitchers Jon Garland
and Sean Douglass.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the crowd was large at Pierce College, but there were
only three pro scouts in attendance because Guntz throws 81 mph and
Paschal hits 86 mph. Guntz still doesn't have any college offers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frustrating," he said. "I beat the same guys going to
college. Eventually I have to get a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Said Meusborn: "He's one of those guys teams think, 'We can beat
him,' then they go to the dugout shaking their head."</TE>
<TE>   Chaminade took a 3-1 lead in the third inning on a two-run single
by D.J. Milonas. Chatsworth tied the score, 3-3, in the sixth on
Brett Munster's run-scoring triple off the glove of right fielder
Matt Hynick. The Chancellors finally broke through off reliever Sean
Clark in the eighth, with Sisson contributing a run-scoring single
and Ryan Barba adding a two-run single.</TE>
<TE>   The game lived up to its expectations. Both left-handed pitchers
hung tough. Paschal struck out eight in seven innings. Guntz allowed
five hits in seven innings. There was only one error. By the time
sophomore Jason Dominguez struck out two in the eighth to earn the
save as darkness descended, both teams could feel good about
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the funnest time I've had," said third baseman Cody
Haerther of Chaminade. "You couldn't have had a better game."</TE>
<TE>   Chatsworth is as good as last season's 31-2 team. The Chancellors
improved their record to 16-1 against Southern Section teams over the
last four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Guntz is in position to challenge the state record of 33
consecutive victories established by pitchers Mike Pill of West
Covina Edgewood from 1975-77 and Richard Hunter of Temecula Linfield
from 1991-93.</TE>
<TE>   "I try not to think about it," Guntz said. "I don't want to lose,
but if it happens, it happens."</TE>
<TE>   Guntz said he has a strategy for dealing with pressure. "I take a
deep breath, zero in on the mound and go," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The only time he has trouble is sitting in the dugout. "I'm a
wreck," he said. "I have to be on the mound."</TE>

<DH>UCLA: In his season of junior achievements, Kapono could be
playing his finale at Pauley Pavilion today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the third year in a row, Jason Kapono will watch his senior
teammates honored in a pregame ceremony at the last UCLA home game.
They will accept bouquets of flowers, hug their teary-eyed parents
and even the most jaded fans will cheer.</LD>
<LD>   And for the third year in a row, Kapono will wonder if it, too, is
his last game at Pauley Pavilion. The high-scoring junior forward
seriously considered jumping to the NBA each of the last two seasons
and will do so again.</LD>
<LD>   But he isn't tipping his hand. And he insists he won't become
emotional at the thought of today's game against Oregon being his
last at home.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not even going to think about it at all," he said. "I don't
need to put a crease in my head, pressing because I'm thinking about
that stuff. I'm going to go out and play.</TE>
<TE>   "If I decide to leave, so be it. But I haven't made that decision.
I won't get caught up in thinking about it [today]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Besides giving their parents a chance to beam with pride, seniors
Dan Gadzuric, Billy Knight, Matt Barnes and Rico Hines want something
else out of their last home game.</TE>
<TE>   A victory.</TE>
<TE>   They remember losing to Stanford last season in the last home game
for seniors Earl Watson, Ryan Bailey, Todd Ramasar and Jason Flowers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to cherish the moment and play as hard as I can,"
Knight said. "Losing on senior day last year hurt. We'll play with a
lot of emotion."</TE>
<TE>   Gadzuric, who had nine rebounds and six points against Oregon
State while committing only two fouls, seems to be getting better
treatment from Pacific 10 Conference officials.</TE>
<TE>   Backing in toward the basket late in the first half of Thursday's
game, he sent Beaver center Philip Ricci sprawling. A whistle
sounded, but the call was on Ricci for blocking, and Gadzuric let out
a breath of relief.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-11 center fouled out in the waning seconds of the
Bruins' victory at Stanford last week after playing the entire game
to that point, ending a streak of nine games in a row in which he had
not fouled out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A UCLA victory against Oregon combined with a California victory
at Arizona would deprive the Ducks of an outright regular-season
title, but the Bruins are more concerned about their fate.</TE>
<TE>   A loss could leave UCLA alone in sixth place, which would be the
Bruins' worst Pac-10 finish.</TE>
<TE>   A Bruin victory coupled with a Cal loss would boost UCLA into a
second-place tie. Winning also would give UCLA 20 victories for the
14th consecutive season.</TE>

<DH>USC: Bibby wants to see a leader emerge, saying the lack of
one has resulted in several heartbreaking losses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It could have been their crowning achievement, USC's seniors cutting
down the Sports Arena nets tonight after their final home game as
Pacific 10 Conference regular-season champions.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the Trojans, who play host to Oregon State today, are
playing for a middle-of-the-Pac-10 seeding for next week's league
tournament and are again being challenged by their coach.</LD>
<LD>   These things happen when a team blows an 11-point lead and loses
its fourth game of the season on a shot in the closing seconds, as
happened Thursday when Frederick Jones' runner with one second
remaining gave Oregon a 67-65 victory and a share of the Pac-10
title. A sweep of the Oregon schools would have given USC at least a
share of its first league title since 1985.</LD>
<TE>   "We haven't had that killer instinct to put [teams] away and,
again, it comes back to leadership," Trojan Coach Henry Bibby said.
"Who's the leader on this team to take things on their shoulders and
say, 'I'm not going to let this happen again?' We don't have anyone
to do that, and that's been an Achilles' heel for us."</TE>
<TE>   Bibby went down his laundry list of clutch Pac-10 performers,
whimsically suggesting that Stanford's Casey Jacobsen, Arizona's
Jason Gardner and Luke Walton, UCLA's Jason Kapono and Billy Knight,
and Oregon's Jones and Luke Ridnour all have a gene that does not
allow their teams to lose in such heartbreaking fashion.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have that person to do that yet," Bibby said.</TE>
<TE>   USC has given up six buzzer-beating shots, a game-winner against
Pepperdine; one to send the game into overtime against California and
one to win it with two seconds remaining in the extra period; one at
halftime at UCLA and one at the buzzer to give the Bruins the win;
and Jones' heroics Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans have held sizable leads in each of their last-second
losses, leading Pepperdine by 11 with seven minutes to play,
California by 10 with 8:10 remaining, UCLA by nine with seconds
remaining in the first half and Oregon by 11 with 11 minutes to go.</TE>
<TE>   "I could see how [people] could say that we don't have that
[killer instinct]," said USC point guard Brandon Granville, who will
be honored today during pregame senior-day festivities with David
Bluthenthal, Gennaro Busterna and Sam Clancy.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman guard Errick Craven said the Trojans begin to pace
themselves after getting a big lead.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not as aggressive," Craven said. "The thing that got us
[the lead] was being aggressive, not being afraid of taking shots."</TE>
<TE>   Today's game against the ninth-place Beavers is more about pride
for the Trojans.</TE>

<HD>Pepperdine Aims to Solidify NCAA Resume</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>If Pepperdine needed any added incentive to win the West Coast
Conference men's basketball tournament, the league's coaches may have
provided it this week by selecting Gonzaga's Mark Few as coach of the
year.</LD>
<LD>   Many in Malibu feel that was a slap in the face to Paul Westphal,
who in his first season as coach guided a rebuilt Pepperdine team to
the WCC co-championship with favored Gonzaga after the Waves were
picked to finish fourth in a preseason coaches' poll.</LD>
<LD>   "The players are aware of it, but Paul hasn't made it an issue,"
said a source close to the team, pointing out that Few also won the
award last year. "Nobody picked us higher than fourth. Gonzaga had
all the horses."</LD>
<TE>   Pepperdine and No. 7-ranked Gonzaga lost only to each other in
conference play, and no one would be surprised if the rubber match
came in Monday's 9 p.m. tournament final that will be televised
nationally by ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   The tournament champion earns the WCC's automatic berth in the
NCAA tournament. Gonzaga is probably already in, based on its
national ranking, but Pepperdine needs a strong showing to avoid
having its bubble burst by the NCAA selection committee.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves are seeking their fourth consecutive postseason berth,
having reached the National Invitation Tournament last year and in
1999 and the NCAA tournament in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a spoiler in the field, it could be host San Diego,
which took Pepperdine into double overtime and Gonzaga down to the
wire in close losses at Jenny Craig Pavilion. The Toreros' slow-down
tactics could give Pepperdine problems if the teams meet in the
semifinals on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   A look at today's first-round games at Jenny Craig Pavilion:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 2-seeded Gonzaga (26-3) vs. No. 7 Loyola Marymount (9-19),
noon, KXLU (88.9-FM)--This game could get ugly. Gonzaga has won 11 in
a row since losing at Pepperdine, 88-79, on Jan. 18, the same date
Loyola won its last game before starting an 11-game losing streak.
Guard Dan Dickau, the WCC player of the year, averages a league-best
20.6 points and has made 102 three-point baskets, becoming only the
fifth player in conference history to have more than 100 three-point
baskets in a season. He had one of his best performances in Gonzaga's
94-60 blowout over host Loyola on Jan. 19, scoring 34 points and
making nine three-point baskets, all in the first half. Dickau
deservedly gets most of the credit for the Bulldogs' success, but
center Cory Violette and forward Zach Gourde, two 6-foot-8, 250-pound
bruisers, also play key roles. Violette averages 12.4 points and 8.1
rebounds; Gourde averages 13.6 points and 6.9 rebounds. Loyola relies
on center Greg Lakey, averaging 10.8 points and 5.5 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 Pepperdine (20-7) vs. No. 8 Portland (6-23), approximately
2:15 p.m., KPLS (830)--The Waves' success has been rooted in balance
and depth. Five players have double-figure scoring averages, led by
all-WCC forward Jimmy Miggins (15.3) and freshman guard Terrance
Johnson (13.9). Center Cedric Suitt provides the Waves with a
defensive force, leading conference players with 80 blocked shots.
Pepperdine has won 15 of its last 16 games, including 21- and
six-point victories against Portland. The Pilots have lost 19 of
their last 21 games but, in what has to rank among the biggest upsets
of the college basketball season, defeated Oregon, 79-78, on Dec. 2.
Portland is basically a two-man show: forward Coky Rochin, who
averages 15.7 points and 9.6 rebounds, and sophomore guard Casey
Frandsen, who averages 19.2 points. Pepperdine forward Glen McGowan,
a key reserve who played his two best games against Gonzaga, is
available again after sitting out the last two regular-season games
because of a bruised knee.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 San Francisco (13-14) vs. No. 5 San Diego (15-12), 6
p.m.--Although San Francisco is the higher-seeded team, San Diego
appears to be the favorite based on its 88-55 shellacking of the Dons
at Jenny Craig Pavilion on Feb. 16. San Francisco has lost three of
four games since losing point guard LyRyan Russell to a torn knee
ligament on Feb. 9. Adding to the Dons' run of bad luck is the fact
they are playing the tournament host in the first round for the third
consecutive year. San Diego relies on forward Jason Blair, who leads
the WCC in field-goal percentage.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Santa Clara (13-14) vs. No. 6 St. Mary's (8-19),
approximately 8:15 p.m.--Santa Clara reached the tournament final
last year before losing to Gonzaga, but the Broncos didn't look like
a contender last Saturday in an embarrassing 96-58 loss at
Pepperdine. St. Mary's, under former Pepperdine assistant Randy
Bennett, won three games in February after going 0-8 in January.</TE>

<HD>Hinojosa Blocks Out Pain, Lifts the Waves</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Nothing was easy for Pepperdine in its West Coast Conference women's
tournament semifinal Friday night, least of all for guard Damaris
Hinojosa.</LD>
<LD>   The 5-foot-10 junior once again battled pain, the result of
playing this season with three bulging disks in her back, but she
made big plays down the stretch to carry the Waves to an 82-77
victory over San Francisco before 1,207 at Jenny Craig Pavilion.</LD>
<LD>   Hinojosa, who has put off having surgery until after the season,
scored six of her team's last eight points on her way to a game-high
22 as Pepperdine advanced to the tournament final for the third time
in four years. The top-seeded Waves (22-7) will play second-seeded
Santa Clara (21-8) at 2:30 p.m. Sunday for the WCC's automatic berth
in the NCAA tournament.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a real gutsy performance," said Pepperdine Coach Mark
Trakh. "She shouldn't even be playing with the pain she has."</TE>
<TE>   Hinojosa's running bank shot gave the Waves the lead for good,
78-77, with 1:04 to play, and her rebound led to Shandrika Lee's two
free throws for an 80-77 lead with 23.5 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-seeded San Francisco (18-11) had a chance to tie, but
Lindsey Huff's three-point attempt from the top of the lane sailed
out of bounds with 1.9 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   In the other semifinal:</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clara 87, St. Mary's 84--Guard Caroline Gruening scored 34
points, including eight three-pointers, to lead the Broncos. St.
Mary's is 16-12.</TE>

<TE>   Update--Oregon's Frederick Jones probably cemented the Pacific 10
Conference most-valuable-player award when he made a last-second shot
Thursday to beat USC and assure the Ducks of at least a share of
their first regular-season title since 1944-45. Jones, a senior
forward, has scored in double figures in 22 consecutive games and is
shooting 57% in Pac-10 games. But he is hardly a one-man show.
Sophomore point guard Luke Ridnour and 7-foot senior center Chris
Christoffersen are among the most improved players in the conference.
Reserve center Brian Helquist is questionable because of a knee
injury. The Ducks defeated UCLA at Eugene, 91-62, Jan. 31, and are
16-0 at home, but they are only 5-7 on the road. UCLA has won the
last 17 games against Oregon at Pauley Pavilion.</TE>

<HD>Elusive Univision Chairman Spreads Wealth Around in Gubernatorial
Race</HD>
<DH>Politics: Billionaire has donated $1.3 million to Davis, Riordan
and Jones.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY L. RABIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A. Jerrold Perenchio, the Los Angeles billionaire who heads the
nation's largest Spanish-language television network, has become the
biggest contributor in the California governor's race, donating $1.3
million to three candidates.</LD>
<LD>   Perenchio's extraordinary largess--he has given $625,000 to Democrat
Gray Davis in this race, along with $500,000 to Republican Richard
Riordan and $205,000 to Republican Bill Jones--not only distinguishes him
in the gubernatorial campaign. It also helps deepen the sense of mystery
around the television executive, who is as well known for his elusiveness
as for his political participation.</LD>
<LD>   Perenchio is a former boxing promoter and one-time Hollywood talent
agent who shuns media attention, a potent political player who often
gives to both sides, and a Spanish-language media baron who does not
speak the language that he broadcasts.</LD>
<TE>   Over the last four years, the chairman and CEO of Univision
Communications has given $8.75 million to state and local political
campaigns and has never given an interview to explain his reasons for
those contributions.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't want my name in the . . . paper. You should respect my
privacy," he told a Times reporter in 1981. "I just don't want to give
out any interviews. I just hate them."</TE>
<TE>   Two decades later, nothing has changed. "He does not do interviews,"
said his executive assistant. Associates say they fear being fined or
fired if they speak to the news media.</TE>
<TE>   Fresno-born Perenchio, the grandson of Italian immigrants, had early
successes promoting boxing--he helped arrange the closed-circuit
broadcast of a famous 1971 bout between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. As
a Hollywood agent, his clients included Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando
and Jane Fonda. He helped produce popular television shows such as "The
Jeffersons," and was a pioneer of pay-TV.</TE>
<TE>   Today, his properties include Spanish-language broadcasting, cable
television, Internet sites and the music business.</TE>
<TE>   He also is a major landholder in Malibu, where he has become a
significant political player in a debate over development of his property
there. The next governor will have the power to appoint Coastal
Commission members whose votes could determine the property's future.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a very astute and shrewd businessman," said one admirer.
Perenchio is "a global thinker, looking at the global landscape.
Obviously, he's a big player in that landscape."</TE>
<TE>   His Spanish-language media empire offers politicians and advertisers a
way to reach the nation's rapidly growing Latino population and "that
influence is growing every day."</TE>
<TE>   That ability to reach Spanish-speaking voters, combined with his
substantial wealth, has given Perenchio ample opportunities to play a
role in state and local politics. He has used his money to support an
array of candidates and causes, defying easy ideological or party
characterization.</TE>
<TE>   Garry South, campaign strategist for Davis, said Perenchio is "kind of
an equal-opportunity contributor. He generally gives to both sides."</TE>
<TE>A Republican Who Supports Democrats</TE>
<TE>   In the 1998 gubernatorial campaign, Perenchio contributed $235,000 to
Davis and $200,000 to Davis' opponent, Republican Dan Lungren. South said
he does not "know what the rationale or purpose" of giving to competing
candidates is.</TE>
<TE>   Perenchio is not afraid to take a firm stand on issues. He donated
$1.5 million in an unsuccessful effort to stop a 1998 state proposition
to end most bilingual education in California.</TE>
<TE>   He gave another $1 million in 2000 to an ill-fated campaign to
persuade the state's voters to support vouchers for students to attend
private school.</TE>
<TE>   Even though he is a Republican who supports his party at the state and
national level, Perenchio also backs Democrats. In addition to his Davis
donations, he contributed $135,000 to Antonio Villaraigosa while he was
speaker of the California Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Perenchio also gave $1 million to help Los Angeles host the Democratic
National Convention in 2000, a cause that Riordan, as mayor, championed
and contributed to as well.</TE>
<TE>   And when Riordan sought his financial help to rewrite the city's
charter and put his handpicked candidates on the Los Angeles school
board, Perenchio was there to help, donating at least $525,000 to those
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "The Republican Party appeals to his ideology," said Fernando Guerra,
director of the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount
University. "The Democratic Party appeals to him as a businessman."</TE>
<TE>   Sean Walsh, consultant to Jones, the secretary of state, agreed that
Perenchio spreads his contributions around. He said Perenchio's political
giving is "good for business. He is a man who is not blinded by
ideology."</TE>
<TE>Helped Jones Early in Race</TE>
<TE>   Walsh, who is also a confidant of former Gov. Pete Wilson, said
Perenchio donated early to Jones' candidacy for governor but made it
clear he would back Riordan if his longtime friend entered the race.</TE>
<TE>   "The Perenchios see the Riordans a lot socially," said an associate of
the former mayor. "Because of that good friendship, Dick found it very
easy, whenever he had a cause, to hit Perenchio up for it."</TE>
<TE>   While Perenchio's level of giving makes him one of the state's most
sought-after political donors, he does not take advantage of that role to
draw attention to himself. He rarely appears in public, and even then he
strikes a low profile.</TE>
<TE>   Perenchio made a rare cameo appearance at a Jan. 14 launch party for
Telefutura, Univision's second broadcast network.</TE>
<TE>   The event at Univision's gleaming new glass-and-steel headquarters on
the San Diego Freeway in Westchester was catered by celebrity chef
Wolfgang Puck. There were several open bar stations, and waiters squeezed
through the crowd of mostly advertisers, public-relations types and
Univision staff.</TE>
<TE>   There were also dashes of Hollywood glitterati, boxing champs and
politicos, including Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante and Maria Contreras-Sweet,
Davis' secretary of the state Business, Transportation and Housing
Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Five-time world champion Oscar De La Hoya was there, as well as actors
Hector Elizondo, Lorenzo Lamas, Michael York and Erik Estrada of "CHiPs"
fame.</TE>
<TE>   Perenchio did not speak publicly. Instead, he mingled with some
luminaries. The billionaire would have been inconspicuous--pale
complexion, corporate gray hair and a patriotic red-white-and-blue
tie--if not for his blue-blazered security detail.</TE>
<TE>   He spent some time talking privately with Riordan before being whisked
away by his security team about a half-hour before the speeches started.
In his absence, however, Perenchio's aides made the sort of partisan
statement that he loathes to make himself.</TE>
<TE>   When the speeches began, a Perenchio associate introduced Riordan as
"the next governor of California."</TE>
<TE>   Contreras-Sweet was stunned at the slight to Davis, and she complained
vigorously to Univision staff members at the event. A Univision executive
said later that introducing Riordan in that fashion was done at the
instruction of Perenchio.</TE>
<TE>   If Perenchio's interests are global, they also occasionally are
intensely local. Take the television executive's investments along the
narrow coastal plain of Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   Perenchio has had a personal and professional place in Malibu for many
years. When he is not at his sprawling mansion in Bel-Air or at
Univision's Century City or Westchester offices, the 71-year-old is known
to enjoy life at the Malibu Colony, a spectacular enclave of oceanfront
homes. His personal golf course lies behind a high stone wall near that
home.</TE>
<TE>   Outside that wall, Perenchio owns some of the largest pieces of open
land in the heart of Malibu. His plans for that property have been
roiling the political waters in the exclusive beach community for some
time.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal by Malibu Bay Co., the holding company for Perenchio's
coastal properties, would convert some of his land in the Civic Center
area to commercial uses such as shopping centers and office buildings.
Its plans, negotiated with two City Council members, are contained in a
development agreement that needs final approval from the city government.</TE>
<TE>Perenchio-Backed Initiative Prevailed</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists worried about the potential for large-scale
development of the open land in the Civic Center placed an initiative on
the November 2000 Malibu ballot to require a public vote on any
commercial project more than 25,000 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council responded by putting before the voters a narrower
proposal that would require a public vote only in the case of extensive
commercial development on 30 acres or more--a limitation that would
include the Malibu Bay Co. land.</TE>
<TE>   Perenchio spent nearly $200,000 on newspaper and cable television ads,
mailers, slate cards and videotapes sent to voters. The campaign against
the initiative and in favor of the council's alternative was only partly
successful. Both measures passed. But the council's approach received
more votes and prevailed.</TE>
<TE>   While the two sides were battling at the ballot box that fall, Gov.
Davis signed legislation by then-Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg and
Senate President Pro-Tem John Burton. The law stripped Malibu of the
responsibility to prepare and adopt a local coastal program to regulate
development and protect natural resources along the coast. Instead, it
gave final power over planning in that area to the California Coastal
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever is elected governor this fall will influence the direction of
the Coastal Commission--and the future of some of the most valuable
coastal property in the world.</TE>
<TE>   The governor, the Assembly speaker and the Senate president each
appoint four members of the 12-member commission. The commission oversees
development along the state's entire 1,100-mile coastline.</TE>
<TE>   "The power of appointment is of paramount importance," said attorney
Melvin Nutter, a former commission chairman and head of the League for
Coastal Protection. "Clearly, the Coastal Commission is a political body
with political appointees."</TE>
<TE>   The commission and Malibu government could soon be at odds, as the
development agreement and coastal panel's visions for the area are
significantly different. The city's deal with the Malibu Bay Co. allows
for commercial and residential development, while the commission's local
coastal program is more limited: It emphasizes visitor uses.</TE>
<TE>   "The Civic Center is the largest area of undeveloped land in the
city," said Gary Timm, district manager for the Coastal Commission. "It
should reflect a reasonable amount of visitor-serving uses" such as
overnight accommodations, restaurants, surf and dive shops and businesses
that encourage recreation. "Office buildings are typically not called
visitor-serving."</TE>
<TE>   Although Perenchio and his associates will not discuss the issue, his
son, John, argued in a series of newspaper advertisements that the
development agreement represents a fair compromise between the city and
the developer.</TE>
<TE>   It is the Coastal Commission that has the power to resolve those
differences--and its actions will therefore have profound implications
for Malibu and for Perenchio.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a Malibu issue. This is a state issue," said Steve
Uhring, president of the Malibu Coastal Land Conservancy.</TE>
<TE>   "The Coastal Commission's charter is to protect the coast. If the
Coastal Commission can't protect the environment in Malibu, who is going
to?"</TE>

<HD>Plan to Bag Rivers May Not Float</HD>
<DH>An entrepreneur's bid to tug giant sacks of fresh North Coast water
to San Diego stirs up anger amid the skepticism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALBION, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>It boasts an audacious history, this business of water in the West.
From dams the size of mountains to aqueducts across the desert, the
landscape has been re-plumbed in ways Mother Nature never pondered. Water
percolates through some of the best fiction and most of the best fights.</LD>
<LD>   Even dreamy schemes to capture icebergs or run transcontinental
pipelines bubble up from time to time, which is why folks here on the
scenic North Coast are keeping a close eye on a plan they brand a classic
Southern California water grab--"Chinatown" in a giant Baggie.</LD>
<LD>   The man with the bag is Ric Davidge.</LD>
<TE>   A water entrepreneur from Alaska, Davidge is an industrious fellow
whose Reagan administration resume seems to eco-warriors clear proof of
villainy.</TE>
<TE>   His company wants to suck fresh water from two North Coast rivers,
stow it in massive poly-fiber bags the length of a World War II
battleship, and tow the floating sacks hundreds of miles south--dodging
oil tankers and migrating whales--to slake San Diego's thirst.</TE>
<TE>   But first, Davidge will have to convert regulators, politicians and
often-feisty residents--in this case, the denizens of Mendocino County,
where locals consider coastal protection a birthright.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel Binah, a coastal innkeeper and ardent environmentalist, said
the idea initially seemed "harebrained, goofy, ridiculous, ludicrous,
absurd."</TE>
<TE>   But with Davidge plowing forward with a formal proposal to a state
water agency, the snickers are subsiding and concern is growing, Binah
says. "It could potentially be very, very dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   Davidge wants to use his oceangoing bags to tote 20,000 acre-feet of
water each year from the Albion and Gualala (pronounced wa-LA-la)
rivers--enough for 40,000 households.</TE>
<TE>   He brings to the brawl some well-heeled backers, among them a large
Japanese shipping line and a Saudi Arabian company that boasts a variety
of multibillion-dollar international ventures, including the largest
independent Toyota distributorship on the globe. As a deputy to former
Interior Secretary James Watt, a man environmentalists loved to hate,
Davidge knows how to work a room full of angry people.</TE>
<TE>   His scheme has whipped up distrust reminiscent of past north-south
water wars. Mendocino County supervisors are on record opposing the
project. The California Coastal Commission has begun to grumble. Sen. Wes
Chesbro (D-Arcata) is lobbying state water officials in opposition.</TE>
<TE>   The most vocal opponents are the region's axis of latter-day hippies,
environmentally minded urban refugees and nature-loving merchants of
tourism.</TE>
<TE>   They are a battle-tested bunch. In the 1960s, North Coast activists
beat back a nuclear power plant. They defeated offshore oil in the 1980s
and fought to save the redwoods in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   On the banks of the Albion, a vortex of the back-to-the-land movement,
they've coined a whimsical sovereign status: The "Albion Nation," they
call themselves.</TE>
<TE>   And they're itching for a tussle.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a lot of practice," mused Bill Heil, who came to Albion
three decades ago to join a commune and has been here ever since. "I
don't think the project will fly, but we'll have a good time fighting
it."</TE>
<TE>   Big bags are not a new notion in the West Coast water wars. Manhattan
Beach inventor Terry Spragg has been trying without success for a decade
to pitch his "Spragg Bags" for runs along the coast.</TE>
<TE>   But the bag technology floated by Davidge's Anchorage-based Alaska
Water Exports is already at work in the real world, on a run between
Turkey and Cyprus operated by Nordic Water Supply, a partner in the
Mendocino proposal.</TE>
<TE>   So far, that operation has been a money loser. Nature has caused
unexpected complications. In December 2000, Nordic lost a bag in stormy
seas off Cyprus before recovering it unscathed. Another bag had torn open
and spilled during an earlier trip.</TE>
<TE>   Davidge says tougher fabrics and seamless technology used in the bags,
which are stitched by mammoth looms, will prevent such mishaps. Coastal
regulators remain skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "There's the potential for these bags breaking loose, entangling in
habitat. How do you get them out?" wondered Peter Douglas, executive
director of the Coastal Commission. "There's just a whole range of issues
raised by this proposal that are very serious."</TE>
<TE>Approval of 2 Panels Required</TE>
<TE>   The plan requires approval of the Coastal Commission as well as the
State Water Resources Control Board. As long a shot as the scheme seems,
Chesbro recently wrote the board's chairman that it threatens to reignite
the state's epic water wars and set "a troubling precedent" for rivers on
the coast.</TE>
<TE>   Out here, amid the sweeping surf and stately redwoods, every bend in
the road offers another breathtaking view, another chance to embrace one
of nature's masterpieces. With grassy bluffs and foam-washed coves, the
Mendocino coast has a ready-made constituency of stewards and protectors.</TE>
<TE>   "They've come to the wrong place," grumbled Bernie Macdonald,
Mendocino's Green Party secretary and a veteran of environmental fights.
"We're prepared to go as far as we have to go."</TE>
<TE>   Some inveterate activists are already talking up "monkey wrenching,"
puncturing water bags as a form of pro-environment sabotage.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Perkins, Albion's Sierra Club liaison, hears people around
Albion's tiny center--a grocery store, a post office--pose the telling
question, "with a wink, wink" at the end. "Everyone asks: 'So, how thick
are those bags anyway?' It may be bravado, but people are thinking about
it."</TE>
<TE>   Davidge, 54, who grew up in Mission Hills, seems unfazed. He weathered
political battles alongside Watt, whose federal tenure remains a bitter
memory for western environmentalists. A self-styled environmentalist, the
bearded Davidge says he was considered "the greenie" in Reagan's Interior
Department. He later was Alaska's top water official before setting out
as a water entrepreneur.</TE>
<TE>   He also has served as an aide to U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). In
the private sector, Davidge has worked on projects ranging from port
development to the cleanup of the Exxon Valdez spill. He is also a man of
culture, operating an Anchorage professional theater company that
produces the work of Alaskan playwrights.</TE>
<TE>   Davidge makes a practice of writing endlessly about water issues. One
paper, about the potential for exporting water from Alaska, prompted
investors to recruit him to run World Water, the Luxembourg-registered
firm that is pushing the bag proposal. Davidge's partners in World Water
are the Japanese shipping firm NYK Line; Mizutech, an investment
subsidiary of the Saudi-based AJL Group; and Nordic Water Supply, a
Norwegian venture company.</TE>
<TE>   The group is working to cobble together deals in other water-starved
locales, from the Middle East to North Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "You're talking about a guy who has been doggedly, tenaciously
pursuing the bulk water business for years," said Gil Serrano, who
himself gave up on it to start a bottled water firm, Alaska Glacier
Refreshments. "Ric won't give up easy. You'll have to use a silver bullet
to kill him."</TE>
<TE>   Davidge considers San Diego the key to winning acceptance of the big
bags.</TE>
<TE>   For several years, the arid border metropolis has been requesting
proposals for new ways to ease its heavy reliance on imported water for
its 1.25 million residents.</TE>
<TE>   While eyeing Davidge's proposal, "we're strictly on the sidelines
right now," said Kurt Kidman, a San Diego Water Department spokesman.
Davidge and company will not only have to beat the $444 per acre-foot
that San Diego now pays, but also do it without ruffling feathers in
Mendocino or elsewhere, Kidman said. "We're not out to steal anyone's
water."</TE>
<TE>Value of Idea Escapes Many</TE>
<TE>   Other water officials won't give Davidge the time of day. At the
Metropolitan Water District, the giant umbrella agency that provides
Southern California's water, Davidge's proposal prompts groans. Tim
Quinn, the district's vice president for state water projects, said
"silly ideas like this" only serve to inflame "north-south passions
needlessly."</TE>
<TE>   Davidge rues being pulled into old fights. But he suggests that the
Southern California economy could falter without new water sources. In
the world according to Davidge, North Coast residents need to embrace
their symbiotic ties with the Southland.</TE>
<TE>   After surveying 15 coastal tributaries, Davidge said his team narrowed
its search to the Albion and Gualala because their water is unpolluted
and neither hosts an ecological reserve.</TE>
<TE>   Davidge wants to bury a 24-inch pipeline from an offshore buoy up the
spine of each river, hundreds of yards inland to where tidal saltwater
isn't a factor. Water would be pumped to the offshore station and into
the oceangoing bags. A tugboat would slowly make the trip down the coast
with the hulking cargo, more than 850 feet long and 100 feet wide, with a
draft of about 24 feet.</TE>
<TE>   With sunny promotional zeal, Davidge has answers for most every
perceived pitfall.</TE>
<TE>   Worried about construction messing up the rivers?</TE>
<TE>   It would be performed during low water months without harming the
environment, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Frosty over robbed water messing up river hydrology?</TE>
<TE>   Davidge vows to take water only during the huge flows of winter
months, when, he says, there is plenty to spare.</TE>
<TE>   Irked over the prospect of views made icky by bags lolling like whales
belly-up?</TE>
<TE>   The giant sacks ride out of view, beneath the waves, the promoter
insists.</TE>
<TE>   Peppered with hundreds of negative e-mails, Davidge says he answers
them all. Naysayers, he insists, will be swayed once they learn about the
project's technological promise. He even plans a public meeting on the
North Coast in the coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Expect the Albion Nation to turn out in force.</TE>
<TE>   Perkins of the Sierra Club says the water project would harm the
endangered coho salmon and steelhead trout of the coastal rivers, and
trample the eelgrass beds that harbor the juvenile smolts.</TE>
<TE>   "We see this as the foot in the door," said Perkins, who believes her
"little Podunk river" was selected because communities of the Mendocino
coast are small and lack clout.</TE>
<TE>   Down the coast in Gualala, population 585, the sentiments are just as
sharp. Around a big table at a local coffeehouse, foes gathered one
recent morning over steaming mugs to share fears.</TE>
<TE>Business People Raise Concerns</TE>
<TE>   The Gualala was once the fishing playground of Jack London, actor Fred
MacMurray and former California Gov. and U.S. Chief Justice Earl Warren.
Craig Bell, a fishing guide, knows every deep-water spot: Switchfail,
Snag, Miner's Hole. A water pipe, he said, would wreak havoc.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Scott, manager of a real estate office, worries that tourists
will be turned off by views of tugboats and jumbo-sized bags. "He's
saying his project will bring jobs," Scott said. "But how many will we
lose?"</TE>
<TE>   Davidge may contend that the sacks absorb the energy of waves while
parked offshore, but "that bag isn't just going to sit there when 20-foot
swells start hitting," insists Jim Koogle, a carpenter. "It'll be on the
beach."</TE>
<TE>   Others grumble that Davidge is fueling Southern California's
"unsustainable addiction" to imported water. They talk of their rivers
becoming a poker chip in international trade. They fret that the sacks
might impede gray whales rollicking in the river mouth.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Harris, who runs a kayak rental business, considers this fight
part of the California continuum, the state's tangled saga on water.
"Bigger areas than ours," he grumbled, "have been wiped out."</TE>
<TE>   With the battle joined, listen to the wisdom of Alan Graham, known in
Albion by his nom-de-guerre, Captain Fathom.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole thing is a preposterous joke," Graham said. "They want to
get us laughing so hard we'll be too out of breath to fight when they try
something serious."</TE>

<HD>Riordan Trailing, Goes On Attack</HD>
<DH>Primary: Ex-mayor calls Simon an unelectable extremist. New
front-runner looks toward unseating Gov. Davis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The increasingly bitter race for California governor caromed into
its final weekend Friday, with Republican Richard Riordan assailing Bill
Simon Jr. as an unelectable extremist and Simon looking past Tuesday's
primary to a general election contest against Democrat Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   As the candidates locked in their final advertising of the campaign--a
mix of positive and negative spots--the three top GOP hopefuls staged a
final debate of sorts, appearing one after the other in the studio of
Adelphia Cable in Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   Significantly, Friday's deadline to buy weekend advertising passed
without any candidate upping his buy or altering his strategy for the
final days. That was particularly notable for Riordan, who has fallen in
recent polls after leading the race for months.</LD>
<TE>   While Riordan did not boost his advertising, he lashed out at Simon
with new vehemence in conversations with reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Former Los Angeles Mayor Riordan said Simon--whom he once urged to run
for governor--was too extreme to win. He followed up at a Hollywood stop
by calling his friend and fellow parishioner a "sanctimonious hypocrite."</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly cast in the role of front-runner, Simon stayed above the
day's give-and-take, discussing how he hoped to broaden his support in
November among Californians who are more moderate than Republican primary
voters on issues such as abortion and gun control.</TE>
<TE>   "The social issues to me are not the centerpiece of my agenda," Simon
said. "My ideology is of smaller government, local government, focusing
on our people, individual empowerment and opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   The first-time candidate further asserted that his amateur status
would be a plus against Gov. Davis, whose winning slogan in the 1998
Democratic primary was "experience money can't buy."</TE>
<TE>   "If Gray Davis has experience money can't buy, and now we've had his
leadership for the last four years, I think we got experience we don't
want to pay for," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   The third top GOP hopeful, Secretary of State Bill Jones, continued to
question his opponents' party loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   Focusing chiefly on Simon, Jones criticized the Pacific Palisades
businessman for donating $5,000 to a Democrat running for governor in New
York and for a $95,000 contribution to the reelection of San Francisco
Mayor Willie Brown. The latter was given by a partnership of Simon's
investment company.</TE>
<TE>   "If that's a conservative, Reagan Republican record, then that's
turned upside-down," Jones said. "I don't remember Reagan doing that, and
I was there when he started out."</TE>
<TE>   The harsh tones from two of the candidates contrasted with a softening
of the paid advertising. Riordan and Simon planned to end on television
with a gradual reduction of vitriol over the next several days.</TE>
<TE>   So, too, did Davis, who began the primary's advertising onslaught with
a spot six weeks ago attacking Riordan's position on abortion--a bit of
intraparty meddling that helped open the way for Simon's surge.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the major gubernatorial candidates made their final purchase
of ad time earlier this week; Riordan, Simon and Davis were all spending
roughly the same amount, $1.5 million apiece.</TE>
<TE>   But Friday was significant because it marked the last time candidates
could shuffle their ads--or fine-tune their strategies--before ads were
locked in over the final crucial weekend of campaigning.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his slide in polls, Riordan chose not to amplify his attacks
on Simon or increase his ad buy, a sign he was determined not to invest
any personal money in the campaign--as he vowed all along.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, a multimillionaire who spent $6 million of his own money on
his first mayoral campaign in 1993, also promised Friday not to spend any
of his cash in the general election if he emerges victorious from
Tuesday's primary. He made his pledge while criticizing Davis' prodigious
fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   "You couldn't buy Dick Riordan's vote," he said. "But you can buy Gray
Davis'."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Riordan said he regretted spending his own money in his 1993
run. "It's certainly healthier to have many people involved rather than
one person trying to buy an election," Riordan said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who has struggled financially throughout the race, bought about
$300,000 worth of ads over the final week. His lone spot features former
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian endorsing Jones and assailing Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Riordan, Simon and Davis were all following roughly the
same strategies for the weekend's final push. The candidates will start
the weekend with a mixture of positive and negative spots, the latter
reprising familiar charges and countercharges over trustworthiness and
party loyalty (in the case of Simon and Riordan).</TE>
<TE>   The ad mix will slowly change over the weekend until all three
candidates have nothing but positive spots running Monday. Such a move is
typical, as candidates seek to finish their campaigns with a message they
hope will leave voters feeling friendly as they head to the polls.</TE>
<TE>   But the move to a more elevated tone on the airwaves was not matched
by increased goodwill on the campaign trail.</TE>
<TE>   During an appearance Friday at the recently opened Hollywood &amp;
Highland shopping center, Riordan would not even deign to call Simon a
friend.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that the two men attend the same church in Santa Monica,
Riordan told reporters: "I had a respect for him from a distance. I've
lost that respect in this campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Calling his rival "an ultra-ultraconservative," Riordan went on to
suggest Simon had no chance of winning over women and minority voters--a
key to any successful Republican campaign in November.</TE>
<TE>   "He is for [an antiabortion] platform that excludes over half the
women in this state," Riordan said. "There is no way he's going to get
the women's vote."</TE>
<TE>   Simon chose not to address the evident rupture in his relationship
with Riordan, leaving the response to a spokesman, Bob Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's understandable that emotions can reach a fever pitch in the
closing days of a race like this," Taylor said. "But while Bill's focused
on issues people really care about, it seems that Dick Riordan can't
handle the fact that his campaign is really unraveling."</TE>
<TE>   With the polls showing Simon rising and Riordan falling, the two men
traveled at oddly contrasting paces Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Simon started his day with a 7:30 a.m. breakfast appearance in San
Diego, dashed to Santa Monica for the cable appearance, toured an
animation studio, then flew north for a five-city sprint through the top
half of the state today.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan kept a more limited public schedule. After the cable show and
his stop in Hollywood, Riordanheaded to San Francisco for an appearance
in a comedy show he planned to reprise tonight. He had only one public
event scheduled for Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign aides denied, however, that Riordan was slackening his pace
or taking it easy at a time when candidates usually embark on the most
punishing part of their campaign schedules. Riordan has done many radio
interviews by telephone, and aides said he was keeping up a frenetic pace
of fund-raising behind closed doors.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, meanwhile, hopscotched from the Central Coast to San Diego and
the Inland Empire. He delivered a selective and decidedly negative
overview of Riordan's eight years as Los Angeles mayor, concluding: "It
is a record of mismanagement that Gray Davis will use to destroy the
Republican Party if our nominee is Dick Riordan."</TE>

<HD>Sectarian Violence Racks India</HD>
<DH>Riots: Scores are burned alive in Hindu-Muslim clashes in western
state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AHMADABAD, India
</DL>
<LD>Neighbors battled neighbors with sticks, steel rods and swords in
the narrow dirt lanes of this city's Naroda district, where dozens of
homes and shops were looted and burned during three days of violence
between Hindus and Muslims.</LD>
<LD>   The charred remains of a man's corpse still lay this morning where his
killers set him ablaze, outside a one-story house in Naroda's poor
Jawaharnagar neighborhood, on Ahmadabad's north side. The body was
surrounded by the burnt steel frame of a cot. The man's fists were frozen
in the air, as if he died struggling to get up.</LD>
<LD>   More than 275 people have died since a mob in the town of Godhra in
western India set fire to a train carrying Hindu nationalists Wednesday
from the northern Indian city of Ayodhya, where right-wing Hindus want to
build a temple on the site of a mosque destroyed in 1992. At least 58
people, including 14 children, died in the train attack. The toll from
the reprisals has grown by the day.</LD>
<TE>   A year ago, Ahmadabad, like Godhra a part of Gujarat state, was
reeling from a massive earthquake. Now it is struggling to stop a
convulsion of violence rooted in the ancient feud over religion.</TE>
<TE>   Hindu nationalists want to build a temple honoring Rama, an avatar or
incarnation of the god Vishnu, on what they say was the original site of
a temple demolished in the 16th century and replaced by a mosque known as
the Babri Masjid. A Hindu mob destroyed the mosque on Dec. 6, 1992.</TE>
<TE>   The right-wing Vishwa Hindu Parishad party says it will defy a court
order and try to build a Hindu temple at the Ayodhya site as early as
March 15, but Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has sent
thousands of paramilitary police to stop the group.</TE>
<TE>   The Hindu nationalist group has offered a compromise: It would
postpone its plan to build the temple for three months, giving the
government more time to resolve the issue, if its supporters are allowed
to pray at the disputed site over newly carved pillars for the temple.</TE>
<TE>   The 1992 razing of the 16th century mosque sparked nationwide riots
that killed 2,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   Hindus are the majority in India, but 140 million of its 1 billion
people are Muslims. There were fears that the violence would spread
across the country, but so far it mostly has been limited to Ahmadabad
and other parts of Gujarat state.</TE>
<TE>   It is clear from the damage that people went from door to door,
looting and burning in a crowded neighborhood with few avenues of escape.</TE>
<TE>   The corpse of the burned man won't enter the official death toll until
it is collected and delivered to the morgue. But by Friday night, local
hospitals said they had received 65 bodies from the Naroda district, just
one of several ravaged by mobs.</TE>
<TE>   "They killed four Hindus and pulled their eyes out," said one
resident, Ram Kirit Pannalal, 35. "Then they stuck swords in their
stomachs and split them. They started shouting, 'Now we'll show you!' "</TE>
<TE>   In the village of Pandavarda, near Godhra, a mob herded at least 30
people into a house and burned them alive Friday afternoon, police said.</TE>
<TE>   In another attack, a crowd of about 200 swarmed six people walking
next to a highway, about 30 miles from Godhra, and set them on fire.</TE>
<TE>   And officials said today that a Hindu mob torched the Muslim village
of Sardarpura late Friday, killing at least 27 people.</TE>
<TE>   The fighting in Naroda began Thursday about 10 a.m., several survivors
said today. A few buildings were still smoldering in the area, where
several blocks of houses and shops were looted and torched.</TE>
<TE>   It is a scene reminiscent of "ethnic cleansing" during the collapse of
the Yugoslav federation, and although India's current unrest is a far cry
from the Balkan agony, it has shocked a country that prides itself on
religious tolerance.</TE>
<TE>   Hindu survivors in Naroda complained today that Gujarat state police,
sent to restore order, actually stood by as Muslim mobs went on a killing
spree.</TE>
<TE>   And then, on Friday night, the police moved about 500 Muslim residents
to "a safer place," Pannalal said. "We'll never allow them back," said
Pannalal, who was armed with a chain and a stick. He stood menacingly
with a small group of men and boys, guarding the invisible border between
their neighborhood and the gutted remains of Jawaharnagar.</TE>
<TE>   Pannalal and Jagdish Tombar, 30, claimed that about 15 of their Muslim
neighbors of starting the trouble by throwing stones.</TE>
<TE>   "It was organized. They had buckets full of stones," Pannalal said
through an interpreter. "They attacked us, and then we got agitated too.
Even women started attacking."</TE>
<TE>   As the violence escalated, police did not open fire or do anything
else to disperse the mobs, the men claimed. Other survivors have made
similar accusations.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of Ahmadabad set up self-defense groups, fearing more
violence this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "I appeal to you for calm, the troops are here, please cooperate with
them," Defense Minister George Fernandes told an angry group of people
who said police inaction had left Muslims at the mercy of extremists.</TE>
<TE>   A curfew has been imposed in 37 towns across the state and 1,500
people have been arrested in the violence, including 63 on murder charges
in the train attack, said Gujarat Home Secretary K. Nityanandam.</TE>
<TE>   Police opened fire during one clash between Hindu and Muslim youths,
killing six people and wounding 70, said Deputy Police Commissioner R.J.
Savani.</TE>
<TE>   The city was mainly quiet this morning, but most shops were closed and
several thousand police and soldiers guarded key areas with orders to
shoot on sight to stop further riots, looting or arson.</TE>
<TE>   Vajpayee has also come under intense criticism because many here think
that he was too slow in sending in troops. A crowd pelted Fernandes on
Friday in Ahmadabad when he tried to calm them.</TE>
<TE>   Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi said he had sought more troops
and reserve police forces from neighboring states. "I have been assured
all forces will be made available to bring peace. We are making
progress," Modi said.</TE>

<HD>Letterman Bid Reflects ABC's Shift From News</HD>
<DH>Network: Moves toward entertainment include replacing '20/20' with
a Disney-produced drama.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ABC's dramatic bid to bring David Letterman's late-night talk show
over from CBS to replace "Nightline" marks only the latest slight to ABC
News--once the network's crown jewel--since Walt Disney Co. acquired the
network. The proposed deal underscores a power shift from the network's
high-profile news anchors to its entertainment side.</LD>
<LD>   Despite heightened interest in national and world events after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon,
ABC insiders, competitors and critics say the news operation that former
ABC News President Roone Arledge assembled is being undermined as Disney
seeks to rehabilitate the struggling network amid tough economic times.</LD>
<LD>   ABC has made a lucrative, undisclosed offer to Letterman, whose
contract with CBS expires in August. Reaching a deal would displace
"Nightline"--the prestigious news program anchored by Ted Koppel that ABC
has broadcast at 11:30 p.m. for more than 20 years--and the discussion
show "Politically Incorrect With Bill Maher."</LD>
<TE>   Reacting to reports of the talks that leaked out Thursday, Letterman's
representatives issued a statement saying the host is negotiating with
CBS and it would be "inappropriate at this time to discuss any inquiries
we may have received from other networks."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Letterman's courtship has come from the highest levels at
Disney--including Chairman Michael Eisner, who made a reference to
"Nightline" in testimony Thursday before the Senate Commerce Committee,
even as his staff pursued a deal that would eliminate the show from the
nightly schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the overtures to Letterman, other decisions reflecting the
power shift toward entertainment include moving Barbara Walters'
newsmagazine showcase "20/20" from the Friday time slot it occupied for
more than a decade, replacing it with a Disney-produced drama; and
ordering an entertainment program featuring U.S. soldiers in
Afghanistan--"Profiles From the Front Lines," under the aegis of "Top
Gun" producer Jerry Bruckheimer--despite news division objections.</TE>
<TE>   At this point sources say the decision regarding Letterman's move
rests with the mercurial host. Letterman taped two shows Thursday before
heading off on a scheduled vacation that will leave the show in reruns
next week.</TE>
<TE>   Although "Late Show With David Letterman" trails NBC's "The Tonight
Show With Jay Leno" in the ratings, it remains highly profitable for CBS,
which clearly wants to retain the franchise.</TE>
<TE>   CBS declined to comment, while ABC issued a statement saying that
"Nightline" "has been and continues to be a valuable contributor to ABC.
. . . We are hopeful that 'Nightline' and Ted will continue to make
significant contributions to ABC."</TE>
<TE>   The ratings for "Nightline" eroded somewhat this year as competition
from 24-hour cable news channels has grown increasingly fierce.
Additionally, over the last year Koppel has reduced his role on the show.
Still, ABC news division President David Westin reminded the staff Friday
that the show made $13 million in profit last year and that its ratings
had dropped much less than the network has in prime time. However,
critics who monitor news saw the latest development at ABC as
illustrative of a telling shift in priorities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a fundamental change, [and] symbolically, it's important," said
Carroll Doherty, editor of the Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press in Washington, D.C. "If it occurs, the statement from the network
no doubt will be, 'This doesn't represent a diminution in news in any
way,' but the facts are pretty obvious. . . . This show hasn't trimmed
its sails at all. It presents serious news and didn't lighten up like
some of the morning shows."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond high-stakes corporate gamesmanship, the situation highlights
the tensions TV news divisions face as part of companies such as
Disney--which have grown larger in recent years through consolidation and
are driven by profit-and-loss statements. While that has been true at all
the networks, TV industry sources see the battle shaping up at ABC as
particularly fractious.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, an agreement would have benefits for Disney far and above
ABC, given that the studio has a major investment in New York City
theater, where its "Lion King," "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aida" are
running on Broadway. Letterman's show has always acted as something of an
advertisement for New York City, which still is suffering from a tourist
downturn after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Word of the proposed deal completely blindsided ABC's news division
and Westin, who was said to have learned about the talks Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   Sources who heard Westin on Friday morning's staff conference call
described him as upset as he discussed what would be a "tremendous blow."</TE>
<TE>   As for Koppel, he could be offered other opportunities, perhaps in
prime time, but any move out of late night would likely breach a new
five-year contract he signed in December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   ABC News and "Nightline" officials declined to comment, but in his
daily e-mail to viewers, executive producer Leroy Sievers called it "a
difficult day for all of us at 'Nightline,' the first, I fear, of many
difficult days to come."</TE>
<TE>   Sievers said the staff learned Thursday that the New York Times was
going to report on ABC's negotiations with Letterman to replace the show
at 11:35 p.m. "This came as a complete shock to all of us. Ted has
returned from what was to have been a long weekend, but to this point, no
executive from ABC or Disney has spoken to him. . . . For now, we are
going to let our work speak for itself."</TE>
<TE>   Complaints from the news division to Disney have largely gone
unheeded, a departure from the relationship news talent enjoyed with
management before Disney acquired Capital Cities/ABC in 1996. Under the
previous regime, ABC Entertainment executives for years were thwarted in
their attempts to secure valuable prime-time real estate by the network's
powerful news anchors, including Walters and Diane Sawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Stewardship of ABC News passed in 1998 to Westin, the network's former
general counsel and onetime right-hand man to Disney President Robert
Iger. Westin has labored to overcome his lack of journalistic
credentials. Some staffers fault Westin for not being in a position to
argue forcefully against ABC's desire to boot "Nightline" from its
current slot.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Jennings, anchor of ABC's "World News Tonight," expressed
support for "Nightline" but declined to discuss the broader issues.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know about this," Jennings said. "But I do know this: Ted
and 'Nightline' exemplify the high quality of ABC News and contribute to
making us unique."</TE>
<TE>   Koppel has criticized the major networks' lessened commitment to news
gathering, particularly abroad. In an interview with The Times days
before the Sept. 11 attacks, he said: "We have convinced ourselves . . .
that the American public doesn't care about foreign news. It's so
convenient for the industry right now to say the American public doesn't
care. That way, we can cover Congressman [Gary] Condit 24 hours a day.
It's easy, it's cheap and people do seem to be watching."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever ill feelings exist at ABC News, Disney officials have made it
clear that reviving ABC's prime-time ratings and profits are a priority.
Both have fallen dramatically this season, due in part to the failure of
new series and the rapid ratings decline of the once wildly popular quiz
show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."</TE>
<TE>   Other recent deals underscoring Disney's commitment to ABC include
signing Fox commentator John Madden to join "Monday Night Football" next
season and paying a record fee for TV rights to "Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone" and its sequel.</TE>
<TE>   As cable has poached on the franchise's "news story of the day"
territory and the famously contrary Koppel has cut his air time to three
nights a week, "Nightline" has worked hard to reshape its identity.
Increasingly, it has tackled neglected stories, such as a recent series
on war in Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Gottlieb, the deputy director of Project for Excellence in
Journalism in Washington, called "Nightline" "one of the most serious
news shows on television" but acknowledged the various mitigating forces
affecting TV news, including the sluggish advertising market and the glut
of news on cable outlets.</TE>
<TE>   "In the new media environment, if I'm Disney and I look around and see
NBC and CBS are making money with Leno and Letterman, then I ask myself,
'Well, why not me?' " he said.</TE>

doesn't want firearms on flights.</DH>

</DL>
<LD>Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said he opposes pilots'
demands for firearms to defend the cockpit against hijackers but would
support stun guns that use an electric current to temporarily
incapacitate an attacker.</LD>
<LD>   When the user is properly trained, "I think that stun guns are the way
to go," Mineta said in an interview with The Times, the first time he has
taken a position on the emotionally charged issue. Two airlines, United
and Phoenix-based Mesa, already have expressed interest in the nonlethal
weapons in anticipation of government approval.</LD>
<LD>   In polls, about 80% of airline pilots say they would feel more secure
if they could respond to aggressors with lethal force. Pilots unions have
petitioned the Transportation Department to allow volunteers to be
trained as deputy air marshals and issued semiautomatic pistols.</LD>
<TE>   But airlines are adamantly opposed to providing pilots with firearms,
fearing that flying bullets would damage planes and prompt lawsuits if
passengers were struck unintentionally.</TE>
<TE>   According to their manufacturers, stun guns are effective more than
90% of the time--not enough to satisfy some critics.</TE>
<TE>   Mineta said federal requirements that airlines replace flimsy cockpit
doors with stronger, bulletproof versions should virtually eliminate the
chances a pilot would have to resort to any weapon.</TE>
<TE>   The new doors will replace temporary metal bars installed after the
Sept. 11 attacks. The cockpit is now required to be locked during flight.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have done is make the whole cockpit more secure, which means
there is minimal need" for weapons, Mineta said in the interview this
week.</TE>
<TE>   He added that he opposes a request by the flight attendants union to
make stun guns available to its members in the passenger cabin.</TE>
<TE>   "Having a stun gun get into the wrong hands in the cabin environment
is a real potential, and I've got some concerns with that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear whether the Transportation Department would require
airlines to issue stun guns to pilots or merely set guidelines for
training and use and leave the final decision to individual carriers.
Mineta said his comments represent his own position and not a final
decision by the department. Airline officials said a ruling is expected
soon.</TE>
<TE>   Stun guns use a compressed gas charge to fire two small probes
tethered by 20-foot wires to a device that supplies an electric charge.
The dartlike probes can deliver a charge through most clothing, even
leather jackets. Police departments often use stun guns because they do
not cause lasting injury.</TE>
<TE>   "The net effect is that it will incapacitate a person very quickly,
and that person will remain incapacitated until restrained," said Steve
Tuttle, an executive of Taser International of Scottsdale, Ariz. "It
feels like a funny bone going off, but picture that all over your body at
20 times per second. Some people completely lock up." Taser is a brand
name for stun guns.</TE>
<TE>   Stun guns can be purchased without a license in 43 states, including
California, Tuttle said. The most powerful models are sold only to law
enforcement agencies.</TE>
<TE>   United Airlines spokesman Joe Hopkins said the airline has ordered
1,300 Tasers and expects to put two in each cockpit of its 543 planes.
The stun guns would be kept in a locked cabinet and taken out and
holstered within reach of the pilots during flight. The latest Advanced
Taser M26 lists for $399.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't pose a hazard to aircraft," Hopkins said. "We tested them
by shooting them right into the instrument panel, both on the ground and
in flight."</TE>
<TE>   United expects to begin training its pilots and flight attendants this
spring. Hopkins said there might be incidents in which a flight attendant
in the cockpit would have to use a Taser--for example, when one of the
pilots is on a bathroom break.</TE>
<TE>   Tuttle said two foreign airlines carry Tasers aboard for the crew, and
one of them provides the weapons to flight attendants. He would not
identify the carriers.</TE>
<TE>   The only weapon pilots have available to them now is a standard-issue
emergency ax. Last month, a United co-pilot on a Miami-to-Buenos Aires
flight hit an intruder on the head with the flat side of the ax after the
man tried to jam his body through a panel in the cockpit door.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody who wants to take over the cockpit in the future is going to
have to deal with reinforced doors first," Hopkins said. "And after that,
they're going to have to deal with the effects of the Taser."</TE>
<TE>   However, in a very small number of cases, police reports indicate that
suspects shot with Tasers have not been knocked out.</TE>
<TE>   Tuttle said his company's own statistics show that its M26 model is
94% effective.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no such thing as a magic bullet," conceded Tuttle, adding
that sometimes the probes do not make a good connection and other times
the assailant is out of range.</TE>
<TE>   In an aircraft, an attacker would be at close range, Tuttle said.
"He'd be right on top of you in the cockpit."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Tuttle said someone wearing multiple layers of bulky
clothing in the hopes of deflecting a Taser hit "would stick out like a
sore thumb" in the passenger cabin.</TE>
<TE>   But some aviation security experts say a 94% effectiveness rate is not
good enough. A former airline security director, who asked not to be
identified, said he does not have much confidence in stun guns because
would-be criminals can train themselves to resist the jolt.</TE>
<TE>   "If you practice, if you're willing to undergo a couple of hits, it
doesn't bring you down," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tuttle said that was true for some people shot with older-model Tasers
but not with the M26.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the only thing they can put in there that will not damage the
aircraft and will stop a focused person," he said.</TE>

<HD>Vast Ice Fields Suggest Life on Mars Possible</HD>
<DH>Astronomy: Scientists say they are 'blown away' by the Odyssey
spacecraft's findings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just days after starting its science mission, a new spacecraft
orbiting Mars has struck pay dirt, detecting vast fields of ice that
scientists say provide evidence of sufficient water to make it possible
for the planet to have harbored life.</LD>
<LD>   The discovery is a coup for NASA, whose leaders are using a "follow
the water" strategy to understand the evolution of Mars and look for
signs of past and present life there. The presence of water would also be
key to any future attempt to have astronauts explore the Martian surface.</LD>
<LD>   "Water is vital to life. Water has changed the surface of Mars in the
past. And water is essential to the future exploration of Mars," R.
Stephen Saunders, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's project scientist for
the Odyssey orbiter, said at a news conference Friday in Pasadena to
release the findings.</LD>
<TE>   Results from planetary missions often take months, if not years, to be
collected, analyzed and released to the public. The new results are
unusual because they come so early in the mission, "from the first few
days, in some cases the first few hours, of exploration," Saunders said.</TE>
<TE>   The normally cautious scientists were able to make strong conclusions
so quickly because "we really have a whopping large signal," said William
Boynton, a planetary scientist from the University of Arizona who directs
the instrument that detected the ice. "It really just blew us away when
we looked at it."</TE>
<TE>   Boynton's team used a gamma ray spectrometer to probe the chemistry of
the Martian surface. The instrument can detect the chemical constituents
on the surface, including the hydrogen atoms contained in water
molecules, by analyzing the unique gamma ray signatures emitted by each
element.</TE>
<TE>   The instrument has been called a "virtual shovel" because it can read
signals from underground, in the shallow surface layers of Mars.</TE>
<TE>   "The signal we're getting is loud and clear. There's lots of ice on
Mars," Boynton said. "We're not just looking at surface frost. It's a
fair amount of ice."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have long known that Mars had some water. But until now,
there were not enough data to tell whether water was found only in a few
isolated places or was widespread on the planet's surface. The wider the
distribution of water, the more chance there may have been for life to
develop on the planet, scientists believe.</TE>
<TE>   The ice was found on the southern hemisphere of the planet, where it
is now approaching fall. Scientists know the water is frozen, Boynton
said, because of temperature readings showing "it's just too darn cold
for it to be liquid."</TE>
<TE>   Boynton could not say how much ice is there. The findings are so new
that his team had not yet done the complex calculations necessary to make
such an estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Odyssey, the first spacecraft to reach Mars since two Mars missions
failed in 1999, will enable scientists to conduct the first chemical
analysis of the entire Martian surface and map the surface with great
detail.</TE>
<TE>   The instrument doing much of this work is a thermal emission camera
called Themis that takes regular images of the surface during the day and
infrared images at night.</TE>
<TE>   Thermal images show temperature differences on the surface: Rocks that
have been heated by the sun look bright while cold rocks in shadow or
under dust look dark.</TE>
<TE>   The images are "the equivalent of super night-vision goggles," said
NASA project scientist Michael Meyer. The new images are the first taken
of the Red Planet at night.</TE>
<TE>   While night-vision images taken on Earth are often muddy and grainy,
the new Themis images are so crisp and clear they surprised Philip
Christensen, a planetary scientist from Arizona State University who
leads the team operating the camera system.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no idea what to expect," he said. "Mars turns out to have
remarkable variability," he added. "We see craters. We see mesas. We see
rocky places."</TE>
<TE>Entire Surface to Be Mapped</TE>
<TE>   Images taken in the first six hours of the mission are already
yielding some insight into Martian geology and provide clues to which
areas might be most likely to harbor signs of life and which would be
best to avoid.</TE>
<TE>   The images show that rocks ejected out of the centers of craters
remain warmer than crater bottoms and that some of the sinuous channels
crossing Mars are much colder than the surface--filled with cold dust
about 150 degrees below zero.</TE>
<TE>   A different camera that has been orbiting Mars for several years
aboard a spacecraft called the Mars Global Surveyor takes daylight
pictures of small patches of Mars at very high resolution. The new camera
takes lower resolution pictures that cover large swaths of the surface
and can be used to create a detailed map of geological features across
the entire surface of the planet.</TE>
<TE>   Such details, NASA officials said, will help pinpoint the safest and
most geologically interesting places to land robotic vehicles on Mars in
future missions.</TE>
<TE>   Things are not going as well for the orbiter's third instrument, the
Martian Radiation Environment Experiment known as "Marie." These sensors,
built to measure radiation that could harm future astronauts traveling to
Mars, stopped communicating in August.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Odyssey has settled into orbit, engineers will begin
trouble-shooting the instrument and attempt to repair it, said Frank
Cucinotta, who is leading the experiment from the Johnson Space Center in
Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Measurements made before the instrument failed, he said, suggest that
astronauts traveling to Mars would experience twice as much radiation as
those working in the international space station.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists said the images released Friday are just the beginning of a
flood of information that will unveil the basic geology and chemistry of
Mars. "Our odyssey," said Saunders, "has just begun."</TE>
<TE>   It's about time for Boynton, who was heartbroken in 1993 when a gamma
ray instrument he'd worked on for years was lost along with the
spacecraft carrying it toward Mars.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of feel I've been on my own odyssey for 16 years trying to
make this happen," he said.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Sweep of Refugee Camps Goes On</HD>
<DH>Mideast: As death toll climbs, army offers no details of success in

<DL>BALATA REFUGEE CAMP, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Israeli troops with sniffer dogs crept along narrow concrete
alleys, climbed through windows and scaled balconies in this crowded
Palestinian shantytown Friday but largely came up empty in their hunt for
terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   Apprehensive Palestinian women and children, left behind by men who
had escaped the dragnet, peered from doorways and cleaned up the mess
after the soldiers moved on to the next home.</LD>
<LD>   "They asked me where my sons were," Alia Jaffer, 55, said shortly
after the soldiers left her apartment. "They asked me for our weapons. I
told them, 'Let your dogs find our weapons.' "</LD>
<TE>   On the second day of a major assault on two refugee camps, Israeli
forces pushed deeper into Balata, in the West Bank city of Nablus, and
did deadly battle with Palestinian fighters in the Jenin camp, about 25
miles to the north. One Israeli soldier and seven Palestinians--several
gunmen, an Islamic militant and one 10-year-old girl--were killed, taking
the two-day death toll to 22. By late in the day, the number of wounded
was about 200.</TE>
<TE>   The operations--which Israel says are designed to capture Palestinian
militants who have attacked Israelis--were widely condemned by Israeli
commentators as overly risky and ineffective. Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon's political support sank to a new low, dragged down by a bloody
conflict now in its 18th month that he has failed to stop.</TE>
<TE>   For Palestinians, this cramped and miserable camp where refugees have
lived for the last 52 years has been an enduring symbol of resistance and
a crucible for almost every major Palestinian uprising, including the
first intifada against Israel in 1987-93. Its residents have never heeded
outside authority--not the Jordanians, the Israelis or Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat, even though his Fatah movement enjoys
wide support here.</TE>
<TE>   Balata is also an urban warrior's nightmare: Some passageways are so
narrow that a donkey cart cannot squeeze through, much less an armored
vehicle. Soldiers must walk single file. Jagged corners hide any number
of snipers. More than 20,000 people live, practically on top of one
another, in less than half a square mile.</TE>
<TE>   Hussam Khader, an outspoken Palestinian legislator from Balata and an
influential leader in Nablus, said Sharon deliberately targeted Balata to
send a message to all Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   If Sharon breaks Balata, "he breaks a major pillar in the Palestinian
struggle," Khader said. "For that reason, we insist on making his mission
fail."</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army said that Balata and Jenin were invaded because they
have become hotbeds of terrorism. Many of the suicide bombers or
ambushing gunmen who have attacked Israelis in the past 1 1/2 years came
from, received shelter in or were equipped with material produced at the
camps.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make it crystal clear: No place is beyond our reach," Brig
Gen. Gershon Yitzhak, the top commander of Israeli troops in the West
Bank, said Friday. "No place will be safe for terrorists and those who
send them."</TE>
<TE>   Yitzhak said that "a number" of men wanted for questioning had been
detained in the raids and that dozens of bombs, mines and other weapons
had been seized. But neither he nor the army would provide further
details, and it didn't appear that any militia leaders had been captured.</TE>
<TE>   In Balata, most of the Palestinian gunmen who initially fought Israeli
forces during the raid had apparently slipped out of the camp overnight
and into Nablus proper. Many could be seen milling about outside Nablus'
main hospital Friday afternoon, their Kalashnikov assault rifles slung
across their backs.</TE>
<TE>   Khader said 63 militiamen whom the Palestinians believe Israel was
especially eager to capture were spirited out of the camp in the early
hours of the incursion.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Friday, sniper fire and periodic explosions rattled the
squat buildings and nervous residents of the Balata camp. It was not
clear whether the blasts came from Israeli charges used to enter
buildings or from land mines or other explosive devices left behind by
Palestinian fighters.</TE>
<TE>   On Jerusalem Road, the main thoroughfare into Balata and also into
Nablus, Israeli armored bulldozers had dug a trench across all four
lanes, rendering the road impassable. At the start of the incursion,
Israeli forces cut electricity and water to the camp. An army spokeswoman
said the water was accidentally cut when a bulldozer plowed through a
water main. She said it would be repaired.</TE>
<TE>   To carry out its house-to-house search, the army punched holes in
walls, allowing passage from structure to structure without exposure to
enemy fire. In some houses, soldiers entered through the windows. In most
cases, they herded the occupants into single rooms while conducting the
search, residents said.</TE>
<TE>   Balata resident Haya Sherat said soldiers came through the window of
an empty bedroom of the home she shares with her extended family. It was
about 11 a.m. Friday. The soldiers put Sherat, two sisters-in-law and
five children in one room, searched the rest of the house with dogs for
about half an hour, then left, she said. Two doors looked as if they had
been kicked in, and the refrigerator was broken; otherwise, no major
damage was evident.</TE>
<TE>   As they advanced, the soldiers strung up white plastic ribbon to mark
the path they took.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Bassem abu Mustafa walked out of the camp with his
7-month-old daughter, Iber. Feverish, she needed a doctor. Her father
made a run for it when clashes tapered off in the morning, after a
sleepless night.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't tell where the shooting comes from--they're on top, behind,
all around," Mustafa said, Iber in his arms. "The soldiers are not trying
to destroy the houses. They are just trying to scare everybody."</TE>
<TE>   The fiercest fighting of the day was in Jenin. About 250 armed men
were reported trapped by Israeli armor and sharpshooters. Tanks ringed
the camp, which is home to about 12,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday evening, Palestinian gunmen fired on a Jewish neighborhood
on Jerusalem's outskirts, lightly wounding three people. Militias loyal
to Arafat have threatened broad retaliation for the Balata and Jenin
incursions, a new threshold in the raging conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Amid criticism of the raids from the United Nations and Europe,
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said lives would be saved because
of them.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an attempt to dismantle the bombs before they cause great
damage," Peres told Army Radio.</TE>
<TE>   If Sharon had hoped that the operations would boost the morale of an
Israeli public stunned by recent military losses, the opposite was
happening Friday. Commentators were scathing in their criticism of the
offensive.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be either stoned or a gambler to put the army into
[Balata] at this point," military affairs commentator Alex Fishman wrote
on the front page of Israel's largest daily newspaper, Yediot Aharonot.
"What's worse, this decision indicates that [Sharon] has completely given
up on the possibility that we will reach some kind of agreement with the
Palestinians, one that would not include violence, in the near future."</TE>
<TE>   In a poll published Friday, support for Sharon had plummeted to its
lowest level since he took office nearly a year ago. Sharon has been
given high marks for almost his entire term. But Friday's poll for the
Maariv newspaper indicated that a majority of the Israeli public--53%--is
dissatisfied with the prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   A wide margin, 73%, said Sharon has failed to deliver on his promises,
and 68% said the country is worse off than when he took office.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon won election by a landslide on a promise to make Israelis,
already battered by escalating violence, feel safe again. He has launched
an increasingly aggressive campaign of military strikes and economic
punishment against the Palestinians. But instead of being subdued, the
Palestinians have ratcheted up their retaliation, including suicide
bombings.</TE>

<HD>Brazilians Battle Dengue Outbreak</HD>
<DH>Health: Rains and cuts in a disease-prevention program have helped
spread the mosquito-borne illness.</DH>

<LD>At least 23 people have died and tens of thousands have become ill
in the worst outbreak of dengue fever in Rio de Janeiro in a decade. The
epidemic is slowly spreading to other Brazilian cities and has even
infected the nation's presidential race.</LD>
<LD>   Heavy rains and layoffs in Rio's dengue prevention program have helped
spread the mosquito-borne illness, which had been wiped out in Brazil
just a generation ago. By last summer, dengue was in nearly every corner
of Rio, from its poor favelas to chi-chi beach communities.</LD>
<LD>   "We are in a state of emergency," said Flavio Souza, a doctor at
Lourenco Jorge Municipal Hospital, where dengue patients have formed long
lines outside the emergency room.</LD>
<TE>   "It's so painful, your head seems to explode," Francisco do Nacimento
said as he waited in line. Three other members of Nacimento's family also
came down with the illness this week. "Your body aches and shakes with
high fever. I haven't be able to work for 10 days."</TE>
<TE>   The epidemic has become a cultural phenomenon too, with samba songs
written about dengue and one soap opera working dengue into its story
line after several cast members fell ill. Giant mosquitoes appeared on
floats in this year's Carnaval parade.</TE>
<TE>   Employers in Rio de Janeiro have temporarily lost about 10% of their
work force to the illness, according to a study by a local federation of
industrialists. Some companies have seen half their workers call in sick.
Health officials say the actual number of dengue cases may be four times
the official figure of 51,963 because many of those afflicted don't
report the disease.</TE>
<TE>   Dengue is usually not fatal, although its symptoms include high
fevers, fatigue, lack of appetite and severe muscle and joint pain--it is
also known as "breakbone fever." People who are repeatedly exposed can
develop a more serious variant called dengue hemorrhagic fever, which
causes internal bleeding and can be fatal.</TE>
<TE>   The outbreak has led to a shortage at Rio blood banks, with requests
for blood up by about 2000%, said Luiz Amroim of Hemo-Rio, one of the
facilities. "If the number of donors does not increase quickly, we will
not have enough blood to cover the demand," Amroim said.</TE>
<TE>   There are no vaccinations for dengue. Most people are told to rest and
drink plenty of liquids until the symptoms pass, usually after a week.</TE>
<TE>   The epidemic has reached Sao Paulo, where the mayor last week declared
a "D-day" against the mosquito. Health workers fanned out across South
America's largest city, passing out bags of sand to fill the dishes that
collect water under flowerpots, a common breeding area for the insect.</TE>
<TE>   In Rio de Janeiro, 7,000 firefighters will join about 1,300 soldiers
in the dengue fight this month. The city government has announced plans
to use helicopters and crop-dusters to spray insecticide in the worst-hit
areas.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Rio health officials expect that the epidemic will only worsen
in March, when the rains return.</TE>
<TE>   The epidemic may have already claimed its first political casualty.
Jose Serra, a member of the ruling Brazilian Social Democratic Party, has
earned the nickname "presidengue"--he was health minister until resigning
last week to run for president.</TE>

<HD>A British Royal's Gaffe in Australia</HD>
<DH>Media: Newspapers chide Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth's husband,
for insensitive comment to Aborigine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>No one would ever accuse him of political correctness. In his long
career as Queen Elizabeth II's consort, the duke of Edinburgh has
mastered the princely gaffe with ill-considered remarks about Indians,
Scots, women and deaf people, among others.</LD>
<LD>   The tongue that spares none struck again Friday. During a tour of
Australia to mark his wife's Golden Jubilee, Prince Philip added
Aborigines to his verbal hit list when he asked a tribal leader, "Do you
still throw spears at each other?"</LD>
<LD>   William Brim, the entrepreneur whom the prince addressed, replied
politely that, no, they didn't do that anymore, and he told reporters in
Queensland, Australia, that he was more surprised than offended by the
question.</LD>
<TE>   But it is just the sort of off-the-cuff remark that Britons have come
to expect of his royal highness on diplomatic missions.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, Philip!" the Evening Standard newspaper's front-page headline
said in the tone of a dog trainer scolding a puppy for soiling the carpet
again.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say that Philip, 80, is disaster-prone on official duties or
that he suffers from "foot-in-mouth" disease. Supporters counter that he
is friendly, jocular and just a tease with outdated views.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the prince isn't constitutionally restrained from expressing
opinions other than those of the government, as is the queen.</TE>
<TE>   "The queen has learned that the only safe thing to say to anyone is,
'What do you do?' " historian David Starkey said. "Then if they say, 'I
throw spears,' she says, 'Oh, do you?' But she will never say, 'Do you
throw spears?' "</TE>
<TE>   Philip has "resolutely refused" to adapt to 21st century
sensibilities, Starkey added. "He is openly contemptuous of political
correctness and probably saw this as a joke."</TE>
<TE>   Buckingham Palace said Philip's conversation was a private matter and
refused to comment.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he ever means offense," said Ben Pimlott, a historian
and royal biographer. "In any of the gaffes of the last 55 years, I don't
think there has ever been any suggestion of malice."</TE>
<TE>   But gaffes there have been, with recorded insults dating to the 1960s,
when he offended half the royal subjects by stating categorically that
British women can't cook.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, when he made the remark in 1966, many people around the
world might have agreed that Britons couldn't cook, but they weren't
married to the queen and they didn't tell the press.</TE>
<TE>   During the devastating recession of the 1980s, Philip managed to
appear less than sympathetic with the plight of the commoner when he
said: "Everybody was saying we must have more leisure. Now they are
complaining they are unemployed."</TE>
<TE>   He once asked a driving instructor in Scotland, "How do you keep the
natives off the booze long enough to get them through the test?"</TE>
<TE>   And, during a tour of a car factory in 1999, he famously commented
that an old-fashioned fuse box looked "as if it was put in by an Indian."
Britain has a large Indian population, and India, a former colony, is a
member of the Commonwealth.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to deaf students in Cardiff, Wales, that year, Philip
acknowledged the school's steel band and said: "Deaf? If you are near
there, no wonder you are deaf."</TE>
<TE>   The Evening Standard article noted that Philip's comments in Australia
represented the ignorant and offensive attitudes Aborigines have been
fighting for 200 years.</TE>
<TE>   But when it comes to insults, Philip does not discriminate. Referring
to the love his daughter, Princess Anne, has for horses, he once said,
"If it doesn't fart or eat hay, she is not interested."</TE>

<DL>HAVANA
</DL>
<LD>Cuban police entered the Mexican Embassy early Friday and detained
21 young men who had crashed a stolen bus through the gates two days
earlier and had asked to be taken out of Cuba.</LD>
<LD>   The unarmed, specially trained police took action after Mexico asked
Cuba to remove the men. Authorities in both countries said the men did
not put up any resistance.</LD>
<LD>   Mexican authorities said they believed that the men had no grounds to
fear political persecution. Mexico said the men did not ask for political
asylum and wanted to emigrate for purely economic reasons.</LD>
<TE>   After commandeering a public bus, the men crashed the embassy gates
Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican Ambassador Ricardo Pascoe said the decision to evict the men
was made after they rejected requests by Mexican Foreign Relations
Undersecretary Gustavo Iruegas to leave and after Mexico learned that at
least 13 of the 21 had criminal records.</TE>

<LD>Embryonic stem cell research in Britain moved into high gear when
regulators in London granted the first licenses allowing scientists to
extract the cells from donated spare embryos created through in vitro
fertilization and experiment with them.</LD>
<LD>   Several groups around the world have already started research on
embryonic stem cells, but Britain has the most open laws governing the
controversial field.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors hope to cure or treat hundreds of diseases by extracting stem
cells from embryos and directing them to develop into any type of tissue
needed for transplant.</LD>
<TE>   Britain is also setting up a national stem cell bank, similar to a
blood bank, to store the cells and make them available to researchers.</TE>

<LD>Packages containing a caustic substance disguised as eucalyptus oil

Scotland Yard said.</LD>
<LD>   No injuries were reported, but police issued a warning saying similar

Alberto Fujimori, an official said.</LD>
<LD>   "We have three secret witnesses . . . at least two of them indicate
they were informed [that people were incinerated]," said a spokesman for
the commission investigating Fujimori's top aide, jailed former spy chief
Vladimiro Montesinos. It was not clear whether people were allegedly
burned alive.</LD>
<LD>   Montesinos is being held in a naval base jail awaiting trial on a host

<LD>Scientists at Oxford University said that they had extracted DNA
from a dodo, the flightless bird hunted to extinction on its native
Indian Ocean island of Mauritius in the 17th century.</LD>
<LD>   "The DNA survives," Dr. Alan Cooper of the university's Department of
Zoology told BBC news. "It's very damaged and broken down into tiny
pieces, but little fragments remain."</LD>
<LD>   Cooper took the DNA from the head, leg and foot remains of a dodo
donated to the university's Museum of Natural History in 1683--just two
years after the last dodo sighting.</LD>
<TE>   The research aims to uncover the dodo's family tree and discover its
living relatives. The closest were a kind of pigeon from New Guinea and
the Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean.</TE>

<HD>Vengeance Takes Its Toll After Taliban's Fall in Afghanistan</HD>
<DH>Asia: Deadly ethnic attacks are reportedly driving Pushtun
villagers from the north.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BARGAH, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The killing began at 10 a.m. on the 20th day of the Muslim holy
month of Ramadan. Four hours later, 37 Pushtun villagers had been dragged
from their homes and slain by paramilitary forces from the rival Hazara
ethnic group.</LD>
<LD>   The roving executioners tore away in four-wheel-drive pickups, leaving
no explanation for their pillaging on that day in early December. But
witness accounts as well as similar stories from remote Pushtun villages
strung across Afghanistan's arid northern plains paint a brutal portrait
of ethnically motivated revenge attacks against the group most closely
associated with the fallen Taliban regime.</LD>
<LD>   Since December, Pushtuns have been fleeing their villages across the
north, long the bastion of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. They began
showing up by the thousands in faraway refugee camps on the southeastern
border with Pakistan throughout January and February, according to the
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</LD>
<TE>   An unknown number are simply blending into other villages or major
cities, according to aid workers, U.N. officials and Pushtun villagers
who spoke with The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting reports of 'ethnic cleansing' in the north, where
ethnic Pushtuns are being pushed out" by other ethnic groups, said
Mohammed Adar, senior emergency coordinator for the U.N. refugee agency
in Peshawar, Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Another top U.N. official warned that the problem threatens to
undermine Afghanistan's fragile peace process.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a very systematic practice, which has happened regionwide,
where Pushtuns are being targeted," said the U.N. official, who requested
anonymity. "I hear from people in Kabul that the peace process is fragile
and we have to protect it. But at what cost? If we don't address this, we
are just pruning the branches."</TE>
<TE>   Factional fighting tore Afghanistan apart after the fall of the
Soviet-backed regime in 1992 and paved the way for the Taliban to take
power. Many fear that with the Taliban gone, the truce among ethnically
divided parties whose members worked together to defeat the Taliban is
slowly giving way to the era of cyclical massacres and retribution.</TE>
<TE>   That is especially feared here in Chimtal district, where the minority
Pushtuns had readily allied themselves with the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   There is plenty of bitter history between the Pushtuns and Hazaras.
Thousands of Hazaras, a minority of the Shiite Muslim sect, were wiped
out by the Taliban, who brought a draconian interpretation of the Sunni
Muslim faith into a region dominated by a mix of Uzbeks, Tajiks and
Hazaras.</TE>
<TE>   A pit outside the northern capital, Mazar-i-Sharif, has revealed
hundreds of Hazara bodies, testimony to the Taliban's revenge on them for
the thousands the regime lost in battles for the city in the '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Bargah paid for that brutality with 37 lives, according to villagers
here.</TE>
<TE>   A crowd of men stood outside the baked mud walls of the village this
week, gesturing angrily at the graves of the victims, marked by
traditional flags already torn by the cold desert winds.</TE>
<TE>   "I am from another village, and I was a guest here," Mohammed Ghafur
said. "I buried a lot of people. When the women looked over the walls,
they shot at them. I saw them put a gun in a man's mouth and shoot him."</TE>
<TE>   Inside a home, a woman who goes by the single name Makai held the cap
that her son was wearing when he was killed, its embroidered fabric torn
open where one of the paramilitary soldiers slashed him with a bayonet.
Like many of the women, Makai threw herself between the killers and the
victims. But she could save only one son. Her other son and her husband
were dragged out and shot.</TE>
<TE>   "They shut all the women in one room, and they shot my husband right
outside. And my son they shot in front of the house," Makai said. She
clutched her surviving son, Abdul Bashir, 15, and grabbed at the shirt of
a village elder, acting out the drama. "When they pointed the guns at my
son, I grabbed the commander's collar and said, 'Don't kill him,' " she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Village elder Khan Wulus said about 300 men participated in the
carnage, also taking three cars, two tractors, a motorcycle and six
horses, as well as most of the wheat the villagers had stored. They would
have taken a third tractor, he said, but it wouldn't start.</TE>
<TE>   At first, they demanded guns, but the villagers had already
surrendered their weapons to an Uzbek militia. Wulus held up a
handwritten note from an Uzbek commander.</TE>
<TE>   "These gentle people surrendered their weapons," it read, giving an
Arabic calendar date nearly a month before the massacre.</TE>
<TE>   Villagers said that they fell in with the Taliban when the regime
swept through the north but that they were never politically active.</TE>
<TE>   "During the Taliban, we were ordinary people, taking care of our cows
and crops. We didn't know anything about politics," said Haji Raz
Mohammed, a village elder.</TE>
<TE>   Local Hazara commanders avoid questions about who was responsible for
the Bargah massacre, even as they blame Pushtuns for past atrocities.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, that's right, something happened," said Hazara commander Rajab,
who controls a large swath of Chimtal district. "But when the Taliban
first came, there were 2,000 Hazara families in Chimtal. These Pushtun
people killed about 300 Hazara people and put 500 in jail. They looted
the Hazara people's houses. They looted my house and knocked down the
walls. . . . They killed about 300 people, and we killed maybe 10. We
took cattle from dead people, but it was cattle they had taken from us."</TE>
<TE>   Rajab waved off questions of who was responsible for the December
killings.</TE>
<TE>   "No one knows who did this," he said. "But these people who are living
in Bargah now--in the time of the Taliban, they oppressed people, they
looted houses, and they raped people."</TE>
<TE>   After the attack by the Hazaras, Bargah sought protection from the
predominantly Uzbek militia led by Gen. Rashid Dostum.</TE>
<TE>   The town's neighbors just five miles northeast, in Tagabi, made a
different choice. After an Uzbek militia looted their homes in early
December, they requested protection from the Hazaras.</TE>
<TE>   Such choices have become common, as Pushtuns seek shelter with the
group that appears to be their lesser enemy and the factional leaders vie
for their loyalties--and a larger sphere of influence when the political
lines of Afghanistan are redrawn.</TE>
<TE>   Other Pushtuns simply left, although no aid agency here has tracked
their numbers. Tagabi lost nearly half its 60 Pushtun families, and the
remainder are too afraid to pasture their sheep in distant, rain-fed
grasslands where they say Uzbek bandits prowl.</TE>
<TE>   They've resorted to raising a reliable crop that uses less water in
these times of drought: the opium poppy, once banned by the Taliban.
Villagers showed several acres of the hardy plant, its first leaves
already spread out to the size of a hand.</TE>
<TE>   "If it goes on like this, we'll leave and go to the city, someplace
where we are secure," said Tagabi resident Abdul Ghafar.</TE>
<TE>   But even Mazar-i-Sharif isn't safe for Pushtuns, aid workers say.
Displaced villagers who had set up camp next to another refugee village
in Mazar were attacked as soon as the city fell, according to aid
workers. Many have wandered off to unknown destinies.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as the Taliban fell, people attacked them," said Ahmed Idrees
Rahmani, a deputy field coordinator for the International Rescue
Committee. Most were from Chimtal district, Rahmani said.</TE>
<TE>   "After the fall, the whole population became suspect," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Out in these desert villages, residents are jittery. In one small
settlement near Bargah, a Hazara militiaman barely in his teens chased a
reporter's vehicle, firing shots at it, while another aimed a
rocket-propelled grenade launcher, forcing the vehicle to stop.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't realize you were Americans," the Hazara militia member
offered apologetically.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation is dangerous around here," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The Pushtuns aren't the only casualties of warlord feuding. Battles
over territory since the fall of the Taliban are claiming victims from
all sides, particularly around Mazar-i-Sharif. But although observers
here write off the urban violence as jousting among political parties
that are at least nominally multiethnic, out in the countryside, the
skirmishes smack of ethnic warfare.</TE>
<TE>   "In Mazar, things happen not just because of local politics but
generational animosity," the U.N. official said. "Sometimes it's money,
and sometimes it's politics. But outside Mazar, it's strictly ethnic."</TE>

<HD>Putin Backs U.S. Involvement in Georgia</HD>
<DH>Caucasus: Officials in the ex-Soviet republic, however, say few
foreign terrorists are in the area identified as harboring Al Qaeda
members.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>The outcry among politicians here about U.S. plans to train and
equip a Georgian anti-terrorist force ended abruptly Friday when Russian
President Vladimir V. Putin declared it "no tragedy."</LD>
<LD>   But as Russian generals and diplomats scrambled to align their
positions with the president, there was obvious tension between the
Russian and Georgian leaders at a meeting of former Soviet states in
Kazakhstan.</LD>
<LD>   The problem, Putin charged, was that Georgia didn't inform Russia of
the U.S. plan. Georgian President Eduard A. Shevardnadze insisted that
the Russians were told.</LD>
<TE>   As part of a $64-million program, 100 to 200 U.S. military advisors
would begin arriving in Georgia in mid-month to train about 1,000 local
soldiers as an anti-terrorist force, a senior U.S. official said in
Moscow. Washington will supply communications equipment, vehicles, light
weapons and ammunition, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. expectation is that Georgia will act to bring its lawless
Pankisi Gorge back under control. The gorge, which U.S. officials fear
has been infiltrated by terrorists, borders the strife-torn Russian
republic of Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Philip Remler, a senior U.S. diplomat in the Georgian
capital, Tbilisi, said that several dozen Afghan fighters had fled to the
Caucasus, many of them to the Pankisi Gorge, and that the fighters
included members of the Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   As Washington broadens its focus in the anti-terrorist campaign,
Georgian and U.S. officials have issued vague, sometimes contradictory
statements on the numbers of foreign terrorists in the gorge, where they
came from and to what extent they overlap with rebels fighting for
Chechen independence.</TE>
<TE>   Although the U.S. exercise in Georgia isn't designed to target Chechen
rebels, the line between Chechen rebels and foreign fighters who have
joined or armed them in recent years is often blurry.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, with Georgia estimating that 1,000 to 1,500 Chechen fighters
are in the gorge, there are fears of casualties among the 14,000
civilians and refugees in the area once the Georgians are strong enough
to mount an anti-terrorist operation there.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia, a weak state plagued by corruption, has struggled to stand on
its own feet since the fall of the Soviet Union, bristling at the
interference of its giant northern neighbor, Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Putin has solidly supported the anti-terrorist campaign. He hasn't
protested the presence of U.S. troops in Central Asia, despite a strong
vein of nationalist sentiment in Russia, which sees Georgia and Central
Asia as spheres of Russian influence.</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting in Kazakhstan on Friday of the leaders of the 12 former
Soviet states that make up the Commonwealth of Independent States, Putin
said that if U.S. involvement was possible in Central Asia, "why not
Georgia?"</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring his nation's military weakness and its reluctance to get
involved in a potentially tough battle with Chechen rebels in the gorge,
Georgian Security Minister Valery Khaburdzania said he hopes that
fighters in the gorge will disappear, averting the need for force.</TE>
<TE>   "We want these illegal formations to simply leave our territory and
not create any problems for us," he said in an interview published Friday
in the Moscow daily Vremya Novostei.</TE>
<TE>   He said that there were a dozen Arabs in the gorge but that not all
were Al Qaeda terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "Even the Americans cannot assert that the dozen Arabs who are in the
Pankisi Gorge are definitely connected with Al Qaeda," Khaburdzania said.</TE>
<TE>   Georgian Defense Ministry spokesman Mirian Kiknadze said there were no
more than two dozen international terrorists in the gorge.</TE>
<TE>   "Since the situation in the gorge is very difficult to control, it is
next to impossible to know for sure how many people exactly there are,"
he said, adding that some might have arrived from Arab countries posing
as businessmen.</TE>
<TE>   "None of them has the word 'terrorist' written on his forehead, and
you cannot possibly detain every single Arab who comes to Georgia on
suspicion of him being a fighter.</TE>
<TE>   "But in any case, the number of international terrorists in the gorge
is insignificant, and their presence there does not affect the overall
situation in the Pankisi Gorge," Kiknadze said.</TE>
<TE>   He said that although the presence of Arab fighters couldn't be ruled
out, it was unlikely that more than a few Afghan fighters were in the
gorge. Police and border guards in neighboring Azerbaijan had detained
some Afghans, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Khaburdzania described the gorge as unattractive to terrorists because
it lacked an escape route.</TE>
<TE>   Not counting Chechens, Georgian officials have twice recently detained
small groups of foreign fighters. They detained five Afghans trying to
escape to Europe several weeks ago in the Black Sea port of Poti. A
Jordanian and a Saudi who allegedly wanted to set up a terrorist network
were detained and deported last year.</TE>
<TE>   Kakha Katsitadze, a Tbilisi-based military analyst, said Afghan
fighters might reach Georgia because pervasive corruption in the former
Soviet states meant that borders were porous. He said he believed that
there were few international terrorists in the gorge but that they were
nonetheless a destabilizing force.</TE>

<HD>A Captive at Mercy of Colombian Rebels</HD>
<DH>Latin America: What started as a reporter's request for an
interview with FARC guerrillas turned into a nerve-racking detention.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUTUTO, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>The subcommander's voice was hard and low, with no room for
argument.</LD>
<LD>   "You must wait with us here as detainees," he said.</LD>
<LD>   With those words, my assistant and I, along with our local guide,
became captives of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia for 24
hours. The FARC took our wallets, notebooks and camera and kept us under
armed guard in a small wooden hut by the side of a broad, slow river in
southern Colombia.</LD>
<TE>   We waited. We worried. And we got the smallest hint of what life must
be like for the hundreds of kidnapping victims held by the FARC in
hide-outs throughout Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   We felt a nearly irrational urge to flee. We anguished for our
families. And we suffered a terrible uncertainty. My assistant, Mauricio
Hoyos, a Colombian, asked one rebel how long until we were free. "Days,
months, maybe years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   We also got an idea of the FARC, a hermetically sealed guerrilla army
that exists mostly in isolation from other leftist rebel movements. The
leader, Manuel Marulanda, rarely grants interviews.</TE>
<TE>   The young rebels who guarded us were well armed, well disciplined but
not particularly well versed in the Marxist-Leninist philosophy that
supposedly underpins the 38-year-old revolution.</TE>
<TE>   But they clearly believed that Colombia's society, with more than 30
million poor, is deeply unjust. It was a conviction written on their
young faces and rough hands, carried with a certainty, like a craftsman
sure of his work.</TE>
<TE>   "One begins to understand that there are differences, and one thinks
one should do something about them," said "Jhony," leader of the small
band of men who guarded us, as he struggled to explain what made him join
the FARC.</TE>
<TE>   We had come to the FARC camp in search of answers. Just downriver,
guerrillas from the 49th Front had shot down a State Department-owned
Huey helicopter returning from a spraying mission. The pilots,
foreign-born contractors of Virginia-based DynCorp, were saved, but five
Colombian police officers were killed in the battle that followed the
rescue.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has given Colombia nearly $2 billion in the last few years,
mostly in the form of drug fumigation planes, helicopters and troop
training to combat drugs. Colombia produces 90% of the cocaine consumed
in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The result has been that the U.S. has inched ever closer to direct
confrontation with the FARC, which relies on drug crops for revenue. The
FARC denies any involvement in drug trafficking, instead saying that it
places a "tax" on farmers of coca, the plant from which cocaine is
derived.</TE>
<TE>   We had sent a fax and e-mail to FARC headquarters, requesting an
interview about the helicopter shoot-down. We received no response but
contracted with a local boat owner who said he frequently took locals to
a FARC site upriver from where the incident took place. The FARC, which
acts as the local authority in areas it controls, handles complaints and
dispenses justice from the spot.</TE>
<TE>Arrival Surprises, Angers Subcommander</TE>
<TE>   When we arrived, it was clear that we had entered a fairly large FARC
encampment, with several hundred rebels at work in the jungle, hacking
down undergrowth with machetes. There was a small house, surrounded by
chickens, and several smaller buildings that appeared to be shelters.</TE>
<TE>   The subcommander was surprised and angered to see us. After a brief
consultation, he came back to give us the news that we were "detainees."
He told us that we were being held for security reasons, because we were
in a conflict zone and because our press credentials had to be checked
out.</TE>
<TE>   But as he called a band of men to take us to a more secure site, he
sent us away with these words: "We are at war here with everyone. The
army. The police. And the gringos," he said, looking at me.</TE>
<TE>   Along with our guide, we were escorted to the abandoned hut that sat
in a clearing surrounded by orange and star fruit trees. Dozens of birds
warbled in the woods. Butterflies fluttered everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   There, the six guards took up positions and commenced to wait. They
did not speak to us, except to answer yes or no. Each wore a camouflage
uniform and had an Israeli-made Galil rifle, a 9-millimeter Beretta and a
vest with grenades and a long knife. Jhony, the leader of the squad, had
a walkie-talkie and a sheet of paper with codes; all sorts of FARC radio
traffic could be heard.</TE>
<TE>   They never mistreated or threatened us, though we were forbidden to
talk at night and had to ask their permission to move around the
clearing. They were always respectful, polite and quick to offer help in
the form of aspirin, water or a spare blanket.</TE>
<TE>   As the night grew dark, one of the rebels, a young man who appeared
about 15, brought out a portable CD player and two small speakers. There,
under the dim light of a quarter moon, they blasted guerrilla songs with
bloody lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   "We killed two captains today. We'll kill four more military officers
soon. Why doesn't the media ever say these things? The government
prohibits them," went one lyric.</TE>
<TE>   Another was called "The Absent One." "Why aren't you home with your
family? Why aren't you enjoying a toast with your friends?" the singer
asked.</TE>
<TE>   After we were served dinner--a simple meal of rice and fried meat--the
guards escorted us into a room in the shack where a black plastic cloth
had been draped, to provide extra shelter. None of us wanted to enter
because of the heat.</TE>
<TE>   "Ask permission from the guard before you do anything," Jhony said.
"Otherwise, I'm not responsible for what happens."</TE>
<TE>   We spent the night stretched out on the wooden floor, fighting off the
mosquitoes and strange yellow flies that covered us with bites. We slept
on and off. The guards would periodically shine a flashlight into our
room to check on us.</TE>
<TE>Worries Grow as the Day Progresses</TE>
<TE>   We were up the next day by about 5 a.m. The day crept along slowly as
I grew increasingly worried about whether the detention would make the
news. That might bring in local authorities, the FBI and who knew who
else, making release more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   The hardest part was the uncertainty. We were not sure until near the
end if they meant to hold us for ransom and, if not, how long it would
take before we were released. Many of the FARC's victims have spent years
in captivity. The group makes millions from ransom every year.</TE>
<TE>   The sun beat down, and the jungle buzzed with insects. As I sat
immobile looking out over the river, I realized with a sudden flash that
I had no idea when I would next lie in a bed, or hold my wife, or see my
young son walk.</TE>
<TE>   I became furious. I wondered whether I should have done things
differently, though I had previously shown up unannounced at FARC sites
without problems.</TE>
<TE>   I thought of Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was
kidnapped and slain in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, I thought of whether my family would get a call from a
stranger telling them that I had been kidnapped. I would have no way to
comfort them. I had no way to comfort myself.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, around 3 p.m., a small motorboat pulled up, and out stepped
the commander of the 49th Front, Hector Ramirez, along with his assistant
and his white toy poodle, Nino.</TE>
<TE>   He talked with his men, then approached us with a smile. He explained
that they had verified our status as journalists and that they would try
to release us by that afternoon, the following day at the latest.</TE>
<TE>   As he walked away, he turned and smiled. "Please excuse the small
inconvenience," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It was like the hand squeezing my heart had suddenly relaxed. We had
been promised freedom. And we knew there was an end.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the day we spent conversing with Jhony and others in his
squad.</TE>
<TE>   One of their biggest points of pride was that FARC soldiers are all
volunteers, receiving only food, shelter and clothing for their service.
Jhony seemed almost disgusted that Colombia's military and right-wing
paramilitary groups receive pay.</TE>
<TE>   "If you get paid, it's like selling your life away," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, at 4:10 p.m., Ramirez arrived to take us downriver. Jhony
stepped up and handed us our gear and wallets, counting out the money to
show that each peso was being returned. Then he shook our hands.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm setting you free now," he said. "Have a good trip."</TE>
<TE>   We roared away down the flat brown river.</TE>
<TE>   Four hours later, Colombian President Andres Pastrana canceled peace
negotiations with the rebels, sending the country once again into all-out
civil war.</TE>

<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>Ruling party militants hurled burning tires and blocked approaches
to a key opposition election rally Friday, forcing organizers to cancel
it just one week before Zimbabwe's presidential election.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities didn't attempt to stop militants from harassing and
assaulting people headed to the rally in Marondera, about 50 miles
southeast of Harare, the capital, said Gift Chimanikire, deputy
secretary-general of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, or
MDC.</LD>
<LD>   Six opposition supporters were reported injured, including a man into
whose back the 10-inch-high letters "MDC" had been carved with a knife.</LD>
<TE>   Zimbabwe has been racked by political violence as President Robert
Mugabe, 78, fights to extend his 22-year rule. His main rival in the
March 9-10 election is MDC candidate Morgan Tsvangirai.</TE>
<TE>   The MDC says more than 100 of its supporters and activists have been
killed since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "What is happening there is completely unacceptable," British Prime
Minister Tony Blair said Friday after arriving in Australia for the

Zimbabwe from the group.</TE>

<HD>Bosnian Serb Eludes NATO Forces in Second Day of Raids</HD>
<DH>Balkans: Peacekeepers say their intelligence indicated that war
crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic was in an area near Montenegro border.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BORJE, Bosnia-Herzegovina
</DL>
<LD>NATO-led peacekeepers searched remote Bosnian villages Friday in a
second day of unsuccessful raids aimed at arresting Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic, who faces war crimes charges before a U.N. tribunal.</LD>
<LD>   "First the helicopters came, and then they came on foot," said Mitar
Bozovic, 57, a farmer in the southeastern Bosnian village of Borje.
"There were a lot of them. At least 20 were around my house."</LD>
<LD>   Bozovic said the soldiers searched his pigsty and a nearby river
canyon but didn't enter his home.</LD>
<TE>   The soldiers' behavior was much less aggressive than it had been in
Thursday's raid, centered on nearby Celebici, Bozovic said. In that first
raid, soldiers used explosives and fired guns to break locks and enter
buildings. But Bozovic predicted that despite the softer touch of
Friday's actions, the raids will backfire on international authorities in
Bosnia-Herzegovina by making Serbs more distrustful of them.</TE>
<TE>   The peacekeeping force, known as the Stabilization Force, or SFOR,
issued a statement that Friday's multinational operation was conducted
"after SFOR received additional intelligence that the indicted war
criminal was still hiding in the area."</TE>
<TE>   Karadzic was indicted in 1995 on genocide and other war crimes charges
during the 1992-95 Bosnian war. He has been in hiding since 1996 and now
tops the tribunal's list of most-wanted suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to keep chasing him," SFOR spokesman Daryl Morrell said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents said raids were conducted Friday in at least two villages,
Borje and Hocevo, which are about two miles from Celebici. At least four
helicopters were used in the search operation, which began before dawn
and lasted until midmorning, residents said.</TE>
<TE>   Late Friday morning, 13 armored personnel carriers descended the main
road from the area, with tense-looking soldiers keeping their fingers on
the triggers of machine guns. Four of the armored vehicles were marked as
carrying medical personnel, an apparent indication that SFOR was prepared
for casualties.</TE>
<TE>   NATO Secretary-General George Robertson, speaking at the alliance's
headquarters in Brussels after Friday's failure to capture Karadzic,
said, "NATO is closing in on him, there is no escape, there is no place
to hide."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson also challenged Karadzic directly, declaring: "One day,
whether it is tomorrow or next week or next month, SFOR will come for
you. The only way the hunt will end is if you hand yourself in. So
surrender now, with some dignity, or justice will be brought to you."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson said Karadzic and others indicted by the war crimes tribunal
at The Hague will face both "high-profile and low-profile" arrest efforts
"in the days and weeks ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Karadzic remains popular among Bosnian Serbs and is believed to have
armed bodyguards. Fears that his arrest could be bloody or trigger
anti-Western violence have often been cited to explain why SFOR hasn't
acted more aggressively to capture him.</TE>
<TE>   But now, Karadzic's continued ability to elude capture is becoming an
increasingly intolerable embarrassment to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, some commentators say.</TE>
<TE>   There has also been speculation that as a defendant before the war
crimes tribunal, Karadzic might become a valuable witness against former
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. The trial of Milosevic on charges
of genocide and crimes against humanity began last month.</TE>
<TE>   Carla del Ponte, the chief prosecutor at the war crimes tribunal, has
in recent months made particularly strong demands that Karadzic be
arrested.</TE>
<TE>   The two raids show that "there's been a hardening of resolve from NATO
members to arrest" war crimes suspects, SFOR spokesman Morrell said.
"There's an increased readiness to go after these people to bring about
reconciliation in Bosnia-Herzegovina."</TE>
<TE>   International authorities have said repeatedly that the arrest and
trial of war crimes suspects would help heal the wounds and inter-ethnic
hatreds left by the war. That in turn could make it easier to further
reduce peacekeeping troops, which now number about 18,000, already down
from a 1996 peak of 60,000.</TE>
<TE>   The area of this week's searches is only a few miles from Bosnia's
border with Montenegro, the smaller republic in Yugoslavia. There has
been speculation that if Karadzic really has been here, he might slip
across to the other side.</TE>
<TE>   This stretch of border has been closed for the last three years to
everyone without a special permit issued by the Yugoslav army in the
Montenegrin capital, Podgorica, several residents said. The Yugoslav army
also patrols the countryside along the border to prevent people from
crossing, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Both the top brass of the Yugoslav army and ordinary soldiers could be
expected to be far more sympathetic to Karadzic than Montenegrin police,
who are controlled by pro-Western Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic
and are usually in charge of border crossings.</TE>
<TE>   This means that Karadzic might have difficulty crossing the border but
that if discovered by the Yugoslav army, he wouldn't necessarily be
captured and turned over to the war crimes tribunal. The proximity of the
border also means that SFOR must be careful not to stray into Yugoslav
territory while searching for Karadzic.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of the raided villages expressed sharp anger Friday against
SFOR.</TE>
<TE>   "People hated them before, but now they hate them even more," said
Slavko Brkovic, 46, a shop owner in Celebici.</TE>
<TE>   The international peacekeepers "hate the Serbs," added his wife,
Tomana. "They provoked us yesterday. I'm very bitter."</TE>
<TE>   Tomana Brkovic said that when Thursday's raid began, she took refuge
with neighbors. SFOR soldiers then broke into her home and the one where
the neighbors had gathered, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers shouted "Hands up!" in Serbian, she said. "That's the
only two words they said. . . . They had masks. Only their eyes were
visible."</TE>
<TE>   The peacekeepers "will see that they did something not good even for
themselves," said Bozovic, the Borje resident. "They've violated our
human rights and our dignity."</TE>
<TE>   Bozovic's anger was focused on the Thursday raid, which included an
armed search of the school attended by his 15-year-old daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "Did they really think Karadzic could be hiding in a shop where people
buy bread?" he said. "Did they think he was hiding in a classroom?"</TE>

<HD>On Trip to Iowa, Bush Mixes Politics, Policy, Fund-Raising</HD>
<DH>Speech: Idea of 'shadow government' is explained. He also voices
support for workers investing part of their Social Security tax.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DES MOINES
</DL>
<LD>In the midst of the American heartland, far from the feared target
of an attack, President Bush said Friday that concerns about a nuclear
strike by terrorists were behind the continuing operation of a "shadow
government" ready to take over if Washington is destroyed.</LD>
<LD>   "Until this country has routed out terrorists wherever they try to
hide, we're not safe," Bush said on a trip to Iowa that mixed policy and
politics.</LD>
<LD>   The administration confirmed Friday that shifting teams of senior
government officials were living and working at two different, secure
locations along the East Coast, ready to take over in the event of a
catastrophic attack on the nation's capital.</LD>
<TE>   The plan was put into place after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on
the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "We take the continuity-of-government issue very seriously because our
nation was under attack," Bush said. "And I still take the threats that
we receive from Al Qaeda killers and terrorists very seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the U.S. efforts to disrupt Al Qaeda, the terrorist network
that had been based in Afghanistan and is run by Osama bin Laden, the
organization's capabilities remain unclear. U.S. officials remain
concerned that Al Qaeda might obtain a portable nuclear weapon, sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence has no specific knowledge that the network has such
a weapon, but the risk was great enough to warrant the activation of the
plan, which dates to the Eisenhower administration, said a senior
government official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>In Support of Private Retirement Accounts</TE>
<TE>   Bush made his comments after he ended a discussion with workers at a
printing company in Des Moines. That meeting and a subsequent speech at
the plant were to draw attention to Bush's proposal in the wake of the
Enron Corp. scandal to protect workers' pensions and other retirement
funds.</TE>
<TE>   He also reiterated his support for plans that would allow Americans to
invest some of their Social Security taxes in personal retirement
accounts, guided by personal financial advisors.</TE>
<TE>   "You ought to be trusted with your own money," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he spoke at a luncheon expected to raise almost $500,000 for
the Iowa Republican Party and the reelection campaign of Rep. Tom Latham,
mixing politics with official business on his fourth visit to the state
as president. Iowa is a key state in the presidential nomination process
and in the general election.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also responded to remarks Thursday by Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.) that focused renewed attention on the failure so far of
U.S. troops to account for Bin Laden and Mullah Mohammed Omar, the
Taliban leader whose forces were routed in the U.S. attacks on
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle had said, "Clearly, we've got to find Mohammed Omar, we've got
to find Osama bin Laden and we've got to find other key leaders of the Al
Qaeda network or we will have failed."</TE>
<TE>   A Daschle spokeswoman later said the senator's remarks should not be
construed as critical of Bush or the anti-terrorism campaign. However,
they gave voice to an undercurrent of questions about the fate of the
terrorist leaders, what threat they continue to pose to the United States
and whether the White House was expanding the military campaign without a
clear explanation of its aims. Comments by other Democrats also have
raised questions about the Senate's willingness to support the large
increase in defense spending Bush is seeking.</TE>
<TE>Time on Our Side, Bush Assures Audience</TE>
<TE>   "I think most Americans understand that it's going to take a while to
achieve all our objectives," Bush said. "And by far the vast majority of
Americans are patient. They know when you're looking for one person, who
may be hiding in a cave, it may take a while.</TE>
<TE>   "But what Osama bin Laden's got to understand . . . [is] that this
patient and determined nation is going to hunt him down. He can't hide
long."</TE>
<TE>   Daschle's remarks earned him rebukes from congressional Republicans,
who suggested that such comments could undermine the U.S. war effort.</TE>
<TE>   Asked Friday about the GOP reaction, Daschle said, "I think the
Republicans' reaction is nothing short of hysterical. I'm amused,
frankly. . . . The Congress has a constitutional responsibility to ask
questions. We are not a rubber stamp to this president or to anybody
else."</TE>
<TE>   Under the shadow government plan Bush discussed, 75 to 150 senior
government officials, drawn from every Cabinet department and some
independent agencies, work in secret out of two fortified locations.</TE>
<TE>   They rotate in and out of the facilities, prohibited from telling
anybody where they are or why. Friends, family and co-workers can reach
them through a toll-free number and personal extensions.</TE>
<TE>   A variation of the plan was first devised at the height of the Cold
War under President Eisenhower nearly half a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said his administration activated the new version of the plan to
ensure that "should somebody be successful in attacking Washington, D.C.,
there's an ongoing government."</TE>
<TE>   That, he said, was one of the reasons Vice President Dick Cheney
periodically has been sent to secure, undisclosed locations since the
Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "This is serious business, and we take it seriously," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   He said that, as a result of the precautions taken after Sept. 11,
"we've made America a tougher place to attack than before.</TE>
<TE>   "It is much harder for somebody to get on an airplane to attack again.
We've got better intelligence-gathering. We're doing everything in our
power to protect the American people."</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM GUANTANAMO BAY</KH>
<HD>Uncertainties Vex Detainees, U.S.</HD>
<DH>Law: As the government weighs their fate, the prisoners are in
legal limbo, not knowing if they will face a military tribunal or be sent
home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba
</DL>
<LD>In addition to banana rats, tarantulas and scorpions, this outpost
is home to 3-foot-long iguanas, a protected species. It is also home to
300 increasingly angry prisoners of the war in Afghanistan whose status
is far less defined, and that, admit U.S. military officials who are in
charge of this makeshift prison, is becoming a problem.</LD>
<LD>   In unprecedented legal limbo as the U.S. government figures out what
to do with them, they fully expect to be tortured or worse and have no
idea whether they will be tried and executed--or simply sent home.</LD>
<LD>   Prison officials say those tensions underlie the hunger strike that
erupted this week after a guard stripped a prisoner of the turban he had
fashioned from a bedsheet, in violation of camp rules.</LD>
<TE>   The protest lost steam after camp officials agreed to change their
rules to permit detainees to wear turbans and to let them have more
books. By Friday, the hunger strike had dwindled to about 75 prisoners
who continued to refuse to eat.</TE>
<TE>   But meals or not, nobody here or in Washington yet knows whether the
detainees from 32 countries will be going home or to trial. Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said last week that interrogators are only
now beginning to weigh which prisoners might face military tribunals and
where.</TE>
<TE>   The uncertainty promises to keep "Camp X-Ray" a very taut place for
the foreseeable future.</TE>
<TE>Work Starts on Prisoner Housing</TE>
<TE>   As if to underscore how open-ended their stay here is, soldiers this
week began clearing scrubland for construction of more permanent special
wire-mesh modules to house the detainees in what officials said will hold
up to 408 prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   But those units are two months from being ready, and Brig. Gen.
Michael R. Lehnert, the task force commander, said the new construction
does not include courtrooms. He added that, "I haven't been told anything
about tribunals."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, this narrow slit of land and water, 45 acres that the
United States rents from Cuba, has been transformed into a growing,
sprawling, self-inventing prison. The first 20 prisoners arrived Jan. 11;
today there is room for just 20 more in the temporary wire cages. More
than 200 prisoners are still being held in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The prison camp is nestled in a far-back portion of the military base,
surrounded by barbed wire and hills and eight wooden guard towers. The
new housing will come with an ocean view.</TE>
<TE>   The prisoners' "job" is to be interrogated. Often they are escorted to
an interview room inside the compound, where military and Justice
Department investigators seek answers of their own. They want to
determine the true identities of these men--mostly former soldiers in
their 20s and 30s--and what they can tell them about war crimes and
possible plans for further terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   It is not always easy; many of them have been interviewed three and
four times, giving a different name each time.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes the information we get does not seem to be of initial
value," Lehnert said. "But when it is matched with what we are hearing
all over the world, it can increase in value."</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, "some of the detainees have not told us the truth yet,
and they don't intend to."</TE>
<TE>   They speak to one another through the wire separating their cages, and
guards can make out that there are leaders emerging among the detainees.</TE>
<TE>   But, said Army Col. Terry L. Carrico, the warden, "they can plan just
about anything they want. I have no fear of escape."</TE>
<TE>They Spend Their Days Praying and Waiting</TE>
<TE>   Other than the interrogations or, this week, the hunger protest, the
prisoners' lives are largely mundane. They wear bright orange jumpsuits
and white prayer caps--all easily seen by the heavily armed guards around
the prison.</TE>
<TE>   They sit and squat and stand in their 8-by-8-foot cells; for hours on
end they simply wait. Guards here say that the prisoners arrive fearing
they will be tortured.</TE>
<TE>   They read their Korans. Most of them pray five times a day when a
Muslim religious service is conducted over loudspeakers by a Navy Muslim
chaplain, Lt. Abuhena Mohammad Saiful-Silam of Camp Pendleton, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   When each day is over, they sleep on thin mattresses rolled out on the
concrete slab that is their jail cell floor. They cover themselves with
two white blankets.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Washington have dubbed them "the baddest of the bad," but
those who guard them have so far found them relatively harmless--or at
least powerless under the heavy security. One threw a shampoo bottle at a
guard, another tried to bite a military policemen--nothing outrageous,
the guards say.</TE>
<TE>   The detainees are allowed two white buckets in their cells, one for
drinking, the other a latrine. Their every movement is visible, hence the
name Camp X-Ray.</TE>
<TE>   Even the sniper guards manning the towers follow them from above,
whenever a pair of guards escorts each inmate to a portable toilet or a
shower.</TE>
<TE>   For occasional recreation they are moved to an open space, also
confined by see-through wire. There they can stretch their legs or try to
jog a little, perhaps, but that is not easy with their hands cuffed to
chains around their waist and their feet in rubber flip-flops.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-five prisoners have needed treatment at the camp hospital, most
for war wounds or infections from wounds. One suffered tuberculosis,
another had a lesion removed from his lower back, one required thoracic
surgery, another neurosurgery. Two legs have been amputated and one eye
removed.</TE>
<TE>   Another detainee was told he should have his eye removed too. But Navy
Cmdr. James Gallagher, an eye specialist, said the prisoner refused.</TE>
<TE>   "He was shot through the forehead with shrapnel and it ruptured the
back of his eye. He has a totally retarded retina, and he is blind in
that eye."</TE>
<TE>   Like other troops assigned to this hard duty, Marine Capt. Robert
Patterson, from St. Helena, Calif., who oversees the tower guards, does
his job by trying to balance his outrage at what the terrorists did Sept.
11:</TE>
<TE>   "I view them and what they have allegedly done to our country and
realize there are some bad people in here. Some are truly evil people.
But they are human beings too."</TE>
<TE>   The American guards at first slept on the ground like their charges
but now have built a dozen tents on a rise near Camp X-Ray. They call it
Freedom Heights. They have TV and radio, and now they sleep on cots.</TE>
<TE>   Saiful-Silam, the chaplain, ministers to those who practice Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to know when something is going to happen to them," he
said. "The main thing they want to know is how soon their cases will be
resolved."</TE>
<TE>   He said they have no concept of what is happening in the outside
world, no radio or newspaper, and they are hungry for news from home.
They often send mail out. But rarely do any letters arrive for them.</TE>

<HD>Glitch Threatens to Cut Short Shuttle Mission</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>The space shuttle Columbia blasted into orbit for the first time in
more than two years Friday, and a cooling system problem immediately
raised concerns the mission to the Hubble Space Telescope might have to
be shortened.</LD>
<LD>   Shuttle program manager Ron Dittemore said he was optimistic that the
11-day mission was on track but said engineers would spend the next 24
hours analyzing the problem in one of two critical coolant loops for the
payload bay doors.</LD>
<LD>   If it is considered serious enough, the shuttle may be called back.
Dittemore stressed that the seven astronauts were safe and the shuttle's
cooling system was stable.</LD>
<TE>   "This analysis, we firmly believe, will conclude that we are safe to
continue the mission for the full duration," he said. "However, we just
need the time to make sure that we dot all the I's and cross all the T's
to be positive about that conclusion."</TE>
<TE>   Mission managers will meet again this afternoon to discuss the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Barring a change in schedule, the shuttle and its repair team should
catch up to the telescope Sunday. Five grueling days of spacewalking will
follow to replace faltering parts and install a new camera that will
boost Hubble's discovery capability tenfold.</TE>
<TE>   With Hubble soaring nearly overhead at an altitude of more than 350
miles, Columbia lifted off before dawn amid the high security that has
become typical since Sept. 11. It was a balmy 60 degrees, considerably
warmer than the previous morning, when near-freezing temperatures forced
a one-day delay.</TE>
<TE>   It was Columbia's debut following a 2 1/2-year overhaul even more
extensive than the one awaiting Hubble. NASA's oldest shuttle was taken
apart, checked for damaged wiring and modernized following its last
launch, which was marred by a frightening short-circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Columbia arrived in orbit, a reduced flow of Freon was
detected in the coolant loop for the radiators on the payload bay's left
door. It appeared the loop was blocked by debris.</TE>
<TE>   A team of engineers formed to investigate the problem determined that
the radiators were still dispelling heat from various shuttle systems,
and the coolant loop for the right door was working fine.</TE>
<TE>   "It started out looking a little gloomy and it's looking a lot more
optimistic," Dittemore said.</TE>
<TE>   Astronauts have conducted five spacewalks on previous Hubble repair
missions, including the first in 1993 to correct the telescope's blurred
vision. But each of next week's spacewalks is packed with even more work
and every bit of it is critical, making this the most complicated service
mission yet.</TE>

<HD>Senators Edge Closer to a Compromise on Election Reform Bill</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Democrats fail to end the GOP filibuster but agree to
accept a key part of the Republicans' proposal to curb voter fraud.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Senate Democratic leaders on Friday failed to force final action on
a bill to overhaul voting systems nationwide, but lawmakers close to the
issue said they were nonetheless on the verge of a deal that could lead
to bipartisan passage of the measure next week.</LD>
<LD>   The bill has been stalled over a Republican proposal to require
first-time voters to prove their identity if they have registered by
mail, a measure aimed at reducing voter fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Leading Democrats, who have complained that the anti-fraud measure
would discriminate against elderly, poor and minority voters, now say
they would accede to the main thrust of the GOP proposal in hopes of
moving the legislation forward.</LD>
<TE>   The Democrats announced their desire for compromise after failing to
stop a Republican filibuster. In a 49 to 39 tally, Democrats fell 11
votes short of the 60 votes needed to cut off debate.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second time this week that the two parties have bogged down
on legislation that had appeared to be on a fast track toward approval.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated by the impasse, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.)
warned Friday that if the Senate cannot finish the issue by Tuesday, he
will turn to other matters and "assume Republicans have killed the bill
for good."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans said they are not to blame.</TE>
<TE>   "We want election reform," said Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott
(R-Miss.). "We want fair elections, where people can vote, and we also
want honest elections."</TE>
<TE>   At stake is a bill that would distribute $3.5 billion over five years
to help state and local election officials upgrade antiquated voting
systems, a problem highlighted in Florida and elsewhere during the 2000
election controversy.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also would establish minimum standards for voting systems,
install safeguards to help ensure voters cast valid ballots and require
states to maintain statewide registration lists.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP's anti-fraud proposal, pushed by Sen. Christopher S. Bond
(R-Mo.), would require voters who registered by mail and are casting
their first ballot to show a photo identification or another document,
such as a utility bill, to prove they are who they say they are.</TE>
<TE>   Many civil rights groups have criticized the proposal as a potential
obstacle to voting for people who fail to carry an acceptable ID card or
document to their polling place. They supported a counterproposal by
Sens. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) to allow states
to verify identity by checking voter signatures.</TE>
<TE>   But Bond stood firm, and nearly all Republicans backed him.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Schumer and Wyden dropped their amendment but said they
would insist on an exception to the anti-fraud provision for Washington
and Oregon. In those states, most voters cast ballots by mail.</TE>
<TE>   Wyden and other senators from those states--including Republican
Gordon Smith of Oregon--fear Bond's proposal would hinder the popular
vote-by-mail programs. (About a quarter of California's electorate now
casts absentee ballots.)</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), the bill's chief sponsor,
expressed hope that such issues would be resolved by Monday. Negotiators,
he said, were hammering out a final draft. "It's down to a couple words
here and there."</TE>
<TE>   If the Senate passes the bill, the next step would be a conference to
reconcile differences with the House. The House passed its own version of
the bill in December.</TE>

<DL>SEATTLE
</DL>
<LD>For weeks now, an orphan killer whale has been hanging around
central Puget Sound--about 250 miles from her only known family member in
Canada--and experts are worried she might not survive.</LD>
<LD>   There's not much for her to eat, and scientists and whale advocates
are concerned about the calf's health.</LD>
<LD>   The National Marine Fisheries Service convened a panel of experts to
discuss what to do.</LD>
<TE>   The options: Let nature take its course, catch her in a net pen or try
to take her to her family off British Columbia's Vancouver Island or to a
commercial site such as Sea World.</TE>
<TE>   An NMFS spokesman said a decision is expected next week.</TE>
<TE>   The orphan, born in 2000, is called A73 for her birth order in
Canada's A-pod.</TE>
<TE>   According to Canadian researchers, her mother, A45, is dead. The calf
was apparently left behind by her pod, where her only known relative was
a grandmother.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Rev. Billy Graham apologized Friday for a 1972 conversation
with former President Nixon in which he said the Jewish "stranglehold" on
the media was ruining the country and must be broken.</LD>
<LD>   The conversation was among 500 hours of Nixon tapes released by the
National Archives. Most were recorded between January and June 1972.</LD>
<LD>   "Although I have no memory of the occasion, I deeply regret comments I
apparently made in an Oval Office conversation with President Nixon . . .
some 30 years ago," Graham said in a written statement released by his
Texas public relations firm. "They do not reflect my views and I
sincerely apologize for any offense caused by the remarks."</LD>
<TE>   In the conversation with Nixon, the Southern Baptist evangelist
expressed disdain for what he saw as Jewish domination of the media.</TE>
<TE>   "This stranglehold has got to be broken or this country's going down
the drain," Graham said, agreeing with Nixon's comments earlier in the
conversation.</TE>
<TE>   "You believe that?" Nixon says in response.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, sir," says Graham.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh boy. So do I," Nixon agrees, then says: "I can't ever say that,
but I believe it."</TE>
<TE>   "No, but if you get elected a second time, then we might be able to do
something," Graham says, reassuring the president.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, Graham said his legacy has been one of working for stronger
bonds between Jews and Christians.</TE>
<TE>   "Throughout my ministry, I have sought to build bridges between Jews
and Christians," Graham said. "I will continue to strongly support all
future efforts to advance understanding and mutual respect between our
communities."</TE>
<TE>   Graham, 83, has been in frail health for years.</TE>
<TE>   The friendship between Graham and Nixon began during the Eisenhower
administration, when Nixon was vice president.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the conversation, when Nixon raises the subject of Jewish
influence in Hollywood and the media, Graham says, "A lot of Jews are
great friends of mine.</TE>
<TE>   "They swarm around me and are friendly to me. Because they know that I
am friendly to Israel and so forth. But they don't know how I really feel
about what they're doing to this country, and I have no power and no way
to handle them," Graham says.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon says: "You must not let them know."</TE>

<HD>Verbal Attacks Mark Texas Debate</HD>
<DH>Primary: Two Latino Democrats square off in Spanish in the
governor's race, bickering over ethnicity and the politics of language.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>Even as they made history in the nation's first Spanish-language
gubernatorial debate Friday night, a pair of tough-talking Mexican
American Democrats couldn't keep from wrangling over ethnic pandering and
the politics of language.</LD>
<LD>   "I believe that we need to recognize that a great majority of the
voters in the state of Texas--and including those who are Hispanic--speak
English," said former state Atty. Gen. Dan Morales, who in a final hour
revision followed each Spanish answer with an English translation.</LD>
<LD>   "I think that he's embarrassed to be Hispanic," borderland oil baron
Tony Sanchez said. "He has never shown the pride that we have to be
Hispanics, and that gets to me."</LD>
<TE>   The Friday debate in Dallas marked the first time candidates for
governor of any state have debated in Spanish. Earlier in the evening,
the two men pontificated in English on taxes, spending and political
icons. In the Spanish debate, the topics shifted to bilingual education,
immigrant rights and school prayer.</TE>
<TE>   It almost didn't happen. The candidates bickered for weeks over when,
where and how often to debate. They were still quarreling on the eve of
the debate when Morales announced a compromise to what he considered an
ethnically divisive meeting: He'd answer the questions in Spanish, then
repeat his answers in English.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an opportunity to make history," Sanchez said. "For Mr.
Morales to go back on his promise is an affront to Texans of every
background."</TE>
<TE>   Linguistically, Sanchez has the upper hand: His Spanish is much
smoother than Morales' faltering utterances. And when he saw his opponent
hesitate, Sanchez was quick to criticize.</TE>
<TE>   About one-third of the voters in the Democratic primary are expected
to be Latino. In the Bush years, Texas was a Republican stronghold, but
analysts say that hold is tenuous. Latinos, who have tended to vote
Democratic, already make up 40% of the registered voters and are the
state's fastest growing ethnicity.</TE>
<TE>   There was a time, not so long ago, when Spanish was doffed at the door
to the middle-class, a necessary trade-off for the upwardly mobile.
Decades ago, Mexican American students were banned from playing football
in many Texas school districts--and pupils were spanked for speaking
Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   "Spanish was the language of the people who lost the land," said
Nestor Rodriguez, co-director of the University of Houston. "This is a
revival not just of the language but of the people. The people who were
here originally are getting back the linguistic right. It's OK to be
Mexican American again, you know?"</TE>
<TE>   These days, even the Anglos are struggling to get in on the act.
Former Gov. George W. Bush brought down many a house with his trademark
grin and clumsy Spanish intonations. Gov. Rick Perry has enrolled in
Spanish classes.</TE>
<TE>   "This state is bilingual," said Frumencio Reyes, vice chairman of the
Texas Democratic Party. "We believe very strongly this debate is not just
good for our folks, for the Hispanic community, but the whole state has a
lot to learn."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps nothing speaks so loudly of the power of Texas Latinos as the
two contenders for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez is a multimillionaire oilman, rancher and Bush supporter whose
ancestors founded the border city of Laredo in the 18th century. Until he
was handpicked by the Democrats, the reclusive Sanchez kept a low profile
on his ranch outside Laredo. He has been pegged with questions about his
past business dealings, which include a savings and loan that collapsed
from faulty lending practices. In 1994, Sanchez paid $1 million to settle
a potential federal claim against him. In Friday's debate, Morales
accused the banker of laundering Mexican drug money.</TE>
<TE>   As for Morales, his days as attorney general were nothing if not
colorful. He made the Republicans angry by hiring a band of trial lawyers
to sue the tobacco industry. At the end of that deal, Texas got $17
billion, the lawyers got $3 billion and the Republicans got good and mad.</TE>
<TE>   Morales alienated his heavily Latino party when he opined that an
order to abandon affirmative action at the University of Texas should be
applied to all state universities. On Friday night, Sanchez called
Morales a "baby of affirmative action."</TE>
<TE>   "That's why he went to Harvard," Sanchez said. "But when he got to the
top he picked up that ladder behind him and left all of those shattered
dreams."</TE>
<TE>   Morales dropped out of politics in 1997, when he married a former
topless dancer from Abilene. In January, Morales rocked the Democratic
Party by filing a last-minute bid for the gubernatorial election,
splitting the Latino vote. "You don't do that to a friend," Reyes said
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The contentious, ethnically charged campaign will culminate March 12,
when the two men square off in a primary. The winner will run for
governor against Republican Perry, a onetime lieutenant governor who
became governor after Bush was elected president.</TE>

<HD>Pediatrician Accused of Stabbing Sons; 1 Dead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHAMPAIGN, Ill.
</DL>
<LD>A pediatrician stabbed her 10-year-old son to death and wounded his
younger brother, then called police to tell them what she had done,
police said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Ellen Feinberg, 43, was charged with murder and attempted murder.
She appeared in court via video camera from a mental health facility, and
a judge ordered her held without bail.</LD>
<LD>   Feinberg called authorities Thursday afternoon and said "she had
killed her children and wanted to be killed by the police," according to
prosecutor Elizabeth Dobson.</LD>
<TE>   The mother told police where they would find her sons and said a knife
was in the kitchen sink, Dobson said. Both boys had been stabbed in the
chest, and Feinberg had blood on her hands, arms and clothes when police
arrived, the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   The older boy, Adam, was pronounced dead at a hospital, and Matthew,
6, was in critical condition Friday.</TE>
<TE>   At the arraignment, Feinberg's attorney Carol Dison presented a report
from a psychiatrist who said Feinberg was unfit to stand trial.</TE>
<TE>   Dison described Feinberg as "unresponsive and uncooperative," and said
the doctor who met with her considered her "acutely suicidal." She said
she intended to raise insanity as a defense if the case goes to trial.</TE>
<TE>   The attack took place in a well-to-do neighborhood of Champaign, about
130 miles south of Chicago. Neighbors said the boys' father is a surgeon.</TE>
<TE>   "They were normal, very nice, the last people you would ever think
would have a tragedy like this," neighbor Alan Parker said. "The kids do
all the normal things kids do."</TE>
<TE>   Police said the mother and two children were the only ones home when
the stabbings occurred.</TE>

<HD>Jury Views Psychiatrist Interview of Yates in Jail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>A videotape of a gaunt Andrea Yates explaining in a monotone why
she drowned her five children stunned the courtroom Friday in dramatic
evidence of the Texas mother's mental condition after the crime.</LD>
<LD>   The tape, recorded in the Harris County Jail three weeks after the
June 20 killings, graphically showed the severity of the former nurse's
mental illness as she stumbled over words and spelled out her twisted
vision of reality.</LD>
<LD>   Yates, wearing an orange jail uniform, is seen with dark circles under
her eyes, stringy hair hanging over hunched shoulders, her rail-thin body
motionless except for the constant clenching of her jaws.</LD>
<TE>   As forensic psychiatrist Phillip Resnick asks questions, there are
long pauses before she answers in terse phrases devoid of emotion.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you love your children?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, not in the right way though," Yates responded.</TE>
<TE>   Resnick asked Yates if what she did was a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably a good thing because I wasn't righteous," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Yates confessed to drowning Noah, 7, John, 5, Paul, 3, Luke, 2, and
Mary, 6 months, in the family bathtub because of delusions that they were
tormented by the devil, but she has pleaded not guilty by reason of
insanity. She could face the death penalty if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   To meet the legal threshold for an insanity defense under Texas law,
Yates must prove she was so mentally ill she could not discern right from
wrong at the time of the killings.</TE>
<TE>   Resnick, who has rendered similar decisions in several notable U.S.
crimes, said Yates was so crazed she thought drowning the children was
the right thing because it would save them from the devil and deliver
them to heaven.</TE>
<TE>   "She did what she thought was right in her perception of the world
through her psychotic eyes," he testified.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors agree that Yates was sick but say she knew the killings
were wrong because she immediately called police to their Houston home.</TE>
<TE>   "Andrea Yates believed society would view her actions as bad because
society didn't know what she knew--that is, that Satan was within her,
that her children were not righteous, that her children would burn in
hell," Resnick said.</TE>
<TE>   The 12 jurors who will decide Yates' fate watched the tape attentively
as it played on a big screen in the wood-paneled courtroom where the
trial has proceeded for two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first visual evidence they have seen of what several mental
health experts have described as one of the worst cases of mental illness
they have treated.</TE>
<TE>   After eight months of anti-psychotic drug therapy in jail, Yates
appears subdued but relatively normal.</TE>
<TE>   In the interview, Yates said she had been a bad mother and that her
children were not "developing right in an academic sense and a righteous
sense."</TE>

<HD>Church to Provide Abuse Victims' Names</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>Under pressure from prosecutors, the Archdiocese of Boston agreed
Friday to turn over the names of people allegedly molested by priests and
details of the incidents.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement--reached amid a child molestation scandal that has
rocked the nation's Roman Catholic Church--moves prosecutors a step
closer to bringing criminal charges, at least in cases where the statute
of limitations has not run out.</LD>
<LD>   In the last month, the archdiocese has given prosecutors the names of
80 priests suspected of abusing children over the last four decades. But
the information did not include dates, places or victims' names,
prompting complaints from prosecutors who said they need the information
to investigate.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday the church relented, reportedly after Massachusetts Atty.
Gen. Thomas Reilly threatened the archdiocese with a grand jury
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Reilly announced the agreement after meeting with lawyers for the
archdiocese and district attorneys from five Boston-area counties.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have to deal with at this point and what my colleagues have
to deal with are decades of unreported crimes against children," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Church lawyers left the meeting without speaking to reporters. In a
statement, the archdiocese termed the meeting "productive" and said it
will continue to provide information about abuse to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Up until Friday, church officials said they were unable to release the
victims' names because they were bound in many cases by confidentiality
agreements under civil court settlements with the accusers. But
prosecutors said such agreements are void if their effect is to hide a
crime.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have two weeks to turn over the information.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUMA, La.
</DL>
<LD>A man was found guilty Friday in a rape for which his brother spent
19 years in prison before he was freed by the same DNA technology that
implicated his sibling.</LD>
<LD>   Marlo Charles' trial included reluctant testimony from his brother,
Clyde, 49, who was released three years ago after a lengthy court battle
for the right to DNA testing that was not available at his own trial.</LD>
<LD>   Marlo Charles, 46, faces life in prison for the 1981 rape of a
26-year-old nurse in a clover field in rural Terrebonne Parish.</LD>
<TE>   After the verdict, the victim smiled and her mother wept. Members of
Charles' family were not in the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Mark Rhodes said he took satisfaction not only in the
conviction but also in helping free the sibling.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very satisfied that the perpetrator of this crime is going to be
punished," Rhodes said. "I think it sets both things right."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Robert Jenkins said he believed Marlo Charles' fate
was determined when the judge allowed the prosecution to bring up a
Virginia rape allegation against his client that was never prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   In his closing argument, Rhodes acknowledged he could not explain why
Clyde Charles was wearing clothes described by the victim or why a blond
hair matching the victim's was found on the clothing when he was
arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins, meanwhile, attacked the credibility of detectives who claimed
Marlo Charles confessed and questioned the prosecution's interpretation
of the DNA evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't let them confuse you about 'It's a match,' " Jenkins told
jurors. "All it is is a statistic of frequency."</TE>
<TE>   During his testimony, Clyde Charles acknowledged that more than 20
years ago his lawyer raised the possibility in court that it was really
his younger brother who was the rapist. But Charles told the court he
could not account for his lawyer's tactics.</TE>

<LD>Agoura Hills Home Depot--A subheadline on a Feb. 11 story in the
California section incorrectly stated that the city of Agoura Hills had
"quietly prepared an agreement pledging public funds for a controversial
Home Depot project." Elements of the story reinforced that error. In
fact, the city was merely in negotiations with developer Dan Selleck over
the terms of a Home Depot project, including proposals that the city
contribute funding for related improvements. There is no agreement yet.
The story contained out-of-date estimates, attributed to a Home Depot
consultant, that the project would cost $15 million more than investors
have committed, and that the city would have to contribute $1.5 million a
year for 10 years to cover the difference. New estimates show no cost
overruns.</LD>
<TE>   The story also was incorrect in saying that the proposal called on the
city to help pay for site upgrades and the relocation of an animal
shelter. The proposals under discussion would not require the city to pay
for those items. In addition, the story incorrectly stated that the
proposals would have the city contribute its funding up front. The
proposals, if approved, would tap future sales tax revenues from the
project to fund the city's contribution. The story also incorrectly said
that Selleck and Home Depot had spent $150,000 to fight Measure H, an
Agoura Hills ballot initiative that would ban big-box stores. Selleck and
Home Depot had spent $39,000.</TE>
<TE>   A caption for a photo accompanying the story should not have said that
Mel Adams will see his business disappear because of the Home Depot
project. That is not a certainty.</TE>

<LD>Global Crossing--Global Crossing Ltd.'s available cash increased by
$100 million from Jan. 28 to Feb. 25. A story in Wednesday's Business
section incorrectly reported that it had declined by $200 million. A
Wednesday story about Global Crossing's 401(k) plan incorrectly reported
that the company's bankruptcy is the fifth-largest in U.S. history. It is
the fourth-largest. In addition, a Sunday story about Global Crossing's
board of directors incorrectly stated that former director Norman
Brownstein is a childhood friend of Global Crossing Chairman Gary
Winnick. In fact, the two have known each other for about 15 years.</LD>

<LD>After 35 years as an educator in the Los Angeles Unified School
District, John Hyland retired Friday from his post as principal of
North Hollywood Senior High School.</LD>
<LD>   Before taking over at North Hollywood six years ago, Hyland had
already put in 18 years as a science and history teacher at Belvedere
Middle School in East Los Angeles. Next, he trained new teachers and
bilingual classroom teachers before working as an assistant principal
at Belmont Senior and Eagle Rock high schools.</LD>
<LD>   By the time he reached North Hollywood, he had spent countless
hours navigating an underfunded, crowded school district. Although
his latest school was known for its gifted magnet and Advanced
Placement programs, when he started, Hyland immediately heard from
parents worried about the quality of instruction and a new year-round
schedule.</LD>
<TE>   Hyland's response remains the same today as it was then: "What
needs to happen is to change the institution to better attend to the
interests and needs of young adults."</TE>
<TE>   Creative ideas peppered his tenure, colleagues said.</TE>
<TE>   His legacy includes nine small learning communities, theme-based
academies within the school in which teams of teachers allow students
to pursue career interests in fields such as child development, the
environment and social justice.</TE>
<TE>   Hyland also introduced the academic mentoring program, which
trains parents to navigate an educational bureaucracy that can be
confusing--especially for those who do not speak English.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just an inspiration ... He's willing to do whatever it
takes," said Peggy Johnson, an English teacher at North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Hyland says he'll continue to work in the district to establish
learning communities at other schools. But he will not be gracing the
campus of North Hollywood Senior High every day.</TE>
<TE>   "He will be sorely missed," said Al Cortes, LAUSD director of
North Hollywood schools.</TE>
