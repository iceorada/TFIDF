get nods.</DH>

<LD>Redemption and uplifting triumph. Those longtime themes of U2's music
also applied on Friday to the veteran Irish band's career trajectory
as its "comeback" album earned a field-leading eight nominations for
the 44th Grammy Awards, including album, song and record of the year.</LD>
<LD>   U2's "All That You Can't Leave Behind" will vie in the best album
category with collections from Bob Dylan, Atlanta rap duo OutKast,
R&amp;B singer-songwriter India.Arie and the soundtrack to "O Brother,
Where Art Thou?" The U2 single "Walk On," meanwhile, competes in the
record of the year category, while "Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get
Out Of" is nominated for song of the year.</LD>
<LD>   While U2 is one of the most famous bands in the world, the
second-highest number of nominations went to a young newcomer,
India.Arie, whose infectious "Video" was nominated for song and
record of the year (the former recognizes songwriting, the latter
honors the best single or album track of the year). The Atlanta
singer's disc "Acoustic Soul" was nominated for best album, one of
her seven nominations.</LD>
<TE>   "It means a lot, more than I can say," a jubilant Arie said
Friday. "It took me two years to record this album, two years of
struggle, 365 days of struggle multiplied by two. A lot of those days
I was just depressed and thinking, 'Maybe I should just be a
songwriter.'"</TE>
<TE>   It was, it turns out, a good year to be a singer-songwriter.
Unlike recent Grammy seasons when mega-selling pop acts such as
Britney Spears, 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys were nominated in top
categories, this year the top fields were dominated by artists who
write their own songs and play instruments. They ranged from Dylan,
the most celebrated songwriter of the rock era, to best new artist
nominee Nelly Furtado, a young Canadian who melds hip-hop beats,
Brazilian rhythms and modern rock into a buoyant hybrid.</TE>
<TE>   And as usual, it was a good year to be Pierre Boulez. The
celebrated modernist conductor and composer got six nominations,
raising his lifetime total to 56. He is fourth all-time among Grammy
winners, and with a good showing this year, could close the gap
considerably on late Georg Solti, the leader with 31 of the
gramophone trophies.</TE>
<TE>   Also vying in the record and song of the year categories is "Drops
of Jupiter," the hit by Train, the earthy, melodic pop-rock group
that began seven years ago as a coffeehouse act in San Francisco</TE>
<TE>   Joining Boulez with six nominations this year: country singer
Alison Krauss, R&amp;B singer Brian McKnight and rap duo OutKast.</TE>
<TE>   The nominations for the quirky and acclaimed OutKast continue the
trend of acknowledging hip-hop and rap after years of ignoring the
genres.</TE>
<TE>   While OutKast may be off the radar of casual pop fans, the duo,
Dre and Big Boi, are heralded in rap circles as a clever and
innovative force in the "Dirty South" movement, a vibrant corner of
the hip-hop landscape. Among their nominations was "Stankonia" for
best album and the hit "Ms. Jackson" for best record.</TE>
<TE>   OutKast is only the fourth hip-hop act to be nominated in the
album field, joining the Fugees in 1996, Lauryn Hill in 1999 and
Eminem, who created a firestorm of controversy with his nod last
year.</TE>
<TE>   If last year's Grammys will be remembered for the debate over the
artistic weight of Eminem's music, this year's show, to be broadcast
globally on Feb. 27 from Staples Center, may shape up to be a
celebration of U2.</TE>
<TE>   It was 25 years ago that a group of Dublin high school students
formed a band that would become U2, and 14 years ago that their album
"The Joshua Tree" won the Grammy for best album and took its place as
one of the seminal records of recent decades. Since then, though,
albums such as "Zooropa" and "Pop" have been perceived by many as
uncertain musical steps. It was also in question whether the band's
guitar rock and earnest lyrics fit into the era of hip-hop and
rap-rock.</TE>
<TE>   Those doubts seem moot with the 3.2 million copies sold of "All
That You Can't Leave Behind" in the U.S. alone, and the band's 2001
concert tour, which trails only the Rolling Stones' 1994 swing as the
highest-grossing tour in North American history. To many ears, the
band's music also took on more resonance after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, and U2 responded by setting up a screen to scroll the names
of the victims during their concerts.</TE>
<TE>   "It was almost a case of a band mediating history every night," U2
manager Paul McGuinness said Friday. "I don't think there's a lot of
other bands that could have done that and been applauded for it."</TE>
<TE>   McGuinness said he tracked down each of the band's members--singer
Bono, guitarist the Edge, drummer Larry Mullen Jr. and bassist Adam
Clayton--in four countries to share the news of the nominations.
"Everyone was extremely excited," the manager said. "Believe me,
nobody in U2 is blase about this type of honor. This past year was
U2's greatest year, and this only adds to that."</TE>
<TE>   It was also the greatest year for young singer and pianist Alicia
Keys, whose debut album, "Songs in A Minor," hit No. 1 on the U.S.
charts and earned rave reviews. She finished with six nominations
and, creating an intriguing match-up, competes with Arie in each of
those categories. Both are among a wave of thriving artists drawing
on old-school soul, including Hill, Jill Scott, Angie Stone, Erykah
Badu, Maxwell and D'Angelo.</TE>
<TE>   Arie had an edge in her voice Friday when she said, "No, I'm not
surprised" when asked whether it was unexpected for her to get a best
album nomination rather than the more publicized Keys. But then she
added that she is proud to be among a movement of artists offering a
humanistic sound. "It's a great feeling because it means that people
are looking for more in their music, something real and something
moving. The world needs that now."</TE>
<TE>   Arie and Keys are also nominated for best new artist. Others in
that prestigious category: David Gray, the British singer-songwriter
whose acoustic hit "Babylon" put him in this field, although he has
been releasing albums for seven years; Furtado, the Canadian
singer-songwriter; and Linkin Park, the hard-edged rap-rock quintet
that had the best-selling album of 2001, "Hybrid Theory."</TE>
<TE>   Two of the best album nominees, Dylan's "Love and Theft" and the
"O Brother" soundtrack, draw on the heritage of folk, bluegrass and
country music. For Dylan, "Love and Theft" is his 43rd album and the
first since "Time Out of Mind," which won the 1997 Grammy for best
album. The collection became the most critically acclaimed disc of
2001 with its survey of blues and country styles. "O Brother,"
meanwhile, is a celebration of roots music keyed to the eccentric
Coen brothers film about a trio of 1930s Mississippi convicts. The
soundtrack includes Ralph Stanley, Emmylou Harris and Alison Krauss.</TE>
<TE>   T Bone Burnett, producer of the "O Brother" soundtrack, said
Friday he has marveled at the album's commercial success, the
launching of a tie-in concert tour and the fact that music stores are
responding to newfound customer interest by creating whole sections
of "traditional American music." The audience was primed, Burnett
said, by the pop leanings of today's mainstream country music.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it had a good chance of reaching people because it was
a wide-open shot. What I mean is, so much of country music today has
abandoned itself," Burnett said. "It has so little 'country' left
about it I thought we had a chance to reach the mainstream with it.
Anyone I mentioned it to, though, just rolled their eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Grammys keep their categories narrow, this year's
classical music nominations are more diverse than ever. The best
choral recordings include Bach's "St. Matthew Passion" and a new
"Passion After St. Mark" by Osvaldo Golijov that is influenced by
Cuban and Brazilian music.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, classical composers can be sighted in nonclassical
categories as well, what with Tan Dun's score to "Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon" receiving a best soundtrack nomination and a version
of a Debussy piano piece arranged by Bela Fleck and Edgar Meyer
winding up in the best instrumental arrangement category.</TE>
<TE>   Of local significance, the Angeles Quartet's set of Haydn's string
quartets has been nominated for best chamber music and engineered
recording.</TE>
<TE>   The eligibility period for the 44th Grammy Awards ran from Oct. 1,
2000 through Sept. 30, 2001. This year there are 99 categories with
502 nominees.</TE>
<TE>   The award winners will be decided by the 12,000 voting members of
the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences. Those voters also
select nominees, but a blue-ribbon committee selects the final five
nominees in top categories from the general membership's list of top
20 vote-getters.</TE>

<LD>Classical music recording has never been less homogenous, with big
labels cutting back, new independents springing to life and an
overall branching out historically and geographically. And the Grammy
nominations this year reflect that diversity fairly well.</LD>
<LD>   Even so, one irresistible Grammy favorite, Pierre Boulez, does
still dominate the list with three recordings nominated in five
categories. Boulez's spectacular recording of works by Varese played
by the Chicago Symphony is nominated for best classical and
orchestral recordings. His latest version of Schoenberg's Piano
Concerto with Mitsuko Uchida and the Cleveland Orchestra also has a
best classical album nomination (Uchida received a nomination as best
soloist as well). Meanwhile, Boulez's own dazzling, recent
masterpiece, "Sur Incises," played by the Ensemble InterContemporain,
is nominated for best contemporary composition and best chamber music
performance.</LD>
<LD>   The most honored single release by this year's Grammy nominators,
however, reflects the changing face of classical recording.</LD>
<TE>   The live performance of Berlioz's opera "The Trojans," with
nominations for best classical, opera and best engineered recording,
was not produced commercially but by the London Symphony Orchestra.
James Mallinson, the producer of the admirable series of live LSO
Berlioz releases under Colin Davis, is also nominated.</TE>
<TE>   Other artists who have made strong showings are Danish composer
Poul Ruders, whose new opera, "Handmaid's Tale," has multiple
nominations, as does the Angeles String Quartet for its celebrated
Haydn set.</TE>
<TE>   Contemporary compositions are more prevalent than ever--for
instance, the new passions by Osvaldo Golijov (the Los Angeles
Philharmonic's current composer in residence) and Wolfgang Rihm both
received nominations for best choral recording. Giuseppe Sinopoli,
whose premature death last year shocked the classical world, is
remembered for two of his last recordings--Strauss' "Ariadne auf
Naxos" and Dvorak's "Stabat Mater."</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps the two categories that most typify the unpredictable
and even venturesome nature of this year's nominations are that of
best small ensemble performance (a study in eclecticism) and best
crossover (all respectable recordings rather than the cheesy discs
that dominate sales).</TE>

<HD>Music Industry Seeks Comeback in 2002</HD>
<DH>Sales: The pressure is on after CD purchases fell for the
first time in a decade. Springsteen, Guns N' Roses albums could be
among new releases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENN GAMBOA</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the music industry, 2001 was "The Year of the Chicken."</LD>
<LD>   It was the year they came home to roost in the $40-billion
industry, leading to the first CD sales drop in a decade.</LD>
<LD>   It was the year when counting them before they hatched--Michael
Jackson's $30-million "Invincible" and Mariah Carey's
$10-million-plus "Glitter," to name a couple--left lots of folks with
egg on their faces.</LD>
<TE>   It was also the year when most record companies played it safe
with promoting new talent, leading to a year that minted no new major
stars other than Alicia Keys (championed by master
insider-turned-renegade Clive Davis at J Records).</TE>
<TE>   Big names don't always yield big sales anymore. Big buzz doesn't
always work either--ask Shelby Lynne and Macy Gray. Four of the Big
Five--BMG, EMI, Warner and Sony--reported lower earnings last year,
with only Universal continuing its growth spurt.</TE>
<TE>   All this leads to big pressure in 2002, as the industry tries to
rebuild the coop with help from a brood of superstars and newcomers.</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 most-anticipated lineup of CD releases includes:</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band, album title and release
date to be announced. The songs have been dribbling out, one amazing
tune after another. "American Skin (41 Shots)" finally showed up on
the live album. "My City of Ruins" arrived on "America: A Tribute to
Heroes." The band has already knocked out demo versions of the songs
"Code of Silence" and "Further on Up the Road." Reports have the gang
heading into the studio early this year, with hopes that the new
album may arrive in time for Thanksgiving.</TE>
<TE>   However, there have been false starts before for the first
Springsteen studio album since 1995's "The Ghost of Tom Joad."</TE>
<TE>   Guns N' Roses, "Chinese Democracy" (Interscope/Geffen), release
date TBA. The long-awaited comeback by Axl Rose and new hired guns
was really, really supposed to come out last year. First, April.
Next, June. Then, um, not. It may finally surface this year, with
songs that lean (depending on whom you ask) toward the more eclectic
rocking of guitarists Buckethead and ex-Nine Inch Nail Robin Finck or
to the classic "Appetite for Destruction"-era sound.</TE>
<TE>   With a pack of rockers dominating the charts, timing may never be
better for Rose. That is, of course, unless he decides to wait until
rock dies again and comes back to life.</TE>
<TE>   N.E.R.D., "In Search Of ... " (Virgin), out Feb. 12. The
Neptunes--recording here as N.E.R.D.--are hot. The production team
has helmed hits for everyone from Mystikal and Jay-Z to Britney
Spears and the Backstreet Boys. And now the group hopes to follow its
pals up the charts with this album. The first single, "Lapdance,"
featuring remixes by Trent Reznor and Paul Oakenfold, is a
hard-hitting mix of industrial rock and hip-hop that could be this
year's genre-busting "Get Ur Freak On." It's practically a sure hit,
with many more to come on the groovy yet experimental album,
including the uplifting "Things Are Getting Better" and the raucous
"Rock Star (Poser)."</TE>
<TE>   Nine Inch Nails, title and release date TBA. Reznor and pals will
release "Live: And All That Could Have Been," a collection culled
from "The Fragile" tour, on Jan. 22. However, there is even more
interest in the next NIN studio album, which Reznor has described in
recent interviews as "pretty primitive, stripped-down, minimalist,
brutal music," a throwback to his breakthrough albums, "Pretty Hate
Machine" and "The Downward Spiral." Reports say the new album could
arrive in late fall.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Adams, title and release date TBA. Yeah, people are just
catching on to the singer-songwriter's great "Gold" album now that
his video for "New York, New York" has been discovered.</TE>
<TE>   But the prolific 26-year-old songwriter isn't wasting time. He's
already finished a new solo album of alt-country heartbreak dubbed
"48 Hours," some of which has already worked its way into his live
show. However, that release won't come out until after his big rock
record is released, probably under the name the Pinkhearts, to stem
the tide of Ryan releases.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the industry also has high hopes in 2002 for a boxed
set from the Rolling Stones celebrating the band's 40th anniversary,
David Bowie's debut for his new ISO label and the solo debut from
TLC's Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes, dubbed "Supernova."</TE>
<TE>   And music fans are waiting for the follow-ups to a number of
breakthrough albums from Weezer, whose eponymous album put it back on
the map; Wilco, which will finally release the praised "Yankee Hotel
Foxtrot" in April after freeing itself from label politics; Coldplay,
which is still releasing tracks from the excellent "Parachutes"
album; Joseph Arthur, who already has delivered the excellent "I
Donated Myself to the Mexican Army" as a sneak peek at what to expect
from his follow-up to the fantastic "Come to Where I'm From" album;
and the Twilight Singers, the laid-back electronic blues outfit that
is Greg Dulli's sole outlet now that the Afghan Whigs have disbanded.
And of course there's Moby.</TE>
<TE>   Sounds like a pretty good year on paper. Let's hope the CDs sound
just as good.</TE>

<LD>The pendulum swings back. After years of Grammy domination by
multimillion-selling pop-country acts, staunchly traditional country
music burst through this year thanks to two high-profile multi-artist
projects.</LD>
<LD>   "Timeless: Hank Williams Tribute" and the hit soundtrack from "O
Brother, Where Art Thou?" combined for eight nominations in country
fields, snagging nearly half of all those in the male, female and
country collaboration vocal categories.</LD>
<LD>   The result is some of the strongest nomination fields in ages, and
a couple of nods to artists who operate outside the mainstream:
Americana rock maverick Ryan Adams and critically lauded
singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams. Johnny Cash, Sheryl Crow, Emmylou
Harris, Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch figured in nods from the two
projects.</LD>
<TE>   The absence of new albums from Shania Twain, Faith Hill or Garth
Brooks during the Grammy eligibility period opened the door for this
year's wider-ranging group of nominees.</TE>
<TE>   The weakest field of nominees this year is the country song
category, none of which measures up to the depth of emotion that
suffuses the Williams tribute and the "O Brother" album. Newcomer
Jamie O'Neal, with two songwriting nominations, co-wrote the
strongest nominee, "There Is No Arizona," her hit single about the
disintegration of romantic illusions.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks got a single nomination for his duet with George Jones,
"Beer Run (B Double E Double Are You In?)."</TE>
<TE>   The nomination of "Timeless" and Trisha Yearwood's "Inside Out"
for country album awards put two critically admired works up against
more routine efforts by Tim McGraw, Willie Nelson and Diamond Rio.</TE>

<LD>Having a whole separate competition for Latin Grammys--with winners
already announced earlier this year--drains the drama out of the
regular Grammy nominations in Latin music categories.</LD>
<LD>   Mercifully, it also takes the sting out of the shocking omissions
and strange inclusions that typically plague Latin selections in the
main event.</LD>
<LD>   Still, it seems unforgivable to ignore the best of the new Cuban
performers this time in the salsa category, which snubbed the
spirited Carlos Manuel and elegant Issac Delgado. The traditional
tropical category offers some comfort, with nominations for the
always respectable elderly alumni of the Buena Vista Social Club,
along with Colombia's vibrant vallenato master Carlos Vives.</LD>
<TE>   In the pop category, fans may wonder whatever happened to
Alejandro Sanz, the Spaniard who won an armload of Latin Grammys
recently for his romantic reverie "El Alma Al Aire." His omission
from the list is a technicality, since the eligibility periods for
the two Grammy competitions overlap but are not identical.</TE>
<TE>   But eligibility dates are no excuse for this lackluster crop of
Latin pop nominations. The category ignores eligible and interesting
albums by Spain's Estopa and Mexico's Armando Manzanero, whose
"Duetos" won last year's Latin Grammy for best pop album by a duo or
group.</TE>
<TE>   The opposite is true of the Latin rock/alternative category, where
the nominations reveal the vitality of the genre, with five excellent
choices including Colombia's Aterciopelados and Juanes; the latter's
"Fijate Bien" also won big in the Latin Grammys.</TE>
<TE>   Respected veterans Vicente Fernandez, Ramon Ayala and Pepe Aguilar
loyally anchor the Mexican category.</TE>

<LD>The most startling aspect of this year's jazz Grammy nominations is
not who is included but who is not. Amazingly, Diana Krall's "The
Look of Love" is nowhere to be found in the best jazz vocal album
category. This, despite its enormous popularity and breakout
sales--usually two of the most basic gauges for nomination. Nor was
Jane Monheit, one of the most visible up-and-coming jazz vocalists,
included. Are we experiencing some sort of backlash here?</LD>
<LD>   What has been listed in the field is fairly predictable: Karrin
Allyson, whose "Ballads: Remembering John Coltrane" may be the most
imaginative of the lot, as well as albums from Shirley Horn, Dianne
Reeves, Kurt Elling and, somewhat unexpectedly, Mose Allison.</LD>
<LD>   Elsewhere, there are few surprises but some fairly high-quality
entries. The best instrumental jazz album, for example, is filled
with first-rate CDs, especially the "Kindred" encounter between
Stefon Harris and Jacky Terrasson. Dave Holland's "Not for Nothin',"
Roy Haynes' Charlie Parker tribute "Birds of a Feather," Sonny
Rollins' "This Is What I Do" and Pat Martino's "Live at Yoshi's" make
up the balance of an extremely competitive grouping.</LD>
<TE>   The best Latin jazz album category is also attractive. Charlie
Haden has a prime entry with "Nocturne," in part because of the
presence of David Sanchez and Gonzalo Rubalcaba, who also have their
own albums ("Travesia" and "Supernova," respectively) in the lineup.
But there will be potent rivalry from Los Hombres Calientes ("Vol. 3:
New Congo Square") and the superb collection "Calle 54."</TE>
<TE>   There are lots of styles and some real creative energy in the best
contemporary jazz album selections. There may be more pure jazz
diversity here--with albums from Russell Gunn, Marcus Miller, Mike
Stern, Bill Evans (the saxophonist) and the ensemble of Dennis
Chambers, Tony MacAlpine, Brian Auger and Bunny Brunel--than in any
other listing.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the always enigmatic grouping, best jazz instrumental
solo, includes some appealing if not especially momentous playing
from Terence Blanchard, Michael Brecker, Gary Burton, Pat Martino and
the duo of Kenny Barron &amp; Regina Carter.</TE>

<LD>Given the current R&amp;B renaissance, Grammy voters could have it both
ways this year: They could nominate artists that sold well and also
had something compelling to offer listeners.</LD>
<LD>   The female categories, in particular, were a can't-miss
proposition, what with strong debuts from Alicia Keys and India.Arie,
a great dance album from Destiny's Child and a smattering of fine
singles from other artists.</LD>
<LD>   All of the female R&amp;B vocal nominees are worthy of inclusion. Look
for Keys to snag a statuette, thought Jill Scott's sultry live
version of "A Long Walk" is perhaps the most imaginative vocal
display of the bunch.</LD>
<TE>   The male vocal nominees do not offer as many sublime moments. If
sales trump quality, then Usher will get the nod, but Musiq
Soulchild's "Love," though hardly the strongest track on his debut
album, is a fine showcase for his supple voice.</TE>
<TE>   In the group or duo category, look for eminence grise Ronald Isley
and the Isley Brothers to win with "Contagious," a strong echo of the
band's classic bedroom ballads of the '70s.</TE>
<TE>   In a nice bit of twisted Grammy logic, Missy Elliott's "Get Ur
Freak On," arguably the best all-around single of the year, received
its only R&amp;B nomination in the best song category. Keys is the
front-runner in this category, which salutes the songs' writers, but
Arie's righteous anthem "Video" is most worthy of a win.</TE>
<TE>   Voter sympathy could help Aaliyah's fine self-titled album win a
posthumous award, though a Grammy for either Arie's or Keys' terrific
debuts would make more sense.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>OutKast is arguably the best rap group of all time, but it has never
won a Grammy--a situation that may change because it has been
nominated not only for best rap album, but also album of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Jay-Z's "The Blueprint" and Ludacris' "Back for the First Time"
are worthy rivals in the rap competition, but OutKast's "Stankonia"
contains doses of daring musicianship, political commentary and a
creativity that's unmatched by other albums in the category.</LD>
<LD>   The rest of the rap categories contain the usual puzzlements. It's
a stretch to even call Afroman's novelty hit "Because I Got High" a
rap record, and its presence in the solo performance category instead
of Petey Pablo's "Raise Up" is a disgrace. Of the other nominees,
Nelly stands a good chance with his sing-songy "Ride Wit Me," as do
Missy Elliott for her party-starting "Get Ur Freak On" and Jay-Z for
his catchy "Izzo (H.O.V.A.)." DMX's hard-core "Who We Be" is the dark
horse of this category.</LD>
<TE>   The voters did their best job in the new best rap/sung
collaboration category, as four of the five songs deserve their spot.
Jagged Edge featuring Nelly should win for the delightful feel-good
ditty "Where the Party At," but Eve featuring Gwen Stefani's "Let Me
Blow Ya Mind" poses a credible challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Ja Rule again slides in probably because of his commercial appeal,
not his talent, for the silky smooth "Livin' It Up," while a
surprising nomination goes to "W" from critically acclaimed
underground rapper-singer Mystic and Planet Asia.</TE>
<TE>   OutKast resurfaces in best rap performance by a duo or group for
the baby-mama drama anthem "Ms. Jackson," although its superior "BOB"
was overlooked, probably because of its revved-up, revolutionary
blend of jungle, hip-hop and gospel. Perennial whipping boy P. Diddy
gets a well-deserved nomination for "Bad Boy for Life," his
collaboration with Black Rob and Mark Curry.</TE>

<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There haven't been many times over the last four decades when it has
been possible to put the words "job well done" and "Grammy Award
nominations" in the same sentence, but this is one.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the recording academy screening committee did such a
commendable job generally in the nominations for best album, the most
prestigious award, that the full membership will have to work extra
hard to foul things up when they select the winner.</LD>
<LD>   As if spurred by the tragic events of Sept. 11 to search more
diligently for substance in pop music, the committee ignored
lightweight bestsellers in the most high-profile categories. This
means no 'N Sync or Backstreet Boys. None of the cliched rappers or
angry, cartoonish rockers.</LD>
<TE>   In the best album category, the result is a nicely diverse
collection that reflects the strongest currents of today's pop music,
from rock to rap to country. There isn't even the outrage of last
year's Eminem controversy to distract voters.</TE>
<TE>   It'll be easy to applaud if the 12,000 academy members give the
best album award to U2's "All That You Can't Leave Behind." It's an
uplifting album that has reconfirmed the veteran Irish band's
position as the most celebrated group in rock. Its robust sales in
the U.S. (more than 3 million) also reminded the pop world of the
continuing power of inspirational rock 'n' roll at a time when the
music's future has been widely questioned.</TE>
<TE>   The U2 album was released in 2000 after the deadline for Grammy
voting last year (the balloting follows an Oct. 1-Sept. 30 calendar).
Its "Beautiful Day," however, was released as a single in time for
last year's voting and won for best record. The album, with its
balance of social optimism and personal melancholy, gained added
power emotionally in the aftermath of Sept. 11, thanks to a tour that
was among the most memorable in years.</TE>
<TE>   A victory for Bob Dylan's "Love and Theft" would be equally
popular--and another vote for classic rock 'n' roll values. For
years, ignoring Dylan was a symbol of just about everything that was
wrong with Grammy voting. While he was turning out a series of albums
in the '60s that helped define rock 'n' roll as an art form and
express the ideals of a generation, the Grammy voters saw him as an
outsider.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they nominated such insignificant mainstream fare as Al
Hirt, Herb Alpert and the Singing Nun. They finally caught up with
the times in 1999 by honoring Dylan's brilliant, moody "Time Out of
Mind" as album of the year. One reason the album was nominated was a
change in the balloting system instituted in 1995 to help achieve a
more relevant list of nominees. Instead of the entire membership
selecting nominees, a screening committee was created in the most
high-profile categories.</TE>
<TE>   "Love and Theft" is a more challenging work than "Time Out of
Mind" because it is less orthodox structurally, so it will be
interesting to see if the full membership sees it as an equally
powerful work or if it is thrown by its differences.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the strengths of the U2 and Dylan collections, a win for
OutKast's "Stankonia" would also be gratifying because it would send
a welcome message to mainstream, adult audiences about the importance
of rap as an art form. The only hip-hop album to win best album was
Lauryn Hill's "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" in 1999, and that
collection was far from hard-core rap. Eminem's "The Marshall Mathers
LP" should have won last year, but its aggressive sensibilities were
simply too extreme for the voters. "Stankonia" is a sensational,
sonically marvelous exercise that is free of the social outrage of
Eminem.</TE>
<TE>   While not in the same league artistically as these three, the "O
Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack would also be a pleasing choice
on several levels.</TE>
<TE>   The music, featuring vocals by such gifted figures as Emmylou
Harris and Alison Krauss, is an endearing salute to traditional
American roots sounds, and it was a huge hit in the country field,
where it served as a slap at all the Nashville hit makers who have
turned their backs on traditional country music in a search for wider
pop sales.</TE>
<TE>   India.Arie's "Acoustic Soul" is a nicely constructed debut album
that is anchored by "Video," one of the year's most glowing
singles--a liberating expression of self-worth that reminds you of
the understated assurance of Lauryn Hill. Still, this is the weakest
of the nominees.</TE>
<TE>   Among stronger choices available: Alicia Keys' "Songs in A Minor,"
the White Stripes' "White Blood Cells," Angie Stone's "Mahogany Soul"
and Lucinda Williams' "Essence."</TE>
<TE>   In the best record category, U2 will try for two Grammys in a row
with "Walk On," another song with the upbeat textures of last year's
"Beautiful Day." India.Arie's "Video" and OutKast's "Ms. Jackson" are
also strong nominees in a relatively tame field. But Keys' "Fallin'"
is the most distinguished work--a song that recasts traditional R&amp;B
strains in a modern setting, reflecting on the endless tension of
romantic relationships. Train's "Drops of Jupiter" rounds out a field
that could have been brightened by such possibilities as Staind's
"It's Been Awhile," Angie Stone's "Brotha" and Travis' "Sing."</TE>
<TE>   The best new artist has some viable competitors, including Keys
and India.Arie. Both deal in a modern, smart R&amp;B-pop, but Keys showed
the wider range and more enticing ambition. Nelly Furtado is another
exciting arrival with a broad, bright musical canvas. The field is
rounded out by singer-songwriter David Gray and the rock 'n' rap
group Linkin Park. The biggest surprise is the absence of Ryan Adams,
an especially gifted young singer-songwriter who did show up in the
best rock album category and for male vocalist in the rock and
country fields.</TE>
<TE>   On Grammy night, Feb. 27, I'll be rooting for Dylan for best
album, Keys' "Fallin'" for best record and Keys herself for best new
artist.</TE>

<HD>Woodrow Wilson and the Current W</HD>
<DH>The PBS 'American Experience' profile of our 28th president
brings to mind a few comparisons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>History hooks you most when exhuming the past and relating it to the
present.</LD>
<LD>   That happens in a new "American Experience" two-parter on Woodrow
Wilson, the nation's 28th president, who in some ways brings to mind,
of all fellows, George W. Bush. Having a different agenda, this
documentary doesn't identify and connect these threads, but some
viewers surely will.</LD>
<LD>   Although both rose to the White House from governorships,
outwardly the two couldn't be more unalike. Wilson was a college
professor who became president of Princeton at age 46, a job fitting
his cerebral exterior accentuated by ever-present steel-rimmed
glasses. Bush is a homespun silk hat, a Texan and Yale alum of such
modest academic distinction that political foes have seen his
intellect as a fat bull's-eye.</LD>
<TE>   Wilson's austere, aloof persona aside, however, we learn from this
absorbing PBS work by Carl Byker that he was a deeply passionate
Georgian who grew up as baseball-loving Tommy Wilson, and only in his
20s began using his middle name, Woodrow, because it sounded more
distinguished. He was an idealist, we hear, but also a pragmatic
politician.</TE>
<TE>   Like Bush, moreover, Wilson was devoutly religious, to the extent
that he saw himself as "the instrument of God." Like the current
president, also, Wilson was domestic-minded when assuming office in
1913 and, says one historian here, had to "learn foreign policy by
the seat of his pants."</TE>
<TE>   That bell tolled for Bush Sept. 11, a daunting challenge he has
risen to incisively.</TE>
<TE>   For Wilson, it was World War I, which began as a European conflict
in which the U.S. remained neutral, with the president having been
deeply shaken by the Civil War carnage he witnessed as a young boy.</TE>
<TE>   Yet pressure on the U.S. to join the English and French
intensified after 128 Americans sank with the passenger ship
Lusitania when it was torpedoed by a German sub in 1915. Two years
later, America's doughboys were in Europe battling "the Hun."</TE>
<TE>   Like the Republican Bush as well, notes narrator Linda Hunt, the
Democrat Wilson faced a Senate in which the opposing party held a
crucial one-vote edge. This Senate would hand Wilson a devastating
defeat in rejecting his plan for a postwar international forum known
as the League of Nations.</TE>
<TE>   A forerunner of the United Nations, it was a grand concept of a
globe whose conflicts would be settled without war. And a badly
ailing Wilson's futile whistle-stop speaking tour to rally support
for it across America is captured magnificently here by old newsreel
footage and seamless reenactments. As is his distress over the
Versailles Peace Treaty's harsh terms, dictated by England and
France, that sowed in defeated Germany seeds of discontent that would
ripen that nation for takeover by Adolf Hitler and his brown-shirt
bullies.</TE>
<TE>   Although Wilson's presidency is given generally good marks by
historians, deep ruts surface as well. Paralleling another future
White House, an old affair comes back to haunt him. More
significantly, we hear him criticized for suspending civil liberties
during the war, and for his opposition to racial integration. Despite
having two strong women as wives, moreover, he is seen here as no
friend of suffragettes.</TE>
<TE>   His first wife, Ellen, raised the job of first lady "to a whole
new level" before her death, viewers are told. And the second, Edith,
became what is termed a "shadow president" in 1919 as her husband lay
paralyzed by a massive stroke for a month, and a "White House
cover-up" kept the nation uninformed about his true condition.</TE>
<TE>   This amazing and frightful episode never fully emerges here from
its own shadow, unfortunately, even though historian John Milton
Cooper calls it "the worst crisis of presidential disability in
American history," with the first lady becoming a "kind of regent"
who cut off access to her husband. "She was very specific that she
never made a decision on her own," Cooper adds, "but we all know that
whoever controls access to the president to some extent ... is the
president."</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the news channels and talk radio would be all over her,
making the study of Wilson from today's perspective all the more
fascinating and seductive.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Part 1 of PBS' "American Experience," "Woodrow Wilson: A
Passionate Man," airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on KCET-TV; Part 2, "Woodrow
Wilson: The Redemption of the World," airs at the same time the

<DH>Zany predictions for '02, from a cooking show for Tony

<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the tradition of Jeanne Dixon, Nostradamus and Douglas MacArthur,
I offer these predictions for the new year:</LD>
<LD>   Fox News Channel will announce that correspondent Geraldo Rivera's
mysterious disappearance in Afghanistan had "nothing whatever to do"
with the channel's sudden realization that it was paying several
million dollars per year to a liberal.</LD>
<LD>   A woman somewhere will have a satisfactory customer-service
experience with her cable company.</LD>
<TE>   Peeved at network TV's attempt to poach one of its stars for a
sitcom, cable's Food Network will fight back by creating a cooking
show for Tony Danza. "Toast and Stuff With Tony D" will target
"people who don't really like food," as well as "Danza's vast and
fiercely loyal fan base."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jackson will announce that as a gesture of love to his
country, he is offering zero-percent financing on his "Invincible"
CD.</TE>
<TE>   Allowing that "even I'm starting to get a little sick of myself,"
Oprah Winfrey will not be the cover photo subject of an issue of her
magazine, probably in July or August. Competing women's magazines,
even Rosie and Martha Stewart Living, will seize the opportunity to
put Oprah on their covers.</TE>
<TE>   The new talk show Winfrey is spinning off, fronted by her
near-co-host Dr. Phil, will rocket to the top of the
syndicated-program ratings. Then Dr. Phil will wake up from that
October dream and realize he has self-esteem issues he needs to take
care of because, let's face it, having a TV show canceled in record
time almost always feels like a personal rejection.</TE>
<TE>   In the world of TV-news-channel fashion, the jacketless anchor
will become the new screen crawl, but only temporarily. By year's
end, it will be clear that the alarmist weatherman is the real new
screen crawl.</TE>
<TE>   The career of regular-guy talk host Bill O'Reilly will implode on
the air when he launches into a diatribe against a junior producer,
"the kind of rube who doesn't know the difference between a latte and
a *$&amp;# cappuccino."</TE>
<TE>   A consortium of the nation's largest media companies will hold a
news conference to announce that it is true: Pretty much everything
wrong in American society is, in fact, the media's fault.</TE>
<TE>   At the same news conference, they will confess that the goal of
all this merging and acquiring has been to see the term "media"
eliminated from the discourse. Soon enough, the spokesman will say,
it'll just be "the medium." Then he will chuckle maniacally.</TE>

<LD>The passing of Eileen Heckart on Dec. 31 was especially poignant.
"Hecky," as she was affectionately known in the theater world, was
not only a gifted performer with a marvelous range but also a woman
of warmth, intense loyalty and simply a great joy to be around.</LD>
<LD>   I first met Hecky when, as a young ex-GI, I joined the
Professional Training Program of the American Theatre Wing in New
York. She was a volunteer actress who helped develop our skills in
scenes from plays and in showcases.</LD>
<LD>   Hecky and I, fellow Ohioans, became good friends; she was
supportive and proud, indeed, when some of us made our Broadway
debuts. She was effusive and compassionate, with a raucous laugh that
seemed to say, "Isn't this a great time we're having!"</LD>

<LD>You have published numerous articles about the grand new Los Angeles
County art museum to be built on the site of the present one, but I
have yet to see any examination of the basic concept of a plan that
concentrates the museum in a single Westside location.</LD>
<LD>   Many schoolchildren in buses, and others in their automobiles,
must travel for up to three hours round-trip to visit the museum. Our
county is far-flung, and it seems to me that the cultural interests
of residents in Claremont, Long Beach, Watts and Lancaster, to name a
few of the locations of our county's taxpayers, would be better
served by a system of regional museums scattered about the county.</LD>
<LD>   The county library, with its many branches, is an example of such
a concept. Of course, the problems are different for art, but the
British Museum and the system of art museums in New York City are
proof that it can be done.</LD>

<LD>Marshall Fine reports that Halle Berry is "the daughter of an African
American father and a white mother" ("A New Level of Comfort," Jan.
2). If it is no longer politically correct to call people black, then
why aren't we informed as to the ethnic heritage of Berry's mother?
Is she Irish, English, French, German, Swedish, Italian, Croat,
Spanish, Portuguese or some mixture of the above? All of those are
unique cultures and not very well described by the term "white."</LD>

<LD>It never ceases to amaze me how music critics and reporters seem to
attach such significance to quantity of sales and staggering monetary
figures of "artists" while completely overlooking artistic integrity
and creativity.</LD>
<LD>   A prime example is the 'N Sync worship exhibited in the Calendar
section on Dec. 29 ("Encore for 'N Sync," by Geoff Boucher). What
about the movers and shakers of 2001 who refused to sell out--artists
like Cake, who put out a groundbreaking video ("Short Skirt/Long
Jacket") on a shoestring budget.</LD>
<LD>   The point I'm trying to make is that The Times would do a great
service to its readers by noticing art and directing a few plaudits
in the direction of creative achievement instead of simply worshiping
commercial success.</LD>

<LD>"Lord of the Rings" letter writer Mark Winkler, who claims he had a
"Frodo Lives" bumper sticker on his 1980 Gremlin (Letters, Dec. 29),
must be living in a fantasy world of his own. The last model year for
that much-maligned American Motors classic was 1978.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I've always thought short stories were a vast untapped vein of
material in Hollywood, despite nearly 50 important feature films
based on them. I disagree with one point Paul Brownfield made in his
article, however ("Short Story Rarely Fills the Screen," Dec.
26)--that studios resist developing short stories because they're too
slight, or for other creative reasons. That's not the case at all, in
fact.</LD>
<LD>   The reason short stories don't get developed that often in
Hollywood has more to do with New York literary agents than anything
else. Essentially, literary agents can't and don't make any money
selling publishing rights to short stories, so they don't bother
sending them to L.A. agents to submit as movie ideas.</LD>
<LD>   When short stories do get turned into movies, it's mostly
serendipitously--a director or producer is an avid reader and
discovers one while trolling through a used bookstore, or reads one
that a friend recommended (like Todd Field finding the Andre Dubus
story for "In the Bedroom").</LD>

<LD>No one wields the business end of a poison pen with quite the flair
of movie critic Kenneth Turan. A recent destructive example of this
tendency can be found within his screed passing as film criticism of
"The Majestic" ("No Surprises at the End, or Anywhere Else," Dec.
21). Turan isn't content merely to pan it; he excoriates and
humiliates its creators.</LD>
<LD>   Curiously enough, I too saw a film by the same title, also
starring Jim Carrey, but "The Majestic" I saw was a gentle, heartfelt
reflection on a time and a sense of ideals I believe a great many
people long for. To paraphrase writer Manuel Puig, "movies ... help
you hope." This film does that beautifully.</LD>

<LD>Kudos to Robert Hilburn for choosing Neil Young's rendition of
"Imagine" by John Lennon as single of the year ("Musical Prayers for
Peace," Dec. 24). Also, kudos to the photographer who took the photo
of Young for shooting from an angle that showed light emanating out
of the top of Neil's head. Young singing "Imagine" for the 9-11
benefit telethon was (is) a universal prayer. Thanks, John; thanks,
Neil.</LD>

<HD>All the News That Fits to Crawl Across Our Television
Screens</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I found your story about the annoying news crawl that appears at the
bottom of the screen on most of the cable news programs an
interesting development in the delivery of the news ("Tough on the
Old Ticker?" by Robert Strauss, Dec. 31). While being able to provide
many more items, I suspect that these stations will end up losing
viewers, precisely because of the information overload.</LD>
<LD>   KENNETH JOYCE</LD>

<TE>   I feel that crawlers at the bottom of the news screen are great!
The human mind is the original multi-threaded processor and can
easily handle what the author hints is an information overload.</TE>
<TE>   RICHARD M. LEMON</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Psychology professor Kerry Laguna's comment concerning TV news
crawls and young people--that they have "faster information
processing" than older viewers--is laughable. The truth is, we are
confronted with a whole new generation that hates to read and has an
attention span the size of a gnat. Inane cell phone conversations and
mindless video games are much more important to them than asking the
bigger questions integral to their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Thus the 30-second sound bite and the news crawl have come into
being to accommodate a group of people who are far less willing to
explore the intellectual side of their minds without help from a
segment of the media that long ago lost its way.</TE>
<TE>   DONALD SOMMERFIELD</TE>
<TE>   San Bernardino</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's not the crawls on the bottom of the cable news screens that
disturb me, it's the annoyance of not being able to read the credits
at the end of a show.</TE>
<TE>   For the past year or two, the after-show credits have been
unreadable. They are in small type, over too far to the right of the
screen, moving very rapidly while the larger window features promos
for the next show coming up.</TE>
<TE>   This is not fair to the viewers, or to the players who do not get
large billing at the beginning of the program.</TE>
<TE>   HARRIETTE SMITH</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Since the crawl is going to continue, please let me know where I
can buy a TV screen with a bottom flap that snaps up to cover the
area. Surely there is a big market for such an item.</TE>

<LD>   Elmo, Big Bird and the Terrorist Attacks</LD>
<LD>   The producers of "Sesame Street" will tackle the prickly topic of
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks when the series launches its 33rd
season on Feb. 4.</LD>
<TE>   According to the Hollywood Reporter, the first episode deals with
Elmo's fears after he sees a grease fire break out at a lunch
counter--and the comfort he receives during a visit with real-life
firefighters at a station in Harlem.</TE>
<TE>   Other shows this season focus on diversity and tolerance (Big
Bird's visiting pen pal is aghast to find that his buddy is friendly
with species other than birds) and the loss of a loved one (Big Bird
learning to cope when his pet turtle wanders away).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Real-Life TV Character Ordered to Stand Trial</TE>
<TE>   Three days before the Sunday premiere of "Sins of the Father," an
FX movie about the 1963 Sunday School bombings in Birmingham, Ala., a
federal judge has ruled that a lead character in the movie, Bobby
Frank Cherry, is mentally competent to stand trial.</TE>
<TE>   Circuit Judge James Garret reversed his previous decision Thursday
after Cherry--played by "Six Feet Under's" Richard Jenkins--underwent
a court-ordered 71-day period of evaluation and observation at the
state-run Taylor Hardin Secure Medical Facility. The finding, the
judge said, was based on legal briefs and on psychologist testimony
at a recent hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Cherry, who was indicted in 1999, was one of a group of Klansmen
under suspicion for the church explosion. The incident was the
deadliest attack in reaction to the civil rights movement, killing
four young girls.</TE>
<TE>   The movie, directed by Robert Dornhelm and written by John
Pielmeier, deals with the relationship between Cherry and his son
Tom, portrayed by Tom Sizemore, whose decision to testify led to his
dad's indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Garrett scheduled a Jan. 18 proceeding to set a trial date. Two
other men have been convicted of the crime--one who died in prison
and another who's appealing his sentence.</TE>
<TE>   (A story in Sunday's TV Times about the movie went to press before
the judge's decision and reports that the matter is still pending.)</TE>

<TE>   'McLaughlin Group' Moves to Public TV</TE>
<TE>   "The McLaughlin Group," dropped by KNBC, has been picked up by
public television's KCET, which will broadcast the half-hour program
at the same time, Saturdays at 6:30 p.m., beginning today.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, "The BookShow With Patt Morrison" will move to the
6-6:30 p.m. time slot and the U.K. version of "Antiques Roadshow"
will shift to 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The vociferous McLaughlin said he welcomed the move. "In the
public television version, commercials are removed for an additional
segment featuring back-of-the-book issues, most often culture-related
or entertainment-oriented, which should appeal to Southern
Californians," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The program, which celebrates its 20th anniversary in April, airs
on some 300 other public television stations nationwide. It will
continue to run on NBC-owned-and-operated stations in New York and
Washington, D.C.</TE>

<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   New Museum Planned for Southwest Paris</TE>
<TE>   Paris is adding another must-see attraction--an art museum that
promises to be Europe's boldest cultural project since Bilbao's
Guggenheim and London's Tate Modern, the Christian Science Monitor
reports.</TE>
<TE>   Francois Pinault, whose art collection includes 1,000 works by
masters such as Picasso, Warhol and Modigliani, picked 1995 Pritzger
Prize-winning Japanese architect Tadao Ando to design the trapezoidal
building, which he described as "a spacecraft suspended on the River
Seine."</TE>
<TE>   Called the Francois Pinault Contemporary Art Foundation, it will
house the largest private art collection in France and, according to
experts, one of the finest selections of contemporary art in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The $140-million structure--as big as the Pompidou Center and
twice as big as the Guggenheim Bilbao--will be built on an unused
Renault car factory site in southwestern Paris.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Ground Zero' Photos Headed for Skirball</TE>
<TE>   An exhibit of life-size "Faces of Ground Zero" opens Monday in New
York's Grand Central Station before a nationwide tour that includes a
stop in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit, sponsored by Time magazine and Morgan Stanley,
features 85 photographs taken by Life magazine veteran Joe McNally
using an enormous Polaroid camera that he set up near the World Trade
Center site after the Sept. 11 attacks. The photos--of firefighters,
trade center employees, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and
others--are tentatively scheduled to be displayed at Los Angeles'
Skirball Center from June 13 to July 9.</TE>

<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   Water Pipe Break Douses Guthrie Theater</TE>
<TE>   Minneapolis' Guthrie Theater was damaged this week when two pipes
broke--flooding administrative offices, dressing rooms, and
production and archival storage areas with about 55,000 gallons of
water.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had better days and we will again," the theater's artistic
director, Joe Dowling, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune as he
slopped through as much as 8 inches of water. "This is fortuitous
timing--I can't imagine what would happen if we had a show playing."</TE>
<TE>   Though design drawings, books and props were soaked, the thrust
stage and the house were not affected.</TE>
<TE>   The theater intends to build a complex near the Mississippi River
in downtown Minneapolis, which it plans to move into in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   "We've talked about the 'Guthrie on the River,'" quipped Dowling,
"but we didn't want the 'Guthrie in the River.'" A production of
"Anthony and Cleopatra" will open for previews Jan. 19 as scheduled,
he added.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What Theatergoers Really Need to Know</TE>
<TE>   In this week's New Yorker, Andy Borowitz takes aim at the often
useless announcements posted in theater lobbies.</TE>
<TE>   Here's part of his list of really important things about which
audiences should be advised.</TE>
<TE>   WARNING: Owing to a typographical error, The Times' review of this
play omitted the word "horrible."</TE>
<TE>   WARNING: When the curtain rises, you might be startled by the
sight of a former movie star's ravaged face.</TE>
<TE>   WARNING: During this afternoon's performance, there will be a
chatty women's group from Great Neck seated directly behind you.</TE>
<TE>   WARNING: In Act III, there is full frontal nudity, but not
involving the actor you would like to see naked.</TE>
<TE>   WARNING: The lead actor in tonight's play is a veteran of the
Royal Shakespeare Company who always showers the first five rows with
spittle.</TE>
<TE>   WARNING: Tom Stoppard found the play you're about to see
"confusing."</TE>
<TE>   WARNING: In interviews, the composer of tonight's long-delayed
musical has referred to it as both "a pet project" and a "labor of
love."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 12, the 13th annual Nortel Network Palm Springs
International Film Festival will honor actor Andy Garcia,
producer-director Irwin Winkler, director Arthur Hiller and composer
Hans Zimmer.... AIDS activist and author ("The Normal Heart") Larry
Kramer, 66, has been discharged from the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center, two weeks after the HIV-positive patient underwent a
liver transplant.... Beginning Jan. 21, news and sports commentator
Keith Olbermann will anchor "Speaking of Sports" and "Speaking of
Everything"--two shows launched more than 40 years ago by Howard
Cosell. The ABC Radio Network will air the former daily during drive
time and the latter every afternoon.</TE>

<HD>So Long Grand Ole Opry, Hello Sports?</HD>
<DH>Radio: Station that is 'committed' to country and has
broadcast the music for 76 years may switch formats. Its legendary
weekly show could live on in syndication.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM PATTERSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>The radio station that created the Grand Ole Opry and broadcast it
for 76 years may dump the country music format for sports.</LD>
<LD>   Sources within Gaylord Entertainment who spoke on condition of
anonymity say executives are strongly considering syndication of its
weekly Opry show, the longest continuously running music show in
radio. Gaylord would keep the rights to the show but sell it to other
stations for broadcast.</LD>
<LD>   That would leave the company free to switch the format for WSM-AM
radio--currently marketing itself with the slogan "Committed to
Country ... Always Have Been, Always Will Be"--to all sports.</LD>
<TE>   Gaylord executives met Thursday with employees, who were
instructed not to discuss details with reporters.</TE>
<TE>   They also set up two telephone lines to handle questions streaming
in from fans.</TE>
<TE>   Colin Reed, Gaylord's president and chief executive officer, said
no decision has been made.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not at a point yet that we have determined absolutely,
unequivocally we are going to migrate from classic country music on
WSM-AM at this stage," Reed said in Friday's editions of the
Tennessean. "At the end of the day we may not convert WSM-AM to
anything other than what it is today."</TE>
<TE>   Reed confirmed that the company has talked with ESPN about sports
programming but said no definitive agreement had been signed.</TE>
<TE>   WSM, founded in 1925, was one the nation's original clear-channel
stations--radio stations that have exclusive nationwide rights to a
given frequency. It was started to advertise insurance by the
National Life and Accident Insurance Co.--WSM stands for "We Shield
Millions."</TE>
<TE>   Originally, the station played mostly light classical and dance
band music. To the dismay of upper-class Nashville, a program
featuring folk fiddler Uncle Jimmy Thompson proved wildly popular.
The program first aired about a month after the station debuted, but
it didn't get the name Grand Ole Opry until 1927, a play on the Grand
Opera segment that preceded the show.</TE>
<TE>   The show grew to become the most influential in country music,
helping to make stars of Hank Williams Sr., Patsy Cline, Minnie Pearl
and scores of others.</TE>
<TE>   WSM's signal could be heard coast to coast at night for decades.
Today it reaches 38 states and is the last clear-channel station not
to convert to news, talk or sports.</TE>
<TE>   The company is in the midst of a major restructuring to focus on
its more profitable convention hotel and hospitality business.</TE>
<TE>   Gaylord announced a third-quarter loss of $45.1 million in
November, and it has sold several assets and closed divisions over
the past year, including two film divisions, a sports management
division and two record labels.</TE>
<TE>   Gaylord bought WSM, the Grand Ole Opry, TNN, Opryland and related
properties in 1983. Its other holdings include music publishing
companies and part of the Nashville Predators professional hockey
franchise.</TE>

Fonda as Steffie Furst, a major rock writer with a fearsome
reputation. Scheduled to stay four episodes, she wants to interview
Chris for a book about the late Roy Orbison. Although he initially
resists, they meet, they talk, they connect. Then afterward? Well,
this is cable.</LD>
<TE>   Country rocker Isaak has ditched the pompadour this season but not
his gentle, unmannered appeal as he begins embellishing his
friendship with Orbison to impress his attractive interviewer. No
comedy actors wear better than Isaak (he's actually pretty new at
this) and his gifted ensemble. And no show anywhere is more charming
or effortlessly amusing than this one, with Isaak playing a version
of himself supported by his actual Silvertone band, plus Jed Rees as
Anson, his keyboardist, and Kristin Dattilo as Yola, his manager.
When not laughing at them, you're smiling.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their adolescent angst, this trio is essentially sweet and
likable, and even tender, at least once each episode delivering a
level of poignancy that transcends comedy and reaches a higher place.</TE>
<TE>   The two new episodes sent for review are written by executive
producers Diane Frolov and Andrew Schneider. On Sunday, Silvertone
drummer Kenney Dale Johnson comes to regret letting Anson play
matchmaker for him with a gorgeous groupie. And Yola, formerly no
friend of dogs, instantly adores them to impress a hunky canine
psychologist she meets in an elevator and hopes to know intimately.
In her mind already with him under the sheets, she hopes to seal the
deal by acquiring a pooch. Of course, disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Her quest to plumb the thirtysomething male market is a real hoot.
The canine shrink turns out to be a little too much of a doggy
himself, unfortunately, and naturally this romance has no more future
than last season's crush on a sleep therapist.</TE>
<TE>   In this season's second episode, Anson finds himself distracted by
his formerly platonic colleague Yola when suddenly responding to her
in a primal way.</TE>
<TE>   He's a sort of idiot savant--whiz on the ivories, clod in
life--and for just a moment his eyes are Roman candles when settling
briefly on Yola's breasts. And this isn't Emmy-worthy?</TE>
<TE>   Minus the witty writing, this show goes nowhere. What drives the
first two episodes, also, is the direction from Milan Cheylov and Max
Tash, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   To say nothing of Isaak; that grand clown, Rees, who surely coifs
his hair with a Hoover; and the wonderful Dattilo, whose touch with
this droll, sophisticated humor is so subtle and delicate that you're
able to sense a lonely soul beneath Yola's exterior.</TE>
<TE>   With all of them stepping lightly, this is Showtime's best foot
forward.</TE>

<HD>Van Susteren to Media: Why the Fuss?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>APPLETON, Wis.</DL>
<LD>Lawyer and TV personality Greta Van Susteren has a question about the
news coverage over her upcoming job change: What's all the fuss?</LD>
<LD>   "It's been everything from the New York Times, USA Today, the New
York Post, the Washington Post, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,
we've had every newspaper call," she told the Post-Crescent of
Appleton, her hometown, in a telephone interview.</LD>
<LD>   "In some ways it's sort of silly. I'm changing jobs, and I've got
the entire media looking at it as though there's something sinister
or bizarre about it. I'm just changing jobs."</LD>
<TE>   Van Susteren, a CNN legal analyst during the O.J. Simpson trials,
had until recently been host of "The Point," a weeknight show created
for her, and co-host of the daytime legal program "Burden of Proof."</TE>
<TE>   With her move to Fox News Channel, plans call for her to be host
of a nightly talk show starting sometime after Feb. 1, depending on
when CNN decides to release her from her contract.</TE>

<HD>Return of Showtime's Gay Soap</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's difficult to understand how a show as wildly uneven as "Queer as
Folk" can be so compulsively watchable, yet somehow, it is.</LD>
<LD>   A gay soap opera that grooves to a dance-floor beat, the program
quickly developed last year into the Showtime cable network's
most-watched series and one of television's biggest surprises. It
begins its second season Sunday night at 10, shortly after "Sex and
the City," the HBO series to which it is often compared, returns with
new episodes.</LD>
<LD>   Last season reached a cliffhanger as Michael (Hal Sparks) moved
out of town with a partner and his buddy Brian (Gale Harold) raced in
too late to prevent an attack on his younger, on-again, off-again
boyfriend, Justin (Randy Harrison).</LD>
<TE>   Sunday's episode finds Michael back home in Pittsburgh, as both he
and Brian cope with the fallout from those events.</TE>
<TE>   Like so many episodes before it, this one--written by series
developers Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman--veers between quietly
effective drama and lurid visions of bare, buff men engaged in
whatever activities Showtime's "no limits" corporate attitude will
allow.</TE>
<TE>   Many questions hover over the series as it moves beyond the story
line set down in the British series on which it is based. In
particular: Will the show begin to depict the gay and lesbian
community in all its diversity? Or will it continue to focus on the
dance, drugs and sex crowd?</TE>
<TE>   Promisingly, the series' most stable couple, lesbian moms Lindsay
(Thea Gill) and Melanie (Michelle Clunie), seem to be getting more
screen time, as is Michael's rainbow-flag-waving, hug-dispensing mom,
Debbie (Sharon Gless).</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the show remains as confused, conflicted--and
improbably entertaining--as ever.</TE>

<HD>It's a Jampacked Sunday Night on Cable</HD>
<DH>The evening is crammed with new programming and season
premieres. Not all of the offerings are great, but some are
especially noteworthy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WERTS</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What is it about Jan. 6? Every TV channel seems to have high-profile
shows there. Because it's the first Sunday of the year? Because the
midseason series haven't started? Premiere now and avoid the rush?</LD>
<LD>   From a potent truth-based movie to a dud series debut, Sunday
seems to be cable's winter version of the networks' fall preview
week, crammed into one night. Let's take it from the top (of the
quality heap), and you'll see why cable keeps eating into network
audience shares.</LD>
<LD>   "Sins of the Father" (Sunday at 8 and 10 p.m. on FX). This
rerun-laden channel makes only a few movies a year, but they're
always worth a look. This emotional stunner essentially takes place
inside its lead character's head--and heart--but it's more vividly
visualized than most any movie you'll see.</LD>
<TE>   Tom Sizemore ("Saving Private Ryan's" Sgt. Horvath) brings
anguished depth to an inexpressive average guy around whom revolves
the tangled tale of the racially charged 1963 Birmingham church
bombing that killed four little girls. As the son of a white truck
driver long suspected in the crime, he's forced 35 years later to
confront not only his father's alleged involvement but also the more
personal impact of the hate that provoked it.</TE>
<TE>   Much as HBO's "Shot in the Heart" explored the family dynamics
behind killer Gary Gilmore, "Sins of the Father" pieces together
fragments of memory to form a graphic portrait of hindsight and
transformation. Sizemore's character is building a house for his
estranged, aged father (the scarily coiled Richard Jenkins) when onto
the scene arrives black construction worker Ving Rhames. As their
1990s friendship also builds, Sizemore reexamines whether he is
indeed a "chip off the old block," wondering why the law continues
its "witch hunt against a sick old man."</TE>
<TE>   Past scenes woven into the present include some newsreels and
reenactments. But they more strikingly resurrect the angry household
that helped fuel such '60s malice. Amid Dad's rage, Mom's pain and
children trapped in the maelstrom, there's soul corrosion that seems
destined to be perpetuated--until Sizemore sizes it up to realize,
simply, "This has just got to stop."</TE>
<TE>   "The It Factor" (Sunday at 6 and 9 p.m. on Bravo). A reality show
that seems real? No contrived games, no cheesy hosts? Just real-life
stakes that matter. "The It Factor" tracks the career travails of 12
young New York actors of various backgrounds and accomplishment.
Sunday's premiere half-hour condenses auditions for the series:
Hundreds of aspirants meet casting directors in a visceral depiction
of the numbers game nearly all are going to lose.</TE>
<TE>   Next week is when we really start to get to know the chosen dozen
and their acting lives. One practices a single line of TV guest-shot
dialogue over and over, hoping for the gig so desperately that it
looms like a Broadway lead. Who'd have thought actors would be the
most "real" people in unscripted TV?</TE>
<TE>   "The Division" (Sunday at 9 p.m. on Lifetime). This cop hour is
sometimes so good, it's all the more frustrating when it isn't. As
the second season begins, the walking disaster played by Nancy McKeon
returns to San Francisco detective work from involuntary rehab,
itching to alienate everybody connected to a job she can barely face
without alcohol. As Capt. Bonnie Bedelia is pressured by a political
new superior, interagency squabbles intrude in murder cases close to
the detectives' hearts.</TE>
<TE>   Heart is a big thing on Lifetime, which is a good thing,
emphasizing inner life over plot machinations. But its prominence so
overshadows these cases that they're barely perfunctory. At least
this season there's a male partner (Jon Hamm) joining the too-female
squad and a shell-shocked rookie (Taraji P. Henson) to contrast with
their seen-it-all expertise.</TE>
<TE>   "ER" fans also get some dramatic muscle-flexing from "Division"
cops Lisa Vidal (Weaver's latest attraction on NBC) and Troy Evans
(irascible hospital deskman Frank).</TE>
<TE>   "Oz" (Sunday at 10 p.m. on HBO). More lighthearted fun--not. The
prison has survived the explosion that freed Luke Perry's
televangelist from the bricked-in wall but left him frightfully
mangled. Harold Perrineau's inmate narrator invokes legendary
prisoners Thomas Paine and Oscar Wilde to update what has previously
taken place and may yet occur on TV's most brutal series. Its
hard-core following can have this fifth season of eight episodes. The
rest of us will at best admire the earnest work of producer Tom
Fontana ("Homicide") without braving its nasty outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "Conspiracy Zone" (Sunday at 9 p.m. on TNN). Just when cable seems
competitive with the networks, along comes a series embarrassingly
retro-cheap and maladroit. That definition would fit most anything
original on the "new" TNN, but especially this dreary half-hour of
comedian Kevin Nealon leading aimless chat about tabloid paranoia.
First up, "Man Show" loudmouth Adam Carolla and "Batman" Adam West
debate privacy threats in our surveillance society.</TE>
<TE>   "Baby Blues" (Sunday at 10:30 p.m. on Cartoon Network). Based on
the family-life comic strip, this slight but amiable animation has
segued from the WB (where its audience was also slight) to the apt
habitat of Cartoon's Adult Swim block for grown-ups.</TE>
<TE>   (Editor's note: Sunday also brings the season premiere of "Sex and
the City" on HBO, which Howard Rosenberg reviewed in Friday's
Calendar; "The Chris Isaak Show" on Showtime, which he reviews on F1
today; and "Queer as Folk," which is reviewed by Daryl H. Miller on
F32 today.)</TE>

<HD>Thompson Leaves Art Center Post</HD>
<DH>Gallery: No successor yet named to succeed the director of

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The director of the Orange County Center for Contemporary Art
resigned Jan. 1. Citing personal reasons, Barbara Thompson left the
volunteer position after serving since April 2000. Thompson plans to
work on exhibition installations and curatorial projects. No new
director has been named.</LD>
<LD>   She will remain an active member of the 22-year-old nonprofit,
artist-run co-op gallery. The center was closed in December for
refurbishing and repairs. It reopens today with a members' show,
followed midmonth by an Orange County High School of the Arts student
exhibition.</LD>

<TE>   Naomi Vine Services Scheduled Friday</TE>
<TE>   Memorial services for Naomi Vine, founding director of the Orange
County Museum of Art, will be at 10 a.m. Friday at St. Barnabas
Church, 3955 Orange Ave., Long Beach. Cardinal Roger M. Mahony will
officiate.</TE>
<TE>   Vine died Dec. 24 of a brain tumor. She was 52 and is survived by
her husband, Albert Milano, and son, Victor, 11.</TE>
<TE>   The museum will close until noon that day to allow staff and
volunteers to attend the service. In lieu of flowers, donations may
be made to the Naomi Vine Memorial Fund at the Orange County Museum
of Art, 850 San Clemente Drive, Newport Beach, Calif. 92660.</TE>

<TE>   Laguna Beach Art Groups Form Alliance</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, a bitter merger attempt involving the Laguna Art Museum
almost left the city without its landmark institution. Three years
later Pageant of the Masters threatened to move to San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   Now Laguna Beach arts groups have joined forces in a new,
nonprofit advocacy organization.</TE>
<TE>   The Laguna Beach Arts Alliance comprises two dozen members,
including the Art Institute of Southern California, Laguna Art
Museum, Sawdust Art Festival, Festival of Arts, Laguna Playhouse,
Laguna Beach Film Festival, California Choreographers Dance Festival,
Music in the Park Inc., and Seven-Degrees multimedia gallery. Each
voting member organization pays an annual fee of $100.</TE>
<TE>   The alliance serves to ensure that the arts are included in city
planning decisions, members say, and it is a way to take a stand on
issues concerning the arts.</TE>

<TE>   Irvine Museum Presents California History Book</TE>
<TE>   The history of California from 1453 to the 1870s is illustrated in
"California, This Golden Land of Promise." Coauthored by Joan Irvine
Smith and Jean Stern of The Irvine Museum, the 368-page book contains
405 color paintings and drawings and 88 black-and-white etchings,
prints and sketches from 50 collections in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Museum published the volume with Chapman University and
it satisfies the state's public school curriculum requirement for
history in the fourth grade. All Orange County schools may request a
free copy, Stern said. Twenty thousand copies are in print.</TE>
<TE>   The book is filled with detail, such as the information that the
austere life of missionary Junipero Serra included common practices
of penance. He would whip himself, put a torch to his chest or beat
his chest with a stone at the end of his sermons. The timeline of
California and world events offers highlights of noteworthy moments
in history. A book-signing and slide presentation by the authors will
be Feb. 10 at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art.</TE>
<TE>   Several paintings in the books are among the collection at The
Irvine Museum, 18881 Von Karman Ave., Irvine. The museum will move
its 12th floor office suite and gallery to the ground level lobby,
which has a larger exhibition space.</TE>

<TE>   Dead Sea Scroll Exhibition Closing</TE>
<TE>   Museum-goers who have not seen "The Holy Land: David Roberts, Dead
Sea Scrolls, House of David Inscription" exhibition at Bowers Museum
of Cultural Art have until Wednesday. Hours have been extended for
the remainder of the run, with the museum open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
today through Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The companion display, "World of the Etruscans," has been extended
through April 21. The exhibition brings together 335 objects from
2,000 years ago, including elaborate sarcophagi, bronze helmets,
lifelike terracotta statues and gold jewelry. The show is curated by
Daniel Virtuoso for the Centro Affari e Convegni in Arezzo, Italy,
and comes to the United States for the first time after it was
recently shown at El Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Santiago,
Chile.</TE>

<TE>   Laguna Pageant Holds Casting Call</TE>
<TE>   The Pageant of the Masters is holding a casting call for its 2002
show, "Heroes and Heroines." Men, women and children of all sizes and
agesare invited to apply to become volunteer actors for the
living-pictures presentation held from July through August.
Prospective volunteers will be measured and photographed. The only
requirement is the ability to stand very still.</TE>
<TE>   Casting calls will be held today from 7 to 9 p.m., Sunday from 2
to 5 p.m. and Thursday from 7 to 9 p.m. backstage at the Irvine Bowl,
650 Laguna Canyon Road. Students can earn credit toward community
service requirements by volunteering. Information: (949) 494-3663.</TE>

<TE>   Art Institute Offers Student Scholarships</TE>
<TE>   The Art Institute of Los Angeles-Orange County is offering
$375,000 in scholarships to students willing to compete in two
contests: the National Culinary Scholarship Cook-off and the National
Portfolio Review.</TE>
<TE>   High school seniors may be awarded as much as $190,000 for school
when they submit a notebook of information, including a two-course
menu, recipes, photographs of each course and a cost analysis of the
menu. Participants will also be asked for to write a paragraph about
why they want to enter the culinary profession. They must also submit
a resume, transcripts and a letter of recommendation. Ten of the best
submissions from Orange County will be invited to a regional
cook-off.</TE>
<TE>   The National Portfolio Competition calls for high school student
entries that include a 35mm slide showing a sample of art work in any
medium.</TE>
<TE>   There are three phases for this contest and 10 of the best entries
will be selected to submit a portfolio of five pieces in the
categories of life drawing, illustration, advertising and two others.
More details and an application form are available on the school's
Web site, www.artinstitutes.edu/pv.</TE>
<TE>   The deadline for both contests is Feb. 15.</TE>
<TE>   The competitions are part of a larger national event in which
winners will earn full and partial tuition scholarships to attend the
Art Institute system of schools throughout the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Information: (714) 830-0200 or (888) 549-3055.</TE>

<TE>   Grant Will Promote Art in Classrooms</TE>
<TE>   A $149,400 grant from the California Arts Council will go to Arts
Orange County to support a visual arts education program in the Santa
Ana Unified School District. The grant is part of a $10-million state
effort to promote arts programs in public schools.</TE>
<TE>   Elementary school students will benefit from hands-on art
demonstrations under the "Artists in the Schools" program.</TE>
<TE>   The grant will allow for the hiring and training of two visual
artists, Diane Aoki and Maria Trujillo, to work with teachers Cheryl

<HD>Take an Extended Holiday From Gun Violence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NIKO MILONOPOULOS and THEO MILONOPOULOS</AU>
<BD>Niko and Theo Milonopoulos, 15-year-old twins, are the
cofounders of Kidz Voice-LA and ninth-graders at Campbell Hall High
School in North Hollywood.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many Los Angeles kids have been saved from gun violence by a
decade-old city ordinance that prohibits gun dealers from selling
ammunition over the holidays.</LD>
<LD>   The holiday ammunition ban, which halts the sale of thousands of
bullets from Christmas Day through New Year's Day, is a welcome
reprieve in a city where more than 50 kids are shot to death each
year.</LD>
<LD>   In late November and early December alone, gun violence claimed
the lives of 16-month-old Bryan Angel Tolentino in Boyle Heights as
he sat in his car seat; 13-year-old Marquese Rashad Prude as he stood
in a South Los Angeles recreation center; 15-year-old Santiago
Polanco of Sun Valley as he walked outside his school; and
16-year-old Sean Cochran and 19-year-old Anthony Caldwell as they
rode their bikes in the Jefferson Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Why is it so difficult to get the City Council to extend the
holiday ammunition ban to a year-round ban?</TE>
<TE>   After all, according to the city's 1999-2000 Legislative Policy on
Gun Violence Reduction, Los Angeles "supports all efforts ... that
would achieve total gun control." The policy says that the city
"sponsors and supports legislation that would enable local
jurisdictions to have control over guns within the city limits."</TE>
<TE>   A year-round citywide ban on the sale of ammunition would save the
city millions of dollars in health care, emergency services and
criminal-related court and prison costs, which come into effect each
time someone is shot.</TE>
<TE>   According to the American Medical Assn., taxpayers pay an average
of $17,000 per gun injury.</TE>
<TE>   Cities such as Chicago and Washington, D.C., not only ban the sale
of all ammunition and guns but also prohibit an individual from
possessing these tools of destruction within their city limits.</TE>
<TE>   With a ban on the sale of ammunition in effect year-round,
law-abiding individuals still would be able to purchase guns in Los
Angeles and keep ammunition in their homes. The real difference would
be that ammunition would be less accessible.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 7, Councilmen Nick Pacheco and Eric Garcetti introduced a
motion to ban the sale of all gun ammunition citywide throughout the
year. The initiative was sent to the Public Safety Committee. The
proposal stalled as City Hall focused on protecting Angelenos from
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Metal detectors and concrete barricades have been added at the
entrance of City Hall to ensure the safety of city leaders. Now it is
time for city leaders to focus on ending the urban terrorism that is
killing L.A. kids.</TE>
<TE>   With nearly 1,000 guns sold in California each day, eradicating
gun violence in Los Angeles is a most difficult and complex task, but
making ammunition less accessible is certainly an easy step in the
right direction.</TE>
<TE>   And if the year-round ammunition ban could have saved the life of
Bryan, Marquese, Santiago, Sean or Anthony, wouldn't it have been
worth it?</TE>

<HD>Peas, Toothpicks and the Loss of Creative Play</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>ARTHUR TOBIAS</AU>
<BD>Arthur Tobias teaches art in an area high school.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I picked up a miniature toy scooter outside my house the other day.
It had lost a tiny part and appeared to have been abandoned by the
neighbor boy while at play with my two sons. It is an attractively
constructed device just the right size for a pet mouse to ride. The
machined and cast metal surfaces gleam with precision. The little red
plastic wheels turn with ease. As an older boy, I can understand its
lure. As an adult and educator, I am cautious of its promise.</LD>
<LD>   I became aware of another cunningly constructed play object during
the consumer season just past. It comes from a company originally
known for completely generic, small modular building blocks.</LD>
<LD>   This current production is just the opposite. Its many little
parts are unique and particular. One almost hates to take it apart.
Its cunningly constructed puzzle offers up the genius of the designer
who created it and locks out the genius of the children to whom it is
marketed. This clever consumer play device is closed-ended. There is
nowhere for the creative imagination to go with it. All the fun work
has already been done. The growing mind can only live in awe of those
who make such devices. There is no creative play.</LD>
<TE>   Friedrich Froebel had a better idea. He's the fellow who invented
kindergarten 170 years ago. His ideas, considered revolutionary in
some circles, quickly spread around the globe. The mother of one lad
became attracted to the movement when she saw a demonstration
kindergarten on the grounds of the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition
in 1876. Frank Lloyd Wright would recall in later years the
significant influence that Froebel's simple shapes had on his
formative years.</TE>
<TE>   In the Froebel system, children became engaged in creative play
with extremely simple objects.</TE>
<TE>   Among the more complex play sets that Froebel designed was a small
box of toothpicks and peas. When the peas were wet any number of
toothpicks could be inserted at various angles. In old photographs
one sees large and complex constructions of bridges, towers and
cranes from these simple elements.</TE>
<TE>   The kindergarten movement's creative play objects were
manufactured and marketed by a number of companies, some of whose
names are still familiar. By the end of the 1800s, as the movement
spread and Froebel's message of creative play was watered down, the
marketed items became increasingly complex. The plain maple cylinders
and cubes became elaborate columns and door frames for architectural
play. The peas became wooden cookies with a set numbers of holes at
fixed angles. Play became constrained by the adult world.</TE>
<TE>   Designing worthwhile play for children requires adult constraint,
and yes, a measure of creativity. It is all too easy to let market
forces overwhelm the simple nature of truly open-ended play objects.
After all, how much of a brand name can you build selling sets of
toothpicks and peas?</TE>
<TE>   Yet it is in avoiding the clamor of the cleverly constructed,
closed-ended confections that tug at our children from screen and
billboard that we hold out the promise of creative play: to build
young minds.</TE>
<TE>   So as I collect the various little plastic and metal parts of this
year's toys scattered in the driveway, I think I will head to the
store and look for a bag of peas and a box of toothpicks.</TE>

<LD>Polls show the U.S. public stands firmly behind the war on terrorism,
but who will stand with Julia Zepeda? It didn't take an international
terrorist to upend her life, just a trio of home-grown ones.</LD>
<LD>   Zepeda's daughter died the day after Christmas as she waited in a
pickup truck with a friend outside a Hawthorne apartment while the
driver went inside to retrieve a gift. Neighbors saw two young men
chasing another and heard shots--an all-too-common sound. Police
believe Leslie Zepeda was caught in gang cross-fire. She was 11 years
old.</LD>
<LD>   Eleven years old. A Times photograph captured the toll of this
domestic war. There stood the family Christmas tree, unwrapped
toys--a doll, a Santa, a daypack--not yet put away. There sat Julia
Zepeda on the edge of the couch, hands clasped, head bowed, face
sculpted by sorrow.</LD>
<TE>   Who will stand with Sharon Johnson? Her 18-year-old son, Andre
Morgan, was walking to a friend's house in Inglewood after basketball
practice when he was shot multiple times by a gunman, who then got
into a car that had been waiting. Morgan was not mixed up with gangs.
He was an honors student and a basketball player who had his eye on
playing for UCLA. He died a week before he was to take his SATs.
Inglewood City Councilwoman Judy Dunlap said that in 2001 a killing
occurred in Inglewood every eight days.</TE>
<TE>   Every eight days. In Central Los Angeles, gang members stopped
Esteban Ortiz, 21, as he walked down East Manchester Avenue and
demanded to know which gang he was from. It didn't matter that he
didn't belong to any gang. They attacked him, and when his
19-year-old brother, Arturo, and their 18-year-old friend Jesus Silva
ran to his aid, the gang members opened fire. Estaban was wounded,
his brother and friend killed. It was 11 days shy of Christmas, and
Esteban and Arturo's mother, Bertha Sanchez, hasn't stopped crying.
Who will stand with her?</TE>
<TE>   It took an act of international terrorism on U.S. soil to make
many Americans feel vulnerable for the first time in their lives. For
residents of some of Southern California's poorer neighborhoods, it
just takes getting up in the morning. When will the rest of us say
this cannot stand?</TE>

<HD>Forest Plan: Let It Be</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a flip-flop that is either a sign of blatant cynicism by the Bush
administration or one boneheaded career move, a U.S. Forest Service
bureaucrat has launched a "broad review" of a landmark plan for the
forests of the Sierra Nevada--just days after his boss at the
Department of Agriculture approved it.</LD>
<LD>   The Sierra Nevada framework is a sound approach to the long-range
management of more than 11 million acres of national forest on behalf
of the forests' owners, the people of the United States. It is the
product of 10 years of intense scientific study, analysis and public
comment. The goal is to manage the forest to protect old-growth areas
that endangered and threatened species call home and to guard the
Sierra against further damage by logging and livestock grazing. The
plan would reduce commercial logging by as much as 80%, which is one
reason why timber interests vehemently protested it.</LD>
<LD>   Now it appears that the Forest Service is once again selling out
to the tree cutters as well as to ranchers and off-road vehicle
groups. But these are the people's forests and should be managed with
a broader view of the legacy that will be left to future generations.</LD>
<TE>   The decision by recently appointed Regional Forester Jack
Blackwell to bog down the exhaustively pondered plan with still more
study came on New Year's Eve, just four days after Mark Rey, the
undersecretary of Agriculture, approved it.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, in what seemed a show of sincere support, the
Washington-based chief of the U.S. Forest Service, Dale Bosworth,
rejected attacks on the plan. He did leave open to review its
recommendations for controlling wildfires near populated, developed
areas--a reasonable proposal for flexibility.</TE>
<TE>   Blackwell, however, went far beyond that, telling Bosworth that he
has established a team "to review the entire record," including
impacts on logging, grazing and local communities. Blackwell
explained in detail his reasons for reviewing the fire protection
plans but provided no justification whatever for reopening other
matters.</TE>
<TE>   While it would be nice to hear his rationale, what's really needed
is for someone to tell Blackwell to back off. If that doesn't happen
promptly, environmental groups should launch a court challenge based
on the reasonable conclusion that this about-face must be a trick by
an administration that's eager to return forest management to the bad
old days of rape and run.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The ouster of the Taliban from Afghanistan has produced an important
side effect for neighboring Uzbekistan, removing a sanctuary for
Islamic fundamentalist warriors challenging the repressive government
of Islam Karimov. The Uzbek president--a holdover from Soviet rule of
his land and a man apparently bent on staying as leader until he
dies--should take advantage of an improved security situation by
loosening the political reins.</LD>
<LD>   Uzbekistan is the pivot of Central Asia, a region of former Soviet
republics that are desperately poor despite their deposits of oil and
gas. It has outlawed even the most moderate Islamic political
movements and in the process turned some groups that might have
become the loyal opposition into potentially violent foes. The
government designates religious leaders and requires religious
organizations to register, in effect deciding who can preach and who
cannot. By not developing political institutions, Uzbekistan is
setting itself up for an ugly payback down the road.</LD>
<TE>   When the Soviet Union disintegrated a decade ago, residents in the
five former republics hoped for political liberalization, religious
freedom and economic improvement with the removal of the shackles of
central planning. Instead, the leaders then are the leaders now and
the Soviet-style bureaucracy continues its mismanagement. The area is
predominantly Muslim, but Uzbekistan and the other nations are
secular and worry about militant Islam.</TE>
<TE>   The argument against liberalization has been the need for
security. But the quick ouster of the Taliban has removed one source
of danger and has discredited Islamic fundamentalists throughout the
region.</TE>
<TE>   Karimov is more secure now and should allow a free press,
legitimate opposition political parties and the unrestricted
operation of human rights groups. There's a lesson to be learned from
Pakistan, where Islamic political parties have done terribly at the
polls but have gained influence in the mosques and religious schools
when secular governments and political organizations have proved
feeble or corrupt. Like Afghanistan and Pakistan, Uzbekistan needs
dramatic economic progress to lift the terrible poverty that helps
fuel extremist movements.</TE>
<TE>   Of the five central republics, Uzbekistan has most distanced
itself from Russia, which still considers the region part of its area
of influence. Even before Sept. 11, Karimov looked to the United
States as a counterweight to Moscow. Now Washington has even greater
influence because it has removed a major source of danger to
Uzbekistan. It should encourage Karimov to improve the lives of his
people, not just tighten his grip on power.</TE>
<TE>   U.S.-financed Radio Free Europe did a good job in December in
helping persuade a Czech court not to send back to Uzbekistan
Mukhammat Salikh, who ran against Karimov for president in 1991 and
two years later fled the country out of realistic fear for his life.
Washington must stay focused on Central Asia, beyond Afghanistan, to
help prevent nations from disintegrating into failed states that are
fertile ground for terrorism.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "A Wave of Patriotism on Parade in Pasadena," Jan. 2: I witnessed
the breakdown of the "Guiding Good Times" float, the first-time entry
of Guide Dogs for the Blind, during Pasadena's Tournament of Roses
parade, and was struck by the irony that a tow truck was needed to
"lead" the stricken float to safety. I was also saddened to read that
the float did not complete the parade route, especially since two of
its riders--Michael Hingson and his guide dog Roselle--had
successfully escaped from the 78th floor of the World Trade Center
back on Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   Given their ordeal, it seems obvious that Hingson and Roselle
should be invited back to ride in next year's parade. I'd think
Tournament officials would be eager to demonstrate that "floating"
down Colorado Boulevard on New Year's Day is far easier than a blind
person's escape from a high-rise fire.</LD>

<LD>Regarding ''Principal Plays to Student Potential, Not Failure,'' Jan.
2: I find it outrageous that Jordan High School Principal Dhyan Lal
considers the use of ethnic slurs to be an appropriate way to use
''humor as a way of easing tension.'' I doubt that the racially toned
comments made by Lal would be tolerated in the private sector; in
fact, such comments would likely provide sufficient grounds for
dismissal at any company with a basic
anti-discrimination/anti-harassment policy.</LD>
<LD>   Certainly, Lal should be held to the highest standards of moral
and ethical behavior, as he is a role model for the students and
teachers with whom he comes in contact on a daily basis. Based on his
unusual approach to ''humor,'' I do not believe that he meets such
standards, regardless of how ''innovative'' his educational approach
may be.</LD>

<LD>Re ''Jeffords Explains Why He Quit the GOP,'' letters, Jan. 2:</LD>
<LD>   It is very hard to apply logic to the shallow reasoning of people
blasting Sen. James Jeffords of Vermont; they act as if an elected
official does not have the right to go against his party. I'm sure
many of those same individuals were delightedly mute when the
Dixiecrats (mostly elected Democrats) spurned their own party.</LD>
<LD>   When I go into a voting booth (even though I am registered with a
particular party) I do not feel that I must vote for only people of
that party--that is blatantly ridiculous and, in my book, decidedly
un-American.</LD>

<LD>Re "Big Cars, Shrinking Glaciers," editorial, Dec. 29: Recognition of
global warming by the public is a first step and will occur only via
the media. Unfortunately, reducing automobile consumption, although
helpful, is not enough. Energy consumption and standard of living are
undeniably correlated, and the United States is the world leader in
fossil-fuel-based energy consumption. Other parts of the world, like
China and India, want to catch up. The only answer to global warming
(shrinking glaciers) will be another form of energy production.</LD>
<LD>   Suggestions like using hydrogen-based fuel cells will not help if
the hydrogen is produced by fossil-fuel-based energy. Other forms of
energy, like solar and wind energy, are not available in sufficient
quantities except for, God forbid, nuclear fusion or fission, and
only nuclear fission is available today. Society will have to make a
choice between global warming, its standard of living and its
misguided views of the risks of nuclear power.</LD>

<TE>   Your editorial notes that due in part to carbon dioxide emissions,
Montana's Glacier National Park will likely have no glaciers within
the next 30 years. But this glacial retreat is not new or big-car
connected.</TE>
<TE>   The Little Ice Age reached its maximum extent here about 1750,
when general melting began. By 1879, John Muir found that the ice had
already retreated 48 miles up Alaska's Glacier Bay. By 1916, the
retreat was 65 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Today, while some glaciers are retreating, two west-side glaciers
are actually advancing. The source: the National Park Service's
Official Guide and Map for Glacier Bay. The point: None of this could
have been caused by man, let alone by carbon dioxide from cars. The
advice: Stop global whining.</TE>

<LD>Joel Beinin calls for vigorous debate in time of war (Opinion, Dec.
30). I agree. We are at war and we need to concentrate our minds on
destroying Al Qaeda. Debate over our enemies' motivation, resources
and probable actions will help us to that end. However, Beinin seems
to think the debate should be one-sided. He asks us to question
prevailing wisdom, but when members of the American Council of
Trustees and Alumni question the prevailing wisdom of university
faculties, he labels them McCarthyites. This is not a defense of his
position. It is an ad hominem attack designed to silence and
marginalize his critics. He will not lose his job over his
declaration that the U.S. should bring Osama bin Laden before an
international court of justice for his crimes.</LD>
<LD>   Professors will continue to make feckless remarks about war aims
or mischaracterize our motivation (that we are pursuing a "racist"
war). But, please, professor, don't try to stifle your critics. Try
to understand that we are engaged in a deadly serious enterprise.
Your critics are pointing out that you are not helping. If you think
the contrary, defend your position and show why you are not a "weak
link."</LD>

<TE>   Oceanside</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere does Beinin show that dissent or vigorous questioning for
its own sake is more than intellectually and morally neutral. Far
more important is an actual search for truth in disputable questions.
For while dissent and endless questioning can equally distinguish a
bratty 3-year-old and a Socrates--the former after power, the latter
truth--Beinin glosses right over these differences. He himself shows
little inclination to question the "prevailing wisdom" among the
leftist wing of the professoriat. Instead, he goes after the usual
suspects (Republicans, etc.), safe targets that surely will not
affect his popularity among his students or his fellows. If Beinin
were to engage in a true dialectic, he'd mention the pitfalls of mere
posturing and the ease with which vanity or flashy covers for
not-very-attractive agendas may be mistaken for high-minded dissent.</TE>

<TE>   It is no accident that Beinin refers to the atmosphere of the Cold
War. One of the main features of the Cold War was that it completely
cut off American intellectual life from the global culture of dissent
outside the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe. This lack of knowledge or
consciousness has been particularly harmful to Americans regarding
the Middle East, where intellectuals, almost by definition, are
dissidents and provide information and insight into their societies
that is unavailable elsewhere. We have begun to regain knowledge
about that world only recently, thanks in great part to scholars such
as Beinin.</TE>
<TE>   The shortsightedness of trying to silence such voices seems yet
another self-inflicted wound upon the body politic. The vicious kinds
of insinuation spread by the American Council of Trustees and Alumni
are deeply anti-democratic. What is needed is free and open debate.</TE>

<TE>   Amen to Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman's Dec. 30 Opinion piece detailing
the virulent anti-Americanism that informs most teaching in higher
education. What is truly unfortunate, however, is that these
purveyors of "blame America first, last and always" at the university
level are preaching to the choir. By the time students emerge from 12
years of public education they are exquisitely sensitive to every
nuance of racism, sexism and imperialism in American history, albeit
unable to write a coherent paragraph about any of them. Most of my
U.S. history students have it all figured out long before they step
into the classroom: America is rotten to the core.</TE>
<TE>   Ask about the Constitution and they can virtually respond in
unison, "A racist document written by rich white men." The Westward
movement? A genocidal march driven by capitalist greed and a
patriarchy intent upon raping the land, slaughtering natives and
exploiting minorities and women. They are utterly convinced that in
all of human history the U.S. is the only country to have practiced
slavery. Of course, there are exceptions, but Hoffman's call for a
balanced view of American history is nonetheless a generation
overdue.</TE>

<LD>Re "Road to Mideast Solution Starts Elsewhere," Commentary, Dec. 31:
Barry Strauss shows how the true foes of Israel are not the
Palestinians but their sympathetic neighbors, such as Syria, Iraq and
Iran.</LD>
<LD>   However, rather than wage a military attack on every nation that
supports the Palestinians, as Strauss advocates, a more lasting
solution would be for Israel to end its 34-year military occupation
of Palestinian homelands.</LD>
<LD>   If that happened, support for Mideast dictators would dry up
because their primary persuasion issue would evaporate. If the U.S.
wages war on every nation that sympathizes with the Palestinians
cause, we would have to fight almost every nation in the world except
Israel.</LD>

<TE>   Was the unfortunate juxtaposition of that ridiculous cartoon by

clearly laid out, ultimate salutary benefits not only for Israel and
for the U.S. but for the entire free world would result from military
action against the despotic regimes in Iraq, Iran and Syria that
house, train and finance terrorist organizations in a number of
countries.</TE>

who feel, perhaps, that a little more "diplomacy" could do the trick.</TE>

<TE>   Once again, Yasser Arafat asserts that he desires peace (Jan. 1).
All he wants is a country of his own, with Jerusalem as its capital,
including the Old City. Prior to 1967, when the Old City was under
Palestinian (since Jordan is in fact part of Palestine) control, most
of the Jewish quarter was deliberately destroyed. Tombstones from the
Jewish cemetery were looted to pave highways, and Jews were denied
access to the Western Wall, their holiest site. But after the
Israelis liberated the city, they respected and maintained Islamic
mosques and shrines.</TE>
<TE>   Given the fact that Mecca and Medina are under Muslim control, and
given their past record of disrespect for the religions of others,
the Palestinians may deserve a country of their own, but they have
relinquished any right to the Old City of Jerusalem.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Physician specialists increasingly refuse to drop what they are
doing to care for strangers in emergency rooms" read a subhead to
your Column One on Dec. 29. The article was a frightening but not
surprising report on what is going wrong with health care. "Cases
Reveal Lapses in Kaiser Emergency Care" (Jan. 2) reports on failures
within the HMO emergency health care system. Kaiser provides fine
health care to a vast number of patients statewide; you unfairly
distort the rate of poor results.</LD>
<LD>   My husband is a surgical specialist, my brother a cardiologist and
my daughter an RN midwife. All go forth each day to deliver the best
health care possible. But California's health care system places
unreasonable burdens upon its providers: excessive patient loads and
risk of litigation combined with inadequate compensation and
resources. My husband happily moved his medical practice from L.A. to
Ohio in 1995, but senses the frustration of his colleagues in
California.</LD>
<LD>   There is another scary element in the health care equation.
Research shows that America's best medical schools are seeing a
decline in both the quantity and quality of applicants. Just as the
teaching profession faces public blame and looming shortages, beware
of the effect of public policies upon the pool of physicians.</LD>

<TE>   What's painfully clear is that cops don't arrest cops, lawyers
don't sue lawyers and doctors don't report other doctors, regardless
of how horrendous the negligence or malpractice. Until the white wall
is broken, the quality or lack of medical care in the emergency room
will be held hostage by the egos of the specialists on call. The
Hippocratic oath is an oath of ethical professional behavior sworn by
all physicians, not a guarantee of personal wealth or personal
recognition.</TE>

<TE>   The reluctance of specialists to treat uninsured patients in
hospital emergency rooms highlights the need for a comprehensive
health plan for all Americans. The insurance lobby successfully
defeated the Clinton health proposals of 1994 that would have
achieved this goal, with the result that we now have some 39 million
uninsured individuals in this land of plenty. The rest of the
population has been herded into profit-oriented managed care plans.</TE>
<TE>   One can no more expect medical specialists to render their
services without hope of payment than you would expect the CEOs of
HMOs to do the same. The ideal solution would be a government-run
single-payer system, similar to those of Canada and the Western
democracies of Europe, where reasonable health care is furnished to
all citizens and physicians are not asked to render care without
compensation.</TE>

<TE>   There he goes again--Jamie Court and the health-care-bashing few
who don't understand that we have the best, most effective health
care system in the world. When will Court and company accept that
nearly 90% of us have confidence in the system he so dearly wishes to
undermine?</TE>
<TE>   The simple fact is that the problem is not access to the system or
that HMOs are reaping excessive profits (they clearly aren't) or that
administrative costs are too high (they aren't, as opposed to
government). The problem is affordability of medical care. If
government keeps sticking its nose into it to mandate benefits at the
whim of individual groups of constituents, costs for legitimate
health care concerns will surely suffer.</TE>

patrols out of my health care system!</TE>

voters of that country and their elected representatives. For
decades, Argentina's government has spent far more than it took in
taxes.</LD>
<LD>   There are only three ways of financing a government: taxes,
borrowing and printing money. (The government can confiscate things,
but taxes really are confiscation.) Too much of an increase in money
leads inevitably to inflation. Over the years, many gimmicks have
been tried, including dollarization and bank withdrawal rules, to
prevent inflation. No action by the IMF or the U.S. can help, unless
we want to lend money to the Argentine government.</LD>
<LD>   The whole economy is going into the tank because the people did
not want to pay enough in taxes to finance the amount of government
they desired. It is always in a political candidate's interest to
promise more spending and lower taxes. This is why we have a balanced
budget provision in our California state Constitution.</LD>

<LD>China calls Christianity an ''evil cult'' and puts its followers in
jail while sentencing Christian pastors to death (''Christian Church
Leader Is Sentenced to Death,'' Jan. 1). China should be ostracized
by the United Nations for this behavior, and America should suspend
all trade until this vicious religious persecution is stopped. We
must give China and all other tyrannical nations an ultimatum,
because until we protest, loud and clear, they will never change.
It's time we remove the shackles of tyranny from the U.N.'s ranks.
It's time to define what nations are united for and against. We have
agreed against terrorism; let us now agree against tyranny.</LD>

<LD>Re "Landlord's Empire Is Far-Flung, Problem-Plagued," Dec. 30: This
story is old news that mostly deals with issues that have been
disposed of two decades ago. Sam Menlo was never convicted of a
felony and he complied with all requirements imposed upon him 25
years ago for a misdemeanor conviction.</LD>
<LD>   I have been in law enforcement for almost 24 years. I am not a
member of a synagogue (I am Catholic), nor am I a member of the
"Menlo community." I am an outsider looking in and admiring the
charitable work of Sam and Vera Menlo. As I drive home from work I
see the Menlo Building at a school on La Brea Avenue serving over
1,000 children.</LD>
<LD>   It is often easy to blame a landlord for destruction caused by
tenants. The hypodermic needles found in the Menlo-owned apartments
were not related to Menlo's actions; perhaps the drug addicts who
invaded Menlo's building should be blamed for the destruction of the
apartments.</LD>
<TE>   I have known Menlo for 10 years. I am not his friend and I was
never at his home. He is a decent man whose philanthropy prevents
children from drug abuse and other juvenile crimes. I commend him for
his economic success, charitable work and contribution to our
economy.</TE>
<TE>   He has suffered enough without your article's innuendoes.</TE>

<LD>I agree with John Balzar's Jan. 2 commentary, "True Need vs. Greed."
I am not a rich man. I sent a contribution to the families of the
policemen and firemen of New York not to make them rich but to help
them through a bad time. I am OK with paying for whatever it takes to
get these families back on their feet and even paying for the
education of the children.</LD>
<LD>   I believe the people of New York should be calling for the just
use of these funds and sending them to wherever they are needed, as
it seems there is more than enough to address the needs of the
affected families.</LD>

<TE>   Balzar expressed my sentiments exactly. Loss of a loved one is
just as painful for the family of a victim of a drunk driver as for

the federal government. It is, however, free of state and local
taxes.</TE>

Commentary, Dec. 30: According to a recent ''Frontline'' broadcast on

Many published reports claim the war on drugs is being waged at a

<LD>Republican Party leaders certainly have a good chance of increasing
their support from Latinos and moderate swing voters nationwide
("Wooing Latinos Tough for the GOP," Dec. 31), but they are misguided
in thinking they only need to retool their message and shed the
stigma of Prop. 187. Their problem in wooing moderate and low-income
voters of all ethnicities comes from their adherence to dubious
policy. The GOP is the party of the tax cut (90% for the rich) in
good times and bad, and what middle-class person is going to swallow
that? On social issues the GOP has abdicated good judgment to the
religious right and its uncompromising positions, and what moderate
person will accept that?</LD>
<LD>   Getting moderates elected locally is not the answer, since the
national party demands obedience. One Richard Riordan is not going to
change the party's hard-edged image. While President Bush sought to
portray a politics of compassion and bipartisanship, his policies and
appointments have shown the same old stale ideas (not that the
Democrats have anything new). There are great opportunities for the
GOP in California and nationwide, but they will require a fundamental
shift away from supply side economics and sanctimonious social
policy.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas McGovern</LD>
<TE>   San Bernardino</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The article completely--though not surprisingly--disregards the
fact that Prop. 187 enjoyed significant support from Democrats (like
me) across the state. In the ensuing seven years since a clear
majority passed Prop. 187, so-called Latino activists and the state's
Democratic leadership have worked overtime to unfairly turn former
Gov. Pete Wilson into an Anglo boogeyman and the Republican Party
into a confederation of suburban racists.</TE>
<TE>   Your story is yet additional evidence of just how well they have
succeeded. As a Democrat who supported Prop. 187 but not Wilson, I
find it is as disgusting as the Joe McCarthy/Roy Cohn/Richard Nixon
smears of the 1950s.</TE>

<HD>Too Much of a Good Thing in the Wilderness</HD>
<DH>The resurgence of a tule elk herd has raised questions
about how best to care for and manage the animals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1978, 10 tule elk were released at Tomales Point in Point Reyes
National Seashore. Isolated on good range behind a fence, the elk
proceeded to do what elk do.</LD>
<LD>   By 1988, there were 100 elk; by 1995, 250. The herd then nearly
doubled again before leveling off--because of human intervention--to
the 450 or so found in the park today.</LD>
<LD>   "It has been a real success story," said John Dell'Osso, the
park's public information officer. "We have a number of threatened
and endangered species up here, and what's exciting about tule elk is
that they are endemic to California and they were once on the brink
of extinction."</LD>
<TE>   In a state well-stocked with wild places, Tomales Point is a
sublime setting. The slender peninsula, 90 minutes north of San
Francisco, is almost entirely surrounded by water and often shrouded
in fog. The elk have only added to the magic.</TE>
<TE>   And, yet, as successful as the elk reintroduction has been, it has
also raised intriguing--and sometimes troubling--questions about the
care and feeding of native wildlife. In the case of tule elk, the
dilemma is how to manage animals that need their privacy but prefer
the same habitat as people, especially valley bottoms and other
low-lying places.</TE>
<TE>   "If you picture there used to be a half-million tule elk in the
state, then ecologically speaking, they were the most important
herbivores in the system," said Natalie Gates, a wildlife biologist
at Point Reyes. "And then they were gone."</TE>
<TE>   Like many wildlife stories in California, this one began when
European settlers arrived in the state in the late 1700s. The
smallest subspecies of elk found in the United States, the tule elk
thrived in the marshy grasslands of Central California.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their once great numbers, they were thought to have become
extinct by the 1870s, as the result of over-hunting and habitat loss.
Then, in 1876, a handful of elk were found on a ranch belonging to
Henry Miller near Buttonwillow, west of Bakersfield. One story holds
that there were just one male and female remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Miller decided he was going to save the species. He put a bounty
on any person who dared to harass the elk. The population began to
climb slowly but steadily. Today, there are 3,700 to 3,800 tule elk
in the state on 22 reserves, according to the California Department
of Fish and Game.</TE>
<TE>   At Point Reyes, in 1978, the elk were put behind a fence on 2,600
acres on Tomales Point to keep them from interfering with dairy
ranches within the park. Initially, it seemed to be plenty of space,
but elk can reproduce prolifically. Females usually have one calf a
year beginning at age 2, and six to 10 young in a lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   When the population mushroomed in the 1990s, park officials became
worried that too large a herd could destroy its range and leave it
with nothing to eat. There were hard choices to be made, and park
officials, with public approval, ultimately settled on a two-prong
approach to controlling the herd.</TE>
<TE>   First, they considered several options.</TE>
<TE>   * Do nothing. If there was only so much grass to go around, the
elk population would naturally shrink as fewer newborns survived. But
could the park or its visitors sit by and idly watch mass starvation
take place in a series of dry years? Probably not.</TE>
<TE>   * Hunting a few elk. This was ruled out because hunting is not
allowed in most national parks. Although it would be the cheapest and
most effective method of population control, many thought it would
set a bad precedent for other parks. Even some hunters had
reservations, fearing that a high-profile hunt would result in
terrible publicity for the sport.</TE>
<TE>   * Moving some of the elk to another part of the state. But some of
the animals had contracted a wasting disease called Johne's from
cattle. Detecting Johne's is difficult, and officials worried that
elk relocated elsewhere might infect healthy cattle and cause huge
financial losses for ranchers.</TE>
<TE>   * Using birth control to slow the growth of the herd. This proved
to be possible and will continue to be a strategy used. Last year, 47
cows were given a contraceptive, injected by rifle-fired darts, that
lasts for one mating season. Although some experts have argued that
the practice is more humane than hunting, darting is expensive and
can be hard on the elk.</TE>
<TE>   "The darts are fired by rifle from 45 yards," said Gates, the park
biologist. "It is a painful experience. We occasionally get broken
bones, abscesses, mortalities." Gates said biologists suspect that
the deaths have been few--they're hard to detect because they can
occur days later--but that about 15% of the elk shot with darts
develop abscesses.</TE>
<TE>   Others believe that interfering in the birth cycle of an animal is
unethical. "For me, seeing them use contraceptives takes away from
them being a wild animal," said Mike Ford of the Rocky Mountain Elk
Foundation, a group that preserves elk habitat.</TE>
<TE>   * Moving a few elk to another part of Point Reyes. This was the
second approach the park adopted. In 1999, 30 elk were released in
the 32,000-acre Limantour Wilderness at the southern end of the park.
Unlike Tomales Point, this area has no fences, and park officials
doubt that any will have to be built. They say that the area is large
enough for a growing herd and that the steep, thickly forested
Inverness Ridge will act as a natural barrier, keeping elk in the
park.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't just allow our elk to roam free and not expect to have
problems," said Jon Fischer, a senior wildlife biologist with the
state Department of Fish and Game. "The fact you have over 30 million
people in California is going to preclude us from having a
half-million elk again."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the big animals that still roam free in California do so
in the mountains, where there are huge swaths of publicly owned land.
The challenge with tule elk will always be finding the nooks and
crannies in their former range--now mostly farms or cities--that can
still accommodate them .</TE>
<TE>   That, most conservationists argue, is what has been achieved at
Point Reyes.</TE>
<TE>   The best place to look for elk there is from the Tomales Point
Trail. Bulls with massive antlers are often seen surrounded by their
harems of 10 to 20 females. The elk almost seem to want to pose for
photographers atop cliffs, with the deep blue waters of Tomales Bay
and the Pacific Ocean in the background.</TE>
<TE>   Until, that is, the area's ubiquitous fog rolls back in and
swallows the scene, a symbolic reminder that a species once so
prolific almost disappeared.</TE>

<HD>ABC Seeks to Limit 'Vanity' Credit, Fees</HD>
<DH>Television: Network's policy would keep talent managers
from collecting money just for making client available.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY  and JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In another effort to hold the line on rising production costs, ABC is
seeking to implement a policy that would stop many talent managers
from receiving producer credits and fees on prime-time television
series.</LD>
<LD>   Studio and network executives have long chafed over "vanity" deals
that afford managers credit--and fees from $25,000 to $50,000 per
episode--merely for making clients available without providing any
real services as a producer.</LD>
<LD>   Big-name actors, by contrast, generally welcome such deals,
because they often allow managers to waive their fees, with the
studio covering the cost.</LD>
<TE>   ABC's negotiators have indicated that although preventing managers
from producing is not a blanket policy, it represents one of the
studio's strategies to reduce "above the line" costs, which refers to
the money paid to actors, producers and writers, as opposed to
physical production costs.</TE>
<TE>   "We have really tried to pare as much as we can below the line so
we can continue to produce great product ... [and] we do have to find
a way to be more responsible above the line as well," said Stu
Bloomberg, co-chairman of the ABC Entertainment Television Group, a
unit of Walt Disney Co.</TE>
<TE>   ABC officials acknowledge that the network and the studio's
production unit, Touchstone Television, may miss out on some projects
and that its resolve would be tested when highly sought stars are
involved.</TE>
<TE>   Although rival executives lauded the concept, both they and talent
representatives questioned how firm ABC--desperate for hits in the
midst of a ratings slump--would be with such a policy.</TE>
<TE>   Still, ABC is clearly seeking to send a message as program
development gets into full swing before the announcement of next
season's prime-time lineups in May. Published reports also have
indicated that the network is seeking savings from the packaging
commissions paid to talent agencies for assembling projects.</TE>
<TE>   Rival networks also have been discussing various methods to lower
expenses, and with the advertising market down, even some talent
managers concede such measures are necessary. Keith Addis, partner in
the Industry Entertainment management company, called what ABC is
doing a "responsible policy" amid the tighter economic climate.</TE>
<TE>   "This is aimed at the manager who tries to say ... 'You want my
client to star in this series? Then I'm a producer on it as well,'"
Addis said.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Brad Grey, producer of such shows as "Just Shoot Me" and
"The Sopranos," agreed that ABC's goal is understandable.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone is eager to be giving away credits or money
in any cavalier way at a time when the economics are so difficult,"
Grey said.</TE>
<TE>   Grey added that defining what producing involves can be difficult
given the wide range of functions it can entail. Unlike most
managers, his company often bankrolls some or all of a project,
functioning more like a studio.</TE>
<TE>   Managers also point out that their ability to contribute as
producers is sometimes blocked by the top writers who usually oversee
the production of TV shows.</TE>
<TE>   Addis said Industry Entertainment's producing credits reflect the
company's level of involvement in a particular project and that it
doesn't always have a production role in shows featuring its clients.</TE>

<HD>Airlines Have Yet to Lift Off</HD>
<DH>Travel: Despite few signs that a recovery is underway,
investors are returning to the traumatized sector.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The airlines are gradually luring more travelers to the skies thanks
to a spate of fare sales, but the carriers remain in deep financial
trouble as they brace for the seasonally slow winter months,
statistics released Friday show.</LD>
<LD>   Even so, airline stocks rose again as investors appeared to
speculate that the industry eventually will rebound this year, making
current stock prices attractive.</LD>
<LD>   Several major U.S. and foreign carriers, including American
Airlines and British Airways, said their December passenger-traffic
figures showed a slight improvement from November trends, but they
were still down substantially from December 2000.</LD>
<TE>   That's not surprising because most airlines massively scaled back
their operations and work forces because of the post-Sept. 11 plunge
in travel. But what concerns the airlines and analysts is that
average fares, or yields, being generated by passengers today remain
weak.</TE>
<TE>   That means most of the airlines, even with their cuts in service
and labor costs, are still unable to turn a profit. The U.S. airline
industry alone is expected to report a loss of $6 billion to $10
billion for 2001, and to keep racking up losses in the first half of
this year.</TE>
<TE>   What the airlines could use, most observers agree, is a rebound in
business passengers who typically pay higher fares. But business
travel, which was tapering off before Sept. 11, is still down sharply
from a year ago because of the weak U.S. economy. And corporations
are balking at paying higher fares for employees' travel until their
own businesses show improvement.</TE>
<TE>   The airlines "need to get their yields up, which means they either
raise the price or lower the cost" of service, said Ron Kuhlmann,
vice president at Roberts, Roach &amp; Associates, an aviation consulting
firm in Hayward, Calif. However, "they're limited in the price
increases they can charge. People are only willing to pay so much."</TE>
<TE>   Another sign of the airlines' struggle came Thursday from
Travelocity.com, the online travel-services concern, which said its
fourth-quarter results would be worse than expected because of
"unexpectedly slow sales of airline tickets during the December
holiday travel period" and "related air-fare reductions."</TE>
<TE>   The airlines' trade group said U.S. carriers boarded 12% fewer
passengers over the holiday period than they did a year ago. The
airlines recorded 20.2 million revenue passenger miles from Dec. 20
to Jan. 2, compared with 23 million a year ago, the Air Transport
Assn. said Friday. A revenue-passenger mile is one fare-paying
passenger carried one mile and is the industry's unit of traffic
measurement.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the airlines are taking some solace from filling their
planes with vacation travelers taking advantage of cheaper fares. "A
lot of the traffic is being won back by deeply discounting," said
Raymond Neidl, an analyst at the investment firm ABN Amro in New
York. "The business travelers probably won't come back until you see
some positive signs in the economy." Indeed, new fare sales were
announced Friday by Southwest Airlines, Northwest Airlines and
America West Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   American, a unit of AMR Corp., said its December passenger traffic
fell 17% from a year earlier. And even after taking into account the
cutbacks in its service, the airline said its load factor--the
percentage of its seats filled with passengers--fell 1.7 points from
a year ago, to 67.2% in December. American, the nation's largest
airline, said its traffic for all of 2001 fell 10% from the prior
year.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways reported a 22% drop in December traffic, while
Continental Airlines had an 11% decline and Alaska Airlines a 5%
decline. Among foreign carriers, British Airways and KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines both posted a 10% drop last month. However, those declines
represented an improvement from the year-over-year declines they
suffered in November. "There's a recovery in sight," said Howard
Wheeldon, an analyst at Prudential Bache Ltd. in London. "But it's
not a full recovery and it will take time."</TE>
<TE>   The exception again was Southwest, the short-haul carrier that
thrives on cheap fares because it has some of the lowest operating
expenses in the industry. The Dallas-based airline, which did not cut
flights or jobs after Sept. 11, said its December traffic edged up
0.6% from a year ago--the first year-over-year monthly increase in
passenger traffic for a major U.S. airline since the terrorist
attacks. Southwest's stock gained 20 cents, to $19.11 a share, Friday
on the New York Stock Exchange, while AMR rose $1.41, or 6%, to
$25.05. The American Stock Exchange's index of airline stocks overall
gained 3.48 points, or 3.7%, to close at 98.54 points.</TE>
<TE>   Investors "appear to be looking longer term, expecting both an
industry and economic recovery in the spring," Neidl said in a
bulletin to clients Friday. "We do not disagree with this
assessment." However, Travelocity's revised forecast sent its stock
tumbling $3.05, or 11%, to $24.39 a share on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   UAL Corp.'s United Airlines and the other major carriers are
expected to post their December traffic figures over the next few
days.</TE>

<HD>AT&amp;T to Cut 5,000 More Jobs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Retrenching long-distance giant AT&amp;T Corp. said Friday that it will
cut 5,000 more jobs this year and take a $1-billion charge against
fourth-quarter earnings to cover the cost of the cutbacks.</LD>
<LD>   The new job cuts will hit AT&amp;T's corporate staff as well as the
phone company's two remaining telecommunications units--business
services and consumer long-distance--which also took the brunt of the
5,100 layoffs the company announced last year.</LD>
<LD>   Subtracting the staff at its cable unit, AT&amp;T has about 80,000
employees in its corporate and two phone units, making the newly
announced layoffs a 6% payroll cutback. A company spokeswoman said
more than half the affected employees are in management positions.</LD>
<TE>   The New York-based company's cable and broadband unit, with 40,000
employees, will not be affected by the new reductions. That business
is being sold to Comcast Corp. for about $72 billion in a deal that
was announced last month.</TE>
<TE>   "The job cuts are part of AT&amp;T's effort to reinvent itself after
shedding its wireless and broadband businesses," said Jeff Kagan, an
independent consultant in Atlanta. "The units that are left have to
reduce costs and be streamlined to make them attractive to investors
and to customers. If they weren't making these kinds of moves, I'd be
worried."</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T's business and consumer telecommunications units, the only
businesses left once broadband is gone, are suffering amid stepped-up
competition and the trend toward using e-mail and mobile phones
instead of traditional long-distance.</TE>
<TE>   The two phone divisions produce steady income at healthy margins,
but their revenue has been  falling, and the trend may not reverse
itself for a long time--if ever, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue at AT&amp;T's consumer long-distance business, the hardest hit
of the two phone units, has been falling by double-digits each
quarter for more than a year and is expected to plunge by more than
20% this year.</TE>
<TE>   With sales plummeting so fast, analysts believe AT&amp;T has little
choice but to keep slashing expenses to keep them in line with
shrinking sales.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T's business services unit has at least 4 million corporate
customers, and its consumer unit remains the nation's largest
long-distance company, with about 60 million residential customers.</TE>
<TE>   Together, the two businesses have more than $44 billion in yearly
sales.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the industry doubt that AT&amp;T can survive as an independent
company once the cable business is gone. There is speculation that
other phone companies, including former Baby Bell BellSouth Corp.,
could buy the weakened AT&amp;T.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials have rejected that notion, contending that the
consumer long-distance business will be bolstered by the sale of
lucrative add-on services such as Internet access and high-speed data
connections.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T executives say the business services unit will rebound now
that a string of disappearing upstart companies has made corporations
less willing to deviate from tried-and-true carriers.</TE>
<TE>   Still, in October, AT&amp;T executives warned that the
telecommunications business was rapidly deteriorating and that the
company planned to take an unspecified charge on its fourth-quarter
results.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, AT&amp;T said the $1-billion charge will cover severance
and termination costs associated with the company's job cuts in 2001
and 2002, as well as charges for canceling contracts and closing
buildings. About $250 million to $350 million of the charge will be
in cash, according to Eileen Connolly, an AT&amp;T spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   The company's fourth-quarter results, which cover the three-month
period that ended Dec. 31, will be released in the last week of
January. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call estimate
that AT&amp;T would post a profit of 4 cents a share for the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In the third quarter, the phone company's results were rocked by a
noncash charge of $5.3 billion related to dissolution of Concert, the
international telecommunications joint venture between AT&amp;T and
British Telecom.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of AT&amp;T closed at $18.37, down 27 cents, on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Bausch to Slash 700 More Jobs to Cut Costs</HD>
<DH>Vision care: The firm makes its fourth staff reduction in
three years and plans to take a $28-million charge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc., struggling to right itself after repeatedly
missing earnings expectations, said Friday that it will cut 700 more
jobs in its fourth work-force reduction in three years to trim costs.</LD>
<LD>   The Rochester, N.Y.-based maker of Boston contact lenses and ReNu
lens-care solutions said it plans to take $28 million in
restructuring charges for the job cuts, which represent 7% of its
more than 10,000 employees.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, shortly after he rejoined the company from General
Motors Corp., Chairman and Chief Executive Ronald Zarrella warned
that more job cuts were coming in order to lower costs.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said similar moves are ahead for Bausch &amp; Lomb, which has
posted disappointing financial results since July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Bausch &amp; Lomb said 250 of the 700 new job cuts will result from
the closure of a Madrid factory during the first quarter and a
Sarasota, Fla., plant in September.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the remaining 450 positions will be eliminated in the
first quarter, the company said. "The expected cuts will be
broad-based and will impact all regions and functional units," it
said.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent job cuts follow 800 cuts a year ago. Before that,
Bausch &amp; Lomb cut 450 jobs in October 2000 and 850 in December 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the latest round of job cuts, Standard &amp; Poor's said it may
cut the ratings on Bausch &amp; Lomb to junk status. The warning covers
the company's BBB-minus long-term corporate credit, bank loan, and
senior unsecured debt ratings and its A-3 short-term credit and
commercial paper ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Bausch &amp; Lomb said the restructuring will reduce fourth-quarter
earnings by 6 cents a share. Analysts on average expect profit of 42
cents for the quarter, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Bausch &amp; Lomb shares ended the day up $1.84, or 4.8%, at $39.51 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>General Motors Corp. is displaying an armored Cadillac DeVille at the
Greater Los Angeles Auto Show to gauge interest in the model after
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks increased security concerns.</LD>
<LD>   The armored DeVille, designed to stop a bullet from a .44-caliber
Magnum handgun, was originally conceived for overseas markets, said
Dave Ransom, Cadillac manager of professional vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   Inquiries for armored cars have increased 40% at Scaletta Moloney
Armoring Corp. since the attacks, said President Joseph Scaletta,
whose company helped build the prototype. Orders for cars with
additional armor have increased 25% at the Bedford Park, Ill.,
company.</LD>
<TE>   The DeVille would compete with armored versions of Bayerische
Motoren Werke's 7-Series and DaimlerChrysler's S-Class sedans.</TE>
<TE>   The Cadillac would have run-flat tires, bullet-resistant windows
and a modified chassis designed to hold the extra weight of the car.
Although Ransom wouldn't give a price for the model if it were built,
he said it will be competitive with the Mercedes and BMW models that
range from $100,000 to $154,000.</TE>

<HD>Daimler Expects to Meet Profit Target</HD>
<DH>Autos: The firm says earnings will be below 2000 results
but Chrysler unit is exceeding cost-cutting goals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN GRAHAM</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>DaimlerChrysler said Friday that it expects to post an operating
profit of about $1.08 billion for 2001, sharply below the previous
year but enough to reassure investors that a costly turnaround plan
for its ailing Chrysler unit is on track.</LD>
<LD>   The world's No. 5 car maker had said it expected an operating
profit--which excludes interest and taxes--of $1.08 billion to
$1.53billion. Its operating profit for 2000 was $4.6 billion.</LD>
<LD>   But Chief Executive Juergen Schrempp said last month that profit
would be at the lower end of the range because of the slowing world
economy and the economic shock of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, the company said its U.S. unit Chrysler "significantly
exceeded" cost-cutting goals set last year and was on course to meet
its earnings target for 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement sent shares of DaimlerChrysler up $1.22, or 2.8%,
to $45.62 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good interim report," said Albrecht Denninghoff, an
analyst at Bayerische Hypo-Vereinsbank in Munich, Germany. "The U.S.
market will weaken further next year, but they've done a good job on
cutting back inventory and production."</TE>
<TE>   Schrempp launched a $3.9-billion, three-year rescue plan in
February aimed at slashing costs and reviving the appeal of
Chrysler's vehicles to return it to profit by 2003. The plan calls
for about 35,000 job cuts at Chrysler and Japan's Mitsubishi Motors
Corp., which is 37.3% owned by DaimlerChrysler.</TE>
<TE>   According to preliminary sales figures, DaimlerChrysler's revenue
was about $135 billion last year, down 7% from $145.8 million in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Unit vehicle sales were down 6% to 4.45 million, despite record
sales of its Mercedes-Benz and Smart cars.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler shipped just under 2.74 million vehicles in 2001, down
10% from 2000. Revenue is expected to be down 9.4% to $55.8 billion,
the company said.</TE>
<TE>   To revive flagging U.S. sales in the wake of the attacks, auto
makers including Chrysler, General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
began offering no-interest financing--a costly measure that could
erode earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "The great unknown for 2002 is how long this will continue,"
Denninghoff said. "Complete faith in the management will only be
restored when Chrysler really is back in profit."</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler also reaffirmed its expectation that Mitsubishi
will break even in the financial year ending in March. It said
revenue was almost unchanged last year from 2000 at about $11.6
billion.</TE>

<HD>Eisner's Paycheck Humbled in 2001</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Disney CEO exercised no stock options and
did not get a bonus as the firm failed to meet financial targets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Michael Eisner, once one of America's
most highly paid executives, took a hefty pay cut last year,
reflecting the entertainment giant's bleak financial results.</LD>
<LD>   Eisner's total pay dropped to $1million last year from
$12.3million in 2000, largely because he received no bonus and did
not exercise any stock options, according to documents Disney filed
Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It was the second
time in three years that Eisner did not receive a bonus.</LD>
<LD>   Disney President Bob Iger, who received a $5-million bonus in
2000, also did not get a bonus last year. Both Eisner and Iger
received salaries of $1 million in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Disney said the two top executives did not qualify for bonuses
because the company failed to meet its net income and other financial
targets in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Disney cut 4,000 jobs and posted a net loss of $158 million for
fiscal 2001, reflecting write-offs from the closing of the company's
Go.com Internet portal, as well as falling attendance at the
company's theme parks and a slowdown in advertising at its ABC
television network.</TE>
<TE>   Disney was already suffering from the economic slowdown before the
terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 intensified the company's
problems.Three other top Disney officers, however, did receive
bonuses last year totaling $2.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Strategic Officer Peter Murphy and Chief Financial Officer
Tom Staggs each received $1-million bonuses, while Disney's executive
general counsel Louis Meisinger got a $300,000 bonus. Meisinger was
the only executive to exercise stock options, gaining an additional
$884,055.</TE>
<TE>   Disney said in its filing that the "special bonuses" were paid to
the three top executives because of "extraordinary services,"
including their work on Disney's $5.2-billion acquisition of the Fox
Family Worldwide cable channel.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner's compensation at Disney reached its peak in December 1997
when he earned $576 million, the bulk of it by exercising $569.8
million in stock options. But his pay has come under increasing
scrutiny from shareholders in recent years as Disney's stock
performance has lagged behind its peers.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's stock, which rose 58 cents Friday to close at $22.70 on
the New York Stock Exchange, is trading close to where it was five
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "[Eisner] did the right thing," said compensation specialist Graef
Crystal, who designed Eisner's early pay formulas but no longer
consults for Disney. Graef had been highly critical in 2000 when
Eisner saw his cash compensation increase from $750,000 to $12.3
million in a year when Disney's net income fell 29%.</TE>
<TE>   Crystal noted that Eisner did not seek to re-price his Disney
options last year or obtain new grants, a tactic other corporate
chiefs have used to obtain pay hikes even in down times. Indeed, as
Disney's stock fell 28% last year, Eisner saw a $266-million paper
loss in the value of his 21 million stock option grants, according to
Disney's filing.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Eisner, 59, is hurting.</TE>
<TE>   Forbes magazine says Eisner remains one of the wealthiest media
executives in America with a net worth of $720 million. And Eisner,
who has run Disney since 1984, owns more than 13 million shares of
Disney stock.</TE>
<TE>   In the filing, Disney's board also recommended that shareholders
reject a proposal that would prevent the company from using its
independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, for consulting services,
saying the company has safeguards to protect the auditor's
independence.</TE>
<TE>   Disney disclosed that it paid $25.2 million to Pricewaterhouse
during its last fiscal year for consulting services, including areas
such as strategic sourcing, electronic procurement and the
development of an Internet portal for employees.</TE>
<TE>   In an unrelated development, Disney shareholders filed a lawsuit
Thursday over $140 million in severance payments to the company's
former president Michael Ovitz. The talent agent left Disney in 1996
after 14 months on the job.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, filed in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington, Del.,
contends that Disney directors were "grossly negligent" by giving
only a cursory review of Ovitz's employment agreement before it was
approved by the board in 1995. A judge dismissed an earlier suit
challenging Ovitz's package.</TE>
<TE>   "We have every confidence we will prevail again,'' Disney
spokeswoman Michelle Bergman said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Ovitz declined to comment.</TE>

<HD>Frederick's Sues Andersen Over Breach of Contract</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOYZELLE DAVIS</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frederick's of Hollywood Inc. sued the fifth-largest U.S. accounting
firm, accusing Arthur Andersen of negligence that led the purveyor of
racy lingerie to file for bankruptcy protection in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Frederick's said Andersen improperly sought to be released from
any claims the retailer might have related to its auditing services.</LD>
<LD>   Frederick's claims that when it refused to sign the release,
Andersen quit the account without completing the 1999 audit.</LD>
<TE>   Frederick's suit in Los Angeles County Superior Court claims the
company couldn't get loans it needed because it lacked audit
information lenders required. The lingerie seller filed Chapter 11
bankruptcy and seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages in
the suit.</TE>
<TE>   "Andersen's misleading tactics, concealment of material
information and ultimate termination of all work destroyed
Frederick's ability to carry on its operations," according to the
professional negligence and breach-of-contract suit.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago-based Andersen didn't immediately return a call for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen is under investigation as the auditor of Enron Corp.,
which last month filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history after
saying it overstated earnings. Andersen also has been criticized for
its accounting work for Sunbeam Corp. and Waste Management Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles-based Frederick's filed for Chapter 11 in July 2000,
citing a need to ease a debt load from a 1997 leveraged buyout.</TE>

<HD>Motorists to See Hike in Gas Prices</HD>
<DH>Energy: Fuel is likely to rise 15 to 20 cents a gallon in
California, due to production cutbacks and higher demand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN  and LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gasoline prices, now the cheapest in years for Southern California
drivers, are likely to rise by 15 to 20 cents a gallon at the pump
over the next few weeks and in some cases are climbing already,
analysts said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Production cutbacks at California refineries and an apparent rise
in demand for gasoline are behind the expected increase, analysts
said. And crude oil prices moved up to a two-month high Friday, to
$21.62 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think we'll see prices this low again for quite some
time," said Fred Rozell, retail pricing director for Oil Price
Information Service, a Lakewood, N.J.-based firm.</LD>
<TE>   Rozell said wholesale prices for gasoline already have jumped
about 15 cents a gallon in California since mid-December, but those
increases haven't yet been passed along to consumers. The result, he
said, is that many owners of independent gasoline stations in the
area are selling gasoline at a loss.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't operate that way, losing money, or you'll go out of
business, even if you are [making money] selling Cheetos and other
stuff," Rozell said.</TE>
<TE>   The Automobile Club of Southern California reported that the
average price in Los Angeles County for a gallon of gasoline hit 99.2
cents Friday. That's down from a high of just under $2.04 a gallon in
May. It marked the 16th straight week prices have fallen.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, prices for the 13-county Southern California region
extending from San Luis Obispo south to the Mexican border fell to an
average of just under $1.08, down from a high of $2.01 in June. The
auto club said these are the lowest prices for gasoline over the five
years the organization has kept such records.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Spring, an auto club spokesman, agreed that rising prices
in the spot market for oil and in gasoline at the wholesale level
suggest that prices at the pump "are at or near the bottom."</TE>
<TE>   Spring said he has already seen prices going up at some stations
in his area near Yorba Linda, but the average is still down.</TE>
<TE>   The anticipated rise in gasoline prices would eliminate  a bonanza
for the local economy. Analysts say that the money consumers saved on
cheap gasoline has freed up money for spending on other goods and
services.</TE>
<TE>   "The month of December was great. Prices were going down. I
thought finally, gas is under a dollar," said Benny Rubacava, a
school bus driver from Mission Hills.</TE>
<TE>   But at the Arco station where he was filling his minivan's tank
Friday night, gas  prices had risen 6 cents a gallon that morning.
Rubacava said he will curb  weekend road trips if prices climb
higher.</TE>
<TE>   Rozell said even after the recent rise in wholesale prices is
passed on to consumers, other factors probably will push up prices
further.</TE>
<TE>   He said prices climb nearly every February when retailers in
Southern California switch from winter-grade to summer-grade
gasolines, which are more expensive to produce. Then, later in the
spring, prices normally  are hiked further as vacationers  hit the
road.</TE>
<TE>   Rozell said  Southern California was the least profitable gasoline
market in the nation for owners of independent gasoline stations,
according to a new ranking by his firm. He said competition from
retailers such as Costco Wholesale Corp. has fueled the
price-cutting.</TE>
<TE>   For independent gas station owners, who must buy their gas at
higher prices from independent refineries, the last few months have
been particularly tough.</TE>
<TE>   "For the past month and a half, we have been losing money--close
to 15 to 20 cents a gallon," said Gary Tejwani, owner of the Slauson
Gas Mart on West Slauson Avenue. "In order to compete with the big
boys, sometimes the market goes upside down and the independents
suffer."</TE>
<TE>   Tejwani's pump price Friday for regular unleaded was 99 cents, but
he anticipated a boost soon, as larger competitors also hike prices.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to be losing less, or hopefully start making some
money," said Tejwani, adding that the last year has been the toughest
in many years.</TE>
<TE>   Some franchise stations are already raising prices.</TE>
<TE>   At Tony's Gas Service on North Highland Avenue, a Mobil franchise,
prices were increased 6 cents Friday morning, said manager Joe
Shubat, with regular unleaded up to $1.05. If they hadn't, Shubat
said, Tony's would have lost 1 to 2 cents a gallon on credit card
transactions, where there are added costs.</TE>

<HD>Tech Stock Rally Again Leads to Market Gains</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Shares climb for third straight session
despite dismal unemployment figures for December.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks rose Friday for a third straight session, posting solid gains
despite the worst monthly unemployment report in more than six years.</LD>
<LD>   Investors focused on data that showed fewer jobs were cut in
December than in previous months; those numbers seemed to strengthen
Wall Street's conviction that there will be an economic turnaround
this spring.</LD>
<LD>   Technology stocks, which led the market this week, continued to
advance, and the momentum again spread to the broader market.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 87.60 points, or 0.9%,
at 10,259.74, its highest close since late August.</TE>
<TE>   Broader indicators also rose. The technology-focused Nasdaq
composite index advanced 15.11 points, or 0.7%, to 2,059.38. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index climbed 7.24 points, or 0.6%, to
1,172.51.</TE>
<TE>   Advancers led decliners by almost 2 to 1 on the New York Stock
Exchange and by about 4 to 3 on Nasdaq. Trading was active,
continuing to pick up after the slow holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   The day capped the third straight winning week for the Dow, which
rose 1.2% for the week, and the S&amp;P 500, which gained 1%. The Nasdaq
was up 3.6% for its second straight weekly gain.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors are looking beyond the valley of that tragic event [the
Sept. 11 attacks], to the peaks ahead," said Alfred E. Goldman, chief
market strategist for A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   The market moved higher Friday even as the Labor Department
reported the nation's unemployment rate rose to 5.8% in December with
businesses cutting 124,000 jobs. Still, the losses were less severe
than in recent months. Job losses had averaged about 400,000 a month
in October and November.</TE>
<TE>   Investors took that decrease as an indication that the economy had
bottomed and that a recovery was even more likely in the first half
of the year. Stocks across the market rallied, with particularly
strong gains in technology.</TE>
<TE>   Intel advanced 27 cents to $35.79, benefiting for a second
straight session from a J.P. Morgan analyst's bullish comments that
the company's business might soon improve. Intel competitor Advanced
Micro Devices, which soared 18% on Thursday in reaction to that
assessment, rose another 63 cents to $20 on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street also bid DaimlerChrysler higher after the firm said
its 2001 operating profit met the lower end of its expectations. The
shares rose $1.22 to $45.62.</TE>
<TE>   Pharmaceutical and consumer-goods companies didn't fare as well,
falling back again as investors moved into the technology sector.
Merck dropped 14 cents to $58.89, while Procter &amp; Gamble slipped 78
cents to $78.45.</TE>
<TE>   The market has rallied significantly from the lows after the Sept.
11 attacks, reaching levels not seen since late summer. The Dow
appears to have comfortably broken through the 10,000 level and
Nasdaq is hovering above 2,000.</TE>
<TE>   January historically is a strong time for the market, as the
pressure from end-of-year tax selling lifts. Wall Street also is
reacting to increasing signs that the economy's worst troubles may be
behind it. Besides the job figures released Friday, an Institute of
Supply Management report Wednesday showed that manufacturing activity
shrank in December, but not as much as expected.</TE>
<TE>   Market watchers are encouraged but say that caution is the best
approach for investors.</TE>
<TE>   "For all intents and purposes, it does appear the recessionary
forces are abating," said Bryan Piskorowski, market commentator at
Prudential Securities. "These are steps in the right direction, but
it's still difficult to call a turn here and know when things are
exactly going to improve."</TE>
<TE>   Bond yields rose on concerns Friday's economic data decreases the
odds that the Federal Reserve will cut rates at its Jan. 29-30
meeting. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to
5.13% from 5.11% on Thursday.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Abgenix Inc. said it was abandoning development of an experimental
rheumatoid arthritis drug because it failed to prove effective in
patients enrolled in a phase II clinical trial.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement sent shares of the Fremont, Calif.-based company
down $1.98, or 6%, to $29.70 on Nasdaq.</LD>
<LD>   The company said it will continue to explore using the
antibody-based drug as a treatment for other diseases, including
psoriasis. Some analysts are skeptical the drug will work for other
diseases.</LD>
<TE>   "The rheumatoid arthritis results could be a harbinger for
psoriasis," said Felicia Reed, an analyst with Boston-based Adams,
Harkness &amp; Hill Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Reed said Abgenix has a promising cancer drug in phase II clinical
trials, and the company is expected to begin tests on several other
drugs this year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Service Merchandise Co. said it will close all of its 200 stores and
eliminate half of its 1,000 corporate employees as the recession and
fallout from the Sept. 11 attacks crippled the chain.</LD>
<LD>   The retailer, which sells gifts, jewelry and home decor products,
said its 8,300 store employees will leave the company after all
merchandise is liquidated, beginning Jan. 19. That process is
expected to be completed this spring and requires approval from U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Tennessee.</LD>
<LD>   Layoff of the remaining 500 corporate employees will be staggered
throughout the year.</LD>
<TE>   The retailer, which filed for bankruptcy protection in March 1999,
said it will file a plan of liquidation by Sept. 30 to provide for
the distribution of the proceeds of its assets to creditors. Service
Merchandise said shareholders will not receive any compensation for
their investments.</TE>

<HD>Spiegel Says Eddie Bauer Chief Executive Retiring</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spiegel Inc. announced the retirement of Richard Fersch, president
and chief executive of its Eddie Bauer division, effective
immediately, and said a search firm has been hired to find a
replacement.</LD>
<LD>   Spiegel is primarily focused on bringing someone in from outside
the company, spokeswoman Debbie Koopman said. During the transition
period, Fersch, who joined Spiegel in 1988 and was named chief
executive in 1997, will work with the company to run day-to-day
operations, Spiegel said.</LD>
<LD>   Fersch, 52, was credited with expanding Eddie Bauer's sales to
$1.6 billion from $900 million, Spiegel said. Sales were hurt in 1999
and 2000 after the company introduced clothes that looked too casual
and too young for its 35-to-55-year-old target consumer group,
Spiegel said.</LD>
<TE>   Eddie Bauer accounted for 57% of Spiegel's sales in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Downers Grove, Ill.-based Spiegel fell 27 cents to $4.06
on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>ACLN Ltd. said it will cooperate with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in its request for information about disclosures the
company made in regulatory filings.</LD>
<LD>   The Belgium-based company, which ships low-cost used cars from
Europe to Africa, "believes its SEC filings are accurate in all
material respects," Chief Executive Aldo Labiad said.</LD>
<LD>   ACLN is accused in lawsuits of misstating profitability and future
prospects. One lawsuit alleges the company falsely claimed to
purchase a transport ship to conceal a diversion of funds, according
to a statement released in December by a law firm representing some
shareholders.</LD>
<TE>   The company said the allegations in the lawsuits are without
merit.</TE>
<TE>   ACLN shares, which reached a 52-week high of $50 on Sept. 5, fell
$1.05 to $10.30 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Tracking Stock Okd for Lorillard Unit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shareholders of Loews Corp., the conglomerate controlled by Laurence
Tisch, approved the creation of a class of stock tied to the value of
the company's Lorillard Tobacco Co. unit.</LD>
<LD>   The tracking stock won approval over the opposition of some Loews
shareholders such as the California Public Employees' Retirement
System, the State of Connecticut Trust and the Hotel Employees &amp;
Restaurant Employees International Union.</LD>
<LD>   The opponents said they wanted Loews to spin off the company.
Executives hadn't explained why a tracking stock would be better for
shareholders than a spinoff, they said.</LD>
<TE>   "The reason Loews wants to issue a tracking stock instead of
spinning off Lorillard is that Lorillard provides sizable cash flow
for Loews," James Tisch, Loews' chief executive and son of
Co-Chairman Laurence Tisch, told shareholders at the Regency Hotel in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Loews uses the cash to invest in its oil-tanker and CNA Financial
Corp. insurance business, Tisch said.</TE>
<TE>   Loews also has interests in hotels and owns watch maker Bulova
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of the sale and other details weren't disclosed. Loews'
shares rose $1.63 to $56.28 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Pricey Irvine Co. Project Defying Slump</HD>
<DH>Housing: Plenty of space per residence is a major reason
sales of Shady Canyon homes have been brisk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Shady Canyon area of Irvine, the new Irvine Co. project featuring
some of the priciest homes away from the ocean, is defying the odds.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a sluggish economy that has caused luxury-home sales to
slump nationwide, and a public launch just days after Sept. 11, sales
have been brisk for custom home sites that are beginning to dot Shady
Canyon's rocky terrain and rolling hills.</LD>
<LD>   Since late September, 18 semi-custom villas have been sold for
$1.5 million to $2 million each. In addition, several dozen parcels
for custom homes have been purchased that cost between $600,000 and
$2.7 million.</LD>
<TE>   Retired baseball slugger Mark McGwire, an Orange County resident,
bought a double lot on a bluff top that offers a sweeping view of the
community's private 300-acre golf course and the San Joaquin Hills.
On the same street, another buyer is putting up a Tuscan-style
farmhouse--an 11,000-square-foot mansion with seven suites and a
private amphitheater--for $10 million, the most expensive home in the
area.</TE>
<TE>   The lure? The development offers roomy parcels--at least half an
acre per home--at a time when even million-dollar homes are being
built so close together in the region that some of them resemble row
houses.</TE>
<TE>   At Shady Canyon, Irvine Co. envisions a gated enclave of roughly
400 estates to be built across nearly 1,100 acres. Much of the area's
natural habitat will be preserved, and the developer is betting that
people will be drawn by the wide-open spaces in a metropolitan
setting. Shady Canyon is a short commute to the Irvine Spectrum
business and entertainment park and offices around John Wayne
Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people have been waiting a long time for a home site
that's close to Newport Beach, close to South Coast Plaza, but gives
them this kind of space," said Chris Valli, a broker at Coast Newport
Properties in Newport Beach. He has sold four sites in the community
and has another sale pending.</TE>
<TE>   The brisk demand at Shady Canyon is running counter to many other
projects for high-end homes. Through November, overall sales of new
homes priced at $1 million or higher have fallen 34% from a year ago
in Orange County, according to Meyers Group, an Irvine real estate
research firm. In Los Angeles County, a smaller market for new luxury
homes, sales have been fairly flat.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Irvine Co., one of a few companies nationwide
creating such low-density communities in metro areas, have been
surprised by the reaction, given the timing of the development.
Indeed, Chairman Donald Bren and other top executives considered
postponing Shady Canyon's first public tours scheduled for the next
two weekends after Sept. 11. More than 1,000 people came to the
showings.</TE>
<TE>   "We took a risk that the world was not coming to an end," said
Joseph Davis, who heads the home-development arm of Irvine Co. "We've
been fortunate that consumers have demonstrated support for it."</TE>
<TE>   Among them are Mike and Laura Meisenbach. This month, the couple,
both 40, are set to move into a two-story, 5,000-square-foot home
amid a cluster of high-end homes in Newport Beach. But after visiting
Shady Canyon three times, they purchased a half-acre parcel and plan
to build a U-shaped home around a swimming pool. When the custom home
is ready, probably in late 2003 or early 2004, they plan to sell
their Newport Beach house.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Meisenbachs, most of Shady Canyon's buyers are affluent
Orange County residents who have lived shoulder-to-shoulder with
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "Our biggest thing is that we really wanted a feeling of open
space," said Mike Meisenbach, a commercial real estate broker in
Orange County. "I don't like looking at other houses and feeling like
I'm right on top of someone."</TE>
<TE>   Buyers like the Meisenbachs have made believers of home builders,
too.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor Woodrow Homes of Irvine already has sold 18 of its
two-dozen Shady Canyon homes since late September, and expects two
more to be bought soon, leaving only model units, said Vice President
Barbara Stowers.</TE>
<TE>   She said the sales pace has exceeded the builder's other high-end
developments in San Diego and Orange counties. Now, Stowers said,
Taylor Woodrow is negotiating with Irvine Co. to buy up to 20 more
vacant lots in Shady Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been no hesitancy on the part of buyers," she said.</TE>

<HD>Court Upholds State Statute on Spam</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A California appeals court upheld a state law regulating businesses
that send unsolicited e-mail advertisements, also known as spam.</LD>
<LD>   The appeals court in San Francisco overturned a trial judge's
ruling that the state law violates the U.S. Constitution's mandate
that only Congress has the right to regulate commerce between states.</LD>
<LD>   The 1998 state law requires that spammers must provide ways for a
recipient to get off their e-mail lists, as well as clearly stating
in the subject line that the message is an advertisement.</LD>
<TE>   "We find that California has a substantial legitimate interest in
protecting its citizens from the harmful effects of unsolicited
commercial e-mail and that [the statute] furthers that important
interest," Justice Paul Haerle wrote on behalf of a unanimous
three-judge panel.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Ferguson sued Friendfinders Inc. and Conru Interactive Inc.,
two Palo Alto companies, in 1999 after receiving unsolicited e-mails
that allegedly didn't comply with the state law.</TE>
<TE>   A San Francisco trial judge dismissed Ferguson's trespass, unfair
business practices and unlawful advertising suit last year before
trial. California's attorney general joined Ferguson's appeal by
filing an amicus brief.</TE>
<TE>   As much as 30% of all e-mail sent each day consists of unsolicited
ads for dating services, credit lines and other products, the court
noted in its opinion. The cost of sending bulk e-mail is nominal to
the sender, while it creates costs for Internet service providers and
the recipients of the messages.</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen states have similar laws to control spam e-mail,
while the U.S. Congress declined to enact a federal law.</TE>

<HD>File Sharers Unwittingly Tracked</HD>
<DH>Computers: Software from LimeWire, Grokster and KaZaA
included ability to see users' Web habits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Thousands of Internet users who installed popular software for
sharing music and other computer files also unwittingly accepted a
program that tracked their Web surfing habits.</LD>
<LD>   The companies that produce LimeWire, Grokster and KaZaA have since
posted new versions of their software without the tracking program.
LimeWire's maker also issued an apology.</LD>
<LD>   The tracking program in question links Internet users to an online
sweepstakes game, ClickTillUWin. Players pick numbers and win cash
prizes based on results of the Pennsylvania Lottery.</LD>
<TE>   The game is free, though users must first view an advertisement.
The program collects information about sites visited over the last
two days to better target ads.</TE>
<TE>   These types of programs exist elsewhere on the Internet; what
prompted concerns in this case was the lack of disclosure or option
to reject it.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear who's to blame.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Calderone, president of Strategic Advertising Services Inc.,
which runs the ClickTillUWin game, said outside distributors had been
instructed to get users' permission before installing the
software--but that was not done.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Bildson, chief technology officer of LimeWire, said the
company was led to believe the program did no more than link to a
game, making the permission request unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Regular of Cydoor Technologies Inc., which distributed the
ClickTillUWin software to the file-sharing companies, said the
program wasn't supposed to collect information until users activated
it--and had an opportunity to be notified and decline if desired.</TE>
<TE>   Regular said he did not believe deception was intended by any of
the parties.</TE>
<TE>   About 150,000 LimeWire users and up to 50,000 Grokster users
downloaded ClickTillUWin last month when they obtained new or
upgraded versions of the file-sharing software. A few hundred
thousand people received it through KaZaA.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-virus companies initially classified the program as a Trojan
horse, but some of them later backed down. Calderone said his company
lost an unknown amount of business because of the controversy.</TE>

<HD>Tenet Continuing Its Resurgence</HD>
<DH>Health care: Hospital operator sees strongest earnings
growth ever amid increased patient loads, higher costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Continuing its rise as one of the most powerful players in the
health-care industry, hospital operator Tenet Healthcare Corp. on
Friday reported its strongest quarterly operating earnings growth
ever in the period ended Nov. 30 and boosted its fiscal 2002 profit
outlook.</LD>
<LD>   Tenet's resurgence, after a shaky period in the 1990s, illustrates
how some hospital operators have succeeded in pushing through major
price increases, restoring a once-beleaguered business to
profitability while fueling a new round of double-digit growth in
overall health-care costs for insurers and consumers.</LD>
<LD>   Tenet said Friday that its fiscal second-quarter operating profit
rose 47% because of increased patient load and higher prices. Profit
from operations rose to $258 million, or 77 cents a share, from net
income of $175 million, or 54 cents, a year earlier, the company
said. Revenue increased 16% to $3.39 billion.</LD>
<TE>   The Santa Barbara-based company also said it anticipates fiscal
2002 operating earnings per share of at least $3.10, a 35% gain over
2001.</TE>
<TE>   The news sent shares prices up $2 to close at $62 on the New York
Stock Exchange, topping a calendar year in which shares rose 32%,
beating Standard &amp; Poor's super-composite health-care index. Tenet,
the nation's second-largest for-profit hospital chain, has seen its
shares climb 35% since the start of 2001. During the same period,
shares for the nation's largest chain, Nashville-based HCA Inc., fell
13.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet runs 116 hospitals in 17 states, including 33 in Southern
California, making it the largest private hospital operator in the
region with more than 7,000 beds and about 26,000 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Its tough-minded and analytical approach to business represents
the changes that are upending the nation's health-care system. For
one, it is a symbol of a nationwide backlash by hospital and
physician groups against low fixed payments for services from the
managed-care industry. That also means it has helped fuel the
double-digit growth in health-care costs for employers, which are
increasingly inclined to pass on those increases to employees.</TE>
<TE>   "What's happened has been a banding together of hospital groups
and doctor's groups, partly in response to past consolidations in the
managed-care industry," said Albert Lowey-Ball, who heads ALBA, a
Sacramento-based management consulting firm specializing in the
managed health-care sector. "The result is that the market pressures
to keep premiums and costs low has been lessened."</TE>
<TE>   But Lowey-Ball points out that although hospital and physician
groups may be the winners here, consumers are not. "This increasing
concentration of power on both sides of the market, between the
health plans and the health providers, greatly weakens the position
of smaller [businesses] and individual consumers."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Boland, an author and independent consultant who is
president of Boland Healthcare in Berkeley, said Tenet and some other
hospital groups have in recent years acquired the technical equipment
and expertise to track their costs more closely.</TE>
<TE>   "Five years ago, those care providers signed contracts with
insurers and hoped they didn't lose their shirts. Now they can track
the impact of those contracts department by department, right down to
individual patients, and they realize that they have been subsidizing
the managed-care companies."</TE>
<TE>   That's why several hospital groups and some physician groups have
been shedding low-paying HMOs and have been refusing so-called
capitated, or fixed, payments per patient.</TE>
<TE>   "We are out of the capitation business. We don't do them anymore.
Those payments in the 1990s were supposed to be the wave of the
future, but they proved to be a dismal failure that bankrupted some
groups," said Harry Anderson, Tenet's vice president for corporate
communications. "We still have contracts with most major HMOs, but we
now get paid a negotiated rate for all medical services provided."</TE>
<TE>   Tenet also has become more aggressive, acquiring six hospitals in
2001, including Daniel Freeman Memorial in Inglewood, Daniel Freeman
Marina in Marina del Rey and other facilities in Atlanta, St. Louis
and Palm Beach, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   It also is shedding several hospitals, including St. Luke Medical
Center in Pasadena, which are either old, under-performing or in
areas where Tenet lacks market-share strength. Tenet said Thursday
that it will close St. Luke in April.</TE>
<TE>   "Our strategy is either to be No. 1 in the market or a strong No.
2," Anderson said, adding that market share is what gives the company
leverage in contract negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the credit for these strategies goes to Tenet Chief
Executive Jeffrey C. Barbakow, former managing director of Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets in Los Angeles, who was brought in to oversee
in the early 1990s the settlement of the last major federal probe of
a hospital company, National Medical Enterprises, which was
subsequently renamed Tenet.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet officials said they also are expanding current facilities,
building several more emergency rooms and planning a 10-story
building for the USC teaching hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet also has increased spending on cardiology, orthopedics and
neurology.</TE>
<TE>   "Tenet has moved very aggressively in a band that runs across
Southern California, Texas, Louisiana and South Florida, where there
is a lot of population growth and aging baby boomers," said Charles
Lynch, an analyst with CIBC World Markets. "That's the driver of
their volume growth and their continued move from sub-acute to more
expensive acute care, to serve a swath of the American population
that is still very [physically] active, but finding it more painful
to maintain that activity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's both a push and pull. They are driving volume into their
hospitals with better doctors, services and facilities, and they are
in markets where there are more people who will use that health
care," Lynch added.</TE>

<HD>Toyota Buys Site in Tijuana</HD>

<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>Autos: Company says planned factory would produce
components and eventually vehicles</DL>
<LD>Toyota Motor Co. has purchased 700 acres southeast of downtown
Tijuana in Baja California and plans to develop it into a major
manufacturing facility, the company said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Several major auto suppliers eventually will locate on or near the
site Toyota is purchasing. Toyota will begin by supplying components
for light-truck assembly at its Fremont, Calif., plant but plans to
expand the production to the entire vehicle, sources close to the
deal said. The factory will be Toyota's first in Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   Mexico's federal commissioner of border affairs, Ernesto Ruffo,
told The Times in October that Toyota was near a decision on building
a Baja facility and was considering locations in Tijuana, Ensenada
and Mexicali.</LD>
<TE>   The facility will mean hundreds of millions of dollars in new
investment and at least 1,000 new jobs for Baja.</TE>
<TE>   The components to be made in Mexico now are produced in Long
Beach. Toyota said it plans to make other components in Long Beach
and does not anticipate layoffs among the 540 jobs there.</TE>
<TE>   "The Long Beach plant is still very much a part of our long-term
future," Dennis Cuneo, senior vice president for Toyota Motor
Manufacturing North America Inc., told Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   The Tijuana site selection caps intense competition among Mexican
states and cities for the economic benefits the Toyota facility will
generate. Monterrey and Guanajuato also were considered by Toyota,
real estate sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota currently has four other North American manufacturing
facilities in Indiana; Kentucky; Ontario, Canada; and in Fremont in
partnership with General Motors. The Tijuana land is in the Gandul
business zone, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   "They chose Baja because of the synergy available between the
Fremont and the Baja facilities," a real estate source said.</TE>

<HD>Founders Buy Back Webshots</HD>
<DH>Internet: Excite@Home sells photography site for $2.4
million after paying $82.5 million for it in 1999.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL LIEDKE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Three young entrepreneurs who struck it rich during the dot-com boom
took a stab at capitalizing on the high-tech crash Friday by paying
$2.4million for online photography site Webshots--the same service
they sold to Excite@Home for $82.5million in late 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Webshots co-founders Andrew Laakmann, 32, Narendra Rocherolle, 33,
and Nicholas Wilder, 29, reclaimed ownership of the service when U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Thomas Carlson approved the sale as part of
Excite@Home's liquidation. Redwood City, Calif.-based Excite@Home
plans to go out of business in March.</LD>
<LD>   For Excite@Home, Friday's deal represented another humiliating
reminder of how badly the Internet economy has crumbled since the
company went on a multibillion-dollar shopping spree in the late
1990s.</LD>
<TE>   Before selling Webshots at a 97% discount from the price it paid
in October 1999, Excite@Home sold Excite.com for $10 million and let
go of online greeting card service Blue Mountain for $35 million.
Excite@Home paid $6.7 billion and $780 million, respectively, for
those two sites in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   For Laakmann and his partners, the Webshots deal represents an
opportunity to keep their creation alive and make more money.</TE>
<TE>   The partners predict Webshots will be profitable within 60 days.
They say their confidence is well-founded because the site made money
soon after it was started in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   To generate revenue, Webshots plans to charge for some services.
The rates have yet to be determined. Many services will remain free
for the site's 13 million registered users, Laakmann said.</TE>
<TE>   After selling Webshots, the three co-founders continued to work on
the site as Excite@Home employees.</TE>
<TE>   To buy back the site, the Webshots co-founders formed a limited
partnership, Two Fold Photos.</TE>
<TE>   When it bought Webshots, Excite@Home paid Laakmann and his
partners in stock--a currency that plummeted from a split-adjusted
high of $59.75 in late 1999 to 15 cents before the company's
September bankruptcy filing.</TE>

<HD>Shares of Willamette Drop Sharply</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Willamette Industries Inc. shares fell 8.4%, their biggest drop in
more than a year, after the company rejected rival lumber-and-paper
maker Weyerhaeuser Co.'s $7.76-billion hostile takeover bid.</LD>
<LD>   The shares dropped $4.21 to $45.75, falling earlier to $43.61, the
biggest decline since October 1997. The companies held talks last
month over the bid of $55 per share for the first time since
Weyerhaeuser disclosed the offer more than a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a very bad outcome for shareholders if [Willamette] actually
lets this deal go away," said Steve Cohen, chief investment officer
of Kellner, Dileo &amp; Co. "It's extremely disappointing from every
shareholder's standpoint on how this board has conducted itself."</LD>
<TE>   Weyerhaeuser Chief Executive Steven Rogel has been pursuing
Portland, Ore.-based Willamette, at first privately, since he quit as
Willamette's CEO in December 1997 to run Weyerhaeuser. He wants
Weyerhaeuser, the third-biggest forest-products company, to become
bigger with larger customers. Analysts call Willamette's plants among
the most profitable in the business.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Weyerhaeuser, based in Federal Way, Wash., rose $1.53 to
$55.52. Both companies trade on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brokerage stocks surged Friday, led by discount players such as
Charles Schwab Corp., as investors pinned hopes of an improving
economy on big financial companies that benefit from stock market
strength.</LD>
<LD>   Schwab (ticker symbol: SCH) rose $1.24 to $18.09, while its
smaller rival E-Trade Group Inc. (ET) was up $1.19 to $12.29. Shares
in those companies have jumped more than 16% since Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street brokerages did well across the board, with Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter (MWD) up $2.82 to $59.64 and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
(MER) up $2.98 to $56.64. Investment banks Goldman Sachs Group (GS),
up $4.30 to $96.75 and Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc. (LEH), up $2.55 to
$69.01, also were significantly higher.</LD>
<TE>   "If you want to play a rebound in the market, these are the names
you want to play," said Ken Worthington, an analyst at CIBC World
Markets.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor contributing to the surging share prices was an
upgrade of the brokerage sector by Prudential Securities on Friday.
Analyst David Trone raised his rating on the group to "market
outperform" from "market perform," and said he expects to see the
economy climbing out of recession this year.</TE>

<LD>Optimism about U.S. stocks rose this week to its highest level since
the week of Aug. 10, according to a poll of independent investment
newsletter writers by Investors Intelligence.</LD>
<LD>   The percentage of newsletters considering themselves bullish, or
optimistic about the market, climbed to 49% last week from 48.4% the
previous week. Bullishness hit a four-year low of 33.7% after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The percentage of newsletters considering themselves bearish, or
pessimistic, also rose, to 27.5% from 27.3% the week before</LD>
<TE>   Those newsletters that aren't bullish or bearish expect a modest
near-term pullback in stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, peaks in optimism in the Investors Intelligence
survey often have signaled near-term tops in the market. When most
investors are bullish, they already have committed most of their
funds to the market.</TE>
<TE>   The bullish reading rose as high as 61.8% in early February of
last year--just as the market began to plunge after January's big
rally.</TE>

<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission is considering a plan for a
self-policing authority to punish accountants who fail to meet
professional standards, possibly by giving that power to an existing
organization.</LD>
<LD>   SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt has been under pressure from Congress to
improve accounting standards after Enron Corp. filed for the largest
Chapter 11 bankruptcy ever last month. Arthur Andersen was Enron's
accountant and is under SEC investigation, along with Enron, for
possible accounting and disclosure fraud.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC will open talks soon with the largest U.S. accounting
firms on developing tougher self-regulation, a spokesman for Pitt
said. Pitt said he expects the firms to agree either to creation of a
new self-regulatory organization or modification of existing
organizations that would be overseen by the SEC.</LD>

<LD>They are headstones in a cemetery without grass.</LD>
<LD>   The 175 torn and weathered pages form a tapestry of human loss
comparable to those other modern rosters of death, the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial and the AIDS Memorial Quilt.</LD>
<LD>   The images drawing crowds to the Karpeles Manuscript Library
Museum--"Missing--Last Seen at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11,
2001"--are familiar to almost everyone. Yet seeing these artifacts of
tragedy up close carries a power so overwhelming that viewers have burst
into tears.</LD>
<TE>   "A businesswoman came in today, smartly dressed," said Louis Nevaer,
the exhibitor behind the display of the famous missing persons photos
that blanketed New York in the days after the World Trade Center
disaster. "After a while, she dashed to the door, crying. We've had to
put in chairs upstairs for people who need to take a break."</TE>
<TE>   On the first leg of what promises to be an international tour, the
collection offers an intimate look at an American tragedy most of the
outside world saw only on television.</TE>
<TE>   "This is poignant beyond words," said Mary Lou LaBarge, visibly moved
as she left the museum earlier this week. "We didn't feel the immediacy
of it out here."</TE>
<TE>   To LaBarge and other visitors, seeing the fliers up close brought the
World Trade Center tragedy home. Some of the papers are faded, others
still bear duct tape that attached them to light posts, street signs or
walls. Others look like they were rescued from the trash.</TE>
<TE>   For Nevaer, communicating the tactile sense of the tragedy to those
outside New York City was an important part of what he was aiming for
when he created the exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   "I find a helplessness among people here," said Nevaer, a 39-year-old
author and activist from New York. "You were all sleeping when it
happened."</TE>
<TE>   The reason he brought the exhibit here first, he said, was that the
planes that crashed into the towers were bound for California.</TE>
<TE>   "In a sense we're completing that journey," Nevaer said.</TE>
<TE>   If it's a journey completed, it's an extraordinarily melancholy one.
The handbill-sized fliers tell the stories of people like Daniel Lopez,
who borrowed a cellular phone to call his sister from the 78th floor of
the north tower after the first plane hit. "I'm OK, but will remain here
to help evacuate people. See you soon," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "These were my brother's last words," the sister wrote under the
picture of Lopez. "He was always the type to help somebody in need."</TE>
<TE>   There is Roger Mark Rasweiler, the subject of what is believed to have
been the first flier posted in the hours after the tragedy. His daughter
went to the art department where she worked and ran off 500 copies of his
picture, which she posted around the city. And then there is "Isabel,"
for whom Nevaer seemed to feel a special affection.</TE>
<TE>   A note on the flier says simply, "Needs medicine." There is no last
name, no phone number. "We went through the New York Times listing of the
dead, but could never find her," he said.</TE>
<TE>   While the Smithsonian and the Museum of the City of New York plan to
preserve many of the fliers, Nevaer said his exhibit marks the first time
they have been seen outside New York.</TE>
<TE>   The fliers have a story all their own. Two rumors swept the city in
the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the twin towers. The first was
that thousands of people lay injured and unidentified in city hospitals.
The second, which got started after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani denied the
first, was that injured victims were wandering dazed among the ruins of
the trade center. Both rumors fed belief among the families that their
loved ones might not be dead, only lost.</TE>
<TE>   The placards were a way for relatives to feel they were doing
something to help, as well as providing expression for feelings of love
and grief. Soon there were thousands of fliers, posted outside hospitals,
train stations and other public buildings. Although there were about
90,000 fliers, they were posted for 500 to 600 people, Nevaer said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevaer said he was moved to start gathering the fliers in the days
after the tragedy. "After a week or two they started to tear in the
rain," he said. "It seemed disrespectful that they should be destroyed as
litter."</TE>
<TE>   Nevaer contacted a nonprofit human rights group he has worked with in
the past, the Mesoamerica Foundation, which contributed $12,000 to pay
for mounting the fliers. The National Guard helped collect them.</TE>
<TE>   After collecting the fliers, Nevaer tried to contact the families who
posted them. Uniformly, he said, relatives liked the idea of exhibiting
the fliers outside New York. In that way, the exhibition is similar to
the AIDS Memorial Quilt that has traveled the country, containing panels
listing the dead and dedications from those who loved them.</TE>
<TE>   Nevaer said he offered the exhibit to the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art, but was told that all the display space was booked. It wound up in
Santa Barbara after David and Marsha Karpeles offered their manuscript
museum, one of seven operated by the real estate investor and his wife.
The collection includes 1 million documents, said Director Norman Cohan.</TE>
<TE>   As he moved among the framed images, Nevaer constructed narratives
from the scant information, often nothing more than height, weight and
date of birth. "Look at this one," he said, pointing to the image of
David Campbell. The flier said he was on the 86th floor, but that was
crossed out and replaced with the inscription, 89th.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone went back and corrected this hundreds of times," Nevaer said.
"It shows how obsessed and dedicated these people were."</TE>
<TE>   Those going through the exhibition showed a similar passion. In the
condolence book, one woman described herself as "a New Yorker in
California. You will always live in our hearts."</TE>
<TE>   The dedications also revealed a hunger that came from witnessing
horrifying events at long distance.</TE>
<TE>   A man from Goleta said, " 'Missing' allows us all to see how beloved
they were and will always remain."</TE>

<HD>Capital of Big-Rig Piracy</HD>
<DH>Southern California leads the nation in the theft of truck cargo,
with law enforcement unable to stem the tide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A big rig lumbering at daybreak out of a San Bernardino truck yard
with a million-dollar load of cigarettes is swarmed by at least three
armed bandits. They jump on the running boards, smash the windows and
douse the driver's face with pepper spray.</LD>
<LD>   Within seconds, they handcuff the driver and his passenger, then
rumble down the road. The victims are later found unharmed, and that
night California Highway Patrol officers, after a stakeout, arrest eight
people unloading the cargo at an El Monte warehouse.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators, however, are still searching for the actual hijackers.</LD>
<TE>   The recent case was just a partial victory for law enforcement
officers in their otherwise losing war against such heists in Southern
California, which is the nation's capital for cargo theft.</TE>
<TE>   It could be cigarettes, diapers, Christmas trees, frozen shrimp,
computer chips, sex toys or manure. All of them and more have been
snatched.</TE>
<TE>   "Southern California is like a candy store to cargo thieves," said Jim
Harris of the 20-year-old Western States Cargo Theft Assn., a
Cypress-based organization of security specialists.</TE>
<TE>   All told, bandits in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino
and Ventura counties rip off about $2 million worth of assorted goods
each day, authorities estimate. Harris calculates that consumers in the
region pay as much as 20% more at retail to make up the losses.</TE>
<TE>   In terms of dollar losses and reported cargo thefts, 2001 probably set
a record, said FBI Supervising Agent Brett S. Millar. In Southern
California, "cargo theft losses are already the highest in the country,
with an estimated value of $600 million per year."</TE>
<TE>   The region has always been a breeding ground for such hijackers
because of the massive amounts of cargo moving through it around the
clock. The Los Angeles-Long Beach port complex--the nation's
busiest--each year handles more than 5 million shipping containers, with
cargo valued in excess of $170 billion. Los Angeles International Airport
ships 78% of the Western states' air cargo.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement authorities attribute the surge in thefts partly to
the sheer increase in freight movement in recent years. And they say
criminals have discovered that cargo heists generally carry lesser
penalties than drug dealing, with no start-up costs.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Los Angeles Police Department cargo theft investigator Mark
Zavala said the hottest merchandise on the black market right now
includes laptop computers and computer chips, as well as baby formula,
frozen seafood, toilet paper, clothing, dog food and cigarettes, all of
which can be easily sold at small retail outlets locally, in Mexico and
overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Disposable diapers are also popular, given that they do not have
serial numbers and sell quickly in low-income communities.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen this many reports of cargo theft in years," Zavala
said. "On Nov. 28, I recovered a load of stolen toys worth $100,000, and
a trailer taken in a San Joaquin case valued at $100,000. The next day, I
located a truck abandoned after a heist in Montebello. When I got back to
my office I found a new report on my desk saying $500,000 worth of
computer modems had been taken from El Monte."</TE>
<TE>   On the morning of Nov. 30, Zavala stood on a sidewalk in the shadow of
a Harbor Freeway overpass in South-Central Los Angeles interrogating
William Avery, 54, a truck driver from Hawthorne.</TE>
<TE>   Looking bedraggled and jittery beside his orange-and-red big rig,
Avery said: "I was sleeping in the cab about 3 a.m. when I heard someone
knocking on the door. It was a girl. She was kind of cute too. She asked
if she could come in."</TE>
<TE>   Wincing at the memory, Avery said, "There was a guy right behind her
with a gun."</TE>
<TE>   Avery said they forced him to drive a circuitous route, then emptied
his trailer of 50 Christmas trees.</TE>
<TE>   Avery then drove his truck back to the side street where the hijacking
occurred and called police. The case is under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the daunting statistics of theft, many drivers, warehouse
operations and freight shipping companies say they cannot afford the best
security systems available. Instead, they often rely on a few hired
guards, chain-link fences and padlocks to safeguard millions of dollars
in merchandise. Even so, law enforcement experts suggest that 60% to 80%
of all cargo theft incidents are "inside jobs" in which a freight hauler
or company employee shares information with thieves.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law requires that all interstate carriers have cargo
insurance. But few firms can survive more than two or three large cargo
theft losses because their insurance carriers often refuse to renew, said
Ron Lord, senior theft investigator for Great West Casualty Co. in
Knoxville, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Pacer International Inc., a shipping company, saw two of its truck
yards attacked by armed robbers in November, said the firm's director of
security, Norm Black.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 5, three men wearing ski masks cut a neat hole through a
security fence--just above an alarm wire and below the view of a video
camera--at Pacer's storage yard in Commerce, then sprayed a guard with
pepper spray, Black said. A few minutes later, he said, a driver noticed
the suspects "running around in the shadows" and leaned on his truck horn
to summon help.</TE>
<TE>   The intruders scurried off empty-handed. Ten days later, the company's
South Gate yard was raided by another band of robbers who wrapped a night
watchman in duct tape, then drove away in three Pacer trucks with about
$1 million worth of electronics equipment and Skechers athletic shoes.</TE>
<TE>   The trailers, he added glumly, were found empty.</TE>
<TE>   In the Long Beach headquarters of the multi-agency Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Cargo Criminal Apprehension Team, the latest heists are logged
on a large memo board. One by one, cargo theft investigator Sgt. Jim
LeBlanc lists hijacked trailers and victimized warehouses, and the value
of their cargo.</TE>
<TE>   Topping the list a few weeks ago were $850,000 worth of electronics
products ripped off in Rancho Dominguez, a $175,000 load of electric
razors stolen in Carson, $172,000 worth of computer monitors lifted in La
Mirada, and $20,000 in food taken in South Gate.</TE>
<TE>   "They steal anything on wheels," LeBlanc said.</TE>
<TE>   His Cargo Cats unit is one of four small law enforcement teams in
Southern California dedicated to thwarting cargo theft. The others are
the FBI's Interstate Theft Task Force, the CHP's Cargo Theft Interdiction
Program and the LAPD's Burglary Auto Theft Detail.</TE>
<TE>   All are struggling to keep up with mushrooming caseloads.</TE>
<TE>   In all of 2000, for example, Cargo Cats recovered about $12 million in
stolen property. As of Dec. 1, the most recent statistics show that it
had recovered about $16.5 million worth in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the CHP team opened 259 cargo theft investigations in 2000;
it opened 437 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Among them was the big cigarette cargo heist in San Bernardino. The
hijackers drove the truck to an undisclosed location where they unhooked
the trailer, CHP Sgt. John Antillion said. The criminals then drove the
truck, including the handcuffed driver and passenger, to the nearby
community of Bloomington, and left in another vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   The driver managed to call for help, and the CHP discovered his
trailer that afternoon still loaded with cigarettes. Under CHP
surveillance, several people picked up the trailer that night and took it
to an El Monte warehouse. Antillion believes the eight suspects arrested
there were hired to unload and broker the cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still looking for the actual robbers, but I'm confident we'll
get them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even though its ranks have shrunk because of reassignments for the
fight against terrorism, the local FBI team specializing in cargo theft
continues to collect intelligence and advise smaller agencies. The FBI
also participates in sting operations such as one that brought down a
gang led by Juan Luis Villalobos.</TE>
<TE>   Villalobos' gang targeted trucks, truck yards and distribution centers
across the West, authorities said, and returned to Los Angeles to fence
the merchandise through a thriving domestic and international black
market.</TE>
<TE>   From late 1998 to early 2000, the 44-year-old Mexican national and his
gang stole an estimated $7 million worth of sleeping bags, electrical
products, computers, athletic shoes, cereal, basketballs and tires,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   As is typical, the merchandise was offered to mom and pop stores and
fence operations for as little as 25% of its retail value.</TE>
<TE>   Villalobos, whose underground network included accomplices in Los
Angeles, Denver and Portland, Ore., was arrested by the FBI and
Washington State Patrol officers about 15 months ago in Seattle, FBI
Special Agent Eric Ives said. Villalobos recently pleaded guilty in U.S.
District Court in Los Angeles to charges of conspiracy, theft, and
possession of goods stolen from interstate and foreign commerce. He must
pay restitution of $4 million and spend more than seven years in federal
prison.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Villalobos' attorney, George Trejo Jr., said his
client had no choice but to plead guilty.</TE>
<TE>   "The feds planted a bug on his tractor-trailer in Washington, then
followed him all over the West," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Also convicted were members of Villalobos' ethnically diverse gang,
and brokers and shop owners who moved the items into local markets.</TE>
<TE>   David Vigil, 29, of Aurora, Colo., a Villalobos underling who
offloaded trucks for him and rented storage facilities and trailers for
stolen property, must spend two years in prison and pay $1.6 million
restitution.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview just after his sentencing, a contrite Vigil said he
was an unemployed Denver factory worker with a clean record when he was
recruited into Villalobos' crew. "It all started a few years ago when
some guys offered me $50 to help unload a big truck," he said. "After
that, they started giving me rock cocaine, and I got hooked on it."</TE>
<TE>   Before long, Vigil said, he was receiving payments of $1,000 to rent
storage units under his name. "Next thing you know," he said, "I was
buying more cocaine, and renting more U-Haul trucks and storage units for
them.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized the stuff was stolen . . . but I didn't care 'cause I was
high all the time," he said. "I made about $15,000 over nine or 10
months, and I smoked it, man. Now, the government is making me pay back
$1.6 million. That's what I get for what I did."</TE>
<TE>   On the day Villalobos and Vigil were sentenced, cargo theft
investigators were rushing from one fresh crime scene to another.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD's Zavala recovered a 48-foot trailer in Rosemead containing
14 pallets of diapers that had been stolen in Alhambra.</TE>
<TE>   The Cargo Cats reported six new heists, totaling $907,000 in value:
men's shirts out of Rialto; watches in San Bernardino; TVs out of Pomona;
camcorders in Montebello; baby products in Monrovia; and chrome auto
wheels in Vernon.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Loses Its 1st Serviceman to Enemy Fire</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: The Green Beret's death in an ambush shows the
high-tech campaign is still risky. A CIA agent is seriously injured.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A U.S. Army Special Forces soldier was killed Friday in a firefight
in eastern Afghanistan, becoming the first U.S. service member slain by
enemy action in three months of warfare, Pentagon officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The Green Beret was identified as Sgt. 1st Class Nathan R. Chapman,
31, of San Antonio, Texas, the Pentagon said. He was ambushed while on a
mission with allied Afghan fighters near Khowst, where Al Qaeda fighters
have congregated, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   A CIA officer who was part of the same intelligence-gathering mission
was seriously wounded in the fighting, although his injuries weren't
considered life-threatening, officials said. Both were evacuated from the
area by a U.S. military rescue team, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   The incident was a reminder that the Pentagon's precision-bombing
techniques and other advanced technology have enabled the U.S. to wage
massive military campaigns with remarkably few casualties. That the U.S.
has been able to accomplish so much in Afghanistan with only one soldier
killed by hostile fire "is a very powerful sign of American military
strength," retired Army Gen. Wesley K. Clark said on CNN.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, it underscored the fact that U.S. forces in the
country continue to face risks even with the Taliban regime ousted and
its allies in the Al Qaeda terror network scattered, officials noted.</TE>
<TE>   As the search for Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders continued Friday, the
commander believed to have been hiding the Taliban's supreme leader,
Mullah Mohammed Omar, reportedly surrendered to anti-Taliban forces.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Wahed Baghrani, who is believed to have sheltered Omar in a
remote mountainous area near Baghran, in south-central Afghanistan, is
helping the search for his former leader, according to the transitional
Afghan government.</TE>
<TE>   Army Gen. Tommy Franks, the commander of the Afghan campaign, said at
a news conference in Tampa, Fla., that allied troops have indications
that Omar is still in the Baghran region.</TE>
<TE>   Baghrani's surrender was reported by Abdullah Jan, a senior official
in the security section of the Afghan Interior Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the process of handing over heavy and light weapons is underway,"
Jan said. He said he didn't know why Baghrani was unable to simply hand
over Omar.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan troops as well as U.S. special operations troops were searching
for Omar in caves and mountain redoubts in the Baghran area, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The United States also gained custody of the former Taliban ambassador
to Pakistan and the Al Qaeda member who ran Osama bin Laden's training
camps, Associated Press reported Friday. Pakistan is turning over the
former envoy, Abdul Salam Zaeef, who would be one of the highest-ranking
Taliban officials to fall into U.S. hands, according to a senior U.S.
defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Qaeda member, Ibn Al-Shaykh al-Libi, has been taken to the
southern city of Kandahar for questioning, a U.S. official said, adding
that the detainee is considered a potentially rich source of information
about the terrorist organization.</TE>
<TE>   The main focus of the U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan is now the
area around Khowst, only a few miles from the border with Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. warplanes attacked a reported Al Qaeda compound in the region
Friday for the second straight day. U.S. officials said the area was
struck again because of intelligence suggesting that Al Qaeda fighters
were gathering at the site, possibly for a move across the border.</TE>
<TE>   The compound, which included caves and some buildings used for
training, is in an area that was struck by U.S. cruise missiles in 1998
in retaliation for the bombing of American embassies in Africa.</TE>
<TE>   In his news conference at Central Command headquarters, Franks said he
was "thankful every day that we have not lost more people than we have
lost in this fight."</TE>
<TE>   Chapman was married and had two young children. His parents, Will and
Lynn Chapman of Georgetown, Texas, said he "loved the Army and referred
to his unit as his second family," Associated Press reported late Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman, a member of the 1st Special Forces Group out of Ft. Lewis,
Wash., was the second American to lose his life in enemy action in the
war. Johnny "Mike" Spann, a CIA officer, died Nov. 25 in a riot by
Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners at a jail in the northern city of
Mazar-i-Sharif.</TE>
<TE>   Three U.S. soldiers were killed Dec. 5 when a U.S. bomb missed its
target. Since the war began Oct. 7, five other members of the military
have died in three accidents and an unexplained shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and other defense officials have
warned almost daily that the risks to U.S. forces remain high. U.S.
troops on the ground face great danger in their cave searches as well as
from ambushes, terrorist-style bombings of their temporary installations,
land mines and booby-traps, officials say.</TE>
<TE>U.S. Commander Defends Ground Tactics</TE>
<TE>   The Green Berets, in some cases working with CIA officers, have been
combing the region on intelligence-gathering missions with Afghan
fighters. They have been searching caves and bunkers, gathering weapons
and interrogating captured Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Franks said that a just-completed visit with troops had strengthened
his conviction that U.S. leaders were correct to ask Afghan allies to
take a large role in the ground fighting.</TE>
<TE>   "The plan we have exercised has been the appropriate plan, and I
wouldn't change it at all, because it makes sense when you have a willing
ally," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Franks also detailed the U.S. forces' progress in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   He said they have searched seven of the eight most promising cave
complexes in the mountainous Tora Bora area north of Khowst, where Al
Qaeda fighters and Bin Laden were believed to have taken refuge. The
search turned up a large number of bodies, as well as some heavy military
equipment, including a tank, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Franks said a search of more than 40 sites in Afghanistan has
uncovered no evidence that Al Qaeda and Taliban officials had been able
to develop chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. But the search showed
"considerable indication of interest and desire by Al Qaeda to acquire
weapons of mass destruction," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One aspect of the manhunt has drawn some scrutiny. One version of
leaflets dropped over Afghanistan to win the surrender of remaining
Taliban or Al Qaeda fighters is facing questions about accuracy. It
includes a photo depicting a clean-shaven, shorn Bin Laden in Western
clothing and says, "The murderer and coward has abandoned you."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld was asked Thursday whether people, especially in Muslim

fabricates evidence. "That is a possibility, that people will say
something that's not true," Rumsfeld replied. "There's nothing much we
can do about it."</TE>
<TE>U.S. Now Holding 270 Prisoners of War</TE>
<TE>   At Central Command, Franks said that more than 270 Taliban and Al
Qaeda prisoners are now under U.S. control, including American Talib John
Walker Lindh, who is one of eight prisoners aboard the amphibious assault
ship Bataan in the Arabian Sea. Some prisoners will be moved to the U.S.
Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, within 10 days, Franks said. No
decision has been made on when or where to move Lindh, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Franks said the government of Kyrgyzstan has agreed to allow the
United States to use a military base there as a transport hub for U.S.
aircraft involved in the Afghan war. Arrangements, however, are
incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, a U.S. defense official said the Pentagon has stepped up
airborne surveillance along the coast of Somalia to watch for the arrival
of any Al Qaeda fighters.</TE>
<TE>   The East African nation is largely ungoverned, and U.S. officials
believe that the defeated terrorist organization may seek refuge there.
But the defense official said the extra reconnaissance doesn't mean that
U.S. forces are planning to make Somalia the next target of their
conventional military campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In southern Afghanistan, the security situation appeared to be
deteriorating in the Kandahar area, according to Stephanie Bunker, a
spokeswoman for the United Nations in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N.'s security assessment team found that there was random rocket
and gunfire both in the former Taliban stronghold and in the surrounding
area. The security situation is "not good," Bunker said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Halts Aid to Iraqi Opposition</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Despite a growing drumbeat to expand the war on terrorism to Iraq,
U.S. officials this week suspended key funding to the leading Iraqi group
opposing President Saddam Hussein because it has failed to account for
tens of millions of dollars in U.S. aid.</LD>
<LD>   The Iraqi National Congress, based in London, was formally notified
Thursday that an audit of the group had revealed serious "financial
management and internal control weaknesses" in its handling of U.S.
funds, according to the State Department. The flaws encompass everything
from failure to provide receipts to questionable use of funds.</LD>
<LD>   The concern about the INC's use of U.S. aid underscores the difficulty
the Bush administration faces as it debates what to do about Hussein's
regime. Washington remains committed to ousting the Iraqi president, but
problems with the INC have slowed and complicated the effort.</LD>
<TE>   Besides questions about the use of aid managed by the State
Department, the INC has also failed--because of its management
problems--to use most of the $97 million allocated to it by Congress
under the 1998 Iraqi Liberation Act, U.S. officials say. So far, the INC
has used less than $5 million of the money, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The conflicts over money reflect a fundamental split between the
United States and the opposition group in the effort to change the regime
in Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   The INC, led by Ahmad Chalabi, is pushing hard for the U.S. to foot
the bill for largely covert operations in Iraq. But the United States
believes that the organization first has to build a viable operation and
attract a wider following both in Iraq and in the region. So far, U.S.
officials say, the group has failed to make significant progress on those
fronts.</TE>
<TE>   "They want us to support programs that take them into Iraq, and we
don't want to do that yet," an administration official said. "The United
States is not ready to take that step because of the consequences."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials are concerned, for example, about what might happen
even with a food aid program operated by the group in Iraq. The danger,
the officials say, is not only that Iraq might arrest INC operatives and
put them on trial but also that the group might use the program to
provoke an Iraqi response--and perhaps force U.S. military intervention.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a group like the INC was supposed to be--an umbrella for the
opposition with resources that people can turn to and use," the
administration official said. "We would like to see their [media]
operating out in the region, building their case. We would like them to
take advantage of a lot of training that's available. But they're not
doing it. They're intent only on going back inside Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   The INC has not made serious headway in ousting Hussein since its
leadership was forced to flee in 1996, when the CIA-backed operation in
northern Iraq collapsed because of fighting among its factions and
pressure from Iraqi troops.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the opposition group within the administration express
admiration for Chalabi's commitment to overthrowing Hussein. But they are
concerned about his domination of the INC.</TE>
<TE>   Such differences over strategies led to an open split between the U.S.
and the INC in September, when the previous State Department grant of $25
million expired.</TE>
<TE>   When the group submitted a request for a new set of programs costing
$25 million, it asked that $17 million of it be approved for operations
in Iraq. The Bush administration rebuffed that request and approved only
$8 million.</TE>
<TE>   The INC said it wanted all or nothing, according to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   To show ongoing interest, the U.S. still provided $800,000 a month to
the INC--until a recent report by the U.S. inspector general's office
instructed the State Department to "withhold or at least restrict future
funding to the INC" until the group improves its accounting methods.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the audit, the State Department cut funds for the INC's
Office of Mobilization and Coordination, which was set up to support
people in training at the Pentagon, U.S. officials said. Since the
September split over funding, the INC has not sent any new trainees.</TE>
<TE>   "We repeatedly asked the INC to send names and the Pentagon has left
vacancies in its program, but without trainees we can't continue to fund
the office set up to support them," said a source familiar with the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department also cut funds for the INC's Information
Collection program, which is largely a news organization. Questions have
been raised about the program's high costs, especially since the audit
found no time cards for employees or receipts for expenditures, among
other things, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department is also investigating funds for the group's
Office of Humanitarian Affairs, in part because of "its failure to
propose a viable humanitarian program" for the Iraqi people.</TE>
<TE>   "The INC always accuses the State Department of withholding funds
because it doesn't support the INC cause," said Henri J. Barkey, a former
State Department policy planner now at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania.
"But, unfortunately, it was actually the INC that came up short every
time in terms of providing accurate accounting and proper documentation
and not living up to deadlines."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say there have been improvements in the group's
operation. INC officials liked to fly first class on overseas trips,
preferably on British Airways. Under U.S. law, however, aid grantees must
fly in coach on American carriers. The INC has begun to comply with these
kinds of basic rules, sources say.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say they are committed to restoring the full
$25-million grant from the State Department if the INC will cooperate
with improving its management.</TE>
<TE>   The INC will still get $500,000 this month from the State Department.</TE>

<HD>Dolly's Arthritis Raises New Fears About Cloning</HD>
<DH>Biotech: Sheep born in '96 may be prematurely aging. But scientists
don't know whether a genetic defect is to blame.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>A case of arthritis in Dolly the sheep has renewed concerns that
the world's first cloned mammal may be aging prematurely.</LD>
<LD>   Ian Wilmut, the professor who cloned Dolly in 1996, revealed Friday
that the sheep began to limp several weeks ago and was found to have
arthritis--an illness common in older sheep.</LD>
<LD>   He said scientists don't know whether Dolly's arthritis, in her left
hip, is a fluke or a genetic defect resulting from cloning, and he
suggested that further research is needed.</LD>
<TE>   "The only way we can discover this is by collectively producing a very
large number of clones and looking to see if the incidence of arthritis
and other conditions is encased in clones, as distinct from animals
produced by normal methods," Wilmut told reporters at the Roslin
Institute near Edinburgh, Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   "We know from our previous research that only a small proportion of
embryos that reproduce develop to become live offspring. It appears from
Dolly's condition that one of the other outcomes from this [cloning] will
prove that some of the animals will be more vulnerable to some diseases,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists who produce cloned animals must monitor their health
throughout their life, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Dolly has been a symbol of success for geneticists, and evidence that
her condition is the result of a genetic problem would be seen as a
serious setback.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since she was cloned from a 6-year-old ewe and shown to the world
as a 7-month-old on Feb. 23, 1997, scientists have debated Dolly's true
age. Is she 5 years old, based on her date of birth, or is she in effect
11, based on the age of genetic material from which she was created?</TE>
<TE>   In most regards, Dolly is a normal, healthy sheep. She has given birth
to six healthy lambs and some that did not survive--about the same rate
of live offspring as for a naturally born ewe, Wilmut said. None of her
lambs shows any signs of abnormality.</TE>
<TE>   Wilmut's team already suspected that Dolly was aging prematurely. In
1999, the team saw the first possible symptoms under the microscope. A
part of Dolly's chromosomes was found to have shortened more than was
normal for her years.</TE>
<TE>   The chromosome structure involved is called a telomere--a long
fragment of DNA that sits on the end of each chromosome in a cell like
the tip of a shoelace. Each time a cell replicates, a fragment of the
telomere is broken off and lost. When the whole telomere is gone, the
chromosome breaks down, leaving the cell vulnerable to disease and death.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists don't know whether the shortening of telomeres is a cause
of aging or simply a marker for it. But the evidence from Dolly indicates
that while a newborn animal gets full-length telomeres, a clone receives
shortened telomeres more like those of its genetic parent. In Dolly's
case, her telomeres are about 20% shorter than those of uncloned sheep of
the same age.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, work reported in 2000 by other researchers using
mice did not show any shortening of telomeres in clones, leading to
doubts about how widespread the effect may be.</TE>
<TE>   Wilmut said in a telephone interview that he did not know whether
there was any connection between the shortened cell structures and the
development of arthritis.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't even know if the arthritis has anything to do with cloning
at all. It could be chance," Wilmut said. He added that Dolly has had an
unusual life, housed in a pen and living in the scientific limelight.</TE>
<TE>   "At one point she was overweight and spoiled. This may sound silly,
but also she has spent a lot of time standing on her back legs to get
food from the journalists and photographers. Sheep don't normally stand
on their back legs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Wilmut called the development of arthritis
"disappointing" and said it is proof of the need for more research into
cloning techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Dolly was cloned by destroying the nucleus of a sheep egg and
replacing it with a nucleus from a cell from the 6-year-old ewe. Wilmut
has shifted his research from sheep to mice to better understand the
cloning process. Mice take just 21 days to reproduce, whereas the
gestation period for a sheep is 150 days.</TE>
<TE>   "With mice, it's easier to work with 100 embryos in a day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Animal rights groups and other opponents of cloning say Dolly's
arthritis is further proof that technology has outstripped knowledge of
the consequences of cloning and is leading scientists into dangerous
territory. They also oppose genetic engineering, or changing an animal's
genes, because they believe that altering one aspect of an animal's
system will affect other functions.</TE>
<TE>   Two rival research teams announced this week that they have cloned
pigs that were genetically modified so that their transplanted organs
won't be rejected by humans. One of those companies, PPL Therapeutics, is
the Scottish group that worked with the Roslin Institute to produce
Dolly.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists are aiming to cultivate pig hearts, kidneys and other
organs for transplant into human beings to make up for a shortage of
human organs.</TE>
<TE>   Wilmut said the birth of the piglets is "very significant." The cloned
piglets are female, and males are due to be born within months. The pigs
then will be mated and, within a year, blood and tissue tests can be
conducted "to confirm what we predicted 15 years ago," Wilmut said.</TE>

<HD>The 'Crime' of Being a Young Refugee</HD>
<DH>Australia: Hundreds face years in lockup. Doctors warn of harmful
effects.</DH>
<SE>Second of two parts
</SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SYDNEY, Australia
</DL>
<LD>Thurgam al Abbadi has never been convicted of a crime or sentenced
to prison, but he is locked up indefinitely here behind high metal fences
and razor wire.</LD>
<LD>   A refugee from Iraq, he has spent two years with his family in
Australian detention centers. He has no idea when he will get out.</LD>
<LD>   "They think we are criminals," he said bitterly during a recent
interview at the Villawood Immigrant Detention Center in suburban Sydney.
"There is no freedom."</LD>
<TE>   Thurgam, angry and disillusioned, turned 12 in November.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other Western-style democracies, Australia has a policy of
locking up all applicants for political asylum who have arrived without
proper documentation. Some remain in custody for years while the
government decides their fate.</TE>
<TE>   Children who arrive without their parents are locked up with adults in
the country's booming chain of detention centers, run by a private
American-owned company. A handful of children born in detention have
never lived anywhere else.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors worry that the long-term confinement of children in facilities
where they frequently witness violence and are denied adequate schooling
is causing serious psychological harm. Some children, they fear, will
never recover.</TE>
<TE>   Several children have attempted suicide. Others have gone on hunger
strikes. At least three teenage boys have sewn their lips shut to protest
their incarceration and treatment, according to detainees.</TE>
<TE>   Some officials say the detention centers are worse than the country's
prisons. Human rights activists worry that when long-term detainees are
eventually granted asylum and released, they will be so psychologically
scarred by their experience that they will have difficulty adapting to
life in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Children Out of Detention, a citizens group opposed to the mandatory
incarceration of children, says that guards have the authority to
strip-search anyone older than 10 and that children as young as 3 have
been placed with parents in the high security lockup used for punishment.</TE>
<TE>   A 2-year-old was put in leg locks for 45 minutes and an 8-year-old boy
was handcuffed, the group says. Children at the centers generally receive
no schooling after they turn 12, and even up to that age it is not always
available.</TE>
<TE>Sexual Abuse a Concern</TE>
<TE>   Some former staff members say that the detention system creates
opportunities for sexual abuse of children and that allegations of abuse
are not properly investigated.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister John Howard contends that he must take a hard line
against unwanted refugees because the country of 19 million people cannot
absorb large numbers of immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   The incarceration of all asylum seekers is part of a strategy to make
Australia appear as unattractive as possible to refugees overseas.
Detention of the refugees also makes it easier to handle their cases,
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "We detain people in order to have them available for processing and
ensure they are available for removal if they have no lawful entitlement
to be here," said Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock, one of the
architects of the tough refugee policy.</TE>
<TE>   The government reports that 582 children are in detention, including
53 unaccompanied by any family member. Ruddock says many of the
unaccompanied minors are teenage boys who would likely have been fighting
if they had been in Afghanistan. Releasing any children, he says, would
encourage parents to send their offspring alone to Australia in the hope
that they could join them later.</TE>
<TE>   The minister maintains that all long-term detainees remain locked up
by their own choice. They are free to go back to their homeland any time,
he says, or to a country through which they passed en route to Australia.</TE>
<TE>   "They believe if they stick it out long enough, they will break our
resolve," he said. "Nobody is held against their will."</TE>
<TE>Seeing 'a Hopeless Life'</TE>
<TE>   Shana Avesta would disagree. A refugee from Iran, she has been
incarcerated since November 1999 when she arrived in Australia with her
family at the age of 11. Her father, Hossein Avesta, fled with the family
from Iran because he feared imprisonment or execution for criticizing the
government.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Shana was enthusiastic about the new life she expected to
begin after a brief period in detention. But her father's request for
asylum was rejected, and since then she has remained at the Curtin
Immigration Reception and Processing Center in Western Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Citing confidentiality rules, Australian officials would not discuss
Hossein Avesta's case or that of any other individual, including those
who have remained in custody for years. The Avestas are attempting to
overturn the government's decision in court.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement to the family's attorney, Shana described what it is
like in detention.</TE>
<TE>   "I have seen ill people who hang and cut themselves and a hopeless
life," she said. "I have seen fire and violence, children and women on
the floor when they were crying and screaming and a lot more."</TE>
<TE>   When Hossein Avesta and his three family members arrived, they were
split up and assigned to live with other families. After a month, Shana
said, her father could not endure the separation of the family any
longer. He held a piece of glass to his throat and threatened to cut
himself until the authorities relented and let the family stay together.</TE>
<TE>   In August, after the family's request for asylum was rejected for the
second time, she and her brother, Parviz, now 17, went on a hunger strike
to protest their conditions. Parviz sewed his lips together and refused
to cut the stitches. Their hunger strike lasted for 25 days.</TE>
<TE>   "We are punished same as criminals and called by numbers, not names,"
said Shana, now 13. "We are same as animal--they feed us in cage. I don't
want this food--I want my freedom. That's why my brother and I decided to
hunger strike and protest to show this life [isn't] worth anything to
us."</TE>
<TE>   Hossein Avesta said Shana lost more than 20 pounds during her protest.
She is now completely withdrawn and spends her time alone, seldom talking
or playing with girls her age, he said. She is frightened and anxious and
has difficulty sleeping.</TE>
<TE>   Shana learned English in detention and enjoyed going to school, the
only break from her prison-like routine, but since her hunger strike she
has been prohibited from classes.</TE>
<TE>   "In Australia, my children have forgotten how to laugh and have
forgotten how to smile," he said in a document prepared for court. "They
have lost every last moment of their childhood and will never be the same
again."</TE>
<TE>   Howard won reelection in November largely because of his strong
anti-refugee stance, but a growing number of citizen activists and
officials has begun criticizing the government's approach.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the disapproval stems from the treatment of detainees by
guards employed by Australasian Correctional Management, the private
company that runs the detention centers. The firm is a subsidiary of the
American company Wackenhut Corrections Corp., which was founded by former
FBI agent George R. Wackenhut.</TE>
<TE>   Ron McLeod, the government ombudsman, concluded last year that
detainees had fewer rights than convicted criminals and that detention
center guards were less accountable than prison guards. McLeod said he is
particularly concerned that women and children were kept in detention and
that "there was little distinction between their treatment and that of
the predominantly single male population."</TE>
<TE>   Australian Human Rights Commissioner Sev Ozdowski says he would
investigate allegations that children were manhandled by guards.</TE>
<TE>   Ozdowski says the agency would examine whether Australia was living up
to its responsibilities under the international Convention on the Rights
of the Child, which says children should be detained only as a last
resort and only for the shortest possible time.</TE>
<TE>   Many youths in detention have joined adults in demonstrations that
have turned violent and been suppressed by guards using water cannons and
tear gas.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Vose, a Perth Children's Court magistrate handling the case of
two teenage detainees accused of throwing rocks during one protest, says
violence is inevitable when young people are locked up indefinitely. The
two defendants, ages 15 and 17, had been detained for 18 months with no
end in sight.</TE>
<TE>   "These boys will spend a substantial period of their youth in jail for
nothing," the judge said. He said he "would be doing them a favor" to
send them to juvenile hall.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Aamer Sultan, a Baghdad-trained physician, is studying the effects
of long-term detention on asylum seekers and concludes that some suffer
serious psychological harm.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't have to go far to see the subjects of his study. He has
been locked up at the Villawood detention center for 2 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   He says he fled Iraq in 1999 after he was accused of aiding the
opposition to President Saddam Hussein. He escaped to Turkey, then flew
to Sydney and asked for asylum. Australia rejected his application but
cannot send him back to Iraq because the two governments have no
diplomatic relations. In Sultan's view, he is serving an indeterminate
sentence at Villawood.</TE>
<TE>   "By law you are not a criminal, but you spend the rest of your life in
prison," he said during an interview at the center. "We are not paying
for what we have done. We are paying for what we are. I think we came to
a very racist country. I think that we made a fatal mistake."</TE>
<TE>   For his study, he observed 36 detainees for more than a year and
watched as their condition steadily deteriorated. In 33 of the 36 cases,
he concluded that long-term detention induced psychoses or severe
depressive illness.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote a brief summary of his research that was published last year
in the prestigious British medical journal Lancet and co-wrote another
article published in December in the Medical Journal of Australia.</TE>
<TE>   He notes that many refugees seeking asylum were imprisoned or tortured
in their homelands and are psychologically vulnerable. But at Villawood,
he wrote in Lancet, the treatment of detainees appears arbitrary,
deliberately harsh, culturally insensitive and disrespectful.</TE>
<TE>   "I and my fellow detainees came in search of freedom after suffering
extreme persecution in our home countries," he wrote. "What has shocked
us most is that our human rights have been profoundly violated again,
this time by a country that is supposed to respect the principles of
human rights. If a Western country can do this and get away with it, what
hope do we have?"</TE>
<TE>   One of the most poignant cases he studied is that of Shayan Bedraie,
now 6. By all accounts, Shayan was a bright and happy boy when he arrived
from Iran with his family in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   His parents were denied asylum, a decision they have appealed. They
have been in custody for 20 months and are now at Villawood.</TE>
<TE>   Shayan was newly arrived in Australia when he saw a fellow detainee
try to kill himself by setting his room on fire. Shayan later witnessed
two more inmates cut themselves in apparent suicide attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Deeply affected by detention and the gory scenes he witnessed, Shayan
stopped eating and communicating. The detention center staff hospitalized
him eight times for intravenous feeding and counseling.</TE>
<TE>   When given a chance to draw, Shayan's pictures are of guards with
batons and fences with razor wire.</TE>
<TE>   Medical staff recommended that the boy be removed from detention but
kept with his family. Instead, the government placed him with a foster
family outside Villawood. His parents are taken to see him twice a week
for two hours at a time.</TE>
<TE>   "People overseas still believe like we used to that Australia is a
real humanitarian country," said his father, Mohammad. "They will not
understand until they are here, and then it is too late."</TE>
<TE>   Shana, the 13-year-old who went on a hunger strike, says she does not
understand why Australia hates the refugees so much.</TE>
<TE>   "Is there anybody outside to answer me?" she asked. "Why we shouldn't
be loved? Why we shouldn't be part of you? Why we shouldn't see your
smile, your care, your open arms instead of those dark officers with
black boots and buckles. What is life for us? Where is happiness and
childhood?"</TE>

<HD>Jobless Rate Nears a 7-Year High; Political Debate Shifts</HD>
<DH>Economy: Democrats and GOP agree on need for stimulus but disagree
on who is to blame for 5.8% unemployment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>America shed 124,000 more jobs last month, driving the nation's
unemployment rate to a near-seven-year high of 5.8% and shifting the
political debate from war needs to economic fixes.</LD>
<LD>   Although the new job losses announced Friday by the Labor Department
represented a slowdown from the fierce pace of layoffs immediately after
the September terrorist attacks, they struck at parts of the
economy--such as manufacturing--that were thought to be on the mend.
Their dimensions were partially masked by unexpected hiring in health
care and government that analysts said is unlikely to continue.</LD>
<LD>   Spurred in part by the new numbers and in part by the arrival of
another congressional election year, both Republicans and Democrats
seemed suddenly reawakened to the political dangers of rising joblessness
and tumbling growth.</LD>
<TE>   President Bush is scheduled to appear in Ontario today to tout his
latest tax-cut plan among Latino business leaders and then move on to
Portland, Ore., which has been particularly hard hit by cutbacks in high
tech and electronics.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) blasted Bush on Friday for
last year's tax cuts, asserting that they led to "the most dramatic
fiscal deterioration in our nation's history."</TE>
<TE>   "The new numbers are pretty ugly," said Donald H. Straszheim, a Los
Angeles economic consultant, former head of the Milken Institute and
former chief economist with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. "They show the economy
wasn't declining as fast in December as it did in previous months, but it
was still declining."</TE>
<TE>   December's loss of 124,000 jobs followed November's loss of 371,000
and October's 448,000 and brings the total number of positions erased in
the last year to 1.1 million, the largest annual job decline in two
decades, according to Labor Department figures.</TE>
<TE>   The new losses helped push the unemployment rate up from 5.6% in
November to 5.8%. The increase fell particularly heavily on traditionally
disadvantaged groups. Over the last year, unemployment among blacks has
climbed from 7.5% to 10.2% and Latino joblessness has jumped from 5.8% to
7.9%, according to government statistics.</TE>
<TE>   But in a curious turn of events, it has been the white-collar,
college-educated workers most favored during the 1990s expansion who are
now suffering some of the steepest job losses and largest jobless
increases.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics show, for example, that the unemployment rate for college
graduates has more than doubled from 1.5% a year ago December to 3.1%
last month. By contrast, the rate for high school graduates climbed by
only a little more than a third, from 3.5% to 4.9%.</TE>
<TE>   "This is shaping up to be a much-higher-end recession than the last
one," said Paul E. Harrington, associate director of Northeastern
University's Center for Labor Market Studies in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Investors and many analysts greeted the latest job figures as evidence
recovery is just around the corner. "The recession is ending," declared
Robert V. DiClemente, chief U.S. economist with Salomon Smith Barney in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   But the end of the recession will provide little relief for ordinary
Americans if the growth that replaces it is inadequate to revive
corporate hiring and reverse the employment slump.</TE>
<TE>   That's what happened in the early 1990s, when the economy began
recovering but the jobless rate kept right on climbing for 15 more
months, a postwar record. And that is what has both Republicans and
Democrats worried in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials went out of their way Friday to avoid
any claims of improvement based on the slowdown in job losses.</TE>
<TE>   The new job figures "suggest that the recession continued in
December," said Bush's chief economic advisor, Lawrence B. Lindsey.
"Unemployment is too high and rising."</TE>
<TE>   Bush and his aides have signaled that they will revive calls for
congressional passage of an economic stimulus package, despite the fact
that even many economists who informally advise the administration say it
is unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   Aides said the administration would seek to portray the economy's
troubles as a Bin Laden, rather than Bush, recession. They will argue
that the abrupt switch from budget surpluses to deficits is a product of
the war on terrorism, rather than the results of Bush's $1.35-trillion
tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid the fate of his father, who lost his bid for a second term by
being seen as insensitive to the damage of the early-1990s recession, the
current president and his aides will hammer home the administration's
concern for the jobless.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were unemployed and someone said to me the economy will recover
sooner or later, I would say I'd rather have sooner," Lindsey said in an
interview Friday. The administration will seek to speed improvement with
new business tax cuts, moving up already approved personal tax cuts as
well as some extra aid for unemployed workers.</TE>
<TE>   Like the president, congressional Democrats saw little hope in
Friday's job numbers and pledged to renew efforts to approve an economic
stimulus package. The earlier effort died in the political cross-fire
between GOP demands for tax cuts and Democratic calls for new spending.</TE>
<TE>   But Daschle signaled Friday that Democrats will offer a mirror-image
account of the economy, laying blame for both the recession and
Washington's new deficits at Bush's doorstep.</TE>
<TE>   And in an inversion of the political conventional wisdom, Democrats
will argue that they, rather than the Republicans, are the keepers of the
fiscal flame and defenders of balanced budgets.</TE>
<TE>   "A decade ago, our economy was shrinking. . . . We were running record
annual budget deficits with no end in sight. . . . Some people feared
we'd never get out of that fiscal hole. But we did," Daschle said Friday.
"And we did it the old-fashioned way. In 1993, [Democrats] made a
decision: no more living beyond our means."</TE>
<TE>   While the political parties spar, economists said the nation's
employment picture will continue deteriorating, and no one is quite sure
for how long.</TE>
<TE>   The extent of December's job loss was partially masked by the addition
of 31,000 jobs in the health-care industry and the hiring of an extra
63,000 employees by state and local governments. Labor Department figures
showed that the private-sector job loss, which did not include either of
these gains, totaled 187,000.</TE>
<TE>   Among the hardest-hit sectors was manufacturing, where economists had
claimed to have spotted the early signs of improvement. Manufacturers
slashed payrolls by an additional 133,000, bringing the total for the
year to 1.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   The airline and travel industries, which were especially hurt by the
terrorist attacks, continued to shed jobs. Airlines dropped 26,000 more
workers. Transportation services, which include travel agencies, cut
6,000. The help-supply industry, which includes temporary-help agencies,
slashed 55,000 jobs. Since September 2000, the industry has dropped
almost 700,000 workers and shrunk by 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Even industries that usually boost employment for the holiday season
did not do so in sufficient numbers to register in government figures.
After being adjusted for seasonal factors, retail employment dropped by
77,000, the fifth month in a row of decline. Among retailers, only car
dealerships added workers to cope with the buying binge set off by
no-interest financing. Dealerships hired 4,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   From a working person's point of view, one of the few bright spots in
the latest report was a 7-cent jump to $14.61 in the average hourly wages
of production and nonsupervisory employees, who make up about 80% of the
nation's work force.</TE>

<HD>Terrorist Suspect Wants Trial on TV</HD>
<DH>Law: Moussaoui's lawyers cite fairness in backing a Court TV bid.
Justice Dept. is opposed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.
</DL>
<LD>Lawyers for the only man charged in connection with the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks urged a federal judge Friday to televise his trial,
saying it would provide "an additional layer" of fairness to the
proceeding.</LD>
<LD>   Zacarias Moussaoui's team of public defenders filed the motion in
support of an application by Court TV, which is seeking to broadcast the
trial, set to begin in October.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department said Friday it opposed Court TV's motion,
contending it is neither constitutionally required nor a good idea.</LD>
<TE>   Moussaoui faces six felony charges, including conspiring with Osama
bin Laden, the 19 hijackers and others to murder thousands of people in
the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. If convicted, the
33-year-old French citizen of Moroccan descent could face the death
penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Moussaoui recognizes that the American criminal justice system
will be on display for the entire world as the trial of this action
proceeds," said Edward MacMahon, one of Moussaoui's court-appointed
attorneys, in a legal memorandum.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui, however, opposes Court TV's efforts to have pretrial
proceedings televised, saying that airing such procedures could taint the
prospective jury pool, according to the motion.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that picking a jury in this case will be an extremely
difficult if not impossible process," the request said.</TE>
<TE>   One legal expert said the motions by Court TV, Moussaoui and the
Justice Department present U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema with
compelling reasons both for and against allowing the trial to be
televised.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, terrorists have sought a public forum in which to air
their views, and, given the events of Sept. 11, the Moussaoui trial is
expected to be the most closely followed terrorism trial in American
history, said Khaled Abou El Fadl, a professor at UCLA law school who
specializes in Islamic law and terrorism.</TE>
<TE>Defendant Refused to Enter a Plea</TE>
<TE>   Already, Moussaoui, an admitted Islamic militant, has invoked the name
of God in refusing to enter a plea to the charges against him at his
arraignment earlier this week. Brinkema entered a not-guilty plea for
him.</TE>
<TE>   But the fact that the Moussaoui trial will be so closely watched and
highly politicized is precisely why it should be televised, Abou El Fadl
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The saving grace of every independent legal system in the history of
democracy has been public openness and accessibility; the concept that
whatever the government does, it must do before everyone's eyes," Abou El
Fadl said. "It puts the government, and even judges, on their best
behavior when they know they are being observed."</TE>
<TE>   Abou El Fadl said prosecutors, judges and even juries "tend to become
far more reserved" when they know that there is a public audience
following their every move. And while reports of the trial by print and
television reporters also provide the public with such an accounting, "it
doesn't afford the same level of security and protection of the integrity
of the system as televising a trial does," Abou El Fadl said. "It is
crucial in these types of procedures that we present an image of complete
fairness so there are no feelings of conspiratorial attitudes" on the
part of the judge, prosecutors and jury.</TE>
<TE>   Brinkema has set a hearing for Wednesday to take up Court TV's motion
and related issues.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Moussaoui had no comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The government has alleged that Moussaoui participated actively in the
terrorist conspiracy and may have been trying to become a hijacker on one
of the planes. Moussaoui was detained in Minnesota in August on
immigration violations, however, and was in custody Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>Justice Department Outlines Opposition</TE>
<TE>   In arguing that Court TV's motion should be denied, the Justice
Department said televising federal criminal proceedings is prohibited by
federal rules of criminal procedure and for other reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "Although a weighing of the various arguments for and against
televising these proceedings is not appropriate [in the motion], there
are in fact compelling reasons why these proceedings should not be
televised," according to the Justice Department's court filing.</TE>
<TE>   Brinkema's decision to start the trial in October was made over
defense attorneys' objections that they will not have enough time to
prepare. They also said the date is too close to the first anniversary of
the attacks in New York and at the Pentagon, which is less than two miles
from the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Brinkema also gave prosecutors until March 29 to say whether they
intend to seek the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Court TV, a cable television network that broadcasts legal proceedings
and is owned by AOL Time Warner Inc. and Liberty Media Co., argued in its
motion that all 50 states allow some type of television coverage in their
courtrooms and that 37 states allow cameras in criminal proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   The network also said the ban on televising federal criminal trials is
unconstitutional on grounds that 1st Amendment protections give the
public the right to have access to courtroom proceedings.</TE>

<DL>BAGRAM, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Just minutes into the workday, the Explosive Ordnance Disposal team
ran into its first perilous dilemma: The Afghan villagers wanted to keep
their rocket.</LD>
<LD>   The 122-millimeter, Soviet-made white tube of high explosives was
lying half inside the perimeter of the base here that U.S. forces control
along with anti-Taliban fighters, and half in one of the numerous
villages around the field. A dozen children were crowded around, poking
it. A village elder said he wanted to keep it.</LD>
<LD>   "We'll take it if they want, but it's their rocket," Army Sgt. Mike
Barker said with a shrug. "It's dangerous for everybody, on the base and
in the village, but we can't take their rocket just because we think it's
a good idea."</LD>
<TE>   The local Northern Alliance commander, Khawani, soon appeared,
overruled the elder and asked the Americans to dispose of the rocket.
After deciding that it was safe because it didn't have a detonator,
Barker and two of his counterparts loaded the rocket into their Humvee
and headed down the road.</TE>
<TE>   Two minutes later, they spotted an unfired air-to-air missile lying in
the dirt.</TE>
<TE>   For the soldiers of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal, or EOD, team
here, it was just another day, another artillery shell, another cluster
bomb, some missiles, some mines and the rocket.</TE>
<TE>   The American team is one of several such units in Afghanistan, units
from coalition countries that, like the U.S., are trying to make the
nation a bit safer even as they continue to fight Taliban and Al Qaeda
forces.</TE>
<TE>   Disposing of such hazards falls to a unique group of soldiers, every
one of whom applied for the job and studied hard, in a field with a more
than 50% failure rate, to get it. In the U.S. and many other nations'
militaries, soldiers cannot be assigned to an ordnance disposal unit.</TE>
<TE>   The dangers they face can be extreme: Whereas most minefields in this
ravaged country are marked, there are no flags pointing out other deadly
detritus of war.</TE>
<TE>   This 744th EOD unit from Ft. Meade, Md., like many of those from other
nations, is not a demining team. Under U.S. military code, de-mining is
left to nongovernmental organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The EOD unit handles mines only if they are in the team's immediate
way. Its job here is to gather everything that could explode, wrap the
munitions in other explosives and blow the whole mess up.</TE>
<TE>   As Afghans, U.S. soldiers, international peacekeepers and aid workers
begin moving into abandoned battlegrounds--some deserted for a decade,
others for a few days as the fighting continues--ordnance teams are being
employed as never before.</TE>
<TE>   British experts are rushing to clear five sites in the capital, Kabul,
before 4,500 peacekeepers arrive by the end of the month. French and
Jordanian troops are helping clear areas around the northern city of
Mazar-i-Sharif.</TE>
<TE>   "This stuff is everywhere, absolutely everywhere," Sgt. 1st Class
Robert Breaux said. "Many of the minefields are marked with wire. This
stuff isn't marked."</TE>
<TE>Bagram Base Is Especially Hazardous</TE>
<TE>   After more than two decades of war, Afghanistan is so littered with
high explosives that about five Afghans die or are maimed each day,
according to the International Committee of the Red Cross.</TE>
<TE>   As the conquering armies have laid mines, then fled, with their
conquerors then laying their own, the minefields have become ubiquitous.
Over the years, however, Afghans have learned to navigate local
minefields with ever more caution, relative though it may be, and the
toll in lives and limbs is believed to be down from a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   But unexploded ordnance--rockets, antiaircraft and recoilless rifle
rounds, and bombs made by the Soviets, U.S., China and Germany--poses a
unique threat, especially now, as people begin to move about again.</TE>
<TE>   The fixed firing positions of yesterday's fighters can be located, but
no one knows where the rounds they launched landed. The same is true with
air-delivered ordnance, which can miss its target by miles. Thousands
upon thousands of munitions were left during retreats, advances and
flanking maneuvers. Munitions stockpiles were rocketed, blasting
detonated and undetonated rounds out for hundreds of yards like so much
shrapnel.</TE>
<TE>   "The bases are not yet safe," British military spokesman Guy
Richardson said Thursday of the Kabul posts. "EOD operations are
continuing."</TE>
<TE>   Bagram, the largest air base in the country, is a study in the perils
and problems facing Afghanistan in terms of unexploded ordnance.</TE>
<TE>   Bagram, about 20 miles north of Kabul, has been a battlefield almost
since it was built in 1976. Between 1999 and the end of 2001, the field
changed hands several times.</TE>
<TE>   Enter the main gate at Bagram, look to your right, and there's a
Soviet rocket pointing right at you. No one has retrieved it yet because
10 yards in one direction is an antitank mine, 10 yards in another is an
antipersonnel mine, with several antiaircraft shells scattered around.</TE>
<TE>   Look to the left and you'll see a hole in a concrete guard shack.
That's where the EOD types pulled out a recoilless rifle round,
essentially an armor-piercing rocket-propelled grenade minus the rocket
engine.</TE>
<TE>   One recent day, long after the Air Force's small encampment had been
swept repeatedly for dangers and the airmen had settled into their tents,
a forklift rolled in. When it rolled back out, up popped a Soviet F-1
hand grenade.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!" a chorus of onlookers shouted when a
lieutenant in a hurry nearly stepped on it.</TE>
<TE>   It takes a special kind of soldier to do the job--which helps explain
the excitement in Staff Sgt. Doug Combs' voice as he stood recently amid
tens of thousands of pounds of munitions at a demolition site in Bagram's
vast desert.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the largest bunch of ordnance I've seen in 16 years on the
job, by a mile!" the 40-year-old exclaimed. "This is the opportunity of a
lifetime."</TE>
<TE>Experts Inspect Unusual Weapons</TE>
<TE>   The best way to destroy any munition is to blow it up in place. Most
of the time here, though, that's not possible. People live too near, or
the blast could destroy a road, or it's stuck like a stake in the side of
a building. So members of the EOD unit bring their finds to this
collection site, among the earthen revetments that used to protect Soviet
MIG-21 fighter jets.</TE>
<TE>   Every few days, they stack some together, mold C-4 plastic explosives
around the bunch, back off about half a mile and blow them apart. One
recent blast took care of a pile of Soviet cluster bombs and the grenade
from the Air Force camp.</TE>
<TE>   But they don't destroy everything.</TE>
<TE>   Scattered about the collection area are hundreds of munitions of
interest to U.S. intelligence and ordnance specialists. Some they've seen
in books. Some they've never seen at all.</TE>
<TE>   There is a row of 57-millimeter helicopter-launched rockets, an
unusual recoilless rifle round with Chinese characters on it, a
collection of 550-pound, Soviet-made photo-flash bombs designed to both
kill the enemy and temporarily blind and stun those who survive.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most intriguing finds is a slew of Soviet air-to-air
missiles. The functional missiles are interesting enough, but what really
piqued the interest of the EOD members were the training
missiles--nonfunctional versions with stripped-away skin specifically
designed as teaching tools.</TE>
<TE>   How and why they were designed this way is right there for any trained
eye to see.</TE>
<TE>   "The intel guys can't wait to get their hands on this stuff," Combs
said. "Thank you, Russians."</TE>
<TE>   Nearby are rows of cluster bombs, small, mostly shiny devices
increasingly criticized by the international community that can be buried
in snow or mud for years and detonated by the touch of a dog's nose or a
child's hand.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it was one of these, or maybe a small, buried mine, that took
the foot of a British soldier a few weeks ago, and the foot of a member
of the 744th a few days later.</TE>
<TE>   Some in the village where they found the rocket believe that it was a
mine or a cluster bomb that killed a 4-year-old girl named Ashka about a
month ago. Others say it was a rocket, just like the one Khawani, the
commander, turned over to the EOD unit to destroy.</TE>
<TE>   "I fought the Taliban six years," Khawani said. "I shot five rockets
like this one at them at the last battle."</TE>

<HD>Hockey Killing to Put Boys on Stand</HD>
<DH>Crime: Children are expected to testify at the Massachusetts trial
of a father charged with beating a coach to death at his son's game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
</DL>
<LD>As two passionate sports fathers engaged in a fatal fistfight at a
hockey rink 18 months ago, children were watching--and at least one was
crying, the rink manager testified Friday in the nation's first trial
involving lethal sports rage at a youth athletic event.</LD>
<LD>   The police officer who rushed to the Burbank Ice Arena said Thomas
Junta was standing alone outside, his shirt torn and his face scratched.
Inside the rink July 5, 2000, police Sgt. James Cormier said he found
Michael Costin lying bloody and motionless, with young skaters in hockey
attire surrounding him.</LD>
<LD>   "To tell you the truth," the prosecution's lead witness said here
Friday, "my first instinct was to get the children away from the scene.
It was pretty dramatic."</LD>
<TE>   Junta, a 275-pound truck driver, faces a maximum sentence of 20 years
in prison if convicted of manslaughter. He is accused of overpowering the
156-pound Costin and pounding his head on the floor until he lost
consciousness. Junta is expected to testify in a trial that the judge
hopes to send to the jury next week.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend Costin was killed by a father crazed with anger
over what he saw as mistreatment of his young son. Defense lawyers say
Junta acted in self-defense after a verbal exchange grew violent.</TE>
<TE>   Children's advocates say the case demonstrates how parents involved in
youth sports can go over the deep end. The use of children as witnesses
in a case like this, they said, is troubling and potentially damaging.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven youngsters who were present when Costin was killed are
scheduled to testify next week.</TE>
<TE>   Among the prospective young witnesses are three sons of Costin, the
unofficial coach at the fateful pickup hockey game 18 months ago. Junta's
son Quinlan, who also skated that day in what attorneys called "stick
practice," is expected to be a key witness for the defense.</TE>
<TE>   All the boys were 8 to 10 years old when Costin and Junta first
exchanged words, then blows.</TE>
<TE>   The scene "must have been horrifying" for the young skaters, said
Harvard Medical School psychiatrist Alvin Poussaint. "It must have just
filled them with total disbelief and horror."</TE>
<TE>   Summoning these children as witnesses is risky, Poussaint said,
"because it's a you-said-I-said, you-saw-I-saw situation." As they take
the stand next week, the children may feel enormous pressure, he
predicted, in part from a sense of loyalty to one father or the other.</TE>
<TE>   But USC law professor Thomas D. Lyon, an expert on child witnesses,
said the children may benefit from taking the stand.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to be able to tell their side of the story," he said. "They
want justice to be done."</TE>
<TE>   In opening arguments late Thursday, prosecuting attorney Sheila
Calkins argued that Junta, 43, became enraged when his son ended up at
the bottom of a pile of brawling boys on the ice. When Junta bolted down
from the stands to challenge Costin, Calkins said the coach called out
from the ice, "That's hockey."</TE>
<TE>   Junta, she said, responded, "That's not hockey."</TE>
<TE>   Junta left the rink but returned moments later, pushing past a rink
manager to confront Costin, a 40-year-old carpenter.</TE>
<TE>   Defense counsel Thomas Orlandi Jr. depicted Junta as "a good family
man" who acted in self-defense when Costin lunged at him as the two
argued.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with police soon after the incident, Junta described
the exchange as "a stupid guy thing."</TE>
<TE>   Friday, the trial unfolded with an emphasis on medical evidence. A
firefighter who rushed to the rink as an emergency medical technician
testified that Costin never breathed on his own despite repeated attempts
to revive him.</TE>
<TE>   While Junta stared at the witness table, the physician who conducted
Costin's autopsy described the lethal injuries. Costin received severe
blows to the left side of his head, said Dr. Stanton Kessler, causing
brain damage and damaging the victim's vertebral artery, "one of the most
protected areas in the body."</TE>
<TE>   Kessler's description of wounds behind Costin's left ear was so
explicit that many jurors were seen rubbing that area of their own heads.</TE>
<TE>   Costin was fresh off the rink and still in his pads and ice skates but
not wearing a helmet at the time of the altercation, according to
prosecutors. Defense lawyers say Costin tried to jab Junta with his
skates and that Junta's face and neck were scratched when Costin ripped a
gold chain off their client's neck.</TE>
<TE>   With 35 million to 40 million American children involved in organized
athletic competition, according to the National Alliance for Youth
Sports, the case has drawn attention as a symbol of a generation of
parents who are overly invested in their children's sports lives.
Alliance President Fred Engh said Friday that violence among parents at
youth sporting events is on the rise.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, what I have to say is that it's a growing trend," Engh
said. "We have incident after incident--not fatal, but violence that
might have ended in death."</TE>
<TE>   Engh called the death of Michael Costin "the billboard across America
to tell parents that this can happen."</TE>
<TE>   Former National Basketball Assn. player Bob Bigelow, now a youth
sports activist and author of a book called "Just Let the Kids Play,"
said the obsession of many parents over their children's athletics has
grown to a "more-more-more, younger-younger-younger,
better-better-better" syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   "Parents are worried that little Justin is not going to get as many
games as little Jeremy," Bigelow said Friday. He called hockey parents
"the most virulent of the species. They don't look at it anymore as
hockey games. They look at it as an investment in a child's future.
That's the problem, right there."</TE>

<HD>Prosecutor to Probe Abuses of 'Dirty War'</HD>
<DH>Mexico: Government appoints a lawyer to investigate the
disappearances of hundreds of leftist rebels in 1970s and early '80s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>The Mexican government Friday appointed a special prosecutor to
investigate the disappearances of hundreds of leftist rebels in the 1970s
and early 1980s, another step toward realizing President Vicente Fox's
vow to punish those who committed human rights abuses.</LD>
<LD>   The appointment of Ignacio Carrillo Prieto, a lawyer and academic who
lost a cousin in the so-called dirty war, comes nearly six weeks after
the National Human Rights Commission issued a 2,846-page report on the
disappearances.</LD>
<LD>   A decade in the making, the document marked the first official
acknowledgment that army and police agents had methodically kidnapped,
tortured and killed at least 275 people as they quashed an array of
guerrilla movements.</LD>
<TE>   When the report was released in November, Fox ordered his attorney
general and defense minister to cooperate fully with the probe.</TE>
<TE>   He also pledged to open security files compiled by the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, whose 71-year rule ended with Fox's 2000
election, and to appoint a five-member civilian commission to investigate
rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   But skepticism reigned among human rights activists Friday, many of
whom scrambled to find out more about Carrillo Prieto.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not encouraging," said Sergio Aguayo, a prominent human
rights defender who has pressed the government to uncover the truth about
the disappearances. "He is not known within the human rights community in
Mexico."</TE>
<TE>Rights Group Leader Is Skeptical About Process</TE>
<TE>   Oscar Gonzalez, president of the Mexican Academy of Human Rights, said
he was disappointed that the government did not first appoint the
investigative commission, which could have helped select the prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a highly political matter, and that's why we wanted a process
that was fully transparent," Gonzalez said. "We wish [Carrillo Prieto]
all the best for such a difficult task; however, we are skeptical about
the outcome. If he starts by going after people at the very bottom, the
little soldiers instead of the top leaders like presidents, that will be
a bad sign."</TE>
<TE>   The appointment caps a year of speculation about what form the quest
for justice would take. Fox rejected suggestions to form a truth
commission like those of Argentina, Chile, and South Africa, saying that
Mexico's Constitution did not permit such entities and that a special
prosecutor would better ensure justice.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor will have the power to subpoena documents and
interrogate witnesses, and Fox has promised a budget and staff big enough
to carry out what promises to be a daunting and politically delicate
task. But the administration offered no details about those resources
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Carrillo Prieto, a member of the International Assn. of Penal Law and
the Mexican Academy of Penal Sciences, has served as the Interior
Ministry's director of youth treatment and crime prevention. The author
of many books on legal rights, including some dealing with torture and
eavesdropping, he also holds a doctorate in law and works at the National
Autonomous University in Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. Rafael Macedo de la Concha, a general on leave from the
military who will oversee the new prosecutor, said that Carrillo Prieto
had been chosen from a field of 40 candidates.</TE>
<TE>Appointee Vows to 'Heal the Wounds'</TE>
<TE>   In a brief appearance Friday, the new prosecutor vowed "to heal the
wounds and thus help lay the ground for new covenants of justice and
public safety."</TE>
<TE>   Carrillo Prieto also has a personal connection to past atrocities: He
said his cousin, Deni Prieto, was killed in 1974 after she joined a group
of young insurgents. Her body was never recovered.</TE>
<TE>   "We know the grief because we have shared it," Carrillo Prieto said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the missing were many hard-line Communist guerrillas who
attacked army and police patrols and kidnapped people for ransom. In
addition to the 275 confirmed cases cited in the November report,
investigators found 97 other cases in which there were indications of
forced disappearances but no proof.</TE>
<TE>   The report did not identify officials suspected of rights abuses, but
the human rights panel's president, Jose Luis Soberanes, said
investigators had identified 74 such "public servants" from 37 government
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question [Carrillo Prieto] has solid academic credentials,
but this job represents a huge challenge for somebody who doesn't have
prosecutorial experience or specific human rights background," said Jose
Miguel Vivanco, executive director for the Americas at Human Rights
Watch. "However, I think it's important to give him the benefit of the
doubt. We have to give this process a chance."</TE>

<HD>Israel Seizes Arms Allegedly Being Shipped to Palestinians</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Army links the crew and vessel to Arafat's government,
which denies knowledge of smuggling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Breaking what it described as a major smuggling operation, the
Israeli military said Friday that it had intercepted a ship in the Red
Sea carrying 50 tons of advanced weaponry destined for the Palestinian
Authority.</LD>
<LD>   The ship was owned by the Palestinian Authority, and its captain and
several members of the crew were officers in the Palestinian naval police
force, Israeli military officials said. Had the arsenal reached the
Palestinians, it would have substantially increased Palestinian
firepower.</LD>
<LD>   Israel announced the seizure in a news conference in Tel Aviv as U.S.
Middle East envoy Gen. Anthony C. Zinni was meeting with Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat at his headquarters in the West Bank
city of Ramallah.</LD>
<TE>   Spokesmen for Arafat denied any knowledge of the arms shipment, the
largest of several that Israel claims to have intercepted or detected in
the last 15 months of Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli army chief of staff, said the cache
included Katyusha rockets with a 12-mile range, 120-millimeter mortars,
antiaircraft missiles, mines, armor-piercing Sagger antitank missiles and
sniper rifles.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the weapons apparently came from Iran and were contained in 83
crates packed onto the vessel in a watertight container that could be
submerged for a long period for later retrieval, Israeli officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Mofaz said that had the cache reached the Palestinians, "it could have
dramatically raised the threat faced by Israeli civilians and soldiers
and significantly widened the scale of terrorist attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Antitank and antiaircraft weapons, especially, could reduce the
enormous advantage that Israeli gunships and armor have over Palestinians
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Mofaz noted that the smuggling attempt violated interim peace deals
that set limits on the type and number of weapons in the Palestinian
Authority arsenal. Most of the weapons on the ship are forbidden to the
Palestinians under the existing agreements.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Arafat
should take immediate steps to prevent future attempts to bring weapons
into the territories.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher told a daily briefing that Zinni brought up the Israeli
allegation at a meeting with Arafat on Friday. Zinni "expressed our
strong condemnation of any attempts to escalate the conflict in the
region by militant groups or others," Boucher said.</TE>
<TE>   Under cover of darkness early Thursday, naval commandos backed by
aircraft boarded the Karine-A ship about 300 miles from Israeli shores in
international waters of the Red Sea. The vessel was headed north, but
Israeli authorities didn't reveal its port of departure or likely
destination.</TE>
<TE>   The crew didn't resist and fired no shots, Mofaz said. No casualties
were reported.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat spokesman Nabil abu Rudaineh, following the meeting with Zinni,
said the Palestinian Authority had "absolutely nothing to do with, nor
knowledge of" the arms shipment. Abu Rudaineh accused Israel of a
"propaganda ploy" aimed at undermining Zinni's mission, which is to
broker a lasting cease-fire and move Israelis and Palestinians toward
broader peace talks.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Israel's allegations are undoubtedly embarrassing to Arafat,
coming at a time he is trying to convince Zinni and the world that he is
serious about cracking down on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Israel hopes to use the smuggling operation to further discredit
Arafat and the Palestinian Authority and bolster its argument that the
Palestinians cannot be trusted.</TE>
<TE>   "The link between the Palestinian Authority and the smuggling
operation is unequivocal, clear and undeniable," Mofaz said. The
intercept, he said, is proof that the Palestinian Authority is "infected
by terrorism from head to toe."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed-Rabbo joined in denying
Israel's charges. "We insist that the Palestinian Authority has nothing
to do with this ship," he said. "These allegations are false."</TE>
<TE>   Last May in the Mediterranean, Israel captured what it said was a
fishing vessel packed with hundreds of weapons headed for the
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. A radical group claimed responsibility
for that smuggling attempt.</TE>
<TE>   The shipment captured Thursday dwarfs the earlier one, Israeli
military officials said. It also may prove to be the first time that the
Palestinian Authority is directly linked to a large smuggling scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Friday's announcement, Zinni emerged from his meeting with
Arafat and said he was optimistic that, in contrast to his stay here in
December, "conditions are right" for progress to be made in easing
tensions. A security meeting involving the Americans, Israelis and
Palestinians was likely to take place Sunday, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Argentina Poised to Devalue Currency</HD>
<DH>Economics: New president declines to say how far peso, which has
been pegged to the dollar, might fall. Rescue plan is sent to Congress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>In his first public address since taking office two days earlier,
Argentine President Eduardo Duhalde acknowledged Friday that the nation
will have to devalue its currency, abandoning the peso's 10-year parity
with the U.S. dollar.</LD>
<LD>   But he declined to say how much value the peso might lose or disclose
details of a sweeping economic "salvation" plan he has sent to Congress
for debate and approval over the weekend. A tentative unveiling of the
plan to the public Friday was postponed until today at the earliest.</LD>
<LD>   "We are broke. We are bankrupt," Duhalde told a group of business
leaders Friday. "Why have we come to this? Some natural circumstance? Is
Argentina under a spell? No. We are the ones--Argentine leaders--who have
brought this country to these circumstances that afflict us."</LD>
<TE>Plenty of Speculation</TE>
<TE>   Local news reports were filled with speculation on details of the
rescue package, saying it may include parallel currencies for domestic
consumption and trade, steep government spending cuts and the conversion
of all dollar-denominated debts up to $100,000 to peso obligations, a way
of easing the shock of a devaluation in an economy where dollar
obligations dominate.</TE>
<TE>   But Duhalde refused to confirm anything in his talk Friday. To do so
would put undue pressure on Congress, he said, which first has to pass a
new law junking the peso's one-to-one "convertibility" to the dollar
before a new monetary regime can replace it.</TE>
<TE>   "It is now a given that the devaluation will happen in the country,"
Duhalde said.</TE>
<TE>   Economists predict that the peso will marked down to between 1.30 to
1.50 to the dollar and be allowed to devalue further over time in a
so-called crawling peg before floating freely once Argentina's economy
stabilizes.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde, a populist former vice president and provincial governor and
a longtime stalwart of Argentina's left-leaning Peronist party, also
denied that he plans to scrap free-market reforms that have changed the
face of Argentina's economy during the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is thinking of the old protectionism but in taking care and
protecting what is ours," the 60-year-old chief executive said. He
reiterated that he is a "transition president" devoted to Argentina's
economic recovery and will not run for office when the term expires in
December 2003.</TE>
<TE>   But Duhalde signaled that his program will be a departure from the
economics of the past decade, which emphasized opening doors to foreign
investment and the privatization of state-owned companies and utilities.</TE>
<TE>   "They have made us think in Argentina that in this new economic order
there is only one model possible," he said. "That's an absolute fallacy."</TE>
<TE>Push for Domestic Goods</TE>
<TE>   Argentina's deepening crisis is marked by a recession in its fourth
year and 18% unemployment. Civil unrest forced the resignation of
President Fernando de la Rua on Dec. 20, and he was followed in quick
succession by three interim leaders. Duhalde was elected interim
president by an emergency session of the legislature Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   After two years in which hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost
and the Argentine middle class has been "liquidated," Duhalde called on
the people to "help in this extraordinary task of recovering jobs for
Argentines." He urged citizens to buy domestic goods instead of imports.</TE>
<TE>   "We must awake the national conscience," Duhalde said.</TE>
<TE>   But a devaluation and spending cuts will almost certainly result in a
deeper recession and greater job losses in the short term, economists
fear, as a resulting wave of bankruptcies and reduced consumption cause
business activity to shrink even further. Changing debts from
dollar-based to peso-based could also cause a crisis in the banking
system.</TE>

<HD>Chance for Indian, Pakistani Leaders to Meet Is Scuttled</HD>
<DH>South Asia: Musharraf's late arrival at regional summit is a
diplomatic setback as fighting continues along the two countries' border.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KATMANDU, Nepal
</DL>
<LD>A longshot opportunity to get the leaders of India and Pakistan
talking again appeared to slip away Friday after the opening of a
regional summit here was postponed because Pakistani President Gen.
Pervez Musharraf arrived late.</LD>
<LD>   The delay in the summit's start until today meant that a private
retreat, where Musharraf and Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee
were supposed to mingle with five other leaders at a Himalayan resort,
would likely be canceled, the Nepalese hosts said.</LD>
<LD>   Observers had viewed the retreat as a prime opportunity for a
face-to-face meeting about the tensions that have been mounting since a
Dec. 13 terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament.</LD>
<TE>   Musharraf and Vajpayee attended a dinner with other South Asian
leaders Friday night, and the two men are staying at the same hotel. But
India insists that the regional summit is not the place for such talks,
despite pressure from the United States and other foreign governments.</TE>
<TE>   Fog was the official reason for Musharraf's failure to arrive in time
for the summit's scheduled opening Friday afternoon. He flew in from
China, where he stopped to speak with leaders of Pakistan's biggest ally
in the region.</TE>
<TE>   As India's Foreign Ministry repeated that Musharraf had to do more to
stop "cross-border terrorism," Pakistani police Friday announced the
detention about 130 extremists in overnight raids, which authorities said
would continue.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the people picked up were said to be suspects in domestic
militancy. But some detainees were reportedly members of Jaish-e-Mohammed
and Lashkar-e-Taiba, the two Pakistan-based groups that India says were
behind the assault on Parliament in which 14 people died, including the
five gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan has put the leaders of the two groups under house arrest, but
so far they are accused only of making inflammatory speeches.</TE>
<TE>   The Indian government insists that isn't strong enough action. It has
demanded that Pakistan hand over 20 alleged terrorists and criminals,
including Jaish-e-Mohammed leader Maulana Masood Azhar. He fled to
Pakistan after his release from an Indian jail in a deal to free
passengers of an Indian Airlines flight hijacked to Kandahar,
Afghanistan, in December 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's diplomatic setback in Nepal came amid continued fighting
between India and Pakistan along their border, and across the cease-fire
line that divides Kashmir, the mountainous region that both countries
claim.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf's chief spokesman, Maj. Gen. Rashid Qureshi, told reporters
here Friday that the Pakistani president, who took power in a bloodless
1999 coup, wants to talk to Vajpayee.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that the Indian government needs to pull back," Qureshi said.
"If India violates Pakistan's land, air or sea frontier, Pakistan will
respond with all its might."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether Chinese leaders had promised to support Pakistan if the
crisis deepens, Qureshi replied that China "has said it will support
Pakistan in all eventualities."</TE>
<TE>   Vajpayee has held bilateral talks with every leader present at the
summit in Katmandu, Nepal's capital, except Musharraf, leaving the
impression that he was trying to freeze out the Pakistani president.</TE>
<TE>   With no breakthrough expected here, the diplomatic focus is shifting
to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who plans to meet Musharraf and
Vajpayee this weekend during separate stops on a South Asian tour.</TE>
<TE>   Although Blair is not bringing a specific peace initiative, he is
expected to urge both leaders to take steps to ease the tension and start
talking again.</TE>
<TE>   The visit to India will be the first in eight years by a British prime
minister. India was a British colony until 1947, when the subcontinent
was granted independence and Pakistan was created to answer Muslim
demands for a separate state.</TE>
<TE>   More than 140 million Muslims live in India, which has about as many
Muslim citizens as Pakistan. The two countries have fought three wars
since independence, two of them over Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   The Himalayan region remains the biggest irritant between them, and
many Indians are still bitter about Britain's role in breaking up the
country, so Blair must be careful not to push too hard in his discussions
with Vajpayee.</TE>
<TE>   The bloody 1947 partition, which forced hundreds of thousands of
refugees to flee in both directions across the new border, left Kashmir
in dispute. New Delhi says the former princely state's ruler signed over
control of the whole territory to India, while Pakistan insists that
Kashmiris should be allowed to choose their allegiance in a referendum
promised by the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   With war hanging in the balance, both India and Pakistan are trying to
tilt the diplomatic balance permanently in their favor, and that
complicates efforts to calm the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   New Delhi has long insisted that Kashmir is an internal matter that
must be solved in bilateral negotiations with Islamabad, while successive
Pakistani governments have asked for third-party mediation to resolve the
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Blair and Vajpayee plan to sign a joint declaration after their
scheduled meeting in New Delhi on Sunday, an Indian official said without
giving details. Blair then is to fly to Islamabad, the Pakistani capital,
to meet with Musharraf.</TE>

<HD>Relaxed Bush Unveils New Image in Austin</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AUSTIN, Texas
</DL>
<LD>Returning to his political roots, an expansive President Bush felt
so nostalgic Friday that he was on the verge of unleashing an off-color
story or two. But he caught himself.</LD>
<LD>   Fondly recalling his six years as Texas governor, during which he met
weekly with the state's top two Democrats, Bush told an adoring crowd at
the Capitol here: "I can't help but chuckle about our breakfasts that we
used to have in this building. . . . I'd like to share some of the
stories with the people watching on C-SPAN. But unfortunately, I can't
repeat them in mixed company."</LD>
<LD>   Bush spoke in the Capitol's majestic rotunda, as the state's governing
establishment turned out for the unveiling of his official portrait as
Texas' 46th governor.</LD>
<TE>   As he sat onstage, waiting to speak, the president singled out
numerous people in the crowd, giving them his trademark wave with
fluttering fingers.</TE>
<TE>   Accompanied by First Lady Laura Bush and surrounded by longtime
financial supporters, loyal staffers and political allies, including
Democratic Texas House Speaker James E. "Pete" Laney, Bush was unusually
relaxed and even jocular. He rambled through 10 minutes of remarks
enlivened by one quip after another, interrupted by one wistful
remembrance of the bipartisanship over which he presided.</TE>
<TE>   Lest anyone missed his point--the contrast between Austin and
Washington--the president spelled it out.</TE>
<TE>   "We came in this building with one desire: to do what's right for
Texas. We've got political labels around our name--no question about it.
But we made up our mind to try to figure out what was best for our state
and to work together," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   He then suggested that he took that same "can-do spirit" to
Washington--only to be disappointed, at least for now.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes Washington needs to figure out that politics isn't what's
most important; the people are what's most important," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush did not mention any particular legislation or political nemesis,
saving those for a reinvigorated campaign for his economic stimulus bill
that he intends to launch today at a town hall meeting in Ontario,
Calif., followed by stops in Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing a crowd of about 150 people after his portrait was
unveiled, Bush said he intends to remind members of Congress after
returning to Washington on Monday that "results are what matters, not
rhetoric."</TE>
<TE>   He also said he intends to "remind people that our country, just like
our state, is much bigger than the political process. Those are the
lessons I learned here in this state capital."</TE>
<TE>   Bush neglected to mention, though, that the much-vaunted
bipartisanship in the Texas Legislature has all but vanished amid
intrigue and recrimination in the aftermath of political redistricting.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, Friday's event here was less about politics than
about Bush, the former governor.</TE>
<TE>   Republican Gov. Rick Perry, who as lieutenant governor took the top
job when Bush moved to the White House, alluded to his predecessor's role
as war commander and said, "Now more than ever, the people of the United
States are seeing what kind of man George Bush is."</TE>
<TE>   Laura Bush introduced the president as "my favorite Texan."</TE>
<TE>   The president thanked the audience members for "taking time out of
your day to come and witness my hanging."</TE>
<TE>   The portrait, by Texas artist Scott Gentling, who is known for his
depictions of state birds, shows Bush perched, perhaps on the edge of a
desk, with his hands folded on his lap.</TE>
<TE>   "Not bad," Bush told Perry in an aside after the painting was
uncovered.</TE>
<TE>   "Pretty tough old bird here to paint, wasn't I?" Bush said jokingly to
Gentling. "I know it was a challenge on your part, but it looks like you
did me justice."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's portrait will hang in the rotunda next to that of his
predecessor, Democrat Ann Richards, who frequently ridiculed the
president's father when the elder Bush served in the White House. The
younger Bush then defeated Richards in 1994 to become governor.</TE>

<HD>Supreme Court to Review Tow Truck Regulation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court said Friday it will consider restoring the power
of cities and counties to regulate tow truck drivers to prevent them from
charging exorbitant rates or snatching illegally parked cars.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of major cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, St.
Louis and Philadelphia, have adopted such laws over the last 30 years.
Tow truck operators are required to obtain city permits and follow basic
rules.</LD>
<LD>   Police were eager to stop independent towers from racing through the
streets to be first at the scene of a disabled vehicle. Motorists were
also interested in having tows that were safe and charges that were
reasonable.</LD>
<TE>   But the tow truck operators have successfully challenged many of these
municipal ordinances, saying they violate the federal laws that
exclusively regulate trucks and freight carriers. Congress intended to
shield these interstate trucks from local rules and regulations, and a
surprising number of courts have said the federal motor carrier laws
trump the municipal ordinances governing tow trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals knocked down
Santa Ana's ordinance regulating tow trucks. Last June, another U.S.
court of appeals invalidated the towing ordinance in Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   But several cities appealed, and the Supreme Court agreed Friday to
review the Columbus case.</TE>
<TE>   The high court will hear arguments in City of Columbus vs. Ours Garage
and Wrecker Service, 01-419, in April and issue a ruling by late June.</TE>
<TE>   After meeting in their first conference since the holiday break, the
justices announced they would hear seven other cases as well. Several of
them are appeals by the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   In a Florida case, the court will decide whether police officers can
question passengers on interstate buses and ask them about searching
their bags for drugs. Last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta
ruled that this police conduct amounted to an "unreasonable seizure"
because the passengers were not free to walk away.</TE>
<TE>   On streets and sidewalks, pedestrians are free to ignore police
officers who want to search them, so long as there is no evidence they
have done anything wrong.</TE>
<TE>   But the situation is different on buses, the appeals court said. If
officers make "a show of authority," passengers assume they must
cooperate and allow their bags to be examined.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 4, 1999, two Tallahassee police officers boarded a bus and
walked down the aisle. They showed their badges and told passengers they
were looking for drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you have any bags on the bus?" one officer asked Christopher
Drayton. He pointed to a green bag overhead and gave his permission to
have it searched.</TE>
<TE>   "Mind if I check you?" the officer continued. When Drayton lifted his
hands, the officer patted his thighs and felt several hard bags. They
were full of cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   Drayton and another man were charged with federal drug violations, but
the appeals court threw out the evidence on the grounds that the men were
illegally searched.</TE>
<TE>   In his appeal in U.S. vs. Drayton, 01-631, Solicitor General Theodore
B. Olson urged the high court to uphold the legality of such "consensual
interactions between police officers and citizens," saying they are
crucial to "the national effort to combat the flow of illegal narcotics
and weapons."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the court will take up a drug case from the Mexican
border area to decide whether a criminal defendant has a right to know
certain information before pleading guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1963, the law has required prosecutors to tell defendants who
are on trial about key information that might show they are innocent.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, on a 2-1 vote, said
the same rule applies to people who are considering whether to plead
guilty. The decision came in the case of Angela Ruiz, who drove across
the border from Mexico with 66 pounds of marijuana in her car.</TE>
<TE>   In his appeal in U.S. vs. Ruiz, 01-595, Olson said the 9th Circuit's
disclosure rule would force "a radical change" in current practices and
might "endanger government witnesses" by revealing details about drug
investigations.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>Weeping with joy, an aspiring author was released from jail Friday
after spending more than five months behind bars for refusing to hand
over notes about a society murder.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm just very grateful to be free," Vanessa Leggett said with her
husband, Doak, at her side. "Downtown Houston never looked so good. I
feel good--I was able to maintain my journalistic integrity so far."</LD>
<LD>   Leggett, 33, was freed after 168 days in jail because the federal
grand jury that demanded her research ended its term Friday, said her
attorney, Mike DeGeurin.</LD>
<TE>   However, federal prosecutors have indicated they will again ask
Leggett for her research. Another grand jury could be convened as early
as next week and she could be subpoenaed to appear.</TE>
<TE>   Leggett said she would be more than willing to go back to jail.</TE>
<TE>   "If that's what it takes, that's what it takes," she said. "This is
not so much about me; it's about the public's right to a free and
independent press."</TE>
<TE>   Kesha Handy, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office, declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Leggett is working on a book about the 1997 murder of Doris Angleton
in Houston. Authorities suspect her husband, Robert Angleton, hired his
brother to kill his wife. Robert Angleton was acquitted in 1998 but
federal agents are now investigating him. Roger Angleton killed himself
in jail, leaving a note exonerating his brother. Leggett had interviewed
him.</TE>
<TE>   Leggett was jailed on contempt charges July 20 after refusing to
answer the grand jury's questions about confidential sources and not
turning over copies of her notes.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors contend Leggett is not a journalist and does not
fall under the 1st Amendment's protection of the press. Leggett, who has
taught English and criminal justice at the University of Houston, has
never published a book or news article.</TE>

<DL>HELENA, Mont.
</DL>
<LD>Gov. Judy Martz said Friday that she washed the clothes her top
aide was wearing hours after he was involved in a drunken-driving crash
that killed the Montana House majority leader.</LD>
<LD>   Martz said it was a motherly reaction to the bloody and dirty items
and not an attempt to destroy evidence. She had brought the aide to her
residence after he was released from the hospital.</LD>
<LD>   She said she did not realize she had done something wrong until
authorities came to collect the clothing of Shane Hedges two days after
the Aug. 15 accident. The crash killed Paul Sliter, 32, who was a
passenger in the vehicle and Hedges' best friend.</LD>
<TE>   "I was never told not to do anything with them," Martz said of the
shirt and pants. "A mother does that kind of stuff. If something's dirty
or got blood on it, you try to get it off and you clean it up."</TE>
<TE>   Martz added: "If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't have. But the
mother in me did it."</TE>
<TE>   Tests showed Hedges was legally drunk at the time of the accident, and
he resigned as Martz's policy director. He pleaded guilty to negligent
homicide and is serving at least a six-month sentence at a halfway house.</TE>
<TE>   After the crash, Martz went to the hospital where Hedges was taken to
be examined. When he was released about five hours later, she took him to
the governor's residence, where he stayed for a few days.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis and Clark County Atty. Leo Gallagher said no charges were filed
over the clothes washing because a Highway Patrol investigator initially
turned down an offer to take the items as evidence. Two days passed
before the patrol requested the clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "I can understand that someone given that set of facts would believe
they have no evidentiary value," he said. "Therefore, dealing with those
clothes as you would with any other set of dirty clothes does not seem to
me to be a criminal offense."</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen news organizations have sued to obtain access to
investigative records of the crash.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Rockville woman who allegedly enticed lovers to kill two husbands
and a boyfriend and kept witnesses quiet with threats of voodoo was
charged with murder, a prosecutor said.</LD>
<LD>   Josephine Gray enlisted the men to commit murder in 1974, 1990 and
1996, court documents said.</LD>
<LD>   Gray was charged with first-degree murder in the first two deaths,
said Montgomery County State's Atty. Douglas Gansler.</LD>
<TE>   Previous charges had been dropped against Gray, 55, after key
witnesses disappeared; authorities accuse her of incorporating voodoo in
her threats.</TE>
<TE>   Gray, who allegedly collected thousands of dollars in life insurance
payments after the deaths, has pleaded not guilty.</TE>

<LD>The snowstorm that brought much of the South to a standstill moved
offshore, but cold air in its wake threatened to refreeze the slush and
extend the misery.</LD>
<LD>   Sunny skies began melting the remnants of the two-day storm that
dumped up to 16 inches of snow in parts of Virginia, North Carolina,
South Carolina and Georgia. The icy blast was blamed for at least 10
traffic deaths.</LD>
<LD>   But frigid overnight temperatures were expected to freeze the runoff,
and rain mixed with light snow was expected in parts of the Carolinas and
Virginia by Sunday. Frost was expected as far south as Miami.</LD>

<HD>Fire Guts Ventura Seniors Complex</HD>
<DH>Emergency: Officials say arson may have been the cause of an
estimated $3 million in damage. The apartments were to open in March.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 76-unit senior apartment complex that was expected to open in
Ventura in March was destroyed by a fast-moving fire early Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators from the Ventura city and county fire departments said
the cause of the fire was under investigation, but that it may have been
arson.</LD>
<LD>   "We're considering it suspicious because the building was under
construction," said Brian Clark, a deputy fire marshal for the Ventura
Fire Department. "It was a cool night, and there were no wires down and
it was a fast-moving fire."</LD>
<TE>   Clark said the blaze began about 3:50 a.m. and quickly engulfed the
three-acre complex just off Cypress Point Lane, near the county
Government Center. He said the building was about 75% complete and
encompassed more than 54,000 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   The estimated loss was nearly $3 million, said Clark, who said that 60
firefighters from Ventura and Oxnard as well as Ventura County battled
the blaze. There were no injuries, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters from the Los Angeles Fire Department were called to join
the investigation Friday, using dogs trained in detecting flammable
substances. Investigators were concentrating on a front section of the
complex closest to a neighboring apartment building.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses living in that building said the complex, which was loaded
down with stacks of wood pallets, drywall and other combustible
construction materials, crackled loudly and exploded.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze spread so fast, according to some witnesses, that many who
were jolted from their beds barely smelled smoke before seeing giant
orange flames leaping into the air. Firefighters responding from Oxnard
said flames were visible before they got to the Ventura city limits.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it was a gun battle because it all sounded like
machine-gun fire," said Laurie Lemson, who lives in an apartment complex
separated from the fire by a 6-foot-high brick wall. "People were rushing
out of here with their animals. It was like nothing I have ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   Several embers floated onto Lemson's complex and ignited small fires
on the shake roof, but they were quickly doused by firefighters.
Officials began evacuating residents of the apartment building but
stopped when the small fires were put out, Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   Four hours after the fire started, most of the flames were out, but
firefighters on extended ladders continued to pour water on the charred
structure.</TE>
<TE>   Stunned workers and officials from the Lancaster-based construction
company heading up the project talked with firefighters as insurance
adjusters and agents waited nearby.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sad thing," Oxnard electrician Richard Marquez said. "It's
hard for me, especially with bills to pay and a kid on the way."</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the construction company, Atkinson &amp; Associates, said
that at least 45 people have been working at the site everyday since work
began last summer.</TE>
<TE>   The complex is operated by Sunrise Assisted Living, a McLean, Va.,
company that has built about 190 such facilities in the United States and
abroad, said Dwight Spargur, executive director of the Ventura complex.</TE>
<TE>   The units were to rent for $1,700 to $3,900 per month. The facility
would include full medical care.</TE>
<TE>   Spargur said the senior living complex was set to open March 15. An
open house was scheduled for the facility this weekend, with tours of the
completed sections. As of Friday, nine units had been rented, Spargur
said.</TE>
<TE>   Six people had been hired to work at the facility, and Spargur had
expected another 40 to be hired by the opening.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a number of applications on file, but it's all on hold until
we know the next step, and right now it's too early to tell," Spargur
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said people that have signed up to rent apartments in the senior
complex will be placed in similar facilities in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   The burned building was part of a six-acre development under
construction next to the Vons supermarket at the intersection of Victoria
Avenue and Telephone Road.</TE>
<TE>   The senior complex was the first phase of the development, which will
eventually include several restaurants and a day-care center, said Ben
Lingo, a Westlake resident and one of the investors in the property.</TE>

<HD>Ventura Man Receives 55 Years to Life for Strangling Woman</HD>
<DH>Courts: Tommy Welch blames his childhood, but judge expands term
under three-strikes law.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A mentally disturbed Ventura man who strangled his girlfriend after
she tried to leave him was sentenced Friday to 55 years to life in
prison.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking in a soft voice, Tommy Welch, 47, apologized for his crime.
Then he blamed his actions on mental illness, an abusive father and an
adolescence spent as a ward of the state.</LD>
<LD>   Welch asked the family of Marsha Rockvam, 45, to try to understand. He
strangled Rockvam in a hotel room in August 1997 after she ended their
five-month relationship.</LD>
<TE>   "I am just truly sorry," Welch said. "I know I'm not right in the
head. That's no excuse for what I did, I guess."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Superior Court Judge James P. Cloninger told Welch that
a troubled childhood explains how he developed into the man he is today:
a two-time felon with a history of mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   "But that doesn't excuse an adult man from what he does," the judge
said.</TE>
<TE>   Welch was convicted of second-degree murder in November 2001. Although
the charge is normally punishable by 15 years to life, Cloninger tripled
the sentence under the state's three-strikes law and added 10 years under
a separate statute.</TE>
<TE>   Welch was convicted in 1978 of kidnapping a man at gunpoint and in
1992 of burglary.</TE>
<TE>   During the sentencing hearing, Rockvam's parents and three adult
children described the anguish they have suffered for the past four
years, first coming to grips with her slaying and then enduring years of
court delays.</TE>
<TE>   After admitting to Rockvam's slaying during a police interview, Welch
was twice sent to a state mental institution because doctors determined
he was not competent to stand trial.</TE>
<TE>   The case came before a jury last year after doctors concluded that
Welch could understand the charges against him.</TE>
<TE>   At one point during the trial, Welch screamed at his lawyers and
refused to go to court, prompting the judge to call a weeklong recess so
a separate jury could rule on Welch's competency. That jury determined
that Welch was competent and the murder trial resumed.</TE>
<TE>   For Rockvam's family, the latest blow came when Welch took the stand
in his own defense and told jurors that he accidentally killed Rockvam
while they were engaged in erotic asphyxiation--being choked during sex.</TE>
<TE>   In a Dec. 13 letter to the judge, Welch admitted that the sex story
was a fabrication.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney James Farley apologized to Rockvam's family, adding
that he first learned the sex story was untrue when he read Welch's
letter.</TE>
<TE>   Colleen Krueger, Rockvam's mother, told the judge that Welch's false
testimony disgusted and hurt her family.</TE>
<TE>   "I can only ask your honor to please, please sentence him to prison
for the maximum time allowed," Krueger said.</TE>

<HD>Student Killed in Crash</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An 18-year-old Moorpark College student was killed early Friday
when he crashed his sport utility vehicle into a tree.</LD>
<LD>   Anton Sokolow-Nikolic, an Oak Park High School graduate and former
standout varsity golfer, died at the scene of the crash, which occurred
shortly after midnight in the unincorporated area of Lake Sherwood,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   "He was well-liked and very involved in school activities," said Dave
Becker, assistant principal at Oak Park High.</LD>
<TE>   "We're a small high school and many, many students have been affected
by his passing."</TE>
<TE>   Sokolow-Nikolic, who lived in Oak Park with his mother and younger
brother, worked part time as a caddy at Sherwood Country Club, where he
carried clubs during the Williams World Challenge in mid-December.</TE>
<TE>   "He was pretty new here but had worked a couple of tournaments and
came out three or four times a week," said Andy Hermes, a co-worker at
the club. "What a shock."</TE>
<TE>   Sokolow-Nikolic's death is the fourth traffic fatality in Ventura
County this year. His death also marks the latest in a string of fatal
crashes in the Thousand Oaks area involving teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   Since July, seven youths have been killed in car crashes in and around
the city.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the families of two 16-year-old Westlake High School
students buried their sons, who were killed in a Dec. 28 crash in
Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   California Highway Patrol Officer Steve Reid, whose agency is handling
the investigation into Sokolow-Nikolic's death, said the cause of the
crash has not been determined.</TE>
<TE>   Reid, however, said there were no skid marks and no evidence in the
vehicle that Sokolow-Nikolic had been drinking.</TE>
<TE>   Officers did not know as of late Friday where the youth had been prior
to the crash.</TE>
<TE>   According to authorities, Sokolow-Nikolic was driving his mother's
Chevrolet Blazer westbound on Potrero Road when he crashed into a large
tree on the north side of the road, just west of Trentwood Drive. The
impact caused a fire.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said someone called to report the fire and firefighters
arrived to find the teen's body in the driver's seat.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of death was asphyxia from the fire and crash injuries, said
Mitch Breese, a senior deputy coroner's investigator.</TE>
<TE>   Results from toxicology tests will be available in several weeks,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Becker, the assistant principal, said Sokolow-Nikolic was an excellent
student who passed a number of optional state merit tests before
graduating.</TE>
<TE>   Sokolow-Nikolic's brother is a freshman at Oak Park High School.</TE>
<TE>   His mother taught summer art classes at the high school.</TE>
<TE>   Mount Sinai Memorial Park is handling the arrangements.</TE>

<HD>Longtime Civic Leader Alex Fiore Dies at 75</HD>
<DH>Thousand Oaks: The former mayor, who was on the City Council for 30
years, had lymphoma.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alex Fiore, a 30-year Thousand Oaks City Council member whose
service earned him the title "mayor emeritus," died Thursday night at Los
Robles Regional Medical Center. He was 75.</LD>
<LD>   One of the original council members after Thousand Oaks became a city
in 1964, Fiore was a driving force behind construction of the Civic Arts
Plaza, helped secure thousands of acres in open space and is credited
with helping to maintain the city's fiscal health over three decades.</LD>
<LD>   "His handprint is everywhere in this city," City Manager MaryJane Lazz
said. "Our residents have him to thank for the beauty of this community."</LD>
<TE>   Fiore was surrounded by friends and family members when he died of
complications stemming from lymphoma, a disease he struggled with for
several years. He is survived by his wife, Katy, a daughter, two sons and
several grandchildren. Funeral arrangements are pending.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and colleagues remembered Fiore as a quick-witted,
good-humored man who had unparalleled energy and passion for the
community.</TE>
<TE>   "I consider him to be a giant of this community," said Ventura County
Board of Supervisors Chairman Frank Schillo, who served on the council
with Fiore for 10 years. Schillo said he will adjourn the board's meeting
next week in Fiore's memory.</TE>
<TE>   "Alex always had the people of the community at heart, no matter what
he did," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One example was Fiore's Saturday meetings with the public that began
in 1971 at Janss Marketplace, then known as Conejo Village Mall. Every
week, he would set up a table and chair and listen to residents'
complaints and ideas.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Andy Fox, who came onto the panel in 1994, the year Fiore
retired, said the former mayor was a mentor. He served as the ultimate
example of what a public servant should be, Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether you agreed with Alex or not--whether you voted for him or
not--you had to appreciate the rationale and thought process behind his
decisions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fiore worked as a vice president and controller of finance and
administration of Rockwell International's Rocketdyne Corp. until 1984,
when he retired.</TE>
<TE>   He ran for City Council during the first elections in 1964 and was
among the original leaders to push for the city's incorporation. He spent
$37 on his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just the kind of person he was," said Chuck Cohen, a developer
who served on the council with Fiore for five years. "He was peerless as
far as being able to come up with solutions to civic problems. I'd walk
into a meeting fearful of a very difficult issue, and Alex would walk in
and be able to solve it in about 10 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Fiore had many accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote numerous ordinances, including the city's tight restrictions
on removing oak trees and building on ridgelines. He prevented Thousand
Oaks from imposing a municipal property tax and voted to fund dozens of
parks and ball fields. He also pushed for the building of the city's teen
center and a low-income housing project on Hillcrest Drive, both of which
were named after him.</TE>
<TE>   Fiore helped negotiate deals for thousands of acres in open space that
surround the city, most notably the acquisition of the Wildwood Mesa for
a regional park.</TE>
<TE>   But like any politician in Thousand Oaks, Fiore also weathered
criticism. His crusade for a $64-million city hall and regional
performing arts center was at times unpopular, sparking calls for his
ouster.</TE>
<TE>   Former Councilwoman Judy Lazar said she remembers many lively meetings
in which Fiore sparred with fellow council members and his critics.</TE>
<TE>   "Above all, Alex was funny, fun, honest and pulled no punches," she
said. "He just told it like it was."</TE>
<TE>   In his time on the council, Fiore attended 1,400 meetings and logged
more than 25,000 hours on city business, according to city officials. His
colleagues voted him in as mayor six times. When he left in 1994 he was
named "mayor emeritus," an honor bestowed on no other council member.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a passion and a vision to see what Thousand Oaks would and
could be in the years ahead," said Larry Horner, who worked as a council
member alongside Fiore for 17 years. "He became actively involved and
enjoyed it so much, I think it just became a part of him."</TE>

<HD>Costly Condo Blaze Blamed on Texas Boy</HD>
<DH>Crime: Charges follow a four-month probe in San Clemente. A summer
visitor, he allegedly 'wanted to see what a big fire would look like.'</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 12-year-old Texas boy was charged Friday with setting a San
Clemente brush fire that tore through Trafalgar Canyon in August,
destroying six homes and causing more than $4 million in property damage.</LD>
<LD>   The boy was spending the summer with a family in San Clemente and
"wanted to see what a big fire would look like," said Tori Richards, a
spokeswoman for the Orange County district attorney's office. He
allegedly tossed matches into parched brush at the bottom of the coastal
canyon near San Clemente Pier, prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   Two other minor boys--brothers in the home where the suspect was
staying--witnessed the fire but have not been charged, officials said.
The brothers tried to snuff out the fire, but the suspect held them back,
authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   The charges cap a four-month investigation by the Orange County Fire
Authority, which officials said was complicated by reluctant witnesses
and lengthy negotiations with the suspect's family and lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "Investigators had a good idea initially who did this, but they still
had to do a lot of work," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Joe Williams. "There
was a lot of reluctance on the part of a lot of people to come forward.
Also, when you're dealing with a minor, there's a presumption that they
don't know right from wrong. The investigators had to prove that he knew
he was doing something wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors did not name any of the boys involved because they are
minors. John Barnett, the suspect's lawyer, declined to comment on the
matter Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The boy, who lives with his parents in El Paso, remains there.
Prosectors say they hope the family will bring him to Orange County
voluntarily, where he will be tried in Juvenile Court on three counts of
arson to an inhabited structure and one count of arson to a forest. If
the boy's family refuses to bring him to California, prosecutors will
seek to extradite him, Richards said.</TE>
<TE>   At the site of the fire Friday, residents and victims expressed relief
that charges had been filed, but had sympathy for the suspect. Neighbors
said the boy and the two brothers were often seen skateboarding and
fooling around.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a terrible burden for a 12-year-old; it's real sad," said
Barbara Sullivan. Sullivan and her husband, Richard, lost their condo to
the fire and now live in a rental unit a mile away. They are trying to
rebuild the gutted condo.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not mad at him," Sullivan said. "I feel bad for him. . . . It's a
hard lesson for this child."</TE>
<TE>   The fire erupted at 3:20 p.m. Aug. 1, as the boys played along the
beach-side canyon. Prosecutors say that after setting the fire, the
suspect prevented the others from stopping it because he wanted to see
how large it would grow. When the blaze got out of control, the suspect
allegedly told a nearby lifeguard about it and ran.</TE>
<TE>   Fueled by ocean breezes and heavy coastal sage, the fire raced up a
steep, quarter-mile slope before engulfing a million-dollar condominium
complex on Cazador Lane. The fire then jumped to a second complex and
destroyed more units.</TE>
<TE>   No one was injured in the fire, but dozens of residents were forced to
evacuate as more than 100 firefighters battled the blaze. Several
witnesses reported seeing two or three teenagers running from the area
near the beach where the fire broke out.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office said it will seek victim restitution
from the boy's parents.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of the neighborhood said the boys were a fixture of the
summer scene and were known for their mischievousness.</TE>
<TE>   "They were bright boys," said Gayle Pentoney, who lives next to
several condos that were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   As an example, Pentoney said the boys figured out how to open an
automobile security gate from the outside, which allowed them access to a
hot tub in one condo complex.</TE>
<TE>   Today, scorched foundations are all that remain of many of the homes.
Yellow caution tape still rings many properties, and lots have been gated
off.</TE>
<TE>   Lynda Carpenter, whose home shared a wall with a condo that was
reduced to cinders, said her family is still struggling to cope with the
disaster. Her brother, she said, still gets upset when he sees fires
broadcast on television.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad how many lives it has impacted. People have gotten sick,
they've gotten stressed out, and it's still going on," Carpenter said.
"It's mind-boggling."</TE>

visiting. Witnesses said they saw boys running away.</CP>

<HD>Huntington Officer Not Charged in Shooting</HD>
<DH>Death: D.A. won't prosecute May killing of man who allegedly had a
toy gun. FBI still on case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Huntington Beach police officer who shot and killed a man
allegedly holding a toy rifle in May won't face criminal charges,
prosecutors said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting death of 18-year-old Antonio Saldivar, a farm worker whom
the officer apparently mistook for a crime suspect he was seeking,
sparked protests by some Latino activists.</LD>
<LD>   But prosecutors concluded that Officer Mark Wersching reacted
reasonably when he shot Saldivar, who reportedly turned toward the
officer with a toy gun in his hands.</LD>
<TE>   "The officer's instantaneous decision to defend his life from an
apparent deadly threat was reasonable," Deputy Dist. Atty. Carolyn
Carlisle-Raines said in a prepared statement.</TE>
<TE>   Wersching, an officer since 1995, was chasing a crime suspect in the
city's Oakview neighborhood when he spotted Saldivar, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The officer shouted at Saldivar in both English and Spanish to raise
his hands, but the teenager instead turned around and pointed a gun at
the officer, who shot him, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the Saldivar family question whether the shooting victim
was even carrying a toy weapon. Although no fingerprints were found on
the gun, witness statements led prosecutors to believe Saldivar was
carrying it when he was shot, said Senior Assistant Dist. Atty. Claudia
Silbar.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting sparked an FBI investigation and a federal civil rights
lawsuit, which are still pending.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Black, who's representing the Saldivar family in the federal civil
rights lawsuit, said it would have been difficult for prosecutors to
convict the officer because of the high burden of proof required in
criminal courts. But he thinks the department will be held liable in
civil court.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think Officer Wersching set out that night to kill an
innocent man," Black said. "But we know there's very little evidence that
indicates there was justification for shooting Mr. Saldivar."</TE>
<TE>   A leading Orange County Latino rights advocate said he was
disappointed by prosecutors' decision, but not surprised. Orange County
prosecutors, who review all police shootings, have never prosecuted an
officer for an on-duty shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "With that background, it does not surprise us," said Amin David,
president of Los Amigos of Orange County. "I do hope that the attorneys
that are helping this poor family will bring this case to the proper
place, a trial, and have a jury look at the situation."</TE>
<TE>   Police officials have said that the toy weapon found next to Saldivar
appeared extremely realistic. It had a wooden handle and a blue steel
barrel and was more than 20 inches long, said Lt. Chuck Thomas, the
department's spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "We are heartened by the results from the district attorney's office,
but it's still a tragedy for the officer involved, for the Saldivar
family, for the Huntington Beach community and the entire department,"
Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors based their decision on an investigation by the Orange
County Sheriff's Department, Silbar said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a thorough investigation and careful consideration of all
the facts," Silbar said.</TE>
<TE>   She said O.C. prosecutors carefully consider all officer-involved
shootings and discounted criticism that the department rubber-stamps
police shootings.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not advocates for any party, whether it's a police officer or
a citizen," Silbar said. "If we ever felt objectively that an officer was
involved in a criminally negligent shooting, it would be our duty to file
a case."</TE>
<TE>   David, who has criticized other officer-involved shootings, said he
believes the outcome of the Saldivar shooting is further evidence of a
need for an independent police commission in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "Evidence presented to a quasi-enforcement body like the district
attorney is viewed differently than it would be by the stockholders of
the county, the citizens," David said. "This raises again the need to
throw out this idea."</TE>

<HD>Mover Caught Trying to Sell Rare Coins, Police Say</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Newport Beach police arrested a moving company employee Friday
after recovering several rare coins he is suspected of stealing while on
a job for a high-profile sports agent.</LD>
<LD>   The coins, from an 1800s shipwreck, were stolen last month from Dwight
Manley, whose clients have included NBA stars Karl Malone and Dennis
Rodman, Newport Beach Police Sgt. Michael McDermott said.</LD>
<LD>   A coin shop employee alerted Manley when one of the movers tried to
sell the coins, saying Manley had given them to him as a gift, McDermott
said. Manley then contacted police.</LD>
<TE>   Manley, whose coin collection is valued in the millions of dollars,
told police that the coins were part of a cache recovered from the S.S.
Central America, which sank in rough seas off the coast of the Carolinas
in 1857.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives recovered nine of the coins in a vehicle owned by an
employee of the moving company, McDermott said.</TE>
<TE>   The employee, Douglas Bader, 32, was booked into the Newport Beach
jail on suspicion of grand theft.</TE>
<TE>   He was released Friday on $10,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   Manley, who had not realized any of his extensive collection was
missing, is checking to see whether other coins were taken, McDermott
said. A police investigation is continuing.</TE>
<TE>   When the Central America sank, it was carrying rare coins and gold
bars now valued at more than $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the coins were produced with gold mined in the California Gold
Rush. A treasure hunting team recovered the coins in 1987.</TE>

<HD>Yorba Linda Offers to Help Fund Campus</HD>
<DH>Education: Because the $80-million deal hinges on the school
district dropping a long-standing lawsuit against the city, the
superintendent is skeptical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to snare its own high school, the Yorba Linda City Council
has offered the local school district an $80-million package of land and
cash to build a campus, but only if educators drop their lawsuit over
disputed tax money.</LD>
<LD>   The council voted unanimously in closed session Thursday to give the
Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District 40 acres for a high school,
$20 million for design and start-up costs, plus other funds over the next
several years.</LD>
<LD>   The vote came as a surprise to school district officials, whose
attorneys have been in the midst of confidential negotiations with the
city over that very proposal. The suddenness of the council's decision
further fuels the school district's mistrust of the city, district Supt.
Dennis M. Smith said.</LD>
<TE>   "If indeed the city is going to provide us $80 million that included a
high school site, we would sign in a flash," Smith said. "But the
specific language has to be clear so it presents no wiggle room. The
history of Yorba Linda is such that we've not been treated in a way
that's fair, so why would we sign an agreement that wasn't explicit?"</TE>
<TE>   The school district and the city had been divided for years over the
question of whether Yorba Linda should get its own high school. While
city leaders pushed for the school, district officials said they couldn't
afford it and there was no need for it.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, things changed when district officials said explosive
growth over the past decade combined with the latest projections meant
there were enough students to justify a new high school.</TE>
<TE>   Most Yorba Linda students attend the district's Esperanza High in
Anaheim. Built for 1,800 students, the school has an enrollment of about
3,000. To handle the overflow, 62 portable classrooms have been moved in,
and some classes are given at a former elementary school across the
street.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating the high school construction issue is the lawsuit the
district filed against the city two years ago and the ensuing hostility
it engendered between school administrators and council members.</TE>
<TE>   The district contends that the city violated an agreement the two
sides signed more than 15 years ago to compensate the schools for tax
funds the school district lost when Yorba Linda formed a redevelopment
district. Smith said the city currently owes Placentia-Yorba Linda
Unified $8 million under terms of the original agreement. He said that
figure would grow to $200 million more by the time the agreement expires
in 2034. City officials hotly dispute that amount.</TE>
<TE>   A trial, which repeatedly has been postponed, is slated to begin Jan.
22 in Superior Court. And in March, the school district will ask voters
to approve a $102-million bond measure, money that would go toward
renovation and construction throughout the district.</TE>
<TE>   "Without the bond issue, we won't get a high school," Smith said.
"Without a redevelopment agreement, we won't get a high school."</TE>
<TE>   Against that backdrop, the Yorba Linda City Council made the offer of
land and money. The city would be required to spend no more than $15
million for the campus under the proposal, said City Councilman John M.
Gullixson, who has been leading the fight for a high school in Yorba
Linda. The city also offered to increase the district's share of
redevelopment tax</TE>
<TE>   dollars by 25%. City Manager Terrence Belanger did not return calls
seeking comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said that although the district is inclined to accept the money
offer, he said the district would get only half the amount he contends
the original redevelopment agreement called for.</TE>
<TE>   Gullixson said the district has until Jan. 14, the day before the next
council meeting, to consider the deal. "We will either have a deal or we
won't," Gullixson said.</TE>
<TE>   Although he said he has long been a supporter of a high school in
Yorba Linda, Gullixson criticized the way the district is run.</TE>
<TE>   "Placentia-Yorba Linda probably has facilities in the bottom 20% of
the county," he said. "They're awful. They don't keep them up."</TE>
<TE>   Replied Smith: "It's just an indication with how out of touch he is
with the community and with the schools and the quality of education
afforded our children."</TE>
<TE>   Gullixson, a lawyer whose two children attended Esperanza, does not
view the lawsuit and the proposed high school agreement as related.</TE>
<TE>   Because council members want a local high school, "we said we'll hold
our nose in regard to your lawsuit, and we'll make an offer."</TE>
<TE>   Smith, meanwhile, said the school district was never notified that the
council would discuss or vote on the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't even aware of that meeting," he said. "We were in the
midst of confidential settlement discussions."</TE>
<TE>   He said Yorba Linda submitted a settlement agreement to the district
two weeks ago. The district had responded Dec. 28 with its own changes,
few of which made it into the version finally approved by the council,
Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   The district's changes had to do with language settling the dispute
over redevelopment taxes, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   "Trust is one thing built over time, and the action of the city has
been such that we want to make sure it's in writing," Smith said.</TE>

<HD>Backers of Airport Win in Court Test</HD>
<DH>El Toro: Appellate justices uphold a ruling that had tossed out
Measure F as unconstitutional.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a victory for El Toro airport supporters, an appellate court
Friday upheld the decision of a Los Angeles judge to throw out Measure
F--an Orange County ballot initiative that required two-thirds voter
approval for major public works projects, including commercial airports.</LD>
<LD>   The decision does not affect Measure W, a March ballot measure that
would convert the former El Toro Marine Corps Air Station into a huge
urban park instead of a commercial airport.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a huge, huge win," said Barbara Lichman, executive director
of the Airport Working Group, the leading proponent of converting the
base into an airport. "If we had lost on this, things would have changed
greatly."</LD>
<TE>   In its 32-page opinion, a state appeals court in San Diego concurred
with Superior Court Judge S. James Otero, who in December 2000 ruled that
Measure F was "fundamentally flawed" and violated the California
Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   Otero concluded that the initiative thwarted the authority of the
county Board of Supervisors, interfered with essential government
functions and was unconstitutionally vague.</TE>
<TE>   Airports, jails and hazardous-waste landfills are essential
responsibilities of local government, Otero wrote. "Although these powers
may be subject to restrictions under the initiative process, an
initiative cannot be used to greatly impair or wholly destroy those
powers."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of converting the base into a commercial airport appealed
Otero's decision in an attempt to reinstate Measure F.</TE>
<TE>   Agreeing with Otero, justices concluded that Measure F "interferes
with the essential government functions of fiscal planning and land use
planning. It impermissibly interferes with administrative and executive
acts, and it is unconstitutionally vague," making it difficult for the
supervisors to comply with.</TE>
<TE>   "This win changes things greatly," said Lichman, who added that
pro-airport forces might challenge Measure W in court if it passes.</TE>
<TE>   El Toro airport opponents downplayed the court decision, saying that
things have swung dramatically in their favor since Otero's ruling. They
cited the "Great Park" initiative and a number of opinion polls, which
indicate that a majority of Orange County voters oppose a new airport.</TE>
<TE>   "This does not take away from the fact that 67% of the voters in this
county want another opportunity to vote on the airport," said Meg Waters,
a spokeswoman for the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority. Richard Jacobs,
an attorney for the antiairport authority, said he will recommend to the
organization's board that they appeal the Measure F ruling to the state
Supreme Court.</TE>

<HD>2 Other Schools Hit by Vandals; Computer, TV Equipment Taken</HD>
<DH>Crime: Loss at Saddleback Valley schools put at $12,000. Capistrano
Unified campuses also have suffered damage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police said Friday that they are investigating two school vandalism
incidents in south Orange County to determine whether they were the work
of two adults and a juvenile arrested on suspicion of trashing campuses
in Capistrano Unified School District.</LD>
<LD>   Saddleback Valley Unified School District officials said vandals broke
into San Joaquin Elementary School in Laguna Hills and Los Alisos
Intermediate School in Mission Viejo on Tuesday night and stole
television and computer equipment valued at $12,000.</LD>
<LD>   That was less than the $50,000 in damage from a Wednesday rampage
through Capistrano Valley High, Marco Forster Middle and Del Obispo
Elementary schools, but it was still troubling to district officials.</LD>
<TE>   "It is rare for this to happen during the break, and this level of
theft is unusual for us," said Jerry Gross, superintendent of Saddleback
Valley Unified.</TE>
<TE>   Graffiti was reported at two other elementary schools in the district,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very disturbing that our district and Capistrano Unified have
been visited by such crime," Gross said.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Amormino, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department,
said detectives are investigating whether the two crime sprees are
related.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Marco Forster situation, they seemed intent on causing
destruction rather than taking things like they did at Los Alisos and San
Joaquin," Amormino said. "So I kind of doubt the two go together. But
we're still looking into it."</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Ana, authorities reported minor vandalism at three schools
over the holiday break. In Garden Grove, authorities said an elementary
school had a break-in last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Three suspects were arrested in Wednesday's South County incident
after they were spotted on the roof of Marco Forster school. Booked on
suspicion of felony vandalism were Daniel J. Kenway, 18, a Dana Hills
High School student; Robert DeLuca, 19, a Capistrano Valley High
graduate; and a 17-year-old student at Dana Hills High.</TE>

<HD>Probation for Frisky; Care Bill for Owner</HD>
<DH>Rabies: Cat who was cornered by a coyote is released to family, who
may contest cost of board.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frisky the cat, quarantined since last month after a brush with a
coyote and at one point facing a death sentence, went home Friday but
will be under house arrest for three months.</LD>
<LD>   "Hi, sweetie!" said Twyla Henson as she left Orange County Animal Care
Services in Orange with the 5-year-old cat.</LD>
<LD>   Frisky, who lives with the Henson family in Fullerton, was cornered by
a coyote Sept. 22 on a neighbor's porch. Though the family said the pet
was not bitten, they alerted county animal-control officials to the
encounter, in case the coyote was rabid.</LD>
<TE>   The Hensons say they were led to believe that the period of quarantine
would be 10 days; Animal Care Services insists it always intended for the
quarantine to last six months, and that when one of their officers
examined Frisky, he found a puncture wound on the cat's hip.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 23, an animal-control officer spotted Frisky outdoors and
reminded the Hensons about the quarantine rules. When the cat was outside
again the next day, she was picked up and taken to the pound.</TE>
<TE>   The Hensons then faced the choice of paying the county $1,100 to board
the cat until the quarantine period ends March 22, or have Frisky
euthanized.</TE>
<TE>   To get the cat back, Henson had to sign a contract agreeing to keep
Frisky indoors, to report any illness to Animal Care Services and allow
unannounced visits by an animal probation officer of sorts.</TE>
<TE>   "So, isolation and confinement," animal-service spokeswoman Kathy
Francis said to Henson as she left Friday with the cat.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I know. I've been told," Henson said.</TE>
<TE>   The family paid the county $70 for Frisky's boarding and will be
billed another $70, but Henson said she plans to contest the second bill.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to be responsible and do the right thing, and look what it's
gotten us," she said. "I don't care if I see a herd of elephants running
down the street, I am never calling those people again."</TE>
<TE>   Henson, husband Jeff and their five children and stepchildren share
their home on West Ash Avenue with a python, several box turtles and a
water-dragon lizard, in addition to Frisky. Twyla Henson said she is
convinced the county agency agreed to release the cat only because of a
public outcry after news reports about the situation.</TE>
<TE>   Francis of Animal Care Services said the supervised release was always
an option, which the Hensons would have known if they had called her
instead of the news media.</TE>
<TE>   Francis said she received three e-mails and a letter protesting the
feline's incarceration. She would not reveal the contents but said one
person called her a "grinch."</TE>
<TE>   She joked about requiring Frisky to wear an electronic bracelet, as
humans do under house arrest, but said the issue is no laughing matter.
If the cat should develop rabies and bite somebody, critics would
lambaste the agency for being too lax, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The agency takes precautions, and "We haven't had a case of human
rabies for 40 or 50 years," Francis said. "That's why we take it very
seriously."</TE>

<HD>Arrest of Alleged 'Hair Bandit' Startles Friends</HD>
<DH>Crime: The suspect's relatives say they noticed a recent
personality change.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Howard's arrest New Year's Day has confounded his relatives
and business partner, especially because of the charge: that a hair
fetish allegedly drove him to chop off women's hair on the streets.</LD>
<LD>   "It's very bizarre," said Howard's older brother Jack, a Los Angeles
County probation officer. "We don't really understand it."</LD>
<LD>   He described his brother as a family man and bicycle shop owner who
had lived a stable life and had never been in trouble with the law.</LD>
<TE>   However, he said, family members noticed a dramatic personality change
in mid-December that they believe was triggered by drug abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Howard said he called authorities after the "Hair Bandit" attacks
were reported in the media, but would not say why he suspected his
brother.</TE>
<TE>   "That was not an easy thing to do," he said. "But given my position
and experience, I've got to think about victims."</TE>
<TE>   Police say Michael Howard, 47, attacked six women and a young girl in
the Long Beach area and East Los Angeles in the last two weeks of
December. He is accused of grabbing them from behind as they sat or
walked along major streets, then shearing their hair with scissors or a
knife.</TE>
<TE>   Gian Simonetti said his friend and business partner never mentioned
any fascination with hair in the 25 years they worked together.</TE>
<TE>   "He surprised everybody," said Simonetti, who owns Simo Cycle--a
custom bicycle shop in Huntington Beach--with Michael Howard. "I thought
it was crazy, and feel sorry for him."</TE>
<TE>   Howard, who lives in Norwalk, had been struggling recently with drugs
and had not worked a full week in six months, Simonetti said.</TE>
<TE>'He Likes the Sound of Scissors'</TE>
<TE>   "He was always coming in late," Simonetti said. "I've been going to
his house, trying to get him to come out."</TE>
<TE>   Though Howard's brother and Simonetti did not learn about the
suspect's alleged hair fetish until recently, a woman who described
herself as a longtime friend said she knew Howard had paid women as much
as $200 to let him cut their hair.</TE>
<TE>   "He liked playing with it, brushing it, everything about it," said
51-year-old Vicki Parker, who said she had been a prostitute in the past.
"He says he likes the sound of scissors cutting hair."</TE>
<TE>   Howard was ashamed and didn't know what to do, she said. But she
called him a "wonderful person" and said she never felt threatened.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect had been depressed over his father's death and his failing
business, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was just not in his right frame of mind," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Raised in Inglewood, Michael Lynn Howard became interested in bicycles
as a boy working a newspaper route. He started fixing and building his
own bikes, and teamed up with Simonetti soon after high school.</TE>
<TE>   A stocky man with a rough complexion and goatee, Howard was married
for several years but never had children, his brother said. More than 10
years ago, the suspect purchased a clay-colored stucco house with a
manicured lawn in Norwalk.</TE>
<TE>   His neighbors said Howard is quiet.</TE>
<TE>   "It was mostly 'Hi' and 'Bye' with him," said Hector Montenegro, who
has lived next door to Howard for four years.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very private," said Christene VonRavensberg. "I don't think he
liked the neighbors."</TE>
<TE>   On New Year's Eve, a sheriff's deputy spotted Howard as he was
allegedly holding a woman in a chokehold at a pay phone in East Los
Angeles. The deputy chased Howard, who climbed into a nearby car and
tried to run him down, authorities said. The deputy responded by firing
several shots, but the suspect drove away, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrested Howard the next day at an apartment building on Pine
Avenue in Long Beach, where he had gone to see a friend.</TE>
<TE>   The victims ranged in age from 12 to 45, and all but two were Latinas,
police said, adding that some of the women suffered neck injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Scott Carbaugh said Howard is a dangerous criminal
whose alleged crimes were sexually motivated.</TE>
<TE>   Howard was charged Thursday with six counts of second-degree robbery,
one count of committing a lewd act on a child and one count of assault on
a police officer. If convicted, he could be sentenced to 15 years in
state prison.</TE>
<TE>   He is in Los Angeles County Jail in lieu of $500,000 bail and is
scheduled to appear in court for arraignment Jan. 17. Authorities say
they are still checking for additional victims.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender Michael Concha said prosecutors have taken a
leap by charging Howard with a lewd act on a child in addition to the
robberies. "There's no sexual molestation here at all," Concha said.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Det. Joe Purcell said he believed that violence might have
occurred if an arrest had not been made.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a strange case," the detective said. "It's the first time I've
ever heard of something like this."</TE>
<TE>Many Fetishes Grow Over Time</TE>
<TE>   Hair fetishes are rare, but people who engage in them could collect
hair for sexual gratification, said Al Cooper, a Stanford University
psychologist and clinical director of the San Jose Marital &amp; Sexuality
Centre.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a million different kinds of variations, whether it's
fingernails, hair or underwear," he said. "Hair is not the most common,
but it is not unheard of."</TE>
<TE>   Cooper added that fetishes escalate over time in about half the cases.</TE>
<TE>   Some women in the Long Beach area were relieved at the arrest. With
her long chestnut hair pulled into a knot behind her head, housewife
Veronica Alvarez waited for a bus Thursday on Long Beach Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad they caught him," she said. "I don't know what I would do if
he came up to me. I would scream, and I would fight him."</TE>

<HD>PR Firm Gives Up Airport Contract</HD>
<DH>Finances: The City Council was poised to rescind an extension of
consultant's $9-million deal while LAX is facing a financial crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY L. RABIN</AU>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A politically connected public relations firm abruptly pulled out
of its contract with Los Angeles International Airport Friday, only days
before airport officials planned to rescind a controversial extension of
the firm's $9-million deal.</LD>
<LD>   Winner &amp; Associates announced the withdrawal from the airport contract
in a three-page letter to Mayor James K. Hahn. The missive arrived at
City Hall just as airport officials were placing a last-minute motion to
rescind the contract on Tuesday's agenda for the city Airport Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The same commission had last month unanimously approved a one-year,
$1.5-million extension for the firm, despite objections from airport
executives who had slashed funding for the public relations effort. The
plan the company had been hired to publicize had been scrapped by the
mayor.</LD>
<TE>   The commission is appointed by Hahn, who received substantial
fund-raising support from the public relations company's president,
Charles Winner, in last year's mayor's race.</TE>
<TE>   Reports in The Times have prompted questions from some City Council
members about the need for extending the contract at a time when LAX is
facing the worst financial crisis in its history.</TE>
<TE>   Passenger traffic at the world's third-busiest airport has plummeted
since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The drop in air travel and sharply
higher security costs have carved a gaping $127-million hole in the
airport's budget.</TE>
<TE>   Winner's Encino-based company was first hired three years ago to help
inform the public about a $12-billion expansion plan for the airport. The
contract was extended five times to pay the company and its
subcontractors a total of nearly $9 million through last September.</TE>
<TE>   The Encino-based company is withdrawing from the contract because
recent news stories, columns and editorials have left "inaccurate
impressions" with the public about the work being done, Winner said.</TE>
<TE>   He said suggestions that the contract extension was a political deal
damaged his business. Winner said he has no intention of bidding on any
other contract with the airport.</TE>
<TE>   The veteran political consultant and advertising executive said he
objected to the media inferences that spending airport money on the PR
contract would cost city employees their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Winner said he was also concerned that the controversy swirling around
the public relations contract would detract from Hahn's effort to win
support for building a safer airport.</TE>
<TE>   The administration of former Mayor Richard Riordan brought Winner and
his company on board in 1998 to disseminate information and organize
multiple public meetings about the LAX "master plan."</TE>
<TE>   But that proposal died when Hahn was elected last June, after
promising he would not proceed with the Riordan plan. The new mayor said
he favored spreading a future increase in airline traffic among several
Southern California airports.</TE>
<TE>   After the terrorist attacks, Hahn announced he would develop a new
alternative that shifted the focus of airport modernization from
expansion to security.</TE>
<TE>Political Ties to Hahn Detailed</TE>
<TE>   The Winner contract came before the City Council Dec. 18, but the
lawmakers postponed a vote on the matter until Jan. 15. The council's
initial discussion came the same day that a story in The Times detailed
Winner's political ties to Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   Winner said he held three fund-raisers during the mayoral campaign for
Hahn, at the request of the candidate. Winner, his family and associates
also gave more than $20,000 to the future mayor's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Winner paid another $20,000 for a mailer endorsing Hahn's
election to voters on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   At last month's council meeting, lawmakers asked if Winner was
receiving beneficial treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's office rejected suggestions that the contract extension,
granted by the mayor's appointees, was a political favor.</TE>
<TE>   Several council members questioned the Airport Commission's decision
to award the $1.5-million contract at a time that the airport is taking
extraordinary measures to plug its projected deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss complained that he had been provided with little
information on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The council asked the city's legislative analyst to draft a report
detailing what Winner and his subcontractors did for the nearly $9
million paid by the airport over the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   Several subcontractors who worked for Winner on the airport contract
privately expressed concern about the firm's management style and the
quality of work the airport received for its multimillion-dollar
investment.</TE>
<TE>   One subcontractor, who asked to remain anonymous, described feeling
"guilty, truly guilty," for accepting payment for services Winner asked
him to provide because so little real work was done.</TE>
<TE>   "People who didn't get this contract wish they would have gotten it.
It would be your dream contract," the subcontractor said.</TE>
<TE>   Winner countered those allegations in a 40-page report sent Friday to
city officials, council members and The Times.</TE>
<TE>   The document covers point by point the activities that Winner says his
firm and numerous subcontractors undertook to disseminate information
about the master plan "to a five-county population of 15 million people."</TE>
<TE>   It discusses how Winner had to extend the scope of its work on the
master plan in part because "the public review and comment period for the
draft LAX Master Plan was unprecedented."</TE>
<TE>   Some services Winner outlined in the report include:</TE>
<TE>   * Simplifying thousands of pages of technical materials for the
public.</TE>
<TE>   * Managing more than 20 subcontractors.</TE>
<TE>   * Interacting with members of the media.</TE>
<TE>   * Reaching out to thousands of businesses, community and labor
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   * Producing documents including brochures, videotapes and news
releases.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook said Hahn and the mayor's office played
no part in Winner's decision to withdraw from the airport contract.
However, the mayor's office did ask airport officials to seek new bids on
an expanded public relations contract.</TE>
<TE>   The item added to the Airport Commission agenda late Friday calls for
rescinding the contract extension for Winner and requesting new bids for
expanded public relation services.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to focusing on the master plan for the future of the
airport, Middlebrook said the city needs help drawing passengers back to
LAX and countering a sense that the airport is hard to use after the
terrorist attacks.</TE>

<HD>Family Is Caught Between Agencies</HD>
<DH>Bureaucracy: HUD wants to oust them even though they had paid their
rent to a city escrow account.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If someone else had made the promise, Veronica Alvarado might not
have been surprised when a deputy showed up at her door.</LD>
<LD>   But the promise to help tenants of her rundown apartment on 41st
Street came from the Los Angeles Housing Department: Pay rent into a city
escrow account and utilities in the building will not be turned off, the
letter explained. By law, tenants cannot be evicted for paying the city
rather than the owner.</LD>
<LD>   For months, Alvarado and her husband sent their rent checks to the
city and felt secure. But in November, a sheriff's deputy showed up with
a notice that gave Alvarado, her husband and two children five days to
vacate.</LD>
<TE>   The source of the eviction was the federal Department of Housing and
Urban Development, the family's new landlord and the agency that is
supposed to assist low-income tenants.</TE>
<TE>   In the days since, the couple have found themselves caught between two
behemoth agencies: on one side the city and its promised protections, on
the other, the federal government and its demands.</TE>
<TE>   A settlement brokered with the help of the office of U.S. Rep. Diane
Watson (D-Los Angeles) may allow the family to stay in their home until
Jan. 5 and to receive relocation assistance. In exchange, the family has
agreed not to sue HUD or Golden Feather Realty Services, which oversees
the building and other HUD properties.</TE>
<TE>   The case demonstrates an absence of communication between two
governmental agencies with responsibility for assisting tenants. It also
underscores a rift between local housing officials' expectations of HUD
and the agency's practices.</TE>
<TE>   "What this case is about is the shocking display by [HUD] of evicting
people who are paying the rent into the lawful local ordinance account,"
said Rod Field of the Los Angeles Housing Law Project, the attorney who
helped write a city ordinance governing escrow accounts and who
represents the family.</TE>
<TE>   Edessa George, who represented Golden Feather in the Alvarado case,
said the agency did not know the family paid into the city escrow
account.</TE>
<TE>   The family was evicted, George said, because Alvarado and her husband
failed to respond to several notices delivered by a law firm on behalf of
Golden Feather and HUD.</TE>
<TE>   "The firm did everything the right way," George said. "Nobody's trying
to get around a law here."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, a HUD spokesman said letters demanding rent on HUD's behalf were
improper. In fact, after HUD acquired the building the family should not
have been required to pay rent at all, the spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>Ability to Garnishee Rent</TE>
<TE>   Such evictions could threaten to disrupt the tenant cooperation that
is key to the city's code enforcement program. The program is built on
the premise that the city can essentially garnishee the rents at a
building until an owner corrects the problems.</TE>
<TE>   Buildings that are not up to code are placed in the city's Utilities
Maintenance Program and Rent Escrow Account Program. Tenants pay into the
account--often reduced rents--until buildings are improved.</TE>
<TE>   Without the programs, some landlords simply ignored housing laws
"despite repeated citations for uninhabitable conditions," said Garry W.
Pinney, general manager of the city's Housing Department, in a
declaration for another Rent Escrow Account Program eviction case last
year.</TE>
<TE>   "Without eviction protections, tenants will not pay their rents into
[the program] and recalcitrant landlords will continue to profit," Pinney
said in the declaration.</TE>
<TE>   When landlords repeatedly fail to pay their bills, the Department of
Water and Power refers the account to the Utilities Maintenance Program.
The goal is to offer tenants an alternative to living without utilities
by paying DWP bills through the city escrow account.</TE>
<TE>   Veronica Alvarado and her husband, Arthur Lopez, live in one such
building. In the three years that the couple have lived in the drab,
two-story building, they had several owners.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't fix anything," Alvarado said, sitting in the living room
of her one-bedroom apartment. "This carpet here we put down ourselves
because what we had was very dirty and I have children. They said they
were going to fix the bathroom too. They didn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   But the money her husband makes selling grilled corn on the street,
combined with the money she makes selling products at a swap meet, was
enough to pay the rent.</TE>
<TE>   By April 2000, the then-owners of the building had stopped paying the
water bill and owed DWP $2,493.</TE>
<TE>   The couple thought things would improve when they began paying into
the city's escrow program early last year, said Alvarado, who speaks only
Spanish. But in July 2001, after the owner defaulted, HUD took over.</TE>
<TE>   In September, according to court documents, attorneys working on
behalf of HUD said they served the family two notices requesting
information about their tenancy. In October, the firm served a notice
asking the family to pay $350 in rent to the law offices of Steven J.
Melmet and a three-day notice to "pay rent or move out."</TE>
<TE>   "If she had responded to all of those notices she would have been
sitting quite pretty," George said.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the couple were served with a summons and complaint, the
realty company attorney said. The complaint asks the family to move out,
pay rent owed and damages.</TE>
<TE>   But HUD officials said that the agency typically takes over unoccupied
buildings and that it does not collect rents in occupied buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "Our policy is we don't collect rents from tenants," said a HUD
spokesman. "[The letters] were sent out in error. There will be no
letters sent out like that on HUD's behalf again."</TE>
<TE>   City records show the family continued to pay rent each month into the
city escrow account.</TE>
<TE>   But the attorneys representing HUD weren't so diligent, city records
show. Although HUD took over the building in July, the agency has yet to
register the building, as the city requires. Nor did attorneys file the
required declaration of intent to evict tenants.</TE>
<TE>   The couple were surprised, Alvarado said, to find the notice to
vacate--the last step before a deputy arrives to lock out evicted
tenants. They had already paid their rent to the city. Alvardo said the
family had no inkling of the eviction case, which had already been lost
when they failed to appear in court.</TE>
<TE>   In her own court challenge, Alvarado told the judge she had not been
served regarding the eviction case. She asked that a hearing be held
giving her an opportunity to respond. That request was denied.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the judge would help us because we were paying the rent
well," she said. "But it wasn't like that."</TE>
<TE>   In a second attempt, Field represented the family and tried to present
the problem through their eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "The defendants were asked by one city agency or one government
agency, the Housing Department, to pay their rent into the city's
programs," he said, according to court transcripts. "They did what they
were told to do and now they are getting evicted."</TE>
<TE>   And although HUD is the owner, it has failed to pay DWP bills at the
building. That's left tenants with the responsibility, Field argued in
court.</TE>
<TE>   According to transcripts, Superior Court Judge Brett C. Klein noted
that the court sent a legal notice. He did not accept the claim that
"neither husband, nor wife knew anything about this lawsuit pending."</TE>
<TE>   The judge found that the family might have had a defense but, instead,
simply decided "that all of the notices coming to the house were not
important enough to deal with."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the judge upheld the eviction, but gave the family until
Dec. 19--the day through which they had paid rent--to move out of their
home. (The deal brokered by Rep. Watson's office would extend the
family's tenancy by nearly a month.)</TE>
<TE>   "She was in a Catch-22," said Don Wilson, a senior deputy for Watson,
who helped forge a settlement for Alvarado. "But she did comply with the
city's request."</TE>
<TE>   Because notices are in English, one HUD official said, a language
barrier probably also contributed to the family's problems.</TE>
<TE>   The family will receive $5,000 in relocation fees under the
settlement, but they will also enter a tight market. "We've been looking,
but everything is so expensive," said Veronica Alvarado.</TE>
<TE>   Field sees a bitter irony in the case.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the agency that is supposed to provide affordable housing,
not put people on the street when they've paid their rent," the attorney
said of HUD.</TE>
<TE>Differing Views of Escrow Accounts</TE>
<TE>   The case also illustrates the different ways these agencies view
tenants who pay into escrow accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that she was paying her rent to [the escrow account] does
not mean she was a righteous, rent-paying tenant, authorized to be
there," George said. "That doesn't necessarily mean anything."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has a large number of rent fraud cases, George said. The
family could have been the victim of scam artists, who sometimes break
into boarded-up buildings and rent them out.</TE>
<TE>   In other cases, she has encountered residents who are not lawful
tenants of HUD properties but pay into city rent escrow accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "They do it to get the relocation fees," George said. Ken Simmons,
assistant general manager, said he is not aware of any cases in which
tenants paying into escrow accounts have faced similar problems. But
Field said his office is handling other cases.</TE>
<TE>   The tenants' attorney worries that these evictions may ultimately
weaken the city's ability to pressure landlords into maintaining their
property.</TE>
<TE>   "That kills the whole code enforcement program."</TE>

<HD>Reformed Child Support System Termed a Success</HD>
<DH>Services: Glowing report comes on the two-year anniversary of the
state agency that collects court-ordered payments, whose amounts doubled
on average per case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years after California overhauled its beleaguered child support
system, state officials and advocates said Friday that the new program
has exceeded expectations in collecting money for single-parent families.</LD>
<LD>   With a record $2 billion a year now collected from parents ordered to
pay child support, the new state Department of Child Support Services has
more than doubled the average amount brought in per case, from $419 in
fiscal 1996 to $1,015 in 2000, officials said. The 2001 figures are not
yet available.</LD>
<LD>   Just as important, they said, the new department has increased the
number of cases in which paternity has been established in court,
expanded the number of children covered by health insurance and enhanced
the customer services that just a few years ago were a constant source of
controversy.</LD>
<TE>   "For the first time in the history of California, child support
enforcement embraces the idea of customer service," said Melanie Snider,
a director of the Assn. for Children for Enforcement of Support, a
national advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   Snider was among the child support advocates and state officials in
Sacramento on Friday to mark the two-year anniversary of the new child
support department, launched after years of complaints to the Legislature
about the performance of California counties on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Before the department was created, district attorneys were responsible
for running the child support agencies in all 58 counties and did so with
varying degrees of success. But the lack of uniform regulations and poor
overall performance--exemplified by a still poor collection record in Los
Angeles County--led lawmakers to transform the way the state handles
child support.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers stripped control of the local programs from prosecutors and
established new statewide performance standards, with an emphasis on
collecting current support, rather than past due amounts, to help keep
single-parent families intact and off public assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an example where a deeply entrenched bureaucracy can be
changed and changed for the better," said Lenny Goldberg of the National
Center for Youth Law at a news conference in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   One result has been that about two-thirds of the state's current cases
involve families that are not on welfare--a reversal of what state
officials were reporting several years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "What that means is that about two-thirds of the $2 billion [in
collections] is going directly to families," instead of repaying county
welfare systems, said Curtis L. Child, director of the state child
support department. "So the magnitude of that number is important in
looking at a program that is directed at family self-sufficiency."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he said, his department has saved the state more than $4
million by eliminating some local administrative costs.</TE>
<TE>   The department has plowed savings into better customer service,
including the addition of local ombudsmen throughout California to
respond to complaints about local programs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The reorganization has helped to foster a new level of cooperation
between child support advocates, fathers' rights groups and others in
handling the thorny issue of child support collections, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Assemblywoman Dion Aroner (D-Berkeley): "This is one of the few
times when we get to look at a reform package and see the accomplishments
come to fruition in such a short period of time."</TE>
<TE>   The report was issued at the same time state officials released the
results of a performance analysis of Los Angeles County's long-troubled
child support collection program.</TE>
<TE>   The analysis, by Denver-based Policy Studies Inc., concludes that the
county's program has increased the amount collected from $212 million in
1997 to $425 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   The report says the county has achieved an "impressive rate" of
compliance with federal deadlines for child support cases, an indication
that it is meeting deadlines for such actions as establishing paternity
and obtaining court orders for collections.</TE>
<TE>   But the study also found that the county's collection rate for current
support was only 32%, "very low" compared with the state and nation. The
latest state figures show that collections on current support in
California averaged 44%, while nationwide the figure was 56%.</TE>
<TE>   The county's performance in other key areas has also been poor.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the report found, Los Angeles County has an
"extraordinarily high" rate of court orders obtained by
default--79%--because those sued for child support fail, for whatever
reasons, to appear in court. That default rate, the report says, not only
raises serious questions about the fairness of the county's approach, but
also gives the court orders for child support "less credibility and makes
them harder to enforce."</TE>

<HD>Catholics Slam Napa Art Exhibit</HD>
<DH>Museum: A group says figures of the pope and nuns defecating are
offensive. Copia food center defends the works.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>A national Roman Catholic group is protesting an exhibit at Copia,
the Napa Valley's heralded new food, wine and arts museum, that includes
figurines of the pope and several nuns defecating.</LD>
<LD>   Activists say the work by Spanish artist Antoni Miralda has no place
in a museum funded in part by tax dollars, including money from
Catholics. The exhibit, titled "Active Ingredients," also displays
miniature figures of Santa Claus and Fidel Castro in similar poses.</LD>
<LD>   "Catholics in the state of California are paying to have their
religion depicted in a way that's offensive," said Patrick Scully, a
spokesman for the Catholic League of Religious and Civil Rights. "This
exhibit is insulting. It's gratuitous. It's unnecessary."</LD>
<TE>   Scully said that scores of the New York-based group's 350,000 members
nationwide who had seen or read about the exhibit had called to complain.
This week, leaders sent a letter to museum officials, who responded with
an e-mail defending the depictions.</TE>
<TE>   "These figurines symbolize the cycle of eating and fertilization of
the earth, which is a requisite for future existence," wrote Copia
Executive Director Peggy Loar, according to a news release circulated
Friday by the Catholic group.</TE>
<TE>   To which Catholic League President William Donohue sarcastically
responded in the release: "Now I get it: To show his appreciation of
Mother Earth, Miralda had to show the pope and nuns defecating. But why
couldn't he have chosen the Lone Ranger and Tonto instead? Or better yet,
just Tonto and a few of his Indian buddies."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Friday, Loar said the activists were spreading
inaccuracies. "It's surprising that a national organization would send
out a news release with so much misinformation about one artwork in an
entire exhibit they have never seen," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The 35 figurines, each about the size of a chess piece, are rooted in
Spanish Catholicism. "They're called caganers and they're part of a
Catholic Catalonian tradition that dates back to the 1800s," Loar said.
"They're included in nativity scenes to ensure good luck for farmers in
the following year. We've done our homework on this."</TE>
<TE>   A museum spokeswoman said the Catalonian figurines were traditionally
peasants, not Popeye, Santa Claus or the pope, as included in the
exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   Loar blasted the group for claiming that the museum received $75
million in public funding, saying the Copia had only recently received a
$50,000 government grant.</TE>
<TE>   "And I think the group's mention of Tonto and his buddies in their
release is insulting to American Indians. This from a group that touts
religious and civil rights."</TE>
<TE>   Donohue was unavailable for comment Friday. But Scully said the
comments showed the "ludicrousness" of the artist's vision.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is you won't see any museum showing an American Indian
defecating because those images are important to people and they're
sensitive," he said. "But when it comes to Catholic imagery, it's open
season for the arts community. And that's not right."</TE>
<TE>   Scully acknowledged that neither he nor Donohue had seen the exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   Napa City Councilman Harry Martin said Catholic museum volunteers had
quit over the works.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives Napa a black eye," he said. "People promote this place as
the shrine of Napa. Locals say they no longer have to go to the Louvre in
Paris because the Parisians are going to come here.</TE>
<TE>   "Now local Catholic groups are canceling functions there. This may
bring a few curiosity seekers, but that's a one-shot deal."</TE>
<TE>   Named for the Roman goddess of abundance, Copia aspires in its
advertising to be "the world's leading cultural center dedicated to the
discovery, understanding and celebration of wine, food and the arts."</TE>
<TE>   The two-story structure of stone, concrete, metal and glass, with
13,000 square feet of gallery space, opened last fall. The brainchild of
vintner Robert Mondavi, the museum offers wine tasting and gourmet dining
along with public programs in its demonstration kitchen, classrooms,
gardens and theaters.</TE>
<TE>   The $55-million nonprofit museum is in large part funded by private
donations, including $20 million from Mondavi.</TE>
<TE>   "Active Ingredients," which runs through April 22, features specially
commissioned food-related works by seven contemporary artists. Miralda, a
Catalonian artist based in Miami, filled 11 refrigerated soda cases with
found objects as part of his continuing project "Food Culture Museum."</TE>
<TE>   In a Nov. 25 review, Times critic Suzanne Muchnic wrote: "Grouped
according to themes, the collection of kitsch and bric-a-brac presents
everything from a giant red plastic light-up tongue and a batch of
chamber pots to statuary portraying eating and drinking rituals in
various cultures."</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the Catholic League has launched campaigns against
"anti-religious" exhibits at the Brooklyn Museum of Art gallery,
including a portrait of the Virgin Mary smeared in elephant dung and an
interpretation of a famous Leonardo da Vinci painting showing a
near-naked African woman in place of the Christ figure. The work was
called "Yo Mama's Last Supper," Scully said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the group did not plan to picket the Napa museum. "But we want
to shine the light of truth on this incredible misuse of taxpayer
dollars," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Activists plan to contact museum trustees, including wine and art
luminaries. "We're going to ask these folks if they're aware of this part
of the exhibit. And do they approve of it," Scully said.</TE>
<TE>   And they plan to send another missive to their members.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure the good people of California will be better informed on how
to spend their entertainment money," Scully said. "Especially if they're
Catholic, they may want to go to a different museum or maybe a ballgame.
For the Copia, this is an inauspicious start."</TE>

<HD>Families of Murder Victims Make Appeal for Information</HD>
<DH>Crime: The private pain of unsolved homicides becomes public during
a news conference at LAPD's 77th Street Division.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They stack up at the LAPD's 77th Street station: unsolved homicides
with few leads and, all too often, witnesses who won't come forward.</LD>
<LD>   So, along with bereaved families, detectives Friday made a public
appeal for information on six unsolved murder cases from the last 14
months.</LD>
<LD>   The result was a strangely arresting moment in one of the city's
busiest police precincts--the scene of 85 homicides last year alone.</LD>
<TE>   For a few minutes, as television cameras rolled at a 77th Street
Division news conference, tragedies that can seem routine became anything
but.</TE>
<TE>   The division's weary parade of homicide statistics parted to reveal
the human pain beneath: The mother weeping so hard over her son's death
14 months ago that she could barely tell reporters her name. The father
who struggled for words to describe his grief, ending by saying simply:
"Pray for us."</TE>
<TE>   At first, many of the family members seemed hesitant to take the
podium. But one by one, taking cues from one another, they stepped
forward to show a glimpse of their private torment.</TE>
<TE>'They Have Taken Everything From Me'</TE>
<TE>   They talked about grief and they talked about God, and they talked
about the crimes that had changed their lives--crimes that had, in all
six cases, faded from the news or failed to make the news at all. Most of
all, they begged for help from potential witnesses, anyone, who might
have seen something.</TE>
<TE>   "It's outrageous to take my heart out as if it was nothing," said
Brian Montgomery, referring to the fatal shooting of his 24-year-old
daughter, Sandy Zelada, at Southwest Drive and Van Ness Avenue at 2:15
a.m. last Feb. 25. "They have taken everything from me."</TE>
<TE>   Family members took turns speaking. Members of the community sat
behind them. Detectives lined the walls.</TE>
<TE>   Most of them seemed to be addressing someone outside the room. Their
neighbors, the public, anyone willing to take an interest.</TE>
<TE>   Carlton Mitchell was dressed in an immaculate suit, as if for a
funeral.</TE>
<TE>   He tried to describe the death of his brother, Paul Mitchell, 44, at
7106 S. Western Ave. on Nov. 22, 2000, but broke off at one point. "He
was just shot," he finally murmured, after a pause.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis Wright quietly asked those present to "bear with me" a moment
after he stood up.</TE>
<TE>   Wright's 16-year-old son, Lewis Wright Jr., was gunned down with a
friend, Donte Briggs, at 63rd Street and Victoria Avenue at 1:05 a.m. on
Oct. 13, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone was silent while Wright stood staring at the floor for at
least 20 seconds, his face shielded by his baseball cap. Finally he took
a sharp breath, raised his head and resumed speaking.</TE>
<TE>   "Those of you who have never experienced pain like this--the
nightmares, the tears. . . . Words are inadequate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Often, family members began with seemingly well-prepared and
straightforward appeals for witnesses, but ended talking off the cuff.</TE>
<TE>   They lamented children killing each other, and offered isolated
details of their loved one's life, or death.</TE>
<TE>Killed While Talking to a Friend</TE>
<TE>   The last to stand was Jerome Wilson, whose daughter, Jhana Leah
Wilson, 20, was killed at 5423 2nd Avenue at 10:44 p.m. on July 16.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, a tall man, stood with a hand deep in his pocket. "I don't
have a lot to say about it," he began, shifting his weight. "It's real
tough to come out here."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson started to methodically describe Jhana's death: She was outside
talking to a friend. Someone came up and demanded to know the friend's
"set."</TE>
<TE>   When the friend said he wasn't in a gang, the suspect opened fire.
"The bullet went through my daughter's side," Wilson explained slowly.
"In one side. Out the other."</TE>
<TE>   He stopped, pushed up his glasses, rubbed his eyes and began again.</TE>
<TE>   "Like I said. It's hard," he said. "You can bury them, have a funeral,
friends come by. But you don't get any closure."</TE>
<TE>   Police said they are also looking for information related to cases
involving the deaths of Tamile Cooper, 19, in the 5200 block of Wilton
Place at 8 p.m. July 7; and of Frederick "Red Boy" Pettaway, 42, and
Willie Henry Williams Jr., 42, in the 5200 block of South Gramercy Place
at 8:25 p.m. July 9.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. James Bower said that in all six cases, detectives are looking
for enough information to make an arrest--the description of a car or
suspect.</TE>
<TE>   People who provide such information don't always have to testify in
court, he emphasized.</TE>
<TE>   Last year there were 579 homicides throughout Los Angeles. The LAPD
routinely appeals for public help with difficult cases.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bower said he was overwhelmed watching the families Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "It was unreal," he said. "You go from one crime scene after another
after another and it becomes very businesslike. But when you see the
family members. . . . You know, I walk away from a homicide that day. It
stays with them all their lives."</TE>

<HD>Bail Denied for JDL Bomb Plot Suspect</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge cites an FBI affidavit on Earl Krugel's alleged role
in plans to blow up a mosque and a congressman's office.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal magistrate denied bail Friday for Earl Krugel, one of two
Jewish Defense League leaders arrested last month on charges of plotting
to blow up a mosque in Culver City and an office of Rep. Darrell E. Issa
(R-Vista).</LD>
<LD>   Judge Victor B. Kenton dismissed defense arguments that Krugel, the
JDL's West Coast coordinator, posed no danger to the community.</LD>
<LD>   Kenton ordered the 59-year-old dental hygienist returned to the
federal Metropolitan Detention Center, where he and JDL Chairman Irv
Rubin, a co-defendant, are being held in solitary confinement.</LD>
<TE>   Rubin was previously denied bail as a flight risk and a potential
danger to the public.</TE>
<TE>   The next development in the case will be indictments against the pair
by a federal grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   At the hearing attended by about a dozen of Krugel's relatives and
friends, defense lawyer Mark Werksman asked that his client be freed on
$150,000 of secured bail and placed on electronic monitoring while he
prepares for trial.</TE>
<TE>   He said Krugel has no prior felony convictions and only "a minor rap
sheet" for protest activities that occurred more than 20 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   As for the alleged bombing plot, Werksman said that Krugel was
"canoodled, cajoled and enticed" by an FBI informant within the JDL who
"conceived the idea, directed the planning and propelled it forward."</TE>
<TE>   Citing an FBI case agent's affidavit, however, Kenton said that Krugel
appeared to have played an active role in the plot.</TE>
<TE>   "I counted at least 10 planning meetings that allegedly took place at
Mr. Krugel's home," said the judge.</TE>
<TE>   Kenton also noted that the FBI claims to have a tape recording of
Krugel admitting he was involved in other bombing attempts.</TE>
<TE>   According to the affidavit, a JDL member contacted the FBI in October
saying he had been asked by Rubin and Krugel to take part in attacks on
local Arab institutions. He became a cooperating witness and agreed to
wear a concealed tape recorder.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Rubin selected the two targets: the King Fahd Mosque
in Culver City and the San Clemente offices of Issa, who is of Lebanese
descent.</TE>
<TE>   Krugel and Rubin were arrested Dec. 11 after the informant dropped off
five pounds of explosive powder at Krugel's home in Reseda.</TE>
<TE>   Both are being held on charges of conspiring to blow up a building,
which carries a maximum five-year sentence, and possession of a
destructive device related to a crime of violence, which carries a
mandatory 30-year sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Though denying bail for Krugel, Kenton agreed to talk to the warden at
the detention center about permitting the two defendants and their
lawyers to meet together to discuss the case.</TE>
<TE>   Werksman complained that Rubin and Krugel are currently barred from
having any contact with each other for security reasons.</TE>

<HD>Five Employees Sue Glendale Police Dept.</HD>
<DH>Lawsuit: The women, including four officers, contend they were
abused after filing complaints. City officials say the allegations were
found to have no merit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five female employees have sued the Glendale Police Department,
alleging sexual assault and harassment, discrimination and emotional
distress.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the city has hired an independent law firm and is
investigating the allegations. Those include rape, fondling, physical
abuse and retaliation after the women filed complaints with the city,
according to the lawsuit filed last month in Los Angeles Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   Some Glendale officials criticized the lawsuit, noting that the city
had investigated several of the allegations, some of which date back to
the early 1990s, and determined they had no merit.</LD>
<TE>   "I have to question why someone is resurrecting these allegations,"
Glendale City Atty. Scott Howard said. "I am confident the truth will
come out. We have a zero-tolerance policy toward workplace harassment. .
. . For now, the allegations are just that."</TE>
<TE>   The women, four sworn officers and a civilian, still work in the
department. Their attorney said the lawsuit stems from years of
inappropriate conduct that the department has failed to correct,
including incidents during the last year.</TE>
<TE>   "These women did not wake up one day and say, 'I'm going to claim
harassment,' " said Bradley Gage, a Woodland Hills attorney. "They've
suffered for years. . . . The city did not correct the matter. The women
could no longer be silent."</TE>
<TE>   Although the lawsuit specifies no dollar amount, Gage said the women
are seeking emotional and punitive damages for hospital and doctor bills,
as well as lost earnings from passed-up promotions and decreased employee
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Gage also said the city should punish the alleged offenders, and the
department should hire more women to make it a more hospitable workplace.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said 9% of Glendale's 235 sworn officers are women.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't feel our ratio compared to other agencies would be out of
whack," said Sgt. Bruce Fox, a spokesman. "We're always trying to recruit
women," but like other police departments, have had trouble in recent
years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Women make up 7% and 10% of the sworn officers in the Burbank and Long
Beach police departments, and in the Los Angeles police and sheriff's
departments, they make up 19% and 15% of the force, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit lists the plaintiffs as Kathryn Frieders, Linda Daidone,
Jamie Franke, Renae Kerner and Carla Haupt. Glendale Police Chief Russell
Siverling deferred questions to the city attorney. "I am saddened by the
nature of the allegations," Siverling said. "We're going to do a thorough
investigation."</TE>

<HD>New 'Alimony' Figure Is Inflated, Secessionists Say</HD>
<DH>Government: City official estimates Valley might owe L.A. $304
million a year to maintain services.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Raising a new obstacle to the secession of the San Fernando Valley,
Los Angeles officials said Friday that a new Valley city might have to
pay $304 million annually in so-called alimony, not the $60 million
estimated earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The latest estimate by City Administrator William Fujioka was
denounced by Valley VOTE President Jeff Brain as "highly inflated" and
characterized as another attempt to complicate the cityhood process.</LD>
<LD>   Some city officials said the new figure could have a big effect on
Valley cityhood, given that the new city is expected to have a budget of
$800 million to $1 billion.</LD>
<TE>   "If the number is that high, it is just another element that makes
secession all that much harder and raises questions about what the Valley
would actually get by seceding," said Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, a
member of the Local Agency Formation Commission, the agency studying
secession.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO estimated last year that Los Angeles gets about $60 million more
from the Valley than it provides there in services. The Valley might have
to pay that amount if it seceded.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Fujioka issued a new report indicating that the Valley pays
only $20 million more for direct services than it gets back.</TE>
<TE>   However, the report said there is an additional $284 million in
centralized services that would still have to be paid for by Los Angeles,
even if the Valley forms its own city.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles still would have to pay to maintain a 911 system, a crime
lab, a police radio system and to keep employees who catalog books at
city libraries.</TE>
<TE>   Those "stranded" costs could be absorbed during a transition in which
Valley leaders have proposed to continue to contract for all services
from Los Angeles. But once the contracts end and the Valley takes over
the services, Los Angeles could be left with $284 million in centralized
costs to pay.</TE>
<TE>   Walter Kieser, a financial consultant for Valley VOTE, said the city
estimate is "unbelievable."</TE>

<LD>A man accused of selling an undercover agent two machine guns on
behalf of former KNBC-TV Channel 4 helicopter pilot Bob Pettee pleaded
guilty Friday to a federal weapons charge.</LD>
<LD>   Jeff Miller, 46, entered his plea to one count of unlawful possession
and / or transfer of a machine gun during an appearance before U.S.
District Judge Lourdes Baird.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office declined to say whether
Miller had agreed testify against Pettee, who is scheduled to go on trial
Jan. 15 on the same charges. The two men are friends. Miller's plea
agreement with prosecutors was sealed. He is to be sentenced March 25.</LD>
<TE>   Acting on behalf of Pettee, prosecutors said, Miller sold a Heckler
and Koch 9-millimeter submachine gun and an MFR .223-caliber automatic
rifle to an undercover agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms for $5,000.</TE>

<HD>Exotic-Sounding Theft May Strike Some as Just Another Song and
Dance</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>STEVE HARVEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some especially bold dance moves? A woman told police she noticed
that $84 was missing "from a purse after four male exotic dancers
performed inside a home," the Long Beach Press-Telegram reported.</LD>
<LD>   Note to Sav-on officials: You might want to do something about the
partly burned-out sign on the store that is visible from the San Diego
Freeway south of Culver Boulevard. For several nights, its sign has read:</LD>
<LD>   on Drugs</LD>
<TE>   Old business: I held off sharing two police log items from 2001 (see
accompanying), hoping that the mysterious thefts would be solved, but I
can't wait any longer. One, sent here by TV weathercaster George
Fischbeck and retired Judge Phillip Petty, among others, involved a
missing body. The second, contributed by Richard Geiger, involved a
burglary that apparently wasn't noticed right away.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of scant clues: Bob Hill noticed a sign above the ramp of an
underground parking area that was apparently designed to keep van drivers
in suspense (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Dumb names (cont.): Peggy Inman of Banning urged me to consider
kitchen devices as well as automobiles, explaining that while "shopping
for a new garbage disposal, my husband and I came across a Waste King
model that we couldn't resist. We are now the proud owners of a 'Gourmet'
garbage disposal."</TE>
<TE>   Back to car names: I guess we've pretty much run out of candidates in
the motor vehicle category, inasmuch as Dave Kase of Palos Verdes Estates
had to reach back to the 1920s to find a nominee--the Model A Ford.</TE>
<TE>   "It replaced, of all things, the Model T," Kase pointed out. "To my
mind, that constitutes a strange progression."</TE>
<TE>   Guess it's too late for a recall.</TE>
<TE>   Aging, Hollywood style: Actress Eileen Heckart, who died the other
day, had one of her most challenging roles as the mother of Paul Newman
in the 1956 boxing movie "Somebody Up There Likes Me."</TE>
<TE>   She was 37, while Newman was 31.</TE>
<TE>   But then Hollywood has many cinematic family trees of a strange sort,
usually intended to emphasize the youthfulness of the male star.</TE>
<TE>   Newman, for instance, was 42 when "Cool Hand Luke" came out in 1967.
Jo Van Fleet, his mom, was 45.</TE>
<TE>   Other cinematic child brides included Sally Field (b. 1946) who was
the mother of Tom Hanks (b. 1956) in "Forrest Gump."</TE>
<TE>   In the "Manchurian Candidate," Angela Lansbury (b. 1925) had a son
(Laurence Harvey) who was actually born in 1928.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about child brides.</TE>
<TE>   Even more ridiculous, 38-year-old Dick Van Dyke was the son of
38-year-old Maureen Stapleton in "Bye Bye Birdie."</TE>
<TE>   In "The Graduate" (1967), "older woman" Anne Bancroft was all of six
years older than 30-year-old Dustin Hoffman, who was supposed to be a
just-graduated college kid.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder Bancroft was so depressed.</TE>
<TE>   Weirdest of all: In "North by Northwest" (1959), Jessie Royce Landis
played Cary Grant's mother, though she was actually 11 months younger
than Grant.</TE>
<TE>   Let's not even consider the implications.</TE>
<TE>miscelLAny:</TE>
<TE>   If your spouse hasn't taken down the Christmas tree yet, keep in mind
that silent screen star Harold Lloyd kept a decorated Christmas tree up
year-round on his Green Acres estate in Beverly Hills.</TE>

<HD>After 68 Years, Money Woes Force Closure of St. Luke Medical Center</HD>
<DH>Health: Pasadena landmark stops taking nonemergency patients and
will close emergency room April 3, leaving city with one hospital.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 68 years, the golden cupola of St. Luke Medical Center has been
a familiar landmark in northeast Pasadena, helping guide people to one of
the two hospitals that bookend the city of 134,000 people.</LD>
<LD>   But in April, St. Luke will close its doors, the latest in a string of
Southern California hospitals that have shut down, merged or been sold in
recent years because of money problems.</LD>
<LD>   St. Luke stopped admitting nonemergency patients Thursday and will
close its emergency room April 3. Huntington Memorial will be Pasadena's
only full-service hospital.</LD>
<TE>   Tenet Healthcare Corp. said St. Luke was in serious financial trouble
long before the company acquired the 165-bed facility in 1997. St. Luke
has 442 full- and part-time employees.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave it a solid effort over the last five years," said Harry
Anderson, Tenet vice president. "We spent money on it, we improved
equipment, but it tended to be an underused facility. We just were not
able to find a way to make it competitive in a market where there are
bigger, more successful hospitals nearby."</TE>
<TE>   Phyllis Bushart, St. Luke's chief executive, said only 70 to 75 beds
have been filled at any given time in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been tough to compete with Huntington and Methodist [Hospital in
nearby Arcadia], which are larger, more well-equipped and [well-]staffed
hospitals," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Five other hospitals, including Huntington and Methodist, are within
an eight-mile radius of St. Luke, with more than 1,700 beds total,
Bushart said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a significant number of facilities available," she said.
"All of the physicians on staff at St. Luke are also on staff at one of
the other hospitals in the area."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Lott, executive vice president of the Healthcare Assn. of Southern
California, a trade group that represents 190 hospitals, including St.
Luke, said he believes the closure will not present a crisis in health
care access.</TE>
<TE>   "Emergency and all other services people need are available nearby,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington and Methodist issued a joint statement saying they will
"assure all members of our community that their respective hospitals will
continue to meet all health care needs."</TE>
<TE>   Some concerns remain, however, that the closure will further burdened
already crowded emergency rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "It means more strain on facilities that are already taxed and
overloaded," said Steve Ralph, chief operating officer of Huntington.</TE>
<TE>   Bushart said St. Luke employees will receive salary and benefits for
at least 60 more days, even if their services are not needed. Although
the hospital will not be admitting nonemergency patients, it will honor
previously scheduled outpatient appointments through April 3.</TE>
<TE>   For Thomas Riley, a family practice physician who has been on staff at
St. Luke since the late 1950s, the closure is a deep loss. Riley's
office, across the street on Washington Boulevard, was chosen for its
proximity to St. Luke.</TE>
<TE>   "I take most of my patients there," he said. "I use it for X-rays and
labs. Some 400 people will be out of jobs, many of them people who have
been there as long as I can remember. They've taken a tremendous load of
patients from this area."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, he cradled in his hands a color postcard of the hospital,
taken years ago, when St. Luke was run by the Sisters of St. Joseph of
Orange. He keeps the postcard in a frame on his office wall.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital has been "an old friend that is gone now," said Riley,
who also has staff privileges at Huntington.</TE>
<TE>   "And I feel very bad about it. I will miss St. Luke."</TE>
<TE>   The closure is part of a shakedown occurring throughout the local
industry. For example, the nonprofit Daniel Freeman Hospitals Inc., with
facilities in Inglewood and Marina del Rey, was sold to Tenet in
December.</TE>
<TE>   "We are seeing the smaller hospitals get lost in this
supply-and-demand battle that is going on. We still have an oversupply of
beds in Los Angeles County and an undersupply of emergency services,"
said Lott of the Healthcare Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "For a small hospital to survive in this market is a real challenge."</TE>

<HD>District Settles Bias Suit by 3 Black Teachers</HD>
<DH>Courts: Plaintiffs will receive a total of $310,000 after alleging
that they were passed over for assignments in favor of less-qualified
candidates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District has resolved a 4-year-old
lawsuit, agreeing to pay more than $310,000 to three African American
teachers who said they faced pervasive discrimination at South Gate
Middle School.</LD>
<LD>   The teachers alleged that they had been passed over for desirable
assignments in favor of less-qualified candidates at the predominantly
Latino campus. They said they had faced racial slurs from students and
others, and had received unwarranted discipline.</LD>
<LD>   The lead plaintiff in the case, Emily F. Gibson, welcomed the
conclusion of the legal saga, but said the victory rang hollow.</LD>
<TE>   "The money was never the issue. It was the principle that mattered,"
said Gibson, 61, who still teaches at the school. "African American
teachers and students have continually received disparate treatment at
South Gate Middle School and across the district."</TE>
<TE>   Gibson and her two colleagues sued the school district in 1997.
District officials said they investigated the complaints but found no
evidence of racism on campus.</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles Superior Court jury sided with the three teachers in
1999, awarding them more than $242,000.</TE>
<TE>   The district appealed the jury verdict. Last July, the state Court of
Appeal upheld the lower court decision, saying "the record is replete
with evidence demonstrating harassment, retaliation and [a] hostile
environment" at South Gate Middle School.</TE>
<TE>   District officials decided against taking the case to the state
Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "The likelihood of success on appeal wasn't great, given the Court of
Appeal opinion," said Hal Kwalwasser, the district's general counsel.
"The consensus was that it didn't seem like we were going to get
anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Gibson will receive more than $127,000 under the judgment. Plaintiff
Frances Copeland, who now teaches at Edison Middle School in South Los
Angeles, will get more than $124,000.</TE>
<TE>   The third teacher, retiree Levell Smith, will receive nearly $59,000.
The awards include thousands of dollars in accrued interest.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney B. Kwaku Duren will receive $86,300 in fees.</TE>

<HD>Fire Guts Ventura Seniors Complex</HD>
<DH>Emergency: Officials say arson may have been the cause. The
apartments were to open in March.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 76-unit senior apartment complex that was expected to open in
Ventura in March was destroyed by a fast-moving fire early Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators from the Ventura city and county fire departments said
the cause of the fire was under investigation, but that it may have been
arson.</LD>
<LD>   "We're considering it suspicious because the building was under
construction," said Brian Clark, a deputy fire marshal for the Ventura
Fire Department. "It was a cool night, and there were no wires down and
it was a fast-moving fire."</LD>
<TE>   Clark said the blaze began about 3:50 a.m. and quickly engulfed the
three-acre complex just off Cypress Point Lane, near the county
Government Center. He said the building was about 75% complete and
encompassed more than 54,000 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   The estimated loss was nearly $3 million, said Clark, who said that 60
firefighters from Ventura and Oxnard as well as Ventura County battled
the blaze. There were no injuries, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters from the Los Angeles Fire Department were called to join
the investigation Friday, using dogs trained in detecting flammable
substances. Investigators were concentrating on a front section of the
complex closest to a neighboring apartment building.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses living in that building said the complex, which was loaded
down with stacks of wood pallets, drywall and other combustible
construction materials, crackled loudly and exploded.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze spread so fast, according to some witnesses, that many who
were jolted from their beds barely smelled smoke before seeing giant
orange flames leaping into the air. Firefighters responding from Oxnard
said flames were visible before they got to the Ventura city limits.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it was a gun battle because it all sounded like
machine-gun fire," said Laurie Lemson, who lives in an apartment complex
separated from the fire by a 6-foot-high brick wall. "People were rushing
out of here with their animals. It was like nothing I have ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   Several embers floated onto Lemson's complex and ignited small fires
on the shake roof, but they were quickly doused by firefighters.
Officials began evacuating residents of the apartment building but
stopped when the small fires were put out, Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   Four hours after the fire started, most of the flames were out, but
firefighters on extended ladders continued to pour water on the charred
structure.</TE>
<TE>   Stunned workers and officials from the Lancaster-based construction
company heading up the project talked with firefighters as insurance
adjusters and agents waited nearby.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sad thing," Oxnard electrician Richard Marquez said. "It's
hard for me, especially with bills to pay and a kid on the way."</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the construction company, Atkinson &amp; Associates, said
that at least 45 people have been working at the site everyday since work
began last summer.</TE>
<TE>   The complex is operated by Sunrise Assisted Living, a McLean, Va.,
company that has built about 190 such facilities in the United States and
abroad, said Dwight Spargur, executive director of the Ventura complex.</TE>
<TE>   The units were to rent for $1,700 to $3,900 per month. The facility
would include full medical care.</TE>
<TE>   Spargur said the senior living complex was set to open March 15. An
open house was scheduled for the facility this weekend, with tours of the
completed sections. As of Friday, nine units had been rented, Spargur
said.</TE>
<TE>   Six people had been hired to work at the facility, and Spargur had
expected another 40 to be hired by the opening.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a number of applications on file, but it's all on hold until
we know the next step, and right now it's too early to tell," Spargur
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said people that have signed up to rent apartments in the senior
complex will be placed in similar facilities in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   The burned building was part of a six-acre development under
construction next to the Vons supermarket at the intersection of Victoria
Avenue and Telephone Road.</TE>
<TE>   The senior complex was the first phase of the development, which will
eventually include several restaurants and a day-care center, said Ben
Lingo, a Westlake resident and one of the investors in the property.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Rocketdyne Worker Describes Fatal 1994 Blast</HD>
<DH>Trial: His testimony is the first by an eyewitness in explosion
that killed two at lab near Chatsworth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A retired Rocketdyne mechanic testified Friday that he and four
others were disposing of waste materials at the Santa Susana Field
Laboratory near Chatsworth in 1994 when an explosion killed two veteran
scientists.</LD>
<LD>   Lee Wells, 70, of Newbury Park said he watched chemical engineer Otto
K. Heiney pour a liquid into an aluminum box as he prepared to burn the
chemical mixture at a secluded outdoor test site.</LD>
<LD>   "I assumed we were burning waste," Wells testified, comparing the
process used on July 21 and 26, 1994, to that once used to legally
dispose of leftover chemicals at the company's old burn pit.</LD>
<TE>   As Heiney poured the chemicals for what would have been the third burn
of the day, the blast occurred, Wells said.</TE>
<TE>   Wells is the first eyewitness to testify in the trial of two former
Rocketdyne employees charged with federal environmental crimes. The trial
is being held in U.S. District Court in Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so loud I didn't hear anything," Wells testified. "I felt the
blast and I looked down and my shirt was coming apart."</TE>
<TE>   When he realized what had occurred, Wells said, "I felt to see if I
was all there . . . I knew I was burned but I didn't know how bad."</TE>
<TE>   The July 26 blast killed Heiney, 53, of Canoga Park, and physicist
Larry A. Pugh, 51, of Thousand Oaks. Wells suffered second- and
third-degree burns to his face, arms and stomach.</TE>
<TE>   On trial are Joseph E. Flanagan, 61, of Stanwood, Wash., and Edgar R.
Wilson, 65, of Chatsworth, each charged with two felony counts of
illegally disposing of chemical waste. Flanagan also is charged with one
count of illegally storing the materials. Each count carries a maximum of
five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   As director of Rocketdyne's Chemical Technology Group, Flanagan
supervised the men involved in the burns, but was not present at the
explosion. Wilson was a low-level technician in charge of igniting the
burns.</TE>
<TE>   The burns were conducted by Heiney, Pugh, Wilson, Wells and James F.
Weber, the group's hazardous waste coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Weber, 51, of Moorpark, also was charged with three felonies in the
case, but pleaded guilty in August to one misdemeanor count. He is
expected to testify later for the defense.</TE>
<TE>   Rocketdyne's then-parent company, Rockwell International Corp., also
pleaded guilty in 1996 to three felony counts of mishandling hazardous
chemicals in the same incident and paid a $6.5-million fine. The same
year, Rocketdyne was sold to the Boeing Co..</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan and Wilson deny the men were illegally disposing of waste on
those two July days, as the government has alleged. Defense attorneys
contend Heiney and Pugh were conducting legitimate scientific experiments
when the blast occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson's lawyer, Leonard Sharenow, said his client did not question
his supervisors about the field work assigned to him.</TE>
<TE>   Neither did Wells, who was granted prosecutorial immunity. Wells
testified for the prosecution that, unlike in most scientific tests,
neither Heiney nor any of the others had measured the amount of chemicals
to be burned or took notes or photographs of the procedures used and
results achieved.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed whatever [Heiney] came across, he put in" the box for
burning, Wells testified. "Everything seemed random to me."</TE>
<TE>   When questioned by Assistant U.S. Atty. William Carter, Wells said he
never saw a written procedure for the work.</TE>
<TE>   Wells said he told Bert Moy, a former colleague, the fatal blast
occurred during a "bucket test," a phrase he used to refer to the illegal
disposal of waste materials through burning.</TE>
<TE>   Wells said he recognized the liquid Heiney was pouring before the
blast as a propellent commonly used at the field laboratory, but did not
know what other materials were burned during those two days.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Huntington Beach police officer who shot and killed a man
allegedly holding a toy rifle last May won't face criminal charges,
prosecutors said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting death of 18-year-old Antonio Saldivar, a farm worker whom
the officer apparently mistook for a crime suspect he was searching for,
prompted protests by Latino activists.</LD>
<LD>   But prosecutors concluded that Officer Mark Wersching reacted
reasonably when he shot Saldivar, who reportedly turned toward the
officer with the toy gun in his hands.</LD>
<TE>   "The officer's instantaneous decision to defend his life from an
apparent deadly threat was reasonable," Deputy Dist. Atty. Carolyn
Carlisle-Raines said in a statement.</TE>

<HD>Boy, 12, Charged in O.C. Blaze</HD>
<DH>Arson: Officials hope he will return voluntarily from Texas to face
trial in $4-million fire.</DH>

<LD>A 12-year-old Texas boy was charged Friday with setting a brush
fire that tore through Trafalgar Canyon in San Clemente in August,
destroying six homes and causing more than $4 million in property damage.</LD>
<LD>   The boy was spending the summer with a family in San Clemente and
"wanted to see what a big fire would look like," said Tori Richards, a
spokeswoman for the Orange County district attorney's office. He
allegedly tossed burning matches into dry brush at the bottom of the
coastal canyon near the San Clemente Pier, prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   Two brothers with whom the suspect was staying witnessed the fire but
have not been charged, officials said. The brothers tried to snuff out
the fire, but the 12-year-old held them back, authorities allege.</LD>
<TE>   The four-month investigation by the Orange County Fire Authority was
complicated by reluctant witnesses and lengthy negotiations with the
suspect's family and lawyer, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Investigators had a good idea initially who did this, but they still
had to do a lot of work," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Joe Williams. "There
was a lot of reluctance on the part of a lot of people to come forward.
Also, when you're dealing with a minor, there's a presumption that they
don't know right from wrong. The investigators had to prove that he knew
he was doing something wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors did not identify any of they boys involved because they
are minors. John Barnett, the suspect's lawyer, declined to comment
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The boy remains with his parents in El Paso. Prosecutors say they hope
the family will bring him to Orange County voluntarily, where he would be
tried in Juvenile Court on three counts of arson to an inhabited
structure and one count of arson to a forest. If the boy's family refuses
to bring him to California, prosecutors will try to extradite him,
Richards said.</TE>
<TE>   At the site of the fire Friday, residents and victims expressed relief
that charges had been filed but also sympathy for the suspect. Neighbors
said the boy and the two brothers were often seen skateboarding and
fooling around.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a terrible burden for a 12-year-old; it's real sad," said
Barbara Sullivan. She and her husband, Richard, lost their home and live
in a rental unit a mile away. They are trying to rebuild their gutted
condo.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not mad at him," she said. "I feel bad for him. . . . It's a hard
lesson for this child."</TE>
<TE>   The fire broke out Aug. 1 at 3:20 p.m. as the boys played along the
canyon. The suspect, prosecutors allege, prevented his friends from
stopping the blaze because he wanted to see how large it would grow. When
it got out of control, the boy allegedly told a nearby lifeguard about it
and ran.</TE>
<TE>   Fueled by ocean breezes and heavy coastal sage, the fire raced up a
steep, quarter-mile slope and engulfed a million-dollar condominium
complex on Cazador Lane. It jumped to a second complex and destroyed more
units.</TE>
<TE>   No one was injured, but dozens of residents were evacuated as more
than 100 firefighters battled the blaze. Several witnesses reported
seeing two or three teenagers running from the area near the beach where
the fire broke out.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office said it will seek restitution for the
victims from the boy's parents.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of the neighborhood said the boys were a fixture of the
summer scene and were known for their mischievousness.</TE>
<TE>   "They were bright boys," said Gayle Pentoney, who lives next door to
several condos that were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Pentoney said the boys figured out how to open a security
gate from the outside, which allowed them access to a hot tub in one
condominium complex.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids disappeared right after the fire, and soon after their
parents were gone too," Pentoney said. "That raised suspicion."</TE>
<TE>   Today, all that remains of some homes are scorched foundations.</TE>

<HD>Quarantined Cat Freed Under House Arrest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frisky the cat, quarantined since last month after a brush with a
coyote and at one point facing a death sentence, went home Friday, but
will be under house arrest for three months.</LD>
<LD>   "Hi, sweetie!" owner Twyla Henson said as she left Orange County
Animal Care Services in Orange with the cat.</LD>
<LD>   Frisky, who lives with the Henson family in Fullerton, was cornered by
a coyote on a neighbor's porch Sept. 22. Though the family said the pet
was not bitten, they alerted county animal control officials about the
encounter, just in case the coyote was rabid.</LD>
<TE>   The Hensons say they were told to keep the cat indoors for 10 days.
Animal control authorities say the rabies quarantine period is six
months, and that one of their officers found a puncture wound on the
cat's hip.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 23, an animal control officer spotted Frisky outdoors and
reminded the Hensons about the quarantine rules.</TE>
<TE>   When the cat was outside again the next day, she was picked up and
taken to the pound. The Hensons then faced the choice of paying the
county $1,100 to board the cat until the quarantine period ends March 22
or have Frisky euthanized.</TE>
<TE>   To get the cat back, Henson signed a contract agreeing to keep Frisky
indoors and allow surprise visits by an animal probation officer of
sorts.</TE>
<TE>   Henson said she thinks the county released the cat only because of a
public outcry after The Times published a story Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Francis said the supervised release was always an option, which the
Hensons would have known if they had called her instead of the news
media.</TE>
<TE>   She also said that if the cat should develop rabies and bite somebody,
critics would lambaste the agency for being too lax.</TE>

<LD>A lawyer for Anna Nicole Smith on Friday described the ex-Playboy
playmate's stepson as the person who decided she would not receive any of
his oil tycoon father's inheritance.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Philip Boesch challenged Pierce Marshall's earlier testimony
that his father made his own financial decisions and that he just helped
with the details.</LD>
<LD>   It was Marshall's third day of cross-examination in U.S. District
Court in Santa Ana. J. Howard Marshall II's son is appealing a previous
decision to award Smith, his father's widow, more than $400 million of
the estate.</LD>

<HD>Jones Offers Proposal to Close State Budget Gap</HD>
<DH>Politics: The GOP gubernatorial candidate calls for spending cuts,
accuses Davis of mismanagement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Jones laid out a plan
Friday to close the projected $12-billion state budget gap without
raising taxes, but offered few specifics on his proposed spending cuts.</LD>
<LD>   Jones, California secretary of state, accused Democratic Gov. Gray
Davis of driving California into fiscal crisis with his "reckless"
mismanagement of the state. During his three years as governor, Jones
said, Davis has increased spending by 36% and bloated the state payroll
with more than 34,000 new jobs.</LD>
<LD>   "Is your government 36% better off today than it was three years ago?"
Jones asked in a breakfast speech to local Republicans. "I think most
people would say no."</LD>
<TE>   Davis, who will propose a new state budget Thursday, has faced similar
attacks from former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and businessman
Bill Simon Jr., the other contenders in the March 5 GOP primary.</TE>
<TE>   The budget shortfall--California's worst since the recession of the
early 1990s--has the Republican candidates appealing to GOP primary
voters by sounding a theme of conservative fiscal management.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Jones said his plan would save $5 billion over the next
six months and $8 billion the following year. In what his campaign billed
as a "major policy address," he said it was "time to stop ducking and
dodging" the state's tough budget issues.</TE>
<TE>   "The time to stand up and show courage is here," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   At the top of Jones' list of trims: parts of the $3 billion in
spending cuts and other measures that Davis already has proposed to
lessen the budget shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Jones declined to say which of the Davis cuts he supports and
which ones he opposes. Among the proposed Davis cuts are $1.2 billion in
spending for education, a perennially tough area to cut in an election
year.</TE>
<TE>   "We will go through each and every one of the items as the Legislature
reviews them, and we will put forward an outline of specifics," Jones
told reporters after his speech.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Salazar, a spokesman for the Davis reelection campaign, said
Jones had "abandoned any semblance of reality in his quest to boost his
flailing campaign."</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy for somebody to put out a wish list if they have no
accountability for what's going to take place," he said. "The fact of the
matter is Gov. Davis has practiced sound fiscal management throughout his
tenure as governor."</TE>
<TE>   Jones also proposed spending cuts to be chosen from a $1.4-billion
list of options suggested by state Legislative Analyst Elizabeth G. Hill.
She proposed cuts in agriculture, education, crime prevention, housing
and other programs.</TE>
<TE>   Again, Jones did not say which ones he would choose.</TE>
<TE>   Jones also said he would freeze spending this year on programs funded
by Propositions 10 and 99. Among those affected would be anti-tobacco
advertisements and early childhood mental health programs, said Sean
Walsh, Jones' deputy campaign manager.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the budget, Jones proposed an economic stimulus package to
create jobs and improve California's business climate. It would expand
business tax credits, fund infrastructure improvements with new debt, cut
"job-killing" regulations that hamstring business and reform the workers'
compensation system.</TE>
<TE>   Jones proposed a cut in the capital gains tax, but would not say by
how much or when it should take effect. "We'll leave that up to the
Legislature," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who has proposed similar steps to lift California's economy,
said he applauded Jones' plan. Simon also renewed his own attack on
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "So far Davis has refused to lead," Simon said in a statement released
by his campaign. "Instead he has allowed fellow Democrats to propose huge
tax increases and wishful accounting maneuvers to prolong their spending
habits."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, state Senate leader John L. Burton proposed a
$2.5-billion annual income tax increase on the wealthiest Californians,
and state Treasurer Phil Angelides offered a debt-refinancing plan to
save $1 billion. Both are Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has said through aides that he will focus on cutting back the
budget, rather than raising taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "Just as in the energy crisis, several competing ideas have filled the
leadership vacuum," Simon said. "Californians just don't have confidence
that anyone is in charge."</TE>

<HD>Port Official Resigns Amid Criticism</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO
</DL>
<LD>A member of the San Diego Port Commission resigned Friday after he
was criticized for working as a consultant to an energy company while
serving on a board that oversees the firm's contract to manage a power
plant.</LD>
<LD>   David Malcolm said in his resignation letter that he could no longer
serve effectively given what he called the "unfair and untrue"
accusations of a conflict of interest.</LD>
<LD>   The Port Commission manages San Diego Harbor, San Diego International
Airport and the surrounding land. Its seven members represent five
cities.</LD>
<TE>   Duke Energy has a contract with the commission to operate the South
Bay Power Plant on port-controlled property.</TE>
<TE>   Malcolm, who was appointed in 1995 by the Chula Vista City Council,
received $20,000 a month in consulting fees from Duke between May 2000
and April 2001.</TE>
<TE>   He abstained from voting on any issues related to Duke or the power
plant, but critics of the company's contract called on Malcolm to resign.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter, Malcolm insisted that he did not break any laws. Port
attorney David Chapman previously concluded that Malcolm's actions were
not illegal, because he abstained from votes and discussions regarding
Duke after becoming a consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Chula Vista Councilman Stephen Padilla said Malcolm had lost the trust
of those he represented.</TE>
<TE>   "This was an exercise in poor judgment," Padilla said. "This thing was
going to become a political issue that did not serve the city well."</TE>

<HD>Watchdog Panel Urges Fines for Water Officials</HD>
<DH>Power: Four could be sanctioned for failing to have energy
consultants file conflict-of-interest statements in timely way.</DH>

<LD>Four top officials in the California Department of Water Resources,
including Director Tom Hannigan, face fines totaling $100,000 for
allegedly failing to have energy consultants submit personal
conflict-of-interest statements in a timely manner, state officials said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The officials have been formally notified that investigators for the
Fair Political Practices Commission are poised to propose fines against
Hannigan, Deputy Director Ray Hart, former General Counsel Susan Weber
and Personnel Director Greg Rowsey, sources said. Any fines would have to
be approved by the five-member appointed commission.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation stems from the water department's emergency role as
electricity purchaser for 27 million Californians served by three
financially stressed utilities. The department was thrust into the role
last January by Gov. Gray Davis after power sellers refused to supply the
utilities and the state was threatened with blackouts.</LD>
<TE>   The department rapidly hired dozens of consultants to buy electricity,
advise the governor and negotiate long-term power contracts. Months
later, it was revealed that several of those power traders owned stock in
companies with which they did business on behalf of the state.</TE>
<TE>   One consultant, Vikram Budhraja of the Electric Power Group, had
worked for Williams Cos.--one of the energy marketers with which Budhraja
helped negotiate a contract for the water department.</TE>
<TE>   State law prohibits employees and contractors from participating in
decisions involving their personal financial interests. It also requires
many employees and consultants to submit forms annually in which they
disclose stock ownership and sources of income.</TE>
<TE>   The water department did not require the dozens of consultants it
hired in January to submit such forms until July. Republican
gubernatorial candidate Bill Jones charged that the forms showed
potential conflicts of interest, and he asked for an investigation by the
attorney general. That investigation continues.</TE>
<TE>   In late July, Davis officials disclosed that they had fired five
consultants for potential conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Jones said he was shocked to hear that blame was being
placed on bureaucrats for the failure to file disclosure forms when the
governor's office was taking a direct role in the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "It just strikes me as an effort to try to eliminate any tie to the
governor's office and to hinder the investigation from going further to
the governor's office," Jones said. He described Hannigan as "an
honorable man who has always sought to do a good job."</TE>
<TE>   Water department officials could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the FPPC's
confidentiality rules, said investigators will ask for fines against the
top water department executives on the grounds that their failure to
require consultants to make immediate disclosures of any potential
conflicts of interest violated state law.</TE>
<TE>   There is legal uncertainty about which consultants must file such
disclosure forms. For example, the Davis administration never required
two of its top energy advisors--Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman--to
submit the forms, arguing that they fall into a category of consultant
beyond the reach of the state's political reform laws.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to know why no one in the governor's office is included in
this proposed action," Jones said.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: (3 photos) Bay Bridge Worker Crushed--Bridge painter Darryl
Clemons, 33, below left, was killed Friday on the San Francisco-Oakland
Bay Bridge when an 18,000-pound rolling work platform, below right, known
as a "traveler," buckled as it was being moved, crushing him against the
upper deck. Robison-Prezioso, the company he worked for, has been fined
$194,335 in the past year for accidents and violations on the project,
KTVU-TV in San Francisco reported, and has had 37 violations nationwide
since 1986, the station said. Clemons' father, James, above with wife
Blanche, works for the company and was seriously injured on the job last
year when he fell 90 feet from scaffolding.</CP>

<LD>The couple whose two huge Presa Canario dogs mauled a San Francisco
woman to death in her apartment hallway are asking for separate trials,
saying that neither wants to be dragged down by the other's conduct and
comments.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel asked in court filings
that their cases be separated, a change that could delay jury selection
set for later this month.</LD>
<LD>   The trial has been moved to Los Angeles due to pretrial publicity.</LD>
<TE>   The dogs killed Diane Whipple last Jan. 26 as the lacrosse coach stood
at her apartment door. Knoller and Noel face charges of involuntary
manslaughter and keeping vicious dogs. Knoller, who was with the dogs
during the attack, also is charged with second-degree murder.</TE>

<HD>David Swift, 82; Director, Scriptwriter in TV, Film</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Swift, a writer-director-producer who created Wally Cox's
popular "Mr. Peepers" television series in the early 1950s and made his
debut as a movie director in 1960 guiding a young Hayley Mills in
"Pollyanna," has died. He was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Swift, whose career included stints as an animator at Walt Disney
Studios and writing comedy for radio, died of heart failure Monday at St.
John's Health Center in Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   Swift wrote and directed "Pollyanna" (for which the 14-year-old Mills
received a special Oscar) and Mills' next Disney hit, "The Parent Trap,"
in 1961.</LD>
<TE>   "He was a very big influence in my life," Mills told The Times this
week. "I think they were the two best movies I did for Disney. He was
always relaxed and patient and gentle and sweet. It was extremely
fortunate for me that he was in charge of those two films."</TE>
<TE>   Swift scripted and directed a number of other popular films in the
1960s, including "The Interns," starring Cliff Robertson, "Love Is a
Ball," starring Glenn Ford, "Under the Yum-Yum Tree" and "Good Neighbor
Sam," both starring Jack Lemmon, and "How to Succeed in Business Without
Really Trying," starring Robert Morse.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in 1948, Swift worked extensively in television as a writer
and director.</TE>
<TE>   In association with producer Fred Coe, he created "Mr. Peepers"
specifically for Wally Cox after seeing him in a "Philco Television
Playhouse" drama. The NBC show, in which the low-key actor played a
mild-mannered science teacher named Robinson J. Peepers, was broadcast
live from New York from 1952 to 1955.</TE>
<TE>   Among the handful of other TV series Swift created are "Grindl," a
1963 NBC comedy starring Imogene Coca; "Camp Runamuck," a 1965 comedy;
and "Arnie," a 1970 comedy starring Herschel Bernardi, which ran for two
years.</TE>
<TE>   Swift was born in 1919 in Minneapolis, where his father owned a
company that made sausage casings. When the Depression hit, his family
lost all of its money. Swift, who was always drawing, dropped out of
school at 15 and rode freight cars to California with the goal of working
for Walt Disney.</TE>
<TE>   Once he arrived in Los Angeles, he worked a variety of odd jobs,
including ushering at the Warner Bros. movie theater on Hollywood
Boulevard. He began attending art school and going to night school at
Hollywood High to learn to type.</TE>
<TE>   Initially hired at the Walt Disney Studio as a $15-a-week traffic boy,
he became a $20-a-week assistant animator in 1938. By 1942, he had been
promoted to animator and worked on such Disney classics as "Dumbo,"
"Fantasia," "Peter Pan," "Pinocchio" and "Snow White."</TE>
<TE>   "His career with Disney was unique because there were two distinct
phases," said film historian Leonard Maltin, author of "The Disney
Films."</TE>
<TE>   "In the early portion of his career in the '30s, he aspired to be an
animator and worked with some of the best. Then he left in the '40s and
went on and carved a whole different kind of career and wound up back at
Disney, writing and directing two of the best-loved live-action films in
the studio's history."</TE>
<TE>   After flying bomber missions over Germany during World War II as an
Air Force pilot, Swift began working as a radio comedy writer for Bing
Crosby, Jimmy Durante, Bob Hope, Red Skelton, Danny Thomas and others.</TE>
<TE>   In 1948, he became a dramatist, writing original teleplays for
"Hallmark Hall of Fame," "Kraft Theater," "Philco Television Playhouse,"
"Playhouse 90" and "Studio One." He later wrote and directed episodes of
series such as "The Rifleman" and "Wagon Train."</TE>
<TE>   After launching "Mr. Peepers," Swift had mild luck with another
situation comedy series, "Jamie," starring Brandon de Wilde. Throughout
the 1970s, he directed such shows as "Barney Miller," "Eight Is Enough"
and "The Love Boat." His last television directing assignment was in
1997, but his family said he never stopped writing.</TE>
<TE>   In July, Swift flew to London for a reunion with Mills to record the
commentary tracks for the upcoming DVD releases of "Pollyanna" and "The
Parent Trap."</TE>
<TE>   "It was just so lovely to rediscover somebody that I was very, very
fond of and who I always looked upon as an old friend," Mills said. Swift
was a member of the board of directors of the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 44 years, former model Micheline Swift;
two daughters, Michele Chodos and Wendon Swift, both of Los Angeles; and
two grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial services will be private.</TE>

<HD>Miklos 'Miki' Dora, 67; Rebel Surfer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He was known as "the King of Malibu," "Da Cat" and the "angry young
man of surfing."</LD>
<LD>   Miklos "Miki" Dora, an expatriate Southern California surfing legend
whose graceful surfing style rivaled his reputation as a rebel, has died.
He was 67.</LD>
<LD>   Dora, who left California in the early 1970s and spent most of the
next three decades living in South Africa and France, died of pancreatic
cancer Thursday at his father's home in Montecito.</LD>
<TE>   Dora, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer in July, had moved into
his father's house a couple of months ago after leaving his home in
Guethary, a European surfing mecca on France's Atlantic coast.</TE>
<TE>   Described by friends as smart, witty and iconoclastic, the charismatic
Dora was also known for being standoffish, secretive and something of a
scam artist.</TE>
<TE>   The latter trait backfired after he returned to America from France in
1981. He was arrested by the FBI for having fled the country in 1975 in
violation of his parole after pleading guilty to writing a bad check for
the purchase of ski equipment.</TE>
<TE>   While serving time for that, he was sentenced to six months in federal
prison after a Denver grand jury indicted him in 1982 for altering a
credit card and using it on a two-year spending spree through Europe and
Asia.</TE>
<TE>   But Dora's run-ins with the law only added to his mystique, which was
born on the waves off Malibu in the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>'The Muhammad Ali of Surfing'</TE>
<TE>   Although the longboard-riding Dora competed in a few contests in the
1960s, he denounced competitions as being antithetical to the spirit of
surfing.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody considered Miki to be the best surfer in the world," said
Allan Carter, a friend who began surfing with Dora in the 1950s. "Miki
was like the Muhammad Ali of surfing. He had dragonfly reflexes and this
extraordinarily graceful style. It was beautiful to watch him surf."</TE>
<TE>   "He's probably the most notable California surfer in the history of
the sport," said Steve Pezman, publisher of the Surfer's Journal.</TE>
<TE>   Colorful and unpredictable, Dora was a prankster who once shot Army
rocket flares off the Malibu pier. Another time he mooned the judges at a
Malibu surfing contest. On another occasion, he let loose a jarful of
moths during a surf film to watch the moths engulf the projector.</TE>
<TE>   "Miki was a paradox," Carter said. "He was reclusive on one hand and
flamboyant on the other. He'd get comped with $500 tickets to an A-list
party in Hollywood, and give the tickets away and walk in the back door.
He was a wild character."</TE>
<TE>   That--combined with his dark tan, curly brown hair and resemblance to
a young James Garner--turned Dora into what a friend once described as
"the ultimate surfing celebrity."</TE>
<TE>   When Hollywood discovered the sport in the late 1950s, Dora doubled on
the waves for James Darren, who played Moondoggie in the movie "Gidget."</TE>
<TE>   Dora also worked in the rash of beach movies that followed: "Gidget
Goes to Rome," "Ride the Wild Surf," "Gidget Goes Hawaiian," "Surfing
Wild," "Beach Party," "Bikini Beach" and "For Those Who Think Young."</TE>
<TE>   But the movies brought more crowds to Malibu, and Dora condemned the
commercialization of surfing and the "[San Fernando] Valley cowboys and
aircraft workers" who took over his favorite surf break.</TE>
<TE>   Dora, who painted a swastika on his board, "had no mercy on those
around him," Pezman said. "He'd push them off. He was always [angry] at
the crowds and the Valley kooks."</TE>
<TE>   All of which made him fodder for the surf press, whose attention he
spurned.</TE>
<TE>   "If you had to pick one surfer that epitomized California surfing in
the 20th century, it would be Miki Dora--everything that's wrong with it
and everything that's right with it," Pezman said.</TE>
<TE>   Born Miklos Sandor Dora in Budapest, Hungary, on Aug. 11, 1934, Dora
moved to California with his family as a child. His parents divorced when
he was 6, and he spent some time in military schools. He later attended
Hollywood High School, where he sometimes skipped class to go surfing.</TE>
<TE>   He had been introduced to the sport at San Onofre in the late 1940s by
his stepfather, Gard Chapin, a well-known surfer at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "When I went to school . . . they never let you alone," Dora once told
Surf Guide Magazine. "But with surfing I could go to the beach and not
have to depend on anybody. I could take a wave and forget about it."</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1950s, Dora was among the relatively small band of
regulars surfing at Malibu, whose popularity soared with the publication
of Frederick Kohner's 1957 book "Gidget" and the 1959 Sandra Dee movie.</TE>
<TE>   "Miki had a tremendous influence on us as surfers," said
writer-director John Milius, a friend of Dora's who began surfing at
Malibu in the late 1950s. "Everybody tried to surf like him and have his
grace and his style and cool."</TE>
<TE>'A Sense of Absurdity'</TE>
<TE>   But it was also his way of looking at life, said Milius.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a kind of ironical sense of humor and a very kind of
questioning sense about him, a sense of absurdity. He was quite
intellectual, extremely well read, almost erudite, and he showed us we
could be more than just a bunch of what surfers are [stereotypically]
portrayed as in films such as "Fast Times at Ridgemont High."</TE>
<TE>   Although Dora rode the towering surf at Waimea Bay in Hawaii as a
stunt double in "Ride the Wild Surf," Pezman said, "He always said he was
a 4-foot-and-under man."</TE>
<TE>   "He had the guts and skill to ride larger surf, but it just didn't
appeal to him," Pezman said. "It wasn't elegant. It was survival. He
wasn't into survival surf; he was into the dance.</TE>
<TE>   "And he came from the most high-profile surf break in the world, and
he was the most high-profile surfer there. He was Mr. Malibu."</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the United States in the early 1970s, Dora lived for
some time in Jeffrey's Bay, South Africa, which is known for its pristine
surf. Then he settled on the coast of France.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing you can say about him: He did live life on his terms," said
Milius.</TE>
<TE>   And the legend of Miki Dora continues, especially in Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   "Still, to this day," Milius said, "you'll see on the wall there:
'Dora Rules!' "</TE>
<TE>   Dora is survived by his father, Miklos K. Dora; his stepmother,
Christina; and a half sister, Pauline.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is planned for February in Guethary.</TE>

spent most of his time abroad after the early 1970s.</CP>

<LD>Bob Stevens, 85, a sportswriter for the San Francisco Chronicle who
covered baseball for nearly 50 years and was inducted into the Baseball
Hall of Fame, died Wednesday, apparently of natural causes, at his home
in San Bruno, Calif.</LD>
<LD>   Stevens, who began writing for the Chronicle in 1935, was inducted
into the sportswriting wing of the Hall of Fame in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Stevens began by covering the Pacific Coast League teams the Oakland
Oaks and the San Francisco Seals, and was the beat writer for the Seals
from 1940 until the Giants came to San Francisco in 1958. He then became
the Giants beat writer, and also covered every World Series and All-Star
game from 1958 to 1978.</LD>
<TE>   One of his best lines came in 1959 while covering the first of what
was then the traditional two All-Star games. After Willie Mays tripled to
center field at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, Stevens' said: "The only man
who could have caught that ball hit it."</TE>

<LD>Alfred Nelder, 86, who served San Francisco for more than 50 years
in various jobs, including police chief and supervisor, died Wednesday at
California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco of complications from
kidney disease.</LD>
<LD>   Born in San Francisco, Nelder became a police officer in his hometown
in 1942. He rose from patrolman to homicide detective, solving some of
the city's most notorious crimes. After 12 years as assistant chief,
Nelder was named chief of police in 1970 by then-Mayor Joseph Alioto. He
served for 19 months, deciding to step down because he thought the Police
Commission was unfriendly.</LD>
<LD>   As chief, Nelder created the first foreign language courses for
officers to reach out to non-English speakers and introduced computers
into the force. He also favored community policing, assigning more
officers to street duty.</LD>
<TE>   In 1973, Nelder ran for the Board of Supervisors and served two terms.
In 1980, he was named to the Police Commission, where he served for nine
years.</TE>

<HD>Alfred Heineken, 78; Brewery Scion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NOORDWIJK, Netherlands
</DL>
<LD>Alfred Henry "Freddy" Heineken, who helped make his namesake beer
one of the world's most popular brands, has died. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   The former head of the world's third-biggest brewery, Heineken NV,
died Thursday at his home in the seaside town of Noordwijk, the company
said. The company did not reveal the cause of death, but media reports
said he died of pneumonia. He had been in failing health since suffering
a stroke in April.</LD>
<LD>   Heineken was the richest man in the country, with an estimated fortune
of more than $3.6 billion, but that made him the target of criminals. In
1983, Heineken and his chauffeur were abducted by kidnappers and held in
an abandoned Amsterdam hangar. The assailants sought a $14-million
ransom, but it was never paid and the two captives were freed by police
unharmed.</LD>
<TE>   The experience stayed with Heineken, and in the ensuing years he
protected his privacy more fiercely than ever, rarely appearing in
public.</TE>
<TE>   Heineken's family will retain his controlling stake in the brewery,
which trails only Anheuser Busch and Interbrew in size.</TE>
<TE>Grandfather Founded Brewery in 1864</TE>
<TE>   Heineken started his career at the company in June 1942 as an
18-year-old. The brewery was founded by his grandfather, Gerard Adriaan
Heineken, in 1864.</TE>
<TE>   In 1946, Alfred Heineken became a sales manager at the company's U.S.
distributor.</TE>
<TE>   During his two-year stay in the United States, he became intrigued by
marketing and advertising and returned to the company's headquarters in
Europe to build the beer as a premium brand. During his time in the U.S.,
he also met and married his American-born wife, Lucille.</TE>
<TE>   He designed the famous green bottle and the logo with the red star and
the graceful black banner bearing the brand name. And it worked.
Heineken's green bottles were more expensive than the alternative, but it
didn't hurt their popularity.</TE>
<TE>   Heineken became a member of the brewery's management board in 1964 and
served as chief executive from 1971 to 1989. He headed the firm's
supervisory board from 1989 to 1995. He also was the head of Heineken
Holding NV.</TE>
<TE>   Heineken retired as the head of the holding company in November.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Charlene; and
five grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Antonio Todde, 112; World's Oldest Man</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TIANA, Sardinia
</DL>
<LD>Antonio Todde, an Italian shepherd listed by the Guinness Book of
Records as the world's oldest man, was found dead Friday morning, just
shy of his 113th birthday.</LD>
<LD>   Todde, who attributed his longevity to a glass of red wine every day,
died in his sleep overnight in Tiana, Sardinia, said his nephew, Vanni
Todde.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, Antonio Todde had told his daughter he wasn't feeling
well and refused food. "His heart just gave up," the nephew said.</LD>
<TE>   Born Jan. 22, 1889, in a mountain village in the heart of Sardinia,
Todde was a shepherd all his life. He left his native island just once,
to serve in the military in World War I.</TE>
<TE>   "Right up until the end, he lived like he always did without a fuss
and showed a great love for his family," Vanni Todde said.</TE>
<TE>   Todde inherited the Guinness title of oldest living man in December
2000, when American Benjamin Harrison Holcomb died in Carnegie, Okla., at
111.</TE>
<TE>   Guinness lists the world's oldest woman as 114-year-old Maude
Farris-Luse, who was born Jan. 21, 1887, in Morley, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   On his 112th birthday last Jan. 22, Todde let the world in on the
secret to his long life:</TE>
<TE>   "Just love your brother and drink a good glass of red wine every day,"
Todde was quoted as saying then on Guinness' Web site. "You take one day
after the other; you just go on."</TE>
<TE>   Todde is survived by two sons; one daughter; a sister; many
grandchildren and great-grandchildren; and other relatives, Vanni Todde
said.</TE>

<HD>Updating Words of Comfort to Warriors</HD>
<DH>A Scout expands upon a devotional for WWII soldiers. His project
could wind up in the hands of 1 million GIs.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been three decades now, but retired Air Force chaplain James
E. Townsend hasn't forgotten the fear on the faces of wounded soldiers.</LD>
<LD>   During his tour of duty in Vietnam, he would walk the floors of a
military hospital in Da Nang each night, offering injured servicemen
words of comfort about God's love for them. What he didn't have, and
longed for, was something tangible to leave behind, like a Bible or
prayer book, to give them solace amid the explosions and screams and fear
of dying young.</LD>
<LD>   That's why Townsend volunteered to help Evan Hunsberger undertake a
daunting Eagle Scout badge project that may eventually bring comfort to
hundreds of thousands of servicemen and women.</LD>
<TE>   After three years of labor, Evan, a 16-year-old Boy Scout from Orange,
has updated a World War II-era United Methodist Church devotional filled
with prayers, Bible verses and inspirational stories. He searched out
several dozen new passages of spiritual writing from women, people of
color and leaders of non-Christian faiths--all of whom were excluded in
the original version, published in the early 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   Townsend said he used his military contacts to get Department of
Defense officials to agree last month to distribute up to 1 million
copies of the newly revised "Strength for Service to God and Country" to
members of the armed forces.</TE>
<TE>   The first 30,000 books will be published in March, and United
Methodist Church officials have begun a $3-million fund-raising campaign
to subsidize the rest.</TE>
<TE>   Evan's ambitious project, which required about 10 times the average
amount of effort that goes into earning an Eagle badge, was destined for
obscurity until Sept. 11. The new interest in spiritual and military
matters generated by the attacks has put the 380-page book into a
different, high-profile light. And Evan, an unassuming youth who loves
snowboarding and plays fullback on the Servite High School varsity
football team, is winning national attention and awards for his work.</TE>
<TE>   "There are lots of worthy Eagle Scout projects, but it was very nice
to see one that was spiritually focused and has such an ecumenical
appeal," said Larry Coppock, national director for Scouting ministries
for the United Methodist Church.</TE>
<TE>   The book, which has an entry for each day of the year, was originally
given by the church to young Methodist men and numerous others headed
into the military, beginning in World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Joe McClendon, a 74-year-old oil company executive in Oklahoma, still
keeps on his desk the copy he got in 1946.</TE>
<TE>   "What makes the book so special to me is that [shortly before he
headed to boot camp] my mother marked something for me on each page in
pencil--underscored a message or made a special note," said McClendon,
who carried it with him during the Korean War.</TE>
<TE>   Evan came to the book almost accidentally because the devotional was
also special to his grandfather, Gene Hunsberger.</TE>
<TE>   As a Marine corpsman during the bloody Pacific battles of World War
II, Gene often read prayers from "Strength for Service to God and
Country" to mortally wounded Marines and sailors.</TE>
<TE>   "He read the book to many dying Marines," said his son Donald. "He was
right in the thick of it. He carried it with him for the rest of his
life."</TE>
<TE>   Donald said the book resurfaced three years ago when his mother,
cleaning out closets while Gene was hospitalized because of a stroke,
almost threw it away.</TE>
<TE>   "I rescued it from the Goodwill stack," said Donald of the book that
still has his father's fingerprints on many of the worn pages.</TE>
<TE>   Donald and Evan, then 13, talked about the devotional and decided
updating it would make a good Eagle Scout project.</TE>
<TE>   Evan asked his grandfather, dying from complications of the stroke,
what he thought about the project.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'It's not a good project. It's a great project,' " Evan
recalled. "We had to do it for sure after that. It was so meant to be."</TE>
<TE>   Evan, with help from family, friends and Scouts, spent the next three
years securing the book's copyright, typing in the original copy and
soliciting new prayers from a diverse array of America's religious
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   He ended up with 40 new entries, including ones from Cardinal Roger M.
Mahony, Duke Divinity School professor Karen Westerfield Tucker and
United Methodist Bishop Ernest Light, an African American.</TE>
<TE>   "My father used to say he saw no difference in the blood of one person
and the blood of another person," Donald Hunsberger said. "He saw no
distinctions between people."</TE>
<TE>   The revised book's newfound diversity was also needed if armed forces
officials were going to distribute it.</TE>
<TE>   Said retired chaplain Townsend: "It's absolutely essential if it's
going to get into military. The materials aren't the kinds of things that
seek to convert people. They offer help, comfort and strength."</TE>
<TE>   Some veterans such as McClendon don't like tampering with the original
material.</TE>
<TE>   "I have reservations about this," he said, adding that instead of
mixing multiple faiths into one book, each religion should have its own
volume. "It dilutes the Christian message. I just don't think it really
needed to be updated."</TE>
<TE>   Methodist officials say they also plan to eliminate outdated entries
that either are specific to World War II or offensive to minorities.</TE>
<TE>   Evan estimates that it's taken more than 2,000 hours to complete the
project. "Every weekend when I had to do some work, my friends wanted to
go out. It was so hard to make the sacrifices to finish the book."</TE>
<TE>   His work has impressed Scouting officials. In March, Evan, a Catholic,
will be given the United Methodist Church's Good Samaritan Award. He'll
become one of only two youths outside the denomination to receive the
honor, which has been presented to 160 recipients.</TE>
<TE>   "So many kids his age, they want instant gratification," Coppock said.
"It's a credit to him that he would see this project through."</TE>

<TE>An Eerie Echo From a Very Different Sept. 11</TE>
<TE>   Here is the original Sept. 11 entry from "Strength for Service to God
and Country," a devotional written for servicemen in the early 1940s. The
same entry will appear in the updated edition.</TE>
<TE>   CHOSEN TO SUFFER</TE>
<TE>   "They therefore departed from the presence of the council rejoicing
that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the Name."</TE>
<TE>   --Acts 5:41 (A.R.V.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All of us are called upon to suffer in one way or another. Much of our
suffering goes to waste because it is not geared up with an
all-compelling purpose. A great cause, such as liberty, chooses men who
are big enough to suffer, men who "can take it."</TE>
<TE>   It chooses men who have the stuff in them to endure hardships, who can
laugh at privations, who are willing to give up privileges, comforts and
ease. It chooses men like the apostles who, after being treated in a most
shameful way and cruelly flogged, came from that experience rejoicing
that they were counted worthy to suffer for the name of Christ.</TE>
<TE>   Great causes have a way of choosing men who are worthy to suffer. And
it is through men who suffer that great causes come to victory. The
highest blessings that we enjoy today came in this way. Christ on the
cross, Washington at Valley Forge, Lincoln baited by newspapers and even
by his Cabinet members, are a few among many who were chosen to suffer
for great purposes and were found worthy--bringing victory to the cause
that chose them.</TE>
<TE>   In these days the great cause of liberty is again choosing men to
suffer for its sake. Shall we who are chosen be found worthy?</TE>
<TE>PRAYER</TE>
<TE>   Our Father, we are being called upon to suffer for the sake of all men
everywhere. The great cause of liberty, with all that it means, is
calling for men who are worthy. Wilt Thou make us worthy in every way.
Keep the high purpose of freedom uppermost in our hearts, and cleanse us
from all selfishness. Dedicate us anew to the high cause of world
brotherhood, and give us the victory of an enduring peace. And so shall
our suffering be not in vain. In the Spirit of Christ we pray. Amen.</TE>

<HD>Seeking the Truth About the Dead Sea Scrolls, Jews and Christians</HD>
<DH>THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS AND THE JEWISH ORIGINS OF CHRISTIANITY By
Carsten Peter Thiede; Palgrave / St. Martin's Press; 256 pages, $27.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Dead Sea Scrolls are famous," writes Carsten Peter Thiede in
"The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Jewish Origins of Christianity." "But what
are they famous for?"</LD>
<LD>   The answer is not as obvious as it may seem. "It has been said that
two Dead Sea Scrolls scholars have at least three different opinions,"
the author writes. But he proposes to "penetrate the smoke screen of
rumors and legends, conflicting theories and wishful thinking" that has
obscured the origin and meaning of these ancient writings, and to reveal
the discoveries that have been overlooked, if not actually suppressed, by
scholars and theologians.</LD>
<LD>   The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1946 or 1947--Thiede points
out that even the year is subject to debate--was actually "the
rediscovery of a rediscovery." The earliest mention of "caves with jars
and scrolls in the northern Dead Sea region," as Thiede writes, dates to
the early 3rd century. Clues to the existence of the scrolls are
scattered through the writings of the church fathers and various Jewish
sectarians. "In fact," he insists, "the accidental discovery by some
Bedouins remains a stigma on the face of classical archeology."</LD>
<TE>   Thiede, an Anglican minister who teaches early Christian history at
universities in Switzerland and Israel, is especially interested in what
the scrolls reveal about the Christian world--in both distant antiquity
and the modern era--and the intimate relationship between the first
Christians and the Jewish community from which they emerged. Above all,
he insists that a proper reading of the scrolls establishes a much
earlier date for the oldest texts of the New Testament than many scholars
have been willing to accept.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of his book is the controversial notion that at least two
papyri retrieved from the caves at Qumran, cataloged as 7Q 4 and 7Q 5,
contain fragments from the New Testament--specifically, Mark 6:52-53 and
1 Timothy 3:16-4:1, 3. According to Thiede's close reading of the
evidence, these writings reached the community at Qumran sometime between
AD 30 and AD 68, when the site was abandoned by the desert-dwelling,
ascetic Jews, known as Essenes, who anticipated the imminent coming of
the Messiah and who probably collected and preserved the Dead Sea
Scrolls.</TE>
<TE>   "It goes without saying that the Qumran Essenes heard about the new,
personified messianic message during those decades," Thiede insists. "To
put it bluntly, if there is any place where we must expect to find the
first writings of these Jesus People, it is the study library of . . .
the Essenes."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Thiede cautions us against the notion, held by some scholars,
that Jesus spent his years in the wilderness in an Essene community like
the one at Qumran, and he argues that the "Jesus People" and the Essenes
were rivals. "They knew of each other, they learned from each other, they
rejected each other, giving and taking all the time," he explains. "The
first Christians were no Essenes, and the Essenes did not all of a sudden
mutate to Christians."</TE>
<TE>   Thiede, the author of such bestsellers as "Eyewitness to Jesus," is
addressing a general readership, but he does not oversimplify his
argument or evidence. He reproduces the Greek text of the fragments and
explains the significance of such arcane details as the spacing of
letters and the number of letters per line. And he condemns the
theological motives of scholars who refuse to accept even the possibility
that the Dead Sea Scrolls include fragments of the New Testament.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who are convinced that there must not be and cannot have been
'Christian' texts at Qumran stoop to a polemical approach which includes
a palpable misleading of nonspecialist readers," he writes. "But at the
present state of the Jewish-Christian debate about the nature of the
first Christian writings as inner-Jewish, messianic and eschatological
literature, no harm is done to anyone's faith, nor to the historical
context as such, if 7Q 4 is finally accepted as 1 Timothy and 7Q 5 as
Mark."</TE>
<TE>   Thiede argues that the placement of fragments from the New Testament
among the Dead Sea Scrolls ultimately serves to promote solidarity among
Christians and Jews. The passages of the New Testament that are often
condemned as anti-Jewish, he asserts, reflect only "an inner-Jewish
'family conflict' " among rival factions within the Jewish community of
1st-century Palestine. Indeed, the language of the New Testament "is
caressingly mild if compared with the vocabulary employed against fellow
Jews by the authors of some of the Hebrew and Aramaic texts found at
Qumran."</TE>

Review, is the author of, most recently, "The Woman Who Laughed at God:
The Untold History of the Jewish People."</TE>

misconceptions about Islam, especially since the events of Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   "Take advantage of any opportunity to let people have firsthand
experience with Islam and Muslims," Souheil Ghannouchi, president of the
Muslim American Society, said Dec. 28 at the three-day "Living Islam in
America" convention.</LD>

</DL>
<LD>The new chairman of the city's school committee wants to begin each
board meeting with a prayer.</LD>
<LD>   Edward Boucher said he needs God's help in his job and plans on asking
for it even if others don't think it's appropriate.</LD>
<LD>   "I think, since the incidents of Sept. 11, there is a greater need to
seek the Lord's guidance, particularly in deliberating the affairs of the
school committee," Boucher said. "The events were caused, basically, by
religious intolerance."</LD>
<TE>   The school committee is expected to vote on the issue Wednesday. The
state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union said prayer at school
committee meetings is unconstitutional.</TE>

<HD>Sect Preserves a Piece of Old Russia</HD>
<DH>Religion: Descendants of group that left Russian Orthodox Church in
the 17th century keep medieval traditions alive in an Oregon village.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WOODBURN, Ore.
</DL>
<LD>An old woman wearing peasant clothes and a kerchief stands in front
of a Russian church topped by gilded cupolas.</LD>
<LD>   The scene could be out of a long-ago century if it weren't for a Ford
pickup parked nearby and a TV antenna sprouting from a house.</LD>
<LD>   This is "the village," a row of houses and churches in the heart of
Oregon's community of Russian Old Believers, descendants of dissident
Christians who split from the Russian Orthodox Church in the 17th
century, then fled to the United States to escape persecution.</LD>
<TE>   Struggling to preserve traditions dating back to medieval times, they
cling to strict rules: no meat on Wednesdays and Fridays. Peasant-style
clothing must be worn with a belt. Followers cannot eat off the same
dishes as nonbelievers, so some Old Believers eat out only at fast-food
restaurants, where meals come in disposable containers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never been easy to be an Old Believer," said Brother Ambrose
Moorman, an Old Believer monk and curator of a Russian museum at the
Mount Angel Abbey.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the sect will celebrate Christmas according to the Russian
Orthodox calendar, which runs two weeks behind the Gregorian calendar
used in the West.</TE>
<TE>   While most Americans decorate for Christmas, Old Believers do the
opposite: All ornaments, such as religious icons, are taken down, and the
house is cleaned and made as bare as possible before the holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Old Believers must fast for periods of time and abstain from alcohol
leading up to Christmas. They celebrate with an all-night Mass ending
with a festive breakfast and a return of the decorations.</TE>
<TE>   "We would go to church on Christmas Eve, and Mom would stay home and
put up the decorations," recalled Ulita Seleznev, a first-grade teacher
at Heritage Elementary School in Woodburn.</TE>
<TE>   The Old Believers split from the Russian Orthodox Church when the
institution enacted reforms to reconcile differences between Russian
religious texts and Greek originals. The Old Believers chose to adhere to
traditional rituals.</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, the schism concerned such seemingly trivial issues as
how many fingers should be extended while making the sign of the cross:
The Old Believers use two, modern Russian Orthodox three.</TE>
<TE>   On a deeper level, the split seemed to reflect different visions of
Russia's future. The Old Believers, whose faith developed in the forests
and swamps of Russia's hinterlands, opposed the subordination of religion
to the increasingly powerful secular government in Russia as the country
became an empire.</TE>
<TE>   Many Old Believers fled the country over the years. Those who remained
stayed on the fringes of Russian society, typically living in remote
villages in the far north or in Siberia. About 3 million people are of
Old Believer descent in Russia today.</TE>
<TE>   The 10,000 Old Believers in Oregon are the largest concentration
living in the United States. Some were directed to the state by charities
that helped Christians migrate from communist countries during the Cold
War.</TE>
<TE>   Yavhori Cam, the founder of the Old Believers' village, carved the
subdivision from verdant farmland about 30 miles south of Portland in the
1960s.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Sunday service inside Pokrov Church, men in dark robes
chanted as women crossed themselves and genuflected before icons
illuminated by candles.</TE>
<TE>   After the service, girls and boys scampered out onto Bethlehem Road in
the village in pink and red embroidered clothes, with kerchiefs and
leather boots and belts, giving the impression of an Old World peasant
festival.</TE>
<TE>   Old Believers get their fashion sense at baptism. Eight-day-old
infants are dressed in an embroidered shirt, or rubashka, a homemade belt
called a poyas, and a cross, and are expected to wear the same style for
the rest of their lives.</TE>
<TE>   For girls, a flowing dress, or platya, extending to the ankles, must
be worn tied with a belt.</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining such traditions continues to be a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Old Believers have to observe 40 annual religious holidays, and the
religion's strict rules make employment with businesses in the community
at large all but impossible. About half are farmers--one of the few
occupations that meshes with their lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   Many Old Believers don't believe in education beyond eighth grade, and
send their children to work on farms or at construction jobs with friends
and relatives. Still, Seleznev said she sees more and more Old Believers
making compromises. All drive cars, and most watch television.</TE>
<TE>   Kalin Ayhan, a Woodburn police officer and an Old Believer, had to
decide whether to shave his beard, an act the sect considers an insult to
God, or be fired from his job. He decided to shave.</TE>
<TE>   Community leaders allowed him to continue attending church, but barred
him from chanting the liturgy with the men and made him stand in the back
with the women. He split from the community soon after.</TE>
<TE>   "They came over here and put us smack down in the middle of the United
States of America but say, 'Don't take part in anything,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   His cousin, Filip Ayhan, took a different path. He grew up in the
village and spoke only Russian until first grade, then he quit school
after seventh grade.</TE>
<TE>   Ayhan began working as a painter with family members or other Russians
who are contractors. He vows he will stay and raise his children in the
same fashion.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still closely knit, but not as reclusive as before," Seleznev
said. "The kids are more American growing up than when I grew up."</TE>

<HD>Coaches Feel Domino Effect</HD>
<DH>Football: Spurrier stuns Florida with resignation and Green is
fired by Vikings, kicking off what could be a vicious cycle of job
changes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Spurrier and Dennis Green. Two of the biggest names in the
coaching ranks. On Friday, they suddenly had one more thing in common.</LD>
<LD>   Both were out of football.</LD>
<LD>   Spurrier shocked the University of Florida by tendering his
resignation and Green was forced out of his job after a decade with the
Minnesota Vikings, seemingly unconnected developments, occurring within
hours of each other, that combined to send a shudder through the game.</LD>
<TE>   The dominos could tumble from Washington, D.C., west to San Diego and
Stanford, influencing several prestigious jobs that are open--or could be
open soon.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier's decision came days after he led the third-ranked Gators to
victory in the Orange Bowl. His 12-season record of 122-27-1--including
six conference titles and a 1996 national championship--ranks him among
the winningest coaches in college football.</TE>
<TE>   "I just feel my career as a college head coach after 15 years is
complete," Spurrier, who coached three years at Duke before taking over
at Florida in 1990, said in a statement. "And if the opportunity and
challenge of coaching an NFL team happens, it is something I would like
to pursue."</TE>
<TE>   Green recently has been on the hot seat despite being in the vanguard
of African American football coaches and leading his team to the
postseason eight times in the last 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Twice the Vikings lost in the NFC title game.</TE>
<TE>   But this season, they have slipped to 5-10 and will miss the playoffs
for the first time since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   They have also endured controversy, first with the training camp death
of lineman Korey Stringer, then when receiver Randy Moss said he plays
hard only when he feels like it.</TE>
<TE>   The only surprise in Green's announcement is that it came a few days
early.</TE>
<TE>   "This year we had to fight our way from close to the bottom, and
that's life in the National Football League," Green said.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot love something and have passion for something only when it
goes the way you want it to go."</TE>
<TE>   The two high-profile departures resonated throughout the college and
professional ranks, with speculation rampant about where all the chips
might fall.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier said he has no job lined up, but that assertion was met with
skepticism from an NFL executive who suspects the coach's unemployment
will be brief.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve's too smart, in my mind," he said. "He wouldn't give that
[Florida job] up unless he had something in his back pocket."</TE>
<TE>   So where might Spurrier go?</TE>
<TE>   Washington is a possibility, according to two league executives. There
has been friction this season between Coach Marty Schottenheimer and
Redskin owner Daniel Snyder. Having failed in an attempt to hire Spurrier
last year, Snyder reportedly spent this week in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   But Washington does not offer the sun and golf that Spurrier favors,
so a perhaps stronger possibility would be Tampa Bay, if Coach Tony Dungy
is fired or, in another twist, goes to Minnesota. Carolina might be
another option, if George Seifert is fired. And there's even speculation
in NFL circles that Spurrier might end up replacing Dan Reeves in
Atlanta. Any job opening closer to home would probably be a plus.
Spurrier's mother lives in Jacksonville, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   A dark horse? San Diego has the sun and the fairways, not to mention a
promising young quarterback in Drew Brees. But the Chargers also have the
domineering John Butler as general manager.</TE>
<TE>   Green is rumored to be a candidate at Stanford, where he formerly
coached.</TE>
<TE>   But the Cardinal already tried hiring back a coach for a second
stint--Bill Walsh--and that did not work out.</TE>
<TE>   Athletic Director Ted Leland is believed to want a cheaper,
up-and-coming coach. Harvard's Tim Murphy or Buddy Teevens, the assistant
offensive coordinator at Florida, would fit that mold. Teevens won two
Ivy League titles at Dartmouth when Leland was athletic director there.</TE>
<TE>   With the distinct possibility that Seifert and Indianapolis Coach Jim
Mora will be fired at the end of the season, Green might wait to see what
develops.</TE>
<TE>   He also might sit out a year and live off the $5.4 million Minnesota
has reportedly agreed to pay him.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, Minnesota needs a coach and, if not Dungy, then who?</TE>
<TE>   Owner Red McCombs said he has no short list. However, Texas Coach Mack
Brown is prominent among potential candidates. Viking assistant Mike
Tice, the interim coach for Monday night's season finale against
Baltimore, is another possibility.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, the early favorite is Jet defensive coordinator Ted
Cottrell. Butler is thought to prefer a defense-minded coach, and
Cottrell worked under him with the Buffalo Bills from 1993-2000, the last
three seasons as defensive coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   The final piece in this puzzle is former Charger Coach Mike Riley, who
might have had the USC job last season and is now rumored to be a
candidate at Indiana and Nevada Las Vegas, where Coach John Robinson
might choose to devote himself to being athletic director.</TE>
<TE>   The odd team out might be Florida, which was startled by Spurrier's
abrupt departure. Will the Gators take a run at San Francisco Coach Steve
Mariucci, who has chafed with his front office this season? Would
Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops return to his old stomping grounds?</TE>
<TE>   His brother, Mike, Oklahoma's defensive co-coordinator, told The Daily
Oklahoman the opening "means a lot for Bob.... It will be a tough
decision for him."</TE>
<TE>   Athletic Director Jeremy Foley is also believed to be looking at Mike
Shanahan of the Denver Broncos and Brigham Young Coach Gary Crowton.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly a sad day for our program," Foley said of Spurrier's
departure.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a passing of an era. It's been a lot of fun for a lot of people.
He brought us a program that we could only dream about."</TE>

<LD>A season of raging controversy, computer geeks serving us Nebraska
on a Rose Bowl platter, four lousy, lopsided BCS bowl games, and now
this?</LD>
<LD>   Now, Florida Coach Steve Spurrier tosses in his visor?</LD>
<LD>   Say it ain't so, Joe (Paterno).</LD>
<TE>   We knew this day was coming almost since the day Spurrier took over
downtrodden Florida in 1990 and revolutionized the program and the sport
with his unique brand of sass and pass.</TE>
<TE>   We knew Spurrier could not forever resist the NFL's temptations. This
isn't the first time the major leagues have come knocking.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, Spurrier might have had his pick of either of the
expansion franchises, Charlotte and Jacksonville.</TE>
<TE>   He turned down the Tampa Bay job after the 1995 season, the Atlanta
Falcons in 1996 and, last year, the Washington Redskins.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, after 122 victories in 12 seasons, six outright
Southeastern Conference crowns, two national title-game appearances, and
an endless stream of verbal bombs and barbs, Spurrier finally gave in.</TE>
<TE>   "I simply believe that 12 years as head coach at a major university in
the SEC is long enough," he said in a prepared statement.</TE>
<TE>   This was not a case of burnout.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier's retirement is only a prelude to his accepting a job in the
NFL with (take your pick) Tampa Bay, Jacksonville, Washington, maybe even
San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   True to form, in his statement, Spurrier was forthright, acknowledging
he was leaving to seek employment elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "If the opportunity and challenge of coaching an NFL team happens, it
is something I would like to pursue," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chalk this up as a win for the NFL and a huge loss for the colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier used to talk all the time about "God smiling on the Gators,"
but God isn't smiling on Gainesville today.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier, simply put, was the most fascinating, petulant, outspoken,
out-pass-you personality in college football--Bill Walsh with a pebble in
his shoe.</TE>
<TE>   A royal pain? You bet. Only Dennis Miller could hang with Spurrier
when it comes to rants. Many coaches and sportswriters disdained Spurrier
for his outspokenness and ruthlessness.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Spurrier never bought into the line about not speaking ill of
your brethren.</TE>
<TE>   It was he who took the playful dig at rival Tennessee, saying, "You
can't spell Citrus Bowl without the U or the T."</TE>
<TE>   It was he who called Florida State "Free Shoes University" after
Seminole players were sanctioned for receiving shoes from a sports agent.</TE>
<TE>   As a tactician, Spurrier goes for the jugular.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1980s, while coaching the Tampa Bay Bandits of the United
States Football League, Spurrier opened a game against the Memphis
Showboats by ordering an onside kick. After Tampa Bay had recovered the
kick and scored a touchdown, Spurrier ordered another.</TE>
<TE>   "Embarrassment is part of the game to him," Memphis Coach Pepper
Rodgers said.</TE>
<TE>   A former Florida quarterback who won the 1966 Heisman Trophy, Spurrier
was murder on his own quarterbacks, constantly playing mind games with
them. Most recently, he benched All-American Rex Grossman for the start
of the Orange Bowl against Maryland for missing curfew.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier was also one of the few coaches brave enough to take on
Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden, a genuine Southern icon.</TE>
<TE>   Before the 1997 Sugar Bowl against Florida State, with the national
title at stake, Spurrier accused Florida State of late hits against
quarterback Danny Wuerffel in the schools' regular-season meeting.</TE>
<TE>   It was an obvious ploy to unnerve Bowden and rattle Florida State, and
it worked. After losing the regular-season game in Tallahassee, Florida
easily won the Sugar Bowl rematch for the national title.</TE>
<TE>   This season, after beating Florida State, Spurrier accused a Seminole
player of trying to hurt his tailback, Earnest Graham, and quarterback
Grossman.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier is blunt as a brick, and he might have had no earthly idea
how poorly his diatribes played out on national stages.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, there is no denying his impact.</TE>
<TE>   He single-handedly changed the way football was played in the SEC,
once a "cloud-of-dust" conference that thought passing was for sissies.</TE>
<TE>   Boy, did the SEC get rocked when Spurrier arrived in 1990 and began
using a wide-open offense that featured five-receiver sets.</TE>
<TE>   In one stretch, starting in 1993, the Gator offense scored 500 or more
points in four consecutive seasons. Other SEC teams had to adjust or risk
getting embarrassed.</TE>
<TE>   In no time, other teams started to mimic the Gators. Alabama,
Tennessee, Georgia, Louisiana State and others scrambled to upgrade their
offenses. Alabama and Tennessee, which also won national titles in the
1990s, oddly owe a certain philosophical debt to Spurrier.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly will be strange to see someone else on the sideline in
the future," Florida Athletic Director Jeremy Foley said "[Spurrier]
brought us a program we could only dream about."</TE>
<TE>   Foley knew Spurrier eventually would leave, but did not think that day
would be Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier told Foley of his decision in a morning phone call.</TE>
<TE>   "At one point he asked me if I was still there, because I was
gasping," Foley said. "I really thought he was kidding."</TE>
<TE>   No joke.</TE>
<TE>   Although Friday's announcement was a surprise, you sensed Spurrier was
becoming increasingly frustrated.</TE>
<TE>   Winning football games didn't seem enough for him anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Not even the 56-23 Orange Bowl victory over Maryland this week seemed
to slake his thirst.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't win much this year," he said after the game. "We did win
the Orange Bowl and go 10-2 and finish in the top five of the country.
We'd still rather be ordering rings."</TE>
<TE>   You wonder, too, how much the befuddling bowl championship series
played into the decision. Spurrier was a staunch playoff proponent and
hated that college football's champions were decided by computers and
polls.</TE>
<TE>   In his mind, games, and championships, were to be won on the field.
Many thought that, in a playoff format, Florida would have been the team
most likely to beat Miami this season.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Spurrier had seen enough. There are no BCS standings in the
NFL, no computer formula to deny him the chance of ultimate victory.</TE>
<TE>   The question now is, who will replace him at Florida?</TE>
<TE>   Foley is no doubt going over his short list, but the answer is
obvious:</TE>
<TE>   No one.</TE>

<DH>Lakers: O'Neal and his aching feet return after five games away,
and he scores 24 in 118-86 rout of Suns.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal padded his feet and swallowed his pills and
lowered his eyes, and the Lakers resumed their regular season on Friday
night, with all due strength and enthusiasm.</LD>
<LD>   Off the injured list, where he spent five games, O'Neal again made the
Lakers who they are, again made their championship three-peat appear
preordained.</LD>
<LD>   He scored 24 points in 28 minutes and the Lakers defeated the Phoenix
Suns, 118-86, before 18,997 at Staples Center, with all who attended
awash in the reminder of what he does for them, and for the Lakers. The
crowd stood with him at the end, and O'Neal raised his arms to return its
cheers, and when it was over he winked at his mother, seated not 50 feet
away.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just the same old Shaq," Kobe Bryant said. "He's right back to
business as usual, kicking butt and taking names."</TE>
<TE>   Not coincidentally, the Lakers scored their season-high for points,
and the 32-point victory margin was their largest as well. They have won
three consecutive games and are a league-best 23-6.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal made 11 of 15 field-goal attempts and took nine rebounds, and
he did not play for the final 16-plus minutes. Afterward, with his team
amid a run of seven games in seven cities over 11 days, O'Neal sat with
his feet in a red bucket of ice, a towel on his lap, and a smile on his
face.</TE>
<TE>   "When a tree that's been chopped on as much as this tree gets rest,
the chlorophyll gets replenished," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And everyone laughed with O'Neal. His feet, he said, felt OK enough.
Rather than drag them around uncomfortably for 40 minutes, as he had for
weeks before the injured list, he ran easily, and blocked a shot, and
talked the Suns out of many more.</TE>
<TE>   "I always try to come back with a fabulous performance," he said. "The
team played well, and that's what we're supposed to do. We did what we're
supposed to do. I told the guys in the huddle, it's about that time we
pick our game up a notch. We've been coasting for long enough.... So,
right before the playoffs we can be very, very deadly."</TE>
<TE>   Rested and therefore as lively as he'd been this season, O'Neal had
most of his game, and all of his personality, and so the Lakers had no
problem with the Suns.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal rested for nearly all of 13 days, starting from three days
before Christmas, when the pain in his feet became too much to manage. By
then, O'Neal was finding it difficult to get up and down the floor. His
defense, in particular, suffered, and during a pre-Christmas game in
Memphis he decided he'd require most of a couple of weeks off.</TE>
<TE>   The schedule, then, did no favors for the Suns, who arrived to find a
reasonably sound and content O'Neal, once again determined to force his
game on them. Or, through them, as was the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he played right up to par," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said.
"It's a good feeling to play out there on the floor with him."</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix Coach Scott Skiles, already down a Jake, sent out Jake Voskuhl
and hoped for the best. Center Jake Tsakalidis, who doesn't fare well
against O'Neal anyway, is on the injured list.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal scored 20 points in the first half and left for good with 4:24
left in the third quarter, when he drew his fourth foul and was benched.</TE>
<TE>   Before that, however, O'Neal was at his dynamic best.</TE>
<TE>   He stomped up the floor after dunks, and gleefully shook his
shoulders, and then stared at the Phoenix bench.</TE>
<TE>   He led the fast break once in the first half, high-dribbling down the
middle of the floor before dishing to Bryant on the right wing, then
getting the ball back for a finger roll.</TE>
<TE>   Later, alone against Voskuhl near the three-point line, O'Neal put the
ball on the floor, hesitated, crossed over and went hard to the rim. As
he entered the lane, he pulled up and flipped up a six-foot shot that
swished. At that, O'Neal's eyes and mouth widened, and his mother,
Lucille, chuckled at his joy.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the type of energy everybody's grown accustomed to seeing from
him," Rick Fox said. "It not only sends a message to the opponent, but it
sets a tone for our team and it sends energy through all of us.... To see
him pushing the ball out on the break, that's Shaquille. That's what you
like about him."</TE>
<TE>   The Sun coaching staff complained in November that O'Neal was stepping
into the lane illegally during his free throws. Mark Cuban piled on, and
the issue hung around for a week or so, long enough for O'Neal to call
the Suns whiners and Cuban a punk, or some such thing.</TE>
<TE>   Reminded before Friday's game that the Suns started that, O'Neal said,
"Pfft," as though he didn't care at all.</TE>
<TE>   "Cryin' won't stop me," he said. "Remember that."</TE>

<HD>Tavares Is Latest Loss for Disney</HD>
<DH>Management: Head of Angels and Ducks ends controversial reign,
saying monetary woes and on-field defeats made job 'unbearable.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fans had walked away from Disney's sports teams. On Friday,
Tony Tavares followed them.</LD>
<LD>   Tavares, who ran the Angels and Mighty Ducks, resigned as president of
Disney's Anaheim Sports subsidiary.</LD>
<LD>   "Any kind of losing is my regret," Tavares said. "Losing money and
losing on the field makes a job like this unbearable."</LD>
<TE>   The teams lost games, lost money and lost fans, and Disney executives
did not try to dissuade Tavares from his decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Tony came to us and said he thought it was time to go. I didn't
disagree," said Paul Pressler, who oversees Anaheim Sports as chief of
Disney's parks and resorts division.</TE>
<TE>   Pressler said he would launch a national search for a successor,
although candidates might balk at signing up to run two teams Disney
would prefer to sell. Pressler said he will place a priority on
experience in professional sports, a background Tavares lacked. In the
interim, Pressler said three Anaheim Sports vice presidents will share
administrative duties and said the general managers, Pierre Gauthier of
the Ducks and Bill Stoneman of the Angels, will report directly to him.</TE>
<TE>   Although Tavares said Pressler's recent involvement with the Angels'
baseball operations was "not a major factor" in his departure, the
autonomy of Stoneman and Gauthier might become restricted under Pressler.
Pressler acknowledged his involvement in the decision to reject a
Stoneman trade that would have sent outfielder Darin Erstad to the
Chicago White Sox and in the $24-million signing of pitcher Aaron Sele,
for the Angels their largest free-agent contract since they acquired Mo
Vaughn in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly have spent a lot more time [with the teams]," Pressler
said. "I've worked with Bill on some trades. It's clear that we've given
Bill the direction we want to have a competitive team in 2002."</TE>
<TE>   Tavares' departure follows the collapse of negotiations to sell the
Angels to Florida Marlin owner John Henry. With no buyer on the horizon
for the Angels or Ducks, Pressler vowed that Disney was now playing to
win.</TE>
<TE>   And, in even more heartening news for long-suffering Angel fans,
Tavares' departure could persuade all-star closer Troy Percival to
abandon his vow to leave the team after his contract expires this year.</TE>
<TE>   "For Troy, this was important because he had philosophical differences
with Tony that otherwise would have made it impossible for him to re-sign
with the Angels," agent Paul Cohen said. "Now that Tony has gone on to
other things, it has opened the door for Troy to remain with the
organization if terms are mutually acceptable."</TE>
<TE>   Not long ago, Tavares, 52, presided over a magic kingdom of his own.
Disney chairman Michael Eisner personally tapped Tavares to lead the
company's entry into professional sports. The Mighty Ducks, founded in
1993, turned windfall profits, sold caps and T-shirts virtually at will,
sold out the Arrowhead Pond almost every night and charged into the
playoffs in four seasons behind coach Ron Wilson and superstars Paul
Kariya and Teemu Selanne.</TE>
<TE>   Disney bought the Angels in 1996 and added them to Tavares' portfolio.
He directed a $117-million stadium renovation, with attendance jumping
43% to 2.5 million when Disney unveiled the new Edison Field in 1998. He
also helped persuade Eisner to spend $80 million on Vaughn, a free-agent
slugger.</TE>
<TE>   But Vaughn injured his ankle in the first inning of his first game
with the Angels, tumbling into a dugout, and the fortunes of both teams
tumbled as well. The Angels have not appeared in the playoffs, attendance
has fallen 25% in the past three seasons, and Tavares replaced five
marketing chiefs in five years. In a report released last month by
baseball Commissioner Bud Selig, the Angels claimed operating losses of
$100 million from 1995-2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks have yet to win a playoff game since Tavares fired Wilson
after the '97 season, the popular Selanne was traded last year and a team
that once sold out 51 consecutive games ranks last in the NHL attendance
and loses millions each year.</TE>
<TE>   Tavares first considered quitting his job in 1997, frustrated in part
by concerns over the pace and financing of the stadium renovation. In
1999, when Disney negotiated to sell the teams to a group led by Orange
County high-tech baron Henry T. Nicholas III, Tavares told friends he was
looking forward to moving to the Lake Tahoe area, where he has a vacation
home and where he would be free from the burden of running two teams that
play a combined 244 games a year in overlapping seasons. He also was
alternately weary and combative about the constant stream of public
criticism that accompanied the failure to deliver a championship product.</TE>
<TE>   "Losing just started to wear on me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tavares, who signed a three-year contract extension last year, said he
first discussed his resignation with Pressler in October and said a
settlement agreement was finalized Wednesday. He said he will indeed move
to the Reno-Tahoe area and start a sports consulting business.</TE>
<TE>   As the public face of the Angels and Ducks, and sometimes because of
his comments, Tavares drew the wrath of fans frustrated at the ineptitude
of the Disney teams. In explaining his absence from the news conference
to announce Wilson's dismissal, Tavares said, "I was not eating Snickers
bars and soaking my feet in Ron's blood." Percival's outrage was prompted
by Tavares' sharing details of supposedly confidential contract
negotiations with a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Tavares invested the emotion of a fan into a corporate job. And what
would he say to those fans who might celebrate his departure?</TE>
<TE>   "If it's a good day for them," he said, "it's a great day for me."</TE>

<HD>Bruins Bend, Don't Break</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Cummings ignites UCLA past Washington, 74-62,
after his dunk delays game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>T.J. Cummings was bent out of shape, upset at a hard foul by
Washington's Grant Leep with 42.3 seconds to play.</LD>
<LD>   Time out was called and Cummings cooled enough to smile to himself at
the irony.</LD>
<LD>   During pregame warmups he'd bent the rim on a dunk, causing a
15-minute delay as Pauley Pavilion workers lowered the standard that
holds up the basket, broke out a wrench and replaced the iron.</LD>
<TE>   Now all Cummings had to do was make two free throws to complete a
dismantling of the Huskies and extend UCLA's winning streak to eight. The
shots went in, the Bruins prevailed, 74-62, and 7,567 had watched the
reserve sophomore center take his game to a whole new standard.</TE>
<TE>   Cummings scored 22 points and took a career-high 11 rebounds. He had
11 points in each half and made two shots down the stretch when UCLA
(10-2, 3-0 in Pacific 10 Conference play) extended a two-point lead to
six with 4:34 to play with consecutive baskets.</TE>
<TE>   "My teammates were messing with me in the locker room during the
delay," he said. "I was working on my post moves and the whole thing just
snapped. I just hoped I would have a chance to make amends."</TE>
<TE>   The opportunity came early. Starting center Dan Gadzuric, who had 23
points and 13 rebounds when UCLA won at Washington (6-7, 0-3) Dec. 20,
picked up two fouls in the first 90 seconds, sat out the rest of the
first half and played six minutes overall, contributing only two points
and one rebound.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I knew I had to step up," Cummings said.</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't alone. Forward Matt Barnes continued his recent stretch of
sound all-around play, scoring 12 points and racking up a career-high
eight assists. He also had six of the Bruins' 46 rebounds, 18 of which
came on the offensive end.</TE>
<TE>   Freshmen Cedric Bozeman, Andre Patterson and Dijon Thompson all made
strong contributions off the bench, combining for 16 points and eight
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman, playing for the first time since having knee surgery Dec. 3,
entered the game to cheers at the 11:51 mark of the first half with UCLA
trailing, 13-12.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson and Patterson joined him a minute or so later and keyed a
six-point Bruin run that cooled when Washington called a time out.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so glad to get out there," Bozeman said. "It's been hard
sitting there on the bench."</TE>
<TE>   From the moment he stepped on the floor, the 6-foot-6 guard exhibited
more intensity than he did during UCLA's 2-2 start, helping force a shot
clock violation with strong defense, then scoring on a spin move in the
lane off an inbounds pass.</TE>
<TE>   Seconds later, Thompson made a steal in the backcourt and dunked, and
scored again off Patterson's assist. Washington's C.J. Massingale made a
three-point play, but Patterson responded with a short hook shot.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson, who played 11 minutes, made all three of his shots and
grabbed four rebounds, three on the offensive end. Bozeman made three of
five shots, had two rebounds, an assist and only one turnover in seven
minutes. Thompson had four points, two rebounds and two steals in 15
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "Watching those three freshmen is like looking into a crystal ball and
seeing the future of this program," Coach Steve Lavin said.</TE>
<TE>   The present is appealing too. Jason Kapono and Billy Knight, the
team's leading scorers, had off games, yet both made clutch shots down
the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Kapono was only four for 12 and missed seven of eight three-point
shots, but his short bank shot with 1:52 to play extended the lead to
67-59.</TE>
<TE>   Knight, who scored only seven points on three-of-10 shooting, made a
three-pointer from the corner with under a minute left and UCLA led by
11.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Barnard, Washington's leading scorer with 22, made the Huskies'
10th three-pointer 12 seconds later, conjuring images of Georgetown's
flurry of long shots in the waning moments of UCLA's victory last
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   But Cummings was fouled hard by Leep, voiced displeasure, regained his
poise and hit the clinching free throws.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a football-style cheap shot, and the heat of the moment got to
me," he said. "Then I thought about it and figured I'd just make the
shots."</TE>
<TE>   The free throws--unlike the pregame dunk--didn't touch the rim. The
new basket had survived the game, the Bruins had withstood Washington.
And Cummings had done his part to keep the winning streak from toppling.</TE>

<HD>Trojans Find the Right Forum Against Cougars</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A steady diet of early-season Pac-10 patsies has USC confidence at
a season high.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to a quirk in their schedule, the Trojans are facing the two
Washington schools, who were picked to finish ninth and 10th in the
league, for their first four Pacific 10 Conference games.</LD>
<LD>   To its credit, USC is taking care of business.</LD>
<TE>   With five players scoring in double figures Friday night, the Trojans
steamrolled Washington State, 85-64, in front of 3,923 at the Forum.</TE>
<TE>   It was the seventh consecutive victory of the season for USC (11-2
overall, 3-0 in Pac-10 play) and the Trojans' series-high seventh
consecutive victory against the Cougars (4-7, 0-3), who are mired in a
five-game losing funk.</TE>
<TE>   Senior small forward David Bluthenthal led USC with 16 points while
senior point guard Brandon Granville and sophomore guard Desmon Farmer,
who came off the bench, each scored 15 points. Senior power forward Sam
Clancy had 14 and freshman center Rory O'Neil scored a career-high 11 in
20 minutes before fouling out as a substitute.</TE>
<TE>   Cougar guard Marcus Moore, who grew up blocks from the Forum, led
Washington State with 15 points.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting into the rhythm at the right time," said Granville, who
sat out two practices earlier this week because of a sore left foot but
came back to get a season-high 12 assists and three steals with only one
turnover. It was his second double-double of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach [Henry Bibby] is getting more confidence in us and letting us
go.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think Washington State is a good team. They're going to
surprise some people down the road. I just think we're playing well at
the right time, at the start of Pac-10."</TE>
<TE>   Granville passed Arizona's Damon Stoudamire for fifth place on the Pac
10's all-time assist list on the night. Granville, a four-year starter,
has 664 assists.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State led by as many as five points, 16-11, eight minutes
into the game before Bibby's frenetic substitution pattern began to spark
the Trojan offense Friday.</TE>
<TE>   USC made 56.1% of its field-goal attempts, including 25% accuracy
(four for 16) from beyond the three-point arc, and outscored Washington
State, 24-2, on fastbreak opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans, who played 13 players, had 11 steals and forced 18 Cougar
turnovers as freshman guard Derrick Craven, who had been out with a
broken bone in his right leg, and football player Greg Guenther, a
freshman forward who just joined the team, played for the first time this
season.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fun tonight because this was a team effort," said Clancy, who
also had seven rebounds, three assists, three blocks and two steals.</TE>
<TE>   With 1,261 points, Clancy moved up to 10th on USC's all-time scoring
list, passing Stais Boseman. And with 651 rebounds, Clancy passed Purvis
Miller and Chris Munk for 11th on the school's all-time rebounding list.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman guard Errick Craven--after scoring a career-high 29 points at
Washington State on Saturday--was held scoreless in the first half
Friday, going 0 for 2 on his field-goal attempts with two fouls and an
assist in six minutes.</TE>
<TE>   There were 22:15 gone in the game when Craven finally sank his first
basket of the night, but, soon after, he quickly found his touch, making
three consecutive shots, including an acrobatic reverse layup.</TE>
<TE>   His third basket, an 18-foot jump shot from the left wing, gave USC a
19-point lead, 57-38, with 13:45 to play.</TE>
<TE>   In establishing its big lead, USC limited Washington State to one
field goal in the first 7:50 of the second half, three field goals in the
first 14:47.</TE>

<HD>His Lost Summer Still Haunts</HD>

<LD>He was hell's Angel. He was daffy Duck.</LD>
<LD>   He was also one of the most powerful sports figures in Southern
California, which explains why, in the summer of 1997, Tony Tavares
required only three months to torch two flammable franchises.</LD>
<LD>   While dodging those corks popping across Orange County this morning in
the wake of Tavares' resignation Friday as Disney sports boss, think of
those three months.</LD>
<TE>   In May 1997, Tavares fired Ron Wilson, arguably the most popular--and
possibly the best--hockey coach in Southern California history.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks had just captured a community's imagination by advancing to
the second round of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   They have since gone 133-174-54, with as much shot at the postseason
as Lord Stanley's Steamer.</TE>
<TE>   Later that summer, the unthinkable happened.</TE>
<TE>   In July 1997, Tavares nixed a trade that would have brought Mark
McGwire to the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   The franchise was just one big hitter from the playoffs, one big name
from stealing the thunder from the fading Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   Since that season they have gone 312-336, including a just-completed
season during which they were out of contention approximately three hours
after April's first pitch.</TE>
<TE>   And, oh, after being traded to the St. Louis Cardinals instead,
McGwire hit 70 home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Running the Disney sports operation since its inception in 1993,
Tavares has indeed put the magic in magic kingdom.</TE>
<TE>   He made two professional sports teams disappear.</TE>
<TE>   In their beginning, the Mighty Ducks were one hot flock. Their
merchandise sales ranked among the national leaders. The gorgeous Pond
hosted 51 consecutive sellouts.</TE>
<TE>   Today? In what may be the most astounding statistic in all of sports,
the Mighty Ducks rank last in the league in attendance.</TE>
<TE>   In the beginning of Tavares' reign over the Angels, they had just lost
a one-game playoff with the Seattle Mariners for the American League West
Division championship.</TE>
<TE>   Today? They are best known as that team that once had cheerleaders on
top of the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   To lay all of the blame for the Orange Massacre at Tavares' squeaky
shoes is, of course, a bit unfair.</TE>
<TE>   But he was Disney's smirking face. He was Disney's condescending
voice. A former venue operator, he was Disney's answer to how sports
franchises should be run.</TE>
<TE>   Not as a team that creates memories for T-shirts, but as a team that
sells those T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   Not as competitors, but as billboards.</TE>
<TE>   Tavares fired Ron Wilson because he thought billboards shouldn't talk.</TE>
<TE>   Tavares nixed a deal that would have sent Jim Edmonds and Scott
Schoeneweis or Jarrod Washburn to Oakland for McGwire and Scott Brosius
because he thought billboards shouldn't cost too much.</TE>
<TE>   So what happened Friday was good news, no matter how or why it
happened.</TE>
<TE>   Tavares, who ironically was recently overruled by bosses on what would
have been one of his best moves--the trade of Darin Erstad for top
Chicago White Sox prospects--was apparently tired of the losing.</TE>
<TE>   And Disney was apparently tired of how Tavares had become the focal
point of that losing.</TE>
<TE>   Again, who cares? Already the fallout will make Angel fans feel as if
they've been rescued from a ninth-inning jam.</TE>
<TE>   This could mean closer Troy Percival, who didn't feel appreciated by
Tavares, might agree to make nice and stick around after all.</TE>
<TE>   Now for the bad news.</TE>
<TE>   It is Tavares resigning instead of Disney.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, this might indicate just the opposite, that Disney is not on
the verge of selling the operation after all. Why would Tavares jump a
rickety ship if that ship is preparing to dock?</TE>
<TE>   With Disney still in charge, the focus turns to Tavares' boss, a guy
who runs, among other things, another Disney dog.</TE>
<TE>   Yep, California Adventure. You've been? Didn't think so.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Pressler, chairman of Disney's parks and resorts division that
kennels that hound, is now charged with finding Tavares' replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully he does a better job than those in his company who set up
the recent ABC/ESPN Rose Bowl show with California Adventure as a
backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing worse than hearing Terry Bowden prattle was watching
him prattle in front of empty roller coaster.</TE>
<TE>   But, anyway, here's the worst of it.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of letting his respective general managers take care of their
own business, Pressler has announced a national search for Tavares'
successor.</TE>
<TE>   Which means, if Disney is finally serious about winning, it needs to
find somebody who knows as much as baseball as hockey.</TE>
<TE>   Which means it still isn't.</TE>
<TE>   Goodbye, frying pan.</TE>
<TE>   Hello, fire.</TE>

<LD>Shaquille O'Neal stopped, which was a sure sign he was ready to go.</LD>
<LD>   He finally had good news to report, so he paused on his way to the
locker room after the Lakers finished their morning shootaround Friday
and talked to reporters.</LD>
<LD>   "The general is back," he said.</LD>
<TE>   OK, so it's not exactly Douglas MacArthur returning to the
Philippines. It's Shaq returning to active duty after a five-game stint
on the injured list to give his sore and arthritic toes a break.</TE>
<TE>   It's not all good now. The story's not over. It's not as if someone
can just kiss O'Neal's feet and make them all better. (Anyone willing to
perform that task deserves more money than O'Neal makes.)</TE>
<TE>   Time off doesn't really improve his feet, it just makes them hurt less
and reduce the swelling. He's back now simply because it's as good a time
as any.</TE>
<TE>   "They were gracious enough to give me five games [off] and I'm ready,"
O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't want to spend the rest of the year hopping off and on the
injured list, losing his rhythm and then regaining it while the team
adjusts back and forth</TE>
<TE>   "I'll probably be with the team the remainder of the season, ready to
go," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   This is the new normality. It includes three pills a day and soaking
his feet in a tub of ice for 15 minutes after every game. (He's putting
off acupuncture until later.)</TE>
<TE>   And it's really the only thing intriguing about this team until the
playoffs start. Can Shaq still be Shaq?</TE>
<TE>   He looked as dominant as usual Friday, throwing down ferocious dunks
and even flossing a crossover dribble in the Lakers' 118-86 victory over
the Phoenix Suns</TE>
<TE>   In only 24 minutes he had 24 points, nine rebounds and five assists.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, he did most of his damage against Jake Voskuhl. Voskuhl is
one of those noncenters who populate the NBA now. Friday, Voskuhl did
little more than serve as Stephon Marbury's personal cheerleader and yell
"Yeah, Steph!" whenever Marbury made a layup and drew a foul. He sure
didn't provide much resistance to O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal usually looks like himself during the game, when the
adrenaline's coursing through his system and he's too busy mugging for
the crowd to grimace.</TE>
<TE>   But afterward, on the walk to his car through the cold Staples Center
tunnels, he often has a noticeable limp.</TE>
<TE>   The thrill of victory, the agony of the feet.</TE>
<TE>   The most ominous talk of the night came from Phil Jackson. He recalled
how a similar toe injury essentially led to "the demise of Walt Frazier,"
Jackson's hall of fame teammate with the New York Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal likes to think of himself as unstoppable and indestructible.
He's standing so tall above the NBA landscape, with no one to play
Russell to his Chamberlain, and now the most serious threat is his little
piggies.</TE>
<TE>   "Big things don't hurt me," O'Neal said during a reflective moment
before the game. "Little things hurt me. Why is that?"</TE>
<TE>   It's like the common cold killing off the aliens in "The War of the
Worlds." (Or, in the modern version, a computer virus doing in the space
guys in "Independence Day.")</TE>
<TE>   No one should be too large to overlook the details. In this case,
O'Neal needs to work harder to keep weight off in the summer. Dr. Stephen
Lombardo, the Lakers' team physician, said O'Neal's weight didn't
contribute to his condition. But in the layman's opinion--and
Jackson's--the extra pounds can't help it.</TE>
<TE>   What also won't help is the All-Star game. O'Neal won't say what his
plans are, but he should take the weekend off. He spent a week in
Philadelphia during the finals last year, saw the zoo, had his
cheesesteaks, so there's no need to go back.</TE>
<TE>   He worked out hard during his absence--he was often in a heavy sweat
by the time his teammates arrived at practice--and he looks the way he
did at the end of last season.</TE>
<TE>   But there's always those feet in that tub of ice. A vulnerable O'Neal
does keep the season interesting.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since Shaq and Kobe did their Hotsync operation last spring, the
Lakers had been unbeatable. Without O'Neal, Laker games were
unpredictable, the team a group of scrappy rebels.</TE>
<TE>   "It taught us that we have to depend on each other," Lindsey Hunter
said. "We can't just expect one or two guys to do it all. Everybody has
to be a part of this, no matter how big or how small it is."</TE>
<TE>   Take Samaki Walker. He blocked 16 shots the past four games, turning
into a defensive stopper after opponents took O'Neal's absence as an open
invitation to drive to the hoop.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured they would do that," Walker said. "I didn't mind. It helped
my numbers a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Walker showed he can block shots. But O'Neal doesn't have to touch the
ball to make a difference. He showed how on successive defensive stands
in the first quarter, when he forced Marbury to alter a shot, then scared
Voskuhl into traveling.</TE>
<TE>   We saw on Friday that Shaq can still be Shaq. When he can't be, he
says he won't even try anymore. Jackson keeps using Arvydas Sabonis as an
example of how injuries forced a player to change his game, and O'Neal
would rather have Phil talk about his free throws than compare him to
Sabonis.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't ever want to be that guy, that 'Shaq used to be, a couple of
years ago,' " O'Neal said. "If it ever gets to where you guys are saying
that constantly, then it will be time for me to do something else."</TE>
<TE>   He's not ready to join the sheriff's department. For now, Shaq's still
Shaq. The Lakers are still the Lakers. Good news for the criminals, bad
news for the rest of the NBA.</TE>

<LD>Jerry Greene in the Orlando Sentinel: "You've got to be impressed
with Grant Hill. He is running second among forwards in the East for the
NBA All-Star game. Imagine how far ahead he would be if he could walk!</LD>
<LD>   "Who does this voting? Don't tell me it's the NBA fans. If you are an
NBA fan, surely you have noticed Hill will not be playing this season,
just as he didn't play last season.</LD>
<LD>   "But there he is, trailing only Toronto's Vince Carter in his group.
And he's the ninth-leading vote-getter in the entire league."</LD>

<TE>  Trivia time: Who holds the Laker record for three-point field goals in
a quarter?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>  He's b-a-a-a-ck: After scoring 51 and 45 points in recent games,
Michael Jordan told the Washington Post: "My legs are coming back. That
was how I was playing all summer before I broke my ribs and got off
rhythm. If I can keep the tendinitis away, I'm sure you can see that type
of game again."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>  Get him: The late Dick Schaap, a former newspaper guy, was also the
sports world's chief raconteur. He once said: "The guy who ought to be
commissioner of baseball is Fidel Castro because he speaks Spanish, he's
had a lot of dealings with Washington, and he played the game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>  Now they will: San Jose Shark defenseman Gary Suter has to be careful
with the medication he takes while battling a stomach virus because he
will be subjected to drug testing during the Winter Olympics next month.
"I just swallowed a lot of cork to plug me up," he told the San Jose
Mercury News. "They don't test for cork."</TE>

<TE>  Chop suey shock? Dallas Maverick center Wang Zhizhi, the first Chinese

<TE>   Bay Area blues: Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle on the
departures of Tyrone Willingham, Jason Giambi and Johnny Damon:</TE>
<TE>  "Ah it's great to be here in the Bay Area, only one rung below the big

<TE>  "Like Sinatra crooned in that song about the Bay Area, 'If I can make
it here, I'll make it even bigger somewhere else."'</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>  Trivia answer: Glen Rice, six, against Portland on May 5, 1999. He
finished with eight, tying the club record held by Nick Van Exel.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: The Washington Post's Sally Jenkins wasn't much impressed
by the "national championship" Rose Bowl game:</TE>
<TE>  "The bowl championship series put its product on the field ... evident
for all to see. If there was any lingering doubt that its soul-selling,
mercenary made-for-television national championship is a failure, that
doubt was resolved before the first half ended between top-ranked Miami
and its controversial opponent, Nebraska. The game had all the appeal of
an arranged marriage."</TE>

<LD>I think the city of Los Angeles owes Nebraska and its football fans
a big apology. The treatment they endured while visiting your city was
absurd. They were there only to support their football team. The BCS put
us in the Rose Bowl. To blame it on the Huskers was ridiculous. The
football team was booed loudly, twice at the Lakers' game. What a bunch
of hospitable people you have there!</LD>
<LD>   We who remained in Nebraska read and heard the hundreds of stories
about the way they were being treated. Weren't they there spending money
at your shops, hotels, restaurants, Disneyland and other tourist
attractions? We had over 70,000 people help boost your city's economy,
and all you can do is treat them like dirt.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly everyone agrees that Oregon should have been there instead of
us, but that was out of our hands. Blame the BCS and treat them like
dirt. Don't take it out on normal, everyday people who come to your city
to visit.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In this time, when the nation has gone through so much, it is
comforting to know that many of our American traditions live. As the new
year dawns, I see that Gary Sheffield is unhappy with Dodger management
and feel comfort knowing that this traditional rite has not changed one
iota.</LD>
<LD>   My unsolicited advice to Dodger management: Excise this malignant
tumor. Trade for players, cash, prospects, magic beans, anything. Just
lose him. The team should have no time for whining millionaires.</LD>
<LD>   Mike MacDonald</LD>
<TE>   North Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So Gary Sheffield is at it again, complaining about a so-called lack
of respect, claiming that Dodger General Manager Dan Evans isn't being
straight with him about whether or not the Dodgers have been trying to
trade him.</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield, since you're insisting, here's what Evans didn't have the
heart to tell you: "Gary, we've been trying to trade you, but we can't
find a sucker team stupid enough to put up with such a sniveling, whining
ingrate. But Gary, because we want you to be happy, we'll keep trying."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Bendat</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gary Sheffield is wasting his time complaining about the lack of
respect from Dodger management.</TE>
<TE>   If Gary would just look around him and see how much the Fox management
team cares about putting a winning team together, compared to some of the
other marquee franchises out there, he would know that his value to the
team is looked at the same way they care and commit to the fans about
giving us that championship they talk about every year.</TE>
<TE>   Gary, you should be so lucky as to go to the Mets, Cards or Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Roman</TE>
<TE>   Tarzana</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I don't blame Gary Sheffield at all for being frustrated with Dan
Evans and the Dodgers. It's common knowledge that Evans has spent most of
the off-season trying to shop Sheffield to Oakland (and God knows where
else), even though Sheffield's consistent clutch performances were one of
the only things that kept the team above .500 in 2001. In light of last
year's spring training fiasco, it wouldn't have taken Nostradamus to
predict that Sheffield would be further alienated by Evans' trade talks,
as well as his subsequent denials thereof.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, such two-faced behavior seems to have become something of
a Chavez Ravine tradition; for years, the Dodgers' front office has used
the team's glorious history as a major selling point, while shelling out
ridiculous wads of cash for such useless dupes as Tom Goodwin, Alex Cora,
Jeff Shaw, Darren Dreifort, Mike Trombley, Terry Mulholland and (sad but
true) Eric Karros--and that's just the 2001 roster.</TE>
<TE>   What's next, Dan? Paul Lo Duca and Shawn Green to Milwaukee for Devon
White, two aging triple-A prospects and some frozen bratwurst?</TE>
<TE>   I'm with you, Gary; I don't trust the Dodgers, either.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Epstein</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For Gary Sheffield: Enough already. Take your paltry $10 million a
year and just play ball! We are tired of hearing it. Retire or play, who
cares?</TE>

<TE>   El Segundo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steve Freeman's "A Dodger Christmas Carol" [Letters, Dec. 22] was
eloquent and accurate.</TE>
<TE>   I don't expect the Dodgers to spend millions more to buy us a
championship. However, I do expect them to show some pride. After all,
they used to be the Dodgers.</TE>

<TE>   No! Miami did not erase all doubt. It played the fourth-best team in

anyone to believe all doubts were erased.</TE>

<TE>   I'm so glad the college football season is over so I don't have to
read and listen to the constant babble of sportswriters bad-mouthing the
BCS. While I will admit that the Rose Bowl was less than exciting, the
supposition presented by writers and reporters that they are more
objective and less biased than computer software makes them look as
intelligent as a sizable percentage of players down on the field.</TE>
<TE>   Many writers feel the AP poll is the only way to crown a national
champion. Heaven forbid we should take away their weekly dose of ego
gratification as they cast their ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Those who don't get to cast a ballot in the AP poll claim that a
playoff system is the only way to crown a true national champion. The
playoff system certainly works to produce a highly competitive,
edge-of-your-seat, nail-biting Super Bowl year after year, doesn't it?</TE>
<TE>   Dick Fischer</TE>
<TE>   Burbank</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The BCS never did guarantee a consensus national championship game--it
provided only an objective mechanism which took into account many factors
and evaluated them as objectively as possible. Is it perfect? Of course
not. Want a true national champion, get a playoff. Otherwise, let's enjoy
the system as it stands.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon seems to be the darling of the media these days, but the Ducks
have only themselves to blame for not being in Pasadena. First, they
looked woeful in barely winning on national TV against Oregon State. To
what extent did this game hurt them? If they had played against the
Beavers the way they did against Colorado, they'd probably [have played]
in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Second, strength of schedule now counts a lot more than in the pre-BCS
days. Having Utah and Utah State on your schedule does not help; an
underachieving Wisconsin was also not an asset to the Ducks. Looking
ahead, who do the Ducks have on their nonconference schedule in the next
five years? Indiana (twice), Portland State, Nevada (twice) and Utah
State again--not exactly the lineup to enhance your strength of schedule
component.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Toronto Raptor forward Morris Peterson will miss six to eight weeks
with a fractured right index finger.</LD>
<LD>   To make room for Peterson on the injured list, the Raptors on Friday
activated center Mamadou N'diaye, who had been on the list since Oct. 29.</LD>
<LD>   Peterson was hurt in the third quarter of Wednesday's game in
Portland. He was out of the lineup for the first time all season when the
Raptors played Cleveland on Friday night.</LD>
<TE>   The Raptors said Peterson will not need surgery on the finger but will
wear a splint during his rehabilitation. He has averaged 12.6 points, 3.5
rebounds and 2.3 assists this season.</TE>

<TE>   Calvin Booth, who was supposed to be the Seattle SuperSonics' starting
center after signing a $34-million, six-year contract as a free agent,
will be out another month because of a painful sprained right ankle that
has developed tendinitis.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking at four more weeks," Coach Nate McMillan said before
Friday night's game against the Philadelphia 76ers.</TE>
<TE>   Booth, who has been on the injured list since Dec. 12, had his right
ankle placed in a protective boot on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-11, 231-pound Booth, 25, played in 15 of Seattle's first 31
games, averaging 18.6 minutes, 6.2 points and 3.6 rebounds. He scored a
career-best 24 points against Dallas Nov. 20.</TE>
<TE>   He sprained his ankle in practice the day before the Sonics' regular
season opener Oct. 30 and has been hurting since.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland Cavaliers activated guard Jeff Trepagnier, a former USC
standout, from the injured list and put guard Trajan Langdon on the
injured list with a sprained right ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Trepagnier, the Cavaliers' second-round pick in this year's draft, has
missed the last 14 games with tendinitis in his right knee. He has played
in six games this season, averaging 1.7 points in 4.7 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Langdon has played in 16 games this season, averaging 2.6 points. He
was in uniform for the Cavs' game Friday night in Toronto.</TE>

<LD>The story of Indiana's victory over San Antonio can be told with
the number 33.</LD>
<LD>   Getting 33 points from its reserves and holding the Spurs to a
season-low 33% shooting from the field, the Pacers won for the fifth time
in seven games, defeating the Spurs, 92-82, at San Antonio on Friday
night.</LD>
<LD>   Al Harrington came off the bench to lead Indiana with 18 points as the
Pacers ended a two-game losing streak. Jermaine O'Neal scored 16 points,
Jeff Foster had 14 and Reggie Miller 13. Austin Croshere had 10 points
and 14 rebounds for the Pacers.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought both teams competed well tonight," Indiana Coach Isiah
Thomas said. "Defensively our intensity was great. There was a lot of
emotion in this game, I think that's why it seemed a little crazy at
times."</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio, which had a two-game winning streak stopped, was led by
Tim Duncan with 22 points and 12 rebounds. Steve Smith had 12 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was a pitiful performance on our part," said San Antonio
Coach Gregg Popovich, who was ejected after receiving two technicals with
9:35 remaining in the second quarter. "Give Indiana credit, they had
energy and played aggressive. They played to win."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 93, Utah 86--Wally Szczerbiak scored a career-high 37 points
as the Timberwolves rallied at Minneapolis as they ended the Jazz's
four-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Szczerbiak scored 26 points in the second half and shot 14 of 24 from
the field, surpassing his previous career-high of 35 set Nov. 6 against
the New York Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 87, Seattle 77--Allen Iverson started slowly and shot
poorly but finished with 22 points to lead the 76ers at Seattle, ending
the SuperSonics' six-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson, who shot one for six and had three points in the first
quarter, played 43 minutes and shot eight for 21 as the 76ers won their
second consecutive game on their longest road trip of the season--seven
games in 12 days.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 101, Cleveland 91--Vince Carter scored 34 points at Toronto as
the Raptors defeated the Cavaliers for the 10th consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Davis and Alvin Williams had 17 points each for the Raptors,
who have won six of eight. Carter also had eight assists.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 109, New Jersey 96--Tracy McGrady scored 35 points at East
Rutherford, N.J., before being ejected along with Kenyon Martin of the
Nets because of a late scuffle.</TE>
<TE>   After Martin hammered McGrady with a forearm as he went up for a layup
with the Magic ahead, 98-92, McGrady got off the floor and charged at
Martin. The two bumped and shoved and Martin threw a jab before officials
and teammates separated the two. Orlando outscored the Nets, 11-4, the
rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   Miami 89, Boston 66--Eddie Jones scored 23 points and Brian Grant had
18 points and 12 rebounds as the Heat stopped the Celtics' seven-game
home winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   The win, the second consecutive on the road for the Heat after a
six-game losing streak, was Coach Pat Riley's 300th with Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 113, Memphis 109--Shareef Abdur-Rahim, facing his former team
for the first time, had 22 points and 13 rebounds to lead the Hawks at
Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta acquired Abdur-Rahim in an off-season trade for Lorenzen
Wright, Brevin Knight and the rights to first-round pick Pau Gasol.
Abdur-Rahim spent five seasons with the Grizzlies in Vancouver.</TE>

<HD>Jordan Gets a Jump on Bulls</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Unable to hit a shot and worn out by a sinus infection, Michael
Jordan somehow summoned the energy to put an exclamation point on a
victory against his old team.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't a layup or dunk, but it was truly spectacular.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan grabbed Ron Mercer's layup out of the air with both hands and
pinned it against the backboard in the final seconds of the Washington
Wizards' 89-83 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Friday night.</LD>
<TE>   "I can jump when I have to," Jordan said, "especially when I get
[angry]."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan scored 29 points, but 19 of them came in the second quarter. He
was one for nine with four points in the second half as the Wizards
nearly blew a 26-point lead, so a lot of frustration was unleashed in
what Coach Doug Collins called Jordan's most spectacular play of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know where he came from," Collins said. "He was really dead
on his feet. He was mad. That was an angry play. He was flying. John
Thompson said he is Floor Jordan now, but he was flying on that one."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, who scored 51 and 45 in his two previous games, made nine of
24 shots, 11 of 13 free throws and had seven rebounds and three assists
in 38 minutes. He also become the fourth player in NBA history to score
30,000 points.</TE>
<TE>   The victory achieved a personal goal for Jordan, who spoke of how he'd
like to get the long-struggling Wizards above the level of the Bulls, the
league's worst team since Jordan departed in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The mission seems already achieved. The Wizards (17-14) are three
games above .500 and have won three consecutive and five in a row at
home. The Bulls (6-25) are again at the bottom of the standings and are
0-17 on the road, the only NBA team not to win away from home.</TE>
<TE>   "This is special in a sense that we're trying to claw our way out of
the basement of losing teams," Jordan said. "If we have to step on other
people to move up, then that's what we do.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the importance of it more than anything. I like to think that
we're moving in the right direction and Chicago may not be moving in the
right direction, and I don't want to be compared with them. I want to
show some separation."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, who did not practice Thursday and was late for Friday's
shootaround because of his sinus problems, was way off the mark several
times as the Bulls rallied to within 85-78 with 3:45 left.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan stopped the run by getting fouled on a move to the basket and
making both free throws with 1:54 to play. Both teams were cold the rest
of the way as the Wizards hung on.</TE>
<TE>   "They forced it to be a game," Jordan said. "And we limped ourselves
right into a victory."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Whitney had 18 points and eight assists for the Wizards, and
Popeye Jones had 10 points and 12 rebounds.</TE>

<TE>30,000-Point Club</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jordan became the fourth player in NBA history to surpass
30,000 points in a career. Jordan --who started the game with 29,985
points --finished with 29 to lead the Washington Wizards to an 89-83
victory over the Chicago Bulls, a team he scored 29,277 points for in 13
seasons. Here's a look at the four players who have 30,000 points:</TE>

<HD>Victory Doesn't Appease Odom</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: He has 27 points in 82-80 Clipper victory, but
missed free throws leave him in sour mood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Anger, disappointment and frustration boiled over all at once for
Lamar Odom at the final buzzer Friday at the Pepsi Center. He spiked the
basketball, sending it soaring toward the mammoth scoreboard that hangs
from the ceiling.</LD>
<LD>   Imagine what he would have done if the Clippers had lost this clunker
to the Denver Nuggets.</LD>
<LD>   Odom missed two free throws with 8.7 seconds left that would have made
matters a good deal easier for him and the Clippers. But the Nuggets
bungled a chance at tying the score in the closing seconds and the
Clippers held on for an ugly 82-80 victory before a crowd of 16,004.</LD>
<TE>   Winning was not enough to pacify Odom at game's end and he took out
all his emotions on the basketball. He refused to be consoled by the fact
that he scored a season-high 27 points, took seven rebounds and added
seven assists.</TE>
<TE>   Odom was still downcast after taking a shower and changing into his
street clothes. Perhaps that's a sign the Clippers are evolving--turning
from a franchise that's merely happy with any victory into one that's a
bit more demanding.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not supposed to miss those, not at that time of the game," Odom
said. "They're \o7 free\f7  throws. \o7 Free\f7  throws. A four-point
lead [84-80] would have sealed it."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Clippers had to sweat out the final seconds. Fortunately
for them, Denver's James Posey was whistled for traveling in the lane
with 1.8 seconds remaining. Posey was trying to pass to teammate Ryan
Bowen, who was alone and cutting toward the basket.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers killed the final moments and escaped with only their
second road victory in 10 games. They are 15-7 at Staples Center, which
helps to explain why they're not buried in the Pacific Division
standings.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing was going to lift Odom's spirits, however.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm known as a clutch performer," he said. "I want the ball in my
hands at the end of the game. I want to be on the line at the end."</TE>
<TE>   Odom was easily the Clippers' best player Friday, driving to the
basket and sinking long-range jump shots with equal confidence. At times,
he was about all the Clippers had going for them.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers led, 63-52, after Darius Miles made a jump shot late in
the third quarter, but the Nuggets rallied to within 67-63 by the end of
the period. The Clippers led, 79-71, after another Miles basket, but that
advantage didn't last either.</TE>
<TE>   Elton Brand had only nine points, although he scored the go-ahead
basket on a left-handed reverse layup with 1:36 left. Whether the
Clippers would hold an 81-80 lead was anyone's guess, however.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff McInnis made a free throw after Denver Coach Mike Evans was given
a technical foul for arguing with the officials after Michael Olowokandi
blocked Posey's shot with 11.9 seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   On the ensuing possession, Denver's Bowen tied up Corey Maggette.
Maggette won the tip, slapping the ball to Odom. But before Odom, a 66.7%
free-throw shooter, could pass the ball to Earl Boykins (76.5%), the
Nuggets fouled him.</TE>
<TE>   Odom's first attempt looked good, but rolled out. The second one
clanged off the back of the rim.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as he leads us, like he did tonight, he can miss two free
throws," Miles said. "As long as it's not too often."</TE>
<TE>   The Nuggets were without point guard Nick Van Exel, forced from the
game early in the fourth quarter because of a strained back. Posey, who
led the Nuggets with 28 points, made a strong move into the lane with the
game on the line. But he took too many steps under intense pressure from
the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, they're not going to pack the tape of that one off to
Springfield [Mass., home of the Basketball Hall of Fame]," Clipper Coach
Alvin Gentry said. "It's a win and that's the only thing that matters. It
was close, but we hung in there. We had to have a defensive stop and we
got one."</TE>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Power forward Elton Brand said he was elated after missing seven of
nine shots en route to nine points during the Clippers' victory Friday
against the Denver Nuggets. A sore right elbow slowed his offensive
production, but he did take 13 rebounds.</LD>
<LD>  But what thrilled Brand was that the victory was the Clippers' 17th
this season. In two seasons with the Chicago Bulls, Brand never won more
than 17. The Bulls dealt him to the Clippers last summer.</LD>
<LD>  "Seventeen wins ties my career high and it's only January," he said.
"I'm elated."</LD>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  The Clippers will be trailed for the next two months by crews from
ESPN, which will air seven one-hour segments on the team as part of its
"Sidelines" program later this season. The cable network featured a

<HD>For O'Neal, Rest Is History</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite only slight improvement in his aching toes, Shaquille
O'Neal came off the injured list on Friday night and resumed a season
made arduous by the nagging ailments.</LD>
<LD>  O'Neal was in the starting lineup against the Phoenix Suns after
sitting out five games, time spent attempting to ease the pain, primarily
in his arthritic right big toe.</LD>
<LD>  "It was good to get some rest," O'Neal said. "It was hospitable of them
to do that for me."</LD>
<TE>  Asked why, given his lack of progress, he would return to the floor,
O'Neal said, "Because I'm back on the drugs. Hopefully, the drugs will
carry me."</TE>
<TE>  O'Neal averaged 26 points and 11.5 rebounds in 23 games before
Christmas Day, when the pain forced him to the injured list. Since then,
he has resumed his use of anti-inflammatory medication, which upsets his
stomach.</TE>
<TE>  Coach Phil Jackson has said he would limit O'Neal's practice time, if
not his playing time. He also suggested O'Neal might need at least
another stint on the injured list before the regular season ends, a
strategy that could have him miss the NBA All-Star game in February.</TE>
<TE>  "It wears at you," Jackson said of the daily pain. "We've all had
limitations due to physical things, and it wears at you, especially when
you can't do the things you expect to do on the basketball court. Your
coach is looking funny at you and your teammates complain you're not
giving them help on the screen-and-rolls and that wears at you too."</TE>
<TE>  O'Neal's break, then, was nearly as much for emotional reasons as
physical ones. The challenge now will be to have him sound in April, in
time for the playoffs. No one seems to know just how that will play out.</TE>
<TE>  "Obviously, [his] extra weight has a lot to do with it," Jackson said.
"But it's not the ... primary cause. And neither are his tennis shoes,
although they could contribute too. Who knows? The fact is, it's there.
And now how do you deal with it?"</TE>
<TE>  Jelani McCoy was put on the injured list.</TE>

<LD>Brigham Young (10-2) at Pepperdine (6-6), 5, Fox Sports Net 2, KPLS
(830)--The Waves complete one of the most difficult nonconference
schedules in the nation with a test against a hot Cougar team that's
knocking on the top-25 door. Sophomore forward Glen McGowan, who was
suspended for the first semester for his involvement in a fight with
teammate Will Kimble, returns. BYU has won eight in a row, including an
upset of Stanford last month.</LD>
<LD>  Loyola Marymount (7-6) at Portland State (5-7), 7, KXLU-FM (88.9)--The
Lions purged the memory of a bad loss at Montana by pasting Occidental on
Tuesday night. Portland State has victories over Arizona State and Santa
Clara.</LD>
<LD>  UC Riverside (5-6, 2-1) at UC Irvine (9-4, 2-0), 7, KDOC (Channel 56, 9
p.m.), KUCI-FM (88.9), KPRO (1570)--Irvine needed a 23-6 run over the
final eight minutes to rally past Cal State Fullerton on Thursday and
extend its home winning streak to 17 games. Riverside picked up one of
its biggest wins since moving up to Division I with its victory at Long
Beach State.</LD>
<TE>   Utah State (10-2, 3-1) at UC Santa Barbara (9-3, 3-0), 7--It's an
early Big West showdown between the defending champion Aggies and the
first-place Gauchos.</TE>

<DL>KNOXVILLE, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>There is nothing more important in women's college basketball than
the NCAA tournament.</LD>
<LD>   But for a nonchampionship game, today's battle between Connecticut and
Tennessee should be a scintillating showcase.</LD>
<LD>   A capacity crowd of 24,535 in the Thompson-Boling will watch the top
two teams in the country try to determine the tournament favorite.</LD>
<TE>   Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma wants his team to learn something
about itself as well as something about Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   "The more you're in a situation where you have to figure out ways of
escape, the more you're tested in the ability to adapt. Then you've added
something you can draw on later," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Tennessee Coach Pat Summitt says she is looking for a
gauge.</TE>
<TE>   "It is certainly, for us, an opportunity to assess our team, look at
where we are, and where we want to go," Summitt said.</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies hold a 7-6 series edge, have won both their
national-championship matchups and have split the previous four games
played at Tennessee. Rarely have two teams seemed so contrasting and yet
so even.</TE>
<TE>   At 15-0, top-ranked Connecticut has hardly broken a sweat in beating
opponents by an average of 37.8 points. It boasts probably the best
starting lineup in the game. Seniors Sue Bird, Asjha Jones, Tamika
Williams and Swin Cash, and sophomore Diana Taurasi all score in double
figures.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee, 11-0 and ranked second, can't match Connecticut's seniors.
But that hasn't kept the Volunteers from outscoring opponents by 23.9
points.</TE>

<HD>Oregon Stuns Arizona--Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This was supposed to be Arizona's revenge. Instead, it was another
Duck drubbing of the Wildcats.</LD>
<LD>   Thirteen days after handing Arizona the most one-sided loss in Coach
Lute Olson's 19 seasons at the school, Oregon defeated the 15th-ranked
Wildcats again, 90-80, Friday night at Tucson.</LD>
<LD>   "We felt we wanted to make another statement, having played so well up
there in Eugene," Oregon Coach Ernie Kent said. "Probably the best thing
for us was to turn around and play them again."</LD>
<TE>   Only a three-point basket by Will Bynum with 23.9 seconds to play
prevented it from being Arizona's worst home loss of the Olson era.</TE>
<TE>   Luke Ridnour set career highs with six three-pointers, 23 points and
10 assists as the Ducks (10-3 overall, 3-0 Pacific 10 Conference) won at
McKale Center for the first time since 1985, a span of 16 consecutive
losses.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon swept Arizona (8-4, 1-2) for the first time since the 1982-83
season.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon, which made 13 of 22 three-pointers in its 105-75 rout of
Arizona in Eugene on Dec. 22, hit 10 of 17 threes this time.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, the Ducks lost at Arizona, 104-65.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Gardner scored 22 points for Arizona, but was just seven for 19
from the field and three for 11 on three-pointers for the Wildcats, who
were without Luke Walton, their best passer and defender. Walton, one of
only three non-freshmen in Arizona's rotation, strained his right
Achilles' tendon in Arizona's victory over Pepperdine on Dec. 29.</TE>
<TE>   "Even with Luke, I don't know how much better we would have been,"
Olson said. "We are having a miserable time getting our guys to play with
some continuity."</TE>
<TE>   The worst loss for Arizona at home under Olson is a 61-49 defeat to
Tennessee on Dec. 23, 1983, Olson's first season.</TE>
<TE>   No. 12 Stanford 82, California 62--Julius Barnes scored a career-high
27 points as the Cardinal opened conference play at Palo Alto with an
easy victory.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Childress had 13 points and Matt Lottich had 12 as Stanford (8-2,
1-0) defeated California (9-2, 0-1) for the 10th consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Shipp scored 15 points and Brian Wethers had 14 for the Bears, who
had a five-game winning streak stopped.</TE>
<TE>   The teams meet again Sunday, marking the first time they've played
consecutive games against one another since the end of the 1989-90
regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State 67, Oregon State 58--Chad Prewitt had a career-high 25
points and Tommy Smith scored 18 at Tempe, Ariz., as the Sun Devils
avenged a loss to the Beavers last month.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State (8-4, 1-2) won its fourth consecutive and snapped Oregon
State's three-game winning streak, which began with a 62-57 win over the
Sun Devils on Dec. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Ricci had 23 points and nine rebounds for the Beavers (8-5,
1-2).</TE>

<HD>Same Old Story for Ducks</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Their first game after Tavares' resignation ends in their
13th loss by one goal, this time to the Florida Panthers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So, what it is about the Florida Panthers and the Mighty Ducks? The
mere presence of the Panthers seems to cause seismic events in the world
of the Ducks this season, directly and indirectly.</LD>
<LD>   Directly: After a blowout on Nov. 21--six goals by the Panthers and
none by the visiting Ducks certainly qualified as one--teammates Paul
Kariya and Pavel Trnka came to blows the next day at practice, a rare
show of anger by Kariya.</LD>
<LD>   Indirectly: The Panthers were at the Arrowhead Pond on Friday,
following another seminal moment in Anaheim, the unexpected resignation
of the Ducks' first and most-powerful employee, chairman and governor
Tony Tavares, also president of the Angels.</LD>
<TE>   The events of Friday, the appearance of the Panthers and the departure
of Tavares had no true relation, of course, Other than the fact it is
interesting to note the Ducks and the Panthers entered the NHL the same
season, and one team, Florida, at least has made the Stanley Cup finals
once, in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   The first game of the post-Tavares era was nothing like the last
meeting between the Ducks and Panthers. This one was tight-checking and
low-scoring, just two goals through nearly 50 minutes. It ended with
another Duck loss in the cavern-like Pond before an announced crowd of
10,696.</TE>
<TE>   Florida won, 2-1, on rookie forward Kristian Huselius' game-winner at
9:11 of the third period. It was the Ducks' 13th one-goal loss.</TE>
<TE>   Huselius, who has scored three goals in two games against the Ducks,
took the puck from behind the net and skated out front, virtually
untouched, and tucked it in past goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks and the Panthers traded second-period goals. Duck left wing
Jeff Friesen broke through at 7:36 from the right crease on a rebound
after a scramble in front. It was his 10th of the season and second in 10
games. Trnka and Matt Cullen assisted.</TE>
<TE>   Then the enigmatic Pavel Bure equalized for Florida at 13:33. With the
teams playing four-on-four, Bure beat Giguere on the glove side with a
40-foot blast from the slot which deflected off Duck defenseman Ruslan
Salei.</TE>
<TE>   Bure had been practically unnoticeable before that, flickering in and
out like a weak television signal. He had the most ice time of the
Panthers--8:11 in the first period--and had no shots and almost no
presence until scoring and later assisting on the game-winner.</TE>
<TE>   All this kept the Ducks winless since Dec. 26, a five-game stretch in
which they've gone 0-4-1, and continued a trend in which they have
struggled against the lower-rent teams of the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   "Too many nights like this, haven't there been?" Duck Coach Bryan
Murray said. "One-goal game, third period and we can't find a way to
score goals.... It's hard on all of us. It's disappointing and
frustrating and all those words, but I tell you, we've competed in every
game. Tonight, the game sits there in the third period. It's all about
goal-scoring. We just didn't finish."</TE>
<TE>   Duck President and General Manager Pierre Gauthier indicated that
Tavares had been weighing the decision for much longer than the recent
slump.</TE>
<TE>   "Tony's been thinking about this for awhile now, certainly a matter of
months," Gauthier said. "You never know what the timing is going to be on
these things. I think 244 games (Ducks and Angels) a year got to him a
little bit. It would get to anybody."</TE>

<HD>Robitaille Is Lost to the Penguins on Waiver Claim</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>UNIONDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>The Kings lost another Robitaille on Friday, this time when Randy
Robitaille was claimed on waivers by the Pittsburgh Penguins.</LD>
<LD>   The loss of the 26-year-old forward, who signed with the Kings as a
free agent last summer, is further fallout from Adam Mair's 10-game
suspension for leaving the bench to join a brawl in the Kings' Dec. 20
game against the Ottawa Senators.</LD>
<LD>   While Mair serves his suspension--he'll be eligible to return to the
lineup Jan. 15--his roster spot is frozen. Otherwise, because he would
not have had to clear waivers, Mair would have been a logical candidate
to be sent down to the minors this week when Ziggy Palffy and Mathieu
Schneider came off the injured list.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, their choices limited, the Kings designated Robitaille and
Brad Chartrand for assignment, exposing them to the waiver list.
Robitaille, who had four goals and three assists in 18 games, was claimed
by the Penguins for $35,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We're disappointed ... but we were in a little bit of a bind on our
roster," General Manager Dave Taylor said from Los Angeles. "It left us
with some tough decisions. We thought there was a chance that Randy would
get claimed, but we were hoping it wouldn't happen."</TE>
<TE>   Chartrand, meanwhile, could be back with the Kings as soon as today.
Ken Belanger, who suffered a broken left thumb in Wednesday night's 3-1
victory over the Florida Panthers, was put on the injured list Friday,
and Taylor said that Chartrand or Kip Brennan probably would be recalled
from the Kings' American Hockey League team at Manchester, N.H.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alexander Frolov, the Kings' first-round pick in the 2000 NHL draft,
scored a goal Friday to help Russia to a 5-4 victory over Canada in the
final game of the World Junior Hockey Championships at Pardubice, Czech
Republic.</TE>
<TE>   Another King prospect, Mike Cammalleri of Canada, was the tournament's
leading scorer with 11 points, among them seven goals.</TE>

last summer in a trade with the Ottawa Senators, is among league leaders
with 40 points.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Scott Thornton and Stephane Matteau scored two goals apiece as the
San Jose Sharks defeated Phoenix, 5-3, on Friday night at San Jose,
ending the Coyotes' five-game unbeaten streak.</LD>
<LD>   Miikka Kiprusoff relieved Evgeni Nabokov with 38 minutes of shutout
goaltending as the Sharks, who came in with a two-point lead over the
Coyotes in the Pacific Division, avenged a 4-2 loss to Phoenix at home
five days earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Struggling center Patrick Marleau had his best game of the season with
a goal and two assists for the Sharks.</LD>
<TE>   Todd Harvey and Mike Rathje each had two assists.</TE>
<TE>   Thornton put the Sharks up 4-3 midway through the second period when
he stepped out of the penalty box and joined the rush. He scored his
team-leading 14th goal of the season on a nice pass from Marleau, who was
scoreless in the Sharks' previous six games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 2, Nashville 1--Andrew Brunette and Lubomir Sekeras scored
power-play goals during a five-minute span in the first period to lead

1998-99 season.</TE>
<TE>   Nikolai Khabibulin made 27 saves for the Lightning, who lost their
fifth consecutive game and were shut out for the second game in a row.

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Havelid Is Returning to Form</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defenseman Niclas Havelid's career with the Mighty Ducks has been
stop and go.</LD>
<LD>  He was on the go as a rookie in 1999-2000, then missed 22 games because
of a broken finger. He was on the move again last season when a severe
knee injury finished him.</LD>
<LD>  A year after surgery to repair knee ligaments, Havelid believes he is
finally returning to form.</LD>
<TE>  He had been a healthy scratch in six of seven games when Vitaly
Vishnevski suffered a sprained ankle against San Jose on Dec. 26. Havelid
was solid in the first four games since.</TE>
<TE>  "It's getting there," he said. "Some days are good days, some days are
worse. I knew it was going to take time.</TE>
<TE>  "The training staff and I talked about that. They said it could take up
to a year to recover and to just want to be patient. It's coming slowly,
but it is definitely getting better the last couple weeks."</TE>
<TE>  Havelid's strengths are skating and handling the puck, which were
difficult to work on while he rehabilitated his knee.</TE>
<TE>  "His size limitations without the puck are always going to be there,"
Coach Bryan Murray said. "With the puck, he can add some to the offense
we need at the back end and get the puck going out of our own end a
little quicker."</TE>

<HD>TV Ratings Sink for Title Game</HD>
<DH>College football: Rose Bowl matchup Thursday represents 22.5% drop
from last season's BCS championship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Miami was putting up big numbers during Thursday night's bowl
championship series title game at the Rose Bowl, television ratings were
going down.</LD>
<LD>   The result was a 13.8 national rating with a 22% share of the
audience, considerably lower than the 17.8/28 for last season's BCS
championship game at the Orange Bowl. The rating represented a 22.5% drop
from last year's title game.</LD>
<LD>   The rating peaked at 15.7 between 5:30 and 6:30 p.m.--Miami led, 34-0,
at halftime on its way to a 37-14 victory--then dropped to 13.6 for the
next half-hour, then 12.7 to 12.5 and ended with 11.8.</LD>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the game averaged 16.8/28.</TE>
<TE>   The game got the best rating in Oklahoma City, 27.4/35.</TE>
<TE>   Next was Miami at 23.0/32, and Orlando did 22.0/31.</TE>
<TE>   The markets in Lincoln and Omaha are not big enough to be metered by
the Nielsen ratings service.</TE>
<TE>   The four BCS bowls--the Rose, Orange, Sugar and Fiesta--drew a average
rating of 10.9, well below last season's combined average of 13.9.</TE>
<TE>   The national ratings for the three other BCS bowls this year were 11.3
for the Fiesta, 9.5 for the Orange and 8.6 for the Sugar.</TE>
<TE>   "The public, with its television clickers, seems to have clearly
deserted the BCS' three nonchampionship games," New York television
consultant Neal Pilson said. "Only one game has any significance."</TE>
<TE>   Pilson, former president of CBS Sports, said it would be easy for the
conference commissioners who now control the BCS to go to a playoff
format.</TE>
<TE>   "And you could keep the current bowls intact," he said. "You'd see a
significant increase in the ratings for the New Year's bowl games because
they all would be part of a playoff.</TE>
<TE>   "The semifinals would get a 17 rating, something like that, and the
title game a 20 to 22."</TE>

<HD>Browns Commit Future to Couch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cleveland committed itself to Tim Couch on Friday when the Browns
gave him an $8.7 million bonus rather than allow him to become a
restricted free agent.</LD>
<LD>  "Now is the time to make the move. Everyone was in total agreement. Not
only is he our quarterback of the present. He is our quarterback of the
future," Brown President Carmen Policy said.</LD>
<LD>  The team announced the move less than a week after Couch had one of the
best games of his career, a 41-38 come-from-behind victory over
Tennessee. Couch set a career high with 336 yards passing and matched his
previous career best with three touchdown passes.</LD>
<TE>  The Browns signed Couch as the first pick in the 1999 draft to a
seven-year, $48-million contract. The contract had a clause allowing the
Browns to buy Couch out after three years. Instead, the team chose to
exercise its option for the remaining four years, which aren't
necessarily guaranteed.</TE>
<TE>  Couch's salary will escalate from $325,000 this year to $4.4 million
next year. He gets $6.2 million in 2003, $7.6 million in 2004 and $8
million in 2005.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Tired of hearing his coach's name dragged through the rumor mill,
Jacksonville Jaguar owner Wayne Weaver said he will start working on a
contract extension for Tom Coughlin next week.</TE>
<TE>  "Tom is going to be our coach," Weaver said. "We have talked. We'll sit
down after the season, and an extension is on the agenda."</TE>
<TE>  Coughlin's current deal is through 2003 and pays $2.4 million a year.
Weaver did not say how big a contract extension Coughlin would get.</TE>
<TE>  The coaching issue resurfaced when Steve Spurrier suddenly resigned
from the University of Florida. Spurrier has a beach house near
Jacksonville, and has often been thought to be a perfect fit for the
Jaguars.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Tampa Bay Buccaneer Coach Tony Dungy, whose mother died this week, will
not miss Sunday night's regular-season finale against the Philadelphia
Eagles.</TE>
<TE>  Dungy was unavailable for comment after Friday's practice, but General
Manager Rich McKay said the coach will be on the sideline against
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>  Cleo Dungy, 81, died Thursday at her home in Jackson, Mich.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Jim Fassel warned the New York Giants about having a letdown in their
regular-season finale Sunday against the Green Bay Packers.</TE>
<TE>  An unhappy Fassel talked to the team after Friday's final practice
ended with a few miscues.</TE>
<TE>  "One thing I told these guys this week is, 'I'm going to find out who
wants to fight when we're down and out,"' Fassel said. "I'm not going to
assume anything. Every game is different. If you think I'm going to stop
coaching these guys the last day we're out here, you've got the wrong
guy."</TE>

<HD>Janikowski, Trouble on Collision Course</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Was Sebastian Janikowski trying to kill me?</LD>
<LD>   Probably not, but I'll never know for sure. The way he roared out of
the Raider parking lot, the tires of his SUV squealing through the stop
sign, his motives were hard to determine.</LD>
<LD>   Janikowski was a rookie first-round pick at the time, and I was
covering the team for the San Jose Mercury News. I had been getting tips,
a couple of them highly credible, that Janikowski had been spotted in
bars on both sides of the bay. His hard-partying ways had gotten him into
a world of trouble at Florida State, and, when he was drafted, he'd vowed
to give up drinking. So I asked him about what I had been hearing.</LD>
<TE>   He glared at me, head-popping angry.</TE>
<TE>   "We're done talking," he growled. "Don't ever talk to me again."</TE>
<TE>   "But ... "</TE>
<TE>   "Don't ever," he shouted over the rumble of his engine.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, he stepped on the gas and peeled out of the lot. Had I
not hopped between a couple of cars, I would have been a stain on the
pavement.</TE>
<TE>   Four days later, about an hour before kickoff against the Chiefs,
Janikowski creaked onto the Coliseum turf and feebly tried an extra
point. He looked dazed. A trainer escorted him to the locker room. Not
only was Janikowski out for the game, he missed the next one with what
the Raiders said was a severe case of cellulitis, an often excruciating
and somewhat rare infection of the soft tissue. He spent the better part
of the next week in an undisclosed hospital. The whole thing was shrouded
in mystery.</TE>
<TE>   Janikowski spent part of this week in the hospital. The Raiders say
it's a relapse of cellulitis in his kicking foot, one that could sideline
him for Sunday's game against the New York Jets. Thursday, the team
signed former UCLA kicker Brad Daluiso. Teammates are concerned about
Janikowski's health--in rare cases, people have died from cellulitis--but
their patience is also wearing thin with this guy.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing is ever normal with Janikowski. Bar fights, a drug bust,
accusations of trying to bribe a police officer, strange illnesses.
Trouble is always either on his doorstep or just around the corner.</TE>
<TE>   "This thing is just weird. What else can you say?" said Tim Brown, who
floated the theory that Janikowski might be picking up foot infections
from, say, never cleaning the carpet at his house. "Hopefully the guy
will be able to come in and kick for us this week, but if not, I'm sure
the Raiders are making plans for other things to happen. We must keep
moving on."</TE>
<TE>   Janikowski made headlines in October when he took a spill at a San
Francisco nightclub and wound up with a head gash that took five stitches
to close. Police on the scene said it looked as if he had overdosed on
GHB--the so-called "date-rape drug"--but Janikowski's agent said his
client had merely slipped on a wet spot and hadn't been using the drug.
(A year earlier, Janikowski had been acquitted on a charge of GHB
possession.)</TE>
<TE>   As he had done in the past, Janikowski dodged the media after the
incident, staying in a part of the facility off limits to reporters and
sending a teammate to fetch his clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "Boy can't take it?" asked quarterback Rich Gannon, who occupies the
adjoining locker stall.</TE>
<TE>   Gannon, a meticulous professional, seems to be tiring rapidly of
Janikowski. That was evident after a Dec. 22 loss to Tennessee when
Janikowski--who had been having a very productive season to that
point--missed three field goals.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm tired of answering questions for him," Gannon said after the
game. "He's a grown man; he can answer his own questions."</TE>
<TE>   To gauge Janikowski's clout, look at the way teammates reacted when,
on the same day this week, they learned they might be without Jerry Rice,
whose father is seriously ill, and Janikowski. The widespread sentiment:
losing Rice is devastating; losing Janikowski is an inconvenience.</TE>
<TE>   That prompts a question: Why did the Raiders use their top pick on
this guy? They already had a reliable kicker in Joe Nedney, and
Janikowski came with so much baggage, he needed a battalion of skycaps.
Instead, they made him the first kicker in 21 years to be drafted in the
first round. A surprising number of Raider first-round picks over the
past decade have backfired--Todd Marinovich (bust), Patrick Bates (quit),
Rickey Dudley (moped until he was dumped), Darrell Russell (serving a
year-long drug suspension), Matt Stinchcomb (beaten out by a free agent),
and now Janikowski.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of drafting a kicker, the Raiders could have used that pick on
a linebacker or safety, maybe a receiver. They should have moved aside
and let Janikowski go by.</TE>
<TE>   That's a lesson I learned in the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Korey Stringer's agent has planned a Jan. 15 news conference to
formally announce the filing of a $100-million lawsuit against the
Vikings on behalf of Stringer's widow and parents. Stringer died of
heatstroke complications after the second day of training camp in
Mankato, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Denver receiver Rod Smith has been playing with two sprained ankles
since mid-November and says his feet feel "like a pair of Firestones
before they recall them."</TE>
<TE>   He sounds tired. (Rimshot, please.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Talk about making the best of a bad situation. Kyle Turley, the New
Orleans tackle fined for ripping the helmet off an opposing player and
flinging it downfield, has emerged as a fan favorite. He got the loudest
ovation in pregame introductions last Sunday, and recently made a cameo
appearance at a World Wrestling Federation match. Next month, he will
ride on a float in a Mardi Gras parade dressed as Uncle Sam. What will he
throw in lieu of beads?</TE>
<TE>   Miniature plastic helmets, of course.</TE>

<HD>Status Quo Working for Hurricanes</HD>
<DH>College football: Dorsey announces he's staying for his senior
season. BCS may tweak rules, but no wholesale change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't long after Miami's 37-14 national-title victory over
Nebraska in Thursday's Rose Bowl that Hurricane quarterback Ken Dorsey
ended speculation, announcing he would return for his senior season next
fall.</LD>
<LD>   Not to be outdone, Miami Coach Larry Coker also wanted to make
something perfectly clear.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm definitely coming back next year," he joked.</LD>
<TE>   So too, is the bowl championship series.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, two out of three isn't bad, huh?</TE>
<TE>   Despite the controversy that hounded the title-game selection process,
the BCS standings will no doubt return in 2002, with some alterations.</TE>
<TE>   Since being implemented in 1998, the BCS has actually produced an
undisputed champion all four seasons: Tennessee, Florida State, Oklahoma
and Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Not that there haven't been close calls. A season ago, Miami missed
out of the BCS title game by 0.32 in the standings and ended up in the
Sugar Bowl, where it defeated Florida. Had Florida State beaten Oklahoma
in the Orange Bowl, Miami would probably have won the Associated Press
title.</TE>
<TE>   Same story this time. Had Nebraska defeated Miami, Oregon would
probably have won the AP crown and left college football with split
champions.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the BCS dodged bullets both years when Oklahoma and Miami won the
BCS title game outright.</TE>
<TE>   The only controversy this year is over Oregon, which finished second
in both polls but fourth in the BCS standings. Oregon, a 38-16 winner
over Colorado in the Fiesta Bowl, believes it should have played Miami in
the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew something like this could happen," BCS coordinator John
Swofford told a gathering of writers before the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, after Florida State edged out Miami for the second BCS spot,
even though Miami had beaten Florida State on the field, the BCS changed
its system, awarding points for head-to-head wins and diminishing the
margin-of-victory component.</TE>
<TE>   It was the quality-win component that nearly allowed two-loss Colorado
to overtake one-loss Nebraska for the BCS' No. 2 spot this year.</TE>
<TE>   This off-season, look for the six BCS commissioners to plug another
loophole. The big complaint about Nebraska's making the Rose Bowl was
that the Cornhuskers had not even won the championship in their own
conference, the Big 12.</TE>
<TE>   The BCS bosses will probably make sure that never happens again by
ruling that only conference champions, or qualified independent schools,
are eligible to play for the national title.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an obligation to evaluate," Swofford said of the system.</TE>
<TE>   The BCS, like it or not, figures to remain in place through the 2005
season. Under the current contract with ABC, the four major bowls each
get another crack at the title game. The Fiesta Bowl will host next
year's game, followed by the Sugar, Orange and Rose.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It remains to be seen how long the trend will last, but bettors
should enjoy it while they can at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Large fields have been the norm so far in the winter-spring meet and
there is more of the same today.</LD>
<LD>   The nine-race program drew 109 horses, and five races drew 12 or more.</LD>
<TE>   Eight horses are scheduled to go in the $200,000 San Pasqual Handicap,
the first step on the road toward the $1-million Santa Anita Handicap on
March 2.</TE>
<TE>   Second to Tiznow in last year's Santa Anita Handicap, after beating
him in the Strub Stakes a month earlier, Wooden Phone is the 8-5
morning-line favorite in the San Pasqual, which goes at 11/16 miles on
the dirt.</TE>
<TE>   Trained by Bob Baffert, Wooden Phone, a 5-year-old, Florida-bred
gelding, won his comeback on Nov. 14 at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   In the San Pasqual, Wooden Phone should be able to make the lead
without much effort and may never look back under David Flores.</TE>
<TE>   The Bobby Frankel-trained and Frank Stronach-owned entry of Euchre and
Milwaukee Brew is the 2-1 second choice, but there is some doubt about
Euchre's participation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The sixth is an interesting maiden race for
3-year-old colts and geldings at 61/2furlongs, with seven first-time
starters, including Gold Mine, a son of Mr. Prospector trained by Wayne
Lukas; Puerto Banus, a $345,000 2-year-old trained by Baffert, and
Metaphysics, a gelded son of 1996 Breeders' Cup Classic winner Alphabet
Soup.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Lil Sister Stich. The 5-year-old Seattle Bound mare has won
three in a row on turf and tries for another in today's $100,000 Work The
Crowd Handicap at Golden Gate Fields.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Baffert. The leading trainer the last five winter-spring
meets has won with only one of his first 28 starters.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  A pick four using Don't Holler, Gold Mine,
Relentless Seller, Puerto Banus and Metaphysics in the sixth, singling
The Price Spirit in the seventh and Wooden Phone in the eighth, and using
Fadi, Apollicee and Memo To Mike in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/24. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $15/$164.80. Total money bet: $138.</TE>

scored for No. 9 Quartz Hill (15-0) as the Rebels won the championship
game of the Royal tournament at Royal High.</LD>
<LD>   North Hollywood (10-6-1) narrowed its deficit to 2-1 midway through
the second half when Raul Sigaran scored on a penalty kick, but the
Huskies did not have any quality scoring opportunities after that.
McClung, who has 19 goals this season, was selected the tournament's most
valuable player after scoring five goals in five games. North Hollywood's
Jorge Huerta was selected the tournament's most valuable goalkeeper. He
had 12 saves against Quartz Hill.</LD>

<LD>Thousand Oaks 64, Westlake 53--Kenny Glass' name was penciled in
the scorebook. His name was on the gym wall. His photo was in the
program.</LD>
<LD>   But Glass, 16, a junior center at Westlake High who was also a
standout volleyball player, died in the early morning hours of Dec. 28
when he lost control of his Mercedes-Benz SUV and struck a brick wall in
Thousand Oaks. Another Westlake High student, Jordan Bass, 16, was a
passenger in Glass' car and was also killed.</LD>
<LD>   The Warriors returned to the court Friday night, and though the
Warriors lost in a Marmonte League opener, Westlake players and coaches
found victory in moving ahead.</LD>
<TE>   "It's been the toughest week of my life," said Westlake center Devin
Entrikin. "The time on the court is a release. It's a time to put all
your worries away and try to win. But it's tough to concentrate on the
game."</TE>
<TE>   Glass had played in Westlake's victory over Warren in the Brea
tournament only hours before his death. He was a part-time starter, an
honor student and a college prospect as a volleyball player.</TE>
<TE>   Westlake Coach Rich Sanders hopes the memory of Glass will serve to
remind his players that youth carries responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lesson we must take from this," Sanders said. "Kids need
to learn to police themselves. Parents, teachers, coaches can't be there
every hour."</TE>

<HD>Speedskater: Race Was Fixed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Speedskater Tommy O'Hare wants the U.S. Olympic Committee to
investigate his claims that an Olympic qualifying race was fixed.</LD>
<LD>   O'Hare sent a letter to USOC chief executive Lloyd Ward demanding an
investigation of the 1,000-meter short-track final Dec. 22 in Kearns,
Utah.</LD>
<LD>   USOC spokesman Mike Moran said the agency has asked U.S. Speedskating
for results of its internal investigation and other information no later
than Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. Speedskating has asked attorney Steve Smith to investigate the
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Shani Davis won the race, holding off his close friend and World Cup
champion Apolo Anton Ohno. Davis jumped from eighth to sixth in the
standings to grab the last berth for the Salt Lake Games.</TE>
<TE>   O'Hare, a 1998 Olympian, was knocked off the team.</TE>
<TE>   After the race, national short-track coach Susan Ellis questioned
whether Ohno tried to win and immediately asked him about his tactics.</TE>
<TE>   "He says he was playing it safe. That's what he says," she explained
after the race. "The talk and suspicion is kind of troubling."</TE>
<TE>   Ohno denied that he was more concerned about Davis getting on the team
than winning. Davis agreed that nothing shady went on between the
friends.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brady Canfield and Tristan Gale won qualifying races for the U.S.
Olympic skeleton team at Park City, Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Canfield won the men's race with a combined two-heat time of 1 minute,
38.65 seconds. Gale won the women's race in 1:41.63.</TE>
<TE>   The men and women have one more qualifying race to determine the third
and final Olympic spot for the men and the sole guaranteed spot for a
woman.</TE>

<LD>For the second night in a row, fifth-ranked Long Beach Poly (14-0)
took down another undefeated team, this time limiting 6-foot-4
Tennesee-bound center Tye'sha Fluker to 16 points and running away from
No. 23 Muir (11-1) in a semifinal of the Ayala Best of the West
tournament Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Poly opened a 20-6 lead before Muir rallied against the Jackrabbits'
reserves in the second quarter. While Poly made only two of 11 field goal
attempts during one stretch, Muir pulled within 28-25 but never got
closer than seven points in the second half after Poly opened the third
quarter with an 8-2 run.</LD>
<LD>   Poly plays Moore League rival Wilson tonight in the title game at 8.</LD>
<TE>   Long Beach Wilson 78, East Anchorage (Alaska) 60--Brandi Knight scored
27 points, and Neka Mixon scored 18 for No. 20 Wilson (12-2) in another
semifinal game that featured 64 free throws. East Anchorage (3-1),
two-time defending large-school state champion in Alaska, made 14 of 23
free throws in the second quarter, 22 of 39 in the game. Wilson made 18
of 25.</TE>
<TE>   Chino Hills Ayala 69, Westchester 63--Ayala scored the first 11 points
and never trailed against No. 15 Westchester (8-6) in a fifth-place game.
Kia Riley scored a game-high 26 for Ayala (10-4).</TE>
<TE>   La Puente Bishop Amat 42, Rialto Eisenhower 41--Chasmine Jones scored
from eight feet with 1:19 left to give No. 22 Bishop Amat a 40-39 lead,
and one of her steal nine seconds later set up Tiffany Greenwood's basket
for a 42-39 advantage in the other fifth-place semifinal. Jones and
Greenwood finished with eight points, and Erin Myrick scored a team-high
12 for Bishop Amat (14-3).</TE>
