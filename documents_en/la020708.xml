<LD>I was talking to God the other day on the shores of Lake Okanagan.
Actually, we were having a martini together just as the sun was
setting behind the mountains, splashing the sky with pastel shades of
red and gold. His kind of sunset.</LD>
<LD>   He appeared out of nowhere. A flash of light, a twang of a harp
and there he was, in jeans and a T-shirt that said "Don't Blame Me."
The last time I saw him, he was wearing a long white robe and walking
barefoot along the beach at Malibu. I thought he was just another
transcendental meditationist in touch with the inner him, but turned
out it was The Man. When you're God, you can be anything you want.</LD>
<LD>   He comes down in a lot of different configurations. Sometimes he's
a fireman rushing into the flames to save a life. Sometimes he's a
woman going through hell to raise a family. Sometimes he's the
perfect innocence of a small child. Sometimes he's just a quiet day.</LD>
<TE>   A die-hard movie buff I know is convinced he's like Marlon Brando
in "Apocalypse Now," kind of fat and mumbly and Hollywood holy, but I
don't think so.</TE>
<TE>   What he isn't most of the time is a phony. Not that he doesn't
like the poor fools who hustle him for self-gain. When you're God
you've got to like everyone. But he's tired of being used by every
Tom, Dick and George W. with a political agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-abortionists parade him through town like a circus elephant,
televangelists shout his praise to extort money from old ladies, evil
people kill babies in his name, and now we're tearing the country
apart over the inclusion of two words in a pledge of allegiance that
probably isn't necessary to begin with. God Almighty, what a mess.</TE>
<TE>   Lake Okanagan, in case you're wondering, is in Canada, about four
hours east of Vancouver, B.C. We sneaked up there for a few days to
avoid the madding crowds. Legend says it's where the creature Ogopogo
lives. He's a sort of Loch Ness monster with a horse's head and a
serpent's body.</TE>
<TE>   Oggie has been around since the 1800s and gives the lake the kind
of mystic quality that God likes. I'd have named the beast something
other than Ogopogo, but I wasn't in charge. The lake is huge, 80
miles long and 800 feet deep at one point, which provides plenty of
space for a figment of anyone's imagination.</TE>
<TE>   "Stay out of the water when you're drinking!"</TE>
<TE>   That was my wife, Cinelli, calling from the veranda that overlooks
the beach. She's certain that after a drink or so I'm going to think
I'm a fish and dive into the lake, wiggling my little fish tail and
disappearing into the deep. A fish I'm not. A bird maybe, yes. I've
always felt that if you flapped your arms hard enough ....</TE>
<TE>   Anyhow, God was holding a martini when he settled down next to me
on the lake shore. I noticed right away he was special because his
martini glowed. Only God could order up a dry martini, hold the
olive, add the aura.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad you're here," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know you are," he said, somewhat whimsically. "I'm God."</TE>
<TE>   "Right. Anyhow, I was wondering ...."</TE>
<TE>   "I know what you're wondering, and if I were reciting the American
Pledge of Allegiance, I would not say 'one nation, under me, with
liberty and justice for all.' "</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't really think so."</TE>
<TE>   God was in Canada for a rest, he said, because Canadians don't get
all that worked up about little things. Like the "under God"
business.</TE>
<TE>   "Who cares what you say," he said. "It's what you believe and what
you do that counts." He gestured so hard that a little of the martini
sprinkled into the air and instantly turned into tiny angels.</TE>
<TE>   He saw me stare and said, "You like that? A minor miracle."</TE>
<TE>   "Er, speaking of miracles ...."</TE>
<TE>   "No," he said, reading my mind again, "I won't. Peace and love and
a chicken in every pot are things you've got to work out. Mankind is
my miracle. Use the miraculous insights I've given you. Judgment and
sensitivity are not gifts to be squandered."</TE>
<TE>   "They're not working," I said. "We're still killing each other
while quarreling about whether we're under ... er ... you."</TE>
<TE>   "Give it time," he said. "It's still Monday morning."</TE>
<TE>   I figured out that he meant it in cosmic time, that it's still
early in our existence. Maybe later on we'll decide that killing and
praying aren't what God had in mind when he slapped us together.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just saying it's up to you," he said. "I gave humanity the
power of decision. Tuesday could be sweet."</TE>
<TE>   He stood, preparing to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "Wait," I said. "One more question. Are there ...."</TE>
<TE>   "Virgins in heaven?"</TE>
<TE>   "Martinis. You missed on that one."</TE>
<TE>   "I was shutting down. Heaven is what you make it. Look around.
You'll find it."</TE>
<TE>   A twilight sheen had settled on the lake. There was a silence so
deep that one could almost hear the heart of the Earth beating. And
when I looked down, miracle of miracles, my martini glass was full
again.</TE>
<TE>   I usually only have one, but what could I do? The second was God's
will.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's to you," I said, holding the glass high. A soft breeze
rustled the treetops in response.</TE>

<LD>Gail Hottenroth and Greg Castro fell in love about a year ago, their
romance hatched over more than six years of toiling collaboratively
on Speedo products in Los Angeles, pulling 12-hour days, traveling
and eating lunch together and meeting crunch deadlines. They flirted,
joked and cajoled, nothing more.</LD>
<LD>   But when Castro, a merchandising specialist, announced his
departure from Speedo more than a year ago, Hottenroth, a product
designer, asked him to take her with him.</LD>
<LD>   "About a week after we left the company, we started seeing each
other," said Hottenroth, 37, who opened the company Flash Accessories
with Castro, 36. "We have been together for about a year. When we
decided we had feelings for one another, we had to do something. I
left the company and my boyfriend."</LD>
<TE>   Love connections are made in workplaces everywhere. Many Americans
spend a greater proportion of their lives in the workplace than
anywhere else, leaving little time for socializing or seeking out
romantic partners elsewhere. Despite fears of sexual harassment and
of messy breakups spilling over to work, people are still willing to
take the risk for love and sex.</TE>
<TE>   "A tremendous amount of intimacy is generated between people
working, living, breathing and operating side by side," said Janice
Levine, a clinical instructor in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School
and a clinical psychologist in Lexington, Mass. Co-workers bond
through "shared intellectual stimulation, the high of a meeting of
minds and stimulation of being creative together under pressure. All
of this is a petri dish for a lot of exciting things to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Little is gleaned from the limited, finely honed performance of a
first date compared with what the workplace offers: the equivalent of
an observation tank where co-workers' character, habits, ethics and
personality are revealed.</TE>
<TE>   "You are seeing a person day in, day out, and you are not seeing
them on their best behavior always," said Laral Andrews, a software
specialist who met her husband, Alessandro Chima, two years ago at a
downtown Los Angeles law firm. The couple, who married last month,
dated six months before telling their superiors. "You see these
people before they get their coffee in the morning after a really
hard weekend, and you see them when someone is unhappy with what they
did and they have to deal with it."</TE>
<TE>   In an online survey about office romance published in the June
issue of Elle magazine, 25% of the more than 30,000 respondents said
they had met their current or last partner at work. (A 1994
nationally representative University of Chicago survey found that 15%
of Americans ages 18 to 55 met their mate at work.)</TE>
<TE>   Six out of 10 people who took the Elle survey, written and
analyzed by Janet Lever, a sociologist at Cal State L.A., said they
had had an office romance. Forty-two percent of respondents said they
were married or in a relationship at the time of their affair. The
survey is not a random representative sample of American workers,
said Lever, because it was administered over the Internet and the
people most likely to respond probably have had an office romance or
have strong convictions about the subject. Still, she said, the
numbers are huge.</TE>
<TE>   Romance in the workplace has increased in the last 30 years, Lever
said, in part, because the "office incest taboo" has been dissolving
since the 1970s, when women entered the workplace in force.
Increasingly, the genders work as peers, and companies promote
teamwork and informal socializing between co-workers. Also, women and
men are marrying slightly later--at 25 and 27, respectively. Then
there is that nasty divorce rate. All of which conspires to make the
workplace a logical hunting ground for love.</TE>
<TE>   "People become friends first, and the relationship grows out of
constantly being around each other," said Lever. "There is a classic
psychology article which observed that adrenaline makes the heart
grow fonder. People are working together for years, they work late
one night and the sparks fly."</TE>
<TE>   Lever said that if office romance were really playing with fire,
people might avoid it. However "it is more like playing with
matches."</TE>
<TE>   Three percent of survey respondents reported having been fired for
their work romance. Four percent of women and 1% of men said
rejecting a supervisor's sexual come-ons had somehow cost them a job
perk, promotion or a specific assignment. One member of the couple
left the company or transferred in 2% of relationships.</TE>
<TE>   Though conventional wisdom holds that dating the boss is
forbidden, half of the women who responded to the survey said they
had dated their superior at work, and half of those said they dated
their immediate boss. Ten percent of men said they had dated a
superior.</TE>
<TE>   The potential for an office romance-gone-bad to turn into a sexual
harassment claim is a prevailing corporate phobia. But you can't
prohibit love. "Men and women know the difference between asking for
a date whether turned down or not and an unwanted sexual advance,
comment or innuendo, which is what sexual harassment is all about,"
said Dennis M. Powers, a Southern Oregon University professor of
business law and author of "The Office Romance: Playing With Fire
Without Getting Burned" (Amacom, 1998).</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every company has a policy prohibiting sexual harassment,
but only a relatively small number forbid dating between co-workers,
according to a survey conducted by the Alexandria, Va.-based Society
for Human Resources Management. Only 1% of companies have anti-dating
policies that explicitly state an employee could be fired for such a
transgression, according to the group. In a five-year period, 4% of
reporting companies said that an employee had filed a sexual
harassment claim after a relationship ended badly.</TE>
<TE>   Lever and Powers both argue that companies should have a dating
policy and/or a disclosure policy. Lever calls it a "kiss and tell
policy," which would require that a person tell a superior about the
relationship so that if someone is dating an immediate boss, one of
the couple could be transferred and so that performance evaluations
and promotions could be handled by an objective superior.</TE>
<TE>   "It protects the subordinate from fear of retaliation ... and it
protects the person higher in the food chain from charges of sexual
harassment if the relationship ends," said Lever.</TE>
<TE>   A third of respondents reported feeling uncomfortable around the
ex for two months or less.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really mad at him for six months," said a graphic designer,
36, who ended a relationship with a co-worker when she realized he
was still in love with his ex-wife. "It's best to mop up after a
breakup someplace other than work. That should be where you can go to
get away from it. We are kind of friends, but there is still this
weird sexual energy."</TE>
<TE>   Luckily for Castro, who now lives with Hottenroth in San Pedro,
the consequences of spending all those years working alongside his
now girlfriend are fabulous. Getting to know one another in the acid
test-like environment of a high-pressure company, he said, laid the
groundwork perfectly for love.</TE>
<TE>   "It was friendship first with us," said Castro. "All the other
situations with women I was ever involved with, it was physical
attraction, passion and sex first. All of that was there for us too,
once we got going in that direction."</TE>

<LD>SAVAGE REPRISALS</LD>
<LD>   Bleak House, Madame Bovary, Buddenbrooks</LD>
<LD>   by Peter Gay</LD>
<TE>   W.W. Norton</TE>
<TE>   192 pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Hefty, solid, vividly detailed, large as--indeed, larger
than--life, the great novels of the 19th century are crammed with
riches of all kinds. Who can forget the dark, fog-shrouded London of
"Bleak House" and the hapless characters caught in the coils of that
tangled legal case Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce? Or the tragic story of the
vapid yet poignant middle-class adulteress Emma Bovary? Or the
melancholy saga of the declining north German merchant family
chronicled in Thomas Mann's "Buddenbrooks"?</TE>
<TE>   Cultural historian Peter Gay takes a fresh look at these three
masterpieces in his "Savage Reprisals." According to Gay, there are
at least three ways of reading a novel: "as a source of civilized
pleasures, as a didactic instrument serving self-improvement, as a
document opening doors to culture." He fully endorses the first. The
second, "with all its good intentions and its earnestness," he
somewhat condescendingly consigns "to pedagogues and salesmen of
spirituality." It is the third way that he has chosen to take issue
with, for he believes that it can be a serious mistake to assume that
novels are always reliable sources of history.</TE>
<TE>   Do many people read fiction to learn about the historical past?
The answer, apparently, is yes. Not only do we have writers of every
stripe, from Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Hilary Mantel and Iain Pears to
E.L. Doctorow, Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley Jr., turning their
hands to historical fiction. There is also a strong tendency, when
reading realist novels of any era, to feel that we are learning a lot
about that period. Thus we have Victorian London, courtesy of Charles
Dickens; bourgeois France via Gustav Flaubert's "Madame Bovary"; and
the last of the German upper-middle-class burghers in Mann's
"Buddenbrooks."</TE>
<TE>   But are these memorable fictional renderings reliable as history?
Gay contends they are not. Which is not to say there isn't some truth
in them. Mann drew upon his intimate knowledge of the German merchant
class in his portrait of the Buddenbrook family. Flaubert was
famously obsessed with getting every detail of his heroine's daily
life right. Even the more impressionistic and poetic Dickens provides
a hauntingly real portrait of the fogbound Victorian city where the
law was too often an "ass" and poverty truly a curse.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, as Gay would remind us, reform was already taking place even
as Dickens was decrying injustice, and some of the people leading the
reforms came from the very groups Dickens satirized, like the
"do-gooding" women he mocked in the character of Mrs. Jellyby. The
19th century French bourgeois, far from being the petty, shallow
philistines painted by Flaubert, included philanthropists and art
collectors. Some even, notes Gay, were readers of "high-level
fiction, the kind of reading of which Flaubert would have approved,
had he taken the trouble to ask them about the novels on their night
tables. Some of them even read Flaubert."</TE>
<TE>   And finally, Gay contends, the highly schematized contrasts and
dichotomies with which Mann invested "Buddenbrooks" had more to do
with the novelist's philosophical ideas than with the lives of actual
mercantile families.</TE>
<TE>   The realism of these novelists, Gay explains, is a literary
technique and not the same as a historian's commitment to providing
an accurate account of reality. The historian strives for historical
truth; these novelists strove for a sense of verisimilitude that
would strengthen the aesthetic impact and emotional truth of their
novels. Flaubert in particular has been praised for his coolly
"objective" realism, so different from the warmly subjective
romanticism of his friend and confidante George Sand.</TE>
<TE>   Against this, Gay cites Flaubert himself: "People believe that I
am smitten with the real, while I execrate it, for it is in hatred of
realism that I have undertaken this novel." Far from launching an
attack on romanticism in "Madame Bovary," Gay argues, Flaubert
defends the pure, exalted romanticism he loves against the debased
version of it that leads his heroine astray. To make his argument
more dramatic, Gay goes in for a bit of overstatement: The motive
behind these novels, he claims, was not to depict social reality but
to attack it. For these novelists, writing well was the best revenge.
In offering up realism and revenge as two possible motives for
writing, Gay creates something of a false dichotomy that
oversimplifies the reasons that writers write and the ways in which
readers read. And his title, "Savage Reprisals," gives new meaning to
the word "hyperbole." But the thrust of what he has to say is
certainly salutary.</TE>
<TE>   Sophisticated readers, one would think, would not need Gay or
anyone else to warn them against mistaking fiction for history. But
not all readers are sophisticated, so perhaps the case can never be
made too often. The great strength of these essays is that they are
truly a pleasure to read: lucid, accessible, sharp, entertaining and
witty, written in crisp, inviting prose.</TE>
<TE>   Even those for whom Gay's thesis is hardly news will enjoy
revisiting these classic novels in his knowledgeable, refreshingly
astringent company.</TE>

<LD>Lorane Wasserman never knows what the workday will bring; she just
follows her nose. This day she is asked to deliver the smell of an
exploding volcano, the scent of a tropical rain forest and the acrid
aftermath of a forest fire. Not a problem for the woman who recently
re-created the musky odor of a 20,000-year-old woolly mammoth for the
Museum of Science in Boston.</LD>
<LD>   How does she know she captured the essence of a creature long
extinct? "When we had it, I knew," recalls Wasserman, 51, who
launched her Torrance-based scent company, Escential Resources, in
1998.</LD>
<LD>   Seems she did, indeed, get it right. Samples of the fabricated
scent earned a nod from scientists excavating the remains of
Siberia's Jarkov mammoth (They called it 99% accurate.) Now on a
five-year tour, the traveling "Prehistoric Worlds--Backyard
Discoveries" exhibit offers Wasserman's not-to-be-forgotten whiff of
prehistoric mammoth with the push of a red button.</LD>
<TE>   A project undertaken last year for the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington, D.C., requiring the smells of fresh-cut grass, a campfire
and even buttered popcorn, brought its own challenges. Did the grass
smell like it was just mowed? Was the popcorn buttery enough?</TE>
<TE>   The company's biggest job to date, for the "Soarin' Over
California" ride at Disney's California Adventure theme park, added a
whole new dimension to the heightened sensory input already induced
by the Imax theater setting. The flight not only simulates hang
gliding as riders "soar" over California landmarks, it is also
punctuated by bursts of scent as the journey proceeds over fragrant
pine forests and the briny ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Sold by the pound, the scent beads (each about the size of a
peppercorn) vary in price depending on the cost of the fragrances
used to get just the right smell. And each job varies in the amount
of beads needed, depending on the space the scent must fill and how
often it is used.</TE>
<TE>   The Disney job required 300 pounds of beads for each fragrance,
and given the size and daylong use of the scents, the park has had to
reorder several times already. In contrast, a small job might require
about 40 or 50 pounds, maybe up to 100, Wasserman says. The scents
are released by shooting air through the beads, so if use is constant
they wear out much more quickly than if the air blasts are more
intermittent.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a lot of fun," says Wasserman, a native New Yorker and
onetime history teacher. She recognized the opportunity to develop a
niche market--"smell effects"--for the theme and entertainment
industries while working at a fragrance house.</TE>
<TE>   Today, perfumers from several East Coast fragrance companies
collaborate with Wasserman to develop custom scents needed for a slew
of projects, concocting everything from the aromas of stew, French
fries and musty haunted houses to a "red swamp."</TE>
<TE>   Just off Crenshaw Boulevard in a quiet industrial park, her
company already has carved out business with theme and amusement
parks, museums, science centers, national parks, historic sites and
interactive exhibits. "We did George Custer's house at Ft. Abraham
Lincoln National Park in Mandan, N.D. They wanted his kitchen to
smell 'kitcheny,' so we did baked bread," Wasserman says.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to call it scents," she says of her smell effects. "I even
said fragrances ... but you're not trying to make a person smell
better; you're trying to enhance an exhibit, give it that last bit of
dimension it needs."</TE>
<TE>   Showing a visitor around, Wasserman leads the way into "the
room"--an orderly warehouse where her library of scents resides.</TE>
<TE>   "What's this?" she asks as she waves a familiar scent under her
guest's nose. Hmmm, can't place it. "Red Hots!" Wasserman exclaims.</TE>
<TE>   Shelves here are filled with small bottles of what look like
translucent bath beads. Wasserman and her team are experimenting with
adding colors, so a few bottles labeled "cotton candy," "forest" and
"ocean" show off vibrant pinks, greens and blues. Luckily, "skunk"
remains untouched, tucked in its bottle and two double-sealed bags.</TE>
<TE>   Among the more challenging assignments (woolly mammoth aside) was
an order for a red swamp from Draper Museum of Natural History in
Cody, Wyo. Typically, "a customer will put in a request and we will
take it from there," says Wasserman.</TE>
<TE>   The evolution of red swamp was more complex. After delving into
research on swamps and developing multiple odor samples, a surprising
comment from the client made her realize she was way off track. The
client had envisioned a smell more akin to watermelon.</TE>
<TE>   "So we sent watermelon-scented beads and we labeled it 'red
swamp,' and that's what they were looking for." Someone else wanted
asphalt. After the red swamp request, though, Wasserman began asking
more questions up front. So when she asked the client his thoughts
about asphalt? "He said licorice. Licorice reminded him of asphalt!"</TE>
<TE>   She's had requests for "dirty diapers," "smelly sneakers" and the
more abstract "Hawaiian breeze." Why would anyone want to fabricate
the aroma of a baby's diaper?</TE>
<TE>   Not all companies spell out the details of their projects;
Wasserman just goes with it. "Sometimes we don't really know what the
smells [we create] will be used for."</TE>
<TE>   So where is there left to go after unleashing the scent of a
woolly mammoth on an unsuspecting public? Wasserman is developing a
compact diffusing machine called the Escentialator.</TE>
<TE>   As small as a travel-size blow-dryer, it will have the capacity to
dispense smell effects through spaces as large as a small warehouse.
Also in her sights: resorts and movie theaters. "Movies are becoming
so real. What's left is scent--smell effects."</TE>
<TE>   But Wasserman realizes life is not just about work. A daily
exercise buff, she has lately been enjoying the scent of the sea,
thanks to a new hobby, ocean kayaking. "Life without smell, it just
wouldn't be the same," she reflects. "Imagine walking into a great
Italian restaurant if you couldn't smell it."</TE>

<LD>Heroes &amp; Sheroes</LD>
<LD>   Do you have a hero? Is there someone special you admire and look
up to? If there is, you know that in your eyes, he or she seems 9
feet tall or larger than life.</LD>
<LD>   Photographer Joe McNally felt that way about the rescue workers
and survivors of the World Trade Center attacks. He decided to honor
their courage by making them all look 9 feet tall, using the world's
largest Polaroid camera to take their pictures.</LD>
<TE>   The hero shown here is Louie Cacchioli, a New York firefighter who
rescued many people on Sept. 11. You can see all the heroes
photographed by McNally at "Faces of Ground Zero: A Photographic
Tribute to America's Heroes," on view through July 14 at the Skirball
Cultural Center. On Sunday, there will be a special "Heroes &amp;
Sheroes" workshop for kids 4 and up. You will be able to create your
own pop-up communities where heroes and "sheroes" (female heroes)
live. Reservations are required, call (310) 440-4636. Admission to
the workshop and the exhibition is free.</TE>

<LD>Following the instructions they'd been given for getting to the
circus, Brian, Heather and Alexandra got off the bus at Marsupial
Street.</LD>
<LD>   "Where now?" Brian said as he looked around. The neighborhood
looked normal. "Shouldn't we be able to hear calliope music or smell
popcorn or something?"</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe," Heather said.</LD>
<TE>   "Let's try that way," Alexandra said. She was much older than the
other two and had been put in charge by their parents.</TE>
<TE>   They walked for a while. Nothing like a circus appeared. "I'm
hot," Brian said.</TE>
<TE>   "Me, too," Heather said.</TE>
<TE>   Alexandra ran her fingers through her long hair. "I could use an
ice cream bar," she said.</TE>
<TE>   They heard tinkly bells playing "Yankee Doodle," and immediately
an ice cream truck came around the corner. It stopped in front of
them, and a man wearing a white smock and a brown hat got out. The
man smiled at them.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I help you kids?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "We were just talking about ice cream," Alexandra said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not surprised," the ice cream man said. "It's a scorcher
today. Ice cream bar?"</TE>
<TE>   "Sure. Give us three," Alexandra said, and pulled money from a
pocket of her jeans.</TE>
<TE>   The ice cream man reached into a compartment at the back of his
truck and pulled out three ice cream bars that were bagged in
aluminum foil and steaming with cold. He traded the bars for the
money. "Ya might get lucky and get a magic stick," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "What's that?" Heather asked.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll know when you see it," the ice cream man said as he got
back into his truck. While the kids unwrapped their bars, the truck
rolled around the corner leaving them alone again.</TE>

<HD>But, Hey, We're Still Here</HD>
<DH>After losing nearly everything in a 1999 fire, a family
counts its blessings</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUANE NORIYUKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's as if the flames never completely died. They flared again,
almost three years later, as nearby Cajon Pass was burning and Connie
Smith smelled smoke in the wind. The memories were familiar and
dreadful, as though she could still feel the heat on her face, terror
in her heart. For anyone who has ever lost a home in a fiery blast,
it must be so.</LD>
<LD>   In 1999, she and her husband, Chris, lost their Apple Valley home
to the Willow fire, which began in the San Bernardino Mountains but
lunged quickly down into the desert and to their front door. In all,
it burned almost 64,000 acres and destroyed three homes. The fire in
the Cajon Pass, before it was contained last week, would claim three
homes of its own.</LD>
<LD>   Already this year it has been a season of monsters as flames feast
upon the dry West, causing those in their paths to flee, consuming
hundreds of homes in Arizona, Colorado and elsewhere and leaving a
climate of fear hanging in the air.</LD>
<TE>   When fire claimed the Smiths' home, it took with it nearly
everything they had accumulated during 40 years of marriage. They had
moved to this place from Michigan in 1978 and bought the house in
1979. For 20 years, it was their home, where they planned to spend
their retirement years.</TE>
<TE>   Then, just like that, the wind changed direction.</TE>
<TE>   Chris sometimes thinks that perhaps he should have stood his
ground and put up a fight to protect his home. And there are times
when Connie silently mourns the loss of keepsakes handed down through
generations--antique dishes, an organ, paintings, photographs and the
rocking chair in which she held her two children; but she does not
allow herself to dwell on the past for long. "Stuff," she calls it
now. "That's all it was."</TE>
<TE>   And now there is more stuff, new stuff. With good amounts of
insurance and faith, they have started over, building a new home on
the site of their old one.</TE>
<TE>   Connie Smith saw the for-sale sign one day in 1979 while driving
with her daughter and was immediately impressed by the view of Apple
Valley, Hesperia and Victorville. There are houses that make you feel
at home from the moment you enter them, Connie says, and that is how
she knew that this is where she belonged.</TE>
<TE>   They had survived nature's fury before--the Landers earthquake 10
years ago and, in Chris' case, a tornado in 1941. Then, in 1982, they
had their first encounter with fire. Flames reached the top of the
ridge, maybe a half-mile away, but came no closer. When flames
returned to the ridge in 1999, they were not frightened. Even when
the helicopter came, warning residents to prepare for evacuation,
they did not panic. "We ain't goin' nowhere," Chris shouted back at
the sky.</TE>
<TE>   Nor did they panic as they went through the house, gathering up
their two dogs, a file cabinet drawer filled with important papers, a
few keepsakes and photos. Chris and their son Terry, now 40, were
closing windows against the smoke. The helicopter returned with a new
message: Get out now.</TE>
<TE>   "Me and Dad wanted to stay," Terry says. "but the smoke got so
thick you couldn't breathe, and you could feel the heat, and my mom
said, 'We need to get out of here right now,' so we got in the cars
and left." They drove from the fire, then stopped to watch. The smoke
was thick, and they could not see their home. A huge plume of black
smoke exploded into the sky.</TE>
<TE>   "That looked like somebody's house," Chris said, and he was right.
Later that night, he and Terry sneaked back to take a look. Pockets
of flames still flared in the darkness as they made their way. Chris
was silent as he absorbed the thoroughness of the destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like he had the chair kicked out from under him," Terry
says. "I don't remember him saying a word until we got home and he
told Mom, 'We lost everything.' " That was Aug. 29, 1999, a Sunday,
the Smiths' 40th wedding anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning Connie went to the house with Terry. They turned
the final corner, and she began to cry. She saw the ashes and stood,
leaning against the car, sobbing. "God," she said, "this is too much.
I can't handle this. You got to take care of it." From that moment
on, she says, a sense of strength and peace came upon her.</TE>
<TE>   Until she went shopping.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to the store and thought, 'I don't even know where to
start.' That was the only time I thought, 'I don't know how to do
this. I don't know how to start over.' "</TE>
<TE>   With two carts filled with toothpaste and aspirin, a potholder and
pancake turner and toilet paper and clothes and things people take
for granted until they are gone, the Smiths began to rebuild their
lives. The cashier asked if she was getting married.</TE>
<TE>   During the process of beginning anew, the Smiths say they learned
two important lessons. One was that stuff is stuff and nothing more.
The second is that faith is faith, and nothing less. "I could sit
here and be in tears every day," she says. "It was devastating, but
you can't live in the past. We came out of it alive. We have a new
home. I'm more thankful now, more appreciative of what God gives
you."</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't work out so well for everyone. Not everyone rebuilds,
not everyone ends up in a new house. The Smiths understand that, and
they describe these last three years as a time of "miracles and
blessings." Connie has retired from her job as a school secretary,
and Chris from his, installing equipment in telephone central
offices. They continue to move forward, focusing not on what is lost
or gained in life, but on life itself. Two weeks ago, they were told
to expect their sixth grandchild.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't had a baby around for a long time," Connie says.
Perhaps it's time for a new rocking chair.</TE>

<DH>The interactive Web site Whyville lures girls into the
world of science</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD LEE COLVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The mysterious spots began popping up without explanation on the
digital faces of Whyvillians.</LD>
<LD>   At first, the spots looked like freckles on the cartoon-like
avatars of visitors to the science education Web site called
Whyville. Then they developed into red acne-like welts. When users
tried to chat, an electronic "ah-choo," courtesy of the site's San
Marino-based programmers, wiped out their words.</LD>
<LD>   Dubbed "Whypox," the plague was designed to trigger an interest in
learning more about epidemiology and the spread of diseases. And it
proved to be a terrific motivator on a site dominated by adolescent
girls who are as image-obsessed in cyberspace as they are in the
hallways of their junior high schools.</LD>
<TE>   It also was an example of why an innovative attempt to mine the
educational potential of the Internet is gaining international
attention among adolescents and researchers alike.</TE>
<TE>   The philosophy of Whyville (www.whyville.net) is what its founder
calls "edu-tainment" because it taps the Internet's interactivity to
get kids engaged in learning.</TE>
<TE>   Some close watchers of Whyville worry, however, that users get so
wrapped up in activities such as choosing lips and noses for their
digital faces and chatting that science becomes secondary to
socializing. Yet researchers also theorize that those aspects of
Whyville help explain why more than two-thirds of its 225,000
registered users are female, most between 11 and 13.</TE>
<TE>   That statistic "runs very counter to what we know about girls
being interested in science and technology," said Yasmin B. Kafai, a
UCLA researcher who studies computerized learning environments.</TE>
<TE>   Educators say many girls lose interest in science starting in
middle school, apparently because of misgivings about their math
abilities and fears that they'll be seen as unfashionable nerds.</TE>
<TE>   Computer use among girls drops off dramatically after age 13,
experts say, citing a dearth of games and activities that don't
involve speed, fighting or competition.</TE>
<TE>   Whyville, launched in 1999, didn't start out with the intention of
countering those trends. But its apparent success in capturing girls'
attention has caught the eye of the National Science Foundation,
which over the years has spent tens of millions of dollars trying to
achieve that same goal.</TE>
<TE>   Now the agency is underwriting a study to figure out the formula
and how it can be improved upon in designing computer software, and
even in setting up classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Caltech's Brian Foley, one of the researchers, says Whyville's
winning combination includes noncompetitive games and activities,
social interaction and, especially, the opportunity for girls (and
boys) to create their own identities. "Those are things girls really
appreciate and look for," Foley said. "It probably shouldn't have
been a surprise that there were a lot of girls on there."</TE>
<TE>   About 500 new users a day join Whyville's population. Although
it's free and has no advertising, those willing to buy a Whypass for
$4.95 a month get priority for accessing the site. That's important
because Whyville has become so crowded that, for about 12 hours each
day, more users want in than can be accommodated.</TE>
<TE>   Those who succeed in entering see the face they've designed float
into the 3-D Whyville town square. They can remain and chat with
other users or they can visit popular gathering spots such as the
town swimming pool, the "Sportsplatz" or the playground.</TE>
<TE>   Or they can go shopping at the "mall"--a hugely popular activity
on the site--for new face parts, virtual clothing or accessories,
such as glasses or jewelry for their online persona, all drawn and
"sold" by their fellow Whyvillians.</TE>
<TE>   The coin of this realm is "clams," and they're earned in two ways:
by engaging in one of the Web site's 12 science or four math
activities or through profits generated by the sales of one's
products. A third way--which Whyvillians came up with on their
own--is for "newbies" to beg for handouts from the better-off
"oldbies." Once someone has enough clams, she can buy a plot of land,
build a house, decorate it and have friends over for chat fests.</TE>
<TE>   One goal of the NSF study is to analyze how much the citizens of
Whyville are actually learning about science through all those
activities.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it entertainment as a means of learning or is it just
entertaining?" asked Ruta Sevo, who directs the NSF's program for
gender equity in math- and science-related fields. "I doubt that no
learning is happening, but the question is how much."</TE>
<TE>   Consider the case of Whypox.</TE>
<TE>   Just after Valentine's Day, the site's designers at Numedeon Inc.,
a privately held company, infected the online identities of a handful
of the most frequent users with the pox. They also posted a memo on
the site's bulletin board suggesting that users check out " 'what's
new' at the Whyville version of the national Centers for Disease
Control [and Prevention]."</TE>
<TE>   From there, the pox spread through contact. And as it did, so did
rumors and panic. "I became sad and horrified," wrote one user,
screen name Girlyleo, in an article posted on the site's online
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Soon pox-free Whyvillians were shunning the infected. Deviously
enterprising users began offering fake cures. A lively trade in
skin-colored digital cover-ups and paper bags with eyeholes emerged.</TE>
<TE>   "I hated Whypox," said Jessica Ruane, 12, of Westwood, who
averages about two hours a day on the Whyville site. "It stayed,
like, five days, and you get, like, pox all over your face."</TE>
<TE>   But, whether or not she liked it, Jessica wanted to figure out
what was going on. So she visited the site's faux CDC Web page to
investigate.</TE>
<TE>   There she encountered a simulation of how disease spreads, a
real-time graph of how many Whyvillians had been infected and links
to an actual newspaper article about a wave of real unexplained
rashes affecting East Coast schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I read everything about it and I was like, 'Oh!' " Jessica said.</TE>
<TE>   Several hundred Whyville users then entered a contest to guess
when the epidemic would come to an end, using the knowledge they'd
gained.</TE>
<TE>   James N. Bower, a bearded, ponytailed former Caltech
neurobiologist who is the guiding force and one of the biggest
investors in Numedeon, said he is convinced that Whyville's informal,
indirect approach to education is effective.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing more entertaining than education, done properly,"
said Bower, who this spring left Pasadena for San Antonio, where he
has a joint appointment at the University of Texas and its health
sciences campus.</TE>
<TE>   "Knowledge attained through an active process of sorting through
data and connecting that to what you already know is knowledge that
sticks," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Most Web sites for children focus on either entertainment or the
traditional educational format in which users answer questions based
on posted texts. Worried about liability, the majority have banned
chat and are tightly formatted by adults.</TE>
<TE>   Whyville, in contrast, is an open-ended learning community that
evolves day to day. Users, for example, helped design the site's
justice system (those who swear or annoy can be zapped into
invisibility), write for its newspaper (one popular topic is the
ongoing rivalry between "newbies" and "oldbies") and even set up a
charity to distribute face parts to the less fortunate. (It's
considered bad taste to take too many free parts.)</TE>
<TE>   A user whose screen name is "link123" summed it up in an article
in the Whyville Times, concluding that Whyville is "more than an
educational site! It's a lifestyle simulation."</TE>
<TE>   Bower is a pioneer in the field of computational biology, which
involves devising mathematical models to represent biological
processes. But he has also been a vocal advocate of getting schools
to replace textbook-based lessons with "hands on" kits. So, for
example, kids would plant seeds, watch them grow and discuss what
they saw rather than read about it in a book.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated by his efforts to reform science education in
real-world classrooms, Bower helped to create Whyville. One of its
science-based activities involves making an animated skater spin as
fast as possible to learn the basics of angular momentum, namely,
that the more compact an object is, the faster it can be made to
spin. Completing the site's "Solstice Safari" gives participants a
feel for how and why the seasons change, and the "Geodig" calls for
categorizing rocks by their characteristics.</TE>
<TE>   The connection to formal scientific or mathematical knowledge is
not often explicit. When users choreograph a dance routine, "we don't
tell them, but what they're actually doing is learning about vectors
using the Cartesian system," Bower said.</TE>
<TE>   It's clear that not all users go to the site primarily to learn
about science.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Ruane comes from a scientific family. Her father, Peter
Ruane, is a well-known HIV-AIDS researcher at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center, and her mother, Margie Morgan, is a microbiologist who runs
the hospital's diagnostic clinic.</TE>
<TE>   But, Morgan said, Jessica is bored by classroom science at her
private school.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Morgan was shocked--and impressed--with how much time
Jessica spends in Whyville. "It's a very effective mechanism for
entertaining kids, and I have a daughter who's not easy to
entertain," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She has straight dark hair and freckles and was wearing her school
uniform when she sat down one day recently at her dad's computer to
visit Whyville. By contrast, her computer avatar has highlighted red
hair, large purplish lips, pink cheeks and a beauty mark and wears a
slinky black sheath.</TE>
<TE>   She checked her store's inventory of body parts. She's nowhere
near the most prolific seller of face parts. But she does well
enough, especially with "raspberry glossy lips." "If you want to make
money, you want to make lips," she said, hinting at the fashion sense
of her fellow Whyville citizens.</TE>
<TE>   On average, Whyvillians visit the site three times weekly, for
about 45 minutes each session, and participate in 6.7 science
activities per week. At any one time, about a third of the users are
chatting and the rest are engaged in activities that, in addition to
those involving science, include shopping, working on their houses
and redesigning their faces.</TE>
<TE>   "They spend so much time on their faces, I wonder if that's a good
thing," Foley said.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Ruane said the site's science-related activities are not
challenging. But she does them anyway because they earn her more
clams.</TE>
<TE>   Other users, however, exclaim that Whyville has made learning
science fun in a way that textbooks or classrooms never have. "Wow! I
honestly can't believe how much we learn from this site, and how much
of the learning we take for granted," a user with the screen name of
Maiko wrote in the site newspaper. "Just because it's fun doesn't
mean it's not educational!"</TE>
<TE>   In response to some of the concerns, Whyville's designers are
introducing new elements that are more explicitly educational. This
summer, for example, nutrition will begin playing a role in
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Users will have to spend some of their clams on food. And they'll
find that if they buy only hamburgers and French fries and not enough
fruits and vegetables, their carefully designed faces will begin to
fade and look sickly.</TE>
<TE>   Kafai, the UCLA professor, said the kind of informal learning that
occurs in an environment such as Whyville is difficult to quantify.
"There's a fine line between knowing something in a vague sort of way
but not being able to use it ... and not knowing very much at all,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she said, what occurs in Whyville represents a promising
start. "Obviously, this is a new medium, and we have to work and
explore what works," she said.</TE>

<HD>How One Bad Turn Leads to Another</HD>
<DH>Once sprained, an ankle becomes prone to repeat injuries.
It's just part of how the body works, but the vicious cycle can be
broken.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLENE CIMONS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Have you ever wondered why, whenever you sprain your ankle, it's
always the same one?</LD>
<LD>   It's no coincidence: The biggest risk for suffering an ankle
sprain is having had one already.</LD>
<LD>   The reason for this is a little-known phenomenon known as
proprioception. This tongue twister of a term refers to a human
body's intuitive ability to know where it is in time and space
without directly looking, like being able to walk a straight line
without looking down. It's a fine-tuned coordination that each of our
joints has, an innate ability to instantly shift the body in an
unconscious and instantaneous course correction to keep it centered.</LD>
<TE>   It affects the performance of all of the joints in the body,
although we rarely are aware of it. We may glance down when shaking
someone's hand, for example, "but the professional handshake is
perfected when you look someone in the eye," says Dr. Glenn Pfeffer,
a San Francisco orthopedic surgeon. "Can you imagine what would
happen if every time we went to shake someone's hand, we missed?"</TE>
<TE>   Some people are better at it than others, just as with any natural
physical skill, and this ability can diminish with lack of use--such
as when someone breaks a bone and spends weeks or months in a cast.
Tightrope walkers, long jumpers, ballet dancers, cross-country
runners, for example, have heightened proprioception.</TE>
<TE>   These athletes and artists perfect these intuitive skills through
high levels of training for their sport, or their craft. But
proprioception is an ability that actually develops in early
childhood. "Watch a 1-year-old learn to walk: He looks down at his
feet," Pfeffer says. "We, as adults, don't do that because we have
developed our proprioception."</TE>
<TE>   So what, then, does this have to do with ankle sprains?</TE>
<TE>   While every joint in the body is affected by proprioception, it
plays an especially important role in weight-bearing joints such as
ankles or knees. "The hands and arms don't have joints that control
your full body weight, unless you are doing handsprings all the
time," says Dr. Nicholas DiNubile, a Pennsylvania orthopedic surgeon
who is a consultant to the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team and the
Pennsylvania Ballet.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, it is a key factor in whether, once injured, we are
prone to re-injure those same joints again.</TE>
<TE>   Every ligament in your ankle has thousands of nerves, and every
time you hit uneven ground, a curb in the street, a crack in the
sidewalk or a branch snaking across a hiking trail, your brain
performs millions of calculations to ensure that your foot lands
properly.</TE>
<TE>   When you sprain an ankle, the key nerves that regulate this
process are damaged, altering the body's ability to perform this
function. As a result, if you don't do something to retrain those
injured nerves, you're more likely to sprain that same ankle
repeatedly.</TE>
<TE>   What we think of as a floppy or loose ankle that results from the
first sprain is actually a slowdown in the feedback loop between the
nerves in the foot and the brain. The brain can't react quickly
enough to prevent that ankle from being re-injured.</TE>
<TE>   When the already vulnerable foot lands unevenly, and the ankle
starts to turn, the proprioceptors--the part of the nerves that tell
the ankle where it is in time and space--send a message, in effect,
to the muscles: "Go back, go back." But often the message comes too
late, health experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The foot doesn't know quite where it is when it plants on the
ground, and can't adapt to variations in ground surface.</TE>
<TE>   And a vicious cycle begins. This is one of the reasons ankle
sprains are among the most common injuries afflicting Americans, even
among people who don't regularly engage in sports or other exercise.
About 27,000 ankle sprains occur every day in this country.</TE>
<TE>   An ankle sprain can happen during routine activities, such as
stepping off a curb, just as easily as during exercise, particularly
among those with earlier sprains. Sometimes the cause is not
apparent. The ankle turns, and the person falls, utterly baffled as
to exactly what he or she did to cause the sprain.</TE>
<TE>   The ankle joint is made up of bones held together by
ligaments--think of how a hinge keeps a door connected to the wall.
In a mild sprain, the ligaments are just strained or stretched; with
a moderate sprain, they are partially torn. And in the worst case, a
severe sprain, the ligament is completely torn and no longer able to
control the ankle joint.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of ankle sprains are inversion sprains, meaning
the foot turns inward, injuring the ligaments on the outside of the
ankle. This occurs because of the way the ankle is built.</TE>
<TE>   "The muscles on the outer part of the leg tend to be weak; there
is a large muscle imbalance between the muscles on the outside of the
leg versus the muscles on the inside of the leg," says Janet Sobel, a
Chevy Chase, Md., physical therapist who treats many athletes.
Because of this, she says, "if it's going to sprain, it's usually
going to turn in."</TE>
<TE>   Treating an Injury</TE>
<TE>   Unlike with other injuries, you will know instantly when you
sprain your ankle. Very quickly, you will have pain, swelling and
tenderness. You may or may not be able to walk on it. If the pain and
swelling are minimal, and you are able to put weight on it, you
probably can treat it yourself at home. If your ankle is grossly
swollen and painful, and the skin discolored, don't put any weight on
it, and seek medical attention immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Ice treatment is the critical first step. Appy ice within a few
minutes, or sooner, if possible, and certainly within 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   This will reduce the pain and swelling. Ice it as often as
possible on the first day for 15 minutes on, and 15 minutes off, and
for days after if swelling persists.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts believe that, after the first day, a combination of
hot and cold treatment is preferable: ice to treat the inflammation,
and heat to promote circulation and healing. This can be inconvenient
and cumbersome. Sobel emphasizes that ice is more important. Also,
gently moving the ankle will get circulation to the area just as
effectively as heat.</TE>
<TE>   DiNubile agrees: "As long as there is swelling and bruising, stick
to ice." The rest of the longtime formula known as RICE ("I" is for
ice) still applies here: Rest, compression, elevation are also useful
during the first few days following an ankle sprain. Put your foot up
to help keep the swelling down.</TE>
<TE>   "You want your toes higher than your nose," DiNubile says. "You
want your foot as high as possible. Also, I would wrap it right away.
I usually put ice in the Ace wrap." Don't go back to sports too soon.
But easy walking, as soon as you can bear weight, is essential for
proper recuperation. Start with crutches if you cannot bear full
weight; an ankle brace that stabilizes the ligaments but allows you
to walk is also valuable. Also, as you recover, it is important to
perform Achilles stretches to keep the tendon from becoming too
tight.</TE>
<TE>   'Ankle Neutral' Position</TE>
<TE>   Ligaments heal best when kept in "ankle neutral" position, in
which the foot is flat, and neither turned in nor out, nor up nor
down, says Dr. Thomas O. Clanton, an orthopedic surgeon at the
University of Texas Medical School in Houston. Another proper healing
position is dorsiflexion, in which the foot is flat with the toes
bent slightly upward.</TE>
<TE>   "This position is better achieved bearing weight than without,"
Clanton says.</TE>
<TE>   The worst position for a healing ankle is non-weight-bearing,
where the foot just hangs down (known as plantarfexion) because torn
ligaments will heal in a stretched position, making it difficult to
regain full ankle motion, he says.</TE>
<TE>   But if walking or other weight-bearing results in more pain or
swelling, stop and see a physician.</TE>
<TE>   A mild sprain can take 10 or more days to heal, and more serious
sprains as long as eight weeks. "You're really about 75% back when
you think you are 100%," DiNubile says. "You probably still don't
have all your mobility, or strength or endurance or agility."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors offer various tips for knowing when an ankle is ready for
action. Some suggest trying a skier's stance: If you can't get all
the way down in position, the ankle probably needs more time to heal.
Or if you can't hop on the injured ankle three or four times without
pain, it's best to hold off on returning to sports activities.</TE>
<TE>   Once an ankle has been sprained, especially for the first time,
the most important thing to prevent repeated injuries is exercises to
strengthen the ankle muscles and retrain--or re-educate--the
proprioceptors.</TE>
<TE>   Health professionals recommend a series of strength and balance
exercises, including exercises on a BAPS board (a sophisticated
wobble board like the ones kids play on), standing and hopping on a
mini-trampoline, agility drills and jumping rope.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't own a BAPS board or mini-trampoline--and few people
do--there are exercises that don't require equipment. The idea is to
put minimal stress on the injured ankle at first, then gradually
increase the activities to strengthen the area.</TE>
<TE>   Agility drills involve such maneuvers as shuffling side-to-side,
walking backward and running. (Running a figure-8 pattern is helpful,
beginning with wide loops and progressing to tighter loops as the
ankle strengthens).</TE>
<TE>   Other exercises include sitting with your legs crossed and placing
a 2-pound weight (to start) on your foot. Bend your foot up and out,
that is, away from the big toe. Do three sets of 15 repetitions. As
it gets easier, increase the weight and the reps.</TE>
<TE>   Another exercise: Lie in bed on your "good" side, with the injured
foot hanging over the edge of the bed, with the weight on the foot.
Turn your foot up and then slowly lower it.</TE>
<TE>   You also can use resistance equipment, such as a Thera-Band, which
is elastic tubing that can be wrapped around the bottom of the foot
as you do the bending and pulling repetitions. This should help
strengthen the peroneal muscles, the major muscle groups that support
the ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Also, balancing on one leg--the one with the injured ankle--is one
of the best ways to regain proprioception. "Stand on the bad leg
only, and try to balance on that leg," recommends Sobel, the physical
therapist. "If that's easy, do it with your eyes closed. Do it for a
minute. If that's easy, stand on a pillow, which is a mushier
surface," she says. "If that's easy, do it with your eyes closed."</TE>
<TE>   And if that's easy, she says, you're probably healed. Go out for a
run.</TE>

<LD>Summer's here--a time of sizzling barbecues and seasonal advisories
warning us to wear sunscreen, drink enough fluids, stay out of the
sun, avoid gobbling down the more than 3,000 calories contained in a
typical barbecue meal and avoid catching bubonic plague from wild
rodents.</LD>
<LD>   Medical journals have their summer themes too. Take last week's
New England Journal of Medicine. On Page 35, there's a botanical
feature titled "The Many Faces of Poison Ivy," with the pretty,
three-leaved shrub depicted in full color. Then, on Page 13, there's
a special on mosquito repellents. Which ones work? Which ones don't?
And how well?</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Mark Fradin, a Chapel Hill, N.C.-based dermatologist, decided
to tackle the issue because he was seasonally barraged with such
questions and couldn't provide easy answers. (There aren't
standardized tests for measuring repellents, he says. Each company
does it its own way.)</LD>
<TE>   Driven by the need to know, Fradin went off to the drugstore and
bought up every repellent he could lay his hands on. He also called
Avon to get a sample of its bug-repellent products. Then he solicited
the help of mosquito expert John F. Day of the University of
Florida's Medical Entomology Laboratory in Vero Beach, a place where
researchers house mosquitoes in little cages and do all kinds of
experiments on them.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of 15 volunteers, the "arm in cage" tests began.</TE>
<TE>   First, a volunteer's arm was slathered with one of 16 products.
Then the arm was slipped into a cage where 10 choice, female,
disease-free Aedes egyptii mosquitoes were ready and waiting. The
owner of the arm patiently waited for the first mosquito to land a
bite. When it did, the time between entry of arm and first bite was
recorded.</TE>
<TE>   To ensure fairness and accuracy, the test was done three times per
product, and each volunteer tried every single product in turn. (Some
arms, after all, are yummier than other arms.) Mosquitoes taking the
arm test were equally aged and equally hungry.</TE>
<TE>   The results: Products containing N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide
(commonly known as DEET) worked a lot better than any other products
on the market. Depending on the particular concentration of DEET,
they protected arms from bites for 90 minutes to several hours.</TE>
<TE>   Plant-based products mostly fared far less well. One of them,
based on soybean oil, could protect arms for about 90 minutes, as
could another based on oil of eucalyptus. But others, with chemicals
from citronella, cedar and eucalyptus, protected arms for average
times of three to 20 minutes. Wristbands treated with DEET and
plant-based chemicals performed shabbily too.</TE>
<TE>   Worries about DEET's toxicity surface every summer, but Fradin
says actual reports of toxicities are rare--less than 50 published
cases out of an estimated 8 billion applications over the last 45
years. "In many of those cases the product was applied in ways that
completely defy common sense," he says, such as a man who, every day
for three weeks, slathered himself head to toe with the chemical then
sat in his sauna for three hours.</TE>
<TE>   "That is not how most people apply an insect repellent," Fradin
says. Here are some more mosquito facts, should your appetite not yet
be sated:</TE>
<TE>   * The mosquito's biting mouthpart--the proboscis--is
double-barreled, allowing it to slobber saliva into the bite wound
down one barrel while sucking up blood with the other.</TE>
<TE>   * Mosquito saliva is filled with useful (for the mosquito, that
is) chemicals: ones that stop blood from clotting, dilate blood
vessels and inhibit immune reactions.</TE>
<TE>   * Mosquitoes home in on their prey by flying toward greater
concentrations of carbon dioxide, a gas we exhale. They also sense
our body heat, and the water and lactic acid released by our skin.</TE>
<TE>   * More than 300 other chemicals exude from human skin, and some of
these, too, may be involved in attracting the pests--possibly
explaining why some people (like me) tend to get bitten more than
others. "Some people are mosquito magnets, and they're the ones you
want to be around cause they're getting bitten and you're not," says
Fradin.</TE>
<TE>   * And something in Limburger cheese evidently attracts mosquitoes.
(It can be no coincidence that making this cheese involves a
bacterium also found in human feet, or that the original Limburger
was made by barefooted monks trampling on the cheese.)</TE>
<TE>   So, should you still have your qualms about DEET, try sticking
with a mosquito-prone pal at the barbecue or putting a slab of
well-aged Limburger in the next room.</TE>

<HD>The Biology of Booze May Explain Drinking Habits</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DIANNE PARTIE LANGE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A couple of Cosmopolitans stimulate one person and sedate another and
therein may be what separates heavy drinkers from light drinkers. New
research from the University of Chicago indicates that there may be a
biological difference in the way people respond to alcohol and that
this may contribute to their drinking habits.</LD>
<LD>   There are many reasons young adults are drawn to bingeing on
booze, but when Andrea King, an assistant psychiatry professor, and
her colleagues invited 34 young men and women for drinks in the lab,
they found that the heavy drinkers began to feel euphoric within 15
minutes of downing a highly alcoholic beverage. Since they weren't
allowed to continue drinking, they eventually experienced a mild
sedative effect when their blood-alcohol level began to drop.</LD>
<LD>   The light drinkers had the opposite reaction. The pleasurable
feeling seemed to escape them, and as their blood-alcohol levels
increased, they felt drowsy and sluggish.</LD>
<TE>   The question that remains is: Are hard drinkers born--possibly
having inherited their particular biological response to alcohol--or
do they develop it as a result of practice? "Alternatively, both may
be true," says King. "A heavy drinker may be born with the tendency
to develop sensitivity if exposed to repeated alcohol binges, which
continues to be a common practice in young adults in our country."</TE>
<TE>   The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism reported in
April that about 40% of college students engage in "binge drinking,"
amounting to five or more drinks for men and four or more for women.
Further, the institute said, drinking by college students contributes
to 1,400 deaths, 500,000 injuries and 70,000 sexual assaults a year.</TE>

<TE>   Accounting for Taste</TE>
<TE>   Overweight people may have many strikes against them--genetics,
lifestyle, slower metabolism and hormonal conditions to name just a
few. But at the bottom of the list, or the top, depending on how you
look at it, is that they simply eat more calories than they burn. And
the reason they eat too much may be that the taste of food gives them
more of a thrill than it does for someone who can easily say no
thanks to chocolate cake or a sizzling steak.</TE>
<TE>   Ten severely obese men and women and a comparison group of 20 lean
volunteers had PET (positron emission tomography) scans of their
brains at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y. When the PET
scans were compared, the researchers found that the taste and mouth
regions in obese people were "hot spots" of activity compared with
the same regions in lean men and women.</TE>
<TE>   This hyperactivity in the areas of the brain involved with taste
could make obese people more sensitive to the sensual rewarding
properties of food and could be one of the reasons they eat too much,
concludes Gene-Jack Wang, lead author of the study and clinical head
of PET imaging program at Brookhaven. Having less tasty food in the
house might be one strategy to help obese people cut back on
calories.</TE>

<TE>   Osteoporosis Treatment</TE>
<TE>   The diagnosis of a health problem usually sends a person down a
path toward treatment. But, with osteoporosis, women may not be as
aggressive at getting their bone loss treated as they might be.</TE>
<TE>   According to research that is part of the Women's Health
Initiative, half of the women in a large screening study who went to
the doctor as a result of having the bone condition detected did not
start treatment. The Women's Health Initiative is a study of the
major determinants of disease and death in post-menopausal women.</TE>
<TE>   In the new research, more than 800 women, ages 58 to 90, had DXA
(dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) scans to assess their bone density
for the first time. Slightly more than half had abnormal results and
were told to see their doctors. A year later when researchers
followed up to see who had been treated, three-quarters of the women
had gone to see a doctor, but treatment had been started in only
about half of them.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers reported their findings at the recent meeting of
the Society for Epidemiogical Research, and they are now
investigating what role the women and their doctors played in the
treatment decision. They do know that those who were most likely to
be treated had more advanced disease and were better educated.</TE>
<TE>   Hooked on Sugar</TE>
<TE>   You can lead a hungry rat to sugar water and it will soon become
hooked, quickly doubling its daily intake. Now researchers have found
that by creating a sugar habit in rodents, they may eventually be
able to explain sugar cravings in humans.</TE>
<TE>   After 12 hours of fasting, the rats were given a balanced diet
plus sugar water for 12 hours. Over the following days, not only did
the rats increase their sugar intake, they consumed most of their
daily fix within the first hour after it was offered, one of the
first signs of dependency.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers hesitate to use the word "addicted," but they believe
that the rats did become dependent on opioids in their brains that
were released when they got a rush of sugar. When the sugar was
suddenly stopped, the rats got the shakes. Their teeth chattered and
they had paw tremors.</TE>
<TE>   Although some people think they're hooked on sugar, there hasn't
been any proof that a true addiction exists. This study in rats
strongly hints at a habit-forming connection between cravings and
brain chemistry, and it indicates that fasting and then bingeing
could be an important part of that puzzle.</TE>

<HD>Clot-Busting Drugs: the Sooner the Better</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not only does starting treatment within an hour of a heart attack
improve survival rates, but administering a clot-dissolving drug
before a patient reaches the hospital also appears to increase the
chances of recovery.</LD>
<LD>   In a study of 315 heart attack patients in 20 areas where
ambulance crews can administer such drugs, researchers found that
patients got the first of two doses of the drug Retavase within 31
minutes of the crews' arrival. That compared with the average
63-minute wait for patients treated after admission to the same
hospitals in the previous year. (The second dose always is given 30
minutes after the first.)</LD>
<LD>   "Beginning drug treatment of heart attack patients as soon as
possible--even before they reach the hospital--is an important goal
because the longer a patient waits to receive treatment, the greater
the extent of permanent damage," said Dr. David Morrow, a
cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. He was lead
investigator of the study that appeared in the July 3 issue of the
Journal of the American College of Cardiology.</LD>
<TE>   The patients' electrocardiograms provided evidence that early
treatment was making a difference. A heart attack creates
characteristic changes in certain patterns on the electrocardiogram,
or ECG.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers found that 26% of the heart attack patients treated by
ambulance crews had a 50% improvement in a key part of their ECG by
the time they reached the emergency room. In addition, 14% of the
patients treated early showed what's considered a complete resolution
(a better than 70% improvement) in that ECG irregularity before
reaching the emergency room. Nearly half the patients had complete
resolution of the irregularity within 90 minutes of their first
Retavase dose. Among the entire group studied, doctors reported 14
deaths (4.7% of the patients) and three cases of bleeding into the
brain (1% of the patients).</TE>
<TE>   Retavase, or reteplase, is the most widely prescribed among the
clot-dissolving drugs that restore blood flow to a damaged part of
the heart by targeting the fibrin protein in clots. Use of Retavase
before hospital arrival was tested in 15 states that allow ambulance
crews to administer clot-busting drugs; California isn't among them.</TE>

<HD>Making a U-Turn on the Road to Vacation Overeating</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLY SQUIRES</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As millions of Americans prepare to hit the road this month, they
face one of the year's greatest eating challenges: The landscape of
summer travel is a nutritional minefield of interstate food courts,
boardwalk fries, funnel cakes, picnic tables groaning with tempting
food, ice cream stands, barbecue. All can blow up a year's worth of
prudent eating.</LD>
<LD>   But who wants to obsess about calories on a vacation? Below are
some strategies for coping with the challenges of vacation eating.</LD>
<LD>   * Breakfast like a champion. Breakfast often gets short shrift on
holidays--and yet it's the one meal that can most help keep a hectic
day of travel or sightseeing from becoming a dietary disaster. For
example, if you arrive at the airport not feeling famished, you're
less likely to be tempted by the food courts or other opportunities
for dietary disaster.</LD>
<TE>   Plus, if you're well-fed at breakfast, your resolve is likely to
be stronger by lunchtime. Aim for a mixed morning meal of whole
grains (bread, cereal, low-fat muffins or low-fat bagels) plus some
fruit and protein, such as low-fat dairy products and even a little
healthful fat (a few nuts, perhaps, or some smoked salmon). Beware
the calories of oversize, full-fat muffins and, yes, even bagels:
Split one and add a serving of fruit instead of eating the whole
thing.</TE>
<TE>   * Jump for joy. Pack a jump rope in the car for rest stops--it's
easy, compact and even little kids know what to do with it. Plus,
seeing a parent jump rope can pry a smile from the crankiest child or
the crankiest teen. Toss a Frisbee in the trunk, too; it's another
portable--and fun--activity generator, calorie burner and steam
releaser. It's particularly useful in city parks after, or in the
midst of, a day of sightseeing.</TE>
<TE>   * Make a snack pack. Think apples, pears, bananas, pretzels, dried
fruit and nuts (packed in individual bags to limit portion sizes),
whole-wheat crackers and cereal. For a protein-rich choice, consider
turkey jerky or the traditional beef jerky. "A typical 1-ounce pouch
contains 80 calories, 14 grams of protein and just 1 gram of fat,"
says Suzanne Schlossberg, author of "The Ultimate Workout Guide for
the Road" (Houghton Mifflin; $14). "Plus, chewing it is hard work so
the calories take a while to add up. And the jerky is a nice way to
balance high-carb snacks."</TE>
<TE>   * Step away from the picnic table. The seat in front of the bowl
of potato chips may be the most dangerous place you'll be during your
vacation. Scan the food choices before filling your plate, load up
with fresh veggies and fruit or whatever the most healthful fare
available is before taking the calorie-rich treats, and then find a
nice shady spot away from the table to eat. Distance also forces you
to get up and walk for seconds, giving you time to reconsider
additional calories.</TE>
<TE>   * Driving less than two hours? Go foodless. Long car trips can
easily become long snack sessions. "Boredom eating is a problem for
many of us," says Joan Carter, a spokeswoman for the America Dietetic
Assn. "If a car trip is under two hours, really think seriously about
whether you need to put any food in the car besides water."</TE>
<TE>   * Drink alcohol only with food. Doing so slows absorption of
alcohol. Sure, it's OK to celebrate a little, but stick with the U.S.
Dietary Guidelines for alcohol. That's one drink daily for women; two
for men. By the way, a drink is a 12-ounce beer, a 5-ounce glass of
wine or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits.</TE>
<TE>   * Get a refrigerator. Better yet, get a kitchenette. And no, you
don't need to spend your free time chained to the stove making
gourmet meals on your holiday. A refrigerator simply gives you
options. You can keep milk, juice, yogurt, fruit, prepackaged salad
fixings and cold cuts--the basics for a healthful breakfast or lunch.
(Call ahead; many hotels and motels will provide a small refrigerator
at minimal or no charge.) Making some meals can save money and
calories, leaving you room to enjoy a few higher-calorie foods when
you do eat out, says Carter.</TE>
<TE>   * Experiment. Remember, variety is key to a healthy diet, and you
can use your trip to extend your range. "Use your vacation to try
some new cuisines," says David Heber, director of the Center for
Human Nutrition at UCLA and author of "What Color Is Your Diet?"
(Regan; $25). "If you're in a new city, try some new types of
restaurants."</TE>
<TE>   * Carry an ice chest in the car. Use it to hold bottles of water
on short trips and to accommodate a few healthful snacks on longer
trips. Good choices: string cheese, grapes, hummus, baby carrots,
grapes, bean dip or salsa. Keep the ice fresh and the chest can
double as a refrigerator if you can't snag one for your room.</TE>
<TE>   * Plan activities. Staying active makes it easier to prevent
weight gain and offset those funnel cakes, chocolate custards, second
helpings of potato salad and other vacation indulgences. Registered
dietitian Christine Rosenbloom has planned a wide variety of
activities for her extended family's vacation this week at a Georgia
lake. Family members range from 6 months to 62 years of age. "We're
doing a one-mile run, a contest to see which kid is the first to get
up on water skis, a fishing contest, a horseshoe tournament, a
swimming contest and even a stick-fetching contest for the dogs,"
says Rosenbloom.</TE>
<TE>   * Check out the local markets and fruit stands. They make a good
rest stop and are great way to get fresh produce at a low cost while
you learn a little about the area you're visiting. Plus, they can
give you some breathing room at family gatherings, as in, "I'll go to
the market!"</TE>
<TE>   * Give yourself a little license to indulge. Rosenbloom recommends
an angel-food sheet cake topped with Cool Whip, fresh strawberries
and blueberries. When Carter wants a special treat on the road, she
orders a kids'-size ice cream cone at McDonald's, just 125 calories.
Bottom line, she notes: "If your goal is to not to gain weight and to
stay on track during your vacation, you just need to think ahead."</TE>

<HD>Guidelines Aim for a Head Start on Lowering Heart Risk</HD>
<DH>Prevention* With obesity rates rising among children, the
American Heart Assn. recommends 'lifestyle training' to stave off
cardiac disease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American children, already the fattest generation ever, should
undergo "lifestyle training" to help them avoid heart disease later
in life, the American Heart Assn. says.</LD>
<LD>   In recently published guidelines for doctors and parents, the
association recommended specific ways to improve kids' nutrition,
activity levels and overall health.</LD>
<LD>   Obesity rates among U.S. children have doubled during the last two
decades, putting the current generation of kids at risk for
developing heart disease at an earlier age than their parents'
generation.</LD>
<TE>   "People know that heart disease is the No. 1 killer of Americans,
but they don't fully realize that it's a silent process that begins
in childhood," says Dr. Christine L. Williams, lead author of the
report.</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines, published in the July 1 issue of Circulation:
Journal of the American Heart Assn., suggested these strategies to
help prevent heart disease:</TE>
<TE>   * Parents should teach their children that a "healthy plate" is
half filled with salad and vegetables, one-fourth with starchy foods
and one-fourth with protein, such as meat, poultry or fish.</TE>
<TE>   * After age 2, children should drink low-fat or fat-free milk
instead of whole milk.</TE>
<TE>   * Sedentary activities, such as video games and television, should
have time limits.</TE>
<TE>   * Physical activities, not food, should be used to reward
accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   * Instead of talking about exercise, doctors and parents should
encourage play and activities.</TE>
<TE>   * Doctors should assess children's physical activity levels as
early as preschool.</TE>
<TE>   * Physical education should be encouraged at school.</TE>
<TE>   * Parents should consider summer camps as a way to keep children
active during the idle break.</TE>
<TE>   * Parents should encourage interest in a sport or activity that
can be enjoyed throughout life.</TE>
<TE>   * Doctors should measure blood pressure in children after age 3.</TE>
<TE>   * Children's cholesterol levels should be monitored in families in
which cardiovascular health risk factors are present.</TE>
<TE>   * Age-specific anti-smoking messages should be given to children
throughout their school years.</TE>
<TE>   Young children should be encouraged to avoid smoky environments
and trying "even a puff."</TE>
<TE>   Adolescents should be warned about the immediate consequences of
smoking, such as bad breath, the smell of smoke, and nicotine-stained
fingers and teeth. Teens should be taught how to resist peer
pressure.</TE>
<TE>   * Parents should be role models in their own eating habits and
lifestyles.</TE>

<LD>What was Darryl Kile thinking the night before he died? It was widely
reported that the St. Louis Cardinals pitcher had complained to his
brother of shoulder pain and weakness the evening before he was found
dead in his Chicago hotel room June 22, at age 33.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe Kile believed that the soreness and fatigue came from
overexerting himself on the diamond, and so he didn't recognize
classic warning signs of the severely clogged arteries that a coroner
later concluded were the likely cause of death. But Kile's father had
died at 44 of a heart attack and stroke in 1993, and one couldn't
help but wonder why the pitcher hadn't sought medical attention that
evening.</LD>
<LD>   We'll never know, and second-guessing won't bring back the admired
athlete, husband and father. But Kile's death does raise anew a
question that has long frustrated physicians: Why are men so
reluctant to seek medical help?</LD>
<TE>   Doctors have long known that many guys would rather clean gutters
or watch synchronized swimming than schedule an office visit. For
example, in March, the science journal Neurology reported that more
than half of all male migraine sufferers never consult a physician
about their pain, compared with only about a quarter of female
migraine sufferers who don't see a doctor. A poll in 2000 by the
Commonwealth Fund, a New York-based philanthropy and research group,
found that American men are three times more likely than women to go
a year without seeing a doctor. And one in four males would wait "as
long as possible" before having a health concern checked out by a
physician, the poll found.</TE>
<TE>   In one sense, these statistics aren't difficult to understand.
Cavemen, presumably, didn't sit around whining if chomped by a
saber-toothed tiger. They had to tough it out and protect their clan
or risk extinction. Some observers believe that remnants of that
mentality persist today.</TE>
<TE>   "It's inculcated in men that we have to be the breadwinner, have
to be strong, can't acknowledge weakness," says Harold L. Pass, a
psychologist at Stony Brook University Hospital in Stony Brook, N.Y.,
who specializes in male psychology. "As a result, men tend to
minimize medical symptoms when they first appear."</TE>
<TE>   But waiting only makes a problem harder to treat once the guy
decides to get help. Our foot-dragging is often fueled by fear of
embarrassment, experts say. What if there's really nothing wrong with
me? I'll look like a hypochondriac. Or worse--a sissy.</TE>
<TE>   Pass has a friend who developed serious chest pain but waited
nearly 10 hours before going to an emergency room because he worried
that the throbbing might be nothing more than heartburn. One little
detail makes this story of masculine denial truly disturbing: The guy
was a doctor. (He did have a mild heart attack, from which he
recovered.)</TE>
<TE>   The pressure to conform to masculine stereotypes begins early in
life. Many of us were brought up in environments that encouraged
silence in the face of aches and maladies. If you skinned your knee
and burst out crying, you risked being called a big baby. When the
same thing happened to your sister, however, she probably got a hug
and a lollipop. Youth sports coaches often sneer at bumps and
bruises, imploring youngsters to "walk it off" and get back in the
game.</TE>
<TE>   Playing with pain is celebrated as manly and brave. There are
these examples from the sports world: Former Los Angeles Dodger Kirk
Gibson hobbled off the bench with a bum knee to hit a game-winning
home run in the 1988 World Series; Willis Reed, of the New York
Knicks, played in the seventh game of the 1970 NBA championship on a
broken leg; and Los Angeles Laker Shaquille O'Neal played last season
with severe arthritic pain in his right big toe.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, in most families women run the medicine show, which
leaves a lasting impression on little boys, says Ian Banks, a
physician in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and president of the European
Men's Health Forum. In November, Banks wrote an editorial in the
British Medical Journal explaining why men feel alienated from the
health-care system, which he calls "no man's land."</TE>
<TE>   "We brainwash our children into accepting that health is a women's
issue," Banks said in a phone interview. In his own practice, he
notes, little boys almost always arrive accompanied by a mom, sister
or grandmother, but rarely a dad or other male relative. As kids
mature, the perception that health awareness is women's work only
gets stronger. When girls reach puberty, they start seeing
gynecologists for annual checkups, which gets them into a routine of
visiting a physician at least once a year. But there's no equivalent
specialty for men.</TE>
<TE>   For many men, seeing a doctor when they feel ill simply isn't an
option. In the U.S., three out of five males with annual incomes
below $16,000 lack health insurance, while the same is true for about
only one-third of women in the same economic background, since many
are covered by Medicaid, says David Sandman a health-policy analyst
with the New York-based Commonwealth Fund, a philanthropic group. And
once men find their way into a doctor's office, says Banks, many find
it difficult to discuss personal problems with other males, who still
make up the majority of physicians in the United States. To make
matters worse, Banks says, some doctors come out of the dog-eat-dog
climate of medical school imbued with a macho mentality,
believing--consciously or not--that men don't complain, that men can
cope with pain. The result, Banks wrote in the British Medical
Journal, can be a "testosterone-driven consultation."</TE>
<TE>   No wonder some guys never go back. The medical profession needs to
do a better job of reaching out to men and making us feel like we're
part of the system. But, in the end, we have to take greater
responsibility for the upkeep of our bodies. Health professionals
stress that it's critical to have a regular physician you can see for
annual checkups and when health concerns arise. Make your own
appointments and fill your own prescriptions; you'll feel more in
control of your medical care. Finally, take action when that little
voice in your head tells you something's wrong.</TE>
<TE>   He who hesitates is all too often lost.</TE>

<LD>Fibromyalgia Aware</LD>
<LD>   National Fibromyalgia Assn., premiere issue May-August 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Overview: With this new magazine, the National Fibromyalgia Assn.
is reaching out to the estimated 10 million people who suffer from
the condition. Fibromyalgia patients, the majority of them women,
suffer from joint and muscle pain, stiffness, fatigue and sleep
problems.</LD>
<TE>   How It Works: Because patients often direct their own care--which
may combine exercise, stretching, medication, physical therapy and
stress reduction--this magazine helps them find doctors and experts
who can help. Articles emphasize lifestyle changes, traditional and
complementary treatments and research updates.</TE>
<TE>   The first issue profiles actor A.J. Langer, a fibromyalgia patient
who stars in the NBC television comedy "Three Sisters."</TE>
<TE>   The premiere issue is available through doctor's offices or by
making a donation of $35 or more to the association; a few bookstores
sell it for $4.95.</TE>

<LD>Question: I've read that swimming may be a great exercise, but not
for weight loss. Is it true?</LD>
<LD>   WILLIAM RAIBER</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles</LD>
<TE>   Answer: You're right that swimming is a wonderful form of
exercise. It uses almost all the major muscle groups and places a
tremendous demand on the cardiovascular system (heart and lungs).</TE>
<TE>   Swimming also helps develop muscle strength, endurance and
flexibility.</TE>
<TE>   The buoyancy of the water makes it especially useful for people
who are overweight, pregnant or injured (such as with leg or lower
back problems).</TE>
<TE>   As for the weight loss issue, numerous studies have been done on
this, but the results have been inconsistent and sometimes
contradictory--ranging from swimmers losing weight (and body fat),
gaining a few pounds (although the pounds are usually lean muscle
weight not fat) and having no weight changes at all.</TE>
<TE>   If your primary reason for swimming is to lose weight, I would
suggest--as with any cardio exercise--that you increase your
intensity, speed up your strokes and increase your duration.</TE>
<TE>   At a slow pace, for example, 20 laps may burn only 50 calories,
but a brisk forward crawl can burn as much as 11 calories per minute.</TE>

<LD>In the fantasy world of television drama, the signs of child abuse
are usually obvious. Emergency room doctors are confronted by
guilty-looking parents and children with blackened eyes, broken bones
and bruised skin. Beyond caring for the children's medical needs,
it's always clear what the doctors must do next--call the police.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, in the real world--though doctors are required by
law to call the police when they suspect child abuse--the signs are
not always so straightforward. Is it child abuse when an 18-month-old
is spanked sharply for crying during a diaper change? Is it abuse
when a 5-year-old girl is left home alone all day? When an 8-year-old
boy doing poorly in school is called "stupid" and "worthless" by his
parents?</LD>
<LD>   The laws governing child welfare provide few absolute answers to
those questions. However, child welfare authorities do follow some
general guidelines, of which everyone should be aware. The simplest
is that any bodily injury inflicted on a child (excluding those that
result from an accident) can constitute physical abuse. The injury
does not have to be severe to qualify--even a small bruise or cut can
be enough.</LD>
<TE>   Although controversial, spanking a child (particularly on the
buttocks) is not considered abuse unless it is done so forcefully
that it results in an injury or observable sign of trauma (such as a
bruise, welt or redness on the skin). Of course, sexual activities
with a child, including molestation, indecent exposure, fondling and
rape, are abusive.</TE>
<TE>   Many people assume that physical acts like hitting and punching
must be involved before a child can be considered "abused." In fact,
emotional abuse can be just as damaging, and the law recognizes this
fact. Emotional abuse can include isolating a child from normal
contact with peers or other members of the family; purposefully and
continually embarrassing, belittling or ridiculing a child; or
routinely threatening the child with physical harm.</TE>
<TE>   Neglect is another form of child mistreatment. It occurs not when
something bad is done to a child, but rather when something that
should be done isn't. Failing to provide a child with adequate food,
clothing or shelter, for example, qualifies as neglect, even if the
child is fortunate enough to be unharmed by that treatment.</TE>
<TE>   So, when is a doctor--or a concerned friend or neighbor--obligated
to call the authorities? And, even if not required by law, when is it
the right thing to do for the child's sake?</TE>
<TE>   Reporting is appropriate whenever there is a "reasonable
suspicion" that a child has been, or is in danger of, abuse or
neglect. (Reasonable suspicion means that, given the same
information, most people would suspect abuse.)</TE>
<TE>   Alerting the authorities is the best way to get the abusive
treatment stopped quickly. The earlier it is done, the more likely a
child is to escape serous physical and emotional injury. Early
reporting also helps break the cycle of abuse; children who are
abused for long periods are more likely to abuse their own children.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, many (if not most) cases of child abuse and neglect
go unreported--even though they are suspected. Some people fail to
report suspected abuse because they fear it will cause more trouble
for the child or the child's family. Others worry about revenge
should their role in reporting be discovered or should they be
required to testify in court.</TE>
<TE>   While understandable, such concerns are largely unfounded. Most
reports of abuse do not result in the child being removed from the
home. (One of the goals of intervention is to identify the homes
where it is safe to let a child remain.) Only when children's ongoing
safety or welfare is in question do authorities remove them from
their home, placing them temporarily with relatives or in foster care
or a group home. During that time, social workers try to improve the
home setting sufficiently to allow the child to return. Only after
extensive efforts have failed is permanent placement in foster care
considered.</TE>
<TE>   People who report good-faith suspicions of child abuse are legally
protected from both civil and criminal liability, and cannot be
prosecuted unless it is proved that the report was false, and known
to be false at the time it was made. Suspicions of child abuse or
neglect also can be reported on an anonymous basis.</TE>
<TE>   To report suspicions of child abuse or neglect, contact the Los
Angeles Child Abuse Hotline at (800) 540-4000 (from within
California). The hotline operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</TE>

<LD>The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly opposes striking a
child--at any time, for any reason.</LD>
<LD>   Although spanking may temporarily relieve a parent's frustration
or anger, and even though it may stop the undesirable behavior for a
moment, the pediatricians' group does not consider it to be an
effective way to discipline a child.</LD>
<LD>   Because it does not focus the child's attention on alternative
behaviors, the undesirable one that provoked the spanking is likely
to reoccur.</LD>
<TE>   Furthermore, striking children--even if it is a
spanking--undermines their sense of security and teaches them that
violence is an acceptable way to express anger.</TE>
<TE>   If a child is spanked, the group recommends that the parent later
explain why it was done and what provoked it.</TE>
<TE>   The group also recommends that parents who spank because they lost
their temper (and self-control) should consider apologizing to the
child for doing so.</TE>

<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>Most healthy couples who are worried because the woman is not
pregnant after a year of trying will conceive during the second year,
a new study shows.</LD>
<LD>   Couples should not rush to fertility clinics and doctors should
not intervene too quickly with treatments unless there are obvious
reasons for the couple's not conceiving, said the study's leader, Dr.
David Dunson, a researcher at the U.S. National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences.</LD>
<LD>   Infertility is defined as failure to get pregnant after a year of
trying.</LD>
<TE>   Many fertility clinics report couples coming in at younger ages,
but the new research shows that even couples in their late 30s have a
91% chance of getting pregnant naturally within two years.</TE>
<TE>   The study, which analyzed details of 782 couples from seven
European cities, was presented Wednesday at a meeting of the European
Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that only 9% of women ages 35 to 39 failed to get
pregnant after two years, provided their partners were younger than
40.</TE>
<TE>   When the men were older than 40, 16% of the women couldn't get
pregnant after two years.</TE>

<HD>Step Out of the Shade for a Dose of Vitamin D</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUDY FOREMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hanging out in the sun, letting your face acquire that nice, ruddy
glow, used to feel good. Then came all those depressing public health
messages telling us that the sun was dangerous, that we should feel
guilty about even the slightest tan. Well, fellow sun worshipers, the
sad truth is that, as a general rule, we should still practice "safe
sun" much of the time.</LD>
<LD>   But there's a new ray of hope--dare we say "sunshine"?--in the
form of a modest but significant shift in medical thinking toward the
view that some unprotected sun exposure may actually be a good thing.</LD>
<LD>   "In my opinion," says Dr. Robert Stern, chief of dermatology at
Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, "it's probably true
that for people over 40, even people who have had a non-melanoma skin
cancer, we have oversold the idea of having to be sun-phobic. For
them, modest exposure has little risk."</LD>
<TE>   For kids, cautions Stern, it's another matter--excessive childhood
exposure to sunlight has been linked to later basal- and
squamous-cell skin cancers, as well as to melanoma, a more serious
form of skin cancer. The rationale for the some-sun-is-good point of
view, supported by a number of recent articles in medical journals,
is that the vitamin D made in the skin in response to ultraviolet B
radiation may protect against certain diseases, including cancer of
the breast, colon and prostate.</TE>
<TE>   Sunlight may even be an effective treatment for some diseases. In
a recent study published in the journal Lancet, Dr. Michael F.
Holick, an endocrinologist and leading vitamin D researcher at Boston
University School of Medicine, and others showed that exposing people
with mildly high blood pressure to UV-B can lower blood pressure,
perhaps by correcting an underlying vitamin D deficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Before we get in too deep here, let's be clear. It's vitamin D
that has the real benefit, not sunlight per se, which means you can
take vitamin D supplements, especially in the winter if you live at
higher latitudes and especially if you have dark skin (which makes
less vitamin D). It's very tough to get enough vitamin D from your
diet unless you consume lots of fish liver oil, the flesh of fatty
fish such as salmon, and fortified milk and cereals.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, vitamin D is not a vitamin at all in the normal sense
but is a steroid-like hormone made--after exposure to the UV-B rays
from sunlight--from a precursor of cholesterol in the skin. After an
inactive form of vitamin D is made in the skin, it is transformed in
the liver and kidney to the active or hormonal form called 1,25
dihydroxy vitamin D. Indeed, several teams of researchers have
recently found that the organs in which vitamin D seems to reduce
cancer risk, such as the breast, prostate and colon, can also make
their own stores of the vitamin's active form, an important finding.</TE>
<TE>   Like other hormones, vitamin D works by fitting into specialized
receptors on cells in many organs of the body and has numerous
biological effects, the most important one being to aid in the
absorption of dietary calcium. When a person has enough vitamin D in
his or her system, the intestines can absorb 30% of the calcium
available in the diet; without enough vitamin D, this drops to 10%,
Holick says. The consequences of insufficient vitamin D can be
serious. When the body can't absorb enough calcium from the diet, it
steals calcium from the bones to restore proper levels in the blood,
a process that weakens bones, often leading to osteoporosis. Low
levels of vitamin D can also lead to weak and achy muscles, as well
as generalized bone pain, symptoms often misdiagnosed as
fibromyalgia.</TE>
<TE>   Just as important as its effects on calcium and bone is the fact
that vitamin D helps regulate many basic cell processes, says Dr.
David Feldman, an endocrinologist and vitamin D researcher at
Stanford University School of Medicine. By acting on specific regions
of DNA called vitamin D response elements, it helps control the
biochemical signals that tell cells when to divide, when to stop
dividing and when to die--all processes that are crucial in both
normal and malignant cells. Vitamin D as a supplement has also been
shown to be extremely effective at preventing Type 1 diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps the most intriguing evidence of vitamin D's importance
comes from studies of sun exposure and cancer.</TE>
<TE>   In the March 15 issue of Cancer, William Grant, by day an
atmospheric scientist at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton,
Va., and by night an independent researcher, published a study
showing that the geographic distribution of many cancers varies with
UV-B exposure.</TE>
<TE>   Since the early 1980s, Grant notes, scientists have been gathering
evidence that some types of cancer--most notably, cancer of the
breast, colon, ovary and prostate, as well as non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma--are higher in Americans who live in the least sunny
regions. "What I did was basically take two maps and put them
together," Grant says of his latest study. This showed that in
addition to the cancers already known to vary with UV-B exposure,
there appear to be many others (bladder, esophagus, kidney, rectum,
stomach and uterus) that also increase as sunlight decreases.</TE>
<TE>   Other researchers, too, have found links between sun exposure and
cancer. And this March, researchers from the National Cancer
Institute found that Americans living in sunny areas were
significantly less likely to die from (not just get) cancers of the
breast, ovary, prostate and colon. Not surprisingly, the team found,
high levels of sun exposure were also linked to the milder
(non-melanoma) types of skin cancer too.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line? If you're extremely fair-skinned, all it takes
for your skin to make enough vitamin D is about 15 minutes a day in
the sun, without sunscreen, at noon, says Holick. If you're extremely
dark-skinned, it may take considerably more than that. How much sun
you should get depends on your skin type and sensitivity to sun--if
you burn readily, you may be able to tolerate only five minutes in
the sun, and that would be enough.</TE>
<TE>   And if you'd rather just take vitamin D supplements? That's
fine--the general guidelines are 200 IUs a day if you're 50 or under,
400 if you're between 50 and 70, and 600 IUs if you're over 70, says
Tufts University epidemiologist Susan Harris. Some researchers even
recommend 800 to 1,000 IUs a day. The risks of overdosing are small,
adds Reinhold Vieth, a biochemist and vitamin D researcher at Mount
Sinai Hospital in Toronto, who believes it would take tens of
thousands of IUs for long periods to become a problem. Still, to be
on the safe side, many researchers suggest limiting vitamin D intake
to 2,000 IUs a day.</TE>

<AU>Judy Foreman</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vitamin D is part of one theory for the evolution of different skin
colors among humans.</LD>
<LD>   Human beings arose with black skins in Africa and then migrated
outward from there. Black skin is rich in melanin, a pigment that
acts as a natural sunscreen, protecting against sunburn.</LD>
<LD>   But, just like sunscreen of SPF 8 or higher, melanin reduces the
amount of vitamin D the skin can make. That's fine for someone in
Africa who spends lots of time in the sun. Farther from the equator,
however, people with light skin gain an evolutionary advantage. With
less available UV-B, light skin probably evolved so that humans
migrating northward would still be able to make enough vitamin D.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, people who failed to make this adaptation would have had a
difficult time reproducing. Insufficient vitamin D can lead to
rickets, which causes defective bone growth. In women, this can mean
such poor pelvic development that babies could not be born--and the
mother's genes would not be passed on.</TE>

<HD>Banishing the Red Scourge of Old Age</HD>
<DH>Researchers say they can now reduce the risk of shingles, a
virus left over from chickenpox that lies in wait in nerve cells and
often strikes seniors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENEDICT CAREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though the itchy red spots usually come and go within a week or two,
becoming just another childhood memory, the chickenpox virus itself
never leaves the body. Lying low in nerve cells, it often surfaces
again decades later, causing an outbreak of painful blisters and
rashes called shingles.</LD>
<LD>   Especially among older adults, shingles is a quiet plague: It
strikes about one in 100 Americans over the age of 65 each year,
researchers estimate, and can erupt almost anywhere on the body. By
the time the rashes clear, doctors say, the underlying skin can be
discolored, or slightly numb.</LD>
<LD>   "The nerve damage can be permanent," said Dr. Ann Arvin, a
pediatrician and infectious disease researcher at Stanford University
School of Medicine, "even when people get treatment with anti-viral
drugs."</LD>
<TE>   Doctors now suspect they can do better than treatment--preventing
shingles altogether, in many people, by using the childhood
chickenpox vaccine now given to millions of youngsters. In a study
published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine, Arvin and
a team of researchers reported that the vaccine reduced the risk of
shingles in a group of cancer patients, who are at high risk of
developing the rash due to weakened immunity. The vaccine--like
chickenpox itself--stokes the body's immunity to the virus, keeping
the skin outbreaks in check.</TE>
<TE>   The study included 111 cancer patients who were due to receive a
bone marrow transplant to fight their disease. About half the
patients got the chickenpox vaccine before the transplant; the other
half got no vaccine. A year later, fully a third of those who were
not vaccinated had developed shingles, while only 13% of the
vaccinated group had developed the rashes. Arvin expects the vaccine
to work similarly in people with AIDS, leukemia and other conditions
that weaken the immune system.</TE>
<TE>   That includes normal aging. Over time, the number of immune cells
that recognize the chickenpox virus decreases, Arvin said. "You don't
have to have any underlying disease for this to happen; it's simply a
part of aging," she said. "This is why the risk of developing
shingles increases with each decade, we believe." About half of those
who live to age 85 will have had at least one bout of shingles in
their lives, doctors say.</TE>
<TE>   Already the government is funding a nationwide study, including
more than 38,000 people age 60 and older, to see whether routine
vaccinations of older adults will significantly reduce the incidence
of shingles.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes very good sense," said the study's director, Dr. Michael
Oxman, an infectious disease specialist at the San Diego Veterans
Affairs Medical Center. "The bottom line is that the older you are,
the worse the pain is. The pain may last for months or even years
after the rashes have gone and it doesn't respond to any treatment
that older people can tolerate."</TE>
<TE>   The impact of shingles on people's lives is not widely
appreciated, doctors say. It's neither as frightening nor harmful as
other viral diseases such as AIDS and hepatitis C, and the government
doesn't even track outbreaks of the rashes. Nonetheless, its
sufferers know the story--and the value of prevention. "This is the
kind of thing that destroys the lives of people who are looking
forward to traveling and doing other things for retirement," said
Oxman.</TE>

candlelight dinners hasn't worked its romantic magic, perhaps a
mutual background in psychotherapy will lead to a lasting
relationship. That's the premise, at least, behind TheraDate, a
fledgling matchmaking service designed exclusively for people who are
in analysis.</LD>
<LD>   The idea isn't as farfetched as it may sound. Many therapists say
that single clients occasionally ask them if they know of anyone who
might make a good romantic match. The thinking, of course, is that
therapists know a great deal about their patients--their unresolved
issues, neuroses and the like--and are in a good position to identify
a compatible partner.</LD>
<LD>   Ethically, though, psychotherapists are not supposed to get
involved in their patients' personal lives outside the confines of
their offices. TheraDate attempts to sidestep this dilemma by not
allowing therapists to do the actual matchmaking themselves.</LD>
<TE>   "There's bound to be a lot more compatibility among a group of
bright, verbal, high achievers who value self-reflection and are
smart enough to be using therapy to improve their lives," says
TheraDate's founder, Frederick B. Levenson, a psychoanalyst in
Manhattan. "And who are better qualified to do this than therapists,
who've devoted their lives to understanding relationships?"</TE>
<TE>   TheraDate was launched this spring with small advertisements in
New York and Los Angeles magazines, a Web site (www.theradate.com)
and letters of introduction to 20,000 therapists in Los Angeles and
another 38,000 in New York. Since then, about 200 people have signed
up for the service in each city, including a lot of therapists
themselves, according to Levenson.</TE>
<TE>   The program is open only to those who have been in therapy for at
least two months, or who have been in therapy at some time within the
last two years. It's also restricted to people trying to cope with
more mundane difficulties, such as problems at work or in romantic
relationships, not those with more serious problems, such as violent
tendencies, emotional disturbances or substance abuse.</TE>
<TE>   No couples have actually been fixed up through TheraDate, Levenson
says, because he is waiting until the service has a large enough pool
of patients--about 500 or so--to make compatible matches.</TE>
<TE>   Membership will cost $800 a year for eight matches. (Levenson
initially set a rate of $2,000, but has since dropped the rate to
$800 as part of a "summer price special.")</TE>
<TE>   Working with participating therapists, patients will fill out a
confidential 10-page survey that delves much more deeply than the
usual dating service inventories, which may include embellished
resumes--"Harvard MBA"--and preferences--"enjoys walks on the
beach"--that don't reveal much about someone's character.</TE>
<TE>   The survey asks questions about family history, birth order,
parental relationships, education, sibling rivalries and religion, as
well as such questions as "What are your defense mechanisms?" and
"What are your personality factors?" These more in-depth
psychological profiles should result in better matches, according to
Levenson, a certified psychoanalyst who has a doctoral degree from
the California Graduate Institute in Los Angeles. The completed forms
are reviewed by TheraDate counselors, who look for singles with
complementary traits.</TE>
<TE>   "For a relationship to endure," says Levenson, "people need to
have similar psychodynamics--the notion that opposites attract is a
myth."</TE>
<TE>   Once patients have been matched with possible dates, both people
are given each other's phone number and the next step is up to them.</TE>
<TE>   The TheraDate team has done some dry runs for training purposes
and to see how the system works, mixing confidential surveys from
clients, friends and family, with those of couples they know in
successful marriages. "We wound up matching these couples with each
other almost 90% of the time," says Levenson, who believes that
hooking up people who've been in therapy can reduce the divorce rate.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone, however, thinks that therapists are the best judges
of someone's dating prospects. "Therapy is designed to help people
resolve difficulties," says Leon Vandecreek, a psychologist at Wright
State University in Dayton, Ohio. "But that process doesn't always
reveal what someone would be like in a relationship."</TE>
<TE>   Therapists' involvement in patients' personal lives may also
overstep ethical boundaries. "The goal of psychotherapy is to
diagnose and treat psychological disturbances, not to give report
cards for how one lives life or communicates with others," says
Judith Coche, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   And if a date turns out to be a disaster, it could come back to
haunt the therapist. Most people can laugh it off when a friend fixes
them up with someone they perceive to be a loser. It may not seem
quite so funny, however, when they're matched up with a string of
unsuitable partners based on their therapist's evaluation. Meeting a
potential mate through a therapist, even indirectly, may take on
greater importance and heighten expectations, which can magnify
feelings of rejection or disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "If things go badly," says Thomas F. Nagy, a clinical psychology
professor at Stanford University in Palo Alto, "the tendency is to
hold the therapist accountable."</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what goes wrong, the therapist gets blamed for
everything anyway," counters Levenson. The dating service, he says,
is no more an intrusion into a patient's personal life than, say,
when a therapist agrees to fill out a college recommendation for a
client.</TE>
<TE>   Despite some therapists' reservations, TheraDate seems to have
struck a responsive chord among those looking for love. In the last
three months, the service's Web site has had 500,000 hits, according
to Levenson, and people have tried to register from as far away as
Finland and India.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Randall, for one, a secretary in Freeport, N.Y., found the
concept appealing. After spending $750 to join a matchmaking service
several years ago, where she failed to make a connection, the
55-year-old divorcee was disenchanted with conventional dating
services.</TE>
<TE>   "People tend to exaggerate, but when a therapist is doing it, it
will be more truthful," says Randall, who also liked the idea she'd
be matched up with someone who was sensitive enough to go into
therapy. "Opportunities to meet appropriate people diminish as you
get older."</TE>

<HD>Stretch--and Breathe Deeply--to Banish Stress</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>KAREN VOIGHT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Have you noticed that, when you're under pressure or frightened, your
breathing and heart rate speed up? At first you might hold your
breath, and then you'll take fast, shallow breaths; your blood
pressure rises and your muscles tighten. It's an all too common
reaction to everyday stress, whether physical or emotional. Because
life is filled with so many of these tense moments, shallow breathing
may have become second nature to you.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, short breaths don't provide enough oxygen to your
muscles, which, in turn, causes more stress to the body. Over time,
this self-perpetuating cycle zaps your energy, disrupts your
concentration and taxes your nervous system.</LD>
<LD>   Luckily, there's a healthier way to respond to stress. The first
thing you need to do is to gain control over your breathing. Think
about how many times you've heard someone say, "Now, take a deep
breath and relax." Remember how this calmed you down so you were
better able to deal with the situation at hand.</LD>
<TE>   This may sound easy, but it takes practice to be able do it when
it counts. Through deep, smooth breathing you can slow your heart
rate and reduce anxiety. You'll feel more productive and energetic
and better able to cope with whatever surprises come your way.</TE>
<TE>   A good time to practice slowing down and breathing deeply is while
we stretch. It makes stretching much more effective and enjoyable.
And the more frequently we put our bodies in a relaxed state, the
easier it is to stay focused and calm in stressful situations.</TE>
<TE>   Here are two stretches that you can use to practice breathing and
relaxing at the same time. In each of these positions, concentrate on
the following breathing tips:</TE>
<TE>   * Look downward or close your eyes.</TE>
<TE>   * Keep your tongue soft and off the palate.</TE>
<TE>   * Relax your jaw and unclench your teeth.</TE>
<TE>   * When you inhale, think of pulling the air down toward your
abdomen letting it expand, send the same inhalation into your rib
cage, making it wider, and then into your upper chest. When you
exhale, gently let the air move down your body, let your rib cage
soften and relax as you flatten your abdomen pressing your navel
toward the spine.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting Side Bend</TE>
<TE>   Sitting on a bench or a sturdy surface, turn your legs out to a
45-degree angle and place your feet under your knees. Raise your left
arm straight up toward the ceiling and place your right arm in front
of your right thigh. Begin with an inhalation as you sit as tall as
you can.</TE>
<TE>   On an exhalation, bend your torso to the right. Feel a deep
stretch on the left side of your torso as you continue to bend. Make
sure both hips stay level on the bench. Look down toward the floor
but keep your chest facing front. Don't let your top shoulder roll
forward. Stay in this position and breathe deeply for 15 to 20
seconds. Every time you breathe in, focus on lifting the top arm and
expanding across your rib cage. On your exhalations, move the top
shoulder farther away from your left hipbone, creating more length to
the left side of your torso.</TE>
<TE>   When you are ready to come out of this stretch, inhale and slowly
move your body to an upright position. Lower your arm, exhale and
relax. Repeat on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   Kneeling Side Bend</TE>
<TE>   With your torso upright, kneel on your left knee and extend your
right leg to the side. Place your right hand on your right leg, just
below the knee. Inhale and lift your left arm toward the ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   On an exhalation, slowly bend your torso toward your right leg. As
you do this stretch, keep your hips over your left knee instead of
letting them move backward. Keep both your hip bones and shoulders
facing front. Look down, and feel a deep stretch on the left side of
your torso. Stay in this position for 15 to 20 seconds breathing
deeply and fully.</TE>
<TE>   On every inhalation, focus on lifting the top arm and expanding
across your rib cage. On your exhalations, move the top shoulder
farther away from your hipbone, creating more length to the left side
of your torso.</TE>
<TE>   When you are ready to come out of this stretch, inhale and slowly
move your torso to an upright position. Lower your arm and relax.
Repeat on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   A relaxed mind and calm breathing can help you remain steady in
spite of life's many demands. By taking the time to stretch, you can
create an internal rhythm that will transfer to other aspects of your
life. You'll go from being frazzled to being focused, with a sense of
sanity that once might have eluded you.</TE>

<HD>Wisconsin Town Revives the Dead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Compiled by Times staff writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dead will live again after all. Now that concert promoter Clear
Channel Entertainment has ponied up a $100,000 bond to cover the cost
of added security, "Terrapin Station--A Grateful Dead Family Reunion"
will take place Aug. 3 and 4 at the Alpine Valley Music Theatre in
East Troy, Wis.</LD>
<LD>   It will be the first time surviving Grateful Dead singer-guitarist
Bob Weir, bassist Phil Lesh and drummers Mickey Hart and Bill
Kreutzmann have played together since guitarist and singer Jerry
Garcia died in 1995. They will play as the Other Ones on a bill also
including Weir's band RatDog, Kreutzmann's TriChromes, Hart's band
Bende Orisha, Phil Lesh &amp; Friends and "lots of side bands," according
to Grateful Dead spokesman Dennis McNally.</LD>
<LD>   Fans gobbled up all the tickets--somewhere between 60,000 and
70,000, according to Clear Channel--when they went on sale early in
June, only to find out that the promoter didn't have all the
clearances it needed from municipal agencies. Officials in Walworth
County, worried about a repeat of the overcrowding they said occurred
at a 1989 appearance by the Dead at the same venue, initially
threatened to pull the plug on the shows because they said Clear
Channel hadn't secured their permission before announcing the event.</LD>
<TE>   Clear Channel and local police are warning fans not to show up
hoping to buy tickets at the gate or to otherwise attempt to crash
the party.</TE>
<TE>   "Depending on how things go, there is every possibility of
additional shows, lots of them," McNally said. "I can't confirm any
specifics for after Aug. 4, but I can confirm that's what is utterly
critical for anyone who considers themselves Deadheads: If you don't
have a ticket, you simply can't come. You won't get within a mile of
the facility without a ticket in your hand. That's the promise we had
to make. If you do show up without a ticket, you are a saboteur, and
you are putting at risk our 30 years as a respecting community."</TE>
<TE>   Those who didn't score tickets might find some solace with a new
four-CD set arriving in stores Tuesday, "Steppin' Out With the
Grateful Dead--England '72." It contains two songs not included in
previous Dead concert recordings: "Rockin' Pneumonia and the Boogie
Woogie Flu" and "Hey Bo Diddley."</TE>
<TE>   Grateful Dead trivia buffs will recognize "Steppin' Out" as the
working title of the 1972 live album eventually released as "Europe
'72," a three-LP set drawn from stops on the same tour. This year
marks the 35th anniversary of the release of the band's debut album,
"The Grateful Dead."</TE>

<HD>Zanuck Aims to Divide and Conquer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Compiled by Times staff writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At first glance, it could seem a producer's worst nightmare: watching
two of his movies debut on the same weekend and slug it out
head-to-head at the box office.</LD>
<LD>   Yet that's the predicament producer Richard D. Zanuck finds
himself in as DreamWorks' gangland drama "The Road to Perdition"
opens Friday opposite Touchstone Pictures' new fantasy
action-adventure "Reign of Fire."</LD>
<LD>   Zanuck, the son of late legendary 20th Century Fox studio mogul
Darryl F. Zanuck and patriarch of his own budding filmmaking dynasty,
is a producer on both movies.</LD>
<TE>   Zanuck produced "The Road to Perdition" with one of his grown
sons, Dean, and the film's director, Oscar winner Sam Mendes. On
"Reign of Fire," Zanuck joined his wife, noted filmmaker Lili Fini
Zanuck, in producing duties along with Spyglass Entertainment Group
co-chairmen Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum.</TE>
<TE>   So is this a rare case of a producer watching one of his movies
cannibalize the other? Not necessarily, say Hollywood observers.</TE>
<TE>   "Reign of Fire" is a PG-13-rated summer-popcorn film about
fire-breathing dragons terrorizing present-day London, said
box-office tracker Paul Dergarabedian, while "The Road to Perdition"
is an Oscar-caliber, R-rated film starring Tom Hanks as a mob hit
man.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many more dissimilarities to these movies than
similarities, so they are not really competing against each other,"
said Dergarabedian, the president of Exhibitor Relations Co. "It just
so happens they are hitting the marketplace simultaneously, but they
shouldn't be concerned that these films are going to cannibalize each
other since they are chasing two entirely different types of
audiences."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it is rare that two studios pick the same release date when
producers are as prominent as Zanuck and his wife, whose 1989 film,
"Driving Miss Daisy," won the Academy Award for best picture.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone would want to make them mad," Dergarabedian
said.</TE>

<HD>PBS Uses 'Wide Angle' Lens to Take Global Snapshots</HD>
<DH>Television* Each show in 10-week debut combines a
documentary, interview to focus on a single issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA BRENNAN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PBS' documentary-interview program "Wide Angle" premieres Thursday
with two missions:</LD>
<LD>   The first is to take an in-depth look each week at a global issue
that could affect Americans.</LD>
<LD>   The second: to get people to watch the show--in the summertime,
when people are more likely to be thinking of baseball and the beach
than global problems.</LD>
<TE>   "Wide Angle," given a 10-week run, will be hosted alternately by
British veteran news-anchor Daljit Dhaliwal, recently hired by CNN
International, and James P. Rubin, former assistant secretary of
state.</TE>
<TE>   Executive producer Stephen Segaller, of New York's WNET, called
the program "a kind of weird hybrid" but wants to make "Wide Angle" a
continuing series. He said it will begin by briefly putting into
context a 42- to 45-minute documentary--originally commissioned
films, international co-productions or acquisitions--focusing on
events that could have global significance.</TE>
<TE>   "The filmmakers we've commissioned have done wonderful work and
won every important award," said Segaller. "What we're after is a
combination of a great filmmaker and an important, timely story."</TE>
<TE>   Using narrators but not on-camera reporters, the documentaries
will focus on the people and issues behind news stories and relate
them to events and trends. After each film, the host will interview a
guest with expertise in that field.</TE>
<TE>   "When I originated the idea for this series, I wanted to go for
broke, as it were," said British-born Segaller. "It's all
international, and if we've got 45 minutes of reportage, the missing
component to add is to have the rest of [the show] bring it home to
the American audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually the object is to have two guests who sit there and
disagree with each other. My objective is to present a sense of why
this story matters to American viewers. Clearly when you pick a
guest, you get one point of view, but the job of the host is to ask
the right questions."</TE>
<TE>   The opening hour, hosted by Rubin, will focus on Saddam Hussein's
weapons of repression and the wider threat they imply. "Saddam's
Ultimate Solution" is produced by British filmmaker Gwynne Roberts,
the first Western journalist to enter northern Iraq after the Gulf
War and who has filmed there over the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   The film will look at Iraqi Kurdistan, where Hussein has been
waging a genocidal attack using biological weapons. Segaller believes
that "in the event of a war with Saddam, the Kurds will be a vital
force, perhaps the next Northern Alliance."</TE>
<TE>   The second program will focus on China's economy.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin has served as assistant secretary of state and chief State
Department spokesman; as a State Department policy advisor and senior
advisor; and as spokesman for Madeleine K. Albright, the former U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations and former U.S. secretary of state.
Rubin has spent time in front of television cameras, but not as a
journalist.</TE>
<TE>   "For me it's a big challenge," he said. "I've obviously lived and
breathed the significance of journalism on policy my whole life. So I
hope to hover right in that place where it's a conversation between
two intelligent people about why you should care about this.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say there is a total void in American television for a
45-minute, no-commercial documentary of this style. The idea is you
take a topic that is not necessarily news of the week, but a topic
that we all collectively deem to be important, and you have a
compelling film that has real characters, real people in it from the
perspective of this place, rather than from the perspective of
Washington policy."</TE>
<TE>   Rubin said that as interviewer, he will focus on the importance to
Americans of the issue presented in the film, what the consequences
may be and what, if anything, U.S. policy should be.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what I've been doing my whole life, either at the State
Department, where I was working with experts on a particular
region--and I'd say, 'What's our policy? Why should we care?' Or in
the Senate, when I worked with the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, which is the nexus of politics and foreign policy. Or
previously when I was at the think tank [Carnegie Endowment]. So it's
a perfect fit."</TE>
<TE>   The interview segment, taped a few days before airing, will be 15
or 20 minutes longer than what is seen on "Wide Angle," he said.
Segaller said the full transcript also will be on the Web site, and
the edited version used for the show will be on the site as a video
file.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin lives in London with his wife, CNN and "60 Minutes"
correspondent Christiane Amanpour, and their 2-year-old son, Darius
John. He will commute to New York, the city where he grew up, went to
college (Columbia) and still has business interests.</TE>
<TE>   Amanpour gave him a few suggestions for his new television job, he
acknowledged. "There are a few things that are different when you're
sitting in a new seat," he said. "Yes, she's given me some important
tips, the most important of which is to be who you are."</TE>
<TE>   And he added: "I'm hoping that, post-Sept. 11, people now realize
that events around the world can come home to bite us and that there
will be at least an openness to [a program such as 'Wide Angle'] that
may not have existed just a couple of years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Dhaliwal, married in September to an American television
journalist, Lee Patrick Sullivan, is a 12-year broadcast veteran. She
began her career at BBC, anchoring the international 24-hour news
channel BBC World. Two years later she anchored "ITN World News for
Public Television." She also has hosted ITN's weekly "World Focus,"
an international news show.</TE>
<TE>   "She registered with me as someone who has a real drive for
international journalism," said Segaller. "She even has a fan club."</TE>
<TE>   Dhaliwal said she and Sullivan will move to Atlanta so she can
begin anchoring CNNI's "World News" and "World Report" in August.
"I'm absolutely thrilled and excited," she said. "It's a
broadcaster's dream. London is where I was born and raised and went
to school, but I'm going to love the weather, the heat [in
Atlanta]--that's one thing I won't miss about London."</TE>
<TE>   Dhaliwal is a key figure in CNNI's relaunch this fall with a focus
on prime-time audiences in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Rena
Golden, CNNI general manager, said Dhaliwal has "engaging on-screen
presence." In 1999, Dhaliwal was named one of People magazine's 50
most beautiful people.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I've got my hands full," she acknowledged in a phone
interview from London. "I'll be commuting from London to the United
States for each of the five 'Wide Angle' programs" that she will
host, "spending two or three days getting my research, getting my
prep sorted out. Most of the interviews will be conducted in the
U.S., mainly Washington and New York. Then I start at CNN; the first
of August is when I'm to go on the air.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be an overlap between 'Wide Angle' and starting at
CNN. Logistically, it will be quite interesting."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Wide Angle" will air Thursdays at 8 p.m. on KCET-TV.</TE>

<HD>A Director of Intuition, Right to His Final Scene</HD>
<DH>John Frankenheimer's mastery of television and film was a
product of the emotion and vitality with which he lived his life. He
died on Saturday at 72.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES CHAMPLIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The filmmaker John Frankenheimer, who died Saturday from a massive
stroke at the age of 72, was an extraordinary man to have lunch with.
We met weekly at an Italian restaurant in the Hollywood Hills for
nearly three years while I recorded an oral history with him for the
Directors Guild of America. We never remembered to stop the tape
while the waiter took our orders, so the faithful transcript records
our week-to-week preferences between the penne and the angel hair,
the penne usually winning.</LD>
<LD>   John used to say that the first line of his obituary was sure to
label him the director of "The Manchurian Candidate." The papers are
proving him a prophet, because "The Manchurian Candidate" is a
masterpiece, still as tense and surprising to watch as it was when it
was made 40 years ago. The film was one of those superb
coming-together of ingredients that add up to magic: Angela Lansbury
cast wildly against type as the coldly murderous mother; a model
script by George Axelrod and Richard Condon; a remarkable performance
from Frank Sinatra. John, an actor himself in his collegiate days,
drew out of Sinatra one of his best dramatic performances.</LD>
<LD>   Frankenheimer had many such gifts as a filmmaker. No one did crowd
scenes, riots or tumults better. He made them comprehensible and
always integral to the story. On the set he could be a demanding
taskmaster. That came of being a perfectionist.</LD>
<TE>   John loved to talk about his early days in live television more
than a half-century ago. It was a perfect time to learn the craft.
The facilities were rudimentary by today's standards--there was not
yet any videotape--but the material was often the best. It was rich
with literary classics, used because so much of the material was
already in the public domain.</TE>
<TE>   One of John's favorite stories involved Hemingway's "The Snows of
Kilimanjaro." Robert Ryan played the hunter in Africa dying of
gangrene, unable to seek help because the Land Rover had broken down.
The prop man produced a shiny, brand-new vehicle for use in the
scene; John said he needed a battered and rusted Land Rover, not one
that looked as if it could drive away. The prop man was adamant that
the new vehicle was all John was going to get. So John and his crew
aged the vehicle--with sledgehammers. Every stroke was a blow against
bureaucracy, he told me years later.</TE>
<TE>   The lessons of improvised ingenuity served John well. Sitting in
the editing room during "Grand Prix," John saw that they had
photographed crowds at the races on two different days, once in sunny
weather, once during a light rain. The footages wouldn't match. John
went to the so-called insert camera, took off his wristwatch and
photographed it close-up while he dribbled some of his gin and tonic
on its face. At least one critic applauded the clever transition from
dry to wet weather.</TE>
<TE>   During the live TV days, John was doing a historical drama
starring the fine British actor Sir Cedric Hardwicke. The actor
protested he could not memorize a long monologue in one of his
scenes. John assured him he would be fine. But during the scene
Hardwicke's voice stopped although his lips kept moving. From the
control room John quickly realized what Hardwicke was doing.</TE>
<TE>   John killed the microphone on the stage and fed Sir Cedric the
blown lines on the intercom. Hardwicke's voice resumed as if nothing
had happened.</TE>
<TE>   When Sir John Gielgud was doing "The Browning Version" for
Frankenheimer on Playhouse 90, he asked for a pair of granny glasses
as a prop. At the first bare-stage rehearsal Frankenheimer was amazed
to see that Gielgud had shed a tear on the glasses. It was a
wonderful touch but John was dismayed that it might not happen again.
But it did, at two more rehearsals, the dress rehearsal and finally
during the live broadcast. "How can you produce that tear again and
again like that?" John asked Gielgud.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I just think of Mummy and it all comes out," Gielgud said.</TE>
<TE>   The last time John and I had lunch he arrived in a glorious
convertible that Mercedes-Benz had custom designed for, I think, the
Sultan of Brunei, who decided he didn't like it and refused to pay
for it. John did. He had been a race-car driver in his college days
at Williams and had become a collector. He told me that he had once
been jailed in Kansas during production of "Gypsy Moths." He had been
clocked driving 190 miles an hour.</TE>
<TE>   John had more vitality than almost anyone I've ever known. That
was part of the pleasure of his company. He was also a marvelous
raconteur with hundreds of anecdotes, sometimes salty, from a
half-century of life in film and television. Until just before his
last major surgery he played tennis--hard, competitive tennis--every
morning. He was a fine cook and our luncheon discussions with the
patrone suggested one chef talking to another.</TE>
<TE>   He was a constant reader, always eager to hear about and discuss
new books. At 6 feet, 4 inches, he could have been a double for John
Wayne. Without meaning to, he commanded attention when he entered a
room. He embraced life as a man half his age might.</TE>
<TE>   After his stroke very early Saturday morning his mind remained
sharp and clear. But to those with him it was evident that he knew
his days of vigor and creativity were over. He said goodbye with a
peaceful resignation. It was as if he had directed the scene as he
had directed so many scenes for so many years.</TE>

<LD>The Irvine-based Arpana Dance Company marked its 20th anniversary on
Saturday night by celebrating the attributes of female deities and
formidable women in a multipart three-hour bharata natyam program
called "Woman Divine" at the Irvine Barclay Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   Slides projected at the start of the evening suggested heroines:
Mother Teresa, Rosa Parks, Aung San Suu Kyi and Sally Ride. But the
dances that followed revolved around figures in Hindu mythology: the
courage of a new bride who dares to rebel against conservative norms
in "Mirabai Dance" and the woman who has enough passion to right a
wrong in "Kannagi Dance."</LD>
<LD>   In group pieces with Arpana's nine members, women's sense of
solidarity and community was evoked, according to the serene onstage
narrator, Usha Sampath. There was a wedding-cake attractiveness to
these dances, with an emphasis on graceful design and pattern.</LD>
<TE>   Artistic director Ramya Harishankar and her guest, G. Narendra,
made their marks most solidly in solos of delicately detailed mime,
Harishankar as Krishna's mother and Narendra playing Krishna as he
craftily woos an angry Radha.</TE>
<TE>   Both dancers created believable little islands of embodied,
stylized emotion. Of course, seeing Radha cave in to Krishna because
he's such a smooth operator (a major theme in Indian classical dance)
didn't really fit into a goddess-heavy program, but we were, of
course, meant to see a union of the human and the divine in that
case.</TE>
<TE>   Except for a few small glitches, the program flowed smoothly,
often incorporating pauses to take in an impressive grouping or an
individual silhouetted against changing washes of light. Impressive
phrasing was more rare, however, perhaps most strongly missed in
terms of bharata natyam's virtuosic delights.</TE>
<TE>   Harishankar and Narendra shared choreographic duties with A.
Lakshman. Able musicians and singers were directed by vocalist Reji
George and drummer D. Kannan.</TE>

<HD>'Warhol' Draws Well at MOCA</HD>
<DH>Museums* No long waits, no mob scenes or sell-out crowds,
but the gamble on the Pop artist is, so far, paying off.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Museum of Contemporary Art pulled out all the stops to present
its current exhibition, "Andy Warhol Retrospective." Seizing an
unexpected opportunity to bring the landmark survey of the celebrated
Pop artist's work to Los Angeles--the only U.S. venue--the museum
joined forces with the Los Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau,
garnered financial support from the city, corporate sponsors and
private patrons, and negotiated loans of the artworks in record
time--about six months instead of the usual three or four years.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the museum was struggling with the loss of a
multimillion-dollar pledge, which forced it to trim $2 million from
its $15-million operating budget.</LD>
<LD>   Taking on the Warhol show would have been an expensive project for
MOCA at the best of times. The cost of additional security and
extended operating hours has pushed the exhibition budget from about
$2 million to nearly $3 million. But the show is also an opportunity
to fill the museum's coffers and build an audience and donor base
that might help to sustain it in the future.</LD>
<TE>   Midway into the 12-week exhibition, the gamble seems to be paying
off. In fact, because financing was in place prior to opening of the
show, MOCA stands to make a profit.</TE>
<TE>   "Andy Warhol Retrospective" hasn't created a mob scene. The museum
has yet to sell out a single time slot for the specially ticketed
show. Although visitors are encouraged to purchase advance tickets
through Ticketmaster, they can simply go to the museum in downtown
Los Angeles, buy a ticket at the box office and--most of the
time--walk right into the galleries. Lines form before the museum
opens and occasionally at other times, but visitors rarely have to
wait more than a few minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Still, attendance is meeting projections, MOCA director Jeremy
Strick said. During its first six weeks, Warhol has brought 80,000
visitors to the museum. If that flow continues, total attendance will
fall within the predicted range of 150,000 to 200,000. Different
versions of the exhibition attracted about 200,000 visitors to both a
13 1/2-week run at the New National Gallery in Berlin and a 7
1/2-week engagement the Tate Modern in London.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Warhol is expected to be MOCA's best-attended show
to date. "At the End of the Century: One Hundred Years of
Architecture" brought 150,000 visitors in 2000, but it continued for
23 weeks, nearly twice as long as Warhol. "David Hockney
Retrospective: Photoworks," an unusually popular show, attracted
88,400 visitors over 13 weeks in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Joining the Cause</TE>
<TE>   Sales of memberships, which include two tickets to Warhol, are up
as well. The museum has 15,000 members on its roll, about 3,600 more
than at the same time last year. With Warhol tickets priced at $12 on
weekdays and $17 on weekends for adults, $6 and $8 for children 12
and under, many people are opting for memberships, which start at
$60.</TE>
<TE>   MOCA's store--stocked with dozens of Warhol items, from beaded
bags to light-switch plates--is also doing a brisk business. During
the first five weeks of the show, the shop racked up $700,000 in
sales, about four times the usual sum. The take includes $420,000
worth of Warhol goodies: 25,000 postcards, 12,000 magnets, 6,000
catalogs, 3,000 T-shirts and 2,500 posters.</TE>
<TE>   Who's going to the show and buying all this stuff? A survey
commissioned by the Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau and conducted by
Focus Inc. indicates that 47% of the visitors live outside Los
Angeles County: 21.8% in other parts of California, 18.2% in other
states and 7% in other countries. Half the visitors have never been
to the museum before.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 80% of the out-of-towners are staying overnight in the Los
Angeles area. In fact, they are spending an average of 5.9 nights,
according to the survey. That's considerably more than the typical
3.7 nights, said David W. Sheatsley, director of research at the
bureau.</TE>
<TE>   Though it appears the bureau's advertising campaign has brought
many visitors to Los Angeles, most of them are not buying hotel
packages that include tickets to the exhibition, said Robert Barrett,
the bureau's vice president of domestic marketing. "If the exhibition
was sold out, our packages would be selling like crazy. But people
discover that they can go any day, so they elect lower room rates, go
to MOCA on their own and buy tickets the day they go to the show."</TE>
<TE>   Figures from the survey will be used to produce an economic impact
study when the exhibition closes. "We can't guess the result, but I
think it will be very respectable," Barrett said. "A significant
number of wallets that wouldn't otherwise be in Los Angeles are here,
and some of that green stuff is being spread around."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the MOCA exhibition has spawned a sort of Warhol fever,
with other venues staging their own shows, films, lectures and
related events.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Museum of Art and other large museums
across the country make a practice of issuing timed tickets for
exhibitions that are expected to be particularly well attended. "It's
a matter of covering costs and controlling crowds," said Keith
McKeown, assistant vice president of communications at LACMA.</TE>
<TE>   Although exhibition budgets are established in advance, popular
appeal can only be estimated. Museum professionals typically base
their decisions about ticketing shows on past experience and
consultation with their peers at other institutions.</TE>
<TE>   If tickets seem necessary, the museum's staff goes to great
lengths to manage visits "from parking lot to parking lot," as Erroll
Southers, LACMA's vice president of visitors services, put it. In
planning for "Van Gogh's Van Goghs," a $10.6-million exhibition that
brought 821,000 people to LACMA during a 17-week run in 1998-99, he
rallied the entire museum staff to crowd into the galleries and look
at reproductions of the paintings, as a sort of rehearsal.</TE>
<TE>   The Warhol show isn't in that league, but as MOCA's first
specially ticketed exhibition, it presented a major challenge. "We
wanted to make sure visitors had a positive experience in terms of
crowds, information dissemination and just getting here," said Mimi
McCormick, associate director of operations. To that end, the museum
set up valet parking and a coffee cart, and erected a tent on the
upper plaza to provide shade during the daytime and a covered space
for evening events.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the museum raised enough funds to cover most of the
exhibition's costs, ticket income was needed to offset recent
financial losses. Trustee Dallas Price had pledged $10 million to
MOCA in early 2000, to be paid in annual installments. She and her
ex-husband, David Price, are co-owners of American Golf Corp. in
Santa Monica. But their golf empire has suffered a sharp reversal. In
2001, with $6.9 million to go, Price notified the museum's leaders
that she could not make additional payments until the company
recovered. The museum, which acknowledged the loss in its 2001 annual
report, declined to name the donor. But the Los Angeles Business
Journal recently identified Price and sources close to the museum
have confirmed the newspaper's report.</TE>
<TE>   It's All in the Timing</TE>
<TE>   As for crowd control, timed tickets may not have been necessary,
but "they have helped to even things out," Strick said, and they may
prove even more useful.</TE>
<TE>   "The typical phenomenon with very popular exhibitions is that you
get a very strong attendance in the beginning, a trough in the middle
and a sharp rise at the end," he said. "We are not seeing a trough at
this point; attendance seems to be going up week by week. Whether we
see a sharp rise at the end remains to be seen. But if we do, we will
certainly be grateful for the timed system."</TE>
<TE>   Strick said the only complaints he has received are from people
who have bought tickets for the last hour and rushed through the
galleries. To alleviate the problem, ticket sellers have been
instructed to alert visitors of the museum's closing hours, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Beyond that, people seem to be thrilled with the show," he said.
"It's a remarkable confluence of broad appeal and extraordinary
artistic quality. I would jump at the opportunity do something like
this again. I would love to have had more time to prepare it, and to
have done it in a different economic climate would have been even
better. But it has done very good things for the museum."</TE>

<HD>'Men in Black II' in 1st Over the 4th</HD>
<DH>Box Office* Sequel draws an estimated July-holiday record
of $90 million over the long weekend; "Mr. Deeds" settles for second.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Fourth of July celebration was lopsided in favor of one movie,
"Men in Black II," which grossed an estimated record-breaking $90
million in 3,557 theaters and more than 6,000 individual screens. The
sequel out-grossed the original comic book adaptation starring Will
Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, which opened over the same period five
years ago at $79.3 million. "MIBII" also tops 1996's "Independence
Day," which took in $84.9 million over the holiday. Coincidentally,
all three movies star Smith.</LD>
<LD>   For Sony Pictures Entertainment, "MIBII" represents the studio's
fifth No. 1 movie of the year. And according to company Chairman Amy
Pascal, by midweek the studio will reach $1 billion in total
revenues, the fastest any film company has ever reached that level.
Sony previously recorded $1 billion in sales in early September of
1997 with the help of the first "Men in Black" and holds the record
of $1.27 billion for the entire year, which it could exceed by
summer's end.</LD>
<LD>   "We're working on all cylinders," enthused Pascal. "I'm proud of
every single division." And, she notes, Sony got to $1 billion mostly
with original titles, not sequels.</LD>
<TE>   The studio's other milestone for the weekend was "Spider-Man,"
which became only the fifth motion picture ever to reach $400 million
in admissions.</TE>
<TE>   The summer's dominant movies--"Spider-Man," "Star Wars: Episode II
Attack of the Clones," and now "MIBII"--emphasize how heavily reliant
the motion picture industry has become on blockbuster titles to stoke
the public's moviegoing appetite. These overachievers bring out the
infrequent moviegoer and generate momentum that spills over to other
movies.</TE>
<TE>   As with the other big summer titles, "MIBII's" ultimate take will
depend heavily on repeat business. The total gross of the first movie
was only three times its holiday weekend opening gross. It also cost
far less than the sequel, which is reportedly tagged with a
$140-million budget.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the cost, "MIBII" kept the ticket-takers busy as the top
12 movies generated an estimated $219 million, according to Exhibitor
Relations.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, the previous Fourth of July five-day record came in
1996 when "Independence Day" opened and the top 50 movies grossed
$198.4 million, says Paul Dergarabedian, president of the box-office
tracking firm.</TE>
<TE>   The summer movie period, which started May 3, is running 27% ahead
of last year and has taken in $2 billion at the box office so far.
The year-to-date box-office revenues are about $4.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Of the other two movies that opened, both aimed at children, the
live-action "Like Mike," snared a snazzy $20 million over the
five-day period on 2,310 screens, a healthy start for the family
movie.</TE>
<TE>   As with last week's "Hey Arnold, The Movie," however, the transfer
of the animated "Powerpuff Girls" to the big screen was met with
indifference, with only $6.1 million expected in its first five days
in 2,290 theaters. "Hey Arnold: The Movie," dropped out of the top 10
in its second weekend, collecting $10.7 million in its first 10 days
in 2,527 theaters, only $3 million over the holiday weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Neither film was any match for Disney's "Lilo &amp; Stitch," which
orbited into the $100-million stratosphere in its third weekend in
3,222 theaters, grossing an estimated $19 million over the last five
days. It joins the mighty "Scooby-Doo" as a runaway
family-entertainment performer for the summer. "Scooby" is still in
3,257 theaters, taking in an expected $10 million in five days at
3,257 sites, and is already at $137.5 million after only four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Sandler's "Mr. Deeds" dropped off considerably from its first
weekend but managed to hang on to second place with $26.3 million in
3,231 theaters over the holiday and $74 million in its first 10 days,
well over its reported $55-million budget.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Spielberg's "Minority Report," starring Tom Cruise, is
about to become another $100-million-plus notch in the belt of both
its director and star, grossing an estimated $18.2 million and almost
$97 million in three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The five-day holiday benefited adult-skewing titles, as the
grown-ups caught up with movies such as "The Bourne Identity" and
"Sum of All Fears."</TE>
<TE>   "Bourne Identity" held on with a scant 19% drop from last weekend,
selling $13.2 million in tickets over the past five days, taking it
to just under $90 million in its first month.</TE>
<TE>   In its sixth week, "Sum" added $5.1 million in 1,592 theaters,
bringing its cume to $112 million or so.</TE>
<TE>   In 10th place, "Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood," was still
thriving with $4 million expected over the past five days in 1,792
theaters and a $61 million to date.</TE>
<TE>   Proof positive that the independent movie is alive and kicking
comes from "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," which is actually improving as
it goes along.</TE>
<TE>   Its ticket sales were up 27% last weekend for a five-day total of
$4.1 million on only 499 screens. It has grossed almost $24 million
to date.</TE>

<HD>A Modernist Connection: Renoir and American Art</HD>
<DH>San Diego exhibition shows influence of the Impressionist
painter on 20th century artists such as Cassatt and Glackens</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEAH OLLMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>How is the exhibition at the San Diego Museum of Art, "Idol of the
Moderns: Pierre-Auguste Renoir and American Painting," like the
nighttime sky? Both are filled with brighter and lesser stars that
distant observers have joined into constellations, linking their
histories. Those trained observers--astronomers, curators--are there
to help, to teach, to make connections, but even without them, the
stars shine as radiantly.</LD>
<LD>   At least they do in the night sky.</LD>
<LD>   In this show, curators have provided the maps and directed our
gaze, but there's little that's glorious to see. In the sky, as in
the curatorial cosmos, wonders should precede interpretation, not the
other way around. Here, the lessons are well-drawn, but the art,
which ought to be central, feels secondary, illustrative. We leave
the show instructed, but not inspired.</LD>
<TE>   "Idol of the Moderns" aims to demonstrate Renoir's influence on
early 20th century American painters and to reveal his reputation
during those years as innovative, a forerunner of modernism. Twelve
of the show's 40 paintings are by Renoir (1841-1919), and the rest by
Americans such as George Wesley Bellows, Mary Cassatt, Andrew
Dasburg, William Glackens, Frederick Carl Frieseke, Robert Henri,
Henry Lee McFee, Kenneth Hayes Miller and Guy Pene du Bois.</TE>
<TE>   Co-curators Anne Dawson, an art historian whose dissertation
formed the basis for the show, and Steven Kern, San Diego Museum of
Art's curator of European art, identify the period from 1904 through
1940 as that of Renoir's greatest impact in this country. The
exhibitions of the renegade Impressionists had secured Renoir's
reputation in France a generation earlier, but wide exposure here
didn't occur until the turn of the century. In the following decades,
critics, collectors and artists fueled what a writer for Art News
magazine in the 1930s called "the Renoir cult."</TE>
<TE>   Renoir began to appear in--and dominate--English-language
discussions of Impressionism. In a seminal 1903 book, he was
described as "the most lyrical, the most musical, the most subtle" of
the Impressionists. He had his first solo show in New York in 1908,
and half a dozen more in the next 10 years. Critics hailed his use of
vibrant color, the accessibility of his subject matter, its optimism,
gaiety and sentimentality.</TE>
<TE>   An intense demand for his work ensued. The Metropolitan Museum of
Art bought a significant portrait of his. Collector Duncan Phillips
bought one of his most important paintings, "Luncheon of the Boating
Party." When Albert Barnes opened his foundation outside Philadelphia
in 1922 with a collection of 400 works by French Impressionists and
Post-Impressionists, roughly 150 of them were by Renoir.</TE>
<TE>   Many American artists, especially those who had studied abroad,
had become acquainted with Renoir before his rise in the U.S. Though
Frieseke trailed after Monet in Giverny, he acknowledged Renoir as
his true stylistic mentor, particularly because they both favored the
nude. Frieseke's "Nude in Dappled Sunlight" (1915) is a violet-soaked
confection that takes its cue from Renoir's treatment of light and
shadow as substantive, palpable. (The effect had one of Renoir's
critics in the 1870s claiming the canvases looked like they had been
in an accident, they were so "flecked" and "striped.")</TE>
<TE>   Cassatt, who exhibited with the Impressionists in Paris, is also
represented here, by a sketchy portrait of a young girl. The painting
hints only generally of her kinship with Renoir, and of her own
remarkable talents, which were more closely aligned with Degas.</TE>
<TE>   Renoir's reach stretched beyond the American Impressionists into
the camps of realism. Glackens, who showed with The Eight (also
called the Ashcan School, for the humility and sometimes the darkness
of their subject matter) was often discussed--and dismissed--in terms
of his adaptations of Renoir's compositions and brush stroke.</TE>
<TE>   Glackens' paintings here may be derivative, but the American
brought his own verve to the scenes. His "Family Group" (1910-11) is
refreshingly off-kilter emotionally, whereas its models, Renoir's
group portraits (two of which are on view here), gloss over any
ambiguity of mood to create a seamless veneer of gentility.</TE>
<TE>   Other members of The Eight appear here as well--John Sloan, George
Luks and Henri, whose expressive, spontaneous painting style owes
more to Manet, Goya and Chase than to Renoir. Eugene Speicher, a
student of Henri's, is represented by an earnest, melancholy
portrait, and Isabel Bishop, another urban realist, shows a sprightly
drawing of two women chatting on the street during their lunch hour.</TE>
<TE>   Several prominent formalist critics of the 1910s and '20s looked
upon Renoir as a bridge between tradition and modernism. He used
color, they wrote, for its descriptive properties, to articulate
form, but also to generate emotional response. They likened the color
relationships in his work to those in music, using terms like
"sonorous" and "reverberations." He was credited with laying the
foundation for the Synchromists, painters who used color alone to
convey rhythm and space. A 1913 Synchromist canvas here by Morgan
Russell serves as an adequate example of the approach.</TE>
<TE>   Marsden Hartley's name is rarely, if ever, uttered in the same
breath as Renoir's, but he, too, was an admirer. Two boldly drawn
landscapes from 1919 hang here, alongside excerpts from letters that
he wrote to Alfred Stieglitz, stating that in these paintings of New
Mexico, "You will see a little Courbet, and a little Renoir, and a
little Cezanne, and you will also see myself."</TE>
<TE>   Comments like this abound in the wall texts for the show and its
catalog, and they make a convincing case on paper for Renoir's
relevance to each of the artists included. The lines of connection
are well-drawn. Still, the works chosen as points between these lines
haven't enough strength of their own. They illustrate the lesson, but
don't, in themselves, make it matter.</TE>
<TE>   The underwhelming character of the show begins and ends with
Renoir himself, whose critical standing dropped in the 1940s and
never fully recovered. His paintings here--nudes, portraits and
images of young women reading--have a sweetness that all too often
crosses over into the saccharine. The colors are vibrant, but never
vigorous. Even the critic James Gibbons Huneker, who championed
Renoir as a proto-modernist, acknowledged that "Renoir was never a
difficult painter." There are complex, richer examples of Renoir's
work to stand in the artist's defense, but not here. The paintings at
the San Diego museum are marshmallow soft, and just as bland. "Idol
of the Moderns" does its job in outlining the constellation it
proposes. But it doesn't offer much in the way of joyful stargazing.</TE>

<LD>Twenty-five years is not a long time in the Hindu scheme of things.
Think of Amba's years of austerity so that she could be reborn to
take her revenge on Bhishma in the Indian epic "Mahabharata."</LD>
<LD>   But in terms of a dance company's survival in Los Angeles, 25
years is a significant period of time. So Viji Prakash's celebration
of the silver anniversary of her Shakti Dance Company on Saturday at
the James Armstrong Theatre at the Torrance Performing Arts Center
was a welcome and praiseworthy event.</LD>
<LD>   The company performed a new dance opera, "Nandanar Charitam." Even
better, several generations of bharata natyam dancers appeared on
stage, including Prakash's guru, Kalyanasundaram (vocalist and
choreographer for all the dances); his son, Harikrishnan; Prakash;
her daughter, Mythili; and 19 of her other senior students.</LD>
<TE>   Time has taken its toll on the founder of Shakti, but fortunately
Indian dance has never been a matter of just virtuoso steps. There is
also meaningful gesture, dramatic storytelling and above all a moral
intention and force to the art.</TE>
<TE>   Prakash was sparing in pure dance footwork and holding balanced
poses (how we remember her speed, clarity, steadiness and buoyancy),
but not in meeting the other demands. Her dramatic projection, in
fact, may have been greater than ever as she took the lead part in
"Nandanar," the story of how a social pariah's devotion to Lord
Nataraja leads to his spiritual triumph.</TE>
<TE>   Harikrishnan had a calm, ease and lightness about his movements,
but he also, not surprisingly, showed some fatigue during the three
long and demanding solos that opened the program.</TE>
<TE>   The students also showed signs of strain, particularly in holding
those difficult poses codified in temple carvings.</TE>
<TE>   But their mastery of the vocabulary and surprisingly persuasive
characterizations proved how valuable their training at the Shakti
School has been.</TE>

<HD>From Fear to Redemption--and Back</HD>
<DH>Abstract new drama by the Hysterica Dance Company tells a
story of self-discovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Flung onto the stage of the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre on Friday
like a contemporary Petrushka, Ryan Heffington spent the opening
scene of the exciting new abstract dance drama "Sticks and Stones"
twitching, trembling and trying desperately to escape.</LD>
<LD>   "Freedom equals fear," sang Katie Eastburn from the couch she
shared with composer Matt Sims, overlooking the action. There would
be no escape for Heffington, though over the next two acts (and
hours), choreographer Kitty McNamee transformed him from an icon of
victimization to a conduit for the group's self-discovery and sense
of belonging.</LD>
<LD>   Some stages of that transformation remained underdeveloped but, in
the latest vehicle for McNamee's Hysterica Dance Company, she
displayed an impressive command of nonlinear storytelling, defining
character, tracing relationships and reiterating her theme through
hot, propulsive confrontations and resolutely avoiding conventional
narrative.</LD>
<TE>   Bold gestural motifs helped unify the work: compulsive
hair-combing as an index to insecurity, for example, or the dancers
seeming to pull open their chests, as if to leave their insides
exposed and vulnerable. Initially an expression of Heffington's pain,
this motif eventually grew into a symbol of an openhearted acceptance
of life, the only path to freedom without fear.</TE>
<TE>   In style, "Sticks and Stones" used edgy modern dance for intimate
passages; Sims' electronic sounds sometimes seemed to vibrate through
the dancers' bodies, as if they were undergoing shock therapy. (The
wiry Heffington proved brilliant in these moments.) Group dances
often adopted pop idioms and rock recordings (Siouxsie and the
Banshees, for instance), and here the inventively asymmetrical
costumes by Grey Ant and Rock 'N Sissy prioritized delirious
nightmare chic.</TE>
<TE>   Heffington's role gave him major duets with Tara Avise and Erin
Giraud, each encounter tinged with a feeling of loss for a different
reason. Scott Hislop and Mecca Andrews had their own brief, feisty
partnership. But in the duets for R.J. Durell and Lisa Eaton and in
particular in the trio for Durell, Eaton and Giraud early in Act 1,
McNamee's ability to physicalize complex emotional undercurrents
found its most sensitive and sensual outlet.</TE>
<TE>   Like Heffington's unstinting fervor, Durell's partnering prowess
served McNamee splendidly throughout the evening. In one duet he
swung Eaton onto his shoulder so effortlessly that you assumed there
had to be hidden wires a la "Peter Pan." Avise's ability to project
tension to the next galaxy also allowed McNamee to bypass playacting
for deeper in-the-body expression.</TE>
<TE>   Her insights about intimacy proved especially provocative in this
depiction of the rootlessness and isolation of contemporary
freedom--Eaton wildly struggling in Durell's embrace, for instance,
or submitting to sex with Hislop but not allowing him to kiss her.</TE>
<TE>   The aggressive sexual salesmanship of pop dance thus became
dangerously double-edged here: conventionally sexy yet an enticement
to exactly what Eaton feared. As a result, casual same-sex linkups
seemed less risky, more comfortable for the "Sticks and Stones"
women. No possessiveness or, indeed, any future, just slinky
momentary gratifications.</TE>
<TE>   Even the feel-good ending, with its communal embraces and those
openhearted gestures, arguably represented a pre-sexual or asexual
dream of unconditional love and acceptance. When the dream ends,
however, Heffington will again be flung, alone and desperate, back
into the terrifying void--along with the rest of us.</TE>

<HD>Hunter Is Hoping We Bite</HD>
<DH>Steve Irwin will promote his 'Crocodile' movie with animal
antics if he has to, but he also has a message to get across.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNN SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Irwin is, if possible, even more excited than usual. Far from
his home in Queensland's Australia Zoo, the Crocodile Hunter is on a
crusade to capture a new audience.</LD>
<LD>   It's the last Friday afternoon in June, the ninth day of a
four-week international tour to promote his first feature film, "The
Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course," and Irwin, his sidekick wife,
Terri, and his partner and director, John Stainton, peer out at
Hollywood from the windows of a sleek limo as it carries them to
their destination, "The Tonight Show."</LD>
<LD>   "There I am!" he says, spying one of the billboards advertising
the movie, which opens Friday. Although he's been awake since 4:30
a.m. and is suffering from jet lag-induced insomnia, you'd never know
it. He looks remarkably like his mass-produced image: in khakis and
boots, eyes wide, blond bangs flying as he hangs on to a runaway
open-jawed crocodile.</LD>
<TE>   A boyish 40, Irwin also sounds just like his breathless persona on
Animal Planet's "The Crocodile Hunter," making full use of his easily
and oft-satirized phrases, "Aw, Crikey!" and "Isn't she gor-geous?"</TE>
<TE>   He addresses everyone from strangers to studio officials to his
wife as "mate." He bursts with schoolteacher-esque overstatement as
he zips from story to story--the gangrene he contracted in the wilds
of Namibia, the moment he figured out how to trap a crocodile, the
tears he shed filming a new series on Australian heroes of World War
II and his devotion to wildlife conservation and the journey of life.</TE>
<TE>   "In this journey, your eyes, your ears, nostrils, every single
part of you, your hair, is feeling something," he says with an almost
alarming intensity. Stainton's journey is with cameras, he says. His
is with wildlife. With their TV documentaries, which bring them $16.5
million a year, and now with this movie, he says, "We're going
forward, further and beyond. There's no parameters for us.
Conservation is what makes us tick. We're wildlife warriors through
and through. We will die defending wildlife. Every cent we earn goes
back into conservation."</TE>
<TE>   Before it was picked up by MGM, "Crocodile Hunter: Collision
Course" was a series of documentary clips shot on 35-millimeter film,
at their own expense, he says. Since the movie cost a relatively
cheap $13 million, he stands to make a reasonable profit through a
"back-end deal" still being negotiated, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe in this movie," he says, then adds in a conspiratorial
stage whisper, "Let's put pressure by your print on the MGM back-end
deal."</TE>
<TE>   Not only is he willing to help MGM promote the movie--which he
hasn't yet seen--he's also vowed to do more interviews than anyone
ever has to promote a film. "If Tom Cruise has done 60 interviews in
a day," he says, "I'll do 80." But here's the problem. Most people,
especially fellow entertainers willing to interview him on their
shows, are more interested in his animal antics than in his message.</TE>
<TE>   As happens every time he appears on "The Tonight Show," Irwin
says, the producers this time around want him to do animal acts.
"It's wearing a bit thin. What I want to do is talk about what I'm
doing. I really like Jay Leno because he's a top bloke, but I've got
more than animal antics to give to the world. I've got a big heart.
I'm the ultimate softie. I'm really passionate about what I do, and I
never get the opportunity to tell people about it," he says.</TE>
<TE>   As the limo pulls into the lot, Terri Irwin, his co-crusader and
behind-the-scenes marketing expert, says, "It's frustrating when
you've got six minutes and have things to convey and you bring the
animal out, and you talk about the animal and you're done."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, after some negotiation with the show's producers,
he's agreed to wrestle an alligator on the show one more time. Inside
the studio, Bubba the alligator waits quietly in a denim bag.</TE>
<TE>   Flown in from Chicago, where he is known as one of the mellowest
alligators in the U.S., he has given rides to children at hospitals
and birthday parties and has appeared at wedding receptions,
confirmations and block parties. Not to mention on "Oprah."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens on the show tonight, Irwin will not be in danger,
said Bubba's owner, Jim Nesci, founder of the Cold Blooded Creatures
educational organization.</TE>
<TE>   In rehearsal, a segment producer stands in for Leno and kisses the
alligator on the nose. In a private conference, Leno and Irwin agree
that on the show, they will hoist Bubba onto Leno's desk so he can
kiss the alligator in profile for the camera.</TE>
<TE>   With Steve and Terri Irwin resting in a private room, Stainton
talks about his hopes for the movie in a hallway backstage. Because
the cable series attracts viewers across the generations, he thinks
"Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course" might spawn regular summer
sequels, like the Elvis or Gidget movies of the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Stainton knew it would be a challenge to motivate "Crocodile
Hunter" fans to pay for wildlife adventure scenes they can find at
home on cable. His answer was to cut a narrative story, with
professional actors, into their regular documentary scenes.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't have Steve playing a role," he says. Irwin ad-libbed
his part, as he does in the documentaries. In the movie, Irwin plays
himself, a wildlife crusader rescuing rogue crocodiles and small
kangaroos, who is unaware the croc he's chasing has swallowed a
fallen spy satellite. A pair of goofy CIA operatives and a feisty
rancher widow provide antics aimed to appeal to 8-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the sort of movie that will get critical acclaim from
the academy," Stainton says.</TE>
<TE>   When it's time for his segment, Irwin bounds onstage. As he starts
to talk about conservation, he is interrupted by Bubba, so relaxed he
has to be carried in by his owners. As Leno and Irwin attempt to lift
the alligator, it knocks Leno to the ground and swipes Irwin's cheek
with its tail.</TE>
<TE>   "Ah, claret!" Irwin says casually of the bloody scratch. He
motions for a close-up of his face. Almost lost in the excitement is
a brief exchange where Leno asks him, "Now, all this money is going
to help animals?" Irwin replies: "Every cent."</TE>
<TE>   After the show, the entourage exits through the basement to avoid,
their security guard says, a crush of fans. As the limo winds back
through Hollywood toward their hotel, Terri Irwin says she was
worried that Irwin's now swelling scrape might ruin his appearance
for the movie premiere the next night. She quickly realized however,
it could serve as an ice breaker. "I'm terrified about meeting all
these Hollywood people. So, it's like a bad thing? No way. This is
the best thing that could have happened."</TE>
<TE>   He's more philosophical about "The Tonight Show."</TE>
<TE>   "As usual, I didn't get to where I wanted to be, but it doesn't
matter. Come the end of the day, Bubba looked really good. When he
walked like a dinosaur, it was fantastic, wasn't it?"</TE>
<TE>   They pass another billboard, a mammoth ad above Hollywood and
Highland. "Crikey," Terri Irwin says. Says Irwin, "It's a beauty."</TE>

<LD>On a recent Wednesday night I joined the crowd that poured into the
Ahmanson Theatre at up to $60 a head for the opening of the latest
New York road show, "The Allergist's Wife," an amusingly irreverent
comedy starring a passel of older but still vital and talented,
used-to-be-famous actors. I left the theater mildly amused, having
spent a pleasant two hours that were marginally more uplifting than
an evening of television.</LD>
<LD>   The next night I joined a handful of devoted souls who filed into
a small storefront theater in North Hollywood at $25 a head to see a
performance of Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman," with veteran
actor Eddie Jones as a heartbreaking and quiveringly alive Willie
Loman. I left the theater full of excruciating sorrow for the human
condition, and mercifully raised above the mundaneness that is the
hallmark of modern life.</LD>
<LD>   The contrast between the two experiences jolted me and made me
want to share it.</LD>
<TE>   The theater company, the Interact, that is performing the Miller
play is struggling for funds to keep going and, despite being a
Critics' Choice in The Times, the production has had to fight for
audiences. I have to wonder why. Do those hoards of people who flow
into the Ahmanson's pricey plays know about the many fine
little-theater productions that are going on in their city? Do they
think that because the theaters are small, they are amateur?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe with this particular production it is because the play was
done not long ago at the Ahmanson. But the fact is that some
excellent small theaters in Los Angeles cannot exist because they
cannot find audiences.</TE>
<TE>   As a theater lover, I find this shameful and frustrating. I know
too well that a lot of what's done in small theaters are "vanity"
productions, not worth the annoying drive across our sprawling
metropolis. But often an experience in one of these forlorn little
black boxes can do what this production did for me: lift one out of
the everyday and make life seem meaningful again.</TE>
<TE>   Companies such as the Interact, the Fountain Theater, the Matrix
and the Pacific Resident Theatre Company in Venice do consistently
good work employing some of America's best actors, who long to
genuinely practice their craft with worthwhile material.</TE>
<TE>   I suppose it has ever been so that the mass of people will rush to
a diverting amusement and avoid the suffering served up by tragedy.
Maybe everyone doesn't want to have his heart ripped out by Arthur
Miller and Eddie Jones. But the versatile actors in these little
companies can do comedy, too!</TE>
<TE>   Keep your subscription at the Music Center, and thank you for
supporting the arts. But branch out and take advantage of our unique
opportunity to see superior theater. We are consummately lucky to
have in our city these first-rate theater folk, who, for so little
money, are willing to expose our souls to us.</TE>

<LD>Traveling by private plane has always carried a certain adventurous
allure, a sense of prestige and privilege that even flying
first-class in a commercial aircraft can't match. And if you're the
one piloting the private plane, well, the world is your oyster.</LD>
<LD>   Yet there's an enhanced risk of danger involved as well, and one
that tends to go almost unnoticed unless a celebrity such as John F.
Kennedy Jr. or pro golfer Payne Stewart is involved.</LD>
<LD>   But as we're reminded by a pair of tragic incidents in the past
few days--the July 4 crash of a small plane in San Dimas that claimed
four lives, and another crash earlier in the week in Los Padres
National Forest that killed six people in two planes--general
aviation flying can be a risky proposition.</LD>
<TE>   That's the taking-off point for tonight's A&amp;E special
"Investigative Reports: Flying Blind" (10-11 p.m.), a rather bland
cautionary tale narrated by Bill Kurtis.</TE>
<TE>   About a half-million people pilot private planes each year in the
U.S., and there are 2,000 serious crashes annually, according to
"Flying Blind." In this country alone, 600 people die each year in
small planes. The program cites details of several multiple-fatality
crashes of recent years including JFK Jr.'s in July 1999 and the
Stewart crash in October '98, in which a loss of cabin pressure
apparently killed the pilot and passengers, yet the plane continued
flying for several hours.</TE>
<TE>   But the most significant message tonight is that nearly 70% of
private plane crashes are due to pilot error. You'd be surprised how
many pilots simply run out of gas.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the syndrome air-safety experts call "Get
Home-itis," in which pilots press on despite red flags usually
relating to weather or equipment problems. This, combined with
training that is frequently inadequate, proves a deadly combination
far too often.</TE>

<HD>Cool Puffy AmiYumi Leaves the Kitsch Offstage</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Japan is the world capital of cute culture, a place where the Hello
Kitty cat is emblazoned on commercial jets and designer jeans. Puffy
AmiYumi isn't quite as ubiquitous, but it comes close.</LD>
<LD>   The adorable female singing duo is a vertically integrated
industry unto itself in its native country, with variety shows, toys
and countless print and TV ads driving the sales of its records.</LD>
<LD>   With its first domestic release, "An Illustrated History," and a
U.S. tour, Puffy AmiYumi is feeding the ravenous appetites of
American cutie-pie pop fans.</LD>
<TE>   At Spaceland on Friday, however, Ami Onuki and Yumi Yoshimura
proved to be something more than a melt-in-your-mouth confection.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Japanese pop bands like Pizzicato Five and Cibo Matto,
Puffy AmiYumi doesn't play the kitsch card.</TE>
<TE>   Its music is steeped in the buoyant tunefulness and steely
synthesizers of late '70s New Wave, but the band's approach is
refreshingly guileless.</TE>
<TE>   Backed by a strong quintet, Onuki and Yoshimura doubled up on the
same vocal lines, so that they sounded like a single multi-tracked
voice gliding smoothly over the plucky, guitar-stoked melodies.</TE>
<TE>   The band's lyrics were willfully dumbed-down cheers for young
lust, the beach, girls gone wild and other such trivial teen
pursuits.</TE>
<TE>   It was like watching the coolest kids in high school commandeer a
pep rally.</TE>

<HD>Beware Betting Too Heavily on Hot Sectors</HD>
<DH>Advisors say it's foolish for investors to try to make up
recent losses by 'doubling down' on streaking stock groups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you've lost a lot of your nest egg in the last two years and
you're desperate to rebuild it, you may be tempted to go the Vegas
route: "double down," betting heavily on what you hope will be the
stock market's new leaders.</LD>
<LD>   Most financial advisors say it's a foolish move. But it's easy to
understand why some investors would consider it.</LD>
<LD>   After all, technology stocks rode a nine-year cycle of superior
performance through 1999 before they crashed. Couldn't such sectors
as smaller stocks or health-care issues, which have led the market
over the last two years, be on their way toward similar performance
streaks?</LD>
<TE>   It's possible, experts say. But they note that the duration of
sector trends is always hard to predict. You could be investing
heavily just before a sector peaks--as many investors did with tech
stocks in the first quarter of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost every stock is cyclical in some way," said Sam Stovall, a
strategist at Standard &amp; Poor's in New York. "To paraphrase Andy
Warhol, they all have their 15 minutes--or 15 months--of fame and
then fade away, because you can't have accelerating fundamentals and
[stock] valuations forever."</TE>
<TE>   William Barrett, head of the Los Angeles office of Fiduciary Trust
International of California, which manages institutional and
high-net-worth accounts, said gold-mining and defense stocks, for
instance, have been benefiting from trends that should not be
construed as permanent.</TE>
<TE>   "The flight to security and quality is probably a short-term
reaction to everything that's going on in the world. People rush into
defense stocks and the gold sector out of fear, but eventually those
sectors will rise to a certain level and get overpriced," Barrett
said.</TE>
<TE>   For long-term investors, diversification, rather than concentrated
market bets, always will be the soundest strategy for generating
wealth, said Paul Merriman, head of Seattle-based Merriman Capital
Management and editor of the newsletter FundAdvice.com.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're betting big you're into speculating, not investing,"
Merriman said. "You're like a guy at the horse races who has a bad
day, then bets it all on a longshot in the last race, hoping to get
even. He is probably going to leave the track broke."</TE>
<TE>   The strong performance of gold this year exemplifies the point,
Merriman said: "Where were all the people saying that gold is going
to make this tremendous move? The truth is, they've been saying it
forever, and only now they can say, 'I told you so.' "</TE>
<TE>   Merriman believes that strategies based on market timing and
stock-sector rotation can work, but only for active traders who
monitor their portfolios daily or weekly.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, he said, "I would never have that much confidence about
industries as a buy-and-hold thing, but the major asset classes like
small-cap and value have a reasonable chance of continuing to
outperform."</TE>
<TE>   He believes that modestly over-weighting small-cap and value
stocks or funds in a portfolio can make sense, because historically
they have outperformed large-cap and growth stocks over long periods.</TE>
<TE>   Some stock sectors attract almost universal acclaim today--for
example, industries that could benefit long term from an aging
population.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the next 15 years, if you use demographics as your compass,
it points to opportunities for health care and finance," Stovall
said. "Health care because the biggest population growth is going to
come among those age 50 and up, and they will have plenty of aches,
pains and serious illnesses; finance because people are retiring and
they're going to look at their portfolios and say, 'I need some help
here!' "</TE>
<TE>   But within those sectors some companies will benefit more and some
will benefit less. If you, or your sector-fund manager, pick the
wrong companies, your returns could be dismal.</TE>
<TE>   Stovall is wary of the drug industry in the near term, for
example, because generic drugs, uncertain product pipelines and a
tougher Food and Drug Administration are weighing on many key
companies, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Will Muggia, co-manager of the Touchstone Emerging Growth fund,
agreed, saying that although he likes health care, it's "important to
pick your spots." Along with HMO stocks, he likes orthopedic-device
makers, whose sales are improving and could continue to benefit from
the demographic tailwind, he said.</TE>

<HD>Bonds Again Set to Outdo Stocks</HD>
<DH>High-quality issues shine comparatively through the first
half of '02 as corporate scandals weigh down stock prices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Corporate scandals and falling stock prices spurred a "flight to
quality" that helped government bond mutual funds outperform most
other fixed-income categories in the second quarter.</LD>
<LD>   On the other end of the spectrum, corporate junk bond funds were
hammered as investors' appetite for risk diminished sharply.</LD>
<LD>   Funds that invest in long-term government securities posted an
average total return of 4.8% for the quarter, according to
Morningstar Inc. That return counts interest earned and principal
appreciation.</LD>
<TE>   Older bonds rose in value as the benchmark 10-year Treasury note
yield slid from 5.40% to 4.80% during the three-month period.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury bond yields fell in part because investors lost some of
their conviction that the U.S. economy is rebounding strongly from
recession, and they sought Treasuries as a shelter.</TE>
<TE>   Reports in the quarter gave a mixed view of the U.S. economy's
health, and many analysts pushed back to the fourth quarter or even
later their estimate of when the Federal Reserve would begin raising
short-term interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps an even greater reason for the rush to Treasuries was
the crisis of confidence on Wall Street, which made paper backed by
Uncle Sam look all the more appealing. A string of charges against
executives, accounting blowups and fraud investigations soured
investors on stocks. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index's total return
was a negative 13.4% in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   What was bad for the stock market also was bad for junk bond
funds, which invest in bonds of firms with the weakest credit
ratings. The average junk bond fund's total return was a negative
4.6% in the quarter. The sector suffered another blow as conditions
in the telecom industry--which issued tens of billions in corporate
debt in recent years--continued to worsen.</TE>
<TE>   Higher-quality corporate bond funds fared well in the quarter,
with long-term investment-grade funds posting an average total return
of 2.5%. Municipal bond funds also had strong returns.</TE>
<TE>   International bond funds led the pack with a 6.7% average gain, as
a weak dollar boosted the value of overseas returns.</TE>
<TE>   Halfway through 2002, high-quality bonds are poised to outperform
stocks for the third year running, drawing the attention of investors
who have spent the last decade firmly committed to stocks.</TE>
<TE>   But experts said investors eyeing bond funds should know the
risks: If interest rates in general begin to rise later this year or
in 2003, bond returns could suffer.</TE>
<TE>   Rising market rates depress the value of older bonds. So fund
investors still will be earning interest income, but their share
values will fall in a rising-rate environment.</TE>
<TE>   Still, interest earnings mean high-quality bonds provide the kind
of cushion for a portfolio that stock funds can't. And funds that
invest in shorter-term or intermediate-term bonds generally have
lower risk of principal loss because of interest rate swings.</TE>
<TE>   Investors stepping into bond funds should seek out managers whose
objectives and risk tolerance match their own, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   And when checking a fund's performance, "make sure the guy who
generated the returns is still running the fund," said Alan Papier, a
senior analyst with Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   For most investors, the best bond funds are diversified and give
their managers great flexibility to use sophisticated strategies,
Papier said. He particularly likes the Los Angeles-based FPA New
Income fund, an intermediate-term bond fund managed by Bob Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez has cut the average maturity of his holdings to about
two years in anticipation of higher rates, Papier said. The fund's
total return in the first half was 5.8%.</TE>

<HD>Overseas Funds Mostly Beating Domestic Rivals</HD>
<DH>U.S. malaise spreads, but the weak dollar cushions foreign
losses. Asian markets perform best in the first half.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many foreign stock markets got off to a promising start in the first
quarter, but the woes that dragged down the U.S. market in the second
quarter also infected overseas shares.</LD>
<LD>   Still, thanks to the weak dollar, foreign stock mutual funds in
general were a far better place for Americans to be invested than
Wall Street in the first half.</LD>
<LD>   That's a turnabout from recent years, when the U.S. market
consistently beat major foreign markets.</LD>
<TE>   Overall, Asian markets were the best performers in the first half,
while European stocks suffered some of the biggest declines outside
the U.S. In the Americas, the Mexican and Canadian equity markets
held up relatively well, while Brazilian shares sank on renewed
worries about the nation's heavy debt load.</TE>
<TE>   The average international stock fund slipped 0.4% in the first
half, compared with an 11.7% loss for the average U.S. fund,
according to Morningstar Inc.</TE>
<TE>   In the second quarter the average international fund was off 4.1%,
while the average U.S. fund lost 12.2%.</TE>
<TE>   "The malaise is broadly based" in recent months, said Alan Brown,
chief investment officer at the world's biggest money manager, State
Street Global Advisors, with assets of $806 billion. "I suspect we're
not going to get out of this much before next year."</TE>
<TE>   Investors worldwide have been worried about the pace of the global
economy's recovery and the speed with which corporate earnings will
rebound.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, those worries have been compounded by a
mounting distrust of corporate financial reports in general, in the
wake of the many accounting scandals that have dominated the business
headlines.</TE>
<TE>   That distrust spread to Europe last week, when debt-laden
entertainment giant Vivendi Universal disclosed financial woes that
led to the ouster of its chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   "Individuals are feeling dismayed and are very reluctant to commit
money to the market," said Stuart Schweitzer, global investment
strategist at J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management, which has $600
billion in assets.</TE>
<TE>   The sell-off this year has been as bad in Europe as in the United
States, as measured by the changes in major blue-chip share indexes.</TE>
<TE>   The French market's key index, the CAC-40, was down 16.5% year to
date through Friday (that includes Friday's powerful rebound in most
European markets). Germany's main index was down 13.1% and Spain's
key index was down 15.7%. All of those declines are in euro-currency
terms.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, the U.S. Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 13.9% as of
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   But because the euro has risen sharply against the dollar this
year, U.S. investors' losses in European stocks have been muted.</TE>
<TE>   Through Friday, the French market's loss in dollar terms was 8.7%,
the German market's decline in dollars was 5% and the Spanish
market's loss was 7.8%.</TE>
<TE>   How it works: As the euro rises in value, a portfolio of
investments denominated in euros translates into more dollars.</TE>
<TE>   One euro now is worth about 97 cents. At the start of the year the
value was about 89 cents.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar also weakened against the Japanese yen and other Asian
currencies in the first half, boosting U.S. investors' returns in the
region. Japan's Nikkei-225 stock index is up 2.7% in yen terms year
to date, but for U.S. investors the index is up 12.3%.</TE>
<TE>   The South Korean market's main index is up 13.6% in local currency
terms this year, and up 24.6% in dollar terms.</TE>
<TE>   Global investors in the first half seemed to remain most
optimistic about Asian markets' prospects. In contrast to the
declines in Europe and the United States, markets in Thailand,
Malaysia and Singapore, among others, still are positive for the year
in local currency terms. Hong Kong and Taiwan indexes are off about
5% this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Against the backdrop of only very moderate export growth, it has
been domestic demand that has proved to be the key driver of both
[economic] growth and stock performance" in much of Asia, Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. noted in a June report on the region.</TE>
<TE>   In Japan, smaller-company stocks were the top performers,
mirroring the better relative performance of U.S. small stocks. The
biggest gainer among foreign stock funds in the second quarter was
the Fidelity Japan Smaller Companies fund, up 19.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller Asian markets, and emerging markets such as Russia, also
weathered Argentina's currency devaluation in the second quarter
without severe spillover effects.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, though the Mexican market has surrendered most of its
gains this year, it's still slightly positive since Jan. 1 in peso
terms.</TE>
<TE>   As with the U.S. stock market, how foreign markets will fare in
the second half may depend on the pace of the economic recovery and
how that translates to the corporate bottom line, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   European blue-chip corporate operating earnings are expected to
grow by an average of 26% this year, according to Thomson Market
Strategy Group.</TE>
<TE>   That compares with a 7% growth estimate for the S&amp;P 500 companies
in 2002, based on analysts' estimates as tracked by Thomson First
Call.</TE>
<TE>   Expectations of better economic prospects outside the U.S., and a
growing disgust over American accounting scandals, have been major
factors in knocking down the dollar this year.</TE>
<TE>   A recent Merrill Lynch survey of 282 fund managers at institutions
worldwide found that investors have less money in U.S. stocks than at
any time since February 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "The best opportunities are probably to be found overseas, outside
the U.S.," Schweitzer said. "The dollar is in the midst of a
downdraft that may go on for a while."</TE>
<TE>   The only problem with that view is that it's so widely held--which
means the market may delight in going the other way. And if the
dollar surprises investors by rebounding, it will work against U.S.
owners of foreign stocks by devaluing their holdings--the story of
much of the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The euro began to weaken last week after peaking at nearly $1
early in the week.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some analysts say that after a lengthy period of
under-performing U.S. stocks, foreign markets are overdue for an
extended winning streak, at least relatively speaking.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Pelosky, global investment strategist at brokerage Morgan
Stanley, contends that foreign economies and markets are "decoupling"
from the United States, which had been the engine of growth in the
'90s. That will favor foreign markets at Wall Street's expense, and
at the dollar's expense, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he warns that foreign markets won't be well-served if the
dollar goes into a free fall. "For decoupling, we need a gradual
weakening of the dollar, not a collapse," Pelosky said.</TE>
<TE>   A stronger euro has helped U.S. investors in European stocks this
year, but it also has negative implications for European exporters by
raising the cost of their exports.</TE>
<TE>   On the plus side, a strong euro reduces the cost of American
imports for European buyers, which puts downward pressure on
inflation on the Continent.</TE>
<TE>   That's one reason the European Central Bank has been able to hold
off raising interest rates this year, and may continue to do so until
the fall, experts say. Continued low rates could help stocks regain
appeal.</TE>

<HD>For Income Seekers, There Are Alternatives</HD>
<DH>Unattractive returns on money market funds and high-quality
bonds are prompting investors to look elsewhere.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After the stock market's 28-month slide, many weary investors now are
much more interested in securities that generate regular income--a
financial return they can count on.</LD>
<LD>   But investors face a special challenge today: Yields on money
market accounts are near 40-year lows, and interest paid on
high-quality bonds is paltry.</LD>
<LD>   The average yield on a taxable money market mutual fund is 1.33%,
down from 1.59% at the beginning of the year, according to
rate-tracking firm IMoneyNet Inc. in Westborough, Mass.</LD>
<TE>   The yield on 10-year Treasury notes is 4.86%, down from 5.11% six
months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, investors who earlier this year took a chance on
certain higher-yielding alternative investments, such as corporate
"junk" bonds, have been burned.</TE>
<TE>   Junk bonds have sold off sharply in recent weeks as investors
decided the economy's recovery won't soon lift many of these "fallen
angels."</TE>
<TE>   And emerging-market bond mutual funds, the top-performing bond
fund sector until a few weeks ago, recently demonstrated their
classic volatility when they plummeted on fears that Brazil will
elect a leftist regime that will default on the nation's debt.</TE>
<TE>   As all this spurs income seekers to search far and wide for other
ideas, options such as municipal bonds, inflation-indexed Treasury
bonds and the "stable-value" funds found in many 401(k) plans look
attractive to conservative investors, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The more risk-tolerant may want to consider high-dividend-paying
stocks or mutual funds that invest in these stocks (such as real
estate investment trust funds).</TE>
<TE>   However, a cardinal rule of investing should remain uppermost in
income seekers' minds, said Alan Papier, a senior analyst with
Chicago fund tracker Morningstar Inc.: "High yield is achieved only
by taking on extra risk."</TE>
<TE>   The risk these days is not just of more bond defaults by shaky
corporate issuers, although that's clearly a concern. There also is
so-called market risk: After 11 Federal Reserve interest rate cuts
last year, the next direction for rates is almost certainly up,
assuming the economy continues to recover.</TE>
<TE>   And when rates begin to rise, the effect will be to depress the
principal value of older securities that are locked in at a lower
rate--especially longer-term bonds, including otherwise super-safe
Treasuries.</TE>
<TE>   For income seekers, that risk means investments must be chosen
very carefully. You must decide whether you can stand any risk of
loss to your principal, even on paper.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a look at some income-producing options other than money
market funds, conventional Treasury securities and corporate bonds:</TE>
<TE>   Certificates of Deposit</TE>
<TE>   Although today's bank CD rates won't make anyone rich, they can
keep investors ahead of inflation while they wait for better
alternatives. And it does pay to shop around: For example, in
Southern California recently, Kaiser Federal, a credit
union-turned-savings institution, was paying about a percentage point
higher on its CDs than comparable Treasury securities.</TE>
<TE>   Newspapers and business publications often publish lists of
high-paying bank and thrift CDs, but the most current rates are
online: Bankrate.com, for example, lists top-paying institutions not
only nationally but also by city and state.</TE>
<TE>   Bank and thrift CDs are as safe as Treasury securities--up to the
$100,000 per account limit on federal insurance. As with bonds, the
longer you agree to lock up your principal, the higher the interest
paid.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the highest rate on a one-year CD shown on Bankrate was
3.30% from ING Direct in Wilmington, Del. The national average on
one-year CDs: 2.16%. If money market fund rates stay in their current
1.33% range well into next year--a strong possibility, many experts
believe--CDs maturing in a year or less may be a better idea.</TE>
<TE>   TIPS</TE>
<TE>   The current 4.86% yield on conventional 10-year T-notes is at
least a positive return after inflation, but that could change fast
if the cost of living surges. Why can't bond returns rise along with
inflation?</TE>
<TE>   The answer is that some do: Uncle Sam has issued bonds that
guarantee a total return--interest payments plus return of
principal--of about 3 percentage points more than the change in the
consumer price index over time. If inflation shot up to 6% annually,
the return on these Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS,
would rise to 9%.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could get every grandma in America to own these things,"
said Jeffery Coyle, chief strategy officer for MyCFO Inc., a Mountain
View, Calif., financial advisory firm for the wealthy.</TE>
<TE>   Because of their structure, TIPS are a good idea for generating
income in tax-sheltered retirement accounts, Coyle said. Pimco Funds
and Vanguard Group both offer large mutual funds that invest in
inflation-protected bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Stable-Value Funds</TE>
<TE>   These funds, an option in many 401(k) plans, also are available
through mutual fund companies in some individual retirement accounts
and college savings plans. They usually hold so-called guaranteed
investment contracts from insurance companies.</TE>
<TE>   GICs essentially are fixed-income investments that sacrifice a
small portion of return to purchase insurance against loss of
principal.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 401(k) plan participants had 29% of their retirement
assets allocated to stable-value funds, up from 25% in 2000,
according to a survey of plan assets. The average return for the year
ended May 31 was 5.95%, according to Hueler Analytics, a Minneapolis
data tracker.</TE>
<TE>   The returns have come down a bit lately--the Vanguard Retirement
Savings Trust, for instance, currently offers a yield of 5.4% after
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   But for many investors, stable-value funds offer a solid
income-producing asset that can cushion losses on stock assets.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're seeing a sea change among investors," said Gina
Mitchell, president of the Stable Value Investment Assn. "It's taken
a couple of years to realize that 401(k) accounts can really go down
because of overexposure to equities."</TE>
<TE>   Municipal Bonds</TE>
<TE>   Municipal bonds--issued by state and local governments, often to
fund roads, schools and other public projects--generally are exempt
from federal income tax, as well as from state income tax for
residents of the state in which they are issued.</TE>
<TE>   The tax exemption means that the nominal yields on the bonds may
be lower than what corporate and Treasury issues pay, but the true
yield--the "taxable equivalent" yield--often is much higher. And the
higher an investor's tax bracket is, the greater the true yield.</TE>
<TE>   Although a few local and state agencies fail to pay bondholders,
the chance of default on a muni bond from a major issuer--say, the
state of California--is virtually nil, said Zane Mann, publisher of
the California Municipal Bond Advisor newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   For investors looking to boost their income, and willing to accept
the risk inherent in any bond, munis now are a smart option,
especially given low Treasury yields, many financial advisors say.</TE>
<TE>   Some California muni bonds maturing in 15 years are yielding about
5.25%, Mann said. That's the equivalent of about 8% on a taxable bond
for a middle-income investor and 9% for those in the highest tax
brackets.</TE>
<TE>   But remember: The principal value of long-term muni bonds (and
long-term muni bond mutual funds) can fall sharply if market interest
rates rise. If you own an individual bond and plan to hold it to
maturity, that may not matter because all of your principal is
returned at maturity. But it could be an issue if you had to sell the
bond before maturity.</TE>
<TE>   Also note that munis are a bad choice for retirement savings plans
and college savings plans because you would be tax-sheltering a
security that already is tax-sheltered.</TE>
<TE>   REITs</TE>
<TE>   REITs are companies that invest in real estate--such as hotels,
industrial parks or apartment buildings--and pass most of their
profit to investors. They're an income option for people who can
handle moderate risk, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The current average REIT dividend yield of about 6.75% is about 2
percentage points above the yield on 10-year Treasury notes, a
typical spread for REITs compared with government bonds, said Craig
Silvers, a former brokerage analyst who recently formed Bricks &amp;
Mortar Capital, a West Los Angeles REIT investment advisory firm.</TE>
<TE>   But REITs are stocks, with all of the attendant risks: There is no
guarantee of principal.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the past couple of years REITs have been a good place to be,
but should the real estate market turn down, you could get hurt,"
said Morningstar analyst William Harding.</TE>
<TE>   Because individual REITs target specific real estate sectors,
investors must know what they're buying.</TE>
<TE>   Silvers' current view is that the hotel sector is too volatile,
shopping malls too unpredictable and the office building sector not
ready to recover. But he likes REITs invested in food and drug
shopping centers, as well as industrial properties.</TE>
<TE>   Apartment REITs are attractive for investors who think the housing
markets will remain strong, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although REITs are only about a fifth as volatile as the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 stock index, they are equity investments suitable only
for investors willing to tie up their money for two or three years
and who can tolerate some ups and downs in the stock price, Silvers
said.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't a place to park money for six months until you buy a
house or a car," Silvers said.</TE>
<TE>   Another REIT option: mutual funds that own these shares.</TE>
<TE>   High-Dividend Stocks</TE>
<TE>   When share prices fall while corporate dividend payments remain
the same, the dividend yields on stocks automatically rise. That's
apparent of late: Investors need look no further than the Dow Jones
industrial average to find stocks with dividend yields that are
higher than typical money market fund yields.</TE>
<TE>   The annualized dividend yield on Philip Morris stock, for example,
is 5.0%. (That's calculated by dividing the annual dividend of $2.32
a share by the stock price, recently about $46.)</TE>
<TE>   Eastman Kodak's annualized dividend yield is about 6.3%; Du Pont's
is 3.1%; Exxon Mobil's is 2.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Those yields may be little consolation if the stocks continue to
slide, of course. Kodak's share price has fallen 33% over the last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, there is always the risk that a dividend could be cut by
the company.</TE>
<TE>   Still, dividend yields are a reminder that some stocks can provide
at least a moderate income cushion.</TE>
<TE>   Harding advises income-seeking investors to focus on companies
that show a history of gradual dividend increases.</TE>
<TE>   The search for consistent income can spotlight little-known
companies such as Cedar Fair, an amusement park operator whose
holdings include Knotts Berry Farm in Buena Park.</TE>
<TE>   Cedar Fair, a partnership traded on the New York Stock Exchange,
has increased its quarterly dividend payment from 20 cents a share in
1991 to 41 cents now, never missing a payout. The annualized yield is
about 7.2% based on the current stock price.</TE>

<HD>Guide to Morningstar's Top-Rated Funds</HD>
<DH>The research firm's new 'star' rating system now ranks the
funds on a bell curve over several time periods.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With more than 10,000 mutual funds to choose from, many investors
cringe at the task of making selections.</LD>
<LD>   With today's special quarterly fund report, The Times and
independent research firm Morningstar Inc. provide several ways to
evaluate funds--including measurements designed to help investors
determine a fund's performance relative to its peers using
Morningstar's revamped "star" system.</LD>
<LD>   The tables on the next several pages list the best-performing
funds in each of Morningstar's major fund categories over the last
three years (ended June 28), as determined by the firm's proprietary
rating system. That three-year period includes the end of the bull
market surge of 1999 and early 2000 as well as the bear market that
began in March 2000. Only funds with three years of history are
included.</LD>
<TE>   Here's how the funds were ranked:</TE>
<TE>   * First, each fund has an overall star ranking (5 stars is best,
followed by 4, etc.) based on its risk-adjusted performance versus
its peers in 48 different fund categories, as measured over several
time periods (three, five and 10 years, as applicable). This marks a
major change for Morningstar, which until this quarter had based its
star ratings on performance within a broad class of funds, such as
domestic equity or municipal bond.</TE>
<TE>   According to Morningstar, the new system is fairer because it
measures a fund's performance against others with the same investment
goals. Now, funds are graded on a bell curve within each category, so
the comparisons are "apples to apples," according to Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new system, more than half of the funds in Morningstar's
universe have gained or lost stars. For example, in the large-cap
growth category, American Funds' Growth Fund of America has gained a
fifth star, as has the large-cap blend fund Fidelity Growth &amp; Income.
Conversely, several small-cap value funds have lost stars.</TE>
<TE>   * Second, within each overall rating score (i.e., first the 5s,
then the 4s, etc.) funds are ranked by actual three-year performance
within the category as a whole, expressed as a percentile figure (1
to 100, with 1 being best). That is the "three-year rank" column.</TE>
<TE>   For funds with multiple classes (i.e., A and B shares, etc.) only
the best-performing class is included.</TE>
<TE>   To determine order, ties in the first two columns were broken by
manager tenure.</TE>
<TE>   * Next, a secondary, three-year star rating appears in the third
column, assessing a fund's performance based solely on the trailing
three-year period, a span that many financial analysts use to get a
quick snapshot of performance in recent years. The number of stars
(again, on a scale of 1 through 5, with 5 being the best) is an
assessment of performance and level of risk for that fund compared
against its peer group: small-cap value, for example, or large-cap
growth.</TE>
<TE>   Funds that are less than 5 years old will have the same overall
and three-year ratings, but older funds (whose overall ratings are
based on a weighted average of the different periods) may have
different three-year and overall star ratings.</TE>
<TE>   A word about categories:</TE>
<TE>   Morningstar does not categorize funds based solely on a fund's
self-description. Rather, it also looks at each fund's actual
holdings to determine category.</TE>
<TE>   The largest groups of funds are domestic equity funds, which
Morningstar organizes by the average size (market capitalization) of
companies owned and by a fund's general investment philosophy. These
appear on the next page.</TE>
<TE>   Want to see how other funds shape up? Appearing after these four
pages are listings of the 4,500 largest mutual funds, listed by
family name from A to Z, with category type, rankings and performance
data for each. Also listed are funds' phone numbers. (A few
late-reporting funds are not ranked.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Morningstar Offers Broad Range of Mutual Fund Data</TE>
<TE>   Mutual fund data in this section are based primarily on
information from fund tracker Morningstar Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Morningstar is a privately owned company founded in 1984 to
provide investors with information from an independent source for use
in making investment decisions. Its "star" rating system is used by
financial planners, cited in advertisements and used as a guide by
investors and the media.</TE>

<HD>Shelter From the Storm</HD>
<DH>Even as the slump deepened, some sectors held up well. When
the downturn ends, focus will be on new leaders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN and TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No storm lasts forever. But how many second winds will there be for
the tempest that has been battering the stock market since March
2000?</LD>
<LD>   Major share indexes tumbled in the second quarter, leaving the
market with its worst decline for any calendar first half since 1970.</LD>
<LD>   The blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index dropped 13.4% in the
quarter and 13.2% in the half, including dividend income. The
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite sank 20.6% in the quarter and 24.8%
in the half.</LD>
<TE>   What has ailed the stock market this year are, to a large degree,
more of the same issues that have dominated since shortly after the
new millennium dawned: worries about the outlook for economic and
corporate profit growth; fear that the world has become a much more
dangerous, and therefore risky, place; and the sense that stock
valuations simply became too giddy in the late 1990s and haven't yet
sobered up enough.</TE>
<TE>   The market hardly needed another dark cloud to arrive, but one did
anyway: the torrent of corporate accounting scandals, further dashing
investors' faith in stocks.</TE>
<TE>   With the losses this year, key share indexes are in danger of
declining for three straight calendar years. That hasn't happened
since the war years of 1939-41.</TE>
<TE>   By one measure, the average domestic stock mutual fund already is
in the red for the three years ended June 28. Fund tracker
Morningstar Inc. calculates the average annual return on the typical
domestic fund at negative 4.3% for the three years.</TE>
<TE>   That marks the first time since 1975 that the three-year average
return has been negative. All in all, then, investors would have been
better off keeping their money in a bank savings account than in a
stock fund since mid-1999.</TE>
<TE>   But without papering over the severe losses wrought by this bear
market, investors would be wise to keep perspective, financial
advisors say: Many stocks, and stock funds, have fared far better
than the S&amp;P and Nasdaq indexes this year and over the last three
years.</TE>
<TE>   Though technology stocks seem to have become a black hole, shares
of smaller companies, "value"-oriented shares such as real estate
investment trusts and even many foreign stocks have offered relative
safety this year.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the average small-stock value fund was up 4.5% in the
first half and has risen at an annualized rate of 11.8% in the last
three years, according to Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   The average real estate fund rose 13.3% in the first half and has
gained 12.6% a year over the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that too few investors diversified into those
sectors in the late 1990s. Rather, their portfolios were, and perhaps
still are, overloaded with big-name "growth" stocks and technology.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, many growth-fund managers themselves have remained
heavily invested in tech stocks, betting that the bottom had been
reached. "Recent returns show that the [growth] group is still
shackled to technology's misfortunes," fund tracker Lipper Inc. said
in its midyear report.</TE>
<TE>   But the market malaise in the second quarter gripped more than
just beaten-down tech issues. Doubts about the truthfulness of
corporate accounting added to selling pressure in many non-tech
blue-chip issues. Home Depot Inc. slid 24% in price, for instance.
Johnson &amp; Johnson lost nearly 20%, General Electric Co. sank 22% and
Citigroup Inc. fell 22%.</TE>
<TE>   The equity market's continuing losses may be causing more
investors to ask that most basic question: Should they even be in the
stock market?</TE>
<TE>   Older investors, or those saving for a goal such as college
tuition, may have a temptation to give up--or at least lighten up--on
stocks.</TE>
<TE>   It's never too late, or too early, to make changes that improve
your portfolio diversification, financial advisors say. Still, they
warn that dumping stocks wholesale at this point might well mean
selling low.</TE>
<TE>   "Market timing is a dangerous and difficult thing to do. But if
you are going to try to time the market, the question is whether now
is the right time to get out," said Scott Leonard, a financial
planner in Manhattan Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "We may be nearing the end of the downturn," he said, noting that
the duration of this bear market makes it one of the longest in
modern history.</TE>
<TE>   Tom McKissick, co-manager of the TCW Galileo Large Cap Value fund
in Los Angeles, expressed a similar view. "Not so long ago the
definition of risk was, 'I don't want to be left behind. It's a new
era and I want to be in the [market] game.' It used to be scary to be
out of the market, and now it's kind of scary to be in it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But the last extreme was proven wrong, and I don't think this
extreme will go on forever either. I think we're closer to the eighth
inning of all this, rather than the second," McKissick said.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, most advisors say money that might be needed within a
few years should never be in stocks in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Also, many investors have learned the hard way that their
portfolios needed a buffer against stock losses. Bonds, bank CDs and
other income-generating investments have gained a new appreciation
with many Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "People should reassess their portfolios and consider
rebalancing," Leonard said. "If you're truly diversified you should
not be down more than 5% [in your overall portfolio] in the last two
years."</TE>
<TE>   Even when the bear market has breathed its last, the question is
what kind of market will follow. A new, rip-roaring bull? A market
that trades sideways for years? A classic stock-picker's market in
which there will be as many stock losers as winners?</TE>
<TE>   One thing seems certain: Barring economic meltdown, some companies
and industries will fare well in this decade. Investors who can
identify them have a better chance of making money on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   In the first half of this year, many stock sectors posted
double-digit gains despite the double-digit losses in broad market
indexes.</TE>
<TE>   Within the S&amp;P 500, strong stock groups this year have included
metals and mining, housewares, managed health care, aerospace and
home builders.</TE>
<TE>   Within the S&amp;P 600 small-stock index, the leading groups have
included home improvement retailers, commodity chemical companies,
recreational vehicle makers and footwear makers.</TE>
<TE>   Whether those sectors can continue to lead is anyone's guess. But
as investors review the performance of their stock mutual funds this
year, a key question to ask is whether your fund managers are
invested in sectors and individual stocks that you believe could be
poised for growth.</TE>
<TE>   If your fund manager still is focused on tech, and you don't
believe tech will lead any market rebound, you could be in the wrong
fund.</TE>
<TE>   "People should always look at their overall portfolios and their
specific fund managers to make sure they are on the same page," said
John Snider, who co-manages TCW Galileo Large Cap Value with
McKissick. "You don't need periods of extreme volatility to ask
whether you have a manager with the same philosophy of investing."</TE>
<TE>   Whitney George, manager of the Royce Low-Priced Stock and Royce
Micro-Cap funds in New York, has been in the market's sweet spot in
recent years: small-cap value. He thinks the category may retain its
edge, but by a thinning margin.</TE>
<TE>   "Going forward I'd expect things like the ... fund category to be
less important than they have been," George said. "It's going to be a
stock-picker's market, a muddled picture in an era of modest
returns."</TE>
<TE>   George's bottom-up approach to investing has led him to areas more
traditionally favored by growth investors. His funds currently have
weightings of 15% to 20% in tech and 10% to 15% in health care, both
of which are higher than normal, he said, as the drubbing in tech and
biotech stocks has created buying opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, George has shied away from some traditional
value sectors such as banks and home builders that have done well
over the last year, lifting the valuations of those shares.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, George believes that the red-hot gold-mining sector
might have steam left.</TE>
<TE>   "Gold may be coming out of a 20-year bear market. A lot of mining
company executives are certainly hoping that this move from $260 to
$310 [an ounce] isn't all there is," George said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the mining industry can continue to benefit from the
"dramatic consolidation" of recent years, and that strong performance
could beget continuing strong performance as more investors look to
diversify their equity bets.</TE>
<TE>   With gold, "many people are rediscovering an asset class that had
been written off, just as small-cap value was in 1998," George said.
"They called us a dinosaur, and the same thing happened with gold.
But people are going to be looking at their mutual fund tables over
the next couple of weeks, and gold is bound to attract attention--and
money--from investors."</TE>
<TE>   As for smaller stocks, Sam Stovall, strategist at Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. in New York, said small-cap leadership cycles tend to
last three to five years. So if history is a guide, this one could
have another six months or more to run, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, Stovall said, a cycle of small-cap leadership peaks
with the price-to-earnings ratio of the small-cap S&amp;P 600 index at a
30% premium to the big-cap S&amp;P 500's P/E. Recently, small-cap
valuations pulled about even with large-caps, with both sectors
priced at 18 to 20 times estimated operating earnings per share over
the next 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   Will Muggia, co-manager of the Touchstone Emerging Growth fund,
said he likes the longer-term prospects for energy and biotechnology.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. economic recovery is likely to drive demand for energy,
particularly in the natural gas segment, Muggia said.</TE>
<TE>   And with many biotech shares down more than 40% year to date, "a
lot of those stocks have gotten too cheap to ignore," Muggia said.
But in the risky and volatile biotech sector, it's important to focus
on companies with clean balance sheets and products in late
development or headed to market, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Muggia and McKissick said that, unlike George, they have largely
steered clear of tech and telecom, noting that capital spending
remains depressed.</TE>
<TE>   McKissick said he and Snider still prefer old-line sectors such as
railroads and industrial gas producers, along with a smattering of
"broken growth stocks" such as retailers Gap and Toys R Us.</TE>
<TE>   "These are companies where we're anticipating a turnaround after a
period of mismanagement," McKissick said. "We could be wrong, of
course, but the stocks are priced at low enough multiples so that the
downside is probably limited."</TE>

<HD>Conservative Funds Gain Luster in Declining Market</HD>
<DH>American Funds, Dodge &amp; Cox and Vanguard Group attract
investors with their slow but steady approach.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For stock fund investors, one of the lasting effects of this bear
market may be a new respect for "middle-ground" portfolio management.</LD>
<LD>   Conservative fund companies, including American Funds, Dodge &amp; Cox
and the index-oriented Vanguard Group, typically don't try to shoot
the lights out with their performance in bull markets, but neither do
they risk losing massive amounts of their shareholders' money in down
markets.</LD>
<LD>   Fans of these old-school funds say there's never a bad time to buy
them. That may soothe the nerves of investors who want to keep their
money in stocks but can't stand the risk of severe losses if the bear
market continues.</LD>
<TE>   "Investors are jittery about where to place their hard-earned
dollars, which leads them to funds that have stood the test of time
with a sound strategy and low annual expenses," said William Harding,
an analyst at Chicago-based fund tracker Morningstar Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "They know Dodge &amp; Cox, American Funds and Vanguard are not going
to do anything crazy. Maybe they didn't keep up with the Janus Funds
and some of the others during the late '90s, but their prudent,
efficient approach shows that if you have decent performance year
after year, slow and steady can ultimately win the race."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Russel Kinnel, Morningstar's director of fund analysis: "This
market has been highlighting who's good at fundamental analysis. The
funds that bought companies that were faking it a few years ago are
getting killed now."</TE>
<TE>   The strong relative performance of American Funds, Vanguard and
Dodge &amp; Cox portfolios this year already has brought many investors
to the companies' doors.</TE>
<TE>   American Funds and Vanguard have been the two best-selling fund
groups this year, according to Boston-based consulting firm Financial
Research Corp.</TE>
<TE>   At No. 5 in net cash inflows this year, Dodge &amp; Cox's sales have
zoomed as a percentage of its total assets, according to Financial
Research. (Vanguard and American funds are the No. 2 and No. 3 fund
groups, respectively, based on total stock and bond fund assets, but
Dodge &amp; Cox is not in the top 25.)</TE>
<TE>   The Vanguard, American and Dodge &amp; Cox funds have low management
expenses, low volatility and a tax-efficient buy-and-hold strategy in
common.</TE>
<TE>   American Funds and Dodge &amp; Cox have another major similarity:
Their funds are managed by experienced teams rather than by single
"star" managers.</TE>
<TE>   At Vanguard, a team headed by Gus Sauter runs the company's index
funds. The actively managed funds are farmed out to sub-advisors.</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard and Dodge &amp; Cox sell their funds directly to investors,
without sales charges.</TE>
<TE>   American Funds has a different approach: Its funds are sold only
through financial advisors, including financial planners and brokers.
That has been the policy of the funds' Los Angeles-based parent,
Capital Group, since its forerunner was founded in 1931.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of financial advisors are looking over the returns for
various funds and saying, 'Maybe American Funds is not the most
exciting company, but the long-term performance is solid,' " said
Lars Schuster, an analyst at Financial Research. "Some of these
advisors might have gotten burned in the past chasing a fund that was
up 90% the year before, only to turn cold."</TE>
<TE>   Harding said several of the American funds, including Washington
Mutual Investors, Investment Co. of America, Growth Fund of America
and American Balanced, make solid core holdings for any portfolio.
The funds are popular in company 401(k) retirement savings plans.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual (which fell 4% in the first half, compared with
a 13.1% negative total return for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index) is
a "dyed-in-the-wool value offering," Harding said. The fund cushions
its performance by favoring blue-chip companies with a consistent
history of paying dividends.</TE>
<TE>   Investment Co. of America (down 7.2% in the first half) is a
blue-chip fund whose portfolio mix includes a sprinkling of
beaten-down growth stocks along with many classic value names; Growth
Fund of America (down 15.6%) is relatively racy, a large-cap
portfolio that seeks growth stocks selling for reasonable prices; and
American Balanced (down 2.3%) is a stock-bond hybrid "ideal for
cautious investors," Harding said.</TE>
<TE>   All four funds have 10-year returns that rank them in the top 25%
of their Morningstar categories.</TE>
<TE>   Harding said American Funds' weak spot is in the small-cap area:
"You may want to look elsewhere for exposure to smaller stocks."</TE>
<TE>   Dodge &amp; Cox, meanwhile, offers a simple lineup of just four funds
(Stock, Income, Balanced and International Stock). The 72-year-old
San Francisco-based firm focuses on big-company stocks and is
considered more of a pure value shop than American Funds.</TE>
<TE>   The flagship Dodge &amp; Cox Stock fund (down 1.6% in the first half)
"only keeps about 80 stocks in the portfolio, but it is never prone
to extreme positions," said Phil Edwards, director of fund research
at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. in New York. "It's a fund for people
looking for a nice, stable investment, something that lets them sleep
at night."</TE>
<TE>   Dodge &amp; Cox carefully weighs the downside when making investments,
said Wendell Birkhofer, one of 10 portfolio managers who run the
stock funds with the help of 16 research analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "Our chief investment officer likes to say that we should follow a
Hippocratic oath: 'Thou shalt do no harm to your clients,' "
Birkhofer said. "We look out three to four years and ask, 'What is
the most pessimistic case if the company doesn't execute well or the
economy goes bad?' Then the question is, 'How much of that downside
is reflected in the current stock price?' "</TE>
<TE>   Though the risk-averse strategy has kept the firm away from
landmines such as Enron Corp., Tyco International Ltd., Adelphia
Communications Corp. and WorldCom Inc., it was stuck holding Kmart
Corp. stock this year when the retailer filed for bankruptcy
protection.</TE>
<TE>   "We do make mistakes. We thought the company was making progress
in its turnaround strategy, but we were too optimistic," Birkhofer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, portfolio diversification paid off, he said: Kmart cost
Dodge &amp; Cox Stock about 1 percentage point in performance in the
first quarter, he estimated, but the fund still gained 4.9% in the
period.</TE>
<TE>   As for Valley Forge, Pa.-based Vanguard, Kinnel said the firm's
index funds are a prime example of how "diversification takes away a
lot of the pain of a down market."</TE>
<TE>   The Vanguard Total Stock Market Index fund, which tracks the
Wilshire 5,000 broad market index, lost 11.8% in the first half. That
kind of drop has to hurt, but it doesn't sting as much as the 18.2%
plunge for the average large-cap growth fund in the period.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Total Stock Market fund and the Vanguard 500 Index,
which tracks the S&amp;P 500, are diversified against individual stock
risk by holding at least several hundred names, they are dominated by
their biggest stocks, since the underlying indexes are
capitalization-weighted.</TE>
<TE>   That's why many financial advisors have long championed the idea
of portfolio diversification that includes small and mid-size stocks.
An equally weighted portfolio of Vanguard's Small Cap Index, Mid Cap
Index and 500 Index funds would have lost 7% in the first half, as
the better performance of smaller shares would have cushioned the
losses in bigger stocks.</TE>
<TE>   American Funds and Dodge &amp; Cox are known for their prowess with
large-cap stocks, but investors seeking conservative, actively
managed small- or mid-cap funds might want to consider Chicago-based
Ariel Funds, S&amp;P's Edwards said.</TE>
<TE>   The flagship Ariel Fund (up 3.8% in the first half), managed by
John Rogers, focuses on small-cap stocks. Ariel Appreciation (up
1.2%), managed by Eric McKissack, is a mid-cap fund.</TE>
<TE>   Although the low-turnover funds are sometimes classified by
Morningstar as "blend" (a mix of growth and value), the Ariel shop
has a value bent, Edwards said.</TE>
<TE>   He also likes New York-based Baron Growth (down 0.8% in the first
half), a small-cap growth fund run by Ron Baron, who also uses a
buy-and-hold approach.</TE>

<HD>Making Changes at Home Can Be a Wise Investment</HD>
<DH>Homeowners can reap big rewards by fixing up their houses,
increasing payments or carrying back mortgages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to getting a decent return on their investment dollars
these days, for many people there's no place like home.</LD>
<LD>   Homeowners with money to invest and no desire to put it into
financial markets have two strong options for boosting the investment
in their houses: paying down their mortgage and improving the
property.</LD>
<LD>   And if you're looking to sell your house, you may be able to use
it to generate a long-term income stream at attractive returns.</LD>
<TE>   Here's a look at the risks and potential rewards of these three
ideas:</TE>
<TE>   Pay Down the Mortgage</TE>
<TE>   Paying off your mortgage ahead of schedule is the easiest way to
invest in your real estate, said Marc Eisenson, co-author of "Invest
in Yourself: Six Secrets to a Rich Life."</TE>
<TE>   You can do this by following a formula that frees up extra cash to
pay down the loan, or by using any discretionary income you have left
at the end of the month to make higher payments on your loan, he
said. "It is truly a self-directed investment," Eisenson said. "You
can invest a dollar, or you can invest $100, or $1,000. It's
completely up to you."</TE>
<TE>   The return on this investment can be as high as the interest rate
on the loan: If the rate on the mortgage is 7%, that's a 7% return on
the principal you pay off.</TE>
<TE>   For those who itemize deductions on their tax returns, the payoff
is less because mortgage interest is tax-deductible. Still, the
effective rate of return--ranging from about 4% to 6%, depending on
your marginal tax rate--remains higher than yields on most
high-quality fixed-income investments today.</TE>
<TE>   "Just $25 a month will save you roughly $20,000 in interest on the
typical 30-year mortgage," Eisenson said. "That's $20,000 that you
can then use to pay for college or take a nice vacation."</TE>
<TE>   A big advantage to a self-directed pay-down plan is that you
aren't locked in. If the investment landscape improves, you can shift
the extra dollars into higher-return alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, if you were to refinance your mortgage with a
shorter-term loan--say, over 15 years--you might get a lower interest
rate, but you'd be committed to a higher monthly payment regardless
of what happens in the investment environment or in your personal
financial life.</TE>
<TE>   Making additional payments is as easy as adding $50 or $100 to
your mortgage payment each month--or even just rounding the payment
up. A person who has a $100,000 mortgage at 7%, for example, would
pay $665 a month over 30 years. If that person could start paying
$700 a month, the loan would be paid off about five years sooner and
save some $23,000 in interest.</TE>
<TE>   There is one potential downside to boosting your equity stake in
your home: It can be difficult to convert that equity into cash when
you need it, said Judith Martindale, a financial planner in San Luis
Obispo. That's why a lot of older people are cash poor and house
rich.</TE>
<TE>   The solution: Secure a home equity line of credit, which provides
pre-approved borrowing power that can be tapped when you need it.</TE>
<TE>   Improve the Property</TE>
<TE>   Every home costs money to maintain. Beyond regular upkeep, many
homeowners eventually entertain the idea of expensive remodeling or
other improvements, with the goal of boosting the resale value of the
property.</TE>
<TE>   Many real estate agents advise clients planning to sell their
homes soon to invest a few bucks on landscaping, painting or a
thorough cleaning to get a higher price and faster sale.</TE>
<TE>   "Realtors call it 'staging' a house for sale," said Carl Adams,
director of the seniors division at Dickson Realtors in La Canada
Flintridge. "It can make a difference of many thousands of dollars in
the sales price."</TE>
<TE>   But agents also said it's sometimes hard to determine whether an
inexpensive spruce-up made all the difference--or whether the house
just hit the market at the right time.</TE>
<TE>   More expensive remodeling or improvements--room additions, for
example--can vary substantially in terms of how much resale value
they will add to a home. There always will be some emotional payback
from improving the house you live in, but experts caution homeowners
to be careful about overestimating the kind of financial return they
may earn on expensive projects.</TE>
<TE>   For example, some "sweat-equity" projects do nothing to boost a
home's value and may even harm sale prices.</TE>
<TE>   "You see people taking beautiful old Spanish houses and trying to
turn them into 20th century modern homes," Adams said. "It's just a
disaster."</TE>
<TE>   Projects that go largely unseen, such as replacing pipes with
copper plumbing, rarely add more to the sale price than they cost, he
said. That's because buyers generally take good pipes and wiring for
granted.</TE>
<TE>   Even adding a pool, which can greatly improve livability, seldom
increases a home's sale price enough to make up for the often
substantial cost, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   If your goal is to boost the resale value of your home rather than
simply make it more livable, Adams suggested consulting a real estate
agent before undertaking a major project. These consultations
generally are free--done to build goodwill among potential
clients--and they can save homeowners from making costly mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   Remodeling magazine does an annual survey of which remodeling
projects return the most money. The survey prices 10 popular projects
and then asks real estate agents in 60 U.S. cities to estimate what
the projects would return in higher resale values.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, for example, a minor kitchen remodel more than
paid for itself, providing a return of about 15% on its $17,331 cost
in one year, according to the magazine's latest survey. But putting
in a new sun room cost more than it boosted the sale price, the
magazine found.</TE>
<TE>   By and large, expensive projects don't pay, beyond what they
provide the homeowner in greater livability. In fact, adding a family
room--a project that would cost about $57,000 in Los Angeles--is
likely to boost the sale price by less than $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   Carry Back a Mortgage</TE>
<TE>   Adams, who works primarily with senior citizens who want to "trade
down" to smaller, less expensive homes, has been encouraging some
homeowners selling their houses to consider financing the sale
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The real estate term for this process is called "carrying back
paper": In essence, you become the banker, providing financing to the
person who buys your house.</TE>
<TE>   Why? In the foothill neighborhoods where Adams works, many older
folks are living in homes worth $750,000 or more, he said. The houses
are long paid off and too big for elderly empty-nesters.</TE>
<TE>   But a seller who gets $750,000 in cash is likely to owe capital
gains taxes on at least a portion of the take. Then there's the
problem of finding somewhere to invest the money to get a decent
return.</TE>
<TE>   By agreeing instead to hold a mortgage from the buyer, the seller
can get an annual interest return of 6.5% to 7%, secured by the house
they may have lived in for decades. That could be a viable option in
a market in which most other high-quality fixed-income investments
are returning less than 5%, Adams said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, by carrying the loan, you essentially are doing an
installment sale. You still own the home; you simply are selling it
to the new occupants over time.</TE>
<TE>   That means you postpone the bulk of the tax bill from the sale.
The seller owes taxes on only the portion of the gain received in any
given year, Adams said. That's likely to be a small amount when the
sale is stretched over 10 or 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, buyers often like the arrangement because
sellers rarely charge "points" or fees, which can make the process
more cost-effective for both sides.</TE>
<TE>   The big caveat: the risk of foreclosure. If the buyer stops paying
on the loan, you'll have to foreclose, which is an arduous legal
process.</TE>
<TE>   To reduce the risk of foreclosure, sellers should do three things:
get a substantial down payment (at least 20% of the sale price); have
the buyer fill out a loan application; and get a copy of his or her
credit report.</TE>
<TE>   A big down payment helps ensure that the seller gets a sizable
chunk of cash up front. It also puts the buyer at risk of losing a
significant sum if payments are missed and the seller forecloses.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the loan application should list the buyer's income and
assets, which tells the seller whether the buyer has the ability to
pay. The credit report tells you whether the buyer has a history of
stiffing creditors.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of wealthy people who don't have the desire to
pay their bills," Adams said. "You can't just say that they've got a
lot of money, so they're good for it."</TE>
<TE>   The seller also needs to prepare home loan documents--just like a
bank--that spell out the terms of the deal. Many sellers would
benefit by having a real estate attorney involved in the process to
review the transaction.</TE>
<TE>   It's a lot of work, Adams acknowledged. "But I don't know where
else you can go in today's market and get a secured return of 6.5% to
7%."</TE>

<HD>Real Estate Beckons as Wall St. Stumbles</HD>
<DH>More investors view rental property as an antidote to
financial markets' woes. But don't underestimate the risks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Rosenblatt has two words of advice for investors spooked by
the debacle on Wall Street: real estate.</LD>
<LD>   The San Jose retiree began buying rental properties in the 1970s.
The steady stream of income--as well as the price appreciation--has
provided a welcome dose of profitability at a time when his other
investments are swimming in red ink.</LD>
<LD>   "I have about 55% of my assets in rental real estate," Rosenblatt
said. "As each day goes by and I look at the losses in my [stock]
portfolio, I am so glad."</LD>
<TE>   Many investors may be ready to follow Rosenblatt's example. The
stock market has been falling for nearly 2 1/2 years. Buyers of
Treasury bonds have watched the yields on those securities dwindle.
Cash accounts pay almost nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Residential real estate in California and other regions,
meanwhile, has been racking up double-digit annual gains.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate analysts are debating whether the housing market has
assumed bubble-like proportions, ready to pop just when everyone
decides prices will keep rising indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, for many Americans real estate remains the truest shelter
from financial markets' storm.</TE>
<TE>   "Objectively, real estate is a very favorable investment compared
to equities right now," said David Lereah, chief economist at the
National Assn. of Realtors in Washington. "Home price appreciation is
very strong, and it's going to remain strong because there's a lean
supply of homes. You also have historically low interest rates. You
can use those low rates to leverage your investment and provide an
even better return."</TE>
<TE>   Besides owning your own home, there are several ways to invest in
real estate: buying shares of real estate investment trusts or mutual
funds that own REITs; investing in commercial projects, such as strip
malls or small office buildings; and buying individual houses for
quick resale.</TE>
<TE>   But for a long-term investor with a regular income who can come up
with a modest down payment, owning rental property may be the most
attractive option, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   There are plenty of risks, of course. Tenants don't always pay the
rent, and some may trash the property. Housing prices could fall,
causing invested capital to languish. What's more, all real estate
involves a time commitment from the investor, and apartment complexes
in particular can require endless maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   And there's always the risk of the "negative"--industry-speak for
when the rent doesn't cover the cost of the mortgage, insurance and
property taxes.</TE>
<TE>   These are all important considerations, but they may be easier to
stomach at a time when stocks are threatening to suffer their third
losing year in a row.</TE>
<TE>   And for those jaded by the corporate chicanery that has turned
some billion-dollar companies into dust, there may be some comfort in
owning a tangible investment that you can drive by each day.</TE>
<TE>   One way to get started in rental real estate with a minimum of
capital is to buy a duplex and live in one unit while renting out the
other. This approach is particularly viable for young couples buying
their first home, said Fred Pizzuto, a real estate agent who owns a
duplex in Big Bear. The rent helps pay the mortgage, and you get the
tax breaks that come with owning a home as well as owning a rental
property.</TE>
<TE>   "Fix it up and within three or four years, you'll have that moving
along well enough that you can buy something else and move out,"
Pizzuto said.</TE>
<TE>   Sounds simple enough. But it's often not easy to find the right
property at the right price. Evaluating any real estate
investment--whether or not you intend to live there--is complex, and
there is little professional direction for the newcomer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like Wall Street where there are a lot of analysts
sitting in offices, coming out with reports on what you should buy,"
said Glenn Sonnenberg, president of Legg Mason Real Estate Investors
in West Los Angeles. "There is no national market for real estate.
It's a bunch of local markets and sub-markets."</TE>
<TE>   How do you decide what to buy?</TE>
<TE>   For investors buying properties on their own rather than through a
syndicator like Sonnenberg's company, he suggests staying close to
home, where they're better able to evaluate prices, crime, schools
and the rental market.</TE>
<TE>   "The danger is to go too far afield," he said. "If I were to buy,
I'd want to buy in my neighborhood, where I know what the good
streets are and where the shopping is. Buy what you know."</TE>
<TE>   Price is always a critical issue with investments, but it may be
particularly so with investment real estate.</TE>
<TE>   Rental real estate generates returns in two ways: appreciation of
the property and income from tenants. A buyer has to determine
whether he or she will earn a decent return on invested capital--the
down payment--over the long run, and whether the rent will cover the
cost of the mortgage, property taxes and insurance, among other
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   If the rent doesn't cover those costs, the buyer has to put
additional money into the investment each month. Calculating returns
without taking those additional capital infusions into account is
like counting total dollars in a 401(k) savings plan while ignoring
the fact that additional money has been pumped into the account
throughout the year.</TE>
<TE>   It's an important point when comparing potential returns on real
estate with what you might get from other investments.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, with the stock market's prospects dicey, and many
fixed-income securities paying minuscule returns, the comparisons
often favor real estate, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Over long periods, residential real estate has appreciated at
about a 4% annual rate, according to the National Assn. of Realtors.
That compares with about a 5% annual return for government bonds and
about 11% for stocks.</TE>
<TE>   But because of leverage and tax breaks, real estate still may have
an edge even if the nominal annual return stays close to historical
averages.</TE>
<TE>   Consider a hypothetical investor who buys a $100,000 home, putting
20% down and financing the $80,000 balance at 7%. His monthly
mortgage payment is $532.25. With property taxes, insurance and
maintenance costs of $125 a month, he'll have positive cash flow if
he can charge more than $657 per month in rent.</TE>
<TE>   If the property appreciates 4% a year it will be worth $148,000
after 10 years. The mortgage, meanwhile, has been paid down to
$68,650.</TE>
<TE>   If the owner sells, he'll pay a 6% Realtor's commission, reducing
his net sales price to $139,120. Still, he walks away with
$70,470--an annual return of 13.4% on his original $20,000
investment.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, along the way he may have gotten tax breaks that
reduced his net cost of owning the property.</TE>
<TE>   The catch: It's difficult to find deals in which rents will fully
cover the monthly costs of holding the property, real estate experts
say. Moreover, it's not unusual to have months when a rental unit is
vacant, generating no income.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the cost of borrowing to buy a rental property may be higher
than on owner-occupied homes, lowering the long-term return.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest risk is that tenants will fail to pay their rent,
forcing a landlord to hire attorneys to evict them.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to maintain a cash cushion" of at least two or three
months' rent to cover vacancies and nonpaying tenants, said Judith
Martindale, a financial planner who owns two rental units in San Luis
Obispo.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, don't underestimate what might go wrong when you have
tenants.</TE>
<TE>   Consider Donna Englander's first rental experience. She and her
husband rented out their Redondo Beach home at a below-market rate to
a friend while they were out of town for six months. The friend
failed to repair an old wall heater that suddenly started spewing
soot throughout the home.</TE>
<TE>   When Englander returned, she and her husband had to replace the
furnace and repaint the entire house, at a cost of several thousand
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   One lesson, experts say, is that you should never skimp on
property insurance when you're a landlord.</TE>
<TE>   Many real estate investors choose to simplify the process by
hiring a management firm to find renters, check potential tenants'
credit and references and make necessary repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Although management companies can be expensive for vacation rental
homes--charging as much as one-third of the rent--the fees usually
range from 5% to 10% of the rent collected for longer-term rental
properties.</TE>
<TE>   Englander, who is now renting their house at market rates to
strangers, considers the management fee well worth the cost.</TE>
<TE>   "I bought a book called 'Every Landlord's Legal Guide' and handed
it to my husband to read so we could do this right," Englander said.
"He got to about Page 10 ... and he threw it back at me and said
we're hiring a property management firm."</TE>

<HD>A Primer on Real Estate Tax Breaks</HD>
<DH>The size and timing of deductions for property expenses can
depend on an investor's earnings and occupation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the benefits of investing in real estate is tax savings.
Property can be a great way to shelter income from the taxman.</LD>
<LD>   However, the value of the tax breaks can vary depending on how
much you earn and what you do for a living.</LD>
<LD>   The best breaks go to middle-income folks who manage their own
properties. But even so-called passive investors and high-income
taxpayers can reap some rewards, said Philip J. Holthouse, a partner
in the West Los Angeles accounting firm of Holthouse Carlin &amp; Van
Trigt.</LD>
<TE>   For instance, the cost of maintaining and marketing a rental
property can be deducted from the income the property generates,
without regard to the owner's tax status. These expenses include
mortgage interest payments, insurance, utilities, maintenance,
repairs, advertising costs and management fees, as well as the
non-cash cost of depreciation.</TE>
<TE>   Depreciation is supposed to reflect the diminishing value of a
tangible asset over time. If you buy furniture for a rental house,
for example, it's likely to wear out over the course of several
years. The value of that furniture is depreciated--written off as a
deductible expense on your tax return--over a five-year period.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of rental real estate, the value of the home or
apartment complex is assumed to go from the price you paid to zero
over the course of 27 1/2 years. (There are no depreciation expenses
for the land under the building, because land isn't expected to wear
out.)</TE>
<TE>   In reality, of course, homes and apartment complexes don't
necessarily fall in value. In fact, they often become more valuable.
So depreciation expenses frequently reflect phantom costs that can be
used to shelter otherwise taxable income.</TE>
<TE>   Here's an example: An investor buys a four-unit apartment building
for $500,000, putting $100,000 down and financing the rest. His
$400,000 mortgage at 7% interest costs about $2,662 per month.
Management fees, repairs, insurance and marketing expenses cost an
additional $500 per month. The monthly rental income is $1,000 per
unit, or $4,000 total.</TE>
<TE>   That works out to positive cash flow--income after expenses--of
$838 per month, or $10,056 per year. That would normally be taxable
income, costing about $3,000 in federal taxes, assuming a 30%
marginal tax rate.</TE>
<TE>   But the investor also is able to depreciate the building. He
divides the cost of the structure--let's assume $425,000 after
subtracting the cost of the land from the $500,000 purchase
price--over 27 1/2 years. That provides a $15,454 annual depreciation
expense, which qualifies as a deduction on his tax return and
completely eliminates the tax obligation on the $10,056 in rental
income.</TE>
<TE>   What happens to the $5,398 in excess depreciation expenses? Here's
where the taxpayer's income and occupation come into play.</TE>
<TE>   Most people are restricted from claiming "passive" losses--rental
real estate generally is considered a passive investment activity
unless you're an industry professional--that exceed their
passive-investing income in any given year.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, while these losses could offset income from other rental
properties, they normally can't be used to offset a taxpayer's wages
or income from interest or other investments.</TE>
<TE>   There are two exceptions:</TE>
<TE>   * If the taxpayer is a real estate professional who spends more
than 750 hours a year buying, selling or renting properties, he can
write off an unlimited amount of passive losses.</TE>
<TE>   * If he is not a real estate professional but is actively involved
in renting the apartments--determining the rent and approving the
tenants, for example--and his modified adjusted gross income is less
than $100,000 annually, he can use as much as $25,000 in passive
losses to offset ordinary, non-rental income each year.</TE>
<TE>   If our sample investor qualifies for either of those exceptions,
he could use the entire $15,454 in depreciation on his rental
property to shelter income--whatever its source--thereby saving
$4,636 in federal income taxes.</TE>
<TE>   What if he's not a real estate professional, isn't actively
involved in the investment or makes more than $100,000 a year? His
ability to claim losses in excess of his "passive" income--that's all
the income this apartment generates, plus any income he may receive
from other rentals--is restricted.</TE>
<TE>   If he earns less than $150,000 in modified adjusted gross income,
he will be able to claim a partial deduction for the losses in excess
of his passive income. However, if he earns more, he can save these
passive losses to use in another tax year when he has more passive
income.</TE>
<TE>   "You still get the deductions," Holthouse said. "But you might not
get them right away."</TE>
<TE>   These deductions can prove highly valuable down the road. The
reason: Many people who buy rental real estate keep it for
decades--long after the mortgages are paid off and the out-of-pocket
cost of owning the property is slim. In the meantime, rents
presumably rise along with inflation.</TE>
<TE>   So in those later years, the owner is likely to have lots of
income and fewer tangible expenses. That's when deducting those past
depreciation expenses pays off, Holthouse said.</TE>

<HD>Hard to Find Winners in 2nd Quarter</HD>
<DH>The average domestic stock fund slumps 12.2% as investors
flee the market. But there are a few bright spots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The second quarter demonstrated again how much misery loves company
on Wall Street.</LD>
<LD>   For stock mutual funds, the quarter ended June 28 will be
remembered as one of the worst ever, as investors fled the market
amid worries over the economy, terrorism and corporate financial
scandals.</LD>
<LD>   Less than 7% of equity funds gained ground in the period,
according to data from fund tracker Lipper Inc. The average domestic
stock fund slumped 12.2%, according to Morningstar Inc., and 25 of 28
equity fund categories were in the red.</LD>
<TE>   The average stock fund decline wasn't as large as the 17.6% loss
in the third quarter of last year. But some of the most popular fund
categories, already deep in the hole after two years of losses, dug
deeper still.</TE>
<TE>   The average large-capitalization growth stock fund, for example,
lost 16.1% in the second quarter and 18.2% in the first half,
Morningstar data show. That followed a 14.1% drop in 2000 and a 23.6%
plunge in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Investors who figured the technology sector couldn't get much
worse had a rude awakening: The average technology sector fund
plummeted 28.6% in the quarter and 34% in the first half, after
losing 38.3% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   There were some winners in the quarter. Precious metals funds
(which usually own shares of gold mining companies), real estate
funds and Japanese stock funds finished the period in the black. But
few investors own those fund sectors. Combined, the categories hold
less than 1% of all stock fund assets, according to Lipper.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the declines in many fund categories were held to single
digits in the quarter--a relative victory for the concept of
portfolio diversification.</TE>
<TE>   In general, funds focused on foreign stocks, "value" shares and
smaller stocks recorded smaller losses than the average U.S. fund.</TE>
<TE>   Relative Performance</TE>
<TE>   Investors evaluating their individual funds should focus on
relative performance rather than absolute performance, financial
advisors say. Compare your fund to its category average, and look at
the latest returns in the context of longer-term results.</TE>
<TE>   For example, among large-cap growth funds, the Jensen Fund lost
12.4% in the second quarter and 9.5% in the first half, numbers that
compare favorably with its category average. Over the last three
years Jensen has gained an average of 5.2% annually, versus a 12.6%
annualized loss for the category.</TE>
<TE>   Janus Growth &amp; Income lost 10.5% in the quarter, 10.7% in the half
and 4.4% annualized over the last three years. But that fund, too, is
holding up better than the average large-cap growth fund.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, the Franklin Gold &amp; Precious Metals and Vanguard
Precious Metals funds, both of which surged about 31% in the first
half, look strong compared with the average stock fund. But they
ranked near the bottom within their sizzling category: The average
gold-oriented fund climbed 50.9% in the half.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a look at some of the equity fund highlights in the second
quarter and first half:</TE>
<TE>   * Value-oriented funds outperformed growth funds in the quarter,
as they have in seven of the last 10 quarters, Lipper said. In a
dicey market, many investors continue to favor the lower
price-to-earnings ratios and higher dividend yields that are the
hallmarks of the value sector.</TE>
<TE>   On average, value funds lost about half as much as their growth
counterparts. The mid-cap value category slid 7.7%, for example,
versus a decline of 14.2% for mid-cap growth.</TE>
<TE>   Financial-services funds, a classic value sector, fell 4.5% in the
quarter, on average, and were up 0.1% in the half.</TE>
<TE>   * Small-cap stocks and stock funds held up better than their
blue-chip counterparts, also continuing the trend of the last two
years, as investors disappointed in blue chips search for new ideas.</TE>
<TE>   The average small-cap blend fund (meaning a mix of small growth
and small value stocks) lost 7% in the quarter, compared with a 12.5%
drop for the average large-cap blend fund.</TE>
<TE>   The average small-cap value fund eased 3.9% in the quarter but
still was up 4.5% in the half.</TE>
<TE>   * Precious metals funds rallied again, posting an 11.2% average
gain in the quarter, the best of any stock fund category.</TE>
<TE>   Rising gold prices continued to propel gold mining stocks. The
precious metals fund category also finished 2001 and this year's
first quarter as the top-performing equity fund category.</TE>
<TE>   Although there has been no sign of higher inflation, which usually
boosts gold prices, there has been no shortage of dour news to
undermine investors' faith in stocks and the dollar and increase
their desire for something tangible, said Morningstar analyst
Christopher Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he cautioned that gold could lose its luster: "With no
inflation and an economy on the mend, the long-term prospects of gold
probably aren't that good," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, gold futures prices reached a peak of $327.80 an ounce on
June 4, up from $279 at year-end, but have pulled back to $311 as of
last week.</TE>
<TE>   * Real estate sector funds continued riding the rally in real
estate investment trusts, or REITs, which make up the bulk of the
funds' holdings.</TE>
<TE>   The average real estate fund added 4.9% in the quarter and was up
13.3% in the half, after rising 9.3% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Investors have clamored for real estate funds for two reasons:
First, with the stock market swooning, property is viewed as a
potential haven. Second, real estate funds provide a regular income
stream.</TE>
<TE>   Dividends Alluring</TE>
<TE>   REITs are required by law to distribute nearly all of their income
to shareholders, so they typically pay investors a high, and steady,
cash dividend.</TE>
<TE>   So far, investors are maintaining an optimistic view of the real
estate market's health overall. But if the economy weakens, and
property vacancy rates rise, REITs could suffer.</TE>
<TE>   Top performers among real estate funds in the second quarter
included Alpine U.S. Real Estate Equity, up 11.5%, and Prudential
Real Estate Securities, up 8.2%.</TE>
<TE>   * Japanese stock funds gained 3.7%, on average, in the quarter.
Japan's market fell in the period, along with most world markets, but
the dollar's slide against the yen boosted the value of Japanese
shares held by U.S. investors.</TE>
<TE>   The weak dollar also helped cushion declines in European stock
funds.</TE>
<TE>   * So-called short funds, which bet on lower stock prices and thus
are used by some investors as a hedge against bear markets, were the
biggest winners in the quarter as markets dived.</TE>
<TE>   Top gainers included ProFunds UltraShort OTC, a leveraged fund
that seeks to provide double the inverse return of the tech-heavy
Nasdaq 100 index on a daily basis, with a gain of 66% in the quarter;
Prudent Bear, an actively managed fund run by high-profile short
seller David Tice, which rose 35.2%; and Rydex Arktos, which seeks to
provide the inverse return of the Nasdaq 100 (without leverage), up
32.8%.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts note that short funds can be extremely volatile. And
if the market rebounds, these will be among the biggest losers.</TE>
<TE>   * On the downside, technology and communications funds again
ranked at the bottom among stock fund categories, down 28.6% and 27%,
respectively, in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last three years, the tech and telecommunications sectors
have sustained annualized losses of 20.9% and 24.8%, respectively,
after leading the great bull market of the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's fourth-quarter tech rally spurred hopes for a comeback
for the battered sectors, Morningstar notes.</TE>
<TE>   But many companies continue to delay spending on technology.
Meanwhile, many telecom companies are struggling with debt-laden
balance sheets and product overcapacity.</TE>
<TE>   Among the worst-performing tech funds in the quarter: Black Oak
Emerging Technology, which lost 46.9%; Van Wagoner Technology, which
sank 42.4%; and Berkshire Focus, which dropped 38.7%.</TE>

<HD>A Bear Market Can Be Good for the Young</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After more than two years of stock market losses, and now mounting
allegations of corporate fraud, young investors probably think
putting money into equities is about as Quixotic as throwing it in a
wishing well--a cute, hopeful gesture, but not something to build a
retirement plan on.</LD>
<LD>   If history is any guide, however, sustained downdrafts in the
stock market can be tremendous opportunities for those who invest
wisely and for the long haul--meaning, decades.</LD>
<LD>   The caveat is that investing wisely doesn't mean buying hot stocks
or shares in just a few companies that you're sure are going to beat
the market.</LD>
<TE>   Wise investing, by and large, is unexciting investing. It involves
regularly putting money into a diversified portfolio of stocks
representing a broad spectrum of U.S. companies. And it means holding
those shares--and even buying more--during dismal periods when your
returns are likely to be negative.</TE>
<TE>   "You should really hope for a bear market when you are young. It
gives you a chance to buy stocks at lower prices," said Steve
Norwitz, a spokesman for mutual fund giant T. Rowe Price in
Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, people who are close to retirement have a different
view of bear markets. Stocks can--and very well may--languish for
years. When you're near retirement, you may not have the time to wait
out extended slumps before tapping your nest egg.</TE>
<TE>   "For the person who is retired or almost retired, this market is a
disaster," Norwitz said. "But for the person who is 20 or 30 years
away from retirement, a bear market is a great way to accumulate
assets."</TE>
<TE>   You might expect to hear that from someone representing a mutual
fund company. But that approach also is championed by the likes of
billionaire Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors of
all time.</TE>
<TE>   Long-term optimism about stocks is rooted in one basic belief:
Over time the economy will grow, and so too will many companies.</TE>
<TE>   Big-company stocks--as measured by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index--have returned an average of 10.7% a year since 1926, even
though 10.7% has never been the actual return for any single year.</TE>
<TE>   Over one-year periods, stock returns are all over the map.
Big-company stocks lose money in about one in every four years. In
other years they make up for lost time, earning substantially more
than the historical average.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are some noteworthy patterns. Among them: Periods of
above-average returns frequently give way to periods of below-average
returns and vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1990s, Wall Street generated far-above-average
returns. Now there's talk about a long period of poor returns. Young
investors may hope that talk rings true.</TE>
<TE>   Let's take a look at how a new investor would have fared had he
gotten started in the early 1970s--just before the worst bear market
since the Great Depression.</TE>
<TE>   Let's assume that this hypothetical young investor started socking
$10,000 a year into big-company stocks at the end of 1972 and
continued to do so at the end of each year through 1992.</TE>
<TE>   In five of those years, this investor's portfolio suffered losses.
But the worst losses were at the beginning of his investing tenure,
when the S&amp;P 500 dropped 14.7% in 1973, then 26.5% in 1974 (all of
these figures are "total" returns, meaning price change plus dividend
income).</TE>
<TE>   By plodding along, investing $10,000 annually--a total of $200,000
over the 20 years--this investor saw his portfolio grow to $1.1
million.</TE>
<TE>   The market's average annual return in that 1972-92 period was
11.3%, according to data tracker Ibbotson Associates. If the
portfolio had consistently grown at that rate, it would have been
worth $750,645 at the end of 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Then how could our investor have had $1.1 million? If you're just
getting started when the market is taking its worst hits, you have
less principal at risk, so you are taking your losses at a
comparatively good time.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the market's historical performance, you can expect that
the longer your portfolio languishes, the better it will fare in the
future, when you presumably have more invested. Again, this is
assuming you own a well-diversified portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, you'd make much more by jumping into the market before
the good years begin and jumping out before the bad years begin. But
no one has been able to consistently predict market turns.</TE>
<TE>   The moral of this story: If you're in your 20s or 30s--or even
your early 40s--and you haven't invested much for retirement, now may
be a good time to start.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the market could get worse before it gets better. Stock
prices still are historically high relative to per-share
earnings--another classic indicator of market value, or the lack
thereof.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason alone you shouldn't be putting the rent money into
stocks.</TE>
<TE>   But for very-long-term money, a bad stretch in the market has
usually spelled opportunity.</TE>

<HD>$1.4-Billion Loss Likely at Airlines</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Business travelers continue to cut flying costs,
depressing carriers' earnings in the second quarter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>American Express Co. created an Internet site to help corporate
clients such as Aetna Inc. book cheaper airline tickets--and the
largest U.S. travel agent had a "giant spike" this year in its online
reservations.</LD>
<LD>   Business travelers found new ways to cut flying costs as the
economy waned, and U.S. carriers are paying the price. AMR Corp.'s
American Airlines, UAL Corp.'s United Airlines and other U.S.
carriers are expected to lose $1.4 billion in the second quarter,
ended June 30, Salomon Smith Barney estimated.</LD>
<LD>   "When businesses have difficult years, one of the first things
they cut is their travel budgets," said Douglas Parker, chief
executive of America West Holdings Corp. "When things start getting
better, they don't immediately restore them."</LD>
<TE>   Carriers slashed fares after the Sept. 11 attacks to win back
passengers and cut costs by laying off workers, trimming capacity and
deferring plane deliveries. Passenger traffic remains 10% to 12%
below year-earlier levels, with revenue about 20% lower, said David
Swierenga, chief economist for the Air Transport Assn. trade group.</TE>
<TE>   Only discounter Southwest Airlines Co. is expected to post a
second-quarter profit among the nine largest U.S. carriers based on
miles flown by paying passengers. Dallas-based Southwest, which is
the largest carrier by market value and is popular with leisure
travelers, is expected to earn about 11 cents a share, based on the
average forecast in a Thomson First Call poll of analysts.</TE>
<TE>   The unprofitable second quarter follows losses of $2.4 billion in
the first quarter and a record $7.3 billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   Business passengers generally pay higher fares for tickets bought
just before travel and with few restrictions, and some large carriers
depend on such fares for much of their revenue.</TE>
<TE>   With fares at lower levels, even the busy summer travel season
isn't expected to boost revenue much for airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Now, more businesses are using the Internet, discount airlines and
earlier ticket purchases to hold down costs.</TE>
<TE>   Use of American Express' corporate-client Internet site doubled
from January to May to 10% of the agency's transactions, almost
reaching the year-end target. "We've seen a giant spike in
interactive travel reservations by our customers," spokeswoman
Melissa Abernathy said.</TE>
<TE>   Most U.S. carriers will report their second-quarter results next
week. The deepest losses are expected at United Airlines, the world's
second-largest carrier, at $7.13 a share, and at US Airways Group
Inc. at $3.20 a share, based on the average First Call forecasts.</TE>

<HD>500 Fired at Aquila After Exec Bonuses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>A month before Aquila Inc. announced plans to fire 500 employees to
save nearly $35 million a year, five top executives were paid a total
of $30 million in bonuses.</LD>
<LD>   Leo Morton, a senior vice president and chief administrative
officer, said the incentive pay was crucial because it awarded
performance that was excellent at Aquila last year.</LD>
<LD>   "No one anticipated where we are today," Morton said.</LD>
<TE>   When the board's compensation committee decided in February to
award bonuses beyond the established salary and incentive packages,
it cited rapid growth the previous year. But already, Aquila's stock
price had fallen from a high of $37.55 in May to $23.53 on Feb. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the committee of three board members:</TE>
<TE>   * Determined that the nearly $6 million in salary and bonuses
destined for Chairman Richard Green Jr. was insufficient because of
his work in cultivating the company's energy-trading operation. As a
result, the committee put an additional $4.5 million in
"discretionary" cash and stock into his paycheck in "recognition of
his contribution," pushing his total compensation to more than $10.3
million.</TE>
<TE>   * Decided Robert Green, president and chief executive, deserved an
extra $4.5 million in cash and stock. He wound up receiving more than
$9.4 million in salary and bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   * Gave three other executives a total of $12 million in bonuses on
top of their salaries, most tied to existing incentive packages.</TE>
<TE>   The bonuses were paid in March. A month later, Aquila, formerly
known as UtiliCorp United Inc., announced that it would fire 500
employees, a move that would save about $35 million a year. That soon
was followed by additional layoffs and the announcement of a cut in
dividends for shareholders and of asset sales to further conserve
cash.</TE>
<TE>   Aquila has announced a cutback this year in long-term incentive
pay, which was a part of the executive bonuses awarded last year.</TE>
<TE>   In its report filed in March with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the committee--whose members are paid about $100,000
annually to serve as directors--said higher compensation was
justified because aggressive financial goals had been achieved.</TE>

<HD>Chrysler to Offer 7-Year, 70,000-Mile Warranty</HD>
<DH>Autos: The company, which lost $1.9 billion last year,
tries to boost sales by improving its image for reliability.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>AUBURN HILLS, Mich.</DL>
<LD>DaimlerChrysler will offer a permanent seven-year, 70,000-mile
warranty as a standard feature on all Chrysler cars and trucks in an
effort to improve the company's image for reliability.</LD>
<LD>   The third-biggest auto maker in the U.S. had offered a
100,000-mile warranty on engines and transmissions on a temporary
basis since November, Chrysler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche said in
an interview. A longer warranty shows consumers that the company
expects its models to need relatively few repairs, he said.</LD>
<LD>   Chrysler said the new warranties also will be transferable at no
cost to subsequent owners, a bid to boost vehicle resale values.</LD>
<TE>   "Our quality image is not improving at the same speed, and thereby
the gap between fact and perception is widening," Zetsche said.
Television, radio and print advertisements promoting the new warranty
begin this week.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler is trying to make a profit after losing $1.9 billion last
year. The company's U.S. sales fell 3.3% in the first half of this
year, a decline Chrysler wants to end by offering a more extensive
warranty than the three-year, 36,000-mile guarantee provided by
larger rivals General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.</TE>
<TE>   Complaints about Chrysler cars and trucks dropped 26% from 1998 to
2002, outpacing a 24% improvement for the industry, said Brian
Walters, director of product research at J.D. Power &amp; Associates.
Chrysler improved to eighth of 20 auto makers this year from 16th in
1998, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Chrysler engines and transmissions still tend to have more
problems than the industry average," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Warranty costs slid 20% in 2002 models from 2001, Zetsche said,
without giving details. DaimlerChrysler will have to set aside an
unspecified additional amount to pay expenses for the new warranty,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler shares have climbed 13% this year. They closed
Friday at $46.82 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>More Surprises Likely as Firms Post Earnings</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Concerns are expected with quarterly results.
Investors are wary of Andersen clients, firms that have taken
charges, made acquisitions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Investors shaken by a slew of corporate accounting scandals are
bracing for additional fallout as companies begin to announce their
results from the second quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Half of the companies in the Dow Jones industrial average will
report quarterly numbers this week or next, and few expect the
$3.9-billion restatement of expenses from WorldCom Inc. to be the
last of its kind.</LD>
<LD>   "I suspect there's another shoe to drop. I just don't know what
that will be," said Coleman Stipanovich, interim executive director
of Florida's State Board of Administration, which has $50 billion in
U.S. stock holdings.</LD>
<TE>   WorldCom isn't the only contributor to jittery nerves.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest problem identified by the No. 2 long-distance
telecommunications company is the mislabeling of routine operating
expenses as capital investment. To a market still recovering from the
collapse of energy giant Enron Corp., though, the disclosures of
wrongdoing and mistakes elsewhere seem to be coming from all
directions.</TE>
<TE>   At other major firms in recent weeks, Xerox Corp. said it
inappropriately booked more revenue than earlier disclosed, Kmart
Corp. restated nine months of results and Tyco International Ltd.
drew scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission over its
accounting for acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   The sheer number of admissions leads some investors to believe
that more companies will choose the current earnings season to join
the procession to the confessional.</TE>
<TE>   "After watching what has gone on at WorldCom, Tyco and Adelphia
[Communications Corp.], the layer of people under top management are
going to want to come clean. They will come forward because they fear
if they discover something and don't bring it up, they could go to
jail," said Jeff Van Harte, who manages about $5 billion in equities
for Transamerica Investment Management in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Van Harte said he expects to see more accounting scandals
revealed, but "it is impossible to tell where it will happen."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts are speculating, though, drawing up lists of
suspects based on a variety of criteria.</TE>
<TE>   A number of investors are betting against companies audited by
Arthur Andersen, which was convicted in the Enron scandal and was
WorldCom's auditor. Some Andersen clients may have been getting away
with improper bookkeeping, they reason, while others that switched to
new auditors recently may seize the opportunity to clear up gray
areas.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's hundreds of past clients range from such technology
stalwarts as Oracle Corp. to media giant News Corp. to consumer-goods
companies including Colgate-Palmolive Co.</TE>
<TE>   Other stockholders are keeping a close eye on companies that have
taken frequent charges or have grown rapidly through acquisitions,
such as networking gear manufacturer Cisco Systems Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Both those practices make financial reports harder to digest and
can disguise poor operating results.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions might be highest in the technology sector, which led the
rush to embrace pro forma profits that exaggerated company
performances. Many big tech companies also may get a jump on the new
requirement, effective in the third quarter, that they disclose how
much they are excluding from their reported expenses by awarding
stock options to employees.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. companies shelled out $47 billion in options during 2001, a
Bear Stearns &amp; Co. study reported in May. Microsoft Corp., Cisco and
Nortel Networks Corp. were among the biggest offenders, each paying
out more than $2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Even without more accounting bombshells, investors could be in for
unpleasant news from big companies. Most companies will meet or
exceed analysts' expectations for the quarter just ended, but many
could drastically scale back projections for the rest of the year,
said Chuck Hill, director of research at Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Intel, Oracle, Cisco and Hewlett-Packard Co. have said they don't
see much pickup in the next six months, Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get a lot more of those statements, we'll see a lot more
slashing of estimates," since analysts are still on record predicting
an unlikely 110% increase in third-quarter technology firm profits
from a year earlier, Hill said.</TE>

<HD>Dealing With Customers Online--Not on the Line</HD>
<DH>Technology: When TMH Corp. unplugged the phones, it sent a
message to its clients: e-mail only.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TMH Corp. has a message for its customers: Don't call us.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the Los Angeles maker of high-end audio and video
equipment wants e-mail.</LD>
<LD>   After weighing the matter for six months, TMH Chief Executive
Friederich Koenig in June yanked TMH's phone lines after sending out
an e-mail notifying its 4,000 customers that "the telephone will no
longer be a good way to contact us for general business."</LD>
<TE>   Callers to the company's main number now hear a recording that
directs them to TMH's e-mail address.</TE>
<TE>   The message ends on a chirpy note: "It's the 21st century.
Telephones are OK. The Web is better!"</TE>
<TE>   As for faxes, Koenig shoots back rhetorically, "What's a fax?"</TE>
<TE>   Physical mail? Forget it. But if you must, e-mail the company for
"current instructions."</TE>
<TE>   The move so far has not alienated most customers of the tiny
five-person company, some of whom applaud the firm for pulling the
plug, Koenig said.</TE>
<TE>   For every 10 e-mails he received in favor of the new plan, Koenig
got one against.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people thought it made a lot of sense," he said. "But there
were about three people who wanted to beat us up for what they
thought was a terrible, nonhumanistic, arrogant stance. We became
sort of a lightning rod for them."</TE>
<TE>   Is TMH's move extremely impersonal, or is it a glimpse of the
future?</TE>
<TE>   With companies eager to cut costs and experiment with various
forms of automation, there are arguments for both.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a one-size-fits-all world," said Paul Saffo, a
director at the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   "For instance, I consider myself to be a loyal Amazon customer,
and I remember being startled at realizing that I have never talked
to a human being there. You simply cannot reach Amazon by phone.
Everything's on the Web. It's an enormous cost saving for Amazon, and
no one seems to view it as controversial."</TE>
<TE>   Others are not so sanguine.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what they're doing is a gimmick," said Clifford Stoll,
author of the book "High Tech Heretic."</TE>
<TE>   "What's wrong with this picture is that this plan was devised by
someone who's in love with technology and doesn't realize that
customer satisfaction revolves not around devices but around human
relations," Stoll said.</TE>
<TE>   Koenig isn't worried about losing existing customers, some of whom
pay millions of dollars for TMH's theater-quality sound and video
systems.</TE>
<TE>   "Our customers are all on the Web," he said. "They all have the
infrastructure to make the switch."</TE>
<TE>   As for new customers, "no one buys TMH products on impulse. To
consider us is a long, involved process. If you don't know who we
are, you'll go to a receptionist. In our case, the receptionist is
our Web site. Then you'll be directed to the right person via e-mail.
After that, you might communicate with us all sorts of ways. The idea
is that the door by which you get into the company is by our Web
site. That's all."</TE>
<TE>   For customers who insist on a phone call, TMH will set up a
temporary number that will last hours or weeks, depending on the
project.</TE>
<TE>   For this story, Koenig conducted the interview on a land line that
lasted a day.</TE>
<TE>   What about follow-up questions? E-mail, please.</TE>

<HD>Interest in Corporate Ethics Is Still Weak</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ed Petry is to corporate America what the Maytag repairman is to
washing machines. In this season of spectacular corporate breakdowns,
the executive director of the Ethics Officer Assn. wishes he were
busier.</LD>
<LD>   Petry helped found the organization 10 years ago in the wake of
the last round of corporate greed and misdeeds--the insider trading
and defense contracting scandals. His group remains the nation's only
nonprofit, membership organization through which in-house corporate
cops from all industries can help one another keep their companies
toeing an ethical line.</LD>
<LD>   The recent spate of corporate chicanery has given the association
a bit of a boost. About 100 companies have joined in the six months
since "Enron" became a crossword puzzle clue for scandal. The
newcomers bring the membership to 805--still a small fraction of the
more than 10,000 publicly traded U.S. companies and far fewer than
what Petry would describe as a success.</LD>
<TE>   "I wish more were calling," Petry said from his office in suburban
Boston. "My phone's not ringing off the hook."</TE>
<TE>   That is one sign of what corporate watchdogs and ethics experts
say is a reluctance within many executive suites to embrace the
changes they believe are necessary to promote business integrity and
restore the tarnished image of corporate America.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate directors and executives don't have to wait for new laws
and regulations to implement many of the proposed reforms, such as
rotating auditing firms, disclosing insider stock sales in advance
and changing executive pay schemes. But there is little evidence that
more than a few companies are making changes.</TE>
<TE>   "Corporate America has been trying to slough this off and not make
fundamental changes," said USC business professor Ian Mitroff.</TE>
<TE>   Although a few companies have said they plan to expand financial
disclosures or add watchdog directors to boards, corporate governance
experts said they don't expect many firms to make serious changes for
months, in part because many are poring over financial reports trying
to figure out if they've got a problem of their own.</TE>
<TE>   "Audit committees are looking deeper," said Jeffrey Christian,
founder of Christian &amp; Timbers, an international executive recruiting
firm.</TE>
<TE>   Chief executives "are under intense scrutiny, not only from the
[Securities and Exchange Commission] and from shareholders, but from
the boards and even employees," Christian said. "Employees are
becoming whistle-blowers. They are feeling it's more safe [now].
They've noticed things and put up with things that are not quite
kosher, and they are going around the CEO to the board and having
private, confidential meetings."</TE>
<TE>   Companies that have effective ethics programs, in which employees
freely ask questions of and report problems to ethics officers, are
less likely to uncover problems, said Petry of the Ethics Officer
Assn. "If Enron, Arthur Andersen and Adelphia were members [of the
organization], things might have been different."</TE>
<TE>   When the New York Stock Exchange was debating reforms to impose on
member companies, it solicited Petry's advice. The NYSE included five
of Petry's seven recommendations in rules proposed recently,
including a mandate that all member companies have a code of ethics
and vigorously enforce it by creating an internal reporting system
that employees can use without fear of retribution.</TE>
<TE>   Petry acknowledged that even the NYSE's recommendations, which
will be voted on by the NYSE board Aug. 1, may not be enough to force
companies that don't want to implement effective ethics programs. As
it stands, he said, a majority of Fortune 500 companies have sub-par
programs or none at all.</TE>
<TE>   "Some companies will see [the NYSE proposals] as a wake-up call,"
Petry said. "But there still will be many who take the easy way out.
But if a company is hellbent on doing the minimum ... if they still
don't get it, then this isn't going to convince them."</TE>
<TE>   Because of such attitudes, corporate watchdogs and governance
experts said the success of the NYSE rules and a raft of other new
and proposed reforms is anything but guaranteed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is either going to be a time for a revitalization of the
notion that ethics is not only good virtue, but it is essential for
good business, or we will go further down the road of moral
compromise where if it works, it's right," said Michael Josephson,
founder of the Marina del Rey-based Josephson Institute of Ethics.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, who is scheduled to make a speech on corporate
governance this week, is reportedly considering calling for mandatory
jail time for corporate executives who falsify records. Josephson
said that would be a step in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   "Businesspeople make cost-benefit calculations," he said.
"Whenever you can up the cost sufficiently, you really do reduce the
likelihood of bad behavior. You don't make them better people, but
you do make them behave better. We have to make an example and deter
them. If we don't raise the stakes, things will just get worse."</TE>
<TE>   The idea of a corporate code of ethics was born in 1986, when many
of the nation's biggest defense contractors had become better known
for kickback schemes and $980 toilets than for the development of
revolutionary military technology. Facing the prospect of government
regulation, 55 defense contractors agreed to develop an ethics code
and install in-house ethics officers.</TE>
<TE>   "The defense industry was given one last chance by the government
to have voluntary efforts to fight waste, fraud and abuse," Petry
said.</TE>
<TE>   At about the same time, the U.S. Sentencing Commission was
developing guidelines on what judges should consider when weighing
penalties for errant corporations. The guidelines, issued in 1991,
instructed judges to consider corporate ethics programs as a
mitigating factor in determining fines.</TE>
<TE>   "The thinking is, if the company did everything we can expect a
company to do, then it's the bad apple that's to blame, not the
company," Petry said.</TE>
<TE>   "The fine reduction is significant," he added. "If a company has
an ethics program and cooperates with authorities, the fine is
automatically reduced by 95%. If they don't, it's automatically
increased by 400%."</TE>
<TE>   With such an incentive, companies outside the defense industry
began hopping on the ethics-code bandwagon, and 12 corporate ethics
officers, including Petry, formed the association to identify and
promote effective models. But, he said, many companies adopted codes
they believed would meet the sentencing guidelines--and then forgot
about them.</TE>
<TE>   "Those types of programs are still very commonplace and completely
ineffective," Petry said. "They are worse than nothing at all because
they just fuel feelings that this is hypocritical. If you have a code
but it's never referred to and it's not part of performance
appraisals and no one is ever fired for breaking the code, then it's
quickly seen as not being serious."</TE>
<TE>   Some companies confused ethics programs with social-responsibility
efforts such as using recycled products or sharing a portion of sales
receipts with a charity, and have no actual internal integrity
program. Other companies have compliance programs with hotlines to a
lawyer's office that "no one will ever call," Petry said. "There's a
strong tendency against being a snitch."</TE>
<TE>   "Helplines" have been found to be more effective, he said. "It's a
subtle change in the name, but it's a big change in philosophy. This
is the number that you call when you aren't sure, when you have
questions. It's a resource. It's not answered by corporate lawyers.
It's answered by someone in the ethics office."</TE>
<TE>   To promote better corporate behavior, said Lawrence E. Mitchell, a
corporate law professor at George Washington University and the
author of "Corporate Irresponsibility," reforms must target
market-driven incentives for corporate executives to show profits at
all costs, quarter after quarter--the kind of pressure that has been
blamed for many of the examples of apparent corporate book-cooking.</TE>
<TE>   Tax law changes and a shift in investor expectations over the last
two decades have created a situation in which corporate officers
focus almost exclusively on short-term goals, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "As a consequence, what you see is corporations doing
irresponsible things, like laying off lots of employees, which is a
sure way for short-term returns and long-term trouble," Mitchell
said. "You see corporations cutting environmental corners, and you
see corporations engaging in accounting shenanigans. The whole
purpose, from Enron to WorldCom, is to make earnings look better than
they are to keep share prices going up to benefit the executives and
their stock options and to keep the market happy."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell proposes raising the capital gains tax rate for shares
sold within a short time from purchase--say within six
months--creating an incentive for investors to hold on to stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Another way to encourage executives to focus on longer-term goals
would be to tie bonuses to multiyear corporate performance, said
David Lewin, a business professor at UCLA's Anderson School.</TE>
<TE>   Lewin said he would require companies to report more information
for investors to review, such as top-to-bottom compensation schemes,
options awards and employee loans. As it stands, public companies are
required only to report the annual compensation of their top five
officers--a rule that has not changed since the Securities and
Exchange Act was enacted in 1935.</TE>
<TE>   "So investors have no way of knowing whether the CEO, [chief
financial officer] or [chief operating officer] is making 10 times or
1,000 times what a front-line manager is making," Lewin said. "That
would be important to know because if investors don't like how much
the executives are paid, they will take their money out. There are
ways, through relatively straightforward, modest improvements in
financial accounting, that we could turn our eye on compensation and
let the market decide."</TE>
<TE>   Corporate officers are at least starting to listen to ideas for
change that they've rebuffed before, said Ira R. Kay, an executive
compensation expert with consulting firm Watson Wyatt Worldwide. Kay
is telling clients that it's time to cut back on the number of stock
options awarded to executives.</TE>
<TE>   "The valid criticism of stock options is they do create excessive
and fraudulent behavior because [executives] benefit in such a
leveraged way from stock appreciation, with no downside," Kay said.
"This has been an issue for a decade, but, given the accounting
favorability of options [for companies], nobody wanted to listen."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Kay said he got a call recently from a CEO of a
company that pays executives "pure stock options, and they are very
seriously exploring cutting back on their stock option plan."</TE>

<DH>Music: Independent record companies embrace 'peer-to-peer'
networks as a boon to CD sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like millions of other music lovers, Martin Hall misses the
pioneering service from Napster Inc. that let consumers download
songs from one another's computers for free.</LD>
<LD>   But Hall isn't your typical music fan. He works for a record
label, Merge Records, whose songs were being copied without a dime in
compensation.</LD>
<LD>   Merge is among a group of independent labels and artists that view
"peer-to-peer" networks as an effective tool for boosting CD sales.
The major record companies and many well-known artists, on the other
hand, are fighting on multiple fronts to drive consumers away from
those systems.</LD>
<TE>   Whereas Merge and others have used peer-to-peer systems to promote
little-known artists and new releases, the major labels have sued
Napster, Audiogalaxy, Kazaa and three other file-sharing networks,
alleging copyright infringement on a grand scale. They also are
injecting bogus files onto the most popular networks to stop users
from downloading new songs, and they are contemplating lawsuits
against consumers who offer huge collections of songs to copy.</TE>
<TE>   The divergent views about file sharing reflect the wide gap in
sales and resources between the five major record companies and the
many small independents, which say they can't spend the sums needed
to get their songs played on commercial radio stations or their music
videos aired on cable. That's why it's tough for the music industry
to present a unified front--not just on file sharing but also on such
technology-driven issues as Internet radio royalties, digital music
formats and copy-protected CDs.</TE>
<TE>   The split could pose a problem for the major record companies in
their legal battles against the leading peer-to-peer networks. In
particular, the efforts by the independents could undermine the major
labels' argument that these networks have no significant legitimate
use.</TE>
<TE>   "Because we're shut out of [the major labels'] distribution
system, we have to get our records out, we have to get our records
heard, whatever way we can," said Hall, director of publicity and
promotions for Durham, N.C.-based Merge. "If it means giving it to
Napster, so be it.... We have to find some way to let people know
that the record is here."</TE>
<TE>   Said Cary Sherman, president of the Recording Industry Assn. of
America, the industry's largest trade group: "It's up to the artists
or label to choose whether to use peer-to-peer service for these
purposes. It shouldn't be up to the peer-to-peer service to decide
that they're going to take your material and make it available
whether you like it or not."</TE>
<TE>   The RIAA has nothing against peer-to-peer technology, Sherman
said, as long as copyright holders' rights are respected. That's the
approach taken by CenterSpan Corp., whose technology limits file
sharing to files the copyright holders have approved for copying.</TE>
<TE>   There's a third approach emerging too: companies that distribute
authorized promotional material to users of Kazaa and other hotbeds
of piracy. Two examples are Altnet Inc. and FileFreedom, which enable
labels and artists to offer samples of their works, identify and
expand their followings and even sell downloadable music files.</TE>
<TE>   Altnet, which is co-owned by the original developers of the Kazaa
software, tries to direct Kazaa users to copy-protected versions of
the songs they are seeking. FileFreedom monitors what its users
download from any Internet source, offering information about the
artist and, in some cases, promotional material paid for by similar
acts.</TE>
<TE>   MaddWest, a hip-hop duo from Indiana that has moved to Los
Angeles, is using just about every available peer-to-peer tool to
promote its new release. The self- titled CD came out July 2 on
2KSounds Corp. of Woodland Hills, an independent label distributed by
EMI, one of the five major record companies.</TE>
<TE>   Will people still buy the CD if they can get it for free?</TE>
<TE>   "To think that people who [download] have no sort of ethics, I
think that's a little bit of a jump," said AceHa, half of MaddWest.
"I think that people have some loyalty," he said, adding that e-mails
from fans show that they are, in fact, shelling out cash for the CD.</TE>
<TE>   On the whole, though, CD shipments fell 10% in the U.S. last year,
when Napster's popularity peaked and a new generation of file-sharing
services emerged to supplant it. And sales so far this year are down
even further, Sherman of the RIAA said, particularly in countries
with widespread high-speed Internet access.</TE>
<TE>   Those figures have convinced many top labels and artists that the
file-sharing sites are teaching consumers to switch from buying music
to stealing it. But other labels disagree, saying their fans will pay
for music they think is good.</TE>
<TE>   Merge promoted its releases on Napster, which shut its service in
response to a court order, and Audiogalaxy, which dropped file
sharing after the major labels filed suit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a gamble," Hall said. "Yeah, some people are probably going
to burn this [music onto a CD] and never buy it. But hopefully, more
people are going to hear it than would hear it otherwise, and then
they might buy it."</TE>
<TE>   Even major-label artists can get a promotional push through
peer-to-peer networks, said entertainment lawyer Ronda Dixon, whose
clients include pop-reggae artist Shaggy.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon said one key to the success of Shaggy's last CD, "Hotshot,"
was the breakout song "It Wasn't Me." Shaggy's label, Vivendi
Universal subsidiary MCA International, had released a different song
as a single, but a disc jockey in Hawaii downloaded "It Wasn't Me"
from Napster and turned it into a local hit, Dixon said. The record
company saw the response and released "It Wasn't Me" to stations
across the country, pushing "Hotshot" to the top of the Billboard
charts.</TE>
<TE>   MCA representatives declined to comment, but Dixon advocates
further discussion of the possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "We sold 12 million units," Dixon said, "despite [downloading on]
numerous peer-to-peer networks.... I think [labels and artists] need
to explore it better rather than dismissing it out of hand."</TE>

<HD>China's Population of Lawyers Skyrockets</HD>
<DH>Asia: The number of attorneys is reported at 110,000--up
from 200 two decades ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Here's a sign of where the modern China is headed: The country is
getting more lawyers--a lot more of them.</LD>
<LD>   The All-China Lawyers Assn., meeting in Shanghai, said the number
of attorneys in China stands at 110,000--up from a mere 200 two
decades ago, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The sharp rise shows the rapid expansion of the country's legal
services, the association's general secretary, Jia Wuguang, was
quoted as saying.</LD>
<TE>   He said China has nearly 10,000 law offices--including attorneys
specializing in securities, finance and real estate. And the number
is expected to grow as the economy internationalizes, Jia said.</TE>
<TE>   He called legal services "an important part of the sound
investment environment essential for overseas investors."</TE>
<TE>   As it opens its economy to the outside world, China has emphasized
that it considers the rule of law an important underpinning of a
sound economy and a healthy nation. However, rights groups often
criticize its legal policies, saying they are often steamrolled in
efforts to stifle political dissent.</TE>
<TE>   China has been steadily opening its legal services market to the
outside world since last year. Some 104 foreign law firms and 28 Hong
Kong law offices have set up branches on the Chinese mainland, Xinhua
said.</TE>

<LD>It's a daily ritual bordering on the obsessive, she says, but Los
Angeles homemaker Marina Lopez can't stay away from her local
carniceria.</LD>
<LD>   Every day, she carefully studies the long glass cases filled with
fresh meat at the small Westlake neighborhood store. On this
particular Wednesday afternoon, her eyes stop at the beef tongue, but
she quickly rules it too expensive. After consulting her butcher--her
carnicero--Lopez settles on ground chuck that will become her

<LD>   "Meat should be fresh so that it tastes good," Lopez says,
reflecting an attitude she acquired from going to the market every
day in her native El Salvador. Carnicerias help her keep the
tradition locally, she says.</LD>
<TE>   The Latin-style butcher shops are an essential market stop for
millions of local Latinos who know they can find the right carnes for
any dish. The shops also are pushing the U.S. food industry to
reconsider how fresh meat, particularly beef, is sold in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   Imitating these niche markets, large and medium-sized supermarket
operators across the region are luring carniceria shoppers by
stocking such specialized cuts as tripe, goat head and tongue and
adding professional butchers to create full-service meat counters
that buck the trend toward prepackaged, self-serve, warehouse-style
food shopping.</TE>
<TE>   "The Latino consumer is making a huge difference in the meat
industry," said Bruce Berven, executive director of the California
Beef Council.</TE>
<TE>   Californians spend $5 billion to $6 billion annually on beef, and
about a third of that is spent by Latinos, Berven said. Industry
market studies also indicate that Latino families eat beef more often
(four to five times a week) than the general population (two times a
week), and that a higher percentage of Latinos' household incomes is
spent on beef than in non-Latino households.</TE>
<TE>   "We like our meat. I can cut back on other things, but I always
have money to spend on food. And always with your food you have
meat," said Raul Morales, a taco stand owner near downtown L.A. who
makes regular trips to carnicerias for his family and for his
business.</TE>
<TE>   Believed to have first appeared in the 1930s, carnicerias sprang
from the need for fresh cuts of meat like those popular in Mexico.
With few such butcher shops in Southern California, immigrant Latino
families would travel to family-run stores each week for their
grocery shopping but also found them to be cultural havens.</TE>
<TE>   "They would cash their checks there, get to know the butcher, make
friends," said Steve Soto of the Mexican American Grocers Assn. Soon
immigrant families started opening more carnicerias, and the stores
became neighborhood staples with their helpful carniceros.</TE>
<TE>   Also known as mini-markets or convenience stores that specialize
in cortes latinos, or Latin cuts, the meat shops have flourished in
heavily Latino neighborhoods. The Los Angeles-based Mexican American
Grocers Assn. estimates there are about 4,800 independent carnicerias
in the state, and the majority of them are in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But the number of these local carnicerias is shrinking as
supermarkets open stores in the same areas.</TE>
<TE>   For the last 15 years, independent chains such as Superior
Warehouses, Jon's, Northgate's, Tresierra's and El Tapatio have
picked up on the demand for fresh meat and have hired skilled
butchers, which has helped push up sales in their meat and produce
departments.</TE>
<TE>   The full-service meat counters have become a mainstay at the
14-store Superior chain, where 65% of its customers are Latino. Meat
sales make up 16% to 19% of same-store sales, said Phil Lawrence, the
company's vice president of meat and seafood operations. Some of the
top sellers are milanesa (thin beef sirloin steaks), ranchera (beef
flap steak) and diesmillo (boneless beef chuck).</TE>
<TE>   Now, some of the major supermarket chains are working to catch up.
Kroger Co., Vons Cos. and Albertson's Inc. have begun adding special
meat cuts and hiring butchers in certain stores. Some supermarkets
have even added tortillerias, rolling out fresh tortillas, and
panaderias, making fresh sweet bread.</TE>
<TE>   "They're growing this trend because the independent retailers have
been successful," Soto said.</TE>
<TE>   During the last two years, full-fledged carnicerias have been
added to Kroger's Food 4 Less stores in Pomona, Bell Gardens,
Pacoima, Highland Park, Westlake and Boyle Heights, said Terry
O'Neil, spokesman for Food 4 Less. Carnicerias also have been added
to the company's Foods Co stores in Central and Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   Food 4 Less' warehouse-style stores offer low prices in return for
less service, he said, so full-service meat counters go against their
usual operations. In stores where customers are accustomed to
reaching for their own boxes of cereal on top shelves and bagging
their own groceries, friendly butchers now customize their meats.</TE>
<TE>   "We discovered a lot of our customers bought their groceries with
us but would go down the street to purchase their meat," O'Neil said.
"We wanted to provide full-service carnicerias modeled like the
stores in Mexico and Central America. It's been very successful."</TE>
<TE>   A well-stocked carniceria will offer everything from "flap" steak,
an inexpensive cut from the belly used for stews and carne asada;
freshly ground longaniza sausage for hearty breakfasts; bloody beef
heads for moist barbacoa; leathery tripe for spicy menudo soup; and
hefty beef tongues for tasty tacos. But the most important ingredient
are the carniceros, the men behind the counter handling the meat who
can be counted on to deliver any cut.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not an exaggeration to say a carnicero is just as trusted as
a doctor. You depend on his knowledge for good cuts, for fresh meat.
You trust they're not selling you bad beef," said Justo Frias,
president of Gigante USA Inc., based in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican-owned supermarket chain has stores in Arleta, Pico
Rivera and Covina and is building a store in South-Central Los
Angeles, keeping a Mexican feel throughout, especially at the store's
meat counters. Gigante has hired about 50 carniceros for its
Southland stores, placing such a high value on their expertise that
some butchers have been brought in from Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "A true carnicero is different from a meat cutter. A really,
really good carnicero has to know how to cut and sell at the same
time. It's an art," Frias said. "In most stores nowadays, you don't
have cuts with bones. A carnicero knows how to cut the bones in
different ways. They know we like, we need, bones for certain
dishes."</TE>
<TE>   For that reason and others, carnicerias are labor-intensive and
would not work in every store. "The need is dictated by local
markets, but yes, you will see more carnicerias," said O'Neil of Food
4 Less.</TE>
<TE>   Albertson's has expanded its meat selection to attract Latino
shoppers in about 100 of its Southern California stores by stocking
such cuts as flap steak and pork butt, as well as marinated meats,
spokeswoman Karen Ramos said.</TE>
<TE>   All this has the entire meat industry taking note of the Latino
market, said Jeremy Russell, director of communications for the
National Meat Assn., based in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The organization's conference this spring saw more than 400
professionals from the $80-billion meatpacking and processing
industry discuss how to reach Latino meat consumers, he said, asking
about chorizo and special cuts. In Southern California, Los
Angeles-based meatpacking company Farmer John introduced chorizo as
its newest product in September after customers asked for it, said a
company spokesperson.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still a niche market, but we're looking for products. It's a
small market, but it's big in California," Russell said.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, the California Beef Council is working with 150
carnicerias in the Los Angeles area in a $400,000 campaign to boost
beef sales in the Latino market.</TE>
<TE>   A similar promotion during the summer of 2000 helped increase meat
sales by 5% in the participating Latino markets and carnicerias, said
Berven of the beef council.</TE>
<TE>   "It may not sound like a lot, but it's more than one-third of our
marketing budget," targeting just the Los Angeles market, where about
60% of the state's 11.5 million Latinos live, he said. "It's a very
specific market."</TE>
<TE>   The huge investment in this group of consumers is easy to explain
because "it's easier to produce incremental sales from your best
customer than to try to get new customers," Berven said. "The Latino
is already a good customer. They purchase a lot of beef. They're
heavy beef users, and they are loyal. It's easier to keep them."</TE>
<TE>   And if more Latinos are doing all of their shopping at the
supermarket, including their meat buying, that means fewer are
patronizing the small, mom-and-pop carnicerias.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a shopper and you go to Albertson's and shop and all of
a sudden they have live butchers and 40 feet of fresh-cut meat at the
same price, then more than likely you'll stay there because you're
already doing 90% of your shopping there," Soto said. "The little guy
dies. It's an end of an era of carnicerias."</TE>
<TE>   In the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, Arturo Kenneth
Chavez, 53, wouldn't disagree. He sits staring at the television set
near his register where he mans the counter at Chavez Meat Market.
The store, owned by his wife, Maria Chavez, is open, but few people
seem to know it.</TE>
<TE>   He misses the customers, he says, pointing to an empty space in
front of the meat counter that is just about 5 feet long and houses
few cuts. Another part of the meat counter now holds some cheeses.
Gone is the butcher who used to work full time. Now he visits once or
twice a week to stock the counter.</TE>
<TE>   "There used to be a lot of familias around here, but now they're
gone," says Chavez of his neighborhood east of downtown. They have
been replaced by bohemian hipsters who don't have a taste for tongue
or tripe.</TE>
<TE>   New stores that cropped around the neighborhood, including Vons,
El Rancho Market, 7-Eleven and the 99 Cents Only Store, also have
affected sales, Chavez says. The store used to make as much as $1,500
a day about three years ago, but now it nets about $300 a day. He
supplements his income by helping manage an apartment building, and
occasionally film companies will use the classic-looking convenience
store to shoot commercials and movies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's dead here, but we've put in too much to quit now," Chavez
says. "I work from sunrise to sunset. I was ready to throw in the
towel, but my wife has her heart set in this store."</TE>

<HD>Industry Woes Hit Vivendi's Music Unit</HD>
<DH>Media: With piracy surging and profit falling, no buyer is
seen for a possible sale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The world's premier music company, home to such stars as Eminem and
Pavarotti, may be headed for the auction block--without a buyer in
sight.</LD>
<LD>   The sudden ouster of Vivendi Universal Chairman Jean-Marie Messier
and the crash of the French media giant's stock have led company
insiders and Wall Street analysts to predict that the new management
probably will try to shed some of its $30-billion debt by selling its
Universal Music Group and other entertainment assets.</LD>
<LD>   Had such an opportunity come four years ago, the world's
entertainment corporations would have been jockeying for a piece of
the music property. Now, silence.</LD>
<TE>   "For someone to step up and buy [Universal Music Group] right now,
they'd have to believe that the music business in its current form
has a strong future ahead of it," said Michael B. Nathanson, an
analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. "There is no one left who
believes that."</TE>
<TE>   Plagued by surging piracy, plunging profit and rebellion among its
artist ranks, Universal and other music corporations are struggling
to sustain a way of doing business that, analysts said, is on the
verge of imploding. Things are so bad that one of the biggest music
firms, EMI Group, threatened this year to fire top executives who
refused a 50% pay cut. Most acquiesced.</TE>
<TE>   Studies show CD burning and Internet piracy have decimated sales
of new hits and old catalog albums, shrinking international revenue
by about 20% over the last three years. Despite their efforts, the
labels have failed to develop a consumer-friendly digital delivery
system for music that could hinder file-sharing bandits from stealing
music. Industry figures show 2 of every 5 records sold today is an
illegal copy.</TE>
<TE>   Alarmed at the speed of the industry's descent, the chiefs of the
five largest music corporations convened an extraordinary emergency
summit in New York two weeks ago to devise a strategy to fight
piracy. They could not even agree on the design of an anti-piracy
warning logo on CDs.</TE>
<TE>   Music company stocks have been hit hard too, primarily because
investors have come to distrust the inflated claims of "synergy" that
have undergirded the spree of media company mergers.</TE>
<TE>   A plan by Bertelsmann to harness the technology of outlawed
Napster, the online file-sharing service, hit a sour note and is
expected to be abandoned soon. Promises by AOL Time Warner Inc. to
deliver music through its broadband cable lines have yet to
materialize.</TE>
<TE>   As for Vivendi Universal, Messier boasted that his company would
lead a wireless revolution by delivering its music catalog digitally
to consumer cell phones. That never happened because the technology
didn't work.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is this: One federal agency has accused the industry of
price fixing, another is reviewing antitrust allegations, and artists
are alleging that their labels forced them to sign unfair contracts
that cheat them out of royalty earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an industry in serious trouble," said analyst Nathanson.</TE>
<TE>   With the situation threatening to worsen, music corporations are
scrambling to come up with some way to salvage the industry. One
solution being debated at the top of the industry would transform the
world's largest labels into de facto management firms.</TE>
<TE>   Companies including Sony Music Entertainment, Bertelsmann Music
Group and Vivendi's Def Jam Group are considering a contract system
under which labels would become "partners" in all aspects of the
careers of newly signed artists, including concert tours, advertising
sponsorships and film and TV deals in the hopes of generating new
streams of revenue. At the same time, the labels hope to offer
artists shorter, less-risky contracts with fewer dollars on the front
end but relatively bigger payoffs than they are currently offered
should their records succeed.</TE>
<TE>   Record executives believe that they are due a bigger chunk in
return for the money they spend turning an unknown into a star who
then goes on to make millions of dollars in movies and marketing
deals, none of which is returned to the label's coffers.</TE>
<TE>   But such a restructuring of the business is certain to meet
opposition in the ranks of artist representatives, who believe that
the value of their clients should not revert to companies that simply
release and market their music.</TE>
<TE>   "Do I believe a new economic model has to emerge? Absolutely,"
said artist manager Jim Guerinot, who represents Beck, No Doubt and
the Offspring. "But not this one. It sounds desperate to me. These
corporations hope to extract more from artists simply because CD
sales are down. It won't work."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that such extreme measures are even being considered
today is surprising considering the industry's standing just a decade
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, Wall Street was bullish about the business. Consumers
were in the midst of replenishing their music collections in the new
CD format, providing a massive cash infusion to an industry that saw
even more technological advances ahead--each carrying the potential
for even greater riches. As a result, analysts began assigning huge
values to record labels because they owned vaults of master
recordings that could be repackaged and controlled by the world's
largest music companies.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 30 years, Sony Corp. bought Columbia Records. Warner
Communications bought Atlantic. Bertelsmann bought Arista. PolyGram
bought Island. MCA bought Geffen. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
bought MCA. Seagram bought MCA from Matsushita and then acquired
PolyGram.</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co. and other media companies also were angling for a
piece of the business, sniffing around EMI, which at the time was
being shopped around for about $12 billion. AOL Time Warner made a
pass at EMI too. So did Bertelsmann.</TE>
<TE>   But as the multibillion-dollar merger frenzy peaked, it was
Vivendi that ended up buying Seagram, including its music
business--the world's most successful record corporation, which
included Interscope and Def Jam labels. The company boasted a deep
roster of executive talent and music stars, including Nelly, Shania
Twain, Eminem, U2, Ashanti, Sting and Tupac Shakur.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the company has only gotten bigger and richer.
Analysts value Universal Music Group at $12 billion. Last week, the
company had six of the Top 10 records in the nation and accounted for
more than 40% of all CD sales. That is why executives within
Universal and other companies are so glum over the fact that only a
dramatic drop in price may smoke out a buyer. Who wants to enter a
business, they ask, that is on a grinding descent?</TE>
<TE>   Publicly, however, the industry is working to put the best spin
possible on the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "All of these issues are challenges," said Hilary Rosen,
chairwoman of the Washington-based Recording Industry Assn. of
America, which represents the nation's five largest music
corporations.</TE>
<TE>   "But these challenges in no way diminish the very significant
opportunities in the music business and the potential for growth over
the long term."</TE>

<HD>Study: Globalization Has Reduced World Poverty</HD>
<DH>Preview / WEEK OF JULY 8-14</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Far from creating poverty as critics claim, rapid globalization of
the world economy has sliced the proportion of abject poor across the
planet, according to a controversial study to be released today.</LD>
<LD>   It says that freer commerce, epitomized by the cutting of tariffs
and the lifting of trade barriers, has boosted economic growth and
lifted the incomes of rich and poor alike.</LD>
<LD>   "The proportion of the world's population in absolute poverty is
now lower than it has ever been," the study, written by a group of
respected economists for the London-based Centre for Economic Policy
Research, says.</LD>
<TE>   While accepting that there are costs to globalization that require
robust policy making, the study seeks to refute the claims of
anti-globalization campaigners that Western-dominated capitalism has
damaged the world's poor in the name of profits for large,
multinational and mainly U.S. companies.</TE>
<TE>   The study has already brought a less-than-glowing response from
the European Commission, the European Union's executive body that
commissioned the report.</TE>
<TE>   In a foreword that broadly endorses the report's conclusions,
commission President Romano Prodi distances the commission from some
parts of the report, saying it could not concur with all the study's
analysis.</TE>

<HD>Producer Price Index Expected to Rise 0.1%</HD>
<DH>Preview / WEEK OF JULY 8-14</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Earnings season starts in full this week, and although second-quarter
reports will capture much attention, Wall Street also will be
scrutinizing economic data, including a preliminary inflation
indicator: the producer price index.</LD>
<LD>   The PPI, coming Thursday, is expected to be flat in June from a
decline of 0.4% the month before. Excluding volatile energy and food
prices, the index is expected to rise 0.1%, according to economists.</LD>
<LD>   Retail sales data for June also will be scanned for signs consumer
spending is remaining resilient.</LD>
<TE>   Consumers returned to automobile dealerships and malls last month,
government statistics are likely to show Friday, proof that
households are continuing to prop up the U.S. economic recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Vehicle sales by General Motors Corp. and other auto makers are
believed to have risen last month as bigger cash discounts lured more
consumers. Shoppers looking to stretch their buying power probably
boosted sales at discounters such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Prices for
goods at the wholesale level probably didn't rise in June for a third
straight month, making it easier for consumers to keep spending.</TE>
<TE>   Retail sales rose by 0.7% in June, the Commerce Department is
expected to report. That would follow a 0.9% drop in May, which was
the biggest decline in six months, caused by a slump in auto sales
after car makers reduced incentives.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding autos, the government's retail report will show a 0.5%
increase in June sales, reversing the previous month's 0.4% drop,
economists expect.</TE>
<TE>   Other economic reports this week:</TE>
<TE>   * Today, the Federal Reserve will report on consumer debt for May.</TE>
<TE>   * Wednesday, the Labor Department will report on prices of
imported goods for June. The Commerce Department will report on
wholesale inventories in May.</TE>

<HD>Bank of China IPO on Hong Kong Exchange</HD>
<DH>Preview / WEEK OF JULY 8-14</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In what could be Hong Kong's biggest initial public offering this
year, the Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd. is preparing to list on the
stock exchange this month, possibly leading the way for other Chinese
state-run banks.</LD>
<LD>   The bank's international road show for the IPO, which is intended
to raise $3 billion, starts today. The reception it receives could
indicate the prospects for other state-run banks hoping to tap
international capital as they rebuild asset bases.</LD>
<LD>   In the run-up for the listing, set for July 25, Bank of China
(Hong Kong) has sought to distinguish itself from mainland parent
Bank of China, which is burdened with bad loans and troubled by
alleged misconduct by former managers.</LD>
<TE>   Cleaning up its books ahead of the listing, the Hong Kong unit has
transferred billions of dollars of its own non-performing loans to an
asset management company set up by the parent bank and written off
hundreds of millions more. Still, the bank reported that
non-performing loans accounted for 11% of its total loans at the end
of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   To prepare for the listing, Bank of China (Hong Kong) was formed
Oct. 1 by a merger of 10 of the 12 Hong Kong banks within the Bank of
China Group.</TE>

<HD>Former WorldCom Execs to Testify at Hearing</HD>
<DH>Preview / WEEK OF JULY 8-14</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The key figures in WorldCom Inc.'s nearly $4-billion accounting
scandal saga have remained out of the limelight after the company's
disclosure two weeks ago that expenses were improperly accounted.</LD>
<LD>   But they won't stay silent much longer.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the House Financial Services Committee begins hearings to
determine who knew what about the company's finances. Five people
have been subpoenaed by the committee, and four others have been
invited to testify. The company is under investigation by the federal
government.</LD>
<TE>   Subpoenaed to testify is company founder and former Chief
Executive Bernard J. Ebbers, who was ousted in April after the
company's stock had fallen 90% in 12 months. Though he hasn't talked
to reporters, he told his church congregation he didn't "knowingly
commit fraud."</TE>
<TE>   Former Chief Financial Officer Scott D. Sullivan, who came to
WorldCom in 1992 and was fired last month, also is scheduled to
appear. In early 2001, as the company's fortunes began to decline,
WorldCom officials say, Sullivan began accounting for day-to-day
operating expenses as capital expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Also to be called by the committee are CEO John W. Sidgmore, who
replaced Ebbers, promising to restore faith in the company, and Jack
Grubman, a financial analyst for Salomon Smith Barney in New York who
drew fire for recommending WorldCom stock as it fell.</TE>
<TE>   Invited to testify are WorldCom Chairman Bert Roberts and the
company's former auditor, Arthur Andersen. WorldCom internal auditor
Cynthia Cooper, who discovered the first accounting problem, and Max
Bobbitt, head of the board of directors' audit committee, had been
invited to testify but will not appear, reportedly because the
Justice Department wants to question them first.</TE>

<HD>Cendant Seeks to Query SEC Chief Accountant</HD>
<DH>Preview / WEEK OF JULY 8-14</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cendant Corp. wants to question Securities and Exchange Commission
Chief Accountant Robert Herdman to get information that supports the
company's lawsuit against his former employer, Ernst &amp; Young.</LD>
<LD>   Cendant, the largest hotel franchiser, and former auditor Ernst
sued each other over improper accounting that Cendant disclosed in
April 1998, prompting a one-day, $14-billion drop in the stock.</LD>
<LD>   Cendant later restated $500 million in revenue and paid $3.2
billion to settle shareholder suits.</LD>
<TE>   Herdman, who as a vice chairman reviewed accounting decisions and
auditors' financial ties with clients before joining the SEC in
October, is awaiting a court-appointed official's ruling on whether
he must answer Cendant's questions.</TE>
<TE>   Herdman has knowledge of a 1998 internal probe by Ernst of
Cendant's accounting and now faces a conflict of interest because the
SEC is investigating, experts say. Ernst has argued in court papers
that Herdman's duties at the SEC should preclude him from answering
Cendant's questions about his 28 years at the accounting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Tarleton, a special master overseeing the case, held a
telephone conference last week with lawyers and is expected to rule
soon. He declined to comment, as did Herdman, Ernst &amp; Young and
Cendant spokesman Elliot Bloom.</TE>
<TE>   SEC spokeswoman Christi Harlan said Herdman "was aware of the
internal investigation" by Ernst. The Wall Street Journal last month
reported Herdman participated in the Ernst probe.</TE>

<HD>AT&amp;T Chairman Sees Tenure as a Success</HD>
<DH>Preview / WEEK OF JULY 8-14</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite some missteps and retrenchments, AT&amp;T Corp. Chairman C.
Michael Armstrong will declare victory this week after battling for
more than four years to lead the telephone company through an
industry boom and bust that has claimed several rivals as casualties.</LD>
<LD>   Armstrong , who became chairman in October 1997, shifted
125-year-old AT&amp;T away from its shrinking long-distance telephone
business, giving once-dowdy "Ma Bell" a chance at a future with
high-speed data and Internet services.</LD>
<LD>   But he did not realize his vision of turning AT&amp;T, the No. 1 U.S.
long-distance telephone and cable television company, into a one-stop
shop for voice, data and video services. After several acquisitions,
the company decided to split itself up.</LD>
<TE>   He must acknowledge at his final shareholders meeting Wednesday in
Charleston, S.C., that AT&amp;T shares have fallen about 70% during his
tenure, underperforming the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index by about 70%.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders at the annual meeting will vote on the planned
$27-billion sale of the AT&amp;T Broadband cable television unit to
Comcast Corp., creation of a tracking stock for the AT&amp;T Consumer
unit, and a one-for-five reverse split of AT&amp;T's common stock.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong will leave AT&amp;T to become chairman of the combined AT&amp;T
Comcast when the sale of the Broadband unit closes later this year.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T's remaining business will provide telephone and data services
to about 50 million residential customers and 4 million corporate
customers.</TE>

<LD>Local telephone company Qwest Communications International Inc.,
which faces a federal investigation into its accounting practices,
said Sunday it named Oren Shaffer as its new chief financial officer
and vice chairman, and reorganized its operations to focus on
consumers, businesses and wholesale customers.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes just three weeks after the No. 4 U.S. local
telephone company ousted its former chairman, Joseph Nacchio, and
replaced him with Dick Notebaert, who headed telecommunications
equipment maker Tellabs Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Denver-based Qwest, the dominant local phone company in 14 states
from Minnesota to Washington, has been under pressure for months as
it scrambled to relieve a cash crunch. Credit rating agencies have
slashed the company's debt to "junk" status, and the Securities and
Exchange Commission is probing its accounting practices.</LD>
<TE>   The company also has put up for sale several assets, including its
$9-billion QwestDex telephone directory publishing business, which is
slated to get a second round of takeover bids this week, sources
familiar with the situation said.</TE>
<TE>   Shaffer, 59, who replaced CFO Robin Szeliga, previously served as
president and chief operating officer of Sorrento Networks Corp., a
maker of optical products, and worked as a business consultant.</TE>
<TE>   From 1994 to 2000, Shaffer served as CFO of Ameritech, the local
telephone company acquired by SBC Communications Inc., where he
served under Notebaert. Before that, he spent 25 years at Goodyear
Tire &amp; Rubber Co., where he was CFO and a member of the board of
directors.</TE>
<TE>   Szeliga will remain with Qwest as an executive vice president
focusing on reducing the company's $26.6 billion in "junk"-rated
debt.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's organizational changes will bring greater focus to our
efforts to meet the needs of our customers and streamline the company
for the key priority of retaining and growing our business,"
Notebaert said.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest, which said it may make additional management changes,
expanded the responsibilities of its president and chief operating
officer, Afshin Mohebbi, who will oversee all of Qwest's operating
units.</TE>
<TE>   The company also restructured its various business units. Its
residential, wireless, cable and video businesses have been combined
as the consumer markets group under Executive Vice President Annette
Jacobs, who was formerly responsible for the wireless business.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dell Computer Corp., the world's biggest direct seller of personal
computers, is putting kiosks in shopping centers in 20 U.S. cities to
demonstrate PCs as the company seeks to boost sales to consumers.</LD>
<LD>   The kiosks will have about five samples of Dell computers and
accessories such as printers and scanners, spokesman Bob Kaufman
said.</LD>
<LD>   Dell, which doesn't sell in stores, is testing the kiosks to see
whether they can increase sales, particularly in the back-to-school
and the holiday seasons, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The company, which gets about 85% of its business from
corporations, schools and governments, has increased sales to
consumers even as other PC makers stumble. The Austin, Texas-based
company has used advertisements featuring a young pitchman named
Steven and promoted products on the QVC home shopping channel.
Consumer sales rose 26% in the first quarter from a year earlier.</TE>

<HD>SongPro Music Players Will Link to Game Boys</HD>

<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SongPro Inc. said it will launch a digital music player this fall
that will attach to Nintendo Co.'s Game Boy hand-held consoles.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles company, founded by Silicon Graphics Inc.
co-founder Marc Hannah and former News Corp. executive Jon Richmond,
expects to sell the device for less than $99.</LD>
<LD>   About the size of a Game Boy Color game cartridge, the plug-in
player will have 32 megabytes of memory, enough to hold about 30
minutes of digital music.</LD>
<TE>   Users can download music stored in MP3 or Windows Media formats to
the device from a computer via a Universal Serial Bus port.</TE>
<TE>   Richmond said he expects to have "hundreds of thousands" of
licensed, downloadable songs--both free and for sale--on SongPro's
Web site by the launch. The songs will come with pictures and words,
such as album covers and lyrics, for display on the Game Boy screen.</TE>
<TE>   SongPro files, however, can be played back only on the company's
device. The plug-in is designed to be compatible with Game Boy Color
and Game Boy Advance consoles.</TE>
<TE>   Nintendo has sold about 125 million Game Boys worldwide.</TE>

<HD>Fox Sports to Launch Online Baseball Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fox Sports Networks this week will launch a subscription fee-based
online baseball game that will incorporate real-life game statistics,
such as average pitch speeds and batting averages of individual
players.</LD>
<LD>   The game, developed by Wild Tangent in Redmond, Wash., and
available on the company's FoxSports.com Web site, will cost $9.95 a
month or $19.95 for the 2002 season. Subscribers can compete in a
tournament. Winners are based on real-world performance of the
baseball teams and how well subscribers do in the computer game,
called "Hit the Pros."</LD>
<LD>   The game is one of many burgeoning efforts to make money from
Internet-based games, most of which currently are available for free
and supported by shrinking advertising dollars.</LD>
<TE>   Revenues from online games are relatively small--just $300 million
this year compared with more than $10 billion for the overall U.S.
video game market, according to IDC, a market research firm.</TE>

<HD>Internet's Longtime Diplomat</HD>
<DH>Vinton Cerf is a voice of reason for the medium he helped
create.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICK JESDANUN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vinton Cerf sounded an alarm when some U.S. lawmakers wanted to fence
off Internet pornography by creating an ".xxx" domain name: He didn't
see how adult sites could be forced to move there.</LD>
<LD>   Persuaded largely by Cerf's arguments, the lawmakers opted instead
for a ".kids.us" domain that kid-friendly sites could voluntarily
inhabit and that would respect global differences by being an
American address.</LD>
<LD>   Once again, a man widely respected as one of the fathers of the
Net exercised a moderating influence over the medium he helped
create.</LD>
<TE>   More than a quarter of a century after co-developing the
communications protocols that glue the Internet together, Cerf still
binds the global meta-network: He is a savvy mediator among the
technical, business and political communities that try to shape it.</TE>
<TE>   Cerf tries to keep bad decisions from wrecking the
Internet--chiefly by translating geekspeak into English.</TE>
<TE>   "I do consider myself a kind of advocate for understanding as much
as possible about the Net, even if it's just a matter of having a
kind of cartoon model of how it works," Cerf said. "Even cartoon
models can lead you to reason correctly about the effect of various
decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Advocate. Ambassador. Voice of reason.</TE>
<TE>   "What Vint has brought to the table very much is the ability to
talk about what the Internet is outside the tech community," said
David Farber, former chief technologist for the Federal
Communications Commission. "By being in the middle, he keeps them
from doing a lot of damage."</TE>
<TE>   All that, and a sense of humor too.</TE>
<TE>   Describing Internet-enabled socks that can monitor vital signs,
Cerf speculated: Why not use the same technology to let the left sock
call out to the right when the two separate?</TE>
<TE>   His speech at the recent Internet Society conference drew laughs
and a wide round of applause.</TE>
<TE>   On behalf of that group, Cerf articulates a vision of a shared
responsibility among Internet users and developers for making the
Internet available, secure, affordable, accessible to everyone and
free of excessive government and commercial control.</TE>
<TE>   He also stays involved in research.</TE>
<TE>   At WorldCom Inc., Cerf is a senior vice president for advanced
networking, including services that combine data, voice and video. He
was with MCI years before it merged with WorldCom and helped design
MCI Mail, one of the Net's first commercial applications.</TE>
<TE>   At NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Cerf works on extending the
Net's reach into outer space.</TE>
<TE>   Cerf also is honorary chairman of the IPv6 Forum, which promotes a
next-generation numbering system to accommodate the ever-growing
armies of Internet-ready wireless devices, game consoles and even
wine corks.</TE>
<TE>   And in one of his most contentious roles, Cerf is chairman of the
Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers, the key oversight body
for domain names.</TE>
<TE>   All this wouldn't have happened without the TCP/IP protocols that
Cerf and Robert Kahn invented in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   The Net in its earliest days was a single network operated by the
Defense Department. Cerf and Kahn were charged with changing its
communications protocols to interconnect--internet--multiple
networks.</TE>
<TE>   The team decided to make the new protocols dumb but flexible--in
contrast to rivals' feature-rich, proprietary techniques.</TE>
<TE>   That proved crucial and allowed applications such as e-mail and
the World Wide Web to connect, along with personal computers and
wireless devices not anticipated then.</TE>
<TE>   Cerf always understood that technology doesn't exist in a vacuum.</TE>
<TE>   Hearing impaired since 13, Cerf found in e-mail an ability to
communicate with clarity that he couldn't get on the telephone, even
with hearing aids.</TE>
<TE>   His recognition that the Internet was as much about the people as
about computers and wires would be his guiding force in years to
come.</TE>
<TE>   "He's given the Internet a heart," said Don Heath, former chief
executive for the Internet Society.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Nelson, a former White House aide and now an IBM Corp.
executive, described Cerf as "someone whom policymakers and industry
leaders look to for advice."</TE>
<TE>   Cerf often visits the White House, on his own or as part of an
advisory group. He is a regular on Capitol Hill and has met leaders
in Britain, Germany, Japan, India and other countries.</TE>
<TE>   Cerf recalls one recent conversation with a congressman who wanted
to tackle security by ensuring that every data packet was
authenticated by computer routers, the Internet's traffic cops. He
said he succeeded in explaining that if routers had to do that, they
wouldn't have any computing power left to perform their basic tasks.</TE>
<TE>   Not that governments always listen.</TE>
<TE>   Cerf testified before a French court deciding whether Yahoo Inc.
should have to remove Nazi-related materials from its online
auctions, even though they were legal elsewhere. Though Cerf and
other experts warned that the requirement was impractical, the judge
imposed it anyhow.</TE>
<TE>   Nor does Cerf always succeed in mediating.</TE>
<TE>   Questions of authority and legitimacy continue to dog ICANN, even
after Cerf assumed chairmanship of the naming oversight body in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a little bit out of his realm in this policy debate," said
Karl Auerbach, a board member and frequent critic of ICANN.</TE>
<TE>   Cerf rarely appears in public without a three-piece suit--he wore
them back in high school too, noted Steve Crocker, a classmate and
fellow Internet pioneer. Even then, Crocker said, Cerf was
"tremendously well-rounded. He was in the math club and took a prize
in a poetry magazine."</TE>
<TE>   Cerf tested the first Internet hookups in 1969 as a UCLA graduate
student and developed the networking protocols as a Stanford
University professor. In 1997, then-President Clinton presented him
and Kahn the National Medal of Technology.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Malamud, founder of the nonprofit Internet Multicasting
Service, said Cerf commands respect because of his vast knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what meeting he'd show up at, he'd show up for five
minutes and he'd have something constructive to say," Malamud said.</TE>
<TE>   And hence a distinction bestowed on him as a father of the
Internet, a label "he's a little uncomfortable with [but has] come to
accept," Malamud said.</TE>
<TE>   Cerf would rather stress the teamwork behind the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very resistant to that label--as if to say only one or two or
a few people can cause something like this to happen. There were
thousands of people," Cerf said. "But I do acknowledge ... I was
around at the very beginning."</TE>

<DH>Telecom: Docking stations conveniently combine wireless and
wired service on the same two-line phone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRUCE MEYERSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With cell phone companies heaping thousands of "free" off-peak
minutes on subscribers, the wireless crowd is beginning to question
the wisdom of paying extra to make long-distance calls on regular
home phones.</LD>
<LD>   Although many may not mind using a cell phone indoors, a small but
growing number of people use a special cradle that allows them to
make wireless calls using a "regular" telephone.</LD>
<LD>   I can see why. Talking on a cell phone indoors feels all wrong.</LD>
<TE>   The sound of cellular still can't compare with the near-perfection
of a wired phone, and after a lifetime of gripping a full-sized
receiver between ear and shoulder, a mobile phone seems inadequate
for gabbing away the hours.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, I think many people, leery of overtime charges, still
view cellular as a tool for quickie calls--not hourlong talkfests.</TE>
<TE>   The two docking stations I tested, VoxLink and CellSocket, do a
reasonable job of addressing some of the aforementioned shortcomings.
But both products, which can be found for as low as $100, remain
works in progress.</TE>
<TE>   The devices, which are compatible only with certain popular
handset models, conveniently combine wireless and wired service on
the same two-line phone, helping blur the distinction between
cellular and regular calls.</TE>
<TE>   They look like the desktop cradles used to sync a hand-held
computer or recharge a cell phone. In fact, both devices also double
as a recharger for a mobile handset, though the CellSocket stops
charging whenever the device is being used for a call.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on your preference, you can set up a distinctive ring
for incoming cellular calls or use the same ring tone for both types
of call.</TE>
<TE>   Psychologically, because my cell phone was now patched into my
home phone, there was less reason to view wireless as a beast
peculiar to the great outdoors: no tiny handset, no pulling up an
antenna, no ear bud.</TE>
<TE>   Except for hitting the pound sign after punching in a number--the
equivalent of hitting "talk" or "send" on a cell phone--dialing was
virtually identical.</TE>
<TE>   There was, of course, the obligatory pause before a wireless call
connects. But that was no big deal.</TE>
<TE>   To further replicate the experience of using a regular phone, the
docking stations even generate a dial tone for the wireless line when
you pick up the receiver.</TE>
<TE>   Although the VoxLink and CellSocket seemed to eliminate some of
the tinny, crackly sounds of cellular, there are lingering
shortcomings to wireless phones and networks that are beyond the
control of these docking stations.</TE>
<TE>   Invariably, of course, there were times when my cell phone
couldn't pick up a signal, failed to connect a call on the first try
or, worst of all, disconnected in mid-sentence. There were times when
only one person could hear clearly.</TE>
<TE>   That sort of thing just doesn't happen anymore in wireline
telephones. In the industry, they refer to it as "the five nines,"
meaning 99.999% reliability.</TE>
<TE>   Although wireless technology and network coverage has improved
steadily in recent years, cell phones still don't do the five nines,
or even the two nines, and that's not something you can fix with
VoxLink or CellSocket.</TE>
<TE>   Even if you buy a booster antenna for the phone, or one made
specifically for the CellSocket, there are going to be issues with
reliability and clarity, particularly for indoor calls. It all
depends on your tolerance for such things.</TE>
<TE>   There was little distinction in the basic sound quality and
performance of the two products. But the VoxLink may hold some added
appeal to some users for a few reasons.</TE>
<TE>   First and foremost is compatibility: VoxLink works with a wide
variety of Nokia, Motorola and Ericsson phones. The CellSocket only
works with several Nokia lines, though a version for Motorola phones
is being readied for launch.</TE>
<TE>   In terms of aesthetics, the VoxLink is smaller, and so takes up
less real estate on a night table or desk, and a bit sleeker compared
with the boxier CellSocket.</TE>
<TE>   Another possible advantage with VoxLink is a feature for those who
have a certain type of home wiring that would enable them to route
their wireless calls to all the phones in the house.</TE>
<TE>   Though certainly an appealing feature, the instruction manual
probably will be mind-numbing or intimidating for anyone who isn't
familiar with the esoterics of standard phone wiring.</TE>
<TE>   I managed to get this feature to work on one of my phones, but not
all of them, and that's where I gave up.</TE>

<HD>Vodafone to Seek Vivendi's Stake in Cegetel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Vodafone Group is planning to offer $4.6 billion for Vivendi
Universal's stake in Cegetel, France's second-largest phone company,
the London Observer reported Sunday, citing people familiar with the
situation.</LD>
<LD>   Europe's biggest mobile-phone company, which already owns 15% of
Cegetel, told UBS Warburg and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to approach
Vivendi about buying its 44% stake in the phone company, the British
newspaper said. The move would give Vodafone control of Cegetel's
mobile-phone unit, SFR.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi Universal, which ousted Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier
last week, is expected to sell some assets to pay off its huge debt,
unwinding Messier's $77 billion in takeovers, analysts have said.
Vodafone CEO Christopher Gent has expressed interest in acquiring
SFR.</LD>
<TE>   Vodafone spokeswoman Melissa Stimpson declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Cegetel owns 80% of SFR, with the rest held by Vodafone. The
French company is profitable, with 12 million customers, the Observer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's stake in Cegetel may be worth $6.3 billion to $8
billion, according to estimates from analysts at J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;
Co. and Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Vodafone could pay for the acquisition using existing credit
lines, which wouldn't lead to a cut in its credit ratings, the paper
reported analysts as saying. Still, the Financial Times, citing a
report by British stockbroker Collins Stewart Holdings, said Saturday
that the company's ratings may be lowered as a result of the
purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Vodafone has an A rating from Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. and an A2
rating from Moody's Investors Service.</TE>

<HD>You've Got Spam</HD>
<DH>One sure way to stop unwanted e-mail is to make the senders
pay</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SONIA ARRISON</AU>
<BD>Sonia Arrison is director of the Center for Technology
Studies at the California-based Pacific Research Institute. E-mail:
sarrison@pacificresearch.org.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone with an e-mail account knows that spam--unsolicited commercial
e-mail--is a problem. Legislators and technologists are desperate for
a solution, but they are searching in the wrong direction.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately, there's an easy answer that's been floating around
the Web for years.</LD>
<LD>   First, it's clear that spam cannot be legislated away. This is
true because American legislation can be effectively enforced on
American firms alone, and much unsolicited e-mail originates from
outside the country. As Internet legend Vinton Cerf recently said,
the absence of global law makes spam laws hard to enforce. Even the
most draconian laws won't stop unsavory characters with frequently
changing e-mail accounts from sending notes on how to become a
millionaire by stuffing envelopes. The U.S. already has anti-fraud
laws that the Federal Trade Commission is busy trying to enforce.</LD>
<TE>   And defining spam is almost impossible. For most people, spam is
simply e-mail they don't want. "For me, spam is those jokes that
friends send around," explained Vincent Schiavone of ePrivacy Group.</TE>
<TE>   For others, spam is a political message from a California
gubernatorial wannabe or a virus accidentally sent from Sen. Joseph
Lieberman.</TE>
<TE>   Spam is a serious problem, costing companies heavily in server
storage space and lost employee time. According to Brightmail, a
company that makes anti-spam technology, there were 4.7 million such
spam incidents in May, up from 930,546 a year earlier. Anti-spam
software, such as the filters on one's Hotmail account, can help
reduce the load, but they are not sufficiently effective because they
can't know all the relationships between user and sender. Sometimes
they eliminate e-mail they shouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   There is a potential solution that could wipe away those nasty
promises of all-you-can-eat Viagra and offers for bogus international
driver's licenses. The answer is economics.</TE>
<TE>   The reason spam is such a problem is that it travels free. This
creates incentives to send as much unsolicited e-mail to as many
people as possible. The solution, therefore, is to create an
infrastructure where spammers have to pay for their follies.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how it could work: Companies such as Microsoft and PayPal,
a financial services firm, could team up to create a system that
would allow users to charge anyone they didn't know to send them
e-mail. Family and friends would be put on the "do not charge" list,
and their e-mails would arrive free in the user's in-box. For anyone
the user didn't know, a charge of 50 cents (or whatever price the
user wanted) could be levied. If, after the payment and the e-mail
from the unknown mailer were received, the user decided that he
wanted to communicate with the previously unknown person, he could
put that person on the free list and return the money.</TE>
<TE>   Is this a feasible system?</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's engineers thought so. Colin Birge, program manager for
Microsoft's MS Office group, called it "an interesting idea."</TE>
<TE>   PayPal is currently barred from talking publicly as part of
Securities and Exchange Commission filings, but sources close to the
company said a micropayment system to deal with spam was possible.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Rode, CEO of iPIN, a micropayment firm that works with
Vodaphone and France Telecom, among other companies, said it would be
possible to "build a spam-costing system using our technology, and it
would help tremendously in dealing with wasted bandwidth and
storage."</TE>
<TE>   Internet service providers are the most obvious economic victims
of spam because it clogs their servers and wastes bandwidth. It makes
sense that they should take the lead in implementing this type of
system. So what are they waiting for?</TE>
<TE>   As the dot-com world has come to understand, economics matter.
Laws and filters are unlikely to eliminate spam. The best way to give
users control of their e-mail is to make spammers pay. Literally.</TE>

<HD>The 'Small Stick' Approach</HD>
<DH>Our tepid business reformers should look to old Teddy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY COHEN</AU>
<BD>Nancy Cohen, author of "The Reconstruction of American
Liberalism, 1865-1914" (University of North Carolina Press, 2002),

<DL></DL>
<LD>As President Bush plans his first major response to the current
scandals of capitalism, he could do worse than look for guidance from
his Republican counterpart at the turn of the last century, President
Theodore Roosevelt.</LD>
<LD>   In 1902, Roosevelt instructed the Justice Department to prosecute
the Northern Securities Co. for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act.
Northern Securities was the WorldCom and Enron of the Gilded Age. Its
crimes were exemplary of pervasive corporate corruption.</LD>
<LD>   What was Northern Securities' offense? It had employed an
aggressive merger strategy to gain a lock on transcontinental
shipping from Chicago to the Pacific Coast. Scarcely a farmer,
merchant or manufacturer didn't feel the weight of the railroad
monopoly.</LD>
<TE>   Then as now, all that synergistic merging required creative
approaches to finance. To fuel its acquisitions, Northern Securities
issued a blizzard of "watered stock" worth nothing. The dividends on
those fictitious securities, however, required real cash.</TE>
<TE>   The solution? Exploit the power of monopoly to charge shippers
inflated prices. In the language of the day, it was a case of the
"plundered people" being fleeced by the "moneyed interests."</TE>
<TE>   Roosevelt's decision to go after Northern Securities put teeth
back into a law that had been eviscerated by the Supreme Court, took
on the richest and most politically influential capitalists and
endeared Roosevelt to a public long-agitated over the undemocratic
power the new corporations had amassed.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the government's success in the Northern Securities
litigation was in no small part responsible for Roosevelt's landslide
victory in the 1904 presidential election. And it helped mark the
beginning of the end of the Gilded Age and business' unaccountable
and unchecked reign, along with the opening of the reform period
known as the Progressive Era.</TE>
<TE>   With Bush's performance in the current crisis likely to be a major
factor in the 2004 presidential election, will he turn Roosevelt's
motto on its head--speak loudly and carry a small stick--or will he
propose measures the Rough Rider himself would be proud of?</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Bush operates in an environment far less conducive
to acts of political daring than Roosevelt enjoyed, despite the
remarkable similarities between the two eras.</TE>
<TE>   The essential difference is that, a century ago, the United States
bristled with debate about the danger that concentrated wealth posed
to American democracy. Muckraking journalists devoted their best
efforts to exposing corporate malefactors. Many members of the
Protestant clergy preached a "social gospel," while their
parishioners organized in working-class neighborhoods to improve
living and working conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Prominent, too, were the burgeoning socialist movements in Europe
and, increasingly, in the United States. If capitalism couldn't
deliver to the common people, an attractive alternative seemed at
hand.</TE>
<TE>   Roosevelt was goaded into action by the pressure of the American
citizens. Capitalizing on this environment, Roosevelt and, after him,
President Woodrow Wilson were able to preside over the creation of
landmark consumer protection, labor reform and antitrust laws. The
Pure Food and Drug Act ended the routine poisoning of American
consumers, and Roosevelt employed executive power to remove millions
of acres of public land from the reach of private mining and
agricultural interests. Under Wilson, the Clayton Act and the Federal
Trade Commission laid the foundation for the government's regulation
of business through the 20th century. The Clayton Act also gave the
first federal recognition to the legal right of workers to organize
unions, while a series of other laws were passed to prohibit child
labor, limit working hours and provide legal rights and compensation
to workers injured on the job.</TE>
<TE>   Today, in contrast, our politicians, Republican and Democrat
alike, respond to corporate scandal by sparring over how strict to
make accounting and reporting rules, whether to make individual
corporate officers personally liable for malfeasance, and the reach
of sanctions in matters of fraud. While such reforms are imperative,
neither the voters nor international investors are likely to be
comforted by such a "small stick" approach.</TE>
<TE>   Real leadership in the current crisis must recognize that the most
effective check on corporate abuse is the ability of citizens to act
in their own defense. If this means reevaluating the deregulations
that have whittled away consumer rights, reforming Cold War-era labor
laws that effectively prevent workers from organizing unions, or
enacting other dramatic structural changes in the balance of power
between corporate and individual citizens, that's what wielding a
"big stick" is all about.</TE>
<TE>   Roosevelt's contributions to the viability of corporate capitalism
are still admired 100 years later. Will history say the same of
George W. Bush?</TE>

<HD>Mental Health Insurance Parity Is an Empty Notion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COHEN and KEITH HOELLER</AU>
<BD>David Cohen is a professor of social welfare at Florida
International University, Miami. Keith Hoeller is editor of the
Review of Existential Psychology &amp; Psychiatry in Seattle.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The symptoms of the nation's ailing health-care system are easy to
recite. But making an accurate diagnosis and prescribing the proper
treatment are difficult. Even with the best of intentions, we might
misdiagnose the problem, prescribe the wrong treatment and kill the
patient.</LD>
<LD>   This might happen if Congress follows President Bush's lead and
passes legislation mandating mental health insurance parity.</LD>
<LD>   The basic idea behind parity legislation is to cover mental
illness on the same basis as physical illness. Arguments offered by
proponents of parity are well-known: Although one in five Americans
suffers from a mental illness, few seek treatment because of the
stigma; mental illness is just like physical illness; and new drugs
help millions recover quickly.</LD>
<TE>   Each of these claims is misleading, false and dangerous. The
stigma associated with mental health treatment has nothing to do with
the extent of insurance coverage. This stigma has more to do with the
messages that people know come with a psychiatric diagnosis: that
they are damaged, that no treatment can cure their illness and that
prescribed treatment--usually drugs and more drugs--would be needed
indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, outpatient psychiatric drugs accounted for 9% of the
nation's direct spending on mental health. This figure has increased
dramatically since, with the drug companies' successful marketing.
Sales of antidepressants--drugs repeatedly found to be no more
effective than placebos--reached $10.4 billion in 2000, and $6.5
billion more was spent on antipsychotics and anti-anxiety drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The mantra of the mental health movement--whose major lay and
professional branches, such as the National Alliance for the Mentally
Ill and the American Psychiatric Assn., have deep financial roots in
the drug companies--has been that mental illnesses are just like
physical illnesses and therefore should be covered by insurance. But
mental illnesses are precisely not like physical illnesses in at
least two fundamental ways: Their diagnosis bears no resemblance to
diagnosis in any other branch of medicine, and mental patients
routinely get treated against their will.</TE>
<TE>   Before 1980 and the third edition of the American Psychiatric
Assn.'s then virtually unknown Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, most mental health practitioners did not even make
official mental health diagnoses. With insurers wanting
standardization to pay mental health claims, however, the American
Psychiatric Assn. redesigned the manual to become the standard for
insurance payment. No diagnosis, no payment. As a result, the number
of mental illnesses has increased, along with new drugs to treat
them.</TE>
<TE>   Clinical psychologists initially balked when the revised manual
was set to declare that all these new diagnoses were medical
"diseases." But when that word was replaced by "disorder," they
eagerly began diagnosing and collecting money from insurers.</TE>
<TE>   Most diagnosing in mental health is based on observation. No
physical test detects or confirms the presence of any mental illness.
Mental health professionals can create new illnesses without any
laboratory data to back them up. Nonmedical personnel can diagnose
these illnesses simply by looking them up in the manual.</TE>
<TE>   When about 40 million Americans still lack medical insurance and
millions more have minimal coverage, and when private coverage of
nursing-home expenses is nil, why should mental illnesses be covered
by health insurance?</TE>
<TE>   There is another way in which mental illnesses are not like
physical illnesses. Psychiatrists and other mental health
professionals routinely force their treatments on people who
explicitly refuse them and they then get paid by insurers for these
"treatments."</TE>
<TE>   That millions more Americans are using a dozen new psychiatric
drugs does not mean we are reducing the burden of suffering. The
scientific evidence does not show that the incidence or prevalence of
any major mental disorder has been reduced over the last 50 years, or
even that long-term outcomes have improved.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, mental health parity would increase coverage for
specialty and general medical services such as hospitalization and
drugs. However, there is no evidence that parity would encourage the
development of a diversified human service sector or that consumers
would benefit from easier access to a free marketplace of mental
health services.</TE>

<HD>A Black Republican Wises Up and Opts Out</HD>
<DH>At last, Watts saw the GOP power brokers' duplicity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EARL OFARI HUTCHINSON</AU>
<BD>Earl Ofari Hutchinson is the author of "The Crisis in
Black and Black" (Middle Passage Press, 1998). E-mail:

<DL></DL>
<LD>The torrent of praise from President Bush, Republican congressional
leaders and political pundits for retiring Rep. J.C. Watts, a GOP
member from Oklahoma, sharply contrasted with the deafening silence
from black Democrats and civil rights leaders. This should hardly
surprise.</LD>
<LD>   After his election from a predominantly white district in 1994, he
threw down the gauntlet to black Democrats. He defiantly declared he
would not join the Congressional Black Caucus.</LD>
<LD>   In one of the keynote addresses at the Republican convention in
1996, Watts also challenged the old-line civil rights leadership. He
punched all the conservative hot buttons, championing family values
and self-help and hammering welfare and public housing.</LD>
<TE>   Watts goaded black Democrats and civil rights leaders a year later
when he branded them "race-hustling poverty pimps." It was a low in
mudslinging, and the reaction was swift and harsh.</TE>
<TE>   A somewhat chagrined Watts and his Republican mentors rushed to
claim that he was not talking about any one leader or point of view.
However, anyone remotely familiar with the political battle between
liberals and conservatives knew what and whom he meant and what they
represented--liberalism and blacks.</TE>
<TE>   But Watts was not skating entirely on thin political ice in his
attacks on traditional black leaders. He knew that a growing number
of blacks publicly called themselves conservative and that many
blacks privately agreed with his political beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   Watts also knew that the old-line civil rights leadership was in
crisis. It was relentlessly battered and bruised during the 1980s and
1990s by conservative politicians and a lack of leadership. Much of
the public had become hard-nosed against increased civil rights
protections and social programs.</TE>
<TE>   Watts and black conservatives believed that time and the deep
financial pockets of GOP conservatives were on their side and that
more blacks would eventually rally to their banner, leaving Watts and
company the new black leaders.</TE>
<TE>   However, although many blacks brand traditional black leaders the
purveyors of "plantation politics," calling them sycophants of the
Democrats, most blacks will continue to be Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   And while Bush made much about inclusion before and during the
presidential campaign, the Florida vote debacle still rankles many
blacks. The president also has been silent on expanded hate-crime
laws and mandatory sentencing laws. He has opposed any discussion of
black reparations and has renewed his call for school vouchers, which
most black Democrats and civil rights leaders condemn.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Bush's shabby treatment of the Congressional Black
Caucus. Its members, all solid Democrats, have repeatedly asked for a
meeting with the president to try to work out colossal differences.
Bush has repeatedly put them off. This is a terrible mistake. For the
last 30 years, black officials have fought tough battles in the
courts and in Congress for voting rights, affirmative action, school
integration and an end to housing and job discrimination and police
abuse. Many blacks regard the caucus as their political voice, and
they expect Bush too to recognize and respect it.</TE>
<TE>   Though some blacks have reservations, if not outright doubts,
about affirmative action, welfare and other social programs, they are
not prepared to dump them. Watts and black conservatives are, but
they offer nothing better. Their politics and leadership are just as
"plantation" as the black Democrats they gleefully lambaste.</TE>
<TE>   That was apparent in how the Republican leadership used Watts. He
was a good mouthpiece for conservative causes and a visible symbol of
their supposed commitment to racial inclusion. But, his position as
No. 4 House GOP leader notwithstanding, how much real power did he
have within his own party? That is the ultimate dilemma of Watts and
black conservatives. Black voters will continue to reject their
Republican pitch, and the GOP will continue to reject them as equal
partners in power. Watts realized this, and he did the only thing he
could do: He left.</TE>

<HD>Caltrans' Mono Mistake</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Californians fought for years to keep the Los Angeles Department of
Water and Power from draining strange and spectacular Mono Lake. They
shouldn't have to go to war again to save a small but critical slice
of Mono's shore from another public agency, Caltrans.</LD>
<LD>   This is another story of how a good idea got wished into a really
bad one. Since 1992, people living in the Eastern Sierra have sought
to get the California Department of Transportation to straighten one
unsafe curve on U.S. 395 alongside Mono Lake, just north of the town
of Lee Vining. They were hoping for a scenic turnout, a bicycle lane
and a better turnoff to a local road.</LD>
<LD>   Somehow that request has bloated into a $13-million project to
widen and straighten 2.9 miles of U.S. 395 and add 8-foot-wide
shoulders. There still would be only two lanes. The project would
boost the safe speed slightly, from 53 mph to 62 mph, even though the
accident rate is relatively low and southbound drivers don't need
more speed as they approach the town.</LD>
<TE>   Here's the kicker: The road now runs as close as 250 feet to the
lake's fragile shore, and as the water is gradually restored to its
historical level of 6,392 feet above sea level it will come within
100 feet of even the existing highway.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed project would move the highway into wetlands
adjoining the shoreline. Caltrans claims it would wipe out only 1.5
acres, a figure that scientists call laughably low, according to the
Mono Lake Committee. Whatever the figure, the state has a
long-standing order to restore wetlands to make up for what was lost
over the years as Los Angeles sucked dry the streams feeding the
lake.</TE>
<TE>   The regional water quality control board opposes the widening, and
the U.S. Forest Service, the state Department of Fish and Game and
other agencies have raised concerns.</TE>
<TE>   If there's not an urgent safety problem and motorists wouldn't
gain much in terms of safe speed, what's the point?</TE>
<TE>   With jagged Sierra peaks on one side and sweeping high chaparral
on the other, this stretch of U.S. 395 is one of the most beautiful
drives in the state. It cuts through the Mono Basin National Forest
Scenic Area, created to protect the area's natural resources. So the
project seems to be in blatant violation of Caltrans' own new policy
of "context-sensitive solutions," which pledges to balance
transportation goals with community, aesthetic, historical and
environmental values.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans will complete a draft environmental impact report before
it settles on a design. The notion of any overgrown project should be
rejected. Then Caltrans could get back to doing the small job that
the people of Mono County asked for in 1992.</TE>

<LD>The vast fields sit there like time itself, stretching from county to
county and state to state from the Great Lakes clear and flat to the
Rockies. This is the expanse many Americans sleep, read or watch
movies over while transiting six miles above. Occasionally, pockets
of lights glow below--small towns that, according to emerging census
data, are getting even smaller as farms get bigger.</LD>
<LD>   The fields, enriched by topsoil sometimes more than 50 feet thick
that was delivered by glaciers thousands of years ago, are doing
fine. But as chronicled by The Times' Stephanie Simon recently, the
communities every few miles that once served the farm families are
troubled. For many towns the brightest light is a Coke machine, with
groceries, clinics, stores, even schools closing as the population,
especially the young, seeks opportunities elsewhere. The problem
isn't new, just worse.</LD>
<LD>   This is the downside of our restless, disposable society: The
rural heartland that produced so many people, inventions, products,
stories and values for elsewhere gets hollowed out by economic and
social forces beyond its ken.</LD>
<TE>   America's coastal millions need not pine for small-town life to
sense the pain.</TE>
<TE>   Federal crop subsidy programs have long funneled funds to farmers
to ensure viable food production; growers' billion-dollar exports
also help the country's balance of payments.</TE>
<TE>   Now, after Congress has spent huge sums on urban restorations,
Sens. Charles Hagel (R-Neb.) and Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.), themselves
transplanted products of small towns, are proposing a 21st century
Homestead Act to reverse the rural drain.</TE>
<TE>   In terms of reproducing economically vibrant small towns and
family farms, even local residents don't foresee success. But there
could be useful progress in providing tax breaks for business
investments and forgiving student loans for college graduates who
move back to provide health care, for instance. Getting this through
legislatures dominated by far more populous urban and suburban areas
is a tough row to hoe, however.</TE>
<TE>   Still, with today's technology--computers, e-mail, faxes, 800
numbers--many companies do find a ready, diligent, appreciative and
cheaper labor pool in the countryside for data processing and
order-taking.</TE>
<TE>   Midwestern farm fields bake in the humid midsummer sun these days,
awaiting the next thundershower. Listening closely, you can hear the
gentle hum of natural activity as the bees, birds, insects and
microbes do their wondrous work developing the next crops of corn,
soybeans, wheat, sunflowers and more in the world's most productive
farm region. It's the nearby towns that have become quiet.</TE>

<LD>The number of U.S. troops involved in U.N. peacekeeping operations
around the world is small, but American influence on such missions is
not, because of the U.S. veto in the Security Council. Valid concerns
about the newly formed International Criminal Court are being blown
out of proportion, and the result is a threat to peacekeeping as an
institution.</LD>
<LD>   Several dozen U.S. police officers helped the fledgling nation of
East Timor build a law enforcement infrastructure; 46 U.S. police
officers are training recruits in Bosnia. Far more U.S. soldiers are
part of NATO commands: 2,500 in Bosnia, 5,800 in Kosovo.</LD>
<LD>   But rather than declining to take part in U.N. missions for fear
that U.S. soldiers would get hauled before the new international
court, Washington appears willing to block the operations completely
by using its Security Council veto. Last week the U.S. vetoed an
extension of the U.N. mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It later
relented and began discussing a compromise; a new deadline is next
Monday.</LD>
<TE>   The U.N. peacekeeping missions occasionally have had problems with
soldiers attacking the civilians they were meant to protect--or, as
with Dutch troops in Bosnia in 1995, not being forceful enough; in
the Dutch troops' case, the result was the Serbian massacre of
thousands of Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   But those are aberrations. U.N. forces' record in separating
combatants in places such as East Timor and Kosovo is good. Leaving
battling factions to sort matters out themselves would vastly
increase the bloodshed in most cases.</TE>
<TE>   President Clinton signed the treaty establishing the International
Criminal Court but did not submit it to the U.S. Senate for
ratification, knowing it would not pass. Many in Congress are
concerned that the court, designed as a permanent institution to
prosecute war crimes like those in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda,
would usurp U.S. sovereignty. Now the Bush administration has
declared Clinton's signature void.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, as the sole superpower, does have enemies that
object to its political, military and cultural influence. There is a
danger of politically motivated attempts to prosecute U.S. forces
trying to keep the peace in such countries as Ethiopia and Bosnia.
But the court is supposed to take action only if a country refuses to
inaugurate proceedings against its own nationals, and then only after
delaying proceedings for a year. That's enough time to bring home,
and thus shield, anyone facing what the U.S. sees as a false charge.</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, the Bush administration received deserved
criticism for its tendency to go it alone; afterward, it discovered
the value of allies. But its frontal assault on the International
Criminal Court needlessly provokes friends, including Britain, France
and Germany. Washington's objections to the court do not entitle it
to attack an effective peacekeeping institution that other nations
value.</TE>

<LD>Re "State Mental Facility Probed" (July 3), on the U.S. Department of
Justice launching an investigation into alleged civil rights abuses
at the Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk: Civil rights abuses in
a mental hospital? That shouldn't be news. With its unwavering
support of AB 1421 (I believe you even won a Pulitzer Prize for it),
The Times has been a vigorous champion of violating the civil rights
of the mentally ill.</LD>
<LD>   Oh, of course it's justified. The mentally ill are a different
sort of animal, too sick to know what's good for them, right? Never
mind the study that found the mentally ill just as capable as the
physically ill at making valid treatment decisions. With the
prevailing attitude of psychiatry toward the mentally ill, it is no
surprise that a mental hospital resorts to drugs and restraints.</LD>

<HD>Assembly Passes Bill on Phone Regulation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You are right in calling AB 2958 a shameful outrage, but you glossed
over another disturbing fact ("Pull In Phone Monopoly... ,"
editorial, July 1). When it came time for the Assembly to vote, only
one member, Rod Pacheco (R-Riverside), wondered about the validity of
a bill that is backed by SBC Communications--which, we found,
underreported its net income by $2 billion between 1997 and 1999
alone (that translates to $350 million due to customers under
profit-sharing)--and is opposed by numerous consumer groups
throughout the state.</LD>
<LD>   My office has opposed the bill because we think it is too
expensive for telephone customers in this state to lose regulatory
protection for essential services. But what also worries me is a lack
of common sense and willingness to take a closer look at who will be
helped or hurt by this proposed legislation.</LD>
<LD>   Regina A. Birdsell</LD>
<TE>   Director, Office of Ratepayer</TE>
<TE>   Advocates, Calif. Public Utilities</TE>
<TE>   Commission, San Francisco</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Re your editorial: Consumers are not exposed by this bill to any
rate-gouging because the text of the bill states: "In regulating
telephone corporations under this section, the commission shall
maintain its authority to regulate prices for all services subject to
its jurisdiction and shall continue to have authority to move service
between all pricing categories." This refutes any suggestion that the
consumer would face any exposure to rate increases, unless the
California PUC raised rates.</TE>
<TE>   AB 2958 actually codifies a decision by the PUC in October 1998 in
which commissioners, not the Legislature, voted to suspend both
profit-sharing and the price adjustment formula, because they
concluded, as have more than 35 other states, that they were
counterproductive.</TE>
<TE>   The chosen method to reconcile costs with rates is to lower the
rates. This is the way previous commissioners have dealt with this
matter, resulting in Californians having among the lowest basic
telephone rates in the country.</TE>
<TE>   AB 2958 would preserve the system that has served California well
during the last 10 years. During the time this system has been in
place, consumers have been the beneficiaries of a roll-out of new
services, which have in fact added to the profit of Pacific Bell.</TE>
<TE>   This was the agreement; it would have the opportunity to earn more
if it provided more. The safeguard from its earning too much is the
ability of the PUC to lower the rates.</TE>
<TE>   The Chamber of Commerce, the Urban League, the Manufacturers Assn.
and the California Small Business Assn., which all use telephones and
pay for service, have endorsed AB 2958. Why? Because most people
would rather have the certainty of lower rates and newer features,
thus keeping their money in their pockets.</TE>
<TE>   AB 2958 will give California consumers the assurance that they
will continue to have high-quality service at just and reasonable
rates.</TE>

<HD>Bush Stock Sale: Late Filing Not the Only Issue</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Bush Filing Given a New Explanation" and "A Small Matter, but
Bush's Responsibility, Experts Say," July 4: It seems to me that your
articles on President Bush's stock trading in Harken Energy Corp.
missed the point. While you focus on the lighter issue of his
Securities and Exchange Commission filings, the issue of insider
trading is almost ignored. The SEC said it did not appear that Bush
was trading on inside information. Yet he sold two-thirds of his
holdings shortly before a negative announcement was made public. He
would certainly have known the negative information as a member of
Harken's board of directors.</LD>
<LD>   I would like to see some reporting on this investigation of a man
whose father, as president, was in charge of the investigators.</LD>
<LD>   Dan Jordan</LD>
<TE>   Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I see much discussion in the press on Bush's 1990 failure, until
eight months later, to file the second disclosure form on his highly
profitable, large sale of Harken stock. However, I am more concerned
about Bush's sale of a large volume of the stock just eight days
before the company, on whose board of directors he then served,
released information on extremely large recent losses. When the
information was made public, the stock lost more than one-third of
its value in one day and most of its remaining value within a few
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   I am troubled by this question: Was Bush ignorant of the key
affairs of the company on whose board he served, or was he aware of
the extremely damaging information and chose to sell the stock
because of it? If he did the latter, it was a clear case of insider
trading.</TE>

<TE>   I couldn't believe the quote from Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, about the Bush administration giving
the green light to unscrupulous chief executives. The audacity of his
remarks is mind-boggling.</TE>
<TE>   This from the man who played loose and cozy with the Clinton
administration for years and who, during that time, managed to turn a
reported $100,000 investment in Global Crossing into more than $17
million. And he wants us to believe he did this with no insider
information? He obviously feels he can get away with the attack
because he gets a free pass from the media on his "lucky" investment.</TE>

<TE>   Bush sold $850,000 worth of shares in an energy company of which
he was a director, thus avoiding a $600,000 loss when the shares
plummeted. Then he failed to file the required notice with the SEC
that would have signaled to the world that a director had dumped most
of his shares. Then he wrongly claimed that the notice was correctly
filed and the SEC lost it. Then he incorrectly claimed that it was
the company's, not his, responsibility to file the notice.</TE>

budget to investigate this one?</TE>

<LD>I read Aslam Abdullah's July 3 commentary, "I Will Pray for America's
Safety," and I have to say this is by far the first time I have read
such a strong, positive column written by a Muslim man. I am an Arab
Muslim woman who immigrated to the U.S. 12 years ago. I was on a
journey to escape from the oppression and persecution my native land
imposed on all citizens, especially women.</LD>
<LD>   Aslam, you are my brother, and I will be standing by you, praying
every day to protect this great country and its generous people, who
not only allowed but welcomed me to be one of them and to enjoy their
freedom and land. Let's come together to change the horrifying mask
that these morally and mentally corrupted terrorists have put on us.
We need to remove this mask and show America our true face.</LD>

<LD>Civilized people do not shoot wildly into the air when celebrating a
happy occasion ("U.S. Raid on Village Raises Hard Questions," July
5). When people of a war-torn country--occupied by foreign
forces--celebrate a happy occasion they should be doubly cautious.
Our troops are not out to shoot women and children. They are trained
to shoot at anyone who shoots at them first. This is war. The people
who were celebrating are responsible. They jeopardized their people's
as well as our troops' safety.</LD>

<HD>Airport: Install the Checkpoints at Terminal Doors</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>July 4's shooting incident tells us we are not as secure as we think
we are or are told we are. I believe that the ticket and check-in
counters must be behind security checks and barriers.</LD>
<LD>   Passengers checking in would be screened from the entrance onward.
No visitors beyond the entrance unless checked through security.
Rules for carry-ons must be strictly enforced. Airline personnel must
enforce these rules. It is about time that everyone plays the game
and stops being selfish.</LD>
<LD>   David Peters</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After July 4's shooting in the L.A. airport, it would appear that
all the security in the universe can't keep the terrorist kooks from
carrying out their dastardly deeds. I don't think we can point the
finger of blame at the officials on duty for letting that gunman slip
through the cracks. They did their job as well as could have been
expected. However, no amount of efficiency in quelling a worse
tragedy will comfort those who have lost their loved ones.</TE>
<TE>   It would seem that putting the security checkpoint at every door
in the building would make it easier to at least keep would-be gunmen
out of the terminal. It might not make it any harder for prospective
terrorists to find their targets, but at least hundreds of people
inside wouldn't have to be herded in panic out of the building.</TE>
<TE>   Although the jury is still out on the motive for the shooting at
the El Al counter, in view of the explosive situation between the
extremist Muslim Arabs and the Jews, I don't doubt there was a reason
for shooting people at that particular ticket counter.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it will cost a lot to install that many more checkpoints, but
wouldn't it be worth it to cut down on the disruption for the flying
public? The terrorists are going to find every loophole, but we can
be just as innovative as they.</TE>

<TE>   An Arab man waits in a check-in line for El Al Airlines, he has no

ammunition. Suddenly he fires and kills two people. Our government
does not see this as terrorism? Give me a break.</TE>

<LD>Re "Wal-Mart Tightens Gun Policy," July 3: If the federal three-day
waiting period is intended to prevent individuals who are a danger to
themselves or others from owning a gun, then it is reasonable that an
incomplete or inconclusive background check should preclude someone
from purchasing a gun until it is determined the individual meets all
requirements.</LD>
<LD>   Thank you to the executives at Wal-Mart Stores for recognizing a
potentially lethal loophole in our federal gun law and adopting a
sensible resolution. It is in the best interest of
everyone--including the NRA and gun-rights advocates--that guns get
into the hands of those who intend to use them responsibly.</LD>

<LD>Richard Deight thinks recycling is not a moral obligation for
Americans (letter, July 3). I could not disagree more. As we
Americans throw away obsolete computers, TVs and other electronic
appliances we are pouring tons of toxic electronic waste into
landfills and/or exporting it to developing countries where workers
earn $1.50 per day for dismantling and processing the materials--with
no environmental safeguards.</LD>
<LD>   Consumer electronics already constitute 40% to 70% of heavy
metals, including mercury and cadmium, found in landfills, putting
ground water at risk of toxic pollution. We do have a moral
obligation to recycle.</LD>

<HD>Sid Avery, 83; Photographed Brando, Bogart, Taylor, Other
Stars of 1950s, '60s</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He focused his lens on a grinning Marlon Brando enjoying toast and
coffee at the breakfast table and later captured the brooding actor
posing with his bongo drums in a corner of his living room.</LD>
<LD>   He shot a glistening Rock Hudson, fresh from the shower with a
towel wrapped around his waist, talking on the phone.</LD>
<LD>   And he captured Elizabeth Taylor sitting in a folding chair on
location in Texas for "Giant," eyes closed and face sensuously tilted
upward as she caught some sun.</LD>
<TE>   Sid Avery, a celebrity photographer in the 1950s and '60s, whose
signature pictures depicting the "everyday" lives of Hollywood stars
appeared in the Saturday Evening Post, Life, Look and other national
magazines, died of cancer July 1 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in
Los Angeles. He was 83.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Avery came out of retirement to shoot the star-studded
cast of the remake of "Ocean's Eleven." After all, he shot Frank
Sinatra and Sinatra's Rat Pack pals during the making of the original
film.</TE>
<TE>   "He really was the iconic Hollywood photographer of the '50s and
'60s," said David Barenholtz, owner of Apex Fine Art, the Los Angeles
gallery that represents Avery's work.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people may not know his name," Barenholtz said, "but
everyone knows that picture of Rock Hudson in the towel and Marlon
Brando with bongos between his legs."</TE>
<TE>   Avery's images of Hollywood stars are 40 to 50 years old,
Barenholtz said, but they have lost none of their allure.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people love them even more today, because they captured
an era that just doesn't exist anymore," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Barenholtz said Avery's shots of celebrities "in more everyday
kinds of scenes" served as a transition from the staged glamour
portraits that appeared during Hollywood's Golden Age in the 1930s
and '40s.</TE>
<TE>   "The type of photographs that Sid took were much more intimate,"
he said. "They were more about the personality of the star. He went
into their homes. He befriended them."</TE>
<TE>   Avery's 1990 book, "Hollywood at Home: A Family Album 1950-1965,"
illustrated his approach to celebrity photo shoots, which did their
part to create a Hollywood star mythology suitable for the
family-friendly Eisenhower era.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time we read no intimations of tragedy, or even the
possibility of future disappointments, into any of these images,"
Time magazine movie critic Richard Schickel wrote in an essay for
Avery's book. "Our tendency in those days was to regard such thoughts
as unworthy of us. For, like these favored show folk, the rest of us
ordinary citizens of the American 1950s were busy miming normalcy
too."</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a wonderful time," Avery told Biography magazine two
years ago. "The relationship between photographer and stars wasn't
adversarial, like it is today. You could develop friendships with
some of the stars."</TE>
<TE>   Avery considered Nat "King" Cole, Ernest Borgnine, Humphrey Bogart
and Lauren Bacall his friends, but the open and friendly photographer
didn't get along with all of his celebrity subjects.</TE>
<TE>   Bing Crosby was "very difficult," he told Biography. "He could
have hired you to be there, but he still wouldn't cooperate."</TE>
<TE>   Even Bogart initially resisted inviting Avery into his home.</TE>
<TE>   "He turned me down from every angle," Avery told the Chicago
Tribune in 1991. "He said he'd just moved into a new house [and] his
wife [Lauren Bacall] was pregnant. I finally told him that, if he
gave me five or 10 minutes, he could get me out of his hair. I didn't
tell him the name of the article was going to be 'The Star Who Hates
Hollywood.' He said, 'OK, kid, come on over at 8 o'clock.' "</TE>
<TE>   When Avery showed up that morning, the first thing Bogart did was
offer him a drink. And instead of five or 10 minutes, the photo shoot
lasted two hours, as Bogart quickly softened to the idea of having
Avery and the camera invade his home.</TE>
<TE>   The session produced a memorable shot of Bogart sitting on the
floor in front of the fireplace, looking at a book with his young
son. It was a scene of domestic bliss, complete with a seated Bacall
gazing down at her husband and son and three large, sleeping boxers
stretched out at her feet.</TE>
<TE>   "The karma was right," Avery said.</TE>
<TE>   Bogart enjoyed Avery's company so much that he not only invited
the photographer to go sailing with him that afternoon, but he also
asked Avery to join him for dinner at Romanoff's that evening.</TE>
<TE>   Avery experienced a similarly growing willingness to let him shoot
when he showed up at the home of the publicity-shy Brando.</TE>
<TE>   "We related very well, and he started to take an interest in what
I was doing," Avery recalled in an interview on "CBS This Morning."</TE>
<TE>   "I finally got to the point where I said, 'I'd like to take a
picture of you in the kitchen, but your kitchen is so dirty.' It was
up to your chest in old bags and paper cartons and a lot of other
things. I don't think he'd ever cleaned it, and I hinted, if you'd
just clean up your act a little bit, then we could take pictures."</TE>
<TE>   The result: shots of one of Hollywood's biggest stars taking out
his trash.</TE>
<TE>   One of six children, Avery was born in Akron, Ohio, but moved to
Los Angeles with his family when he was about a year old.</TE>
<TE>   His infatuation with photography began at age 7 when his uncle, a
landscape and architectural photographer, took him into his darkroom.
"He put a piece of paper in a tray and suddenly, magically, an image
appeared," Avery told the Chicago Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   While a teenager, he found a discarded camera in a trash can. He
began experimenting with it after cleaning it up.</TE>
<TE>   At Roosevelt High School in Los Angeles, Avery was yearbook
photographer and swept the camera club's awards.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating in 1937, he studied photography at a trade school
and worked as a darkroom assistant at a camera store while attending
art school.</TE>
<TE>   By 1938, he was shooting celebrities in nightclubs for Silver
Screen, Photoplay and other fan magazines. And in 1939 he opened a
studio specializing in portraiture, photojournalism and publicity
photographs.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, Avery served in the Army Signal Corps and was
stationed in London, where he helped establish the Army Pictorial
Service laboratory, the processing facility for all combat still and
motion picture footage from the European theater of operations.</TE>
<TE>   Avery was commissioned a lieutenant before the Normandy invasion
and helped establish a second division of the Army Pictorial Service
in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he returned to Hollywood and took on commercial
assignments as well as doing his celebrity shoots.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1960s he switched to advertising photography and,
later that decade, opened a successful television commercial
production company.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Avery founded the nonprofit Hollywood Photographers
Archive to preserve, document and exhibit the work of notable
photographers.</TE>
<TE>   It later evolved into a for-profit stock house, the Motion Picture
and Television Photo Archive, which represents the work of dozens of
photographers and has more than 1 million historic Hollywood images
on file.</TE>
<TE>   Avery is survived by his wife, Diana, of Sherman Oaks; three
children, Sandra Guttman of Valencia, Marc Avery of Sedona, Ariz.,
and Ron Avery of Winnetka; and three grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made in
Avery's name to the Cancer Research Society.</TE>

<HD>State Deficit Forces Delicate Balancing Act</HD>
<DH>Finance: County, its cities and schools are worried more
about the future, especially in education.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state's budget deficit--$23.6 billion at last count--is forcing
many school districts to slash spending and raid their reserves in an
effort to save classroom programs. "It is not as though we are
running out of yellow pads and pencils," said Paul Burkart, assistant
superintendent of fiscal administration for Anaheim City School
District. "But we may have to postpone that computer upgrade we were
planning on."</LD>
<LD>   California began the fiscal year July 1 without a spending plan
after the Senate's proposal failed in the Assembly. While cities and
counties are feeling the pinch, many schools are in a real bind.
State officials say public education will receive at best about $47
billion, a $4-billion increase from last year that barely covers cost
increases.</LD>
<LD>   Among Orange County districts, Irvine Unified has grappled with
some of the most painful choices, with officials saying earlier this
year that they might have to eliminate class-size reduction programs
and science and art classes.</LD>
<TE>   Parents and local businesses raised more than $2 million to save
some of those programs, but the district anticipates a $5.2-million
shortfall this fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing we enjoy is a very supportive community," said Vernon
Medeiros, the district's deputy superintendent and chief financial
officer. But the 24,000-student district with an annual budget of
more than $150 million does not want to depend on donations to stay
afloat, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Unified laid off nine employees, including teachers and
nurses, in May and is still in salary negotiations with its teachers
union. The outcome of those talks could affect the final budget.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the district is saving money by combining some
administrative duties. Alderwood and Eastshore elementary schools
will share a principal, as will Deerfield and Westwood, but "we are
running out of options," Medeiros said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, officials throughout Orange County were worried
about the budget crunch, which has been blamed on a sluggish economy
that has dramatically cut revenue. Laguna Woods, Rancho Santa
Margarita and Aliso Viejo--the county's three newest cities--feared
the governor would take back vehicle license fees that have made up
30% to 60% of their budgets.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been a huge hit if they lost that," said Michael
Gold, deputy director of the Orange County division of the League of
California Cities. "There was some serious talk that, if they didn't
get it, they might have to disincorporate."</TE>
<TE>   State lawmakers decided to raise vehicle registration fees instead
of pulling the money from cities.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim was hurt when tourists stopped flocking to Disneyland and
conventions after Sept. 11. But the tourists have returned, and city
officials say their $1.07-billion budget will enable them to maintain
services at current levels. They are confident enough to transfer $10
million from city reserves to a capital improvement plan that
includes new parks and gymnasiums.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's $4.9-billion budget includes cuts of $57 million
across most departments and a hiring freeze. Much of the cuts are in
state money that pays for welfare-to-work programs, day care, job
retraining and transportation for thousands of low-income residents.
The county's budget is up 4% over last year, but county officials
said most of that increase is due to rising costs of employee
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   County officials are awaiting the final state budget to see how
closely it matches the May revisions. If the county's budget is far
off, it will be revised in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Legislature has yet to pass a state budget, the
county, its cities and school districts generally know what their
budget pictures are for fiscal 2002-03. They are worried more about
the future, especially in education.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a high-wire balancing act," said Burkart of Anaheim city
schools. "You try to stay the course, but there are a lot of bumps on
the wire."</TE>
<TE>   Some districts are dipping into their reserves. Orange Unified,
for example, will use more than $8 million of its $20.6-million
reserve fund to meet its 2002-03 budget of $230 million. Capistrano
Unified, which, like Irvine, is in contract talks with teachers, will
take $3.8 million from reserves to balance its $305-million budget.</TE>
<TE>   Centralia School District, a 5,500-student district in north
Orange County, will use half of its reserve funds this fiscal year,
leaving it a cushion of about $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Unified, the county's largest district, will be able to
meet its fiscal obligations with a $420-million annual budget, said
Don Stabler, associate superintendent of business services. But there
is little wiggle room. The district, which has 62,000 students,
typically sets aside $2 million to $7 million a year for unforeseen
costs, Stabler said. This year the amount is only $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be able to fund all our commitments," Stabler said, "but
that's about it."</TE>

<HD>'Dr. Sewage' Pushes Water Treatment</HD>
<DH>Profile: After 20 years of activism, the Huntington Beach
doctor has it down to a science. His latest foe: the O.C. Sanitation
District and its waiver.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Activist Jan Vandersloot could never be mistaken for an in-your-face
radical. The Huntington Beach physician is soft-spoken, obeys the law
and abides by the theory that change comes from within, even if it's
slow.</LD>
<LD>   And slowly, steadily, the 57-year-old dermatologist has
fought--often successfully--for preservation of the Bolsa Chica and
Little Shell wetlands along Orange County's coast and campaigned for
water quality projects. Now, he is taking on one of Southern
California's largest sanitation agencies to force it to stop pumping
partially treated waste water into the ocean.</LD>
<LD>   The latest fight has taken Vandersloot out of his office and into
the halls of power in Sacramento, where he testified in favor of
legislation to force the Orange County Sanitation District to abide
by the federal Clean Water Act and fully treat the waste water it
pumps four miles off Huntington Beach.</LD>
<TE>   The sanitation district, meanwhile, is considering whether to seek
renewal of a federal waiver that allows it to dump 243 million
gallons of partially treated sewage per day.</TE>
<TE>   "They call me Dr. Sewage," said Vandersloot, who was born in New
Jersey, went to Cornell University, then the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical School at Dallas before heading farther West.</TE>
<TE>   He has formed the Ocean Outfall Group, a loose-knit organization
that holds no meetings, collects no dues and elects no officers. It
survives on its e-mail list, which has evolved into a "Who's Who" of
Orange County environmental activism and now numbers about 250
people.</TE>
<TE>   The group relies on about 20 core activists who turn up at public
meetings, urging water districts and city councils to help end the
waiver.</TE>
<TE>   Public meetings, not chaining oneself to a developer's bulldozer,
are Vandersloot's staple. And he's been to plenty of them over the
last several years, when the subject was the sanitation district's
waiver, which would expire next year. The 25-member sanitation
board's next hearing on whether to seek renewal of its waiver is July
17.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the Huntington Beach shore has been plagued by
high bacteria counts. A $5-million sanitation district study released
two months ago did not find a definitive source for the bacteria but
could not rule out the blend of fully and partially treated waste
water the district pumps offshore.</TE>
<TE>   Activists are demanding that the district fully treat all the
waste water it discharges into the ocean, as do most of the nation's
16,000 sanitation districts.</TE>
<TE>   But treating all of its outflow to the highest levels--by using
microorganisms to eliminate bacteria and viruses--would cost $250
million, said Robert P. Ghirelli, director of technical services for
the sanitation district.</TE>
<TE>   That averages an additional $16 annually per household for 20
years.</TE>
<TE>   The district treats waste from more than 2 million people and is
the nation's largest sanitation district operating with a waiver.
While sanitation district officials say they admire Vandersloot's
passion, two said he used faulty statistics at a board meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Top sanitation district officials, including General Manager Blake
Anderson, declined to comment on Vandersloot's activism, saying they
did not want to further polarize opposing sides.</TE>
<TE>   Because the issue stirs passions, security has been stepped up at
the board meetings, with police outside and private security guards
inside.</TE>
<TE>   Vandersloot and other activists have had to wage their battle
using the only means available for private parties in public
meetings--the public-comment period.</TE>
<TE>   That has meant attending two or more meetings a week, sometimes
waiting until late in the session to have their say, and usually for
no more than three minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Organized and quotable, Vandersloot and members of his Ocean
Outfall Group frequently pop up in newspaper articles, which has
caught the attention of Assemblyman Ken Maddox (R-Garden Grove) and
his staff.</TE>
<TE>   This year, when Maddox introduced AB 1969, which would force the
sanitation district to fully treat its waste water before pumping it
into the ocean, he invited Vandersloot to testify in favor of the
bill in April.</TE>
<TE>   The doctor was the dream lobbyist, Maddox's staff said. Not only
was he early and organized in his presentation, but after the hearing
he went door to door talking with legislators.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, which is opposed by Anderson, the sanitation district's
general manager, cleared the Assembly and is in the Senate's
Appropriations Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Reeder, Maddox's chief of staff, said Vandersloot's
persuasive style has succeeded where other outspoken advocates did
not.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't bring a lot of credibility when I or any other Republican
says, 'Hey, I've got a great environmental bill,' " Reeder said. "But
a guy with Vandersloot's credentials walks in and it's a different
reaction.</TE>
<TE>   "They love it and eat it up."</TE>
<TE>   Added Maddox: "I have seen activists here and they don't have a
good understanding of how the Capitol operates. When you get up and
testify, you have to be concise and precise. Jan is able to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Vandersloot admits that fighting the good fight is getting old.
After 20 years of activism, he doesn't enjoy the long meetings, the
tired feet and having to listen to long-winded speeches.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to be with my wife and kids. I don't like the fight,
though people think I do. I made an informal agreement with my wife,
Cheryl, that there won't be more than two meetings a week. Ha! I've
been married 22 years and so far she's put up with my activism."</TE>
<TE>   Usually, when Vandersloot speaks at meetings, he is followed by a
sanitation district employee or administrator with an opposing
opinion. So far, eight city councils and one water district have
approved "Stop the Waiver" resolutions, including Huntington Beach,
which has had numerous shoreline closures because of high bacteria
levels.</TE>
<TE>   "Speaking at all the meetings, I guess, is paying off," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos became the most recent city to pass a resolution
opposing a waiver, said City Councilwoman Alice B. Jempsa.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council's decision is not binding, but activists are
trying to persuade at least 13 cities with seats on the sanitation
district board to vote against renewing the waiver.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something that's really going to have an impact on the
future of our county. Water quality has become such an important
issue," said Jempsa, who is her city's representative on the
sanitation board and intends to vote against a waiver renewal.</TE>
<TE>   "The activists have plenty to offer, even if it's their
emotionalism, and Dr. Vandersloot is so respected that you can't help
but recognize they've put hours and hours into this with no pay."</TE>

<TE>   Vandersloot admits that fighting the good fight is getting old.
After 20 years of activism, he really doesn't enjoy the long
meetings, the tired feet and having to listen to long-winded
speeches.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to be with my wife and kids. I don't like the fight,
though people think I do. I made an informal agreement with my wife,
Cheryl, that there won't be more than two meetings a week. Ha! I've
been married 22 years and so far she's put up with my activism."</TE>
<TE>   Usually, when Vandersloot speaks at meetings, he is followed by a
sanitation district employee or administrator with an opposing
opinion. So far, eight city councils and one water district have
approved "Stop the Waiver" resolutions, including Huntington Beach,
which has had numerous shoreline closures because of high bacteria
levels.</TE>
<TE>   "Speaking at all the meetings, I guess, is paying off," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos became the most recent city to pass a resolution
opposing a waiver, said City Councilwoman Alice B. Jempsa. Alone, the
City Council's decision is not binding. But the activists are trying
to persuade at least 13 cities with seats on the sanitation district
board to vote against renewing the waiver.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something that's really going to have an impact on the
future of our county. Water quality has become such an important
issue," said Jempsa, who is her city's representative on the
sanitation board and intends to vote against a waiver renewal. "The
activists have plenty to offer, even if it's their emotionalism, and
Dr. Vandersloot is so respected that you can't help but recognize
they've put hours and hours in this with no pay."</TE>
<TE>   Vandersloot emphasizes that he is just one of many coastal
activists, including Doug Korthof, Joey Racano, Garry Brown and Larry
Porter. They represent a contingent of the Ocean Outfall Group,
Orange County Coast Keeper, Sierra Club, Surfrider Foundation and
others.</TE>
<TE>   Racano acknowledges that his style clashes with Vandersloot's. But
Racano, who wears a jacket crowded with activist buttons and has
picketed the sanitation district every morning for a year, says he
understands that Vandersloot "has a role to play."</TE>
<TE>   "My style is a little radical for some," Racano said. "It takes
people like the doctor to reach people who are more centrist."</TE>

<HD>Oxnard School Board OKs Added Funds for Travel</HD>
<DH>Education: Trustees approve a 39% increase, citing their
need to attend conferences. Critics say the district has more
pressing priorities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oxnard Union High School District board members, who have been at
odds over travel spending in the past, have approved a 39% increase
in their travel budgets.</LD>
<LD>   On a 3-2 vote, with trustees Nancy Koch and Irene Pinkard
dissenting, the board last month increased each member's yearly
travel budget from $3,760 to $5,250. The money is used to attend
professional development conferences.</LD>
<LD>   The boost comes as many California school districts are struggling
to make ends meet in the face of multimillion-dollar deficits.
Although the Oxnard trustees passed a balanced $101-million budget
for the coming year, they used $2.7 million in reserve funds.</LD>
<TE>   "Our school district and many throughout the state are facing
pretty hard economic times," said Koch, who has been a critic of the
board's travel spending since she first raised the issue in a public
meeting a year and a half ago. "My opinion is, when you're facing
deficit spending, you look for places to cut and not places to
increase."</TE>
<TE>   But Oxnard Supt. Gary Davis disputed the characterization that the
$2.7-million transfer constitutes "deficit spending." He said the
money came from a $5.7-million savings fund that the district has
built up over the years in anticipation of increased costs that would
come with the opening last fall of Pacifica High School.</TE>
<TE>   That reserve account is separate from the $3-million rainy-day
fund that state officials urge districts to keep, Davis said. He
added that the district did not make any major cuts in staff or
programs this year and that the board gave teachers a 6.47%
raise--the largest in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   "Travel to educational workshops and conventions is an excellent
way for board members to stay abreast of new programs," Davis said.
"The difference is $7,450. That's very minimal out of a $101-million
budget."</TE>
<TE>   The increase brings the board's total travel budget to $26,250. In
comparison, board travel budgets in the Conejo Valley and Ventura
unified school districts--both of which serve more students than
Oxnard Union--are less than $12,000 annually.</TE>
<TE>   Koch said there are too many unmet needs in the district for board
members to increase their expense accounts. For example, she said,
the district's four older high schools need drinking fountains on
sports fields to keep students hydrated during physical education
classes, at a cost of $5,000 per fountain.</TE>
<TE>   If the board capped travel spending at $2,000 per member, which is
what Koch proposed, that would save more than $16,000--enough for
three drinking fountains, she said.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2001, Koch publicly criticized the board for what she
called excessive travel spending on business trips that were not
authorized by the panel, as its bylaws require. Her report triggered
an investigation by the district attorney's office, which did not
file any charges. After that, all board members turned in their
district-owned credit cards and now get trips pre-approved by the
board.</TE>
<TE>   The increase was the second the board approved since it budgeted
$2,560 per trustee last summer. When Pinkard asked for an additional
$1,200 to attend a national conference earlier this year, the board
approved the increase for everyone on the board.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he stands by his support of the budget increase.</TE>
<TE>   "These are five people who have to make very serious decisions,"
he said. "I don't think it's excessive."</TE>

<HD>Police Program for At-Risk Youth Struggles to Survive
Funding Cut</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE STASSEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Reseda youth center that has served 5,000 children since its
inception is in danger of closing after losing $200,000 in state
funding.</LD>
<LD>   Although other Police Activity League Supporters programs in the
Los Angeles Police Department are stable, the West Valley PALS Youth
Center could shut down in three months if more money isn't found.</LD>
<LD>   The closure would affect kids ages 7 to 17 who come to the
storefront on Reseda Boulevard to box, shoot pool or play arcade
video games. The activities are supervised by a no-nonsense cop who
enforces the rules and provides guidance.</LD>
<TE>   "The center has a major impact on kids. There aren't a lot of
places like this where they can go for free," said LAPD Officer John
Mann, who staffs the center during its open hours: 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
weekdays in the summer and during school breaks, and from 2 to 7 p.m.
weekdays during the school year.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 community volunteers are struggling to keep it afloat.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to the mailbox today and picked up a whole bunch of bills.
I don't know where the money is going to come from," said
Marie-Michelle Hewett, president of West Valley PALS, which was
started in the early 1970s to give area youth a safe place to go
after school and during the summer. "I look at every bill and try to
trim everything to a bare minimum."</TE>
<TE>   Until the first installment of a new $24,600 grant from the Los
Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency is received in about two
weeks, the West Valley PALS bank account has only $400, Hewett said.
And the redevelopment agency money will cover expenses--about $5,000
a month, including $3,250 monthly for rent--for only a short time.</TE>
<TE>   The center regularly gives about 200 youths a safe place to hang
out.</TE>
<TE>   Jesus Macias, 12, said he walks there several times a week with
his 7-year-old brother and 14-year-old sister because, "I get to have
fun with my friends. If I didn't come here, I'd be lying around the
house or somewhere out in the street."</TE>
<TE>   Other kids at the center are involved in Jeopardy, another LAPD
program for youths considered "at risk" because of troubles at school
or home. One Jeopardy participant said he has been coming to the
center for seven months, since he got in trouble at his middle
school. He calls Mann his mentor.</TE>
<TE>   "He's cool. He helps set you straight. If I didn't come here, I
would be getting in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   If the center closes, the West Valley Division's Jeopardy program
would be affected too, said on-site supervising LAPD Officer Michael
Maldonado. Kids in Jeopardy who don't have supervised after-school
activities are required, as part of a contract between the LAPD and
their parents, to be at the center, under the watchful eyes of
Maldonado and Mann.</TE>
<TE>   Youngsters who have been in trouble with the law can be ordered by
a Juvenile Court judge to enroll in the Jeopardy program. Other
participants are referred by school counselors or parents concerned
the child is likely to get in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be devastating if the center closed," Maldonado said.
"Most of my kids have a single parent, and the mother doesn't have
anywhere to put them."</TE>
<TE>   "I was so happy about the grant. I'd put in for it and got it
approved," Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) said. "Then,
for the first time in the history of California, we had to go back
into the budget. This was one of many, many grants that were cut."</TE>
<TE>   Hertzberg said he "begged them [to restore the funding] because
this was an important need," but he was unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   Losing the state grant was like "having the rug pulled out from
under you," said Sgt. Cindy Brounsten, advisor to West Valley PALS.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been awake nights worrying about how we'll keep this place
open," she said. "We don't want kids on the streets with nothing to
do. Sometimes it leads to negative behavior, or they might become
victims. It's better for everybody that kids are in a program."</TE>
<TE>   For now, West Valley PALS will depend on a variety of
fund-raisers--from donation bins at a local Vons market to a
$5-a-plate spaghetti dinner--to get by as organizers hunt for a major
long-term donor. Los Angeles City Councilman Dennis Zine has
suggested exploring a move to a city-owned building, where rent would
be nominal.</TE>
<TE>   The Devonshire PALS center, located in a shopping center, pays
just $1 per year in rent. Most of the other seven PALS programs in
the LAPD operate out of recreation centers or schools, so their
overhead costs are minimal.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of finding funds for rent, let's look at ways to keep
them afloat," Zine said.</TE>

alternate sources of funding.</CP>

<HD>Bill Could End Impasse at Pictsweet</HD>
<DH>Unions: State legislation backed by UFW would require
arbitration in farm labor disputes. Talks at the Ventura plant have
stalled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Workers embroiled in a long-running contract dispute with owners of
Southern California's largest mushroom farm are pinning their hopes
on proposed legislation that could force a settlement in the
stalemate.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, written by state Senate leader John Burton (D-San
Francisco) and backed by the United Farm Workers union, would permit
binding, third-party arbitration in cases where farm labor
negotiations reach an impasse.</LD>
<LD>   That appears to be the case at the Pictsweet Mushroom Farm in
Ventura, where workers have been without a contract since 1987 and
talks in recent years between the company and the UFW have failed to
progress.</LD>
<TE>   The standoff has turned nasty at times. The UFW has accused the
company of bad-faith bargaining and violating other labor laws in a
flurry of charges filed with the state's farm labor board. An
opposition group has launched a campaign aimed at decertifying the
UFW, contending it no longer represents the will of the workers. And
the company has laid off workers in response to a union-led boycott
of Pictsweet products that has driven away some of its most valuable
customers.</TE>
<TE>   The state Senate passed the binding arbitration legislation in
May. The bill is now making its way through the Assembly, where 40
members--one short of the majority needed for passage--have pledged
support by signing on as co-authors.</TE>
<TE>   That puts it on track to reach Gov. Gray Davis' desk in coming
weeks, presenting what some say is a potential election-year dilemma
for the governor as he tries to balance the interests of organized
labor and California's farm industry.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor is going to have to demonstrate whether he is with
the people or with the corporations," said mushroom picker Jose Luis
Luna, who has worked at the Pictsweet plant for 21 years. He
testified before the Legislature earlier this year on the bill's
passage.</TE>
<TE>   "It is of monumental importance that this law go through," he
said. "The company has the economic strength to prolong this dispute
to try to wear us down."</TE>
<TE>   The bill has some detractors.</TE>
<TE>   Farm industry groups say no other private enterprise is required
to use binding arbitration to settle labor disputes. Only public
safety employees, such as police officers and firefighters who are
barred by law from striking during labor negotiations, have that
remedy available.</TE>
<TE>   Growers say the Agricultural Labor Relations Act, adopted by the
state Legislature in 1975 to referee farm labor disputes and oversee
union elections, has remedies in place for cases in which growers
refuse to negotiate fairly.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed legislation would amend that landmark farm law for
the first time since its passage 27 years ago by imposing binding
arbitration in agricultural labor disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Pictsweet workers seeking to oust the UFW say that the union does
not represent their interests and that a majority of laborers would
support decertification, if the matter were put to a vote. In such an
election, workers could decide whether they wanted the UFW to
continue to represent them.</TE>
<TE>   Those workers have submitted three decertification petitions to
the farm labor board since 2000. The first was rejected because it
contained invalid signatures. The others were blocked after the labor
board found evidence to support charges by the UFW that the company
was engaging in unfair labor practices. Those charges included
allegations that the company supported the decertification effort,
which is not allowed.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-UFW workers contend that the union filed the charges only
because it feared that it would be ousted in a representation
election.</TE>
<TE>   They have launched a letter-writing campaign aimed at making state
and local elected officials aware of their views. A letter sent to
Sacramento last week urged Assembly members to reject the binding
arbitration legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "If that law passes, we are automatically going to have a contract
that we don't want and we don't need," said Pictsweet employee
Guillermo Virgen, who gathered last week with more than three dozen
opposition workers outside the plant.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have the economic force or the political force that the
union has, but we want the public to know that all we want is an
election so that the workers can express what they want to have
happen at this plant," Virgen said.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials did not return phone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The UFW first won a contract at the Ventura mushroom farm in 1975,
in one of the first elections held under the Agricultural Labor
Relations Act, union officials said. The agreement paved the way for
the union to negotiate contracts with half a dozen other mushroom
growers in California and Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The union maintained contracts with a series of owners at the
Ventura plant over the years, but that ended when Tennessee-based
United Foods Inc. bought it in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, UFW officials say they have tried a number of times to
hammer out a new contract, kicking the effort into high gear two
years ago. But they say they have made little headway in their
demands for higher wages, dental and vision coverage for the workers,
less-costly medical insurance and a pension plan--highlighting the
need for the binding arbitration legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "Pictsweet has become the poster child for the need for this
legislative effort," said UFW spokesman Marc Grossman, adding that
the Ventura labor dispute has been cited several times in testimony
before Legislative committees.</TE>
<TE>   "The remedy under existing law doesn't work," he said. "We've seen
tens of thousands of farm workers over the years not get what they
voted for, which are union contracts."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1975, farm workers voted for the UFW in secret ballot
elections at 428 companies. Of those, only 185 have entered into
union contracts. The UFW blames growers for the disparity, arguing
that many of them dragged their heels at the bargaining table.</TE>
<TE>   The bill seeks to circumvent that situation. It would provide a
90-day period for parties to negotiate and if an agreement cannot be
reached, a mediator would come in for 30 days to try to resolve the
differences.</TE>
<TE>   If an agreement is still not forthcoming, either side could
petition the state labor board to submit the matter to binding
arbitration before a neutral third party, who would conduct a hearing
and impose the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The bill mirrors a law passed last year by the Legislature
providing binding arbitration to grooms and other stable hands at
state racetracks. Because those workers are classified as
agricultural laborers, the UFW and others argue that the same remedy
should be made available to farm workers across the board.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Davis has yet to take a position on the bill, but farm
industry leaders say they remain hopeful that he will veto the
legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the governor has been trying to strike a moderate
position, not only with the agricultural industry but business in
general, and this type of legislation does not fit well with that
type of middle-of-the-road approach," said Rob Roy, general counsel
for the Ventura County Agricultural Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a discriminatory piece of legislation that singles out
agriculture," he said. "This is affirmative action for the UFW. They
can't get the job done themselves, so they have to rely on the
government to do it for them."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) doesn't see it
that way. She is one of the 40 coauthors in the Assembly and believes
the legislation is necessary to give farm workers who vote for a
union the right to get what they've asked for.</TE>
<TE>   "The least we can do is provide that everybody has to come to the
table and negotiate in good faith," Jackson said. "I don't think that
is unfair to anybody. I just think it levels the playing field, and I
think it's about time we did that for farm workers."</TE>

<HD>Loyalty Pays Off for 3 of Condit's Key Aides</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is probably not the last Gary Condit story, but be patient--the
Ceres congressman will be out of office in the new year.</LD>
<LD>   The remains of Chandra Levy, the murdered young woman whose name
will always after be preceded by "intern," were found in late May.</LD>
<LD>   Now Roll Call, the Capitol Hill publication, reports that its
analysis of payroll records shows the California Democrat gave big
raises to three loyal key aides not long after reports emerged that
he was--as the phrase goes--"romantically involved" with Levy.</LD>
<TE>   There's a school of logic called "post hoc ergo propter hoc,"
meaning that because something happens after an event, it is assumed
to have happened because of the event. Whether that's the case here,
who knows?</TE>
<TE>   But Roll Call, analyzing quarterly salaries, found that Condit's
longtime executive secretary's income rose from about $57,000 in 2000
to $99,000 for 2001 and, this year, up to a quarterly rate that would
work out to about $105,800 annually.</TE>
<TE>   His administrative assistant earned $95,000 in 2000 and about
$115,000 a year after the Levy story broke, and got another raise
this year that would work out to an annual income of $137,000, not
much less than a lot of members of Congress get, and just $8,000
under the maximum allowed for congressional staffers.</TE>
<TE>   And Condit's chief of staff saw his salary rise from $114,400 in
2000 to $127,500 last year, and then, based on his pay so far this
year, to an annual rate of $138,000.</TE>
<TE>   All had vigorously defended their boss in the Levy matter. The
administrative assistant was spotted driving Condit to a trash can in
northern Virginia, where Condit threw away a watch case reported to
have contained a gift from a woman friend.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the country, in Fresno, lawyers representing
Condit's wife, Carolyn, were fussing over whether the National
Enquirer could legally be called a "newspaper."</TE>
<TE>   That definition could figure in a federal judge's ruling on the
Enquirer's motion to throw out the $10-million libel case that Mrs.
Condit filed after the tabloid's August 2001 article headlined,
"Cops: Condit's Wife Attacked Chandra," an account of a supposed
telephone confrontation between Mrs. Condit and the intern.</TE>
<TE>   In her suit, Carolyn Condit included a request for an apology and
a retraction, but California law gives newspapers a chance to correct
mistakes by printing corrections or retractions before lawsuits are
filed--if they are in fact newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   The courts ruled in 1976, in a lawsuit by Carol Burnett, that the
tabloid is not a newspaper under the state law's definition. But its
attorneys now argue that the Enquirer is a different publication
these days, covering news and emphasizing "being hot and being
first."</TE>
<TE>   Once that's settled, maybe we'll have heard almost the last.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Frat's Gray Area</TE>
<TE>   What's wrong with this syllogism?</TE>
<TE>   Gray Davis pledged Zeta Psi fraternity when he was at Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   The fraternity's Web site has a list of "famous members of Zeta
Psi."</TE>
<TE>   Ergo, Davis should be on that list, right?</TE>
<TE>   He's not. Baby doctor Benjamin Spock is. So are "Superman" actor
Dean Cain, a couple of NFL players and some major money men.</TE>
<TE>   Is it an oversight? A campaign tactic? An outdated list? After
all, Dr. Spock is dead, Red Grange is dead and Pete Wilson is
governor no longer.</TE>
<TE>   But hey, they left off Zeta Psi-ster Henry Ford II, too--the man
who put the Mustang and the Thunderbird on the nation's roads, along
with the Pinto and the Edsel.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Slicing and Dicing</TE>
<TE>   It's slice-and-dice time in Sacramento, and we don't mean the
budget.</TE>
<TE>   First, a veteran GOP senator was handed his head by his own party,
after being locked out of closed-door caucus meetings. Maurice
Johannessen, a 67-year-old Redding Republican, was being punished for
siding with Democrats to give the budget and tax bill the two-thirds
majority it needed.</TE>
<TE>   Johannessen denied that he traded his vote for an appointive
position when he's termed out of office at the end of November, or to
get a veterans home in Redding, but for reasons of serious budget
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   And he responded to his schoolyard scolding appropriately, with a
statesmanlike "Nah-nah nah-nah nah."</TE>
<TE>   And across the aisle, Dean Florez, the Democrat who headed the
joint legislative audit committee, was abruptly dumped from the job
by Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson.</TE>
<TE>   The Shafter Democrat felt he was getting the shaft--not for
bailing out on a critical vote on the groundbreaking greenhouse-gases
bill that had passed the day before, but because he's been leading
the charge on hearings into the backroom dealings that gave a green
light to the state's screwed-up software deal with Oracle Corp., a
$95-million deal approved without competitive bidding.</TE>
<TE>   A gloating Republican Party press release asked Florez's
successor, Fred Keeley of Boulder Creek, whether he wants to be an
"honest truth-seeker" or "Gray Davis' lap dog."</TE>
<TE>   What, no third choice?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Longtime Congressman David Dreier, the high-ranking GOP guy from
San Dimas, is celebrating his 50th birthday with a bowling party in
Washington on Tuesday, probably one of the few times that the call
"Strike!" will be part of a Republican's vocabulary.</TE>
<TE>   * In calling on Gray Davis to debate Bill Simon, the latter's
campaign also said it wants to include in the debates the Green
Party's gubernatorial nominee, Peter Camejo, who has been hitting
middle single digits in the polls lately. Camejo speculates that he's
what's keeping Davis from agreeing to debate.</TE>
<TE>   * Spotted last month on a booth in the courtyard outside the Cal
State Fullerton campus: "LaRouche in 2004," heralding the return of
Lyndon LaRouche, who ran his 1992 campaign from a prison cell, where
he was serving time for fraud.</TE>
<TE>   * Is there an Ahmanson curse? In the Ventura County supervisor's
race, the winner was the first-out-of-the-box anti-Ahmanson Ranch
development candidate, Republican Linda Parks. On the L.A. side of
the line, Republicans and Democrats have opposed the Washington
Mutual development, from L.A. Mayor Jim Hahn and council member
Dennis Zine to state Sen. Sheila Kuehl. And now that Keith Richman,
the Northridge Republican assemblyman who had supported the Ahmanson
development, says he'd run for mayor of a new San Fernando Valley
city, he also says he's prepared to change his mind on the matter if
the facts warrant.</TE>
<TE>   * Happy second birthday to the state's Department of Managed Care;
don't burn yourself on those candles--your HMO might not cover it.</TE>
<TE>   * L.A. council members Nick Pacheco and Ed Reyes showed up to
celebrate the certification of the Historic Highland Park
Neighborhood Council, but didn't win the talent show.</TE>
<TE>   * Under "be careful what you wish for--it might come true": Ross
Perot has been asked to testify at a congressional hearing on
California's energy crisis. He's already set to testify before the
state Senate on July 11 about questions over whether Perot Systems,
which helped create the state's energy market software, also dropped
hints to energy companies on how to "game" the market.</TE>
<TE>   * To the disgust of lunchtime patrons a few Tuesdays ago at the
venerable El Cholo Mexican restaurant in Los Angeles, a police
black-and-white roared up, parked in the red zone out front, and two
uniformed officers leaped out and rushed inside--to eat lunch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   " ... A snow-cone ghost town experience...."</TE>
<TE>   --Assemblyman Tim Leslie, a Tahoe City Republican, who trashed the
competition--Calico, Calif.--as he barnstormed to get his bill passed
declaring Bodie the official ghost town of California. His bill died
in the Senate after supporters of Calico--a town near Barstow that
stages mock gunfights and Wild West parades for people to watch while
they're eating those snow cones--put the heat on legislators. Leslie
promises to bring the measure up again in August.</TE>

<HD>Man Killed, 2 Others Are Wounded in Hail of Gunfire</HD>
<DH>Crime: The three were leaving a friend's house in Camarillo
when the shooter walked up and asked them where they were from.
Deputies arrest four suspects.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A shooting on a Camarillo street left one man dead, two of his
friends hospitalized with multiple gunshot wounds and four Oxnard men
behind bars, sheriff's officials said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Robles, 18, of Oxnard was pronounced dead at the scene from a
gunshot wound in the chest at 8:30 p.m. Saturday in the 100 block of
Raemere Street, said Craig Stevens, senior deputy medical examiner.</LD>
<LD>   It was the 12th homicide in Ventura County this year.</LD>
<TE>   Julio Espinoza, 18, and Miguel Rocha, 19, both of Camarillo, were
hospitalized after the shooting. Espinoza was in stable condition at
St. John's Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo on Sunday, and Rocha
was being treated at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard.
Their injuries were not considered life-threatening, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County sheriff's deputies arrested four men in Oxnard
after the incident.</TE>
<TE>   They were driving a black sedan that matched a description given
by witnesses, Sheriff's Sgt. Harold Hanley said.</TE>
<TE>   The men, whose names were not released, were booked on suspicion
of murder and held at Ventura County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators were still searching for a weapon late Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Hanley would not say whether the shooting was gang-related but was
not ruling it out.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said the three victims were shot as they got into a car
on Raemere Street after visiting a friend. A gunman asked the men
where they were from before he began shooting, witnesses said. On
Sunday, friends placed flowers and candles on the patch of grass
where Robles was killed. A wooden cross, bearing messages to the
deceased, was placed at the site.</TE>
<TE>   "He just wanted to go to school and do something with his life,"
Jose Robles said of his brother, who had attended Camarillo High
School and taken classes at Ventura College.</TE>
<TE>   Hanley said that Robles had had numerous contacts with the
department's gang unit, and had been arrested June 30 for resisting
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Robles was raised in Somis but spent most of his time on Raemere
Street with his close friends, his brother said. He had recently
moved into his mother's home in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood where Robles was killed, near Daily Drive and
Arneill Road, is a mix of duplexes and aging single-story homes.</TE>
<TE>   Hanley said deputies are often called there to deal with
complaints of loud parties and alcohol violations.</TE>

<HD>Pitch for an Auto Mall Puts a Toad in the Line of Fire</HD>
<DH>Santa Clarita: Developer to donate ball fields. But
environmentalists say amphibian is threatened.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Santa Clarita, a city that many residents think of as a 21st
century Mayberry, a group of environmentalists is risking being
branded anti-baseball.</LD>
<LD>   The group, Friends of the Santa Clara River, opposes Newhall Land
&amp; Farming Co.'s plan for an auto mall that includes improvements to
nearby youth baseball and softball fields.</LD>
<LD>   The activists say the project, which is proposed for a site near
the river at Valencia Boulevard and Cinema Drive, would harm the
endangered arroyo toad, a 3-inch amphibian found in parts of the
river.</LD>
<TE>   Barriers to help control flooding would threaten the sandy
habitats where the toads breed, they say.</TE>
<TE>   The group has challenged the Santa Clarita Planning Commission's
approval of the project and hopes that the City Council, which is
expected to vote on the project at 5:30 p.m. today, will oppose it.</TE>
<TE>   All 100 board members of William S. Hart Boys and Girls
Baseball/Softball League, along with their uniformed children, plan
to pack City Hall to root for the auto mall. The league is a
48-year-old local institution that yearly suits up 3,000 players,
ages 6 to 18.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy Murphy, whose son plays in the league, said she was
exasperated by the environmentalists' stand.</TE>
<TE>   "Great," she said. "We'll have safe frogs, but [lousy] things for
our kids."</TE>
<TE>   A former City Council candidate has warned that parents are ready
to countersue the environmentalists if they pursue their complaints
in court.</TE>
<TE>   And a local columnist whose child plays in the league has jokingly
written that the baseball fans "have access to bats, and many know
how to use them."</TE>
<TE>   "Now it's like, mom and apple pie against those crazy
environmentalists," lamented Lynne Plambeck, a member of Friends of
the Santa Clara River.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy illustrates the battle for the hearts and minds of
Santa Clarita residents as the booming commuter suburb struggles with
the pace of growth.</TE>
<TE>   Are local environmentalists out of touch with the mainstream? Or
is Newhall Land--which has built thousands of homes in Santa Clarita
and plans to build the 21,000-home Newhall Ranch development
nearby--a master manipulator of public opinion, one that is not above
tying the national pastime to a big development to help it win
approval?</TE>
<TE>   Hart league President Dave Scripture believes the developer is
being neighborly in offering the upgrades, noting that the company
has leased the fields to the league for $1 a year for decades. If the
auto mall project is approved, Newhall says it will donate the fields
to the league.</TE>
<TE>   The company also pledges to let the league use the car lot's new
sewer line, introduce a new traffic light and install the
flood-control barriers, which act as artificial riverbanks.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Galvin, California director of the nonprofit environmental
group Center for Biological Diversity, believes Newhall Land has
packaged the car lot project with the baseball field extras to sway
public opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have [in Santa Clarita] is a kind of company-town
mentality," he said. "Anyone who speaks up to protect the wildlife
and the river is essentially branded un-American."</TE>
<TE>   Galvin and Friends of the Santa Clara River also are concerned
that the artificial banks are part of a push to transform the
84-mile, largely untamed waterway into something more like the
concrete-hemmed Los Angeles River.</TE>
<TE>   Though the developer will bury the banks to blend in with the
natural environment, activists say they will still upset the arroyo
toad's habitat.</TE>
<TE>   "Toads just cannot burrow into the soil-cement mix they're going
to use," said Teresa Savaikie, a member of Friends of the Santa Clara
River.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, activists suspect the soil that would be imported for
the project may contain ammonium perchlorate, a toxic leftover from a
local munitions plant.</TE>
<TE>   Newhall spokeswoman Marlee Laufer maintains that the soil is
clean, the proper permits will be obtained and that the toad doesn't
live in that part of the river.</TE>
<TE>   Scripture adds that the improvements, especially the artificial
riverbanks, will make a big difference for the league and its young
players.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the year, the stretch of the Santa Clara that flows
past the fields is a trickling creek at best. But when big storms
come, flood waters gush west from the San Gabriel Mountains, and
currently, there is nothing to stop them.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1998 season, storm water washed out four of the
league's 10 ball fields, doing thousands of dollars in damage,
Scripture said.</TE>
<TE>   The auto mall would accommodate four dealerships and add an
estimated $1.1 million a year to the $4.4 million the city receives
from auto sales taxes, city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Laurene Weste said recently that she had not decided
which way she would vote but that she would look for a compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Plambeck said a compromise is all her group wants, as long as it
includes getting rid of the barriers.</TE>
<TE>   Rudi Bendig, who was scoring his son's game on a recent afternoon,
said he was all for the project. "If all these kids weren't playing
baseball, they'd probably be running along the riverbank squashing
toads anyway."</TE>

<HD>Davis Policies Halt Years of Neglect at State Parks</HD>

<DL>LAKE TAHOE</DL>
<LD>Cleats are back on the pier at Emerald Bay in Lake Tahoe. If you are
a boater, this is no small matter.</LD>
<LD>   If you are a user of any state park at all, in fact, it is one
more sign that these facilities are being rejuvenated after years of
neglect and deterioration.</LD>
<LD>   Up here at the lake, the cleat restoration means a boating family
is much more likely now to find room to tie up and savor one of
California's gems: an alluring bay carved by a glacier, sitting in a
spectacular granite bowl beneath towering peaks and waterfalls.</LD>
<TE>   The main man-made attraction is historic Vikingsholm Castle,
probably the finest example of Scandinavian architecture in America.
There's also a nice beach and toilets, all run by the state. Until
recently, the castle's sod roof leaked badly, causing extensive wood
rot and crumbling plaster. All that has been fixed and the toilets
upgraded.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors have two ways to get here: a steep, one-mile hike--or by
water. There is a small-boat tie-up: a stationary pier with an
adjacent floating dock.</TE>
<TE>   I began carping in a column four years ago about the abysmal,
dangerous boating setup, with its protruding nails, jagged metal,
listing dock and cleatless pier. Gov. Gray Davis ordered repairs two
years later, but parks bureaucrats purposely left cleats off the
pier. Wanted to limit boat tie-ups to the small dock, they explained.</TE>
<TE>   After more squawking last summer--why have a pier if it can't
handle a boat?--five cleats were screwed on. And two weeks ago, I
tied up there at a landing that's now sturdy and safe.</TE>
<TE>   For years, the Emerald Bay pier was symbolic of a state park
system in sorry disrepair because of cost-cutting. Now, it is
evidence that these parks--267 units in all--are slowly making a
comeback under Gov. Gray Davis, like him or not.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis apparently is not getting much public credit for the
parks' resurgence or other environmental advances. A recent statewide
poll by the Public Policy Institute of California found that only 35%
of people approved of the way the governor "is handling environmental
issues."</TE>
<TE>   Still, they thought Davis--by a 12-point margin--would do a better
job on the environment than Republican Bill Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Based on Simon's right-wing positioning during the primary--his
constant preaching about "public-private partnerships"--you'd think
his ideal park would be, say, Disneyland's California Adventure, with
a public access road.</TE>
<TE>   Simon opposed Proposition 40, a $2.6-billion parks, anti-pollution
and land purchase bond measure that voters approved by a
mini-landslide in March. Now, attempting to reposition himself toward
the center, the GOP gubernatorial nominee has promised, if elected,
to sponsor a $1-billion bond issue aimed at developing and
rehabilitating parks.</TE>
<TE>   Davis endorsed Prop. 40 and campaigned hard in 2000 for Prop. 12,
a $2.1-billion bond issue oriented toward urban parks. It was passed
by a whopping 63% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Rusty Areias, who resigned as state parks director this year to
run for the state Senate, recalls that "Davis told me, 'Fix the
existing parks, but I want new parks where people live.' "</TE>
<TE>   Read: "voters."</TE>
<TE>   "The governor believed L.A. is the most park-starved metropolitan
area in the country, despite the beaches."</TE>
<TE>   So the state has purchased downtown land and dedicated $84 million
for a new L.A. river parkway. Davis also slashed visitor fees by
roughly half. That lured more low-income people to parks, increasing
usage by an estimated 30%, to 90 million annual visits. So far,
lawmakers trying to close a $23.6-billion budget gap have not been
tempted to restore the old fees.</TE>
<TE>   More important, soon after taking office Davis set aside $157
million in general fund money for deferred maintenance. That's what
got the Emerald Bay pier repaired, plus hundreds of other decrepit
facilities: filthy restrooms, rusty drinking fountains, broken
barbecues, eroded trails....</TE>
<TE>   Around L.A., there have been scores of fix-ups: at Will Rogers,
Leo Carrillo, Malibu Creek, Topanga, Bolsa Chica....</TE>
<TE>   Here at Tahoe, rangers plan to install a new water plant at D.L.
Bliss park, so campers no longer have to boil their own water. Rusty
water lines are being replaced at Sugar Pine Point.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout California, they're making many park trails accessible
to the disabled--removing barriers and smoothing grades. On the north
coast, there's an 11-mile accessible path through redwoods.</TE>
<TE>   "The disabled used to have only flat little asphalt trails behind
the visitors' center," notes Don Beers, the north coast trails
supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   Parks barely register a blip on the voters' priority list. But
they do make life more enjoyable for millions of Californians who do
not happen to have their own parks in the backyard, a beachfront
condo or a private deck over a lake.</TE>

<HD>Nursing Home Aides' Papers Found Bogus</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Justice Dept. arrests 76 people linked to fraud
ring that doctored test scores for unqualified candidates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON ORTIZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nursing homes throughout Los Angeles have unwittingly hired dozens of
unqualified nurse assistants who got state certification by paying a
fraud ring that infiltrated the state's testing system to doctor
their test scores.</LD>
<LD>   So far, state Justice Department officials have arrested 76 people
involved in the scheme, and state health officials have revoked 124
certificates for nursing assistants.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a new crime of opportunity," said Deputy Atty. Gen. Mark
Zahner. "There are people out there so motivated by greed that they
take advantage of the job situation and the elderly and infirm. They
don't care that they're putting lives at risk by sticking people in
nursing homes under false pretenses and putting them into a position
to really hurt somebody."</LD>
<TE>   More cases are likely to surface soon. Both the California
Department of Health Services and the Justice Department confirmed
that other probes are currently underway, but declined to comment on
specifics, citing their policy not to discuss details of ongoing
investigations.</TE>
<TE>   A lack of certified nurse assistants has created an environment
that invites fraud in the nursing home industry, magnified by the
pressure on administrators to fully staff their facilities while
holding down wages.</TE>
<TE>   "There's definitely a shortage of CNAs," said Mitchell Miller, who
manages the DHS complaint department. "And that makes it easier for
unscrupulous people to slip into the system."</TE>
<TE>   Medical industry observers note that as baby boomers are aging,
nursing homes face a growing patient population and a dearth of
qualified staff, especially CNAs. It is a problem that promises to
worsen in coming years.</TE>
<TE>   Nurse assistants perform 70% of all hands-on patient care, from
emptying bedpans to recording blood pressure, according to a study by
California Office of Health Planning and Development. They also earn
the least of all nursing staff, averaging $9.17 per hour in 2000.
Licensed vocational nurses earned $17.23 per hour and registered
nurses averaged $22.74 per hour that same year.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a fluid job market in which 60% of CNAs switch
employers within one year, frequently moving from one facility to
another for slightly better pay or hours, according to the state's
study.</TE>
<TE>   In the last three months, Justice Department prosecutors have
charged 76 people with paying for a nurse assistant certificate and
then using the credential to find work at nursing homes. Law
enforcement officials expect "another 20 or so" arrests before the
investigation is closed. The Health Services department has revoked
124 CNA certificates in its ongoing investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the key figures in the case, Juan Carlos Cano, 25, and
Carole Ann Lopez, 40, pleaded no contest last month to felony charges
that they orchestrated the scheme to certify unqualified CNA
applicants in the Los Angeles area by altering the results of state
eligibility exams. Both have been stripped of their licenses and
sentenced to 300 days in jail and five years' probation, and together
they owe nearly $100,000 in fines and restitution.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators learned that Cano, a licensed vocational nurse,
recruited non-English-speaking Latinos to take the state-mandated,
English-only test. For a fee of as much as $500, "applicants" took
the exam at South Orange County Community College, where Lopez, a
registered nurse, taught classes and proctored the CNA test for a
private company contracted by the state. Lopez doctored the scores
before sending them on to DHS, which unwittingly issued certificates
based on the bogus results. Over the course of a year, the "proctor
and doctor" scheme netted the pair more than $32,000.</TE>
<TE>   "These were two of the first people to get jail time," said
Zahner, who supervised the investigation. "I'm afraid they won't be
the last."</TE>
<TE>   Although the state has a 24-hour phone service to validate CNA
certificates, it was not until a nursing home administrator called
authorities at DHS, questioning how an employee who didn't read or
speak English could pass the test, that the plot began to unravel.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an effective scam for a while," said Collin Wong,
spokesman for the attorney general's office. "Whenever someone got
suspicious and called in on DHS's automated phone system to check a
person's certification, it always came up valid."</TE>
<TE>   To become a CNA, candidates must complete 50 hours in the
classroom and 100 hours of supervised clinical instruction, then pass
a multiple-choice oral or written exam and a skills test.</TE>
<TE>   False representation as a certified nurse assistant is punishable
by up to 180 days in jail and a $1,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said officials are always considering ways to make the CNA
test more secure, but trusting proctors will not change.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have someone who's bent on going against the grain,
there's not much you can do," Miller said. "But we're strengthening
our relationship with the attorney general's people, and we're
getting better at catching this sort of thing all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Industry watchdogs say nursing homes and the state agencies that
oversee them are also part of the problem. They charge that CNA pay
and certification standards should be raised, but that the industry
has pushed for lower standards for certification. By keeping
standards low, they say, administrators can keep wages down, which in
turn destabilizes the job market and opens the door to fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "CNAs only need 150 hours of classroom and clinical time," said
Prescott Cole of California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform. "To
become a hairdresser in this state it takes 1,600 hours. The pay is a
joke. So little is required of people to become CNAs and do CNA work,
it indicates just how poor the conditions are that something like
[test fraud] would happen."</TE>
<TE>   State officials disagree, noting that they periodically review the
tests and raise standards as nurse assistants take on more tasks in
the workplace.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked at the tests just a few weeks ago," said Mike Strank,
the state's chief of aide and technician certification. "I felt like
they are meeting all our requirements to assess how a person will do
in a patient-care setting."</TE>

<HD>Groups Fight Increase in Bias Against Arabs</HD>
<DH>Hate: Organizations are seeking to document and prevent
backlash incidents after attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The initial post-Sept. 11 violence against American Arabs and
Muslims, or people mistaken for them, often took place in public
spaces: on the street, at a convenience store, near a mosque. But
some advocates of these groups say a quieter backlash also took place
in people's homes--and they worry that it may still pose a threat.</LD>
<LD>   It can be a neighbor's hostility, an unwarranted eviction notice
or a wild accusation. All of these have rattled the sense of
community of some Southern California residents of Arab or South
Asian descent. Such concern has brought an effort by some local
organizations to document the problems and try to prevent them.</LD>
<LD>   * The Housing Rights Center, which regularly sends out "testers"
to determine whether landlords discriminate, has increased its pool
of would-be renters of Middle Eastern descent since Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   * Statewide, a group of advocates recently formed a task force to
study the issue of fair housing and immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   The Muslim Public Affairs Council said it has asked the Justice
Department to review a list of guidelines that the Los Angeles Police
Department sent to apartments' owners. The group worries that the
list might increase bias against Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   * The South Asian Network has begun a campaign to encourage people
to talk about problems in employment or housing matters.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates acknowledge that they do not know the extent of housing
harassment or discrimination. In a time of increased detentions,
interrogations and deportations, they said, getting people to talk is
tough.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wants to appear on the radar," said Hamid Khan, executive
director of the South Asian Network, based in Artesia. "We're trying
to get the word out. Please call us; let us know. We need to document
these things, start some advocacy and start mobilizing the
community."</TE>
<TE>   Incidents like the shooting Thursday at Los Angeles International
Airport by an Egyptian-born man makes the job of Khan's group more
difficult, he said. "We're dealing with guilt by association. Any
time an incident like this happens our alarm bells go off. We go on
alert as to what kind of retribution is going to take place."</TE>
<TE>   "South Asian" is a broad term that includes Indians, Pakistanis,
Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans and Nepalese. Khan and other advocates say
that South Asians are targeted by people who mistake them for Middle
Easterners.</TE>
<TE>   Sikhs wear turbans and many older South Asians still wear ethnic
clothing, so "they are easily recognizable as 'foreign,' " said Kripa
Upadhyay, program coordinator for the South Asian Network group,
known as SAN.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing whether an incident is motivated by a person's religion or
ethnicity is inherently difficult. The Los Angeles County Commission
on Human Relations has not compiled statistics for this year on
hate-motivated crimes or incidents that have taken place at victims'
residences. It counted 44 such cases between Sept. 11 and Dec. 2. And
incidents so far this year have troubled some advocates.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the magazine of the Apartment Owners Assn. of Southern
California, which has a circulation of 75,000, published an article
titled "A Moment of Truth for Muslims." The article, which also
appeared on the association's Web site, described Islam as a
"religion of violence and hatred," and accused Muslims of being
"responsible for most terrorism in the world today."</TE>
<TE>   Such articles reflect "a lot of ignorance and stereotypical images
about Muslims," said Salam Al-Marayati, executive director of the
Muslim Public Affairs Council.</TE>
<TE>   Aslam Abdullah, editor in chief of Minaret, a Muslim magazine,
said he had asked to write a rebuttal in the apartment association's
magazine but was refused.</TE>
<TE>   He called the article "hate speech" and said, "I have information
that a few Muslims were denied rentals after the publication of this
article."</TE>
<TE>   Dan Faller, president of the Apartment Owners Assn., said he had
run the article because of his interest in religion; he said it had
no implications for tenant-landlord relations and said the
publication in the past has run articles cautioning against
discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   "The Muslim religion teaches that they worship the same God that
the Jewish people worship, that the Christian people worship, and
that is a lie," Faller said. "So the primary purpose of my putting
the article in was to point out that that's not true." He said the
article had drawn strong support, particularly from Jewish readers.</TE>
<TE>   Another incident occurred in February, when a cardiologist of
Indian origin was shot at in his Porterville, Calif., home in what
prosecutors allege was a hate crime.</TE>
<TE>   Before dawn, a man knocked on the door of Indian-born Dr. Ashok
Behl, then shot at Behl through a thick glass pane, said Porterville
Police Sgt. Eric Kroutil. The doctor suffered injuries to the face
and neck.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged gunman, Joe Howard Keel, 27, was arrested later the
same day in Burbank, Kroutil said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the shooting had been "possibly in retaliation for
events in New York" and they have labeled it a hate crime. Keel told
police he thought the doctor was "Arabic," Kroutil said.</TE>
<TE>   Anxiety among some South Asians and Arab Americans in Los Angeles
heightened in May when the FBI issued a memo saying terrorists might
target apartment buildings with explosives.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Department followed that memo by releasing
a list of guidelines that encouraged owners to be more vigilant about
prospective tenants--for example, people who are not disabled but
want first-floor units.</TE>
<TE>   Though the guidelines do not target any group, and police
officials have cautioned managers to obey anti-discrimination laws,
some housing advocates and civil rights attorneys worry that the list
will encourage landlords to discriminate.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand the need for security," Khan said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our concern is, they are handing out these guidelines to
untrained people who bring their own prejudices to this."</TE>

<HD>Center Sets Tone to Teach Musical Heritage</HD>
<DH>Oxnard: Free performing-arts classes provide cultural
training and a sense of pride for the program's mostly Latino
students.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZIE ST. JOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the last three years, Jahaira Rodriguez has been taking acting,
singing, dancing and violin lessons five days a week.</LD>
<LD>   With a schedule like that, one would guess that she has her sights
set on Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Guess again.</LD>
<TE>   For the 14-year-old west Ventura girl, it's not about the future
but more about the past--her Mexican heritage and culture.</TE>
<TE>   The classes, offered year-round at the Inlakech Cultural Arts
Center in Oxnard, focus on the cultural arts of Mexico, including
mariachi music and folklorico dancing. Also offered are advanced
guitar, Aztec dance and classical ballet. Nearly 125 students take
classes in an average week.</TE>
<TE>   "I take the classes because they are a lot of fun, but also
because it's part of our culture," said Jahaira, who will be a
sophomore at Ventura High School this fall. "We get to learn more
about it than we do in school."</TE>
<TE>   Four Rodriguez children are taking classes at Inlakech.</TE>
<TE>   Jahaira and Nereida, 7, are enrolled in the same four classes,
while brother Jadiel, 13, takes trumpet, acting and dancing, and
sister Naneli, 5, focuses on singing and acting. Two-year-old Sarai
is too young for formal classes but likes to sing with her sisters.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't mind coming every day," Jahaira said. "For us it's like
having another family at the center."</TE>
<TE>   That kind of sentiment is what Inlakech's founder and artistic
director, Javier Gomez, had in mind when he and his wife, Irene,
started the center in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   The center grew out of Teatro Inlakech, a professional bilingual
theater company founded in 1976 by Gomez. The group's mission is to
perform Chicano/Latino plays depicting Latino life throughout Ventura
County.</TE>
<TE>   Inlakech is a Mayan term meaning "you are my other self."</TE>
<TE>   Gomez said the idea for the cultural arts center stemmed from a
need for additional talent for his Teatro Inlakech productions.</TE>
<TE>   "The best way to accomplish that was to have a training ground to
draw from," Gomez said. "The center provides an option for parents
wanting to harness the energy exhibited by children and give them
something positive to do.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at our center as a form of prevention. All kids are at
risk, and the center is a neutral base where they can enjoy each
other and develop friendships and tear down the walls of division."</TE>
<TE>   He said the majority of the center's students live in La Colonia,
other parts of Oxnard and Ventura. Although most students are Latino,
the classes are open to anyone, Gomez said.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Hernandez, an administrator for the Oxnard Elementary
School District, said she has known many students in the program.</TE>
<TE>   "We see the cultural center as a treasure in our community," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "At Inlakech, students learn about culture, and it helps their
self-esteem and helps them feel good about themselves."</TE>
<TE>   One of the greatest attractions of the program, Gomez said, is
that all the classes are free for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   His motivation for providing the classes free stems from his being
the oldest of 15 children. He and his siblings could never afford
outside activities, Gomez said, so when this program was started, he
insisted that no price tag be attached.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the beauty of our program is that it's not just for
children," said Gomez, 52. "We have a lot of adults who didn't get to
do things as kids, and they still have that desire to learn."</TE>
<TE>   Gomez spends his evenings teaching at the center and by day is a
math instructor at Haydock Intermediate School in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where I get to rest," said Gomez, who is starting his 30th
year as an educator. "It's so relaxing for me to teach."</TE>
<TE>   He tries to impart his love of teaching to not only his students,
but also the instructors--who volunteer their time at Inlakech.</TE>
<TE>   The staff ranges from the Gomezes' daughter Xochitl, 28, who
teaches advanced folklorico dance, to Salvador Bravo, 77, who teaches
guitar.</TE>
<TE>   "They have the same passion I have to help out our children,"
Gomez said.</TE>
<TE>   "I could never repay them for the time and knowledge they've given
over the years."</TE>
<TE>   One of the ways the center pays for itself is through fund-raising
performances. Several of these concerts are held throughout the year.</TE>
<TE>   The money raised not only helps operate the two-room center at 937
W. 5th St., but also helps send students to specialized workshops
such as the annual mariachi festival in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Inlakech is sending 21 students and nine parents this month.</TE>
<TE>   For five days, students will receive intensive instruction in
mariachi music and dance, culminating in a grand finale featuring the
approximately 300 participants.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez said he is just glad the community supports the center,
allowing the kids to attend special events.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about the power of self-discovery and being able to
become better than what they were," Gomez said.</TE>

<HD>3rd Birthday Means New Life--in China--for San Diego-Born
Panda</HD>
<DH>Zoo: Hua Mei is getting a giant send-off from her adoring
fans before loan agreement ends.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>It is always an emotional affair when a superstar makes a farewell
tour before departing the stage.</LD>
<LD>   Sinatra. Chevalier. Kareem. Hua Mei.</LD>
<LD>   The giant panda whose birth at the San Diego Zoo brought rejoicing
to a panda-loving populace is going home to China.</LD>
<TE>   Under the panda loan agreement between the U.S. and China that
brought the male Shi Shi and female Bai Yun to San Diego in 1996, any
progeny from their union is the property of China and must be
returned to the creature's native land at age 3. Hua Mei (pronounced
wah-may) turns 3 on Aug. 21.</TE>
<TE>   Although no date has been set, San Diego zookeepers are preparing
the public for Hua Mei's imminent departure. Freeway billboards,
television commercials and multiple signs at the zoo remind visitors
that her long run is coming to an end.</TE>
<TE>   As a kind of zoological therapy, patrons can videotape farewell
messages to Hua Mei, the only surviving panda ever born at a zoo in
North America. "People are very emotional," said Ellie Rosenbaum, the
zoo's senior panda narrator. "They watched her birth on the Internet.
They've watched her grow up on the panda cam [the zoo's Web site].
They feel like she's ours."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 4,000 animals at the San Diego Zoo, there is little doubt
that Hua Mei is the most popular with its 3 million annual visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Bai Yun (bi-yoon) and Shi Shi (shee-shee) have their own
constituencies, but Hua Mei surpasses them, zoo officials say. More
visitors see the pandas than any other animal, and Hua Mei's
popularity has spawned a trove of trinkets: Hua Mei T-shirts, Hua Mei
mugs, Hua Mei books and more.</TE>
<TE>   Not that this is altogether surprising. Since the first panda
arrived in the U.S. in the 1920s, no other zoo animal has so
captivated the public as the fuzzy creatures with the hypnotic
black-and-white coloring. Zookeepers have a term for pandas:
charismatic mega-vertebrates.</TE>
<TE>   Even by panda standards, Hua Mei has a star's knack for pleasing
the public. From a birth weight of 4 ounces, she is now pushing 190
pounds--only 30 pounds less than her father. She bounds into her
enclosure each morning and scampers around to such acclaim that
visitors' cameras click like a herd of crickets.</TE>
<TE>   "She's surprised us with the intensity of her vigor," said Don
Lindburg, the zoo's giant panda team leader.</TE>
<TE>   When Hua Mei climbs her tree for her daily nap, she seems to make
a point of staying visible, with her face turned toward the passing
crowd. Shi Shi, by comparison, sprawls carelessly like a couch potato
and visitors often are treated merely to the sight of his back and
rump.</TE>
<TE>   Even popular animals can have little or no stage presence. Koalas
are Garbo-like in their mania for seclusion, and apes have been known
to react to zoo patrons like rock stars being pestered by paparazzi.</TE>
<TE>   As enthusiastically as they have been greeted in zoos worldwide,
pandas have struggled on their home turf. Their numbers in China have
dwindled perilously. Habitat is disappearing rapidly. And expanding
the population is made extremely difficult by a reproductive
peculiarity--females are in heat just two days a year.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the loan agreement, the San Diego Zoo contributes $1
million a year to China's panda-protection efforts.</TE>
<TE>   When Shi Shi and Bai Yun arrived in 1996, the goal was for
scientists to begin unlocking the mysteries of panda procreation. But
the May-December pair had compatibility problems from the beginning.
Bai Yun was fecund and frisky, but Shi Shi was uninterested. Hua Mei
was the result of artificial insemination.</TE>
<TE>   At 26, Shi Shi is geriatric. When Hua Mei departs for the Wolong
Giant Panda Research Center in China, so will Shi Shi. The zoo
already has identified a younger male--Gao Gao, 9--as a replacement.
"We feel we've only got half of the story," Lindburg said. "We've
never had a mating here, never had a mounting. Our chance to learn
about mating and courtship has been limited."</TE>
<TE>   For all their cuddly appearance, pandas are not much on family,
and Hua Mei, Shi Shi and Bai Yun are kept apart.</TE>
<TE>   Bai Yun, 10, was artificially inseminated with Shi Shi's sperm in
March, and zoo officials are still hopeful she could be pregnant. She
is not put on display.</TE>
<TE>   "We want her thinking calm, tranquil, fertile thoughts," Rosenbaum
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., only Zoo Atlanta and the National Zoo in Washington
also have pandas.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement that brought Shi Shi and Bai Yun to San Diego is set
to expire in six years, and its renewal potential is unclear; panda
geopolitics are delicate and complex.</TE>
<TE>   As the summer tourist season hits its stride, there is a daily
pilgrimage to the panda exhibit to see Hua Mei one last time.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember when she was born," said Brandon Burton, a bus driver
who came from Downey with his wife and two children to see Hua Mei.
"We can't let her leave without saying goodbye."</TE>
<TE>   To the Burton family and all the panda faithful, Rosenbaum offers
anthropomorphic solace.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it seems she was just born, but they grow up fast," she
said. "It's like sending one of your kids off to college: It's time
to move on."</TE>

<HD>Woman Shot, Left in Garage for Six Days</HD>
<DH>Crime: Authorities say suspect boyfriend tended to her
wounds--but never called for help.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For six days, Christina Stebbins languished in the garage of her
secluded Big Bear Lake home, lying on a mattress and trying not to
let her strength seep away through the three bullet wounds in her
body, authorities said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Boyfriend Christian Lindblad, who is allegedly responsible for
firing the bullets that sliced into her hand, leg and stomach, tended
to Stebbins' wounds with gauze and antiseptic, investigators said.</LD>
<LD>   But he never called for help.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, help finally came on Wednesday, when a family friend
learned of the shooting and summoned paramedics who airlifted
Stebbins to Loma Linda University Medical Center, where she remains
in critical condition.</TE>
<TE>   Lindblad, 36, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. He
has been at the Central Detention Center in San Bernardino since
Wednesday. Bail was set at $500,000. Court records indicate Lindblad
has no significant criminal history.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said Sunday that they are also looking closely at
the possible involvement of Lindblad's parents.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives said they believe Lindblad confided in them, but it is
unclear how long they knew their son's girlfriend lay bleeding in the
garage of the Pelican Drive house.</TE>
<TE>   "Detectives are still investigation their criminal liability,"
said San Bernardino County sheriff's spokeswoman Robin Haynard. She
declined to release the names of Lindblad's parents.</TE>
<TE>   Haynard said she did not know what prompted the June 27 shooting
at the two-story home the couple shared.</TE>
<TE>   The house, near the edge of dried-out Baldwin Lake, sits away from
the bustling resort town of Big Bear Lake. The only visible structure
nearby is a stable that houses a petting zoo.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said no one apparently heard the shots fired at
Stebbins, critically wounding her.</TE>
<TE>   Lindblad, fearing he would be arrested, decided not to call 911,
authorities said. At some point, however, he did summon his parents,
who live nearby, Haynard said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they suspect that the parents helped Lindblad
set up his girlfriend on a mattress in the garage, where she was
cared for with gauze, soapy water and antiseptics.</TE>
<TE>   Haynard said Lindblad's father eventually told a family friend
about the shooting, prompting the friend to call paramedics, who
found Stebbins in grave condition.</TE>

<HD>Demographics of AIDS Shifting in the United States</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Stable rate of infection masks increase among
blacks, U.S. official tells conference.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BARCELONA, Spain</DL>
<LD>AIDS in the United States has changed dramatically in the last
decade, from an epidemic afflicting primarily gay and drug-using
white men to a scourge of the African American community,
participants in the 14th International AIDS Conference were told
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   About 15,000 scientists, educators, journalists and people living
with AIDS have gathered in this Mediterranean port city for the
weeklong conference, making it the largest such gathering ever.</LD>
<LD>   Addressing the opening session, Dr. Ronald Valdiserri of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the number of new HIV
infections in the U.S. has remained relatively constant, at about
40,000 a year since 1998. HIV is the virus that causes the AIDS
disease. But that apparent stability, he said, is masking a "slow but
steady increase" in the number of gay black men and heterosexual
black women who are contracting the disease.</LD>
<TE>   Fully 75% of all new HIV infections of heterosexuals in the U.S.
occur among African Americans, a "hugely disproportionate" number
considering that blacks represent only 12% of the U.S. population,
Valdiserri said.</TE>
<TE>   But the new data could be misleading, he cautioned. CDC figures
are based on data from 25 states where HIV infection reporting by
name has gone on for several years. But those states account for only
an estimated one-quarter of new HIV infections.</TE>
<TE>   They also do not include California, Florida and New York, which
are not only hotbeds of high-risk sexual behavior but also home to
much greater populations of blacks and Latinos, who are now bearing
the brunt of the epidemic.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very concerned that increases [in the HIV infection rate]
are just around the corner," he said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the new CDC data, as of June 2001, 793,026 AIDS cases
had been recorded in the United States since the epidemic began two
decades ago, with 457,667 deaths. The agency estimates that 850,000
Americans are living with an HIV infection but that as many as half
of them are undiagnosed, untreated or both.</TE>
<TE>   Although incomplete, the data from the 25 states provide a
"snapshot" of the AIDS epidemic today that can help in designing new
prevention programs, Valdiserri said:</TE>
<TE>   * Seven out of every 10 new victims of the virus are men.</TE>
<TE>   * Men who have sex with men represent 42% of the new cases,
heterosexuals of both sexes represent 33%, and injection-drug users
25%.</TE>
<TE>   * African Americans account for 54% of new infections, Caucasians
for 26%, Latinos 19% and others 1%. Like blacks, Latinos, who make up
less than 13% of the U.S. population, are disproportionately
affected.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing the limitations of the data from only 25 states, CDC
is organizing a new national system to more accurately estimate the
incidence of new infections. The program is being tested at five
sites and will be expanded nationally next year, Valdiserri said.</TE>
<TE>   The new data also showed that two-thirds of HIV-positive
individuals in the U.S. are sexually active and that, among those,
25% to 43%--depending on age and gender--practice unsafe sex at least
part of the time.</TE>
<TE>   Such numbers are potentially frightening, Valdiserri added,
because new treatments mean that the number of HIV-positive people is
continuing to grow, increasing the risk of transmission.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to renew HIV prevention in the United States," Valdiserri
said. "We need to get back to the level of collaboration, commitment
and concern that we saw in the first decade of the epidemic."</TE>

<HD>Trials Show Drug Is Effective for Resistant HIV Infections</HD>
<DH>Disease: T-20 offers an alternative approach to halting
AIDS virus' spread in the body.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BARCELONA, Spain</DL>
<LD>Trials of the first completely new AIDS drug in six years indicate it
is an effective weapon for treating HIV infections that are resistant
to other families of medications, researchers will report here today.</LD>
<LD>   The drug, called T-20, is the first member of a long-awaited
family of drugs called fusion inhibitors that block the entry of HIV
into cells. The four existing classes of drugs block enzymes that
enable the virus to replicate, so T-20 represents an alternative
approach to halting viral spread within the body.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers will report on two major trials of more than 1,000
patients who were not responding well to treatment with other AIDS
drugs. T-20 reduced blood virus levels by nearly three-quarters and
doubled the percentage of patients in which the virus fell to
undetectable levels, the teams will tell the 14th International AIDS
Conference.</LD>
<TE>   The results are considered quite powerful because the study was
conducted "among heavily treatment-experienced patients, a population
for whom treatment options are limited," Dr. Jay Lalezari of Quest
Clinical Research in San Francisco, who headed one of the studies,
said in an interview here. The findings are "exciting and
encouraging," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The drug is a "major step forward" in HIV treatment, added Dr.
Carl Dieffenbach of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases.</TE>
<TE>   T-20 was developed by Trimeris Inc. and will be marketed by
Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. Based on the test results, the companies hope
to obtain Food and Drug Administration approval for it by the end of
the year.</TE>
<TE>   There are 16 drugs in the four classes approved for treating HIV
infection. Three of the classes are different families of drugs that
block a crucial viral enzyme called reverse transcriptase. Members of
the fourth family block a second enzyme, called protease. Both
enzymes are crucial to viral replication within cells.</TE>
<TE>   T-20, in contrast, prevents the virus from entering cells, which
it does by fusing with the membrane of a target cell, a crucial step
in infection. That fusion is carried out by a viral protein called gp
41.</TE>
<TE>   The new drug is a small protein that blends with gp 41, thereby
preventing it from fusing with the cellular membrane. Because it is a
protein, however, T-20 cannot be given orally. Instead, it is
administered twice daily by injections.</TE>
<TE>   But also because it is a protein, the drug does not interfere with
cellular metabolic processes or interact with other AIDS medications,
said Dr. Dani Bolognesi, CEO of Trimeris. So there are very few side
effects, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the most common adverse effect has been a rash or other
mild reaction at the injection site. Only 3% of subjects chose to
discontinue drug use because of side effects.</TE>
<TE>   The subjects in the two studies had all been treated with an
average of 11 or 12 other AIDS drugs before entering the trials. For
each patient, physicians devised a regimen of three new AIDS drugs
that appeared to offer the best hope of reducing HIV. Half of these
patients received T-20 as well.</TE>
<TE>   After 24 weeks, 37% of the patients who received T-20 in one study
had undetectable blood levels of HIV, compared with 16% of those who
received just the three-drug cocktail. In the second study, the
corresponding figures were 28% and 14%. Patients in earlier studies
have sustained such reductions for 96 weeks or longer, said Dr. James
A. Thommes, medical director of Roche.</TE>

yelled.</LD>
<TE>   The riot was the latest example of the violence in Northern
Ireland that is jeopardizing the British-ruled province's peace
process under the 1998 Good Friday accord.</TE>
<TE>   The violence occurred during a march by about 1,300 members of the
hard-line Orange Order, named after Protestant King William of
Orange. The parade was the start of a week of Protestant celebrations
to mark William's Battle of the Boyne victory in 1690 over Catholic
King James II.</TE>
<TE>   Catholics view the marches as provocative "triumphalism."</TE>
<TE>   "We feel intimidated and aggrieved, locked into our own
community," said Joe Duffy, a leader of the Garvaghy Road Residents'
Coalition.</TE>

<HD>A Town's Nightmare Lingers</HD>
<DH>La Macarena was the capital of a guerrilla empire for three
years. Colombia's troops have ousted the rebels, but residents' fears
remain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LA MACARENA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>This little town on the edge of Colombia's lush eastern prairies
seems a place of secrets and unsettled accounts, a place just</LD>
<LD>   waking up from a dream--or perhaps a nightmare.</LD>
<LD>   For three years, it was the capital of a rebel empire, the
epicenter of a huge chunk of land ceded to leftist guerrillas by the
government for peace talks.</LD>
<TE>   During that time, the gun-toting guerrillas reigned supreme here,
dispensing justice, even building a prison camp nearby to hold
hundreds of Colombian soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   It was a place where the absurd became routine, where daily life
turned into an all-too-real "Fear Factor" episode: What must I do
today to survive?</TE>
<TE>   Both the kidnap victims and the guerrilla warlords who once held
them contributed money to build the handsome yellow church that
dominates the town square. It is a house of God built by money from
crime.</TE>
<TE>   The local high school lost half its soccer team. The players were
recruited along with other students to join the rebels, who were
seeking new and improved guerrillas, ones with enough education to
read and write.</TE>
<TE>   The guerrillas acted as judge, jury and executioner in a town that
lacked any other official authority. More than 140 locals once were
rounded up and held in squalid pens. Their alleged crimes? They had
stolen a rebel leader's prized hog, among other things. Killers
openly boasted of their intent to murder those deemed guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Now, four months after peace talks collapsed and the rebels fled,
fear still fills the dirt streets and cinder-block saloons, and
strange stories of the rebels' dystopia abound.</TE>
<TE>   This is perhaps one of the best places in Colombia to see the
warping influence that the grinding, 38-year-old guerrilla war has
had on a people, and a place. It's the Wild West meets Alice in
Wonderland, where the violent and the bizarre came together to
produce a surreal world.</TE>
<TE>   Here, the rebels were heroes who built roads, then later became
tyrants who murdered townspeople. The government consisted of distant
bureaucrats who abandoned the town, but later rescued it.</TE>
<TE>   "We just got used to it," said a doctor in town, who, like most
locals interviewed, did not want his name used. "Seeing a guerrilla
was like seeing a police officer."</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by Rebels</TE>
<TE>   La Macarena was one of five towns in a demilitarized zone about
four times the size of Los Angeles County that was created in 1998 to
spark peace talks with the rebels. The Colombian government pulled
out all symbols of state authority--the army, police and prosecutors,
leaving only civil officials such as mayors and town treasurers.</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, this dusty frontier town at first did well under
the guerrillas. The town had always been a favorite of Jorge Briceno,
the No. 2 commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC.</TE>
<TE>   Briceno, better known by the nom de guerre Mono Jojoy, built a
permanent base just outside town after the zone was established. It
had wooden barracks to hold 5,000 fighters, as well as computers and
space for warehouses--even a statue of one of the group's founders.</TE>
<TE>   It also would eventually be the place where hundreds of Colombian
soldiers and police officers were held captive in miserable
conditions until a prisoner exchange last year. They lived behind
barbed wire, some in wooden huts, some chained to trees. Many
suffered from malnutrition or malaria. The townspeople knew, but
could do nothing--there was no government to call, no police to
alert. Some of the soldiers are still in the hands of the FARC, now
approaching five years in captivity.</TE>
<TE>   Almost as soon as he arrived, Briceno set out to provide the one
thing the town had always lacked: transportation routes. The FARC
paid a contractor to build two dirt roads, one of them 60 miles long,
to connect La Macarena to larger towns nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, a voyage that had taken as long as two weeks by river
became a trip of a few days.</TE>
<TE>   Town leaders acknowledged that the roads also benefited the FARC,
improving their military mobility. But they credited the rebels with
achieving what the government had long failed to do.</TE>
<TE>   "During the detente, we benefited," said Father Ricardo
Cantalapiedra, the town priest. "The government had left this town
totally incommunicado."</TE>
<TE>   "If it's good, it's good, no matter who's doing it," he said of
the roads.</TE>
<TE>   Cantalapiedra's church benefited as well from the presence of the
guerrillas. The priest would often intervene on behalf of people
seized by the FARC, which kidnaps hundreds of wealthy and
middle-class Colombians each year. At least two of those families
expressed their gratitude by making sizable donations.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't stop there. Over the years, Cantalapiedra won the
respect of several of the FARC's top leaders. Jojoy himself gave
nearly $10,000 to help build the church, which by the standards of a
Colombian frontier town is a veritable cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   Permanent pews, soaring glass windows and a tiled floor grace the
church. The altar is adorned with a 15-foot-high triptych, the work
of a local muralist. One panel shows the Virgin Mary and Jesus as
peasants. Another--appropriately enough-- is a copy of "Crucifixion,"
by Spanish surrealist painter Salvador Dali.</TE>
<TE>   The final panel features a reinterpretation of Leonardo da Vinci's
"Last Supper." The disciples are Colombian peasants from different
provinces. Originally, the muralist had painted in Colombian
President Andres Pastrana and FARC leader Manuel Marulanda, leaning
toward each other to discuss peace.</TE>
<TE>   But Cantalapiedra thought a portrait of the guerrilla leader would
be a bit much in his church.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him to change it," he said of the muralist. The Marulanda
figure was transformed into a Roman Catholic priest.</TE>
<TE>   The guerrillas also helped the town's economy. They bought local
cattle and other foodstuffs to feed their troops. Bars were packed on
the weekends. This town of about a 1,000 people had two orthodontists
in a region where dentists are often scarce.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels filled the vacuum left by the departure of judicial and
police officials, sending a "judge" to town every 15 days or so to
deal with petty disputes between neighbors. The sentences were
usually fines or community service.</TE>
<TE>   They recruited children and teenagers to join their ranks. At one
point, the rebels focused their efforts on the high school, worried
that there were too few guerrillas who could read. The recruits--five
of them teenagers from the soccer team--joined a unit that came to be
known as "The High School Graduates Front."</TE>
<TE>   "All through the 3 1/2 years [of the zone], we had no problems. We
had good relations with them," Cantalapiedra said of the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   But, toward the end of the disastrous on-and-off-again peace
talks, things turned bad for the town.</TE>
<TE>   During one low point when the talks seemed about to rupture,
Cantalapiedra and community leader Cecilia Gallego arranged a deal
with the FARC. If the army stormed in and the guerrillas fled, the
townspeople would be allowed to strip the FARC camp of valuables left
behind.</TE>
<TE>   And so, when talks seemed to break down in January this year and
the guerrillas evacuated, the townspeople swarmed the camp. They
carted off computers, mattresses, about four tons of stored food.
They took Briceno's hog.</TE>
<TE>   At the last minute, the peace talks were saved. The rebels
returned and they were angry.</TE>
<TE>   Not only had the camp been looted, but during the mad dash,
someone had broken the statue of one of the group's founders, Jacobo
Arenas.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks that followed, the rebels arrested more than 140
townspeople and held them at their POW camp outside town.</TE>
<TE>   Just before trials began, Cantalapiedra struck a second deal. The
townspeople would return all the goods they had taken--replacing
chicken for chicken, computer for computer, pig for pig.</TE>
<TE>   The FARC agreed, and the townspeople dutifully fulfilled their end
of the bargain, delivering all of the goods to the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   Four days later, the peace talks collapsed again, this time for
good--and the rebels, apparently unmoved by the return of their
merchandise, came to settle scores against some of those who had
raided their camp.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrillas' Killing Spree</TE>
<TE>   They shot four people Feb. 24. They shot three more the next day,
including Gallego, who was dragged from her house as her children
watched and shot by guerrillas in her backyard.</TE>
<TE>   The guerrilla leader who carried out the killings moved openly
about town the day the slaughter began, even agreeing to meet for
lunch with a reporter in town to cover the collapse of the talks.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't show up for the interview, though. He was too busy
killing. His men shot one man through the head, then shouted out to
passersby that they had just killed a paramilitary.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, army troops finally showed up. The dead man's
wife saw them as she came back from the funeral.</TE>
<TE>   "You've come too late," she screamed in fury. Today, she says, she
trusts neither the guerrillas nor the government.</TE>
<TE>   But today, order at least has returned to La Macarena. Heavily
armed police stand on every other street corner.</TE>
<TE>   "With the guerrillas, there was a lot of fear," said one young
store clerk. "I feel safer now, because at least there's someone to
protect me."</TE>
<TE>   The people of La Macarena still haven't benefited from the rebel
booty. Although the town lacks computers, chairs and desks for the
community center, the attorney general has said all seized items are
state property that cannot be turned over without due process.</TE>
<TE>   That hasn't stopped the military, which has told the town that it
has "borrowed" some of the rebel goods for its soldiers. Talk about
town has it that the local army commander now sleeps on the
comfortable box springs and mattress that Briceno once used.</TE>
<TE>   The local police commander said people are slowly beginning to
trust the government again. But there is still a lot of work to be
done. Many fear that the army will leave and the town will be again
abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are very tense," the doctor said. "Now, we are a target
for the guerrillas."</TE>
<TE>   One of the roads the rebels were building remains unfinished, only
a few miles short of its destination. People are hoping the
government will complete it.</TE>
<TE>   There are still no local judges, no human rights officers, no
prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing," said army Capt. Ronald Pava, who has acted as
judge and jury for minor complaints the last few months. "This town
needs authority."</TE>
<TE>   The Colombian army has built a temporary base on the edge of town
near a gravel airstrip that it uses for operations against rebels.</TE>
<TE>   One day recently, army officials gathered at the town airport to
display the bodies of five rebels wrapped in green plastic whom they
had killed in a nearby town. One man had been shot in the head. A
second had a golf-ball-sized hole in his throat. A third, a
14-year-old girl, was killed when a bullet entered above her thigh
and exited her neck.</TE>
<TE>   The army, said Col. Carlos Villareal, was slowly clearing the area
of guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a slow job, not an easy one," Villareal said.</TE>
<TE>   At the corner of the airfield, the townspeople gathered. They
strained to see the bodies.</TE>
<TE>   They looked for their children.</TE>

<HD>Mine Blaze Kills at Least 33 in Ukraine</HD>
<DH>Disaster: The deaths 2,200 feet down are a dark reminder of
the coal industry's dismal safety record in the former Soviet
republic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Coal dust deep in a Ukrainian mine ignited Sunday, starting a fire
that killed at least 33 miners--the worst accident so far this year
in the former Soviet republic's troubled coal industry.</LD>
<LD>   Thirty of the miners were in a trolley that was descending into
the Ukraina mine in the town of Ukrainsk at 2:30 a.m. when the fire
broke out, said Col. Oleksey Pechenkin, spokesman for Ukraine's
Emergencies Ministry. Three other victims were found near where the
trolley had come to a halt, about 2,200 feet underground, he said.
One miner was missing.</LD>
<LD>   "No one is saying anything to us," a distraught woman--one of
dozens milling outside the mine's offices--told Russia's NTV network
while officials were still tallying the dead. "Three of them were
left down there, one foreman and two miners, but we still don't know
where they are. We hope they will come out safely."</LD>
<TE>   Firefighters were still battling the blaze Sunday evening. News
reports cited officials at the scene as saying that rescue workers
retrieving the bodies had to contend with temperatures inside the
shaft of more than 180 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Ukraine's coal industry has one of the world's worst safety
records. In the first six months of this year, 116 miners died in
job-related accidents, according to Ukraine's Labor Safety Committee.
More than 3,700 have died since Ukraine gained independence from the
Soviet Union in 1991. Critics estimate that six miners die for every
million tons of coal mined.</TE>
<TE>   Independent Ukraine's worst mining accident occurred in 2000, when
at least 80 miners were killed in a methane blast at the Barakova
mine in the Luhansk region.</TE>
<TE>   "After every such tragedy, people start saying that the country is
paying too high a price for this fuel, that the mines must be
closed," said Roman Sobel, a correspondent for Ukraine's One Plus One
TV channel. "But then some time goes by and they begin to
forget--until the next tragedy takes place."</TE>
<TE>   Some officials said the fire appeared to have begun at the top of
a conveyor belt, where coal dust had accumulated. Government
officials promised a full investigation and compensation for the
victims' families.</TE>
<TE>   The Ukrainsk blaze was the second coal mine fire of the weekend in
Ukraine. The first occurred Saturday in the Rodina mine near the
eastern city of Kryvyi Rih. Sixty miners evacuated without injury,
the Russian news agency Interfax reported.</TE>
<TE>   Working conditions in Ukraine's Soviet-era mines are dismal--and
worsened by a lethal combination of corroding equipment, extremely
deep shafts and shoddy safety procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Since June 4, a number of miners have camped out in the center of
the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, to demand unpaid wages. The protest,
which began with several dozen miners, has grown to about 200,
including several dozen conducting a hunger strike, according to
Ukrainian news reports.</TE>
<TE>   The worst single coal mine accident in recent years occurred in
March 1992, when 263 people were killed in a gas explosion at the
Kozlu mine on Turkey's Black Sea coast.</TE>
<TE>   Yakov Ryzhak of The Times' Moscow Bureau contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>Some in Japan Are Gladly Working for 'Peanuts'</HD>
<DH>Money: Amid prolonged economic slump, community currency
programs based on favors keep popping up across the nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Recently, 80-year-old Michiko Bito provided advice and moral support
to a neighbor on the tiny island of Okamura who was having family
troubles. A few days later, when Bito needed help getting cat food
from the mainland, she asked another neighbor to pitch in.</LD>
<LD>   The favors were negotiated using an informal local currency known
as dan-dans, regional dialect for "thanks again."</LD>
<LD>   Over the last 18 months, more than 100 community currency programs
have sprung up across Japan, ranging in scope from a few dozen people
on Okamura to the 90,000 members in Yamato City outside Tokyo.</LD>
<TE>   These trading systems--which allow neighbors to trade good deeds
among themselves that in some cases can be redeemed for discounts in
local shops--represent Japan's latest bid to revitalize its local
economies, jump-start volunteerism and boost communication.</TE>
<TE>   Local is very much the watchword. Chiba's "peanuts" are named
after the area's most prominent crop. The currency traded near Lake
Biwa in central Japan is made of clay found near the shore. Other
regions exchange disks cut from local trees or swatches of regional
silks. Then there's Yamato's "love" currency, a name that has left
some of the locals shaking their heads.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 44 years old, and I must admit I feel a bit awkward talking
about giving my 'love' to a customer or taking their 'love,' " says
Takashi Uchida, vice chairman of Yamato's Nijodori Shopping Assn.
"Personally, I think the name's a bit funny."</TE>
<TE>   Japan's love affair with community currencies dates to 1973, when
a women's group in Osaka created a "Volunteer Labor Bank" designed to
value unpaid housework, says Rui Izumi, a professor at Tsuru
University.</TE>
<TE>   Okamura's dan-dan program got started in 1995 as a way to improve
communication between different generations on the isolated island in
the Seto Inland Sea and keep young people from moving away.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized even though many of our villagers were old, they had
so much to give," says area resident Masako Kubota. "This allowed
them to teach young people to wear kimono in exchange for perhaps
being driven for checkups or shopping."</TE>
<TE>   These were largely isolated efforts, however, until 1999, when a
network television show and book on the subject catapulted the idea
into the mainstream. Some predict that the number of community
currency programs could triple in coming years.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts cite several reasons for the concept's growing popularity
now. The Asian currency crisis and prolonged economic downturn have
fueled distrust in some quarters of traditional market mechanisms,
they argue. "There's been a recognition that materialism hasn't
necessarily brought happiness," says Terue Ohashi, a marketing
professor with Reitaku University.</TE>
<TE>   Higher unemployment and more early retirement here have also
spurred more interest in and time for volunteerism. And a parade of
national scandals is prompting more people to focus on local
community activities, where they can exert greater control and
influence.</TE>
<TE>   "Society has become more faceless and meaningless," says Ikuma
Saga, an analyst with the Japan Sogo Research Institute. "People are
reaching for something that seems real."</TE>
<TE>   The absolute number of traders remains small, and few expect
community currencies to knock Japan's central bank out of business.
But advocates say the grass-roots programs offer something the mighty
yen can't: a way to break the ice between strangers in a culture
famous for its formality and reserve.</TE>
<TE>   Kazuhiko Murayama, an urban planning consultant who started
Chiba's peanuts currency in early 2000, is an enthusiastic crusader
for a kinder, gentler Japan. His original vision called for peanuts
users to hug each other, but he eventually settled on a handshake and
a cry of "amigo" by all parties involved at the end of each
transaction.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not been in the Japanese tradition to touch each other,"
Murayama says. "By using a foreign word like 'amigo,' I thought it
would be easier for people to accept a new approach. It's a tool for
communicating and breaking down walls."</TE>
<TE>   Don't expect button-down Japanese to turn into kissy-kissy
Europeans any time soon, however. "Shaking hands is a good idea, but
I don't think hugging will catch on," says Makoto Maruyama,
international social science professor at Tokyo University. "Some
people even say shaking hands is too much, that the whole thing looks
a bit like a religious ritual."</TE>
<TE>   Octogenarian widow Bito and others steeped in traditional Japanese
village life sometimes find it a bit sad that modern Japanese need
peanuts or silks or even "love" credits to remember to be nice to
each other.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts say that, like it or not, the world is addicted to
tabs, trading and tallies. "Once people get used to using money in a
modern economy, they can't go back to old traditions," Maruyama says.
"These allow them to use currencies while learning a different way of
doing things."</TE>
<TE>   While community currencies are found around the world, what's
arguably different in Japan is the expectation in some communities
that the modest trading plans can significantly boost local
economies. Many small shopping districts, known in Japan as
shotengai, have embraced them as a weapon against the large discount
shopping malls sprouting around them.</TE>
<TE>   "The shotengai are in crisis," says Takashi Kobayashi, a local
Yamato official. "This is a way to help preserve Japanese tradition."</TE>
<TE>   This may be asking too much of community money, given the parade
of economic policies Japan has tried and failed at over the last
decade. Furthermore, say nonprofit groups, the growing number of
local currency programs being administered by bureaucrats threatens
to weaken the spirit of volunteerism and grass-roots glue that has
made the smaller examples successful.</TE>
<TE>   Still, supporters say, anything that improves communication can't
be all bad.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what all the fuss is about," Bito says. "What we're
doing isn't so great. We're just trying to help each other out."</TE>

<HD>Afghan Official Is Laid to Rest</HD>
<DH>Asia: Ten guards assigned to slain Vice President Haji
Abdul Qadir are arrested. President Hamid Karzai vows to find his
killers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Thousands of Afghans mourned assassinated Vice President Haji Abdul
Qadir on Sunday as Afghan President Hamid Karzai vowed to track down
the killers.</LD>
<LD>   Qadir's coffin, draped in flower-strewn velvet and flanked by two
Afghan flags, was followed into Kabul's Eid Gha mosque by Karzai and
former President Burhanuddin Rabbani.</LD>
<LD>   Qadir, a former anti-Soviet moujahedeen leader in eastern
Afghanistan, was shot dead Saturday as he drove away from his office
in the center of Kabul, the capital.</LD>
<TE>   No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, but police have
arrested 10 security guards who were supposed to have been keeping
watch when Qadir was gunned down. Karzai will call for foreign help
in cracking the case if local authorities are unable to make progress
in their own investigation, Afghan television reported Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   While calling Qadir's death "a loss for which there is no
compensation," Karzai said the slaying would not be allowed to
destabilize the country's fragile, multi-ethnic government.</TE>
<TE>   "In the course of history, such things happen. But it doesn't
weaken the Afghan will for peace and stability. It strengthens it,"
Karzai said.</TE>
<TE>   Some angry mourners from Afghanistan's Pushtun majority said they
believed that rival ethnic Tajik forces--possibly inside the
government's Tajik-controlled security establishment--were behind the
killing.</TE>
<TE>   Others said the assassination could lead to violent retaliation by
Pushtun groups.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a huge blow to the country, and people are very upset,"
said Bashir, a teacher from Jalalabad, Qadir's home base. "This will
cause big complications for establishing peace and security. The
situation is potentially very dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   "We of the eastern tribes demand that Karzai find these killers
and put them on trial," said Mohammed Jabbarkhel, a Pushtun from
Laghman province, whose voice rose with agitation as he spoke after
the ceremony. "We have had many martyrs, and now our leader has been
killed. We want revenge."</TE>
<TE>   After the ceremony, Qadir's body was flown to Jalalabad, where
late Sunday afternoon, he was buried outside a mosque, surrounded by
more than 10,000 men, many of whom wept and shouted in anguish.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, U.S. lawmakers said Qadir's assassination should
compel the United States to consider an active role in providing
security. U.S. operations have been directed at pursuing Taliban and
Al Qaeda fugitives, rather than peacekeeping. The international
community has rejected appeals from Karzai to dispatch peacekeepers
beyond the capital.</TE>
<TE>   "This was definitely a throwback to the old Afghanistan and a
setback to the establishment of the new Afghanistan," Sen. Bob Graham
(D-Fla.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on
NBC's "Meet the Press."</TE>
<TE>   Charles Hagel (R-Neb.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, concurred, saying on the same program that the United
States would need to have "a long-term, sustained, strong leadership
position" to stabilize the area.</TE>
<TE>   "If we lose there, if this goes backward, this will be a huge
defeat for us symbolically in that region, in the world," he said.
"We cannot allow this to go down."</TE>

<HD>London's Sparrows in Free Fall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>They disappeared so quietly that few noticed them go, nor perceived
the silence they left beneath the thrumming layers of city noise.</LD>
<LD>   In their dusty gray-and-brown jackets, house sparrows were so
common that their steep slide in major British and Irish cities went
unremarked for years.</LD>
<LD>   "The decline has been massive. In London, Glasgow, Edinburgh,
Dublin, the population has fallen by 99% since 1980," said Dennis
Summers-Smith, one of the world's leading sparrow experts. "This is
almost extinction."</LD>
<TE>   The house sparrow will go on Britain's endangered species "red
list" this year. Yet it is still officially a pest that can be
exterminated. In fact, sparrow-proof bird feeders are still sold in
London.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., the birds are often seen as a kind of feathered
mice--not just drab and dull birds, but invaders. Yet Londoners have
a special affection for these perky little creatures, which were
always a garrulous companion to the city's cockneys, no matter how
humble the garden.</TE>
<TE>   And British bird-watchers drift out of their serious, scientific
commentaries into sentimental reflections on sparrows' antics and
their affinity with people.</TE>
<TE>   The fate of the sparrow has ornithologists mystified, and the
Independent newspaper has offered a epartment5,000 [$7,600] reward to solve
the puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   "There are lots of theories but no good answers yet," said Keith
Noble, London sparrows officer for Britain's Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds. He cited food shortages, predators, changes in
farming methods and pollution as possible causes for the birds'
disappearance. Summers-Smith warns that the decline of the sparrow
may point to dangers for humans not just in London, but in major
cities everywhere. The numbers of sparrows are dropping in many large
European cities as well as the big cities in Britain, he points out.</TE>
<TE>   "If one bird declines dramatically, something funny is going on,
and since most of us live in cities, I think we ought to know why
it's happening," Summers-Smith said by phone from his home in
northern England.</TE>
<TE>   "Birds are indicators of the quality of life,'' he said. "Is the
house sparrow the modern equivalent of the miners' canary, telling us
something nasty is going on in our cities?"</TE>
<TE>   The sparrow population in Britain is reported to be 673,000, a 57%
drop since 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Squinting at the pockmarked walls of one of London's most famous
landmarks, the Tower of London, sparrow researcher Sandy Alcorn, 48,
strained to hear the once common chirrup.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, she counted eight sparrow nests in and around the
tower, this year only four.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe when I come back this time next year, there'll be no
sparrows left here," she said. In 1925, ornithologist Max Nicholson,
21, counted 2,603 sparrows in central London's Kensington Gardens.
This summer, only four male sparrows found their way into the park,
and not one found a mate.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, there were hatchlings, but none survived.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson also believes that the decline of the sparrow contains a
vital message for humans. Speaking at his Chelsea home, he said
humans are less sensitive than birds to environmental changes.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were like 17th century Londoners and could never get out of
here, we'd be less happy to live here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When Nicholson started counting sparrows nearly eight decades ago,
the bird was so common it was ignored by most ornithologists.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knew the sparrow, of course. Very few paid much
critical attention. Even among the bird-watchers it was considered
rather boring. You went out and found rare birds in the Highlands
rather than spending your time on sparrows in London," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the sparrow [numbers] as being on the crest of a wave,'' he
said. "The idea that the sparrow would practically disappear from
London never occurred to us.''</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of Londoners are taking part in a survey--sponsored by
the London Biodiversity Partnership, a coalition made up of the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds and other wildlife and ecological
groups--to count sparrows in their neighborhoods. The aim is to find
pockets where the bird is more plentiful and uncover clues as to why.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda Rudd, a project manager at the London Wildlife Trust, said
people were so used to thinking of the bird as common that their
disappearing act took the city by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "But when you ask people, 'When was the last time you saw one?'
they say, 'I don't remember,' '' she said.</TE>
<TE>   The house sparrow also is declining sharply in the U.S., but there
is no alarm among American ornithologists because the bird is an
imported species: 100 house sparrows were brought to Brooklyn in 1851
and 1852, while others were introduced to San Francisco and Salt Lake
City in 1873 and 1874.</TE>
<TE>   "Folks have generally frowned upon it [the sparrow]," said Keith
Pardieck, head of the North American Breeding Bird Survey at the
Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland. He confirmed a 2.5%
annual decline in the house sparrow population since 1966.</TE>
<TE>   If the bird were native, people would be alarmed, he said, calling
the sparrow "an invasive species.''</TE>
<TE>   The number of sparrows in North America is estimated at 150
million, according to the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson said the sparrow was introduced to Britain about 400
years ago, coming from India and South Asia through Iran and Turkey
to Vienna and other parts of Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Sanderson, 72, who bands the legs of birds to identify and
track them, followed the fortunes of the four unlucky male sparrows
in Kensington Gardens this summer. He decided against banding them in
case it disturbed them.</TE>
<TE>   "The sparrow followed man around the world. It's always been at
man's right arm," he said. "Now it's turning its back on us. I think
it's very important to know why.</TE>
<TE>   "The sparrow's become important because it's created a mystery.
We're still hoping that someone will take this on as a challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the mystery and the importance to humans of knowing the
answer, there is, to sparrow watchers here, a pathos about the
disappearance of a bird so identified with London and so taken to
heart by the East End's cockneys.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a part of London folklore, the sparrow. It was the cockney
'sparrer.' The East Enders didn't see a lot of birds, but the sparrow
was always around in their gardens," Sanderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Alcorn never took much notice of the bird until she began studying
the Tower of London sparrows and two other colonies in East London
for a diploma in ecology and conservation at Birkbeck College in
London 18 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   "You start out mildly interested and end up obsessed," she
confessed. "You've heard of the cockney sparrow, small and perky but
big personality. They're very entertaining to watch. They're funny
little fellows. I think the city would be a very dull place without
them.</TE>
<TE>   "There are kids now in London who don't know what a sparrow looks
like, and I think that's sad. If I was raising kids in London, I'd be
thinking, 'If it isn't habitable by birds, is it habitable by
people?' ''</TE>
<TE>   Alcorn took a British television documentary crew to observe the
Tower of London sparrows last year, and it was like tracking a rare
jungle bird: They waited 2 1/2 hours to spot one.</TE>
<TE>   But this month the sparrows were out, pecking the seed heads of
summer grass, chirruping loudly, with heads cocked fetchingly.</TE>
<TE>   "This little guy took food from my hand last week and the week
before," Alcorn said. "They are cute, aren't they? It's not just me."</TE>
<TE>   To Alcorn's chagrin, most of the 12 to 15 young sparrows that
hatched this summer near the tower were either eaten, died or flew
off. She finds it alarming that such an adaptable and intelligent
bird is now in such a precarious situation.</TE>
<TE>   "This little fellow is tough and a survivor if ever there was
one," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She has seen sparrows pluck insects from spiders' webs and car
radiators, nip food from pigeons' beaks and copy other birds pecking
the tops of milk bottles.</TE>
<TE>   One theory for their disappearance is that their favorite nesting
places--holes and cracks in roofs--have become scarce because modern
roofing materials are tougher than they used to be. But Sanderson
said there were plenty of nesting sites in Kensington Gardens this
year, and Alcorn said the Tower of London also afforded plenty of
roosting places.</TE>
<TE>   Another theory is scarcity of food because farmers plow and sow
crops twice a year, instead of only once, meaning that fields don't
lie fallow providing winter food. Other theories include predators, a
mystery virus, or competition for food from other species.</TE>
<TE>   Summers-Smith discounted these theories. There were no large
numbers of corpses that would suggest a virus, he explained. And
sparrows remain common in small towns close to farmland, predators
and other species competing for food.</TE>
<TE>   His theory is that toxic emissions of lead-free gasoline,
introduced in London in 1989, may be killing off insects, the only
food that baby sparrows can eat.</TE>
<TE>   With millions of birds in other parts of the world, why not simply
transfer birds to London to replace the sparrows, if Londoners feel
so strongly about them?</TE>
<TE>   Alcorn said that even if sparrows could be transferred to London,
they would probably face the same fate as the few remaining in the
city. Like other sparrow populations, they would gradually disappear.
Summers-Smith agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not addressing the problem," he said. "It's only addressing
the symptoms. We've got to understand what's happening."</TE>

<HD>After a Life in the Fields, Farm Workers Looking for a
Place to Call Their Own</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIO</DL>
<LD>After long seasons of stooping in the fields and rising ahead of the
Coachella Valley sun to gather grapes and pluck tomatoes, 90-year-old
Maria Rodriguez still gets up each morning itching to work the
harvest.</LD>
<LD>   But the harvest these days is gleaned from a backyard garden
behind her apartment building, a housing project where she and other
retired farm workers putter in the triple-digit heat just like other
desert retirees.</LD>
<LD>   In the middle of the sunbaked scrubland on the outskirts of Indio,
the Desert Gardens Apartments is one of only a handful of
developments in California dedicated to those who have spent their
lives cultivating crops for others.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly half the 88 units at the peach-colored project are reserved
for retired field hands, providing a low-cost haven for people who in
their old age often tend to be among the poorest of the poor,
unprotected by such safeguards as pension plans or retirement
packages.</TE>
<TE>   "After all of their years in the fields, it is important that
elderly workers have a place to live," said Rodriguez, who is the
oldest resident and one of the first at Desert Gardens. She moved to
the complex when it opened 3 1/2 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   There has been a long tradition of immigrant farm workers from
Mexico and elsewhere returning to their homeland or moving in with
family after leaving the fields for good.</TE>
<TE>   But that is beginning to change, labor leaders and housing
advocates say.</TE>
<TE>   Many retired laborers are choosing to stay near the farms where
they toiled, having raised their children and planted roots in this
country. And many end up living alone, some by choice and others by
necessity.</TE>
<TE>   "In another 10 to 20 years, there are going to be hundreds of
thousands of Latinos entering their golden years," said Paul Chavez,
son of the late United Farm Workers founder Cesar Chavez. "It's going
to be a critical issue and one we've got to be prepared to deal with
head-on."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez is president of the UFW's nonprofit National Farm Workers
Service Center, which has overseen construction of 600 single-family
homes and more than 2,000 rental units in California, Arizona and
Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The UFW, in fact, helped pioneer the concept of housing for
elderly farm workers, opening the Paulo Agbayani retirement village
in 1974. The 58-unit project in Delano was built for retired Filipino
laborers who worked the fields and manned the picket lines during the
Central Valley grape strikes of the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   That project has all but shut down now as the original residents
have died, but the UFW housing group opened another project in Delano
in 1999. While not exclusively for farm workers, most residents at
the 80-unit senior housing complex have worked the fields at some
time in their lives.</TE>
<TE>   The same is true for a 75-unit senior housing project in Fresno
opened in 1988 by another nonprofit, SER-Jobs For Progress. A third
of the units are set aside for retired farm workers. But because the
complex is surrounded by farms, more than half the residents are
former field hands, said Rebecca Mendibles, executive director of
SER's Fresno office.</TE>
<TE>   "We operate that project as a true nonprofit because we know the
people are on true fixed incomes," Mendibles said of the complex,
where rent is $420 a month and hasn't gone up in more than a decade.
"We just recognize that the need is so great."</TE>
<TE>   A national study revealed the problem more than a decade ago,
chronicling an elderly population plagued by poverty and largely
hidden from public view.</TE>
<TE>   The study, conducted by the Washington, D.C.-based Housing
Assistance Council, found that older farm workers were often
ineligible for federally subsidized housing because of their
immigration status or the rules governing such projects. And many
were found to be ineligible for Social Security benefits, a dilemma
officials attribute to the practice of paying farm workers in cash.</TE>
<TE>   The study also found that older farm workers were frequently too
frail to join their families on the migrant work trail, likely to
earn less in the fields than their younger counterparts and often
forced to retire early because of the hard work and health problems
associated with stoop labor.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Belden, deputy executive director of the Housing Assistance
Council and the study's principal author, said he is aware of little
updated research on the subject since the study was published in
1990. But he doubts much has changed.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the old cliches, like we saw in 'Harvest of Shame' 40
years ago, are still true today," said Belden, referring to Edward R.
Murrow's groundbreaking 1960 television documentary on the dismal
conditions facing the nation's farm workers.</TE>
<TE>   "We go to the grocery store to put fruit and vegetables on our
tables, but we don't always stop to think that there is someone
responsible for harvesting our food," he added. "Why shouldn't there
be some consideration for the people who have spent their lives doing
that?"</TE>
<TE>   John Mealey asked the same question a decade ago when he first
proposed providing a soft landing for this group of workers. As
executive director of the Coachella Valley Housing Coalition, Mealey
and others at the nonprofit group had become alarmed by the early
1990s at the number of older farm workers living in substandard, and
often unsafe, conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Many inhabited the scores of illegal trailer parks that had sprung
up like weeds across the lower half of the valley, partly in response
to the closure of grower-run labor camps.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of seniors ended up getting trapped in these places," said
Mealey, who as head of the group since its inception in 1982 has
overseen construction of more than 2,000 houses and rental units for
low-income residents throughout Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   With a $350,000 loan, the Coachella Valley Housing Coalition
bought the land for Desert Gardens in 1992 and embarked on a six-year
building campaign.</TE>
<TE>   All but $1 million for the $6.5-million project came from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's farm labor housing program, and it took
years for the funding to arrive. Residents started moving into the
complex in late 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "We're basically talking about a hidden population, a generation
that has always taken care of itself," Mealey said. "They've toughed
it out all of their lives and aren't very likely to go around asking
for help."</TE>
<TE>   There is plenty of help available at Desert Gardens. Residents can
get assistance paying their utility bills and get their meals
delivered. Bus service is available for special activities and a
counselor from the local school district shows up regularly to
provide information about everything from how to learn English to how
to obtain citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Home-care aides are available to elderly residents who need help
with domestic chores, and social workers from the Catholic Charities
office in Indio keep an eye out for seniors in the area who might
benefit from living at the complex, where rent is limited to 30% of a
tenant's income.</TE>
<TE>   That's how 74-year-old Federico Sanchez ended up at Desert Gardens
last summer. The former farm worker lost his home after Riverside
County authorities red-tagged the rundown trailer park where he
lived. He stayed in a convalescent home for a year because there was
no other place for him to go.</TE>
<TE>   Then Catholic Charities found him a studio apartment at Desert
Gardens, where the air conditioners hum all day this time of year and
the community garden grows tall with roses and cactus and a
cornucopia of fruits and vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   "In this area there are many people like me who can't find
housing," he said. "I was very fortunate to have this place."</TE>

<LD>The FBI is trying to enhance a security videotape from a parking lot
half a mile from the Salt Lake City home where 14-year-old Elizabeth
Smart was taken from her bedroom at gunpoint.</LD>
<LD>   The videotape from Shriners Hospital shows two cars meeting in the
parking lot hours before Smart disappeared June 5. A security guard
described one driver as vaguely similar to the man Elizabeth's sister
saw in their shared bedroom that night.</LD>
<LD>   Officials are reconstructing a one-minute portion of the tape, FBI
special agent Kevin Eaton said. The crime lab is expected to extract

<DL></DL>
<LD>Opponents of a plan to bury nuclear waste in Nevada rallied in Las
Vegas and called on the U.S. Senate to reject the Yucca Mountain
proposal during a vote that could come this week.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a huge public health issue for the entire country," said
Deborah Huber, one of about 175 protesters. "They talk about homeland
security, but transporting this across the country is a terrorists'
dream come true."</LD>
<LD>   The government has spent $7 billion over two decades studying
Yucca Mountain, 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, as the preferred
site to bury 77,000 tons of waste accumulating at nuclear power
reactors in 31 states.</LD>
<TE>   A final decision on whether the project will go forward or be
scrapped rests with Congress.</TE>

<HD>Squaring Off Over Nominee</HD>
<DH>Senate: As hearings on Bush's pick for surgeon general
near, there are many allies and critics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN-EVE PEDERSEN and MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>TUCSON</DL>
<LD>When Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson first sat
down to talk with Richard Carmona about becoming surgeon general, the
candidate seemed almost too good to be true.</LD>
<LD>   An up-from-nothing New York City street kid from Harlem. A high
school dropout turned decorated Vietnam War veteran turned trauma
surgeon. A moonlighting SWAT team member who shot a suspect dead to
protect others and dangled from a helicopter in a daring
mountain-side rescue.</LD>
<LD>   White House aides touted the father of four, married to his high
school sweetheart, as a real-life Indiana Jones.</LD>
<TE>   "You interview this guy, and it's like reading a novel," Thompson
told reporters gathered for the White House announcement of Carmona's
nomination in March. "I said, 'Are you really real?' And he said,
'Absolutely.' "</TE>
<TE>   But a close look at Carmona's extraordinary career, based on
dozens of interviews and hundreds of documents, reveals a more
complex answer to that question. With his Senate confirmation
hearings set to begin Tuesday, many who know him well, here in his
adopted hometown, say they know another side of the man:</TE>
<TE>   An administrator who was forced out of two top management jobs. A
boss who had an uncommon rapport with patients but infuriated
colleagues. A surgeon who took years to earn board certification. A
combination doctor and sheriff's deputy whose exploits were not quite
as sensational as the newspaper accounts.</TE>
<TE>   A larger-than-life personality, he has left in his wake many
bruised egos and hard feelings. His critics point out that he has
benefited at many turns in his life from rules being bent in his
favor. He got into medical school without a college degree. He became
a sheriff's deputy without taking the examination. He ran a trauma
unit for eight years even though he hadn't passed board exams.</TE>
<TE>   But he also made staunch allies. When his job was eliminated as
head of Tucson Medical Center's trauma unit in 1993, he sued for
breach of contract, eventually winning a multimillion-dollar
settlement and a full-page apology in a local newspaper from hospital
officials. The judge who mediated the settlement, Larry Fleischman,
ended up a good friend. He dismissed controversies that have followed
Carmona throughout his two decades here as rooted in envy and
jealousy.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes the story is that there is no story," said Fleischman,
now a lawyer in private practice. "He is the real deal."</TE>
<TE>   A number of Carmona's former co-workers and employees, however,
describe a man whose instinct is to escalate hostilities rather than
resolve them. When President Bush said at the White House nomination
ceremony that Carmona would bring "a strong management background" as
head of the 5,600-member corps of public health officers, former
colleagues interviewed here say they were stunned.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns about Carmona's professional record led one Tucson doctor
to write to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), the chairman of the
committee reviewing Carmona's nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Charles W. Putnam, a University of Arizona surgery professor who
has worked with Carmona, told Kennedy in the letter that he did not
want as his surgeon general someone "who was removed from his two
previous administrative appointments ... because he could not work in
an effective or even a civil manner with health professionals and
other constituencies of those positions."</TE>
<TE>   Carmona, on standard White House orders to nominees, has declined
interviews before his confirmation hearing.</TE>
<TE>   It is clear that Carmona, 52, had a rocky tenure in Arizona--first
as the head of Tucson Medical Center's trauma unit, and later as head
of Kino Community Hospital and then the entire Pima County health
system.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona has acknowledged in interviews that not everyone likes
him. Some former supervisors and colleagues, however, say the
conflicts have been more than simple personality clashes.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions between Carmona and others at Tucson Medical Center began
soon after he was hired in 1985 to help start the hospital's trauma
unit, eventually becoming one of only two hospitals here designated
to treat the most severe injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Within a year, Carmona sued the hospital over the terms of his
contract. The disagreement was resolved out of court, and Carmona
stayed on, earning a reputation that led hospital officials to
"strategize" how to deal with "issues with our street fighter,"
according to a hospital memo.</TE>
<TE>   Several people who clashed with Carmona, contacted for this
report, refused to speak on the record, citing Carmona's reputation
for suing or threatening to sue people he believed had wronged him.</TE>
<TE>   Court and hospital records show a history of conflicts between
Carmona and other doctors, who complained about his lack of
cooperation, "high handedness," "unwillingness to communicate" and
"his escalation of disagreements in an effort to prove he was right."</TE>
<TE>   In one case, hospital administrators cited his "bullying" of a
nurse who said he failed to diagnose a young boy's skull fracture in
1991. Carmona demanded Angie Calvino's resignation after she
complained to colleagues about his medical judgment, rather than
reporting her concerns to the hospital's confidential peer review
committee, court records show.</TE>
<TE>   In a mediated agreement, Calvino agreed to a demotion if Carmona
did not report her to the State Nursing Board for not following
protocol, according to those familiar with the case. However, court
records show that a few months later Carmona did report her, and
Calvino remained demoted.</TE>
<TE>   In his court filings, Carmona had his own complaints about the
workplace.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona, of Puerto Rican descent, alleged age and racial
discrimination against himself and others. He filed a civil rights
complaint with the Arizona attorney general's office saying race was
used as a factor when his job was eliminated--allegations he later
dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Also an ongoing issue between Carmona and the hospital was the
status of his board certification for general surgery, which he did
not receive until May 1993, eight years after he had finished his
residency. Typically, physicians pass the examinations within a year
or two.</TE>
<TE>   Individuals who have reviewed Carmona's records say he failed the
exam twice before passing it. Carmona responded through
administration officials that he passed within the window allowed by
board rules.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, legal documents show Carmona sought certification in
another field--emergency medicine--but his application failed because
of a dispute concerning board guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   In a sworn statement, Carmona said he had worked 5,000 hours as an
emergency physician. When the American Board of Emergency Medicine
sought to verify those hours with Keith Kaback, the hospital's
medical director of emergency services, Kaback replied that Carmona
had worked virtually no hours as an emergency physician.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona, through administration officials, said he was encouraged
by another hospital official to apply because he had done most of his
work as a trauma surgeon in the emergency room. But board officials
said, because emergency doctors must treat a wide range of ailments,
their guidelines clearly state that doctors who are called to the
emergency room for specific cases may not count those hours toward
qualification.</TE>
<TE>   HHS spokesman Bill Pierce said Carmona's application had been
preliminarily approved until another doctor who had been competitive
with him--an apparent reference to Kaback--wrote to the board and
complained.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the hospital decided to eliminate Carmona's job in
preparation for merging its money-losing trauma program with nearby
University Medical Center's. An interoffice memo that predates his
July 1993 departure indicates that some University Medical Center
officials preferred not to deal with Carmona. But the decision was
unpopular with his patients, who rallied in his defense, some
comparing him to a saint.</TE>
<TE>   He sued and prevailed on grounds that his contract guaranteed
lifetime employment unless he was removed for cause, winning a
confidential settlement and a printed public apology. People familiar
with the settlement say a media report of a $3.9-million award is "in
the ballpark."</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Carmona was hired as chief executive officer and
medical director of Kino Community Hospital in Tucson. There he
clashed repeatedly with the hospital's longtime chief of surgery,
Eric Ramsay. They fought over staffing and the residency program.
Internal memos made available to The Times also show that Carmona
chastised Ramsay for maintaining offices that were "dirty and unkempt
without the slightest bit of an attempt to tidy" them.</TE>
<TE>   After working under Carmona for a year Ramsay resigned, ending a
37-year association with the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "Never in my entire medical career have I seen such gross
interference by a hospital administrator without the slightest
attempt to reach a cooperative understanding," Ramsay said in a
letter to Carmona dated March 7, 1996, the day he quit. "Clearly you
need a lot of help and instruction in how to manage your current
position for which you have had no training or previous experience."</TE>
<TE>   Carmona also battled with home health-care workers over a proposal
to cut their hourly wages from $10 to as little as $6 an hour. After
the workers complained publicly--noting that Carmona recently had
raised the pay of top aides--he issued a warning.</TE>
<TE>   In a memo, Carmona threatened to transfer their work to the
private sector if the aides continued "to maliciously and falsely
spread rumors ... in hopes of discrediting us and/or destabilizing
our organization." The Tucson Weekly printed excerpts from the memo
after he threatened to sue them for saying he retaliated against
dissidents.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his problems at Kino, Carmona was promoted in 1997 to
oversee the entire Pima County health system, but within two years,
he had lost the confidence of county health commissioners. In the
year before Carmona's negotiated resignation in July 1999, the
financially strapped public hospital, which serves a largely indigent
population, was running a monthly deficit of more than $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona and "his top management team were simply not prepared to
do what needed to be done," said Joel Meister, then a member of the
Pima County Health Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona's supporters, however, said he was unfairly blamed for a
long-troubled system.</TE>
<TE>   His final battle there came in a dispute in May 1999 with county
health commissioner Sylvia Campoy, who had reported to the county
attorney allegations that a Kino doctor with a drug abuse problem had
written false prescriptions to access drugs.Carmona had already dealt
with the doctor on the issue two years before, and after an internal
investigation, encouraged the doctor to report himself to the Board
of Medical Examiners.</TE>
<TE>   After Campoy reported the allegations, Carmona became irate,
saying she had violated the accused doctor's confidentiality, an
opinion shared by the Kino Community Hospital board and the Pima
County Medical Society.</TE>
<TE>   "What I got from Dr. Carmona [after reporting the case] was
antagonism and ... threats," Campoy later told an investigator from
the Arizona Department of Public Safety's prescription fraud unit,
according to a state Board of Medical Examiners document obtained
through Arizona's public records law. "I was screamed at, I was
yelled at. I was told it was none of my business. I was told that I
had breached peer review."Throughout the turmoil at his day jobs,
Carmona served another highly public role as a part-time SWAT
surgeon--a job that added tales of heroism to his resume, but was not
without controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona joined as a volunteer in 1987. Four years later, Pima
County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik requested and received a waiver from
the Arizona Law Enforcement Officer Advisory Council allowing Carmona
to become a commissioned deputy without taking the proficiency
examination normally required of those who did not attend an academy.</TE>
<TE>   Dupnik, council officials said, successfully argued that Carmona's
role would be primarily medical: on hand to provide top-flight care
"should an officer, suspect or victim sustain an injury."</TE>
<TE>   But in several high-profile cases--before the waiver was granted
and after the fact--Carmona acted exclusively as an armed law
enforcement officer.</TE>
<TE>   At the scene of a SWAT standoff with a suicidal man in 1988,
Carmona and another deputy were the first to rush the man after he
was shot by a police sharpshooter. Carmona ended up with a bullet in
his leg.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews he granted from his hospital bed the next day,
Carmona corrected reporters who thought he had rushed in to give the
man medical help. "Everyone thinks I was there as a doctor, but
that's not the case," he told the Tucson Citizen.</TE>
<TE>   The bullet apparently came from the suspect's gun, after he was
dead and while Carmona and another deputy were disarming him. No
blame was ever assigned in the shooting, and the sheriff awarded
Carmona a citation--listed as a "Purple Heart" on his resume.</TE>
<TE>   His most dramatic and attention-getting moment came in a 1999
shootout at a busy intersection in which he killed an armed motorist.</TE>
<TE>   When Carmona was nominated for the surgeon general post,
newspapers from coast to coast, including The Times, repeated an
account of Carmona's actions at the scene originally published in the
Arizona Daily Star.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona, who was off duty, happened upon the scene of a minor car
accident that quickly got out of hand. While going to assist one of
the victims, the gathering crowd warned him that the man was armed.
After a brief standoff, he shot the man.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Daily Star, Carmona worked frantically--but
unsuccessfully--to save the man's life.</TE>
<TE>   The story seemed to distill Carmona's uncanny ability to serve the
disparate roles of doctor and cop. But it wasn't true.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona, in a transcript of his police interview at the scene,
said that, immediately after the man dropped, he went to his car to
reload his service revolver. He made it clear that he "never got
close" to the man and continued to train his weapon on him "even
though he wasn't moving."</TE>
<TE>   No one in Tucson has suggested that Carmona had anything to do
with the erroneous story. However, the published account assuaged
concern within the local medical community about a doctor taking a
life. And after his nomination was announced, the story also was used
as evidence of Carmona's fitness for the job by a number of
editorials in prominent newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting was found justified by law enforcement officials, who
discovered that the shooter, a mentally ill man, had stabbed his
father to death that day. Carmona hit the man with three of the seven
bullets he fired, two others lodged in the cars of passersby, one
striking inches from a driver. His actions "saved the lives of
innocent bystanders" according to the National Assn. of Police
Organizations which named him a "Top Cop" in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But for some doctors who say the Hippocratic Oath to "Do no harm"
prohibits a doctor from intentionally taking a life, Carmona's lack
of a medical role in these operations is troubling.</TE>
<TE>   "It is patently clear that Sheriff Carmona ... not Dr. Carmona,
was at center stage," Putnam said of the shootout in his letter to
Kennedy. "Could not a physician have recognized the behavior of a
mentally ill individual and responded in kind?" The shootout fueled
Carmona's reputation in Tucson as a charismatic cowboy. And despite
his controversial past, even some former adversaries here have said
they think the bully-pulpit nature of the surgeon general's job may
well suit him.</TE>
<TE>   Others say that if Carmona is confirmed, his tenure should prove
interesting.</TE>
<TE>   "He's sort of a Wild West type," said Meister, the former health
commissioner.Carmona, he said, truly believes he can accomplish
anything.</TE>
<TE>   "The downside of that is that none of us can do anything and
everything," Meister said. "And it's always hard to admit that you
can't, especially if you're a self-made man."</TE>

<HD>Texas Gov. Tours Flooded Areas</HD>
<DH>Weather: He says he will seek federal disaster relief for
17 counties. Death toll is at eight.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas</DL>
<LD>From the air Sunday, Gov. Rick Perry saw firsthand the devastation
that days of torrential rain have brought to Central and South Texas:
houses surrounded by a sea of roiling, muddy water, uprooted trees
and overturned vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   And the bad news just kept coming. Flood waters that devastated
the San Antonio area spilled into even more houses Sunday as they
flowed toward the Gulf of Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   "The devastation is extensive," the governor said after his
helicopter tour. "Obviously, when the water goes down, we're going to
see the impact on residential property is going to be substantial."</LD>
<TE>   About 160 miles to the northwest, residents of Brownwood
frantically piled sandbags around homes and businesses as water
rushed through downtown. Lake Brownwood was 7.65 feet above its
spillway Sunday and was expected to crest overnight a foot or more
higher.</TE>
<TE>   The flooding has been blamed for eight deaths and tens of millions
of dollars in property damage.</TE>
<TE>   In some places, the rivers have crested as high as 28 feet above
flood stage.</TE>
<TE>   Perry said he would seek federal aid for 17 counties. President
Bush already has declared 13 Texas counties federal disaster areas.</TE>
<TE>   Also Sunday, forecasters said the first tropical depression of the
season could be forming in the Gulf of Mexico with the potential for
additional rain in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Severe flooding hit the Abilene area after an unexpected storm
that dumped a foot of rain Saturday. Most evacuees began returning to
waterlogged homes Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, back in Brownwood, 75 miles southeast of Abilene, about
3 feet of water lapped up against dozens of motels, restaurants,
drugstores and shopping centers.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll hurt this area because it'll take several days for the
water to recede," City Manager Gary Butts said.</TE>
<TE>   In south-central Texas, where more than 30 inches of rain fell in
places last week, water levels were dropping in the Hill Country and
San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   In areas where evacuees were returning, the overflowing rivers
were still a threat, William Ayres, a spokesman for the Texas
Division of Emergency Management in Austin, said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The Guadalupe and other rivers originating in the Hill Country
were flooding cities and croplands across a low-lying coastal plain
leading to the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Large numbers of cattle were believed to be isolated or drowned
along the San Antonio River, which was expected to crest 30 feet
above flood stage by today at Goliad.</TE>
<TE>   About 24 houses were expected to be flooded in Goliad County, a
sheriff's spokeswoman said.</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM SANTA FE, N.M.</KH>
<HD>Water May Be a Wet Blanket to New Growth</HD>
<DH>Population: As supply dwindles, the City Council considers
a divisive proposal to ban all commercial and residential
construction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA FE, N.M.</DL>
<LD>The repercussions of a severe drought are being felt here in ways
beyond parched lawns turning brown and the installation of thousands
of low-flush toilets.</LD>
<LD>   At stake is the very growth of this singular capital city, known
for its historic plaza, chic art galleries and archetypal adobe
homes--and which is now starved for water.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, the City Council will debate a divisive proposal to
immediately ban all residential and commercial construction because
some residents are wary of sharing with newcomers what little water
they have.</LD>
<TE>   "We're fighting to keep our plaza, our football fields, our parks,
from dying," said Jerilou Hammett, who has lived here 25 years and
with her husband publishes a local design and architecture magazine.
"To allow more construction--and to use our last ounces of water for
someone else's new home by taking water from our existing
residents--simply doesn't make sense."</TE>
<TE>   Until now--because the town is only growing by about 2% a
year--there has been little debate about growth. But even that slow
building pace is threatening to eclipse the city's ability to provide
water for new hookups. Last year, the city issued 1,067 residential
building permits and 364 commercial permits.</TE>
<TE>   Before Santa Fe became one of the communities hardest hit by the
Southwest's lingering drought, the city consumed 16 million gallons a
day. About 40% of that water typically came from the city's
reservoir, which is expected to be drained within a month because of
the lack of snow melt and spring rains. The balance of Santa Fe's
water demand is barely met by the daily pumping capacity of the
city's two well fields.</TE>
<TE>   The building moratorium was proposed by City Councilor David Coss,
who since has found how divided the city is over the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of resentment in town because people can't water
their yards and are doing everything they can to save water, but
others have made their financial future in the home-building market,"
Coss said.</TE>
<TE>   "Contractors are telling me, 'This [moratorium] can't be. We'll
lose our jobs and our businesses.' And others in the community are
telling me, 'Stick to your guns.' "</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to hear both sides of the argument in a town antsy about
the drought, and where the usually plush plaza grass looks like
matted, celery-green felt.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lost my roses and petunias," said Gloria Gonzales, 58, a
local store clerk who has lived here all her life. "I turn off the
water as I brush my teeth. I'm drinking bottled water and dirty
dishes are piling up in the sink. We've got to stop the growth."</TE>
<TE>   But others, like home builder Jim Borrego, worry that halting
growth will punish Santa Fe residents employed in the construction
trades.</TE>
<TE>   "These people have had a very good income over the last 10 years
and a lot have bought new cars and homes. They've acquired debt," he
said. "They're really going to be hurt if construction dries up."</TE>
<TE>   Some residents are using the drought as ammunition to stop growth,
Coss said. And Kim Unger, president of the Santa Fe Homebuilders
Assn., agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "The drought is certainly giving slow-growthers a rallying cry,"
Unger said. "There's concern that [slow-growth City Council members]
will strike while the iron's hot."</TE>
<TE>   But the precarious water shortage--and the prospect that some taps
may actually run dry this month--has made philosophical arguments all
but moot, Coss said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents can only water their lawns and gardens once a week--and
the City Council is considering banning outdoor watering altogether.
Water cops prowl for people who wash their cars or top off their
swimming pools on the sly.</TE>
<TE>   The city has spent $1.3 million to provide thousands of
reduced-flow toilets and faucets. Officials have urged residents to
take a bucket into the shower with them to collect the runoff for
garden beds.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Fe is not alone in trying to cope with regional drought.
Stringent water conservation campaigns are underway from Atlanta to
Aurora, Colo., to Augusta, Maine.</TE>
<TE>   Some cities have taken stronger measures.</TE>
<TE>   In Lafayette, Colo., a city of 23,500 just outside Denver that
fills its taps from snow melt, the City Council in May ordered a
moratorium on water hookups for new homes because snow levels were
25% of normal.</TE>
<TE>   In northern New Mexico, two small towns--Espanola and Las
Vegas--have stopped issuing new construction permits for lack of
water, halting all residential and commercial development.</TE>
<TE>   Besides debating a building moratorium, Santa Fe also considered a
proposal tantamount to house-by-house water rationing.</TE>
<TE>   But that idea stalled last month, when sheepish finance officers
admitted that computer software problems made it impossible to
determine how much water is used by individual customers and that
water billing was based only on estimated usage.</TE>
<TE>   Another proposal calls for rationing building permits annually,
based on the projected availability of water and the development of
new water sources. Construction priority would be given to affordable
housing.</TE>
<TE>   City Council member Patti Bushee estimated that, under her
"community water budget"--to be discussed by the council this
month--growth would be reduced about 50%. In the 1990s, Santa Fe's
population grew to 62,203, from 55,589, according to census figures.</TE>
<TE>   "Our actual water supply would dictate how much we could build,"
she said. "We'd match, to the best of our ability, our growth rate to
the availability of our most limited resource: water."</TE>
<TE>   That strategy is supported by Neva Van Peski, a 13-year resident
and a retired economist for the Federal Reserve Board. "The question
is whether there will be any more water next year than there is this
year," she said. "If there isn't, and we allow growth to continue
without getting more water, people will be asked to pull in their
belts more and more every year."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Fe's problems aren't just drought-related. The town
purchased its water system in 1995 from a utility company and, to
save money, refrained from sinking more wells and acquiring more
water rights. The city now is trying to play catch-up, but relief is
months away.</TE>
<TE>   Residents have survived two less severe droughts--in 1996 and
2000--and rallied to conserve. "The water we saved went toward new
growth--new subdivisions and new hotels," said Judy Stevens, research
director for the Land Use Resource Center, a local, nonpartisan land
and water research organization.</TE>
<TE>   The city's challenge, she said, is in weighing future growth
against the limitations imposed by drought.</TE>
<TE>   "If water tells us we should be growing less, we need to do that
so we don't lose our trees, hurt businesses and make Santa Fe a less
desirable place to live or visit," she said. "And if there's more
water available, we don't want to be holding up people's ability to
provide housing, especially for their own kids."</TE>

<HD>Buried Gas Tanks Imperil Florida's Drinking Water</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Buried storage tanks are leaking gasoline into 25,000 sites around
the state, causing concern that drinking water may become
contaminated, state officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Florida's absorbent, sandy soil and residents' dependence on
ground water supplies contribute to the concerns, the Florida
Department of Environmental Protection said.</LD>
<LD>   Public wells used by 17 million people are within half a mile of
leaking tanks.</LD>
<TE>   "People don't realize when they are filling their cars with gas
that they are handling a hazardous substance--gasoline is explosive
and it can cause cancer," said Michael Ashey, chief of the Bureau of
Petroleum Storage Systems for the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection.</TE>
<TE>   Florida ranks third after California and Texas in gasoline use,
burning nearly 20 million gallons a day, according to the U.S.
Department of Energy.</TE>
<TE>   About 22,000 of the leak sites are near gas stations and similar
facilities, the department said.</TE>
<TE>   Florida has more leak sites than any other state except
California, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said.</TE>
<TE>   State officials are cleaning up more than 3,000 sites, and more
than 10,000 sites are awaiting cleanup.</TE>
<TE>   The state will require double-walled petroleum-storage tank
systems to replace the older tanks by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   The state spent $151 million last year to expedite the cleanups,
but officials say they need more money to reduce the backlog.</TE>

<HD>NAACP Says Bush Fails on Civil Rights</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>NAACP board Chairman Julian Bond criticized the Bush administration,
saying it had failed to enforce civil rights laws, and he denounced
the FBI's use of increased surveillance powers in fighting terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a president who owes his election more to a dynasty than
to democracy," Bond told about 3,000 people at the 93rd annual
convention of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored
People.</LD>
<LD>   Two years ago, President Bush "promised to enforce the civil
rights laws," Bond said. "We knew he was in the oil business--we just
didn't know it was snake oil."</LD>
<TE>   It was the second straight year Bond has assailed the Bush
administration's record.</TE>
<TE>   Bush addressed the convention as a presidential candidate in 2000,
but has declined a written invitation from NAACP President Kweisi
Mfume for the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   "The president is focused on bringing people together and uniting
the nation," said White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very proud of the administration's record of vigorous
enforcement of our civil rights laws."</TE>
<TE>   Bond particularly attacked Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, whom he
called "a cross between" former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and the
Rev. Jerry Falwell.</TE>
<TE>   He also denounced post-Sept. 11 backlash attacks on people who
look Arab or Muslim. "The CIA and FBI kept files on me in the 1960s;
they may be keeping files on me today," Bond said. "Now, under the
guise of fighting terrorism, the FBI is going back to spying on
law-abiding citizens."</TE>
<TE>   As he did last year, Bond referred to the disenfranchisement of
black voters in Florida during the 2000 presidential election.</TE>

<HD>Bush Creates a Harder Challenge on Ethics After Easing
Corporate Rules</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's easy to imagine the frenzy that would be engulfing Washington if
it were President Clinton now revising his explanation of a
controversial 12-year-old stock deal.</LD>
<LD>   Rush Limbaugh would be roaring in outrage. Robert H. Bork would be
decrying the loss of moral authority in the Oval Office. Sen. Arlen
Specter (R-Pa.) would be demanding a special prosecutor.
Congressional committees would be subpoenaing the president's old
business partners.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush probably will be spared all that, even after
suddenly altering his explanation for why he was eight months late in
reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission his 1990 sale of
stock in Harken Energy Corp.--a company on whose board he
sat--shortly before it announced large losses. (For years he blamed
it on the SEC; now he's fingering Harken's lawyers.)</LD>
<TE>   After the fanatical ethics wars of the Clinton years, few in
Washington have much stomach for a full-scale confrontation--though
the Washington Post raised eyebrows by revealing Bush's former
personal attorney was the SEC general counsel at the time the
commission cleared him of wrongdoing in the stock sale. (The
attorney, James Doty, says he recused himself.) The demands of the
real war underway against terrorism also will discourage a political
firefight over the sale. But even so, the disclosures are still
creating awkward moments for Bush as he prepares to call for greater
corporate responsibility in a speech Tuesday in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the focus on Bush's behavior 12 years ago may frame the
wrong debate. It's likely that the dominant argument in Washington
will be over whether it's credible for Bush to demand better
corporate behavior while facing these personal questions. The more
relevant issue is whether it's credible for Bush to threaten a
crackdown now after his administration spent its first 18 months
promising business kinder and gentler enforcement of the range of
federal laws against corporate misconduct--from the environment to
the stock markets to the workplace. In other words, can Bush
plausibly shake the iron fist after stroking the Fortune 500 for so
long with a velvet glove?</TE>
<TE>   For all the nouvelle elements of Bush's thinking on social issues
such as education or homeownership, he's always been a conventional
conservative on government oversight of business. As governor of
Texas, presidential candidate and president, Bush has focused more on
intrusive government than irresponsible corporations. His consistent
message has been that, in pursuing its goals and enforcing its laws,
government should be more cooperative and less coercive. During the
2000 campaign, he crystallized his view on government's relationship
with business when he said: "I do not believe you can sue your way or
regulate your way to clean air and clean water."</TE>
<TE>   Bush has put flesh on that philosophy by staffing many federal
agencies with alumni of the industries they now regulate. The
Interior Department is crowded with former lobbyists for the coal and
oil industries. A former timber lobbyist is watching the national
forests. Harvey L. Pitt, the SEC chairman, came from the accounting
industry; Bush already has appointed another accounting industry alum
to the five-member commission and nominated yet a third. (That means
Bush is seeking to construct an SEC, for the first time, with a
majority of commissioners tied to the accounting industry.)</TE>
<TE>   To monitor safety in the workplace, Bush found an executive from
the chemical industry; to monitor safety in the mines, he appointed
an executive from the mining industry. The list goes on.</TE>
<TE>   In chorus, Bush's appointees have sung the same tune. At her
confirmation hearing last year, Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Christie Whitman promised more negotiation and less
litigation against recalcitrant companies. "Instilling fear does not
solve problems," she insisted. Over at the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, director John Henshaw as late as last month
told a business audience: "Hopefully, we can put the days of OSHA as
an adversary behind us."</TE>
<TE>   And before Enron and WorldCom and Martha Stewart forced the SEC
chair to try to morph into Harvey Pitt-bull, he was sending the same
message, telling the accounting industry last fall that he viewed
them as the agency's "partner" and pledging "a new era of respect and
cooperation" after the confrontations of the Clinton years.</TE>
<TE>   Partnership with industry has its place. But enforcing federal law
to police the marketplace isn't it. No cop anywhere would agree with
Whitman; they instead would argue that the best way to discourage
drug dealing or street crime is to instill fear--of relentless
enforcement. The same is true in the boardroom. Polluters or stock
swindlers are more likely to stop because they fear being caught than
because Washington asks them nicely.</TE>
<TE>   The tsunami of corporate scandals has made the
chocolates-on-the-pillow approach to enforcement untenable at the
SEC. But the velvet glove still dominates in other arenas that
haven't attracted as bright a spotlight. OSHA has asked employers
only for voluntary steps to reduce repetitive stress injuries.
Several top EPA lawyers have quit since Bush took office, bristling
at budget cuts for enforcement and accusing the administration of
undermining their pursuit of tough settlements against companies
violating clean air and clean water laws.</TE>
<TE>   And even in the securities field--while promising vigorous pursuit
of individual wrongdoers--the White House still hasn't endorsed the
systematic changes in accounting oversight included in the reform
bill Senate Democrats will bring to the floor this week.</TE>
<TE>   It's good for Bush to add his voice to the demand for more ethical
corporate behavior. But his words would carry more weight if matched
with action. If Bush is sincere about confronting corporate
misbehavior, he'd be changing direction not only at the SEC but at
the agencies protecting the environment, the workplace and public
lands too. Eric Schaeffer, who resigned in protest as head of civil
enforcement at the EPA earlier this year, asks the right question:
Does it make sense to rely "on corporate self-policing" to safeguard
the public "after what we've learned about corporate responsibility
from Enron and others."</TE>
<TE>   Until Bush has an answer, his call for a corporate cleanup will
remain muffled--as if he were speaking into a velvet glove.</TE>

<HD>Business Scandals Force GOP to Consider Broader Reforms</HD>
<DH>Policy: Bush's speech on Wall Street may mark a change from
his party's anti-regulatory stance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Mounting public concern about the new wave of business scandals is
forcing President Bush and congressional Republicans to consider a
more intrusive government role in monitoring the private sector than
they have been willing to accept.</LD>
<LD>   For months, Bush and fellow Republicans have held the line at
relatively limited federal action in response to accounting abuses
and controversial financial practices, blaming problems on a few
corporate bad apples and contending the business world was already
stepping forward to clean up the mess.</LD>
<LD>   Now, their restrained approach has begun to give way as the
scandals have spread to some of the nation's largest corporations,
including telecom giant WorldCom, and as Democrats have mobilized
behind tougher government action.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Bush will move to seize a prominent place in the
reform campaign by going to Wall Street to deliver a stern lecture on
ethics to business leaders. He is widely expected to propose new or
tougher criminal penalties, such as mandatory jail time, for
executives guilty of misleading or defrauding stockholders.</TE>
<TE>   The address should represent a notable turn for an
oilman-turned-politician who boasted of being shaped by the culture
of business rather than government and who has often inveighed
against government meddling.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Bush
"will focus on strict enforcement and tough punishment," pressing for
adherence to existing laws and punishing corporate wrongdoers.
Fleischer spoke in Kennebunkport, Maine, where Bush was spending the
holiday weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Also this week, the Democratic-controlled Senate will debate a
tough corporate reform measure that has been strengthened by the
recent revelations of an almost $4-billion accounting fraud by
WorldCom. It is expected to pass, with a significant number of
Republicans supporting it.</TE>
<TE>   In the House, Republicans are planning to take the lead in
grilling current and former WorldCom officials at a hearing today on
the company's accounting misstatement.</TE>
<TE>   Unclear is exactly how far beyond tough words Bush and GOP
lawmakers are willing to go in supporting increased federal oversight
of business.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials vow that the administration will follow
through with an aggressive stance toward corporate wrongdoing. "We
think this administration will show through action, not rhetoric,
that it means business," White House communication director Dan
Bartlett said.</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, the recent corporate miscues have put the
president and other regulatory-wary Republicans in the center of
debate on a subject they would have preferred to avoid.</TE>
<TE>   Some political analysts expect Bush in his Tuesday speech to sound
like a modern-day Theodore Roosevelt, the most notable GOP president
to go toe to toe with big business.</TE>
<TE>   "President Bush's challenge is to get in touch with his inner
Teddy Roosevelt and demonstrate that he can be a regulator with
results," said Marshall Wittmann, a political scholar with the
conservative Hudson Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Some also see Bush inching closer to accepting much of the reform
bill drafted by Senate Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a perception that the GOP are in bed with industries that
need tougher regulation," said Greg Valliere, chief strategist for
Schwab Washington Research Group, which provides investment-oriented
political analysis. "The Republicans need some political cover."</TE>
<TE>   The bill, written by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Paul S.
Sarbanes (D-Md.), is stricter than an industry-backed measure passed
by the GOP-controlled House this year. It would establish a new board
to oversee and discipline accountants. The House bill also would
create such a panel but is less specific about its powers.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill also would go further in limiting the amount of
consulting that accounting firms could provide to companies they
audit, a response to suggestions that Arthur Andersen's consulting
and auditing work for Enron Corp. led to a conflict of interest that
may have delayed the disclosure of the energy giant's financial
weaknesses late last year.</TE>
<TE>   The House and Senate bills include a number of common features,
improving prospects that the chambers can reconcile their differences
and send Bush a bill he can sign.</TE>
<TE>   Both bills would impose new financial disclosure requirements on
public companies and prohibit senior executives from selling company
stock during periods when lower-ranking employees cannot.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats plan to try to make the Senate measure even more
stringent, adding new criminal penalties for securities fraud and
document shredding, new protections for corporate whistle-blowers and
extending to five years from three years the time frame for investors
to file securities fraud lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats also are expected to make a new push to pass pension
reform legislation that was proposed at the height of the focus on
Enron's financial collapse. That measure, which has been stalled in
Congress for months, would give employees new rights to sell company
stock and diversify investments in their 401(k) retirement accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Sarbanes said he has seen a change in attitude by members of both
parties in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   "You've had these egregious practices," he said. "You've had
enough of them that people are reaching the conclusion that it's not
just bad apples who need to be punished, that you also need to make
changes in the system."</TE>
<TE>   Sarbanes said big losses for investors, declining confidence in
financial markets and worries about the effect of the scandals on the
economy have helped generate bipartisan support for his legislation.
"I think there is a growing appreciation that this is a serious
situation, and we really need to come to grips with it."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, a key Republican on
financial issues, said he now favors creation of a board to oversee
accountants. "I didn't always feel that way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Santorum said he thinks Sarbanes' bill would go too far,
contending that it amounts to Congress legislating accounting
standards. "What we're doing here is new. We have to be very careful
that we don't overdose on the medicine."</TE>
<TE>   There remains a wide gulf between House Republican and Senate
Democratic lawmakers over how far Congress should go in responding to
the wave of scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) on Sunday assailed
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt as a "huge
disappointment" and blasted the administration for its "permissive"
attitude toward business. "That's the kind of thing that got us into
the trouble in the first place--winking at regulation," Daschle told
CBS' "Face the Nation."</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to have tougher enforcement of the regulations that
exist," Daschle added, "but we need a new framework, a better system
of regulation than we have today."</TE>
<TE>   But Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio), chairman of the House
Financial Services Committee, said on "Fox News Sunday" that the
reform bill he wrote "gives the SEC added authority to do what they
do best and regulate that area. But I don't think that we want to
interfere with the capital markets, and I fear there may be some
overreaction."</TE>
<TE>   Defending Pitt, Fleischer on Sunday said that "the SEC has taken
more enforcement action against major" corporate wrongdoing "this
year than in the previous eight years, and the year isn't over yet."</TE>
<TE>   Those who have followed the business reform legislation say they
think House Republicans will gravitate toward the Senate bill.</TE>
<TE>   "Since [President] Reagan, anti-regulation has been Republican
dogma," said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia
Center for Politics.</TE>
<TE>   "But electoral necessity is the mother of political
flip-flopping."</TE>
<TE>   But Valliere contended that more is at work in the evolving GOP
attitudes than political considerations. Most Republicans, especially
Bush, are really steamed at business, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They feel betrayed by people they thought they could trust. This
anger seems to be genuine, and I think Bush will sound pretty tough"
in his speech, Valliere said.</TE>
<TE>   When Bush travels to Wall Street, he will be walking a political
tightrope, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   In order to "satisfy swing and independent voters, he has to sound
suitably horrified about what has been going on in parts of corporate
America," said Patrick Basham, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato
Institute. "But, at the same time, he can't recommend too draconian a
solution for risk of offending his conservative political and
fund-raising base or making it unnecessarily costly for businesses to
keep their accounts straight."</TE>
<TE>   Fred Smith, president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a
pro-market Washington policy group, said he hopes Bush will use his
bully pulpit to "calm the populist anti-business rhetoric now
sweeping the country."</TE>
<TE>   "Bush should note that he will pursue fraud aggressively.... No
one is entitled to lie to their investors," he said. But, Smith
added, Bush also should discuss "the creative chaos of the economic
frontier, the fact that entrepreneurs are basically making it up as
they go along. That this trial-and-error process is the only way to
invent the future, and to realize the wealth that America must have
to enjoy that future."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts expect Bush's speech to mark a significant departure
for him and his party.</TE>
<TE>   "The president's speech will likely signal the end of the past 20
years of Republican deregulatory zealotry," Wittmann said.</TE>
<TE>   Others are more cautious in assessing its long-term effect.</TE>
<TE>   "What the Republicans really have to hope for is that this spate
of corporate scandals runs its course by summer's end, with the stock
market picking up and the press' attention turning elsewhere," Sabato
said.</TE>

<HD>2 Large Fires Burn in Utah as Arizona Blaze Fades</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Firefighters in bone-dry Utah battled two large blazes on the state's
eastern edge that threatened homes and natural gas wells, while
Arizona fire crews nearly contained the state's worst wildfire, fire
officials said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The large fires and four smaller blazes have charred more than
116,000 acres across Utah since late last month, fire officials said.</LD>
<LD>   A 13,500-acre, wind-driven fire burning eight miles south of the
Utah-Wyoming line in Wasatch-Cache National Forest was 45% contained
Sunday afternoon, said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Kathy Hardy.</LD>
<TE>   High humidity and light rains slowed the blaze's spread over the
holiday weekend, but wind and high temperatures forecast for today
brought worries that the fire would jump hard-won fire lines on the
high-elevation slopes, Hardy said.</TE>
<TE>   The fire erupted June 28 beside the east fork of the Bear River
and quickly spread through the tinder-dry slopes of lodgepole pines,
sub-alpine fir and ash trees, Hardy said.</TE>
<TE>   Walls of flames quickly reached 150 feet high, forcing the
evacuation of a nearby Boy Scout camp and 500 vacation homes, Hardy
said.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the fire is under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   About 200 miles to the south, extremely rugged terrain and
record-high temperatures hampered firefighters' efforts to control a
74,500-acre blaze near the Four Corner resort of Moab.</TE>
<TE>   The lightning-spawned fire was 22% contained Sunday afternoon, but
fire officials did not say when they thought it would be fully
contained. The blaze destroyed an outbuilding and threatened five
ranches Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters shut off 20 to 30 natural gas wells in the fire's
path Saturday, but the area remained closed to the public, according
to fire officials.</TE>
<TE>   In Arizona, firefighters expected to contain the largest wildfire
in state history by Sunday evening, said fire information spokeswoman
Tammi Woodrum.</TE>
<TE>   The combined Rodeo-Chediski fire consumed more than 468,000 acres
and destroyed 426 homes and other structures, Woodrum said.</TE>

<HD>Yellowstone a Study in Vital Role of Wildfires</HD>
<DH>Ecology: Scientists say concern over short-term damage
ignores rebirth that occurs in forests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo.</DL>
<LD>For more than 250 years, the three-toed woodpecker barely eked out an
existence in the high forests here in the Rockies. The 8-inch insect
eater never had much more than a tenuous foothold and by the 1980s
was on the verge of losing even that, pushed out by hardier birds.</LD>
<LD>   Then something auspicious happened, giving the little woodpecker a
break. In 1988, wildfires roared through 750,000 acres of
Yellowstone, charring acre after acre of the old forest, destroying
habitat for the bird's competitors. What looked like a disaster for
the park's wildlife turned out to be a boon for the woodpecker.</LD>
<LD>   "All those dead trees are bug factories, wonderful for him," said
John Varley, pointing to a steep ridge once covered by old-growth
lodgepole pines and conifers. Today, the mountainside is prickly with
what look like towering black chopsticks. It's the woodpeckers' happy
new home.</LD>
<TE>   "In a fire, even a big one, for every loser, there is a winner,"
said Varley, director of the Yellowstone Center for Resources.</TE>
<TE>   In this summer of massive wildfires throughout the West,
Yellowstone offers a compelling lesson in fire's quid pro quo. A
forest destroyed is also a forest made over: It becomes more
efficient, safer and often more diverse.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than land lying fallow after a fire, other plants rush in
to fill the vacuum. After a huge burn, forests are all but fireproof,
and the absence of long-established trees opens the forest to new
species of plants and healthier versions of their own kind. Animals
adapt in similar ways. Like the plants that have always existed in
small numbers in the Yellowstone ecosystem, some animals bide their
time until conditions are right, then rapidly increase after a big
fire.</TE>
<TE>   Since the fires, Yellowstone has become a living laboratory for
fire ecologists, who in more than 400 research projects have charted,
measured and mapped the massive burn area to calculate the fires'
handiwork.</TE>
<TE>   Varley argues that the fires did a fine job of restoring balance
to the park. Despite the national hysteria following the park's "let
it burn" policy, Yellowstone today shows no signs of devastation. For
that, Varley compliments nature and its hardheaded resolve to impose
balance on its ecosystems.</TE>
<TE>   Varley walked the park's backcountry to illustrate that point. He
paused in a broad green swale, tucked partway up a ridge. His black
boots stood ankle deep in a thick carpet of healthy plants and a
young 11-foot Douglas fir dwarfed his 6-foot frame.</TE>
<TE>   "Golly, it doesn't look devastated," the scientist wisecracked,
gesturing to the vast tract of national parkland before him that
exploded in fire on the night of Sept. 10, 1988. That blaze was the
last of several major wildfires that rendered the nation's oldest
national park an "ecological disaster," as media reports called it at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   But destruction, in Varley's experience, is in the eye of the
beholder. Where many see this summer's huge wildfires in Colorado and
Arizona as, invariably, "devastating," Varley and other scientists
know fire for what it is, an integral actor in nature's grand design
for survival.</TE>
<TE>   Most plants and animals here have evolved to survive fire. Some
even fare better after a fire. The dominant tree in Yellowstone, the
lodgepole pine, stores its seeds in a resin-encased cone. Intense
fires cause the resin to melt, releasing decades worth of seeds to
the forest floor. Because the soil is rich with nutrients deposited
by the fire, pine saplings flourish as they would not have before the
fire.</TE>
<TE>   Even the lodgepole's seeds are fire-smart: The black seeds spill
onto the charcoal and ash and are camouflaged from hungry birds.</TE>
<TE>   Quaking aspen, rarely seen in the park and unable to compete for
space with the conifers, are now thriving in leafy green swaths. The
aspens' vast root systems are deep and protected from a fire's heat,
allowing them to capitalize on the open space provided by the burn.</TE>
<TE>   When a fire takes down tree crowns, it creates more sunlight on
the forest floor. Plants that had lain quietly in seed beds beneath
the soil opportunistically spring up after burns, responding to
newfound light or sensing a change in environment. Everywhere after
Western fires, brilliant red fireweed plants abound.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked at Yellowstone for 14 years before the '88 fires and I'd
never seen a Bicknell's geranium, but they flourished after the
fires," said Don Despain, a former research biologist at Yellowstone.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot more to forests than trees. They may be gone, but
everything else sprouts like mad," said Despain, now with the U.S.
Geological Survey in Bozeman, Mont. "We suspect there is a chemical
released after fire that causes flowering plants to take off. There
is a nitrogen compound in smoke that stimulates other species to
germinate."</TE>
<TE>   Even among animals, habitat loss for some means new homes for
others. Moose, elk and pine martens, which thrived in old-growth
forests, did not do well in years immediately after the fire. Nor did
most nesting birds. But some birds, such as three-toed woodpeckers,
tree swallows and mountain bluebirds, prospered. Ground squirrels are
back, happy in younger sagebrush that allows the small creatures to
hide in and peer over.</TE>
<TE>   Little of the fire's "good news" is understood by the public
because media reporting on wildfires is simplistic and
sensationalized, said Peter Morrison, executive director of the
Pacific Biodiversity Institute in Winthrop, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   "They say, '10,000 acres destroyed by fire,' " he said. "Rarely do
I see as much attention to the landscape after the fire. The
reporting would be much more accurate if it said, '10,000 acres
restored by fire.' "</TE>
<TE>   Fire as savior is a concept that's counterintuitive for most
Americans. Fire has a few public relations problems. For generations
raised on Smokey Bear's admonitions against forest fires, the sight
of trees burning seems wrong. Aesthetically, a treed landscape is
more pleasing than the fire-gutted alternative. Also, fire can kill.</TE>
<TE>   "When we say that fire is good for an ecosystem, the mental image
the public has is a vast area of standing black trees that's just
denuded. It just goes against core values for some people," said Paul
Langowski, a fire ecologist for the U.S. Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   When Yellowstone began to burn after lightning ignited fires in
June 1988, park managers followed a policy that allowed natural fires
to burn themselves out, as long as life or property was not
threatened. By the next month, the complex of eight fires was so out
of control that the controversial "let it burn" policy was reversed.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the Yellowstone fires would require 25,000 personnel
to fight, including two battalions of Marines, and more than 10
million gallons of water. The last blaze was extinguished in
mid-November--put out by rain and snow--and the bill for the
firefighting effort came to $120 million.</TE>
<TE>   Fire management policy in the park still allows natural fires to
burn. Generally, a similar policy applies to all public lands,
although with the severe drought in the West, land managers are quick
to fight even small fires.</TE>
<TE>   The Yellowstone blazes share similarities with wildfires from this
year's dangerous fire season. Images of the massive fires were in the
news for weeks. Americans were aghast as animals fled from burning
forests and 250-year-old trees immolated in 15 seconds. The fires
were so intense that 150,000 acres of parkland burned in one day.</TE>
<TE>   For Varley and other Yellowstone scientists, the criticism
surrounding the fires lasted longer than the damage to the park.
Congressional hearings were called, the federal approach to fires was
revamped and experts claimed Yellowstone would never be the same.</TE>
<TE>   "A few months after the fire, I was right here, walking through 10
inches of ash," Varley said, pointing down to a meadow bursting with
plants. "Another way to look at ash is as decomposed nutrients, the
building blocks of life."</TE>
<TE>   Several months later, plants covered 80% of the same site, Varley
said. The following year the meadow was completely covered with
vegetation.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the way things have shifted here," Varley said. "People
want things to stay the same, but that's never possible in nature.
One species is on top for a long time, then the fires change that.
The deer mouse used to be the dominant animal in these forests. Now
it's the red-backed vole's turn. Nature is always seeking balance.
Fires make it happen."</TE>

<LD>I DIDN'T KNOW THAT</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Question: Why do I lose 2 or 3 pounds overnight?</LD>
<TE>   Answer: The weight loss occurs because you lose water overnight,
primarily through respiration, and don't replace it before you weigh
yourself. A gallon of water weighs 8 pounds, 16 fluid ounces weighs
about 1 pound, and 1 liter weighs 1 kilogram, or 2.2 pounds. So when
you drink a 16-ounce soda, you gain 1 pound. NASA studies have shown
that the average person eliminates about 1.2 liters of urine every
day and loses 1.5 liters through perspiration and respiration. That's
a total of about 6 pounds that must be replaced by drinking fluids.</TE>

<LD>African strains of the AIDS virus may have mutations that help them
develop resistance to drugs more quickly, according to a report in
the journal Biochemistry.</LD>
<LD>   The report may help explain why drugs stop working effectively in
African HIV patients, the researchers said.</LD>
<LD>   If so, new drugs must be developed urgently, said Ernesto Freire,
the biology professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore who
led the study.</LD>
<TE>   Of the 40-million-plus people infected with HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS, 70% live in Africa.</TE>
<TE>   The human immunodeficiency virus has evolved into several
variants, called HIV-A through HIV-H, with HIV-A and HIV-C the most
common in Africa.</TE>

<LD>A fossil found in 1971 has been re-identified as the earliest known
animal built to walk on land, a salamander-like creature that marked
a previously unknown stage in the evolution of fish into the ancestor
of all vertebrates today.</LD>
<LD>   The toothy animal, Pederpes finneyae, lived from 348 million to
344 million years ago in what is now Dumbarton, Scotland. It was
about a yard long and probably split its time between the water and
land, where it walked on four feet, said a Cambridge University
Museum of Zoology official.</LD>
<LD>   Pederpes is formally described in Thursday's issue of Nature. The
creature's nearly complete fossil skeleton had lain, mislabeled as a
fish, in a Scottish museum since its discovery 31 years ago.</LD>

<LD>My new computer was driving me nuts. Every time I tried to save a
document, it would instead demand that I ask for "help" and refuse to
budge until I went through the motions of posing some kind of
question. As it turned out, the problem was easily fixed by altering
the program's default settings.</LD>
<LD>   Computer programs have minds of their own. That's why they're so
useful. It becomes a problem only when you and the computer aren't of
like minds and you don't realize you can fix the problem by changing
the program's defaults.</LD>
<LD>   Would that it were so easy to fix the defaults programmed into
human thinking.</LD>
<TE>   A familiar riddle illustrates the problem: A man and his son are
driving home from a baseball game when their car stalls on the
railroad tracks. As a train rushes toward them, the father struggles
desperately to start the car, but to no avail. The father is killed.
The boy is critically injured. The ambulance arrives, and the boy is
rushed to the hospital. In the operating room, the surgeon looks at
the boy and gasps: "I can't operate on this boy. He's my son."</TE>
<TE>   If you haven't heard this before, you'll have some trouble
figuring out what's going on here. But the solution is simple. The
surgeon is the boy's mother. Alas, since our "default setting" for
"surgeon" is male, almost everyone has a hard time coming up with the
obvious solution.</TE>
<TE>   "A default assumption is what holds true in what you might say is
the 'simplest' or 'most natural' or 'most likely' possible model of
whatever situation is under discussion," wrote Douglas Hofstadter
some years ago in his Scientific American column, Metamagical Themas.
"But the critical thing about default assumptions is that they are
made automatically, not as a result of consideration and
elimination."</TE>
<TE>   We slip into default thinking completely unaware of what we're
doing. We assume that the ground will be solid when we step on it
(even though it sometimes isn't); we assume that the brakes will work
on the car. Too many people also learn to assume that blonds are
dumb, Arabs are terrorists, that a group of black teenagers coming
down the street means trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Default settings are shortcuts that allow us to go through life
without a thought as to what we are thinking. They are insidious
because the default--in our minds--becomes the only possible
scenario.</TE>
<TE>   One species that put this to use is the cowbird, which lays her
eggs in the nests of other species. The bird that actually built the
nest assumes that whatever hatches must be hers, feeding and raising
the intruder as her own, even when the hatchling looks very different
from the rest of her brood.</TE>
<TE>   This is a fine strategy for cowbirds but a very bad thing for the
true fledglings that can get thrown out of the nest or starve as a
result.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists too mistake defaults for the only possible truth. They
took it for granted that we couldn't know what stars were made of,
couldn't fly to the moon (indeed, fly at all); they assumed that
mountains are immovable and atoms indestructible. They took it for
granted that space and time were dependable and solid. Now we know
they can slip, slide, stretch, warp, foam at the mouth.</TE>
<TE>   Some argue that the default state of the human species is war.
When we don't know what else to do, we fight. However, a recent study
by UCLA psychologists throws this into doubt.</TE>
<TE>   True, men under stress do tend to fall back on "fight or flight"
as the first line of defense. Their default state is: hide, or hit
someone. Women, however, cope with stress quite differently. They
seek social contact or turn to nurturing--pick up the phone or tend
the children. In fact, what principal investigator Shelley Taylor
called this "tend and befriend" strategy for coping with stress seems
characteristic of females of many species.</TE>
<TE>   No one had seen this pattern before, Taylor said, because, until
recently, most studies focused on males--the universal default mode.</TE>
<TE>   Given that the world is run mostly by men, however, it's going to
take no small amount of imagination to think outside this
particularly lethal box. Certainly, it's happened before. Against all
odds, there is quasi-democracy in Russia, quasi-peace in Northern
Ireland; Nelson Mandela prevailed in South Africa and even Richard
Nixon went to China.</TE>
<TE>   Default is not the only option. In fact, Taylor and colleagues
conclude that the "tend and befriend" strategy might well be
responsible for the fact that women live on average 7 1/2 years
longer than men.</TE>
<TE>   An intriguing idea to consider for those of us who live so close
to default lines.</TE>

<DH>Research: Scans can more quickly tell what treatment will
best aid depression. Patients now often go through weeks of trial,
error.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Finding the proper treatment for depression has often been a
hit-or-miss process in which patients must try an array of drugs to
see which one will work--a clinical obstacle course that can take
weeks or even months.</LD>
<LD>   Everyone has different brain chemistry, so their responses to the
same antidepressant can vary widely. Psychiatrists have no good way
to determine how a person will react to a drug; the patient must try
it and see.</LD>
<LD>   "We do the best matching we can, based on what a person has
responded to in the past or what has worked for a family member,"
said Dr. Ian Cook, assistant professor of psychiatry at the UCLA
Neuropsychiatric Institute.</LD>
<TE>   New research by Cook and his colleagues at UCLA may make this
tortuous waiting period obsolete. Using a brain scan called
quantitative electroencephalogram, they have developed a technique
that can predict whether a patient will respond to a particular drug
therapy within a few days.</TE>
<TE>   "The right drug for a person's brain is like the key that turns
the molecular lock," said Cook, whose findings were published this
month in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology.</TE>
<TE>   The technique focuses on activity in the prefrontal cortex,
the most forward part of the brain, which is central to many higher
mental functions, such as judgment, planning and executing plans.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Eric Nofzinger, associate professor of psychiatry at the
University of Pittsburgh, said the UCLA research is a significant
step in the right direction given the lack of reliable biological
measures to predict antidepressant responses.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the results are still preliminary and it will take
further work on a larger population sample before the technique can
become widely applicable.</TE>
<TE>   Clinical depression is one of the most common mental illnesses,
afflicting almost 20 million Americans a year. The World Health
Organization estimates that in less than 20 years only heart disease
will be a greater burden on health-care systems than depression.</TE>
<TE>   Depression is also among the most treatable of mental disorders;
the vast majority of people who seek help for depression improve
through therapy or medication.</TE>
<TE>   Antidepressants are one of the most commonly prescribed treatments
today. They work by adjusting the balance of chemicals in the brain.</TE>
<TE>   Prozac is the best known of these drugs, modulating one of the
brain's most important signaling chemicals: serotonin. Other
pharmaceuticals in this class of drugs, known as serotonin reuptake
inhibitors, are Paxil and Zoloft.</TE>
<TE>   A new class of antidepressants, including Effexor and Serzone,
acts on another important signaling molecule, norepinephrine, as well
as serotonin.</TE>
<TE>   There are a variety of factors that can contribute to
abnormalities in the brain's chemical signaling systems: Stress,
genetics, gender and other mental illness can all play a role.
Because of this complexity, scientists still don't fully understand
how antidepressants can treat depression so effectively.</TE>
<TE>   Add this intricate interplay to the individuality of the human
brain and it becomes very difficult to find a suitable antidepressant
therapy. In fact, only 60% to 70% of patients respond to the first
drug they try. The rest must try another drug, and half of those must
try a third.</TE>
<TE>   The trial-and-error process can take months, time in which the
patient is suffering and not able to work. "This can have a
tremendous human toll," Cook said.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Steckla was diagnosed with depression almost two years ago,
encouraged to seek treatment by friends who noticed some of the
typical symptoms of depression. "I was tired and unmotivated. I felt
like I couldn't get out of bed," Steckla said. "Getting up and going
to work was like putting on a show."</TE>
<TE>   Steckla started counseling and was prescribed Zoloft, going
through the typical six- to eight-week waiting period it would take
to feel better. Unfortunately, the side effects of the drug were
intolerable. "I felt like a zombie," Steckla said.</TE>
<TE>   He then started another drug, Wellbutrin, which had no effect,
then a third. His doctors finally found a combination of the previous
drugs that seemed to work.</TE>
<TE>   Cook, who treats patients at UCLA's Mood Disorders Clinic,
believed a better way to find the right drug was to go to the source,
to "listen to what the brain is doing" by looking at changes in the
electrical activity on the surface of the brain.</TE>
<TE>   During the EEG procedure, which takes about an hour, a bathing cap
with wires running through it is placed on a person's head.</TE>
<TE>   Cook measured the brain activity of people who had just started
taking two types of commonly prescribed antidepressants, Prozac and
Effexor. They then looked at these brain wave changes to see whether
they matched how a person felt several weeks later when the clinical
effects of the antidepressant started to kick in.</TE>
<TE>   People who would respond to antidepressants showed a decrease in
activity in the prefrontal cortex. Those who showed the greatest
decrease in brain activity were the most helped by the
antidepressant.</TE>
<TE>   "EEG is unique in that it has a predictive ability," Cook said.</TE>
<TE>   The technique does seem to have good clinical potential. EEG
machines are relatively inexpensive, compared to other MRI and CAT
scanning devices. The machines are small enough to be easily placed
in clinics and hospitals, and are relatively easy to operate, Cook
said.</TE>
<TE>   He plans to further simplify his method so that other depression
researchers can test the technique. He expects it can be used
clinically within a couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   Depression patients such as Steckla see the benefits of speedier
treatment. "I would have had months of my life back," he said.</TE>

<HD>Hackers Target Energy Industry</HD>
<DH>Computers: Attacks at power companies are up substantially.
Some experts blame industrial spying and mischief, others fear
terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Power and energy companies are fast becoming a primary target of
computer hackers who have managed to penetrate energy control
networks as well as administrative systems, according to government
cyber-terrorism officials and private security experts.</LD>
<LD>   Experts cite a number of potential sources for the post-Sept. 11
increase in hacker attacks, including industrial espionage and
malicious mischief, but Ronald Dick, director of the FBI's cybercrime
division, said he is concerned that the nation's power grid now may
be moving into the cross-hairs of cyber-terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   "The event that I fear most is a physical attack in conjunction
with the success of a cyber attack on an infrastructure such as
electric power or 911," the emergency telephone system, Dick said.</LD>
<TE>   The raft of recent attacks has been confirmed by private computer
security companies.</TE>
<TE>   Riptech Inc., an Alexandria, Va., security firm, said that since
January, 14 of its 20 energy-industry clients have suffered severe
cyber attacks that would have disrupted company networks if they had
not been detected immediately. The number of attacks is up 77% since
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Power and energy companies experienced an average of 1,280
significant attacks each in the last six months--far more than
companies in any other industry sector--according to Riptech's
semiannual client analysis.</TE>
<TE>   "Unequivocally, these nets are vulnerable to cyber attack, and,
unequivocally, one outcome could be disruption of power supplies,"
said Tim Belcher, Riptech's chief technology officer.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's power crisis in California, the Enron Corp. scandal
and the declaration of bankruptcy by Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. have
revealed an industry that is fragile, high- profile and wracked with
confusion and administrative chaos. Experts suspect that the glare of
adverse publicity has drawn the attention of not just joyriding
hackers, but also corporate saboteurs and terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   More than 70% of the attacks came from North America and Europe,
suggesting that traditional hackers are now turning to a fresh and
vulnerable victim. The second-most popular hacking target among
Riptech clients was financial service companies, a longtime hacker
favorite. Riptech, which serves Fortune 500 corporations, smaller
companies and government agencies, was founded by former top Defense
Department officials to provide computer security.</TE>
<TE>   A geographical analysis of Riptech data also shows that a small
number of attacks--1,260 out of a total of more than
180,000--originated in countries where terrorists groups are known to
be concentrated. Hackers in those countries targeted power and energy
companies more consistently and aggressively than any other industry.
The most active attacks originated from Kuwait, Egypt and
Pakistan--countries that have relatively developed computer networks
and a growing pool of experienced hackers.</TE>
<TE>   Energy power systems have ironically become a choice target
because of efforts to modernize them for greater efficiency. The weak
link--a group of remote control devices known as Supervisory Control
and Data Acquisition systems--"have been designed with little or no
attention to security," according to a recent report by the National
Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   The systems, which are used to control the flow of oil and water
through pipelines, and monitor power grids, were once impervious to
hackers because they were completely isolated from other computer
systems.</TE>
<TE>   Today many such systems are connected to the Internet, and
therefore vulnerable to hacking. The FBI also blames a rapid increase
in hacking attacks in recent years on the proliferation of hacking
software posted online. Such tools require little computer expertise,
are readily available worldwide and are becoming increasingly simple
to use. Some are directly applicable to electrical power systems.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the places [hackers] are certainly attacking are those
known vulnerabilities," Dick said. "The rise in the number of
incidents reflects of the ease with which these tools are utilized."</TE>
<TE>   Surreptitious hacking tests conducted by special Defense
Department information warfare squads known as "red teams" in 1997
found power grid control systems susceptible to attacks; recent,
similar vulnerability testing by Riptech for its own clients resulted
in network penetrations virtually 100% of the time, Belcher said.</TE>
<TE>   "Two years ago, there were people who didn't have a clue--who
said, 'Why would somebody want to attack us?' That is not the case
today," said Will Evans, vice president of People's Energy, a
diversified power company in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is not today, but tomorrow," he said. "Whatever
you've got today someone may discover and exploit against that
tomorrow.... You need to finance a very active cyber-security
program."</TE>
<TE>   Evans, consistent with the policy of nearly all energy companies,
declined to comment on specific attacks against his company.</TE>
<TE>   Even using advanced computer forensic methods, law enforcement
officials cannot identify the individual hackers behind the barrage
of attacks on power companies.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington Post reported last month that some government
officials suspect the Al Qaeda terrorist network of plotting
cyber-terrorist actions against power stations and emergency services
in the San Francisco Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   Riptech's Belcher, a former cyber-security consultant for the
Defense Department, is skeptical of such claims, saying that the
ability to wage effective information warfare is many levels beyond
the ability to merely penetrate a network.</TE>
<TE>   "I see no evidence that there are expert cyber-terrorists today,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although a concentration of attacks come from countries identified
with terrorist groups, he cautioned that many such countries are
major energy producers--suggesting that the hacks may be the product
of more mundane industrial espionage, rather than terrorism.
Similarly, Hong Kong--a key financial center--is a hotbed for cyber
attacks on the financial services industry, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But some experts believe that some of the attacks may be a kind of
training exercise for terrorists. Al Qaeda worked for three years on
the Sept. 11 attacks, according to U.S. intelligence agencies, and
may be making a similar investment in cyber-terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "The terrorists out there are well-educated and determined to get
the training and knowledge to carry this out, and they are very
patient," Dick said.</TE>
<TE>   A number of terrorist organizations have developed rudimentary
technical skills. For example, in 1997, the Tamil Tigers, a Sri
Lankan rebel army known for terrorist bombings and assassinations,
hacked into and shut down the servers of Sri Lanka's embassies in
Seoul and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "Why haven't they done more of it? My main hypothesis is that they
didn't need to because their conventional weapons--the gun and the
bomb--were adequate," said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert with the
Rand Corp.</TE>
<TE>   But the new war on terrorism has hampered terrorists' ability to
operate elaborate base camps, and has dramatically tightened security
for physical infrastructure--from airports to power plants to
government buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Cyber-warfare may represent a safer, more effective alternative.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't need training camps or a robust logistical and
intelligence support structure," said Hoffman, "just a modem and a
safe house.... This is the ultimate anonymous attack."</TE>

<HD>Olerud Powers Mariners, 8-2</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Olerud believes he has as much bat speed now as he did when he
batted .363 as the American League batting champion with Toronto in
1993.</LD>
<LD>   Olerud hit two two-run homers and left-hander John Halama won his
first start since May 17, and the Seattle Mariners defeated the
Minnesota Twins, 8-2, Sunday at Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd like to think so," said Olerud, who left the New York Mets to
join the Mariners as a free agent in 2000. "I'm always tinkering with
my swing to get the ideal path to the ball. But I would think it
would be the same."</LD>
<TE>   Olerud, 33, is batting .314 with 15 home runs and a team-best 54
runs batted in. He is tied with Mike Cameron for the club lead in
homers.</TE>
<TE>   Olerud batted .302 with 21 homers and 95 RBIs in his first season
with the Mariners. He had a career-best 24 homers and 104 RBIs in
1993, when the Blue Jays were World Series champions for the second
consecutive year. He insists he's not a home run hitter.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a good day when I got some good swings at some
pitches and they went out for me," Olerud said.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Lou Piniella appreciates the consistent if unspectacular
Olerud, who won a Gold Glove at first base with Seattle in 2000.
Olerud played in 85 of Seattle's first 87 games.</TE>
<TE>   "Ole is a consistent pro," Piniella said. "He's just a steady
Eddie guy. He's not flashy, but he's there every day and he's fit and
he's productive. He's just the kind of guy you like in your lineup."</TE>
<TE>   The AL West-leading Mariners split a four-game series with the AL
Central-leading Twins to go into the All-Star break with a 55-33
record. They were 63-24 at the All-Star break last season, when they
tied the major league record with 116 victories.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 3, Kansas City 2--Barry Zito (11-3) became the first A's
pitcher with 11 victories at the All-Star break since Dave Stewart
(11) and Bob Welch (14) did it in 1990. He gave up six hits, walked
one and struck out nine in 7 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Zito tied an Oakland record with his 15th consecutive home
victory, matching Kenny Rogers. He hasn't lost a regular-season game
at home in 24 starts dating to June 2, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The A's (50-38) have their best record at the All-Star break since
starting 51-36 in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Royal starter Paul Byrd (11-6) had his three-game winning streak
end. He gave up three runs and eight hits in 5 2/3 innings. He was
attempting to become the first Royal pitcher to win 12 games before
the All-Star break since David Cone in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 9, Chicago 3--Milton Bradley hit a grand slam and Matt
Lawton had a three-run homer to spark an eight-run third inning at
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Ryan Drese (8-6) gave up four hits in seven-plus innings,
leaving in the eighth after he hit Ray Durham with a pitch and Travis
Fryman booted Tony Graffanino's grounder.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Shuey then struck out Magglio Ordonez, knocked down Paul
Konerko's liner and threw him out, and struck out Jeff Liefer as the
Indians held on to win two of three in the last series before the
All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 9, Boston 8--Carlos Pena had three hits and drove in the
game-winning run in the eighth inning at Boston in his first game for
the Tigers since being acquired from Oakland on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers led, 1-0, 4-2, 5-4 and 8-6, but the Red Sox kept coming
back, tying the score, 8-8, on Brian Daubach's second homer of the
game, a two-run shot in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 10, Texas 4--Tony Batista had two hits during a
seven-run fourth inning at Arlington, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Batista, the only Oriole going to Milwaukee as an All-Star,
started the rally with a one-out single and scored the tying run when
Marty Cordova followed with a triple. His run-scoring double later in
the inning gave the Orioles a 7-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Rodriguez, the only All-Star for the Rangers and the AL's
starting shortstop, homered. He leads the AL with 27 homers and 73
RBIs.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: They finish off sweep of Devil Rays and close in

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was every reason for the Angels to collectively take a deep
breath and relax. The difficult part of the season is still ahead of
them.</LD>
<LD>   They survived three days with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, finishing
up a series sweep with a 2-1, 10-inning victory Sunday. All three
games were decided by one run, two in extra innings. All were won by
hits that look like line drives in the box score, but in reality fall
into the dinker category.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Salmon did the honors Sunday, flaring a two out single just
beyond the infield to score pinch-runner Jose Nieves with the
game-winner, sending the Angels into the All-Star break three games
behind Seattle in the AL West.</LD>
<TE>   "I got jammed, but it was a beautiful thing," Salmon said. "If you
put all three of those [game-winning] hits together, they probably
are a shallow fly out."</TE>
<TE>   It came too late to help starter Ramon Ortiz, who gave up a home
run by Randy Winn to start the game. Ortiz then dominated before
leaving to a standing ovation from the 26,446 at Edison Field after
an impressive nine-inning performance.</TE>
<TE>   This is the 10th time since 1986 that the Angels have reached the
All-Star break either in first place or within five games.
Post-mortems, not postseasons, have been the result each time.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have three days to ponder such things. Then they will
spend the second half of the season chasing Mariners and shooing
demons.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is running up pennants around here yet," Angel Manager
Mike Scioscia said. "We still have a mountain to climb to get to
first place. That tempers everything. We know we have a challenge
ahead of us."</TE>
<TE>   Since winning their last division title in 1986, the Angels have
had a winning record in September only twice, a tribute to freak
occurrences and massive collapses, low-lighted by the Angels blowing
an 11-game lead in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   They were 6-21 last September and won only two of their last 21
games.</TE>
<TE>   "I think communities remember things like that," Salmon said.
"Players have short memories. Teams change, players come and go. Each
year is different. The past is the past."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat
it.</TE>
<TE>   School is in session right away for the Angels, as their season
could go either way shortly after the All-Star break. They have a
four-game series at Kansas City when they return, then play their
next 20 games against Minnesota, Seattle, Oakland, New York and
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to be a little more consistent," pitcher Jarrod Washburn
said. "We had a long stretch where we played great. We have been
going through a stretch where we've been playing mediocre. We don't
have to be great, but we can't be mediocre."</TE>
<TE>   They were both Sunday. The batters were mediocre. Ortiz was great.</TE>
<TE>   The Angel offense amounted to two excuse-me singles by Salmon.</TE>
<TE>   He tied the score in the fourth inning with a jam shot that fell
just beyond the reach of shortstop Chris Gomez.</TE>
<TE>   Devil Ray starter Tanyon Sturtze, who has a deceiving 1-9 record,
went nine innings, giving up only the one run.</TE>
<TE>   It was the third time this season Sturtze has pitched nine
innings. All three have been no-decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like we're scuffling, but we have been hitting the ball
hard," Salmon said. "We hit some balls to the warning track today
where you had to think, 'What is it going to take?' But it's the
broken bat hits and the ones that fall in between that make the
difference sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz made sure the offensive inertia didn't hurt the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels might not need to pick up a power hitter before the
trade deadline. They already have a player on a 40-home run pace.
Unfortunately for them, he pitches every fifth day.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz gave up his major league-high 26th home run with his third
pitch, as Winn looped a home run into the right-field corner seats to
give the Devil Rays a 1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz was in control after that, retiring 22 of the next 24
batters before John Flaherty led off the eighth with a double.</TE>

<HD>Expos Looking to Make Major Deals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The surprising Montreal Expos, having already made one big deal, went
into the All-Star break trying to close another trade to get
outfielder Cliff Floyd and right-hander Ryan Dempster from the
Florida Marlins.</LD>
<LD>   The Expos also were discussing a deal that would bring them
right-hander Orlando Hernandez from the New York Yankees.</LD>
<LD>   They boosted their postseason chances June 27 by getting pitcher
Bartolo Colon from Cleveland.</LD>
<TE>   The Expos, who survived baseball's off-season plan to eliminate
them, trail Atlanta by 9 1/2 games in the National League East. They
are five games behind Arizona in the wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   To add Floyd to their outfield and Dempster to their rotation, the
Expos discussed trading pitchers Masato Yoshii and Graeme Lloyd and
three prospects to the Marlins, two people familiar with the talks
said Sunday, speaking on the condition they not be identified.</TE>
<TE>   One of those is double-A pitcher Josh Karp, a former UCLA star who
was on the U.S. team in Sunday's Futures game as part of All-Star
week.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of rumors flying around," Karp said. "It's a
crazy situation, seeing a lot of guys in the organization being
traded."</TE>
<TE>   The Expos need approval from Major League Baseball to raise their
payroll.</TE>
<TE>   Marlin owner Jeffrey Loria sold the Expos to the other 29 teams in
February after the contraction plan fell through.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Randy Johnson became the latest pitcher to back out of the
All-Star game, opting to prepare for the second half of the season
instead of pitching for the National League.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, San Francisco closer Robb Nen and Philadelphia
starter Vicente Padilla were added to the NL team as injury
replacements. They will replace Atlanta's Tom Glavine and St. Louis'
Matt Morris.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, 12-3 with a 2.47 ERA for Arizona, wants to prepare for
his next start Thursday in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an honor to be selected," Johnson said after the
Diamondbacks' 5-2 loss to San Francisco in Arizona on Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's in my best interest to rest the next couple of days and
be physically and mentally ready."</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta setup man Mike Remlinger was picked as Johnson's
replacement. It will be his first All-Star appearance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shortstop Alex Gonzalez of the Marlins was taken to a Miami
hospital for tests after he woke up with stomach pains.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez was later transferred to Holy Cross Hospital in Fort
Lauderdale, where he remained Sunday afternoon for further
evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   Team officials did not know if any problems had been found and
were unsure if Gonzalez would remain there overnight.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Oakland Athletics made room on their roster for newly acquired
left-hander Ted Lilly by optioning right-hander Mike Fyhrie to
triple-A Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland got Lilly from the Yankees in a three-team trade that also
involved Detroit.</TE>

<HD>Williams Made Big Impact on First Sight</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The first time I saw Ted Williams was the morning of April 12, 1936.
I was playing for Pasadena High against Valencia in the Pomona 20-30
spring tournament when a ball came rolling past the center fielder
and into the infield.</LD>
<LD>   Where could it have come from? We looked across the vast playing
field to where another game was being played and saw a tall, skinny
kid jogging around the bases. It was the "Splendid Splinter" at 18, a
pitcher for San Diego Hoover. It was one of two homers he hit that
morning against South Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   There were no fences between the two fields. The ball that rolled
into our diamond had to have gone 600 feet.</LD>
<TE>   That afternoon, Williams hit another home run and pitched a
five-hitter in a 7-0 victory over Pasadena in the championship game.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later, he was an All-Star with the Boston Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who hit the first home run in an All-Star game?</TE>
<TE>   Sounds like Yogi: The Dallas Morning News' Frank Luksa quotes
Mulligan's Laws for the way to best improve your golf game: "Go back
and take it up at a much earlier age."</TE>
<TE>   Turnabout: Bill Veeck once hired a hypnotist to convince his St.
Louis Browns that they could hit. Mickey Herskowitz of the Houston
Chronicle recalls that halfway through the 1944 season, Coach Zack
Taylor had had enough.</TE>
<TE>   "How about waking up my guys and putting the other team to sleep
for a change," he told the hypnotist.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Opinionated: Charles Barkley, on NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon:
"Jeff Gordon is the perfect guy for sports, he's a good guy, he's the
best at what he does, religious, just a good person. People who boo
him are just idiots."</TE>
<TE>   Hello, Tom Arnold: Two views of Fox's "Best Damn Sports Show
Period":</TE>
<TE>   From Blackie Sherrod of the Dallas News: "[It] makes a valuable
contribution to education. Frees up a couple hours nightly to spend
reading."</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Marchand, in the New York Post: "[It's] supposed to appeal
to the young demographic ... some TV execs think this age group is
about as sophisticated as a beer can."</TE>
<TE>   All juiced up: Bob Hille, in the Sporting News, asks the question:
"Let me see if I have this straight. Ken Caminiti's old team now
plays in a stadium [Minute Maid Park] named for juice?"</TE>
<TE>   The name game: Could a U.S. Auto Club champion have any better
name than Scott Speed? He is the Formula Russell champion.</TE>
<TE>   Changing times: Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News notes
that "Pete Sampras used to be tense. Now, it looks as if he's past
tense."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Babe Ruth, in the third inning of the first game,
July 6, 1933, against Wild Bill Hallahan of the St. Louis Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Manager Carlos Tosca, who inherited the Toronto Blue
Jays from the fired Buck Martinez earlier this season, has become
something of a philosopher while watching the team fall 20 1/2 games
behind the New York Yankees in the American League East.</TE>
<TE>   "Life and this game," he said, "give you opportunity for
adversity."</TE>

<HD>It All Goes South for Dodgers</HD>
<DH>Baseball: L.A. doesn't look like first-place team in 12-6
loss to St. Louis, but Tracy stresses big picture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>For one steamy afternoon in Busch Stadium on Sunday, the Dodgers
seemed to forget everything they did to surge into first place in the
National League West heading into the All-Star break.</LD>
<LD>   The superb starting pitching that has been a hallmark of this
team, the solid relief, the persistent offense, the seamless defense
... the Dodgers showed none of it, with the exception of a few early
clutch hits, in a 12-6 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals before a crowd
of 33,777.</LD>
<LD>   Placido Polanco had a career-high five hits, Eduardo Perez hit a
three-run homer off Dodger starter Omar Daal in the first inning,
Edgar Renteria had three hits, including a solo homer in the first,
and Albert Pujols had three hits, including a game-breaking,
three-run homer in the fourth, to pace the Cardinals' 17-hit attack.</LD>
<TE>   Daal, who gave up three earned runs in 17 innings of his last
three starts, all victories, was bombed for eight runs and eight hits
in 3 2/3 innings, Giovanni Carrara gave up Pujols' homer, and Terry
Mulholland gave up three runs in a rocky sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Left fielder Hiram Bocachica, who entered as a pinch-hitter in the
sixth, and center fielder Marquis Grissom suffered a communication
breakdown on Renteria's sixth-inning fly, which fell for a hit.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Cardinals employed a bullpen relay, using six relievers
after Bud Smith was demoted from the rotation Saturday, the Dodgers
(54-34) managed only one run after the third inning.</TE>
<TE>   It was the kind of loss that could leave a sour taste over the
break, perhaps spoiling the Dodgers' frame of mind before a crucial
four-game series against Arizona begins Thursday. So Manager Jim
Tracy held a brief postgame team meeting to stress the big picture
over Sunday's ugly snapshot.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them I'm extremely proud of what they accomplished," Tracy
said. "We have 74 games left, and no one should feel the least bit
disappointed about any effort they've given. We're 20 games over .500
and in first place. We split a [5-5] road trip against three very
good clubs, Anaheim, Arizona and St. Louis. I'm extremely proud of
what this team has done."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers showed some resiliency Sunday, erasing a four-run,
first-inning deficit with three runs in the second and two in the
third to take a 5-4 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Daal (RBI groundout), Dave Roberts (RBI bunt single) and Shawn
Green (RBI single) knocked in the second-inning runs, and Roberts hit
a bases-loaded, two-out single in the third for two more.</TE>
<TE>   But Daal, who said he was not feeling any lingering effects from
recent biceps and groin injuries, gave up Mike DiFelice's RBI double
and Polanco's RBI single in the fourth before being pulled in favor
of Carrara. Carrara gave up his second home run in as many days,
Pujols' three-run shot to left that gave the Cardinals a 9-5 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Frustration was not limited to Dodger pitchers. Roberts was not
happy about being pulled in favor of Bocachica in the sixth inning
with a left-hander, Mike Matthews, on the mound for St. Louis and the
Dodgers trailing, 9-5.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts had two singles and three RBIs in his first three at-bats.
Though he hasn't started against a left-hander all season and has
only 12 at-bats against left-handers--with five hits--the Cardinals
had several right-handed relievers who were expected to be used in
later innings, a strong reason to leave Roberts in.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said he thought Bocachica had a better chance of hitting a
two-run home run that would have cut the lead in half, but the
seldom-used Bocachica hit into a 5-4-3 double play, which was
magnified by Paul Lo Duca's ensuing walk and Shawn Green's double.
Eric Karros flied out to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what? All I can say is it's his decision," said Roberts,
reluctant to criticize a manager who gave him his first starting job
in the big leagues. "He felt in that situation that [Bocachica] gave
us the best chance to win."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy also pulled Roberts from a June 5 game in Colorado--even
though right-handed Jose Jimenez was pitching--after Roberts singled
three times in four at-bats. Pinch-hitter Dave Hansen struck out with
a runner on in the eighth inning, and the Dodgers lost, 8-6.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I want to be in there, but I'm not the manager, it's
not my decision to make," Roberts said. "All I can do is make the
most of my opportunities and make that decision tougher and tougher."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Cora Lost His Job, but Not His Drive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Alex Cora lost his starting shortstop job in spring training, but he
has not lost a position of prominence with the Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   The reserve infielder has contributed in pinch-hitting and
spot-starting roles, batting .298 with two homers and 11 runs batted
in, and his first-half performance, combined with the struggles of
second baseman Mark Grudzielanek and shortstop Cesar Izturis, will
net Cora more playing time in the second half, Manager Jim Tracy said
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the one guy who, when decisions were made in spring
training, could have decided to go in the other direction," Tracy
said. "You know what? To say he's been a consummate professional
isn't enough.</LD>
<TE>   "He chose the high road, and he will be forever grateful to
himself for doing that, because it may have added years to his resume
as a major league player. And I haven't ruled out the possibility of
Alex being an everyday player again."</TE>
<TE>   Cora leads the team with eight pinch-hits in 24 at-bats, including
his clutch RBI double that tied the score against the Cardinals, 5-5,
in the sixth inning Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers won, 6-5. Cora has been superb defensively, starting
or turning several key double plays and making several difficult
plays in the hole or up the middle.</TE>
<TE>   "I went through a lot last year," said Cora, who hit .217 and
committed 20 errors in 2001. "It was a bad season, and I embarrassed
myself. I don't want to embarrass myself in the job I have."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While Izturis' .230 average is not a concern because he has
provided consistent--and sometimes terrific--defense and is batting
.304 from the right side, Grudzielanek (.245) and third baseman
Adrian Beltre (.238) are major concerns for the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy batted Grudzielanek eighth to start the season, in hopes of
bolstering the bottom of the order, but Grudzielanek has not found a
consistent stroke.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre has been even more disappointing, mixing a team-high 15
errors with his sporadic offense and inconsistent approach.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre, who was given Sunday off, has frustrated the Dodgers
because he has not come close to filling the considerable potential
they believe he has. He has seven home runs and only 29 RBIs, 48
strikeouts and 22 walks. He has a .288 on-base percentage.</TE>
<TE>   "If [Grudzielanek] got locked in to what he's capable of doing, it
would be a huge lift for us," Tracy said. "That extra hit in that
spot, the extra run, how would that change how I use our bullpen? How
would it affect the pitching staff? It would be a big boost if one or
both of them came around."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Though Izturis is hitting .199 from the left side, the Dodgers
don't want him to give up switch-hitting. "If he was 28 or 29, maybe
the answer would be yes," Tracy said, when asked if Izturis should
hit exclusively from the right side. "But at 22? Some guys are
getting drafted at that age. I don't want him to stop."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tracy didn't start Brian Jordan on Sunday, but the left fielder
entered in the seventh as a pinch-hitter. The former Cardinal, who
suffered several cramps because of dehydration in Arizona, said
Saturday's 97-degree heat in St. Louis was the worst he had ever
felt.</TE>
<TE>   "It really beat me up," said Jordan, who homered in the fourth
inning and struck out in his last three at-bats. "[After the home
run] I was through. I went downhill from there. I think I was blind
by my last at-bat. I was delirious out there. Delusional."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry Kelly was walking up the 18th fairway when he saw the Western
Open gallery stand and begin applauding him.</LD>
<LD>   Chills ran through his body. Except for winning a major, it
couldn't get any better for a guy from nearby Madison, Wis.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly was sizzling Sunday, shooting a seven-under 65 to win the
Western Open at Lemont, Ill., by two strokes. Any time someone
mounted a challenge, he held them off with a birdie. In all, he had
eight.</LD>
<TE>   "All of my friends and family are here. It doesn't get any better
than that," said Kelly, who gave out 50 tickets this week.</TE>
<TE>   "These are people I've gotten tickets for to these tournaments the
last seven years. They were just coming out to support me, watch me
play. They didn't really care if I won.</TE>
<TE>   "For me to win it for them, to have them have that much fun, I
really enjoyed being able to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly finished at 19-under 269, two strokes off the Western Open
record. Davis Love III finished second. He shot a six-under 66 but
made bogey on the 17th to cost himself any chance he had of winning.</TE>
<TE>   After going his first six years on tour without a victory, Kelly
has won twice this year.</TE>
<TE>   With a victory at the Sony Open in January, he joins Tiger Woods,
Phil Mickelson and Len Mattiace as the only multiple winners this
season. He earned $720,000, giving him a career-high $2.39 million
this year.</TE>
<TE>   "This was something I could really savor," Kelly said. "It was
unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tom Jenkins had five birdies over the final nine holes and shot a
seven-under 64 to win the Canada Senior Open for the second time in
three years.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins, the first-round leader after a 63, finished with an
18-under 195 total, three shots ahead of Walter Morgan, Morris
Hatalsky and Bruce Lietzke at the 6,703-yard Essex Golf and Country
Club course in LaSalle, Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins, who won $240,000, clinched the win with a long birdie
putt on No. 16 for a three-stroke lead. He won the tournament in
2000, tied for second in 1998 and finished fourth in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan, who tied a Senior PGA Tour record with a 60 on Saturday,
followed up with a 65.</TE>
<TE>   He tied the tour record for low score over the final 36 holes with
a 125. He had 21 birdies over the final two days after shooting a
two-over 73 Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had played good the first day I would have run away with
it," Morgan said.</TE>

<HD>Fishing's Fast Lane</HD>
<DH>Kayak anglers have several advantages, and when they hook
up, it's quite a ride</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENA VISTA, Mexico</DL>
<LD>With the shout, "Coming through!" Dennis Spike embarked on one of his
patented "Baja sleigh rides," over a glassy sea glimmering with life,
but with the stench of death filling the air.</LD>
<LD>   The scene was as surreal as it was comical. A virtual armada of
cruisers and skiffs had converged around the rotting carcass of a
whale that had been discovered floating offshore a few days earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Beneath the whale were thousands of dorado, Baja California's most
colorful and acrobatic game fish, which love to congregate under
floating objects, particularly those so large and blubbery, and in
deep decay.</LD>
<TE>   And there was Spike, atop his white plastic kayak, following the
lead of a fish he had hooked moments earlier, being pulled swiftly
through an obstacle course of boats that actually belong so far out
at sea.</TE>
<TE>   It soon became clear, however, that Spike and his four companions,
all from Southern California, were not in over their heads, after
all. They were very much in their element.</TE>
<TE>   Spike soon had alongside his vessel a radiant bull dorado,
flashing neon colors of gold and green. It was gaffed and quickly
picked up by the crew of the cruiser, or mother ship, that delivered
the fishermen and their vessels to the whale.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Chasten then matched that with a fish just as big, one
weighing about 35 pounds and measuring half as long as his kayak.
Howard Rose and Brian Campbell were next, taking sleigh rides in
opposite directions, Rose landing his fish and Campbell losing his.</TE>
<TE>   What was remarkable about this was that the bite had been
excruciatingly slow for the fishermen aboard the bigger boats,
presumably because there had been so much fishing pressure, and so
much boat noise, in recent days.</TE>
<TE>   Only the kayakers were hooking up. And while the other fishermen
were amused early on, they were soon cursing under their breaths at
the sight of another dorado-powered kayaker whizzing by, following
the bend in his rod.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what we do," Spike said, after the fifth and final
fish--the largest was a 42-pounder--had been pulled aboard the mother
ship. "The kayaks give us stealth and mobility, which they don't
have. Plus, we're so low that we're able to better present the bait
[in this case live sardines], and we almost always out-fish the
bigger boats."</TE>
<TE>   The Kayak Advantage</TE>
<TE>   Spike, 43, is one of kayak-fishing's pioneers. A former
chiropractor and a trained tobacconist, he owns Coastal Kayak Fishing
(www.kayakfishing.com) in Reseda. It features equipment sales,
discussion boards and guided trips, including occasional excursions
out of Rancho Leonero Resort in Baja's East Cape region.</TE>
<TE>   "This is absolute nirvana for the kayak fisherman," Spike said of
the East Cape, because of the abundance of large and powerful game
fish both offshore and inshore.</TE>
<TE>   But the kayaks, he added, have the same advantages in Southland
waters.</TE>
<TE>   Spike made his first trip off Malibu 14 years ago, with Rose, his
cousin and a producer who has a home in the area.</TE>
<TE>   "I caught a 25-pound halibut and we caught a slew of calico bass,
all released, and from there I was hooked," Spike said.</TE>
<TE>   He fished 150 days that year, at an average cost of $7 to $10 a
day, "including our fuel to get there, our food and our bait and
tackle." A daily trip on a half-day boat, with all factors
considered, can cost three times that.</TE>
<TE>   The kayak-fishing tackle is the same stuff you'd take on a party
boat--conventional reels spooled with 10- to 30-pound test, depending
on the fish being targeted, and standard hooks and lures.</TE>
<TE>   The bait is caught with a light-line multi-hook gangion and stored
in plastic bait wells dragged alongside the kayaks.</TE>
<TE>   The kayaks are open, sit-on-top vessels, some with hatches that
serve as fish-storage wells. They're outfitted with rod holders
behind the seats, and are sturdy enough so that catching 50- or even
100-pound fish is within the realm of possibility. A kayak thus
outfitted sells for about $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Spike's most memorable experience north of the border was during
the spring of 2000. Squid had flooded into an area along the coast in
northern Malibu, and with them came an enormous school of predatory
white seabass.</TE>
<TE>   Spike and Campbell were first on the scene. Spike
was slow-trolling a live sardine; Campbell was pulling a lure. Spike
hooked up first.</TE>
<TE>   "My rod went bendo, I set the hook, put my feet back up on the
deck of the kayak, because I had been sitting with my feet over the
side, and I went for a 1,000-yard sleigh ride," he said. "After four
tremendous runs, the fish came to the rail and it was a 75-pound
white seabass, two inches short of five feet, 32 inches around. The
fight was 35-40 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "[Campbell], while following me, got hooked up and landed a
58-pound white seabass. The next 10 weeks produced a bite that, while
it was reported, was never appreciated by anyone but us on our
kayaks. I went on to catch six over 60 pounds, five over 50 and a
handful of 40s, 30s and 20s. It was the most epic white seabass bite
we had ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   Of the potential danger posed by sharks, while sitting so
precariously on kayaks, Spike said there is only one to be concerned
about--the great white, which has yet to cause any problems.</TE>
<TE>   Off Malibu, most of the run-ins have been with thresher sharks,
which have long, slashing tails but small bodies and very small
mouths.</TE>
<TE>   "I've caught dozens of threshers that have approached
the 200-pound mark," Spike said. "They're so tired after the fight that
you can get them right up to the kayak and pop the hook out with a
pair of pliers."</TE>
<TE>   East Cape Connection</TE>
<TE>   Through a cooperative agreement with John Ireland, owner of Rancho
Leonero Resort (www.rancholeonero.com), Spike conducts seasonal
guided trips to the East Cape, an area many consider superior to even
the famed Cabo San Lucas, at Land's End 75 miles to the south.</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Leonero, like the half-dozen other nearby resorts, is
strictly a fishing destination, though snorkeling and diving are
popular side trips.</TE>
<TE>   The run to the fishing grounds can be as short as five minutes and
is rarely longer than an hour, as a gaping underwater canyon, which
serves as a thoroughfare for such blue-water game fish as marlin,
sailfish and tuna, runs conveniently close to the beach.</TE>
<TE>   For kayakers, exotics such as dorado and tuna can sometimes be
reached simply by paddling a mile or so off the beach, although the
most popular inshore species are roosterfish, jack crevalle, snapper
and pompano.</TE>
<TE>   The inshore fishing is spectacular here as these ferocious
predators herd the smaller baitfish into areas along the beach, and
sometimes even onto the beach itself.</TE>
<TE>   Ireland is among hotel owners hoping to capitalize on the
increasing popularity of kayak fishing. He bought a small fleet seven
years ago and rents them mostly to those seeking a break from the
long and sometimes monotonous days aboard a cruiser or panga.</TE>
<TE>   The break can be refreshing as well as rewarding, especially if it
involves fishing with an expert such as Spike.</TE>
<TE>   "Things happen around you when you're fishing on a kayak
that don't happen on boats," he said. "You're part of the fishery instead
of something intruding into it.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been here with hundreds of manta rays jumping all around me.
We've seen marlin free jumping. We've had entire schools of tuna blow
through us. We've paddled along when the fish weren't biting, but
we've had schools of 50- and 60-pound dorado and jacks swimming
together in massive schools right by us. That's an experience enough
to make your day."</TE>
<TE>   For his clients, snappers and jacks are usually available to some
degree, but they're extremely powerful and can be difficult to land
as they run for structure after feeling the sting of the hook.</TE>
<TE>   Roosterfish are bigger and even stronger and, while they seldom
run for the rocks, they've been known to spool even the largest of
reels.</TE>
<TE>   Spike's most popular season down here is the steamy month of
August, when large schools of yellowfin tuna enter the Sea of Cortez.
Because the best fishing often takes place well offshore, and because
the tuna can weigh as much as 100 pounds, the mother ship comes in
particularly handy.</TE>
<TE>   "The mother ship cuts down on our paddling time," Spike said. "It
can shuttle us to an area, supply us with live bait and drop off food
and drinks while we're fishing. It can also collect our fish and ice
them down as soon as possible, because one of the most popular things
on our trips is, every night on the hotel patio, having some type of
sashimi."</TE>
<TE>   The Elusive Marlin</TE>
<TE>   A new day has dawned and up with the glowing red sun are Spike and
his companions, preparing for another run to the fishing grounds,
this time with hopes of battling the mighty marlin.</TE>
<TE>   It's an ambitious, if not foolish plan, as an angry marlin could
easily skewer a fisherman sitting so vulnerably atop a kayak. But the
feat has been accomplished by a few, without anyone being skewered,
and Spike is hoping to join the club.</TE>
<TE>   The day begins with an hour-long run south, via mother ship, to
Bahia Los Frailes, beyond a towering, jagged headland that forms the
easternmost point on the peninsula. The group hopes to warm up with a
few large roosters or jacks, but the fish don't cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   The kayaks are stored on the bow and the run is made offshore,
through an azure sea aflutter with flying fish and teeming with
playful dolphins. Conditions are prime, but there are no signs of
marlin. An hour passes, then another.</TE>
<TE>   Spike remains optimistic, and reflects to the time he caught his
lone billfish on a kayak, an estimated 120-pound sailfish in the fall
of 2000. The fish did lots of jumping, but offered little in the way
of a sleigh ride.</TE>
<TE>   "The last jump was only six feet off my left shoulder," Spike
said. "And that's when I realized that I could have been speared and
killed by this fish."</TE>
<TE>   He has no such worries on this increasingly blustery day.</TE>
<TE>   The search for marlin is called off and the captain has set
a course for the calmer inner waters, from which Campbell will pluck
the catch of the day, a 10-pound snapper that will serve as dinner
back at the hotel.</TE>

<HD>Schumacher Prevails in British Grand Prix</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once again, Michael Schumacher proved that he's the best Formula One
driver, winning the British Grand Prix for his seventh victory of the
season and the 60th of his career. Next, he'll try to match a racing
legend.</LD>
<LD>   Schumacher beat intermittent rain with timely tire changes and
smart driving during the 60-lap race on the Silverstone, England,
circuit Sunday, winning his second British Grand Prix and moving
closer to his fifth series title.</LD>
<LD>   Rubens Barrichello, Schumacher's Ferrari teammate, finished
second. It was the fourth 1-2 finish for Ferrari this season. Juan
Pablo Montoya of BMW Williams was third.</LD>
<TE>   The victory gave Schumacher a decisive 54-point lead over
Barrichello with seven races left. He could match Juan Manuel
Fangio's record of five titles at the French Grand Prix in two weeks
or at the German Grand Prix on July 28.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he was thinking about clinching in two weeks, Schumacher
feigned ignorance: "Can I? I don't know. I haven't calculated my
points yet."</TE>
<TE>   Said Montoya: "He doesn't really have to think about it. He's got
it in his pocket already."</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you. But let's wait and see," Schumacher replied.</TE>
<TE>   BAR Honda's Jacques Villeneuve was fourth, followed by teammate
Olivier Panis and Nick Heidfeld of Sauber. Villeneuve, the 1997
season champion, earned his first points since last year's Italian
Grand Prix.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher considers the British Grand Prix among his most
important victories.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very special win for me for the circumstances, the
conditions," said Schumacher, who won the race in 1998. "I have not
finished first here very often and this was my 60th. We were not
expecting rain and I struggled a little bit in the wet."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cristiano da Matta just keeps on winning. He led from start to
finish in the Toronto Molson-Indy, matching the CART record of four
consecutive victories and extending his series points lead.</TE>
<TE>   Da Matta started from the pole and led all 112 laps on the
1.755-mile, 11-turn street course.</TE>
<TE>   He was virtually unchallenged, building leads of up to 12 seconds
and driving his Toyota-powered Lola across the finish line 4.398
seconds--about half a straightaway--ahead of Kenny Brack.</TE>
<TE>   "The Newman-Haas team is just working well together right now," Da
Matta said. "We're just collecting the fruits that have been growing
since last year."</TE>
<TE>   Brack finished just ahead of Christian Fittipaldi, Da Matta's
teammate on the team owned by actor-racer Paul Newman and Chicago
businessman Carl Haas.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was Da Matta's fifth of the season and seventh in the
last 10 races. The four in a row match the CART record set by Al
Unser Jr. in 1990 and tied by Alex Zanardi in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Airton Dare can thank Tomas Scheckter's bad luck for his first
Indy Racing League victory and A.J. Foyt's first win as an owner in
three years.</TE>
<TE>   Dare took advantage of a second-chance restart after Scheckter's
late crash--the only wreck of the day--and passed Sam Hornish Jr.
with less than three laps left to win the Ameristar Casino 200 at
Kansas Speedway in Kansas City, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis 500 winner Helio Castroneves finished third, followed
by Felipe Giaffone and Gil de Ferran. Castroneves leads De Ferran by
eight points and Hornish, the defending IRL champion, by 19 in the
season's standings.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Harvard won three titles on the final day of the Henley Regatta at
Henley-on-Thames, England, beating a second Crimson team in one of
the finals.</TE>
<TE>   Its top eight beat Molesey from London by 2 3/4 lengths to win the
Ladies' Plate, the event's No. 2 international eights race.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, the Harvard "B" crew crossed the line 1 3/4 lengths ahead
of its "A" crew in the first-ever all-American and one-club final of
the Britannia Cup for coxed fours. The Crimson also won the Temple
Cup for college eights.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jay Gruden threw six touchdown passes and the Orlando Predators
converted four turnovers into 21 points in a 55-48 victory over the
Tampa Bay Storm in an Arena League game at Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay (4-8) got within 41-34, but the Predators (6-6) held the
Storm to a long field goal attempt, which was wide and returned to
the Orlando 19-yard line. Gruden then threw an 18-yard touchdown pass
to Junior Lord with 55 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   American Adam Saathoff won his second medal at the shooting world
championships in Lahti, Finland, placing third in the running target
mixed runs. Hungary's Josef Sike finished first with 390 points.
Michael Jakosits of Germany tied Saathoff with 387 points, but had a
better score in the final round and finished second.</TE>

<LD>When Bruce Bochy looks out on the mound at Oliver Perez, he sees a
young Fernando Valenzuela.</LD>
<LD>   The 20-year-old rookie left-hander gave up one hit in 6 2/3
innings and struck out a career-high 13 and Ryan Klesko hit two home
runs Sunday as the San Diego Padres ended a six-game losing streak
with a 7-1 victory over the Colorado Rockies at Denver.</LD>
<LD>   "He reminds you of Fernando with completely different stuff,"
Bochy, the Padre manager, said. "He loves to compete and he loves to
play baseball."</LD>
<TE>   Perez (3-1) struck out the side in the second, fifth and sixth
innings in winning for the first time in three starts. He fell two
strikeouts short of the franchise single-game record of 15, set by
Sterling Hitchcock on Aug. 29, 1998, against Montreal, and by Fred
Norman on Sept. 17, 1972. He walked five and yielded only Larry
Walker's two-out double in the third inning.</TE>
<TE>   "That is nice being compared to Fernando," said Perez, who was
pitching at double-A Mobile of the Southern League until a month ago.
"I thought I should have been up sooner, but I waited for my chance.</TE>
<TE>   "My only disappointment was the walks and my high pitch count. I
want to tighten that up and go deeper into games."</TE>
<TE>   Ross Gload singled off Trevor Hoffman in the ninth for the
Rockies' only other hit.</TE>
<TE>   Klesko hit his 16th and 17th home runs and drove four runs. Ramon
Vazquez had four hits for the Padres, who avoided matching their
longest losing streak of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Chacon (3-6) struggled through 5 2/3 innings, giving up
three runs and nine hits in failing to win for his sixth consecutive
start.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 2, Chicago 0--Greg Maddux had perhaps his best start of
the season, John Smoltz picked up his 17th consecutive save and the
Braves kept the best record in the major leagues. What better way to
head to the All-Star break?</TE>
<TE>   Maddux pitched seven scoreless innings and gave up only three hits
at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Pitching on only three days rest, Maddux (8-2) got 11 ground outs
and threw only 82 pitches before turning the game over to Chris
Hammond, who pitched a scoreless eighth. Smoltz pitched a perfect
ninth for his 31st save in 34 chances.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves (56-32) won for the 15th time in 18 games and won their
13th consecutive series.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 6, Pittsburgh 1--Jose Vizcaino's two-run double keyed the
second five-run inning against Jimmy Anderson in as many starts and
Wade Miller held the Pirates to one run over six innings at
Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Miller struck out nine as he and three relievers combined for 14
strikeouts. Roy Oswalt, Octavio Dotel and Billy Wagner pitched an
inning each.</TE>
<TE>   The Astros outscored the Pirates, 27-13, in winning three of four
in a series that helped them stay 6 1/2 games behind St. Louis in the
NL Central. They went 7-2 on their trip and have won nine of 12.</TE>
<TE>   The Astros didn't get an RBI from Lance Berkman for the first time
in 11 games, but the major league leader in RBIs with 81 scored twice
after walking. Berkman's 10-game RBI streak was a club record, one
more than Bob Watson's nine-game streak in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 7, Cincinnati 4--Paul Bako and Jeffrey Hammonds homered
to lead the Brewers at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee starter Ruben Quevedo left one out short of qualifying
for the victory. Valerio De Los Santos (2-2) got the last out of the
fifth when Sean Casey flied to left with the bases loaded. Quevedo
walked four and struck out three in 4 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   De Los Santos got a painful assist on a double play in the next
inning. A line drive by Todd Walker caromed off his back to second
baseman Young, who threw to first to double off Russell Branyan.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 10, Montreal 8--Scott Rolen hit a two-out, two-run
homer in the bottom of the eighth inning and the Phillies avoided a
four-game sweep.</TE>
<TE>   Rolen hit a 1-0 pitch from Matt Herges (2-3) for his 13th homer.
Rheal Cormier (4-4) pitched a scoreless eighth for the victory and
Jose Mesa pitched the ninth for his 23rd save in 28 chances.</TE>
<TE>   New York 9, Florida 3--Jay Payton hit a three-run home run and
drove in a career-high five runs at Miami in a game that was stopped
four times because of rain.</TE>
<TE>   The game was halted a total of 3 hours 3 minutes--38 minutes in
the first inning, 17 minutes in the third, 1 hour 44 minutes in the
fourth and 24 minutes in the sixth.</TE>

<HD>Bonds Starts to Play Long Ball Again</HD>
<DH>Baseball: He hits three-run homer that helps Giants defeat
Diamondbacks to move within 41/2 games of Dodgers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds and the San Francisco Giants are looking like contenders
again.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds homered for the second game in a row, and the Giants
defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks, 5-2, Sunday night to split their
four-game series.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a great way to go into the All-Star break," Giant Manager
Dusty Baker said, "especially because the Dodgers lost."</LD>
<TE>   Arizona's loss kept the Diamondbacks 2 1/2 games behind the
first-place Dodgers in the NL West. The Giants are 4 1/2 back. Baker
expects a fast start for his team when play resumes.</TE>
<TE>   "I really believe that this year we're going to come back smoking
after the break," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds had gone 33 at-bats without a home run, his longest drought
this season, before hitting his first homer against Randy Johnson in
San Francisco's 3-2 victory Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   He followed with a three-run shot against Rick Helling on Sunday,
his 27th.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds was three for three with two walks, reaching base in every
plate appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Benito Santiago hit a two-run homer for the Giants, also against
Helling, who has given up a league-leading 21 home runs. Robb Nen
pitched the ninth for his 24th save in 27 tries.</TE>
<TE>   "Both of our All-Stars hit home runs, and our All-Star pitcher got
the save," Baker said, "so it was an All-Star day."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' homer gave the Giants a 5-1 lead and knocked out Helling
(7-7) after only 2 1/3 innings. He gave up five runs and four hits
while matching his shortest outing this season.</TE>
<TE>   Helling hurt his right ankle in a collision at the plate with the
Dodgers' Brian Jordan in his start Wednesday night, but he insisted
it didn't bother him. Baker disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I could tell he was limping around," Baker said. "He wasn't
throwing the same."</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Ryan Jensen (9-6) gave up two runs and seven hits in seven
innings for his third victory in a row. Jensen, 5-1 in his last seven
starts, struck out five and walked one. He leads the Giants in
victories.</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks sputtered again to finish 3-4 in a homestand
against the Dodgers and Giants. They were shut out by the Dodgers in
the first two games, then scored two runs in each of the last three
against San Francisco. They failed to homer during the homestand.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of amazing to look at our lineup and think we haven't
hit a home run for whatever it's been," Manager Bob Brenly said. "But
they'll come back, and they'll come in bunches.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're forced to try to come back against the Eric Gagnes
and Robb Nens of the world, it's going to make it pretty tough."</TE>

<LD>Kareem Rush, the Missouri guard the Lakers acquired in a draft-day
trade from the Toronto Raptors, scored nine points in 34 minutes in
his debut during the opening day of the Dada Summer Pro League at the
Pyramid in Long Beach on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 90-74, in front of a
standing-room only crowd of 5,000.</LD>
<LD>   "I was a little slow and rusty at the beginning because I haven't
played organized five-on-five basketball for over three months," said
Rush, who was four for seven from the field and made his only
three-point attempt.</LD>
<TE>   Mark Madsen and Jelani McCoy were the only players from last
season's Lakers to play. Madsen scored seven points and had nine
rebounds in 22 minutes. McCoy scored 11 points and had 12 rebounds in
39 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Former Arizona standout Bennett Davidson led the Lakers with 14
points.</TE>

<LD>Baseball, the institution, can't be ruined.</LD>
<LD>   No matter how hard we try.</LD>
<LD>   Baseball, the institution, is very lucky.</LD>
<TE>   On a day of lazy fun, of delicious anticipation, on a day when
Angel fans could look with hope toward the second half of the season,
could rub their hands and anticipate great coming series at Edison
Field against Seattle and Oakland, the Yankees and Red Sox, when they
could dare think of division titles and wild-card playoff spots,
Angel fans didn't want to think about not coming back.</TE>
<TE>   Today in Chicago, Major League Baseball Players Assn. executives
and team representatives will meet. There may be a vote to set a
strike date, possibly for some time in September. Maybe on Oct. 1 so
that the playoffs and World Series are threatened.</TE>
<TE>   If there is another baseball strike, Vladimir Quinn, a 42-year-old
father and maintenance worker from Phelan, will bring 6-year-old
Krystal and 4-year-old Boo back to the ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   "It's entertainment," Quinn said.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Helfant, 8, of Redondo Beach, had an easy answer to the
question. Would he come back to see these players again if there is a
strike? "Yes," Daniel said. Daniel's father shrugged and added, "He's
too young to get political."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon, Angel right fielder, thinks baseball is
indestructible.</TE>
<TE>   "It might be five years or 10 years or even 15 years," Salmon
says, "but the fans will be back. It's a great game. If you like the
game of baseball, you can't stop being a fan."</TE>
<TE>   It was Troy Glaus jersey day at Edison Field. Little girls had on
the big shirt. It would flap at their ankles and trip them up. Little
boys had on the big shirt. They would roll up the sleeves and try to
hit big home runs, just like Glaus, at the home run game out on the
concourse.</TE>
<TE>   "The bad thing about a strike," Jimmy Evers said, "is that I'm
just getting my son interested in the game. He'll pay attention to
something else if there is no baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Evers, 32, pointed to his 10-year-old son, Tony, who was wearing
the Glaus jersey and taking whacks at the concourse game. "He doesn't
care about the issues," he said. "Neither do I. Owners have money.
Players have money. I don't care how they divide up the money. Just
play ball."</TE>
<TE>   If there is another baseball strike, it will be for good reasons.
That's what Angel pitcher Jarrod Washburn says.</TE>
<TE>   While some of his teammates say they try to ignore the labor
issues, try to block out negotiation issues, Washburn reads. He
listens. He learns. He cares.</TE>
<TE>   "There are issues worth striking over," Washburn said. "Owners
want to take away things. We can't go backwards. It's a matter of
principle."</TE>
<TE>   It always is, isn't it?</TE>
<TE>   The owners always think they are saving the beautiful game from
ruination. The players always think they are fighting for their
working-place rights, rights that weren't granted for so many years.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Williams, who missed prime years of his baseball career
because he was fighting wars for freedom, would not have been able to
march himself off a baseball field to fight for more money for
himself. Williams adored the game and his time in it. Owners took
advantage of that.</TE>
<TE>   "Look," Salmon said, "the players now don't want to be the ones to
give back what other players have fought so hard to earn over the
last 20 years, guys like Curt Flood."</TE>
<TE>   Said Washburn: "Steel workers strike. Airline pilots strike.
People come back after the strike and fly."</TE>
<TE>   But those people have to fly. Baseball fans don't have to watch
baseball games. "No," Washburn said, "they don't. And maybe they'll
learn they don't have to. But if you love the game, you will come
back. I believe that."</TE>
<TE>   That sounds like the arrogance of a young man who gets to make
millions to play the game. Of course he loves it. Of course he would
come back. But how can Washburn speak for the working man who might
spend $100 on a Sunday afternoon for the tickets, the parking, the
hot dogs and sodas?</TE>
<TE>   Quinn speaks for that man.</TE>
<TE>   "It is entertainment, pure and simple," he said. "I can't speak
for others but I would come back after a strike."</TE>
<TE>   Quinn isn't a fan of the Angels. He is a fan of the game. Of
sports. Of the competition and the atmosphere. He'll go to minor
league games near Phelan, he'll come to Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn's children sat on the floor eating ice cream. Each wore a
Glaus jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus says he has no comment on the labor situation. "If a strike
happens," Glaus said, "it happens."</TE>
<TE>   The kids wearing his shirt wouldn't understand that. They think
Glaus is the luckiest guy around.</TE>
<TE>   Garret Anderson said he's not concerned about a strike. "What's
going to happen is going to happen," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Except for one thing. "I'm not concerned for me," Anderson said.
"But I am concerned for the fans, the people who actively pay money
to support the game. There will definitely be a point where they are
not going to come back. Definitely."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson brought up the fans. He wasn't asked. He wanted to speak
for them. He is one of the few, among owners and players, to do so.
Maybe someone will listen to Anderson. Probably they won't.</TE>

<HD>Sparks Hit Century Mark</HD>
<DH>WNBA: First-place L.A. ties a club record for most points,
routing Utah, 102-75.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two things were made clear Sunday when the Sparks reached the
season's halfway point.</LD>
<LD>   With a 14-2 record, the Sparks are a game better than they were at
this point last year. And Los Angeles beats Utah like no other team.</LD>
<LD>   The Sparks pounded the Starzz, 102-75, before 10,896 at Staples
Center. It was the Sparks' biggest scoring output this year, tying
the team record for points--set against Utah on June 28, 1999.</LD>
<TE>   The Sparks shot 53% (38 of 72) and led by as many as 30, putting
the team in a good frame of mind for its five-game trip that starts
in Seattle on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Yesterday while preparing for this game, we wanted to make sure
we set [the kind of] pace for how we're going to play on the road,"
said Spark Coach Michael Cooper, whose team leads Houston by a
half-game in the Western Conference. "Utah is no slouch; they're a
good defensive team and they can put points on the board.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to score 100 points. I wish all games could be like
this."</TE>
<TE>   They can be when the Sparks have their offense flowing. Lisa
Leslie, who celebrated her 30th birthday and was named the starting
center for the West All-Stars, scored 10 of her 13 points in the
first three minutes. She also gave her latest health update.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm feeling much better, and have put back on half of the 10
pounds I lost," said Leslie, who is listed at 170 pounds, and has
been fighting fatigue from flulike symptoms. "I've been trying to
replace every pound I lost with liquids. [The trainers] keep trying
to keep measuring what my weight is and replenish me with fluid."</TE>
<TE>   Tamecka Dixon looked especially good, making eight of 14 shots and
leading all scorers with 20. Mwadi Mabika and DeLisha Milton each had
14.</TE>
<TE>   Adrienne Goodson led Utah (10-6) with 14 points, making only four
of 18 shots. But she wasn't the only one throwing up bricks, as the
Starzz made only 25 of 69 (36.2%).</TE>
<TE>   "Utah is a team on the rise and they are playing well right now."
Dixon said. "We wanted to come out and assert ourselves immediately."</TE>
<TE>   The Starzz have been operating under the Western Conference radar
most of the season, serving as the bridge between the top teams--Los
Angeles and Houston--and everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad no one has been paying attention to us," Utah Coach
Candi Harvey said. "We've been trying to take things calmly and
orderly, one game at a time."</TE>
<TE>   But while the Starzz believe they can beat the Sparks or Comets,
Harvey knows her team has to prove it on the court.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way we could beat Los Angeles here is to turn it into a
half-court game and hope some of their shooters aren't having a hot
night," Harvey said. "That, and get some of their people in foul
trouble."</TE>
<TE>   The strategy had no teeth early. as the Sparks came out flying.
Leslie made her first three shots and scored eight of the Sparks'
first 10 points. Her scoring touch spread to her teammates. Eight of
the nine players who got into the game had at least one basket.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other WNBA games:</TE>
<TE>   Miami 65, Seattle 61--The Sol's Betty Lennox scored 19 points and
Pollyanna Johns Kimbrough had four of her 10 in overtime at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Portland 74, Sacramento 59--DeMya Walker scored 15 points as host
Portland extended its team-record winning streak to six games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sheryl Swoopes of the Houston Comets was the top vote-getter in
final fan balloting to choose the starters for the All-Star game.</TE>

<HD>Leipheimer on New Path</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE DESIMONE</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>LUXEMBOURG</DL>
<LD>Last Sept. 12, as most Americans awoke dazed and unsure about what
the future held, Levi Leipheimer knew exactly what was ahead of him:
a long, punishing climb up a mountain in the Picos de Europa range in
northern Spain.</LD>
<LD>   Leipheimer, then with the U.S. Postal Service cycling team, was
one of the few American athletes competing anywhere in the world.
Professional and college sports had gone dark within hours of the
terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   At the prestigious Tour of Spain, Leipheimer and his teammate
Chann McRae, Postal's only other American entrant, tried to absorb
what had happened.</LD>
<TE>   "It was surreal," Leipheimer said. "It was hard to stay focused.
There was talk about stopping, but in the end we decided it was best
to go on with life."</TE>
<TE>   As the riders began the final ascent, Leipheimer (pronounced
LYPE-heimer) dug in. "Show them what Americans are made of!" Postal
team director Johan Bruyneel exhorted over the radio.</TE>
<TE>   Leipheimer came in 29th that day, but he helped dictate the pace
on the way up to Lagos de Covadonga in Stage 5 of the three-week
race. It began the trip of his life--so far.</TE>
<TE>   His eventual third-place finish in the Vuelta enabled him to jump
to the Dutch team Rabobank. The newly minted 28-year-old team leader
is considered one of the few riders who might give defending Tour de
France champion Lance Armstrong a tussle.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect him to be strong," Armstrong said last month. "That's
what they hired him for."</TE>
<TE>   Leipheimer finished 18th in Saturday's Tour prologue, 16 seconds
behind Armstrong. Both men rolled in with the peloton--the main pack
of riders, whose finish times are all recorded equally--at the end of
Sunday's Stage 1, and thus are still 16 seconds apart.</TE>
<TE>   Leipheimer's performance at the Vuelta did come at some cost.
Postal's pre-designated race leader, 2000 Vuelta winner Roberto
Heras, felt betrayed and the rapport between the two disintegrated,
even though Leipheimer had the team's blessing to go all out.
Leipheimer's final time trial result bumped Heras off the podium to
fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Leipheimer, a native of Montana who splits his time between
California and Spain with his wife, former Canadian racer Odessa
Gunn, grew up in an action-oriented family. His parents were skiers
and ski instructors who owned a shop stocked with ski equipment in
the winter and bike gear in the summer.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted to be a professional cyclist enough to set out for
Europe on his own as a teenager. Leipheimer lived in hostels and
run-down flats in Belgium, working his way up from the amateur ranks
to a succession of U.S. pro teams, ending with his stint at Postal
from 1998 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "I had the innocence to put up with a lot of less-than-normal
living conditions," he said of his hardscrabble start in Europe. "But
they weren't hard times. They were good times."</TE>
<TE>   His drive later led his personal coach, Rick Crawford, to dub him
"the bald bulldog from Butte."</TE>
<TE>   Leipheimer also competed for the U.S. national team and won a
silver medal in the time trial at the 1999 Pan American Games.</TE>
<TE>   Although he won the Route du Sud, a Tour tuneup race, last month,
Leipheimer comes into the Tour far more of a cipher to Dutch fans
than his teammates Michael Boogerd or sprinter Erik Dekker. "He
wouldn't be recognized on the street," said Renze Lolkema, a writer
for Algemeen Daglad, the Netherlands' second-largest newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   That will change quickly if Leipheimer rides well. The race is
televised live in the Netherlands and thousands of Dutch fans flock
to France to line the roadways every year. Rabobank's best previous
Tour showing is a fifth place by Boogerd in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just so proud of Levi," said Rob Leipheimer, Levi's brother.
"He had bigger goals than hauling water or riding tempo for Lance.
This is something we dreamed of as kids."</TE>

<HD>Hewitt Calls All the Shots, Dominates Men's Final</HD>
<DH>Wimbledon: Punctuating many strokes with a yell, he beats
Nalbandian, 6-1, 6-3, 6-2, in most lopsided title match since 1984.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>The tennis wheel of fortune kept spinning and landed on a different
name, and a new winner emerged at every Grand Slam event, starting at
Wimbledon 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Eight events yielded eight winners. What ever happened to plain
old domination?</LD>
<LD>   The answer came through loudly Sunday at Wimbledon. If you
couldn't see Australian Lleyton Hewitt's full-scale baseline assault
on newcomer David Nalbandian of Argentina in the final, well, it
probably could be heard outside the grounds. Even when Hewitt was far
ahead in a 6-1, 6-3, 6-2 victory, he punctuated punishing shots by
yelling, "Come on!"</LD>
<TE>   The top-seeded Hewitt recorded his second Grand Slam title, a
bookend for his U.S. Open championship in September. It was the most
one-sided victory in the final since 1984, when John McEnroe defeated
Jimmy Connors, 6-1, 6-1, 6-2. It was the first singles title for an
Australian since Pat Cash won in 1987 and climbed into the stands.
Hewitt watched Cash's victory as a 6-year-old at his grandparents'
house.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt, 21, repeated Cash's gesture and his journey into the
Friends' Box was about as effortless as his 1-hour 57-minute victory
against the 20-year-old Nalbandian, who was making his first
appearance on Centre Court in his Wimbledon debut.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea what I was going to do if I won," Hewitt said. "I
sort of went back to my chair. Then I thought, 'Stuff it, I'll go and
do it.' It's been 15 years since an Aussie won. I spoke to Pat [Cash]
before and after the match. He was one of my favorite players when I
was growing up, the headband and everything, the way he showed the
fire out there."</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Rafter, who lost in the final the last two years, called
Hewitt to wish him luck and "to do it for Australia." Cash was there
in person, doing TV commentary.</TE>
<TE>   "It was faultless," Cash said. "He [Nalbandian] just didn't have
anything left in the tank and Lleyton was his usual ruthless self.
There was nothing that was going to get in his way."</TE>
<TE>   It was the Argentine's first grass-court tournament as a
professional, and his jitters and Hewitt's baseline consistency
combined to produce a lackluster final.</TE>
<TE>   It said something that a streaker dashing across Centre Court
early in the second set and evading officials for several minutes,
even hopping the net, was the most dramatic action. The crowd laughed
but the security breach was yet another in a series of lapses at the
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Nalbandian was irritated, calling it "terrible," that security
took so long to get the intruder off the court. Hewitt's agent, Tom
Ross, was displeased, saying: "It's disgraceful that it happened."</TE>
<TE>   Whether it was a streaker or two rain delays, little seemed to
bother Hewitt. He had a special sense about this Wimbledon several
months ago. "I just had a feeling," he said. "There's something about
it. I couldn't have said that I was going to do this well. I could
have bombed out in the first round. There was something that was
drawing me."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the many upsets in the tournament, Hewitt had to beat
only one top-10 player, Tim Henman, which was in the semifinals. Now
comes another question: How many Grand Slam titles can Hewitt win?</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough," said Australian Todd Woodbridge, who won the doubles
with Jonas Bjorkman. "Ever since I've known Lleyton, he's gone better
than I ever thought he could do.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's a four-to-six-Slam winner. It's just a matter of
keeping fit, the drive and motivation he has. He's just a freak
really in a way. People like Lleyton come along every 15, 20 years."</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt's coach, Jason Stoltenberg, talked about his emergence
after the lack of domination.</TE>
<TE>   "For him to win a second Slam ... he's won two of the last four
Slams and that's something else, especially in today's game,"
Stoltenberg said. "And the way this tournament was heading, you were
starting to wonder whether we were going to have another one. We put
that to an end. It was his day, his tournament."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>NATIONAL LEAGUE</LD>
<LD>   Some big surprises and accomplishments of first half:</LD>
<LD>   * Montreal Expos: Weren't they supposed to be contracted out of
existence? Instead, they are in second place in the NL East and
making a run at a wild-card spot.</LD>
<TE>   * Shawn Green, Dodgers: Not only did he hit four homers in one
game, he has carried the Dodger offense and is a solid MVP candidate.</TE>
<TE>   * Lance Berkman, Houston: Who would have guessed Berkman would
have the most homers in a league with Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa? And
he also leads in RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   * Luis Castillo, Florida: His 35-game hitting streak set record
for longest streak by a second baseman in baseball history.</TE>
<TE>   * Barry Bonds, San Francisco: It doesn't look as if he will hit 73
homers again, but he might be having a better season this year. He
has an amazing on-base percentage of .556.</TE>
<TE>   * Eric Gagne, Dodgers: Who better to close out the list than him?</TE>
<TE>   Biggest disappointments and busts of the first half:</TE>
<TE>   * San Diego Padres: Some thought they would challenge for the
division title. Instead, they have the second-worst record in the
league.</TE>
<TE>   * Roberto Alomar and Mo Vaughn, Mets: Supposed to carry the Mets
to the top. The Mets are still waiting.</TE>
<TE>   * Ken Griffey Jr., Cincinnati: Has anyone's star fallen as fast as
his?</TE>
<TE>   * Sean Burroughs, San Diego: The Padres handed him the third base
job, and he hit .221 with no power. A Little Leaguer could have done
as well.</TE>
<TE>   AMERICAN LEAGUE</TE>
<TE>   Some big surprises and accomplishments of first half:</TE>
<TE>   * Paul Konerko, Chicago White Sox: Third in batting average, tied
for fourth in homers, tied for first in RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   * Alfonso Soriano, New York Yankees: MVP candidate has shown power
(20 homers) to go with his speed (23 steals).</TE>
<TE>   * Derek Lowe, Boston: Booed off the field in Fenway last season,
he has a no-hitter and a All-Star berth this season.</TE>
<TE>   * Jarrod Washburn, Angels: They say Ramon Oritz is the ace, but
Washburn leads staff with 9-2 record and 3.21 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   * Johnny Damon, Boston: Another reason for the Red Sox's
resurgence, he has bounced back from a poor season to hit better than
.300 with more walks than strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   * Mike Cameron, Seattle: Hit four homers in one game, but that is
about the only good game he has had.</TE>
<TE>   Biggest disappointments and busts of the first half:</TE>
<TE>   * Cleveland Indians: Started out 11-1, then faded fast and traded
star pitcher Bartolo Colon while telling fans they won't compete
until 2004. Good luck with those season-ticket sales for next year.</TE>
<TE>   * John Rocker, Texas: For some reason, it seems appropriate that
his ERA at the break is 6.66.</TE>
<TE>   * Frank Thomas, Chicago: Hitting below .240, he shows up late
after being benched for two games. Big Hurt become the Big Sulk.</TE>
<TE>   * John Burkett, Boston: Announces in June that he won't go to the
All-Star game if he's picked to prove a point to Bud Selig. Wow, an
All-Star game without John Burkett? That's like a James Bond reunion
without George Lazenby.</TE>

<HD>For Inkster, It's a Very Special Victory</HD>
<DH>Golf: She shoots a 66 to beat Sorenstam by two strokes and
win the U.S. Women's Open.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HUTCHINSON, Kan.</DL>
<LD>Juli Inkster whipped the Kansas crowd into a frenzy at every turn
Sunday in the U.S. Women's Open, the cheers becoming more deafening
with every crucial putt she made.</LD>
<LD>   When the greatest round in her Hall of Fame career was over and
her second Open title was all but assured, she jogged up the hill
next to the 18th green, slapping hands with a gallery that was
crowding around her.</LD>
<LD>   Some of them were at Prairie Dunes when Inkster, then a
20-year-old newlywed, won the first of her three consecutive U.S.
Women's Amateur titles.</LD>
<TE>   Twenty-two years and two daughters later, she is just as tough,
just as tenacious and still packs a short game that ranks among the
best.</TE>
<TE>   "This one was a lot tougher, but a lot more satisfying," Inkster
said after closing with a four-under 66 for a two-stroke victory over
Annika Sorenstam.</TE>
<TE>   "The crowd was phenomenal, and I fed off that," she said. "To beat
the best player in the world, you don't get an opportunity to do that
often.</TE>
<TE>   "This is pretty sweet."</TE>
<TE>   Facing a two-stroke deficit against the most dominant player in
the game, Inkster won the U.S. Women's Open by matching the best
closing round by a champion in the 57-year history of the
championship.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as the pressure and the conditions and what was at stake,
I'd say it's probably No. 1," she said of her final round. "It is
right now."</TE>
<TE>   Even more impressive is that Inkster had been struggling with her
swing all week, keeping alive her chances with grit and
determination, not to mention a putter that she needed only 25 times
each of the last two rounds.</TE>
<TE>   "When Juli birdied the second hole, the look on her face ... I
just knew Annika was going to have to shoot under par to win,"
playing partner Shani Waugh said.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam, a winner in six of her first 12 events, finished with
an even-par 70 and shot par or better all four rounds. It wasn't
enough.</TE>
<TE>   "I did everything I could," Sorenstam said. "I think I played
great golf. Juli played excellent. She really outplayed me. There was
nothing I could do. I gave it all, and I'm happy about that."</TE>
<TE>   Inkster finished at 276 and earned $535,000, the largest payoff in
women's golf. She has won seven majors, the most among active
players.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam had a two-under 278, a score that figured to win. Her
chances slipped away, though, when Inkster made a 15-foot par putt,
then made a 12-footer for birdie on the 16th.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam followed with two consecutive bogeys and her fading
hopes ended when she drove into the rough on No. 18.</TE>
<TE>   Inkster became the second-oldest player to win a major--Babe
Zaharias was 43 when she won the Women's Open in 1954.</TE>

<HD>Weaver Struggles but Wins</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Playing in unfamiliar situations, Jeff Weaver and Derek Jeter had
good days.</LD>
<LD>   Jeter hit a two-run homer in the sixth inning to make sure Weaver
won his debut with the New York Yankees as they rallied for a 10-6
victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Weaver (7-8) gave up two three-run homers in his first start after
being obtained by the Yankees from the Detroit Tigers in a three-way
trade involving the Oakland Athletics early Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   "I wanted to show them that I don't give up two three-run homers
very often," Weaver said.</TE>
<TE>   Jeter, who sat out two games with a sprained left knee, started as
the designated hitter for the first time in his career and led the
comeback with three runs batted in, including a two-run homer against
Corey Thurman (1-2) that put the Yankees ahead, 7-6.</TE>
<TE>   Nervous in front of the Yankee Stadium crowd of 57,478, Weaver
fell behind, 3-0, giving up a double to Vernon Wells on his first
pitch and a three-run homer to Carlos Delgado one out after an
infield single by Shannon Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the last thing you want to have happen, especially in the
first inning," Weaver said.</TE>
<TE>   Wells' three-run shot in the fifth ended a 3-3 tie before the
Yankees scored twice in the bottom half and then took the lead on
Jeter's homer.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver gave up six runs and six hits in seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to make sure that you're cool, calm and collected when
you go out there, but the crowd kind of takes that away from you,"
Weaver said. "Once I get my feet on the ground, it's going to be a
lot of fun."</TE>

<HD>John F. Burby, 77; Journalist Wrote L.A. Times Editorials</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John F. "Jack" Burby, deputy editorial page editor of the Los Angeles
Times through much of the 1980s and a gifted editorial writer, died
Saturday at his home in Avila Beach near San Luis Obispo. He was 77,
and the cause of death was lung and brain cancer.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Benton Harbor, Mich., Burby served in the Army Air
Corps as a pilot during World War II, ferrying planes throughout the
South Pacific.</LD>
<LD>   After his discharge in 1947, Burby took a reporting job with
United Press in Hawaii and attended the University of Hawaii. He left
the wire service in 1951 and joined the Honolulu Advertiser, working
there until he came to the mainland in 1956 for a job at the San
Francisco Chronicle.</LD>
<TE>   After completing a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard in 1959-60, he
worked as press secretary to California Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown.
He stayed with Brown through much of the 1960s before working briefly
in Washington as special assistant to Alan Boyd, the U.S. secretary
of transportation.</TE>
<TE>   He stayed in the East for much of the next decade, first as an
editor at the National Journal and then as president of Potomac
Policy Inc., a federal policy consulting firm that focused on energy
and environmental issues.</TE>
<TE>   He joined The Times as an editorial writer in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Day, who edited the Times' editorial page for 18 years and
is now retired, recalled Burby on Saturday as "a very jaunty guy,
both as a person and a thinker."</TE>
<TE>   Burby "was an unusual newspaperman, in that he had the mind of an
engineer," Day said. "He loved technology, and that love of
technology helped him on missile defense issues, including Star
Wars."</TE>
<TE>   Burby served as deputy editor of the editorial pages until 1989
when he returned to editorial writing full time. He left the paper in
the early 1990s and worked briefly for the New York Times, also
writing editorials, before retiring.</TE>
<TE>   "He was writing editorials at a time when government was
unfashionable," Day said. "Jack always believed very strongly in the
wise use of government, by which the people did things for themselves
together that they could not do individually."</TE>
<TE>   Burby's wife, Lois Luke, died in 1994. He is survived by his
longtime companion, Joyce Palaia; children, Karen Norman, Meg Burby,
David Burby and Timothy Burby; and three grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be announced at a later date.</TE>
<TE>   Contributions in his name may be sent to any of these
organizations: the redwood conservation group Semper Virens, Drawer
BE, Los Altos, CA 94023; the Hospice Partners of the Central Coast,
27 South St., Suite R, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401; and Friends of the
River, 915 20th St., Sacramento, CA 95814.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Henry "Buddy" Cianfrani, 79, a powerful and flamboyant former
Pennsylvania state senator imprisoned for corruption in the 1970s,
died Wednesday at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia. He
had suffered a stroke in May.</LD>
<LD>   In 1977, at the height of his power, Cianfrani was convicted of
racketeering and mail fraud for putting two ghost employees on the
Senate payroll. He served 27 months of a five-year federal prison
sentence.</LD>
<LD>   Cianfrani regained his ward seat in 1988 and had returned to power
by the early 1990s. He remained a Democratic ward leader until his
death, winning reelection three weeks ago.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Philadelphia, Cianfrani served in the Army during World
War II. He took over his father's seat in the state House of
Representatives in 1962. In 1966, he moved to the state Senate, where
he headed the Appropriations Committee.</TE>

<HD>Dhirajlal Ambani, 69; Founder of Business Empire in India</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dhirajlal Hirachand Ambani, 69, who went from gas station attendant
to billionaire founder of India's largest business empire, died
Saturday in a Bombay hospital after suffering his second stroke June
24. He had been partly paralyzed since his first stroke in 1986.</LD>
<LD>   Ambani, who established Reliance, a group with a market value of
$9 billion, was ranked 138th on the most recent Forbes magazine list
of the world's wealthiest people with a personal fortune of $2.9
billion.</LD>
<LD>   The son of a poor rural school teacher, Ambani began his career at
17 pumping gas in Yemen, then became a clerk for an affiliate of
Burmah Shell. He dreamed of owning his own oil company and succeeded
beyond his imagination, first founding Reliance Commercial Corp.,
trading spices and yarn, in 1958.</LD>
<TE>   Eight years later, he was manufacturing Vimal polyester fabric,
and then he added Reliance Petroleum, which now has the world's
fifth-largest refinery, to produce the petrochemical ingredients for
the fabric. The conglomerate has recently moved into biotechnology
and telecommunications as well.</TE>
<TE>   Ambani was credited with transforming business operations in India
when he raised money through the stock market, ending the near
monopoly on bank financing traditionally doled out to select elite
families. His strategy made millionaires out of thousands of
middle-class Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Despite criticism that he manipulated government policy to further
his business interests, Ambani was also lauded for teaching Indian
elitists that "to create wealth, one must first learn to share it."</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Glaus Is Still Mired in Slump at the Plate</HD>

<LD>The fate of the Angel offense may not rest on Troy Glaus' shoulders,
but he certainly could lend a helping hand, as he did the first two
months before his annual slump took hold.</LD>
<LD>   "Troy is just a piece to the puzzle, he's not the whole puzzle,"
Manager Mike Scioscia said.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, Glaus is a puzzle. He brutalized pitchers through May,
but since has taken more of a Gandhi-like stance at the plate.</LD>
<TE>   Glaus was hitting .286 when June began but his average has dropped
to .242.</TE>
<TE>   "Troy is a player who has very high peaks and down spells a little
deeper than others," Scioscia said. "You have to evaluate an entire
season. You have to look at the number of runs he scored and the
number of runs he drives in. He is on pace to score 100 runs and
drive in 110 or so."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the majority of that work was pre-June. He has 11 runs and 11
runs batted in in 34 games since May. He has only four home runs in
that time.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus' "bump in the road" has been a yearly occurrence.</TE>
<TE>   Lifetime, he has hit .223 in June, .220 in July and .246 in
August. Glaus has 15 home runs and 58 RBIs this season.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus had a single in four at-bats Sunday, but struck out with a
runner on first and no out in the ninth inning.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Major League Baseball Players' Assn. is contemplating setting
a strike date but Scioscia, who went through two as a player, seems
somewhat hopeful.</TE>
<TE>   "These things tend to get worked out at the 11th hour," Scioscia
said. "If it doesn't, baseball will crash and burn for a while. But
they haven't pulled the plug on things just yet."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia tinkered with his starting rotation for the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Jarrod Washburn will start Thursday in Kansas City, followed by
Kevin Appier, Aaron Sele and Ramon Ortiz.</TE>
<TE>   John Lackey is scheduled to open the Minnesota series next Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest issue was we wanted to see if there were any matchups
with clubs and pitchers we could take advantage of," Scioscia said.
"That didn't materialize. We also wanted to see if everyone came out
of their last starts OK, just in case someone needed an extra day to
get ready."</TE>
<TE>   Angel starters have been solid, going at least six innings in 61
of the team's 86 games.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Fades Out at San Jose</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Donovan's goal gives first-place Earthquakes a 1-0
victory in physical game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forward Landon Donovan promised a surprise in the return match of the
midseason home-and-home series between his San Jose Earthquakes and
the Galaxy.</LD>
<LD>   He should have guaranteed a goal.</LD>
<LD>   Donovan's third score this season gave the Western
Conference-leading Earthquakes a 1-0 victory Sunday night at intimate
Spartan Stadium, avenging the Galaxy's 2-1 victory Thursday night at
the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   The Earthquakes improved to an MLS-best 10-5-2 and, dating to last
season, won a Major League Soccer-record 10th consecutive match at
home.</TE>
<TE>   The previous record of nine in a row was shared by the Galaxy, the
Colorado Rapids, the Columbus Crew and the defunct Miami Fusion.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy, held scoreless on the road for the second consecutive
game, fell to 7-7-2 and remained in fourth place in the West with 23
points, which would tie the New York/New Jersey MetroStars for first
place in the East.</TE>
<TE>   In a physical match--38 fouls were called and five yellow cards
were issued--the Galaxy had trouble maintaining possession or the
momentum it gained Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed with the result, that's for sure," Coach Sigi
Schmid said. "Obviously in this league, some players get protection
and some don't. And right now it seems like we don't have a player
who's going to get protection."</TE>
<TE>   In front of 12,528, the Earthquakes got the game-winner in the
35th minute.</TE>
<TE>   With midfielder Ramiro Corrales approaching the goal from the left
flank, Donovan created space between himself and defender Adam Frye
in the middle of the field.</TE>
<TE>   Corrales sent a perfectly timed cross near the top of the
goalkeeper's box and Donovan drilled a right-footed shot past Kevin
Hartman for the goal.</TE>
<TE>   Frye looked to referee Terry Vaughn for an offside call, but
replays showed Donovan stayed back just long enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Adam said he got pushed by Landon," Schmid said. "For sure,
Landon looked like he was going to go inside then curled his run to
the back post behind him. Whether he was offside or not, I can't tell
from where I was sitting. But certainly he finished the goal well and
he escaped from [Frye]."</TE>
<TE>   Schmid also said that forward Cobi Jones, who took a hard shot to
the head early in the match but stayed in, probably had a mild
concussion and would be examined today.</TE>
<TE>   Hartman had six saves, but San Jose's Joe Cannon had three for his
league-leading sixth shutout.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In another MLS game:</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 2, Colorado 1--David Vaudreuil scored five minutes into
overtime at Naperville, Ill., to help the Fire end a four-game losing
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Dema Kovalenko centered a pass inside the six-yard box to
Vaudreuil, who redirected it with his trailing left foot past David
Kramer.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second overtime victory ever for the Fire (6-7-2).</TE>
<TE>   Midfielder Chris Henderson gave Colorado (8-8-1) a 1-0 lead in the
12th minute, firing a 17-yard shot inside the left post.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Wolff headed his own rebound to tie the score in the 63rd
minute. Kelly Gray lofted a 25-yard pass to Wolff, whose first shot
bounced off the left post.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a Women's United Soccer Assn. game:</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 3, New York 1--Marinette Pichon scored three goals in
the second half to lead the Charge at Villanova, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   Pichon leads the WUSA with 12 goals and 25 points.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia (9-1-3) extended its unbeaten streak to eight games
and moved into a first-place tie with Carolina. Both teams have 30
points, but the Charge has played one fewer game.</TE>
<TE>   Krista Davey scored for New York (2-11-1), which lost its seventh
in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Pichon ended a scoreless tie in the 77th minute and scored two
minutes later. She scored during injury time when she redirected a
cross from Zhao Lihong.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia has given up a league-best 11 goals and New York a
league-worst 41 goals.</TE>

<HD>Gold Cup Increases in Value by Adding Dollar Bill</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Even with 4-year-old colt, $750,000 race may
have only five-horse field.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sagging Hollywood Gold Cup, faced with a small field despite a
$750,000 purse, picked up an intriguing shipper Sunday when trainer
Dallas Stewart said he would be bringing Dollar Bill from Churchill
Downs for next Sunday's race.</LD>
<LD>   Even with Dollar Bill, the 63rd Gold Cup may have only five
starters. Others expected to run are Milwaukee Brew, Momentum, Out Of
Mind and Macaneo. Milwaukee Brew, winner of the Santa Anita Handicap
and the Californian at Hollywood in his last two starts, will be
favored.</LD>
<LD>   Last year there was a five-horse field for the Gold Cup, two years
after Real Quiet's 1999 win over only three rivals, which was the
smallest field in race history.</LD>
<TE>   Stewart decided to run in the Gold Cup after Dollar Bill's :48 2/5
half-mile workout Sunday at Churchill. The 4-year-old colt will be
flown to California today. Mark Guidry, who has ridden Dollar Bill in
his last two races, retains the mount and will ride in his first Gold
Cup.</TE>
<TE>   In his last start, at Churchill on June 15, Dollar Bill finished
second in the Stephen Foster Handicap but was 6 1/2 lengths behind
Street Cry, who might be the best horse currently in training.</TE>
<TE>   Dollar Bill won an allowance race at the Fair Grounds in New
Orleans to start the year, but he has won only one of his last 10
starts and hasn't won a stake since his victory in the Risen Star at
the Fair Grounds in February of last year. That win established
Dollar Bill as one of the top Kentucky Derby contenders, but he then
had a series of hard-luck trips, which contributed to a 15th-place
finish in the Derby and a fourth-place run in the Preakness.</TE>
<TE>   After Dollar Bill ran fourth in the Belmont, jockey Pat Day
concluded that he might be a bad match for the colt and Stewart
switched to other riders. Dollar Bill's last start of 2001 was a
third-place finish behind Point Given and E Dubai in the Travers.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Dollar Bill has four wins, four seconds and three thirds
in 16 starts, with purses of $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   "I think sooner or later he's going to get one of these big ones,"
said Stewart. "I hope it's going to be sooner. You've got to keep
trying."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Riding for the Stute brothers has paid off for jockey Matt Garcia
at the current Hollywood meet. For Mel Stute, he won the Landaluce
Stakes with Buffythecenterfold on Thursday and Sunday he won his
second stake of the season for Warren Stute when favored Go Go was a
neck better than Dyna's Club in the $91,925 Great Lady M. Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia got the mount on Go Go because Eddie Delahoussaye has been
sidelined for a week because of a virus that has caused facial
swelling. Delahoussaye is expected to return for Wednesday's card.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Black Ruby, the 10-year-old mule, won for the 21st time in her
last 22 starts when she beat a familiar rival, Taz, by a nose at
Pleasanton. Black Ruby's 57th win in 75 starts was worth $5,585 and
unofficially boosted her purses to almost $180,000, which is a record
for mules. Black Ruby's only loss during the hot spell came when Taz
beat her by a neck at Santa Rosa last August. With no place or show
betting Sunday, Black Ruby paid $2.40.... Sunday's stakes winners
included Lone Star Sky, who was 3 1/2 lengths better than odds-on
favorite Posse in the $136,250 Bashford Manor at Churchill Downs;
Gygistar in the $150,000 Dwyer at Belmont Park; Clearly A Queen in
the $100,000 Matchmaker at Mounmouth Park; and Hoovergetthekeys in
the $50,000 Alamedan Handicap at Pleasanton.</TE>

<KH>Ross Newhan ON BASEBALL</KH>
<HD>First-Half Awards Are Definitely Shaded Blue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first-half awards, or does anyone really expect sanity to save
the second half?</LD>
<LD>   MOST VALUABLE PLAYER</LD>
<LD>   National League--1. Eric Gagne, Dodgers; 2. Barry Bonds, San
Francisco; 3. Shawn Green, Dodgers.</LD>
<TE>   American League--1. Ichiro Suzuki, Seattle; 2. Alfonso Soriano,
New York; 3. Torii Hunter, Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Comment: It could just as easily be Green over Gagne, or 1-2 in
either order. Then again, if both are so deserving, if both have
contributed equally to the Dodgers' surprising emergence in the NL
West lead, it can be argued that maybe Bonds or Vladimir Guerrero or
Sammy Sosa or Lance Berkman, who is on pace to hit 55 home runs and
drive in 154 runs, has been more valuable to his team.</TE>
<TE>   At the break, however, the opinion here is that no one has had a
more dramatic impact on a playoff-caliber team than Gagne, who came
out of blue heaven to turn the Dodgers into a contender and a team
that could win the close games long before Green joined the party in
late May.</TE>
<TE>   MVP contention in the AL also runs deep, but Suzuki again has the
Mariners on a pace for more than 100 wins, even though the hitters
behind him aren't doing what they did last year, when the Mariners
won 116.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano is on pace for 40 homers and 40 steals, and although he is
far from the only valuable player in the Yankee lineup, there was a
temptation to select the 24-year-old Dominican second baseman ahead
of Suzuki strictly because he conducts every interview in English,
which is something neither Suzuki, with all of his exposure, nor most
of his countrymen, including the experienced Hideo Nomo, have tried.</TE>
<TE>   CY YOUNG AWARD</TE>
<TE>   National--1. Gagne; 2. Tom Glavine, Atlanta; 3. Randy Johnson,
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   American--1. Derek Lowe, Boston; 2. Pedro Martinez, Boston; 3.
Freddy Garcia, Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Comment: The opinion here is that it's possible for a pitcher,
particularly a relief pitcher, to be recognized as the most valuable
player in the league while not necessarily being the league's best
overall pitcher statistically, which is basically what the Cy Young
represents.</TE>
<TE>   However, taking into consideration Gagne's value to the Dodgers,
his statistical and artistic dominance out of the bullpen and the
fact he is on pace to break Bobby Thigpen's single-season save record
of 57, we'll double up on his awards, giving him a slight nod over
the resolute Glavine and his glossy 11-4 record and 2.27 earned-run
average.</TE>
<TE>   In the AL, Lowe has come out of the Red Sox bullpen to shake off
the boos of last year and compile a 12-4 record that could be even
better with more support. He also has the league's best ERA, 2.36,
among starters while holding opposing hitters to a .199 batting
average.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander probably will start Tuesday's All-Star game for
the AL, although the Red Sox would rather see him join Martinez on a
three-day vacation. Lowe hasn't pitched more than 123 innings in a
big league season and is already up to 118.</TE>
<TE>   ROOKIE OF THE YEAR</TE>
<TE>   National--Kazuhisa Ishii, Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   American--Eric Hinske, Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Comment: I have trouble giving another Japanese player a rookie
award considering their wealth of experience at the highest level of
baseball in their own country.</TE>
<TE>   However, the precedent was established with Nomo and Suzuki, and
they are rookies in the U.S., adjusting to a new culture and game.
Ishii, who carries the added pressure of the Dodgers' significant
investment, hasn't been as good lately as he was earlier, but he is
still 11-5 with a 3.58 ERA, one of the NL's several impressive rookie
pitchers, including Jason Simontacchi, Jason Jennings, Damian Moss
and Josh Fogg.</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Hinske, who went to the Blue Jays in the trade that
sent closer Billy Koch to Oakland, has 14 homers and 46 RBIs, the
best of a comparatively thin AL rookie crop.</TE>
<TE>   MANAGER OF THE YEAR</TE>
<TE>   National--tie between Frank Robinson, Montreal, and Jim Tracy,
Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   American--Grady Little, Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Comment: Thirteen years after he won this award at the helm of the
Baltimore Orioles, Frank Robinson is a candidate again at 66, helping
bring playoff possibilities to Montreal's uncertain future. Tracy, of
course, has the Dodgers in first place despite a myriad of spring
questions, and he has to receive considerable credit for that and the
improved chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Little has helped rid the Boston clubhouse of 2001's
toxic fumes and is proving that the several clubs that passed on him
over the years, either seeking a higher profile or a manager with big
league experience, made a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   In the context of a "name" manager, in other words, Little is big
enough.</TE>
<TE>   EXECUTIVE OF THE YEAR</TE>
<TE>   National--Dan Evans, Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   American--Brian Cashman, New York.</TE>
<TE>   Comment: Confounding the skeptics, Evans hit the first-half
jackpot. How sure he could have been about off-season acquisitions
such as Dave Roberts, Cesar Izturis, Omar Daal and Nomo filling the
critical roles they have, or Gagne emerging as a premier and pivotal
closer after he failed to trade for one, is an interesting question,
but the Dodgers are where they are because Evans did what he did.</TE>
<TE>   Cashman, of course, deals from strength--financial and
otherwise--but the Yankee general manager has proved adept at keeping
George Steinbrenner mollified and aggressively building on that
strength. Whether it's making in-season moves, such as last week's
acquisitions of Raul Mondesi and Jeff Weaver, or the quick,
off-season strikes that netted, among others, Jason Giambi, Robin
Ventura, Steve Karsay and Rondell White, Cashman/Steinbrenner seldom
sit long on their laurels--or payroll ledger.</TE>

<HD>Buchberger Signs With Coyotes</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings lost another veteran Sunday when unrestricted free agent
Kelly Buchberger, an alternate captain last season, signed a two-year
contract with the Phoenix Coyotes, including a club option for the
second season.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings had offered a one-year deal.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to the better deal, Buchberger jumped at the chance to
be reunited with Coyote managing partner Wayne Gretzky, a former
teammate on two Stanley Cup championship teams with the Edmonton
Oilers.</LD>
<TE>   "Knowing him as well as I do," Buchberger said from his summer
home in Edmonton, "I just wanted the opportunity again to be
associated with him."</TE>
<TE>   In the last month, the Kings traded forward Cliff Ronning, 36, to
the Minnesota Wild and exercised the buyout option on the contract of
forward Nelson Emerson, 34.</TE>
<TE>   They were outbid for free agents Philippe Boucher, 29, and
Buchberger, a 35-year-old right wing. Boucher, a defenseman, signed
last week with the Dallas Stars.</TE>
<TE>   Buchberger, a 16-year NHL veteran and member of three Stanley Cup
winners with the Oilers, played in 74 games last season. He had six
goals, seven assists and 75 penalty minutes.</TE>
<TE>   For his career, he has 101 goals, 192 assists and 2,079 penalty
minutes in 1,032 games with the Kings, Oilers and Atlanta Thrashers.</TE>
<TE>   "Kelly gives us a lot of experience and leadership," Coyote
General Manager Michael Barnett said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can never have enough Stanley Cup rings in your dressing
room, and Kelly will be a great example to our younger players."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Highly touted forwards Jared Aulin and Yanick Lehoux will be among
the nearly 40 prospects taking part in the Kings' two-week
development camp starting today at the team's HealthSouth training
facility in El Segundo.</TE>
<TE>   All scrimmages and on-ice workouts are open to the public at no
charge. Three scrimmages are scheduled: Saturday, July 17 and July
20.</TE>

<HD>Hiddink Returns Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Guus Hiddink, the charismatic Dutch coach who led South Korea to
fourth place in the World Cup and stirred the country in the process,
returned home to the Netherlands on Sunday to begin talks with PSV
Eindhoven.</LD>
<LD>   Hiddink was given an emotional send-off at Inchon International
Airport, where hundreds of South Korea's "Red Devil" fans turned out
and a school band played in his honor.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not goodbye, just so long," Hiddink said.</LD>
<TE>   Hiddink had been offered the chance to remain South Korea's coach,
but said he wanted to return to the daily challenge of club soccer.
He said he would maintain close ties with South Korea as an advisor
ahead of the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens and the 2006 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   If he agrees to coach PSV, his contract will allow him to spend
time working with Korea's national teams.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, speculation is rife in Seoul about which South Korean
players might join Hiddink at PSV.</TE>
<TE>   "I have not made a decision yet on which players I would like to
take with me to Europe," he told Agence France-Presse. "They could be
younger than those in the World Cup squad."</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo Says No</TE>
<TE>   Brazilian striker Ronaldo quashed speculation that he might be
moving from Inter Milan in Italy to Real Madrid in Spain, telling the
Spanish daily sports newspaper Marca that he is content where he is.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil teammate Roberto Carlos, who plays for Real Madrid, had
started the rumor of a possible move last week when he asked the
reigning European champion to try to acquire Ronaldo.</TE>
<TE>   "Real Madrid is a great team, one of the most important in the
world, but it has its players and I'm already part of a team at
Inter," Ronaldo said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he owed loyalty to Massimo Moratti, Inter Milan's
president.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was experiencing very difficult times, being injured on a
number of occasions, the president was always by my side and I can't
betray him," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rivaldo on Painkillers</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo's fellow World Cup winner, Rivaldo, said he wants to stay
at Barcelona in Spain until his contract expires in a year, denying
that a move to Lazio in Italy was likely.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know anything about that story of Lazio that has been
published in the newspapers," Rivaldo said.</TE>
<TE>   The playmaking midfielder also told Reuters that he had been given
an injection of painkillers at halftime of last Sunday's World Cup
final, in which Brazil defeated Germany, 2-0, in Yokohama, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "I made an ankle support with bandage to keep the ankle firmer,
but it wasn't enough on its own," he said. "I had an injection of
Voltaren with the consent of Jose Luiz Runco [Brazil's team doctor]
to get over the pain. It's a normal solution to reduce pain."</TE>
<TE>   Boniek to Lead Poland</TE>
<TE>   Poland has named one of its greatest former players, Zbigniew
Boniek, as coach of the national team, replacing Jerzy Engel, who was
fired after Poland's first-round elimination at the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Boniek scored 24 goals in 80 games for Poland, helping it achieve
third place at the 1982 World Cup in Spain. He also won the European
Champions Cup in 1985 while playing for Juventus.</TE>
<TE>   Wright to AEK</TE>
<TE>   Mauricio Wright, the Costa Rica national team player who formerly
played for the San Jose Earthquakes and New England Revolution of
Major League Soccer, has been signed to a three-year contract by AEK
Athens of the Greek first division. Wright scored a goal for Costa
Rica against China at the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Reggae Boyz Bankrupt</TE>
<TE>   The Jamaican Football Federation (JFF) has disbanded its national
team program, effective immediately, after running out of money.</TE>
<TE>   Players from the women's national team, which had been preparing
for its qualifying games for the 2003 Women's World Cup, and the
men's national team, which was readying for a trip to Europe, have
been sent home.</TE>
<TE>   Horace Burrell, the JFF president, told Agence France-Presse that
a cut of 65% in the Jamaican government's sports development subsidy
to the JFF was to blame for the financial crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Zambia Advances</TE>
<TE>   Striker Rotson Kilambe returned from a nine-month drug-related
suspension to score twice as Zambia defeated Mozambique, 3-0, in
front of 30,000 in Lusaka, Zambia, to advance to the semifinals of
the Cosafa Castle Cup regional tournament. Forward Chaswe Nsofwa
scored Zambia's other goal.</TE>

<HD>Serena Wins Mind Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>All it took was one look at Serena Williams last year, and you had to
wonder how someone so fit and so sculpted could be so amazingly
susceptible to any germ flying through the air or be so injury prone.</LD>
<LD>   She called herself a hypochondriac last year after losing to
Jennifer Capriati in the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, suffering from
an upset stomach and nausea. Capriati was quite critical, saying it
was always something with Williams.</LD>
<LD>   So often, Williams would start big matches quickly and fade. For
her, the finish line was like Kryptonite, her legs and arms turning
to jelly at the moment of reckoning.</LD>
<TE>   What turned her career around--in the most dramatic fashion--was
an injured ankle and another stomach virus.</TE>
<TE>   Williams missed the Australian Open in January because of an ankle
injury suffered in a tuneup tournament in Sydney and then got sick
before a tournament in Scottsdale, Ariz. Instead of pulling out of
Scottsdale, again, Williams showed up and won it, beating Capriati in
the final in three sets. And she simply got tired of missing Grand
Slam events because of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of crazy," she said. "When I won that tournament in
Scottsdale, that was a big up for my confidence. Normally when I go
into tournaments I expect to win, but that one I just didn't. And I
did. So that was nice, and I've been winning ever since."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, she has lost only two matches--on clay to Patty
Schnyder and Justine Henin--and is on a 19-match winning streak,
taking the Italian Open, French Open and, most impressively,
Wimbledon on Saturday. In four weeks, she defeated her older sister,
Venus, twice in Grand Slam finals, taking the French Open and
Wimbledon in straight sets.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, psychosomatic might have been a more accurate
description of her health problems of years past. Serena was open
about her previous shortcomings, saying: "I think a lot of my
injuries were mental injuries. I could have been winning. I had
chances here last year at Wimbledon, the French. I just changed. I
think I grew up a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   These reflections came in a small interview room at the All
England Club, hours after her 7-6 (4), 6-3 victory against Venus in
the Wimbledon final. Serena chatted with a handful of American
reporters who watched her win in Paris, and a couple of British
reporters, who filled her in on Wimbledon lore, on the days of the
Watson sisters in the 1880s.</TE>
<TE>   This was the first match of the nine between the Williams sisters
to hit a high level, in terms of shot-making and drama. Quite often,
they combine for more than 100 unforced errors in their contests, but
the number was greatly reduced on grass, to a combined 47.</TE>
<TE>   The sheer force of Serena's power seemed to devastate Venus, who
looked close to breaking into tears afterward in interviews. By
Sunday, her mother and coach, Oracene, said in interviews that Venus
had moved past this loss, much faster than from others, apparently.</TE>
<TE>   There is always going to be an element of conflicted emotions when
the sisters play one another, quite natural because of their
closeness in age--Venus is 22 and Serena 20. For them, there is no
way to be unconditionally happy when success comes at the expense of
a sibling.</TE>
<TE>   "She's always gone overboard with me," Serena said of Venus.
"She's always done everything, gone out of her way to make sure that
I was happy. There's many times she's done things for me that nobody
would have done.</TE>
<TE>   "She saw to it that I was safe even though she may not have been.
Even when I go places, she's always calling to check on me. She
actually worries about me like a parent. In that sense, yeah, it's
going to be difficult for me to accept that fact. But hopefully,
we'll share lots of Grand Slam titles between us."</TE>
<TE>   Another area of concern for the sisters this past fortnight was
Serena's alleged stalker. A German man has been detained twice in the
last three months by law enforcement authorities in Europe, most
recently at Wimbledon last week.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the casual interview setting Saturday night, Serena's
personal bodyguard stayed in the room with reporters and WTA public
relations officials.</TE>
<TE>   "We like to live our lives," Serena said. "I'm definitely worried
about people. [But] I'm not going to change who I am."</TE>
<TE>   The security concerns did not prevent her from stopping by the
Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum during a rain delay. She took a
particular interest in fashion, saying: "Everyone was so short! They
had these old white linen dresses. They were the length of the
ground."</TE>
<TE>   The woman who is raising the bar in this sport, setting a new
standard for power and precision, did not have any victory plans
other than the Wimbledon Champions dinner. This is despite winning
her third Grand Slam title, being one title (the Australian Open)
away from a career Slam and becoming the No. 1-ranked player in the
world today, replacing Venus.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand me," Serena said. "I think there's an old lady
living in this young body. I just want to go home and be with my dog.
That's enough for me: The smallest things in life."</TE>

<HD>Latino Group Bridges the Barriers of Autism</HD>
<DH>Support: After son's diagnosis, couple found little data in
Spanish. Now they share facts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. REZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A distraught Gloria Hernandez called her husband at work with the
wrenching news: Their 18-month-old son was autistic.</LD>
<LD>   Edson would never be "normal," she was told.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Luis Hernandez struggled to find a way to comfort his
frightened wife as she asked, "Do you know anything about autism?"</LD>
<TE>   They blush now when they recall Jose's reply in 1998: "I saw 'Rain
Man.' I know a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   His answer, though sincere, spoke volumes about how much they had
to learn about the complex neurological disorder afflicting their
youngest child.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure I wasn't the only Latino whose knowledge of autism came
from a Hollywood movie," Jose said. And, he thought, they could not
be the only Latino family with an autistic child.</TE>
<TE>   So they set out to learn as much as they could about autism, which
affects the part of the brain responsible for social interaction and
communication skills and typically is diagnosed in the first three
years of life.</TE>
<TE>   And now they are sharing their knowledge--through a Santa
Ana-based support group and 24-hour hotline, (714) 542-7032, they
founded--with a growing number of Latino parents looking for answers
about autism in their own language and within their own culture.</TE>
<TE>   The Hernandezes had seen autistic behavior in Edson, now 6, but
did not recognize it at the time. He had stopped communicating after
his first birthday and was engaging in strange behavior, such as
banging his head on the wall.</TE>
<TE>   Frightened by the doctors' diagnosis and filled with uncertainty
about Edson's future, they tried to glean information from local
sources, including the UCLA Medical Center and the Regional Center of
Orange County, which contracts with the state to help developmentally
disabled persons. The couple, Mexican immigrants who live in Anaheim,
also attended conferences.</TE>
<TE>   "We were desperate for information. But there was nothing
available in Spanish. UCLA gave us an outdated pamphlet in Spanish.
The conferences were in English," Jose said.</TE>
<TE>   "For Latinos who don't speak English, it's very frightening. Many
have never heard the word 'autism.' Imagine a doctor telling you your
child will never be normal," he said. "The only thing you understand
is that your child isn't normal, and you want answers. But the only
answers they give you are in English."</TE>
<TE>   The Hernandezes were forced to do their own research to learn
about the disorder that had stolen away their son.</TE>
<TE>   Gloria quit her job as a market cashier and left for Mexico City,
where she spent five weeks researching autism at the National
Autonomous University of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   It was up to Jose, a lead cook for the Claim Jumper restaurants,
to care for and support the family, which includes two older
children.</TE>
<TE>   While Gloria read and copied materials in Mexico City, Jose
purchased a computer and learned how to access Spanish-language
autism sites. Although proficient in English, like many nonnative
speakers they are more comfortable using their first language.</TE>
<TE>   In the months after Edson's diagnosis, the couple learned that
there were dozens of Latino parents just like them; fathers and
mothers who spoke little English, with children disabled by a
condition they knew nothing about and that experts do not fully
understand.</TE>
<TE>   They also discovered that support for Latino parents of autistic
children was hard to find. So the Hernandezes and four other couples
with autistic children formed a support group, the Santa Ana-based
Grupo de Autismo Angeles. It's a first-of-its-kind nonprofit in
Southern California that now includes 140 parents.</TE>
<TE>   The five families became the nucleus of Grupo Angeles, whose
members now come from Fontana, Pomona, Moreno Valley and Los Angeles
to attend monthly meetings in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   One of the founding couples bought a house to serve as a
headquarters. The center--funded from garage, tamale and Avon
sales--includes a computer lab with donated equipment and a library
for parents and children. Jose and Gloria are also counselors and
answer a 24-hour hotline.</TE>
<TE>   The Autism Society of America estimates that as many as 1.5
million people nationwide have the developmental disorder. According
to the state Department of Developmental Services, 17,614
Californians with autism receive some form of assistance. Of these,
2,085 come from households where Spanish is the primary language.</TE>
<TE>   Resource groups throughout the state offer some information about
autism in Spanish, Vietnamese and Cambodian. But Laura Ruesga,
program specialist at Fiesta Educativa in East Los Angeles, said that
Spanish-language information is "still very limited."</TE>
<TE>   "That's why Grupo Angeles is so awesome. Their program educates
and supports parents, all in Spanish. It's the only one of its kind,"
said Ruesga, whose office offers educational programs for
Spanish-speaking parents about their children's disabilities. The
Hernandezes' biggest frustrations have been with their own culture,
where autism is a stigma made worse by misunderstanding.</TE>
<TE>   An autistic child is often dismissed with a disdainful "Esta loco"
("He's crazy"), Gloria said.</TE>
<TE>   Mothers often get blamed. One misconception is that inattention by
the mother makes a child autistic. Another holds that autism resulted
from a scare the mother received while pregnant. And there is a
common belief among immigrants that American doctors do not know what
they are doing.</TE>
<TE>   "We had friends and relatives tell us over and over that the
doctors didn't know what they were talking about," said Jose. "People
would tell us to take Edson to doctors in Tijuana."</TE>
<TE>   Autistic Latino children face an additional handicap, because
parents frequently refuse to believe there is anything wrong with
them, Jose said. By the time parents accept that a child has a
neurological problem, he or she has lost valuable time in which to
learn social skills through specialized instruction.</TE>
<TE>   "Friends and relatives would tell us there was nothing wrong with
Edson. Everyone had a story about their Juanito not starting to talk
until he was 5, and he was perfectly normal now; that Edson was no
different," Jose said.</TE>
<TE>   "In our culture, a lot of people lose time in getting help for
their children because of the false expectation that they will get
better. We fell into that trap for a while."</TE>
<TE>   They also initially blamed each other for their son's condition,
Gloria said. Each accused the other's family of having a flawed gene
that caused the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "We are better informed now and can make more intelligent
decisions for Edson," she said. The Hernandezes' experiences are at
the heart of their work with Grupo Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Angie Carrillo, certified child life specialist at the UC Irvine
Medical Center and advocate for autistic schoolchildren, calls the
center "a historic first for Latino parents."</TE>
<TE>   "They are an amazing couple," she said. "They're just ordinary
people who stepped in and filled a big need."</TE>
<TE>   Parents find Grupo Angeles through referrals, word-of-mouth or the
Internet. The group's e-mail address is grupodeautismo
angeles@netzero.net. Jose Hernandez said they receive e-mail
inquiries from throughout Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   Claudia and Adolfo Garrido learned about Grupo Angeles through the
Internet from their home in Hermosillo, Mexico, where they had a
tortilla factory.</TE>
<TE>   At the Hernandezes' urging, the Garridos, former Santa Ana
residents and holders of U.S. residency visas, decided to return to
the United States about two years ago with their autistic son,
Daniel, now 4.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no school or assistance for him in Mexico that we could
afford. We looked at the Internet for help and found Grupo Angeles,"
said Claudia Garrido, whose family lives in Moreno Valley. "We sold
everything and moved back." She and her husband left a middle-class
lifestyle in Mexico for his $9 per hour electrician's job here. She
does not work outside the home.</TE>
<TE>   "We returned because my son can get an education here. Grupo
Angeles taught us about our rights, but it's a constant battle with
the school district and our regional center over the services
available to our son," Garrido said.</TE>
<TE>   Grupo Angeles and the Hernandezes perform perhaps their greatest
service in teaching parents how to assert their rights--especially
how to negotiate with school districts for a special curriculum for
their children.</TE>
<TE>   Rita Rubin, president of the Greater Long Beach-Whittier Chapter
of the Autism Society of America, knows the Hernandezes and works
closely with Fiesta Educativa on outreach programs to the Latino
community in Los Angeles County. She said Grupo Angeles plays a key
role in teaching Latino parents about their rights. "Typically, if
somebody in authority tells Latino parents they can't have a
particular service for their child, they accept it without question,"
said Rubin, who has a 24-year-old autistic daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The Hernandezes fought with Anaheim City School District officials
over an instructional program for Edson and won; the experience
enabled them to help other parents maneuver through the bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   They also insisted that their son be taught in a regular
classroom.</TE>
<TE>   "If he needs speech therapy, we want the district to give him
speech therapy. He's not sick. He's just different and expresses
himself differently," Jose Hernandez said. "This is where we're
changing the world, by teaching Latino parents to exert their lawful
rights for them and their children."</TE>

<HD>Farewell to LAX Victims Mixed With Grief, Rage</HD>
<DH>Services: One who died at ticket counter is buried, the
other is sent to Israel for burial as El Al resumes flights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH, LAURA LOH and GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They gathered to say goodbye: raging, sobbing, and vowing to go on.</LD>
<LD>   First, the mourners for two victims shot dead last week by an
Egyptian immigrant at the El Al Israel Airline ticket counter at LAX
said final farewells in the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Then, families and friends fought to keep their goodbyes casual as
their loved ones lined up for the airline's first scheduled flight to
Tel Aviv since the tragedy, a flight that would carry the body of one
of the victims home for burial.</LD>
<TE>   At an early morning service, Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn told
mourners that Yaakov Aminov, the 46-year-old Valley Village resident
gunned down as he dropped off a friend at LAX, had a "heart of
courage" and love.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately a heart full of hate, bent on terror, took that
heart of love from us," Hahn said to a crowd of more than 1,000
spilling out of Yad Avraham, the small Orthodox synagogue Aminov
helped found in North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's slightly hedged choice of words was interrupted: "Call it
terrorism!" one mourner yelled.</TE>
<TE>   Aminov's pregnant widow, Anat, and their five children listened as
eulogizers described Yaakov, also known as Jacob, as a gentle
selfless man devoted to the study of Jewish teachings.</TE>
<TE>   Aminov was dropping off a friend for the Tel Aviv flight when he
was shot, along with El Al ticket agent Victoria Hen, 25. Two others
were wounded by the gunman, Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, a 41-year-old
Egyptian immigrant who lived in Irvine. Hadayet was killed by a
security guard.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. authorities have hesitated to label the attack a terrorist
event, and on Sunday, conflicting reports emerged over whether
Hadayet had a financial dispute with the airline.</TE>
<TE>   "It was no coincidence that this occurred on the Fourth of July,
the very day when America reconfirms the ideals it holds so dear,"
Consul General Yuval Rotem told mourners.</TE>
<TE>   Hadayet's rampage was an "insane act by an insane concept called
martyrdom," said Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of the Simon Wiesenthal
Center.</TE>
<TE>   A short while later, the scene was repeated in Mission Hills,
where hundreds of people packed the chapel of Eden Memorial Park,
where Victoria Hen was buried in a simple wooden casket.</TE>
<TE>   "I have conducted many funerals, but the most difficult are the
ones where I eulogize children in front of parents," Rabbi Samuel
Ohana told a crowd that spilled onto the steps, and stood beneath a
blanching sun.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a victim of a brand of evil, an evil that believes any
Jew or any Israeli can be murdered," Ohana said.</TE>
<TE>   Mourners shook their heads in both disbelief and rage as they
filed to Hen's graveside, and some carried signs. One said Hen's
killing was a terrorist act.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Snali, who said Hen had come to his West Hills home to play
with his two young children, criticized the U.S. government for not
labeling the shooting a terrorist act.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want to admit that it can happen again in the United
States after Sept. 11," Snali said.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Hier, who spoke at both services, walked away from Hen's
grave with a simple admonishment:</TE>
<TE>   "An individual act of terror is still an act of terror," he said.</TE>
<TE>   By this time, Anat Aminov was en route to Tel Aviv on an El Al
flight that carried her husband's remains. The 36-year-old widow, who
is two months pregnant, had earlier arrived at the airport slumped in
a wheel-chair surrounded by a knot of family and friends, and wept
silently. She was to bury her husband today in his hometown of Kiryat
Ono, a suburb of Tel Aviv.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tragedy, a sad tragedy," said Mark Ezerzer, brother-in-law
of the victim. "We lost one of the best."</TE>
<TE>   With airport police officers keeping watch from a balcony, and
several others clustered nearby, passengers and family members were
anxious. Many held blue-and-white carnations, the colors of Israel's
flag, handed out by counter workers as a gesture of mourning for
Aminov and Hen, who was working the same ticket counter when mayhem
erupted 72 hours earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "After what happened, it's good security," Ezerzer said. "It can
happen anytime. I hope they can prevent it from happening again."</TE>
<TE>   There was little doubt among the passengers awaiting the flight
that Hadayet was motivated by terror when he began shooting at
passengers.</TE>
<TE>   "A man comes to the El Al counter with two guns and a knife and
begins shooting?" Ezerzer questioned. "I can't imagine any other
explanation."</TE>
<TE>   Many who checked in for the flight refused to talk about the
shooting. But those who did said they were adept at managing their
fear of terror and were confident in El Al, whose security is
renowned in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kind of used to this--what can you do?" said Omer Hauser, 22,
of Holon, Israel, who had been on vacation in Southern California.
"Here, it's a big-time event," he said. "This happens all the time in
Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Hauser looked askance at the additional security in the terminal,
including 10 officers and a dog. "It doesn't matter how many officers
they have here," he said. "I can't believe they know what to look
for."</TE>
<TE>   Yehuda Kohen, a 59-year-old businessman from Encino, waited to say
goodbye to his wife and son before boarding the flight.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the safest airline," Kohen said.</TE>
<TE>   Then he embraced his wife, who choked back tears, and hugged his
son, who put on a brave face. Casual parting words somehow resonated
longer as he faded into the crowd at the security gate.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll see you soon," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Have a safe flight," Shoshana Kohen replied.</TE>
<TE>   "Bye, Abba," said his son.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two bank accounts have been opened for contributions to assist
Aminov's family: one at Bank Leumi at 16530 Ventura Blvd., Encino, CA
91436; the other at National Bank of California, 14724 Ventura Blvd.,
Sherman Oaks, CA 91403. Contributions can also be sent to Yad Avraham
synagogue, 12426 Burbank Blvd., North Hollywood, CA 91607.</TE>
<TE>   Donations in memory of Victoria Hen can be made to the Vicky Hen
Memorial Fund, 23277 Ventura Blvd., Woodland Hills, CA 91364.</TE>

<HD>Court Reviewing Sentence of Death</HD>
<DH>Justice: Jury never heard what lawyer calls 'radioactive'
evidence in the defendant's favor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Superior Court jury had little trouble recommending that Los
Angeles street gang member Adam Miranda be put to death.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors viewed him on videotape killing an Eagle Rock store clerk
and wounding another employee in a 1980 robbery. They also heard him
testify that he shot the victims because they were rude.</LD>
<LD>   Later, during the trial's penalty phase, the prosecution's key
witness testified that he saw Miranda murder a Frog Town neighborhood
drug dealer by stabbing him in the face 11 times over a $10 dispute.
Jurors took 40 minutes to decide Miranda should die.</LD>
<TE>   Two decades later, the California Supreme Court is reconsidering
Miranda's death sentence based on defense allegations that Los
Angeles County prosecutors--including Lance Ito, who went on to fame
as the judge in the O.J. Simpson murder trial--engaged in misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   The high court recently directed a San Diego judge to sit as a
special master to determine whether the deputy district attorneys
failed to disclose crucial evidence that they had obtained well
before the 1982 trial. The evidence was an October 1980 handwritten
letter by a County Jail inmate saying penalty phase witness Joseph
Saucedo admitted to him from an adjoining cell that he--not
Miranda--stabbed the drug dealer.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Supreme Court rulings require prosecutors to disclose to
defense lawyers any material they have that would help discredit the
testimony of a witness or help prove innocence.</TE>
<TE>   While stopping short of saying the letter was deliberately
withheld, the special master, Roger W. Krauel, ruled in late May that
defense lawyers never received it from the prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   The high court justices now will use Krauel's finding to help
determine whether the death sentence for Miranda, now 42, should be
reversed.</TE>
<TE>   The letter would have been "positively radioactive" for Saucedo's
credibility while testifying before the jury, said George Hedges,
Miranda's current lawyer. He said it could have dissuaded the jury
from sentencing Miranda to die, because Saucedo was the only witness
to provide a compelling and complete firsthand account of the grisly
second murder.</TE>
<TE>   Ito, now a Superior Court judge, said ethics rules prohibit him
from commenting on pending cases. But in court papers he said he
clearly remembers the letter, and in testimony before Krauel he
agreed it should have been turned over to Miranda's lawyers. But he
could not recall whether he did. Ito said he had an open file policy
at the time that allowed defense lawyers to freely examine the
prosecution file.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the state attorney general, who are representing the
district attorney's office, minimize the importance of the letter.
They argue, among other things, that it is hearsay and does not prove
Saucedo actually admitted to the killing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Conflicting Statements</TE>
<TE>   Although the letter appears on its face to clear Miranda of the
drug dealer's killing, police also collected statements from
witnesses and informants that implicated Miranda or Saucedo or both
but were never introduced at trial.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, six months after he was sentenced to die for the
shooting of store clerk Gary Black, 33, Miranda struck an agreement
with prosecutors in which he pleaded guilty to second-degree murder
in the drug dealer's killing. His lawyer says he would have never
agreed to the deal if he had known about the letter.</TE>
<TE>   Miranda's case is now in its fifth post-trial review by state
appellate courts. It is also being reviewed in federal court.</TE>
<TE>   The California Supreme Court is being asked by Miranda's lawyers
to reverse the death penalty decision because without the letter,
they say, he did not receive a fair trial during the penalty phase.</TE>
<TE>   If the sentence is reversed and prosecutors decide to retry the
penalty phase, they might have an uphill battle. In 83% of such
cases, defendants are not resentenced to death, either because the
prosecution chooses not to seek it or the jury doesn't return a death
verdict.</TE>
<TE>   The case's twisted legal path began Sept. 27, 1980, when Black was
shot and killed. Miranda and a co-defendant were arrested soon after.
Miranda and Saucedo, who was not involved in the store clerk's
shooting, were also charged with the Sept. 13, 1980, stabbing death
of drug dealer Robert L. Hosey, 20.</TE>
<TE>   Ito was the initial prosecutor in both cases, which moved through
the court system separately.</TE>
<TE>   The crucial handwritten letter came to Ito's attention a few weeks
later when an LAPD detective received it from a jailer and identified
inmate Larry Montez as the author, according to the detective's court
declaration. He said he turned it over to Ito, who placed it in a
manila envelope and put it in the prosecution's case file.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, Montez said Saucedo told him that he had stabbed
Hosey, threw the knife into the Los Angeles River and had arranged
for his girlfriend to tell police he was with her at a movie.</TE>
<TE>   In February 1981, the Hosey charges against Miranda were dismissed
after a preliminary hearing for lack of evidence, leaving Saucedo the
lone defendant.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors, armed with the Montez letter, gathered statements
from additional inmates implicating Saucedo in Hosey's death. But Ito
still wanted to prosecute Miranda for Hosey's killing.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 8, 1981, he met with Saucedo. To get Saucedo to testify
against Miranda in the Hosey killing, Ito struck a deal allowing
Saucedo to plead guilty to assault with a deadly weapon in exchange
for probation, according to a transcript of that meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office then refiled charges against
Miranda in the Hosey killing. Meanwhile, the case against Miranda for
killing Black was continuing to move toward trial.</TE>
<TE>   Because of a conflict of interest, Ito withdrew from the case. A
second prosecutor, Frederick Horn, also withdrew, because of a death
in his family.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Curtis A. Hazell then successfully tried the
case. Miranda was convicted July 16, 1982, of shooting the store
clerk during an attempted robbery, which made him eligible for either
the death penalty or life in prison without parole.</TE>
<TE>   Miranda's accomplice, also convicted, was sentenced to life
without parole. But for Miranda, the district attorney's office
wanted the death penalty, and Saucedo and the Hosey killing would
help get it.</TE>
<TE>   Hazell used Saucedo's testimony to argue that Miranda deserved to
die because not only had he killed the store clerk, he had also
committed the second murder, the Hosey slaying, just two weeks
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Saucedo testified that he saw Hosey getting beaten up and that
Miranda, using Hosey's knife, stabbed him repeatedly. Saucedo said he
tried to stop Miranda but gave up when Miranda mistakenly stabbed him
in the hand.</TE>
<TE>   During cross-examination, Miranda's attorney tried to discredit
Saucedo by questioning his plea bargain and by asking other questions
that implied he may have killed Hosey, according to court papers. But
the defense did not substantially weaken Saucedo's story, the Supreme
Court said in a summary of the case.</TE>
<TE>   In his closing arguments, Hazell said that if there had been any
evidence that Saucedo had killed Hosey, defense lawyers would have
submitted it.</TE>
<TE>   Hazell was right, says Joe Ingber, Miranda's attorney at the time.
Unfortunately, the evidence was withheld from him by the district
attorney's office, Ingber says.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had been given the Montez letter, we sure as hell would
have made a frontal attack on [Saucedo]," Ingber said. "Armed with
this letter, we could have taken away the prosecution's only piece of
evidence in the penalty phase against Mr. Miranda: the murder of Mr.
Hosey."</TE>
<TE>   Ingber said the prosecution also withheld other information that
may have been useful against Saucedo, such as a $1,350 payment for
expenses, an agreement to relocate him, and several other statements
police had collected from witnesses implicating Saucedo in the
stabbing.</TE>
<TE>   As for Ito's open file policy allowing defense attorneys to
examine the prosecution's case file, Ingber said he had never heard
of such a policy, and Ito never notified him of it.</TE>
<TE>   Hazell said in an interview that he did not know about the Montez
letter at the time of the trial, and that he would have turned it
over if he had. Hazell said that when he was assigned to the case, he
assumed his two predecessors had provided Ingber with everything he
was entitled to.</TE>
<TE>   His predecessor Horn, now an Orange County Superior Court judge,
said he didn't remember the Montez letter either, according to court
papers filed by the attorney general's office.</TE>
<TE>   After the jury recommended that Miranda be executed, Saucedo was
put on probation, in keeping with his plea deal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Accepted Plea Bargain</TE>
<TE>   Six months later, largely because of the apparent effectiveness of
Saucedo's testimony against him in the death penalty phase of the
store clerk's murder trial, Miranda accepted the advice of his lawyer
to plead guilty to second-degree murder in the Hosey killing,
according to court papers filed by the defense.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time it was a very favorable plea," the lawyer, Albert
Garber, said in an interview. "There was no point in going to trial
on it and risk getting him a second death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "A significant factor in my decision to advise Mr. Miranda to
plead guilty was the testimony produced during the penalty phase of
the [store-clerk murder] trial," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Garber said he would never have given that advice had he known
about the Montez letter. Miranda is now also using the Montez letter
and other arguments in another appeal seeking permission to withdraw
the Hosey plea.</TE>
<TE>   Garber and Ingber say they didn't learn about the Montez letter
until six years ago, when Miranda's appellate lawyers discovered it
when a federal court ordered prosecutors to hand over their file.</TE>
<TE>   With the special master's ruling on the Montez letter before the
California Supreme Court, Deputy Atty. Gen. David Glassman, who
represents the district attorney's office, said he is ready to defend
the jury's death verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "We are now preparing to address remaining issues," he said. Those
issues include whether the letter would have been admissible in court
and whether it would have changed the jury's penalty decision,
Glassman said.</TE>
<TE>   He said many questions about the letter have to be resolved,
including whether Montez really wrote it and whether it is truthful.</TE>

<HD>Oracle Debacle Provides a Glimpse</HD>
<DH>Government: Hearings offer some insight into Davis'
administration. But questions remain about the $95-million computer
software deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>As a career public official, Gov. Gray Davis plays up his knowledge
of the mechanics of government, laying claim as a candidate four
years ago to being the best-trained governor-in-waiting California
had ever produced and ending his campaign ads with the line,
"Experience money can't buy."</LD>
<LD>   But as California's latest computer debacle shows, Davis proved to
be no better than his predecessors at high-tech procurement.</LD>
<LD>   Though there is no evidence that Davis personally orchestrated the
$95-million computer software deal with Oracle Corp., recently
completed legislative oversight hearings provided unusual insight
into his administration, portraying some top advisors as disengaged
while others feuded. They all overlooked warnings from career civil
servants--and none was willing to stand up and block a project that
had not been vetted.</LD>
<TE>   Although previous administrations fumbled computer projects, Davis
and his aides added their own twists. Chief among them, Davis took a
$25,000 campaign donation from Oracle in June 2001, a few days after
the administration agreed to buy Oracle software without seeking bids
from other firms. He returned the money once the deal ran aground,
but not before fueling the perception that he trades policy for
campaign money.</TE>
<TE>   In the face of a critical state audit, and after more than 100
hours of oversight hearings, Davis is working to rescind the deal
with Oracle and its partner, Northrop Grumman subsidiary Logicon.
Still, fallout continues. Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer is investigating
circumstances surrounding the deal. Last week, Speaker Herb Wesson
(D-Culver City) dumped the Democratic assemblyman who chaired the
oversight hearing and was especially critical of Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Information Technology, established in the 1990s
to avoid such costly mistakes, was disbanded, and J. Clark Kelso, the
McGeorge law school professor tapped by Davis to recommend
improvements, last week suggested establishing a board, rather than a
single czar, to set information technology policy. A board, said
Kelso, would open the process to the public. That "sunshine" would
help cleanse the procurement process and ensure open bidding by
vendors, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to tighten the ethical standards," Kelso said.</TE>
<TE>   The Oracle deal gained wide attention when the Bureau of State
Audits issued a report in April. In unusually direct language, the
audit found little demand within the state's 127 departments for the
products offered under the $95-million, six-year contract, called an
Enterprise Licensing Agreement. The report was so strong that it
spawned legislative oversight hearings, a state Department of Justice
investigation and at least an initial inquiry by the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   In the view of Republicans and some Democrats on the Joint
Legislative Audit Committee, that Oracle stood to gain a virtual
monopoly on software for the state was significant. Oracle has not
been a major campaign donor in California, and Davis' aides testified
during the hearings that campaign money had nothing to do with their
decision.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Source of Funds</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans nonetheless believe it was not lost on Davis'
aides that Oracle Chairman Lawrence J. Ellison is among America's
richest men, and potentially a new source of campaign money for the
Democratic incumbent facing reelection this November.</TE>
<TE>   "Every leader sets a culture for their office," said Assemblyman
Bill Leonard (R-San Bernardino). "This administration is more
politically aggressive than others that I've worked with.... There is
a culture that to get ahead, you've got to be known as someone who
has contacts with interest groups. When Oracle and Logicon came
knocking, here was a chance for up-and-comers to open the door. This
was their ticket to advance."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans weren't the only ones to suggest that procurement had
become subject to politics.</TE>
<TE>   "Political and monetary influences were brought to bear on this
contract," said Assemblyman Dean Florez (D-Shafter), who chaired the
oversight hearings but was removed from the audit panel last week. "I
am convinced this contract would have died a deserved death had it
not been for those influences."</TE>
<TE>   That the issue even reached the governor's top aides, if not the
governor himself, was somewhat unusual.</TE>
<TE>   Although Republican Gov. George Deukmejian's administration was
not without its missteps--a failed $50-million Department of Motor
Vehicles computer project got its start during his years--Deukmejian
had a policy against allowing procurement issues to reach his office.
Career civil servants dealt with such matters, not political
appointees.</TE>
<TE>   "We never got involved in procurement, period," said Sacramento
attorney Steve Merksamer, who was Deukmejian's chief of staff. "We
just didn't do it, as a matter of policy."</TE>
<TE>   The Oracle deal was odd in other ways too. Dispelling the notion
that government moves slowly, a mere 22 days passed between the first
sales pitch and May 31, 2001, when five top Davis administration
officials agreed to it.</TE>
<TE>   Despite more than 100 hours of legislative oversight hearings,
questions remained unanswered. Why, for one, did Davis not know about
the deal? The governor has been called a micromanager. But though he
personally gets involved in many matters, particularly those related
to politics, those who have worked closely with him dismiss the
notion that he cares about such gritty detail of government as
contracts and computer software procurement.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Busy With Energy</TE>
<TE>   Besides, in May 2001 the governor was busy with the energy crisis.
Among the most pressing matters, Davis was fighting to avert a replay
of the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric bankruptcy and striking a deal to keep
Southern California Edison afloat. To carry the bill implementing his
deal, Davis tapped Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles).</TE>
<TE>   Polanco, meanwhile, had shown an interest in Oracle, urging that
Finance Director Tim Gage meet with salesmen that May. Polanco
scoffed at any notion that there was horse-trading. "That's real
deep-sea fishing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Gage directed one of his analysts, a veteran civil servant
who headed a unit that is supposed to analyze such deals, to meet
with salesmen pitching it. The analyst, Debbie Liebrock, could recall
no similar instance in which she was expected to meet with vendors,
she testified during the hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Gage and other upper-level Davis aides who were involved in the
debacle retained their jobs. Three others were forced to resign as a
direct result of the deal:</TE>
<TE>   * Elias Cortez, head of the Department of Information Technology
and a booster of the deal. He became so emotionally distraught during
his committee appearances that his testimony was delayed several
times. He testified that he was cut out of the final decision-making.</TE>
<TE>   * Arun Baheti, Davis' director of e-government. He breached Davis'
policy by accepting a $25,000 donation from Oracle lobbyist Ravi
Mehta a week after the Oracle deal was signed and sending it to
Davis' campaign committee. Baheti and Cortez often feuded when they
tried to work together. Davis aides tell of having to act as
mediators when the two were together.</TE>
<TE>   * Barry Keene, a savvy former state senator. As head of the
Department General Services, Keene was the official most responsible
for procurement, and more than any other Davis appointee Keene fell
on his sword. But the failure was not Keene's alone.</TE>
<TE>   Five top aides to Davis signed off on a document authorizing the
deal. But the one who approved it, Steve Nissen, testified he wasn't
even in Sacramento when it was circulated. Nissen gave approval by
phone after an aide called him in Los Angeles and read him parts of
the memo. Nissen since has returned to private practice at Manatt
Phelps, a law firm that counts Oracle as a client.</TE>
<TE>   Aileen Adams, Davis' consumer affairs secretary, who oversees
departments responsible for protecting Californians against various
types of fraud, also approved the proposal but said she assumed Gage
would check the numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Gage's role was particularly surprising, given the Finance
Department's role in state governance. Finance's analysts routinely
oppose legislation because of cost, and serve as the governor's main
gatekeeper.</TE>
<TE>   In this instance, Gage signed off on the deal without doing
analysis--then took an apologetic tone in an e-mail to analyst
Liebrock, the career state employee who repeatedly raised questions
about the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously," Gage wrote, "this sort of on-the-fly review of such a
significant proposal is not what we would prefer, but we don't always
set the rules."</TE>
<TE>   The state's first computer debacle of note occurred in 1994, when
then-Gov. Pete Wilson pulled the plug on the DMV project after the
state spent $50 million on a system that never worked. Back then, an
audit concluded that state officials were swayed by overly optimistic
sales pitches.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Logicon's Dual Roles</TE>
<TE>   In this instance, Northrop Grumman subsidiary Logicon served as a
consultant to the state and later became Oracle's main sales
representative, standing to make $28 million on the $95-million deal.
Lockyer, the attorney general, has said Northrop Grumman's dual roles
may have violated state law. Auditors looking at the Oracle deal
concluded that, just like their predecessors a decade ago, state
officials did not check claims and promises by salesmen.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) is the one who pulled at the
Oracle thread last year when she read a critical article about the
deal in the San Jose Mercury News and called for the Bureau of State
Audits investigation.</TE>
<TE>   She and others note that California relies on outside consultants
who may or may not place their own pay above the taxpayers' best
interest. Perhaps, some lawmakers suggest, the state needs to recruit
high-tech experts and retain them by paying them salaries comparable
to Silicon Valley pay.</TE>
<TE>   "In the scheme of procurement," said Bowen, "it is harder to buy
computers than pea gravel, and we have trouble with pea gravel."</TE>

<HD>Schools Still an Issue in City Votes</HD>
<DH>Secession: Poll shows many are unaware ballot measures
won't affect L.A. Unified, and both sides may benefit from that
confusion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Voter confusion about whether the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood
secession bids on the Nov. 5 ballot would break up the behemoth Los
Angeles Unified School District gives both sides in the campaign a
potent weapon, strategists say.</LD>
<LD>   A Los Angeles Times Poll last week found that three of four
respondents either mistakenly believed secession would split the
736,000-student district, which includes the Valley and Hollywood, or
did not know one way or the other.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles city officials say the public's lack of information
exposes a crucial weakness in the secession message. They argue that
voters will abandon the breakaway movement once they realize the
measures do not apply to the school district, which is frequently
criticized for low academic performance, overcrowding and a bloated,
inefficient bureaucracy.</LD>
<TE>   Secessionists say voters should support the breakup as a first
step toward severing relations with the nation's second-largest
school district. As long as Los Angeles stays whole, they contend, so
will the district. Valley and Hollywood cities could make a stronger
case for breaking up the district, the secessionists add. Last
December, the State Board of Education unanimously killed a plan for
two separate Valley school districts.</TE>
<TE>   Voters seem to want clarity.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what's happening with the schools," said Patricia
Lombardo, 59, a longtime resident of Panorama City, a working-class
neighborhood in the heart of the Valley. The secession proposals, she
said, "don't make any sense if the school district isn't included."
Because it's not, she plans to vote against secession.</TE>
<TE>   To be successful, Lombardo said, a new Valley city would have to
make education a priority. "It is one of the most important issues
facing a city."</TE>
<TE>   Those opposed to a municipal divorce accuse secessionists of
confusing the school issue to spark momentum for a lagging campaign.
The poll found that Valley secession is favored by 52% of voters in
the Valley and 38% citywide, while 61% of Hollywood voters oppose
cityhood for their area.</TE>
<TE>   "The pro-secessionists are trying to make a covert effort to tie
the school district with [city] secession," said Kam Kuwata, who is
managing Mayor James K. Hahn's campaign against a breakup. "The two
have nothing to do with each other.... It's dishonest of the
secessionists."</TE>
<TE>   Kuwata said Hahn plans to eliminate the confusion during upcoming
months. "Where secessionists confuse," he said, "we'll clarify."</TE>
<TE>   But political consultants said the school issue stands to benefit
secession proponents, not the mayor. Allan Hoffenblum, a Republican
political analyst, said Hahn will have to take care not to sound like
a cheerleader for the district. "He can't say, 'Keep L.A. together,
so we can keep the school district together,' " Hoffenblum said.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists say they separate school and city issues, although
most have long supported efforts to divide LAUSD, the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority and other agencies that they say have grown
too big.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Brain, president of Valley VOTE, the group spearheading
secession, noted that advocates for chopping up L.A. Unified already
tried to get the issue on the ballot. He said the State Board of
Education would be more likely to call an election if the Valley were
its own city. "We encourage those who want a new school district to
support city secession," Brain said. "We tried it the other way, and
it didn't work. Now, we might have a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood resident Rose Marie d'Amato, 47, agreed. "With a better
city, it makes sense," said the secession supporter.</TE>
<TE>   However, forming new municipalities is no guarantee that the state
would approve carving up L.A. Unified, which serves 27 cities in
addition to Los Angeles. The last community to successfully break
away from L.A. Unified was Torrance in 1948. And in the last few
years, Carson voters rejected a bid to split off from LAUSD, and the
state declined to put a similar proposal on the ballot in Lomita.</TE>
<TE>   About two-thirds of The Times Poll respondents said the school
district issue would have no effect on their secession vote.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people consider [LAUSD] as one of the public agencies
that has caused the city the most problems," said Thomas Mayer, a
36-year-old Westwood resident who opposes secession, partly because
of the schools.</TE>
<TE>   Mayer admonished leaders of both campaigns for failing to clarify
the issue. "We need to be aware," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Until late last year, separate campaigns for city and school
secession were under way in the Valley, and often converged. Valley
VOTE latched onto the efforts to dismantle L.A. Unified as a way to
build alliances for its cause.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Gene La Pietra, leader of Hollywood's cityhood bid,
said that secessionists will soon collect signatures calling for the
community's schools to split from L.A. Unified.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra, a millionaire nightclub owner, who wants to be mayor of
a new Hollywood city, said he hopes that such a proposal will be
placed on the ballot next year, an unlikely goal, many say.</TE>
<TE>   State law requires school secessionists to collect signatures of
8% of those who voted in the proposed district during the last
gubernatorial election. Once the signatures are verified, the
11-member Los Angeles County Committee on School District
Organization would study the issue, hold public hearings and
recommend to the state whether an election should be held.</TE>
<TE>   State officials would then hold hearings before deciding whether
to put the matter before voters.</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie Carter, a Tarzana resident who led the failed campaign
for two Valley school districts, said the political will for
splitting L.A. Unified is weak. "Unless it's there," she said, "I
don't think it will happen."</TE>
<TE>   David Lemon of Sylmar sends his 7-year-old daughter to a private
school because he believes L.A. Unified is academically inferior. He
could support school secession, but shattering the city into three
makes him cringe. And he's confused.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not really aware of all the details," he said.</TE>

<HD>Use of Force Probed in Videotaped Arrest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Law enforcement authorities have launched an investigation into
whether police used excessive force when arresting a 16-year-old boy
at an Inglewood gasoline station. The incident was captured on
videotape.</LD>
<LD>   The footage, taped about 5 p.m. Saturday, shows the African
American teenager being picked up by a white Inglewood officer and
slammed onto the trunk of a police squad car.</LD>
<LD>   Surrounded by about five Inglewood officers and Los Angeles County
sheriff's deputies, the teen-ager then appeared to be punched in the
head by the same officer.</LD>
<TE>   "The guy was out of it. It's pretty clear he's totally subdued,"
said Mitchell Crooks, an amateur photographer who videotaped the
incident from a nearby hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "He [the police officer] picked him up like a rag doll and then
slammed him to the car ... then he clocked him."</TE>
<TE>   Filming the incident, Crooks said, made him feel like he was
watching "the next Rodney King," a reference to the 1991 videotaped
police beating that was broadcast across the nation and sparked
public outrage.</TE>
<TE>   The teenager, whose identity was not released, was taken to a
hospital and treated for injuries before being taken into police
custody, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Police booked the youth on suspicion of assaulting a police
officer, and he was later released. The nature of the teenager's
injuries was unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Both Inglewood police and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department said they would investigate the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "A thorough investigation into the use of force by sheriff's
deputies will be conducted, which is routine any time force is used
by department personnel," said Sgt. Rick Myers, a Sheriff's
Department spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The incident occurred Saturday when sheriff's deputies pulled over
a car whose driver was wanted for driving with a suspended license.</TE>
<TE>   The driver was at a gas station on West Century Boulevard just
inside Inglewood. Several Inglewood police then arrived at the scene,
and an altercation ensued with the 16-year-old boy, who was a
passenger in the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Crooks said he was sitting in his hotel room across the street
when he heard a woman screaming that police were beating a man.</TE>
<TE>   Grabbing his video camera, Crooks said, he rushed to the hotel
balcony and started filming. The footage appears to show the officer
lifting the boy by the collar and pants and throwing him face first
onto the trunk of a police car.</TE>
<TE>   Pinned against the vehicle, the teenager turn his head toward the
officer, who then appears to strike him in the head with a closed
fist. The same officer appears to grasp him around the neck before
other officers intervene. At that point the boy is escorted to a
police car.</TE>
<TE>   In the video, the teenager and the officer appeared to have
suffered injuries. Blood appeared to be dripping down the boy's face,
and the officer appeared to have a wound above his left ear.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear what happened in the moments before the footage
was taken.</TE>
