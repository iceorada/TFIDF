<HD>Networks Hope to Keep Old 'Friends,' Make New Ones</HD>
<DH>Television* Executives shuffle the cards, back off the quiz
shows and cross their fingers that Miami will prove to be hot.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The annual television scheduling free-for-all gets underway today, as
networks prepare prime-time lineups for a fall season that will see
several familiar faces return, the quiz shows "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire" and "Weakest Link" take a seat on the sidelines,
"Friends" end its storied run and at least a pair of new shows with
Miami as a backdrop.</LD>
<LD>   None of the networks was confirming scheduling plans
Sunday--treating sitcom choices and potential time-period shifts like
government secrets, intent on keeping competitors guessing as to how
best to counter their moves.</LD>
<LD>   Still, industry sources say NBC, which will finish the current
season in first place, will launch this week's presentations to
advertisers in New York today by announcing a revised fall schedule
that includes just five new series, among them "Good Morning Miami,"
a comedy set around a morning TV show from the creators of "Will &amp;
Grace," which will join the Thursday lineup.</LD>
<TE>   The additions also include a pair of Sunday-night dramas and two
new sitcoms on Tuesdays, with "Just Shoot Me" said to be shifting to
lead off that night and "Scrubs"--which could wind up being the sole
survivor among comedies NBC introduced this season--landing the
historically perilous Thursday slot after "Friends."</TE>
<TE>   NBC approaches the fall with perhaps a greater-than-usual sense of
urgency, seeking to establish programs that can shoulder the
"Must-See TV" mantle as "Friends" heads into its final year.</TE>
<TE>   Toward that end, sources say, NBC has assembled a lineup that will
leave four nights of the week unaltered, viewing stability as an
asset in the crowded TV environment--especially with ABC and Fox each
concluding disappointing seasons and destined to implement more
sweeping lineup changes.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, ABC--whose ratings dropped more than 20% this season--is
expected to overhaul its lineup with changes to every night except
the Saturday movie. The revamped schedule, to be presented Tuesday,
will probably leave "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" off (after the
show occupied four hours in prime time just two seasons ago) while
the network tries to reclaim its roots by offering family-oriented
comedies at 8 p.m. across the week.</TE>
<TE>   That could include moving "The Drew Carey Show" from Wednesdays to
Monday nights, paired with the Carey-hosted improv show "Whose Line
Is It Anyway?," creating an hour that would precede "Monday Night
Football" in other time zones and follow it on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   All the networks are seeking to impress media buyers and boost
their share of the more than $7 billion that advertisers will commit
as part of the so-called "upfront" market.</TE>
<TE>   As for NBC, the network enters the fall campaign with plenty of
proven hits but knowing that its comedy misfires of the last few
seasons could soon catch up with it. TV's top-rated show, "Friends,"
will end in 2003, and Tuesday anchor "Frasier" is preparing to begin
its 10th year.</TE>
<TE>   The success or failure of NBC's new shows, then, will help
determine how long NBC's Thursday lineup can continue to proclaim
itself "Must-See TV," especially with the CBS drama "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation" taking a bite out of the NBC audience, beating "Will &amp;
Grace" and "Just Shoot Me" by a substantial margin.</TE>
<TE>   With "Just Shoot Me" relocating to Tuesday, where "Frasier"
remains popular, NBC will have two established programs to help
introduce the new comedies "In-Laws," about newlyweds who move in
with the bride's parents, played by Dennis Farina (best-known for
tough-guy roles, such as in "Crime Story") and "Designing Women's"
Jean Smart; and "Hidden Hills," about suburban couples, whose
ensemble cast includes the well-traveled Paula Marshall.</TE>
<TE>   "Good Morning, Miami," meanwhile, features Mark Feuerstein (who
previously starred in the short-lived NBC sitcom "Conrad Bloom") as
the new wunderkind producer of a low-rated morning show. The series
comes with a few footnotes, among them that NBC Entertainment
President Jeff Zucker might have a special affinity for the material,
having himself once been the wunderkind producer of NBC's "Today."</TE>
<TE>   For whatever reason, Miami seems to be the hot prime-time
destination this season, with several series candidates set there,
among them the CBS spinoff "CSI: Miami," starring "NYPD Blue's" David
Caruso.</TE>
<TE>   The new NBC dramas include "American Dreams," a nostalgic
coming-of-age story set in the 1960s--a period NBC successfully
tapped with the miniseries "The '60s"--using "American Bandstand" as
a backdrop. Dick Clark is one of the producers, and another former
"Blue" regular, Gail O'Grady, plays the 15-year-old protagonist's
mother.</TE>
<TE>   The other is "Boomtown," a Los Angeles-set crime show featuring
Donnie Wahlberg, Mykelti Williamson and Jason Gedrick, expected to
follow "Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent" on Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   NBC has also ordered a potentially controversial series about the
drug trade, "Kingpin," said to be similar to the movie "Traffic."
That program will be held until later in the season, as will "Mister
Sterling," characterized as a sort-of updated "Mr. Smith Goes to
Washington," with Josh Brolin as an idealistic young senator.</TE>
<TE>   Continuing a trend that has seen networks increasingly supply
their own programming, seven of NBC's eight new shows for the fall or
midseason are produced at least in part by the network's production
arm, NBC Studios.</TE>
<TE>   Among programs expected to be left off the schedule, meanwhile, is
"Watching Ellie." That would make Julia Louis-Dreyfus the third
"Seinfeld" co-star to strike out with a comeback sitcom, following
Michael Richards and Jason Alexander.</TE>
<TE>   NBC has canceled "Leap of Faith," which temporarily occupied the
post-"Friends" slot and, like "Watching Ellie," premiered behind a
promotional avalanche during the Winter Olympics. Also missing is the
quiz show "Weakest Link" (though a half-hour syndicated version
continues to play on local TV stations) and the comedy "Three
Sisters."</TE>
<TE>   ABC's lineup was still in flux, but the network is expected to
schedule at least eight new series and move several existing shows to
different time periods, including the first-year sitcoms "According
to Jim" and possibly "The George Lopez Show," which has been renewed.
Two long-running ABC comedies, "Spin City" and "Dharma &amp; Greg," have
reportedly been canceled.</TE>
<TE>   The network's strength once rested on family comedies such as
"Roseanne" and "Home Improvement," and its roster of new shows
clearly seeks to recapture that niche. It includes John Ritter as the
protective father of teenage daughters in "Eight Simple Rules," comic
Bonnie Hunt playing a talk-show host and mother in "Life With
Bonnie," a "Bridget Jones's Diary"-esque sitcom about a plain
secretary tentatively titled "Less Than Perfect," and "I've Got You,"
an interracial romance from writer John Ridley ("Three Kings"),
starring Duane Martin and "ER's" Ming-Na.</TE>
<TE>   Among ABC's new dramas are "That Was Then," about a 30-something
man who travels back in time to high school; and "Push, Nevada,"
billed as an interactive mystery, with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck
among its producers.</TE>
<TE>   Notably, all six of those programs are produced by Walt Disney
Co., which owns ABC and supplied 26 of the network's 30 new series
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   CBS will present its schedule Wednesday and Fox on Thursday. In
addition to "CSI: Miami," CBS' new additions are expected to include
sitcoms starring Mark Addy, the portly "The Full Monty" co-star; and
Alfred Molina, playing a famous novelist trying to forge a
relationship with his grown daughter, in a show from former producers
of "Frasier."</TE>

<HD>Diddley Has No Regrets With BMI</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and Little Richard, a true triumvirate of
rock 'n' roll royalty, will stride to a Beverly Hills stage Tuesday
night for another in an endless number of awards in their careers.
But this time it's an "icon award" from BMI, the performance rights
group that represents 300,000 U.S. songwriters, composers and
publishers. BMI, in essence, collects license fees when a song is
played on the radio, performed, used on a television show, etc., and
then distributes the money to its members, who range from Leadbelly
to Britney Spears.</LD>
<LD>   BMI's business may sound like a dry affair to outsiders, but to
Diddley, for one, this award will be special because of the way BMI
handles that business.</LD>
<LD>   "The only people that ever did me right, in the 1950s and all the
way up through now, is BMI," the blues-minded guitar hero said. "I
have no regrets in my 47 years with them; everything in the book was
right."</LD>
<TE>   If he were the regretting kind ("I'm not," he says), Diddley could
certainly make a list. The artists and songwriters of his era,
especially the African Americans among them, were routinely denied
the pay-offs due their classic work.</TE>
<TE>   "I was one of them," he said. "I was dealt the wrong hand in the
card game. I was brought up in a generation of trusting people, and
we found out that there are few people out there that can be trusted.
Everybody gets funny with the money. It's the great American rip-off,
and it's still going on."</TE>
<TE>   Diddley was unaware of the recent Recording Artists Coalition and
its campaign to use political reform and public opinion to revamp the
often arcane practices of the music industry, but after hearing about
it, he said he's a fan. And at the awards ceremony at the Regent
Beverly Wilshire Hotel, he will make an informal contribution to the
ongoing battle by seeking out young songwriters. "I have advice for
them: Don't trust anybody in this funky business."</TE>
<TE>   Then it's make to the business he knows best: making music.
Diddley will perform at 2:30 p.m. Sunday at the Doheny Blues Festival
at Doheny State Beach, just south of Dana Point Harbor.</TE>

<HD>Less Than Sharp ' Barber of Seville'</HD>
<DH>The co-production by Opera Pacific and Madison features
uneven performances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The most famous entrance aria in opera is Figaro's "Largo al
factotum" in Rossini's "The Barber of Seville." Everyone in the
sold-out Irvine Barclay Theatre on Saturday was waiting for John
Packard to sing it in Opera Pacific's new co-production of Rossini's
sparkling comedy with Madison Opera.</LD>
<LD>   Packard had just appeared last month as the murderer Joseph
DeRocher in Jake Heggie's "Dead Man Walking." Though that was all
well and good, it didn't given him an opportunity to sing a hit tune,
much less a piece that challenges a baritone's high voice and breath
control. Could Packard sing?</LD>
<LD>   So as the familiar warp-speed introduction revved up, what did we
see? A couple of street urchins preceding an Italian stereotype of a
pushcart vendor, wearing a bowtie, a dandyish suit and a stylish felt
hat. This was our Figaro, who would immediately act out a number of
the aria's lines, including the insinuating one about delivering
assignation notes between men and women. Here he took a note from one
little girl and gave it to a boy, who gave him an apple to take back
to the girl.</LD>
<TE>   It was all too cute, and very typical of the anything-for-a-laugh,
hyperactive stage direction by Linda Brovsky.</TE>
<TE>   You want to know how he sang: He had trouble with the first high G
but recovered. His baritone was tight and steely and had a fast
vibrato. He didn't triumph, but he didn't disgrace himself, and like
a true professional he covered gracefully when he couldn't pull a
pair of scissors out of his cart on cue.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, Packard was a desperately needed though excessively
used galvanizing force in this blunt version of Rossini's comedy.</TE>
<TE>   Lynette Tapia brought one of the tiniest sopranos in existence to
the role of Rosina. She used it agilely and evenly, although never
stylishly growing and expanding on any phrase. Her mugging projected
far further than her voice did in the 750-seat theater, and that's
saying something. Every ensemble had to be adjusted down to keep the
other singers from overwhelming her, which was one of the
reasons--but only one--that the vocal energy level was so low.</TE>
<TE>   John Osborn sang Count Almaviva coarsely, but he had a voice twice
the size of Tapia's, which lent an unexpected comedic edge to their
declarations of love.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Fernando, now an Opera Pacific resident artist, acquitted
himself solidly as Doctor Bartolo, maintaining vocal and dramatic
dignity even in such tasteless requirements as singing the start of
his second act aria in falsetto to parody a once-famous castrato.</TE>
<TE>   Silvia Vasquez, another resident artist, did not fare as well in
Berta's aria, but there is promise there. Christopher Scott Feigum
boomed in Basilio's slander aria and swung his obligatory black
umbrella as well as anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Dipu Gupta designed the bright unit set pieces, which were rolled
into place by cast members (extravagantly so for the brief storm
scene in the final act). Beverley Thies designed the unsubtle
lighting, although the theater seemed to be having electrical
problems that night. The curtain rose prematurely twice, and the
lights outside the theater flickered on and off during the
intermission. Marie Anne Chiment designed the bright costumes. Once
past a miserably prepared Overture, conductor Robert Tweten enforced
reasonably taut tempos and coherence.</TE>
<TE>   "The Barber of Seville," Opera Pacific, Wednesday, Friday,
Saturday, 7:30 p.m.; Sunday, 2 p.m., Irvine Barclay Theatre, 4242
Campus Drive, Irvine. $40-$65. (949) 854-4646.</TE>

<HD>Probing a Darker Side of 'Cinderella'</HD>
<DH>Lyon company's production at UCLA offers a disturbing view
on psychology of childhood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maguy Marin's dollhouse version of "Cinderella" is less a nostalgic
view of lost childhood than a re-immersion in it: Childhood as a kid
experiences it, with its cruelties, irrationalities and
discontinuities, its needs and vulnerability. It is often not pretty.
There are no drive-by shootings, but there's enough real family
menace to push it into dangerous psychological depths.</LD>
<LD>   "Cinderella" was the magical, complex calling card of the Lyon
Opera Ballet at the Los Angeles Festival in 1987, and the Lyon
company brought the production--still magical and still
complicated--back for a two-day run (with different casts of
principals) over the weekend at Royce Hall on the campus of UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   It begins with antique dolls and puppets enacting the fairy tale
as a child might understand it, which is to say, not in a clear
linear narrative. There are digressions and discontinuities. Fifteen
years ago, that suggested a certain ineptness or poverty of
imagination on Marin's part. Not anymore.</LD>
<TE>   Similarly, her intercutting of the Prokofiev score with baby
noises and babble (credited to Jean Schwartz) was once particularly
controversial. Those segments continue to trouble because they seem
to go on too long and their movement invention looks so thin.</TE>
<TE>   But Friday they also forced a sense of reexperiencing children's
consciousness, from fixating upon particular, not necessarily
important events to being easily distracted or passing from wonder to
tragedy and back in the blink of an eye. It makes little sense to an
adult. But that may be Marin's point: Childhood is not a simple,
single thing, nor is it an especially rational one.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing haunting, evocative masks by Monique Luyton and padded
costumes by Monserrat Casanova that alter body proportions and
restrict movement and dramatic parameters, the dancers nevertheless
conveyed a rich sense of character.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Ksenia Kastalskaia was a lovely, eloquent, vulnerable
Cinderella. Pierre Advokatoff was her lyrical, touching and not
always empowered Prince.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Tardy made a gnarly, menacing Stepmother. Marketa Plzakova
and Amandine Francois as the Ugly Sisters were cut from the same
cloth as their mother. As the space-age Fairy Godmother, Flora
Bourderon was less successful in projecting a personality, although
the role scarcely gave her an opportunity to do so.</TE>
<TE>   There were certainly elements of humor, whimsy or sheer delight,
but the production continually pulls toward psychological depths, and
in that lies its great accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   The central element is the egoism of children. This focus reached
a comic highpoint when Cinderella and the Prince were bowled over by
courtiers rushing to the table of sweets and fighting over lollipops
and candy canes.</TE>
<TE>   Set against that battle, Cinderella and the Prince taking an
interest in each other was touching and a step forward in
consciousness. Touch actually could be delicate and tender, as when
the hands of the two met and pulled away at the intensity of the
impact. When the Prince couldn't find her later during his search
around the world, he did a very unprincely but very childlike
thing--he sobbed.</TE>
<TE>   Marin also evoked a startling death-and-rebirth archetype in the
final scene when the Stepmother squats on Cinderella, hiding her from
the Prince's sight. To a wondrous, upward harp arpeggio, Cinderella
suddenly emerges from between her legs, toppling her backward. From
that point on, good triumphs and evil is contained. The Father
lassoes and ties up the Stepmother and the Ugly Sisters. Clearly,
Marin is working on a number of levels.</TE>
<TE>   Although we come to love the masks, the dancers hate them, said
company director Yorgos Loukos in a post-performance
question-and-answer session with the audience.</TE>
<TE>   They have trouble seeing and breathing while wearing them. Some
company members even resigned when asked to don costumes that so
distort and camouflage their well-honed physiques.</TE>
<TE>   When they remove the masks to take their curtain calls, it is a
shock because we have already grown to "know" these characters and
the real faces do not bear any resemblance to the characters we know.
The magic, which is the glory of the production, suddenly disappears.</TE>

<HD>Shand Explores R&amp;B and Soul Sounds at El Rey</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Appleford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Remy Shand gets soul music. It may be surprising that he's a white
man from Winnipeg, but ultimately that's irrelevant. At the El Rey
Theatre on Friday, long improvisational passages suggested he aims
not simply to imitate R&amp;B history, but to explore thoroughly the
sound from the inside.</LD>
<LD>   On his self-produced debut album, "The Way I Feel," Shand taps
into some of the most exciting, timeless corners of laid-back '70s
funk, showing his debt to the likes of Marvin Gaye and Sly Stone. He
performs virtually all the instruments himself on the album. But at
the El Rey, Shand was better served by the interaction of a live
band.</LD>
<LD>   Onstage, the music was sweatier, punchier, matching a heartbreak
beat with a voice to back it up: a crisp, reedy tenor that could be
breathy when he wanted to be. Sitting behind four keyboards, he
performed something he called "our L.A. jam," more jazz-funk groove
than finished song, with the words "Send me to the front line!"
repeated like a lovelorn mantra.</LD>
<TE>   "Take a Message" opened with a falsetto cry, demonstrating that
his chosen tradition includes as much Prince as '70s soul heroes. For
"The Mind's Eye," the 24-year-old picked up an electric guitar,
breathing deeply into the mike.</TE>
<TE>   Classic soul keeps coming back for good reason. But it requires
performers of depth to bring it alive. Between songs Shand was no
husky-voiced loverman, but whenever he sang one of those slow jams,
it was plenty authentic.</TE>

<HD>'Spider-Man' Already Showing Amazing Legs</HD>
<DH>Box Office* $72-million haul in its second weekend gives
the film $200 million in a record nine days.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GERMAIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now you know why they call him the Amazing Spider-Man.</LD>
<LD>   With $72 million in its second weekend--a number that would be a
tremendous debut weekend for almost any film--"Spider-Man" knocked
off "Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace" to become the fastest
movie ever to hit $200 million.</LD>
<LD>   "Spider-Man" passed that mark on Saturday, its ninth day of
release. It took "The Phantom Menace" 13 days to reach $200 million.</LD>
<TE>   The comic book adaptation starring Tobey Maguire and directed by
Sam Raimi has grossed $223.6 million in 10 days, according to studio
estimates Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The movie had the best second weekend ever, beating the $57.5
million that "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" took in its
second weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of those second weekends that's almost more
impressive than the first, if that's possible," said Paul
Dergarabedian, president of the box office tracking firm Exhibitor
Relations.</TE>
<TE>   After huge openings, films often nosedive by 50% or more in their
second weekend because so many people already have seen them.
"Spider-Man" held up strongly despite its phenomenal premiere, its
revenue dipping just 37%.</TE>
<TE>   "That's probably the most gravity-defying feat yet of
'Spider-Man,' to hold up like that from a number of that size," said
Jeff Blake, head of distribution and marketing at Sony, which
released the film.</TE>
<TE>   Opening in second place was the Richard Gere-Diane Lane adultery
thriller "Unfaithful," directed by Adrian Lyne ("Fatal Attraction,"
"Indecent Proposal"). "Unfaithful" grossed a healthy $14.2 million in
2,613 theaters. Distributor 20th Century Fox hopes good word of mouth
will establish "Unfaithful" as an adult alternative to "Spider-Man"
and its own new "Star Wars" movie that opens Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Older adults "don't rush out to movies like you do for
'Spider-Man' or 'Star Wars,'" said Rick Myerson, general sales
manager for Fox. "What you're hoping for with a film like this is a
consistency where you continue to play week after week after week."</TE>
<TE>   The teen comedy "The New Guy," about a nerd who gets a make-over
into a super-cool heartthrob at his new school, debuted at No. 3 with
$9.5 million. "The Scorpion King" held at No. 4 with $4.4 million;
No. 5 was "Changing Lanes" with $3.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   In a little more than a week, "Spider-Man" soared past "Ice Age"
to become the year's top-grossing film. "Ice Age" has taken in $170.8
million in two months.</TE>
<TE>   With broad demographic appeal and steady repeat business,
"Spider-Man" is expected to hold well next weekend, though it comes
up against "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones."</TE>
<TE>   "Star Wars" creator George Lucas already has conceded his film
will not break opening-weekend box office records because it is
debuting on about 6,000 theater screens, 1,500 fewer than
"Spider-Man."</TE>
<TE>   Lucas sought the highest-quality theaters, with digital sound, for
his new "Star Wars" movie, forgoing a shot at a record opening and
aiming for longevity.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not interested in opening weekends," Lucas said in an
interview last week. "I'm not interested in setting records. I know
that sounds silly because we've broken so many records and done all
that stuff.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm interested in making movies and telling stories and giving
audiences the best possible presentation."</TE>

<HD>It's Not Just About Seeing a Film 1st for Lined-Up 'Star
Wars' Fans</HD>
<DH>Movies* The 130 faithful from the group Lining Up outside
Grauman's Chinese Theatre also are raising money for Starlight
Children's Foundation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK DAY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last one was a bit of a disappointment--a lot of flash, but
ultimately a little hollow. Not the movie--no, this group of fans
would be pleased with any "Star Wars" experience. The feelings here,
outside Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, all have to do with
the line.</LD>
<LD>   In this age of online ticket sales, digital downloads, multiplexes
and 8,000-screen opening weekends, the act of standing in line for a
movie--in this case "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the
Clones"--means more than being the first to see a new film.</LD>
<LD>   For many in the group Lining Up, about 130 of the hard-core Force
faithful camped out on Hollywood Boulevard, this is the second time
around. Some have been here since the line's official start on April
4, sitting, waiting and sometimes sleeping out on the street in
anticipation of the film's opening.</LD>
<TE>   They all have tickets; those went on sale May 3. Now it's just
waiting. They work in shifts--each must put in at least 60 hours and
raise a minimum $50 for charity--for nothing more than the chance to
be at Grauman's first screening of the day when "Attack of the
Clones" opens on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Last Wednesday night, more than a week before "Attack of the
Clones" would open, 15 men and women were comfortably entrenched at
Hollywood Boulevard and Orange Drive, just down the block from the
Chinese.</TE>
<TE>   They pooled $70 to buy equipment from Home Depot to construct
replica light sabers, the weapons of choice for Jedi knights in the
"Star Wars" movies. While a few work on that, others sit bundled up
under the blue tarp that marks their base camp and watch a bootleg
video of "Spider-Man" with Chinese subtitles.</TE>
<TE>   They could probably be home doing the same thing with an
Internet-downloaded version of "Attack of the Clones," but the
experience of camping out with their "Star Wars" fanatic brethren is
more important.</TE>
<TE>   The line is also raising money for Starlight Children's
Foundation, but it's apparent that a communal love of George Lucas'
special-effects fantasies is what's keeping the participants going
night after night. "For me, really it's about hanging out with your
friends," says Craig Haasis, the group's charity organizer. "Some
people have said, 'You can do that anywhere. Why do you have to do
this?' Well, I don't see them getting off their butts and doing
anything while hanging out with their friends that helps kids and
families of pretty ill kids." They are quick to point out their
charity work in order to deflect the image of being "geeks" or
"nerds."</TE>
<TE>   If Haasis and others in line seem a tad defensive, integrity of
purpose is an issue here in the line. It has to do with what happened
last time.</TE>
<TE>   Haasis and other Lining Up organizers met two years ago while
camping in practically the same spot for "Star Wars: Episode I The
Phantom Menace." That line was organized by a few guys who put up a
fan Web site called Countingdown.com.</TE>
<TE>   Countingdown.com organized the line and also raised money for
charity, but it's founders had a flair for self-promotion that irked
the Lucas faithful. The first line "was pretty corporate," Haasis
explains. "And come to find out, the guys weren't really 'Star Wars'
fans. They were trying to get their name out and publicize their
site."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the "Phantom Menace" debut, Countingdown.com was
sold to Pop.com--a company funded by DreamWorks and Imagine
Entertainment--for an undisclosed sum. "Clearly the intent was never
to use anybody," says Phillip Nakov, one of Countingdown.com's
founders and organizer of the '99 line. "I'm sorry that they didn't
have the idea. They put themselves there.</TE>
<TE>   "They weren't being paid to be there. They weren't being forced to
be there."</TE>
<TE>   Some felt deceived, however, which forced a schism in the force.
Members who were only interested in waiting for the movie took their
belongings and moved to the other side of Hollywood Boulevard.
Diplomacy finally brought the line back together, but many still
harbored hard feelings.</TE>
<TE>   As Countingdown.com and other movie fan sites have discovered
since "Phantom Menace," a big movie isn't enough to get fans to line
up for days, let alone weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Countingdown.com tried to organize a weeklong
line outside the CineramaDome in Hollywood for "Spider-Man." What
went up the Friday before the movie's opening was gone by Sunday
night. Construction and low turnout were among the reasons blamed,
but Nakov declined to discuss the problems in detail.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipation for the movie has no bearing on the success or
failure of a line. As Russell Schwartz, New Line Cinema's president
of domestic marketing points out, the popularity of online ticket
sales and the sheer number of screens showing blockbuster films these
days takes the rush out of camping out to see a film at a particular
theater. "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" was a
box-office success, but fan-organized lines fizzled.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the high profile of the "Star Wars" lines, the studios shy
away from creating their own lines as a marketing tool. "We did not
think that would have been prudent for us to do as a studio,"
Schwartz says. "Those things should just happen on their own."</TE>
<TE>   Lining Up didn't need encouragement, even from those it's helping.
Between Los Angeles and San Francisco--which was organized by a
different group--the '99 lines generated $50,000 for charity by
Nakov's estimate, although Starlight Foundation's vice president,
John Mochitta Jr., puts the number at a more conservative $26,000.</TE>
<TE>   That's not much compared to Starlight's other fund-raisers, but
the charity doesn't have to worry about organizing it at all.</TE>
<TE>   "Other than us giving our moral support or occasionally bringing
food down to the line, this is all them," Mochitta says. "This is a
wonderful opportunity for us. We would love for people to give us $5,
$10, $15,000 every day."</TE>
<TE>   It's too soon to say how much this year's line will generate.
Lining Up's Web site organizer, Peter Genovese (www.liningup.net),
says that the 130 people signed up are each expected to raise a
minimum of $50, but many are doing more than that.</TE>
<TE>   Self-promotion, though, is something the fans in line this time
have little interest in. They did get a surprise phone call from
Lucas himself, but they don't expect much else except two more hours
of on-screen fantasy. And time to bond with their "Star Wars"
friends.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through an interview with line member Josh Cottingham,
another member, Steve Cote, appears at the line. Cote moved to
Connecticut shortly after the '99 line and hasn't been in California
in 18 months. He has arrived to join his friends for the last week of
their wait.</TE>
<TE>   As the group rushes to greet him, Cottingham drifts away from his
interview.</TE>
<TE>   "'Scuse us," says another line member. "This is a little more
important."</TE>

<HD>Artists Show Their Mettle in Eerie 'Mostly Metallophones'</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever wonder what a metallophone was? Probably not. But vibes players
know, and so do the gamelan artists (and listeners) of Indonesia.
Metallophones are tuned metal objects (bars, bowls, tubes, gongs,
etc.), struck with sticks or mallets--a xylophone, for example.</LD>
<LD>   The "Mostly Metallophones" concert at Pomona College's Lyman Hall
on Friday night offered an intriguing view of the sounds and timbres
that can be produced by various-sized metallophone ensembles.</LD>
<LD>   One of the events in the Micro- Fest 2002 Festival of Microtonal
Music: Global Tunings, the program was primarily performed by members
of the Harvey Mudd American Gamelan.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the music was composed by Bill Alves, an associate
professor of music at Harvey Mudd College.</TE>
<TE>   For the uninitiated ear, the sounds were mellow and repetitive,
often trance-like in their power to engage the listener. From a more
technical point of view, the pieces also offered easy access to
microtonal intervals not present in Western music.</TE>
<TE>   In the evening's more compelling moments, the shifting, plangent
tones were reminiscent of the far too rarely heard works of the
neglected American composer Harry Partch. That connection was
especially apparent during a duet composition written by composer
Kraig Grady for two vibraphones tuned to microtonal intervals--32 to
the octave--similar to those employed by Partch. The overtone effect
of the clashing, interacting, closely tuned vibraphone sounds was
eerie, driving some audience members to cover their ears. But it was
a convincing display of the potential tools for creative and
emotional impact that lie within the microtonal metallophonic musical
universe.</TE>
<TE>   MicroFest 2002 continues weekends through May 25. Information:

<HD>An All-Mozart Program for Pasadena Symphony</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the third time in the Pasadena Symphony's 2001-2002 season, Jorge
Mester presided over an all-Mozart concert at the Pasadena Civic
Auditorium on Saturday night. Theoretically, one can go on spinning
off such self-contained programs almost indefinitely without
repeating anything or alienating much of the audience. And Mozart
gives you the flexibility to veer away a bit from the usual
overture-concerto-symphony ritual without quite abandoning it.</LD>
<LD>   This time, Mester's "overture" was a Mozartian anomaly, the Adagio
and Fugue in C Minor, K. 546, a stern, forbidding throwback to the
contrapuntal style of J.S. Bach. Mester caught the ominous mood of
the Adagio and projected the themes of the Fugue with thrust, but the
performance became labored as it unfolded.</LD>
<LD>   The "concerto" was the Sinfonia Concertante for violin, viola and
orchestra in E-flat, K. 364, with sisters Ani and Ida Kavafian
communing on violin and viola, respectively. A stylistically
well-matched, if rather rough-and-ready pair in the first movement,
the Kavafians relaxed and produced their most songful work in the
slow movement, with an especially lush, almost mournful dialogue in
the cadenza.</LD>
<TE>   Making the Serenade No. 9 in D, K. 320 ("Posthorn") the designated
"symphony" in this lineup was an interesting idea but not a wholly
successful one, for despite its symmetrical structure, the sprawling,
seven-movement piece has patches of flagging inspiration. But it
triggered the most vigorous, committed, bracing playing of the night
from Mester and a chamber-sized contingency from the orchestra, with
a particularly lilting, life-affirming treatment of the fourth
movement Rondeau.</TE>

<HD>Krall in Good Company for Homecoming</HD>
<DH>Local accompaniment adds polish to the singer-pianist's
high-energy performance.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget what Thomas Wolfe said. Singer-pianist Diana Krall
demonstrated Saturday night that you can go home again, and she did
so in the confident manner of the major star she has become.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, she was born in Vancouver, but most of Krall's formative,
learning years were spent in Los Angeles. And the homecoming
qualities of her Saturday appearance at Universal Amphitheatre were
richly enhanced by her all-Southland accompaniment.</LD>
<LD>   Guitarist Anthony Wilson, bassist John Clayton and drummer Jeff
Hamilton--all major talents and bandleaders in their own right--are
now members of her regular working ensemble. Add to that a large
orchestra filled with the area's major studio players, conducted by
pianist-arranger Alan Broadbent, performing before a packed house,
and the entire performance took on the atmosphere of a Krall
celebration.</LD>
<TE>   She responded with a program clearly aimed at displaying her
versatile singing and piano skills, which have blossomed in the
decade since her primary goal was to develop her jazz instrumental
skills. It was also a program designed to please Krall's core
audience--jazz fans whose affection is for vocals blended smoothly
with her piano work--as well as newly arrived Krall aficionados drawn
to her recent big-orchestra torch singing.</TE>
<TE>   The performance kicked off in high gear with a highly oxygenated
romp through "I Love Being Here With You," followed by a briskly
swinging "All or Nothing at All." Krall's horn-like phrasing was in
full blossom as she punched out phrases, lifting the rhythm,
accenting the open spots in her lines with crisp piano punctuations.</TE>
<TE>   At times, her energies were at such a high level that she tended
to swallow words, not quite allowing them to emerge clearly. It's a
common Krall practice, and one that usually adds charm and character
to her readings. But in this case it threatened to obscure the lines
of her lyrics until she brought her phrasing into focus.</TE>
<TE>   On these tunes, as elsewhere throughout the program, guitarist
Wilson was the primary instrumental soloist, pouring out chorus after
chorus, each more impressive than the last. Always a potentially
important talent, he has risen to the top level of the crowded field
of straight-ahead jazz guitarists.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers with orchestral accompaniment--"Cry Me a River,"
"S'Wonderful" and "Dancing in the Dark" (from her "Look of Love"
album) and "Let's Fall in Love" (from "When I Look in Your
Eyes")--showcased Krall's svelte and sensual side. Sonically
gorgeous, interpretively compelling, they revealed how adept she has
become at switching into a traditional pop mode, reinterpreting
familiar material with an accessible, Sinatra-like jazz sensibility.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, any time these pop numbers leaned toward lightweight
blandness, and one's attention began to wander (never a problem with
Krall's small ensemble performances), she compensated. Richly layered
interpretive orchestral numbers, such as "I Get Along Without You
Very Well" and "I've Got You Under My Skin," revealed a maturity that
bodes well for Krall's creative future.</TE>
<TE>   That maturity also was evident in her rendering of Joni Mitchell's
"A Case of You," a number Krall unfortunately hasn't yet recorded.
Performed only with her piano accompaniment, it was as stunning as it
has been in a number of prior appearances.</TE>
<TE>   All of which led one to feel that, despite the appeal and success
of Krall's eclecticism, such a busy career hasn't allowed her time to
thoroughly mine her artistic depths. If she ever manages to blend her
inventiveness as a jazz artist with the lyrical, storytelling quality
she brought to "I Get Along Without You Very Well" and "A Case of
You," Krall finally will emerge not just as a million-album-selling
singer, but as the major artist she so clearly is capable of
becoming.</TE>

<LD>The perils of having just a little knowledge--seeing a tip but no
iceberg--may be overrated. Even worse, surely, is having no knowledge
at all.</LD>
<LD>   That's the good spin on a glossy new coffee table book that just
came in (yes, your humble surrogate viewer does read occasionally) as
part of this month's raging TV affliction known as anniversary-itis.</LD>
<LD>   The arrival of "Ultimate Biography" coincides with the 15th
birthday of A&amp;E's ongoing series of documentaries titled "Biography,"
the vast bulk of which are ultimate space fillers. Some respond
superficially to breaking news. Most are perfunctory and
unimaginative hours that reek of mass production. Since 1999, they
have been fronted blandly by Harry Smith. So it figures he would be
assigned to write the preface for "Ultimate Biography."</LD>
<TE>   What's striking is how closely this book copies the techniques of
TV in profiling "250 of the most powerful, revered, infamous and
interesting people who ever lived."</TE>
<TE>   The modus operandi of most newscasts, for example, is to render
everything equal and homogenous: 45 seconds of car chase followed by
45 seconds of celebrities followed by 45 seconds of terrorism, all
weighted the same, as if TV were flipping through a Rolodex of news.</TE>
<TE>   As it is with the book's baby bites of information. They come in
five categories with 50 sub-categories, each containing a short
profile supported by pictures and factoids ("Did you know ... ?").</TE>
<TE>   So Al Capone (Did you know he was a patron of the top jazz artists
of his day?) gets a half-page under "Gangsters" in this rigid format,
about the same space granted Jesus Christ under "Spiritual Teachers."
A profile of Evelyn Nesbit, a gorgeous femme fatale of the early 20th
century, is followed by one for pop phenom Madonna. A half-page on
Malcolm X is across from another on the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.,
followed by one on George Wallace, as if all three were equally
prominent in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   Although handsomely presented, the material is thin. You get
nothing from Muhammad's profile, for example, that even hints at why
a minority of Islam followers see in his teachings a call to violence
that drove the terrorism of 9/11.</TE>
<TE>   Even more notable are this A-list's omissions. "Getting down to
250 subjects was no easy task," Smith writes, "and by no means does
it mean that these are the only people who have changed the world."
Amen.</TE>
<TE>   A factoid on the movie "Quills," about the list-making Marquis de
Sade, mentions actor Geoffrey Rush. Yet the book excludes talk radio
giant Rush Limbaugh, arguably the nation's most influential
conservative of the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   You get Michelangelo, of course, but not that Michelangelo of
contemporary media, Edward R. Murrow, whose pioneering news work in
radio and TV for CBS became the standard by which broadcast
journalists in the U.S. measured themselves for nearly half a
century. Symbols matter. And whether fully deserved or not, Murrow's
reputation for integrity and heroism on the airwaves shone for
decades as a beacon for others to follow.</TE>
<TE>   The top 250 do include William Randolph Hearst, whose vast media
empire at one point ran to 20 major newspapers, along with a slew of
magazines, radio stations and news and movie syndicates.</TE>
<TE>   Yet nowhere under "Tycoons &amp; Moguls"--puh-leeeeeeze--is Rupert K.
Murdoch, who years ago outgrew his reputation for being no more than
a widely successful publisher of Hearst-ian tabloids. Murdoch's
global News Corp. holdings--running from TV Guide magazine to Fox and
the Fox News Channel--make him probably the leading media mogul of
this age.</TE>
<TE>   The most powerful, too, for unlike AOL Time Warner and other
worldwide media companies, Murdoch's sprawl is strongly identified
with a single individual, one whose reputation for imposing his own
political will and pandering to his audience's worst instincts (not
always deserved) make him a lightning rod for controversy. But
somehow he's not here.</TE>
<TE>   And whoa! The book gives you Tina Turner, but not Ted Turner,
surely the most visionary media mogul of our time, a flamboyant
Atlantan who redefined cable TV by launching a super station (WTBS)
in 1979 and the nation's first 24-hour news channel, CNN, a year
later. In doing so, he helped reshape our views of ourselves and
others.</TE>
<TE>   Although initially ridiculed by the major broadcast networks,
CNN's presence ultimately would reconfigure the entire landscape of
news, most notably television, both for better and for worse.</TE>
<TE>   If not for CNN and its partner, Headline News, there would be no
Fox News Channel and no MSNBC, and the planet would not be as
instantly accessible. But there also would be no 24-hour news cycle
to drive all media and rush information to viewers at dangerously
high speeds that carry the risks of error and distortion.</TE>
<TE>   Exclude Turner from the top 250? Go figure. With the exception of
Hearst, in fact, the news media that both inform and outrage us are
nowhere to be found in this 256-page book about influence.</TE>
<TE>   Unless, of course, you count the half-page on P.T. Barnum.</TE>

<LD>"Star Wars" fans may thrill to the sight of Jedi Master Yoda engaging
in an acrobatic light saber duel in George Lucas' "Star Wars: Episode
II Attack of the Clones," but don't count on the film's premiere
weekend to out-duel "Spider-Man."</LD>
<LD>   Asked about the record-shattering three-day opening of
"Spider-Man" two weeks ago, when the Columbia Pictures release
grossed a staggering $114.8 million, Lucas downplayed any potential
contest.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not a horse," the director snapped. "I don't do horse races.
I don't have to set records. I'm not a public company. I don't care
what Wall Street says, and I don't have to get my stock price up."</LD>
<TE>   To begin with, there is no way "Attack of the Clones" can come
close to "Spider-Man" on opening weekend because it won't be in as
many theaters. "Spider-Man" opened in 3,615 theaters. "Attack of the
Clones" will open Thursday in about 3,100 theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Dergarabedian, who heads box office tracking firm Exhibitor
Relations Co., said Lucas is more interested in booking his film into
quality theaters that can properly screen his movies than getting
involved in a numbers game. He noted that when "Star Wars: Episode I
The Phantom Menace" came out in May 1999, its opening weekend Friday
through Sunday gross was $64.8 million in 2,970 theaters. With its
two-day Wednesday head start, the five-day total was $105.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it was ever a strategic plan for Lucas to go after
'Spider-Man,'" Dergarabedian said. "Any film that wants to beat
'Spider-Man' is going to have to, at least, be in as many theaters as
that film to get the sheer number of people in there."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the unconventional Thursday opening of the new "Star
Wars" has prompted newspapers to jettison their custom of running the
reviews on the day the movie opens. The New York Times, for instance,
ran its review Friday; the Los Angeles Times publishes its review in
today's editions.</TE>

<HD>Academy Polishes Its Big-Screen Gems</HD>
<DH>Movies* The group's Film Archive has been restoring prints
of the best picture Oscar winners to screen for its 75th anniversary
celebration.</DH>

<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences began bandying
about plans for its 75th anniversary celebration a few years back,
one of the suggestions was to hold a screening series of all the best
picture winners. But there was a problem inherent in the idea: Were
there decent prints of all the films?</LD>
<LD>   "We didn't want to do it if we couldn't get a pretty good print of
everything," said Bruce Davis, the academy's executive director.
"There are some films we weren't sure we could get in good shape."</LD>
<LD>   The Academy Film Archive has been busy doing restorations as well
as some Sherlock Holmes detective work to get the best prints
possible for the 75-week series that kicks off tonight at the
academy's Samuel Goldwyn Theater with the second best picture winner,
1929's "The Broadway Melody."</LD>
<TE>   "Facets of the Diamond: 75 Years of Best Picture Winners" will
continue Monday evenings--save for holidays and Christmas
breaks--through December 2003. Besides the Oscar-winning best film,
the evenings will also include award-winning short subjects from that
year, the best song winner, and trailers for the upcoming week's
movie.</TE>
<TE>   A newly restored version of 1927's "Wings," the first best picture
winner, will be screened with a full orchestra May 16, 2003. "That
would be the same date of the first Academy Awards ceremony," says
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Obtaining usable prints for the series has made life interesting
for Michael Pogorzelski, director of the Academy Film Archive. For
example, all of the original 70-millimeter prints of the 1956 winner,
"Around the World in 80 Days," suffer from color fading or are lost.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the prints being screened come from the archive's own
collection. "We are making prints, and we are actually going ahead
and doing restoration," Pogorzelski says. "From the archival
prospective, one of the best things to come from the screening series
is that we can actually help preserve and restore a title."</TE>
<TE>   The Academy Film Archive is putting the finishing touches on the
restoration of 1933's "Cavalcade." "We're doing the restoration in
collaboration with 20th Century Fox," says Pogorzelski. "The
screening in June will sort of be the grand unveiling."</TE>
<TE>   No negatives or copies of "Cavalcade," Noel Coward's family saga,
were complete. "They were duped from a couple of different sources,"
he says. One negative was copied from a North American release print
that had been censored. One excised sequence was a montage of a party
that showed drug use and hinted at homosexuality; the new print has
restored the complete montage sequence.</TE>
<TE>   The 1938 Oscar winner "You Can't Take It With You," says
Pogorzelski, is in dire need of work. "It's a restoration that we
would like to do, but there just isn't enough time to do it before
the [July 15] screening," he says. "The Library of Congress has done
work on it. They have done what they can in their collection. But I
think it's time to scour the world to see what's out there."</TE>
<TE>   In the case of "The Broadway Melody," no archive has been able to
find a missing Technicolor musical number. The musical sequence is
still in the film, but only in black and white. "I don't know of any
original print in two-strip Technicolor," says Pogorzelski. "There
are rumors that pop up every once in a while."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Pogorzelski encountered more problems in the prints of
the best-picture winners of the '70s and '80s than in older films.
Though the studios have preserved the original negatives, several of
the prints from the academy's archive have faded.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of our own collection, we are going back and probably
having to make new prints of a lot of movies," he says. "The print
stock is especially susceptible to color fading. Our print of 'Annie
Hall' is completely pink." Other films that suffered from color
fading include 1971's "The French Connection," 1976's "Rocky" and
1980's "Ordinary People."</TE>
<TE>   There will be some real gems for film buffs in this series.
Pogorzelski boasts that the academy will be showing a "gorgeous
print" from the original camera negative of the 1957 winner "The
Bridge on the River Kwai."</TE>
<TE>   "The other great thing about this series is that we have a lot of
original dye-transfer Technicolor prints," says Pogorzelski. "Dye
transfer is a printing process where the color doesn't fade--instead
of being created photochemically on a single strip ... the color dyes
are literally stamped into the film strip. We have dye-transfer
prints of [the first two] "Godfather" films that are absolutely
gorgeous."</TE>
<TE>   In the case of 1951's "An American in Paris," 1958's "Gigi" and
1959's "Ben-Hur," the academy will be showing the original
dye-transfer prints; these are the same prints academy members saw
five decades ago when they were deciding the best-picture winners.
"This is a chance to see the films as they were originally seen,"
says Pogorzelski.</TE>
<TE>   Davis says the academy is still evolving other festivities. Last
Wednesday, there was a kickoff celebration at the academy's Margaret
Herrick Library on La Cienega Boulevard. In September, the Hollywood
Bowl is planning a musical tribute to the academy. "We are going to
let them pick out the music," says Davis. In October, the academy
will screen a newly restored version of Charlie Chaplin's 1928 comedy
"The Circus," for which he won a special Academy Award at the first
ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "Facets of the Diamond: 75 Years of Best Picture Winners," kicks
off Monday at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater, Academy of Motion Picture
Arts &amp; Sciences, 8949 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills. Screenings are
at 8 p.m. Admission is $5, or $3 for students with valid I.D.; a pass
to all 75 films is available for $75. For information call (310)

<LD>Welsh singer-songwriter and pianist Judith Owen entertained her
Friday audience at the Getty Center with a whip-smart mix of
observations about romance, comments on her wide-ranging influences
and endearing banter that neatly underscored her playfully self-given
tag: cerebral rock chick.</LD>
<LD>   Truthfully, she sounded more like a pop-jazz-soul chick during the
free 90-minute concert, held in the Harold M. Williams Auditorium as
part of the Getty's eclectic weekly performance series. Owen remarked
that the setting was more "highbrow" than the Westside nightclub the
Joint, where she has a Tuesday residency. Those shows have attracted
such luminaries as Van Dyke Parks and Richard Thompson, and Owen also
recently gained exposure in animated form on "The Simpsons."</LD>
<LD>   Abetted by drummer Herman Matthews and bassist Sean Hurley, Owen
previewed her forthcoming collection, "12 Arrows." At times attacking
her keyboard with feline ferocity, she sang in a lush, throaty voice
that growled or whispered with equally seductive ease.</LD>
<TE>   She showed a jaunty side with the Kinks-esque "Blighty," but
displayed a deep soul streak on Stevie Wonder's "Superstition" and
the wry, love-stinks funk of "Walking the Dog." But Owen proved

<HD>Cellist Gets Up Close, Personal on a Tour of Smaller Venues</HD>
<DH>Music*  Matt Haimovitz makes a stop at the Mint tonight to
perform solo Bach suites.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With cowboy boots and farming equipment hanging from the ceiling, the
Tractor Tavern in Seattle isn't your usual setting for Bach's Suites
for Unaccompanied Cello.</LD>
<LD>   But the place was packed recently when Matt Haimovitz made a
one-night stop there as part of his Bach Listening-Room Tour, which
brings him tonight to another club, the Mint in West Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "It went really well," said Tractor Tavern office manager Sara
Green. "We have all kinds of stuff here, but not classical music that
often. He was really well received. Absolutely we would bring him
back."</LD>
<TE>   "I'd book him again in a heartbeat," said Joe Bubina, manager of
Nietzsche's in Buffalo, N.Y., another of the 16 stops on Haimovitz's
six-month tour.</TE>
<TE>   So would Chris Luster, who handles bookings and sound at the
Oddfella's Cantina in Floyd, Va. "What he's doing is such a wonderful
thing, bringing classical music into a place where some people might
not even be exposed to it," Luster said. "The effect on the people in
the room was very much like a narcotic--you get swept away by it."</TE>
<TE>   Haimovitz, 31, is gratified but not surprised. "I think this music
is more appropriate in these venues than in concert halls," he said
recently from his home in Northampton, Mass. "So much gets lost in a
3,000-seat space. This is music that is universal. It transcends
economic, music and social background. In a 250-300 seat room, people
can experience it in a fresh way, without any prejudice."</TE>
<TE>   The idea for the tour emerged after a successful Haimovitz gig at
the Iron Horse Music Hall, a folk-music venue in Northampton, where
Haimovitz lives with his wife, composer Luna Pearl Woolf. He tried
the program a second time in New York. Bingo.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt I struck a nerve locally and wanted to know if this was
something that would happen around the country. So far, it's
certainly been welcomed by the public wherever I have been."</TE>
<TE>   And it's been welcomed by critics.</TE>
<TE>   "If playing Bach [at] the Tin Angel was an experiment," wrote
David Patrick Stearns in the Philadelphia Inquirer, "cellist Matt
Haimovitz succeeded in ways that say as much as about the needs of
the music-loving public as his extraordinary talent. The place was
packed to capacity (116 people), and dozens were turned away. Most
had never been to this club."</TE>
<TE>   From Haimovitz's perspective, mixing classical and club shouldn't
be such a big deal.</TE>
<TE>   "In the classical music world, we are afraid to degrade this music
that we revere," Haimovitz said. "I'm playing the most profound
pieces I know. I don't feel it's in any way taking away from the
music."</TE>
<TE>   Haimovitz knows the classical world well. A protege of Leonard
Rose at Juilliard, he made his Carnegie Hall debut at age 15, playing
the Schubert Cello Quintet alongside Isaac Stern, Mstislav
Rostropovich, Shlomo Mintz and Pinchas Zukerman. A concert debut with
Zubin Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic quickly followed. So did an
Avery Fisher Career Grant and ultimately a 10-year exclusive
recording contract with Deutsche Grammonphon records. (Six of his
discs also won awards.)</TE>
<TE>   "I got publicly categorized as a prodigy and I did high-profile
concertizing with wonderful conductors and orchestras," Haimovitz
said. "On the other hand, I never saw myself as a prodigy. I saw
myself as very seriously focused on the cello but also interested in
getting a rounded education."</TE>
<TE>   So he stepped back to get a liberal arts degree at Harvard
University. He graduated in 1996 with high honors.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a short memory in the music world. When you disappear for
two or three or four years, people wonder, 'Are you still playing?'
Of course I was still playing, mostly in Europe, during my college
years, still with orchestras and in recitals."</TE>
<TE>   But for a decade, he didn't play the Bach suites in public.</TE>
<TE>   "I feared not being able to attain perfection, the Platonic ideal
that these pieces deserved," he said. "I had to get over that. I did,
by revisiting them, going back to the manuscripts, and by working
with modern composers and getting a handle on 20th century solo cello
pieces.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to strip away everything that I knew about them. I realized
I was finding flaws in Bach--not musically, but finding the humanity
of this music. The humor and the emotion in it.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when it came to me to find intimate listening spaces."</TE>
<TE>   The tour, he said, has provided him with a few favorite moments so
far.</TE>
<TE>   "At the Tin Angel in Philadelphia, there was this roomful of
poets. I've never felt the chemistry like that; a tiny room. The
other place was the Tractor Tavern. It was like a rock concert, with
whistling and howling or sighing at the end of a movement. It was
this audible reaction now."</TE>
<TE>   In the clubs, Haimovitz gets a cut of the house or, at the
Oddfella's Cantina, a share of a hat that's passed around.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a different economic structure," the cellist said. "The tour
is definitely being subsidized by my concerto appearances."</TE>
<TE>   Lance Hubp, general manager of the Mint, booked him after hearing
a Haimovitz recording of the Bach suites.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was pretty exceptional stuff," said Hubp, who also
ran the Troubadour from 1989 to 1999. "I love to do anything that's
eclectic. This certainly qualified."</TE>
<TE>   Would he bring back Haimovitz?</TE>
<TE>   "I'll bring anything back that works well," Hubp said.</TE>
<TE>   Would Haimovitz return?</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever I can, I will be continuing this," he said. "My real
dream is at the end of this tour to return to these places and play a
whole program of solos by living American composers.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a feeling that this will take off within the classical
world. I was the last person I would have thought able to do this,
the last person I would have thought would hang out in bars. If I can
do it, anyone can."</TE>

Angeles. $15. (323) 954-8241.</TE>

<HD>Baryshnikov Still Steps Boldly</HD>
<DH>The 54-year-old leads his White Oak troupe in a program
featuring Sarah Michelson's 'Experts.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ESCONDIDO</DL>
<LD>A week ago, Mikhail Baryshnikov told Larry King that he expects to
quit dancing in a year or two. But like anyone planning major changes
to the landscape, he should be required to first file an
environmental impact survey.</LD>
<LD>   After all, for more than a quarter-century, Baryshnikov has set
the pace in the dance world--first for virtuosity, then for
versatility and finally in the use of fame to foster audience
development.</LD>
<LD>   Like Baryshnikov, other dancers have invented steps that expanded
the language of ballet (Irek Mukhamedov of the Bolshoi, for example).
Others, too, have left classicism for indelible achievements in
modern dance (Adam Cooper, for instance).</LD>
<TE>   But what other ballet star has spent his 40s and early 50s not in
profitable self-celebration but in the radical expansion of his
artistic horizons? And who else besides Baryshnikov could fill a
culture palace such as the 1,523-seat California Center for the Arts
in Escondido and then turn it into an alternative space?</TE>
<TE>   In Escondido on Friday, Baryshnikov and his White Oak Dance
Project performed an uncompromisingly contemporary four-part program
that included "The Experts," the kind of experimental, iconoclastic
piece that you'd expect to see in such venues as the Kitchen, Judson
Church and Danspace in New York--exactly where choreographer Sarah
Michelson has presented her previous work.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, Michelson carpeted the stage in plastic bubble-wrap,
with Baryshnikov and six colleagues sometimes moving soundlessly
across its squishy surface but elsewhere popping so many bubbles with
each step that the performance sounded like a tap-dance showpiece.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the bubble wrap on the floor, the use of layers dominated
the spatial organization of Michelson's choreography, her
white-on-white scenery, the costumes she and Tanya Uhlmann created
and Mike Iveson's score.</TE>
<TE>   So even if the movement itself often looked random,
unmodulated--just riffs in a void--the conceptual rigor encouraged
you to look more closely.</TE>
<TE>   And just as you began to resent that the supremely articulate
dancers were being relegated to isolated hand spasms, leg swings,
shoulder rotations and other discontinuities--along with the
distractions of a racing car forever zooming by on an overhead
projection screen--Emily Coates initiated a series of pristine,
barefoot balances on half-toe, arms drifting lyrically.</TE>
<TE>   As more dancers joined in, Michelson tapped into a whole new layer
of dance technique and metaphor, asking White Oak to balance on
bubbles, float a fraction above the stage and embody her vision of
postmodern heaven.</TE>
<TE>   No less challenging in its severity, Erick Hawkins' 1961 quartet
"Early Floating" explored formal positional shifts counterpointing
the spare instrumental textures of Lucia Dlugoszewski's "Five
Curtains of Timbre." Under a geodesic mobile by Ralph Dorazio, the
dancing began in simple, sculptural movement phrases: Raise one leg
high off the floor, with knee bent, and pivot to the front as your
arms rise, for instance.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, however, the alternation of hard and soft attacks introduced
dynamic variety, and the lack of contact between dancers yielded to
the use of touch as a motif: Baryshnikov's and Coates' feet touching,
for instance, or him standing behind her and gently lifting her arms.
Or Coates dancing between Roger C. Jeffrey and Zane Booker, their
legs stroking hers.</TE>
<TE>   Can there be Zen sensuality? If so, modern dance pioneer Hawkins
evoked it in this seminal work, staged for White Oak by Katherine
Duke.</TE>
<TE>   The evening began and ended with Lucinda Childs' recent solos for
Baryshnikov. At 54, he looked disarmingly effortless in the
expansive, sweeping turns and twisty interim steps of the moody
"Largo" (to music by Arcangelo Corelli), and impressively intense in
the dramatic, paranoid searching and whirling of the surprising coda
to "Chacony" (to Benjamin Britten).</TE>
<TE>   In his youth, Baryshnikov was acclaimed both for his technique and
his acting; without turning back the clock, these two solos renewed
those abilities in performances of meticulous control and full-out
emotional power.</TE>
<TE>   Before his entrance, "Chacony" had served as a sumptuous ensemble
vehicle enlisting nearly all the current White Oak dancers: Coates,
Jeffrey, Rosalynde LeBlanc, Miguel Anaya, Jennifer Howard and Sonja
Kostich.</TE>
<TE>   Here and in "Largo" you could see trademark postmodern
walking-into-dancing passages (everyday motion suddenly heightened),
as well as Childs' cool take on her accompaniments. The emphasis on
units of four (sometimes deployed in double duets) also enforced her
characteristic sense of structural unity.</TE>
<TE>   But the glowing backdrop, the elegant Deanna Berg costumes, the
quasi-romantic partnerships and Childs' focus on steps made her the
most conventional choreographer Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, an artist who seemed, not long ago, as intimidating as
Michelson now creates the relatively "safe" portions of a
contemporary program. That, alone, should tell you how daring
Baryshnikov's White Oak has become.</TE>

<HD>Pavarotti's Not Going Out as a Class Act</HD>
<DH>Two last-minute cancellations of performances at the Met
cap a decade of the tenor's physical and spiritual decline onstage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A few years ago, a friend of mine had composer Ned Rorem over for
dinner. As an expatriate in Paris in the 1950s, Rorem had attracted
as much attention for his physical beauty as for his music. Now,
however, the aging Rorem would not stop complaining about his
wrinkles. Exasperated, my friend said, "Oh, Ned, stop it! You finally
look interesting."</LD>
<LD>   That seems to be a lesson that Luciano Pavarotti, who had what may
have been the most beautiful tenor voice of the 20th century, never
learned. By canceling a gala appearance in Puccini's "Tosca" at the
Metropolitan Opera an hour before curtain Saturday night, Pavarotti
has apparently ended his opera career with a singular lack of grace.
The 66-year-old tenor has no further opera performances scheduled,
and none are expected. Although he will continue to perform in
concert, his last operatic role will undoubtedly be that of
Cavaradossi in a Royal Opera production of "Tosca" four months ago in
London.</LD>
<TE>   Pavarotti's performances at Covent Garden were not a disaster,
which is one reason why his New York dates were so widely
anticipated. The Met was sold out; a black-tie audience had paid as
much as $1,500 a ticket; 3,000 fans were gathered in Lincoln Center's
plaza, where the performance was broadcast on a large video screen.
And had Pavarotti sung, perhaps he would have pleased his nostalgic
New York fans as much as he pleased his nostalgic London fans.</TE>
<TE>   I happened to be at the final Pavarotti "Tosca," Jan. 21 in
London. The production, created for Maria Callas 39 years ago, may
have been a tattered wreck, but the recently renovated Covent Garden
looked spic and span. And Pavarotti appeared to have undergone
something of a renovation himself. He moved with more agility onstage
than he had in years, and his voice displayed a bit of the old
Pavarotti bloom. The problem was that he was profoundly
uninteresting, the operatic equivalent of excessive Botox injections
that not only removed wrinkles but also smoothed out expressivity.</TE>
<TE>   Expectations were exceedingly low. For a decade, Pavarotti had
been a pathetic figure onstage. His weight, his bad knees, his loss
of high notes and his general intellectual malaise meant that even
when he didn't cancel (which was often), he still might not seem all
there. He would prop himself against the scenery and gobble slices of
apples or sip water hidden in the props. Acting was the furthest
thing from his mind. It was all he could do to prepare himself for
each breath and get through a phrase.</TE>
<TE>   At Covent Garden, Pavarotti looked and sounded as though he had
gotten a new lease on life. He endeared himself to his fans for not
canceling, even though his mother had died just before opening night.
Maybe it was in her honor that he made a special effort. Not only did
he show up for all four performances of the opera, it almost felt
like the old times when his sheer love of being onstage made him
winning.</TE>
<TE>   But the fact is, he had very little to give. He has always been a
singer with phenomenal natural gifts and wonderful musicality but
little curiosity. And so on this occasion when he appeared to dig
deep into himself to portray Cavaradossi, a role he has sung hundreds
of times over the past 35 years, it wasn't to find some new essence
of the painter and political revolutionary of Puccini's opera. It was
rather a younger, wrinkle-free Pavarotti he hoped to resurrect. He
mustered what he could to sing rounded phrases. He ambled onstage, an
advertisement for quality knee surgery. Still, there was not one
instant when he was Cavaradossi. A wrinkled but wiser star might
actually have been interesting, but what we got was a plastic
Pavarotti of the past.</TE>
<TE>   Pavarotti's denial of his current physical state--evident in his
unwillingness to announce that his opera career has ended--is another
part of what made the Met cancellation so dispiriting. He had been
scheduled to sing twice, Wednesday and for the gala closing of the
Met's season, Saturday. On Wednesday night, he gave 90 minutes'
notice, claiming he had caught the flu at the dress rehearsal. When
the Met general manager, Joseph Volpe, stepped onstage to announce
that an understudy would sing, he was drowned out by angry boos.</TE>
<TE>   New York quickly became caught up in the saga of whether Pavarotti
would appear Saturday. Gamblers began taking bets. The Met flew in a
hot young tenor, Salvatore Licitra, from Milan, as insurance. The
banner headline in Friday's New York Post was "Fat Man Won't Sing."
All day Saturday, Pavarotti reportedly vacillated, monitoring his
congestion. Less than an hour before curtain, Licitra got word that
he would be making his Met debut. He had just enough time for a quick
discussion with the conductor, James Levine, and to meet his Tosca,
soprano Maria Guleghini, for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   The 33-year-old Licitra is an exciting singer on a new recording
of Verdi's "Il Trovatore." And perhaps Pavarotti's clumsy
cancellation will pass on the torch to a new tenor for a new era. But
it would have been far more satisfying if the older tenor would have
at least faced his audience Saturday, as Volpe had asked him to do,
and explained his condition and given his blessing to the new kid.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, we're left with the sorry situation of a has-been who
succumbed to the excesses of stardom. And it's hard to feel sorry for
a singer who can still earn $100,000 or more a night in
less-demanding concert appearances. At those concerts, where the
money is many times what it is in opera (the top Met fee is $14,000),
Pavarotti rarely cancels.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Who could have foreseen that two events as disparate as the repeal of
Prohibition and construction of the Hoover Dam a few years later
would lay the foundation for a town so steeped in infamy that the tag
"Sin City" would seem downright provincial.</LD>
<LD>   Or at least that's the provocative contention of "Las Vegas: The
Money and the Power," an eye-opening two-hour documentary airing
tonight at 9 on A&amp;E.</LD>
<LD>   The program, based on the book "The Money and the Power" by Sally
Denton and Roger Morris, assembles facts, rumors and smoking guns to
finger the Mob for its role in shaping politics not only in this
country but across the globe.</LD>
<TE>   And it explains that all this has happened because more than half
a century ago, some East Coast crime bosses stumbled upon the ideal
environment for growth in a sun-scorched patch of Nevada desert.</TE>
<TE>   Funds from illegal booze-running dried up after Prohibition, and a
push was on to find a replacement source of cash. Meanwhile, near Las
Vegas, card parlors were popping up in the shantytowns that housed
the thousands of men called in to build the Hoover Dam. Gee, who
could run the burgeoning gaming operations?</TE>
<TE>   The connect-the-plots web of allegations in "Las Vegas" is nothing
short of jaw dropping. Assassinations, the proliferation of nuclear
power, election-fixing--it's all there.</TE>
<TE>   And the Mob was always there, too, the program asserts, funded by
gambling's unstoppable revenue stream and some brashly creative
bookkeeping that could put Enron to shame.</TE>
<TE>   The extensive research and scores of on-screen interviews are
impressive for their scope, even if some of the conclusions and
extrapolations of logic seem a bit overreaching.</TE>
<TE>   They are far-fetched ... aren't they?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>We'll never see another "Star Wars," no matter how much we want to.
And we want to very much.</LD>
<LD>   But like the cherished passions of first love, the fervor called
forth by the landmark film is never coming back, and no amount of
prequels or sequels is going to change that. Paradoxically, the fact
that the latest prequel, "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the
Clones," is a bit better than its predecessor makes it clear how
lacking in the things that matter these newcomers are.</LD>
<LD>   Given its huffy 9-year-old protagonist and off-putting characters
like Jar Jar Binks and Watto the junk dealer, "Episode I The Phantom
Menace" was anything but a tough act to follow. Picking up the
adventures of Anakin Skywalker 10 years later, "Clones" (which opens
Thursday) has more menace and less Jar Jar, better battles and an
impressive parade of eye-catching splendors. But like the Tin Man,
"The Wizard of Oz's" C-3PO predecessor, it doesn't have much of a
heart. Writer-director George Lucas' gift for animating the inanimate
turns out to be paralleled by a tendency to deaden what should be
completely alive.</LD>
<TE>   As with "Phantom Menace," it is the pictorial element of "Clones"
that makes the biggest impact. Production designer Gavin Bocquet,
aided by four visual effects supervisors, three concept design
supervisors, an animation director and a previsualization and effects
co-supervisor (no, I don't know what that is either), has created
some truly involving alternative universes, and costume designer
Trisha Biggar has figured out what should be worn in each of them.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the film's action is also well-done, especially a
thrilling flying chase through the dizzying nighttime urban caverns
of Coruscant, the "Blade Runner"-influenced capital city. But except
for a climactic appearance by the venerable Yoda, whose
computer-generated lightsaber skills got him on the cover of Time
under a "Yoda Strikes Back!" headline, creating emotion is beyond
this film's powers.</TE>
<TE>   One reason is a script that feels, well, cloned, something Lucas
and co-writer Jonathan Hales (TV's "Young Indiana Jones," story
credit on "The Mummy Returns") threw together in their spare time.
The plot is standard, and the dialogue, even for something intended
for young people, is curiously flat. It ranges from the pious ("The
day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it") to
the predictive ("Why do I get the feeling you're going to be the
death of me," Obi-Wan Kenobi jokes to Anakin) to the pathetic, as
when Anakin grumbles about Padme Amidala, "I've thought about her
every day since we parted--and she's forgotten me completely."</TE>
<TE>   These stiff lines are matched by line readings so uniformly
impassive that even such lively performers as Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan)
and Natalie Portman (Padme) can't animate them. Only the veteran
Christopher Lee, with experience of doing things on his own during
his long career, gives a worthwhile performance as the villainous
Count Dooku. For what Lucas gets out of his cast, the actors might as
well be digital too, as is the rest of the film.</TE>
<TE>   This dramatic stolidity underlines yet again how fortunate
Lucas--and the world--was in the Harrison Ford-Carrie Fisher-Mark
Hamill troika that animated the original "Star Wars." Ford especially
brought the kind of wickedly nonchalant sense of humor to the
proceedings that has gone missing this time around.</TE>
<TE>   To be fair to the current "Clones" team, there's perhaps something
more at work here. When that first film was being made, it meant less
than zero to say you were part of "Star Wars"; the eyes of the world
were not on the production, to say the least.</TE>
<TE>   Now, everything has been close to sanctified, and those currently
involved seem weighted down by the knowledge that they're part of a
phenomenon. There's an unshakable self-consciousness about "Clones"
that does not work to its advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the picture does start promisingly, with Senator (and
former Queen) Amidala coming to Coruscant to try and preserve the
Republic against a secessionist movement. She's quickly the target of
multiple assassination plots, and the Jedi knight Obi-Wan and his
Padawan learner-apprentice Anakin are called in to protect her.</TE>
<TE>   Judging by his performance here (perhaps not a wise thing to do),
young Canadian actor Hayden Christensen was picked for Anakin
strictly on his ability to radiate sullen teen rebellion, something
he does a lot. Anakin chafes like a grounded adolescent at the
restrictions Obi-Wan places on him, grousing that the master is
"overly critical. He never listens. He just doesn't understand. It's
not fair."</TE>
<TE>   This High School Confidential in Outer Space tone is continued in
the forbidden romance (Jedis aren't allowed to fall in love) that
develops between Anakin and the senator. As the young people hide
from danger in an elegant Naboo retreat, they're burdened by a
formidable lack of chemistry. (Where are Tobey Maguire and Kirsten
Dunst when we really need them?) And they're saddled with dialogue
that might have been ransacked from old Harlequin novels: "I'm
haunted by the kiss you never should have given me."</TE>
<TE>   Everything inevitably ends in a climactic battle, where the
senator gets to fight bad guys while showing off a Britney
Spears-like bare midriff. Impressive though the computer work is, it
soon descends into video game overkill. Only a teenage boy could find
this kind of stuff continually diverting, and only a teenage boy
would not notice flimsy emotions and underdeveloped acting. It seems
George Lucas, like Peter Pan, has never really grown up.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG for sustained sequences of sci-fi action/violence.
Times guidelines: Some of the action is more intense and frightening
than the rating would indicate, including a decapitation scene.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Chamber Orchestra Ends Its Season in High Style</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Season-closing concerts tend to also be stock-taking occasions. When
the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra capped 2001-2002 over the weekend,
it celebrated the end of a season that had taken it to Carnegie Hall
(in April). At Glendale's Alex Theatre on Saturday (it also performed
Sunday at Royce Hall), LACO showed why it's a shining feature in
L.A.'s cultural landscape.</LD>
<LD>   The programming was shipshape, with a nicely balanced,
history-hopping agenda. Haydn's Horn Concerto No. 1 combined with a
tuneful blast of Tchaikovsky, Samuel Barber's rueful Violin Concerto
and, most importantly, a substantial world premiere, not just the
usual token concert-opener. Composer Kenneth Frazelle's five-movement
Concerto for Chamber Orchestra was commissioned by LACO; it returns
the favor by showcasing the ensemble's strengths, its tautness and
polish.</LD>
<LD>   Frazelle fashioned a piece in an accessible, tonal, pleasingly
familiar language. There are echoes of Copland, Barber and perhaps
Bernstein, especially in the "West Side Story"-ish rock rhythms of
the movement called "Tears/Tears." Perhaps too, Hollywood's influence
colored the proceedings, which sometimes settled too lightly, too
sweetly, on the ears.</LD>
<TE>   But the Concerto is ultimately a complex concoction, a tangle of
sometimes disarming tensions and releases in search of a cohesive
whole. By its heroic yet also unsettled final movement, "Glare," it
is music desperately seeking closure. As such, it may be music for
these fragile, hopeful times.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere on the program, soloists from the LACO ranks came
forward impressively. Hornist Richard Todd was moving in the graceful
passion of the Haydn's Adagio. Cellist Douglas Davis gave a singing,
creamy account of Tchaikovsky's Andante Cantabile. And violinist
Margaret Batjer closed the evening, and the season, on a reflective,
powerful note, in a performance of the Barber as notable for its
subtlety as its technical aplomb.</TE>

<HD>More Ways for Women to Skip Periods</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Women can now use several methods of hormonal birth control--not only
pills but also the new vaginal ring and skin patch--without taking a
break every fourth week to have a period, doctors say.</LD>
<LD>   Experts speaking at the annual meeting of the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, held last week in Los Angeles, said
there is no harm in using the contraceptives for several months
before allowing the shedding of the uterine lining.</LD>
<LD>   Forty years after the launch of the birth control pill, "we've
woken up and realized we don't need to have a monthly period," said
Dr. Anita Nelson, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at UCLA
School of Medicine.</LD>
<TE>   Also discussed at the conference were the increasing demands for
caesarean sections, the delivery risks of women in their 40s and the
nation's high rate of preterm births. But it was the increasing
number of options for skipping a monthly period that is likely to
generate the most interest among women.</TE>
<TE>   Women who want to use birth control pills continuously should
select a brand that is monophasic, meaning that each pill in a 21-day
package has an identical amount of hormones. Some birth control
pills, called triphasic, have varying levels of birth controls for
each week of the monthly cycle.</TE>
<TE>   Two newer birth control options, the Evra hormonal skin patch, and
the NuvaRing, a vaginal ring that releases hormones, can also be used
continuously, although they are not labeled as such, Nelson says.</TE>
<TE>   Evra recently became available, and NuvaRing, which was recently
approved by the Food and Drug Administration, should be on the market
this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Many doctors, however, may resist endorsing continuous-use birth
control until the FDA formally approves a product labeled for such
use--and that product is on its way. Seasonale, a birth control pill
marketed for 91 days of continued use, is currently in clinical
testing and may reach the market in 2003. Dr. David M. Plourd, an
assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Naval Medical
Center in San Diego, said women's birth control options are
increasing rapidly.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Evra and the NuvaRing, other newer methods are
Lunelle, a monthly birth control shot, and Mirena, a
progesterone-releasing intrauterine device that is approved for five
years' use. On the horizon is a simpler, smaller version of Norplant,
the hormone-releasing device that is implanted under the skin in the
upper arm, and Essure, a permanent birth control method that could
provide women with an alternative to tubal ligation.</TE>
<TE>   Essure is a tiny coil that is inserted into the fallopian tube via
a catheter deployed through the cervix. Once in place, tissue grows
around the implant to block the tube. Unlike surgical tubal
sterilization, Essure does not require an incision and can be
performed without general anesthesia. If approved, Essure could
become available early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Other topics of discussion:</TE>
<TE>   Caesarean sections. Is it reasonable for a woman having her first
baby to opt for a planned, elective caesarean section instead of
vaginal birth? That question continues to be hotly debated by
obstetricians. At a forum on the issue, doctors could agree only that
there is no scientific data showing the risks and benefits for an
elective, first-birth C-section.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we're yet in a position to be offering this as
standard-of-care," said Dr. Robert Resnick, a professor of obstetrics
and gynecology at UC San Diego. "We don't know enough to put this on
the table as the No. 1 option."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors are especially interested in determining just how much
damage a vaginal birth does to the nerves and muscles in the pelvic
floor. For example, many women suffer from incontinence after having
a baby.</TE>
<TE>   "We know there is short-term damage," said Dr. Joseph I. Schaffer,
an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University
of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. "But the question we
must address is what happens in the long term."</TE>
<TE>   An increasing number of women are asking for C-sections, says Dr.
Michael F. Greene, director of maternal-fetal medicine at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, but not because they worry
about future pelvic-floor damage.</TE>
<TE>   "Many women have a tremendous fear of labor," he said. "I think
that may be more of a factor in requesting an elective C-section than
we imagined."</TE>
<TE>   Age differences: Women having babies in their 40s are not at
greatly increased risk of complications compared to younger women,
according to a study presented by Dr. Vivien L. Pan of USC's Keck
School of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Pan reported on 551 women ages 40 to 49 and 14,951 women in their
20s and 30s. Her analysis showed that older women were more likely to
have existing disorders that can complicate pregnancy, such as
diabetes and chronic hypertension, and were also more likely to
acquire those conditions during pregnancy. Older women were also more
likely to undergo a C-section.</TE>
<TE>   However, there were no differences between the older and younger
women for rates of preterm labor and birth, a complication called
placenta previa, operative vaginal deliveries (such as use of
forceps), use of epidurals, rates of vaginal birth after caesarean
and the babies' overall health.</TE>
<TE>   Preterm births: Rates of preterm birth in the United States remain
stubbornly high--at about 10% of all births--despite several efforts
over the past decade to address the problem. So far doctors have only
been able to tell women when they are not likely to go into premature
labor, said Dr. Michael L. Socol, a professor of obstetrics and
gynecology at Northwestern University in Chicago.</TE>

<LD>A woman I know is convinced that the reason she has three sons and no
daughters is due to the British food marmite that she loves to spread
on her toast. This delicacy (black, tarry, boiled-down yeast extract)
is salty as heck--and salt, she says, favors the birth of boys.</LD>
<LD>   The odds of such a family lineup occurring just by chance,
according to my trusty calculator, are about one in eight. But I'd
heard of the salt link before and was intrigued enough to
investigate.</LD>
<LD>   Within minutes, I'd located a number of pastel-colored, stork- and
angel-adorned Web sites offering lots of help and advice for parents
who want to try to pick the gender of their child. Some of the sites
claim that eating lots of salt does favor a boy because it alters the
chemistry of the egg in a way that favors the entry of
male-determining sperm.</LD>
<TE>   But why stop at just eating salt? Timing of intercourse, acid or
alkaline douches, whether the woman has an orgasm, drinking coffee or
decaf--all of these and more are purported to push the odds in favor
of having one gender or another.</TE>
<TE>   The rationale is that there are basic biological differences
between sperm that carry an X chromosome (which lead to female
embryos when they fertilize an egg) and sperm with a Y chromosome
(which lead to males). And, further, that these odd-sounding
activities preferentially select for one type of sperm or the other.</TE>
<TE>   Having located all this advice, we called some fertility experts
to find out what they thought of it.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been intrigued by this stuff," says Dr. Richard
Paulson, chief of the division of reproductive endocrinology and
infertility at USC's school of medicine. "There are all these
different theories--about how boy sperm are smaller, faster but not
as hardy, and the girl sperm are bigger and slower but live longer
and tolerate acid treatment.''</TE>
<TE>   Much of the advice follows from these basic premises, Paulson
says. It is argued, for instance, that the odds of having a girl
increase if a couple has intercourse several days before conception
and the woman douches with acidy vinegar--because the "less hardy"
sperm will be dead by the time the egg arrives.</TE>
<TE>   Alkaline douches, on the other hand, are said to nurture the
Y-bearing sperm, and if intercourse is timed for right at ovulation,
those speedy boy sperm will fertilize the egg long before the
sluggish, X-bearing sperm gets anywhere close.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Paulson says, these theories are completely
wrong."All the tricks--having orgasms, not having orgasms, acid and
base douches--none of those work," says Dr. Alan DeCherney, professor
and chair of obstetrics and gynecology at the UCLA School of
Medicine. "It's just like people saying if you're carrying low it's a
girl, if you have hiccups it's a boy. There is an obsession with
gender."</TE>
<TE>   Yet X-bearing and Y-bearing sperm do differ slightly: The
X-bearing sperm have about 2.8% more DNA.</TE>
<TE>   Based on this difference, researchers have also tried a medley of
methods to separate the two types, such as forcing them to swim
through thick mucus. The idea is that the slim, athletic Y sperm will
wriggle along faster than the slightly stouter X sperm so they
eventually separate into two distinct packs.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't work either, says DeCherney, but other tricks--also
based on DNA differences--do.</TE>
<TE>   Reasonable for selecting girls, for instance, is a fancy-sounding
technique out of Virginia that employs lasers and DNA-binding dyes
and examines each sperm, one by one (which sounds like a
job-and-a-half).</TE>
<TE>   It sorts the sperm according to how much DNA each one has,
flicking it off down one of two sperm-sized passages.</TE>
<TE>   Even more effective is a method in which a single cell from an in
vitro-fertilized embryo is DNA-tested for gender. Then the sex of
choice is implanted. (This is a pretty controversial technique, and
many fertility clinics won't offer the service except for medical
reasons.)</TE>
<TE>   As for the future--who knows?</TE>
<TE>   "I predict," says Paulson, "that one of these days there'll come a
time when you'll go into the supermarket, go to the medicine section
and right next to the sanitary napkins will be a blue box and a pink
box that you can take home and mix with sperm to do at-home selection

<HD>Study Finds Antibiotic Is No Bronchitis Cure</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMMA ROSS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>An antibiotic commonly given for acute bronchitis is no better than
low-dose vitamin C at treating the coughing attacks, a new study has
found.</LD>
<LD>   Millions of people visit doctors every year for acute bronchitis,
and most receive antibiotics--even though there's not much evidence
antibiotics help, and it seems the condition is most often caused by
a virus, not bacteria.</LD>
<LD>   The study, published last week in the Lancet medical journal,
concluded that doctors should stop giving azithromycin, known by the
brand name Zithromax, to patients with acute bronchitis.</LD>
<TE>   Some experts said the findings confirm that antibiotics in general
are useless for acute bronchitis and that no antibiotic, whatever the
type, should be given. Zithromax is not the only antibiotic experts
have doubts about when it comes to treating acute bronchitis.</TE>
<TE>   Studies involving a variety of other antibiotics concluded that
though it's possible they might sometimes clear up the cough about a
day early, there's a hefty price to pay in side effects.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a maybe, but this study pretty well refutes that," said
Dr. Lorne Becker, head of family medicine at the State University of
New York Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, who was not involved
with the latest research but heads an expert group that regularly
analyzes the research on antibiotics and bronchitis.</TE>
<TE>   Becker said he found the evidence definitive. "There may be,
hidden in this big group of people who don't benefit, a small group
of people who do, but I don't think there's going to be a flip-flop
on this for the general person coming in with bronchitis," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Zithromax, made by Pfizer, is used to treat many bacterial
infections in different parts of the body, most commonly for
pneumonia and sexually transmitted chlamydia infections. Pfizer
stressed that its drug targets only bacteria, and its approval for
use in bronchitis is based on the assumption that sometimes the
coughing is caused by one of several bacteria types known to be
killed by the drug.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem is that it is not easy to tell whether
someone's bronchitis is caused by a virus or bacteria. There is no
test. Experts are not even sure whether bronchitis is ever caused by
bacteria, and there is no evidence that antibiotics prevent
bronchitis patients from developing pneumonia.</TE>
<TE>   However, many patients expect their doctors to "do something"
about it, so they are most often sent away with antibiotics.</TE>
<TE>   Experts have condemned such inappropriate use of antibiotics
because it allows germs to build up immunity to the drugs. The study
by researchers at Cook County Hospital and Rush Medical College in
Chicago involved 220 adults diagnosed with acute bronchitis--a
persistent cough.</TE>
<TE>   Half the patients were given Zithromax for five days, and the
others were given low-dose vitamin C pills. Vitamin C has not been
shown to be any good for bronchitis, and the patients didn't know
which drug they were getting, so the pills were considered a placebo.</TE>
<TE>   On day 7, the scientists measured how much improvement each
patient had seen in the health-related quality of their lives. The
proportion of patients who had returned to their normal daily
activities by day 7 was the same in both groups--89%.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If you had elective surgery more than four years ago, chances are you
were told not to eat or drink after midnight on the day of your
operation. Doctors used to believe that eating or drinking too soon
before surgery would cause vomiting, which could be very dangerous to
an anesthetized or groggy patient.</LD>
<LD>   But the American Society of Anesthesiology revised its guidelines
in 1998 so that prolonged fasting is no longer necessary. Patients
can have clear liquids up to two hours before elective surgery, a
light breakfast (tea and toast) six hours before the procedure and a
heavier meal eight hours before. Still, a study by researchers at a
Dallas hospital shows that old habits die hard.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers at Presbyterian Hospital interviewed 155 patients
about their experiences. The majority was still being told to have
nothing by mouth, liquid or solid, after midnight, regardless of when
their operation was scheduled that day.</LD>
<TE>   On average, patients fasted for 12 to 14 hours, which is much
longer than the anesthesiologist group suggests. And some people had
gone without liquids for as long as 20 hours.</TE>
<TE>   With modern anesthesia, inhaling bits of food while under
anesthesia is a rare complication, and prolonged fasting can cause
headache, dehydration, low blood sugar and other problems, report the
researchers. "You don't have to be thirsty before surgery. And you
don't have to have a caffeine withdrawal headache," says Jeannette T.
Crenshaw, family education coordinator at Presbyterian Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Julian A. Gold, co-chairman of the department of anesthesia at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, said that he has followed
the new guidelines on clear liquids for years but that the food
recommendations are more complicated. "I'm concerned that people will
take it to mean they can go to McDonald's on their way to the
hospital," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Gold points out that it is especially important to continue taking
any medicines that control chronic diseases. People sometimes believe
that "nothing by mouth" means they shouldn't take their pill with a
sip of water, he says. (American Journal of Nursing: 102 (5): 36-45)</TE>
<TE>   Hearing Loss in Women Coincides With Estrogen Drop, Study Says</TE>
<TE>   Estrogen is a hormonal multi-tasker in women, contributing to
roles as diverse as memory storage and bone growth. Now a South
Korean study confirms yet another role for the hormone: It may be
involved in hearing sensitivity. Researchers found that when estrogen
levels start to slide at menopause, so does hearing.</TE>
<TE>   In a study of more than 1,800 women older than 49, researchers at
the University of Ulsan in Seoul found that hearing loss was most
common in the older women. That's no surprise, considering that about
a third of people older than 65 experience some hearing loss. But
they also found that though all the post-menopausal women had low
estrogen levels, 11.6% of those in the group with the least estrogen
had hearing loss, compared with 2.8% of those with the most estrogen.</TE>
<TE>   Though other studies have indicated that estrogen-related bone
loss from key ear structures could explain hearing problems in older
women, this study didn't find that to be true. Spine and leg bone
density studies were done on all the women and did not appear to be
related. Other studies suggest the chemicals that transmit messages
in the brain may be affected by estrogen.</TE>
<TE>   A small number of women were on hormone replacement therapy, but
there were not enough women in the group to enable the researchers to
know if it prevented hearing loss. (Obstetrics and Gynecology
2002:99:726-730)</TE>
<TE>   Birth-Control Pill Users Who Are Overweight Risk Pregnancy</TE>
<TE>   Despite the fact that more than 500,000 U.S. women who take birth
control pills become pregnant each year, there have been few studies
exploring the biological factors that might play a role in pill
failure. Take body weight, for instance. The first study in more than
two decades to take a close look at weight and unintended pregnancy
indicates that heavy women have a 60% higher risk of pill failure
than women of lower weight. And the lower the hormone dose, the
greater the risk.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers interviewed more than 600 women about their
contraceptive use, including the type of oral contraceptive pills
they took at various times in their lives, and their weight and
pregnancy histories for about 12 years on average. This information
allowed the researchers to analyze the number of pregnancies that
occurred among women in four categories of body weight.</TE>
<TE>   Women on the pill who weighed the most--that is, more than 155
pounds--were more likely to become pregnant than women in any of the
three lower categories. According to Victorial L. Holt, associate
professor of epidemiology at the University of Washington in Seattle,
these women may not have enough progestin or estrogen circulating in
their blood to prevent conception for two reasons: Heavy women may
metabolize the drug quickly, and these hormones are absorbed by fat.
(Obstetrics and Gynecology:99:5: 820-826)</TE>
<TE>   Cancer Treatment May Dull the Sense of Taste, Researchers Find</TE>
<TE>   Weight loss is a cause for celebration for many healthy people,
but for a cancer patient too much weight loss can mean an emaciated
appearance and weakened immunity. This problem stems, in part, from
changes in taste and odor perception. Recently researchers at Duke
University demonstrated for the first time how much sensitivity is
altered. Now they are experimenting with natural flavor enhancers to
see if boosting the taste and smell of foods will lead to weight
gain.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-three elderly people with lung cancer were studied one
month after they started chemotherapy. Along with asking them about
the changes they sensed, Susan Schiffman, professor of medical
psychology at Duke, and her colleagues tested the patients' ability
to recognize the tastes of salt and sugar, and the smell of menthol
(a minty scent) and phenyl ethyl alcohol (rose scent). They found
that 39% of the patients needed larger than normal amounts of salt to
recognize its taste, and 58% needed larger amounts of sugar to
recognize sweetness. Their ability to detect and recognize odors was
also impaired.</TE>
<TE>   Although the researchers have not yet determined the relationship
between these dulled sensations and mortality, they did find that the
more salt a person needed to recognize the taste, the lower his body
mass. And the more taste and odor perception problems a person had,
the more likely he was to have appetite and weight problems.</TE>
<TE>   The Sad Bottom Line: There Is No Easy Way to Get Fit</TE>
<TE>   Many fitness experts have been saying that electrical stimulation
devices don't strengthen and tone muscles while you work at your
computer or read a book. Now there's scientific evidence to support
their statements. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-La
Crosse were unable to document claims that the machines can give you
rock-hard abs or firmer thighs.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers compared people who used electrical muscle
stimulating--or EMS--devices three times a week for 45 minutes to
those who used a fake treatment. After eight weeks, the 16 college
students whose upper arm, thigh and abdominal muscles were treated
with an EMS device had no change in skin fold measures, muscle girths
or strength.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven students in the group with the ineffective treatment did
just as poorly, though the researchers acknowledged that the men and
women could probably tell that they weren't getting a real treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Also telling was the fact that most of the volunteers said they
would rather go to the gym and lift weights for the average 45-minute
session.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration does require that EMS
devices meet federal safety standards. The agency has not approved
such devices for weight loss. (The Journal of Strength and
Conditioning Research: 16 [2]; 165-172)</TE>

<HD>Survey: Nearly 25% of Women Missed Care Because of Cost</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The high cost of health care is keeping a "significant minority" of
American women from getting the medical care they need, according to
a new national survey.</LD>
<LD>   About one in four U.S. women skipped or delayed needed health care
in the course of a year, while more than one in five couldn't afford
to fill at least one prescription during that time. Fewer men
reported the same barriers: 16% of men skipped or delayed care and
13% didn't fill a prescription.</LD>
<LD>   "These are bigger numbers than I expected to see ... and a real
cause for concern," said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family
Foundation, which released the survey last week. "We pay for that in
the end, because when people delay care, they are sicker when they
get care. They suffer in terms of their health and we wind up paying
more than we should as a society."</LD>
<TE>   Women who delayed or skipped care often did so because they lacked
insurance: a fifth of those surveyed reported being uninsured, with
higher numbers among the poor and some minorities. Among low-income
women, a third had no health insurance. Having a job did not
guarantee access to health benefits: Nearly 60% of women without
health insurance worked full time or part time.</TE>
<TE>   The survey found that many of those not getting care are sick. One
in three of the adult women surveyed had a health condition such as
arthritis, asthma, hypertension or depression, requiring ongoing
medical treatment. In addition, half of the women regularly took
prescription medications.</TE>
<TE>   And among all the women surveyed, 16% described their health as
fair or poor. Of those in the poorest health, nearly half said they
needed to see a doctor but didn't in the past year. Nearly 25%
reported having trouble getting tests or treatment approved by their
health plan in the previous two years.</TE>
<TE>   Altman said that although the current survey may not have
addressed the issue directly, women tend to make the family's
health-care decisions, so their views and satisfaction are key. The
survey found that women were especially concerned about out-of-pocket
health costs; 56% said such costs were very important to them.</TE>
<TE>   The survey was based on telephone interviews with 3,966 women age
19 to 64, who were asked about their health care in the past year,
and telephone interviews of 700 men conducted for comparison.</TE>
<TE>   The prescription drug problems hit poor and minority women
particularly hard, the study found. Women who said that cost kept
them from filling a prescription included 40% of the survey subjects
without insurance and 27% of those on Medicaid (known as Medi-Cal in
California). Cost was still a factor for some women who had private
insurance: 15% of them reported foregoing at least one prescription.</TE>
<TE>   About 28% of the women said they were uninsured at some point in
the past year.</TE>
<TE>   Half of those with gaps in their insurance reported going without
health benefits for more than a year, a fact that Altman said
contrasted with a common belief that people sometimes go without
health insurance for only a brief time.</TE>

<HD>'Miracle Cure' for Back Pain Has Lots of Appeal--and
Skeptics</HD>
<DH>Treatment* A doctor says he has given DiskCure to hundreds
of patients, but some experts criticize his secrecy and the lack of
clinical studies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENEDICT CAREY and DAVID R. OLMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About eight in 10 Americans suffer from back pain at some point in
their lives, and many try everything from bed rest to spinal surgery
for relief--with mixed results. Millions are still hurting, and
desperate for answers that doctors often can't provide.</LD>
<LD>   Of the many therapies that are touted in newspaper and radio
advertisements, perhaps the most visible in Southern California is a
treatment program known as DiskCure. Ads for DiskCure promise a
"breakthrough" drug treatment at a clinic known as the Institute for
Neurological Research. "Freedom from pain. At last. Without surgery,"
says the clinic's Web site.</LD>
<LD>   The clinic, operated by Dr. Edward Tobinick, a dermatologist and
internist, is housed at 100 UCLA Medical Plaza, in the heart of one
of the world's premier teaching hospitals. The clinic's Web site also
asserts that the treatment, using "a new class of biotechnology
medications," has brought relief to patients with various forms of
back, neck or leg pain associated with disk disease.In an interview,
Tobinick said his patients usually are given a single injection,
applied under the skin. "It's a miracle cure, a magic bullet," he
said.</LD>
<TE>   Some other pain specialists are skeptical, however. Decades of
research have failed to yield a single, all-purpose answer for back
pain, they say, and doctors often don't even agree on what's causing
the pain.</TE>
<TE>   Tobinick said his clinic, with locations at UCLA and in Newport
Beach, has treated about 1,500 people and that about two out of every
three patients have had "a significant improvement in their
symptoms." The clinic charges about $2,200 for a one-time treatment
and consultation. Some patients may require more than one treatment,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kathleen McGarry, of Santa Maria, said she was "flat on her back
for nine months with back and leg pain" and had gone from doctor to
doctor before visiting Tobinick's clinic in October. "Within two
minutes of the treatment, the pain was gone," said the 55-year-old
administrative assistant, one of several former patients whose names
were provided by Tobinick. "That was six months ago, and I'm back to
work; I'm fine."</TE>
<TE>   Tobinick is reluctant to discuss the DiskCure drug regimen in
detail. He would not name the medications he uses, saying only that
they are anti-inflammatory agents that moderate the body's immune
response. The drugs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration,
he said, but not specifically for treatment of back pain.</TE>
<TE>   It's not unusual for doctors to prescribe a drug to treat a
condition other than that approved by the FDA. For example,
physicians experimented with injections of botulism toxin, or Botox,
to smooth wrinkles, for years before the FDA finally approved the
drug for that purpose last month.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, doctors making use of an FDA-approved drug in a novel
way share their findings, by presenting data at professional
conferences or publishing their research in medical journals: This is
how other doctors learn about and evaluate new uses for medications.
Tobinick acknowledges that, so far, he has done neither. No studies
of the drugs' effectiveness in treating back pain in humans have yet
been made public, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Tobinick pointed to experiments in laboratory animals that
have shown that the anti-inflammatory drugs he is using can be
effective in treating disk injury. The studies were done in pigs and
in rodents, he said, while declining to cite any specific studies.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. James N. Weinstein, an orthopedic surgeon at Dartmouth
University's Medical School and editor of the medical journal Spine,
said he was aware of two such studies. In one, published in the April
15, 2001, issue of Spine, Swedish researchers reported that the drugs
etanercept (whose trade name is Enbrel) and infliximab (Remicade)
limited nerve damage and inflammation after disk injury in a group of
pigs. In the other, Japanese doctors found that a similar
anti-inflammatory drug limited disk damage in rats.</TE>
<TE>   But, Weinstein noted, "studies in animals in no way suggest that
the drugs are efficacious for all back problems. You would have to do
clinical trials in humans to determine that."</TE>
<TE>   Tobinick said he is organizing a human trial. The experiment, he
said, will include 20 people with back and leg pain: Ten will receive
an injection of the principal drug used in the DiskCure treatment and
10 will get a placebo injection, of saline solution.</TE>
<TE>   Says Tobinick: "We are going to publish a big article in the New
England Journal of Medicine, we hope."</TE>
<TE>   The Trial Process</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Eric Matteson, a rheumatologist at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., who is studying anti-inflammatory drugs, said
doctors who develop novel uses of a drug typically conduct initial
pilot studies. "What you do first is develop a hypothesis, then a
protocol for testing the drug," he said. "If you haven't formally
studied novel uses, then you don't know that the treatment really
works."</TE>
<TE>   A clinical trial is especially important for judging a drug's
effectiveness for a condition as subjective as pain, said Dr. Bill
McCarberg, director of pain services at Kaiser Permanente in San
Diego. Almost any treatment can have a temporary placebo effect on
pain perception, researchers say. Injecting a painkiller could give
people the confidence to resume their daily activities, for example,
and studies suggest that this change in attitude, along with
increased physical activity, can help relieve even severe back pain,
McCarberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Some patients say they assumed that because Tobinick's clinic is
at the UCLA Medical Plaza it has some formal affiliation with the
university (it does not), or that DiskCure is part of a research
study at the university (it is not).</TE>
<TE>   "The UCLA name in the ad certainly caught my eye," said Nancee
Hoertz, 46, a computer teacher in Orange, whose 16-year-old daughter
has had severe lower back pain for four years. Hoertz visited the
institute's Newport Beach office late last year, where she viewed a
marketing video for DiskCure. She learned that the clinic is not
affiliated with the university and eventually decided against having
her daughter undergo treatment there.</TE>
<TE>   Tobinick's clinic "is not endorsed by UCLA nor is it a part of any
UCLA research activity," said Dr. William Friedman, senior associate
dean for academic affairs at UCLA's School of Medicine. Tobinick is
one of several doctors with offices at 100 UCLA Medical Plaza who are
not paid faculty members of the medical school. According to
Friedman, Tobinick is one of more than 3,000 doctors on UCLA's
voluntary faculty--known as assistant clinical professors--who assist
in teaching medical students, residents and interns.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman said he did not know for certain what is involved in the
DiskCure treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Tobinick said he doesn't want to name the drugs he's using because
he's worried about misuse of the treatment, and because DiskCure was
discovered at the Institute for Neurological Research and is
protected by a patent. "This is a huge, huge breakthrough," he said,
"and we have plans to expand this around the world."</TE>
<TE>   According to U.S. Patent and Trademark Office documents, Edward L.
Tobinick and his brother, Arthur Jerome Tobinick, were granted a
patent in January 2000 to use several drugs for the treatment of disk
problems, Alzheimer's disease, carpal tunnel syndrome and a number of
other conditions. These include etanercept and infliximab, both
anti-inflammatory medications approved by the FDA for the treatment
of rheumatoid arthritis. Both drugs block the action of a chemical
involved in the body's immune reaction that doctors believe can
exacerbate pain and inflammation. Regular injections--which cost
roughly $150 a dose for Enbrel--dramatically reduce inflammation and
joint damage in arthritis patients, allowing them to lead more normal
lives, rheumatologists say.</TE>
<TE>   What a Patent Means</TE>
<TE>   A patent for an off-label use does not indicate government
endorsement of the treatment's efficacy; it's a legal claim that must
be defended in court, said Michael Davis, who teaches patent law at
Cleveland State University College of Law in Ohio. It's not uncommon
for people to patent novel uses of a drug, even if there's no solid
evidence that the drug works for that purpose, Davis said. "The
patent office couldn't possibly do its job if it had to verify every
novel claim for a drug," he said. "They have to rely a lot on the
inventor for that." Once granted, a so-called use patent allows its
owner to sue other doctors using a specific drug for the same novel
purpose without a licensing agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Robin Shapiro, a spokeswoman for Immunex Corp., which makes
Enbrel, said the company is aware of Tobinick's patent claiming the
use of Enbrel for treating back pain. The company, she said, has
heard that the doctor may be using the drug for that purpose but has
no way of verifying that. If true, "the situation is very odd. We are
very unhappy with the manner in which our drug is being used and
really feel it misrepresents the use of the product," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Several clinical trials of Enbrel are underway to study its
effectiveness and safety treating conditions besides rheumatoid
arthritis, Shapiro said, but none of those involve treating back
pain.</TE>
<TE>   Both Enbrel and Remicade are associated with rare but serious side
effects, including tuberculosis infection, multiple sclerosis
symptoms and blood abnormalities.</TE>
<TE>   Tobinick said the drugs used with DiskCure have not caused any
serious side effects in his patients and have met the FDA's rigorous
safety standards.</TE>
<TE>   Tobinick also operates the Institute for Laser Medicine, which
performs skin resurfacing. In addition, his clinic's Web site
promotes a new treatment for Alzheimer's disease, "developed,
patented and available exclusively" at the Institute for Neurological
Research. Tobinick said the drug he's using to treat Alzheimer's
disease is the same one he uses on most back-pain patients.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Gary Small, director of the UCLA Center on Aging, said some
doctors believe that anti-inflammatory drugs might help patients. The
National Institutes of Health is conducting studies of several
anti-inflammatory drugs for Alzheimer's disease, including naproxen,
which is sold over the counter in products such as Aleve and Anaprox.
"But it's a theory, that's all," Small said. "That doesn't mean we
should start treating Alzheimer's patients with new anti-inflammatory
medications."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Tobinick's unorthodox approach, some doctors said that if
DiskCure does indeed provide relief for back pain, the treatment
deserves to be seriously investigated. "One of my patients went
through the treatment and improved," said Dr. Steven Richeimer,
director of the pain management center at USC's Keck School of
Medicine. "If it looks promising, let's study it, with the data open
for colleagues to see--and no secrecy."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. J. Patrick Johnson, a neurosurgeon who is director of the
Cedars-Sinai Institute for Spinal Disorders in Los Angeles, said he
had advised Tobinick to conduct a scientifically rigorous study.
"They've been giving the treatment for two years now, in 1,500
patients, and there's no reason why they shouldn't have done that,"
he said. "Now I am concerned whether they ever will."</TE>
<TE>   Tobinick expects to answer his critics soon. Along with his small
study of 20 sciatica patients, he is preparing a research paper on
his experience with hundreds of other DiskCure patients. "I know
there are a lot of doctors out there who are skeptical of what we're
doing," he said. "But the proof is in the pudding. If it works, it
works. And we're about to show that it does."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Another Mother's Day has come and gone, and for this I'm grateful.
While I look forward to spending time with my loved ones, part of me
wants nothing more than to retreat inward.</LD>
<LD>   It's not that I have anything against buffet brunches and lily
corsages, but in my family this national day of recognition has come
to take on a more personal meaning, standing as a gateway between our
greatest joy and deepest sorrow. The week prior, we celebrate the
birth of our twin sons, the week after, we mourn the loss of one of
them.</LD>
<LD>   Born at 241/2 weeks of gestation and weighing 1 pound, 10 ounces,
and 1 pound, 7 ounces, respectively, our sons Anthony and Christian
were not just preemies--they were micropreemies. This category, often
associated with high-order multiples and drug-addicted mothers, also
affects families who have no reason to believe their newborns will
spend the first months of their lives in a neonatal intensive care
unit. But 50% of all twins are born prematurely and of those born
under 2 pounds and prior to 28 weeks, some statistics report that as
many as 50% die. After 10 days of life and what looked to be a
positive outcome for our baby Christian, we were broadsided with the
worst. He passed away before I ever held him in my arms.</LD>
<TE>   Four years have now passed. The tubes have long been taken out,
the bandages taken off, the IV marks on my surviving son's once
parchment-like skin have since scarred over, but some things don't
heal. I've come to realize that my experience as mother to a preemie
baby has lasting effects.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, I've stopped taking even the most basic things
for granted, especially when it comes to expectations of life and
death. I view pregnancy and childbirth as an experience fraught with
obstacles and peril rather than naturally effortless as folklore and
idyllic media images seem to suggest.</TE>
<TE>   My thoughts are with the many women each year segregated off to
the quiet end of labor wards, attached around the clock to monitors
and IVs, bravely biding their time as they try to prolong their
pregnancies. A few extra days for some, a few extra weeks for the
lucky ones. So to hear a supermodel extol the virtues of prenatal
yoga, to read about spicing up sex in the second trimester, to watch
a very visibly pregnant runner cross a 5K finish line ... it isn't
interesting, it's irritating. Who are these superhuman earth mother
goddesses with cervixes of steel, and why couldn't I have been one of
them? Deep down there's a feeling that I let my sons down. My first
assignment as a mother seemed simple enough, to protect them with all
my body and soul. And I couldn't do it.</TE>
<TE>   Though I've tried to put the experience behind me, it seems
constantly to come up. Like golfers comparing their handicaps, new
mothers compare birth stories. This puts preterm moms in a strange
position--if you do start in on your story, there's no turning back.
In my case, when people ask me how many children I have, I'm always
torn as to my answer. I feel so blessed to have Anthony and his
younger brother and sister that I sometimes even feel a little guilty
about my grief. But it's not pity we're after; we present our cases
as cautionary tales.</TE>
<TE>   My son's every cough, cold, change in mood, I meticulously
observe, record, interpret. I'm often preoccupied with what "could"
happen, ever fearful of being surprised again. As a small
countermeasure on this war of control I rank baby wipes right up
there among man's greatest inventions, purchasing them by the
crateful, taking them wherever I go and wiping down everything in
sight--sometimes at the risk of offending family, friends and
strangers alike.</TE>
<TE>   Rituals are another weapon in my arsenal for assurance, some
trivial, others more substantial. One such routine developed as a
result of Anthony's incidents of apnea bradycardia, a condition in
which newborn preemies temporarily stop breathing while they sleep,
often resulting in a lower-than-normal heart rate. Even though the
apnea had long resolved itself by the time he was sent home, for
several years I continued to wake up throughout the night to stand at
my son's bedside. With my hand over his chest, I reassured myself as
much as marveled over the beautiful independent pumping of his lungs.
It's something I do even today with his siblings.</TE>
<TE>   With the survival rates for these tiny newborns steadily
increasing, there are more of us out there than you might think.
Members of a quasi-secret society, sometimes with nothing more in
common than the bond of a shared experience, mothers of preemies
gravitate toward each other. Using a common language learned in the
NICU, we use our chance encounters to compare gestational ages, birth
weights, medications, time on respirator, release dates and follow-up
care. With encouraging words, we exchange news regarding the
long-term outcomes of these miracle babies and tell ourselves that
the worst is over.</TE>
<TE>   During those 101 days Anthony spent in the NICU, my allotted
"touch time" with him was every four hours. From the day he came home
to the present, I've tried to make up for the lack of contact those
first few months by taking every opportunity to hug, squeeze, kiss,
tickle and wrestle with him. It still doesn't seem enough, at least
from a mother's point of view.</TE>
<TE>   Thankfully, I think Anthony sees it differently. As a normal,
bright and fiercely independent child with a penchant for finger
painting, the traumatic circumstances surrounding his birth matter
little to him. Despite being smaller in stature than many of his
preschool peers, he manages to give them a run for their money just
the same.</TE>
<TE>   On his most recent birthday, I had the opportunity to reflect upon
his courage and strong will, factors that initially helped him to
survive and now thrive in this world. It's now time for me to take my
son's cue. Only by respectfully putting aside the past can I fully
share with him the joys of the present. Only by pushing past my own
fears can I help him prepare to experience the rich, full life he
deserves.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One day a few summers ago, my friend Ollie was prowling around his
yard on a lawn tractor when he became distracted while attempting to
back up. Problem is, the machine wasn't in reverse. After a head-on
collision with some innocent lawn furniture, the tractor came to rest
on top of Ollie. Although his pride ended up in intensive care, Ollie
wasn't injured.</LD>
<LD>   He's a lucky guy. Last year about 90,000 Americans landed in the
hospital due to accidents involving lawn mowers and other gardening
equipment, according to the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Danger also lies elsewhere in the toolshed. Each year, nearly
84,000 do-it-yourselfers cut themselves with power saws. And roughly
42,000 hammer-wielding Americans whack a body part hard enough to end
up in an ER. These numbers add up to a simmering male health problem.
After all, we're usually the ones who insist on rolling up our
sleeves when chores and home projects involve whacking and cutting
things.</LD>
<TE>   But tool-related accidents rarely occur because the head flies off
a hammer or a blade comes loose, says electrical engineer John
Drengenberg, manager of consumer affairs for Underwriters
Laboratories, the nonprofit company that tests and sets safety
standards for tools, appliances and other consumer products. By
Drengenberg's estimate, 98% of these mishaps occur because of human
error.</TE>
<TE>   Some basic mistakes we make when doing home repairs and lawn
maintenance are obvious, such as failing to wear goggles and other
protective gear or forgetting to attach a safety guard when using a
tool with a sharp blade. But tool-time calamities often occur simply
because a guy does not give the job at hand his full attention.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important piece of safety equipment is your mind," says
Steve Thomas, co-host of PBS' hit home-improvement show "This Old
House." "Whenever you pick up a tool, you should strive for and
achieve a Zen-like concentration." Thomas holds up his co-host, Norm
Abrams, as a model of focus. "When Norm is in the workshop, the guy
is a Zen master. As a result, he has all his fingers."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, trying to replace a dimmer switch between innings
of the ballgame while balancing your checkbook and talking on the
cell phone is a recipe for trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Haste is a related problem, says Drengenberg. Rushing while you
trim the hedges or clean the gutters so you can take the kids to
soccer practice or hit the links can have disastrous results. Some
men, in particular, are burdened with an unhealthy sense of
overconfidence when it comes to using tools, notes Drengenberg. If
you've seen one circular saw, you've seen 'em all, right? Wrong. The
safety tips featured in all manuals include information that can help
keep your limbs intact. What's more, Drengenberg adds, he frequently
hears men say that they want every safety enhancement imaginable--for
products their wives and kids might use. "But then they'll say, 'I
don't need any of that for my tools,'" he says.</TE>
<TE>   Some weekend handymen take this indifference toward safety a step
further, by altering protective features to make the equipment more
convenient--and more dangerous. Scott Wolfson, spokesman for the U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Commission, says it's not uncommon for a
consumer to buy a power tool, then shave down the third prong on its
plug so the device can be run on an old-fashioned electrical outlet.
To them, Wolfson offers a statistic: Each year, about 30 Americans
are electrocuted while using power tools.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to upgrade the outlet, not downgrade the tool," says
Wolfson. Any time you plug in a power tool, it should be to an outlet
equipped with a ground fault circuit interrupter, which protects
against electricity leaks. (You can buy a portable circuit
interrupter at most hardware stores.)</TE>
<TE>   Too bad there isn't a device that prevents leaks in concentration
while working with tools. As for Ollie, he now has to pay a guy to
cut his grass--his wife forbids him to use lawn-care equipment.</TE>

<LD>CURE: Cancer Updates, Research &amp; Education, Vol. 1, No. 1, Spring
2002</LD>
<LD>   Published by Cancer Information Group, 80 pages</LD>
<LD>   Overview: This new quarterly magazine, from a Dallas-based
publishing company managed by cancer doctors and researchers, is
being distributed free to patients and caregivers at least through
the end of this year. It's designed to help patients navigate
clinical trials, share the experiences of other cancer patients and
understand the terminology that's being thrown at them. Upcoming
issues are scheduled for release in June, September and December.</LD>
<TE>   What works: The first issue includes pieces on getting a second
opinion, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cancer fatigue, medication-related
brain fog, and updates on new drugs. The magazine includes a glossary
and "toolbox" of resources, including valuable Web sites and phone
numbers for specific malignancies. Readers are also likely to benefit
from the magazine's clear illustrations and the way it breaks down
information to avoid overload.</TE>

<LD>Few people give a second thought to taking aspirin or ibuprofen for
their everyday aches and pains. But perhaps they should.</LD>
<LD>   So many people now use these and other nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, such as the increasingly popular Vioxx and
Celebrex, that doctors fear many are unaware of the potential risks.
In one recent survey, nearly 75% of people who regularly used such
drugs said they were unaware of, or unconcerned about, some of the
most serious complications associated with their use.</LD>
<LD>   Like cortisone and other steroids, NSAIDs reduce inflammation.
(They do this by preventing the formation of compounds called
prostaglandins.) However, because they produce far fewer serious
complications during long-term use, a casual attitude toward them has
developed.</LD>
<TE>   As with all drugs powerful enough to do some good, NSAIDs have
significant risks, including allergic reactions, ulcers, and kidney
and liver damage. In fact, these drugs are thought to be responsible
for more than 16,500 deaths and more than 100,000 hospitalizations
each year in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Allergic reactions to NSAIDs can include "minor" reactions such as
skin rashes and hives and more severe reactions such as a
life-threatening swelling of the face, lips and throat. Contrary to
popular belief, these reactions do not typically occur the first time
the medication is taken, but only after the immune system has become
sensitized to the drug (which means that at least one dose of the
medication must usually be taken before another dose can trigger an
allergic reaction).</TE>
<TE>   The drugs can also damage the lining of the stomach, esophagus or
intestines, producing uncomfortable symptoms such as abdominal pain
and heartburn in 10% to 20% of people who take them. The damage
occurs because NSAIDs block the action of prostaglandins, which
protect these lining tissues.</TE>
<TE>   Gastrointestinal damage and symptoms occur most commonly after
regular, prolonged use of NSAIDs but can result even when the drugs
are used infrequently and at low doses. In most cases, the problem is
limited to discomforting symptoms. However, in about 1% of regular,
long-term users, irritation of the gastrointestinal tract becomes
severe and ulcers develop. The risk of ulceration climbs with the
dosage of drug and with the age of the user. Men and women with a
history of ulcer disease are at highest risk of developing this type
of complication and are generally advised to avoid NSAIDs.</TE>
<TE>   Gastrointestinal side effects can sometimes be controlled without
discontinuing NSAIDs by the use of a second drug that protects the
gastrointestinal lining. Another option is to switch to another
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.</TE>
<TE>   The newer NSAIDs, such as Vioxx and Celebrex, produce fewer
gastrointestinal side effects than their traditional counterparts.
Unfortunately, these newer drugs are far more expensive. (The cost of
one day's treatment with ibuprofen, for example, is about $1.50,
compared to about $3.50 for Vioxx or Celebrex.)</TE>
<TE>   NSAIDs can also cause damage beyond the gastrointestinal tract.
When taken regularly over a prolonged period of time, they can injure
the liver and kidneys.</TE>
<TE>   Tests of liver function become abnormal in up to 15% of people who
regularly take the drugs. Although, in many cases, the abnormalities
remain mild (and are frequently reversible if the medication is
stopped), in some instances severe organ damage may occur. Men and
women with preexisting kidney or liver disease need to be
particularly cautious about using NSAIDs; because their bodies cannot
eliminate these drugs as rapidly as normal, dangerous levels of the
drugs can build up in the bloodstream.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, NSAIDs can interfere with other medications that are
taken. For example, they may decrease the effectiveness of certain
high-blood pressure drugs called ACE inhibitors, such as Accupril,
Captopril, Lotensin, Prinivil, Vasotec and Zestril. There is also
some evidence that certain NSAIDs (including ibuprofen) can interfere
with the action of aspirin being taken to prevent heart attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of these adverse effects, it's important to remember that
for most people the benefits of these drugs--when used
properly--outweigh the potential risks. If you have any concerns
about NSAIDs you're taking, discuss them with your physician or
pharmacist.</TE>

<HD>Treat the Abuser, Reduce the Risk?</HD>
<DH>Those fighting to protect children from sexual molestation
confront many unknowns. But some methods to curb ruinous impulses
hold promise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA MARSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The scandal that has engulfed the Roman Catholic Church has thrown
light on a form of sexual abuse that, perhaps more than any other,
has always hidden in the shadows.</LD>
<LD>   The sexual victimization of children by adults reaches far beyond
the church to permeate society. Some experts say that as many as one
in four girls and one out of six boys under the age of 18 will be
molested at least once in their lives.</LD>
<LD>   But as troubling as the extent and harm of the abuse may be,
health care professionals working in the field say society must
decide not just how to punish the abusers, but how to treat them.</LD>
<TE>   Such decisions will not be easy. Reports that some priests accused
of molesting children were dispatched to church-run programs only to
subsequently molest again have ignited public outrage, sparking calls
for harsher prison sentences for molestation and casting doubt on the
effectiveness of all treatment programs.</TE>
<TE>   The doubt is warranted, critics of such programs say. They contend
that people who have abused children can never be fully trusted, that
treatment can do little to curb desires so deeply ingrained.</TE>
<TE>   "For those who've crossed the line and acted on their darkest
fantasies, it's very difficult, if not impossible, to go back," says
Ruben Rodriguez, director of the exploited-child unit at the National
Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Alexandria, Va. "Unless
treatment programs have a 100% success rate, the only way to
safeguard children is to take these people out of the mainstream."</TE>
<TE>   While that view is shared by many victims and their families, some
therapists and law enforcement professionals insist that simply
locking up sex offenders doesn't protect children. Every month,
California releases 250 to 300 sex offenders from prison or jail, and
more than 94,000 registered sex offenders are currently living in the
state, roughly two-thirds of whom were convicted of crimes against
children.</TE>
<TE>   Only treatment, therapists say, in combination with incarceration,
can stem what some say is a problem of epidemic proportions.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't beam these people to Mars--they're going to be back on
the streets eventually," says Father Stephen J. Rossetti, a
psychologist and president of St. Luke Institute, a church-run
psychiatric hospital in Silver Spring, Md. "If they get treatment, it
reduces the likelihood that they'll re-offend."</TE>
<TE>   However, in figuring out which treatment strategy works bests,
scientists are still grappling with many unknowns. Because child
sexual abuse frequently isn't reported, we don't have a true picture
of all perpetrators (although they're usually a relative or close
acquaintance of the victim), and we don't fully understand what
compels adults to be sexually intimate with adolescents or young
children.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating matters is the fact that sexual deviants are a
diverse group, from one-time abusers to fixated pedophiles who may
have committed hundreds of crimes against children as young as 2 and
3. And they come from every stratum of society, ranging from the
homeless to corporate executives and elected officials.</TE>
<TE>   What therapists and law enforcement officials do know, based on
the nation's hodgepodge of treatment programs, is that some abusers
respond better to therapy than others. The so-called "situational"
molesters who turn to children out of curiosity, stress or
convenience, for example, usually require less stringent
interventions than either classic serial pedophiles, who make up 5%
to 10% of sexual deviants, or violent sexual predators. And some
therapists believe the threat of lengthy prison sentences is the only
leverage they have to get offenders to change.</TE>
<TE>   "The hard-core sex offenders have a propensity for this, and no
matter what you do, they will re-offend the first chance they get,"
says Jerome Marsh, a parole official with the California Department
of Corrections. "For the majority of offenders, though,
treatment--along with tight controls and supervision--can work."</TE>
<TE>   For Abusers, Combining Therapy and Medication</TE>
<TE>   Therapy for abusers has evolved in recent decades. In the past,
treatment programs often relied on so-called talk therapy, in which
those with sexual feelings for children were encouraged to explore
the roots of their feelings. By understanding the source of their
urges, it was believed, the abuser could triumph over them.
Faith-based retreats, on the other hand, prescribed prayer,
meditation and spiritual cleansing as a way to overcome such desires.</TE>
<TE>   Most doctors and therapists no longer hold out hope of a "cure."
They do agree, however, that some sexual deviants can learn to curb
their impulses, in much the same way that recovering alcoholics stay
sober.</TE>
<TE>   Most treatment programs now use cognitive behavioral therapy, in
which abusers must acknowledge the wrongness of their actions and the
harm they've caused. They subsequently learn various ways to control
their behavior, such as avoiding playgrounds or being alone with
children.</TE>
<TE>   The therapy is often used in combination with drugs such as
Depo-Provera, a testosterone-lowering medicine that decreases the
male sex drive, and antidepressants such as Prozac, which dampens
libido, aids in impulse control and alleviates depression. Polygraph
tests, which are used to monitor behavior, and strict supervision by
law enforcement usually round out the treatment. Some treatment
programs also use physiological techniques to measure sexual arousal,
as a way of testing whether offenders have learned to control their
urges.</TE>
<TE>   One treatment program, in Redding, is considered by many
corrections officials and therapists to be a model for others. The
Sexual Offender Rehabilitative Treatment Program, started in 1991 and
funded by the California Department of Corrections, requires
convicted offenders to attend therapy sessions for three to six hours
a week, depending on the severity of their offenses, after their
release from prison.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, participants take polygraph exams two to three times
a year to help ensure they're not committing more crimes; their
movements are limited--they can't walk past schoolyards or
playgrounds or be around children under 18, even if they're
relatives, for example; and they are monitored by police, who do
random drug tests and pay surprise visits. About 20% of the program's
participants also take antidepressants.</TE>
<TE>   Sexual offenders pay for the program themselves and attend for an
average of four years. Flunking the polygraph exam (questions might
include whether they walked past schoolyards or were around children
for longer than 15 seconds, for instance) can send them back to
prison. They also must admit to their crimes, stop rationalizing
their offenses, and learn anger management techniques. Some
offenders, who are immature or loners, are taught basic social skills
so they're better able to negotiate romantic relationships with
adults.</TE>
<TE>   The approach seems to work, says program director Gerry
Blasingame. Out of about 120 offenders who've completed the program
since 1991, only one or two were later arrested for sex crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Many therapists, prosecutors and corrections officers acknowledge
the usefulness of such programs and are trying to standardize
treatment regimens, in keeping with the methods used in the SORT
program. But even supporters of such programs acknowledge that
success rates vary.</TE>
<TE>   In a 2002 study of 121 priests who finished an intensive program
at St. Luke Institute, for example, only three--or 2.5%--had relapsed
five years later.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Canadian researchers looked at the results of 43
studies from around the world that encompassed several types of
therapeutic strategies. They found that treatment knocked the
recidivism rate down from 17% to about 10%, though those numbers
included all sex offenders, not just child molesters. Since abusers
are rarely caught, however, recidivism rates --as in first-time
charges--might be much higher than these numbers suggest.</TE>
<TE>   But even a 10% recidivism rate is better than nothing, says Bill
Marshall, an expert in sex offenders and professor emeritus of
psychology at Queens University in Kingston, Canada. "That's an
additional eight fellows who don't re-offend out of every 100 who are
treated," he says. "As a result, an average of 16 people are saved
from suffering, and the taxpayers don't have to spend $200,000 to
investigate and prosecute each offender."</TE>
<TE>   Still, people like Rodriguez of the National Center for Missing
and Exploited Children remain unconvinced. "None of these programs
can guarantee that if an individual is released into society, he
won't harm a child," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of therapy for sex offenders acknowledge that some
molesters may repeat their crimes, but contend that locking up all
abusers for the rest of their lives--or sentencing repeat offenders
to death, as Gov. Don Siegelman of Alabama advocates--isn't a
realistic option. Better, they say, to reduce the risk they'll molest
again.</TE>
<TE>   California Prisons Lack System of Treatment</TE>
<TE>   But treatment for all who want it isn't a foregone conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Corrections doesn't have a systematic
program within the prison system to treat sex offenders. Many of them
have addictions or mental illness and, although they may receive
treatment for those problems, the sex abuse itself often is not
treated.</TE>
<TE>   The treatment that does exist is usually granted as a condition of
their parole, after offenders have re-entered society. Even then,
it's no guarantee that all offenders will receive therapy.</TE>
<TE>   A 2000 survey by the Safer Society Foundation, a nonprofit sexual
abuse prevention foundation in Brandon, Vt., found that throughout
California there are 40 treatment programs for sex abusers of all
kinds. Nationwide, the survey said, there are 787.</TE>
<TE>   Therapy supporters say that is hardly enough; after all,
California alone has thousands of convicted sex offenders, and people
in rural areas often have no treatment options of any kind.</TE>
<TE>   But as little help as there is for convicted offenders, it's even
less likely that offenders who have not yet been caught will get
help: Therapists in all 50 states are now required to report sex
crimes to the police, and failure to do so can result in criminal
charges.</TE>
<TE>   A 1991 Johns Hopkins University study revealed that after Maryland
instituted a mandatory reporting law in 1989, the number of
undetected abusers who sought treatment dropped from about seven per
year to zero.</TE>
<TE>   "This may cause some unidentified children to remain at risk,"
says Dr. Fred S. Berlin, associate professor at the Johns Hopkins
School of Medicine in Baltimore and founder of the National Institute
for the Study, Prevention and Treatment of Sexual Trauma. He says he
receives several calls a year from child abusers who want help but
don't want to incriminate themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Most professionals, though they have mixed feelings about
mandatory reporting, don't advocate the elimination of these laws.
Marshall Abrams, a sex offender treatment coordinator in Santa
Barbara, says that if therapists didn't have to report abuse to
police, it would "put children in harm's way."</TE>
<TE>   "In this one instance, we subvert our pledge of confidentiality
for the greater good," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The Redding program sidesteps this legal Catch-22 by offering
convicted sex offenders protection from similar crimes--as long as
they occurred in the past and the abuse is not ongoing.</TE>
<TE>   Its supporters say it creates the open communication necessary for
effective therapy and helps authorities identify and treat victims
they might not know about otherwise. "When these guys come in, we
need to know just how deviant they are," says Blasingame, the program
director. "If they're not honest with us, we can't treat them
properly, and the process is counterproductive."</TE>
<TE>   But this program and others like it deal with convicted offenders,
who may represent only a small fraction of child molesters.</TE>
<TE>   Studies suggest that the majority of molesters escape detection.
For example, only 12% of rapes of girls under 18 are reported to
authorities, according to a 1999 survey conducted by researchers at
the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. And
identifying people who commit incest is even more difficult because
fewer than 5% of children will tell anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Stop It Now!, a nonprofit group in Haydenville, Mass., attempts to
get abusers into treatment. The organization has launched public
awareness campaigns in Vermont, Minnesota and Philadelphia to
encourage sexual offenders to seek help. In its first two years of
operation in Vermont, 51 people called the hotline seeking treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the best ways to protect children is to make sure abusers
have access to good treatment," says Fran Henry, an incest survivor
who founded Stop It Now! "Most sex offenders are unidentified and
living in our midst," she says. "We need to reach these folks when
they're young. If they get the right treatment, they won't turn into
chronic offenders."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Although a broad spectrum of people commit sexual crimes against
children, many of these types of sex offenders have common
characteristics, say therapists and law enforcement officials.</LD>
<LD>   Some pedophiles who become fixated on certain children actually
court them as they would potential lovers--what experts call
"grooming" tactics--and seduce them by showering them with gifts and
attention. They may bide their time for years until they have an
opportunity to make a move, and often insinuate themselves as trusted
family friends with single mothers or vulnerable families.</LD>
<LD>   But even less pathological sex offenders use similar tactics. The
following actions and behaviors may, in fact, be expressions of
genuine warmth. But specialists in this field say they are a possible
warning sign--along with a parent's own gut instinct--of a need to be
vigilant. Among them are:</LD>
<TE>   * Adults who volunteer with children's groups or activities even
if their own kids don't participate.</TE>
<TE>   * Adults who buy expensive gifts--toys, clothes, video games--or
take others' kids to professional sporting events or rock concerts.</TE>
<TE>   * Adults who frequently take the children of others on outings
that will allow them to be alone with them, such as overnight camping
trips or road trips for athletic competitions.</TE>
<TE>   * Adults who do not have children yet show an inordinate awareness
of children's activities or fads, and may have books, videotapes or
games for children in their home.</TE>
<TE>   * Adults who insist on hugging, touching, kissing, tickling,
wrestling or giving children back rubs or excessive physical
attention.</TE>
<TE>   * Adults who who seem too available for baby-sitting or for family
functions.</TE>

<HD>Two Twisting Exercises That Get Right to the Core of the
Matter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN VOIGHT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lately, we've been hearing a lot about core training, but do you
really know what this type of training is? In simple terms, core
training refers to conditioning the large and small muscles of your
abdominals, hips and back.</LD>
<LD>   These muscles need to be strong as well as flexible. When your
torso muscles are strong, they stabilize your spine so your legs and
arms can move with speed, power and agility. Rock climbers, ballet
dancers and gymnasts, for example, rely on core strength to perform a
variety of movements.</LD>
<LD>   The next time you do push-ups, try to concentrate on pulling your
navel in toward the spine and use the muscles in your torso to keep
your back from sagging. As you lower yourself down and push up,
continue to engage your "core" to maintain a straight back. Notice
how your chest, shoulders and arms get a much better workout.</LD>
<TE>   Think of core muscles as the supporting cast in a movie. When the
supporting cast is strong, the main actors can really shine and put
out their best performance. The same is true when it comes to your
body. As you move, there should be a team of multiple muscles
contributing to the effort instead of a few large muscles doing all
the work. Training your body to move this way will help make you less
susceptible to injuries and your overall movements will become much
more efficient.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to training your core, heavy weights and large
movements are not necessary; awareness is. Core conditioning goes
beyond basic ab crunches and back extensions. While these exercises
will make you good at flexing your body forward or bending backward,
they don't address another important aspect of core training called
spinal rotation. This is when your torso muscles are flexible enough
to twist to the right or left with a normal range of motion.</TE>
<TE>   Many people who weight train or play sports have strong but
inflexible core muscles. It happens when muscles are constantly being
used for their strength and not enough attention is given to
stretching them. Golfers and racket sports players often develop
muscular imbalances from repeatedly twisting their body in one
direction. Eventually one side of their torso gets strong and tight
while the other side gets weak and overly flexible.</TE>
<TE>   Consistently stretching your core muscles will give both sides of
your body equal strength and flexibility. Everyday motions, such as
reaching behind your car seat to get something in the back seat, will
become easier.</TE>
<TE>   Practice doing these two twisting poses after you've warmed up.
They are a good start in relieving stress and will improve the
quality of your exercise. As a precaution, do not do twists soon
after surgery or if you suffer from disk problems anywhere in your
spine.</TE>
<TE>   First, begin with the easier version of the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Sit on the floor with both legs extended forward. Bend your right
knee and cross it over your left leg so your foot is close to your
left knee. Bring your left hand behind you and inhale as you lift
your torso upward creating more length to your spine. Exhale as you
revolve your torso to the right and bend the left elbow in front of
the right knee. Keep your forearm vertical, contract your inner
thighs and feel the stretch in your outer hip and across your back.
Inhale again and really lift your chest as you exhale to twist deeper
into the pose. Continue breathing and twisting for 20 to 30 seconds
and repeat on the other side. By changing the position of your legs
you can increase the intensity of the twist. If you felt comfortable
with the first version, then try this next variation.</TE>
<TE>   Sit upright, bend your left leg and bring your foot toward your
buttock. Cross your right leg over your left. Inhale as you extend
your spine placing your right hand behind you and your left hand on
your raised thigh. Exhale as you rotate your torso to the right.
Focus your attention on using the strength of your mid-back to lift
your chest and to pull your shoulders back. Feel the stretch in your
outer hips and across your lower back. Continue to breathe fully for
20 to 30 seconds, trying to twist a little farther on each exhale.
Unwind and repeat on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   You can enhance the effect of these twists by turning your head to
follow the direction of the twist. Be sure to lengthen your neck
before you turn your head, keeping both shoulders level. Often twists
are not held long enough to get their full benefit, so don't rush in
and out of these positions. Stay in the pose long enough to take at
least 12 slow, deep breaths before you unwind to do the other side.
If one side of your body is more difficult to twist than the other,
then give extra time to your tighter side. Never force the stretch.
By doing these twisting poses, you'll discover their
tension-relieving benefits. Soon you'll see how the power of your
"core" can improve your performance and make you feel more relaxed.</TE>

<HD>Straight Outta Compton: A $30,000 Weekend</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Al Martinez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If I had $30,000 to spend and the money was all mine, I wouldn't
think twice about treating 64 friends to a nice weekend in a luxury
hotel. I don't have 64 friends, but if I did, let the good times
roll.</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, if the money were public money and the 64
people were employees and not friends, and the weekend was for
business and not pleasure, I'd figure that something less than a
four-star, oceanfront resort might do.</LD>
<LD>   This would be especially true if I had just emerged from a long
nightmare of fiscal chaos and was being watched by just about
everyone and his brother on how I was spending my money.</LD>
<TE>   I am able to reach this conclusion even though I am not a
financial genius, which is why my wife handles our household budget.
But if I can figure out that spending like a drunken stevedore is a
bad idea under certain conditions, why can't the Compton Unified
School District understand it too?</TE>
<TE>   Must I lend them my wife to teach them frugality?</TE>
<TE>   I am referring here to $30,000 the district spent to house 65 of
its managers for two nights at the end of April at the pricey Surf &amp;
Sand Resort in Laguna Beach. A district spokeswoman said it involved
a civil-rights training session for administrators in the district,
adding somewhat casually that it was no big deal.</TE>
<TE>   I guess when you've got an annual budget of $185.6 million,
spending $30,000 for a nice weekend isn't such a big deal. But when
it's taxpayers' money, that's a cash cow of a different color.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing that happens in Compton really surprises me. Its politics
are the emotional equivalent of a Mad Hatter's tea party. But I did
have some hope that the school district, at least, might be getting
it together. That, alas, doesn't appear to be the case.</TE>
<TE>   Those who follow chaos in education might recall that the district
was taken over by the state eight years ago because it was $20
million in debt, its student test scores were the lowest in
California, its payroll was padded and the schools were in disarray.
The district was in shambles, from the bathrooms to the boardrooms.</TE>
<TE>   The good people of Compton worked hard to change the way things
were being run, and last September the state Department of Education
returned full local control. In addition to raising test scores and
cleaning up the schools, a new superintendent had been hired who
vowed to "do good things for the children."</TE>
<TE>   It appears that good things are also in store for his
administrators, if that weekend in Paradise is any example.</TE>
<TE>   The big-spending superintendent is Jesse Gonzales, who held a
similar job in Las Cruces, N.M. Unfortunately, a few months after he
was appointed here, the New Mexico attorney general's office
announced that it was investigating whether the $390,000 in
"incentives" he received over a 12-year period were legally approved
by the district's school board.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, with a state monitor still watching the Compton
schools and now New Mexico investigators eyeing its former
superintendent, this might not be a good time to lay out a lot of
mazuma at a fancy resort, even if it does offer 100% cotton terry
cloth robes in every room.</TE>
<TE>   Compton school district representative Christine Sanchez said the
administrators met at the Surf &amp; Sand because they received a good
rate and because the district's principals had met there last year
and liked the accommodations. But at a place like that, facing the
ocean in an upscale town, what's not to like?</TE>
<TE>   Breaking down the $30,000, the average room rate for the retreat's
65 participants was $231 a night. According to a rate chart for the
hotel, rooms normally go for from $295 to $375 a night, so it appears
that they did get something of a break.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, there are hotels throughout Southern California
that offer even better prices. The AAA California Tour Book, which I
am happy to lend Supt. Gonzales, lists a dozen hotels and motels up
and down the coast that no doubt would welcome the Compton school
administrators with open arms and maybe even throw in a free
continental breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   If the district administrators can make do without an ocean view,
the Brentwood/Bel-Air Holiday Inn offers rooms from $149 a night,
with rates available for larger groups. You look down, not on the
blue Pacific but on the beautiful 405 Freeway. But you do get a
coffee maker in every room.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez pointed out that all of the food for the 21/2 days the
administrators were at the Surf &amp; Sand was donated by vendors who had
worked for the district for a minimum of three years, so at least
they ate for free.</TE>
<TE>   I've never stayed at the Surf &amp; Sand, even on an expense account,
because the money crunchers here would go crazy if I did. I haven't
stayed there on my own, either, because my own director of finance,
which is to say my wife, would point out that we were only sleeping
there, not buying the place.</TE>
<TE>   It is advice I am passing, at no cost, to the Compton school
district. Remember, the next time you hold a retreat, you're not
buying the hotel, you're only sleeping there. And a view of the
beautiful 405 is absolutely free.</TE>

<HD>Teens Appear to Be Putting Relationships Ahead of Sex</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Guys are the ones who push to have sex for the first time with a
girlfriend," said Brittany Graves, a 16-year-old who lives in Santa
Monica. "But girls can set boundaries."</LD>
<LD>   "Girls are more conservative [about sex]," echoed one 16-year-old
boy, who asked to be anonymous for fear his girlfriend might object
to his comments. "Once you are going out with a girl, it is up to her
how far things go."</LD>
<LD>   "Guys can't have sex without girls, and most girls just aren't
willing," said Taylor Gardner, 18, who lives in West Los Angeles and
attends an all-girls private school. "It is mostly older guys with
younger girls, seniors with freshmen, and the girls just are not
going to put out."</LD>
<TE>   These teenagers' comments about the shifting gender politics of
teen dating reflect what some social scientists see as a growing
trend of adolescent girls setting sexual limits and asserting control
in their relationships with boys. Teen girls' power to restrict
sexual activity may explain an 8% drop over the past decade in the
number of high school boys who reported having had intercourse,
according to sociologists Barbara Risman at North Carolina State
University and Pepper Schwartz at University of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that the reason boys are starting to have sexual
intercourse later is they are beginning their sexual lives with
girlfriends," said Risman, co-chair for the Council for Contemporary
Families, a nonprofit association of family researchers. Such
relationships tend to happen for a number of teen boys when they are
older rather than younger, Risman said. The sociologists reexamined
statistics from a Centers for Disease Control study of 10,000 teens
(ages 15 to 17), analyzing the results by gender. They found that the
rate of teen boys who reported having had intercourse dropped
significantly, from 57% in 1991 to 49% in 1997. High school girls who
reported having had intercourse declined only slightly, from 51% in
1991 to 48% in 1997. Nearly half of girls report that they have had
sex by the end of their 16th year, said Schwartz. The results of the
sociologists' analysis, which also drew on a number of studies on
teen attitudes and behavior, interviews and statistics, appeared in
the premier issue of Contexts, a brand-new quarterly published by the
American Sociological Assn.</TE>
<TE>   What happened in the '90s to explain such changes? "Our
speculation is that the meaning of sex has changed," Risman said.
"Boys now think, as girls do, that sex is something that happens
inside a relationship."</TE>
<TE>   What constitutes a relationship can vary from brief liaisons that
some teenagers call "buddies with benefits," according to Schwartz,
to more enduring unions. In the past, teenage boys were much more
likely to experience first intercourse in a "furtive, casual
encounter with someone from the wrong side of the tracks," Risman
said. According to interviews with teenagers and studies examining
teen attitudes about casual sex, almost no girls and few boys approve
of casual sex, although teen girls still fear being labeled as
"sluts" and teen boys say that casual sex is acceptable more often
for men than for women and they worry less about "being labeled
promiscuous."</TE>
<TE>   Among teens, 71% of boys and 64% of girls report feeling intense
pressure to have sex in a relationship. But when they do, they seem
to be acting more cautiously than in the past. Teen pregnancy fell
14%, and teen abortion rates declined by 31%, Sexually transmitted
diseases also dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Is the decline in sex-related problems due to teenagers having
less sex or are they behaving in more responsible ways? Abstinence
sex education programs, not funded by the federal government until
1998, didn't exist when the data analyzed by the sociologists was
collected. Although teen abstinence may be causing some decline in
sexual intercourse, the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a Washington,
D.C.-based nonprofit organization dedicated to reproductive health
research, calculated that 25% of the reduction in teen pregnancy
could be attributed to abstinence. The remaining drop, its study
found, is attributable to more efficient use of birth control. In a
widely publicized study on abstinence, the pledges succeed in
delaying intercourse for 18 months only "when neither too many nor
too few peers pledge," the authors write. But once pledgers become
sexually active, they usually fail to use contraception.</TE>
<TE>   "The reasons that we have seen a decrease in problems with teen
sexuality have to do with more safe sexual behavior by teens," Risman
said, adding that it is unclear whether this is due to comprehensive
sex education, fear of disease or media reports of AIDS and other
sexually transmitted diseases. "What we do know is that girls are
safer sexual players than boys ... and they are asserting more power
to influence condom use in sexual encounters with boyfriends." In a
focus group of young men identified as condom users, participants
reported that a powerful reason for using a condom was a partner's
request.</TE>
<TE>   "Young women don't always assume they have so much power in these
relationships," said Tina Hoff, vice president of Kaiser Family
Foundation, a nonprofit health care organization that commissioned
last summer's focus group. "But, according to our surveys,
increasingly teens are saying that responsibility for contraception
is something that should be shared." Mostly, this is what many
reproductive health experts call good news statistics. Still,
Schwartz warns, there's a downside.</TE>
<TE>   "Girls may feel more protected by being in relationships than they
actually are, if those relationships are with someone who doesn't
really love and care about them," she said. "Sex in this kind of
relationship may not be what we want for our sons and daughters in
that sex should operate in the context of love and caring. But how
many 16- and 17-year-olds are capable of that?"</TE>

<LD>   A Surgeon's Notes on</LD>
<LD>   an Imperfect Science</LD>
<TE>   By Atul Gawande</TE>
<TE>   Metropolitan Books</TE>
<TE>   288 pages; $24</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When a criminal or terrorist commits a heinous offense, there is
usually a flock of "experts" who appear as if by magic with a flurry
of explanations and pleas for understanding of root causes--political
or psychological. But when a police officer, a social worker or a
doctor makes a mistake, there is a tendency to demonize the errant
party. This may be an appropriate response in the few cases when we
are dealing with a truly bad apple, but in most cases, when we are
dealing with people who did not intend to inflict harm, doesn't it
make more sense to examine what went wrong and why?</TE>
<TE>   Mistakes, medical and surgical, form the leitmotif of Atul
Gawande's "Complications: A Surgeon's Notes on an Imperfect Science."
Gawande, a surgical resident at a Boston hospital, is also a staff
writer on medicine and science for the New Yorker. (Some of the 19
essays that make up this collection first appeared in slightly
different form in that magazine and in Slate.) Writing directly from
his own experience, seamlessly blending the anecdotal and the
analytical, Gawande explores the gray areas--the difficulties,
mysteries and conundrums--that make the practice of medicine so
frustrating, frightening, exacting, exciting and rewarding.</TE>
<TE>   In these essays we meet a woman who can't stop blushing, a man who
can't stop eating, a pregnant woman whose very life is threatened by
uncontrollable nausea and vomiting, a man in severe pain for no
apparent reason. We learn of a once-competent orthopedic surgeon who
refused even to acknowledge, let alone fix, the mistakes he had made
on patients, and an anesthesiologist who helped reduce the rate of
patient mortality twentyfold. We also watch Gawande in a variety of
situations: all but botching an emergency tracheotomy; spotting just
in time a tiny detail that stops him from cutting a patient's bile
duct during a gall bladder operation; and making an intuitive guess
that saves a young woman's life.</TE>
<TE>   The essays are arranged in three sections. In the first section,
"Fallibility," Gawande looks at the kinds of mistakes doctors make,
the reasons they make them and some of the ways that have been found
of reducing errors to a minimum. Lawsuits, he argues convincingly,
are "a remarkably ineffective remedy" because the threat of them
prevents doctors from publicly acknowledging their mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "Mystery," the second section, examines some areas in which
science and medicine do not yet have all the answers, including pain
that seems to have no direct bodily cause and nausea that doesn't
respond to treatment. And in the final section, Gawande shows us the
extent to which "Uncertainty" remains a part of the process of
diagnosis and treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The decisiveness of surgeons was one of the things that attracted
Gawande to this field: "There is a saying about surgeons, meant as a
reproof: 'Sometimes wrong; never in doubt.' But this seemed to me
their strength." But such decisiveness comes from years of practice,
and no aspiring surgical resident, however gifted, has this kind of
confidence or skill. Gawande's account of his own first attempt at
inserting an intravenous line into a patient's chest captures how
scary and awkward these first steps can be. The size of the needle
alarmed even him: "I couldn't believe I was sticking it into
someone's chest."</TE>
<TE>   Yet it is necessary for young surgeons to learn their trade, even
at the cost of some mistakes. Far less excusable are the mistakes
that are made "When Good Doctors Go Bad," the subject of another
chapter that tells the stories of a surgeon who became dangerous and
a psychiatrist who developed a program for treating this kind of
pathological behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, Gawande examines the impact of two relatively recent
changes in the way medicine is practiced: the steep decline in the
percentage of autopsies that are performed and the shift in the
primary responsibility for medical decision-making from the doctor to
the patient. Despite doctors' confidence in their new diagnostic
imaging machines and other tools, old-fashioned autopsies can still
turn up surprising results. And although it may be good that patients
and their families have the final say about treatment, there are
times when patients have refused life-saving treatments simply
because they were debilitated, panicked, confused and unable to
understand what was being offered them.</TE>
<TE>   Although Gawande's overall view of his profession is consistent,
balanced and constructive, the reader may detect a gradual shift in
emphasis and attitude. At the outset, discussing the routine slip-ups
caused by inexperience, fatigue, tension or inattention, he extols
the value of sheer repetition: A good surgeon, he suggests, should
aspire to the perfection of a super-efficient machine. He also
bestows high praise on programs and systems that minimize the
potential for errors. In the book's latter part, he evinces a growing
respect for the less mechanical, more human qualities of empathy,
tact and sometimes even intuition. But whether he is describing a
procedure, analyzing a problem or evoking an emotion, Gawande's sharp
eye, crisp prose and insightful understanding make his book as
enjoyable as it is edifying.</TE>

<LD>How many of you working stiffs, like me, stay freeze-dried to your
office seats each day while dreaming of the Great Escape? You know,
handing back the 9-to-5 job, thank you, selling the house, cashing in
the 401(k) and risking that grand global adventure?</LD>
<LD>   If you're weak-willed like me (my wife would
say--aaaack!--responsible), you submerge your wanderlust by reading
travelogues and adventure novels while slouching off each summer on a
three-week, over-in-a-heartbeat international vacation.</LD>
<LD>   I've never had the chutzpah to utter those famous Johnny Paycheck
lyrics, "Take this job and," well, you know.</LD>
<TE>   Then, the other day, I met someone who did just that.</TE>
<TE>   I was wolfing down lunch at my desk when a colleague roused me
from my workaday routine. "A man at the door wants to talk to a
reporter," she whispered. "He says he's riding his bicycle around the
world."</TE>
<TE>   I shook hands with Richard Gregg. Within minutes I realized I was
standing face to face with the man who personified my longings for
emotional and physical flight. In 1990, this soft-spoken adventurer
walked away from a dreary engineering job in his native England to
begin a (so far) 12-year odyssey, pedaling 25,000 miles across
Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, Oceania and, now, the Americas.</TE>
<TE>   Taking his own pictures, often lingering to capture the spirit and
pace of a city, village or crossroads before cycling on, Gregg
chronicles his travels on his Web site, www.worldcycle.org.</TE>
<TE>   As he describes his journey in one of his reports, he has "dealt
with Tibetan wolfhounds, British Telecom, Egyptian camels, Chinese
shopkeepers, Indian paperwork, Sudanese spies, Tanzanian baboons,
Vietnamese money-changers, salmonella typhoid, Italian drivers,
Pakistani amoebae, drunk Ugandan gun-waving check-post-guards and
Kenyan mosquitoes, and survived, albeit with varying levels of
success."</TE>
<TE>   Now here he was in San Francisco, talking of youth hostel
accommodations, biking this city's killer hills, and his recent
arrival in the Port of Oakland by way of container ship from Fiji.</TE>
<TE>   And a thought occurred: If I can't join him, perhaps I can at
least host him. After a call to my wife ("Honey, can I bring home a
perfect stranger to skulk our flat each night as we sleep?"), I
invited Gregg and his fully panniered, 125-pound packhorse of a
touring bike to stay with us for a week or so.</TE>
<TE>   Captivated by his easygoing style and quirky Inspector Clouseau
mannerisms, and the way he feigned an American accent in response to
hokey TV ads, I gave Gregg the keys to our place and set about trying
to learn what I could from this wanderer about life on the other side
of the cubicle.</TE>
<TE>   What I wanted to know was this: Why do some people choose to live
out their lives within a few miles of their birthplace while others
clamor to escape their roots in an evolving effort to reinvent
themselves? And do those like Gregg, who have refined the art of
travel into something of a slacker lifestyle, envy anything about
those of us who remain rooted?</TE>
<TE>   Gregg, who refers to himself as ICBM, or Inter-Continental Bicycle
Man, cycles for no cause other than simple adventure. He prefers to
steer clear of politics except where necessary, instead weaving tales
of adventure and friendships made along the way.</TE>
<TE>   He dreamed of travel even as a kid. "When I was 8 years old I had
to copy an encyclopedia picture of the Taj Mahal at school," he
writes. "I made up my mind to go to see it for myself. My 7-year-old
sister, at about the same time, showed me a Japanese pen pal's
picture postcard of Mt. Fuji. I asked her about it, and she said it
was an exploding mountain. I would definitely go and see that, I
decided."</TE>
<TE>   Japan continues to corner his imagination. In the course of his
bicycle journey, Gregg met his Japanese wife, Haruyo, in a bus
station cafe in Laos.</TE>
<TE>   At her request, he's trying to wrap up his global circumnavigation
within the next year and plans to ride across Canada, the U.S. and
South America. Then it's back to Japan--where he has already spent
more than two years teaching English--to settle down with his new
wife and, perhaps, raise a family.</TE>
<TE>   He plans to one day write a book describing the unfettered freedom
of a make-it-up-as-you-go itinerary that includes tracking the Nile
upstream to Aswan, where two British cycling mates used tennis
rackets to deflect the rocks hurled by mischievous Egyptian boys.</TE>
<TE>   He has pedaled through the Sudan and Uganda and into Kenya, down
the Great Rift Valley, to Nairobi and Mombasa. According to Gregg's
online bio, he's cycled through India and Pakistan and ridden across
China from Tibet to Beijing, cranking over the Himalayan range by the
Nepal-Tibet route, where, on downhill jaunts, bees struck his bike
helmet like bullets. He also had an extended yearlong break because
of a torn ligament in his knee sustained when he stepped into an
opening in the deck of a houseboat in Kashmir, India.</TE>
<TE>   He was in Hong Kong for the British hand over of power to China.
He spun his cranks through Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Malaysia,
clear to Singapore, across the bleak heartland of Australia, where
wise guys in a passing truck threw a beer bottle under his tires.</TE>
<TE>   In Fiji, he said, when he told a policeman his name, the officer
observed: "Oh, like Richard the Lionhearted."</TE>
<TE>   Gregg didn't relish the comparison with the ancient marauder.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, it's part of history," the officer said. "We used to eat
people around these parts. And nobody here wants to talk much about
that either."</TE>
<TE>   Gregg frequently gives slide shows at nursing homes. I accompanied
him to a local home where he offered a dozen "rogue grannies" a
glimpse into his travel-crazed psyche.</TE>
<TE>   Travel means compromise, and even Gregg occasionally rues the path
not taken, the one that would have provided him with a home, a career
and a sense of place in society. Instead he remains an outsider,
never knowing what to expect except that few things worth having come
easily.</TE>
<TE>   When residents cooed over his slide of a brilliant orange Kashmir
sunset, he described how the scene was followed by sporadic automatic
gunfire that lasted all night.</TE>
<TE>   And so my friend has made his choice, for now, to leave his new
wife at home and continue his adventures. Rooted to my routine, I
took Gregg along on one of my own escapades: to San Quentin for a
story I was reporting. As I interviewed inmates in the prison yard,
Gregg struck up a conversation with a gaggle of L.A. gang members.</TE>
<TE>   Charmed by his insights, they asked about English slang and
British prisons. In the end, they paid him the highest in street
compliments. "Yo, man," one told him, "if we were on the outside,
we'd put you in our car."</TE>
<TE>   After we went our separate ways, I tried to derive some meaning
from our encounter: Did Gregg appear as some cosmic sign that I
should follow my instincts and hit the road? Would I be happier that
way?</TE>
<TE>   But as I enter my mid-40s, for good or bad, I've already carved
out a rock-solid self-definition. And truth be told, I don't think
I'll ever know whether those who strike out far, far from home are
any happier than those who don't. But I do know this: I didn't envy
Gregg as he trundled off toward San Jose, unsure where he would sleep
that night.</TE>
<TE>   As I drove to work, anticipating a new project, deciding whether I
would travel to Spain or Thailand on vacation this year, I knew what
was in store for me that day, and that stability suddenly felt good.</TE>
<TE>   My time with Gregg has also made me appreciate the simpler
accommodations of a stationary life: Unlike my guest, I can always
count on relatively clean water right from the tap, paved roads on
which to ride my bike and a warm, bug-free bed to climb into each
night.</TE>
<TE>   And my work, I've decided, provides me with as many varied
experiences as anyone could hope to have in one place. I guess that
cliche could work as a title for Gregg's upcoming book and for my
life as well: "Wherever you go, well, there you are."</TE>

<HD>Writer-Philosopher Confronts the Big Questions</HD>
<DH>Michael Frayn wrestles with the hows and whys of life that
resist clear answers, but he also revels in the possibilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL J. YBARRA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>When Michael Frayn arrived at Emmanuel College at Cambridge
University in the mid-1950s, Ludwig Wittgenstein had been dead for a
few years, but the philosophy giant's ghost still dominated the
endless campus debates over the nature of knowledge.</LD>
<LD>   Frayn, too, soon fell under Wittgenstein's spell ("What we cannot
speak about we must pass over in silence"), although his tutor turned
out to be one of the rare anti-Wittgensteins on campus, which made
for some lively tutorials.</LD>
<LD>   "We'd argue ferociously for an hour and then adjourn for lunch and
argue ferociously some more and then return to his rooms and argue
until dinner," Frayn recalls. "It was a wonderful way to learn
philosophy. I still think that Wittgenstein is one of the great
philosophers, and the 'Philosophical Investigations' one of the great
works. He suggested that philosophy was not a body of dogma but a way
of thinking about things."</LD>
<TE>   "Investigations" would be a pretty good title for the collected
works of Frayn, the British playwright and author whose brainy,
intricate texts range from the Broadway success of "Copenhagen"
(about nuclear physics and human motivation) to the comic novel
"Headlong" (about a museum curator's pursuit of a painting that may
or may not be a missing masterpiece).</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of philosophical questions in life," says Frayn,
who was in San Francisco recently on a tour for his latest book,
"Spies" (Metropolitan), "and you can't not face them in any
department of life. They can't help but come into your writing."</TE>
<TE>   Frayn writes about mysteries that resist resolution, inquiries
that change the inquirer and lead into labyrinths of possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   His new novel is no exception. A thin volume about one summer in a
young boy's life, the book is an obsessive recollection of a time and
place where nothing much really happens, yet everything turns out to
have a momentous significance. The book is framed around the elderly
Stephen Wheatley, who returns to his boyhood neighborhood and tries
to untangle his knotted memories of that long ago period.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen was a shy boy whose best (only) friend was Keith Hayward,
a neighbor who went to a better school, lived in a better house and
had--so it seemed--better parents. One day, Keith blurts out that his
mother is a German spy. The boys spy on Mrs. Hayward and soon
discover that she indeed does have a secret, which sets in motion a
series of events that will haunt Stephen for the rest of his life.</TE>
<TE>   "Just by looking at things I shouldn't have looked at I've changed
them," the narrator says (a line that will ring a bell for anyone
familiar with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle elucidated in
"Copenhagen").</TE>
<TE>   In Proust, a cookie evokes endless memories; in Frayn, a flower
provokes unanswerable questions. A tub of geraniums, for example,
triggers an epistemological reflection in the young narrator. "I'm
not sure," he says, "now the question's been raised, if I really
understand even what it means to understand something."</TE>
<TE>   Critics, at least, seem to understand the book. "Bernard Shaw
couldn't do it, Henry James couldn't do it," gushed John Updike in
the New Yorker, "but the ingenious English author Michael Frayn does
do it: write novels and plays with equal success."</TE>
<TE>   In Britain, "Spies" has been talked up as a contender for the
Booker Prize, the kingdom's most revered literary award. And in this
country, the novel could finally win Frayn the same ardent fans that
his plays have attracted.</TE>
<TE>   "Frayn manages to convey delicate shadings of feeling ... while
moving the story along with a freight train's dispatch," wrote Dan
Cryer in Newsday. "Tautly, elegantly constructed, the novel moves
swiftly toward not one surprise but two."</TE>
<TE>   (The only significant dissenter was New York Times book critic
Michiko Kakutani, who called "Spies" "a curious lapse in craft from
this usually agile and artful storyteller.")</TE>
<TE>   Frayn says he had been thinking about the idea for the book for 25
years. During the war years, Frayn was friendly with a boy who took
for granted all the advantages that Frayn envied, a boy so sure of
his place in the world that nothing was more natural than telling his
friend what to do.</TE>
<TE>   "He seemed to have everything," Frayn recalls. "Nice house, nice
mother, terrifying father. Great toys. My toys were hopeless. He had
the power of imagination. I had no imagination."</TE>
<TE>   The idea didn't go anywhere for years until Frayn remembered one
of their games. "I thought," he says, "of something he said once: 'My
mother is a German spy.' I think we followed her about for a couple
of hours and gave up. What if we didn't? What would we find out about
her life?"</TE>
<TE>   Remembering what it was like to be a boy turned out to be almost
as hard for Frayn as researching quantum mechanics for "Copenhagen."
"I found it very difficult to know what it was like to be a child at
any particular age," Frayn says. "It took a surprisingly long time."</TE>
<TE>   Frayn's own life started in the London suburbs, where his father
was an asbestos salesman. "It wasn't a very bookish home," he says.
After graduating, Frayn was drafted and trained as a Russian
translator (he later won raves for his translation of Chekhov) before
going to Cambridge on a scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   Then he went to the Manchester Guardian newspaper, where he was a
reporter and columnist before moving to the London Observer, where he
began writing novels on the side. Frayn left journalism in 1968 to
write novels full time (although he has continued to work as a
journalist now and then).</TE>
<TE>   Frayn is 68, thin, with a fringe of wispy white hair, and a face
as well creased as an old map. He lives in Regent's Park, London,
with his second wife, Claire Tomalin, a biographer of, among others,
Jane Austen. He has three grown daughters from his first marriage. He
keeps an office within walking distance from home.</TE>
<TE>   "Claire works at home," he says. "That's why I go around the
corner. When we finish writing, we show each book to the other. It's
difficult to express reservations tactfully, but we've managed to
survive so far."</TE>
<TE>   For years Frayn's books earned more praise than sales. "The Tin
Men," Frayn's first novel, came out in 1965 and won the Somerset
Maugham award, but he was later dropped by his publisher. In 1982,
his play "Noises Off" (a comedy about the making of a farce) was a
big hit (as was its recent Broadway revival).</TE>
<TE>   Then came "Copenhagen," in 1999, which was an unlikely smash,
considering it was about a real but somewhat mysterious meeting
between two giants of nuclear physics in a Danish city during World
War II. The controversy over what exactly happened at the meeting
between Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg (and why the Nazis never
developed an atomic bomb) was given new life by the success of the
play, which won a Tony Award on Broadway in 2000 and toured the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The play triggered at least half a dozen conferences in which
historians and physicists argued over the scientific and moral issues
dramatized by Frayn--and also led earlier this year to the Bohr
family opening its archives and releasing an unsent letter from Bohr
to Heisenberg, which kicked up the dust yet again.</TE>
<TE>   Frayn doesn't think the letter-- indicating that Heisenberg was
working zealously on building a bomb--fundamentally alters the truth
of the play, which, after all, is about the ghosts of the characters
debating what transpired.</TE>
<TE>   "I would think the argument will go on until the end of time," he
says. "It's very difficult to have absolute knowledge. The evidence
for everything is extremely confused and contradictory."</TE>
<TE>   Confusion and contradiction suffuse much of what Frayn writes.</TE>
<TE>   "In a play, it's not natural to know what's going on in someone's
head," he says. "Plays are more like life than novels. The difficulty
is knowing why people do what they do. A play is a meeting of minds,
including the audience. It's not some people standing on stage saying
the author's lines. It's two people trying to figure out what they're
doing. It can only succeed if the audience lets it succeed. Novels
are not quite such a delicate business. It's not a communal activity.
With a book it can succeed with this person or that."</TE>
<TE>   After 10 novels and 13 plays, which does Frayn prefer? "I find
them equally demanding," he says. Currently, Frayn says, he is
working on another play, although he declines to say more. "You can't
talk about a work in progress," he says. "I've got hundreds and
hundreds of ideas that haven't come to fruition."</TE>
<TE>   One of his ideas has been both a play and a novel, "Now You Know."</TE>
<TE>   "I wrote it as a play," he says. "It didn't work. What's wrong? I
need to know what goes on in their heads. It's a novel, so I
published it as a book.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I thought, now that I know what's going on in their heads I
can write it as a play, which I did. It has never been a great
success as either."</TE>

<LD>Hebrew</LD>
<LD>   Can you imagine having to invent 4,000 new words? That is what
Eliezer Ben-Yehuda had to do in 1881 when he began to write the first
modern Hebrew dictionary.</LD>
<LD>   Today Hebrew is spoken by millions of Jewish people in Israel and
around the world, but before 1881, it was only a written language.
Nobody spoke it. People read Hebrew in the Jewish Bible. There were
no words for "ice cream" or "car" because these things did not exist
when the Jewish Bible was written.</LD>
<TE>   It was hard for Ben-Yehuda to convince people that a spoken
language was needed. Jewish people liked speaking the languages they
already knew, such as Russian and Yiddish. Nobody believed that
Ben-Yehuda would succeed. He wanted to show Jews everywhere why it
was important for them to have one national language.</TE>
<TE>   In order to teach his family Hebrew, Ben-Yehuda made his wife and
children speak the language, even though at first none of them knew a
single word. His son became the first Hebrew-speaking child in the
world. Unfortunately, Ben-Yehuda died before finishing the
dictionary, but his family completed it for him.</TE>
<TE>   Hebrew characters look different from those in English. Sometimes
people think that a language is strange if the letters are not likes
theirs, but, that is not true. People have many ways of
communicating, so it is important to respect all kinds of languages.
To learn more and see examples of the Hebrew language, visit the
museum or its Web site at motlc.Wiesenthal.com. Call (310) 772-2502

<LD>   "That is incorrect," Mrs. Perez said. Jasmyn pouted and plopped
back down in her seat.</LD>
<LD>   Jasmyn and Tali were chosen to compete in Friday's spelling bee.
This year's winners would receive a pizza party for their class.</LD>
<TE>   It was Tali's turn. "Invisible, I-N-V-I-S-I-B-L-E." The letters
rolled off the tip of her tongue with confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "Correct!" Mrs. Perez said approvingly.</TE>
<TE>   Jasmyn was daydreaming. She didn't get it. What was so special
about her new baby sister?</TE>
<TE>   It's not like she could spell. She couldn't even talk. But

<TE>   "Did you say something, Jasmyn?" Mrs. Perez asked. "Would you care
to share?"</TE>
<TE>   "Uh--" Jasmyn blushed. Her face turned a blotchy red and orange.
The class burst into laughter, and her face felt hot.</TE>
<TE>   Jasmyn could hardly wait for the bus ride home. Tali saved her a
window seat at the back of the bus. It was easy spotting Grandma in
her banana-yellow sweater. Jasmyn was grandma's girl.</TE>

<HD>A Woman's Place</HD>
<DH>The resignation of Karen Hughes, the White House's most
influential female advisor, has set off a debate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was Karen Hughes who--shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attack--wrote into President Bush's address to a shaken nation that
Americans should "live your lives and hug your children."</LD>
<LD>   But when the most powerful woman to have worked in the White House
announced recently that she wanted to do just that--live her life,
hug her kid more--it set off a cacophony of interpretation and
reinterpretation.</LD>
<LD>   This seemed fitting treatment for Hughes, the chief spinner at the
White House, a place where nothing is what it seems. Even the most
banal information is packaged to carry a White House message, so what
is said is often suspect, and reading between the lines is a favorite
Washington pastime.</LD>
<TE>   But then along comes Hughes with a decision that apparently is
precisely what she says it is: Her husband and teenage son were
"homesick," so this summer the family is heading back to Texas.
Hughes will continue her unique work for Bush--as a confidant,
advisor and speechwriter--but she will no longer serve constantly at
his side.</TE>
<TE>   A few editorials lauded Hughes' family-centric decision. Mostly,
Washington insiders wondered if there wasn't some back story--a West
Wing intrigue that hadn't emerged. A Newsweek columnist admonished
Hughes, who has worked for Bush through multiple campaigns since
1994, for leaving in wartime: "When private life trumps public
service," the left-leaning columnist wrote, "it's a sure sign that
the post-September 11 call to 'duty' is over. Too bad someone forgot
to tell the soldiers and their families."</TE>
<TE>   But outside the Beltway the discussion ranged beyond palace
intrigue or mundane questions of whether women could balance career
and family life.</TE>
<TE>   This was one of the most powerful unelected women in the United
States, and therefore the world, and her willingness to redefine her
job became a new benchmark for how much a successful woman could ask
of her boss and still maintain her power.</TE>
<TE>   What stunned Ellen Galinsky, president and co-founder of the
Manhattan-based nonprofit Families and Work Institute, was that so
many people simply concluded Hughes had quit working.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is Karen is going to continue working, just in a
different location for the president," Galinsky said. "We keep
pushing people back into the old boxes--work or family, all or
nothing. But none of us really fit that anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Galinsky and other experts observed that the arc of many
successful women's careers is not predictable--that teenagers test
them more often than babies do; that unhappy spouses derail more jobs
than demanding bosses or children; that ultimately, most women in
these positions manage to wend their way through family/work
obstacles--just not always smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time there is someone this visible who makes such a
decision it's a big stir mostly because people still don't trust that
women can stay in these positions," said Kay Koplovitz, founder of
the USA Network and author of the new book "Bold Women, Big Ideas:
Learning to Play the High Risk Entrepreneurial Game." "But trust me,
we will hear more from Karen. She's very strong, so don't be
surprised if she does something else important."</TE>
<TE>   For now, Hughes has said she will be returning regularly to
Washington to advise the president and will be in touch constantly by
phone. Insiders speculate she will also get a contract with the
Republican National Committee to start on Bush's reelection campaign
and earn money giving speeches.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Matalin, an advisor to Vice President Dick Cheney, does not
see Hughes' new life as some "big compromise," but rather as the
mother of all work-at-home situations: She gets to continue doing her
favorite parts of her job, eliminate what bores her and lead a normal
life with her husband and son.</TE>
<TE>   "Karen didn't care about the power and access thing that is so big
in the Washington culture," Matalin said. "The only thing she liked
about her job was [writing] the speeches, the big projects and
advising [Bush]. She'll keep doing all that. What she didn't like was
all the Kabuki dancing in the White House, all of which ate away at
her time with her family. And that's over."</TE>
<TE>   In the last several months friends and associates could see Hughes
was struggling--with long hours counseling a president at war and
with a family that was anything but settled. She had confided to
people who weren't even that close to her that her teenage son was
angry at her about the move. Unlike the affairs of war and peace,
this was a problem Hughes could solve in an instant--and did, on
April 21 when she announced she was leaving this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Throughout my career I have tried to prioritize my family while I
have a career," Hughes, 45, told reporters at a White House press
briefing that day. "I've prided myself that this is a family-friendly
White House, and I think this is a family-friendly decision."</TE>
<TE>   Bush gave her his blessing saying, "Karen Hughes will be changing
her address, but she will still be in my inner circle."</TE>
<TE>   Whether Hughes' decision to give up a prestigious title in the
interest of her family represents some seismic cultural trend is
debatable. But it certainly reveals something about Hughes herself, a
loyal and hard-driving professional who set a course for her family
that did not altogether pan out.</TE>
<TE>   When the Hugheses moved to Washington in January 2001, they tried
to arrange their lives appropriately: They rented a house in McLean,
Va., where other Republicans were relocating. They decided Hughes'
husband, Jerry, a semi-retired Austin attorney, would not work. And
they enrolled Robert, 15, in a private school in northwest
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The Hugheses chose the St. Alban's School instead of a nearby
public school, largely at the behest of Josh Bolten, a key Bush
advisor who had gone there and then to Yale University, like the
president and his father before him.</TE>
<TE>   A handwritten letter from Bush helped secure a midyear spot in
eighth grade for Robert. And no one could remember his mother--a
great admirer of the Bush family--being as happy as she was the day
Robert was accepted.</TE>
<TE>   In the ultimate display of domestic role reversal, Jerry Hughes
set out to do it all for the family. With his wife off to work at 7
each morning, it was Jerry, now 63, who had to learn the rush-hour
shortcuts to the school on the grounds of Washington's National
Cathedral. It was he who had the challenge of figuring out where to
buy dog food in bulk for Breeze, their golden retriever, of shopping
around for a new church, of spending his days, as he said during an
interview last year, "trying to do a little wash, and have a nice
meal ready."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last year, however, the Hugheses had to rethink some of
their earlier decisions. They ended up moving--this time to a house
closer to Robert's school. And St. Alban's, in fact, turned out to be
a lot more academically ambitious and socially sophisticated than the
suburban Austin public high school where Robert would have gone--and
will be going next fall.</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly [Robert] is catapulted into the world of St. Alban's,
which I would guess for him would be like going to Mars," Mark
McKinnon, the Bush media advisor and close friend of Karen Hughes,
told the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   Like a lot of the White House working parents, Hughes tried to
involve her family as much as is possible in her work. More than
once, when she had to spend a working weekend with Bush at Camp
David, the president invited Jerry and Robert also. Her great
innovation to an impossible schedule was to attempt to leave
early--at 5:30 p.m. on Wednesdays to get to her son's ballgames.
Often, though, travel abroad and crisis in the White House made that
impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Other administration spouses said that during their regular
post-Sept. 11 get-togethers, Jerry Hughes did not seem content with
the family's new life. And so with her husband unhappy and her son
eager to return to public school in Texas, Hughes began weighing how
important her job was to her, according to friends.</TE>
<TE>   "She felt torn because of her responsibility and genuine
friendship with the president," said Matalin, who played the
"girlfriend" role, listening over the last months as Hughes worked
out her angst over moving back to Texas. "She knows she plays a role
larger than her title decries and one that is totally unique to
Bush."</TE>
<TE>   But as a mother of a teenager a few years away from college,
Hughes recognized that role, too, was unique and came with equally
important responsibilities: "Her husband did the Mr. Mom thing well,
but there is only one mother in every family," Matalin said. "And
Karen is talented enough that she could make a decision to enhance
her life so that nobody loses."</TE>
<TE>   As she departs the hothouse on Pennsylvania Avenue there are other
high-profile mothers there, who continue to blend work and family
life.</TE>
<TE>   Matalin, Margaret Spelling (the domestic policy chief), Lezlee
Westine (White House director of public liaison) and others are
working the endless day, rolling from crisis to crisis, and
attempting to be creative about scheduling their priorities. Matalin
frequently brings daughters Matty, 6, and Emma, 4, into the office.
Spelling, a mother of two girls, 15 and 10, from Texas, and Westine,
a single mother of a 9-year-old girl from California, took their
daughters to an 'N Sync concert last month, and talked business while
the girls rocked.</TE>
<TE>   Spelling has also faced similar challenges to Hughes' over the
last year after uprooting her children and a second husband from
Texas to live in the nation's capital.</TE>
<TE>   However, instead of moving her family mid-school year, Spelling
commuted every other weekend to Texas until her daughters, who were
living with their father, finished in June. That meant for six months
she left the White House for Texas early on alternate Fridays and
returned late the following Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   It was hard on the family, she says, but during the first months
of the administration Spelling, who was then living with her sister
in Alexandria, Va., was able to immerse herself in a new job without
worrying about her children's adjustments. Spelling also used spare
hours--the few there were--to check out neighborhoods and school
districts.</TE>
<TE>   Finally in June, her daughters moved in with her in a rented house
near her sister and enrolled in Fairfax County public schools in
September. Spelling also remarried over the summer. Her new husband,
Robert Spelling, moved up from Texas and opened a branch of his
Austin law firm.</TE>
<TE>   Like Hughes, Spelling had to tweak some of her early decisions:
She recently transferred her 15-year-old, who was in the same class
as Robert Hughes in Austin, from a public to parochial school in
Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that is so weird about teenagers," said Spelling, who
has been Bush's chief advisor on education policy, "is that they're
not darn happy about much of anything. You just have to deal with
it."</TE>
<TE>   She has found it helpful having a critical mass of working mothers
around the White House who, like her, make a habit of leaving when
they need to for their families.</TE>
<TE>   "I give my good 12 to 13 hours a day and get up and just go,"
Spelling said. "You get in the fortress mentality so you work
straight through, eat a sandwich at your desk, and then leave. This
is not graduate school and we're not students who can stay there all
night. We have families."</TE>
<TE>   There is no doubt in Spelling's mind that ultimately she and many
Texans in the Bush's administration--such as Bush's senior political
advisor Karl Rove (whose wife quit her job in D.C. to devote her time
to the family) and Federal Emergency Management Agency head Joe
Albaugh--will gather up their families and follow Hughes back home
when their time is up serving this president.</TE>
<TE>   But in the meantime, Spelling, for one, has convinced her family
that their stay in the capital is a great adventure as well as a
privilege. She has organized several weekend trips--horseback riding
on the battlefield at Gettysburg and touring Williamsburg; the
Spelling girls have attended concerts at the Kennedy Center and met
celebrities such as Olympic champion skater Sarah Hughes at the White
House.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to think of this as our year in Provence," Spelling
said, "and make the most of it."</TE>

<HD>Key Enron Auditor to Take Stand</HD>
<DH>Profile: Former Andersen partner David Duncan was a rising
star. Now he and the firm will give conflicting accounts of motives
and events.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Young and ambitious, David Duncan put in long hours as the chief
Arthur Andersen executive overseeing audits of Enron Corp. But he
felt such a bond with his employer that he still devoted time to
recruiting promising college students to join the firm, pointing out
its influence and prestige.</LD>
<LD>   The accountant, a 20-year Andersen veteran, intends to cast the
firm in a much different light this week, when he is expected to tell
a federal jury that top Andersen officials signed off on his effort
to destroy Enron-related records to hamper a Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry in October. Duncan--who was dismissed from
Andersen in January--has already pleaded guilty to obstruction of
justice and is cooperating in the government's broader Enron probe.</LD>
<LD>   His testimony is likely to be the U.S. Justice Department's most
powerful weapon in seeking to convict Andersen of obstruction, an
outcome that could prompt regulators to bar the firm from auditing
public companies and could deliver a death blow. But lawyers for
Andersen plan to blunt the effect of Duncan's appearance by saying
that he has provided differing accounts of his motives and that he
cooperated with prosecutors not because he committed a crime but
because he bended under government pressure.</LD>
<TE>   Whatever the outcome, Duncan's journey through the courts will be
just beginning. Duncan can expect to spend much of the next year or
so sitting through interviews with FBI agents and other
investigators, providing a road map to Enron's finances and laying
the groundwork for other potential Enron-related prosecutions.
Moreover, he has been named in dozens of lawsuits filed by Enron
shareholders and employees.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Duncan is at the beginning of a very long road," his
attorney, Barry Flynn, said last week.</TE>
<TE>   People close to Duncan say he doesn't know what he will do after
his legal odyssey concludes. His agreement to plead guilty probably
will result in the termination of his accounting license and make it
harder for him to find work again.</TE>
<TE>   "He won't be writing a book," one person said. Any attempt to sell
his story probably would be prohibited under his cooperation
agreement with the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Until this year, Duncan's future appeared to be all but assured at
Andersen. With his profile within Andersen's Houston office steadily
rising, he was named lead partner overseeing audits of Enron in 1997,
eventually earning an estimated $1 million a year. Last year,
Andersen's chief executive asked him to serve on the chairman's
advisory council, a group of about 20 partners.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's fees from Enron amounted to about $1 million a week.
The firm rewarded Duncan last year with a hefty increase in his
partnership stake, raising his annual pay by an estimated $150,000,
according to testimony last week. In October he was one of several
partners featured in a promotional video shown at an Andersen
partners meeting in New Orleans--about two weeks before he initiated
a campaign to shred Enron-related documents.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan has spent almost his entire professional life at Andersen,
joining the firm after graduating from Texas A&amp;M University. He is
married with three children and lives in an upscale Houston suburb.</TE>
<TE>   James Benjamin, the head of the university's accounting
department, where Duncan sits on an advisory council, said his peers
consider him "engaging and caring."</TE>
<TE>   But Andersen executives in court last week portrayed him as a sort
of accounting cowboy.</TE>
<TE>   Benjamin Neuhausen, a partner and veteran member of the firm's
internal accounting-standards team, said Duncan "pushed to excess" in
interpreting the rules and typically sided with Enron against his own
firm's experts when disputes arose.</TE>
<TE>   In one instance last year, Duncan's team backed a plan allowing
Enron to keep hundreds of millions of dollars in losses from four
so-called "special-purpose entities," known as the Raptors, off
Enron's books, according to court testimony. Duncan proposed to let
Enron account for the entities' financial results together, allowing
profits from two stronger Raptors to cover losses from the two weaker
ones, testified Benjamin Neuhausen, of Andersen's Professional
Standards Group.</TE>
<TE>   Neuhausen testified that accounting experts in his division told
Duncan the technique didn't comply with standards requiring such
entities to report separately. Duncan's team ultimately ignored the
advice.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, after senior Andersen officials reexamined how Enron
accounted for the Raptors, they determined the accounting-standards
team had been correct and advised Enron to restate its financial
results. On Oct. 16, Enron announced it would take a $1-billion
charge, much of it arising from the Raptors' losses, an event that
contributed to its financial meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   James Hecker, a partner in the firm's Houston office, said Duncan
and other members of the team handling Enron sometimes appeared too
close to the energy-trading giant they were auditing, often traveling
to golf tournaments and ski outings with Enron executives.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Duncan--whose team members kept their own offices at Enron
headquarters--developed relationships at Enron's highest levels.</TE>
<TE>   He assisted Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay with charitable efforts
and United Way campaigns, once helping Lay organize a bid to get into
the Guinness Book of World Records by trying to form the largest-ever
human rainbow: 2,000 people wearing colorful T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, he is persona non grata at both Enron and Andersen.
In announcing Duncan's dismissal in January, Andersen said, "It
should be perfectly clear that Andersen will not tolerate unethical
behavior, gross errors in judgment or willful violation of our
policies."</TE>
<TE>   Months later, however, as it became clear that Duncan might cut a
deal with the Justice Department, Andersen's attorneys began
suggesting that Duncan merely made a mistake amid confusion over what
the firm now describes as its flawed document-retention policy, and
that he didn't break any laws.</TE>
<TE>   Rusty Hardin, Andersen's lead attorney, said at the time that
Duncan "did what he thought was right."</TE>
<TE>   Since Duncan pleaded guilty, however, Andersen has begun raising
questions about his credibility. Hardin said last week, "I don't know
who the real David Duncan is."</TE>

<HD>Argentina Abandons Savings Conversion Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>Argentina has dropped plans to turn frozen savings into bonds and is
exploring other ways to avoid the meltdown of its banking system,
government officials said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "We are going to wait a few more days. [Economy] Minister
[Roberto] Lavagna has halted the negotiations to find alternatives,"
presidential spokesman Eduardo Amadeo told local radio.</LD>
<LD>   Depositors have protested almost daily against the proposed
conversion of their savings into bonds, but Lavagna said at a news
briefing late Sunday that banks had been functioning better in the
last two weeks. He did not take questions.</LD>
<TE>   "Our objectives are to provide maximum flexibility for the future
use of savings and create conditions to make banks safe and
attractive for savers so we can once again have a normal banking
system," Lavagna said. "This will take a few more days."</TE>
<TE>   The Argentine government, however, is due to repay about $800
million to the World Bank in the coming days--a payment analysts say
could be hard to meet without an outside loan or dipping into
depleted central bank reserves. But Lavagna has said it would be
authorized by tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Defaulting on multilateral loans could cut off one of the
government's last remaining outside sources of cash, which has been
suspended since December when the International Monetary Fund halted
payments because of a litany of broken Argentine promises to curb
public overspending.</TE>
<TE>   Lavagna, the sixth economy minister in just more than a year,
predicted the Inter-American Development Bank would approve $700
million today for much-needed social programs.</TE>

<HD>Rivals Pose Challenge to Reign of Broadcom</HD>
<DH>High tech: Contract loss signals new competition. But for
now it is No. 1 in chips for cable modems and set-top boxes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stock market may have overreacted by dumping shares of Broadcom
Corp. last week after a competitor picked up a contract with
Broadcom's biggest customer. But the one-day, 17% stock price drop
raises an issue once unthinkable by the Newport Beach chip maker
known for its aggressive marketing and management styles: Is Broadcom
losing its edge?</LD>
<LD>   Starting with an explosive stock offering four years ago, Broadcom
rocketed to prominence with an acquisition spree and an overwhelming
dominance of the chip market for cable modems and cable set-top
boxes, which it was the first to build. But as it enters new markets,
it is finding competitors already there--even as its hold on core
areas is being challenged.</LD>
<LD>   "Broadcom is facing more competition on more fronts," said analyst
Jeremy Lopez at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. "I am concerned in the
longer term about their competitiveness. I'm a bit skeptical that
they're not going to hit a bump in the road. It's got to happen some
time."</LD>
<TE>   The contract that Texas Instruments Inc. won last week from
Motorola Inc. probably will knock a few points off Broadcom's sales
to Motorola, which accounted for 14% of the chip maker's sales last
quarter. But Broadcom will remain the chip vendor for set-top boxes
and the primary supplier of silicon for cable modems at Motorola, the
world's biggest cable-modem seller and a Broadcom investor.</TE>
<TE>   "The [Texas Instruments] contract is a wake-up call to Broadcom
that the market has matured and that it isn't the only kid on the
block anymore," said analyst Jeremey Donovan at research firm Gartner
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Though cautious, analysts know that the management machine that
made Broadcom the fastest-growing chip maker in history is launching
a slew of new products in eight new markets over the next two years.</TE>
<TE>   "Better product, lower price and faster to market--that's the tool
that got us where we are today and will keep us going in the future,"
said Chief Executive Henry T. Nicholas III. "We're not just in all
these markets, we're an innovator in all of them. When I look at my
competitive landscape, it's actually less competitive now than it was
before."</TE>
<TE>   If Broadcom continues to put more features on a chip and combine
more functions in a product--effectively lowering prices and
consuming less power--it will become the powerhouse of communication
chips, analysts said. It already is a contender.</TE>
<TE>   "Broadcom has been very dominant and is always going to face new
competition," said James Liang, an analyst at Pacific Growth Equities
in San Francisco. "Though it's facing competitive pressures in its
core markets, it is well positioned in new markets."</TE>
<TE>   Broadcom doesn't disclose publicly its share of the various
markets it supplies. The overall market for communications chips was
about $37 billion last year, and silicon for cable modems and set-top
boxes amounted to 25% of the total, according to Gartner's Dataquest
unit. The research firm estimates that overall sales will slip a bit
this year and grow 24% next year.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews and analyst meetings, however, Broadcom executives
give some hints about what goes into revenue that reached $1.1
billion in 2000--before the industry's steep slide last year.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas, for instance, said Broadcom controls 70% of the silicon
content in the $1.3-billion cable modem market, though many analysts
estimate that the percentage is higher. Last week, William J. Ruehle,
the company's chief financial officer, told a group of analysts that
more than 90% of the company's revenue comes from four areas: cable
modems, digital set-top boxes, servers and enterprise networks, which
move data along corporate computer systems.</TE>
<TE>   "All we do is broadband [high-speed connections], but within
broadband, we do a broader scope of things than anyone out there,"
Ruehle said.</TE>
<TE>   The company's stock typically has been pricey compared with others
in the industry, whether it was $274 in August 2000 or in the $50
range in early January. But the beating that tech stocks have taken
has pushed Broadcom's value down 40% this year to $24.54 a share at
Friday's close on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Since the company began operations in 1991, it has focused on
developing high-speed semiconductors, adding more functions to them,
integrating them into more products and selling them at a cheaper
price.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to create networks of communication devices that meld
voice, video and data into a seamless cycle.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcom entered the set-top box market in the mid-1990s as the
market was moving from analog to digital. Its first chip was a switch
to change transmission from one to the other. It then built on that
to develop chips to handle all the other functions.</TE>
<TE>   In a recently announced deal, its semiconductors will be powering
Motorola's latest cable modem, one with a small antenna that provides
wireless local area networking, or LAN. That's the technology that
lets consumers connect computers, phones, televisions--almost any
communication device in the home--without additional wires. The
technology uses existing telephone and electrical lines.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts, though, question whether consumers in a soft market
for electronic gadgets will pay for a high-end home networking system
that includes such features as private video recording, firewall
protection, parental controls and virtual private networking
connections.</TE>
<TE>   "End-market demand concerns continue to worry us," analyst Mark
Edelstone wrote in a recent Morgan Stanley research report.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas, however, sees demand growing--at least for his company's
products.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, Broadcom is very confident in its broadband
products," said analyst N. Quinn Bolton at CIBC World Markets in New
York. "They have the best integration, and they can apply the same
marketing and product strategy to new markets where Broadcom starts
from zero."</TE>
<TE>   Others, for instance, had developed Ethernet technology, which is
a mode of communications across corporate business networks, long
before Broadcom came on the scene in the mid-1990s. In an Ethernet
product, one chip receives incoming data and figures out what all
those ones and zeros mean. Another switch puts that information into
packets, and a third switch figures out where to ship it.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcom combined those functions and added more ports for
connections on one chip, which cost more than a single chip but far
less than the three that were needed. It ended up with a huge market
share, said analyst Mark Grossman of S.G. Cowen Securities in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Marvell Technology Group Ltd. in Bermuda, however, has been
grabbing some of Broadcom's customers for the gigabit Ethernet, the
fastest version that only Broadcom had produced.</TE>
<TE>   "So we've got Marvell boasting that it has 5% of the market and
we've gone to 95%," Nicholas said. "But we're not losing ground
because demand is stronger. We're going from shipping 1 million units
last year to shipping 5 million this year."</TE>
<TE>   The company that gets to market first with a better product at a
lower price can usually enjoy a near monopoly for a year or two until
other firms catch up and compete better, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It gets to the point where there's relatively little difference
in the product, and you're fighting a battle that has less to do with
product and more with price and relationships," Donovan said.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas said his company expects to face competition because all
of its products are based on industry standards, which it helps
develop and which others use to build their products.</TE>
<TE>   Acquisitions have helped immensely, analysts noted. Over a
two-year period, Broadcom acquired 20 companies, most with no
products but with hot technology.</TE>
<TE>   "When things were booming, all communications chip companies made
lots of acquisitions, and the prices paid were outrageous," Grossman
said. "A lot of them didn't work out, and they shut down some of
those divisions. But Broadcom has done a reasonably good job in
getting technology."</TE>
<TE>   By far, its best acquisition has been ServerWorks Inc., which it
bought in January 2001 for 11 million shares of stock, then worth
about $1.3 billion. Liang said the unit, which makes circuits for
computers that act as Web servers, already had products and profit
and is a "very strong growth driver" for Broadcom.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next two years, Broadcom expects to burst into such
fields as wireless and wireless LAN, direct broadcast satellite,
voice over the Internet and the latest version of digital subscriber
lines, or DSL. Those plans may give competitors reason to worry,
Bolton said.</TE>
<TE>   "Increasingly, as we go out and talk to competitors, whether they
compete now or think they may in the future, when we ask them what
name keeps them up at night, more and more the answer coming back is
Broadcom," Bolton said. "I've heard that from customers in different
market segments. They look at Broadcom as a big, hungry company that
can throw a lot of resources into anything they do."</TE>
<TE>   Broadcom also has been reducing its reliance on only a handful of
customers. Cisco Systems Inc., which accounted for 14% of Broadcom's
revenue in 2000, signaled the start of the industry's plunge in late
2000 when it disclosed that a huge inventory backlog and slack demand
would cause it to cut back drastically on orders for chips from
Broadcom and others.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco had been the second-largest Broadcom customer behind
Motorola, which accounted for 18% of Broadcom's sales last year and
23% the previous year. Overall, Broadcom cut its reliance on its five
biggest customers, which accounted for 49% of sales last year
compared with 62% the prior year.</TE>
<TE>   More important for Broadcom, though, is that its customers are
showing their own financial health and reliability. Company
executives said their customers are paying their bills quickly, now
within 28 days of shipment, on average.</TE>

<DH>Enticed by the potential for profit, carriers and media
giants aim to offer more audio and video content for cell phones</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spider-Man is coming to a phone near you. So are Tiger Woods, Smash
Mouth, Britney Spears and Mickey Mouse in a wave of mobile
entertainment sweeping across the wireless world.</LD>
<LD>   In the months ahead, a growing number of cellular customers will
be able to download ring tones, color graphics, movie trailers and
games based on their favorite films, sports celebrities and recording
artists.</LD>
<LD>   The trend is being driven by a convergence of three forces. New
technology is giving cell phones ever-greater capabilities. Wireless
companies that have spent billions upgrading their networks are
looking for ways to sell more services through their expanded
pipelines. And entertainment conglomerates such as Walt Disney Co.,
Vivendi Universal and AOL Time Warner Inc. have visions of wireless
phones becoming hand-held entertainment centers.</LD>
<TE>   Enticed by that prospect, global media giants and cell phone
carriers are scrambling to tie up relationships with one another.</TE>
<TE>   Disney has lined up deals with carriers, including Sprint PCS and
AT&amp;T Wireless, to provide Disney-themed games, graphics and ring
tones to cell phone users from the U.S. to Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Sony Corp.'s Columbia Pictures has developed relationships with
Cingular Wireless and Sprint PCS to promote such movies as
"Spider-Man" and "Men in Black 2."</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi, owner of the world's largest music company, recently
scooped up the nation's leading supplier of wireless ring tones based
on popular songs, ranging from Weezer's "Hash Pipe" to the Who's
"Going Mobile."</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing a major push by the entertainment companies to take
advantage of the intersection between the ubiquity of cell phones and
the digital age," said P.J. McNealy, research director for GartnerG2,
a technology and business research firm in San Jose. "There's no
doubt wireless could have huge promotional opportunities for them."</TE>
<TE>   Still, much of the excitement is over the potential
applications--and potential profit--for the cell phone, rather than
what's currently being realized.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the hoopla and skyrocketing cell phone usage, no one can
predict whether Americans will pay to download music or watch movie
clips on their tiny screens.</TE>
<TE>   "The wireless phone may be the next frontier for the marketing of
entertainment product in the U.S. But the market is fraught with
unique challenges," according to a recent issue of the Entertainment
Marketing Letter, an industry newsletter based in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The use of ring tones, graphics and text messaging to promote
entertainment hasn't taken off in the U.S. as it has in Europe.
There, cell phones are more sophisticated and networks are equipped
to handle the higher speeds required for Internet-ready headsets.</TE>
<TE>   Compounding these technical problems, few U.S. wireless carriers
have compatible systems, so a game developed for Sprint PCS' network
can't be played by AT&amp;T Wireless or Cingular customers.</TE>
<TE>   But conglomerates such as Vivendi, Disney and Sony can't afford to
ignore the possibilities of wireless, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only is it a new outlet, it's an outlet we are predicting
will grow extremely popular with the youth and teen market," said
Knox Bricken, an analyst with Boston-based technology research firm
Yankee Group. "The opportunities are huge."</TE>
<TE>   Bricken forecasts that carriers will see a 430% growth in revenue
from these services over the next four years, from $215 million to
$1.14 billion by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Phone manufacturers, eager to boost sales of their hardware, will
roll out far more advanced handsets this summer, including such
features as faster Web browsing, larger and color screens and the
ability to download music, play more elaborate games and in some
cases watch streaming video.</TE>
<TE>   A new Nokia cell phone will come with a movie trailer for the
upcoming Fox Studios film "Minority Report" ready to play.</TE>
<TE>   Carriers are spending billions of dollars this year to upgrade
their networks to carry more data at higher speeds. And they are
hungry for new content to fill their expanded pipelines, with
services that generate more subscription fees and minutes spent on
their systems.</TE>
<TE>   Some entertainment executives envision that within two or three
years, mainstream America will be checking movie listings over the
phone, downloading trailers, buying tickets and getting directions to
the nearest theater--all with a few taps on a phone pad.</TE>
<TE>   For now, though, the ties between studios and carriers are more
modest.</TE>
<TE>   Consider "Spider-Man." For the last several months, Cingular has
been promoting the Columbia Pictures movie, which opened this month.
Fans of the comic book hero can indulge their passion by downloading
Spider-Man graphics, games and movie factoids on their mobile phones.</TE>
<TE>   "It comes down to a desire to open our movies large," said Rio
Caraeff, vice president of wireless services for Sony Pictures
Digital Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   All the major film studios now include wireless marketing as a
component of their movie advertising campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Sony Ericsson is introducing multimedia phones this year that will
be used as a platform to promote Sony properties, including both "Men
in Black" films and "Charlie's Angels" as well as games based on
movies.</TE>
<TE>   Sony also is developing wireless versions for its own software
such as PlayStation games. One new phone model even comes with a
built-in joystick.</TE>
<TE>   "We have very high expectations," Caraeff said. "Mobile gaming is
a very big business in Japan, Korea and most of Western Europe."</TE>
<TE>   Universal Pictures signed a deal with Nokia this year to provide
Nokia's U.S. customers with logos and ring tones from Universal
properties, including upcoming movie releases such as "8 Mile,"
starring rap singer Eminem.</TE>
<TE>   AOL also has been aggressive in the wireless arena. To help
promote its feature "Lord of the Rings," AOL's New Line Cinema sent
out 20,000 text message coupons to customers of VoiceStream. Fans
could show theater managers the coupon message on their mobile phones
and receive free posters from the movie.</TE>
<TE>   For cell phone users, the onset of mobile entertainment is certain
to create some new, if strange, possibilities. Imagine Arnold
Schwarzenegger answering your voice with his signature "I'll be
back."</TE>
<TE>   A unit of Vivendi is busy buying the rights to digitally record
the voices of 100 top celebrities, which will then be offered as a
service to wireless carriers later this year. Celebrity voices also
will be part of a $6 mobile phone package to be offered by Vivendi
for sale in grocery stores this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Customers of AT&amp;T Wireless can identify callers either by various
Disney characters that appear on the phones when a call comes in (one
dwarf, say, for each family member) or by ring tones from a catalog
of popular Disney songs such as "Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah" and "A Whole New
World."</TE>
<TE>   "We have high hopes for a big business," said Walt Disney Internet
Group President Steve Wadsworth. Disney also has a deal with Sprint
PCS, which will offer games based on the Disney features "Monsters,
Inc.," "Atlantis" and ESPN's 2-minute Drill.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that wireless gaming is the next step in the evolution of
gaming," said Sprint PCS spokeswoman Stephanie Walsh.</TE>
<TE>   One in six U.S. cell phone users, or 21.6 million people, will
play games on mobile phones this year, with the number increasing to
93 million in 2006, according to a forecast by research firm
Datamonitor.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's wireless push accelerated after its successful foray two
years ago into mobile-obsessed Japan, which offers a glimpse into
what could eventually come to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Through alliances with NTT DoCoMo and two other carriers, Disney
said it has built a profitable and expanding business in Japan. The
company now offers 13 subscription-based services to 2.5 million
customers. Among the services: a Disney fortunetelling service, Pooh
screen savers, ring tones and greeting cards, and virtual attraction
games based on Tokyo Disney Resort.</TE>
<TE>   Disney also operates a wireless fan magazine in Japan, which it
used recently to promote the opening of the Disney/Pixar Animation
Studios hit "Monsters, Inc."</TE>
<TE>   "We see it as an opportunity to reach consumers any time,
anywhere," said Mark Handler, executive vice president of Disney's
international Internet operations.</TE>
<TE>   But whether Disney's success in Japan will translate in America is
anybody's guess.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too uncertain to say whether the DoCoMo model will be a big
money maker for the company," said Larry Shapiro, executive vice
president for business development and operations of Walt Disney
Internet Group.</TE>
<TE>   Though charges vary widely depending on the type of package the
carrier offers, customers pay an extra $1 to $5 a month for
individual ring tones and graphics, with entertainment companies
getting about 10% of the revenue as transaction or license fees.</TE>
<TE>   But the industry is so new that no one is making money off mobile
entertainment, which faces a host of challenges. Among them are how
to bill and market services without offending wireless customers with
unwanted advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of telecom businesses that built their models around the
possibilities of delivering services through "third-generation"
networks have floundered because carriers have been slow to adopt new
technology.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi has painfully learned that lesson with its multi-portal
Vizzavi Internet business in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The joint venture with the United Kingdom mobile operator Vodafone
has failed to live up to the promise of delivering news, sports,
movies and games through cell phones, personal digital assistants and
personal computers.</TE>
<TE>   "We were late in terms of developing the right devices for our
customers, who were not able to connect at the right speed and the
right price," said Philippe Germond, chief executive of Vivendi
Universal Net.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi is taking a different tack in the U.S. The company is
building relationships with carriers through its new
wireless-services subsidiary rather than spending millions on
launching a new portal.</TE>
<TE>   Robin Richards, CEO of Vivendi Universal Net USA, has high hopes
for wireless in America.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a business that three years from now is a $1-billion
business for Vivendi."</TE>

<HD>Fingerhut Calls for Bids on Assets</HD>
<DH>Retail: The firm pursues liquidation amid talks with
wholesaler to buy a portion from Federated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fingerhut moved a step closer to shutting down by inviting
liquidators to bid on its assets.</LD>
<LD>   The Minnetonka, Minn.-based catalog retailer sent a letter Friday
calling for bids to a group of more than 40 liquidation companies and
asset resellers. The letter set May 22 as the deadline for bidding.</LD>
<LD>   The letter from Beth Logsdon, Fingerhut's vice president of
merchandising operations, calls for two bids--one for an estimated
$55 million to $65 million worth of product merchandise and the other
for the equipment and fixtures at various Fingerhut facilities.</LD>
<TE>   Ben Saukko, a spokesman for Fingerhut, said Sunday he was unaware
the letters had been sent and had no further comment.</TE>
<TE>   The call for bids surprised Tom Petters, an Eden Prairie,
Minn.-based wholesaler who, along with former Fingerhut Chief
Executive Ted Deikel, has been negotiating to buy a portion of
Fingerhut from Federated Department Stores.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know this letter had gone out," Petters said. "I'm
surprised that this many people were invited in."</TE>
<TE>   Petters and Deikel declined to comment on how the Fingerhut
invitation to liquidators might affect their negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   The 54-year-old business has 3,100 workers, including 2,600 in
Minnesota. Fingerhut has laid off 2,400 people in Minnesota and 900
in Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   The invitations to liquidators didn't surprise Minnesota Atty.
Gen. Mike Hatch, who has been monitoring efforts to revive Fingerhut
after Federated announced Jan. 16 that it would close the company
unless a buyer was found.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not good news, but it's not inconsistent with what's been
happening," he said. "I think Federated could still be selling the
residual property necessary to restart Fingerhut to Deikel, yet be
undergoing a liquidation."</TE>
<TE>   Hatch said Deikel told him last week that negotiations to buy a
portion of the Fingerhut assets were continuing, but that restarting
the business would be difficult considering the amount of time that
has elapsed since Federated announced Fingerhut's closure.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations between Fingerhut and Wayzata businessman Peter Lytle
ended last week. Lytle said a sluggish economy hampered his ability
to complete a purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders criticized the call for bids.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the route that we were always pushing them to stay away
from," said Jane Palmbach, a leader of the Union of Needletrades,
Industrial and Textile Employees. She said it was "totally
inappropriate" for the firm to pursue liquidation while in talks.</TE>

<HD>Firms Plan to Increase Hiring, Study Says</HD>
<DH>Labor: The third-quarter projections are the best in 15
months. But the education and mining sectors are expected to see
continued erosion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>U.S. firms will pick up their pace of hiring in the third quarter to
the best level in 15 months as they build on an economic recovery
that began in the second quarter, a survey released today suggests.</LD>
<LD>   Staffing projections are gathering strength across the country,
according to the quarterly employment outlook survey conducted by
Manpower Inc., a privately held employment agency.</LD>
<LD>   The report said 27% of the nearly 16,000 companies interviewed by
phone plan to add employees in the third quarter of this year,
compared with 21% in the second quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Eight percent expect to reduce staffing, compared with 10%, while
59% said they would sit tight and not make any changes. Six percent
were uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   When the seasonal effect is removed from the data, the
improvements reflect a 14% net increase in employment prospects, a
substantial rise over the seasonally adjusted results of the last two
quarters, the survey said.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, the hiring strength is at its most positive level in
five quarters," said Manpower Chairman and Chief Executive Jeffrey
Joerres. "Hiring intentions are consistent with those we have seen in
past recovery periods," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. economy raced ahead in the first quarter at the fastest
pace in more than two years as consumers spent solidly and a yearlong
trend of sharp cutbacks in business inventories showed signs of
tapering off, the government said last month.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. gross domestic product, measuring the amount of goods and
services produced within the United States, soared at a 5.8% annual
rate in the first three months of this year.</TE>
<TE>   However, early this month the Labor Department said the U.S.
unemployment rate shot up to its highest level in more than 71/2
years in April. Analysts said the unemployment data showed the
economy was still having difficulty getting traction for sustained
growth after last year's downturn.</TE>
<TE>   Joerres said work force projections are gathering strength in all
regions of the country for the third quarter, when compared with the
same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   The survey said eight of 10 sectors are forecast to have improved
hiring opportunities, with education and mining being the exceptions
and likely to show a continued downward trend.</TE>
<TE>   The construction sector is expected to do the most hiring. Among
firms, 38% plan to hire workers, while 6% are set to reduce their
payrolls. When seasonal variations are removed, the construction
sector is expected to see a 17% net gain in jobs, the survey said.</TE>

<HD>Settlement Deal With Merrill Remains Distant, Spitzer Says</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: New York's attorney general says analysts'
compensation must be separate from firm's investment banking
business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>New York state Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer said Sunday a deal with
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. remained distant, as a number of significant
issues must still be resolved in his probe into the company's overly
bullish and biased research.</LD>
<LD>   Spitzer also criticized the Securities and Exchange Commission for
implementing "porous" rules last week to force stock analysts to
reveal more about their ties to companies they research.</LD>
<LD>   Spitzer last month accused Merrill of issuing biased stock
recommendations to investors in order to woo lucrative investment
banking business.</LD>
<TE>   The two sides are in settlement discussions, which are being
closely monitored by Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a long way to go, many substantial issues, where I do not
believe they [Merrill] yet understand what they have to do to restore
integrity to the marketplace," Spitzer said in an interview with
ABC's "This Week" program.</TE>
<TE>   In the negotiations, Spitzer said he is insisting that the
compensation Merrill analysts receive must be entirely separate from
the investment banking business it generates. In Spitzer's 10-month
investigation, Merrill analysts were shown to have privately
disparaged shares in Internet firms that they had publicly
recommended.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill, which has lost more than $9.5 billion in market value in
a little over a month, is hurrying to reach a settlement to prevent a
court hearing. A hearing is scheduled for Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   A Merrill spokesman declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's office also is sifting through information it gathered
from firms including UBS' UBS Warburg, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Salomon Smith Barney and Credit Suisse
Group's Credit Suisse First Boston as part of a wider probe.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer would not say whether he would bring criminal charges
against the companies.</TE>
<TE>   "What I have said ... is that we will wait to determine what the
evidence shows, whether we can resolve these issues," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer also said the SEC's new rules to curb future abuses were
"very inadequate."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the SEC needs to put in place at a national level the
rules that will ensure that the analysts are honest and
straightforward and not tainted," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC rules will limit when and how analysts can issue opinions
on stocks, restrict their personal investing activities and force
banks to disclose more about their ties to companies they research
and those of their analysts.</TE>

<HD>The Next Ethnic Dish of the Day: Vietnamese Pho</HD>
<DH>Food: The rice noodle soup is entering the mainstream in a
big way as chefs and marketers scramble to capitalize on its growing
appeal.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Olive oil and pasta. Salsa and tortillas. Tofu as a main course. Soy
sauce as a marinade. These and other once-unfamiliar ethnic staples
have found their way into American kitchens, enlivening the nation's
palate and spicing up sales for restaurants and supermarkets.</LD>
<LD>   Next on the menu: Vietnamese pho?</LD>
<LD>   Pronounced "fuh," the beef noodle soup is the latest ethnic food
that seems to have struck a chord with Americans.</LD>
<TE>   Although the phenomenon is still in its infancy, pho is poised to
become the next mainstream Asian food in the U.S. Its effect already
has been felt in several branches of the food industry.</TE>
<TE>   Across the country, chefs at upscale fusion restaurants, catering
services and university campuses are scrambling to add the rice
noodle soup to their menus.</TE>
<TE>   A Campbell Soup Co. subsidiary has partnered with a well-known
Vietnamese American chef to market a refrigerated pho broth to the
food service industry.</TE>
<TE>   And instant pho is coming soon to your neighborhood supermarket.</TE>
<TE>   "The story of the last 15 years is that ... the core of the
American diet is shrinking, and what is expanding is what used to be
considered the fringe of American cooking," said Greg Drescher,
education director at the Culinary Institute of America in St.
Helena, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   The burgeoning acceptance of Asian flavors already has generated a
new category in grocery store sales. Packaged Asian foods accounted
for $650 million in mainstream supermarket sales last year, according
to Information Resources, a Chicago-based food sales research firm.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of pho, culinary experts say its growing appeal is
part of a national frenzy for Southeast Asian cuisine among U.S.
chefs.</TE>
<TE>   "Mainstream American chefs ... are being asked to put more Asian
food on the menu," Drescher said. The trend is apparent at such
casual-dining chains as California Pizza Kitchen, which offers
Vietnamese-style spring rolls and Thai chicken pizza, and Cheesecake
Factory, which serves Thai lettuce wraps and Thai chicken pasta.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say pho's rising star is being helped by this trend.
Introduced in the mid-1970s by immigrants who fled the communist
regime in Vietnam, pho thrived in hundreds of small noodle shops that
soon cropped up in Asian enclaves in San Jose, Orange County and the
San Gabriel Valley. But it remained relatively unknown to the general
eating public until recent years.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government's lifting of an economic embargo against
Vietnam in 1994 and subsequent steps toward trade normalization,
along with a corresponding spike in American tourism to that country,
also have helped fuel interest in pho.</TE>
<TE>   One Vietnamese food importer said his American acquaintances began
asking him about the dish for the first time after former President
Clinton was reported in news accounts to have eaten chicken pho
during his visit to Vietnam in late 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Vietnamese restaurateurs in the U.S. have responded to this
increased openness between the two countries by venturing into
mainstream markets.</TE>
<TE>   Among them is Sacramento chef Mai Pham--one of pho's most vocal
proponents--who has partnered with Campbell subsidiary Stockpot Inc.
to produce a flash-chilled pho broth to be marketed to restaurants
and food service groups this year.</TE>
<TE>   The product will target chefs who don't specialize in Vietnamese
cooking and want to serve pho without a great deal of preparation.</TE>
<TE>   "For the non-Asian chef, it gives him or her access to a cuisine
that is in high demand," said Kathleen Horner, president of the
Woodinville, Wash.-based producer of gourmet refrigerated soups and
sauces. She declined to say how much in sales the product will
generate for Stockpot.</TE>
<TE>   The complexity of the dish is one obstacle pho faces in becoming
as widely available as other Asian noodles, such as Japanese ramen or
Chinese chow mein.</TE>
<TE>   A full day of simmering beef bones with a combination of spices is
required to produce the clear broth. Then comes the assembly, which
begins with laying the skinny, blanched noodles at the bottom of a
warmed bowl; layering slender cuts of raw and cooked beef, paper-thin
yellow onion slices, chopped green onions and cilantro on top; then
ladling broth over the noodles. The dish is served with a plate of
fresh toppings: Asian basil and saw-leaf herb, bean sprouts, sliced
jalapenos and a wedge of lime.</TE>
<TE>   "The broth has to be steaming, bubbly hot," Pham said, "so that
when the [herbs] hit the broth, they just wilt immediately and send
the flavors up to your face."</TE>
<TE>   Stockpot also has signed on to produce a line of Vietnamese
dipping sauces and Thai curries using Pham's recipes.</TE>
<TE>   Further evidence of pho's growing appeal is its increasing
availability on college cafeteria menus. A number of West Coast
universities with large Asian student populations have introduced pho
in their dining halls.</TE>
<TE>   But the trend isn't limited to these schools. Chefs at the
University of Massachusetts in Amherst, which has a 7% Asian student
population, started serving pho once a week in the residential dining
halls in September. Within two months, the response was so warm that
pho began appearing twice weekly on the menu, said Ken Toong, the
school's director of dining services. "If it gets more popular, we'll
make it three times a week," Toong said.</TE>
<TE>   Food service contractors also have jumped on board. Bon Appetit
Management Co., which serves tech companies and colleges, introduced
pho on its menus about two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We do quite a lot of pho," said Marc Zammit, director of culinary
support for the Palo Alto-based firm. "On the same day that I saw it
at Cisco, I saw it at Yahoo." At the San Jose headquarters of Cisco
Systems Inc., cafes serving the Internet equipment company's 17,000
employees began offering pho last fall. "The onset of winter came,
and we were looking to add some variety to our Asian [food] station,"
Cisco Executive Chef Marc Marelich said. "It sold like gangbusters,"
he said. Pho was so well-received--it was outselling Japanese udon 2
to 1--that Marelich is working on a second Vietnamese noodle dish
based on a beef-and-duck broth.</TE>
<TE>   In the packaged foods sector, Seattle-based Associated Grocers
will begin distributing a line of pho products this year to its 400
independent supermarket outlets in Washington, Oregon, Alaska and
Hawaii. Complete with packaging designed to attract the mainstream
buyer, the line includes packages of instant pho noodles and jars of
concentrated pho broth paste.</TE>
<TE>   Viet Wah, an Asian foods importer that will supply Associated
Grocers, introduced the products at the Fancy Foods Show in San
Francisco in January. The Seattle-based firm, which has $15 million
in annual sales supplying ethnic food outlets, also is in talks with
Kroger Co., the nation's largest supermarket operator, according to
the company's president, Duc Tran. Kroger declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Tran said he approached Associated Grocers with the packaged
Vietnamese food concept five years ago but was told the demand was
not there. He credits Americans' changing attitude toward Vietnam
with creating the interest in his product.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Peters, gourmet food manager for the grocer-owned
cooperative, said the Southeast Asian trend in the restaurant
industry has made the time ripe for Vietnamese packaged products in
the retail sector.</TE>
<TE>   "A brand like this comes along, and it's going to set our stores
apart from, say, Safeway," Peters said. "This is really a crossover
brand, meaning that it will be bought by non-Asian clientele."
Vietnamese food products are likely to capture as much supermarket
shelf space as Thai foods now have, he said.</TE>
<TE>   As pho gains steam in the mainstream food industry, some
Vietnamese restaurateurs also are sensing the opportunity to appeal
to a larger market. Some are trickling out of Asian enclaves, where
Vietnamese and other Asians, including Koreans and Chinese, have long
provided a steady stream of demand.</TE>
<TE>   Pho Bac Huynh, which opened in Westwood last year, is one of just
a handful of pho restaurants on the Westside. "We cater to the
university students who are busy and don't have a lot of money, and
to business professionals," said owner Tam Nguyen.</TE>
<TE>   The spunky 33-year-old single mom, who fled Vietnam as a child,
has a vision for the pho shop of the 21st century. "I believe we're
on the right track," Nguyen said. "Vietnamese food is the next wave."</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen has trained an all-Latino staff to prepare and serve the
food, unlike most traditional pho shops, which are run by members of
a family or Vietnamese hired help.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Oscar Martinez says he eats pho every day at work, and he
never tires of the version of the soup that contains beef tripe and
tendons. "It's like menudo," Martinez said, referring to a spicy
Mexican soup that also contains tripe. "It's very similar to our
food, especially with the jalapenos," he said.</TE>
<TE>   During a recent lunch break at Nguyen's trendy restaurant, Sarah
Pence said she has eaten pho regularly since a Vietnamese friend
introduced her to it four years ago. "It's pretty inexpensive for a
good meal," the 25-year-old Los Angeles hairstylist said. "And it's
good for a hangover."</TE>
<TE>   At another table, Aubri Bitterolf, 26, said she was hooked after
trying it for the first time last summer. "I used to come here two or
three times a week," said Bitterolf, who works for an advertising
agency nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen's goal is to franchise her modernized pho shop concept,
following in the footsteps of Pho Hoa, the biggest pho franchiser in
this country.</TE>
<TE>   Pho Hoa has 50 locations scattered throughout the United States
and Canada, and three dozen more in Indonesia, South Korea, the
Philippines and other Asian countries.</TE>
<TE>   Founder Binh Nguyen opened his first noodle shop in San Jose in
1983. He now has his sights set on Europe.</TE>
<TE>   He also plans to Westernize some of the items on Pho Hoa's menu to
attract more non-Asian customers.</TE>
<TE>   That may be unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans are getting more sophisticated about the food of other
cultures," the Culinary Institute's Drescher said. "It turns out
Americans are falling in love with Vietnamese food just as it is."</TE>

<HD>Dockworkers to Start Contract Talks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>APL Ltd., Maersk Pacific Ltd. and other ocean carriers will begin
contract talks with West Coast dockworkers today, seeking to avert a
work slowdown like the one that occurred three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   In 1999, longshoremen in Los Angeles and Long Beach, the two
busiest U.S. ports, slowed operations when the sides failed to reach
an agreement in time. A similar slowdown or strike at the West Coast
ports could cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars, according to
Martin Associates, a consulting firm.</LD>
<LD>   The current contract expires July 1. The carriers and terminal
operators, represented by the Pacific Maritime Assn. trade group,
want to automate some of the work done by longshoremen, Joe Miniace,
the group's chief executive, said.</LD>
<TE>   The union's main concerns are maintaining benefit packages,
getting better pensions, keeping jurisdiction over data-input jobs
and increasing its control of trucking jobs, said Steve Stallone, a
spokesman for the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which
represents about 10,000 workers at the ports.</TE>
<TE>   Retailers and other shippers dependent on imports from Asia
through the ports will be watching the labor talks closely, said
Robin Lanier, executive director of the West Coast Waterfront
Coalition, an industry group whose members include Best Buy Co., Gap
Inc. and Nike Inc., among others.</TE>
<TE>   West Coast ports handled about $310 billion in trade in 2000,
mostly from imports, compared with $61 billion in 1980, according to
U.S. census data. As importers' reliance on West Coast ports has
risen, they have grown concerned that the ports could become a weak
link in their supply chains, Lanier said.</TE>

<HD>Holders to Vote on Amgen-Immunex Deal</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shareholders of both companies will vote Thursday on Amgen Inc.'s
$13.5-billion acquisition of rival Immunex Corp. The deal, which
would still require government approval, would create a powerhouse in
inflammatory disease, anchored by Immunex's rheumatoid arthritis drug
Enbrel.</LD>
<LD>   Recent production problems have resulted in a shortage of Enbrel,
causing Immunex to shave 2002 sales projections 10% to $900 million.
A sharp decline in Amgen's price has lowered the value of the deal
from $16 billion, when it was announced last December.</LD>
<LD>   Under terms of the deal, Immunex shareholders will receive $4.50
cash and .44 share of Amgen stock for each Immunex share. Amgen
closed at $45.66 in Nasdaq trading Friday, down 23% from its closing
price of $59.49 on Dec. 18.</LD>
<TE>   Immunex now stands to receive stock and cash valued at $24.60 a
share. Immunex closed at $24.07 Friday on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The deal requires regulatory approval. The exact value of the deal
won't be set until it closes.</TE>
<TE>   Wyeth Laboratories, formerly American Home Products, owns 41% of
Immunex and has agreed to vote its shares for the deal.</TE>

<HD>April CPI Expected to Show 0.4% Rise</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters, Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The leading piece of economic data due this week will be a measure of
April consumer inflation, the U.S. consumer price index.</LD>
<LD>   The CPI is expected to show a rise of 0.4% overall and a gain of
0.2%, excluding food and energy prices. The report is scheduled for
release Wednesday. In March, the overall CPI rose 0.3% and the core
CPI increased 0.1%.</LD>
<LD>   April retail sales also will be announced, although most U.S.
retailers reported April sales Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   A measure of April retail sales is expected to show a gain of
0.7%, compared with a 0.1% rise in March, and the gauge of retail
sales excluding autos is forecast to rise 0.4%. This report is due
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Some retailers incurred the effect of an early Easter holiday,
which fell on the last day of March and reduced purchases.</TE>
<TE>   Other economic data coming this week:</TE>
<TE>   * Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will report on industrial
production for April. The report is expected to show a 0.4% increase;
manufacturers, such as Whirlpool Corp. and General Motors Corp., are
boosting production as factories emerge from a 11/2-year slump.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Wednesday, the Commerce Department will report on business
inventories during March.</TE>
<TE>   * Thursday, Commerce will report on housing starts for April.</TE>
<TE>   * Friday, Commerce will report on the nation's March trade
deficit. The deficit in goods and services is expected to have
widened to $32.4 billion from $31.5 billion in February, and would be
the biggest trade gap since March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the University of Michigan will issue its closely monitored
consumer sentiment index for May.</TE>

<HD>Closing Arguments for Genentech Case</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Denise Gellene</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Closing arguments will begin today in City of Hope National Medical
Center's $445-million breach-of-contract case against Genentech Inc.
The case could go to a Los Angeles County Superior Court jury as
early as Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Duarte-based hospital claims Genentech owes it royalties on
drugs produced by third parties that licensed a City of Hope
discovery from Genentech.</LD>
<LD>   The South San Francisco-based biotechnology company said that it
has paid the hospital $302 million in royalties through March 2002
and does not owe any of the amount claimed.</LD>
<TE>   The dispute involves a 1976 contract that established a research
collaboration between the hospital and Genentech, then a start-up
company with one full-time employee. Genentech agreed to fund
specific research projects at City of Hope and pay the hospital
royalties on products that resulted from its discoveries. City of
Hope agreed to give patents to Genentech.</TE>
<TE>   City of Hope scientists discovered a method of producing human
proteins in bacteria, a breakthrough that paved the way for the first
biotechnology drug, human insulin. Genentech has paid City of Hope
royalties on sales of insulin and another drug that resulted from the
collaboration, human growth hormone. But Genentech said it is not
required to pay the hospital royalties on sales of other drugs by
third parties that have licensed the patent.</TE>
<TE>   City of Hope said the contract requires Genentech to pay the
hospital a 2% royalty on third-party sales. The hospital said it is
owed royalties and interest on 22 drugs, including hepatitis B
vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second time the case has been tried. In October, a
jury deadlocked 7 to 5 in favor of Genentech after six days of
deliberations.</TE>

<HD>New Domain Draws Ire of Ineligible</HD>
<DH>Careers: The .pro sparks debate on which jobs are
considered professional and which aren't.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHANNON HENRY</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Doctors, lawyers and certified public accountants are welcome to
apply. Hairdressers, plumbers and real estate agents are maybes.
Don't even bother if you're an athlete, photographer or musician.</LD>
<LD>   The approval earlier last week of a new Internet domain
address--.pro, for professionals--is dredging up an old question
about the status of one's life work. Which careers are considered
"professional," and which are not?</LD>
<LD>   In the latest example of how the Internet imitates the real world,
complete with professional snobbery, the .pro domain name will be
available only to "certified" members of the three aforementioned
professions, although anyone can visit its sites.</LD>
<TE>   Members of other occupations that credential or certify will be
able to buy similar addresses eventually--but exactly who will be
eligible and what proof will be acceptable is still to be determined.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it very elitist and condescending to other professions who
give as much to our society as a doctor or lawyer," said Erinlynne
Desel, a licensed massage therapist and spa director at Aveda in
Washington. "I consider myself a professional."</TE>
<TE>   Linda Cornfield, office manager of the 2,000-member Plumbers and
Pipefitters Union in Aurora, Ill., was dismayed by the concept and
the limitation to the initial three professions. She said plumbers
would not like to be excluded from the option of getting a .pro
address.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a class thing," Cornfield said. "You're on this list because
you're white collar and we're blue collar."</TE>
<TE>   The .pro divide makes for some unusual contrasts: Dr. Dean Ornish
from the "Oprah" show could have a .pro address, but Winfrey herself
probably couldn't. Michael Jordan, or any other pro athlete, is a no
but Jordan's lawyer would be welcome. There won't be a YoYoMa.pro,
but accountants from Arthur Andersen are fine candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Sloan Gaon, chief executive of .pro overseer RegistryPro in New
York, a unit of Register.com, said as a company executive, he
wouldn't be eligible for what he calls the "gated community." But he
happens to have a law degree, too.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly need to draw the line," Gaon said. "By opening it up
to non-certifiable professions, we'd lose the trust."</TE>
<TE>   Gaon said it is vital to limit who gets a .pro address because
many professions don't have standard certifications, something his
group will check out before anyone is granted a .pro address. Gaon is
promising Web users who communicate with .pro owners that they will
have a secure dialogue with a trustworthy professional.</TE>
<TE>   Once a person applies for the domain name, RegistryPro will use
public and private databases to delve into the applicant's history
and records. The point, Gaon said, is that when Web users go to a
.pro address, they should feel confident that that person has been
checked out, and that he is the person he says he is. "It's an online
diploma," Gaon said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether people will want a .pro address remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   Letting consumers know which tattooists are certified and which
aren't is an attractive idea to Dennis Dwyer, who tattoos in Tucson.
It would be helpful for people to know which tattooists are correctly
sterilizing needles and can explain the procedure thoroughly, he
said. "I'd be interested in being part of that group," Dwyer said.
But he also said it didn't surprise him that tattooists didn't make
the original list and he wouldn't be offended if they never were
invited.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not equal to a doctor," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That's what Louis Touton, general counsel of the Internet Corp.
for Assigned Names and Numbers, says, too. ICANN is a nonprofit
corporation in Marina del Rey that oversees the choices of domain
name registrars. Touton said those ineligible for .pro are more than
welcome to go somewhere else in cyberspace.</TE>
<TE>   "There are certainly plenty of domain names," he said. Indeed
there are: Fifteen top-level domain names such as .com, .org and
.museum are available. If .pro physicians, lawyers or CPAs are
disbarred, guilty of malpractice or lose their licenses, Gaon said
they will lose the .pro address. Owners of .pro addresses will be
rechecked by RegistryPro once a year.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Phillips, who has been an innkeeper for 27 years and is now
executive director of the Professional Assn. of Innkeepers
International in Santa Barbara, is in a profession that does not
certify its members. Phillips said he never thought a piece of paper
meant as much as the work itself.</TE>
<TE>   "When I think of the Web, I think of inclusivity rather than
exclusivity," Phillips said. "The Web was supposed to be an open
place."</TE>

<HD>S&amp;P to Change Criteria for Operating Profit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Standard &amp; Poor's, a unit of McGraw-Hill Cos., is expected to
announce changes in the way it calculates companies' operating
earnings, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing S&amp;P's chief
economist David Blitzer.</LD>
<LD>   S&amp;P's move to stricter standards, expected to be announced
Tuesday, underlines investors' craving for reliable financial
snapshots of publicly traded companies in the wake of accounting
scandals at collapsed energy trader Enron Corp. The most
controversial of S&amp;P's new standards would treat employee stock
options as a quarterly expense against earnings. The matter has drawn
attention in Congress where Sens. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and John
McCain (R-Ariz.) have proposed legislation to require companies to
show their stock options as an annual expense or risk losing certain
tax breaks.</LD>
<LD>   Generally accepted accounting principles set standards companies
must use for reporting net income. But companies aren't precluded
from publicizing other earnings measures.</LD>
<TE>   Including stock options as an expense will lower estimated
earnings for S&amp;P 500 companies by an average of 10% this year, the
paper reported, citing S&amp;P officials.</TE>

<HD>English-Only Rule in State Must Meet 'Necessity' Law</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Although only 2% of the workers at our company have direct
contact with clients, there has been a move to require all employees
to speak only English during work hours. Is this legal?</LD>
<LD>   --A.B., Anaheim</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Under a new law in California, a rule requiring employees
to speak only English would be legal only if it is justified by
"business necessity."</LD>
<TE>   According to the law, an employer must show that the English-only
rule has an overriding legitimate business purpose, that it is
necessary to the safe and efficient operation of the business,
fulfills the business purpose of the employer, and that there is no
alternative that would accomplish the business purpose with a less
discriminatory effect.</TE>
<TE>   If there were some event at your place of employment that affected
the safe operation of the business, for example, your employer could
justify the recent change in policy.</TE>
<TE>   Without knowing why your employer changed its policy, however, I
could not tell you with certainty if the policy is legal.</TE>

<TE>   Bonuses for Retained Employees Are Legal</TE>
<TE>   Q:  Recently I was laid off because my division is being sold.
However, some short-term employees who remained were given several
thousand dollars as bonuses that were not based on merit or length of
service.</TE>
<TE>   Management advised those who received bonuses to keep them
confidential or be terminated.</TE>
<TE>   Is this legal?</TE>
<TE>   --K.W., Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   A: An employer may give bonuses as an incentive to stay until the
company is sold. Such bonuses are regarded as part of the employee's
regular rate of pay, and would be considered as wages.</TE>
<TE>   An employer may not fire or formally discipline an employee who
discloses the amount of his or her wages, even if told to keep quiet.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the bonus, your question raises other issues as well.
There might be a discrimination claim, depending on the circumstances
of your termination. At-will employees may be terminated at any time,
but not for discriminatory or retaliatory reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Were only older employees let go and younger ones retained? If you
were a member of a protected class, because of your age, race or
physical disability, for example, your termination might be
discriminatory if workers who are not part of those classes were
retained.</TE>
<TE>   --Don D. Sessions</TE>
<TE>   Employee rights attorney</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo</TE>
<TE>   Like It or Not, Workers,  You Must Take Breaks</TE>
<TE>   Q: Because we are a moving and storage business, most of our
employees work in the field.</TE>
<TE>   A number of workers resist taking a lunch period, even though we
have told them that California law requires employees to take a lunch
break of at least half an hour if the work day is more than six
hours.</TE>
<TE>   What is our obligation in this situation? We are not opposed to
employee lunch breaks; we even prefer that employees take them.</TE>
<TE>   We also are tired of trying to enforce a law that is designed to
protect the rights of employees but which the employees resist.</TE>
<TE>   --T.J., Upland</TE>
<TE>   A: The law in this area is explicit--each employer must ensure
that its employees take their meal periods.</TE>
<TE>   As a general rule, California law prohibits employees from working
more than five hours in a workday without taking a meal period of at
least 30 minutes, during which time the employees must be relieved of
all duties. Although an exception to this rule permits employees to
waive the right to a meal period, the exception does not apply if an
employee works more than six hours in a workday.</TE>
<TE>   Despite your employees' reluctance to take their meal periods,
they cannot choose to skip them. The laws are designed to protect
employees, even from themselves.</TE>
<TE>   If the company fails to ensure that its employees take their
mandatory meal periods, it will be subject to penalties equal to one
additional hour of pay for each work day that each employee does not
take his or her meal period.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans will throw out more than 500 million mobile phones by 2005,
creating a huge pile of waste containing dangerous pollutants,
according to a report by an environmental research group.</LD>
<LD>   Inform, a nonprofit organization that campaigns for a cleaner
environment, called on federal and state governments and industry to
create more effective ways of recycling old phones, including
providing financial incentives.</LD>
<LD>   Cell phones have large amounts of highly polluting metals,
including lead solder, used on the internal circuit board, and
arsenic and cadmium.</LD>
<TE>   The report, principally funded by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, estimates cell phones will be discarded at a rate
of 130 million per year by 2005, resulting in 65,000 tons of waste.</TE>

<LD>Butterfly.net Inc. and IBM Corp. have created a global network for
online video games capable of supporting a million players or more
that will be rented to major game publishers.</LD>
<LD>   Butterfly Grid also will be one of the first major commercial
applications for IBM's concept of "grid computing," in which
far-flung computers are linked using open-source software to create
powerful computing networks, IBM said.</LD>
<LD>   Start-up Butterfly will provide software and IBM will provide the
operating hardware for the grid under a three-year capacity-on-demand
contract paid by Butterfly.</LD>
<TE>   Currently, most big multi-player online games can support multiple
users in the hundreds of thousands, but Scott Penberthy, vice
president of business development for IBM Global Services, said
accommodating millions of simultaneous users was possible if games
were built correctly.</TE>

<LD>Blockbuster Inc. will begin selling video games and consoles Memorial
Day weekend, competing head-to-head with retailers such as
Electronics Boutique for a piece of the $9.4-billion market.</LD>
<LD>   The Dallas subsidiary of Viacom Inc. generated $457.8 million in
revenue from game rentals last year, down 5% from 2000. As a percent
of revenue, however, Blockbuster has seen U.S. game rentals rise from
9% of sales in 2000 to 12% the first three months this year.</LD>

<HD>Bill Would Let Firms Share Customer Data</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several U.S. lawmakers introduced a long-awaited privacy bill last
week that would allow businesses to share information about customers
who have not explicitly forbidden them to do so.</LD>
<LD>   More than a year in the making, the privacy bill unveiled in the
House differs from a competing bill making its way through the Senate
that would require businesses to get a person's explicit permission
before sharing sensitive information such as income level, religious
affiliation or political interests.</LD>
<LD>   The bill by Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-Fla.) would instead leave
companies free to share customer profiles unless customers
specifically forbade them.</LD>
<TE>   The bill would cover transactions both on the Internet and in the
offline world and would override state laws that place more
restrictions on commercial use of personal information.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers would have no right to sue if their privacy was
violated. Enforcement would be left in the hands of the Federal Trade
Commission, which usually does not impose fines on a first offense.</TE>

<LD>Two former Microsoft Corp. executives announced they have formed a
production company for independent game developers.</LD>
<LD>   Capital Entertainment Group operates much like a venture capital
firm, funding game projects and linking the developers with
publishers who agree to shoulder the marketing and distribution costs
of the games in exchange for a 60% share of the sales.</LD>
<LD>   The Seattle company, which is in the process of raising $40
million, will fund games deemed too risky by large publishers, said
Kevin Bachus, a CEG co-founder who worked as director of developer
relations at Microsoft's Xbox group.</LD>
<TE>   The company also will produce games for foreign publishers who

<HD>'Augmented Reality' Adds New Layer to Real World</HD>
<DH>Defense: Goggles overlay virtual images on a streetscape, a
potentially vital tool in combat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM KRANE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Step outside and look at the world. In Manhattan, you'll see a
cityscape of buildings and traffic.</LD>
<LD>   If you're a firefighter, a police sharpshooter or a tourist
hankering for Chinese food, you'd want to add information to that
streetscape.</LD>
<LD>   Soon you'll have that option--without opening a map or guidebook.</LD>
<TE>   An emerging technology known as "augmented reality" will allow
people peering through computer-fueled goggles to see virtual images
overlaid on those of the real world.</TE>
<TE>   For a firefighter, the computer-aided streetscape might show
locations of stored chemicals and sprinkler connections.</TE>
<TE>   For the police officer, the goggles could relay aerial
surveillance images of a berserk gunman, helping the officer get a
bead on the bad guy.</TE>
<TE>   For the tourist, the glasses might show a virtual arrow and
message reading, "Joe's Shanghai, turn right, walk three blocks."</TE>
<TE>   For now, augmented reality--a clever amalgam of computing, global
positioning system navigation and a device that tracks a person's
head movement--lives mainly in the cluttered realm of university
research labs.</TE>
<TE>   The systems are supposed to first determine the user's exact
location and field of vision. Then, depending on the program running
on the hard drive, the computer augments the scene with images.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at Columbia University are fashioning some of the
innovations. There, users can strap on a backpack frame bristling
with 25 pounds of antennas, batteries and computing gear and take a
tour of the campus.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of displaying only the university's Greek revival halls
and tree-draped plazas, the computer goggles superimpose images of
long-demolished Victorian buildings that housed a mental institution
predating the school. Building name tags pop up and disappear when
you turn your head to gaze around the campus.</TE>
<TE>   The project, created by Columbia's schools of computer science and
journalism, has a more pressing purpose than mere campus orientation.</TE>
<TE>   The lead federal agency funding this is the U.S. Navy's Office of
Naval Research, which is spending $2.5 million a year on augmented
reality research.</TE>
<TE>   Spurred by the deaths of U.S. soldiers in Somalia in 1993, the
Navy wants scientists to develop a belt buckle-size computer and slim
computer glasses to help the Marines fight better in cities.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy also is developing a version for amphibious landing craft
to guide invasion forces through minefields and fog.</TE>
<TE>   Other research projects underway across the United States and
elsewhere aim to use augmented reality to aid everything from surgery
to jet-engine repair.</TE>
<TE>   Columbia computer science professor Steven Feiner, who gets about
$150,000 a year of the Navy's funding, is developing the visual
interfaces seen by wearers of the computer goggles.</TE>
<TE>   The clunky backpack system built by Feiner and his students is
cobbled together from a laptop computer and a pair of GPS satellite
receivers along with a head-tracking device, a high-speed wireless
Internet connection and a tiny video camera.</TE>
<TE>   When the wearer's location calls for the computer to augment the
scene with an image, it pops up on a pair of Sony goggles with a
see-through liquid crystal computer display.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not implying that someone should walk around with
something that weighs even half of this," Feiner said. "Being able to
look at stuff and seeing information in context with that stuff,
that's what it's all about."</TE>
<TE>   Augmented reality should be ready for consumer use in a decade or
so, Feiner said.</TE>
<TE>   First, U.S. soldiers will be trying it on for size.</TE>
<TE>   One impetus for the Office of Naval Research's Battlefield
Augmented Reality System, known as BARS, was the 1993 battle of
Mogadishu, in which 18 Americans--and hundreds of Somalis--died in
fierce urban combat.</TE>
<TE>   In the Mogadishu battle, U.S. soldiers on a critical rescue
mission got lost in the city's alleys because street signs had been
taken down.</TE>
<TE>   In future city battles, a soldier with augmented reality goggles
will see labels on buildings and streets and also active details,
such as areas of sniper fire and friendly forces, said Lawrence
Rosenblum, director of virtual reality research and systems at the
Naval Research Laboratory in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden he can be really involved in what's happening and
know what's going on around him," Rosenblum said.</TE>

<HD>Autobytel All Revved Up</HD>
<DH>Online auto referral service expects to become profitable
by year's end</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Autobytel Inc. was present at the creation of e-commerce.</LD>
<LD>   The service, which provides discount car price quotes to
consumers, debuted in March 1995 on Prodigy and spread to the general
Internet four months later.</LD>
<LD>   To use the service, car buyers fill out an online form detailing
the car they want, down to the model, color and options. A day or two
later, a local Autobytel-affiliated dealer calls to quote a no-haggle
price.</LD>
<TE>   According to a research paper published in 2000 by the National
Bureau of Economic Research, consumers save about 2% when buying
through Autobytel, which amounts to about $450 on the average online
car purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Similar online services have appeared, but several have since
disappeared or were gobbled up by Autobytel, which remains the leader
in the field. Its initial public stock offering in 1999 raised $72.1
million.</TE>
<TE>   Like most e-commerce companies, Autobytel has seen its fortunes
fluctuate wildly. Its stock hit a high of $41.88 shortly after the
IPO but in the last year dipped as low as 70 cents. The stock closed
Friday at $2.85 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the company drastically cut back its involvement in a
European version of the service.</TE>
<TE>   But Autobytel has survived, which is more than many e-commerce
ventures can claim, and its fortunes are looking up. The firm
predicts it will become profitable for the first time by the end of
2002. Last year, about 4% of all domestic auto sales were through
Autobytel referrals.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Schwartz joined Autobytel in August 2001 as a vice
chairman. Four months later he was named Autobytel's chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Question: What's the key to survival in e-commerce?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: If I were to name the one thing we've done that made us
successful where others were not, it's that we did not try to
reinvent a retail channel. There was already a well-established
retail channel for selling cars in this country with a long history.
We viewed ourselves as a marketer, not a retailer. What we did is
take the marketing costs way down.</TE>
<TE>   It costs a dealer about $420 in marketing to sell a car, on
average, working in the traditional media. We cost them about $150
per car they sell.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The dealers pay you directly for the referral?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes. It costs the consumer nothing to use the service. The
dealers pay a fee of about $25 a referral, whether it ends in a sale
or not. About 20% of referrals result in sales. We do not get paid a
success fee because we are a marketing company, not a brokering
company.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Along the way, Autobytel acquired a lot of companies.</TE>
<TE>   A: And we will continue to be acquisitive. We think we can make
some strategic acquisitions to keep our market share.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Isn't that how a lot of tech companies ran into problems,
overextending themselves?</TE>
<TE>   A: For us it has been successful, mostly. But we dropped some
things to refocus the company on our core business.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What did you drop?</TE>
<TE>   A: We were doing a number of things on the periphery--offering
services such as financing, insurance and warranty programs. We have
cut back from that.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What happened in Europe?</TE>
<TE>   A: We owned 77% of Autobytel Europe and we dropped our ownership
to 49%. That took about $25 million out of the balance sheet. I think
Europe will be a great market for us in the future--that's why we
maintained an interest there. But we were incurring substantial
operating expenses, resources and management time in Europe at a time
we didn't think that market warranted that much attention. We made
the decision to concentrate on dominating the U.S. market.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Will you need to raise more cash to get through the current
tech downturn?</TE>
<TE>   A: We have had two consecutive quarters of EBITDA profits
[earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization], so
there has not been a big need. We have $27 million in the bank, and I
feel quite comfortable we can execute our business plan with that
until we turn this thing cash flow profitable.</TE>
<TE>   Q: In the wake of the tech bubble burst, do you think it's harder
for an e-commerce company to interest investors?</TE>
<TE>   A: I can't speak for start-ups. I am not playing in that market.
But there is a robust market today for companies like ours to raise
capital if the need should arise. I'm talking about Internet
companies that have survived and are getting to the point of creating
leverage in their business model. For these companies, I think what
you are seeing is an overall renaissance.</TE>
<TE>   Q: There are huge Internet companies that could have adopted your
business plan and run with it.</TE>
<TE>   A: We embed our functionality on more than 10,000 sites including
AOL, MSN, Yahoo and Lycos. If you want to buy a car and fill out a
form on those sites, the referral will still go through us to one of
our dealers.</TE>
<TE>   Q: And you share the referral fees with those sites?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes. It's a distributed-network marketing model.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why don't they just do it themselves and take the entire
referral?</TE>
<TE>   A: We invested $500 million in building a network of 9,000
dealers. It would be foolish for them to try and sell all those
dealers on a car-buying program. Just like it would be foolish for us
to try and out-market those huge sites.</TE>
<TE>   Q: If 60% of new car buyers use the Internet for research, why do
only 4% use your service?</TE>
<TE>   A: It has to do with the size of the transaction--it's the
second-largest transaction most consumers will make. It's also a
highly negotiated transaction, normally. So, it takes time for
consumers to become completely comfortable with the fact that this is
a way to purchase their next vehicle.</TE>

<LD>Defense spending, with the excuse of wartime, is out of control. The
House's vote Friday to boost military spending for next year above
the $379 billion requested by the Bush administration to almost $400
billion is beyond lavish and is blind to deficits. The most
conspicuous outrage is a bid to restore funding for the
obsolete-before-it's-built 42-ton Crusader howitzer.</LD>
<LD>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has made killing the Crusader
a test of his ability to transform the military into a lighter and
more mobile force. President Bush has rightly vowed to veto
legislation that would fund the Crusader, but creating a post-9/11
military that fights terrorism, not the old Soviet Union, will
require more sweeping cuts.</LD>
<LD>   Almost forgotten in Congress' rush to pour on the defense dollars
is that the original Bush budget proposal was already larded with
questionable weapons.</LD>
<TE>   As a presidential candidate, Bush pledged to "skip a generation"
of weapons systems so that new, unconventional weapons could be
funded. But last summer Rumsfeld ran into so much flak from the
military brass and Congress over his plans to hold down spending and
restructure the military that it looked as though he would have to
resign.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, Rumsfeld made a smashing comeback, including his
star turns explaining and defending U.S. military actions at
televised press conferences. But at the same time he largely gave up
trying to force Congress and the military to make painful choices
between old and new weaponry. The administration simply threw money
at the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Bush had declared during the campaign that he would cut funding
for redundant warplanes, but included in his proposed 2003 budget is
$12 billion for the Navy's Super Hornet, the Air Force's F-22 Raptor
and the Joint Strike Fighter. Then there is the $3 billion slated for
the Marines' beloved V-22 Osprey, a vertical-takeoff plane that keeps
crashing.</TE>
<TE>   But this wasn't enough for the House, which approved $3.2 billion
more than the administration requested to replace aging aircraft and
other weapons and $1 billion in Navy shipbuilding increases, not to
mention exempting the military from environmental regulations.</TE>
<TE>   But the first issue is the clunky Crusader, which Rumsfeld has
correctly called a Cold War relic that will hardly intimidate Middle
East terrorists since it is designed to bombard heavy troop
concentrations. It does not even exist yet in prototype, so no one
even knows if it would work as designed.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld wants to use the $11 billion budgeted for the Crusader on
high-tech weaponry like the Predator drone that was so effective in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The aim of the military cannot be to match a massively armed
adversary, nuclear missile for nuclear missile or plane for plane.
Instead, it has to plan for rapid dispatch to and nimble maneuvering
in the Third World. Spending should be focused on the so-called
transformational technologies--pilotless planes, precision munitions
and real-time information networks that give commanders instant views
of the battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   Congress and too many of the military brass are fighting old wars,
not the new one against highly mobile terrorism. Bush's veto of the
Crusader will restore strength to Rumsfeld's hand. The Defense
secretary should put everything he can into achieving the reforms he
promised soon after he came into office.</TE>

<LD>The state Legislature can strike a modest, reasonable blow against
global warming by passing the final version of a program for cutting
emissions of carbon dioxide from autos, pickups and sport utility
vehicles. Carbon dioxide is the chief greenhouse gas implicated in
global warming.</LD>
<LD>   AB 1058, by Assemblywoman Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills), passed the
Assembly earlier and won approval in the Senate last week. Now it's
back to the Assembly for ratification of Senate amendments as early
as today. Next stop: Gov. Gray Davis, for his signature.</LD>
<LD>   But it will be a fight to get it to Davis.</LD>
<TE>   The auto industry has waged a costly Chicken Little campaign of
misinformation. The sky will fall, the automobile makers say, if this
bill ever becomes law and the bureaucrats of the California Air
Resources Board are allowed to dictate what sort of vehicles we can
drive.</TE>
<TE>   This is the same campaign the industry waged against seat belts,
air bags and smog controls. They were wrong then and are wrong now.
European car makers already are embarked on a 25% reduction in carbon
dioxide emissions. AB 1058 does not require any controls until the
2009 model year and specifies that they must be economically and
technologically feasible and cause no harm to California business or
dramatic increase in the cost of vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The "bureaucrats" bemoaned by the propagandists are the same
experts who pioneered auto emission controls over decades--controls
that have cleaned up the state's air and been adopted worldwide. The
new standards would be subject to an automatic yearlong review by the
Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   California will not solve the problem of greenhouse gases and
global warming by itself. But Washington has abdicated its
responsibility in this area and California has an opportunity to take
the lead. The Assembly should chase away the Chicken Littles and vote
yes.</TE>

<LD>As the Bush administration rolled back many of the Clinton
administration's efforts to make the air less likely to cause lung
disease, to save the forests from plunder and otherwise to protect
people and the environment, the excuse often was that the previous
decisions weren't based on "good science."</LD>
<LD>   And if the experts support the science underlying a Clinton
decision? Apparently Secretary of the Interior Gale A. Norton sees
that as an impossibility.</LD>
<LD>   The issue is the National Park Service rule adopted in 2000 to ban
snowmobiles from Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks. It's an
excellent rule.</LD>
<TE>   Snowmobiles are noisy and polluting. Users of these machines have
millions of acres of national forest adjacent to the parks in which
to frolic. And the Park Service plans to offer over-the-snow buses
for anyone who wants to see Old Faithful in the winter.</TE>
<TE>   But the Bush administration reopened the issue at the behest of
snowmobile manufacturers and allied businesses and suggested
alternatives to the ban, including outright repeal.</TE>
<TE>   The Environmental Protection Agency was asked to comment, just as
it was during years of study leading up to the ban. An EPA deputy
regional administrator in Denver announced in late April that the
agency continued to support the ban because pollution coming from the
machines could violate air quality standards and pose health threats
to humans and wildlife. This position is, as an EPA official put it,
"entirely consistent with the stance the EPA has had through this
entire process." Good science, it appears, did not get altered by the
outcome of the 2000 presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, the official's letter announcing the decision took the
normal route straight to the Park Service, reportedly catching EPA
head Christie Whitman by surprise--and, hence, Norton too. Norton is
said to have fumed. Whitman since has ordered employees throughout
the country to route such matters through her office.</TE>
<TE>   If this is so that science can be put to the political test, the
Bush administration might note that the snowmobile ban is widely
popular, except with riders and the machines' makers and others who
think it will hurt business. The ban is, in other words, good public
policy and good politics. And good science is still good science.</TE>

<TE>   Re "No 'Forget It' in the Mideast," editorial, May 9: Israel had
just suffered the loss of 15 citizens near Tel Aviv, massacred by a
Palestinian suicide bomber. Yet the brunt of your editorial was an
angry condemnation of Ariel Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   What were his sins? He left Washington for Israel in order to deal
firsthand with the heightened security needs of his people, a
"spiteful luxury," in your words. Moreover, he declared that Israel
would "uproot the terrorist structure," a statement made solely, in
your opinion, for his own emotional satisfaction. When it comes to
your editorial board objectively analyzing Israel and its
democratically elected leader, I'll say forget it!</TE>

<TE>   Your editorial was based on an assumption that Israel would have a
reasonable, rational, sane and honorable partner with whom to
negotiate. This then implies that if there are no negotiations it is
the fault of Israel and the U.S. This is an absurdity. Every time
Israel goes to resolve the matter another suicide/homicide bomb goes
off.</TE>

<LD>Re "Pomeroy's Style Stayed Unchanged," May 8: The only thing wrong
with Martin Pomeroy's new title at the LAPD is that it has "interim"
in front of "chief of police." Pomeroy fits the profile of what we
need in that critical position perfectly: a law enforcement
professional who understands the need for community support of the
Police Department and a department that returns that support; a chief
who has the respect and admiration of the force, takes a thoughtful
approach to issues and is not afraid to assume a leadership role.</LD>
<LD>   I know him from his days as our deputy chief in the Valley, and
there's not a better cop around. Perhaps our gene-cloning scientists
could have a go at him: one Pomeroy to run the LAPD, a second to
retire in Montana.</LD>

<LD>Re "Mascot Bill May Snare Normans, Saxons Too," May 6: I am part

appalled that some would think it is an insult to have a Native
American name/logo used as a mascot. If anything, it is an honor.</LD>
<LD>   A mascot is something that is cherished and rooted for. Is it so
offensive to hear "Go Redskins" or "Win Redskins"? Truly, a
well-organized minority can make a law or change a law and not be
speaking for the rest of us. Even if the majority of Native Americans
in California are, in their bitterness of views, trying to eliminate
Indians from being mascots, they do not speak for this proud Indian
girl or many of my Indian friends, and I hope that they will not be
successful in this endeavor.</LD>

would debate weighty issues like the environment, immigration, taxes
and social spending.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing Democrats seem to disagree on is whether sodas
should be sold in schools or if team mascots with names like the
Vikings or Apaches are offensive. These issues should be decided in
student elections at the local schools, not by leaders of the
fifth-largest economy in the world.</TE>

<TE>   David Klump (letter, May 7) wondered if Assemblywoman Jackie
Goldberg's (D-Los Angeles) bill might be amended to include banning
the naming of vehicle models after Indian tribes, such as Tacoma,
Cherokee and Apache. What makes us think it will stop there?</TE>
<TE>   If a group is offended by a football team's name, next in line
will be streets, cities, parks, stadiums, rivers, lakes and on and
on, until one day our country will consist of only names of trees,
flowers, fruits and vegetables; generic and boring but nonoffending.
(Animal names will undoubtedly be out because of outcries from animal
rights groups.) Gone will be the colorful, descriptive names that
paint a picture of the history of our great country.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, we should never use a name to disgrace or humiliate any
person or race, but would the tribes have us obliterate every
reference to them until all will have forgotten they ever existed?</TE>

<LD>Well, thank you, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, for making the Justice
Department's position on the individual's right to own guns agree
with the Constitution ("U.S. Backs a Right to Bear Arms," May 8). It
is just a silly argument that the 1st and 3rd through 10th amendments
confer rights to individual citizens but the 2nd Amendment applies
only to militias. The people are, after all, the people.</LD>
<LD>   By the way, a pro-gun civil rights group has petitioned the
attorney general to enforce federal civil rights laws in California
and enter the courts against California's gun laws. This could be
fun.</LD>

<LD>It seems as though many people have forgotten the importance of
driving well. Recently I saw many potential accidents where the main
cause was speeding. I wonder, where is everyone going? What could be
so important to risk your life and someone else's?</LD>
<LD>   I do not think that people realize the danger they put themselves
and others in by forgetting the laws of the road in hopes of arriving
at their destination a few minutes earlier. If we could just slow
down our lives and stop to smell the roses, maybe then we could see
that we need to enjoy life, not speed past it.</LD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN GRIGSBY BATES</AU>
<BD>Karen Grigsby Bates is the correspondent for the
"Tavis Smiley Show" on National Public Radio. She lives in the View
Park area of Los Angeles.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Neuilly is a nice city, but even though it's the next Metro stop over
from Paris, it never will be known as the City of Lights. Tony
Bennett didn't leave his heart in Daly City. And drunks in karaoke
bars the world over don't croon: "If I can make it there, I'll make
it anywhere, it's up to you, New Rochelle.... "</LD>
<LD>   For the past several years, the San Fernando Valley has been
threatening to secede from Los Angeles. The city's gotten too big,
secessionists complain. Nobody pays any attention to us. The city
government is too unwieldy and there are, well, too many poor people
in L.A. Too many problems. We can do better.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe. Recent research has shown that secession is financially
feasible; the San Fernando Valley could function without being a part
of Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   But at what cost? Certainly L.A. would feel the loss of income,
the loss of political power and the loss of square footage and voters
that would demote it from the second-largest to the third-largest
city in the country.</TE>
<TE>   But Los Angeles wouldn't be the only loser. An ephemeral but very
real part of the cachet of living in a world-class city comes with
having to put up with the very things that make it world class: a
diverse, polyglot population; the mosaic of cultures and mores that
also brings tensions and problems. We possess our world-class energy
because people come from all over to be here, to try their luck here,
to give their children better chances. Here.</TE>
<TE>   So divorce the suburbs from Los Angeles and the city will lose
some important things--but so will the 'burbs. At the moment, all the
Outer Ring is seeing is a smaller geographic area with more economic
homogeneity; a kind of Statue of Liberty in reverse: "Poor? Hungry?
Huddled masses? There ya go, L.A.--good luck!" But it will also miss
the sparkle of the city's cultural institutions: its great public
library, its museums. Yes, folks, the Getty will still be in L.A., as
will the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of Contemporary
Art, the Taper, the Geffen and, eventually, the Disney. USC and UCLA?
Ours. Cedars-Sinai, UCLA Medical Center and County-USC: in Los
Angeles, thank you. Maybe there will be a discount for city residents
to use all these. Or visitors from other cities will have to pay
stiffer entrance fees.</TE>
<TE>   In the fervor to secede, Valley secessionists are greedily
envisioning the Newarkization of Los Angeles: Drive into the city,
work in its buildings, drop a couple of dollars for lunch, then
retreat to their chosen Valley neighborhoods with the bulk of their
tax dollars; leave behind a husk to be struggled over by the yellows,
blacks, browns and no-option whites.</TE>
<TE>   That would be penny-wise and pound-foolish. L.A. will survive and
ultimately prosper, with or without the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, L.A. will find a way to make up for lost
income--perhaps a series of toll roads at the critical entrance
points to the city or a commuter tax. Which would leave the
secessionists in the Valley to enjoy a smug isolation that suddenly
doesn't look like so much fun anymore.</TE>

<BD> Denise Hamilton, a former Times staff writer, is the
author of "The Jasmine Trade" (Scribner, 2001). She lives in
Glendale. E-mail: denise@denisehamilton.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long before Moon Unit Zappa introduced the term to popular culture, I
was a Valley girl. On sweltering summer days when the asphalt bubbled
and the mercury hit 114, my friends and I practiced cannonballs at
Verdugo pool in Burbank and axels at the ice-skating rink in North
Hollywood. Come September, I donned a blue plaid skirt to attend Our
Lady of Corvallis, a Catholic girls high school in Studio City that
the nuns have since sold to a Japanese business college. When classes
let out, we'd flounce in saucy clusters down to Ventura Boulevard for
ice cream at Sav-on and pastries at Weby's. That was my universe.</LD>
<LD>   It's not as if I never left the Valley. My immigrant mother took
us to Europe for visits, and we spoke French at home. The house was
crammed with dusty books, old 78s and antiques from my Aunt Sanya, a
Russian ballerina who had danced with the Kirov. Nonetheless, I was
quite provincial. Until I grew older and started going to nightclubs
on Sunset and museums in the city and volunteering at a soup kitchen
downtown, it never dawned on me that my private universe was part of
a larger public place called Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   It was intoxicating to discover I was connected by civic and
historical bonds to this larger, more dynamic and even dangerous
place. For a sheltered 16-year-old, it was liberating to realize my
identity wasn't defined solely by an arid valley of broad, flat
boulevards and tract homes. That my horizons weren't bounded by the
Verdugos on the east and the Hollywood Hills to the south. I had only
to drive over the hill and meld anonymously with a chaotic slipstream
of humanity, leaving the suburban me behind.</TE>
<TE>   Around this same time, my husband-to-be was growing up a world
away in El Sereno. But we shared something before we ever met: We
were both Angelenos.</TE>
<TE>   I became a journalist. Navigating the corridors of City Hall for
the first time, I felt overwhelmed by ghosts, a great clamoring
continuum of history--the good, the savage and the ugly. Fifteen
years and one career later, that sense of wonder and awe remains.</TE>
<TE>   My husband and I settled in Silver Lake, which combines many of
L.A.' s best elements. Two kids later, we outgrew our hillside home
and moved to the foothills of a rim city. My sister already lived
here, and we found a house a block away. Family became more important
than cool urban aesthetics.</TE>
<TE>   Now, from my perch overlooking the Valley and the L.A. Basin, I
watch the secession battle catch fire and I feel a sense of loss.
Being part of a great metropolis shaped my identity and my
perceptions of the world. It liberated me to become a writer and
inspired me to make L.A. a character in my novels.</TE>
<TE>   Despite having grown up in the Valley, it left scant imprint on my
psychic landscape. I wonder about that. And I worry about the turning
inward, the closing of doors, the denial of our universality that
secession would bring.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. is one of the world's great cities. It exists in our
collective unconscious and is embedded into our creative grid just as
surely as it is in the Thomas Bros. guides stashed in our cars.
Secession would deal a mortal blow to that identity, taking away
something precious that has nothing to do with geography.</TE>

<AU>GAR ANTHONY HAYWOOD</AU>
<BD>Gar Anthony Haywood's next crime novel, "Man-Eater,"
is due in January from Penguin Putnam. He lives in the Silver Lake
area of Los Angeles. E-mail: garhaywood@earthlink.net.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What, you mean the San Fernando Valley is actually part of Los
Angeles? When did this happen?</LD>
<LD>   As long as I can remember, Angelenos at both ends of the Sepulveda
Pass--which, by the way, is all the impenetrable moat any border
crossing should ever require--have treated "The City" and "The
Valley" as distinct and separate as North and South Korea. Divergent
nations. You need a survey map, a pack mule and a good excuse to
shuttle between the two.</LD>
<LD>   Secession would be nothing but a formality at best, endorsing all
the physical, cultural and psychological barriers that already
separate the Valley from Los Angeles proper.</LD>
<TE>   As it is, city folks talk about the Valley like a black hole that
friends and family sometimes get sucked into, as in: "Rob? He moved
somewhere out in the Valley, haven't heard from him since." Which
means, kiss ol' Rob good-bye, his lifeline to the space station just
broke and we are not going out there to bring him back.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Valley dwellers refer to the city like a death sentence
that is only rarely commuted: "Lucy went back to Mar Vista? Really?
Wow, that's rough." Which is to say, a move from Encino in any
southeasterly direction, for Lucy or anyone else, can never be an
upward one. It has to be part of some downward spiral--a demotion, a
backward slide, a humiliating indicator of personal or professional
collapse.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the little matter of simply getting from Point C
to Point V and vice versa. People talk about this excursion like it's
an adventure race through the Australian Outback. Ever tell somebody
who lives in Inglewood you'd enjoy their company on a drive up to Van
Nuys? "Van Nuys? Man, that's way out in the Valley, forget about it!"
Or ask a resident of Woodland Hills for a ride to City Hall?
"Downtown L.A. on a Friday afternoon? I don't think so, dude!"</TE>
<TE>   Short of mandating the installation of an electrified fence along
the length of the Santa Monica Mountains, how could secession
possibly enhance such well-balanced alienation?</TE>
<TE>   OK, so maybe, from a Valleyite's perspective, there are a number
of genuine economic rationales for secession: political autonomy,
improved public services, etc. etc.</TE>
<TE>   Yet if the primary point of the exercise, as some of us city
inhabitants suspect, is to lift suburbia above the
Mercedes-challenged driveways of the inner city, for heaven's sake,
save the effort. Because even without a fancy gateway bearing a new,
official city name, even a tourist can see that the Valley is the
only place to really live around here.</TE>
<TE>   All you have to do is count the Starbucks signs.</TE>

<BD> Richard Katz represented the Valley in the state
Assembly from 1980 to 1996. He is a member of the board of directors
of Valley VOTE.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the San Fernando Valley were to "leave" Los Angeles, where would
it go? Nowhere. To hear the rhetoric from Los Angeles City Hall, you
would think the Valley had a fleet of U-Hauls lined up.</LD>
<LD>   The Valley is not abandoning Los Angeles. Valley residents will
continue to work and play and spend money in L.A. We will continue to
root for the Lakers and to frequent L.A. restaurants. Angelenos won't
need a passport to visit people in the Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Valley independence is about core values: community,
accountability and quality of life.</LD>
<TE>   City Hall has largely ignored the Valley for many decades. Valley
residents get roughly one LAPD officer per 1,000 people, while the
rest of L.A. gets two.</TE>
<TE>   Valley taxpayers paid more than $1.8billion in Proposition A and C
funds to support the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, yet the
Valley has no mass transit system and only a stub of the Metro Red
Line. The rest of L.A. has the Red, Blue and Green lines.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley has half the libraries that the rest of L.A. has in a
comparable area.</TE>
<TE>   By forming an independent city, Valley residents can exert more
local control and focus resources at the neighborhood
level--improving local parks, preserving open space, improving
transportation, reducing crime and controlling gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Valley cityhood would increase accountability, both in the Valley
and in Los Angeles. Valley residents would have their own mayor and
city council members who live in the Valley. L.A. residents would
enjoy better representation because their council districts would be
40% smaller.</TE>
<TE>   Ethnic diversity would be enhanced. The Valley's rich mix of
ethnic voters, especially Latinos, would have new opportunities to
elect representatives. In L.A., both African Americans and Latinos
could gain political clout.</TE>
<TE>   Quality of life would improve if the Valley became an independent
city. L.A. spends a paltry 1% of its budget on housing and economic
development programs. Cityhood would allow us to focus resources
where needed.</TE>
<TE>   The law ensures that cityhood would not result in financial harm
to L.A. This has been confirmed by two independent studies, and L.A.
would continue to reap tax revenue from the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   An independent Valley would mean enhanced community
decision-making, greater accountability and an improved quality of
life--for the Valley and the city of L.A.</TE>

<HD>Breaking Up Is Hard to Do</HD>
<DH>The Question Isn't Whether the Valley Has What It Takes to
Be a City</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN RODERICK</AU>
<BD>Kevin Roderick, a former Times editor and a Northridge
native who lives in West L.A., wrote "The San Fernando Valley:
America's Suburb" (Los Angeles Times, 2001). E-mail:
kevin@americassuburb.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When people ask me about San Fernando Valley secession, as they do a
lot, they often have an incredulous tone: Do I truly believe that the
Valley really has what it takes to be a city?</LD>
<LD>   Usually, I just laugh. The question shows the pervasive cultural
distance that separates city folks and Valley folks. For every Silver
Lake or Leimert Park boho who cringes at the very thought of the
Valley, there's a counterpart in Reseda or Chatsworth who loathes
driving over the hill.</LD>
<LD>   There are reasons to be skeptical of secession as well as some
intriguing arguments for it, but the Valley's dearth of civic
accouterments isn't one of them. Sure, the Valley city would lack an
obvious downtown, at least at first. There's no opera or major art
museums, though there are scads of acting companies and a community
symphony. But so what? No one's offended by Santa Clarita or
Calabasas or Diamond Bar, yet none of those relatively recent cities
have a classic downtown or a preeminent institution.</LD>
<TE>   Let's face it. Of the 88 cities in Los Angeles County, the Valley
is larger and more populous--and more "qualified" for cityhood, in
terms of business and industry and potential--than all but one: Los
Angeles. Even Long Beach (population 461,522) is a baby compared with
the Valley (population 1.35million).</TE>
<TE>   History? As I found when researching my book on the San Fernando
Valley, history shows up in noteworthy ways in the annals of
California's Mexican era and water wars, the rise of aviation and
movie studios and, of course, in the emergence of suburbs as a way of
life.</TE>
<TE>   So the secession controversy isn't really about qualifications.
The Local Agency Formation Commission, which will decide later this
month whether the issue goes on the Nov. 5 ballot, already has found
that the Valley is so strong financially that it would have to help
Los Angeles with an annual payment in the tens of millions of
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves voters--in the Valley and citywide--a choice based on
emotion and details. Myself, I'll wait on the latter. The more I
absorb about local history, the less I accept the argument that
secession would violate the soul of Los Angeles, a city that was
compiled rather than nurtured, its growth often at the behest of the
powerful and against the wishes of the inhabitants.</TE>
<TE>   Even 87 years after it took the best deal and agreed to be annexed
to Los Angeles in order to share in aqueduct water from the Sierra
Nevada, the Valley has yet to be fully acculturated. Maybe it's time
to try another way.</TE>
<TE>   I said maybe. That's where the details I hope to hear during the
coming campaign will matter. Creating the sixth-largest city in the
country could be a rare opportunity or a colossal mess. I'm waiting
for someone to excite me with what is possible.</TE>

<LD>Re "Activist Hails 'New Dawn' in Myanmar," May 7: The release of Aung
San Suu Kyi from house arrest is wonderful news for democracy, and
the United States should immediately reciprocate by ending its
economic sanctions against Burma. The sanctions hurt mainly the
general populace instead of the intended target: members of the
ruling regime.</LD>
<LD>   Sanctions deprive the Burmese people of a chance to learn Western
technology and Western sociopolitical ideas like democracy. Of
course, sanctions wreak havoc on the economy. Burma was once a net
exporter of food, but today it is a net importer. Most of the
populace lives in poverty and squalor. Nonetheless, you can be sure
that the children of the ruling elite live well.</LD>
<LD>   Ironically, the Chinese government has treated its dissidents far
worse than the Burmese government, yet the U.S. has expanded its
economic relationship with Beijing. Key American politicians, like
the late Richard Nixon, have noted that political engagement and
economic prosperity foster the development of democracy. On these
grounds, the American government granted China permanent, normal
trade relations. The Burmese people deserve no less.</LD>

<TE>   I'm baffled by The Times' Orwellian terminology in describing the
release of Burmese Nobel Laureate Suu Kyi, in your May 6 and 7
headlines respectively, as a "dissident" and an "activist." A much
less misleading representation of her would be as "Burma's
democratically, overwhelmingly elected president, released by a
tyrannical military regime recognized, mostly, by a few greedy oil
companies."</TE>

<LD>Re "State's Auto Emissions Bill Is Just So Much Gas," Commentary, May
8: Convincing people to stop driving gas-guzzling cars is like
convincing a fat man to stop eating doughnuts. The man is going to
fight--even though his doctor has told him that eventually he'll have
a heart attack or diabetes. Well, the U.S. will face its own health
crisis if we don't reduce our consumption of oil. Detractors of
tailpipe emissions measures like AB 1058 say that such regulations
will eventually have us driving tiny little cars. Has anybody been to
Europe lately?</LD>
<LD>   Nothing but sexy little cars getting 50 miles per gallon. It's no
wonder Europeans think we're pigs; we drive 6,000-pound cars just to
move our body and a bag of groceries around. Then we go to war in the
Middle East to protect our sources of foreign oil so we can continue
driving our gas guzzlers. It's like a fat man fighting to keep eating
doughnuts. With conservation we can eliminate our need for foreign
oil. If each of us makes an effort, we'll all benefit.</LD>

<LD>I am profoundly disappointed by the decision by federal transit
officials to take the $155 million allocated to the Exposition Line
light rail project off the table ("Keep Westside Rail Alive,"
editorial, May 9). The benefits of the project are not limited to
giving people a comfortable and viable alternative to the congested
Santa Monica Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   "More Cities Look Inward for Growth" (May 5) made reference to
rail corridors as especially attractive areas for development,
affordable housing and revitalization. This is a simple but powerful
blueprint for planning growth in this era of gridlocked freeways and
urban sprawl. The value of these rail corridors grows exponentially
as the reach of the rail system expands. I eagerly await the opening
of the Pasadena Gold Line, but there has to be a corridor to the
Westside. Now is the time for all of our local leaders to pull
together to support this vital project.</LD>

<HD>Efforts Build to Shelter County's Farm Workers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a lack of low-cost housing forcing a growing number of Ventura
County farm workers to live out of cars and garages, a coalition of
growers, labor advocates and elected leaders has launched a campaign
to shelter those who supply the muscle for the county's $1-billion
farm industry.</LD>
<LD>   Skyrocketing housing prices and soaring rents are making it
tougher than ever for agricultural workers to find affordable places
to live, housing advocates say.</LD>
<LD>   But in what many are calling an unprecedented spirit of
cooperation, a push is on to counter that trend. At least three
committees are studying the issue, looking at everything from current
housing conditions to potential land-use strategies.</LD>
<TE>   And county planners are sifting through the results of a
comprehensive survey to determine farm-worker housing needs, a key
component of efforts to generate the money and support necessary to
build the first significant block of farm-worker housing in the
county in nearly a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absolutely disgraceful, and we've got to provide the
political will to solve this problem," said Supervisor John Flynn,
who is among those leading the charge. "There is a huge need and the
timing seems to be excellent to do something about it."</TE>
<TE>   Those efforts could receive a boost this fall, when California
voters weigh in on a $2.1-billion housing bond that would funnel $200
million into the state's primary farm-worker housing grant program.</TE>
<TE>   If approved, the money would become available at a time of
increased attention to rural housing conditions.</TE>
<TE>   That interest has been spurred in part by a growing belief that in
order to keep farmers in business--which Ventura County voters have
said they want to do through the adoption of farmland preservation
measures--steps must be taken to house those who work the harvest.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, one policy group reported last year that farm-worker
housing was in such dwindling supply that it threatens the stability
of the county's oldest and most prominent industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Since this community has voted to preserve agriculture, I think
there is a community obligation to make sure we are taking care of
that segment of the community that makes farming possible," said Rob
Roy, general counsel for the Ventura County Agricultural Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like all the stars are lining up," he said. "There are a
lot of people here locally, both within the agricultural industry and
outside of agriculture, working together to make this a reality."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's red-hot housing market has been tough on workers
in all sectors.</TE>
<TE>   Schoolteachers, biotech workers and corporate professionals all
have felt the squeeze of a housing market in which apartment
vacancies now stand at 2% and the price of a typical home is at an
all-time high of $312,000.</TE>
<TE>   But the housing crunch has been especially hard on low-wage
workers. And wages don't get much lower than those earned by farm
workers, who by some estimates make on average less than $14,000 a
year picking strawberries and plucking lemons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost impossible to survive on what we earn," said Marciano
Guzman, 28, a seasonal strawberry picker who pays $450 a month to
rent two rooms for himself, his wife and two children in a trailer in
south Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Guzman, who travels annually to Oxnard from his native Oaxaca to
work the strawberry harvest, said there are some months when more
than half his pay goes toward rent.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not right that we supply the food for people's tables, but
at the end of the day there is no place for us to live," Guzman said.</TE>
<TE>   Such sentiments are not unique to Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some Live in Cars, Converted Garages</TE>
<TE>   In agricultural outposts across the state, from cardboard
shantytowns near San Diego to open-air encampments in the San Joaquin
Valley, farm workers tell of living in slum conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's farm-worker housing survey, conducted by a
committee formed after supervisors highlighted the issue last year,
documented laborers living in cars, converted garages and cramped
apartments shared by two and three families.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,500 farm workers filled out the questionnaire. The
committee--made up of farmers, labor advocates and county
planners--is expected later this month to review the results and by
this summer to recommend ways to help meet identified housing needs.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the one thing anyone knows for sure is that the need far
outweighs the supply.</TE>
<TE>   The number of state-licensed farm labor camps has shrunk over the
last two decades, from 24 in 1983 to 18 today.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, no large-scale farm-worker housing has been built in
Ventura County since 1993, when Cabrillo Economic Development Corp.
opened the Rancho Sespe housing cooperative east of Fillmore.</TE>
<TE>   Retired lemon picker Tiburcio Juarez, 88, remembers well the
battles that raged over whether the project should be built at all.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said it would become a slum that would attract crime and
pollute the agricultural fields around it. They claimed farm-worker
children would vandalize farm property or be poisoned by pesticides.
They even voiced concern about whether the local cemetery would be
able to accommodate the residents.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the pastel-colored laborers' commune--owned and managed by
the 550 residents themselves--stands in defiance to such rhetoric, a
low-crime, high-pride hideaway surrounded by purple mountains and
green orchards.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course such places are necessary," said Juarez, who still
proudly displays on his living room wall a certificate signifying his
role on the founding committee. "How else are workers to live?"</TE>
<TE>   There is some evidence that public attitudes about farm-worker
housing may be changing.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time since it built Rancho Sespe, Cabrillo Economic
Development has several farm-worker housing projects in the planning
stages. They include 24-unit developments in Oxnard and Santa Paula.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the mix is a project that would raze a 1930s-era
collection of shacks in south Oxnard and replace them with
single-family homes and apartments exclusively for farm workers and
dedicated to the late labor leader Cesar Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   That project was made possible after former tenants won a
three-year legal battle over the slum conditions that had existed for
years. Tenants reported that raw sewage flowed from broken pipes,
rain leaked into the small wooden houses and rats and cockroaches
were plentiful.</TE>
<TE>   After winning a judgment in 1998 totaling nearly $400,000, the
tenants reached an out-of-court settlement in 2000 in which they each
received $10,000 and the land was sold at a cut rate to Cabrillo, the
county's leading builder of low-income housing.</TE>
<TE>   The housing developer this summer will seek a series of city
approvals to break ground on the $9-million project. Cabrillo already
has received a $400,000 grant from the city of Oxnard and a
$1-million commitment from the state's farm-worker housing grant
program to help cover those costs.</TE>
<TE>   "Of all the housing, farm-worker housing is arguably the most
difficult to build," said Cabrillo Executive Director Rodney
Fernandez.</TE>
<TE>   "There have always been some resources available to get it done,
there just hasn't been the political will to make it happen," he
added. "But I think public awareness about the problem is increasing
and there is now a willingness on the part of people to work together
to find solutions."</TE>
<TE>   That trend appears to be catching on statewide.</TE>
<TE>   Fueled by an infusion of cash into California's farm-worker
housing grant program in recent years, there is now more activity
than ever on the farm-worker housing front, state officials say.</TE>
<TE>   New projects have opened in the past six months in Santa Barbara,
the San Diego suburb of Escondido and the dusty farm town of
Coachella, southeast of Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   And many more are under construction or in the planning stages
across the state, housing officials say.*</TE>
<TE>   State Boosts Spending on Worker Housing</TE>
<TE>   Established in 1977, the state farm-worker housing fund only was
receiving $1 million to $2 million a year up until 1999. But starting
in fiscal 1999-2000, serious money started flowing into the fund,
including a $40-million allocation for fiscal 2000-01.</TE>
<TE>   About $80 million has been earmarked for the program since 1999,
said Judy Nevis, chief deputy director of the state housing
department.</TE>
<TE>   The housing bond measure, if approved, could add an additional $30
million a year over the next six years. That money would help produce
between 6,800 and 8,500 farm-worker housing units.</TE>
<TE>   "What has been done already is going to make a huge difference,"
Nevis said. "But certainly, as a result of the housing bond, we could
see some significant increases as well."</TE>
<TE>   Even with increased funding, however, it isn't going to be
easy--especially in slow-growth Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Housing advocates and others say to turn the talk into reality, it
will require residents to think differently about such issues as
where housing should be built and how many units should be allowed.
And they say it will require a forward-thinking commitment on the
part of county and city leaders to push past the NIMBYism (Not In My
Backyard) that so often prevents good ideas from getting off the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   Such issues have been under review for about a year by a
subcommittee of the Ag Futures Alliance, a group dedicated to keeping
agriculture alive and well in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Ellen Brokaw, co-owner of a Ventura nursery and a member of the
group, said the committee is preparing this summer to publish a
report chronicling the state of farm-worker housing and offering a
view of what should happen in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to use that as a springboard to make sure something does
happen," she said. "The community as a whole needs to make sure that
farmers can keep farming, and having an adequate labor force that is
adequately housed is a key element of that."</TE>

<HD>Unsung Defense Comes Up as Big as Bryant</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>The Laker defense had been one of the overshadowed elements of this
series, much like, um, the San Antonio Spurs.</LD>
<LD>   Just when the Spurs were about to get an attention-grabbing
victory and even this Western Conference semifinal series at 2-2
Sunday, the Laker defense beat them to the spot and drew the charge.</LD>
<LD>   Lakers' ball. Lakers' game. Lakers take a 3-1 lead with them back
to Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   "This team is not highly credited for their defense," Samaki
Walker said after the Lakers' 87-85 victory. "But when you've got
guys who really want to get after people when it's time to play,
we're capable of doing it. And we've done it several times."</TE>
<TE>   Most notably in the fourth quarter. The two teams have played four
fourth quarters--a whole game's worth--and in those 48 minutes the
Spurs have scored 62 points.</TE>
<TE>   What little attention the Spurs had received in the past week
focused on their inability to finish off their opponent in the fourth
quarter. The lowest of the low came in Game 4 Sunday, when they hung
a 10 on the board. That's great for gymnastics, but it's an
embarrassingly weak, Eastern Conference-worthy number in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Laker defense that gave Kobe Bryant the chance to put
another picture on his crowded shelf of postseason moments by scoring
eight points in the last three minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "It starts with the defense," Rick Fox said. "If we can hold a
team to 10 points in a quarter, very rarely are you going to see [the
Lakers] score fewer than 15 points in a quarter, or 20."</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs made only three of 18 shots in the quarter. The Spurs
scored one point in the final 6:14, which allowed the Lakers to
overcome a 10-point deficit.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers took the ball out of Tim Duncan's hands, dared anyone
else on the roster to beat them. And the rest of the Spurs weren't up
to the task. The guys who hit the biggest shots of the Spurs' 1999
championship run, Sean Elliott and Avery Johnson, aren't playing for
them anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what they have: Tony Parker's a 19-year-old rookie. Bruce
Bowen is a defensive specialist. Steve Smith is one of the culprits
in Portland's Game 7 meltdown two years ago and is having a terrible
series. Danny Ferry's right wrist is wrapped up like a mummy's.</TE>
<TE>   None of them looked as if they wanted to shoot when it mattered
most. And Duncan couldn't, because the Lakers decided that the fourth
quarter was going to be the time that they swarmed him.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, who had been so aggressive against mostly single coverage
throughout the game and had 30 points to show for his efforts,
managed only two shots in the fourth. He missed both, including a
desperation shot at the buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   He also missed three of his six free throws. And he committed a
costly charging foul, when Fox stepped in front of him on a fastbreak
in the final minute.</TE>
<TE>   That's the type of little stuff Fox and the Lakers did throughout
the game. They outrebounded San Antonio, 48-38, including a total of
11 from the unlikely sources of Fox and Derek Fisher.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the most memorable plays were offensive rebounds, and both
came on the Lakers' final offensive sequence.</TE>
<TE>   First, Shaquille O'Neal went high to grab a missed jump shot by
Robert Horry. O'Neal said his ailing ankles and toe weren't much
better, so that wasn't what allowed him to soar above rim level for
the first time in weeks.</TE>
<TE>   It probably was a combination of things. The urgency of the
moment. The embarrassment of having one shot swatted by David
Robinson and a point-blank dunk blocked by Duncan. And maybe even the
mind games of Phil Jackson, who in his latest bit of odd
psychological work compared O'Neal to both Dennis Rodman and Deputy
Dawg during a pregame media session.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I had to get it," O'Neal said. "I didn't feel like hearing
Phil's mouth."</TE>
<TE>   He had answered Jackson's criticisms earlier in the game by being
more active on defense and blocking three shots. And that last board
was his 11th of the game.</TE>
<TE>   With the second chance, Fisher took a jump shot that missed. But
Bryant soared through the air to grab the ball with his left hand,
then bounced back up for a layup around Robinson to give the Lakers
the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "We've known him to be a playmaker, a scorer," Fox said of Bryant.
"Now you can add big-time offensive rebounder to the list."</TE>
<TE>   As much as the Lakers have had to grind out their victories this
postseason, they wouldn't even have gotten the opportunity if their
defense hadn't kept them in games. And they've been pretty consistent
on that end of the court--at least more than they were during the
regular season.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers finished first in the fewest points allowed (94.1 a
game) and tied for ninth in opponents' field-goal percentage (42.4%).
But they still allowed 100 or more points 21 times--more than a
fourth of their games--and lost 14 of those.</TE>
<TE>   They have yet to give up 100 points in seven playoff games. The
Spurs shot 40% Sunday, which is about where they are for the series.</TE>
<TE>   "We still aren't playing great defense, to be honest with you, but
we're being competitive," assistant coach Jim Cleamons said. "Our
defense has gotten better during the playoffs. I think that's because
guys are able to focus and pay closer attention to the matchups, what
their assignments are.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting better, but we can't pat ourselves on the back just
yet."</TE>
<TE>   That's not the way they've been operating. And if you'll notice,
they haven't done too much celebrating after baskets, either. No
flexing from Kobe, few exaggerated stomps downcourt by Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   They're just getting back on defense.</TE>

<HD>Yankees Play Long Ball Against Twins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Facing Mike Mussina and playing without three starters Sunday, the
Minnesota Twins needed a strong outing from Rick Reed.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the New York Yankees teed off on Reed. They hit five home
runs in a span of eight at-bats and Mussina was tough on the Twins
again in a 10-4 victory to finish a three-game sweep at Minneapolis.</LD>
<LD>   "They had their hitting shoes on," Minnesota Manager Ron
Gardenhire said. "Everybody knows it. These guys can play."</LD>
<TE>   Joe Torre became the 17th manager to win 1,500 games, and the
Yankees had 18 hits to win their sixth in a row--all on the road.
They swept their first series at the Metrodome since May 17-19, 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Posada and Robin Ventura hit consecutive homers in the
fourth and Nick Johnson and Derek Jeter hit solo homers in the fifth
against Reed (4-2).</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, as crazy as it might sound, I thought Reed threw pretty
well," Gardenhire said. "Every time he made a mistake over the zone,
they hit it."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Giambi hit the most impressive of the homers--a two-run
blast in the fifth against Jack Cressend that landed in the upper
deck in right field and gave the Yankees a 7-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 5, Detroit 1--Chan Ho Park finally pitched in Texas, working
five innings in his first start since getting off the disabled list,
to help the Rangers extend their winning streak to four games.</TE>
<TE>   Park, the former Dodger right-hander signed by the Rangers during
the off-season, gave up one run and four hits, and struck out four.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers (18-19) are within one game of .500 for the first time
since Park lost the opener at Oakland on April 1. Park (1-1), who had
been on the disabled list because of a pulled right hamstring, threw
53 of 78 pitches for strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 4, Cleveland 1--Paul Byrd won again as the Royals
posted their first three-game sweep at home over the Indians in
nearly 17 years.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd (6-2) tied Mark Buehrle of the Chicago White Sox for the
league lead in victories and lowered his earned-run average to 2.77.
He gave up five hits and struck out five in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Royals' last three-game sweep at home over Cleveland came July
26-28, 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 11, Oakland 4--Carlos Delgado homered twice and Eric
Hinske hit a two-run homer at Oakland to help the Blue Jays win for
only the fourth time in their last 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   Delgado hit a two-run homer in the fifth inning against Cory Lidle
(1-5) and had a three-run drive in the ninth against former Toronto
closer Billy Koch.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 6, Baltimore 3--John Flaherty and Jared Sandberg had
run-scoring doubles during a three-run fourth-inning at St.
Petersburg, Fla., to help the Devil Rays win their second game in a
row.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay ended a franchise-record 15-game losing streak Saturday.
The Devil Rays have won consecutive games for the first time since
winning three in a row April 21-24.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 10, Seattle 4--Pedro Martinez struck out a season-high 12
at Seattle for the Red Sox, who began a long stretch without slugger
Manny Ramirez.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez, batting .372 with nine homers and 35 runs batted in, will
be out at least four to six weeks because of a broken left index
finger that could require surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Working on four days' rest instead of five for the first time this
season, Martinez (5-0) gave up one run and four hits in eight
innings.</TE>

<HD>Good Intentions Aren't Enough Against Angels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Troy Glaus wasn't surprised the Chicago White Sox intentionally
walked Darin Erstad to get to him with two out in the bottom of the
ninth and the potential winning run on second for the Angels.</LD>
<LD>   "With a base open, that's the right play," Glaus said. "With an
open base you can set up a force play. I expect it to happen 98 times
out of 100."</LD>
<LD>   Glaus, who was hitless in his previous four at-bats and hadn't
gotten the ball out of the infield, made the White Sox wish they'd
tried those other options.</LD>
<TE>   Glaus lined a fastball from Keith Foulke to left for a single that
scored David Eckstein, propelling the torrid Angels to a 5-4 victory
Sunday before a crowd of 19,251 at Edison Field. Eckstein, who had
been hit by a pitch and stole second, made a dramatic, head-first
slide but easily scored the run that stretched the Angels' winning
streak to five and their recent surge to 14 victories in 16 games.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody wants to be up in that situation," said Glaus, who had
been one for five against Foulke (0-2), the fifth Chicago pitcher on
a hot, summer-like afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a conscious effort to stay calm, to stay within myself and
put a nice short swing on it. The more times you're in a situation
like that, the more confident you're going to be."</TE>
<TE>   And the Angels, who outscored the White Sox, 30-7, in sweeping the
three-game series and have won 10 of their last 12 home games, are
suddenly confident they can score enough runs when they need to.</TE>
<TE>   They've swamped their opponents, 124-47, in their last 16 games
while also getting solid pitching. Starter Jarrod Washburn gave up
two runs and struck out three over 51/3 innings on Sunday, and Troy
Percival (2-1) finished with a hitless ninth inning to earn his
second victory--to go with two saves--in the last five days.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave up four runs today, but that's a good lineup over there,"
Manager Mike Scioscia said. "The biggest thing that has been
overlooked is we're still getting the consistent pitching to keep us
in ballgames."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn gave up an early run, on Carlos Lee's home run into the
left-field seats in the second, but the Angels rallied in the bottom
of the inning. First baseman Brad Fullmer walked and scored ahead of
Tim Salmon, who lined a 1-1 pitch to left for his fourth homer of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   A walk by Fullmer was the catalyst for another Angel run, in the
fourth. After falling behind in the count, 0-2, he walked and scored
on Salmon's double to left-center, giving the Angels a 3-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The White Sox cut that to 3-2 in the fifth. Kenny Lofton singled
and stole second, and Tony Graffanino walked. Lofton moved to third
and Graffanino to second on Frank Thomas' single to center, and
Lofton scored on Paul Konerko's single to right. Only a fine, leaping
catch by second baseman Adam Kennedy on Lee's liner and a popup by
Sandy Alomar spared the Angels additional damage.</TE>
<TE>   "He got up there," Scioscia said of Kennedy's grab. "That was
obviously a big play that he made."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn got the first out of the sixth inning but was fading. "He
was working hard for every out. They're a tough right-handed hitting
club," said Scioscia, who brought in right-hander Lou Pote from the
bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   Pote gave up Graffanino's leadoff homer in the seventh, which tied
the score, 3-3, and was Graffanino's first homer.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels regained the lead in the bottom of the seventh, but
were again unable to hold it.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando Palmeiro led off with a single to left. After Bengie
Molina flied out and Kennedy struck out, Eckstein walked, leading
White Sox Manager Jerry Manuel to bring in left-hander Damaso Marte
from the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad punched Marte's first pitch into left, scoring Palmeiro
without a throw home.</TE>
<TE>   The lead vanished in the top of the eighth. Al Levine got the
first two Chicago batters but Magglio Ordonez, hitting for Aaron
Rowland, drove a 3-2 pitch over the wall in left-center for the first
pinch-hit homer of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Not to worry, not with the newly resilient Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein didn't do much to get out of the way of the changeup that
struck his leg, but he attributed that to surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "It dove in on me," he said. "I didn't think it was going to hit
me."</TE>
<TE>   He stole second as Erstad swung and missed at Foulke's 1-and-0
pitch. The White Sox then walked Erstad, who was three for seven
against Fouke, and took on Glaus.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like pick your poison," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   For the Angels, Glaus' single was the perfect way to end another
productive day.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not surprised at all," Glaus said of the recent run bonanza.
"We know what we can do. It's a matter of making adjustments and
putting good at-bats together, and we've been doing that the last
two, three weeks."</TE>

<HD>Salmon Looking Better Than Average</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When Tim Salmon was batting .135 last month, he began to question
whether he was merely experiencing another typically slow start or if
the nightmare he endured last season had resumed.</LD>
<LD>   "I started out knowing I was going to come around," he said, "then
I started hoping."</LD>
<LD>   Salmon has more reason to believe last season's .227 average was
an exception and won't be the rule.</LD>
<TE>   Salmon homered and doubled in his first two at-bats Sunday to
reach base safely in seven consecutive plate appearances and extend
his fledgling hitting streak to five games. Although a .231 batting
average isn't much to brag about for a career .285 hitter, Salmon
believes that with the help of hitting coach Mickey Hatcher, he's
regaining his equilibrium.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a nice feeling to get in the position where I'm getting
some good passes at balls and I'm putting it into play," said Salmon,
who is nine for 16 during his hitting streak and has hit in 13 of his
last 19 games. "I hit a slider out, and I'm hitting pitches that were
mistakes....</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a high-maintenance, mechanical-swing kind of guy. A month
from now, I may be swinging different."</TE>
<TE>   As long as he's swinging well, Manager Mike Scioscia is happy.</TE>
<TE>   "Tim has looked good the last couple of weeks," Scioscia said,
"and hopefully we're getting him into a confidence zone where he's
going to continually produce.... We need Tim there for us. He's going
to be fine."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Troy Percival earned his second win in five days by pitching a
hitless ninth.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't strike out the side, as he had in two of his last three
appearances--he gave up a leadoff walk to Kenny Lofton and an
intentional walk to Paul Konerko--but he got the job done.</TE>
<TE>   He also agreed with Scioscia's decision to walk Konerko, who had
singled twice in four previous at-bats. "You've got a force at every
base," said Percival, who ended the inning by getting Carlos Lee to
fly to center.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the second straight Sunday, outfielder Garret Anderson started
at designated hitter and Brad Fullmer played first base. Scioscia
said he plans to restore Anderson to the outfield Tuesday at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just trying to get him off his feet," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer's nine-game hitting streak ended, but he walked twice.</TE>

<HD>Headfirst Slide Costly for Ramirez, Red Sox</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boston slugger Manny Ramirez is expected to be sidelined at least
four to six weeks with a broken left index finger that could require
surgery, Red Sox team doctor Bill Morgan said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Ramirez, leading the majors in batting at .372, broke the finger
Saturday night when he crashed into Seattle catcher Dan Wilson's shin
guard on a headfirst slide.</LD>
<LD>   Ramirez traveled to Boston on Sunday and was examined by Morgan, a
hand specialist.</LD>
<TE>   "The bone is going to require at least four to six weeks to heal,"
Morgan said. "My gut feeling right now is that it may require
surgery."</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez will undergo further tests today to determine whether
surgery is necessary.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox, who have a major league-leading 25-9 record after
defeating Seattle on Sunday, are expected to put Ramirez on the
15-day disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't going to bring a player out here just for one day,"
Manager Grady Little said. "We don't play again until Tuesday so we
can get it done before we get home."</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Mike Port said it was likely that the Red Sox
would put Ramirez on the disabled list and add a player soon. "That
would be my assumption, yes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mark Quinn, who had been sidelined since late February because of
a broken right rib, was activated by the Kansas City Royals.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to play a lot," interim Manager John Mizerock said.
"He can hit. Everybody knows that."</TE>
<TE>   Quinn, who won batting titles in the Texas League and Pacific
Coast League, has a .285 average with 43 home runs in 270 major
league games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit Tigers recalled catcher Matt Walbeck from triple-A
Toledo of the International League.</TE>
<TE>   Walbeck replaced Brandon Inge, who separated his shoulder on a
slide into second base during Saturday night's game against the Texas
Rangers and was put on the 15-day disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota Twins activated designated hitter David Ortiz from
the disabled list after Sunday's game against the New York Yankees
and optioned catcher Matthew LeCroy to triple-A Edmonton of the PCL.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz, whose career has been slowed by injuries, has been out
since April 19 because of a bone chip in his left knee that required
arthroscopic surgery. He's batting .236 with four homers and four
runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   LeCroy, who has filled in as designated hitter during Ortiz's
absence and also played first base, batted .322 with two homers and
eight RBIs.</TE>

<HD>Devil Rays Didn't Treat Him Much Like a King</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Tampa Bay Devil Rays ended their 15-game losing streak Saturday
night.</LD>
<LD>   Now they can take the pins out of Stephen King's photo.</LD>
<LD>   Seems the Devil Rays decided the prolific author of horror novels
was jinxing them: They were only a game under .500 when their streak
began April 25 as King, a noted baseball fan, took in a game at
Tropicana Field.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think I'm a jinx," King told the Tampa Tribune. "They
said Babe Ruth was a jinx to the Red Sox [after being traded to the
Yankees.] I never believed that, either. I'm a 55-year-old man with
bad eyesight. I've got nothing to do with this."</TE>
<TE>   King, a self-proclaimed Devil Ray fan, points out the team
committed an error when the players stuck pins in the photo from the
jacket of "Misery."</TE>
<TE>   "They picked the wrong book," he said. "They should have picked
'The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.' That's my jinx book. After it came
out, I had my [automobile] accident. And [sore-armed Cub reliever]
Tom Gordon hasn't been the same since."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What is the major league record for longest losing
streak?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What's that quacking sound? Ron Wilson, the original coach of the
Mighty Ducks, was fired last week as coach of the Washington Capitals
after five seasons--a geologic era for an NHL coach.</TE>
<TE>   He lost the Duck job after the team's first playoff run, largely
because of a personality conflict with former team president Tony
Tavares. He lost this one a month after owner Ted Leonsis insisted
Wilson would be back despite failing to make the playoffs with a
roster that included Jaromir Jagr.</TE>
<TE>   All we remember is what happened the year after the last time
Wilson was fired: He took the Capitals to the 1998 Stanley Cup
Finals.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the Ducks--looking for a coach and no longer under the helm
of Tavares--ought to consider playing the nostalgia card.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gordon marriage hits wall: So wrote the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution in a story on NASCAR star Jeff Gordon's divorce
from his wife of seven years, Brooke, a former Miss Winston.</TE>
<TE>   Florida court papers reveal that Brooke cited only "marital
misconduct," reports Al Levine of the Journal-Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   "That is a broad-brush charge in Florida, covering everything from
an affair to his refusal to mow the lawn. No one in racing has
revealed anything about the cause of the breakup, but this is an
industry that thinks fidelity is part of a stereo system."</TE>
<TE>   She wants the $10.5-million South Florida mansion--a sprawling,
23,000-square foot estate with property taxes of $180,139 last
year--as well as the Porsche, the Mercedes 600 SL and use of the
boats and the plane.</TE>
<TE>   Guess Jeff gets to keep the Chevy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The Philadelphia Phillies lost 23 in a row in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Gordon--who according to a tabloid report dallied
with a perfume sales clerk--has been seeking solace in the company of
fellow NASCAR driver Tony Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been able to hang out and ride go-karts together," Stewart
told a television interviewer. "He's kind of the Jeff of old, the
Jeff that we missed. I mean we've been hanging out together playing
video games. It's been a lot of fun."</TE>

<HD>It's Irbe Time for Carolina</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Goaltender, starting for the first time in five
games, stops 30 shots and Hurricanes win, 5-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Maybe Paul Maurice really does have two No. 1 goaltenders.</LD>
<LD>   Martin Gelinas, Rod Brind'Amour and Ron Francis scored early in
each period for Carolina, and Arturs Irbe returned to play
brilliantly in net as the Hurricanes beat the Montreal Canadiens,
5-1, Sunday to take a 3-2 lead in their best-of-seven Eastern
Conference semifinal series.</LD>
<LD>   Irbe, starting for the first time in five games after being
benched by Maurice in the New Jersey series in favor of Kevin Weekes,
was nearly flawless, stopping 30 shots. With 12 minutes left and the
home team up by three, the record crowd of 18,853 was once again
chanting his name.</LD>
<TE>   "We've got something special going on here, and because of that,
you want to be on the ice," said Irbe, who stopped 17 shots in the
second period with Carolina holding a two-goal lead. "Everybody
dreams of being that guy who makes the difference and makes the
winning happen.</TE>
<TE>   "Bench-warming is not the most fun thing, but you know you can be
called upon at any time and you've got to keep positive. It's not an
easy job, but that's why I've survived several different coaches."</TE>
<TE>   Irbe lost what would have been his first career postseason shutout
with 5:28 left when Karl Dykhuis scored.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if you have that anywhere, where two guys support
the team," Brind'Amour said of the two goalies. "They can't be happy
with getting yanked in and out, but we've got to go with who is hot.
It's the playoffs and that's what it's all about.</TE>
<TE>   "Archie has been professional about it and Weeksie has been great.
He's the biggest cheerleader out there. That says a lot about the
individuals."</TE>
<TE>   Carolina had won only one playoff series in its history prior to
this season, but can clinch the series with a win tonight at the
Molson Centre in Montreal, where the Hurricanes rallied from a
three-goal deficit to win Game 4.</TE>
<TE>   "Their backs are against the wall and they're going to come out
like a caged animal--I'm sure of it," Bates Battaglia said of the
Canadiens. "They're going to be flying and we have to be ready."</TE>
<TE>   Gelinas and Brind'Amour scored early in the first and second
periods, then Irbe and the stellar Carolina defense spent the rest of
the time frustrating a slumping Montreal offense.</TE>
<TE>   Francis tied the franchise record for career playoff points (31)
held by Kevin Dineen when he poked in his own rebound on the power
play 3:40 into the third to help clinch the victory.</TE>

<HD>Celtics Are Too Tough</HD>
<DH>NBA playoffs: Walker scores 30 points and Pierce gets 25 as
Boston beats Pistons, 90-79.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The Detroit Pistons couldn't stop Antoine Walker and Paul Pierce--not
at the same time, anyway.</LD>
<LD>   Walker had 22 of his 30 points in the first half and Pierce had 23
of his 25 in the second half Sunday as the Boston Celtics beat the
Pistons, 90-79, to move within one victory of the Eastern Conference
finals.</LD>
<LD>   "We feel like we could close this series out," said Pierce, who
had a career-high 17 rebounds, and had six assists and three blocked
shots. "We don't want to give them any breathing room. If we keep
going like we have, I don't think there's a team in the NBA that can
beat us."</LD>
<TE>   Pierce picked up his second foul with eight minutes left in the
second quarter and sat out the rest of the half, leaving the offense
to Walker and Tony Delk. Relegated to the bench for a shooting slump
that limited him to eight points in the first eight playoff games,
Delk had 15 points in the first half and 16 total.</TE>
<TE>   "Antoine looked so strong in the first half, we just kept on going
to him because he had the hot hand," Celtic Coach Jim O'Brien said.
"And Tony Delk. It doesn't surprise me that he had a very good game.
His work to try to find his way out of this has paid off."</TE>
<TE>   With luminaries such as Bill Russell, Red Auerbach and Bob Cousy
watching, Boston took a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series. Winners
of an NBA-record 16 titles, the Celtics have never blown a 3-1 lead
in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics haven't been to the conference finals since 1988, when
they lost to the Pistons. They could wrap it up in Detroit in Game 5
on Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as we have life, we're going to keep fighting," said
Piston Coach Rick Carlisle, who as a player went to the NBA Finals in
each of his three seasons with the Celtics. "We're going back home to
a building we like to be in, with great fans, and we're going to keep
battling."</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Robinson scored 24 points, Jerry Stackhouse had 16 and Ben
Wallace had 21 rebounds for Detroit, which lost its 10th consecutive
road playoff game. It was the 10th consecutive home victory for
Boston.</TE>

<LD>The UCLA softball team defeated second-ranked Arizona on Friday, then
clinched the Pacific 10 Conference title Saturday. What did it get
for its efforts Sunday? A 3,000-mile trip to Columbia, S.C.</LD>
<LD>   Despite being ranked No. 1 in the nation and increasing efforts to
host an NCAA regional, the Bruins were sent to South Carolina as the
top seed in the six-team regional. In fact, no No. 1-seeded team will
host any of the eight regionals. Big West champion Cal State
Fullerton (50-11) got a top seeding but will head to Stanford.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins (50-6) did not get a regional despite putting $40,000
into installing lights at Easton Stadium to comply with a 1999 ruling
by the NCAA Softball Committee mandating that host teams have lighted
facilities. Arizona, Louisiana State, Texas, Washington, Nebraska and
Florida Atlantic also earned top seedings.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After being held to five runs in two losses to Long Beach, No. 15
Cal State Northridge (36-16, 16-5) salvaged the final game of a
three-game baseball series Sunday by scoring seven runs in the eighth
inning for a 10-8 victory. The Matadors took a two-game lead in the
Big West Conference. No. 17 Fullerton (34-17, 14-7) had pulled to
within one game of the lead with two wins over UC Riverside (28-23,
8-10) but dropped one back with Sunday's loss. UC Irvine (31-22,
12-6) stayed in the title hunt by taking the final two games against
Sacramento State, winning, 10-6 and 4-3. Meanwhile, Pepperdine
(28-28, 16-11) took control of the Coast Division of the West Coast
Conference with a four-game home sweep of St. Mary's. The Waves have
a two-game lead over Santa Clara.</TE>

<LD>   What: "She's Got Handle"</LD>

<TE>   Nicole Louden, a basketball phenomenon from Paterson, N.J., in the
late 1990s, at one time had her pick of colleges to play for. She
received her first recruiting letter from Florida State when she was
in the seventh grade.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Zagoria, who covers women's basketball for the Herald News in
West Paterson, chronicles Loudon's prep career, capturing all of
Louden's emotional highs and lows, successes and failures, in "She's
Got Handle: The Story of Nicole Louden's Triumph Through Inner-City
Basketball."</TE>
<TE>   Set in the drug-infested, near-poverty conditions of Louden's
hometown, Zagoria relates how the player's on-the-court prowess
helped her get past those dangerous neighborhood conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The book also examines the crossroads that women's basketball now
face. Will the women's game mirror the mistakes of the men's
game--recruiting players so early that childhood takes a back seat to
basketball, and crossing the line from aggressive to illegal
recruiting practices?</TE>
<TE>   Zagoria, a graduate of the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism,
provides first-hand, compelling accounts of intimate conversations
between Louden and her family, coaches and recruiters.</TE>
<TE>   A superstar among her New Jersey peers, Louden, primarily a point
guard, ran into problems when pitted against players ranked much
higher than her nationally. A series of injuries and other missteps
eventually dropped Louden from the nation's elite. She ended up
settling on Auburn, which showed late interest in her. She is now a
freshman there.</TE>
<TE>   Her quest now: honing her skills for her ultimate dream--playing
in the WNBA.</TE>

<HD>Marlins Walk On Nomo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers lead the major leagues in pitching, though they seemed to
forget that Sunday in an 11-3 loss to the Florida Marlins at Pro
Player Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   They ended the trip with one of their worst performances of the
season from a starter, getting another ineffective outing from
right-hander Hideo Nomo and shaky relief work from Jeff Williams
before 7,930.</LD>
<LD>   Florida broke the game open with a four-run fifth inning, taking a
7-2 lead and chasing Nomo (2-5), who was given a two-run cushion in
the first. Nomo had command problems again, repeatedly falling behind
early in counts and dropping his third in a row.</LD>
<TE>   "I have to take responsibility," pitching coach Jim Colborn said.
"His timing was off, it became poor, and I wasn't able to tell him
what to do to get his timing back together. He just never adjusted."</TE>
<TE>   Nomo gave up eight hits--including the first home run of the
season for No. 8 batter Mike Redmond--and seven runs (six earned) in
42/3 innings. He walked four and struck out five, throwing 65 strikes
in 108 pitches, and lost a decision to the Marlins for the 10th
consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   In last Tuesday's 6-5, 16-inning victory over the Atlanta Braves
at Turner Field, Nomo walked five in five innings, throwing 61
strikes in a 104-pitch no-decision.</TE>
<TE>   "The main thing is just to get ahead and throw more strikes, I
think that's important," Nomo said Sunday through an interpreter.
"I'm not too sure, specifically, what the problems are. I do know I
need to work on some things."</TE>
<TE>   Marlin starter Ryan Dempster (2-3) needed only 110 pitches,
including 74 for strikes, in tossing his second complete game of the
season. Dempster also helped himself with a run-scoring triple in the
fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Williams had a rough time in his first appearance since being
recalled from triple-A Las Vegas. The left-hander was pounded for
four hits--Mike Lowell's seventh homer among them--and four runs in
the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Center fielder Dave Roberts suffered a right thigh injury that
might force him out of the lineup, and the Dodgers finished 3-3 on
the trip after taking the first two from the Braves. It was not the
finish the Dodgers envisioned after such a strong start, and the
biggest problem was their starter.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to sit here and talk about his approach publicly,"
Manager Jim Tracy said of Nomo. "But what I will say is this: Strike
one is a very important pitch. It's not the type of pitch, it's
strike one, and it doesn't matter if it's Hideo Nomo or [any other
Dodger starter]. Strike one is a very important pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have as devastating a split-finger as he has, it's very
important that he affords himself an opportunity to get to that
pitch. If you throw ball one and ball two to major league hitters,
you are allowing them to narrow their scope and use less of the
strike zone. Then it becomes much more difficult to succeed up here.
Very simple."</TE>
<TE>   Things were most difficult for Nomo and the Dodgers in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Leading, 3-2, the Marlins got consecutive singles from Preston
Wilson and Cliff Floyd, putting runners on the corners. Wilson tagged
and scored on Lowell's sacrifice fly to right and Derrek Lee flied
out.</TE>
<TE>   It appeared the Dodgers would get out of the inning when Eric
Owens grounded to first, but umpire Jerry Meals ruled that the
sliding Owens beat Eric Karros to the bag, enabling Floyd to advance
to third and extending the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Redmond then doubled to right-center to drive in Floyd and Owens,
and Dempster's run-scoring triple ended Nomo's work. Omar Daal
continued his outstanding work out of the bullpen with 11/3 perfect
innings, but it didn't matter.</TE>
<TE>   "He was out," Karros said of Owens. "The replays showed he was
out. It was a tough play, but he was out.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not much you can do with that because it's a situation
where, unless the pitcher is covering, I've got to wait for the ball
to get to me. Otherwise, I'm running past first base.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way I'm going to run past, and then run back, and beat
a guy. We went about that play the best way we could. Like I said, we
got him by a bit."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Patience Still Is the Plan With Offense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers are doing it the traditional way, relying on pitching and
defense during their surprisingly strong start.</LD>
<LD>   They have the major leagues' lowest earned-run average, top
fielding percentage and have committed the fewest errors.</LD>
<LD>   And then there's the Dodger offense.</LD>
<TE>   Beginning play Sunday, the Dodgers were tied for the third-fewest
runs in the National League at 132. General Manager Dan Evans and
Manager Jim Tracy knew the Dodgers would not be among baseball's top
run producers, but they have performed below expectations because
heart-of-the-order batters Shawn Green and Brian Jordan have
struggled.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not important how many runs you score, it's just that you
outscore the opponent," Evans said. "While our offense hasn't been as
good as our pitching and our defense, hitting is more cyclical than
pitching and defense. Our pitching and defense has been very
consistent and given us a chance to win almost every game we've
played this year."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy has shuffled the lineup in an attempt to jump-start the
offense, moving Paul Lo Duca to the cleanup spot behind Green and
trying other combinations. However, Tracy is not ready to try
anything radical, and Evans is preaching patience.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not concerned because, as the players have said themselves,
we haven't hit yet the way were going to hit," he said. "Down the
line we'll hit. We won't be an offensive machine, we're not going to
be the best offensive team in baseball and we knew that going in, but
we do think that we've got enough hitting to compete here. Once some
guys find their niche, we're going to be pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center fielder Dave Roberts said he suffered a right thigh injury
while grounding out in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts, replaced by Hiram Bocachica in the eighth, will be
reevaluated by team medical personnel today.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's kind of the same thing I had in spring training that
caused me to miss some time," said Roberts, two for four with a run
scored in Sunday's 11-3 loss to the Florida Marlins at Pro Player
Stadium. "I don't know how bad it is. Hopefully, it's not too bad."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trade talks have not heated up because officials are still
evaluating their clubs, but two National League general managers said
Sunday they doubted the Dodgers would pursue the top available
position players because of many factors.</TE>
<TE>   Evans is still dealing with the payroll mess he inherited from the
former regime, and will be beyond this season, limiting moves. The
Dodgers, as in recent seasons, have many high-salaried players with
no-trade clauses, further complicating the process.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, the Dodgers are not willing to trade the few
prospects in the farm system who interest other clubs, and third
baseman Adrian Beltre is still on the untouchable list.</TE>
<TE>   "We've only played [37] games, so you have to let some things play
out a little bit," Evans said. "We could use an extra hit here or
there, but there's a lot of clubs saying that same thing at this time
of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we looking at things? We're always looking at things, but
right now I wouldn't say there's anything hot. Most clubs aren't in a
real trading mood right now. It's a little too early in the season."</TE>

<HD>Dusting Off the Welcome Mat for L.A. Chargers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A one-take recap of the news after sitting out writing practice all
week. I mean, as Allen Iverson says, "We're talking about practice."</LD>
<LD>   News item: Chargers to move training camp to Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Second thought: Here's hoping the permanent move is all over
except for the city council shouting and renting of Ryder trucks.</LD>
<TE>   We'd like to be the first semiregular Monday column to welcome the
Chargers back to Los Angeles; let's show the Lightning Bolts a little
more love this time, huh?</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Chargers were a charter American Football League
franchise and played the 1960 season at the Coliseum before following
the swallows south.</TE>
<TE>   Tidbit: The first regular-season touchdown in Charger history was
scored Sept. 10, 1960, a 46-yard pass from Jack Kemp to Ralph
Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   A little backdrop music, please.</TE>
<TE>   It was a Saturday, in the city of Angels. Bill and I were working
a bingo fraud case out of day watch. There was trouble at the
Coliseum, a report of a vendor selling ice cream without a license.
That's where I come in. I carry a badge.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Sgt. Friday, the crime that day was that only 17,724
showed up to watch the Chargers defeat the Dallas Texans, 21-20. One
account reported fans looked like "splotches of acne in the
100,000-seat Coliseum."</TE>
<TE>   How did we know the Charger offense, coached by Sid Gillman, was a
prototype of the modern San Francisco 49ers?</TE>
<TE>   What's more, that Charger kickoff staff was a veritable Manhattan
project of football minds. Among the men surrounding Gillman were Don
Klosterman, Chuck Noll, Jack Faulkner and a young assistant looking
to make a name for himself: Al Davis.</TE>
<TE>   What would a franchise relocation story be without Al Davis?</TE>
<TE>   Davis joined the Chargers as offensive ends coach, and brought
with him a trusty administrative sidekick, Al LoCasale.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, according to some accounts, tried to take credit for being
architect of the Charger offense.</TE>
<TE>   In "Slick," Mark Ribowsky's unauthorized biography of Davis,
Gillman scoffs at this notion: "We were throwing the ball when Al
Davis was peeing in his pants."</TE>
<TE>   To make a short story short, the Chargers went 10-4 in 1960,
losing the AFL title game to Houston. Sadly, only 9,928 fans bothered
to attend the team's division-clinching victory at the Coliseum,
prompting Charger owner Barron Hilton to take his ball down the
coast.</TE>
<TE>   We promise better fan support this time.</TE>
<TE>   Honest.</TE>
<TE>   OK, maybe.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   News item: Seattle Slew dies at 28.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Here's the behind-the-scenes skinny on the former
Triple Crown winner's life and death: The colt could be moody and
aloof and mostly kept to his side of the barn. As an interview Slew
was as tough as horseshoe nails, rarely uttering anything you could
print. Incredibly, the chomp champ never discussed any of his Triple
Crown victories and kept his prolific private life private. Insiders
say Affirmed was much more approachable in the paddock, whereas Slew
let his actions do the talking, sort of like Steve Carlton.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   News item: Mike Tyson's public relations firm quits less than a
month before lucrative fight with Lennox Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Tyson handlers moved fast to find a new PR firm.
We stumbled upon this solicitation in the latest edition of the
fictional trade daily, "Boxing Reporter." Wanted: Firm to take over
publicity for Mike Tyson. Must have general command and understanding
in the fields of dentistry, ear nose and throat, psychiatry,
misogyny, tax law, damage control, anger management, spin doctoring,
statute of limitations laws and Miss Teen contests. Must enter into
contract believing everything bad that has happened to Tyson's life
can be explained as the result of former trainer Cus D'Amato's death.</TE>
<TE>   Must be prepared to bandage any news conference wound, pay for
hotel damages and execute "Fight Canceled" news release at moment's
notice.</TE>
<TE>   Payment, as always, subject to purse being held by state's boxing
commission.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   News item: Colorado Rockies are storing baseballs in humidor to
prevent them from drying.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Hmmm. The New York Yankees may want to try this on
bench coach Don Zimmer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   News item: San Jose Sharks using dehumidifier to keep ice from
getting slushy.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Like I've always said: In sports, it's not the
feat, it's the humidity.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   News item: Shaquille O'Neal promotes new Burger King meal known as
"the Shaq Pack."</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce, order a gurney
to come get us. If Shaq-food reports to camp looking like a sumo
wrestler next fall, we'll know why. Any idea how many clogged
arteries are in play here?</TE>
<TE>   Shaq's stock answer: "Ask Phil, he knows everything."</TE>
<TE>   Ever vigilant in the pursuit of news, we phoned Burger King
headquarters in Miami to get the nutritional information on the "Shaq
Pack," a burger-bacon-cheese-on-sourdough concoction we guessed
correctly would have Richard Simmons "sweatin' to the oldies" for the
next 25 years if he ate one.</TE>
<TE>   Pack facts: The sourdough burger alone checks in at 770 calories.
Add 370 calories for the medium order of fries and 120 calories for
the extra cheese dipping sauce and you get a grand caloric total of
1,152. And that's assuming you order a calorie-free diet drink.</TE>
<TE>   The "Shaq Pack" has 76 grams of fat and 3,110 milligrams of sodium
or, roughly what a backhoe can dredge from the Great Salt Lake in an
hour.</TE>

<TE>   Second thought: Forget the fight. I'm tuning in to see "the tale

two or three "Shaq Packs" a day.</TE>

<KH>CHARTING THE LEAD: A look at the Lakers' lead or deficit by
the minute</KH>
<HD>SAN ANTONIO VS. LAKERS/ GAME 4 REPORT</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FIRST QUARTER: LAKERS 25 SAN ANTONIO 25</LD>
<LD>   Highlight reel: Shaquille O'Neal versus David Robinson is a
compelling matchup no matter where they play. Neither is at his best
physically, which makes it all the more intriguing. Give the
advantage to Robinson in the early going. He ran better than his
balky back allowed him in Game 3. He also played the same stout
defense he did Friday, holding O'Neal to six points and two rebounds.
Robinson dropped in a couple of jumpers and dunks and tipped in
Antonio Daniels' missed shot in 10 minutes--five more than he played
in the first quarter Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: The Spurs needed to be flawless to even the
series and, in the early minutes, they were clicking. But the Lakers
quickly warmed to their task. The result was a crisply played first
quarter, perhaps the best 12 minutes of the series.</LD>
<TE>   Winning numbers: Robinson's eight points and three rebounds were
just the sort of early surge the Spurs needed.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: Two points, two assists and two fouls in eight
minutes for Kobe Bryant, who led the Lakers' fourth-quarter charge in
Game 3.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Robert Horry 8, O'Neal 6; Spurs--Robinson
8, Tony Parker 7.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Horry 4, O'Neal and Derek Fisher 2;
Spurs--Robinson 3, Tim Duncan and Malik Rose 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SECOND QUARTER: LAKERS 42 SAN ANTONIO 46</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: This was Duncan's quarter. He showed why he was
selected the league's MVP, scoring nine of the Spurs' 21 points.
Nothing fancy, but Duncan seems to excel at the finer points of the
game. Getting to the free-throw line six times, and making five, was
just what the Spurs needed to take a small lead by halftime. The
Spurs couldn't seem to hit anything in the quarter, but the Lakers
couldn't either and all that separated the teams at the break was
Duncan's superb play. It didn't hurt that the Spurs continued to live
at the line, shooting 10 free throws in the quarter to two for the
Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: The leadership Duncan showed was a reminder
of why the Spurs were a dangerous team going into Game 4. Nothing
will come easily for the Lakers unless they find a way to bottle up
Duncan. When all else fails, he seems to be the one San Antonio
player capable of keeping them with the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: Four points, the Spurs' halftime advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: Bryant's three-for-10 shooting in the quarter was
troubling for the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 7, O'Neal 6; Spurs--Duncan 9,
Parker and Daniels 4.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Bryant and Rick Fox 3; Spurs--Robinson
4, Rose 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THIRD QUARTER: LAKERS 67 SAN ANTONIO 75</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Another monster quarter for Duncan resulted in a
huge momentum surge for the Spurs. Duncan worked his magic with and
without the ball. With it, he made jumpers and free throws, helping
the Spurs to a 10-point lead late in the quarter. Without it, he
helped the Spurs keep O'Neal and the Lakers from making a charge. Not
to be overlooked: Bryant's jumper rimmed out at the buzzer or the
Lakers would have been within five points at quarter's end.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: A reasonable explanation for the flagrant
foul whistled on O'Neal against Daniels late in the quarter. O'Neal
appeared to get a good chunk of the ball and perhaps a bit of his
body on Daniels, but there was no reason for it to be judged anything
more than two free throws. It sure got the crowd of 32,342 worked up,
booing O'Neal as if he had banned margaritas from the restaurants
along the Riverwalk.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: Twelve, the number of free throws the Spurs shot
and made.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: Three and nine, Bryant's baskets and shots.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 9, Bryant 7; Spurs--Duncan 12,
Steve Smith 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Samaki Walker 3, O'Neal and Fisher 2;
Spurs--Duncan 3, Robinson 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH QUARTER: LAKERS 87 SAN ANTONIO 85</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Fisher's 18-foot jumper to beat the 24-second
clock was too long. Bryant appeared from nowhere, leaping over Parker
to snare the rebound. He must have landed and then launched himself
over Robinson, but it happened so quickly that it simply didn't
register. In a flash, he scooped the ball into the basket to give the
Lakers a two-point lead with 5.1 seconds remaining. At the other end,
the Spurs hoped to counter by getting the ball to Duncan. He got it,
all right, but only after Terry Porter stumbled and fumbled it to
him. Duncan's desperation shot at the buzzer was short of the mark.
It was, however, a fitting summary of what happened to the Spurs
during another fourth-quarter meltdown. San Antonio scored 10 points
in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Are those springs on Bryant's sneakers? Are
those available in stores or only through a special offer on
late-night TV? Just curious. Did he get up on the winning basket or
what?</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: The Lakers closed the game with a 13-1 surge.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: The Spurs' 16.7% shooting (three for 18).</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 12, Horry 5; Spurs--Duncan and
Bruce Bowen 3.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Horry and O'Neal 5; Spurs--Duncan 4,
Robinson 2.</TE>

<HD>Maruyama Gets His Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shigeki Maruyama spent most of the final round Sunday staying out of
trouble with delicate chips and clutch putts in the Byron Nelson
Classic at Irving, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Tiger Woods staged another charge that ultimately fell short.
Then, Maruyama had to watch another late rally from an unlikely
source in the group ahead, rookie Ben Crane, who followed an eagle
with a 21-foot birdie putt on No. 17.</LD>
<LD>   The Japanese star managed to hold it together, though, closing
with a two-under 68 for a two-stroke victory over Crane. Woods
finished third.</LD>
<TE>   Maruyama capped off his second PGA Tour victory with a routine par
on the final hole, thrust his arms in the air and bowed to tournament
host Byron Nelson when he walked to the scoring trailer.</TE>
<TE>   Maruyama finished at 14-under 266 to earn $864,000 and entry into
the U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Annika Sorenstam, confident she had played her best, could only
stand and watch from the scorer's tent. She didn't expect Pat Hurst
to make a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam matched the course record with an eight-under 64 and won
the Aerus Electrolux USA Championship at Franklin, Tenn., when Hurst
hit into the water and bogeyed No. 18.</TE>
<TE>   They shared the lead most of the day, matching birdies despite
wind gusting to 20 mph. The turning point came at the par-five 18th.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam, playing two groups ahead of Hurst, got to the front of
the green in two, chipped to four feet and made the birdie putt to go
to 17 under.</TE>
<TE>   Hurst birdied No. 17 to go to 17 under and learned that she and
Sorenstam shared the lead. A strong drive left her 199 yards to the
green, but her three-wood shot drifted right, hit the bank and
splashed into the water. She then chipped across the green, leaving
herself a 25-footer for par.</TE>
<TE>   She came up short, giving Sorenstam her third victory in seven
LPGA Tour starts this year and fourth win overall this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When he woke up twice Saturday night to the sound of thunder,
Bruce Lietzke figured he might be on the verge of winning a
tournament without even swinging a club. He was right.</TE>
<TE>   Unrelenting rains made the course unplayable and Lietzke, whose
eight-under-par 64 Saturday gave him a two-stroke lead, was declared
the winner of the Senior Tour TD Waterhouse Championship at Kansas
City.</TE>
<TE>   Lietzke, 50, finished with a 36-hole total of 11-under to win
$240,000. Larry Nelson, whose 66 on Saturday left him two strokes
behind Lietzke, collected $140,000.</TE>

<HD>That MVP Doesn't Stand for Much in Home Stretch</HD>

<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>Regrets, they have a few.</LD>
<LD>   Competitiveness is never a question with the San Antonio Spurs,
who started the Western Conference semifinals on the road, without
David Robinson, and still scared the daylights out of the Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   But then there's the question of the Spurs' ... uh ... poise.</LD>
<TE>   Sunday, for the fourth game in this series, the Small-Market Team
That Could, At Least Until the Fourth Quarter, gasped to a halt at
the end, this time blowing a 10-point lead in the last 4:55 and
losing, 87-85, to the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs, who had scored 19, 15 and 18 points in the fourth
quarters of the first three games, had 10 in this one. If they had
won the games they've led going into the final period, they would
lead the series, 3-1, which is a lot different from their current
predicament, trailing, 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   In case they don't feel bad enough, they went down with their guns
in their holsters.</TE>
<TE>   Or: Anyone heard that "MVP!" chant around here lately?</TE>
<TE>   Through three quarters, Tim Duncan, their newly crowned and
deserving MVP, had 27 points, having made nine of 13 shots. In the
fourth, he took only two shots, missed both, and scored three points.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, he took only one in the last 4:55 as the Spurs' 10-point
lead faded away ... his desperation 21-foot, turnaround, no-chance
heave at the end of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "What he did was the best he could do," Spur Coach Gregg Popovich
said. "Whatever he did, that's what you go with.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, if you kick it out of the post and it goes in, it's a
great play and if it doesn't, everybody thinks somebody made a
mistake. He's a decision maker for us. He's our quarterback."</TE>
<TE>   Popovich, of course, was being nice to his franchise player. This
turned out to be nicer than the franchise player felt like being to
himself. Asked if he wished he had taken the ball at the Lakers at
the end, Duncan, speaking softly and without hesitation, answered,
"Absolutely, yeah.</TE>
<TE>   "I turned down a couple looks a little earlier than I should have.
I was trying to be patient, I was trying to find the open people. I
should have just been a little more selfish and taken it myself."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers, who don't have anyone who can guard him, did their
best to mess up his mind, with a brilliant-accidental strategy of
playing him one-on-one for three periods, during which Duncan
embarrassed Robert Horry and Samaki Walker, laying up the ball over
them time after time ...</TE>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson doesn't like to double-team, but at the
end had no choice but to bring help and lots of it.</TE>
<TE>   So Duncan, who'd had an easy time for three quarters, had to start
thinking in the fourth. Because his teammates seemed to start
swallowing with more difficulty the later it got, every time he
passed the ball out of the post, it led to a bricked shot or a
turnover, meaning every decision he made turned out wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "In the fourth quarter, you pay him the respect he deserves," the
Lakers' Rick Fox said. "It's hard with three guys hanging on you. If
he wants to shoot that, we welcome that."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if you're Popovich, Duncan is the least of your
problems. The Spurs' coach has two days before Game 5 to restore the
confidence of his other players, who ran out of it Sunday, and they
don't sell it at convenience stores.</TE>
<TE>   "I have two feelings," Popovich said. "I'm really proud of our
team for the way they competed. The other feeling is, we've got to
maintain composure and shoot shots that are good shots. And if we
shoot 'em, believe they're going in in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "We had five or six shots that were either ill-advised or not shot
with confidence and you can't do that.... Down the stretch, people
who take shots have to make sure they're good shots and they've got
to believe they're going in....</TE>
<TE>   "You have to give the Lakers credit, because they're a great
defensive team.... but you still ought to be able to score more than
we are. We've got to step up and do that. We're making enough stops
to win these games, especially against a hell of a team, but in the
fourth quarter, there can't be turnovers against this team and you've
gotta make some shots. The margin of error is just too small."</TE>
<TE>   Not anymore. There is no margin of error for the Spurs, a loss
from elimination, with Kobe Bryant cooking and peace having
ostensibly broken out between Shaquille O'Neal and Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Some seasons it ends like that and for the Spurs, a lot of the
recent ones, having to surmount the Lakers, who have two superstars
to their one. If one of the big Lakers is limping, in a snit, or
both, they have another.</TE>
<TE>   If the Lone Spur guesses wrong, well, it's only five months to the
start of training camp.</TE>
<TE>   So Duncan gets an "A" as a stand-up guy and an "incomplete" as a
go-to guy. It's no way for an MVP to start the summer.</TE>

<HD>Luck Holding Up for Sky Jack</HD>
<DH>Hollywood Park: Comeback from knee surgeries, illness
continues for 6-year-old, who wins $150,000 LeRoy Handicap.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even if Sunday's $150,000 Mervyn LeRoy Handicap at Hollywood Park had
been restricted to 5-year-olds and older, it would have had a good
field.</LD>
<LD>   The 23rd LeRoy drew six horses and five veterans--four 6-year-olds
and a 5-year-old--and fastest of all Sunday was the favored Sky Jack,
who's 6 years old and lucky to still be here.</LD>
<LD>   Laffit Pincay, who at 55 rode Sky Jack to his 51/2-length win, had
won three previous runnings of the stake, but none since 1989.</LD>
<TE>   No horse older than 6 has won the LeRoy, and the only 6-year-olds
before Sunday to do it were Budroyale in 1999 and Marquetry in 1993.
Budroyale, only recently retired, was a horse with a bad back, a
minor ailment compared to the problems of Sky Jack, who has had
surgeries on both knees and twice had stomach operations for colic.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a horse that requires high maintenance," trainer Doug
O'Neill said. "I'm fortunate that the owners [Rene and Margie
Lambert, who have a farm near Temecula] are as patient as I am.
They've always given him whatever time it takes to recover."</TE>
<TE>   Sky Jack's dicey days came after he won the Native Diver Handicap
at Hollywood Park in December 2000. The gray California-bred son of
Jaklin Klugman and Sky Captive underwent his second knee surgery, and
a few months after that, in July, almost died from colic. His weight
dropped 200 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked like a gray dog that hadn't eaten in weeks," O'Neill
said.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen months after the Native Diver, Sky Jack was back, running
second in an allowance race at Santa Anita, and O'Neill concedes that
he ran him too soon after that as he finished last in the Santa Anita
Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   Pincay got Sky Jack rolling right out of the gate Sunday and after
brushing off two rivals at the top of the stretch, the only question
was the margin. With Bosque Redondo running second, two lengths ahead
of Devine Wind, Sky Jack hit the wire in 1:411/5 for 11/16 miles and
paid $5 to win.</TE>
<TE>   He has seven wins, two seconds and two thirds in 13 starts, with
Sunday's pot of $90,000 sending his earnings past the $475,000 mark.
The $750,000 Hollywood Gold Cup on July 14 is in O'Neill's sights.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, when he got hurt, I thought I had the best horse in
the country," Pincay said. "After [the Santa Anita Handicap], I was
wondering if he was ever going to get back to where he had been.
[O'Neill] took his time with him, which was really good. Today, every
time I touched him with the whip, he responded. He just loves this
track [four wins in as many starts], and I'm looking forward to the
Gold Cup."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With no commitment from trainer Neil Drysdale, it's beginning to
look as though Sunday Break will not run in Saturday's Preakness.
Sunday Break, who missed the oversubscribed Kentucky Derby because he
was short on graded stakes earnings, would be the third or fourth
choice, after Derby winner War Emblem and Medaglia d'Oro, if he ran.
Drysdale might be thinking Peter Pan and Belmont Stakes for Sunday
Break, the same two races that his A.P. Indy won in 1992....</TE>
<TE>   If Sunday Break doesn't run in the Preakness, Gary Stevens could
ride Straight Gin for trainer Nick Zito. Chris McCarron has landed
the mount on Zito's other horse, Crimson Hero.... Victor Espinoza,
who rode War Emblem in the Derby, won two races at Hollywood Park
Sunday, the day after he was aboard Drysdale's Flying Dash, a
11/2-length winner in the $250,000 Hawthorne Derby on grass.... Van
Rouge, trained by John Shirreffs for Jerry and Ann Moss, shipped in
from Santa Anita for a convincing win in the $100,000 Ascot Handicap
at Bay Meadows. Ridden by Jason Lumpkins for the first time, the gray
colt took six races to break his maiden and was running in stakes
company for the first time since that first win April 19. Van Rouge
paid $6.80. Doc Holiday finished second and Hecandigit was third.</TE>

<HD>Rain Puts a Crimp in Indy Qualifying</HD>
<DH>Auto racing: Several major teams still seeking a place in
the field after cancellation because of weather. Luyendyk has only
one try left.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Indianapolis 500's "Bump Day" took on added significance when
persistent showers Sunday wiped out the second of three scheduled
qualifying days for the May 26 race.</LD>
<LD>   Nine positions in the 33-car field remain to be filled before the
bumping process can begin Sunday, and there are a number of
outstanding driver-car combinations still not in the race. Forty-six
cars, including backups of qualified drivers, remain eligible.</LD>
<LD>   Most prominent among the outsiders is Arie Luyendyk, 500 winner in
1990 and 1997, who aborted two qualifying attempts Saturday and now
has only one try left in the No. 55 G Force-Chevrolet. If he fails
again Sunday, the car will be disqualified, but Luyendyk could try to
make his 17th 500 in another of the Treadway-Hubbard team cars.</LD>
<TE>   "Things have not been going well," said Luyendyk, who is making
the Indianapolis 500 a one-race season while holding down his main
job as an analyst for ESPN Radio. "First, we had to put in an engine
from Rick Treadway's backup car after [Saturday] morning practice,
and things never got any better."</TE>
<TE>   On his first attempt, Luyendyk waved off a 227 mph because "I did
not want to accept a speed in that range and the car felt loose."</TE>
<TE>   Two hours later, after rookie teammate Treadway was safely in with
a 228.039 speed, Luyendyk went out again.</TE>
<TE>   "The car got loose on me, and I had to get out of throttle so much
in [Turn] 3 that it ruined the run. I had to abort again.</TE>
<TE>   "We brought the car back to the garage and put it on the setup pad
and then went back out to practice. We talked about it and decided we
ought to try one more time."</TE>
<TE>   In a dramatic last-ditch attempt to be a first-day qualifier,
Luyendyk rolled on to the track at 5:58 p.m., two minutes before
qualifying ended, but was waved off by the crew before he took the
green flag.</TE>
<TE>   A mistake by someone on the crew had caused a tire-pressure sensor
to give a false reading that the right-front tire was low.</TE>
<TE>   "We had the front-tire sensors swapped," chief mechanic Skip Faul
said. "They had the right tires on but the wrong wheels, so the
sensors were not reading the correct pressures, and we thought we had
a flat. When we got in [the pits] there was nothing wrong, but by
that time the gun had gone off."</TE>
<TE>   How frustrating was it to have Sunday's entire day washed out?</TE>
<TE>   "It gives us another four days to get ready," Faul said. The track
will be closed today and Tuesday with practice resuming Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike NASCAR Winston Cup, where former champions get provisional
starting positions if they fail to qualify, open-wheel racing has no
such loophole. For instance, 1986 winner Bobby Rahal failed to
qualify in 1993 and Roger Penske's team of defending champion Al
Unser Jr. and two-time champion Emerson Fittipaldi both missed in
1996.</TE>
<TE>   A.J. Foyt, who has won four times as a driver and once as a car
owner with Kenny Brack, has yet to put a car in this year's race.
Both of his drivers, Greg Ray and Airton Dare, pulled in after
posting 225 mph laps Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   It was yet another day of frustration for Ray, the 1999 Indy
Racing League champion. When the season started, he was named as a
teammate to Scott Sharp on the well-funded Kelley Racing team. Just a
little more than week before the season opener March 2 at
Homestead-Miami, Ray was replaced by Unser Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, Foyt chose fellow Texan Ray to drive his No. 11
Dallara-Chevrolet, replacing Chilean veteran Eliseo Salazar, who
suffered a torn artery during car testing April 16 at Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Ray immediately became one of the prerace favorites for the pole
after having had one pole and three other front-row starts since
1998. However, a postqualifying inspection found a front shock had
failed on Ray's attempt Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Another high-profile entry from CART, Team Green's Paul Tracy and
Dario Franchitti, is not among the 24 qualifiers. Nor is Formula One
veteran Johnny Herbert, who may face a conflict because he is
scheduled to drive Sunday for Champion Racing in the American Le Mans
Series event at Sears Point Raceway in Sonoma, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to do Sears Point because I want to do it for Champion and
for myself, but obviously I want to do it here too," said the Hebert,
a three-time Formula One winner who won this year's 12 Hours of
Sebring for Audi in the ALMS series. "I don't want someone else to
get in the car and qualify, because then you'll have people saying,
'He's got someone else to qualify and then he gets back in it to
race.' I want to prove the point that I can do it, for one. The only
way I can do that is to do it, so I've got to work out the scenario
to do both."</TE>
<TE>   Also still hoping to catch a break are the two minority-owned
teams from Southern California, 310 Racing's George Mack of Inglewood
and Latrell Sprewell Racing's John de Vries of Newport Beach. Each
made one attempt Saturday, but De Vries was waved off before taking
the green flag, and Mack called his run off after two laps in the
224-mph range.</TE>
<TE>   "We have kind of reached a plateau, and we're looking for a little
bit more," said Mack, who is hoping to become the second African
American driver in the 500. Willy T. Ribbs raced in 1991 and 1993.</TE>

<HD>Now Agassi Reigns in Rome</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BUD COLLINS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>Et tu, Andre.</LD>
<LD>   With a tennis racket rather than a dagger Andre Agassi lit up
Caesar's town Sunday by dispatching a troublesome antagonist called
the Italian Open.</LD>
<LD>   A long time of fear and loathing of a dirt patch beside the Tiber,
Il Foro Italico, dating back 15 years, was ended as No. 9-seeded
Agassi fell on No. 7 Tommy Haas. The brutal score, 6-3, 6-3, 6-0,
caused a gathering of 6,500 to hail Agassi and wiped out sour
memories of a tournament he called "the most important after the four
majors."</LD>
<TE>   "There's so much history here," Agassi said. "It was something
missing for me, a title I really wanted and came so close to winning
13 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "To come back and do it after 13 years away from the final is a
dream."</TE>
<TE>   From a narrowly thwarted 19-year-old to an at-last fulfilled
32-year-old, it has been quite a bumpy Roman journey for Agassi,
whose first taste of the tawny soil at the Foro was stomach-turning.
As a kid tourist, his first time abroad, he wasn't thinking about
such sights to be seen as the Catacombs--but he felt like a resident
thereof after being put away by Argentina's Martin Jaite in the
second round.</TE>
<TE>   "I was 17, it was 1987," he said, "and I'd never seen red clay."</TE>
<TE>   Quickly homesick for his native asphalt, he lamented that, "Roman
clay didn't seem right for tennis. Movement was difficult. It was too
slow. I'd hit four great shots in a row--and the ball would still
come back. There were a lot more downs than ups for me here.</TE>
<TE>   "Especially 1989. I thought I understood clay then. I had it won,
but ... "</TE>
<TE>   But at match point, 5-4 in the fourth with a 2-1 lead in sets,
Agassi couldn't get that last point against an Argentine banger,
bull-chested Alberto Mancini. Mancini took the set in a tiebreaker,
and the fifth, 6-1. Since, Agassi had never advanced past the third
round. Until this year.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Bollettieri, then the coach of Agassi and today the coach of
Haas, has said that Agassi, frosted, tanked the last set in 1989. It
wouldn't have seemed beyond him during that less dedicated stretch of
his career--but Agassi denies it.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened was the crowd really got behind Mancini as he
rebounded," he said. "I got dejected, discouraged and was just a kid.
I wasn't experienced enough not to let the crowd take me out of it."</TE>
<TE>   The experience, plus the finely honed physical toughness, is
showing. Agassi is the third oldest man to carry Rome, following
37-year-old Bill Tilden in 1930 and Australia's Rod Laver, a
four-months-older 32 in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi, raising his ranking from No. 9 to No. 5, was in danger of
losing a set only one time in the tournament, that coming in a
tiebreaker to Argentina's Agustin Calleri in the third round. During
six victories his greatly improved serve, precise at critical
moments, was broken only three times, the last by Haas to reduce his
second-set lead to 4-3. Retaliating immediately, Agassi sprinted
through the next eight games to the title.</TE>
<TE>   This was Haas' tale of woe after the baselining duel.</TE>
<TE>   "Andre has such quick hands and feet that he puts you on the
defensive right away," Haas said. "He wears you down. He makes you go
right left, right left, left right, left right again and again. He
makes you doubt yourself and try to serve and make shots too good.</TE>
<TE>   "He was my idol when I was 13 and met him, and he still is for his
dedication. He keeps improving."</TE>

<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>On two unstable ankles and a toe as flexible as a two-by-four,
Shaquille O'Neal took the rebound over two San Antonio Spurs that
led, finally, to Kobe Bryant's game-winning shot Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "I knew I had to get it," O'Neal said. "I didn't feel like hearing
Phil's mouth."</LD>
<LD>   Phil Jackson had suggested last week that O'Neal rebound more,
criticism meant as constructive and taken as critical. Since then, on
the wings of Jackson's mouth, O'Neal has 26 rebounds in two games.</LD>
<TE>   On the Lakers' final possession, their first attempt to beat the
Spurs was Robert Horry's, from the right corner, his usual spot. His
shot hit the rim. The rebound bounced high and long, and O'Neal went
higher than he'd been in months to grab it.</TE>
<TE>   "I got my shot blocked a couple of times. I knew we needed that
rebound, so I went up and got it," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal made nine of 18 shots for 22 points and had five assists,
two in the fourth quarter that set up Bryant jumpers. Generally, he
was displeased again with his game, but suggested he had scheduled
extra treatment for his ankles and toe.</TE>
<TE>   "I was active. But I didn't have the explosion I usually have. But
I will have that on Tuesday," he said. "I'll have the explosion on
Tuesday. I've got a little secret working that I'm going to see on
Monday. He'll fix me up and I'll be ready on Tuesday. It's important
that we play good, solid basketball and try to close this team out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jackson has dealt with strong personalities. Asked if O'Neal's
reminded him of anyone, he broke out an old Chicago favorite.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll probably take it wrong, but it's a little like Dennis
Rodman," Jackson said. "Dennis was a person you wanted to deliver a
message to individually. He'd miss it in a mass meeting if you spoke
in generalities. If you spoke in metaphors he'd certainly miss it.
So, a lot of them had to be direct exchanges.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the time, [O'Neal] is right on cue. We connect before
ballgames, usually to see how he's doing."</TE>
<TE>   Told that O'Neal is a practice regular, Jackson defended Rodman.
Sort of.</TE>
<TE>   "Dennis went to all the practices," he said. "I never had trouble
with Dennis in practices. Sometimes we had to send Jack Haley to go
get him. But he came."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Horry, who felt he was fouled during a drive to the basket in Game
3 but got no call, told of a conversation he had with an official.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't call it, because you were out of control," Horry said
the referee told him.</TE>
<TE>   To which Horry responded, "How do you know I'm out of control?
Maybe I'm just an awkward [guy]."</TE>

<DH>Game 4: Bryant's spectacular rebound and put-back caps
frantic fourth-quarter rally that lifts L.A. to a two-point victory
and 3-1 series lead.</DH>

<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>If the Lakers' third consecutive championship comes, it will have
been won in the places that tighten men's jump shots, and widen their
eyes, and shorten their breath.</LD>
<LD>   That's for most men. The San Antonio Spurs, for certain. But not
Kobe Bryant, it would seem.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant, 23 going on something like Jordan, something like West,
pulled the Lakers back from defeat Sunday afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   He scored 10 points in the final five minutes, the last two on a
rebound and put-back with 5.1 seconds left, and so the Lakers, 87-85
winners at the Alamodome, returned to Los Angeles with a
three-games-to-one lead in the best-of-seven Western Conference
semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Team owner Jerry Buss, who sat across the floor from the Laker
bench, stood and grinned and said after his team's 11th consecutive
road victory in the playoffs, "That was something else." And it was.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were 10 points behind with 4:55 remaining, and tied,
85-85, with 2:10 remaining. Bryant, who put the Spurs and their
35,000-plus fans through the same agony two nights before, made two
three-pointers within 43 seconds of each other and then, with time
running out, maintained a dribble at the top of the key.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd howled and the Spurs, who missed 15 of 18 fourth-quarter
shots and scored 10 fourth-quarter points, tightened, and widened,
and shortened, because these were the moments in which they failed
against the Lakers before.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always one or two things that turn the whole game around,"
Spur center David Robinson said. "And that is what we need to stop."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Duncan, the league most valuable player, scored 30 points but
missed both fourth-quarter field-goal attempts, the second after
scooping up a loose ball/push pass from Terry Porter and heaving it
20 feet when it needed 21 at the buzzer. Rookie Tony Parker had 15
points, two in the fourth. Robinson, in 10 fourth-quarter minutes,
did not score.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been in every type of situation imaginable, so we know what
it takes in a hostile environment such as this one," said Laker
center Shaquille O'Neal, who played through two sprained ankles, an
arthritic toe and a stitched finger for 22 points and a critical late
rebound. "We showed a lot of heart, a lot of composure, and we got
two."</TE>
<TE>   All of that, the Laker run and the Spur fade, the possessions
where the Lakers forced Duncan to relinquish the ball to teammates on
the perimeter--decisions Duncan later said he regretted--finally left
Bryant with the ball, the score tied.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what I live for," he said. "I've dreamed of these
situations countless times as a kid. Still dream of it to this day.
So, it's fun to play in this type of environment, this situation."</TE>
<TE>   A funny thing happened on his way to breaking the Spurs' hearts.
He dribbled the ball off his foot. As he and defender Bruce Bowen
chased the loose ball toward mid-court, Derek Fisher dashed in and
scooped it up.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing that came to mind was to look at the shot clock,"
Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher took the ball to the middle and pushed a left-handed jumper
from 17 feet that banged off the front of the rim. In the lane, where
7-footers abounded, Bryant rose up and took the rebound with one hand
with seven seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   He rose up again, now within four feet of the rim, and flipped the
ball over Robinson and into the basket. It fell with 5.1 seconds
left.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just Kobe being Kobe," Laker forward Samaki Walker said.
"As he goes, a lot of times we go. We all know that. Coming out of
the huddle [with the Lakers down two] I said to him, 'Bring it home
for us.' He said, 'This is what I live for.' He's that kind of
player."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant scored 11 points in the fourth quarter of Game 3, when the
Lakers came back from a late deficit to beat the Spurs by 10. His 12
points in the fourth quarter of Game 4 outscored the Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   His two three-pointers, from a previously balky jump-shot stroke,
had brought the Lakers to the point they could hope. O'Neal,
surrounded on the inside, assisted on both.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him to take over the game," O'Neal said. "He wanted the
ball. They were very, very concerned with what I was doing when I got
the ball. I made a couple of dribbles like I was going to do
something and [kicked] it out."</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs had done their usual fourth-quarter thing, having scored
18 points in Game 3, 15 in Game 2 and 19 in Game 1. In the four
fourth quarters in the series, the Lakers have outscored the Spurs by
32 points.</TE>
<TE>   But the Spurs had a last chance to make it right. After a timeout,
they inbounded the ball to Duncan, who was fouled with 3.2 seconds
left. That gave the Spurs another inbounds play, and this time Danny
Ferry passed to Terry Porter, who dribbled and, pressed by Fisher,
fell. He shoved the ball toward Duncan, who could not make the shot.
The Lakers hugged, and Duncan stomped toward his locker room.</TE>
<TE>   To go on, the Spurs will have to beat the Lakers three consecutive

three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "I just love playing in pressure-type situations," Bryant said.
"I've always been that way. It starts from an early age, playing
pickup basketball, things of that nature.</TE>
<TE>   "I've kind of grown into this role. My teammates look for me. They
expect me to deliver in this kind of situation. That's what I do for
this team."</TE>

<HD>For Spurs, Time Stands Still in Final Six Minutes</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>Ticktock, ticktock. The Lakers are huffing and puffing, sweat pouring
off their furrowed brows as the final minutes pass Sunday at the
Alamodome. They're working hard but drawing no closer to the San
Antonio Spurs.</LD>
<LD>   There are 6 minutes 15 seconds to play when Tim Duncan makes two
free throws to give the Spurs an 84-74 lead.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, the Spurs are exorcising the demons of fourth quarters
past. There will be no meltdown Sunday. They will win Game 4, evening
their Western Conference semifinal playoff series at two games
apiece. A pivotal Game 5 will be Tuesday at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a situation where we controlled the game," San Antonio's
Danny Ferry would later say.</TE>
<TE>   Waves of noise from the frenzied crowd of 32,342 wash over the
Lakers and Spurs. Time passes slowly but certainly--but certainly not
as swiftly as the home team and its fans would like.</TE>
<TE>   There is 4:55 remaining when Kobe Bryant swishes two free throws.</TE>
<TE>   There is 4:26 left when Shaquille O'Neal makes one of two at the
line.</TE>
<TE>   There is 4:03 to go when Rick Fox makes two free throws.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 84, Lakers 79.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, the shots aren't falling for the Spurs. On their
next possessions after Duncan's free throws give them a 10-point lead
with 6:15 to play, the Spurs miss five shots and commit one turnover.</TE>
<TE>   There is 2:53 remaining when Bryant makes a three-point basket off
a pass from O'Neal from the post. Robert Horry's offensive rebound
enables the Lakers to keep possession and for Bryant to make his
long-range jumper.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 84, Lakers 82</TE>
<TE>   "We had a great opportunity," David Robinson would say. "We're up
by 10 points with five minutes to go and we just can't get the ball
in the basket. They made some great plays, but our offense got
stagnant. We didn't get the ball inside. We have to figure out how to
keep that motion going and knock down some shots in the last five
minutes."</TE>
<TE>   There is 2:31 left when Duncan makes one of two free throws after
O'Neal picks up his fifth foul.</TE>
<TE>   There is 2:10 to go when Bryant makes another three-pointer off a
pass from O'Neal in the post.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 85, Lakers 85.</TE>
<TE>   It's the first time the Lakers have been even with the Spurs since
it was 33-33 with 6:39 remaining in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "For a while there, I thought it was going really well," Robinson
would say. "All of a sudden, the well just dried up."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson misses a 13-foot jumper with 1:42 still to be played, but
the Lakers turn the ball over at the other end, Duncan swiping it
with 1:33 left. San Antonio's Bruce Bowen misses a hurried 14-footer
with 1:08 remaining, but Bryant can't convert on a layup with 51.4 to
play.</TE>
<TE>   It's still San Antonio 85, Lakers 85.</TE>
<TE>   After a Laker timeout with 46.2 seconds to go, O'Neal rebounds
Horry's missed three-pointer with 29.9 remaining. Bryant leaps toward
the rafters to take Derek Fisher's missed shot from Spur guard Tony
Parker. Bryant rises again before Robinson can thwart him, dropping
in a layup. Lakers 87, San Antonio 85.</TE>
<TE>   There are 5.1 seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio Coach Gregg Popovich asks for a timeout, then sends
Daniels and Steve Smith into the game for Parker and Bowen. The
Lakers grab Duncan with 3.2 to go, their final foul before the Spurs
shoot free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Popovich wants time again, then brings Terry Porter into the game
for Robinson. Porter has been on the bench since leaving the game
with 7:36 to play in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Ferry would later say he intended to inbound the ball to Duncan,
but Duncan stumbled over Fox as he tried to move into the clear.
Ferry passes it to Porter at the top of the key instead.</TE>
<TE>   Against Fisher's suffocating defense, Porter stumbles and the ball
trickles over to Duncan, whose 21-foot jumper from the right wing is
well short at the buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   Game over.</TE>

                                   previous possession, O'Neal was
                                   blocked by Duncan while going up

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is it the bike or the rider? That question could have been asked
Sunday at the AMA Chevy Trucks U.S. Motocross Championships.</LD>
<LD>   Ricky Carmichael, who won the series the last two years on a
Kawasaki, began defense of the title aboard a Honda, and proved
similarly dominant in front of more than 20,000 crammed around the
2.25-mile dirt course at Glen Helen Raceway in San Bernardino. Twice
in separate motos, Carmichael got the hole shot, and twice Carmichael
ran away from the competition.</LD>
<LD>   A one-horse field? Pretty much. Carmichael, of Havana, Fla., beat
Team Honda teammate Sebastien Tortelli in the first moto by 25
seconds, and in the second by 30--and that was because he cruised the
last lap, losing eight seconds of his lead.</LD>
<TE>   Sure, Tortelli, an outdoor specialist, fell at one point in the
second moto, but Carmichael still posted times that showed he pulled
away by more than 15 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "For sure, it's him," Yamaha team rider Tim Ferry said.
"[Carmichael's] done the same thing on both bikes, and I don't think
one was any better than the other. He rides hard, gives 100%, and it
shows. People who thought he would have a harder time on a Honda are
shutting up now."</TE>
<TE>   Scoring was based on two motos, each lasting 30 minutes plus two
laps. The winner received 25 points, second place was worth 22, third
place 20 and so on.</TE>
<TE>   Tortelli, a Frenchman who lives in Temecula, followed Carmichael
with 44 points and Ferry was third with 40.</TE>
<TE>   Carmichael has won five consecutive motocross titles, including
three in the 125cc division.</TE>
<TE>   James Stewart, 16, of Haines City, Fla., became only the fourth
rider in AMA history to win his first national event, and the first
American as he turned a 1-2 finish into an overall victory in the
125cc race for Team Chevy Trucks Kawasaki.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart dominated his first professional moto, winning by 26
seconds over 20-year-old Australian Chad Reed. Stewart took second in
the second moto behind defending series champion Mike Brown, who was
caught up in a nasty crash in the first moto and had to pass 29
riders to finish 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart had 47 points and was followed by Grant Langston of South
Africa with 40, Reed with 37 and Brown with 36.</TE>

Grand Prix.</LD>
<LD>   Schumacher cruised to victory Sunday when Ferrari teammate Rubens
Barrichello--following team orders--yielded the lead in the final
straightaway, allowing the four-time world champion to take the
checkered flag.</LD>
<LD>   Barrichello, the polesitter who led the entire race, settled for
second as Schumacher claimed his first Austrian Grand Prix and fifth
victory in six races this season.</LD>
<TE>   "It was probably the wrong decision to do it this way, I am not
very happy," Schumacher said. "I take no joy from this victory."</TE>
<TE>   A disappointed Barrichello, who had his contract with Ferrari
extended last week, stood by the call by his team.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a team decision, I just signed another two-year contract,"
Barrichello said. "I was asked to do it. Obviously, I wish they
hadn't said anything today."</TE>
<TE>   Juan Pablo Montoya finished third, just ahead of BMW-Williams
teammate Ralf Schumacher, the younger brother of Michael.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher, trying to win a record-tying fifth Formula One title,
defended the way in which he claimed his 58th career victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the decision is not popular, but imagine if we had lost
the championship by this number of points at the end of the season.
The team would look stupid," said Schumacher, who increased his lead
in the driver standings to 27 points.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrari team officials said the strategy of putting Schumacher
ahead of Barrichello would continue until there is no risk that the
German could lose the championship.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael broke his leg in '98. Anything could happen in the
championship. We don't take the slightest chances," said Ross Brawn,
Ferrari's technical director.</TE>
<TE>   Team chief Jean Todt defended the decision to have Schumacher pass
Barrichello.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes one has to take difficult decisions and today was one
of those times," Todt said. "In the past we lost the title in the
last race three times in a row and we have to make the most of every
situation."</TE>
<TE>   The bizarre ending drew boos from the crowd and grumbles from
other teams.</TE>
<TE>   "In 22 years of auto racing I had never seen something disgusting
like this," Patrick Head, technical director for BMW-Williams, said.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher talked with Barrichello and patted his teammate on the
cheek after the race.</TE>
<TE>   During the victory ceremony, Schumacher stepped down and let
Barrichello take the winner's place while the German national anthem
played. Barrichello smiled and the drivers shared the podium for
Italy's national anthem, played for the winning team.</TE>
<TE>   It was not the first time Barrichello let Schumacher pass near the
end of a race. In last year's Austrian Grand Prix, Barrichello let
Schumacher take second place.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not very pleased about this, obviously, neither of us is. I
have to thank Rubens, he had an outstanding race," Schumacher said.
"Surely, this wasn't the way I wanted to win the race, but I have to
thank him for the 10 points."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he would ever return the favor, Schumacher said, "The way
he's running now, he's going to win a race sooner or later, without
me."</TE>

<HD>Hornets Can't Contain Kidd</HD>
<DH>NBA playoffs: He scores 24 points and makes eight free
throws in fourth quarter to lead Nets, 89-79.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Unless they find a way to stop Jason Kidd, the Hornets will never
play another game in Charlotte.</LD>
<LD>   His right eye swollen, bruised and bandaged, Kidd looked like a
battered boxer Sunday as he led the New Jersey Nets to an 89-79
victory in what may have been the Hornets' final game in Charlotte.</LD>
<LD>   Kidd scored 24 points and made eight free throws in the fourth
quarter as the Nets made all the big plays down the stretch to take a
3-1 lead in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinals.</LD>
<TE>   Game 5 is Wednesday at East Rutherford, N.J., where a victory
would put the Nets in the conference finals for the first time in
team history and would end the Hornets' 14-year era in Charlotte.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't believe, then there's no point in even going to New
Jersey," Charlotte captain David Wesley said. "We just need a better
effort and we'll be back."</TE>
<TE>   The Hornets are relocating to New Orleans next season, and the
13,864 fans--more than 6,000 short of capacity--gave them a standing
ovation as the game wound down. With the finality of it all setting
in, they crowded the tunnel, applauding the players running
dejectedly to the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm confident we can still win the series," said guard Baron
Davis, who led the Hornets with 20 points but made only nine of 17
free throws.</TE>
<TE>   But the game belonged to Kidd, who opened a gash above his eye in
a head-to-head collision with Wesley during Game 3. Whether Kidd
would play was a game-time decision because no one knew how swollen
his right eye would be.</TE>
<TE>   But the swelling eventually went down. So with a lot of puffiness,
heavy bandages covering the stitches in his eyebrow and a deep purple
bruise below it, Kidd played.</TE>
<TE>   After missing his first six three-point attempts, he made one
midway through the fourth and scored on a fastbreak layup that drew a
foul and gave the Nets a 78-69 lead with 6:07 left.</TE>
<TE>   "My vision was great, the Band-Aids didn't bother me, and I had
one good eye. That's sometimes better off than two," he said. "Other
than some questionable passes, I was fine."</TE>
<TE>   He made several crucial free throws down the stretch, going 11 of
14 from the free-throw line to make up for his six-for-23 shooting,
including one of nine three-point attempts.</TE>

<HD>Finally, Henin Beats a Williams</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Justine Henin finally made the clutch shot she needed to get past one
of the Williams sisters.</LD>
<LD>   Henin needed three match points to beat Serena Williams, 6-2, 1-6,
7-6 (5), in the final of the German Open Sunday at Berlin.</LD>
<LD>   The 19-year-old Belgian won her first title of the year after
failing in three previous finals. Henin, the world's eighth-ranked
player, had lost all three finals to Serena Williams' older sister,
Venus. She defeated Serena Williams for the first in three tries.</LD>
<TE>   "Maybe it was a breakthrough. I've always been too nervous in
these kind of matches," Henin said of her fifth career title. "But it
was a great week, a great experience and I played free in the head."</TE>
<TE>   The third set featured outstanding shots from both players,
producing the thrilling finish.</TE>
<TE>   Henin built a 4-2 lead in the third set, but Williams battled
back, drawing standing ovations from the crowd. Henin wasted two
match points at 6-5. She hit a drop shot to end the match after 2
hours 17 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, playing her first final on clay, struggled with her
first serve, although she hit a twisting ace to ward off one match
point and send the final set into a tiebreaker.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I could have won the match, but I couldn't get a first
serve in," Williams said. "It's really strenuous to try and win
without it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy, I had a lot of positives in my game, learning
experiences. Now, I'm just going to get ready for [the French Open]."</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who has won two titles this year, lost for just the
second time in 20 matches.</TE>
<TE>   Henin has extended Serena or Venus Williams to three sets in five
of her last seven meetings against the sisters. At Amelia Island,
S.C., last month, Henin led Venus, 6-2, 4-0, before losing.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Henin handled the pressure, even as Williams won two
points in the tiebreaker to pull even at 5-5.</TE>
<TE>   Henin then made her biggest shot of the match. Williams hit a
powerful forehand at her feet near the net, and Henin reached and
flicked an unreachable drop shot.</TE>
<TE>   "The match was won at this point," Henin said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Williams: "That was just a very good shot."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Elena Bovina of Russia beat top-seeded Henrieta Nagyova of
Slovakia, 6-3, 6-1, in the final of the J&amp;S Cup at Warsaw.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first WTA tournament victory for the 19-year-old
Bovina, whose previous best finish was second in Estoril, Portugal,
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Soccer</TE>
<TE>   Dante Washington scored the tying goal in the 67th minute and
Jaime Moreno missed a penalty kick in injury time as the Columbus
Crew (2-4-1) and Washington D.C. United (2-5-1) played to a 1-1 draw
in a Major League Soccer game before 30,169 at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Santino Quaranta scored D.C. United's goal in the 47th minute. It
was the first goal in 227 minutes for D.C. United, shut out in
consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   Moreno, making only his second start after missing the start of
the season with a knee injury, had a chance to win the game from the
penalty spot six minutes into injury time, but he rolled a soft shot
that goalkeeper Tom Presthus saved easily by diving to his left.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sherrill Kester scored in injury time to give the San Diego Spirit
(1-2-2) a 1-1 tie with the WUSA champion San Jose CyberRays (2-2-1)
before 5,580 at San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Kester, who entered the match in the 74th minute, took a pass from
Julie Foudy and fired a shot to the far post. The ball rattled off
both goal posts before settling in the net for her first career goal.</TE>
<TE>   Diving</TE>
<TE>   Alexandre Despatie of Canada ended China's bid to sweep all 10
events in the USA Grand Prix at Coral Springs, Fla., winning the
men's platform title.</TE>
<TE>   The 16-year-old Canadian rallied from fifth place after he
received a two-point deduction on every mark in the third dive for
illegally moving his hand while in the handstand takeoff position.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew after the dive I dropped back a lot of places and I'd have
to do very good on the next three dives to catch up," said Despatie,
who finished with 463.83 points.</TE>
<TE>   American Mark Ruiz was second with 459.78 points.</TE>
<TE>   China's Minxia Wu won the women's three-meter title with 339.42
points. China took the women's team event with 48 points.</TE>
<TE>   Anna Lindberg of Sweden was second with 307.26 points. Kimiko
Soldati, the only American in the event, finished fifth. The U.S. was
second in the women's team competition with 37 points.</TE>
<TE>   Hockey</TE>
<TE>   The new world hockey champions were given a heroes' welcome upon
returning home to Slovakia after winning the nation's first world
championship by beating Russia, 4-3, Saturday in Goteborg, Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   A few thousand fans gathered at the airport, while others lined
the streets of Bratislava leading to a downtown square where a crowd
of at least 25,000 wildly cheered and applauded the team.</TE>
<TE>   The Slovaks, who failed to advance from group play at the Salt
Lake City Olympics, won their first world championship
medal--silver--in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has this kind of a dream in his heart," said captain
Miroslav Satan, also a member of the Buffalo Sabres. "I did not
expect it to come true so soon."</TE>

<LD>Colorado was 34-0-1 during the regular season when leading after two

<LD>   "I'm called a dirty player. I should have the same rights as guys

<LD>Believing their eight-run lead after two innings was safe, the
Cincinnati Reds relaxed, substituted and chalked it up as a win.</LD>
<LD>   They probably won't do that again.</LD>
<LD>   J.D. Drew hit a two-run home run off Danny Graves in the eighth
inning as the St. Louis Cardinals pulled off their biggest rally in
10 years, beating the Reds, 10-8, Sunday at Cincinnati.</LD>
<TE>   Drew had a two-run single in the fifth inning that started the
comeback, and homered with two outs in the eighth to leave the
third-place Cardinals feeling that their season is finally turning.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis hadn't pulled off such a comeback since it trailed
Atlanta by nine runs on May 9, 1992, and wound up winning, 12-11.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know what can happen," said Drew, who had only one hit
in 13 at-bats before leading the comeback. "We could have shut it
down and tried to get out early and gone home."</TE>
<TE>   Reggie Taylor's first grand slam helped the Reds take an 8-0 lead
after two innings. Manager Bob Boone then substituted for shortstop
Barry Larkin, who had singled and doubled but often leaves when a
game appears decided to as a hedge injury.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the lineup went flat as Cincinnati had its biggest
blown lead since Sept. 4, 1989, when San Francisco overcame an 8-0
deficit in Cincinnati and won, 9-8.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals scored five runs in the middle innings off Elmer
Dessens, who faded fast, then pulled out their second win against the
Reds' closer. In the series opener, Edgar Renteria hit a two-run
homer off Graves in the eighth inning for a 4-2 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Gabe White got two outs in the eighth before Graves (1-1) relieved
with two on. Placido Polanco doubled home two runs and scored the
tying run on Fernando Vina's bad-hop double over Adam Dunn at first
base.</TE>
<TE>   Drew hit Graves' second pitch high over the wall in right-center,
prompting the Cardinal dugout to erupt in cheers and high-fives.
Graves was booed loudly by the crowd of 20,622 as he walked off the
field after the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 4, San Francisco 2--Brad Wilkerson hit a foul ball that
broke a glass pane behind home plate, then hit a tiebreaking single
in the seventh inning at Olympic Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Vladimir Guerrero hit his 11th homer for the Expos as Montreal's
Frank Robinson recorded his 700th victory as a major league manager.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds hit his 12th homer of the season and 579th of his
career. Robinson ranks fourth on baseball's all-time list with 586
and Mark McGwire is fifth with 583.</TE>
<TE>   The game was delayed for eight minutes in the second inning after
Wilkerson's foul shattered the glass.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Armas Jr. (5-3) gave up five hits and two runs in seven
innings. Former Dodger Matt Herges got the last out for his sixth
save.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 13, Chicago 4--Raul Casanova and Richie Sexson hit grand
slams in consecutive innings as the Brewers handed Jon Lieber his
first loss at Wrigley Field in almost a year.</TE>
<TE>   The Brewers swept the Cubs in the rain-shortened three-game series
after winning only two of their first 18 road games. Chicago lost its
fourth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The game started after a rain delay of 1 hour 55 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Casanova's slam in the seventh inning made it 9-1 and Sexson
connected in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs had won the last 16 times Lieber started at Wrigley.
Their last loss at home with Lieber (3-2) on the mound was last May
18 against Randy Johnson and Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 3, Arizona 1--Travis Lee did some damage against his
former club at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Lee had four hits in four at-bats with a home run and former
Dodger Terry Adams pitched six strong innings to pick up his first
victory for the Phillies.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, obtained by the Phillies along with Vicente Padilla, Omar
Daal and Nelson Figueroa for Curt Schilling in 2000, is 13 for 40
against Arizona with three home runs and six RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 4, New York 3--Larry Walker, hitless in his first four
at-bats, hit a two-run homer in the 13th inning at Shea Stadium. Juan
Uribe drew a four-pitch walk from Kane Davis (1-1) to start the
inning. Walker followed with his eighth homer.</TE>
<TE>   Rain delayed the start for 63 minutes. The Rockies finished their
nine-game trip by winning four of six after an 0-3 start. The Mets
have lost seven of eight.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 5, Pittsburgh 1--Shane Reynolds wasn't going to let the
Astros go home winless from a weeklong trip, no matter how long it
took. He shrugged off an 86-minute rain delay and limited the Pirates
to two hits over six innings.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 6, Atlanta 5--Deivi Cruz singled home the go-ahead run
in the seventh inning, helping the Padres snap a five-game losing
streak. They avoided an 0-6 trip, which would have tied a franchise
record. Trevor Hoffman pitched the ninth for his 12th save.</TE>

<DH>Horse racing: Evidence is anecdotal, but persuasive, that
injuries are as frequent in training as in racing.</DH>

<LD>Nine days ago, on the first anniversary of Monarchos' victory in the
Kentucky Derby, Yvonne Azeff struggled to get to Churchill Downs for
a television interview. Then, before the 128th Derby was run, she
went back to her Louisville home to watch the race on TV.</LD>
<LD>   Azeff, an assistant to John Ward Jr., the trainer of Monarchos,
has been getting about with a walker since her release from the
hospital three weeks ago. At Gulfstream Park near Miami this winter,
she suffered serious brain damage, among other injuries, when a
stable pony inexplicably spooked, careened into a chain-link fence
and fell on the 40-year-old career horsewoman. Azeff was in a coma
for three weeks and didn't utter a word for four.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm doing good, but I'm not much at covering a distance of
ground," the good-humored Azeff said the other day, lapsing into the
racetrack vernacular that she frequently uses. "Right now I think I'm
more suited for a sprint rather than a route [race]. We didn't have a
horse in this Derby, and the hassle of the crowd [more than 145,000]
would have been too much."</LD>
<TE>   On Saturday, Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore will run the
Preakness, the second race in the Triple Crown series, and Azeff thus
far has resisted the temptation to travel to Maryland, where Booklet,
a colt she and Ward have trained, will try to foil War Emblem, the
Derby winner. Azeff is getting better after her serious accident. She
remains, however, a paradox, an unkept statistic in a sport that
otherwise thrives on minutiae.</TE>
<TE>   The Jockeys' Guild, for instance, keeps accurate records that
reflect how dangerous it is to ride in races--144 rider deaths since
1940--but the horse industry fails to catalog the deaths and
crippling injuries that occur during the morning training hours at
racetracks, where hundreds of horses, many inexperienced and
high-strung, vie for space as their handlers prepare them for their
racing assignments.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any statistics--nobody does--but I'll grant you that
there are just as many serious accidents in the mornings as there are
during the races," said Charlie Woods, a Kentucky jockey who has been
riding for more than 25 years. "I've seen [morning] riders killed.
I've seen guys wind up in wheelchairs. This is because you've got so
much going on at one time. Some horses are working [running against
the stopwatch], others are just galloping, and with all these horses,
there's no real traffic pattern. Many of these horses are galloping
the wrong way [clockwise] around the track."</TE>
<TE>   Woods, about to work a nervous filly out of the starting gate at
Churchill Downs four years ago, was crushed when the horse fell on
him.</TE>
<TE>   "She had a history of not liking the gate, but I wasn't told
that," said Woods, who has won more than 2,800 races since breaking
his pelvis in four places in the 11th race he ever rode.</TE>
<TE>   The nervous filly's name was Marty's Party. Another horse nearby
kicked dirt as Marty's Party was ready to enter the gate. Frightened,
she wheeled around, dumped Woods and fell on him, breaking his thumb
and shattering his wrist. He underwent four operations in the next
two years, with plates and screws inserted each time to reinforce the
wrist, and finally a nerve was cut to alleviate lingering pain.</TE>
<TE>   That accident happened on July 29, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   On July 29, 2001, Woods was riding at Ellis Park in northern
Kentucky when he went down in a race spill, breaking a knee and some
ribs and injuring a shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the message is clear," Woods said. "I shouldn't be
anywhere near a horse this July 29."</TE>
<TE>   Many states, California among them, have helmet rules for morning
riders. In Florida, where Azeff was injured, the helmet is optional
and she wasn't wearing one--but the average rider is outweighed 9 to
1 by a horse, which makes for a physical mismatch when the animal
panics.</TE>
<TE>   Sheri Garcia, 37, was killed on a drizzly morning at Pimlico in
late March, less than two weeks from the day she'd hoped to ride in
her first race. Garcia, aboard an unraced 3-year-old filly she and
her husband, trainer Michael Garcia, had just bought, lost control
and was slammed into the half-mile pole on the track's backstretch.
She was wearing a safety vest as well as a helmet.</TE>
<TE>   "It's funny about the helmet," said trainer Charles Frock, who
employed Garcia and tried to revive her at the scene of the accident.
"As hard as she hit, the helmet was intact. It wasn't broke or
anything."</TE>
<TE>   When Azeff was injured at Gulfstream Park, trainer Allen Jerkens
instinctively recalled 1994, when one of his exercise riders was
killed during the early morning hours at the same track. In New York,
trainer Del Carroll II was reminded of how his father, a consummate
horseman, had been killed while trying to control a runaway horse at
Keeneland 20 years before.</TE>
<TE>   Track safety standards--at Santa Anita, two ambulances with crews
stand by in the morning, same as in the afternoon--are not failsafe.
The Carroll death, at the bucolic Keeneland track in Lexington, Ky.,
occurred in 5 a.m. solitude, when the racing strip is not congested.
There were no other horses to get in Carroll's way--and no witnesses.
The details of Carroll's death at dawn remain unknown. Del Carroll
was a rugged 62. Aboard the multiple stakes winner Sportin' Life, he
wasn't wearing a helmet.</TE>
<TE>   "My father wouldn't wear a helmet, no matter what," Del Carroll II
said. "I remember a time when we had some horses in Maryland and the
people at Pimlico were insisting that he wear a helmet. He told them,
'The day you get Woody Stephens to wear a helmet is the day I'll put
one on.'"</TE>
<TE>   The legendary Stephens, who is in the Racing Hall of Fame, wore a
beat-up gray fedora when he rode his pony to the track. Another Hall
of Fame trainer, John Nerud, shunned helmets and was seriously
injured when his horse got away from him in New York in the 1960s.
Charles Fager, a Boston neurosurgeon, helped Nerud pull through, and
the trainer later named one of his most promising horses after the
doctor. In 1968, in Chicago, Dr. Fager carried 134 pounds as he ran a
mile in a record 1:321/5.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a rider's prerogative whether or not to wear a helmet," said
Ward, the trainer who hired Azeff two years ago and later entrusted
her with Monarchos. "In New York and Kentucky, they're stricter with
helmet rules, but in Florida a trainer or assistant trainer doesn't
have to wear one."</TE>
<TE>   Jerkens, a Hall of Fame trainer, is still disturbed about the
death of Mary Rafferty, one of his exercise riders, eight years ago
at Gulfstream. Vindication, a 4-year-old filly, broke down during a
workout and threw the 41-year-old Rafferty to the ground. Jockey Jean
Luc-Samyn had been scheduled to ride Vindication that day, but was
tied up with horses for other trainers.</TE>
<TE>   Jerkens was on his pony when Vindication and Rafferty went out.
His rider was not wearing a safety vest.</TE>
<TE>   "Mary [went down] at the quarter pole, and after that I lost track
of her," Jerkens said. "I'll always feel bad because there was no
special reason for me to work the filly that day. I didn't have a
race in mind, and could as soon have skipped the work. It was a
shame. Mary loved horses, and hoped to train someday."</TE>
<TE>   The injury rate might be high in the mornings, but Del Carroll II,
who ponies his own horses, suggests that it could be even worse.</TE>
<TE>   "You're in close quarters with all these horses and there are a
lot of busy moments," he said. "It's the law of averages that
something eventually is going to happen. When you think about all the
traffic, it's amazing that things run as smoothly as they do. It's a
tribute to the quality of the horsemen that more accidents don't
happen."</TE>
<TE>   At Santa Anita and Hollywood Park, many trainers still board their
ponies without helmets.</TE>
<TE>   "When we first put in the helmet and safety-vest rule, which
wasn't a tremendous number of years ago, we had trouble getting the
riders to wear them," said Pete Pedersen, a California steward.</TE>
<TE>   Many morning racetrack accidents happen away from the actual
racing oval, in the open barn areas, along the shedrows and in the
stalls where the horses spend most of their hours.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Arden Graham, the cosmetics magnate who loved to visit
the horses she campaigned under the Maine Chance Farm banner, lost a
finger when Jewel's Reward, a champion colt, literally bit the hand
that fed him.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Whittingham was icing the legs of a horse at the San Luis
Rey Downs training center in Bonsall, Calif., when he was fatally
kicked in the chest.</TE>
<TE>   Years later, Whittingham's half-brother, Hall of Fame trainer
Charlie Whittingham, narrowly escaped serious injuries when Sunday
Silence, the day before his second-place finish in the 1989 Belmont
Stakes, was riled by a photographer near the tunnel just off the
track paddock. The Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner, Sunday
Silence reared and clipped Whittingham on his right temple. A dazed
and bruised Whittingham was still thankful.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been a lot worse," he said, "if he had caught me
coming down."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Lukas, an assistant trainer, has never fully recovered from
near-fatal injuries suffered when, arms waving like a semaphore
signaler, he was unable to slow down Tabasco Cat, a renegade
1,100-pound colt, outside his father's barn at Santa Anita in 1993. A
few years earlier, Wayne Lukas had been more fortunate, but still
suffered three cracked ribs when his stable pony threw him and ran
off.</TE>
<TE>   At 6 feet 5 and more than 250 pounds, trainer Doug Peterson was
still overmatched against a 2-year-old filly that knocked him 20
feet, bruised his heart and collapsed his lung in a van-loading
accident at Hollywood Park. The driver of the van broke an arm.</TE>
<TE>   The list goes on. A few days before the 1992 Preakness, Casual
Lies, who had run second in the Kentucky Derby, reached down and bit
his trainer, Shelley Riley, on the lower back as she walked him after
a morning gallop.</TE>
<TE>   Even track announcers are not immune. Joe Hernandez, who called
15,586 consecutive races at Santa Anita, was kicked in the stomach by
a horse in 1972. He returned to the booth, then collapsed there later
that day and was taken to a hospital, where he died a few days later.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Lukas, 44, has lived in Florida for several years, working
with Satish Sanan's Padua Stables near Ocala, an operation originally
managed by Wayne Lukas. When Tabasco Cat, who would go on to win the
Preakness and the Belmont Stakes in 1994, ran over Jeff Lukas, he was
his father's No. 1 assistant. A solid horseman, he had successfully
run the stable's New York division for several years, and had worked
closely with Winning Colors, his father's 1988 Kentucky Derby winner.</TE>
<TE>   Tabasco Cat changed all that, and eliminated almost all of Jeff
Lukas' options. Left with limited sight in his right eye, memory
lapses and years of tedious therapy, Lukas slowly returned to his
father's operation at Santa Anita, but in a limited capacity.</TE>
<TE>   "He couldn't continue to work in California," Wayne Lukas said
recently. "It's imperative that you have a car out here, and Jeff
can't drive. In Florida, he lives right on the grounds and can work
the farm from a golf cart. He finished up his therapy in 1998. He's
lost a lot of the weight he gained when he was put on steroids. His
condition has stabilized."</TE>
<TE>   Azeff, who rode briefly on the California fair circuit, won 60
races as a jockey before she turned to training. She would like to
return to the track before the year is out.</TE>
<TE>   "My right shoulder still really hurts, and keeping my balance is
the hard part," she said. "I've been getting physical and speech
therapy three times a week. My memory, which wasn't very good, has
gotten a lot better. But I'll be back--110%--before it's all over
with."</TE>

<HD>Family Critical of Care at Track</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The family of Glenn Webster, with the support of a registered nurse
who rushed to help, is critical of the emergency treatment the
Churchill Downs outrider received when he suffered a heart attack the
day before last year's Kentucky Derby. Webster, 43, died in a
Louisville hospital two days later.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Webster, younger brother of the outrider, and Anna VanDyke, a
nurse from Hot Springs, Ark., both said that emergency medical
technicians might have done more to help Glenn Webster.</LD>
<LD>   "It was apparent that the basic CPR protocol was not followed,"
VanDyke said. "In an emergency situation, untrained people or maybe
inadequately trained people tend to react differently. I am concerned
about the policy and procedure of emergency response that [was] in
place at Churchill Downs."</LD>
<TE>   Paul Webster, a jockeys' valet at Turfway Park in Florence, Ky.,
and former assistant clerk of scales at Churchill Downs, said that
his parents did not plan to sue. "We realize that nothing we do will
bring Glenn back," he said. "But my mother is still very torn up over
this and we'd like to improve the system to help somebody else who
might be in the same situation."</TE>
<TE>   Churchill Downs officials declined to comment, but David
Richardson, a Louisville surgeon who is a horse owner and member of
the track's racing committee, said that Webster's death was reviewed
and that the panel was satisfied that the EMTs had done all they
could.</TE>
<TE>   "The EMTs are to be congratulated," Richardson said. "They kept
Glenn alive and got him to the hospital for more extensive treatment.
The only changes that came from our review were to recommend better
positioning of emergency vehicles on big days at the track."</TE>
<TE>   Outriders form a mounted patrol that escorts horses on the track
during pre-race post parades. Sometimes required to chase down
runaway horses, outriders remain on the track until horses are pulled
up after races.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Webster was the head outrider at Churchill Downs, having
worked the job since 1986.</TE>
<TE>   On May 4, 2001, with a crowd of 102,904 on hand for the running of
the Kentucky Oaks, Webster and another outrider were on the
backstretch after the race, near the three-quarters pole, when
Webster grabbed his chest and fell to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   VanDyke, the wife of a retired jockey, said she had watched the
race from the barn area and went to help.</TE>
<TE>   "When it was determined that he didn't have a pulse, one of the
EMTs started CPR," VanDyke said. "But her hand position on his chest
was [incorrect]. At this point, he stopped breathing. I asked for an
oral airway, but I was brought a nasal airway. The EMT was unable to
insert the nasal airway. I asked again for an oral airway and was
brought one."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Webster said that there was so much damage done to his
brother's face that had he survived, he would have needed
reconstructive nose surgery. Webster added that Bob Bailey, director
of security at Churchill Downs, would not give him a copy of the
accident report.</TE>
<TE>   VanDyke said, "I had someone in my arms who was dying. When you
see something like that happening and see what's being done, it's
very disturbing."</TE>

<HD>Maple Leafs Even Series</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Toronto rallies to defeat Ottawa, 4-3, forcing Game
7.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OTTAWA</DL>
<LD>Alexander Mogilny of the Toronto Maple Leafs saw it coming.</LD>
<LD>   A day after saying he had an inkling he'd score a big goal,
Mogilny provided the game-winner in Sunday's 4-3 victory over the
Ottawa Senators, forcing a Game 7 in the Eastern Conference semifinal
series.</LD>
<LD>   The deciding game is Tuesday night in Toronto. It will be the
second seventh game for the Maple Leafs, who beat the New York
Islanders in the first round.</LD>
<TE>   It was another remarkable performance for the banged-up and weary
Maple Leafs.</TE>
<TE>   They are not only playing without six regulars, including captain
Mats Sundin (broken wrist), but also haven't had more than one day
off between games in over three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody believed in us, but here we are on the road, shorthanded
again, and we found a way to get the job done," Mogilny said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the team's mind-set, he added with a smile: "Well, we said
we're going back [to Toronto] anyway. We might as well bring those
guys with us."</TE>
<TE>   Gary Roberts continued his prolific postseason production, with
two goals and an assist and Bryan McCabe also scored for Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Mogilny ended a five-game goal drought a day after he told
reporters, "I've got a feeling it's coming. I've just got a feeling
that something good will happen soon."</TE>
<TE>   From deep in the Ottawa end, Radek Bonk's pass through the middle
hit off teammate Martin Havlat's skate. Toronto's Travis Green got to
the loose puck, and slipped a pass to Mogilny, who was alone behind
the defenders.</TE>
<TE>   Turning toward the net, Mogilny snapped a shot that beat
goaltender Patrick Lalime on the stick side to break a 3-3 tie 4:28
into the third period.</TE>

<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>They were all thinking it. Only Samaki Walker was shameless enough to
say it.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers were walking back onto the Alamodome court Sunday, 21/2
minutes left in the game, trailing the San Antonio Spurs by two, when
Walker grabbed Kobe Bryant.</LD>
<LD>   Not to encourage.</LD>
<TE>   But to beg.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't let us lose this," Walker pleaded.</TE>
<TE>   Which made Bryant smile.</TE>
<TE>   It was the same smile we saw when he was missing 16 of his first
23 shots. It was the same smile we saw when Coach Phil Jackson was so
perplexed, he impulsively moved Bryant to small forward in hopes of
changing something, anything.</TE>
<TE>   A freaky, frustrating, wonderful smile.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what I live for," Bryant told Walker.</TE>
<TE>   At which point he returned to the court to make the San Antonio
Spurs all but disappear.</TE>
<TE>   A three-point jab to the head. A three-point hook to the chest. A
soaring offensive rebound and layup blow to the gut.</TE>
<TE>   The longtime Lakers say they are used to it, but how can they be?
How can anybody become used to losing his breath, his voice, his
fear?</TE>
<TE>   How can anybody on this team, or in our town, become used to a
basketball player who can be suffocating underneath a game for three
quarters before suddenly jumping up and laughingly stuffing a pillow
in its face?</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant did it again in Game 4 of the Western Conference
semifinals Sunday, and if any of you are getting used to it, then
your blood is colder than Bryant's.</TE>
<TE>   With five minutes remaining, the Lakers trailed the Spurs by 10
points and Bryant had missed two-thirds of his field-goal attempts
and free throws.</TE>
<TE>   In those final five minutes, he made two free throws, two
three-pointers, then flew into the Alamodome sky to grab a ball and
lay it in the basket over two 7-footers to give the Lakers an 87-85
victory and a three-games-to-one lead that is probably
insurmountable.</TE>
<TE>   "If that's not amazing, there is no amazing," said newcomer
Walker.</TE>
<TE>   At least we weren't the only ones screaming.</TE>
<TE>   Were you? When? There were so many times during yet another
dramatic ending scripted by basketball's greatest closer.</TE>
<TE>   After scoring 11 points in the fourth quarter in Friday's victory,
Bryant wore a New York Yankee jersey featuring the number of Derek
Jeter. He should buy a new one featuring Mariano Rivera, because
that's the player he has become. There is no better ninth-inning,
bases-loaded guy in any sport.</TE>
<TE>   Did you scream at Bryant's fall-away three-point shot at the
24-second buzzer to tie the score, at 85-85?</TE>
<TE>   He didn't scream. He shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   "I just love to play in pressure situations," Bryant said. "I've
always been that way."</TE>
<TE>   Or did you scream later, when he lost the ball out of bounds on
what seemed like a rushed drive to the basket?</TE>
<TE>   He didn't scream then, either. He laughed. We saw him.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it doesn't matter to Kobe if he misses his first 10
shots," Jackson said. "He thinks he's going to make his next 10
shots."</TE>
<TE>   You were surely screaming in the final seconds, when Bryant
dribbled the ball off his foot, then Derek Fisher recovered it, shot
it and missed it.... setting up perhaps the most spectacular Bryant
play of at least this week.</TE>
<TE>   A body flying past Spurs into the lane. A left hand reaching up
from that body and grabbing the ball. A right hand returning the ball
to the basket for the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Young legs," Bryant explained.</TE>
<TE>   No, Bryant didn't scream then either. Didn't laugh or shrug. In
fact, he ran to the bench with his most serious look of the game,
glaring at teammates, a sort of, If you guys mess up these final 5.1
seconds I'm going to kill you next.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't. Of course not. They follow him now.</TE>
<TE>   With Shaquille O'Neal physically limited--he has scored one point
in the fourth quarter of the last two games combined-- they must
follow him into June.</TE>
<TE>   Remember how some of Bryant's troubles in the last two years have
related to his desire to win an MVP award? If the Lakers achieve a
third consecutive championship, he'll finally get his MVP--the Finals
MVP--because they cannot win it without him winning it.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal is buying it.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what's good about the yin and the yang, the Frick and the
Frack, Superman and Batman," his former rival said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   It is instructive to recall that O'Neal used to refer to Bryant as
Wonderboy. Guess now he considers them equals.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg Popovich, coach of the Spurs, also is buying it, offering a
description that would fit nicely on a Hall of Fame plaque.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing about [Bryant] is that his talent is astounding,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The second thing is his body exaggerates that talent with his
height and his length.</TE>
<TE>   "The third thing is he has the uncommon will to win. It's the same
exact will to win as Michael Jordan."</TE>
<TE>   Stop right there. Somebody besides Jackson comparing Bryant to
Jordan?</TE>
<TE>   As Sunday again illustrated, Bryant has proven himself beyond even
those shadows of a doubt that were once the size of O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   Or so believes a team that ain't too proud to beg.</TE>

<HD>UCLA Loses Title Game to Stanford, 8-4</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a game involving the UCLA and Stanford women's water polo teams,
it's a toss-up as to who will win.</LD>
<LD>   The teams played each other in the last two Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation title games and in the 2001 NCAA championship game,
with UCLA winning the 2001 NCAA and 2002 MPSF titles. But Sunday,
Stanford came out on top, earning its first NCAA championship with an
8-4 victory over the Bruins at the McDonald's Swim Stadium at USC.</LD>
<LD>   "This was all about us today," Stanford senior Katie Pettit said.
"It was all about our intensity and wanting to step up. We wanted
this feeling and we deserve it."</LD>
<TE>   Stanford jumped to a 3-0 lead with 5:24 left in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "After being down 3-0, not to take anything away from Stanford,
but I thought we had control of the game," UCLA Coach Adam Krikorian
said. "[UCLA] never stopped playing aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins pulled within 4-2 late in the third quarter when
sophomore Natalie Golda scored her second goal.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Robin Beauregard's shot ricocheted off the crossbar and
landed on the goal line, and the Bruins believed it was a goal. But
goalie Jackie Frank recovered the ball and passed it to Kelty Luber,
who scored to put the Cardinal ahead, 5-2, with 1:01 to go in the
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA rallied within 7-4 on a goal from Kelly Heuchan with 2:33
left.</TE>
<TE>   Frank, the tournament's most valuable player, made 12 saves.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a group of talented players, but Jackie Frank makes
that team," Krikorian said.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Marymount defeated Michigan, 6-4, for third place.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Softball league titles are common at Pasadena Poly, where the
Panthers (20-4, 12-0) recently won their 20th in a row when claiming
the Prep League championship.</LD>
<LD>   The Panthers became only the second team in state history to win
as many in softball.</LD>
<LD>   Chuck Ellis, who has coached at Poly for 21 seasons--his team
finished in third his first year--said much of the credit this season
goes to pitcher Emily Nelson (19-2).</LD>
<TE>   Poly's milestone title came as the state and Southern Section
record-holder, Lancaster Paraclete, finally had its streak ended at
23 consecutive titles, 21 under Coach Margaret Neill, when North
Hills L.A. Baptist won the Alpha League championship this season.</TE>

<LD>Mexico was less than impressive in its final World Cup warmup game at
home Sunday and was whistled and booed by its fans in Azteca Stadium
at Mexico City despite defeating Colombia, 2-1.</LD>
<LD>   Jared Borgetti put the home team ahead in the 52nd minute, but
Oscar Restrepo tied the score 13 minutes later. AS Monaco defender
Rafael Marquez scored the game-winner in the 75th minute, but Coach
Javier Aguirre was left bemoaning his team's poor performance.</LD>
<LD>   "We may have won, but I wish we had played better," he said.</LD>

<TE>   Brazilian forward Ronaldo has made a pilgrimage--by helicopter,
not on foot--from his home in Rio de Janeiro to the Sanctuary of Our
Lady north of Sao Paulo to give thanks for his recovery from injury
after 18 months on the sideline and his inclusion on Brazil's World
Cup roster.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, the Inter Milan striker and two-time FIFA world player of
the year said he wants to make up for Brazil's 3-0 loss to France in
the 1998 World Cup final.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to knock out France," he said. "The match in 1998
really stuck in my throat and a chance for revenge would be
excellent."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   American midfielder John O'Brien did not participate the U.S.
team's victory over Uruguay at Washington on Sunday because he was
helping Ajax Amsterdam secure the double in the Netherlands by
winning the Dutch Cup, 3-2, in overtime, over FC Utrecht.</TE>
<TE>   Europe</TE>
<TE>   What does Blackpool, England, have in common with Vienna, Austria?
The number 103, for one thing. Last week, Blackpool, an English
second-division team, announced it was re-laying its Bloomfield Road
playing surface for the first time in 103 years. At Austria, Rapid
Vienna announced that it was firing Lothar Matthaeus as coach after
the 1990 World Cup winner and former New York/New Jersey MetroStar
couldn't keep the club from its worst league finish in 103 years.</TE>

<TE>   England midfielder David Beckham has signed a contract that will
keep him at Manchester United until 2005 and, more to the point, will
pay him more than $130,000 a week.</TE>
<TE>   Asia</TE>
<TE>   World Cup cohost Japan got a welcome boost when two of its players
ended the European season on a winning note. Midfielder Shinji Ono,
22, was part of the Feyenoord team that beat German champion Borussia
Dortmund in the UEFA Cup final, and midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata
helped Parma deny Serie A champion Juventus the double in Italy by
winning the Italian Cup. In goal for Parma was Brazil's 1994 World
Cup hero, Claudio Taffarel, still going strong at age 36.</TE>

<TE>   South Korea's dog meat restaurants have bowed to government
pressure and abandoned plans to set up stalls outside World Cup

Milutinovic's China a 3-1 come-from-behind victory over Thailand at
Kumming, China, Saturday.</TE>

<TE>   Ghana, which will play Slovenia's World Cup team at Ljucljana,
Slovenia, Friday, has banned the use of tear gas and rubber bullets
by police providing security at its stadiums. Several police officers
are standing trial in the wake of a riot last year at Accra Stadium
that left 130 people dead.</TE>

<TE>   World Cup-bound South Africa, which defeated Madagascar, 1-0, at
Durban on Sunday on a goal by midfielder Thabo Mngomeni, has
withdrawn its candidacy to stage the African Nations Cup in 2006. The
move is seen as a way of getting support from the other
candidates--Algeria, Egypt, the Ivory Coast and Libya--for its effort
to play host to the 2010 World Cup.</TE>

<HD>When Bell Steps on Field, Star Quality Rings True</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>A red SUV pulled into the parking lot at Stengel Field in Glendale.
Sitting in the passenger seat with the window down and the car radio
blasting was Trevor Bell, his wavy blond hair blowing backward as he
sang along with a rock tune.</LD>
<LD>   Bell looks like a twin for actor Chad Michael Murray of "Dawson's
Creek" fame, but there were no screaming female fans to greet him as
he walked toward the baseball clubhouse carrying a can of RockStar
energy drink.</LD>
<LD>   Bell is only a 15-year-old freshman at Crescenta Valley High, but
his star qualities are obvious each time he steps onto the field.</LD>
<TE>   "He'll be one of the best guys in the country, with a chance to be
somebody's first-round draft choice," Coach Phil Torres said.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball America magazine put the pressure on Bell months ago,
before he played in his first high school game, by labeling him the
top 14-year-old in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that was kind of hard to believe," he said. "You have
to think of every 14-year-old in the country and I was No. 1? It was
definitely something cool said about me."</TE>
<TE>   Bell has lived up to expectations. As a right-handed pitcher, he's
8-1 with a 0.70 earned-run average. He has walked only five batters
in 501/3 innings, striking out 66. As a center fielder, he's batting
.364 with five home runs and 23 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   Three times this season, Torres has removed Bell from games after
the fifth inning while he was working on a no-hitter just to let
other pitchers get in some work.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been dominant as a pitcher," Torres said. "He throws strikes
and he has a live arm. He's ahead 0-1 constantly."</TE>
<TE>   Not that Bell has done everything right. He started the season as
a third baseman, but the speed of the high school game resulted in
several errors, causing Torres to move him to center field, a
position he never played before. He has adjusted so well that center
field could be his position for years.</TE>
<TE>   And there have been the usual freshman mistakes, like forgetting
his batting helmet, causing assistant David Mendoza to pour a can of
soda in the helmet to make sure Bell doesn't forget it again.</TE>
<TE>   Torres never lets Bell think he's something special, not with all
the chores he requires Bell to do, from vacuuming the clubhouse to
washing the bases to cleaning the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   Bell smiles and does whatever Torres asks.</TE>
<TE>   "I love vacuuming," Bell said. "I'm the kind of person who likes
everything neat. My room is neat, my locker is neat."</TE>
<TE>   And what's the key to being good at vacuuming?</TE>
<TE>   "Go over it twice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bell is 6 feet 1 and 180 pounds, with good speed, a terrific arm
and an endless love for baseball.</TE>
<TE>   From the time he was 4 and begging his mother, Barbara, to sign
him up for T-ball, Bell has wanted to do nothing else. He cried and
cried until his mother gave in and signed him up, even though he
wasn't old enough to play.</TE>
<TE>   "It was that bad, real bad," Barbara said.</TE>
<TE>   By age 6, Bell proclaimed, "Mom, baseball is my destiny."</TE>
<TE>   That brought laughs from two older brothers and other family
members, but Bell has followed his dream.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all I want to do," he said. "It's a natural liking. I was
born with it."</TE>
<TE>   Through the years, he has faced many stressful situations from
experiences in Little League and travel competitions, always
receiving advice and support from his parents.</TE>
<TE>   "From the time I can remember as a kid, they've taught me things
to do, things not to do, ways to be successful, ways not to be
successful," he said. "What you put in is what you get back. You put
in a lot of good and you get a lot of good back. That's the main
lesson they told me. I'm looking for good karma and so far,
everything is looking good."</TE>
<TE>   Crescenta Valley (22-3) shared the Pacific League championship
with Arcadia. The Falcons are one of the favorites to win the
Southern Section Division II championship. Bell's contributions will
be crucial. He and UC Irvine-bound pitcher Kris Krise give Crescenta
Valley an effective pitching duo in a division loaded with top
pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   After the playoffs, a busy summer of baseball will kick in, with
Bell also finding time for his newest hobby, surfing.</TE>
<TE>   Autograph seekers have already come forward. In 1999, as a
12-year-old, he hit a game-winning home run in Cooperstown, N.Y., and
the boy who retrieved the ball wanted him to sign it. And this year,
his health teacher wanted an autograph.</TE>
<TE>   Bell won't ever develop a big head, not with Torres around. Last
summer, Bell took off his cleats before a game had been completed,
thinking he was finished for the day. Torres quietly reminded him the
next time he does that he'll be running 10 laps.</TE>
<TE>   Such is life for a talented freshman training to become a major
leaguer</TE>

<LD>Conventional wisdom says the Spurs are history.</LD>
<LD>   The Spurs say otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   History is not on their side as they try to rally from a 3-1
deficit in their best-of-seven series against the Lakers, however.
Only six teams in NBA history have rallied from such a deficit to win
a playoff series. The Miami Heat, in 1997, was the last team to pull
it off.</LD>
<TE>   "Each of these games has been a great game up until the last few
minutes," San Antonio center David Robinson said. "It's always one or
two things in the game that turns it around and that's what we need
to stop. They came down the stretch and got two offensive rebounds on
the last play of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson referred to rebounds by Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant
that enabled Bryant to score the winning field goal in an 87-85 Laker
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what we do best--play defense, make a stop and get the
ball," Robinson said. "Those are the little things we've got to take
care of in order to win the next game. They are going to be good,
hard, close games. We just have to finish them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs' woeful shooting in the fourth quarter troubled Coach
Gregg Popovich.</TE>
<TE>   "We had five or six shots that were either ill-advised or shot
without confidence," Popovich said when asked about the Spurs'
three-for-18 shooting (16.7%) in the final quarter. "Down the
stretch, we have to take good shots and believe they're going in."</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs were outscored, 20-10, in the fourth quarter of Game 4.</TE>
<TE>   They have been outscored in the fourth quarters of the series,
94-62.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have guys who can make shots down the stretch," said
Danny Ferry, who missed all four shots he took Sunday. "For whatever
reason, it's not happening. We've played well enough to win every
night. We didn't make the plays to win tonight."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs' loss Sunday could mean the Alamodome has played host to
its final NBA game. The Lakers can eliminate the Spurs in Game 5 on
Tuesday at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs are scheduled to move into a new 18,500-seat arena next
season. It means the end of crowds of 35,000-plus. It also means the
end of $8 seats high in the upper deck of the indoor football
stadium.</TE>
<TE>   It's a mixed blessing for some die-hard fans.</TE>
<TE>   "I just love the Spurs so much that I would rather be on top of
the ceiling than watching it at home on TV," Zinnie Andrews, a fan
seated in what might be the worst seats in the NBA, told the San
Antonio Express-News.</TE>

<HD>Licking Their Wounds</HD>
<DH>In Saddam Hussein's impoverished Iraq, ice cream is a
delicious indulgence and a reminder of the past generation's golden
days.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Mohammed Saleh is unhappy about his weight. He says he's even tried
dieting because the sizable spare tire he hauls around makes him
uncomfortable. "You can see, I am getting fat," the 50-year-old
scientific researcher said, pointing to his belly.</LD>
<LD>   But Saleh also loves his tishreeb, a fatty mutton stew loaded up
with meat and bread and rice, followed, of course, by a nap. Nor can
he resist what almost always comes next: a visit to his favorite ice
cream parlor.</LD>
<LD>   "You see, this is the only way of having fun," Saleh said as he
ate a large cone of soft-serve from a shop on Hurriyah (Liberty)
Square.</LD>
<TE>   There is something incongruous about an impoverished
"rogue" nation eating ice cream as its most popular pastime--and as a
symbol of its perseverance. Yet this simple pleasure has become a
reminder of the life Iraqis led before the invasion of Kuwait, and
before more than a decade of economic sanctions created a shortage of
almost everything, including food and medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Ice cream inspires memories of the golden days of a
generation ago, before the eight-year war with Iran in the 1980s,
back when there was a real middle class in Baghdad, back when
foreigners actually wanted their children to come here to study.</TE>
<TE>   On any given night, Al Faqma ice cream parlor, off Hurriyah
Square, is easily the city's busiest corner. The elite drive by in
their fancy (and not so fancy) cars, tooting their horns and stopping
at the shops and restaurants that line the road. Al Faqma is an
upscale ice cream shop, staffed by a small army of men in white caps
and white coats.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to find: Just look for the long line. Families and young
people, men and women, queue up at the shop window for a cone of
soft-serve or a scoop of hard ice cream. The cost is just 250 Iraqi
dinars, or about 12 cents, a bargain in this neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The corner is buzzing, like Pink's hot dog stand in Hollywood
or any Chuck E. Cheese on a Saturday afternoon. There is even a man
with a camera ready to take your picture--for a small fee, of course.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a simple thing for people to enjoy," said Khalid Ibrahim,
37, who runs the shop with his brother Ismail. "It also helps
strengthen social cohesion between the people."</TE>
<TE>   The infatuation with ice cream springs in part from an Iraqi
enthusiasm for fat. Saleh's concerns about his waistline
notwithstanding, the diet and fitness obsession prevalent in the
cholesterol-conscious United States is irrelevant here.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's a matter of having more urgent things to worry about,
like whether bombs are going to fall on your city again. Or maybe, as
some of the snackers at the ice cream parlor said, no one is looking
to America for guidance on body shapes.</TE>
<TE>   Maida Mahdi, for one, is fed up with America and doesn't want the
United States, or anyone else for that matter, trying to tell her
what to eat. She likes to be a bit, shall we say, full-figured, and
she isn't going to try to slim down for anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Low-fat ice cream? The very concept amuses her. In Iraq, the
parlors actually increase the fat content of the ice cream they make
when the weather gets hot, which is most of the time. They say it
tastes better, and Mahdi won't have it any other way.</TE>
<TE>   The flavors vary from shop to shop. This particular shop offers
vanilla and chocolate soft-serve, and a variety of harder ice creams.
Others have only vanilla or chocolate.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing for an Iraqi is the belly," Mahdi, 40,
said as she licked a vanilla twist on a sugar cone. "In fact, this is
how we enjoy ourselves. . . . We don't care very much about our
weight. We like to eat. We like food with fat."</TE>
<TE>   In much of the West, Iraq is viewed as an outlaw country, a member
of President Bush's "axis of evil." President Saddam Hussein is, for
the moment, the administration's most hated head of state. The
Mideast nation's economy has been held captive by nearly 12 years of
economic sanctions, imposed after Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   All of this matters to the Iraqi people, although not necessarily
because they are concerned with what others think of their country.
It just makes it difficult for them to get through their day.</TE>
<TE>   While Washington and Baghdad are busying trying to outmaneuver
each other in the blame game (Who really is responsible for the
malnutrition and impoverishment that plagues Iraq?), Rabaa Jasim just
wants to buy his 7-year-old son, Mohammed, a new pair of shoes. While
the United States and Iraq exchange insults and allegations, Sinan
Abdulhamid, 20, worries because his family's savings have been spent
so that its members can survive.</TE>
<TE>   Life in Baghdad is, indeed, difficult. Electricity cuts off for
hours at a time--which can be torturous in a country where the
summers are long and incredibly hot. Like a patient with a spinal
cord injury who believes he will walk again, Iraqis are determined to
resume a normal life, or at least make the most of the life they
have. They remain defiant and insist that someday life will be decent
again.</TE>
<TE>   And for now, at least, they can eat ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   "It is something symbolic for us to have ice cream," said
Abdulhamid, a sophomore engineering student at Saddam University and
a frequent patron of Al Faqma.</TE>
<TE>   There was a time, not too long ago, when even ice cream was denied
Iraqis. When the country became a pariah in the world community in
1990 and was hit with comprehensive economic sanctions for invading
its oil-rich neighbor, all of the nation's ice cream shops were shut
down. The country was starving, and the authorities couldn't afford
to allow what little milk and sugar was available to be used for ice
cream or other sweets.</TE>
<TE>   After six years of shuttered parlors, the government relented and
agreed to an oil-for-food program that allows the sale of crude oil
so that food and medicine can be bought and distributed.</TE>
<TE>   The arrangement has been criticized from both sides, with
Americans insisting that the sanctions have been too weak in blocking
Hussein from rebuilding his weapons of mass destruction program and
Iraq insisting that the program is so caught up in bureaucracy that
the country is barely able to meet its basic needs.</TE>
<TE>   But oil-for-food meant the ice cream shops did reopen--and that is
an important quality-of-life issue, not only in nice Hurriyah Square,
but especially in a place like the district of Saddam Hussein City.</TE>
<TE>   With row after row of two- and three-story concrete
buildings lined up along dusty roads strewn with trash and debris,
Saddam Hussein City is among the poorest neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Fatima Yassin, 52, struggles to come up with the 60,000 dinars
(about $30) a month she needs for rent and the 4,000 dinars (about
$2) she needs for food each month.</TE>
<TE>   "It is difficult for us to have new clothes," she said, fingering
the threadbare Islamic covering, called a chador, draped over her
body.</TE>
<TE>   But Mohammed Tahir still does a good business at his corner ice
cream shop in Saddam Hussein City. It is located right next to the
food market, an open-air pit where animals are slaughtered next to
piles of vegetables and where thick clouds of flies descend on
anything that sits still. He sells his cones for just 50 dinars, or
about 3 cents.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day I eat ice cream," said 13-year-old Mohammed Ashur, who
stood barefoot in the street. "I get the money from my father every
day. He sells fruit in the market every day."</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed said he wants to grow up to become a military officer
because "they are smart and wear nice clothes." In the meantime, his
passion is strawberry ice cream. "That is the best," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, not all Iraqis are fat. Years of sanctions have created
a serious nutrition problem, especially in the southern portion of
the country, which in some respects makes Saddam Hussein City look
upscale and well-tended. Malnutrition is still a huge problem, and
UNICEF's Baghdad office has warned that any disruption of the
distribution of food across Iraq could create chaos "and even famine
on a large scale."</TE>
<TE>   For now, however, Al Faqma is pumping out ice cream in quantities
that even Baskin-Robbins might envy. Shop owner Ismail Ibrahim said
that in the summer he runs through thousands of gallons of milk a
day.</TE>
<TE>   But don't suggest for a minute that his high-fat ice cream is to
blame for anyone's weight problem.</TE>
<TE>   "In fact," he said, smiling down at his own tremendous gut, "if
you want to be objective, rice is the problem."</TE>

<DH>Mideast: Palestinian leader undertakes visit to West Bank
sites hit hard during Israel's incursion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat left Ramallah today for
the first time since Israel confined him to the city six months ago.</LD>
<LD>   At the helipad in his headquarters, Arafat climbed into a
Jordanian air force helicopter that was to fly him to three of the
hardest-hit areas in Israel's six-week West Bank military offensive:
Bethlehem, the battle-scarred Jenin refugee camp and the city of
Nablus.</LD>
<LD>   Before boarding the helicopter, Arafat denounced a decision by
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's Likud Party to oppose the
creation of a Palestinian state, despite Sharon's request that a vote
be delayed. "This is the destruction of the Oslo agreement," Arafat
said of the vote.</LD>
<TE>   In Bethlehem, Arafat was greeted by local Palestinian officials
and a band.</TE>
<TE>   He kissed officials, Muslim clerics and Christian priests on the
cheek.</TE>
<TE>   Ringed by beefy security men, Arafat smiled broadly as those he
greeted clasped his face joyfully.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat last left the Palestinian territories Nov. 25. In early
December, his helicopters were destroyed in Israeli air strikes, in
effect stranding him in Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   Israel said at the time that it wanted to pressure Arafat to rein
in Palestinian militants. Israel gradually tightened the confinement,
and for 34 days, starting March 29, restricted him to a few rooms in
his headquarters while soldiers besieged the compound.</TE>
<TE>   Israel lifted the travel restrictions on Arafat as part of a
U.S.-brokered agreement.</TE>

<HD>Israel Says It Foiled Anti-Arab Plot</HD>
<DH>Violence: Security forces question four suspected Jewish
extremists about bomb attempt at school.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli security forces, already battling attacks by Palestinian
militants on Jewish civilians, said over the weekend that they foiled
an attempt by radical Jewish settlers to detonate a powerful bomb at
a school for Arab girls in East Jerusalem.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators were said to be questioning four suspects to
determine whether they were responsible for any recent attacks
against Palestinians, including a bombing in March at another school
in East Jerusalem.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities fear that attacks on Palestinians by Jewish extremists
could lead to reprisals--and a never-ending cycle of violence.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a miracle that the bomb didn't go off," said Ehud Sprinzak,
a political scientist at the Interdisciplinary Center of Herzliya and
an expert on right-wing extremism. "The Palestinians are already
[enraged] because of the recent incursions by the Israeli military
into their territories. They don't need more incentives to be
inflamed and bring out more violence."</TE>
<TE>   Police arrested the men two weeks ago, but details of their arrest
and alleged plot were revealed to Israeli media only over the
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The bomb was rigged to explode when the 1,500 students in the At
Tur neighborhood gathered for morning assembly in the school's
courtyard, authorities said. The device was composed of two barrels
of gasoline and two gas balloons.</TE>
<TE>   Agents with Israel's Shin Bet secret service, who were questioning
the suspects, acknowledged that they knew nothing of the apparent
plot until police noticed the Jewish men acting suspiciously in the
Arab neighborhood just before dawn April 29.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the men were in a car pulling a small trailer. When
the vehicle stopped near the school, officers approached the men, who
said they were fixing a flat tire. Police arrested the suspects after
they refused to identify themselves. Officers also seized some
unlicensed weapons from their car.</TE>
<TE>   In March, a bomb attack on an Arab school in East Jerusalem
injured a teacher and several students. A group identifying itself as
"Revenge of the Infants" claimed responsibility for that bombing,
saying it was avenging the killing of Jewish children by Palestinian
militants. A few days earlier, six Israeli children were killed in a
suicide bombing outside a Jerusalem synagogue.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli human rights groups say Jewish vigilantism has been
responsible for the deaths of about a dozen Palestinians, a small
percentage of the more than 1,600 Palestinians killed since their
uprising for independence began more than 19 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   About 450 Jews have been killed during the same period by
Palestinian militants who have increasingly targeted civilians inside
Israel. Only Tuesday, a suicide bomber blew himself up at a pool
hall, killing 15 civilians.</TE>
<TE>   That bombing caused Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to order a
military offensive against the Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip,
where the suicide bomber is believed to have been based. But Sunday,
Israel began sending home some reservists who had been called up for
the operation, saying it was canceling the planned incursion for the
time being.</TE>
<TE>   Sprinzak, the expert on political extremists, said the four
suspects appeared to belong to a loose-knit group of radicals--not
the religious groups who openly advocate revenge against
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "They are simply driven by their hate for Arabs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Menachem Landau, a former senior officer in the Israeli secret
service, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "They just set themselves a target and try to hit it," Landau told
Israel Radio. "This is revenge, spontaneous revenge."</TE>

<LD>An express train derailed in northern India, killing 12 people and
injuring at least 70. Railroad authorities said the cause may have

Lucknow, about 250 miles east of New Delhi. The 24-car train carrying
1,800 passengers was bound for Patna, capital of Bihar state. A rail

<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>British Royal Marines scouring mountains in eastern Afghanistan for
vanished Islamic militants have covered 80% to 85% of the ground they
were told to sweep, a spokesman said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Marine Lt. Col. Ben Curry said the commander of 45 commandos
leading the 1,000-strong manhunt and intelligence-gathering mission
estimated that he had walked 125 miles since Operation Snipe began 15
days ago.</LD>
<LD>   "Of the area that we've been given, we've covered between 80% and
85%," Curry told reporters at Bagram air base, north of Kabul, the
capital.</LD>
<TE>   The commandos have not had any enemy contact since they began
their mission but have instead been offered tea and bread by local
villagers in the soaring mountains of Paktika province.</TE>
<TE>   Military officials say the Taliban regime, ousted from power in
December after a United States-led offensive, and Al Qaeda, the
militant Islamic group blamed for the Sept. 11 attacks, have
dispersed or slipped across the Pakistani border.</TE>
<TE>   Curry said that once the Marines had covered the whole of their
target area they would return to base.</TE>

<HD>Castro Welcomes the Carters</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Former president is the first U.S. head of
state in or out of office to visit since 1959.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HAVANA</DL>
<LD>Flashing his trademark smile, Jimmy Carter arrived in Cuba on Sunday
and became the first U.S. president--in or out of office--to visit
this communist country since the 1959 revolution that put Fidel
Castro in power.</LD>
<LD>   Dressed in a dark suit, Castro, 75, greeted Carter, 77, at the
airport with a handshake and symbolically threw open the doors of the
island to the former American head of state.</LD>
<LD>   Castro said Carter could speak with anyone, "even if they do not
share our endeavors," an obvious reference to human rights groups. He
also said Carter could go anywhere--including Cuban scientific
centers, which U.S. officials recently claimed could be working
toward making biological weapons.</LD>
<TE>   Carter said he and his wife, Rosalynn, had traveled here as
friends of the Cuban people and hoped to meet many during their
five-day stay. Carter reminded Cubans that he would be addressing
them on live television Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   After their private jet arrived at 10:45 a.m., the Carters were
escorted by Castro down a red carpet. With the Cuban and U.S. flags
flying side by side, the couple stood at attention for the Cuban and
American national anthems.</TE>
<TE>   "It is no secret that for almost a century there have not been
optimal relations between the two states," Castro told Carter.
"However, I wish to state that in the four years of your tenure as
president, you had the courage to make efforts to change the course
of those relations. That is why those of us who were witnesses to
that attitude see you with respect."</TE>
<TE>   Reading his address in Spanish, Carter said he looked forward to
meeting with Castro, as well as "representatives of religious groups
and others to examine the ideas that are important for Rosalynn and
me," including peace, human rights, democracy and the easing of human
suffering.</TE>
<TE>   As president from 1977 to 1981, Carter helped reestablish
diplomatic missions in both countries and negotiated the release of
thousands of political prisoners. He also made it possible for Cuban
exiles to visit relatives on the island and, for a short time, for
other Americans to travel here freely.</TE>
<TE>   But a U.S. trade embargo is still in place after four decades and
relations are as chilly as ever.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>KAIFENG, China</DL>
<LD>When it comes to Chinese officials, cleanliness is next to godliness.</LD>
<LD>   And that brings crowds flocking to a temple in this former
imperial capital, where they offer food and incense and kneel before
the statue of a man who lived 1,000 years ago: Judge Bao Zheng,
China's most famous "clean" official.</LD>
<LD>   His myth fed by abundant folklore and detective stories, Judge Bao
is a household name in China.</LD>
<TE>   Although most people visit the temple as tourists or out of simple
respect, some stuff allegations of modern-day corruption into the
donation box in front of the statue. Others write letters addressed:
"Kaifeng Prefecture, Judge Bao Temple, Attention: Judge Bao."</TE>
<TE>   "They know perfectly well that this man lived a thousand years
ago, but they send the letters anyway out of desperation," said Li
Liangxue, an expert on Bao at the Kaifeng Municipal Museum in central
China's Henan province.</TE>
<TE>   China has only begun to build the institutions that would make the
entreaties to Judge Bao obsolete. But for now, he is the last hope
for many Chinese seeking justice and relief from corrupt officials.</TE>
<TE>   To ordinary people, "Judge Bao is justice incarnate," Peking
University historian Zhang Xiqing said.</TE>
<TE>   As Kaifeng's magistrate, Judge Bao let complainants come directly
into the great hall where he heard their cases, past lower officials
who might otherwise try to extort money in exchange for letting them
in.</TE>
<TE>   This ancient tradition of appealing grievances to top officials
continues to this day. Citizens who cannot get satisfaction from
local officials often take their cases all the way to Beijing, the
capital. Some live for decades in Beijing's "petitioners' village,"
searching for a fair-minded, Judge Bao-like figure who will hear
their case.</TE>
<TE>   Others, locals here say, have tried to attract attention to their
plight by lying on railroad tracks or throwing themselves at the
passing motorcades of top officials.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese leaders who have stood up for the common people have
invited comparisons to Judge Bao, including the country's charismatic
premier, Zhu Rongji.</TE>
<TE>   Zhu's stern appearance and blunt speech, hatred of bureaucrats'
corruption and waste, and professed willingness to challenge the
powerful and champion the poor all fit the cultural archetype of the
qing guan, or upright official, that Judge Bao represents.</TE>
<TE>   "Zhu is held in high esteem among many older Chinese citizens,
especially those who cling to the traditional mode of thought that
Judge Bao will save the world," observed the April issue of the
newsmagazine Nanfeng Chuang.</TE>
<TE>   Bao and Zhu are heirs to a tradition of Chinese populism known as
minben sixiang. This school of thought held that, as Bao wrote in a
memorandum in 1059, "the people are the root of the state." It also
held that rulers shouldn't constrict people's livelihoods or
persecute them for speaking their minds.</TE>
<TE>   "Pacifying the people depends on carefully selecting local
officials and gradually getting rid of arbitrary taxes," Bao wrote in
the memorandum.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese are increasingly realizing that Judge Bao's tradition,
while humane, is still far from any modern notion of democracy,
individual rights or legal due process that the country is trying to
cultivate.</TE>
<TE>   As Kaifeng's magistrate, Bao served as detective, prosecutor,
judge and jury all in one. He famously tricked or tortured
confessions out of suspected criminals with the use of branding
irons, finger clamps or numerous strokes of the birch pole, all of
which were customary and legal at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Bao's demigod status owes much to popular mythologizing in
opera, plays and novels. In recent years, several television series
about his sleuthing exploits have become wildly popular from the
Korean peninsula to Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Novels based on Judge Bao's adventures are part of a popular genre
of Chinese detective fiction that preceded Sherlock Holmes by several
centuries. In the stories, Judge Bao uses his powers of observation
and intuition to solve convoluted murder plots and palace intrigues.
His ex-convict lieutenants go undercover into the criminal underworld
and supply the stories with kung fu action.</TE>
<TE>   Although loosely based on historical cases, the stories are
fantastically embellished. In the case of "Swapping the Leopard Cub
and the Prince," Judge Bao gets the suspect drunk, then poses as the
king of hell to dupe him into confessing. In another case, he finds a
kidnapped woman imprisoned under a bell in a Buddhist temple after
the Buddha indicates her location to him in a dream.</TE>
<TE>   While less familiar to most Chinese than the literary version, the
real Bao Zheng was actually a historically significant official and
reformer during the Song Dynasty (960-1279).</TE>
<TE>   After acing his civil service exam in 1027, Bao deferred work for
a decade to perform the duties of a good Confucian son. He stayed
home to care for his aged parents for seven years, mourned their
deaths for three and finally began his 26-year official career at age
39.</TE>
<TE>   In his various central government posts, Bao wrote scores of
memorandums to the emperor, criticizing his mistakes and calling by
name for the impeachment of more than 60 officials, some of whom had
ties to the imperial family.</TE>
<TE>   Bao was never demoted or otherwise punished in a political culture
where high-ranking advisors and officials could be executed for
offering the emperor their opinions too candidly.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite Bao's direct speech," observed the Kaifeng museum's Li,
"the emperor knew he was a loyal minister."</TE>
<TE>   There are two other Judge Bao temples in mainland China, as well
as ones in Taiwan, Singapore and Macao. Judge Bao's family tomb was
discovered in the 1970s and ceremoniously relocated to his hometown
in Anhui province's Bao village, where almost everyone has the
surname Bao, including Judge Bao's 30th-generation descendants.</TE>

<HD>Party Rebuffs Sharon Over Palestinians</HD>
<DH>Israel: A Likud panel rejects the concept of statehood,
contradicting its premier's views. U.S. peacemaking efforts could be
hampered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEL AVIV</DL>
<LD>Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon suffered a humiliating defeat
Sunday at the hands of his archrival, former Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, as the central committee of their Likud Party ruled out
the establishment of a Palestinian state.</LD>
<LD>   The party's decision, formalized in a resolution backed by
Netanyahu, directly contradicted Sharon's own stated acceptance of a
Palestinian state as the eventual conclusion of Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations. It came as Sharon faces mounting domestic and
international pressure to find a way to stop more than 19 months of
bloodshed and launch talks with the Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   It also seems certain to complicate the Bush administration's
efforts to arrange a Mideast peace conference.</LD>
<TE>   Delegates packed into Tel Aviv's Mann Auditorium brushed aside
Sharon's warning that they would limit his government's diplomatic
maneuvering room if they adopted the resolution. Around midnight,
they turned aside Sharon's request to postpone the vote and rejected,
59% to 41%, a resolution he had offered backing his government's
efforts to achieve peace and security.</TE>
<TE>   "I will continue to lead the state of Israel and the people of
Israel according to the same ideas that led me always: security for
the state of Israel and its citizens and our desire for real peace,"
Sharon said in a brief, defiant statement from the podium after his
motion was defeated.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon and Netanyahu then left the hall. After that, delegates
adopted with a show of hands, by a large majority, the anti-state
measure Netanyahu and his supporters backed. The resolution read: "No
Palestinian state will be created west of the Jordan [River]."</TE>
<TE>   The Likud Party has traditionally opposed the idea of a
Palestinian state west of the Jordan, and Sharon stirred a storm in
the party when he said publicly last year that he envisioned such a
state as the outcome of negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's vote is expected to weaken Sharon politically. It also
puts the Likud Party and Sharon, as its leader, at odds with
President Bush, who has said he supports the establishment of a
Palestinian state alongside Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "In the midst of a terror campaign run by [Palestinian Authority
President Yasser] Arafat," Likud members "don't want to envision a
terrorist state which would threaten the destruction of Israel,"
Netanyahu said after the anti-state resolution passed.</TE>
<TE>   The defeat reflected the political reality that since his election
in February 2001, Sharon has been more popular with Israeli voters
than he is within his hawkish party. Netanyahu demonstrated Sunday
that he controls a majority of the central committee, the body that
will choose who will lead the Likud into the next elections.</TE>
<TE>   During the raucous gathering, Sharon engaged in a verbal slugfest
with Netanyahu over who has been tougher on Arafat. Several times,
the meeting degenerated into shouting matches between dozens of
supporters of each man.</TE>
<TE>   The spectacle, broadcast live on Israel Television, couldn't have
come at a worse time for Sharon. With Israeli troops finally out of
Palestinian-controlled areas occupied during the army's six-week
sweep through the West Bank, there have been growing signs that
diplomacy might supplant bloodshed, at least for a time.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, Sharon postponed a planned invasion of the Gaza
Strip, partly because senior members of the defense establishment
said the operation would scuttle peace efforts. The leaders of Egypt,
Saudi Arabia and Syria held a summit and issued a joint statement
saying they want peace with Israel. Saudi Arabia's foreign minister
told reporters that his country and others are now pressuring Arafat
to fight terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But within the Likud Party, there is growing sentiment for
finishing the Palestinian Authority and getting rid of Arafat, and
Netanyahu is promising that he can deliver. He and his supporters say
that, unlike Sharon, Netanyahu will not form a broad-based coalition
that includes the Labor Party if Likud wins elections scheduled for
November 2003. Instead, they say, Netanyahu will put together a
hard-right government that will finish dismantling the 1993 Oslo
peace accords, which Israel signed with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's acceptance of the idea of a Palestinian state has always
been a qualified one. He has said that such a state would not field
an army and would be built on less than half the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   It would not include East Jerusalem, captured by Israel from
Jordan during the 1967 Middle East War. It would not have control
over water resources, its borders or its airspace.</TE>
<TE>   Polls show that a majority of Israeli voters share Sharon's view
that a Palestinian state should eventually be established.</TE>
<TE>   But among the party faithful represented in the Likud central
committee, sentiment runs strongly against creation of such a state
in the West Bank and Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   "Any decision taken today on the final agreement is dangerous to
the state of Israel and will only intensify the pressure on us,"
Sharon told thousands of delegates who gathered under blue-and-white
Likud banners and beneath an image of the steely-eyed party founder
and former prime minister, Menachem Begin. A gigantic photograph of
Begin, who died in 1992, served as a podium backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   "Peace is possible" with the Palestinians, Sharon said, but only
if they first reform the Palestinian Authority and bring about "a
complete halt to the terror, violence and incitement. The Palestinian
Authority must carry out internal reforms in every way: on security,
the economy, the legal system and within society."</TE>
<TE>   Only then, Sharon said, would he engage in negotiations that would
achieve a settlement through phases. He did not reiterate his support
for a Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd cheered the portly Sharon enthusiastically when he
entered the hall flanked by security officers and supporters and
lumbered onto the stage, where he sat flanked by his Likud Cabinet
ministers and Netanyahu. The delegates clapped loudly when Sharon
spoke of Operation Defensive Shield, the just-completed military
incursion into the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   But Netanyahu's supporters began chanting and heckling when Sharon
chastised previous governments for their "naivete" in signing
agreements with Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not shake Arafat's hand," Sharon said, referring to
Netanyahu's handshake with Arafat when the two signed the Wye River
agreement in Maryland in 1998. That pact reaffirmed the 1993 Oslo
peace accords and ceded more West Bank territory to the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Netanyahu tried to quiet the crowds, although he had been heckled
to a standstill several times during his own speech.</TE>
<TE>   Netanyahu told the delegates that he opposes independent statehood
for the Palestinians as a threat to Israel's existence.</TE>
<TE>   "Sovereign rule: yes. State: no," said the former prime minister,
who urged the government to expel Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no choice but to exile Arafat," he told the cheering
crowd. During a recent U.S. tour on behalf of the government,
Netanyahu said, he needed to explain not why Israel should expel
Arafat, but why it has not.</TE>
<TE>   Netanyahu also criticized Sharon for agreeing to participate in a
regional conference and said that even a Palestinian state without
Arafat as its leader would pose a threat to Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to forge a compromise between the two men continued up
until the committee meeting began, to no avail.</TE>
<TE>   A string of committee members who spoke to the gathering before
Netanyahu and Sharon urged the party to display unity and rally
around its prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   Former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government fell because of
a split within the right, as did Netanyahu's government, said Yitzhak
Ben-Gad, Israel's former consul general in Chicago. "We have to stay
together and support this prime minister," he pleaded.</TE>
<TE>   Zalman Shoval, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States
and current Sharon foreign policy advisor, told the crowd that
"everybody agrees a Palestinian state is not good for the Jews." But
only unity, he said, will make it possible for Likud to solve the
problems Israel faces.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the evening was more about tensions inside a party
that realizes it may soon have to define its parameters for
negotiating with the Palestinians--and that faces an all-out
leadership battle--than it was about a resolution few delegates
believe will actually prevent the establishment of a Palestinian
state.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone in the Likud appreciates very much what the prime
minister has done to fight terror," said Zeev Boim, head of Likud's
parliamentary faction. "But the question here is: What is the future?
What kind of a political solution will we pursue?"</TE>

<HD>PAN Candidate Takes the Lead in Ciudad Juarez</HD>
<DH>Mexico: The mayoral race in the nation's largest border
city is seen as a critical test of efforts by the PRI to redefine
itself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>President Vicente Fox's National Action Party, or PAN, clung to a
slim lead Sunday night in the Ciudad Juarez mayoral election, a
closely watched race climaxing at a time of increasing national
political turmoil and polarization.</LD>
<LD>   With 91% of the ballots counted in Mexico's largest border city,
the PAN's Jesus Alfredo Delgado led with 127,557 votes, or 47.1% of
those cast, to 123,080, or 45.4%, for Roberto Barraza of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.</LD>
<LD>   The contest was Ciudad Juarez's second mayoral election in 10
months. The first, in July, was annulled because winner Delgado had
run TV spots across the border in El Paso, which is against Mexican
law. Juarez currently has a provisional mayor.</LD>
<TE>   Polls just before Sunday's election indicated that the race was
too close to call. Voter turnout Sunday was described as low.</TE>
<TE>   With a population of about 1.5 million, Juarez has been a PAN
stronghold for most of the last two decades and has been governed by
the party since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   The mayoral election was seen as a critical test of efforts by the
PRI to redefine itself--after its loss of the 2000 presidential
election to Fox--and to appeal to younger and more affluent voters.</TE>
<TE>   The PRI had hoped to capitalize on the inability of the previous
elected mayor, a PAN member, to solve serial killings now totaling
more than 250 victims, mostly young women. The city's economy,
dominated by foreign-owned assembly plants called maquiladoras, has
been hit hard by the U.S. recession. Thousands of jobs have been lost
since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   A victory in Juarez would give the PRI momentum in the run-up to
next year's national elections, in which six governorships and 300
seats in the Chamber of Deputies are up for grabs.</TE>
<TE>   But border states generally and Chihuahua especially have been
bastions of strength for the PAN as it rose to national prominence.
Chihuahua's current governor, Patricio Martinez, is from the PRI,
however.</TE>
<TE>   To boost its chances, the PRI borrowed a page from the PAN's
playbook by forming an alliance with three other parties to make
Barraza a coalition candidate. PRI bylaws were changed last year to
permit such alliances.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two years, the PAN has allied with other parties to
win several important national contests, including the governorships
of Yucatan and Chiapas states.</TE>
<TE>   Political analyst Alfonso Zarate of the GCI consulting firm in
Mexico City stressed that the Juarez election ultimately would be
decided by local issues and should not be viewed as a "thermometer"
of the nationwide political climate.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a city which does not reflect the electoral mosaic of
Mexico. It has characteristics that are very different from the rest
of the country," Zarate said. "It's a border city, with very little
indigenous population [and] with a very strong entrepreneurial and
democratic spirit."</TE>
<TE>   Also stressing voters' local concerns, political scientist
Federico Estevez of Mexico's Autonomous Technological Institute said
the PAN was hurt by "10 years of serial murders, large problems in
public security and a little recession on its hands."</TE>
<TE>   If Delgado wins, it would be despite Fox's declining popularity.
The president's domestic agenda has stalled in a bitterly divided
Congress in which no party has a majority. His campaign to secure
concessions from President Bush on immigration, border infrastructure
and other binational issues has made little progress.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech Thursday night in New York that seemed aimed at his
domestic critics, Fox warned that there could be no "privileged
relation between the United States and Mexico without a real advance
in substantive issues in our bilateral agenda."</TE>
<TE>   Topping that agenda is regularizing the status of about 3 million
illegal Mexican immigrants in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's PAN received another slap last week when a federal election
tribunal voted to reopen an investigation of alleged illegal election
financing during the president's victorious 2000 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The judges' decision came as a federal judge issued warrants for
the arrest of six former Petroleos Mexicanos executives in connection
with illegal diversions of $173 million in Pemex funds to the oil
workers union in the year before Fox took office.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have told local news media that some of the money
was used to finance the PRI's losing presidential campaign in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Just as the PRI had charged the Fox administration with using the
Pemex investigation for electoral purposes, there were murmurings in
the PAN corner that the reopening of the Fox election finance case
was somehow political retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   Not likely, said political scientist Jose Antonio Crespo of the
Center for Economic Research and Teaching. He said that the two
events were probably coincidental.</TE>

<LD>   The men were repairing the roof of the Russian space shuttle
hangar at the cosmodrome, the principal location for Russia's rocket
launches, when three of five columns supporting the roof fell,
burying the construction team in rubble.</LD>
<LD>   Immediate rescue efforts proved impossible because of high winds
and unstable walls.</LD>
<TE>   A team of 30 rescue workers from the Russian Ministry of Emergency
Situations flew to Baikonur, about 1,300 miles southeast of Moscow,
late Sunday, but officials were pessimistic about finding any of the
eight repair workers alive.</TE>
<TE>   The 1980s building, a vast Soviet-era hangar used to house the
Buran space shuttle, was poorly built and in bad condition.</TE>
<TE>   Sergei A. Gorbunov, spokesman for the Russian Space Agency, said
in a telephone interview that it was unlikely the eight workers could
have survived such a fall.</TE>
<TE>   He said there was a model of the Buran space shuttle in the
building when the roof caved in. The Buran project is defunct: The
craft flew only once, 14 years ago, then became a space dinosaur.</TE>
<TE>   The collapse underlines Russia's problems upgrading big, decaying
Soviet-era infrastructure, not just in the space industry but in the
military and many other sectors--some privatized, some still
controlled by the state.</TE>
<TE>   Russia is plagued by fires--such as a devastating blaze at the
Ostankino television headquarters in Moscow nearly two years
ago--along with breakdowns, air crashes, oil spills and other
mishaps, often due to aging infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   Playing down the damage to the prestige of Russia's space
industry, Gorbunov emphasized that the building was used only for a
discontinued program, not current projects.</TE>
<TE>   "It was more a museum than a production facility. The building was
a huge storage facility for something that had already become
history, something that would never be used," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Buran that flew into space is housed elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that the building's roof collapsed does not mean that
the Russian space complex is in decline. Accidents happen in any
country and under any regime," Gorbunov said.</TE>
<TE>   The building, 900 feet long and 600 feet wide, was built of
concrete slabs.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the roof is gone, the entire building starts to topple like
a house of cards, its walls falling inside the building," said
Gorbunov. "Naturally, the building is old, and as time went by, it
required more and more money to be pumped into it."</TE>
<TE>   Although located in Kazakhstan, Baikonur, formerly the centerpiece
of the Soviet space program, is leased by Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Contradicting Gorbunov, Lyudmila Pavlova, a Russian space engineer
who worked in the collapsed building, said by telephone from Baikonur
that the Buran now under rubble is the shuttle that orbited Earth,
not a model.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole building very much resembles what the Chernobyl nuclear
power plant looked like after the meltdown," Pavlova said.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, besides being an accident that claims human lives,
the collapse of the building also has a symbolic meaning. It
symbolizes the decay, or rather the collapse, of Baikonur," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Who will be willing to sign contracts with us if buildings are
allowed to deteriorate to such a state that they simply tumble down
by themselves? It is a painful blow to the country's prestige and its
reputation," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Emergency Situations Minister Gennady Korotkin said the
Russian rescue workers' first task was to determine the stability of
the remaining structure.</TE>
<TE>   "People other than specialists cannot approach the building. It is
impossible now to start any rescue operation," he said on state-
controlled ORT television.</TE>
<TE>   Gorbunov said storms were forecast for the next three days,
complicating the rescue effort.</TE>

<LD>Analysts who say the economy is on the mend will have a tough time
convincing Van Nuys businessman Bob Lieberman.</LD>
<LD>   The president of DeMott Technologies Corp., which makes
metal-forming machines used to manufacture commercial airplane parts,
has watched sales nose dive since the September terrorist attacks.
Customers have canceled $1million in orders, and the phones aren't
ringing with new ones. Lieberman's once-bustling factory floor is so
quiet that he recently parked his wife's car there to have it waxed.</LD>
<LD>   "Recovery? What recovery?" Lieberman asked. "I don't see it in my
little world."</LD>
<TE>   Just a few yards away in the same industrial corridor, business is
bustling for C&amp;C Drilling Inc. Crews are working feverishly, digging
environmental soil samples for construction clients itching to break
ground on new housing and commercial buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so busy that I'm turning down work every day," said Yvon
Corbiere, C&amp;C's vice president.</TE>
<TE>   This blue-collar pocket of the San Fernando Valley isn't the only
place where businesspeople are trying to decipher mixed signals about
the state's $1.4-trillion economy. Last year's unusual downturn has
given way to an atypical recovery, with sectors such as housing and
health care swaggering through the slowdown while manufacturing,
high-tech and other industries stagger.</TE>
<TE>   The view from the trenches depends on where you stand.</TE>
<TE>   While the nation's and states' economies are improving, albeit
slowly, recent indicators seem to provide conflicting information.
Data on consumer confidence and orders for durable goods move ahead
one month only to retreat the next. Oil prices rise and fall on
changing Middle East tensions, while investors remain jittery about
the latest Enron-style accounting scandal and flagging corporate
profits.</TE>
<TE>   The scrambled picture has led many economists to view California's
rebound with caution, even though the state, particularly Southern
California, has come through the slowdown better than the nation as a
whole.</TE>
<TE>   "There is still a lot of uncertainty out there," said economist
Dennis Aigner, who directs an annual survey of Orange County business
executives for UC Irvine's Graduate School of Management. The most
recent results show business leaders much less bullish than they were
two years ago, even as Orange County ranks among the state's
brightest economic stars, its 3.7% unemployment rate one of the
lowest in the state.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing a lot of caution," Aigner said.</TE>
<TE>   Such fear might seem unjustified given that growth in gross
domestic product in the first quarter was a solid 5.8%. But much of
that surge was the result of companies rebuilding depleted
inventories. Unlike typical consumer-led downturns, this one was
sparked by businesses that stopped purchasing capital equipment. But
while companies sat on the sidelines, consumers kept spending,
enticed by low mortgage rates and interest-free auto financing deals.</TE>
<TE>   That helped prop up the U.S. economy and soften the effect of the
business investment slump and the 9/11 tragedy. The downside is that
since consumers, who represent two-thirds of the economy, never
closed their wallets, they probably won't power the economy forward
this year with the pent-up demand seen in past recoveries.</TE>
<TE>   That's bad news for retailers such as department stores, which
already were suffering at the hands of discounters before last year's
slowdown. Federated Department Stores Inc., for example, posted a 6%
decline in April sales compared with the same month last year.</TE>
<TE>   Federated's Macy's West division expects sales to rise slowly over
the year, said Chief Executive Jeremiah J. Sullivan. The company is
planning conservatively, with orders, inventories and payroll roughly
similar to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   State Slower to</TE>
<TE>   Create New Jobs</TE>
<TE>   Hiring in most industries is expected to be weak this year in
California as well as the rest of the nation. Companies are likely to
hold off adding new workers until they are sure the recovery has
staying power. Though California's unemployment rate climbed to 6.4%
in April from 5% a year earlier, the state's job losses have been
less severe relative to those of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Still, California isn't showing the ability to create new jobs
anywhere near the pace it did during the height of the technology
boom. Through the end of April, the state has seen a net gain of only
10,500 new jobs for a growing labor force of more than 17.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Employers are not yet certain about the strength and
sustainability of the recovery," said Howard Roth, chief economist at
the state Department of Finance. "They are waiting to see."</TE>
<TE>   Ongoing profit pressure will compel many firms to keep their
staffs lean even as the economy recovers. This new austerity is
already evident in the entertainment industry, where cost-cutting
measures are likely to stick.</TE>
<TE>   The most visible effect has been on television production, a
renowned Southern California gravy train that's being forced to shed
excess baggage. Last year's 6% drop in network TV ad revenue has led
to changes in the system, including shorter shoots, leaner payrolls
and more production in cheaper locales.</TE>
<TE>   Such practices will continue even as the economy recovers,
according to Dana Walden, co-president of 20th Century Fox Television
Inc., the TV production arm of Fox Broadcasting Co. Walden said Fox
will be making only 18 pilots this year versus 24 in 2001 in an
effort to cut costs.</TE>
<TE>   "We're producing less and scrutinizing where we spend our money,
only going for the shows where we stand to make the most money,"
Walden said. "That won't reverse," regardless of any economic
rebound.</TE>
<TE>   There are some sectors in which the recent downturn was virtually
nonexistent. The $1.3-trillion health-care industry added about
300,000 jobs nationally in 2001--nearly 25,000 of them in
California--a trend that is expected to continue as baby boomers age.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, residential real estate has been a mainstay for the
state's economy, in contrast to the recession of the early '90s when
falling home prices combined with a collapsing aerospace industry to
wallop Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Low interest rates and a fast-growing population have kept new
buyers streaming into the market over the last year, fueling
double-digit annual appreciation in many areas.</TE>
<TE>   Home values even in what are considered "affordable" California
markets are fast outpacing competing regions. The Inland Empire saw
its median-priced home top $170,000 in April, putting it ahead of
Phoenix and Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Though there is some talk of a looming real estate bubble, the
activity nevertheless has benefited a slew of related businesses,
from real estate agents, banks and mortgage brokers to entrepreneurs
such as Van Nuys driller Corbiere. He says his biggest problem is
keeping up with the demand for all those soil samples for new
construction.</TE>
<TE>   Other sectors of the California real estate industry haven't been
as fortunate--most notably the commercial office market in downtown
San Francisco. The vacancy rate for Class A office space reached 21%
in the first quarter this year, up from virtually zero during the
height of the dot-com frenzy in the summer of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The office space fallout is merely a symptom of the bigger problem
confronting the Bay Area and other tech-dependent economies--when
will high-tech turn around? If first-quarter financial results are
any guide, it won't be soon.</TE>
<TE>   No Improvement</TE>
<TE>   Seen Until 2003</TE>
<TE>   Computer, telecom and wireless firms continue to slash jobs and
post dismal earnings because their corporate customers aren't buying
new business equipment. Some analysts predict no improvement until
2003 at the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   That could have severe consequences for California's export
sector--nearly half of which is represented by high-tech goods. Last
year, the state saw its overall exports decline nearly 11% to
$106.8billion. The main culprit was the state's information
technology sector. Exports of computers and electronic products
totaled $50.3billion in 2001, an 18% decline from 2000. That more
than offset gains in other areas such as agriculture products, which
increased 9% to $3.9billion.</TE>
<TE>   With many overseas economies still in the doldrums and a strong
dollar making U.S. goods expensive, California exporters can expect
another challenging year, said Ross DeVol of the Milken Institute in
Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are some signs of life. Global semiconductor sales in
March rose 7.2% from the previous month. Though sales are still
sharply lower than a year ago, some industry watchers say it's a
signal that the worst is over.</TE>
<TE>   California's hard-hit tourism sector likewise is clawing its way
back, thanks to a strong drive market and some help from a
state-funded marketing campaign. At the beginning of the year, summer
visitor spending in 2002 was expected to be down 9% compared with
2001. That figure has since been revised to a 5% drop.</TE>
<TE>   Still, foreign visitors will be in short supply. And many business
travelers, fed up with high air fares and security hassles, haven't
returned to the skies. That's hurting the bottom lines of airlines,
hotels and others that depend on those big-spending customers.</TE>
<TE>   Feeling the squeeze are businesses such as Suzuki Enterprises
Inc., which supplies Asian-style in-flight meals to carriers at Los
Angeles International Airport. Shelly Suzuki, executive director of
the Inglewood firm, said business is off about 50% from where it was
last September.</TE>
<TE>   Though that's an improvement from the bleak period just after the
terrorist attacks, Suzuki said she's not yet declaring an end to her
personal recession.</TE>
<TE>   "Things aren't getting any worse," Suzuki said. "But it doesn't
feel like a recovery yet."</TE>

<HD>Networks Putting On a Show for Ad Dollars</HD>
<DH>TV: Fall lineups will be unveiled before potential sponsors
in a dramatic extravaganza this week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES and SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In New York today, network television executives will start rolling
out one of their biggest productions of the year--but one that most
TV viewers will never see.</LD>
<LD>   This springtime ritual is called the "advertising upfronts." It's
a frantic, lucrative creative bazaar where networks trot out their
new fall TV shows and their star actors to dazzle advertisers. The
six major networks--NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, UPN and WB--will sell about
70% of their season's commercials, worth some $7 billion, during
intense negotiations between now and Independence Day.</LD>
<LD>   The advertising derby officially begins this week as the networks
take turns unveiling trailers of their new shows at venues such as
Carnegie Hall, Radio City Music Hall and Madison Square Garden. Their
presentations are followed by lavish parties at Tavern on the Green
and other upscale Manhattan spots. The places will be filled to
capacity by TV producers, Wall Street analysts, talent agents and
advertising executives with powerful clients in tow, including Pfizer
Inc., Maybelline, Toyota Motor Corp. and Anheuser-Busch Cos. The ad
buyers will be loaded up with DVDs and videos of the new shows.</LD>
<TE>   The upfronts are a critical barometer of the overall health of the
television industry and of each of the networks, giving Wall Street a
rough financial road map for the year ahead. It's also a
make-or-break moment for Hollywood TV production studios, which hope
to win valuable spots on prime time after a year of labor.</TE>
<TE>   "Our entire year in television comes down to the next few days,"
said Sam Haskell, head of worldwide television at William Morris
Agency Inc., a leading talent agency. "It's like being an expectant
parent in a maternity ward waiting room."</TE>
<TE>   Haskell's agency has represented such hits as ABC's "Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire" and such flops as NBC's short-lived "Emeril." The
buzz is that William Morris is trying to land two dozen new shows on
network schedules this fall.</TE>
<TE>   The networks are eager to rebound from last year, when ad sales
fell 16% to $6.9billion, down from a record $8.1 billion the year
before. Only two years ago, the networks were enjoying the dizzying
dot-com boom when they sold out their advance ad inventory in four
days.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Wall Street analysts and some TV executives said the
upfront advertising sales could climb 3% to 8%. But they still worry
that ad sales could be disappointing because of continued uncertainty
about the economy, the ongoing defection of viewers to cable channels
and the emergence of a few advertising conglomerates that control
about 80% of TV advertising dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "There's all this hoopla [at the upfronts]," said Ira Carlin,
chairman of advertising firm Magna Global USA. "The networks are
trying to create a bandwagon effect.... What's going on now is
psychological warfare. It's this annual tug of war."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, trickery is part of the battle plan as the networks
build hype and keep everyone guessing. Every year, bogus network
schedules circulate in hotels occupied by talent agents, writers and
studio executives. This year, it's rumored that NBC will leak three
different fall schedules to throw off its competitors.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to locking up ad spots on hot shows such as CBS' "CSI:
Crime Scene Investigation" and NBC's "The West Wing," advertisers are
scouting for new hit shows. "Advertisers buy place holders, so if a
new show is hot, then they are on it," Carlin said.</TE>
<TE>   Networks typically sell 10 minutes of commercials for every hour
of prime-time. Their ad rates vary dramatically depending on the
popularity of a show and the demographics of the viewers. On NBC's
hit medical show "ER," a 30-second ad can cost $460,600, while on
CBS' drama "Touched by an Angel," the same ad would cost $63,200.</TE>
<TE>   Ad buyers, armed with gut instincts, research data on who watches
each show and early test results on who might tune in to a new one,
parcel out their ad dollars with care. They look for not only the
highest-rated shows but also specific types of viewers. Young viewers
are the most valuable for advertisers because they are considered
impressionable and apt to change their buying habits--and their brand
of toothpaste, beer or cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   "These [advertising] deals are pretty much made on age and sex,"
said Jon Nesvig, president of advertising sales for Fox network.</TE>
<TE>   NBC is top-rated among affluent viewers ages 18 to 49, and that's
why Lexus, the most popular luxury car brand, gravitates to the
network.</TE>
<TE>   "The best place we found is NBC for those upscale viewers," said
Roy Rothstein, a vice president at Zenith Media, whose ad clients
include Lexus and Verizon Communications Inc.</TE>
<TE>   CBS historically has reached older viewers with such shows as "60
Minutes" and "Touched by an Angel." Though advertisers typically pay
less to reach older viewers, the network is in the sweet spot for
some pharmaceutical companies offering Viagra or arthritis drugs.
CBS, however, has been making progress in getting younger viewers
with shows such as "Survivor" and "Everybody Loves Raymond."</TE>
<TE>   Preparation Begins</TE>
<TE>   a Year in Advance</TE>
<TE>   The creative process for the upfronts began in July, when talent
agencies and studios started assembling show ideas, writers, actors,
producers and directors for the fall 2002 season. By Christmas, the
networks had bought more than 500 scripts and then winnowed those
down to 115 TV pilots that were ordered in January. Production of
these pilots began in March and April, and only about 35 will make
the final fall schedules.</TE>
<TE>   During the last two weeks, network presidents, their bosses and
their staffs have been holed up in screening rooms around Los Angeles
and New York, grading each show to plug holes in their schedules.
Producers and actors won't know if their shows make the cut until a
day or two before a network presents its fall lineup this week.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, NBC presents its fall schedule first, today at Radio
City Music Hall. NBC, owned by General Electric Co., is expected to
put on relatively few new shows because of its solid lineup, which
includes "The West Wing" and "Will &amp; Grace." But the network is
looking to find a replacement on Thursdays for its top-rated sitcom,
"Friends," which is headed into its final year.</TE>
<TE>   "[NBC's] best shows are getting long in the tooth, and they need a
next generation of hits," said Tim Spengler, a top ad buyer at
Initiative Media North America, which spends $2 billion for clients
such as Maybelline and Home Depot Inc.</TE>
<TE>   ABC will unveil its fall schedule on Tuesday at the New Amsterdam
Theatre. The theater, which holds 1,800, is hardly big enough for the
droves of ad buyers, talent agents, network and studio executives and
reporters who will stampede the venue. ABC, owned by Walt Disney Co.,
is in the worst shape among the major networks after losing 24% of
its prime-time audience this season. ABC needs a big lineup change,
with new shows every night.</TE>
<TE>   CBS, owned by Viacom Inc., rolls out its schedule Wednesday at
Carnegie Hall. CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves, a former actor,
loves the drama and theater of the upfront presentations and is the
most insistent about keeping the lineup a secret. Moonves orders
staff members who deal with the media to leave their cell phones and
pagers in a hotel room so they won't be tempted to slip details of
CBS' new plan. A velvet curtain covers CBS' list of the new fall
schedule until Moonves regally lifts it at a news conference before
the formal presentation.</TE>
<TE>   Fox network, owned by News Corp., presents its offerings on
Thursday. Fox is coming off a disappointing season and has plenty of
gaps to fill with "The X-Files" and "Ally McBeal" finishing their run
this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Every network has some weakness. But the established
networks--CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox--charge the highest rates because
they bring in the biggest TV audiences. Last year, NBC was the big
winner at the upfronts, selling $2 billion of commercials, followed
by ABC with $1.7 billion, CBS with $1.4 billion, and Fox with $1.3
billion, according to the Jack Myers Report, an industry newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   NBC and CBS are expected to fare better this year than ABC and Fox
because of their stronger ratings.</TE>
<TE>   One unknown is whether the networks can maintain the rates they
charge, given an overall advertising slowdown, competition from cable
and the consolidation of major ad agencies. In the last decade,
scores of agencies have been bought up by four international
conglomerates.</TE>
<TE>   "We are so large that we have a good idea of what the market is,
because we are the market," said ad buyer Spengler.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing worse than paying too much is not getting on a
[popular] show," said Joe Abruzzese, CBS' president of network
advertising sales. "There's nothing worse than going back to a client
and saying, 'I couldn't spend your money or get you on "Everybody
Loves Raymond" or "Survivor."'"</TE>
<TE>   Major Networks Must Compete With Cable</TE>
<TE>   Back in the 1980s ABC, NBC and CBS had all the negotiating power
with ad agencies because of their dominance over prime-time. Today,
upstart networks such as UPN and WB provide alternatives, as do cable
channels that charge lower rates and have more defined audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a year ago cable channels grabbed $4 billion, or 37% of
the total upfront ad market, compared with only 19% a decade ago. But
cable networks sell only half their commercial time well in advance,
giving advertisers more flexibility to wait and buy ads on the open
market.</TE>
<TE>   But Jamie Kellner, president of AOL Time Warner Inc.'s Turner
Broadcasting System, which oversees WB and cable channels including
TBS, CNN and Cartoon Network, acknowledges that "cable still gets the
[advertising] leftovers."</TE>
<TE>   Some network TV executives have broken from the springtime
tradition of selling most of their ad inventory. In a risky maneuver
last year that astonished his rivals, Mel Karmazin, president of
Viacom, which also owns UPN, sold 10% less of his network TV
inventory than usual at the upfronts. Karmazin bet that the economy
would bounce back and that his slate of new shows would pull in high
ratings and therefore higher ad rates.</TE>
<TE>   His strategy could have backfired because of the shaky economy.
But the ratings at ABC and Fox plummeted, forcing the two networks to
give advertisers extra air time for failing to meet ratings
guarantees. That left only CBS and NBC with ad inventory to sell on
the spot market, which, some say, inflated prices.</TE>
<TE>   Another evolution in the ad auction frenzy is bulk deals that go
beyond prime time. Today's media giants, such as AOL Time Warner,
Viacom, News Corp. and Disney, own everything from broadcast networks
to cable channels, radio stations, billboards, magazines and music
companies.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, companies have experimented with bundling ads
across their vast holdings in so-called cross-platform deals.</TE>
<TE>   Now there are reports of a $1-billion advertising deal being
negotiated by Disney and ad conglomerate OMD USA Inc., which
represents such clients as consumer products maker Procter &amp; Gamble
Co. and Pizza Hut Inc. If so, this would be the biggest advertising
deal ever, tripling the previous record.</TE>

<DH>Community: Alliance Schools' goal is to give all parties,
especially parents, an active role in solving problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSE CARDENAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 42 campuses throughout Los Angeles County, a grass-roots movement
is underway to show how a school's disparate constituencies--parents,
teachers, principals and support staff--can band together to solve
problems. Their name captures their mission: "Alliance Schools."</LD>
<LD>   The aim is to give all parties, especially parents, a say in how
to improve a school, from controlling dangerous traffic on nearby
streets to deciding how to spend the budget.</LD>
<LD>   In Texas, Alliance Schools are a legendary statewide network of
elementary and high schools whose parents, teachers and
administrators over two decades worked to become an influential force
in that state's school reform debate.</LD>
<TE>   In Texas and now Los Angeles, Alliance Schools are part of the
complex community organizing work of the Industrial Areas Foundation,
for decades a prominent group nationally in the grass-roots activism
movement.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation's organizing tools--house meetings, seminars and
retreats--are designed to galvanize people around common concerns and
prepare them to be active in civic affairs.</TE>
<TE>   The organizing that has been occurring over the past year at
Sierra Park Elementary School east of downtown Los Angeles
illustrates the patient process of building that power.</TE>
<TE>   After months of house meetings and one-on-one chats, the effort
finally paid off one recent Saturday morning for about 300 parents,
teachers and school staff who gathered on campus for a short rally.
Then, chanting and carrying signs, they dispersed into the
square-mile neighborhood around the school to knock on doors.</TE>
<TE>   The aim was to ask parents what they thought were the main
problems hindering their students at the low-performing--though
improving--school.</TE>
<TE>   "We want you to get involved in your children's education,"
parents such as Cynthia Benitez, mother of two daughters at Sierra
Park, exhorted other parents who opened their doors.</TE>
<TE>   The march, called a Walk for Success, is a benchmark for parents
and staff organized under the foundation's principles--the first
fruit of their labor after months of organizing.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt that we all needed that first step," said parent Valerie
Munoz, "to bring us together as parents and teachers and
administrators--people in the community."</TE>
<TE>   Last summer the foundation received the blessing of Los Angeles
Unified School District Supt. Roy Romer to begin organizing parents,
teachers, classified employees and administrators at 25 campuses.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in community organizing," Romer said in an interview.
"We share common roots and interests in how you bring renewed energy
into instruction."</TE>
<TE>   A year later, foundation organizers are working at 27 L.A. Unified
schools--such as Trinity Street in South Los Angeles, Park Avenue in
Cudahy and North Hollywood High--and expect the number to grow to 35
by year's end. The group is also working at 15 schools in Pomona,
Pasadena, Lynwood, Compton and Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   To band together different campuses, the foundation holds
conferences where school leaders can discuss the issues they all
face. Last year more than 700 delegates attended the foundation's
education summit at Occidental College. About 400 delegates gathered
recently at Sacred Heart Church in Lincoln Heights for the
foundation's Spring Assembly, where they urged local superintendents
to send principals to Alliance Schools training.</TE>
<TE>   Alliance Schools' aim is to transform what the foundation sees as
hierarchical chains of command at schools--orders trickling down from
the top--to systems in which all parties, particularly parents,
participate equally in improving children's education.</TE>
<TE>   Foundation staffers do not run the schools or set agendas.
Instead, they train educators and parents on how to work together.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Educator Writes Books on Texas Movement</TE>
<TE>   The work of Alliance Schools in Texas is seen by some in academia
as unique in school-reform strategies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's some of the best stuff going on," said Dennis Shirley,
chairman of Boston College's department of teacher education, who has
written two books on the Texas movement. "The critical piece is the
parent-engagement component.... You can't be a victim: 'My life is
hopeless, I can't do anything to improve my life.'"</TE>
<TE>   Like foundation organizers, Shirley prefers the word "engagement,"
rather than "involvement," to describe parents' role.</TE>
<TE>   The difference to him is that engagement grants parents power,
such as helping a principal determine how to spend a budget. Parental
involvement as practiced in most schools, Shirley said, is a more
passive role, in which parents help with activities, such as reading
to a group of children, but are kept out of the decision-making
process.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation hopes that its work in schools here eventually will
equal its record in Texas, where the organization has the ear of
state education officials and politicians are eager to speak at the
Alliance Schools' annual conference.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not trying to replicate Alliance Schools per se," said Ken
Fujimoto, a foundation organizer working with schools on the
Eastside. "We are trying to learn from the experience of Texas."</TE>
<TE>   In L.A., organizers are selecting schools with principals open to
the group's philosophies, particularly those open to parents'
constant presence on campus.</TE>
<TE>   "What we want to do here is to engage the parents to have some
type of ownership of the community and the schools," said Eugene
Hernandez, principal of Sierra Park.</TE>
<TE>   What sets Alliance Schools' strategy apart is its aim of turning
parents and school personnel into a voting bloc.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want more resources for things like after-school programs,
they're not going to hand them over just because you ask for them,"
Fujimoto said. Politicians "have to feel there's a constituency out
there."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there are, in my humble opinion, a whole lot of
other people who are trying to fight for school reforms, thinking
about the question of power," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Alliance Schools is not the first time that activists associated
with the Industrial Areas Foundation have spoken out on school reform
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the ideas for the LEARN Schools strategy--which sought to
increase local control of schools and was implemented at about 400
L.A. Unified campuses--started with foundation-affiliated community
activists.</TE>
<TE>   But the strategy, launched in 1993, was shaped by numerous other
voices in the community and school district officials. L.A. Unified
has shut down the office that used to coordinate LEARN programs, but
at many schools the LEARN committees, composed of school principals,
parents and civic leaders, still meet in an unofficial capacity.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, foundation organizers argue, the LEARN program did not
include the parental involvement that Alliance Schools worked to
achieve in more than 120 schools in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The crown jewel of Alliance Schools' success there is a yearly
grant from the Texas Legislature. The grant has provided millions of
dollars to support Alliance Schools' projects at individual schools,
such as special training for parents and teachers or improving
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   In one of his books about Alliance Schools, "Community Organizing
for Urban School Reform," Shirley presented five case studies of
low-performing schools that turned things around.</TE>
<TE>   One was Ysleta Elementary in El Paso where, as frequently happens
at Alliance Schools, the most pressing concern parents had was not
education but safety. The Ysleta community had long complained about
the lack of crosswalks and traffic lights around the school.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, after a girl was hit by a car, angry parents formed a
traffic committee and, through a series of confrontational meetings
with public officials, got them to install various traffic controls.</TE>
<TE>   Another concern was the children's health. The parents took a
survey and found that many children came to school sick because their
families could not afford medical or dental care. So, the school
acquired funding and opened a health center.</TE>
<TE>   The school also opened a parents center where adults could brush
up on math and reading to help their children do homework.</TE>
<TE>   The actions paid dividends in the classroom. One example: In 1993,
according to Shirley's book, only 27% of Ysleta's fourth-graders
passed the reading portion of a state test. But by 1994, 61% passed
the same portion.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'They Had People From Everywhere'</TE>
<TE>   Such successes are all the talk at the annual Texas Alliance
Schools conference.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the parents, teachers and principals organizing in the Los
Angeles schools have traveled to the conference. Sierra Park
fifth-grade teacher Rafael Alvarez Jr., who helped organize his
school's Walk for Success, found it inspiring.</TE>
<TE>   "They had people from everywhere: El Paso, Houston, Dallas,
Austin," he recalled. "They talked about the problems they have been
able to tackle. That brought in the big picture: These are the
possibilities."</TE>
<TE>   Now Sierra Park, like other L.A. schools, is reaching for those
possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   After the school's Walk for Success, the next weekly evening
meeting drew about 40 parents and school staff.</TE>
<TE>   The No. 1 concern they heard during their walk was that numerous
stray dogs roam the neighborhood. As a result, the group assigned
someone to invite L.A. City Councilman Nick Pacheco to their next
meeting to ask for his help.</TE>
<TE>   But Sierra Park has bigger goals, such as forming a "parent
academy" where parents can learn academic skills.</TE>
<TE>   So, with those goals in mind, the Walk for Success marked just the
beginning of a long journey.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first started, I thought it was going to be one walk and
we were going to see instant change," said Benitez, a parent leader.
"Now I see it's going to take a lot of time and energy."</TE>

<HD>Smoking Gun Shoots Down Bush View of Power Crisis</HD>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   That deep, mellow voice of Vice President Dick Cheney still
resonates in my ear. It's accentuated now by reverberations from the
Enron smoking gun.</LD>
<LD>   "Frankly, California is looked on by many folks as a classic
example of the kinds of problems that arise when you do use price
caps," Cheney told me in April of last year. "Your problem is that
your demand for electricity is up and your supplies have actually
declined....</LD>
<TE>   "Ultimately, of course, the peak power period this summer will
exceed any capacity the state has and you'll end up in those rolling
brownouts. There's no magic wand that Washington can wave."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney was reflecting the laissez-faire, hidebound ideology of the
new Bush administration. And he could not have been more wrong.</TE>
<TE>   California then did not have wholesale price caps. It had consumer
rate caps that had left private utilities short of enough money to
pay their gouging suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   The power pirates--many of them pals and political patrons of
Cheney and President Bush--were reaping profits of 400% to 600%. The
cost of electricity that private utilities (Edison, PG&amp;E, SDG&amp;E) were
sending consumers soared from $7.4 billion in 1999 to</TE>
<TE>   $27.6 billion in 2000 and seemed headed for $70 billion in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Demand had not been up significantly; indeed, it then was falling.
Supplies were rising.</TE>
<TE>   There was a magic wand Washington could wave. And it finally did
get waved in June after dogged goading by Gov. Gray Davis, other West
Coast Democrats and a new Democratic U.S. Senate. The wand was
regional price caps, imposed by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Those caps--so abhorred by the Bushies--worked with new long-term
power contracts negotiated by Davis, plus a mild summer, to quash the
energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Megawatts that had sold for $321--and frequently exceeded
$1,000--were capped at $92. They soon slid to $60 and now are back
down to $30. That's about where they were when California naively set
out on its ill-fated deregulation venture, which shifted control over
most electricity from the state Public Utilities Commission to the
pro-profiteer FERC.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Cheney's glum prophecy, there were no rolling brownouts
last summer, nor have there been any since.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than the feared $70-billion electricity bill, the tab last
year again was about</TE>
<TE>   $27 billion. Still, if you assume that 1999's $7-billion charge
was reasonable, it means the gougers--most of them
out-of-staters--sucked $40 billion in excess profits out of
California over a two-year period. They broke Edison and PG&amp;E and
forced the state into the power-buying business.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is asking FERC to order refunds totaling $9 billion. Atty.
Gen. Bill Lockyer also is suing energy companies for billions in
penalties, charging they ripped off California.</TE>
<TE>   Now comes the smoking gun, the Enron internal memos disclosed by
FERC that show clear evidence of market manipulation. The documents
indicate that not only Enron, but other companies were fleecing
Californians by driving up prices and triggering blackouts. The Enron
sharpies had brazenly dubbed their strategies Death Star, Fat Boy and
Get Shorty.</TE>
<TE>   One particularly galling scheme was to buy electricity produced by
California plants during blackout threats and sell it for huge
profits in Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   The California public--and the governor--had it right after all:
The shortage was not real, it was contrived by the power pirates. A
Times poll in January 2001 found that most people believed the crisis
was created by profiteers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be the most egregious example in history of
greedy and unethical corporate interests--with the complicity of the
U.S. government--going into a state and raping it economically," says
Garry South, Davis' chief political strategist.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' problem is that although a smoking gun was found, he
already had been seriously wounded. His job performance rating
plummeted a year ago because of the energy crisis and never has
recovered. (Approval 42%, disapproval 49% in the latest Field poll.)</TE>
<TE>   Voters are irked because he procrastinated jumping into the fight
in 2000 and later signed</TE>
<TE>   $43 billion in long-term contracts many consider overpriced. Some
pacts have been renegotiated.</TE>
<TE>   How much will Davis benefit from the smoking gun?</TE>
<TE>   The Republican theory is not a lot. Any benefits are
counterbalanced by other Davis baggage: a software scandal, obsessive
fund-raising and a gaping budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   However, he's bound to be cut some slack.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' message will be that while the feds stood by, he fended off
pirates. Davis slew Goliath.</TE>
<TE>   As for Bush and Cheney, people should listen skeptically to their
future messages about what's good for California.</TE>

<DH>Study: State officials offer alternatives to ease traffic
and improve safety on California 33 through Casitas Springs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new study by Caltrans offers three alternatives for widening and
rerouting two-lane California 33 in Casitas Springs, where the issue
has driven a wedge between residents of the tiny, working-class town.</LD>
<LD>   The preliminary report presented to the public last week offered a
sketchy blueprint for how the north-south artery might be improved to
deal with congestion and safety concerns that have many of Casitas
Springs' 1,120 residents up in arms.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm for an alternative," said Camille Yannahtuono, a nurse at
Ojai Hospital who lives in a home along the highway. "Something has
to be done about the car accidents, the speeding and people trying to
run you off the road."</LD>
<TE>   The study outlined three possibilities, ranging in cost from $75
million to $135 million. They include: building a four-lane bypass
that would reroute traffic around the middle of town; building a
two-lane bypass; or keeping the highway where it is and widening it
to three or four lanes.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed bypass would move the 1.4-mile stretch of road west
of town toward the Ventura River, likely displacing some of the 40
mobile homes in the Arroyo Home Community mobile home park that sit
near the river.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what state and Ventura County transportation officials
decide, it will be years before construction can begin, and not
everyone will be happy with the result.</TE>
<TE>   On one side are those--primarily residents who live in the small
homes lining the 33--who say the 69-year-old roadway is dangerous to
drivers and pedestrians and the source of too many accidents. On the
other side are those--mostly residents of the mobile home park--who
worry that a bypass could force them from their homes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a nice, quiet community," said Phil Boole, who has lived
in the mobile home park for seven years. "Why do you need to change
anything? Traffic has been going past these houses for more than 30
years. If people didn't want the traffic, they shouldn't have bought
a house on the highway."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Durfee and his wife, Darlene, bought their home along
California 33 two years ago. At first, they did not think the traffic
was that bad, Durfee said. But they soon realized the situation was
serious, especially for people trying to back out of their driveways
and children walking along the road to get to their school buses or
the park.</TE>
<TE>   "Our main interest is getting these accidents to stop happening in
our frontyards," Durfee said.</TE>
<TE>   The Durfees started a campaign just months after they moved in to
reroute the estimated 26,500 cars that travel through Casitas Springs
each day. Because of their efforts, signs reading "Support the
Bypass" are posted in the windows of houses and on tree trunks along
the highway.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with 1,500 signatures on a petition supporting a bypass, the
Durfees and their group, the Assn. to Bypass Casitas, caught the
attention of Caltrans and the Ventura County Transportation
Commission, which ordered the study.</TE>
<TE>   The next step will be for the county Transportation Commission to
determine where the bypass project would fit on its list of funding
priorities and then earmark money for a study to be done on the
project's effect on the environment.</TE>
<TE>   The commission will review its priority list by the end of this
year or early next year, said Kerry Forsythe, deputy director of the
commission.</TE>

<HD>Caltrans Still Lagging on Water Pollution Abatement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL and CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For more than a decade, the California Department of Transportation
has been a chronic violator of federal laws designed to prevent
enormous amounts of polluted water from running off highways into
rivers, streams and the ocean.</LD>
<LD>   Years of environmental lawsuits, government investigations and
internal reviews show that Caltrans, which operates 15,000 miles of
highway, consistently has failed to stop sediment and contaminants
from draining off roads, bridges, construction sites and maintenance
yards.</LD>
<LD>   "We've had a long history with Caltrans," said Jeremy Johnstone,
an enforcement official with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
in San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   "They are a much better actor than they used to be, but there are
still problems. They get spanked, and they get the message for a
while. Then they slack off. It's a tough agency to police."</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans officials contend that erosion and storm water runoff are
complicated environmental problems with no quick fix. Taking care of
the situation might be so expensive, agency officials say, that it
could devour money for future road projects across the state. There
have been problems in the past, they add, but the department is now
committed to complying with the law.</TE>
<TE>   "These are onerous regulations that require a change in the way we
do business," said J. Steven Borroum, chief of environmental
engineering for Caltrans. "It takes a great effort to move a big
ship. We now routinely do things we didn't do five years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the record shows that Caltrans continues to be derelict about
storm water regulations, and that very few California highways have
been designed or retrofitted with storm water controls. Moreover,
getting caught violating the law has not prevented the agency from
committing the same violations in other parts of the state.</TE>
<TE>   Illegal discharges threaten water resources across California,
including steelhead trout and salmon habitat on the northern coast,
the Truckee River below Lake Tahoe, Santa Monica Bay, dolphin
birthing grounds off Crystal Cove State Park in Orange County, and
San Diego and San Francisco bays.</TE>
<TE>   Runoff from roads, farmland, urban areas and industrial sites has
emerged as the No. 1 threat to water quality in California. Research
shows that it is often toxic and can harm fish, sea urchins, shrimp,
birds and microorganisms.</TE>
<TE>   Silt from erosion can cloud sources of drinking water, disrupt
spawning grounds and bury habitat for aquatic plants and
bottom-dwelling animals.</TE>
<TE>   Highway drainage poses its own problems. It can be a grimy mix of
trash, oil, antifreeze, rubber, hydraulic fluid, exhaust particles,
brake dust and microscopic bits of metal along with soil and organic
materials, including human and animal waste. The flow also can
contain solvents, detergents, fertilizers and pesticides.</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to determine how much contaminated water washes
off state highways. Although highways represent roughly 2% of the
land area that generates storm water, some studies suggest that the
discharges are greater and far more toxic than other sources of
runoff.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists estimate that each year, one quart of oil per person
ends up in runoff from the nation's highways. If they are correct,
about 7.5 million gallons of oil in California ends up in highway
storm water every year--more than half the amount spilled by the
tanker Exxon Valdez in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "In the long run, what we're looking at is a slow-moving oil spill
of huge proportions being dumped into our waterways," said Ricki Ott,
a marine toxicologist.</TE>
<TE>   One example of the difficulty and expense of blocking runoff is a
problem-plagued project along the San Joaquin Hills Toll Road in
southern Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   When the 16-mile highway was built in the 1990s, Caltrans
encouraged the toll road authority to install 39 "cutting-edge"
filters that use compost to cleanse storm water as it washed off the
pavement.</TE>
<TE>   After the road opened in 1996, Caltrans failed to maintain the
drains, and they became clogged with sediment and vegetation.
Internal inspections concluded that the drains were faulty. Caltrans
now says the devices are too costly to maintain--about $1 million a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board
issued an order demanding that Caltrans fix the problems, fearing
that polluted runoff might be flowing down coastal canyons to the
ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans now plans to begin a $13-million project to repair or
replace the filters. The price tag is roughly 15 times what it cost
to build the systems.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the Transportation Corridor Agencies, which built the
road and installed the drains, said the controls would work if
properly maintained and that Caltrans has misstated annual
maintenance costs by 300%.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe what they are proposing will be any more
effective," said James D. Brown, the corridor agencies' director of
engineering and environmental planning. "The $13 million could be
spent elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   A History of Suits and Enforcement Actions</TE>
<TE>   The San Joaquin Hills Toll Road is one of the latest in a long
history of lawsuits and government enforcement actions involving the
state's giant transportation department.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last decade, the agency has lost federal lawsuits in Los
Angeles, San Diego and the Bay Area that alleged widespread
violations of the Clean Water Act.</TE>
<TE>   In five separate actions, the EPA has collected more than $1
million in penalties and settlements.</TE>
<TE>   Critical evaluations have come from state water regulators, which
have issued numerous cease-and-desist orders, as well as the Federal
Highway Administration and annual in-house reviews by Caltrans.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been widespread failures at Caltrans to reduce the No.
1 source of water pollution in the state," said David Beckman, a Los
Angeles-based attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a
national environmental organization.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever Caltrans has done that's positive, it has been forced to
through litigation," Beckman added.</TE>
<TE>   The Natural Resources Defense Council and Santa Monica BayKeeper,
a local environmental group, brought the first major lawsuit against
Caltrans in 1993, alleging that the department had failed to stem
storm water runoff from 900 miles of roads and at least 35
maintenance yards in Los Angeles and Ventura counties.</TE>
<TE>   After more than a year of hearings, U.S. District Judge Edward
Rafeedie ruled against Caltrans, finding that the department had paid
only "lip service" to the law until there was significant pressure to
do more.</TE>
<TE>   Rafeedie rejected Caltrans' argument that it didn't have the money
to comply with the rules. He ordered the agency to make comprehensive
changes in its Los Angeles district office, including cleaning tens
of thousands of highway storm drains and examining options to
retrofit highways.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans has been so slow to comply that the agency has been
threatened with contempt actions. Its Los Angeles district office
remains under Rafeedie's supervision eight years after the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Similar problems continue to surface elsewhere around the state,
from the Truckee River, where state water regulators earlier this
year fined Caltrans $30,000 for improperly discharging sediment and
are now seeking an additional $208,000, to San Diego, where Caltrans
workers recently were charged with blasting hundreds of pounds of
paint chips into the bay during work on the Coronado Bay Bridge.</TE>
<TE>   Methods of controlling runoff vary from relatively simple,
low-tech devices to highly complex filters.</TE>
<TE>   Erosion at construction sites, for example, can be controlled with
sandbags, straw bales, tarps and absorbent materials to protect
barren slopes. Simple plastic fences block silt.</TE>
<TE>   Highway runoff can be filtered through large concrete vaults
filled with sand, compost or minerals. Settling basins, roadside
strips of vegetation, sand-filled trenches and drain inserts to catch
litter also are effective.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans has earmarked $60 million a year over the next five years
for runoff control work. But that is only a fraction of the billions
that might be needed to fix highways in Los Angeles County alone.</TE>
<TE>   Various Caltrans studies--some court-ordered, some not--are
underway to discover more precisely the damage that runoff causes and
the cheapest ways to control it.</TE>
<TE>   But Caltrans argues that the expense of installing storm water
devices generally outweighs the benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, polluted storm water must be reduced according to
guidelines that weigh environmental impact against cost.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Caltrans estimated that the cost of storm water controls
on 657 miles of highway in Los Angeles County would range from $2.9
billion to $4.9 billion, depending on the level of treatment.</TE>
<TE>   To control urban runoff from all sources in the state, Caltrans
studies indicate that the capital costs could range from $70 billion
to $114 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Such costs might exhaust state funds for road projects,
"precluding them for a generation or more," a California
Transportation Commission report stated earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say highway departments in other states have controlled
storm water runoff without seriously jeopardizing their construction
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland treats about 90% of its storm water runoff before it
reaches lakes, rivers or coastal waters. Oregon and Washington report
that they treat at least 30%.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland, which has 5,200 miles of highway and stringent state and
federal regulations to protect Chesapeake Bay, has been installing
runoff controls for more than 20 years. Highway officials there said
the costs of filtering runoff have not delayed or canceled projects.</TE>
<TE>   Critics Charge That Agency Inflates Costs</TE>
<TE>   Natural Resources Defense Council lawyers say Caltrans often
inflates costs to support the argument that controls are not worth
installing.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans' costs for retrofitting highways are dramatically higher
than those of other states--10 times or more for certain treatment
methods, according to a comparison by the group.</TE>
<TE>   "The technology is developing and getting cheaper all the time,"
council attorney Beckman said. "The way they get these huge figures
is to take the most platinum approach possible."</TE>
<TE>   But state-to-state cost comparisons can be difficult because of
weather, traffic and road characteristics. In California, high land
values in urban areas and earthquake standards present additional
hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Borroum conceded that Caltrans' original cost estimates for
treatment might be cut in half if regional approaches are taken.</TE>
<TE>   "We are working actively to cut those cuts and trying to move
quickly on cost-effective devices," Borroum said. "We are learning
how to be better stewards of the environment."</TE>
<TE>   To help settle the cost debate, various storm water controls are
under review in a court-ordered study at 38 projects throughout
Southern California. They range from big, cylindrical oil and water
separators to long strips of roadside vegetation that act as filters.</TE>
<TE>   But the research might not quell the courtroom battles. In their
nine-year-old Los Angeles case, Natural Resources Defense Council
attorneys are considering new challenges, alleging that Caltrans
continues to violate court orders.</TE>
<TE>   "They are always saying they can't do retrofit. They can't clean
out freeway drains. They can't do this, they can't do that," said
Everett DeLano, a council lawyer in San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   "We are always trying to push them along. We get a lot of
resistance."</TE>

<HD>Ventura County Focuses on Housing Its Farm Workers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a lack of low-cost housing forcing a growing number of Ventura
County farm workers to live out of cars and garages, a coalition of
growers, labor advocates and elected leaders has launched a campaign
to shelter those who supply the muscle for the county's $1-billion
farm industry.</LD>
<LD>   Skyrocketing housing prices and soaring rents are making it
tougher than ever for agricultural workers to find affordable places
to live, housing advocates say.</LD>
<LD>   But in what many are calling an unprecedented spirit of
cooperation, a push is on to counter that trend. At least three
committees are studying the issue, looking at everything from current
housing conditions to potential land-use strategies.</LD>
<TE>   And county planners are sifting through the results of a
comprehensive survey to determine farm-worker housing needs, a key
component of efforts to generate the money and support necessary to
build the first significant block of farm-worker housing in the
county in nearly a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absolutely disgraceful, and we've got to provide the
political will to solve this problem," said Supervisor John Flynn,
who is among those leading the charge. "There is a huge need, and the
timing seems to be excellent to do something about it."</TE>
<TE>   Those efforts could receive a boost this fall, when California
voters weigh in on a $2.1-billion housing bond that would funnel $200
million into the state's primary farm-worker housing grant program.</TE>
<TE>   If approved, the money would become available at a time of
increased attention to rural housing conditions.</TE>
<TE>   That interest has been spurred in part by a growing belief that in
order to keep farmers in business--which Ventura County voters have
said they want to do through the adoption of farmland preservation
measures--steps must be taken to house those who work the harvest.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, one policy group reported last year that farm-worker
housing was in such dwindling supply that it threatens the stability
of the county's oldest and most prominent industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Since this community has voted to preserve agriculture, I think
there is a community obligation to make sure we are taking care of
that segment of the community that makes farming possible," said Rob
Roy, general counsel for the Ventura County Agricultural Assn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Local Housing Costs Hit an All-Time High</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's red-hot housing market has been tough on workers
in all sectors.</TE>
<TE>   Schoolteachers, biotech workers and corporate professionals all
have felt the squeeze of a housing market in which apartment
vacancies now stand at 2% and the price of a typical home is at an
all-time high of $312,000.</TE>
<TE>   But the housing crunch has been especially hard on low-wage
workers. And wages don't get much lower than those earned by farm
workers, who by some estimates make on average less than $14,000 a
year picking strawberries and plucking lemons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost impossible to survive on what we earn," said Marciano
Guzman, 28, a seasonal strawberry picker who pays $450 a month to
rent two rooms for himself, his wife and two children in a trailer in
south Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Such sentiments are not unique to Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   In agricultural outposts across the state, from cardboard
shantytowns near San Diego to open-air encampments in the San Joaquin
Valley, farm workers tell of living in slum conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's farm-worker housing survey, conducted by a
committee formed after supervisors highlighted the issue last year,
documented laborers living in cars, converted garages and cramped
apartments shared by two and three families.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,500 farm workers filled out the questionnaire. The
committee--made up of farmers, labor advocates and county
planners--is expected later this month to review the results and by
this summer to recommend ways to help meet identified housing needs.</TE>
<TE>   Fueled by an infusion of cash into California's farm-worker
housing grant program in recent years, there is now more activity
than ever on the farm-worker housing front, state officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Established in 1977, the state farm-worker housing fund only was
receiving $1 million to $2 million a year up until 1999. But starting
in fiscal 1999-2000, serious money started flowing into the fund,
including a $40-million allocation for fiscal 2000-01.</TE>
<TE>   About $80 million has been earmarked for the program since 1999,
said Judy Nevis, chief deputy director of the state housing
department.</TE>
<TE>   That money is expected to help build nearly 4,000 rental units and
single-family homes for farm workers statewide in coming years, Nevis
said.</TE>
<TE>   The housing bond measure, if approved, could add an additional $30
million a year over the next six years. That money would help produce
between 6,800 and 8,500 farm-worker housing units.</TE>
<TE>   Even with increased funding, however, it isn't going to be
easy--especially in slow-growth Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Housing advocates and others say to turn the talk into reality, it
will require residents to think differently about such issues as
where housing should be built and how many units should be allowed.</TE>

<HD>Laguna Council Approves Festival of the Arts Face Lift</HD>
<DH>Culture: First phase of the $6.8-million plan is OKd,
bringing the city and the group's board closer to signing a lease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Laguna Beach City Council has unanimously approved the first
phase of a $6.8-million face lift for the Festival of the Arts
compound, bringing the city and the festival board closer than ever
to striking a long-term lease.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it was a milestone that indicated we're together on the
planning and renovation process," Mayor Wayne Baglin said Thursday.
"And we're going to do our best to have a lease in place by the time
the festival opens."</LD>
<LD>   The initial projects will cost about $1.8 million and include
upgrades to the administration building and the storm-drain system.
The first phase also calls for renovating the 60-year-old workshops
used for the Pageant of the Masters show, which runs in tandem with
the festival. Construction is to begin in September and take a year
to complete.</LD>
<TE>   The council also gave conceptual approval to several other
renovations expected to cost about $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   These include building a new facade at the entrance and a new
exhibit area, as well as expanding the seating and improving the
sound system. The plans also call for renovating the backstage area
and orchestra pit at the Irvine Bowl amphitheater.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach has hosted the eight-week exhibition of more than 150
regional artists since 1932.</TE>
<TE>   The city has tried to negotiate a new lease for nearly two years,
ever since the festival's former board of directors threatened to
move the event to San Clemente. The council approved the work Tuesday
night in a move that the new festival board considered critical to
striking a long-term lease.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of the current discussions could hinge on how far the
city is willing to go to meet the board's entire wish list.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a first step," said Scott Moore, president of the
festival's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   "By approving the entire concept plan and getting it started,
negotiators have jumped over their first hurdle.... Now they can get
to discussing the possible dollars of our lease."</TE>
<TE>   Other redesign plans drawn up by the festival directors include a
new gallery to house the ever-expanding art collection that now has
no home. Also, the Irvine Bowl amphitheater would be fitted with a
retractable roof, and a larger community theater would be built for
use by other local groups and troupes.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from making capital improvements and meeting standards
outlined by the Americans With Disabilities Act, the goal of the
redesign is to create facilities that can be better accessed and used
by the entire community throughout the year, rather than for just the
two months the festival runs.</TE>

<LD>High winds, low humidity and dry brush hampered efforts Sunday to
contain a 2-day-old wildfire that has charred some 4,500 acres in the
Angeles National Forest, north of Santa Clarita.</LD>
<LD>   From the ground and air, more than 1,000 federal, state and local
firefighters battled the fast-moving blaze, which started Saturday
morning in Bouquet Canyon. One firefighter hurt his arm while moving
supplies.</LD>
<LD>   By Sunday evening, fire officials reported that the blaze was 25%
contained.</LD>
<TE>   The remote, steep area eight miles northeast of Santa Clarita is
dotted with dozens of cabins, which fire crews managed to spare. The
fire destroyed an outhouse and a shed, but it did not threaten homes
in Santa Clarita.</TE>
<TE>   The second day brought warmer temperatures--in the 80s--and winds
gusting up to 30 mph. The air held little moisture to aid
firefighters. Rainfall in the area is 11 inches below normal, making
the chaparral prime fuel for fire, Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Greg
Cleveland said.</TE>
<TE>   "We usually don't have these dry conditions until August," he
said. Several agencies, including the U.S. Forest Service, declared
fire season underway in mid-April, one month earlier than usual</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters were letting the Bouquet Canyon fire burn southward
Sunday afternoon, hoping it would be slowed in an area scarred by a
brush fire last October.</TE>
<TE>   "You take away the fuel, you take away the source," Forest Service
spokeswoman Jo Hall said.</TE>
<TE>   Forest Service firefighter Rachel Kellogg, who pulled a 15-hour
shift Saturday and Sunday, was surprised by how dry the area was.
"This early, everything should still be green and damp," she said.</TE>
<TE>   About 150 people were evacuated from the 110 recreational cabins
in the canyon area, but only four stopped by a shelter set up for
them at Saugus High School, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's official
said.</TE>
<TE>   A man who splits his time between Modesto and his two-bedroom
cabin in the burning area wondered what had happened to his fishing
lodge of 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a lot of memories in there," said the man, who did not
give his name.</TE>

<HD>Web Site Casts Ear on the Sky for Noisy Flights</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Residents near LAX can use the city-created
system to identify offending planes right down to their tail numbers
and altitude.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Westchester resident Danny Schneider is used to a certain amount of
airport noise interrupting the early morning quiet. But when he
stepped outside to pick up his newspaper one day recently, a
low-flying turboprop plane overhead seemed even closer, and louder,
than normal.</LD>
<LD>   So Schneider did just what city officials and federal regulators
hoped he would do: He went inside and used his computer to find out
exactly how low the plane was flying, its tail number and which
airline was operating it.</LD>
<LD>   If it had been an egregious violation, which Schneider did not
consider it to be, he could have reported the offending flight.</LD>
<TE>   Schneider logged on to a new Web site--LAX Internet Flight
Tracks--that was created by the city agency that operates Los Angeles
International Airport so the 90,000 or so people living under the
flight path can better monitor aircraft noise.</TE>
<TE>   Officials hope that residents will use the site to gather
information about wayward flights and report it directly to the
airlines or the Federal Aviation Administration, which determines
flight paths into and out of LAX.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Web Site Averages 660 Visitors a Day</TE>
<TE>   "If someone gets woken up at 3 a.m. because of an eastern
departure, they can go online, click and see who it was, and call the
airline and ask what they're doing," said Roger Johnson, deputy
executive director of technology and environmental affairs for the
city's airport agency. "We hope this will allow us to be responsive
without being as labor intensive."</TE>
<TE>   The airport's noise monitoring program lost employees and
resources in the budget crunch after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
forcing officials to look for other ways to serve residents.</TE>
<TE>   The flight tracking system--a year and $35,000 in the making--has
logged about 660 users a day on average since it debuted this month.</TE>
<TE>   It determines a plane's location by listening in on communications
between an airplane's transponder--a device that sends a signal
communicating unique information about the craft--and the FAA radar
system at LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Many airlines and airports already use this software to keep track
of aircraft in the air and on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "This system allows a gate agent to tell people exactly when the
aircraft will come in, when it will be able to leave, and if it has
been delayed," said Ron Dunsky, director of marketing for Megadata
Corp., the Greenwich, Conn., company that designed the Flight Tracks
site for the city.</TE>
<TE>   "The public doesn't have access to information at any other
airports that people are going to get from LAX," Dunsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors to the site can view arriving and departing flights,
shown in blue and green, respectively, and aircraft moving through
the region, shown in black. All of it appears on a 10-minute delay
for security reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Planes are superimposed on a map of the Los Angeles area. Users
can zoom in on neighborhoods, and view flight activity anywhere from
six to 96 miles from the facility. Clicking on an airplane icon
provides additional data including aircraft type, altitude and track
identification number.</TE>
<TE>   To get more information about a flight, surfers can wait an hour
and use the site's replay function, which provides the airline, the
tail number, the airport where the flight originated and its
destination. The replay feature archives data for three months.</TE>
<TE>   The system has several quirks, including the propensity for an
icon to temporarily disappear from the screen when a flight passes
directly over the radar antenna on the airport's western edge,
causing the device to lose the transponder signal.</TE>
<TE>   The site works best with a high-speed Internet connection and an
updated browser. It's slow to load on dial-up Internet connections.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the LAX Community Noise Roundtable, a year-old
organization composed of representatives from 17 communities and
agencies such as the FAA, said the site gives residents the ability
to assess for themselves whether an aircraft has strayed from its
flight path.</TE>
<TE>   "A big 747-400 went right over the homes of people in Playa del
Rey, and we were able to look up and find out who the offending
aircraft was," said Westchester's Schneider, also a member of the
Noise Roundtable.</TE>
<TE>   "And then we could ask why did that plane do a go-around of their
homes at 1,900 feet?" (A go-around is when an aircraft aborts a
landing and flies back around the airport to approach the runway
again.)</TE>
<TE>   The ability to provide an airline and flight number when reporting
problems has saved residents and airport officials time and
headaches, Schneider said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that in the past when residents called the airport about
a flight, officials often were unable to find it on their manifest.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bay Area Uses Similar System</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco aviation officials say a similar flight tracking
system has allowed them to better communicate with communities about
noise issues around San Francisco International Airport and San Jose
and Oakland airports.</TE>
<TE>   The year-old Bay Area site--live.airportnetwork.com/sfo/--is
similar to the LAX site. It provides residents with the altitude and
air speed for arriving and departing aircraft, but doesn't give the
airline or tail number.</TE>
<TE>   Residents can call the airport for this information, said Ron
Wilson, a San Francisco airport spokesman, adding that the site
averages about 300 hits a day. It doesn't have a replay feature.</TE>
<TE>   "It has debunked the myth that the plane is really 500 feet over
someone's house," Wilson said. "It makes it easier for us to live
with each other."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Boy in Smuggling Case Is Given Visa</HD>
<DH>INS: Special status helps L.A. couple hoping to keep him.
Thai relatives seek his return.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU and GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- With the personal blessing of Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft,
the Justice Department has decided to grant semi-permanent
immigration status to a 4-year-old Thai boy who has become an
international poster child for the ills of trafficking in humans,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The decision helps a Los Angeles couple who are acting as
Phanupong Khaisri's guardians in their fight to keep him in the
United States. The boy's grandparents seek his return to Thailand.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for the INS are expected to convey their decision today to
attorneys involved in the two-year battle over the future of the boy,
who is known as Got, according to a senior Justice Department
official who asked not to be identified.</LD>
<TE>   "We will grant him a 'T' visa. He is a victim of a severe form of
trafficking," the official said. "It will be finalized in a matter of
weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Congress created the T visas in 2000 as a special immigration
status allowing victims of human trafficking to stay in the United
States if they can persuade immigration officials that they would
face "extreme hardship" if returned to their native countries. Got
will be one of the first people granted that special status, the
official said.</TE>
<TE>   Got arrived at Los Angeles International Airport in 2000,
accompanied by two adults who authorities say were using him as a
decoy to smuggle a female prostitute into the country. The adults
were expelled to Thailand, but the discussion about what to do with
the boy set off an international debate that some have likened to the
case of Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's father, mentally ill since childhood, killed himself not
long after Got was born, and his mother, who has worked at a bar in
Bangkok, was a drug addict. The boy's case became even more tragic
when it was learned that he was HIV-positive.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's grandparents in Thailand have been trying to have him
returned there to their custody. But in the meantime, he has been
living with a Silver Lake couple who have been made his
court-appointed guardians and have been trying to adopt him.</TE>
<TE>   The couple, Evan Smyth and Janet Herold, and their attorney said
Sunday that they were unaware of any pending decision, though hopeful
that it would occur.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a total surprise to us," said Smyth, who has had joint
custody of the child since he was released to the couple about 14
months ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a better status than he has now," said Herold, who
added that the next step will be to apply for permanent residency.</TE>
<TE>   The T visa can be revoked by the INS should the agency decide that
he no longer faces danger if deported to Thailand, where human-rights
attorneys have argued that he would be subject to punishment by
traffickers and neglect by the health-care system, said Peter Schey,
president of the Los Angeles-based Center for Human Rights and
Constitutional Law, and lead counsel in the case.</TE>
<TE>   "It would probably be hard to find a more qualified applicant,"
Schey said of Got. "He would have faced a wide range of threats to
his life, discrimination and persecution had he been returned to
Thailand," even in the custody of his grandparents, Schey said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the boy's grandparents nor their attorney in the United
States could be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The INS initially denied the boy political asylum and tried to
deport him to Thailand. But the court blocked his deportation, and
Ashcroft, who has made combating human trafficking a top priority in
the Justice Department, intervened last July to override that INS
decision, granting the Thai boy temporary residence status on
humanitarian grounds.</TE>
<TE>   He also ordered the INS to consider whether to give the boy the
newly created T visa.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. immigration officials are scheduled to meet today in Los
Angeles for a settlement conference with lawyers involved in the
case, and the federal officials are expected to relay their decision
to grant the visa.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to make Got one of the first T visa recipients gives
him an added measure of protection under U.S. immigration law, and it
clears the way for the possibility of permanent residency in three
years, federal officials said.</TE>

<LD>Sheriff's deputies said Sunday they had no idea who vandalized 25
headstones over the weekend in a historic Orange County cemetery.</LD>
<LD>   The incident is similar to vandalism at two Santa Ana cemeteries
last month.</LD>
<LD>   The incident Saturday occurred at Yorba Cemetery on Parkwood Court
in Yorba Linda.</LD>
<TE>   Headstones were toppled and some were broken, said Lt. Colin
Murphy, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1858, the cemetery contains the graves of many Orange
County pioneers, including members of the Yorba family, who founded
Yorba Linda. It stopped accepting bodies in 1939.</TE>
<TE>   The vandalized headstones were discovered about 7 a.m. Saturday,
when police received a call about the damage.In the Santa Ana cases,
33 gravestones, some broken in several places, were knocked down
April 9 at Santa Ana Cemetery and St. John's Lutheran Cemetery next
door.</TE>
<TE>   They are two of the oldest graveyards located in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   No arrests have been made in that case.</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>David Nunley is no easy rider; he's a retired surgeon from Chico with
a wife and three kids.</LD>
<LD>   But when he hits the highway on his Harley-Davidson motorcycle,
Nunley wants to feel the wind in his hair and hear the engine
rumble--without the constraints of a helmet, as state law requires.
And he hasn't seen a single statistic to convince him that headgear
makes riding any safer--certainly not one to justify the loss of
personal freedom that he feels he has experienced.</LD>
<LD>   "Anytime you have the state imposing a restriction on the
citizens, there had better be a good reason for it," says Nunley, 52.
"This is completely bogus."</LD>
<TE>   Eleven years after California banned motorcyclists from the
streets unless their skulls were safely secured, bikers such as
Nunley are once again fighting in the state capital to reclaim what
they see as their natural-born right to ride free.</TE>
<TE>   Six similar efforts to relax or repeal the helmet law have failed
amid strong opposition from trauma centers, police, insurance
companies and others who say the mass head injuries suffered by
helmetless riders are too deadly--and costly--to ignore.</TE>
<TE>   But the latest measure by Assemblyman Dennis Mountjoy
(R-Monrovia), which would let bikers ride without a helmet if they
are 21 or older and have a $1-million insurance policy, has made it
all the way to the Assembly floor, surprising many safety advocates.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a matter of personal and individual rights," Mountjoy
said in an interview, calling the helmet law a classic example of
"government nannyism."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the measure's prospects in the Assembly, where it
could be heard as early as today, remain uncertain. And it is
expected to encounter a major roadblock in the upper house in the
form of Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton (D-San Francisco),
who has rallied lawmakers to kill similar legislation in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Burton ridicules as "silly" the argument that government is
infringing on riders' freedom by forcing them to protect their heads.
He says similar arguments have been made and refuted many times over,
and are similar to the old opposition against mandatory vehicle seat
belts, air bags and other safety measures now widely endorsed by the
public.</TE>
<TE>   To those who just can't resist the temptation to ride uninhibited,
Burton jokingly offers the following advice: "Let 'em keep getting
traffic tickets. It's probably cheaper than $1 million in insurance
anyway."</TE>
<TE>   The battle to pass a law requiring motorcyclists and their
passengers to wear helmets was an epic affair that lasted decades.
Initial efforts during the 1960s were snuffed out largely by the
Hells Angels, who crowded the Capitol's hearing rooms with tattooed
bikers in full leather regalia. The leader of the motorcycle club,
Ralph "Sonny" Barger, cornered legislators in hallways to apply
coarse but highly effective lobbying techniques. Year after year,
measures would surface and, year after year, they were beaten back by
the bikers.</TE>
<TE>   But the safety advocates and insurers finally won out in 1991,
when Assemblyman Richard Floyd (D-Wilmington) put together enough
votes to get the measure out of the Legislature and persuaded Gov.
Pete Wilson to sign it. Motorcycle groups have been battling to
overturn it ever since.</TE>
<TE>   In one significant sense, the tide has turned their way. Part of
the impetus for imposing a headgear requirement in California was a
1966 federal law that required states to pass mandatory helmet laws
or lose transportation funding. That law was repealed in 1995, and
states can now choose to repeal helmet laws without financial
penalty. Currently, 20 states require helmets for all riders; 27
states have laws covering some riders, typically minors; and three
states have no laws at all, according to a legislative analysis.</TE>
<TE>   The days of outlaw bikers representing the cause are long over,
however. The campaign to relax the law is now led by a national
organization called American Brotherhood Aimed Toward Education which
canvasses for candidates sympathetic to its cause and maintains a
political action committee to dole out contributions. The campaign is
also supported by the California Motorcycle Dealers Assn., which sees
a link between the helmet law and sagging sales.</TE>
<TE>   The bikers of today, the groups say, are painters, insurance
salesmen, mechanics, lawyers--weekend warriors, for the most part,
who see motorcycling as a hobby, not a way of life. And many consider
helmets to be an unwanted government intrusion into their pastime.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of riders did not grow up wearing them, and they say it
impedes their vision," said motorcycle lobbyist Jim Lombardo,
relating the argument that for some, helmets actually increase the
dangers of riding.</TE>
<TE>   Others, he concedes, have more superficial concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "When they are cruising Newport Beach or Santa Cruz, they want the
girls to see their face," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mountjoy's measure, AB 2700, nearly died in the Assembly
Transportation Committee last month, but wound up passing by sheer
happenstance. Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Sylmar), a supporter of
relaxing the law, happened to be filling in for an absent lawmaker
one day on the committee. Mountjoy asked for reconsideration of his
measure, which had been defeated a week earlier, and Cardenas cast
the deciding vote.</TE>
<TE>   Safety groups were not amused. Allan Lind, Sacramento lobbyist for
Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, has been disseminating a
number of studies that have found a relationship between wearing a
helmet and surviving a motorcycle wreck, and other studies showing
that medical costs related to motorcycle injuries went down after the
law took effect.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of a helmet law passionately dispute those studies, and
say a highly touted motorcycle safety program, not the helmet law, is
the reason for improved safety.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's be blunt about it: It is selfish vanity versus common
sense," Lind said, offering his take on the motorcyclists' campaign.
"They like the wind flowing through their hair, the rebels on the
freeway. It's a romantic notion, perhaps, but it is also a foolish
one. What they are really saying here is that helmets are a fashion
violation. I don't see why the Legislature should override safety
considerations for fashion."</TE>

<HD>Hugh F. Hicks, 79; Amassed Huge Collection of Lightbulbs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Baltimore Sun</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Hugh Francis Hicks, the dentist whose Baltimore office was home
to what is thought to be the world's foremost collection of electric
lightbulbs, died Tuesday at St. Joseph Medical Center in Baltimore of
a heart attack. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   His enthusiasm for glowing glass never dimmed, and through the
years he amassed a collection that included a bulb from the original
torch of the Statue of Liberty and headlamps from the Mercedes-Benz
limousines of Nazi leaders Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler.</LD>
<LD>   Hicks regularly told visitors to his free, private museum that his
was the only collection in the world containing an uninterrupted
history of the lightbulb, including 15 or 20 bulbs that Thomas Edison
probably held in his hands 122 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   "In terms of numbers, his may very well be the largest collection
in the world, certainly the largest collection any of us knew," said
Harold D. Wallace, a specialist with the Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of American History.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the kind of guy who never met a lightbulb he didn't like."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Baltimore, Hicks was the son of a periodontist.</TE>
<TE>   He earned his bachelor's degree from Columbia University in 1945.
After graduating from the University of Maryland School of Dentistry,
he joined his father's practice in 1951. Also a periodontist, he
established his practice in 1957 and never fully retired.</TE>
<TE>   His daughter, Frances Hicks Apollony, said her father became
interested in lightbulbs at an early age.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandmother always told the story that he didn't want to play
with toys when he was a baby, so she put a lightbulb in his crib and
he began playing with it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   That was the beginning of a lifelong obsession that grew into a
world-renowned collection of 75,000 bulbs.</TE>
<TE>   About 10,000 were labeled and on display in the basement museum of
his office. A subcategory of the collection includes lighting
fixtures, from sconces to street lights and chandeliers.</TE>
<TE>   The museum opened in 1964, and drew more than 6,000 visitors
annually. They benefited from hands-on tours led by Hicks. Scholars,
other collectors and fans from all over the world were among the
visitors.</TE>
<TE>   The largest bulb in his collection dates to 1926, is 4 feet high
and requires 50,000 watts of electricity to glow. The most diminutive
is a pin light that was produced in the 1960s and used in missile
wiring. It is visible only under a microscope.</TE>
<TE>   Other historical pieces include a 3-foot-long tubular bulb used
during the 1930s to illuminate the ill-fated French liner Normandie;
a dashboard light from the Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the
atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan; and a 15-watt fluorescent bulb that
illuminated the table on which the Japanese signed the surrender in
World War II aboard the battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay in 1945.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the only museum in the world that covers the whole
history of the lightbulb," Hicks told the Baltimore Sun in a recent
interview.</TE>
<TE>   "And when we can teach the public, especially our schoolchildren,
about the most important industrial development--the lightbulb--then
we are fulfilling our mission."</TE>
<TE>   Hicks was married in 1950 to Mary Louise Amos, who died in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Apollony, Hicks is survived by another daughter,
Louise Hicks Smith of Winchester, Va.; a sister, Lois Hicks Burkley
of Baltimore; and four grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Joseph L. Alexander, 72; Pioneer Surgeon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Joseph L. Alexander, a military and civilian surgeon who achieved
many firsts for African Americans, including becoming the first black
member of the all-white California Club in Los Angeles, has died. He
was 72.</LD>
<LD>   Alexander died May 6 in Los Angeles after a brief illness. No
cause of death was given.</LD>
<LD>   The doctor became a member of the city's oldest private club in
February 1988, less than a year after Los Angeles enacted an
ordinance banning discrimination by private-membership organizations.
Both he and the club leadership said his application had been in
process before the ordinance was passed.</LD>
<TE>   From its founding in 1887 until well into the 1970s, the
California Club had a reputation for hostility toward blacks and
Jews. When he became Los Angeles' first black mayor in 1973, Tom
Bradley adopted a policy of never going to the club. A white member
with a black guest in the 1970s found that nobody would serve them in
the main dining room.</TE>
<TE>   Jews gradually won admission, but it was the 1980s before blacks
were discussed as potential members. The club proffered membership in
its 1,275-man group to influential attorney Sam Williams, former
chairman of the city Police Commission and a friend of Bradley's, but
Williams declined.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander said he applied for membership in 1986 at the urging of
white friends who were California Club members, including attorney
James H. Kindel Jr., his neighbor at the downtown Bunker Hill Tower
condominium complex. But he said the application stalled for many
months, finally picking up speed when talk grew about an impending
anti-discrimination ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to join just to be joining," Alexander told The
Times on Feb. 1, 1988, when he was due to sign the club roster. "And
it certainly wasn't to integrate the club. It was to enjoy life and
extend the friendships I've already made with club members."</TE>
<TE>   Even Alexander's supporters worried that he might face hostility
in the club's imposing South Flower Street facilities from old-line
members who favored the all-white male policy.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't mind if someone doesn't want to associate with me," he
told The Times. "I've always picked and chosen my friends myself.
Being black in America, I've been exposed to things and I'm confident
the transition into the club will not be difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Tall, elegant and dignified, Alexander delayed his formal
signing-in until he could do it quietly without the glare of media
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Oneonta, Ala., and reared in Kentucky by a single mother,
Joseph Lee Alexander was long accustomed to breaking barriers for
blacks. Dedicated to education from an early age, he won a full
scholarship to Fisk University, graduated magna cum laude and went on
to become in 1951 the first black student admitted to the University
of Louisville Medical School.</TE>
<TE>   Joining the Army, he practiced first at Walter Reed Medical Center
outside Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   After winning a fellowship to study organ transplants at Harvard,
he returned to Walter Reed to head its organ transplantation service.</TE>
<TE>   He personally performed the Army's first kidney transplant.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander moved to Los Angeles when he retired from the Army to
join Martin Luther King/Charles R. Drew Postgraduate Medical School.</TE>
<TE>   He was the founding director of King/Drew's Trauma Center and
taught surgery at UCLA School of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   There are no immediate survivors. Services are being planned by
the Angeles Funeral Home in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Airport Battle Shifting to John Wayne</HD>
<DH>Aviation: While regional passenger crunch pressures Orange
County, leaders there want to extend curbs on the airfield's
capacity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With plans for an El Toro airport dead, Orange County's John Wayne
Airport looks like the next battleground in Southern California's
airport wars.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1985, John Wayne has operated under court-approved
limitations on traffic and a nighttime flight curfew that dates to
1968. But the agreement covering those restrictions expires at the
end of 2005.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Board of Supervisors and officials of Newport
Beach, whose city is the most affected by noise from John Wayne
flights, plan to approve extended--thought slightly
softened--restrictions next month. Their efforts are already
encountering strong resistance, however.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Air Transport Assn., which represents the
nation's major airlines, says the trade group will fight attempts to
keep restrictions in place.</TE>
<TE>   The group contends that beginning Jan. 1, 2006, the county must
stop limiting the number of passengers and departures, as well as the
noise restrictions made by departing jets.</TE>
<TE>   "Our position is that once the agreement expires, it expires, and
everything referred to in it expires," said ATA spokesman Roger Cohen
in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The argument over what happens at John Wayne in Santa Ana reaches
beyond Orange County. Officials in Los Angeles County had joined the
call for a new airport at El Toro, arguing that Orange County wasn't
doing its "fair share" of serving air passengers in California's
second-most populous county.</TE>
<TE>   About 7 million passengers used John Wayne in 2000--a fraction of
the 67 million who traveled through Los Angeles International Airport
that year. Five million more Orange County passengers began or ended
their trips at LAX or Ontario International Airport, according to the
Southern California Assn. of Governments.</TE>
<TE>   "If Orange County is going to opt out of El Toro, the immediate
answer is John Wayne Airport," said El Segundo Mayor Mike Gordon, who
is active with a coalition of elected officials in Southern
California pushing for a regional approach to airport expansion.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to let [Orange County's] demand wind itself back
to LAX. We'll be doing everything we can with the FAA to make sure
John Wayne Airport can expand."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's future airport demand is pegged by SCAG at about
30 million passengers annually by 2025. John Wayne could handle about
14 million passengers a year if more gates were built and the limit
on passengers removed, according to an earlier county study.</TE>
<TE>   A majority of Orange County supervisors don't want John Wayne to
grow that much; the airport is one-fourth the size of the scuttled El
Toro airport.</TE>
<TE>   In February, supervisors voted to seek an increase in the number
of passengers at John Wayne from the current cap of 8.4 million a
year to 9.8 million through 2015. The number of flights using the
loudest commercial jets would rise from 73 to 85 a day. The county
also would build four passenger gates, for a total of 18. It's this
plan that supervisors and the Newport Beach City Council are expected
to complete at a June 25 meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The airlines argue that renewed restrictions would violate a 1990
federal law that ended the ability of local governments to control
airports. In exchange, airlines agreed to replace their fleets with
quieter jets. At the time, restrictions at John Wayne were allowed to
continue because they were already in place.</TE>
<TE>   Since the passage of that law, the 1990 Airport Noise and Capacity
Act, the Federal Aviation Administration has not approved flight
curfews or other significant restrictions on airport operations
anywhere in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach officials say the restrictions at John Wayne can be
amended and extended without approval by the FAA.</TE>
<TE>   "We've taken the position that we have a grandfathered agreement
that doesn't need FAA approval," said Newport Beach City Atty. Robert
Burnham. "There will be discussions. We don't want to go to war with
anybody."</TE>
<TE>   City officials intend to sit down with FAA officials once the city
and county agree on a new plan, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Snyder, the FAA's Western region spokesman in Los Angeles,
said last week that the agency has not yet been asked to comment on
the plan and that no meetings to discuss it have been scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't performed any legal analysis to determine the legal
standing of any extension proposal," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Two citizen groups that signed the 1985 settlement agreement that
imposed the current restrictions have agreed to accept some growth in
airport capacity as long as it can still be restricted, said Newport
Beach City Manager Homer Bludau.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Lichman, attorney for the Airport Working Group, which has
opposed John Wayne Airport expansion for more than 20 years, said her
organization will fight to allow enforcement of a settlement
agreement extended beyond 2005. The biggest threat is to the
nighttime flight curfew, she said, which reduces beneath the flight
paths.</TE>
<TE>   The county began enforcing the curfew in 1968. Departures are
limited to 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays, and 8 a.m. to
10 p.m. Sundays. Arrivals are allowed until 11 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope to God that the agreement prevails," Lichman said.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are high for Newport Beach: Should the agreement
expire, it would not only end the noise and capacity limits but
return authority to the county for other future decisions about the
airport.</TE>
<TE>   The city has enlisted the help of Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport
Beach), who last year tried unsuccessfully to attach an amendment to
an aviation security bill that would have eased the way for an
extension of the John Wayne agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Cox has crafted language similar to that in his failed amendment,
and supported by the Orange County congressional delegation, that he
said he hopes to add to a future aviation bill.</TE>
<TE>   A review of attempts by other communities to impose airport
restrictions, as well as past correspondence between the FAA and the
county, indicates an uphill climb.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1994 letter to John Wayne Airport's then-manager, Jan
Mittermeier, an FAA official acknowledged the 1985 restrictions but
said future decisions about flights must be "addressed in a manner
consistent" with the 1990 federal law barring local restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   A fight to impose similar restrictions at Burbank airport has
dragged on for years. The Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority
is conducting a three-year, $4-million study required by the FAA as
part of its attempt to impose a 10 p.m.-to-7 a.m. curfew for
commercial flights.</TE>

<HD>Air War's Next Likely Target: John Wayne</HD>
<DH>Aviation: County leaders who want to renew curbs on the
airport's capacity can expect a fight from regional interests
demanding the opposite.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With plans for an El Toro airport dead, Orange County's John Wayne
Airport looks like the next battleground in Southern California's
airport wars.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1985, John Wayne has operated under court-approved
limitations on traffic and a nighttime flight curfew that dates back
to 1968. But the agreement covering those restrictions expires at the
end of 2005.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Board of Supervisors and officials of Newport
Beach, whose city is the most affected by noise from John Wayne
flights, plan to approve extended--though slightly
softened--restrictions next month. Their efforts are already
encountering strong resistance, however.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Air Transport Assn., which represents the
nation's major airlines, says the trade group will fight attempts to
keep restrictions in place. The group contends that beginning Jan. 1,
2006, the county must stop limiting the number of passengers and
departures, as well as the noise restrictions made by departing jets.</TE>
<TE>   "Our position is that once the agreement expires, it expires, and
everything referred to in it expires," said ATA spokesman Roger Cohen
in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The argument over what happens at John Wayne, in Santa Ana,
reaches beyond Orange County. Officials in Los Angeles County had
joined the call for a new airport at El Toro, arguing that Orange
County wasn't doing its "fair share" of serving air passengers in
California's second-most populous county.</TE>
<TE>   About 7 million passengers used John Wayne Airport in 2000--a
fraction of the 67 million who traveled through Los Angeles
International Airport that year. Five million more Orange County
passengers began or ended their trips at LAX or Ontario International
Airport, according to SCAG, the Southern California Assn. of
Governments.</TE>
<TE>   "If Orange County is going to opt out of El Toro, the immediate
answer is John Wayne Airport," said El Segundo Mayor Mike Gordon, who
is active with a coalition of elected officials in Southern
California pushing for a regional approach to airport expansion.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to let [Orange County's] demand wind itself back
to LAX. We'll be doing everything we can with the FAA to make sure
John Wayne Airport can expand."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's future airport demand is pegged by SCAG at about
30 million passengers annually by 2025. John Wayne Airport could
handle about 14 million passengers a year if more gates were built
and the limit on passengers removed, according to an earlier county
study.</TE>
<TE>   A majority of Orange County supervisors don't want John Wayne to
grow that much; the airport is one-fourth the size of the scuttled El
Toro airport. In February, the supervisors voted to seek an increase
in the number of passengers at John Wayne from the current cap of 8.4
million a year to 9.8 million through 2015. The number of flights
using the loudest commercial jets would rise from 73 to 85 a day. The
county also would build four passenger gates, for a total of 18. It's
this plan that supervisors and the Newport Beach City Council are
expected to complete at a June 25 meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The airlines argue that renewed restrictions would violate a 1990
federal law that ended the ability of local governments to control
airports. In exchange, airlines agreed to use quieter jets. At the
time, restrictions at John Wayne were allowed to continue because
they were already in place.</TE>
<TE>   Since the passage of that law, the 1990 Airport Noise and Capacity
Act, the Federal Aviation Administration has not approved flight
curfews or other significant restrictions on airport operations
anywhere in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach officials say the restrictions at John Wayne can be
amended and extended without approval by the FAA.</TE>
<TE>   "We've taken the position that we have a grandfathered agreement
that doesn't need FAA approval," said Newport Beach City Atty. Robert
Burnham. "There will be discussions. We don't want to go to war with
anybody," he said. City officials intend to sit down with FAA
officials to get their reaction once the city and county agree on a
new plan, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Snyder, the FAA's Western region spokesman in Los Angeles,
said last week that the agency has not yet been asked to comment on
the plan and that no meetings to discuss it have been scheduled. "We
haven't performed any legal analysis to determine the legal standing
of any extension proposal," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Two citizen groups that signed the 1985 settlement agreement that
imposed the current restrictions have agreed to accept some growth in
airport capacity as long as it can still be restricted, said Newport
Beach City Manager Homer Bludau.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Lichman, attorney for the Airport Working Group, which has
opposed John Wayne Airport expansion for more than 20 years, said her
organization will fight to allow enforcement of a settlement
agreement extended beyond 2005. The biggest threat is to the
nighttime flight curfew, she said, which reduces beneath the flight
paths.</TE>
<TE>   The county began enforcing the curfew in 1968. Departures are
limited to 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 8 a.m. to
10 p.m. Sundays. Arrivals are allowed until 11 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope to God that the agreement prevails," Lichman said.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are high for Newport Beach: Should the agreement
expire, it would not only end the noise and capacity limits but
return authority to the county for other future decisions about the
airport.</TE>
<TE>   The city has enlisted the help of Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport
Beach), who last year tried unsuccessfully to attach an amendment to
an aviation security bill that would have eased the way for an
extension of the John Wayne agreement. Cox has crafted language
similar to that in his failed amendment, and supported by the Orange
County congressional delegation, that he said he hopes to add to a
future aviation bill.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts by other communities to impose airport restrictions, as
well as past correspondence between the FAA and the county, indicates
an uphill climb.</TE>
<TE>   In a Dec. 5, 1994, letter to John Wayne Airport's then-manager,
Jan Mittermeier, an FAA official acknowledged the 1985 restrictions
but said future decisions about flights must be "addressed in a
manner consistent" with the 1990 federal law barring local
restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   A fight to impose similar restrictions at Burbank airport has
dragged on for years. The Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority
is conducting a three-year, $4-million study required by the FAA as
part of its attempt to impose a 10 p.m.-to-7 a.m. curfew for
commercial flights. The study includes an analysis showing the impact
the new rule would have on interstate commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank voters last year approved an airport capacity-limiting
measure that is now challenged in court.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, of the Air Transport Assn., said Orange County must
complete the same FAA-required study of the impact of extending John
Wayne's restrictions before the supervisors' final vote.</TE>

<DH>Health: Medical board approves a plan for posting
malpractice settlements on Internet. Legislature's OK needed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Medical Board of California has voted to support public
disclosure of all medical malpractice settlements involving
physicians, which would significantly expand public access to
information about doctors.</LD>
<LD>   At a meeting Saturday in Newport Beach, the board voted
unanimously to distribute the information on its Web site, if the
Legislature approves. Two board members abstained from voting.</LD>
<LD>   The medical board, which licenses, investigates and disciplines
doctors, currently does not disclose any information about
malpractice settlements.</LD>
<TE>   Its Web site provides information on California disciplinary
actions against doctors; malpractice verdicts or arbitration awards;
felony criminal convictions; major hospital disciplinary actions; and
sanctions by other states' medical boards.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Gary Gitnick, the board's new president, said his colleagues
have "very progressive ideas."</TE>
<TE>   "It clearly is a board that realizes that its prime reason for
existence is public protection," said Gitnick, a UCLA
gastroenterologist. "And one element of public protection is making
it possible for any member of the public to learn as much as they can
about their physicians, both good and bad."</TE>
<TE>   If the board's recommendations are adopted by lawmakers, members
said they would like to release malpractice settlements dating back
five years.</TE>
<TE>   By proposing to make public malpractice settlements of any size,
the board went further than suggestions made by lawmakers earlier
this month. On May 1, the Joint Legislative Sunset Review Committee
supported disclosing malpractice settlements above $150,000, as well
as the names of doctors who had three or more settlements above
$30,000 in a 10-year period.</TE>
<TE>   The legislative panel and the medical board agree on several other
areas of public disclosure. They include misdemeanor convictions
related to physicians' qualifications and functions, along with board
referrals to the state attorney general's office for disciplinary
action.</TE>
<TE>   The California Medical Assn. and malpractice insurance carriers
have strongly opposed release of settlement information. The
liability insurers obtained a temporary injunction this year barring
the medical board from releasing settlement information requested by
the San Francisco Chronicle.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the doctors group have said they fear that the public
might misinterpret the data.</TE>
<TE>   "Disclosure of settlements will drive patients away from good
doctors and compound already severe health access problems in
California," said Dr. John Whitelaw, the association's president, at
a May 1 legislative hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "Furthermore, settlement disclosure is likely to drive up
malpractice premiums because physicians will more frequently refuse
to settle, thus increasing malpractice insurance costs and delaying
resolution for all concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Board members said their Web site (www.medbd.ca.gov) will provide
patients with background to help them interpret information and place
it in proper context.</TE>
<TE>   Incoming medical board Vice President Dr. Hazem Chehabi said the
board was uncomfortable setting a monetary threshold for disclosure
of settlements, which would have given the public an incomplete
picture.</TE>
<TE>   As it stands, state law requires malpractice carriers to report
only settlements above $30,000 to the board. If that law isn't
changed, smaller agreements would remain out of public view, even if
the board's recommendation is adopted by the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to send a message that we really wanted to disclose all
settlements," said Chehabi, president of the Newport Diagnostic
Center. "We are totally committed to new policies that would protect
the consumers and inform them so that they can make the best
decisions regarding their own health care."</TE>

<HD>Mentally Ill Facing Fewer Barriers in College</HD>
<DH>Education: Their numbers are growing at local campuses
thanks to new medications and federal legislation.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moorpark College student Cheryl Magers finds it difficult to
concentrate in class. Her mind wanders when she should be taking
notes. Tests are an ordeal. And she worries she'll run out of time.</LD>
<LD>   That is why when her classmates take their final exams this
semester, Magers, 21, who has schizophrenia, won't be there. She will
take the test across campus at the college's disabled-students
office, which provides a distraction- and anxiety-free environment
along with an extra half an hour to finish her test.</LD>
<LD>   "I like the alternative testing center, because it is really
quiet," she said. "Nobody is getting up and down from their seat, so
you can focus better on your exam. And you're more comfortable there
because you can bring your drinks in and go to the bathroom if you
want to. It's great."</LD>
<TE>   Magers is one of the nearly 10,000 community college students in
California who identify themselves as "psychologically disabled,"
making them eligible for special services and allowances, including
priority registration, assigned note-takers and permission to
tape-record class lectures.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually invisible in higher education 15 years ago, such
students are a growing population on most campuses thanks to the
availability of new psychotropic drugs and federal legislation that
guarantees the mentally ill equal access to education and employment.</TE>
<TE>   At the state's 108 two-year colleges, students with serious
psychiatric disorders now outnumber all developmentally disabled,
brain-injured, hearing impaired and visually impaired learners
combined.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, mental illness is the third most common reason students
request assistance for a disability, despite the social stigma
attached to conditions such as manic-depression and schizophrenia,
said Scott Hamilton, disabled students coordinator at the California
Community Colleges chancellor's office in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "It has taken longer for students with psychiatric disabilities to
know they can go somewhere and get the services they need to be
successful," Hamilton said.</TE>
<TE>   Accommodations for mentally ill students are similar to those
requested by students with learning disabilities, such as
attention-deficit disorder or dyslexia, Hamilton said.</TE>
<TE>   Most campuses offer alternative test-taking arrangements, tutoring
and access to audio-taped textbooks, voice-recognition software and
other forms of adaptive technology.</TE>
<TE>   Physically disabled students also are usually allowed to register
for classes early.</TE>
<TE>   Priority registration allows psychologically disabled students to
choose course schedules that fit "when they are at their best," said
Leo Orange, coordinator of the Disabled Students Office at Oxnard
College. "If someone is on a lot of medication, we don't want to put
them in a class at 8 or 9 in the morning, because maybe they aren't
completely awake at that time, but are highly functional between 11
and 4."</TE>
<TE>   Other assistance might include the services of a counselor who can
speak to professors on behalf of students who may be struggling or
have fallen behind because of a change in their medication, a
depressive episode or recent hospitalization.</TE>
<TE>   Ellen Young, president of the California Assn. on Post-Secondary
Education and Disability, said mentally ill students face real
learning obstacles and are not using their conditions as an excuse to
"get away with something." If anything, she believes the reverse is
true.</TE>
<TE>   "I am certain that there are literally thousands of students
walking around on college and university campuses who would qualify
for services but are very intimidated by the issue of revealing
themselves," Young said. "Some people argue that extended time on
tests isn't fair, but the truth is that some students need a higher
level of support, and what's fair, not to mention the law, is giving
it to them."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, just knowing such services exist is enough. Ventura
College student Karyn Bates, 55, who suffers from manic-depression,
said that although she always takes her exams with classmates, her
awareness that "if I couldn't do it, I could ask for help" decreased
the anxiety that might have led to failure.</TE>
<TE>   "Otherwise, I would never have made it," she said. "The pressure
makes me feel like I can't do it and ... I have to quit."</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Ewins, who directs Access, a center for disabled students
at Moorpark College, said the end of the semester is usually a busy
time for her staff, which includes a part-time psychologist who
counsels students.</TE>
<TE>   "Test anxiety and the stress that comes at the end of the semester
is perfectly normal, and everyone has that," Ewins said. "But put
that on top of an anxiety disorder or a depressive disorder and it's
a double whammy."</TE>

something--there was nothing but love and lox Sunday for that icon of
maternity.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of sons, daughters, grandchildren and great-grandchildren
filled the courtyards and dining rooms of the Los Angeles Jewish Home
for the Aging to celebrate Mother's Day with the nearly 700 women who
live at the home's two campuses in Reseda.</LD>
<LD>   As Jerry Shapiro's 87-year-old mother, Rebecca, swayed and sang
along to the band's love song, the Tarzana pharmacist wondered what
career the artistically talented woman passed up to raise him and his
sister.</LD>
<TE>   "She's always sacrificed herself for everyone else in the family,"
Shapiro said. "That's basically what a Jewish mother does."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Southern California, mothers took advantage of the
second Sunday in May, which President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed as
theirs in 1914. They planted trees in a San Fernando Valley park and
took free yoga classes in Hollywood. The Anaheim Angels singled out
the "No. 1 Baseball Mom," and in Long Beach, mother dogs were allowed
off their leashes to run on the beach.</TE>
<TE>   On Los Angeles' skid row, Katherine Ford spent Mother's Day
without her five children because she didn't want them to see her
life on the streets. "But I'm thinking about them," the 41-year-old
woman said. "They wanted to come downtown, but I wouldn't bring them
downtown. It's too depressing."</TE>
<TE>   Down the block, Fred Jordan Mission served a Mother's Day meal.
Mothers, with or without their children, ate a free lunch of chicken
and rice. For the last week, the mission gave free makeovers and
manicures to mothers on the street.</TE>
<TE>   Among those at the mission Sunday was Christian Ortega, 11, who
said he wanted to buy his mom flowers but didn't have the money. His
family once went to the beach on Mother's Day, before they fell on
hard times. "But today, nothing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the Jewish Home, Jan Fogelman brought her mother a box of her
favorite candy. Fogelman's mother is rapidly losing her memory, and
like many of the home's visitors Sunday, the child is now caring for
the parent. Fogelman wiped away tears as she talked about her Jewish
mother, who taught her enough to cook for Passover but otherwise
wasn't much in the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   "She didn't cook. She didn't bake. God love her, spaghetti came
out of a can," Fogelman said.</TE>
<TE>   The men of the Jewish home will be honored next month, on Father's
Day. But after nearly three decades of owning a pharmacy that sold
greeting cards, Peter Shapiro, a father and husband, isn't expecting
much.</TE>
<TE>   "Mother's cards always sold out," he remembered. "Father's cards,
we always had left over."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Virginia Strom Turner, 86, pioneering woman city editor and the first
to hold that position in the Scripps Howard newspaper chain, died
Saturday in an automobile accident, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Turner, who attended what was then Texas Western University, was
city editor of the El Paso Herald-Post from 1959 to 1976. In that
period, she was among only a few women to hold such an executive post
on daily newspapers.</LD>
<LD>   During her tenure, she directed the paper's coverage of every
major news story in the El Paso area. She was known for encouraging
and nurturing young journalists.</LD>
<TE>   After she stepped down as city editor, Turner spent the next 20
years writing award-winning columns for the Texas newspaper.</TE>

<HD>Stanford Calderwood, 81; Executive Secured Funding for TV's
'Masterpiece Theatre'</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stanford Calderwood, a businessman and a moving force behind public
broadcasting's "Masterpiece Theatre," died Thursday of pancreatic
cancer at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was 81.</LD>
<LD>   Calderwood was president of WGBH-TV in Boston for just three
months in 1970, but in that time he talked Mobil Oil into giving a
$1-million grant that made it possible to produce the "Masterpiece
Theatre" series.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Scottsbluff, Neb., Calderwood earned his bachelor's degree
at the University of Colorado in 1942. The first of his several
careers was in the Navy during World War II, serving in both the
Atlantic and Pacific theaters.</LD>
<TE>   Returning to civilian life, he became a reporter and photographer
at the Union Leader in Manchester, N.H., and for wire services.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the Polaroid Corp. in 1953, and was an executive vice
president of the company when he left in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   At Polaroid, he was responsible for its early underwriting of a
television cooking series featuring Julia Child.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, he bought control of Trinity Investment Management, which
he headed until 1999.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>

<HD>Davis Aide's Special Job: Keep Heat on Simon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What campaign would be complete without one?</LD>
<LD>   A late-April memo to labor unions from the Gray Davis campaign
announced the new "Deputy Political Director for Rapid Response,"
whose job is to "keep the heat on Simon from now until November."</LD>
<LD>   The heat-seeking campaign includes writing letters to the editor
about Republican Bill Simon's spotty voting record and his not
releasing his tax returns.</LD>
<TE>   The memo suggests using any of 10 bullet points, such as: "Voting
and paying taxes are two things every citizen should do. It looks
like Simon doesn't do either, and he wants our vote?"</TE>
<TE>   Watch for them in a newspaper near you.</TE>

<TE>   Oracle Tout More Than a Footnote in Southland</TE>
<TE>   The original Oracle, the one at Delphi in ancient Greece, was said
to be able to foretell the future.</TE>
<TE>   If that were true of the here and now, Oracle--a software company
caught up in a dust-up over a sweetheart deal with the Davis
administration--might have seen its own debacle coming.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle-watchers have noted the presence of a bit player known for
other political fracases from Orange County to Sacramento: Oracle
lobbyist Ravi Mehta.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, it was Mehta who passed the $25,000 check for Davis'
reelection campaign from Oracle to longtime Davis aide Arun Baheti at
a Sacramento restaurant. Baheti has since resigned.</TE>
<TE>   Mehta wasn't always a footnote.</TE>
<TE>   A former Orange County deputy D.A. and an up-and-coming (rather
than down-and-going) Republican activist, Mehta saw his prospects
glisten in 1995 when then-Gov. Pete Wilson named him to head the Fair
Political Practices Commission. But Mehta was slammed by two FPPC
commissioners and consumer groups after he was paid by Wilson's chief
of staff, Bob White, for personal legal work done even as the FPPC
was investigating a member of Wilson's cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   Mehta quit in August 1997 after he apologized to a gathering of
lobbyists for the passage of a statewide campaign reform measure; he
suggested it was unconstitutional--at the same time he was defending
the measure in court.</TE>
<TE>   Mehta returned to Orange County, and became the first special
counsel hired by a California city to investigate alleged political
misdeeds. A minority of the Anaheim City Council--two Republicans
feuding with the Democratic mayor--approved Mehta's labors, which
ended up costing the city more than $400,000 before a judge put a
stop to it, ruling in 2000 that Mehta had been hired illegally.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Mehta and a pro-business campaign committee were fined
$23,000 for violating political reform laws. In that case, the FPPC
accused its former boss of taking $7,000 from a campaign fund, which
he served as treasurer, and using the money to get a paint job for
his Porsche.</TE>
<TE>   Of the new set-to, "I'm not surprised," says longtime government
watchdog Shirley Grindle of Orange. "The guy's left everywhere under
a cloud."</TE>

<TE>   Attention, Shredders: Cease, Desist, Don't Do It</TE>
<TE>   From Watergate to Iran-Contra to Arthur Andersen and now Oracle,
the sound of shredding is the sound of scandal.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder, then, that at the rumor of document-shredding at an
agency touched by Oracle troubles--the state Department of
Information Technology (DOIT, which is pronounced DOYT, but if we
were lucky, would be DO-IT)--a stop-shredding statement issued forth
at e-speed from Davis' legal affairs secretary, Barry Goode:</TE>
<TE>   "This morning, the governor's legal affairs office received an
unsubstantiated report of possible document shredding at the
Department of Information Technology (DOIT). I immediately called
DOIT, directed it to determine if any shredding was occurring, and,
if so, to cease immediately. I then called the attorney general's
office, reported what we had heard and done, and asked them to
commence an investigation. In cooperation with the attorney general,
the California Highway Patrol was dispatched to secure all shredders
and trash at DOIT. While we had no conclusive evidence that any
shredding or destruction of documents occurred, the mere suggestion
that it may have occurred has led us to take these steps."</TE>
<TE>   And who can't sleep better at night, knowing that DO-IT's trash is
intact?</TE>

<TE>   Victory Toast in China Almost Hits a Sore Spot</TE>
<TE>   The Oxnard Harbor District folks, led by Commissioner Jess
Herrera, made its victory tour of China last month, sealing a deal
affiliating the Port of Hueneme with the Port of Qinhuangdao, about
200 miles east of Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   It's a marriage that could yield a lot of juice when citrus
exports start yielding port fees for the home team. But when the time
came to toast the deal, it wasn't orange juice in those cups.</TE>
<TE>   Herrera admits the delegation was culturally unready for the
contents of the cups--a strong liquor that Herrera described as
having an aroma he didn't immediately associate with drink.</TE>
<TE>   "Gan bei!" was the Chinese toast, translating closely to "Empty
one's cup" or, loosely, "Bottoms up!"</TE>
<TE>   But what with the jet lag, the language gap and the powerful
fragrance coming from his cup, Herrera said it was all he could do to
keep from blurting out, "Ben Gay!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayers Send More Than Feds Give Back</TE>
<TE>   That sucking sound going east? Your tax dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Tax Year 2000 made the 14th consecutive fiscal year that
California sent more tax money to the federal government than it got
back in federal goodies and services. This means, according to the
California Institute, that ever since that kid skateboarding in your
driveway was born, California's money has been bailing out some other
state; in 2000, the difference was $29.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The "trade deficit," as the California Institute calls it, began
after the drying-up of the defense-dollar pipeline that had poured
more than a trillion dollars of federal dough into California since
World War II; that "trade surplus" peaked in fiscal 1984, giving
California $6.8 billion more than it sent east.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, who maxes out at about
5 feet tall, was "particularly upset" that Enron used the name "Get
Shorty" for one of its schemes to try to manipulate energy prices in
California.</TE>
<TE>   * Two parody Web sites--www.voteforbillsimon.com and
www.voteforgraydavis.com--zing the former as having "hired radical
right-wing activists from the 'Traditional Values Coalition' to
promote his election campaign" and the latter as having "accepted
over $119,000 in campaign contributions" from Enron before it filed
for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   * Pathways to Power, a Costa Mesa lunch series sponsored by the
Conservative Women's Leadership Assn., on Thursday hears from U.S.
Treasurer and former Huntington Park Councilwoman Rosario Marin, and
on May 23 from Mindy Tucker, whose resume runs from spokeswoman to
candidate George Bush and Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft to communications
director for the Republican National Committee.</TE>
<TE>   * Reliable sources report that Gray Davis' security detail stopped
Cinco de Mayo traffic around Los Angeles' Olvera Street so
Davis--evidently in the neighborhood for the Mexican American
holiday--could use the men's room.</TE>
<TE>   * In a guest column in a newspaper published in a part of Los
Angeles that no longer wants to be part of Los Angeles--you can take
it from there--L.A. County Sheriff Lee Baca stuck up for his big big
budget against cuts being proposed by his Board of Supervisors
bosses--"except," Baca writes, "Michael A. Antonovich." Antonovich's
middle name is Dennis, whose usual budget-trimming tendencies could
merit the nickname "Dennis the Minus."</TE>
<TE>   * About 28 years after his father's illness made him drop out of
college, and three years after he earned his bachelor's degree in
study-by-mail courses, Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson was awarded an
honorary law doctorate from his recent alma mater, Lincoln University
in Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   * No hard feelings? The California Teachers Assn., which put $2
million into Gray Davis' campaign in 1998, hasn't donated a tenth of
that yet, in spite of Davis' request for a million bucks--and even
so, Davis declared May 8 to be California Day of the Teacher.</TE>
<TE>   * No hard feelings II: The Bill Simon campaign has hired Rod
Lapsley, who worked for Bill Jones in his losing primary campaign
against Simon, and Jones' daughter Andrea, who at 24 is already a
pro, having worked for the presidential campaign of John McCain and
the Senate race of Tom Campbell.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis is in bad shape in terms of his personal popularity
and voters wanting a change. But whether Simon's the guy to do it or
not, we'll have to see."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Tom Davis, a Virginia Republican and head of the National
Republican Congressional Committee, speaking on CNN of Simon's
gubernatorial effort with a decided want of gung-ho enthusiasm.</TE>

<HD>Boroughs Pitched as Middle Ground</HD>
<DH>Politics: Councilwoman says her proposal offers meaningful
local control without breaking up city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NITA LELYVELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Searching for a middle ground that acknowledges separatist sentiments
but that would keep Los Angeles whole, City Councilwoman Wendy Greuel
said Sunday that her proposal for a borough system would likely give
local areas meaningful control over zoning, development and delivery
of services.</LD>
<LD>   Such a structure would go far beyond the city's existing
neighborhood council system in spinning power away from City Hall and
to communities across Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "It is beholden upon us to look at more creative and concrete
solutions to deal with their dissatisfaction," Greuel said of those
who advocate secession by the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood and
harbor areas of Los Angeles. "There's such a feeling of distrust and
cynicism from our constituents. We have to change that."</LD>
<TE>   In office just five weeks, Greuel wants to put a ballot measure to
create city boroughs on the same Nov. 5 ballot expected to include
some secession proposals.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal to devolve some power away from downtown--which also
has the endorsement of Councilwoman Janice Hahn, the mayor's sister,
and Councilman Tom LaBonge--suggests that some city leaders are
taking the secession threat seriously and are prepared to consider
sweeping municipal changes to head it off.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a previous attempt to spin off land-use authority to
communities was turned down during the rewriting of the city charter
several years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But news of the borough proposal surfaced just as secessionists
were dealt a setback in their efforts: The head of the state-run
commission considering secession measures concluded Saturday that the
harbor area would not be a viable independent city.</TE>
<TE>   That undermines the harbor's chances of making it to the ballot
and also weakens the overall secession effort by lessening the
chances that three areas of the city might all be able to try to
break away at once, supporting one another as part of an overall Los
Angeles breakup.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever secession proposals make it on the ballot, the borough
measure could give voters an in-between alternative on Nov. 5, less
extreme than ripping the city apart, more demanding that letting a
vote against secession stand as an endorsement of city government
status quo.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to stop and be silent while people try to rip apart
this great city," LaBonge said. "I'm going to go out and debate all
the options."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mayor's Silence Fuels Speculation</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's brother, Mayor James K. Hahn, has so far been silent on the
subject, declining to answer questions about the substance of the
idea or even to say whether he has discussed the issue with his
sister.</TE>
<TE>   His reticence has fueled some speculation that the borough
proposal is being floated to test the response before the mayor
commits one way or the other. On Sunday, Greuel denied that, saying
details were leaked before she intended to make the proposal public.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel isn't the first, or the only, person talking about bringing
boroughs to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of creating a borough structure similar to those in New
York and London was proposed three years ago during the city's debate
over charter reform, but was rejected by the panels charged with
rewriting that document.</TE>
<TE>   The city's new charter, adopted by voters in 1999, instead created
a citywide network of neighborhood councils whose role is purely
advisory.</TE>
<TE>   In the charter debate, some neighborhood council advocates had
urged the commissions drafting the new city charter to give those
councils zoning and land-use authority and to have their members
elected rather than chosen more informally. Some commissioners
initially favored that idea, but dropped it over concerns about who
would serve on the councils and over fears that they would stifle
growth and balkanize the city.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the issue did not end with adoption of the new charter.</TE>
<TE>   California State Librarian Kevin Starr recently gave a
well-attended lecture at UCLA called "Borough, Si! Secession, No! Or,
It's Time to Start Thinking About a Borough System for Los Angeles."
(Greuel and LaBonge were in the audience.)</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento, state Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar), who has
announced his intention to run for mayor of an independent Valley,
has authored a bill that would call on the University of California
to study secession alternatives, including boroughs and wards. That
study, however, would not be completed before a November secession
vote.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel said she spoke to Alarcon and David Fleming, a Studio City
lawyer and chairman of the Economic Alliance of the San Fernando
Valley, who has long been an advocate of the borough alternative but
is also a financial supporter of Valley secession.</TE>
<TE>   Kam Kuwata, the political strategist working on the mayor's
promised campaign against secession, said he only just learned of the
borough ballot plan and was not involved in it. He said that the
mayor's campaign had no stand on the issue, but that on the surface,
a new plan for city government seemed premature in light of the
recent charter reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "The neighborhood council idea--of having neighborhood groups form
and have real input into how they're governed--is just beginning," he
said. "We're foursquare behind the neighborhood councils."</TE>
<TE>   Jaime Regalado, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute of
Public Affairs at Cal State L.A., said he was unsure on hearing of
the borough idea whether or not it was simply symbolic, a way of
showing voters that city leaders hear their concerns. He said that he
too thought sticking with neighborhood councils made sense.</TE>
<TE>   "One way to do this is to really try to arm neighborhood councils
as best they can," he said of City Council members. "That's something
that already exists, even though it's untested and they don't have
formal powers."</TE>
<TE>   Greuel, who supports the councils, said news of the borough plan
leaked out Friday before she was ready with some substantive details
about how it might work. Among other things, Greuel said, she was
still undecided about how many boroughs to recommend. She suggested
anywhere from five to 15 might be feasible.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Control Sought Over Local Schools</TE>
<TE>   Greuel also said she would like to find a way in the plan for
local areas to get more control over their schools. Secession would
not change the relationship between city governments and schools,
which are operated separately now and would be even after a municipal
breakup.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, Greuel said, she would like the ballot proposal to be
flexible enough to allow for more debate on details but firm enough
to ensure that a borough system with real substance be put in place
by a certain date.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said Greuel called him about her
proposal Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very late in the game for this. They've got less than three
months to put this on the ballot, and it's a very complicated thing,"
he said. "If they can do it, it has a lot of possibilities, but I
think one has to be very skeptical about how much they can do in the
time left."</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky said the only real possibility he saw of getting a
borough measure in place in time would be to make it quite vague. "If
it's not all the way, it's going to be met with skepticism, and
that's not good for anybody," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel said news of the harbor area report released Saturday only
pointed out the uncertainties of secession. But she added that she
was continually struck during her recent council campaign by how deep
the frustrations with Los Angeles government go--and how serious the
need for change is.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept hearing people say, 'We have so many problems with the
city, and if the city doesn't do something, we're going to vote for
secession,'" Greuel said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have to be able to demonstrate is that this proposal has
real power, that it is something that has real teeth in it."</TE>

<HD>Sex Offenders Seek End to Extra Jail Time</HD>
<DH>Court: Even though sentences are served, inmates are held
while awaiting hearings on possible commitment to mental hospitals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attorneys for eight repeat sex offenders are accusing the state of
acting unconstitutionally by housing the men, who have already
completed their prison sentences, in Los Angeles County jails rather
than in hospitals and by denying them mental health treatment during
their stays.</LD>
<LD>   The inmates are awaiting court hearings to determine whether they
will be committed to state hospitals under California's Sexually
Violent Predator Act, which took effect in 1996 and was clarified by
a recent state Supreme Court decision.</LD>
<LD>   The attorneys have asked judges to order their clients placed in
the hospitals during the hearing process, which can last years. They
filed motions saying that the inmates, who are alleged to have mental
disorders, are being treated like prisoners rather than patients.</LD>
<TE>   After receiving the motions, Superior Court Judge David S. Wesley
brought the cases into one courtroom in March and has heard testimony
for several weeks. His pending decision could apply to 112 men who
committed their sex crimes in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   "Anecdotally, I've been hearing a lot of horror stories, so I
thought it was time to look into this," Wesley, assisting supervising
judge of the criminal division, said in an interview. "I'm not saying
these are good people. I'm saying they are still human beings."</TE>
<TE>   Though Wesley is still studying the laws, he said he is inclined
to believe it is only right to provide the inmates mental health
services. "If we are going to house these people on the premises, we
should be giving them treatment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The sex predator law allows judges or juries to commit repeat sex
offenders to state hospitals after their prison terms have ended.</TE>
<TE>   The process is twofold. After release from prison, the offender is
transferred to a county jail, where he is arraigned and then
participates in a hearing to determine if there is probable cause to
believe he may commit new sexually violent crimes.</TE>
<TE>   If probable cause is found, the inmate is sent to Atascadero State
Hospital until his trial, which will determine whether he should be
committed to the hospital for two years. For that to happen, at least
two mental health experts must have determined that the inmate
presents a "substantial danger" to society because he is likely to
attack again.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Jail is home to 51 repeat sex offenders,
some of whom have been awaiting probable cause hearings for more than
three years, jail officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Wesley issued an order in March to the state attorney general and
Department of Mental Health asking them to show why the offenders
should not be housed in a state hospital and receive mental health
treatment pending their probable cause hearings.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to see what's wrong," Wesley said. "I just want to know
how people can be detained for so many years without treatment and
without trial."</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general's office, representing the Mental Health
Department, responded in writing that the state has no legal
responsibility to provide treatment until offenders arrive at
Atascadero State Hospital after their probable cause hearings.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no law saying we should bring treatment into the local
county jail, and there is definitely no law saying they should be
transferred to another facility," said Deputy Atty. Gen. Karen
Ackerson-Brazille, who added that the housing issue has been raised
in other counties as well.</TE>
<TE>   Department of Mental Health spokeswoman Nora Romero said the
attorneys are responsible for their clients' lengthy waits in county
jail because they often seek postponements of the court hearings.</TE>
<TE>   "If they really want treatment, all they have to do is go forward
with the probable cause hearing," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The attorneys counter that it takes a long time to gather case
histories, get their clients evaluated and argue legal issues that
arise. Attorney Jonathan Mandel said that at one client's request, he
sacrificed that time and moved forward with the probable cause
hearing so the client could get transferred from jail to the
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wants to rush, because you want to prepare," he said. "But
if you don't rush, they're sitting in jail."</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Todd L. Melnik said it is unconstitutional for his client
to be forced to wait in jail rather than a hospital for his probable
cause hearing, because he has already been punished for his crime.</TE>
<TE>   His client, Barry Blake, finished his state prison term for
assault in May 2000. But because of two prior convictions on sex
charges, he has been waiting to see if he will be committed to a
hospital before being released into the community. Melnik has asked
that Blake be placed in a hospital pending those hearings.</TE>
<TE>   A 1999 California Supreme Court decision upholding the predator
law as constitutional said that it was not designed to be punitive
and should treat the offenders "not as criminals, but as sick
persons." Melnik said the law is being applied in a punitive way.</TE>
<TE>   "Here he has been in county jail for two years, not getting a lick
of treatment," Melnik said. "If these guys are really mentally ill,
then why aren't we doing more to rehabilitate them?"</TE>
<TE>   Melnik, along with the other attorneys, is arguing that a recently
amended section of the state Penal Code says a sex offender must be
housed in a facility that "can continue the person's program of
treatment, provide adequate security, and minimize interference with
the person's program of treatment."</TE>
<TE>   If the person is not receiving such treatment, the law says the
court should order the person transferred to another facility, such
as a state hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The state attorney general's office, however, argues that the
section applies only to repeat sex offenders who are in outpatient
programs--of which there are currently none.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, repeat sex offenders are housed in the Twin Towers
jail downtown and are segregated from the general jail population for
their own safety.</TE>
<TE>   "It's manpower-intensive," said Senior Deputy Paul Schrader.
"Anytime they go anywhere, we have to make sure the other inmates are
either locked down or placed in another area."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant County Counsel Kevin Brazile, who represents the
Sheriff's Department, said jail officials are trying to treat the
offenders like civil detainees rather than criminals by housing them
in a dorm area and giving them some special privileges, such as more
access to vending machines and cable television. They also can have
more personal belongings than regular inmates, Brazile said.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's a jail, so there's only so much we can do with them," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Brazile said the jail does not have the resources or the
authorization to provide sex offender treatment. The county Mental
Health Department said it doesn't have the expertise or funding to
treat the inmates either.</TE>
<TE>   Not only are the men being denied mental health treatment in
county jail, their attorneys said, they also do not have regular
access to education, rehabilitation programs or religious services.
They receive inconsistent medical treatment and are subject to strip
searches, their attorneys said. Until Judge Wesley ruled otherwise,
the men were shackled when they were brought into court.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender John Douglas, who represents four inmates
who are at Atascadero and will be brought to Los Angeles for their
trials, is asking that his clients be placed in a facility run by the
state or county mental health departments to receive required
treatment for those detained due to mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   The state, he said, "can't just wash their hands of these guys
because they're currently in local custody."</TE>
<TE>   During one of the hearings in Wesley's courtroom, repeat sex
offender Kenneth Ciancio said he had not received treatment since
December 1998, when he arrived at Los Angeles County Jail to await
his probable cause hearing. His case is taking a long time in part
because he has been contesting the state's claim that he even
qualifies under the law to be considered a sexually violent predator.</TE>
<TE>   During the hearing, the judge read aloud a letter from the
California Department of Corrections congratulating Ciancio on
completing his prison sentence and saying that the department hoped
he would reenter the community successfully someday.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the letter, Ciancio said, "I'm still hoping that day
comes."</TE>

<HD>Lake Stays Blue but Critics of Panel See Red</HD>
<DH>Environment: Tough and powerful, the Tahoe Regional
Planning Agency rules over most aspects of life on the fragile
shoreline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Some see it as the guardian of the lake. Others consider it a
bureaucratic boogeyman. Most figure it is a bit of both, a strict
disciplinarian prescribing bitter medicine with good intentions--to
save Lake Tahoe's deep-blue waters.</LD>
<LD>   For three decades, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency has ruled
over most aspects of life in the vast alpine bowl cradling the lake.
In the process, planners say, Tahoe's shoreline has become one of the
most tightly regulated places on the planet.</LD>
<LD>   Recently, the agency won a victory in the U.S. Supreme Court. On
April 23, the justices upheld the agency's right to impose a
three-year building ban in the early 1980s as it studied how best to
keep Tahoe's water from being clouded by increasing runoff from
development.</LD>
<TE>   But the decision was in many ways just another signpost along the
long, bumpy road the agency has traveled as it leads the charge to
stem human impact on the lake's sapphire waters.</TE>
<TE>   Guided by a 14-member board composed of representatives drawn
equally from California and Nevada, the planning agency wades into
debates of water quality and wildlife, noise and scenic views, forest
health and fisheries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Agency Implements Limits on Growth</TE>
<TE>   For years, it has maintained a strict limit on growth, allowing
300 new residential units a year around the lake's 72 miles of
shoreline. Lots can't be subdivided. To simply expand a wood deck
requires a drawn-out review. In scenic spots, the agency dictates
everything from a home's hue to the number of trees that mask it from
view.</TE>
<TE>   Controversy is a frequent companion, like the ruckus raised a few
years ago when the agency banned two-stroke engines on power water
skis and outboard motorboats, fingered as big polluters of the lake
because they can leak unburned gas.</TE>
<TE>   But often as not the planning agency gets down and dirty in the
details. It helped produced a thick landscaping guide for the Tahoe
basin. Residents are urged to avoid using fertilizer that can wash
off lawns and into the lake. The agency even advises them to refrain
from raking up pine needles, which trap sediment and pollutants.</TE>
<TE>   "If people understand what's at stake, they'll do the reasonable
thing," said Juan Palma, the agency's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   But the small victories can't eclipse the big problem. Some
scientists fear there is no way to reverse the trend of clarity loss
in the lake. The embrace of civilization, they say, is just too
strong: Tahoe has more than 56,000 permanent residents and a
population swelling to 200,000 on a big summer weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Undeterred, the planning agency is marshaling a $908-million
effort to retrofit storm drains, reintroduce lakefront wetlands,
restore creeks to their natural banks and generally attempt to undo
the plumbing system installed since growth began to explode in the
region after World War II.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest hurdles remains the myriad homes and businesses
built before current practices took hold. Fixing such places
typically means doing relatively easy things, such as siphoning
rainwater from roofs and funneling it into a rock-filled drainage
ditch.</TE>
<TE>   But getting homeowners to comply is a big task. With a planning
agency staff of just 70, the hope is that residents will take up the
cause without regulatory prodding.</TE>
<TE>   Out on the shoreline streets, the planning agency is notorious for
its regulatory recalcitrance. Though agency staff see it as urban
legend run amok, many homeowners bristle when talk turns to the
agency.</TE>
<TE>   They've heard countless horror stories about long waits for simple
building permits, denials of innocuous projects and restrictions on
private property rights that are taken for granted elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a necessary evil. You need guidelines; otherwise
everything would go to heck," said Warren Bedwell, who owns a home on
one of the man-made canals of Tahoe Keys, a 1960s waterfront
development that helped hasten the creation of the regional planning
agency.</TE>
<TE>   But he sees a flip side. Bedwell has friends who couldn't add
backyard decks because of the agency. "It seems the pendulum has
swung too far."</TE>
<TE>   The agency's history has been tangled from the beginning. Formed
in 1969 by a compact approved by Tahoe's border states--the
California-Nevada line splits the water--and ratified by Congress,
the early years were dogged by controversy. Environmentalists said
the agency was too developer-friendly, while property owners gasped
over new restrictions. Trust was nonexistent even between the two
states; California created a separate agency to guide development on
its side of the border during the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   A revised compact in the early 1980s ushered in a period of even
more intense wrangling. Gary Midkiff, a former executive director of
the planning agency, says that when he joined in 1983, the staff
"couldn't agree a lot of days when to go to lunch." A siege mentality
ruled.</TE>
<TE>   But slowly the agency began to develop a consensus approach to
solving differences among the basin's factions, even as scientific
evidence of the lake's decline continued to mount.</TE>
<TE>   The last decade has been far more harmonious. All involved agree
that the lake's future is paramount.</TE>
<TE>   Battles continue, of course, albeit at a more muffled pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists want to see already-tight building restrictions
ratcheted down further, from the current 300 a year to as few as 100
annually.</TE>
<TE>   "We still see the agency as essentially very pro-development,"
said Rochelle Nason, executive director of the League to Save Lake
Tahoe.</TE>
<TE>   The business sector and property rights advocates, meanwhile, are
pressing for the planning agency to ease its tough stance on
development right on the shore or at other high-visibility locations.</TE>
<TE>   Midkiff, these days a Tahoe building consultant, said the agency
now "treats anything that's man-made as bad." That proves irksome for
wealthy clients who sometimes spend $30 million on a shoreline
property, only to be told that those breathtaking views stand to be
sullied by trees.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, homes in excess of 10,000 square feet have continued to
sprout on the shoreline. Among the denizens are financier Michael
Milken, Mike Love of the Beach Boys and heirs to the Singer sewing
machine fortune.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing nothing but these monster mega homes," said Nason,
who worries that the huge structures--and the floating piers, docks
and storage buildings that go along with them--threaten to trample
what remains of the lake's rocky shoreline.</TE>
<TE>   Affordable housing, meanwhile, is virtually nonexistent. Casino
workers, bus boys, maids, gardeners and even mid-level professionals
are forced to commute across the pass from more affordable Nevada
towns such as Carson City and Minden.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial building costs have skyrocketed with the agency's
restrictions, but that hasn't halted a redevelopment boom in South
Lake Tahoe, where a veritable alpine village of new hotels,
restaurants and shops is rising on land once dominated by kitschy,
1950s-style commercial sprawl. It's all linked to nearby Heavenly
Valley ski resort by a $26-million aerial tramway.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Increasing Demand for Mass Transit</TE>
<TE>   On any weekend, cars crowd the roads. Auto exhaust dumps more than
half the nitrogen that ends up in the lake. But efforts to boost mass
transit--and get both locals and tourists out of cars--have lagged.</TE>
<TE>   "We're woefully behind," said Ron McIntyre of the North Lake Tahoe
Resort Assn. "We're in the most sensitive spot in the world, but
we're lagging places like Aspen, Vail, Sun Valley."</TE>
<TE>   Though a plan is afoot to pool private hotel and casino shuttles
with public buses, there still won't be enough to provide the sort of
frequent service needed to attract riders.</TE>
<TE>   Palma and others hope to boost ridership more than 1 million a
year with new technology. By the end of the year, they hope to
install high-tech stops on the lake's southern shore. Riders will get
a computer update from a global positioning satellite keeping track
of buses on the road.</TE>
<TE>   This effort to save a lake is occurring on a shrinking stage. With
more than three-quarters of the basin under federal ownership and
tight growth caps in place, Tahoe is fast approaching capacity.</TE>
<TE>   In all, only about 6,000 undeveloped parcels remain, and 2,000 of
them are expected to be purchased by land trusts and declared
off-limits. In the next five years, only about 150,000 square feet of
new commercial development is expected to be allowed.</TE>
<TE>   Palma, for one, sees a big debate coming: a push to return
government land to private ownership.</TE>
<TE>   "There's going to be pressures to release public lands for
development," he said. "The question will be: When it hits, will the
people have the will to withstand it?"</TE>

<HD>'Spy Plane' Sets Sights on Grading in O.C. Canyon</HD>
<DH>Environment: Work is halted at site of proposed youth
center after it's secretly photographed. No permits, foes say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Folks around Trabuco Canyon insist they're not rebellious by nature.
It's just that the stakes are high in their fight against a neighbor
who bulldozed four acres of oaks and coastal sage scrub without state
and federal permits.</LD>
<LD>   To assess the extent of the grading, they hired a biologist to
videotape the work. After all, the residents said, the area was
possible habitat for endangered or threatened species. But the
biologist was shooed off the property.</LD>
<LD>   Undaunted, the residents borrowed an idea from the war in
Afghanistan and hired Larry Fleming, who strapped a 35-millimeter
camera to a remote-controlled model airplane and flew it over what
residents consider a battle zone. The images were not CIA quality,
but residents were happy with their "reconnaissance drone."</LD>
<TE>   And they succeeded in getting the grading stopped.</TE>
<TE>   The offending neighbor in this case is the Orange County Probation
Department, which has locked horns with residents over construction
of the 90-bed Rancho Potrero Leadership Academy at Joplin Youth
Center. The center sits on 338 acres above the community of Trabuco
Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Building Suit Cites Environmental Reasons</TE>
<TE>   A lawsuit filed in January by the Rural Canyons Conservation Fund
and the Saddleback Canyons Conservancy seeks to halt the
construction. The suit alleges that the county created a special
planning district "to bypass environmental protections" for the land.</TE>
<TE>   It also alleges that a proposed paved road leading to the facility
across Trabuco Creek could cause extensive environmental
damage--charges Probation Department officials dispute.</TE>
<TE>   The county says the academy is needed to ease overcrowding at
Juvenile Hall in Orange and other facilities. In addition, county
officials said, placing boys and girls in a rural setting helps their
rehabilitation because it gets them out of their daily routine.</TE>
<TE>   The Probation Department must complete construction of the academy
by Dec. 31, 2003, or it could lose a state Board of Corrections grant
that covers $8.4 million of the estimated $18 million in construction
costs.</TE>
<TE>   When the Probation Department applied for the money in 1998, its
officials believed the project could be finished by the deadline,
said Thomas G. Wright, chief deputy probation officer.</TE>
<TE>   Wright said through a spokesman that although the grading has been
halted, "it has not interfered with the [construction] timing of the
Rancho Potrero Leadership Academy."</TE>
<TE>   The department plans to chose a contractor by June 30.</TE>
<TE>   Probation officials initially had said they had sufficient permits
from the county to grade a slope at Joplin to reinforce a sewage pond
on the property. A county planning department spokesman told
residents not to worry, that "everything's fine."</TE>
<TE>   But when it was determined that the Probation Department did not
have state Fish and Game and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service permits,
the planning department ordered the grading stopped. The mistake was
attributed to "miscommunication" between the two agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Robb Hamilton, the biologist hired by residents to survey the
area, reported that it contains coastal sage scrub and other
vegetation that provide a "habitat to be potentially suitable for
nesting by the federally threatened coastal California gnatcatcher."</TE>
<TE>   Probation Department officials now must meet with state Fish and
Game and federal Fish and Wildlife Service officials to talk about
mitigation measures before resuming the work. Probation officials
have repeatedly said that the grading and other work is not related
to the academy project, though residents have insisted otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   "This is still being investigated and a full assessment has yet to
be completed," said Mervin Hee, state Fish and Game's regional patrol
chief in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   When coastal sage scrub is bulldozed with proper permits, Fish and
Game typically requires a 2-to-1 or 3-to-1 ratio of substitute
habitat elsewhere. But because the county did not have a permit, the
penalty could be stiffer: about 20 acres, or at least a 5-to-1 ratio,
Hee said.</TE>
<TE>   When some residents logged onto the county's Web site last week to
check permits for the work already underway, they were aghast to read
that a grading plan described the work as "Precise Grading For Rancho
Potrero Leadership Academy."</TE>
<TE>   "Immediately, we wanted to know what was going on," said Richard
Gomez, a spokesman for the Saddleback Canyons Conservancy. "We had
been told the grading had nothing to do with the academy."</TE>
<TE>   A subsequent power interruption made accessing the Web site
impossible. When power was restored, the site still couldn't be
viewed.</TE>
<TE>   The turn of events only served to solidify one thought in the
community: "You can't trust the county," Gomez said.</TE>
<TE>   County planning department spokesman Brian Murphy said Joplin's
maintenance work--including road widening, and slope and sewage pond
repair--is separate from the Rancho Potrero proposal.</TE>
<TE>   He said the wording for the grading plan was a "clerical error" by
someone who confused the two projects and put the wrong title on the
document.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Differing Views Over Allowing Bulldozing</TE>
<TE>   At a Board of Supervisors' meeting last week, many canyon
residents chastised the county for getting caught "with its pants
down."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer, whose district includes the Joplin site,
has called on Michael Schumacher, the county's executive officer, to
investigate the illegal bulldozing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm beyond upset by the illegal grading," Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Lichtman, an attorney who represents the community, said
Joplin's maintenance project coincidentally covers the same drainage
area, road and sewage pond that will be used by the county when it
builds the academy.</TE>
<TE>   "The county hasn't taken into account the accumulative
environmental impact," Lichtman said. "[The county argues] that the
Joplin area is separate from the Rancho Potrero area. Well, tell that
to the gnatcatcher," Lichtman said.</TE>
<TE>   Probation officials say facilities such as Joplin and Juvenile
Hall in Orange are too crowded and won't be able to meet the
projected need.</TE>
<TE>   They estimate they will need 726 "secure" beds in a locked,
guarded facility such as Juvenile Hall by 2005; there are 538 now.</TE>
<TE>   They say they will also need 605 "non-secure" beds, such as those
at Joplin, by 2005; they have 314. Rancho Potrero would ease the
crowding, officials say.</TE>

illegal grading as part of a stepped-up public relations campaign
against the county. The pictures may also end up as evidence in the
pending lawsuit.</TE>

but settled on the model airplane because the other was too
expensive," she said. "I hope we're making an impression on the
county that we are not going away. We are not giving up."</TE>

<LD>A Camarillo home was destroyed early Sunday when fire spread quickly
through an upstairs bedroom and engulfed most of the residence.</LD>
<LD>   No one was home at the time of the fire, which began about 6:20
a.m. and was extinguished by firefighters about half an hour later,
said Vicki Crabtree, a spokeswoman for the Ventura County Fire
Department.</LD>

<LD>A 60-year-old Oregon man shot himself to death in the frontyard of an
Oxnard home after holding three adults and a 4-month-old baby hostage
and refusing orders from SWAT team members and hostage negotiators to
surrender, authorities said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The identification of the man was withheld pending notification of
his family, Deputy Medical Examiner Mike Feiler said.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the man walked out of the house in the 1000 block of
Denver Place just before 8 a.m. Saturday after holding his ex-wife
and three others hostage since Friday afternoon. Authorities said
telephone negotiations with the man had gone on through the night.</LD>
<TE>   He talked briefly with SWAT officers as he held a handgun to his
head before shooting himself, said Cmdr. Tom Chronister.</TE>

<HD>Tijuana's Accidental Zoo</HD>
<DH>Animals: Confiscated and cast-out creatures have found a
home in a compound at the city's largest park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TIJUANA</DL>
<LD>Parrots sold on street corners. Pythons stuffed in a smuggler's
backpack. A tiger that outgrew his owner's backyard.</LD>
<LD>   Confiscated and cast aside, animals such as these have found a
home in an accidental zoo that has sprung up in Tijuana's largest
park, where a unique collection of creatures rescued from the
border's black market has been quietly growing.</LD>
<LD>   The two-acre facility got its start in Parque Morelos back in
1995, when Mexican environmental inspectors dropped off several cages
full of parrots taken from vendors who lacked permits for the birds.
The next year, authorities brought in Nala, a lion cub found in the
back of a car in Mexicali. Then the local police handed over an
albino Burmese python named Yuri that had been used in an act by a
table dancer.</LD>
<TE>   Before long, Tijuana had its first public zoo. The city hired a
biologist and a veterinarian to handle the growing menagerie.</TE>
<TE>   Bit by bit, the city erected large green cages for the animals
alongside a small pond in this 148-acre swath of open land that
serves as the city's Central Park.</TE>
<TE>   The thousands of visitors who flock there every weekend now get an
up-close view of exotic animals for their 50-cent park entry fee.</TE>
<TE>   "The zoo really came about in an accidental manner," said Raul
Hinostroza, a spokesman for the city park system. "The city wasn't
planning on starting one, but they needed a place to put all these
animals."</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, the unintended zoo is the natural byproduct of a
border culture where contraband is rampant. The majority of the 246
creatures housed at Parque Morelos were taken from smugglers and
street vendors.</TE>
<TE>   Other animals have been donated by people who could no longer care
for them, such as the family who tried unsuccessfully to adopt a
raccoon named Charlie that they found in the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   The Tijuana zoo lacks the lush landscaping and elaborate exhibits
of the highly regarded San Diego Zoo north of the border. The animals
are kept in simple cages just a few steps from the walkways used by
visitors. A few rudimentary signs explain what the creatures are.</TE>
<TE>   But city and federal officials say the facility is safe and clean,
a refuge for animals that have been abused and abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   And the assortment of creatures does not fail to impress local
visitors.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, a gaggle of young boys gaped at a
3-year-old Siberian tiger named Billy playfully batting his declawed
paw at a zoo employee.</TE>
<TE>   As the tiger turned and loped to the front of his cage, the
children scattered, squealing in delight. The large cat was donated
to the zoo by a wealthy Tijuana man who had rescued it from a circus,
then realized the animal needed more space.</TE>
<TE>   "He's beautiful," said first-time visitor Olivia Lopez, 19. "I
never knew this place was here before. It's so pretty."</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, a dozen parrots in rainbow sherbet hues dipped and danced
through trees in a large enclosure. Four pygmy foxes curled up in a
sunny patch on the cement floor of their cage.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the animals were suffering and/or badly treated before
they got there," said Guillermo Lopez Reyes, assistant regional
director of the federal environmental protection agency, whose
inspectors confiscated many of the animals now housed at the zoo.</TE>
<TE>   Several falcons were brought in with damaged wings after being
pelted and shot. The Burmese python was sickly from its tenure in a
smoky strip club.</TE>
<TE>   Other animals arrived malnourished and dehydrated, neglected by
owners who didn't know the appropriate diet for wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Veterinarian Carla Coss y Leon fusses over all of them, nursing
the animals back to health in hopes that they can be returned to
their original habitats. Those that can't remain at the zoo on
exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I have an obligation to help them, because many of
them are disappearing," Coss y Leon said on a recent afternoon, as
she scratched the back of Nala, a friendly lioness who rubbed up
against the bars of the cage for a pat.</TE>
<TE>   The zoo has become a way station of sorts for endangered animals,
especially birds that have been captured in the jungles of Central
and South America.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican officials discover many being sold illegally on street
corners or in pet stores. At least once a month, U.S. officials find
sedated parrots hidden inside clothes or vehicles of people trying to
cross the border in San Ysidro.</TE>
<TE>   Animals confiscated in the U.S. are quarantined and put up for
auction. Because the Mexican environmental agency doesn't have its
own facility for animals, the creatures found south of the border are
sent to places like the Tijuana zoo, where Coss y Leon takes over
their care.</TE>
<TE>   In her small office, the veterinarian keeps an eye on a few of the
animals too sick or nervous to be on public display. A shy owl monkey
with luminous yellow eyes peeks out at visitors from under a green
blanket. Above him, a sickly parrot with scruffy gray feathers clings
to the top of the cage.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't care what they bring," Coss y Leon said. "We're just
happy to take them, and do what we can."</TE>
<TE>   The zoo can't take every homeless creature. Last year, Mexican
officials confiscated seven sick lions from a traveling circus, but
Coss y Leon didn't have the space to house them. The cats were
distributed to other zoos in Baja California, including a private one
in Tijuana run by wealthy racetrack owner Jorge Hank Rhon.</TE>
<TE>   Coss y Leon hopes to expand the Parque Morelos zoo, starting with
a larger cage for Billy the tiger. Eventually, she wants to build a
full-scale animal hospital at the park so she won't have to rely on
help from outside animal specialists.</TE>
<TE>   Workers are already digging the foundation of what will be a
petting zoo for children, a place she envisions will help the young
people of Tijuana learn to appreciate the animal kingdom.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to teach children to learn how to care for an animal,
both the pets in their home and wildlife, so when they see one they
won't want to hurt it," she said. "And who knows? Maybe their parents
will learn something, as well."</TE>

<LD>More than 150 people in wheelchairs staged a Mother's Day protest
outside the White House to demand that President Bush fund
alternatives to nursing homes for the elderly and the disabled.</LD>
<LD>   Scores of people in wheelchairs lined Pennsylvania Avenue on
either side of a giant Mother's Day "card" addressed to the
president's wife, Laura, and his mother, Barbara. It asked them to
urge Bush to support funding for measures such as assistance to help
people live at home rather than in institutions.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a better way to treat our grandmothers, mothers,
daughters and sisters," said the placard, adding that most people in
nursing homes are women.</LD>

<LD>The main terminal at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International
Airport was evacuated for three hours after a security incident
involving a passenger waiting to board an airliner.</LD>
<LD>   Airport Police Chief Chuck Melville said the man passed the main
checkpoint, but during a random search at the gate, Comair employees
found marijuana.</LD>
<LD>   "He alleged he had a penknife, but no penknife was found,"
Melville said. The statement alone prompted the evacuation.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier Sunday, U.S. Department of Transportation spokeswoman
Kathleen Bergen had said a screener found a cigar-cutting knife in

<HD>Florida's Urban Sprawl No Match for Lovelorn Gators</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: May is mating season, and aggressive males are
driving rival suitors out of the backwoods and into recently
populated areas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>THE REDLANDS, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The springtime drama took place along the sunny lake shore at Jones
Trailer Park west of Miami, where the young Labrador belonging to the
man in Lot 27 loved to play.</LD>
<LD>   Wanda Chambers didn't witness the attack. But she saw the 7-foot
alligator amble by her two-bedroom mobile home afterward, the brown
dog's lifeless form clamped in its powerful jaws.</LD>
<LD>   "The gator ... was swinging it up in the air and just tearing it
apart," the 55-year-old Chambers said. "Now the gator is back by my
dock, laying on the bank." She is afraid the reptile's next victim
will not be a pet, but one of the young children who like to sail toy
boats on the lake.</LD>
<TE>   It's May, the height of the mating season for Florida's
alligators. And because of hormonal secretions, the walnut-size
brains of these giant reptiles are filled with thoughts of love.
Males have become meaner and more competitive, driving thousands of
rival suitors out of the Everglades and backwoods and into more
populated areas--people's yards, garages, carports, swimming pools,
and neighborhood lakes.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people say: 'Cherry blossoms in Washington, it's
spring,' " said Todd Hardwick, a professional wild animal trapper and
native Floridian. "I say: 'Alligators in the driveway, it's spring.
Lock up your poodles.' "</TE>
<TE>   In the checkered saga of the Sunshine State's fast-paced growth,
it is hard to find a more emblematic story than man's conflict with
the alligator. For as long as 4 million years, Alligator
Mississipiensis and its ancestors have dwelt in these locales. As for
the humans, many in Florida literally got here just last year.</TE>
<TE>   With an estimated 1,000 new residents each day on average, more
and more homes are going up in areas that traditionally were
alligator habitat. During mating time, Floridians consequently are
more likely to find themselves face to face with a cold-blooded
predatory beast that is one of nature's most perfect killing
machines.</TE>
<TE>   "What used to be the basking areas, where alligators would lay out
in the sun, or nesting areas 10 years ago are now golf courses,
people's backyards, swimming pools," said Louis Guillette, a
professor of zoology at the University of Florida in Gainesville and
a gator specialist.</TE>
<TE>   Humans should remember that, historically speaking, they are the
trespassers, Guillette said. "I'm always amazed that people come to
Florida and build a brand-new house on the side of a lake, and
they're shocked the first time they put their boat in the water and
want to go water skiing, and there are alligators."</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean older, built-up areas are gator-free. Hardwick,
who is licensed by the state to trap nuisance alligators, has pulled
animals out of the Miami River in the heart of Florida's biggest
city. Last week, Hardwick, 39, rolled out of bed at 2 a.m. to snare
an 8-foot, 150-pound gator that was waddling down the shoulder of the
well-traveled road outside Burger King headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, there were 16,749 complaints of gators threatening
people, pets or property--a record since the state's Fish and
Wildlife Conservation Commission began keeping a tally in 1977. More
than 7,200 gators judged a risk by game wardens were captured and
killed.</TE>
<TE>   But that was not enough to avert the 11 incidents in which
alligators bit people, or the three fatal attacks. A 2-year-old Polk
County girl who wandered from her home was grabbed by a gator at
least three times her weight and dragged into a lake, where she
drowned. An 8-footer snatched a 70-year-old man in Venice, pulled him
into a pond and mauled his head, chest and arms, causing him to bleed
to death. On Sanibel Island, off Fort Myers on the state's west
coast, an 81-year-old man was attacked as he walked his dog. The
alligator tore off the man's right leg from the knee down.</TE>
<TE>   "Alligators have great smell and great vision," Guillette said.
"And they are opportunistic eaters. If you take your puppy dog down
by the lake ... it becomes prey. Toddlers too."</TE>
<TE>   In 1967, alligators were placed on the first federal list of
endangered species. But experts now say that their numbers might have
been underestimated and the alarm over their fate unwarranted.
Florida is home to about 1 million alligators, which live in all of
the state's 67 counties.</TE>
<TE>   "They are just so dominant in the environment they live in, they
have no reason to be fearful of anything," said Harry Dutton,
alligator management section leader at the Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission in Tallahassee.</TE>
<TE>   This is the season when Hardwick can't count on a full night's
sleep. From Miami south to Key West, when a gator is designated a
threat, state officials call on the cheerful trapper from The
Redlands to remove it. Throughout Florida, there are 40 authorized
alligator trappers, who aren't paid by the state for their labors but
who get to keep the hides and meat of the animals they catch and
kill. (Hardwick makes a living by trapping other critters that invade
homes and yards.)</TE>
<TE>   "It's life-threatening work," Hardwick said. "If they grab you by
the thumb, they'll drag you into the lake or a canal, and it's all
over."</TE>
<TE>   Given the risks, the trapper has a surprising love and respect for
alligators. If there's a conflict between a gator and someone who has
just built a $500,000 home on wetlands that had been alligator
habitat, Hardwick said, his heart is with the reptile.</TE>
<TE>   "If it were up to me, the people would go and the gator would
stay," said Hardwick, who keeps a 6-footer named Wally at home for
talks to schoolchildren about how to coexist safely with alligators.</TE>
<TE>   One day last week, Hardwick aimed his pickup south to a fish farm
at Florida City, on the fringes of the Everglades. The 27-acre site,
where striped bass are raised, was being overrun by alligators that
had started chasing the workers.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't have gators eating my people," said John Hewitt, the
general manager.</TE>
<TE>   Employing the same large fishhooks used to catch sharks, Hardwick
threw out bait that gators seem to find delectable--rotten pig lungs
that float on the water's surface. The next morning, he returned to
find he'd hooked five gators--two 5-footers and three measuring from
8 to 9 feet each.</TE>
<TE>   Hardwick dragged each angry animal onto the bank with the
parachute cord connected to a hook, looped a wire snare around its
neck, then warily mounted it like a cowboy busting a bronco. Sitting
astride the gator, he secured its jaws shut with electrical tape and
trussed the legs so it couldn't move. Later, he'd drive to a
slaughterhouse, where the gators would be killed and butchered for
the meat and skins.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his feelings for the animals, Hardwick said the safety of
humans has to come first. "The gators' hormones are running rampant,
causing them to go looking for love in all the wrong places," he
said. "If we didn't do what we do, there'd be a lot of fatalities."</TE>
<TE>   Dutton said that, thanks to better education, Floridians are
becoming more tolerant of alligators and more willing to share the
environment with them. Hardwick is openly skeptical and believes the
state's continuing growth will ensure him work for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year, you have more people, more alligators and less
habitat," he said. "Sounds like a collision to me."</TE>

<HD>Missing Fla. Girl's Custodian Used Aliases, Records Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Doubts are mounting about the woman who says a child-welfare worker
took 5-year-old Rilya Wilson from her home last year and never
returned her.</LD>
<LD>   An Associated Press review of court records from past criminal and
civil cases involving Geralyn Graham shows that she has used at least
33 aliases and that lawyers in the past have questioned whether she
was a con artist or severely mentally impaired. A judge in one case
thought both might apply.</LD>
<LD>   "She has certainly presented herself in a way that defies knowing
her and understanding her," clinical psychologist James Butcher
concluded in December 2000 after reviewing a mental assessment test
taken by Graham in a lawsuit she had brought against a rental car
company.</LD>
<TE>   Rilya was sent to live with Graham, who claims to be her paternal
grandmother, and Graham's sister Pamela in April 2000. She stayed
with the sisters until January 2001 when, Geralyn Graham says, a
state child-welfare worker took Rilya away for evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   The girl was supposed to receive monthly state visits, but state
workers didn't report the child missing until April 25--15 months
after Graham says the child was taken from her.</TE>
<TE>   Kathleen Kearney, head of the Florida Department of Children &amp;
Families, has said the girl isn't anywhere in the state system.</TE>
<TE>   When DNA samples Friday ruled out that a body found in Missouri
was Rilya, Miami-Dade Police Director Carlos Alvarez disclosed that
the Graham sisters had each failed a polygraph test. He wouldn't say
what questions were asked or where the sisters showed deception.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody involved in this case is being investigated. Nobody is
immune," Alvarez said, answering questions of whether charges were
forthcoming.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Ed Shohat, who is representing the sisters for free,
criticized the disclosure and said police "had to find a way to turn
attention on someone else" to deflect concern they are no closer to
finding Rilya.</TE>
<TE>   Court records involving Geralyn Graham show others have questioned
her credibility, including her own sister.</TE>
<TE>   In a landlord-tenant dispute after Rilya's disappearance, Pamela
Graham sent a letter to the court saying she was Geralyn Graham's
guardian because her sister "now suffers from dementia" because of a
1996 van accident, the court records show.</TE>
<TE>   Geralyn Graham's memory was vague to nonexistent in a deposition
with Alamo Rent-A-Car in a personal-injury lawsuit stemming from that
1996 accident, in which Pamela Graham backed over her sister. Geralyn
Graham refused hospital treatment but later claimed debilitating head
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   In a January 2000 deposition in the case, Geralyn Graham said she
couldn't remember her street address but had it written down. She
didn't know her Social Security number because "somebody stole my
purse."</TE>
<TE>   A birth certificate found by Alamo indicates Geralyn Graham was
born Geraldine Thomas in Greenville, Miss., on Jan. 14, 1946. Alamo
also turned up an assortment of Social Security numbers and driver's
licenses, along with 15 aliases.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly scammers and criminals can be injured and are entitled to
damages from the party causing their injury," Geralyn Graham's
attorney Bambi Blum wrote in the Alamo suit in January 2001, the
month Rilya disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Albert Zbik, Geralyn Graham's psychologist, said she was "far too
uneducated and unsophisticated" to fake symptoms she didn't have.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't prove she's malingering," the judge in the case said,
citing "a 25-year documented history of a major mental health
problem" and no Alamo experts to discount her doctors.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Norman Gerstein has refused to dismiss the lawsuit, and it
has been on hold since Alamo filed for bankruptcy protection in
November.</TE>
<TE>   Shohat, the Grahams' attorney, said he doesn't believe Geralyn
Graham has dementia but that she suffers from severe arthritis pain.</TE>

<HD>Bush Gets Chance to Balance Books on Guns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whatever happened to President Bush's gun control agenda?</LD>
<LD>   No, that isn't a trick question, like whatever happened to
Madonna's sense of modesty.</LD>
<LD>   As a candidate in 2000, Bush offered a modest but tangible series
of gun control proposals meant to convince voters he'd strike a
reasonable balance between the interests of gun owners and the
demands of public safety. But in office, his administration has
focused almost entirely on gun owners' rights--most dramatically last
week when the Justice Department adopted an expansive interpretation
of the constitutional right to bear arms long sought by the National
Rifle Assn.</LD>
<TE>   If Bush really hopes to produce a balanced record, he'll need to
beef up his record on the public safety side of the ledger. As it
turns out, an upcoming legislative fight may offer him a chance to do
just that.</TE>
<TE>   Let's start with the history. Candidate Bush received guns-blazing
support from the NRA. But he was also determined to avoid the
impression he would religiously follow the NRA line. In his final
debate with Al Gore, a voter asked Bush about an NRA leader's boast
that the gun lobby would operate out of the Oval Office if Bush won.
Bush told him not to worry: "I'm a pretty independent thinker," he
insisted.</TE>
<TE>   No one was going to mistake Bush for a gun control crusader. He
shared the NRA's conviction the federal government should place its
priority on enforcing existing gun laws rather than passing new ones.
And he portrayed Gore's gun control proposals as excessive. "I
believe law-abiding citizens ought to be allowed to protect
themselves," Bush declared.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush also tried to reassure centrist voters uneasy about gun
violence. Bush renounced earlier Republican efforts to repeal the ban
on assault weapons President Clinton squeezed through Congress. And
he offered several new gun proposals of his own, many echoing
Clinton's ideas after the Columbine High School massacre in Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that we ought to keep guns out of the hands of people
that shouldn't have them," Bush said in that final debate with Gore.
"That's why I'm for instant background checks at gun shows; I'm for
trigger locks....I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles
can have a gun."</TE>
<TE>   Since the election, though, Bush hasn't been nearly as
enthusiastic about these ideas. He's moved forward on only one of
them. As a candidate, Bush promised to spend $75 million annually to
provide free trigger locks that could keep handguns from being used
by children; he's fulfilled that pledge in his first two budgets.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of Bush's gun control agenda, though, has been
conspicuous by its absence. He said he would support raising the age
for handgun ownership from 18 to 21. But he's offered no legislation
to do so. Likewise, he said manufacturers should be required to
install child safety locks on all new handguns, but he hasn't offered
a plan to do that either. Nor has he proposed a bill to close the
legal loophole that exempts purchasers at gun shows from the
background checks required on those who buy their hardware at gun
shops.</TE>
<TE>   Instead his administration has emphasized the priorities of gun
owner groups, led by the NRA. Today, the government maintains the
records of all background checks run through the national database of
gun purchases for 90 days, so it can audit the system for fraud or
irregularities. Gun groups consider that an invasion of privacy. The
Justice Department has now proposed to destroy the records after one
day.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft refused to allow the FBI to
use the database to check whether any of the 1,200 people detained
after Sept. 11 had bought guns. Then last week, Ashcroft aligned the
government more unequivocally than before with the NRA's
interpretation of the 2nd Amendment. In a filing to the Supreme
Court, the Justice Department broke from decades of federal policy to
declare that the amendment guarantees the right of gun ownership to
individuals and not just those engaged in military service (the
Revolutionary era "well-regulated militia" cited in the amendment).</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft insisted the Justice Department will continue to defend
the constitutionality of all existing federal gun control laws. But
critics fear he's given gun owner groups a powerful new legal club
against restrictions on gun ownership at the federal, state and local
level.</TE>
<TE>   Given the NRA's ferocious work for his election, it was inevitable
that Bush would respond to some of its priorities. But he also
promised he would maintain his independence from the group. Now, two
old rivals are offering the president an opportunity to prove he
meant it.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) signaled last week he'll soon force a
floor vote on legislation he's co-sponsored with Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.) to close the gun show loophole, which they say is
being exploited not only by criminals but also by suspected
terrorists. Bush insists he's for closing that loophole too, but only
if the background checks are conducted within 24 hours. The problem
is, that's like endorsing daily shuttles to Mars. No state now has
the computer capacity to research the background of gun buyers that
fast; the checks most likely to take longer are precisely for the
people we most want to keep away from guns.</TE>
<TE>   Many experts would accept 24-hour checks (which the NRA prefers)
as a reasonable goal, once they are practical. The question is what
to do in the interim. McCain's solution: For the next three years,
provide law enforcement three days to run the checks. After that,
states could petition the Justice Department to switch to an instant
check once they've demonstrated the capacity.</TE>
<TE>   The bill is landing in a cross-fire. The NRA hates the three-day
checks; the most ardent gun control groups oppose the eventual switch
to a 24-hour standard. But the proposal may be the only way to break
the logjam that has blocked action on the gun show loophole since
Columbine.</TE>
<TE>   It will also be a revealing test of Bush's intentions. He
routinely scolds Congress for stalling his priorities. Will he demand
that it send him a bill that closes the gun show loophole and then
work to fashion a compromise that can win a majority? Which is
another way of asking whether Bush was shooting straight in 2000 when
he told that voter, and a huge national audience, that he would
always think for himself about guns.</TE>

<HD>Resignation Over Admissions Policy Splits Seattle</HD>
<DH>Education: The principal decried a court's order to not use
race as a factor in who gets into his school.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Like most big-city school districts across the country, Seattle years
ago gave up on its mandatory cross-town busing program. But the city
never gave up on diversity as an ideal.</LD>
<LD>   Race remained an important--and often determining--factor in who
gets to go to the city's best schools.</LD>
<LD>   This year, 50 of the 367 freshmen at Ballard High--so popular that
it has 250 students on a waiting list--got there because they are
black, Asian, Latino or Native American. Ballard High has a 43%
minority enrollment in the middle of one of the whitest neighborhoods
in the city.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, a federal appeals court struck down the Seattle School
District's racial preference program. Ballard Principal David Engle
called an assembly and announced that he was resigning rather than
comply.</TE>
<TE>   Engle's decision has split this traditionally liberal city. Some
have applauded his commitment to ideals while others have accused him
of walking away from his responsibilities. Engle, 53, said he was
drawing on the example of Rosa Parks, the black woman who helped
inspire the civil rights movement by refusing to sit at the back of a
bus in segregated Alabama in 1955.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to demonstrate to you how to peacefully and lawfully act
on the courage of your convictions for the greater good," Engle told
his students, who first sat in stunned silence, then cheered. "It's
meant to change the moral, political and symbolic landscape of the
city. I can't do it alone."</TE>
<TE>   The court order, Engle predicted, would transform Ballard's
student body from "a rich, representative mosaic of Seattle's young
people to ... very monocultural."</TE>
<TE>   The problem in Seattle is one of geography and politics. Geography
because there are no high schools in the middle of the city, and
students who don't go to a school near home usually are in for a long
drive. Politics because Washington in 1998 passed a voter initiative
similar to California's Proposition 209, which bans racial
preferences in public employment, contracting and education.</TE>
<TE>   School administrators had figured they were immune from Initiative
200, which took aim at preferences that denied white students
admission to competitive programs, such as the University of
Washington Law School.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle schools, the district argued, shuffled students but
excluded no one from an education.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Harry Korrell, who represented the parents' group that
sued, said it isn't enough to say that all students get to go to
school.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess you'd have to ask Rosa Parks," Korrell said. "I mean,
everybody on that bus got to ride the bus, some people had to sit in
the back. We thought that constituted discrimination on the basis of
race."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say many students were shut out of good schools close to
their homes and diverted to inferior schools an hour or more away
because of their skin color.</TE>
<TE>   In the days since Engle's resignation, the discussion of race in
the city's schools has taken on an intensity that has long been
absent from the debate.</TE>
<TE>   Lauded, Vilified</TE>
<TE>   Over Decision</TE>
<TE>   Students have alternately hugged Engle in the halls and criticized
him for abandoning the school system when it needed him most. Parents
have written letters, some saying the schools were better off without
administrators pushing desegregation ("Good riddance," said one),
some applauding ("With the heroes of New York, you are a hero in
Seattle," wrote another).</TE>
<TE>   Teachers have talked of mounting a civil disobedience action to
skirt the district's enrollment process and invite minority students
turned away from Ballard directly into their classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Normally dispassionate school administrators are rallying behind
the principal.</TE>
<TE>   "They [the district] can take as bold a step as he's taking!" said
Colleen Walls, Ballard's soft-spoken vice principal. "Defy the
decision! What are they going to do? Put us all in jail?"</TE>
<TE>   Parents who won the victory in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals shrugged at Engle's resignation. "He's entitled to his
opinion, but we still believe that there will be diversity without
the racial tiebreaker," said Kathleen Brose, president of Parents
Involved in Community Schools, the group of about 60 parents who sued
the district.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few years ago, Ballard was among the grungiest facilities
in the district, with a crumbling building and poor academic record.
But Ballard now has a new campus and several new academic programs,
including specialized academies for maritime studies and
biotechnology, that make it the most sought-after high school in
Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Brose and several of her neighbors had hoped to send their
children to Ballard, the closest to their homes. In part because of
the racial tiebreaker, Brose's daughter was instead offered two other
schools. One didn't have an orchestra (her daughter plays cello), the
other required her to get on three different city buses for more than
an hour and a half just to get to school.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried everything. We tried logic, we tried reasoning, we tried
crying," Brose said. "I just felt like, this isn't fair."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle was the biggest city in the country to voluntarily adopt a
busing program to end segregation two decades ago; most other school
districts were forced into it by the courts.</TE>
<TE>   Tiebreaker System</TE>
<TE>   Poses a Problem</TE>
<TE>   An African American school superintendent, John Stanford, phased
out the last vestiges of the mandatory busing program in 1997 and
introduced a free-choice, market-based enrollment system for the
city's 10 high schools.</TE>
<TE>   Now, students can apply to any high school in town, and the high
schools offer programs to lure students and the state money that
comes with them.</TE>
<TE>   The problem comes when a school attracts more applicants than it
has room for. In that case, race is brought in as a tiebreaker. In
schools that are substantially outside the school district's overall
racial profile--60% minority and 40% white--students who help bring
the school back into racial balance get priority.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, there are three tiebreakers. Admitted first are students
who have a sibling at the school. Next are students who help bring
the school into racial balance. The remaining available spots are
given to applicants according to the proximity of their homes to the
school.</TE>
<TE>   Racial preference comes into play at three high schools in the
city: at Ballard and at Garfield, in the north, where minority
students get an edge, and at Franklin in the south, where white
students get priority.</TE>
<TE>   Racial preference is used at elementary and middle schools as
well, but students are assured of a spot in a school near their
homes. Overall, officials said 200 to 500 students this year were
assigned to a school on the basis of race.</TE>
<TE>   The district says the tiebreaker is not really a racial
preference. But the appeals court disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "While this may well be a reasonable policy choice by the school
district," Judge Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain wrote, "the citizens of
Washington have collectively decided that ... the price of that
diversity--that some students are told that they may not attend their
high school of choice simply because their skin is the wrong
color--is too high."</TE>
<TE>   The district has filed a petition for a rehearing. But the
decision echoes a number of court decisions in recent years that have
stepped away from the landmark court desegregation orders of the
1950s, '60s and '70s, and moved to sharply limit the instances in
which school districts can use such racial preferences.</TE>
<TE>   In California, Proposition 209 has outlawed some efforts such as
Seattle's, but not all. A federal judge in 2000 barred Pasadena from
using race, ethnicity and gender as factors in some school
assignments, but Beverly Hills decided it would not have to scrap its
voluntary recruitment program for minorities.</TE>
<TE>   Under the court's order, 52 minority students who would have been
admitted to Ballard next year now will have to go to schools nearer
their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Engle, who joined the Seattle district in 2000 from nearby
Bellevue, said he realized quickly that the response to the ruling
would likely be a demand from the community "to just hunker down and
make it work, David." It was an alternative that made him feel
increasingly uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   Quitting, he thought, might set an example for his students. He
discussed it with his wife, a fourth-grade teacher in another
district. They realized they probably would have to sell their home,
but both agreed that that would be part of the point.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, one of the biggest benefits to the kids has been seeing
adults make a hard decision and act on their values," Engle said. "To
do that, I had to have a hard landing ... a clean break."</TE>

<HD>In New York, Workfare Record Evokes Caution</HD>
<DH>Policy: As Congress takes up the issue, the city's
experience is under scrutiny.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- Three mornings a week, like thousands of others who pour
into the buildings clustered around City Hall, Francella Daniel
reports to work. She lifts bags out of trash cans, dusts offices and
cleans glass doors.</LD>
<LD>   But unlike most others who toil inside the aging municipal
building, Daniel, 52, is not a public employee. She is a welfare
recipient. The city of New York has ordered her to get "work
experience," and it pays her with a welfare check and food stamps.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't mind doing it," said Daniel, dressed neatly in blue jeans
and a red button-down shirt, during a recent work break inside a
locker room. "I'm doing a good job."</LD>
<TE>   Then she repeated the question that continues to confound welfare
recipients in a place once noted for its generous public assistance:
"What I don't understand is, if you're doing a good job at the
mandatory job, why can't you get hired? Why can't you get paid for
doing it?"</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to demanding community service in exchange for
welfare, no city has been tougher than New York. The idea is that
"simulated work experience" can provide a vital grounding in the
world of work: the values of being on time, dressing properly,
following orders and getting along with colleagues. The approach,
known as workfare, is also supposed to benefit the city in the form
of cleaner streets and better public service.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as Congress conducts its first major debate of welfare policy
in six years, New York is Exhibit A for those who would emphasize
work and for those who would stress education as the best way to help
poor people move up in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Required community labor may become more common throughout the
country under plans being pushed by the Bush administration and
congressional Republicans. In a major welfare bill that could pass
the House as early as this week, mandatory community service would be
among the few ways in which welfare recipients could satisfy stiffer
work requirements, short of getting a paid job.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say the nation cannot realistically steer a much
higher share of welfare cases into work, as the White House wants,
unless states can rely on such unpaid service to help fill the need.</TE>
<TE>   "Managing a large-scale welfare-to-work program is both practical
and necessary to achieving true welfare reform," said Jason A.
Turner, who has run the New York effort and ran Wisconsin's
pioneering program before that.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, conversations with participants in the program
and a range of experts who have studied it might provide caution for
those who would emulate New York's approach.</TE>
<TE>   City officials offer little evidence that mandatory community
service leads to lasting economic progress for those who provide it.
Critics have long complained that it can get in the way of more
valuable activities, such as education. Thousands of students on
welfare have left college in the last few years, for example, unable
to balance school and work demands.</TE>
<TE>   Critics are quick to note that, outside of Wisconsin and New York,
few places have set up large programs of mandatory work experience.
Washington state recently shut down its effort. In California,
participation is estimated at 4% of welfare recipients.</TE>
<TE>   New York has been gradually modifying its approach, increasingly
combining mandatory work experience with some other activity, such as
job search efforts or basic education. About 10% of adults are
engaged in mandatory service.</TE>
<TE>   "I see a light at the end of the tunnel for us," said Nancy
Biberman, president of Women's Housing and Economic Development
Corp., a nonprofit group that offers an array of support services for
low-income families in the South Bronx. "But it's depressing to hear
that the policies that have been so discredited in New York are being
promoted in Washington as a success."</TE>
<TE>   It was just a few years ago that New York embarked on the nation's
most ambitious effort to steer adult welfare recipients into work.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, then the mayor, recruited Turner from Wisconsin,
where he had engineered a similar strategy for Tommy G. Thompson,
then the governor and now secretary of Health and Human Services.</TE>
<TE>   Turner and other conservatives viewed a genuine private-sector job
as the ultimate goal for a person on aid. For those who were not
taking that step, the city created "work experience" slots and began
assigning aid recipients to city agencies and nonprofit groups.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of 1999, more than 35,500 New York City welfare
recipients were performing such tasks as peeling stickers off street
signs and picking up debris in Central Park.</TE>
<TE>   "Armies of welfare recipients were dispatched to sanitation and
parks department crews," recalled LynNell Hancock in "Hands to Work,"
her recent book about the New York experience. "[Welfare] workers
were required to follow work rules or risk losing their benefits. The
city would be cleaner. The poor would not necessarily be learning
marketable work skills. But they would be learning essential work
ethic values....</TE>
<TE>   "No other city in America had launched such an industrial-sized
workfare program so quickly."</TE>
<TE>   For the low-income people who made up the statistics, the initials
WEP--Work Experience Program--took on enormous significance, although
the intention of the required labor was not always clear.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't understand why we had to work for our benefits at the
time," recalled Deborah Primus, 49, a single mother who lives in
public housing in Harlem with five of her children. "As time went on,
we came to understand a little more."</TE>
<TE>   "You work hard," Primus continued. "You have to be on time like in
a regular job. The only thing I don't like about it is that they
don't hire you."</TE>
<TE>   Primus, who quit school after the 11th grade, has held a range of
low-skill jobs, most recently for the subway system, where she swept
steps, cleaned fare card machines and wiped turnstiles.</TE>
<TE>   But they have not led to paying jobs. Recently, she exhausted her
five-year lifetime limit on federal welfare benefits, which Congress
imposed in the 1996 welfare reform law. New York is still providing
aid while Primus ponders an uncertain future.</TE>
<TE>   The jobs are there, she maintained, "but there aren't jobs out
there for people like me who don't have a high school diploma."</TE>
<TE>   For Bush administration officials, mandatory work experience is
part of a strategy of helping engage much higher numbers of welfare
recipients in work-related activities. Even now, six years after
Congress agreed to toughen up the welfare system, 58% of adult
recipients nationally do not work.</TE>
<TE>   That little-known fact explains why the administration, which
seeks to have 7 out of 10 adult welfare recipients in some form of
work, is advocating much stiffer work rules.</TE>
<TE>   Before welfare reform, many people "expected you could sit and do
nothing and get benefits for the rest of your life," said Wade F.
Horn, assistant HHS secretary for children and families.</TE>
<TE>   But now, he said, the administration wants to push toward
"universal engagement," in which welfare recipients are involved in
efforts that can lead to as much self-sufficiency as possible. Work
experience, he said, can be part of that strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "When you talk to employers," Horn said, "they will tell you they
are not looking for people with ready-made skills specific to the
job. What they need are people that have the 'soft' skills--who know
it's important to get up every day and go to work on time. They know
how to dress and comport themselves. They know how to react to a
supervisor's suggestion to go on to another task."</TE>
<TE>   But when applied to the real world, the theory often leads to
conflict. Many welfare recipients refuse to perform the mandatory
work, instead accepting penalties that can lead to the loss of
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Welfare rights activists argue that a meaningful policy to help
poor people would address the deeper problems that disadvantaged
households often face, including illiteracy, poor health, domestic
violence, substance abuse and mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine how you would advise a desperately poor, unskilled and
unemployed person, Biberman said. "Would you say, 'Go sweep the
street three days a week'?"</TE>
<TE>   Young welfare recipients, she contended, "don't have families that
are really there for them if they're at the precipice and in danger
of falling off."</TE>
<TE>   Does work experience help reduce the danger? Every Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday, Yvonne Clement reports for duty at a Brooklyn
nursing home, where she helps out the elderly residents, some with
Alzheimer's disease. She reads them the newspaper. She asks whether
they know what day it is. She gets them ice. She helps them move to
music. She runs a weekly bingo game.</TE>
<TE>   "I give everyone a hug and a kiss," recalled Clement, 41, whose
eyes betray a lingering sadness behind a ready smile. "Everyone needs
it. It doesn't matter how old you are or who you are."</TE>
<TE>   Clement's formal education ended at 14, when her family left
London and returned to the West Indies. She got married a few years
later and moved with her husband to New York. They had two children.
The household struggled but survived. She worked at a series of
factory jobs: packing boxes, making sure the number of envelopes
matched the number of greeting cards, folding underwear and putting
it in plastic bags.</TE>
<TE>   Then in 1994, her marriage ended in divorce. About the same time,
she was laid off. One of her children had chronic health problems,
making it difficult for her to hold a steady job. She landed in
welfare and was initially excused from mandatory work because she
needed to tend to her son. His death last summer led to her current
assignment.</TE>
<TE>   Clement offers little complaint: "It's like therapy for me," she
said of the nursing home. "If I was home, I'd would still be thinking
about the death of my son."</TE>
<TE>   On Mondays and Tuesdays, she reports to a program of basic
education, in which welfare recipients are instructed in reading,
mathematics and other skills, including the use of business software.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as I get back on my feet I'll be getting off public
assistance," she said. "It's not something that I'm proud of. It's
not something that I ever saw happening to me."</TE>
<TE>   Not that the path is clear. Deborah Cain, an assistant director at
the nursing home, said Clement's work experience could be a
steppingstone toward jobs such as nurse assistant, which pays more
than $12 an hour at the facility, higher still for the night shift.</TE>
<TE>   But to become a nurse assistant, a job seeker must obtain a
license. And courses to pass the state licensing examination may cost
more than $600. Clement, however, has exhausted her savings.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, she's doing her hours for her public assistance," Cain
said. "She can't go to [nursing] school and fulfill her duty here."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Clement, many others have chosen to avoid the demands of
"simulated" work. City statistics show that in March, 26% of adults
deemed "engagable" for work were formally at odds with the city,
threatened with penalties for not following welfare rules.</TE>
<TE>   Is there a lesson for the nation? For all its determination to
push recipients into work, New York counts 41% of adults deemed
"engagable" to be working; the figure comes to about 59% with a
broader definition of activities that include education and substance
abuse rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   That remains lower than the 70% target of the White House.
Nonetheless, proponents of large-scale work experience efforts insist
that New York has shown that cities can steer a much larger share of
their welfare population into work than doubters ever expected.</TE>
<TE>   Francella Daniel, meanwhile, is thinking more about the view from
her municipal building than the big policy picture. Recent job
applications have come up empty. In particular, she is hoping for
good news from the city's transportation department, where she had
done clerical tasks as a welfare recipient.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just waiting for them to call me," she said.</TE>

<LD>A marble statue unearthed in Athens last month is the third known
masterpiece of an outstanding Greek sculptor who lived more than
2,500 years ago, archeologists said Friday. "This discovery is very
important, as we now have a new masterpiece by one very renowned
sculptor," Greek Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos told reporters.</LD>
<LD>   The statue--a figure of a Greek youth, or kouros--was carved in
the 6th or 7th century BC by the Sculptor of Dipylo, named after the
place where his first statue was found a century ago. His real name
is a mystery.</LD>

<LD>British scientists have mapped the genetic material of a common soil
bacterium in an achievement that could combat the growing problem of
"super-bugs"--bacteria resistant to the most powerful antibiotics.
The bacterium, Streptomyces coelicolor, and its relatives already
produce two-thirds of natural antibiotics such as tetracycline and
erythromycin.</LD>
<LD>   But researchers said the sequencing of its genome, announced in
the May 9 issue of Nature, could lead to novel types of antibiotics

<DL></DL>
<LD>Whales originated from land animals that looked like pigs, but
changes in their inner ear helped them evolve into acrobatic
swimmers, British scientists reported in the May 9 issue of Nature.
By studying fossils of whales, the team uncovered clues about the
evolution of cetaceans--whales, dolphins and porpoises--and how and
when they became such agile sea creatures.</LD>
<LD>   Whales left land permanently about 45 million years ago. Whales
and other cetaceans have a unique sense of balance because the
semicircular canals in their inner ears, which sense head movement,
are much smaller for their body size than those of other mammals.</LD>

<HD>Stranded Social Insects Usually Die Alone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: What happens to a social insect, such as a bee or ant, that
gets carried a long way from its colony?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: They generally die alone, according to entomologist P.
Kirk Visscher of UC Riverside. If a bee, for example, should stumble
across another colony, it will try to join it. Occasionally, the
colony will accept it, but most often they will kill the intruder.</LD>
<LD>   If the stranded insect is a pregnant female--a very rare case--it
might start a new colony. Usually, however, it takes a group of
insects to establish a colony, as when a foreign pest establishes an
infestation in the United States. The process is made somewhat easier
if new groups are brought in frequently, thereby providing genetic
diversity, Visscher added.</LD>

surprising repertoire of sounds is saying.</DH>

<LD>For the past 15 years, Dan Blumstein has been trying to get inside
the heads of marmots. This is not an easy thing to do, as some
marmots are total head cases.</LD>
<LD>   Blumstein is a professor of animal behavior ecology at UCLA, a job
that asks him to explain why various species act as they do. He's
also the world's reigning expert on marmot alarm calls.</LD>
<LD>   Though this may seem an odd line of research--it's not exactly
"Gorillas in the Mist"--Blumstein cites many reasons marmot alarm
calls are worth pondering. Perhaps the most important is an
overwhelming curiosity about how animals perceive the world. Or, to
put it another way, he really wants to know why a woodchuck chucks.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a privilege," he says, "to try to understand this stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Groundhogs, also known as woodchucks, are one of 14 species of
marmot. Classified as rodents, marmots are close relatives of prairie
dogs and ground squirrels. Most, but not all, live in the mountains.
They are cute and playful. A Mongolian or Russian may opine that they
are also delicious and make fine hats or wraps.</TE>
<TE>   Blumstein's first serious encounter with the creatures came on a
cycling trip in Asia in 1987, when he came across a colony of
long-tailed marmots in the mountains of northern Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   When predators such as foxes or golden eagles were present, the
marmots would sometimes issue alarm calls and then hide in their
burrows until danger passed.</TE>
<TE>   But what were the marmots saying with their whistle-like calls?
Were they shrieking in terror? Telling their mortal enemies to get
lost? Or screaming "fox" or "eagle" to other marmots?</TE>
<TE>   The question that really bothered Blumstein: Why would a marmot
risk alerting a predator to its whereabouts by whistling? Why not
quietly retreat to a burrow?</TE>
<TE>   Finding answers to those questions has required Blumstein to be
inventive. As part of an effort to better replicate natural threats,
for example, so he could tape-record marmot whistles, Blumstein built
a kite that resembled an eagle. Evil KnEagle, he called it.</TE>
<TE>   Explaining this in one scientific journal, Blumstein and Walter
Arnold wrote: "We attempted to launch the kite in such a way as to
make it suddenly appear over targeted marmots without the marmots
seeing the people flying the kite."</TE>
<TE>   Because the kite was sometimes unwieldy, he constructed
RoboBadger, a stuffed badger mounted on the chassis of a
radio-controlled car. Maneuvering the car through marmot colonies
often provoked calls--and proved science can be a great deal of fun.</TE>
<TE>   Back in his lab, Blumstein used a computer to analyze frequency,
tone and length of the chirps, yips, chucks and kee-aws that marmots
sounded.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have any indication marmots were saying 'eagle' or
'snow leopard' or 'wolf,'" he says. "But they were saying 'I'm
scared, I'm more scared, now I'm getting less scared.' So they could
communicate in some kind of dynamic way about risk."</TE>
<TE>   Blumstein also spent time studying the social behavior of
yellow-bellied marmots with a colleague, Ken Armitage, in the Rocky
Mountains near Crested Butte, Colo. Armitage, a University of Kansas
biologist, has carefully tracked this marmot colony every summer
since 1962--making it one of the longest continuing studies of a
mammal population.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the fundamental questions that has emerged from our work
is why do marmots decide to alarm call when they do," says Armitage.
"Because we know they don't always call when there are threats."</TE>
<TE>   When danger lurked, marmot mothers would sometimes whistle to warn
a daughter, but not an aunt, uncle or niece. There were other strange
behaviors. Mothers prevented daughters from reproducing. Infants were
killed. Permanent expulsions from the colony were common.</TE>
<TE>   In short, the colony of cute, fuzzy creatures resembled Peyton
Place more than Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   In papers written over the last decade (many with Armitage and
other researchers), Blumstein has focused on two key findings:</TE>
<TE>   In yellow-bellied marmots, whistles are often intended to protect
offspring. Besides good parenting, the whistles are an individual's
way to ensure that their genes dominate future generations.
Conversely, getting rid of genetic competition may be the reason
marmots do not whistle to a distant relative about to become coyote
chow.</TE>
<TE>   "The name of the game is maximizing the number of your genes in
future generations," says Blumstein. "Mathematically, it makes
perfect sense."</TE>
<TE>   His work also suggests that species of marmots with the most
socially complex colonies also have the most elaborate whistles. In
other words, the marmots that survive in a complex world may be the
ones that can communicate.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the study of evolution is understanding the different
ways species solve common problems," says Blumstein. "Everyone has to
eat, reproduce, sleep, hunt, protect their young. Some monkeys have
different calls referring to different species. Marmots don't have a
single word. That just goes to show there are different ways to solve
a problem."</TE>
<TE>   There is also a more practical side to his work, as understanding
how an animal behaves is often the key to conservation of a species.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Blumstein was summoned to Vancouver Island in British
Columbia, Canada. The Vancouver Island marmot was on the verge of
extinction. Only a few dozen remained in the wild, and a few dozen
more were soon to be taken into captivity.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was logging. In the 50 years after World War II, about
90% of the old-growth forests near the island's marmot colonies were
clear cut. To marmots and deer, the new clear cuts resembled meadows
and both species moved into this newly created habitat.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, deer numbers on the island soared. Predators, namely
mountain lions and wolves, learned that hanging out in the clear cuts
often meant an easy meal of venison--with a marmot appetizer.</TE>
<TE>   With the island's marmot population plummeting, Blumstein's
mission was to determine if there was some reason the island's
marmots, both in captivity and the wild, could no longer defend
themselves against predators.</TE>
<TE>   Blumstein brought in all his tools, RoboBadger included. In one
experiment, he walked up to wild marmots holding a garbage bag.
Blumstein would then rip off the bag to reveal a stuffed bobcat--an
animal not even present on the island. Still, the marmots whistled.</TE>
<TE>   The conclusion: Wild marmots were talented at recognizing
predators. The reason they fell prey so often was plain bad luck.</TE>
<TE>   Because the timber companies cut so much so quickly, many of the
old clear cuts are disappearing as the area's forests regrow.
Researchers believe that in coming decades this will result in fewer
deer, cougars and wolves and more marmots.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is, can we baby-sit the marmots for this period of
time while they recover?" says Andrew Bryant, chief scientist of the
island's Marmot Recovery Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in his UCLA office one spring day, Blumstein says
conservation is not simply a matter of setting aside enough land to
satisfy the needs of a particular species. Rather, it's ensuring that
animals such as marmots or wallabies--another species he has worked
with--have the behavioral tools they need to survive.</TE>
<TE>   On Vancouver Island, two marmots will be released into the wild in
late June. They'll join the 24 others that remain in the wild. This
pair may survive, they may not.</TE>
<TE>   But Blumstein and other researchers are confident of one thing: In
their quest to make it from Monday to Sunday and do it all over
again, these marmots will whistle while they work.</TE>

<LD>Particle physicists are depressed. So, too, are planetary scientists.
A recent string of science budgets streaming from Washington
threatens to defer their dreams of exploring both inner and outer
space.</LD>
<LD>   "So what?" you might ask.</LD>
<LD>   The research they do is admittedly speculative, esoteric,
impractical. It costs millions--sometimes billions--of dollars.
Dollars that are urgently needed for the government's wars on
terrorism, cancer, drugs.</LD>
<TE>   Who needs dreamers in a time of tangible terror? Far-out research
when so many down-to-Earth matters need attending?</TE>
<TE>   In the current climate, it's perhaps not surprising that missions
to Pluto and Jupiter's moon Europa have been put on hold. Even though
postponing the trip to Pluto means giving up a chance to visit the
last unexplored planet in our solar system for at least 100 years.
Even though strong evidence suggests that Europa holds an ocean under
its ice--making it a good bet to yield the first sign of
extraterrestrial life.</TE>
<TE>   It's also not unexpected that funding would be steadily reduced
for particle physics, that branch of science that unravels the
innards of atoms--the ultimate in navel gazing. In February, director
of the U.S. Office of Science and Technology Policy John
Marburger--former head of a particle physics lab himself--called the
frontiers of astronomy and particles both "remote hinterlands" that
were "no longer very relevant to human affairs."</TE>
<TE>   The folks at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia,
Ill., were aghast. "Remote hinterlands?" exclaimed Judy Jackson in
the in-house paper FermiNews. "[And] these words come from a friend
of particle physics."</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting Marburger's attitudes, the 2003 science budgets are all
about "missiles and medicine," as insiders call them--with huge
increases going to support research in the Department of Defense and
the National Institutes of Health.</TE>
<TE>   But here's the odd thing: It's the dreamers in their hinterlands
who often come up with the most practical inventions of all: those
most relevant to human affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Take that terrorist with the little black mustache who committed
genocide and came within an arm's reach of taking over the world not
so long ago. He might have won had he managed to develop his atomic
bomb. One reason he didn't was that nearly all the German and
Austrian "dreamers" had fled to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Just look at the physicists behind the U.S. atom bomb: They were a
bunch of fuzzy-headed, highfalutin intellectuals--engaged in
spectacularly impractical research.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Oppenheimer was a theorist who explored black holes. Albert
Einstein came up with the famous theory that showed you could get
energy from matter (E=mc2) while daydreaming about what it would be
like to ride along on a light beam.</TE>
<TE>   So much for missiles. What about medicine? One can't begrudge
funding medical research that ultimately helps everyone (well,
everyone who can afford to pay). But where do PET scans and magnetic
resonance imaging and laser surgery come from?</TE>
<TE>   You guessed it: dreamers! Magnetic resonance sprang right from the
innards of atoms, lasers from quantum mechanics; PET scans rely on
antimatter. No one had practical technology in mind when these
discoveries were made.</TE>
<TE>   It would be unfair to stop with fuzzy-headed physicists. There are
fuzzy-headed biologists doing the same sort of work. Tramping around
the jungles looking for new species no one will ever keep as pets or
use for food or carrying loads. Most of their discoveries are tiny
insects and obscure plants.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly often, these finds from the "remote hinterlands" of
biology lead directly to new medicines or new understanding of
disease.</TE>
<TE>   This particular lesson was brought home in a big way last week
when Japanese computer scientists left their U.S. counterparts in
their dust.</TE>
<TE>   According to the New York Times, the Japanese have produced a
computer more powerful than the 20 fastest U.S. computers combined.
They developed it while trying to understand climate change, modeling
weather and earthquakes and global warming.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, meanwhile, has been developing computer power
primarily to model weapons. And look what happened.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are blowing us out of the water," one U.S. scientist
said. Another called the situation "Computenik"--referring to the
astonished American response when the Soviets launched Sputnik in
1957. Back then, tremendous resources were suddenly poured into
science education. Not this time. Instead, millions of dollars
previously earmarked for math and science education have recently
been stripped from a federal education bill.</TE>
<TE>   It is part of our Puritan ethic that work should have a clear
purpose. Journeys should have destinations, efforts clear ends.
There's no room for leisurely wandering, pointless wondering: What
would happen if ... ? What's out there? In here?</TE>
<TE>   Alas, this ethic simply does not serve science, where seemingly
aimless exploration is often the most fruitful of all.</TE>
<TE>   Puritan ethic or no, there's nothing idle about scientific
curiosity.</TE>
