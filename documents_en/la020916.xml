<HD>Maybe Your Genes Let Fungus Hammer Your Nails</HD>

<LD>Those thousands of genes we tote in our genomes poke their noses into
everything from our hair color to our risk for heart disease--they
even have something to say about whether we'll let fungi feed and
thrive under our toenails.</LD>
<LD>   The critters causing toenail fungus aren't rare. They're the same
little brutes that cause athlete's foot, and damp showers can be
positively swimming with them. Yet the fungi in question--from a
group called "dermatophytes," or "skin plants"--invade some people's
toes and not others'. A study of French families with toenail fungus
revealed that when one spouse had the fungus, the other spouse didn't
catch it after 18 to 60 years of living, showering and sleeping
together.</LD>
<LD>   "If you're a person who's not going to get it, you're not going to
get it--you could walk through a field of it," says Dr. Monica Lawry,
a Sacramento nail specialist.</LD>
<TE>   Yet in the French study, about half of these people's kids went on
to get infections--rather as if susceptibility to the condition was
being handed down as a one-gene, dominant trait. It is unlikely that
there will be a rush to confirm this one-gene business and track down
the DNA involved. Toenail fungus, after all, is hardly
life-threatening.</TE>
<TE>   "It feeds on the skin; it doesn't go into the bloodstream, doesn't
spread to other parts of the body," says Dr. Richard Scher, nail
specialist and professor of dermatology at Columbia University. "It
does not attack the liver, for example, or the brain."</TE>
<TE>   Yet for the estimated 2% to 18% of the population afflicted with
it, there's no doubt it can be distressing--causing yellowing,
thickness and flakiness of the nail area and making the nails lift
away from the nail bed. Plus, having the fungus can hurt a lot if
someone stomps on an infected toe.</TE>
<TE>   And, once there, it's not like a wart that might one day decide to
disappear. Toenail fungus stays put for good unless stern steps are
taken to eradicate it.</TE>
<TE>   Happily, genes aren't the whole story--giving the potential host a
modicum of control.</TE>
<TE>   The fungus needs opportunity. Trauma to the nail allows the fungus
to gain entry, which is why athletes--who spend a lot of time leaping
about bashing their nails against the ends of their shoes--are more
likely to end up with infections. (Be nice to your nails.)</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, to get the fungus, you have to be exposed to it.
Toenail fungi like damp, moist places such as swimming pools and
health club showers and the deep, dank depths of sweaty sneakers.
(Avoid walking barefoot in such places, control perspiration, and
toss out ancient, infested footwear.)</TE>
<TE>   What's more, if the fungi are permitted to take up residence in
patches of athlete's foot, they will make their move when nail trauma
strikes and send their long, spaghetti-like filaments into the
toenail area. (Treat your athlete's foot.)</TE>
<TE>   The likes and dislike of the fungus explain what has often
mystified us--why one hears lots about toenail fungus but precious
little about fingernail fungus. Fingernails get less of both trauma
and dampness. Still, people who are really prone to the fungus and
traumatize their fingers (during basketball or tennis, for instance)
can get the finger variety too.</TE>
<TE>   During a nail infection, the fungus burrows deep, invading both
the nail bed and nail matrix (the tissue that makes the nail). Thus,
while topical drugs will help in light cases, a well-developed
infection won't respond. (Nor, says Scher, will it react much to
dousing the nail in Clorox or vinegar.) You have to swallow
anti-fungal drugs so they can make their way through the bloodstream
to those tissues.</TE>
<TE>   It can take four months to a year to grow the toenails back--and
(here's the kicker) once you stop taking the medications, the growth
can come back again if you're not squeaky-clean careful about
avoiding exposure to the fungus.</TE>
<TE>   Since other things can cause nails to alter their appearance,
Scher and Lawry emphasize that it's important to get samples analyzed
for actual presence of the fungus. Lawry once had a patient come to
her with a "fingernail fungus" problem for which he'd been treated
for some time: "It was totally the wrong diagnosis, and there was no
way it'd ever respond to anti-fungals," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Stained with dyes, safely under the microscope, the fungus appears
as long, colored strands--almost festive-looking. It's hard to
imagine it could make such a mess of a nail.</TE>
<TE>   But then, Ebola's pretty cute-looking too.</TE>

<HD>Work Up to Better Health</HD>
<DH>Exercise: Researchers say an hour of daily physical
activity can help stave off major diseases. Finding those 60 minutes
isn't as hard as it may seem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sixty minutes of moderate exercise every day? That latest health
recommendation is enough to send the average office worker dashing to
the danish cart in despair.</LD>
<LD>   It's hard enough getting the 30 minutes of daily exercise that the
U.S. surgeon general has advised as a hedge against heart disease,
high blood pressure, diabetes and cancer. But the whole hour recently
recommended by the Institute of Medicine may seem almost impossible.</LD>
<LD>   Don't give up, psychologists and exercise experts say. The
recommendation from the influential federal agency is not as rigid as
it may seem. It's a guideline intended not only to keep your organs
in good working order, but help you burn enough calories to reach and
maintain a healthy, stable weight. (It was based on studies of how
much energy people with healthy body weights took in and used up.)</LD>
<TE>   The authors of the recent report stressed that not all of the hour
has to be done at the same time. Some of the cumulative 60 minutes of
activity can be reached through routine activities, such as taking
stairs instead of elevators or doing some housework.</TE>
<TE>   But it's probably not practical to rely entirely on such pursuits.</TE>
<TE>   Becoming more active can start with plain old walking. Other than
sturdy shoes and maybe sunglasses, no special equipment is needed.</TE>
<TE>   Yet unlike, say, New Yorkers, who walk almost everywhere, Los
Angeles residents labor under the added pressure of living in a city
in which cars are the primary mode of transportation. "We're glued to
our automobiles and to the highway system. We spend a lot of time
sitting at our jobs," said Steve Hooker, an exercise physiologist in
the state health department. But, he adds, "everyone has the same
amount of time," and it comes down to priorities.</TE>
<TE>   You needn't start at full throttle. Finding that first half-hour
is a good foundation upon which you can build.</TE>
<TE>   "People need to understand that they can still get good health
benefits from trying to get out there at least 30 minutes most days
of the week," said Abby King, senior investigator at the Stanford
Center for Research in Disease Prevention in Palo Alto. "There's
nothing magic about an hour a day. If you're not hitting an hour but
you're increasing activity levels, you're going to benefit."</TE>
<TE>   You might try two 15-minute walks, at lunch and during a coffee
break, then taking the family for a half-hour evening walk, or
signing up for an evening exercise class. You might walk the dog,
play with your kids (instead of just watching them) or make a couple
of loops around the field during soccer practice.</TE>
<TE>   Become mindful about moments when you could be more active. In one
study, Stanford researchers found that people have "dead times during
the day that aren't valued," like when they watch a television
program they don't particularly enjoy, King said. Study subjects
learned to get off the couch and take walks.</TE>
<TE>   It's important to note that the expert panel recommended 60
minutes of "moderately brisk" activity, which doesn't mean
window-shopping on your lunch hour. It means picking up the pace,
from an amble to more of a gambol. The study authors recommend a
"moderately brisk pace," defined as 4 mph.</TE>
<TE>   How can you tell if you're pushing yourself hard enough? "You're
breathing harder, and your heart rate is higher and you sweat more,"
King said.</TE>
<TE>   Swimming long, slow laps of the breast stroke isn't really going
to get your heart pumping. But pick up the pace with a purposeful
freestyle and you're there. Of course, you can ratchet up the pace
further--and even reduce the duration--by engaging in high-intensity
bicycling, running, or jogging for 30 minutes four to seven days a
week. A good game of basketball, singles tennis or other racquet
sport also could get you to the goal activity level in under an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Think too about what you're doing over a week's time. You've got
more leeway than you might imagine. You might do half an hour of
walking one day and nothing the next, then make up for it with a
90-minute dance class or golf game the following day, King said.</TE>
<TE>   King conceded that while walking opens the door to exercise for
many people, "if someone is serious about weight loss and weight
maintenance, they may very well need to go spend an hour in the gym,
not every day, but at least two to three times a week."</TE>
<TE>   However, if you're an older adult or someone unused to exercise,
start modestly, perhaps with just 10 minutes of exercise, and set
your goal at "eventually reaching the recommendation," Hooker said.</TE>
<TE>   And what about folks in physical professions, such as restaurant
workers who spend all day putting miles on those gum-soled shoes--are
they off the hook? Although all that darting between tables may
control the weight, moderate-intensity exercise is needed to reap
cardiac and other benefits, King said. "There are relatively few jobs
in the U.S. where you are getting enough activity," King said.</TE>
<TE>   It's time, then, that we all thought about encouraging employers
and local institutions to help us be more active, King said. "Work
sites can do something in terms of giving people lunch hours and
breaks and give people a place to walk. [It's] the community's
responsibility to make sure there's lights in your neighborhood and
sidewalks are safe."</TE>
<TE>   One way to help the reluctant exerciser is through social support
to reinforce new habits. That can come from Weight Watchers-like
groups that bring people together to share tips on overcoming
exercise obstacles. Among them is Active Living Every Day, which
teaches sedentary people how to maintain physical activity for a
lifetime. Created by the Cooper Institute, a nonprofit preventive
medicine, education and research center in Dallas, the course is
available in book form, is offered at some community centers and has
a support component available through the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Support can also come from mall-walking groups, neighborhood
walking clubs, online personal training services, or automated
computerized systems that respond to you with a human voice. To keep
up the new exercise habits, King said, "people will need to be
creative."</TE>

<HD>Vision of the Future</HD>
<DH>As research becomes reality, artificial sight is the</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jens was a 17-year-old nailing down railroad ties when a splinter
broke off and punctured his left retina, blinding him in that eye.
Three years later, while he was fixing a snowmobile, a splinter of
metal broke off from the clutch, destroying his other eye.</LD>
<LD>   Now 39, Jens lives in rural Canada, where he splits and sells
firewood, sometimes loading as much as 12,000 pounds a day. He and
his wife have eight children, and when he is not working in the
forests, he programs computers, tunes pianos and gives an occasional
concert.</LD>
<LD>   But he wanted to see again so badly that Jens--he prefers not to
have his last name known--recently paid an estimated $115,000 to have
surgeons in Portugal drill a hole in his skull and place an array of
electrodes on the surface of his brain. The electrodes are connected
to a miniature television camera and a sophisticated computer that,
together, have given Jens a rudimentary form of vision.</LD>
<TE>   This summer he demonstrated his new sight at a New York meeting by
navigating through rooms, finding doors and even driving a car
briefly around a parking lot, avoiding a trash bin and other
obstacles placed in his path.</TE>
<TE>   "This is pretty crude vision right now, if you want to compare it
to what I had before," Jens said. "But fortunately, there is a good
improvement compared to being blind totally."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have been struggling for more than two decades to
produce some kind of artificial vision for the blind, and they are
now on the right track. For now, Jens is one of only a handful of
people who have received newly developed treatments to restore
vision, and few experts expect the number of recipients to grow
rapidly any time soon. But the fact that anyone has been treated at
all represents a major technological breakthrough.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting that newfound optimism, nearly a dozen labs throughout
the world are racing furiously toward a common goal--bypassing
damaged components of the visual system to restore sight. Some are
developing artificial retinas, some are using electrodes to stimulate
neural pathways in the eye, and still others are trying to stimulate
the brain directly. Few, however, have done much in humans--yet.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still at a very primitive stage, in the sense of how much
work will be required to ... produce enough vision for mobility,"
said Dr. William Heetderks of the National Institutes of Health.
"It's very easy to underestimate the technical problems involved."
Although the prosthesis used by Jens is now being marketed to
consumers, experts predict that it will be a decade before other
devices see much use.</TE>
<TE>   The need for technological breakthroughs has never been greater.
According to a recent report from the National Eye Institute, more
than 1 million Americans over 40 are blind, and an additional 2.4
million are visually impaired as a result of diabetic retinopathy,
age-related macular degeneration, cataracts or glaucoma.</TE>
<TE>   Those numbers are expected to double over the next 30 years as the
baby-boom generation ages. New drugs and other therapies are delaying
the onset of blindness for many victims, but once blindness sets in,
there has traditionally been nothing more that could be done.</TE>
<TE>   Now that situation is changing, as is illustrated by work in three
labs that seem to be ahead of the field.</TE>
<TE>   Miniature Electrode Array</TE>
<TE>   At USC's Doheny Retina Institute, Dr. Mark Humayun and Dr. Eugene
de Juan Jr. have developed a miniature electrode array that can be
implanted in the eye to replace a damaged retina. The array is
attached by thin wires buried under the skin to a radio receiver that
is implanted behind the ear.</TE>
<TE>   Visual signals from a video camera are processed through a
microcomputer worn on a belt, then transmitted to the receiver. The
retinal array stimulates optical nerves, which then carry a signal to
the brain. The signal is perceived as phosphenes, bright points of
light. With correct stimulation, patterns of phosphenes can draw a
picture in the mind similar to that seen on a stadium scoreboard,
where letters and pictures are produced by arrays of individual
lightbulbs.</TE>
<TE>   The preliminary results have been "encouraging," Humayun said.
"The brain can make a lot of sense out of crude inputs."</TE>
<TE>   The team has implanted the devices temporarily in 17 patients to
date. When they used as few as four electrodes, De Juan said,
patients could tell if an object was in front of them, moving from
left to right or vice-versa, and so forth. With a four-by-four array
of 16 electrodes, patients can see shapes and outlines and pour a
liquid from one cup to another.</TE>
<TE>   "To read, we may need 1,000 electrodes," Humayun said.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the USC researchers performed the first permanent
implant of a four-by-four electrode array in a patient, and they plan
to do a total of three this year. The device is manufactured by
Second Sight LLC of Valencia. Sandia Laboratories is developing
second-generation versions of the devices.</TE>
<TE>   The first patient "is doing much better than the patients with the
short-term implants--far better than we expected," Humayun said. The
brain, he added, is constantly learning how to interpret the visual
signal. "It meets us halfway."</TE>
<TE>   If the first three implants are successful, De Juan and Humayun
have permission from the Food and Drug Administration to implant
another seven. But completing the test will take a long time, Humayun
cautions, because "it's a Class III device--the highest-risk device
according to the FDA. That's because it's an implant that will be
left in for the rest of the person's life."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, De Juan said, they would like to shrink the device so
that everything would fit into the eyeball. Similar technology is
being developed at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston
and at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium.</TE>
<TE>   Tiny Artificial Retina</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Alan Chow of the University of Illinois at Chicago Medical
Center has produced a completely implantable artificial retina, but
there are substantial questions about how well it works. Chow and his
brother Vincent, president of Optobionics Corp. of Wheaton, Ill.,
have developed a silicon chip that is 2 millimeters in
diameter--smaller than the head of a pin--and half the thickness of a
sheet of paper.</TE>
<TE>   The chip contains about 5,000 small solar cells, each attached to
a miniature electrode on the back of the chip. The idea is that light
falling on the chip will activate the electrodes, stimulating the
optical nerves behind the retina. Most critics, such as Heetderks, do
not think the solar cells can generate sufficient electrical power to
activate the nerves.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Chow has implanted the devices in six patients. "All
of the patients have improved visual function, sometimes quite
dramatic," Chow said.</TE>
<TE>   One patient, for example, had no light perception previously but
"can now see people standing in front of her." Another patient, "who
could read no letters on an eye chart, is now reading about 25"
letters on the chart.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pretty excited," he added. "We hope these improvements
persist."</TE>
<TE>   But Chow concedes that the implant may not be working the way it
was designed to. Retina cells that are physically separated from the
implant "seem to have improved in function in all the patients," he
said. That suggests that the surgery may have triggered the release
of a growth factor or some other chemical in the eye that led to
regeneration of retinal cells.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever is happening, Chow plans to implant four more of the
devices and monitor the progress of all 10 recipients. "If [the
implants] seem to be consistently effective and safe, the study will
be expanded to an undetermined number of patients."</TE>
<TE>   A significant number of the blind, like Jens, have badly damaged
optic nerves, however. For them, a simple retinal implant will be of
no benefit, and a more invasive procedure is required.</TE>
<TE>   Skull Implants</TE>
<TE>   Electrical engineer William H. Dobelle of the Dobelle Institute in
Commack, N.Y., has been attempting to produce such a device for
nearly three decades. He has developed a thin array, containing 64
electrodes, that is implanted inside the skull on the surface of the
occipital lobe of the brain. There the electrodes directly stimulate
the visual cortex. The device is connected to an electrical socket
that passes through the skull and skin.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the skull, the device is similar to the retinal
stimulators, with a television camera mounted on glasses and a small
computer to process the signal. This is the device that Jens wears.</TE>
<TE>   Dobelle's team has now implanted the devices in eight patients
from six countries. One patient, blind from birth in one eye, lost
the other at age 45. Another, who was 77 at the time of the surgery,
lost both eyes in a mortar attack during World War II. For some of
the patients, insurance covered all or part of the cost of the
procedure; others paid the full $115,000 themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Because of U.S. Food and Drug Administration restrictions on
implanting medical devices in the brain, the surgical procedures were
performed at the University of Lisbon Medical School in Portugal.
Arrays were planted on each side of the brain.</TE>
<TE>   The implants produced "excellent displays of phosphenes" in all
eight of the patients, Dobelle told the New York meeting of the
American Society for Artificial Internal Organs, and four of them
reported that the phosphenes were brilliantly colored. The devices
are primarily designed for mobility rather than reading, Dobelle
said. But "rapid advances provide the possibility that the patients
will be able to scan the Internet and watch television," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Implanting the arrays on the brain's surface creates many
problems, however.</TE>
<TE>   A moderately high voltage is required to stimulate the target
cells inside the brain, and it is not possible to stimulate small
groups of cells specifically. The voltages applied could, in some
cases, provoke epileptic seizures.</TE>
<TE>   The National Institutes of Health has thus been sponsoring studies
by researchers such as Dr. Richard Normann of the University of Utah
and Dr. Phil Troyk of the Illinois Institute of Technology in which
the electrode arrays will be implanted in the interior of the brain,
directly in contact with the cells to be stimulated.</TE>
<TE>   One key difference is that the voltages required to stimulate the
cells will be reduced by a factor of hundreds to thousands. "As a
rule of thumb, when something changes by a factor of 10, you are in a
different ballpark, and here we are talking about hundreds or
thousands," said NIH's Heetderks.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to put in structures that are comparable in size to
neurons," Normann said. "And the materials themselves have to be
regarded by the brain as not overtly hostile. It's a challenging
problem," but when they succeed, surgeons will have a tool that can
be used to treat not only blindness but also deafness, incontinence,
spinal injuries and other problems, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers in all these areas still have a long way to go, but
the progress is heartening. In the long run, many researchers believe
that electrodes implanted deep within the brain will provide the best
results, but the other alternatives may provide benefits to blind
people who cannot wait that long.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that I am safe in saying that Braille, the long cane
and the guide dog are doomed to obsolescence," Dobelle said. "By the
end of this century, they will be as obsolete as the airplane made
the steamship."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When my 63-year-old aunt invited family members to join her in the La
Jolla Rough Water Swim in early September, I immediately dismissed
the idea as lunatic. She and her husband--who founded the Ironman
Triathlon in 1978--are bionic adventurers who spend their free time
sailing the world, biking in exotic places and running inhuman
distances.</LD>
<LD>   I, on the other hand, had let my fitness regimen slip and hadn't
swum regularly all summer. But the invitation was a gauntlet thrown
down, so I decided to go for it. After initially trying to dissuade
me, my husband, who has probably never swum more than half a mile in
a pool, decided he would try it too. (To go all the way to La Jolla
and not swim would be pretty lame, he said.)</LD>
<LD>   So on a recent Sunday we found ourselves on the edge of a cliff at
La Jolla Cove, clutching our goggles, staring out at a distant
collection of buoys and balloons that marked our course and wondering
if we were out of our minds.</LD>
<TE>   Known affectionately as "The Big Wet One," the La Jolla Rough
Water Swim is one of the oldest open-water swimming events in the
country. The first La Jolla ocean race was held in 1916, as part of
the World's Fair in San Diego. Seven men swam 1.7 miles from the
Scripps Institute's Biological Pier south to La Jolla Cove that cold
summer day. Over the next 86 years, the event's sponsorship changed,
the course altered and the number of participants grew.</TE>
<TE>   Today the La Jolla Rough Water Swim is one of 19 events sponsored
by Southern California Aquatics, the largest adult swimming club in
the United States. With race distances ranging from a half-mile to 10
miles, the events, known as the 2002 Southern California Open Water
Swim Series, take place over four summer months. Swims are held from
as far north as Avila Beach, above Santa Barbara, to as far south as
Coronado. The final swim of the series, the Catalina Clearwater
Classic, will take place Sept. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers estimate that more than 2,000 people participated in
this year's La Jolla races, including 550 men and 305 women in the
respective one-mile masters' races and 419 people in the three-mile
Gator Man.</TE>
<TE>   At the registration booth, my husband and I stripped to our suits,
and volunteers scrawled numbers on our shoulders with black markers.
I strapped on my heart-rate monitor but later found it didn't
function in salt water.</TE>
<TE>   A bystander at the railing above the beach showed us the course.
Our event, the one-mile, was a triangle. From the small cove,
competitors would swim east to a buoy half a mile out, head
one-quarter mile west to the second buoy, then back to the beach,
where a strobe light flashed from the cliff to guide us home.</TE>
<TE>   Hearing that we were first-timers, the man offered tips. Get your
bearings, he advised. You won't be able to see the buoys from the
water, so aim for the red roof across the bay. Don't be frightened if
you get tangled in the kelp; just keep your arms close to your body
and float above it. Grab it and pull if you have to. And ride the
waves in at the end, he said. They look small from up here, but they
are actually so strong that when you are tired, they can pull you
backward. Finally, he said, don't stop swimming until your fingers
hit the sandy bottom. Then, and only then, should you run for the
finish.</TE>
<TE>   Several minutes before 11 a.m., they called the women's masters
(in this race, anyone over 19). I was in the first heat, with all
women younger than 39.</TE>
<TE>   We lined up on the stairs leading down to the cove until the
loudspeaker called us onto the beach. We scampered across the sand
and lined up in the surf. The real competitors pushed to the front. I
tried to stay near the back.</TE>
<TE>   The waves were bigger down here. They looked as if they would take
out the table of Gatorade cups and knock down the front-line
swimmers. At sea level, the first buoy was a lot harder to see.</TE>
<TE>   I had butterflies in my stomach.</TE>
<TE>   A La Jolla councilman raised the starting gun into the air. Bang!
And we were off.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of women surged into the waves. We dived into the surf
and onto one another like seals. The land world receded as I
submerged into a sea of white bubbles. All I could hear was the
thrashing of a thousand limbs. I focused on not getting kicked in the
head.</TE>
<TE>   We headed out to sea like a drunken school of fish. I could feel
us careening off course to the right, but with swimmers on every
side, resistance was futile. I lifted my head to try to see the buoy,
the red roof. Nothing. I put down my head and went with the flow.</TE>
<TE>   I tried to get into a rhythm, to not think about how far I had to
go. I could see the swirl of seaweed below in the blue-green depths,
and blurry patches of sand and rock.</TE>
<TE>   By the time I rounded the first buoy, we were spread out. I
flipped onto my back and did a few strokes to catch my breath. The
swells got bigger, obscuring the column of balloons that was meant to
be our marker. Lifeguards floated nearby on paddleboards, nudging us
back on course if we went too far astray. I swallowed a few gulps of
salt water and zigzagged erratically. I was beginning to understand
why an ocean mile is almost always more than a pool mile. This was
not like following the black stripe on the bottom of the Y pool.</TE>
<TE>   As we rounded the second buoy, I got tangled in a bed of kelp.
Trying not to panic as it wrapped its cords around my legs, I
remembered the words of our friend on the cliff and managed to glide
over the top of it like a fish.</TE>
<TE>   I was in the home stretch. I swam and swam for the arch of
balloons. I swam until my fingers scraped the bottom. Then, like an
amphibious creature that has forgotten how to use its legs, I
stumbled out of the water to the finish.</TE>
<TE>   I'd done it!</TE>
<TE>   My skin tingled and I felt great. I'd finished in 34 minutes, but
the time didn't matter. My aunt, who took off in a later heat, came
in right behind me.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Osborn, spokeswoman for the Southern California Series and an
experienced open-water swimmer, said that for many people, the
transfer from pool to ocean can be exhilarating.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people freak out about the ocean," she said, "about
seeing fish, getting tangled in the kelp. But turn that around and
it's an adventure. You have currents to work around ... it's a
challenge. It's almost like creating a whole new sport."</TE>
<TE>   She said some master swimmers like the ocean water swims because
they feel less competitive than a swim meet. "In the open water, no
one is watching," she said. "You can slow down, do breaststroke, pop
over on your back. People see you come in at the finish, but they
have no idea what happened out there."</TE>
<TE>   I had barely ascended the stairs when my husband was called down
to the beach. If he was nervous, he didn't show it. He stood in the
pack--goggles on, cap pulled down--as if he had done this a million
times. I watched until his head was just a bobbing red speck on the
horizon. Later he told me he just prayed he wouldn't have to climb on
a lifeguard's paddleboard and be brought back to shore with thousands
of people watching.</TE>
<TE>   Finally I saw him head into the cove and ride a wave into shore.
He had swum farther than he ever had in his life and was almost as
thrilled with himself as I was.</TE>
<TE>   It felt like the ultimate Southern California experience, to swim
like that in the sea. It reminded me of how rich and alive the world
can look when you get out of your car, taking in smells, sounds and
textures that you miss when the world flows by like a movie outside
your air-conditioned vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   With the chill of salt water against my skin, the drag of seaweed
on my wrists and ankles, and cormorants staring down from the rocks
as I glided by--how different it is, I thought, to get off the land
and swim like a sea creature.</TE>

<LD>When Sandra Ray-Baucom discovered a lump in the testicle of her
2-year-old son, Jeramy, doctors recommended immediate surgery. The
lump was caused by a fast-growing hernia and could rupture, they
said, causing serious internal damage, even death.</LD>
<LD>   But the family was uninsured. Childrens Hospital Los Angeles,
where she was referred, asked for a $4,000 payment upfront before it
would schedule the operation. Without the money, a hospital official
told her, she could wait until the hernia ruptured; at that point,
the operation would qualify as an emergency and the family could pay
later. But waiting seemed to be a gamble with her son's life.</LD>
<LD>   Then Ray-Baucom saw an Internet ad for a card that provided
discounts on medical services--for only $49.95 a month. She took the
offer. Childrens Hospital accepted the card, and her son's surgery
was successful. Only then did she learn the ins and outs of health
savings cards, a product that is being sold all over California and
the rest of the country as a solution for the uninsured.</LD>
<TE>   The various cards, offered by companies such as Family Care, Care
Entree and Chamber Health, work essentially the same way. For a
typical $600 or $700 annual membership fee, consumers get discounts
from a range of health-care providers, including doctors, hospitals,
dentists and pharmacies. The companies get discounts by contracting
with preferred provider networks, sometimes the same ones that big
managed care firms use. Care Entree, for example, contracts with
Private Healthcare Systems, the largest PPO network in the country.</TE>
<TE>   To receive the discounts, members simply present cards resembling
those offered by insurance companies. The bills then go to the card
companies, which re-price the bills and tell members what they must
pay.</TE>
<TE>   "The savings vary depending on how high the doctor prices his
services to uninsured patients," says Mike Collins, a former vice
president at Care Entree. (Uninsured patients typically pay higher
prices than those dictated by managed care firms.)</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, discount cards appeal to people who cannot afford the
$2,000 annual premium for individual health coverage or the $6,000
premium for family coverage that many insurance companies charge. And
this segment of the population is growing.</TE>
<TE>   A Kaiser Family Foundation survey found earlier this year that 45%
of employers with three to nine workers do not offer health insurance
benefits, up 3 percentage points from last year. That jump alone
means that 150,000 more people are now without medical coverage.
Companies marketing health savings cards say their memberships are
also growing--reflecting the greater number of people who are
uninsured. Family Care is adding 2,000 to 3,000 new members each
month compared with 500 to 600 a month last year, according to
president Mike Rabie.</TE>
<TE>   "It's affordable," says Renee Loterina, a Care Entree
representative. "Some people can't afford Blue Cross or Blue Shield,
but they can afford $54.95 a month." Indeed, some companies market to
small employers that can't afford to buy real health coverage for
their workers, such as the one that employs Ray-Baucom's husband. The
idea of a discount also seems fair. If Health Net and Pacificare get
discounts for members who join their PPOs, why shouldn't the
uninsured get discounts as well?</TE>
<TE>   But just because a card is affordable--and the idea of discounted
services appealing--doesn't mean the bill disappears. The cards are
not insurance policies, and companies that sell them do not make
payments or reimbursements. The cost is placed squarely on the
shoulders of the person needing care, sometimes in ways that pinch
people who are already squeezed financially.</TE>
<TE>   Ray-Baucom discovered that she had to pay her bill in full within
30 days of the time Family Care figured the discount on her bills.
Care Entree customers who need hospital services must pay an upfront
deposit of $1,000 for each day of the expected stay, according to
James Herrington, chief marketing officer for Private Healthcare
Systems. Chamber Health tells its members that payment is due at the
time of service unless other arrangements have been made. In order to
persuade providers to offer discounts, card companies must make sure
providers get paid. "We don't want to cause bad debt," Herrington
says.</TE>
<TE>   But such rules limit the usefulness of the cards, and because
health care is so expensive, they may offer little help when the
bills are really large. A person who can't afford health insurance is
no more likely to afford the $2,000 discounted price for, say, knee
surgery than the full $2,500 it would cost without the discount.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the matter of finding doctors and hospitals that will
accept the card. UCLA Medical Center doesn't accept them. Neither do
some other hospitals. White Memorial Hospital, which serves East Los
Angeles with its large uninsured population, says it has no
experience with these cards. The California Medical Assn. notes that
some doctors do not even know they are listed on card company
provider lists.</TE>
<TE>   And because the cards mimic real insurance, providers may accept
them in error. Steve Rutledge, communications director at Childrens
Hospital, says the hospital "certainly doesn't accept them when we
know about them." In Ray-Baucom's case, he said, the card, which bore
the name of the National Assn. of Preferred Providers and Family
Care, didn't raise any warning flags when it was presented. "These
cards imitate a normal insurance card, and when you call, they
imitate a normal insurance company."</TE>
<TE>   Ray-Baucom just received a bill for $5,748, the full price of the
hospital service, including $2,200 for the physician and
anesthesiologist. Other people are getting caught in the terms
imposed by health savings cards, and a few states have begun to
regulate them. The attorney general of New York recently announced a
settlement with two New York-based companies that he said had
"exaggerated the savings on medical expenses" and "failed to disclose
important information that increased the overall cost of the program
to consumers."</TE>
<TE>   This year in California, Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough)
introduced a bill that would have required discount companies to
disclose that the cards are not insurance policies and that members
will be responsible for their medical bills. The proposed legislation
would also have alerted consumers that they may be eligible for state
programs such as Medi-Cal or Healthy Families--sensible requirements
for sure.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, card companies opposed the bill. So did the
influential California Medical Assn., which worried that any attempt
to legitimize the cards would give them more of a market and possibly
let them take over one of the jobs of physicians--referring patients
to other providers.</TE>
<TE>   For now, it's caveat emptor for both consumers and health-care
providers. As for Sandra Ray-Baucom, she is working out payment
arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   Although the card became, inadvertently, her son's admission
ticket for medical care, she sums up her experience this way: "They
are basically a waste of money unless you have a large reserve of
cash to pay in full."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the uninsured don't.</TE>

<LD>Vegetarian Resource Group</LD>
<LD>   www.vrg.org</LD>
<LD>   Overview: This nonprofit group is devoted to spreading the word
about vegetarianism and health. The Web site functions as a store,
news source and all-purpose guide for vegetarians as well as those
considering forsaking animal products.</LD>
<TE>   What works: For all the evidence that a vegetarian diet protects
us against disease and obesity--we're talking about fruits,
vegetables and beans, after all--there's still the matter of
nutrition. The diet needs to be nutritionally adequate, and the site
spells out how that can be done. It details the best sources of
important nutrients, such as calcium and iron, and includes tables
listing the nutrient contents of plant-based foods. Tofu is hardly
the only nondairy source of calcium, for instance; collard greens and
turnip greens are good alternatives. There are recipes here plus
advice for vegans and young vegetarians.</TE>
<TE>   The site proselytizes as well as explains, and it could use a page
or two addressing the risks of diets that are too restrictive. Yet
the advice is based on science, rather than food fads or faux
spirituality.</TE>

<LD>"I have said that I could live the rest of my life without ever
having sex again," mused a lithe, stylish West Los Angeles mother of
two who has been with her husband for 17 years. "Then when I have sex
and get into it, it surprises me. I think oh, this is great."</LD>
<LD>   The woman said that she doesn't know why her interest in sex has
diminished so dramatically. She speculated that it might have to do
with her exhaustion at day's end, niggling resentments toward her
husband that make her feel less than amorous, the natural effects of
aging or a combination of those things.</LD>
<LD>   If there were a magic pill that would revive her lustiness, she
said she would take it. "It would be fun, and it would keep my
husband happier," she said laughing. "It would be good for my
marriage."</LD>
<TE>   Although there's nothing on the market yet that can do for women
what a diamond-shaped blue pill has done for men, drug companies such
as Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Bayer have been on a competitive quest over
the past four years to develop what many are calling "the female
Viagra."</TE>
<TE>   Social scientists and mental health clinicians are cautioning that
after "the female Viagra" becomes available, women experiencing
normal lulls and changes in their sexual life may be persuaded by
drug companies' marketing campaigns and doctors that they have a
sexual dysfunction.</TE>
<TE>   "The concern is that a [Viagra-type] drug will be marketed to
women who don't need it and can't afford it and that the marketing
will lead women to feel insecure about their sexuality," said Leonore
Tiefer, an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Albert
Einstein College of Medicine in New York City and co-editor of "A New
View of Women's Sexual Problems," (Haworth, 2001), a newly released
collection of writing by clinicians, social scientists and academics
on the subject. "We are concerned that the definition of a sexual
problem will be expanded to include every woman."</TE>
<TE>   John Bancroft, a psychiatrist and director of the Kinsey Institute
for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction at Indiana University in
Bloomington, said that the sexuality of men and women differ
markedly. "We can't just transfer concepts that are being used for
men in regards to sexuality and sexual dysfunction to women," said
Bancroft, author of a cautionary article about the "medicalization"
of female sexual problems in next month's issue of the journal
Archives of Sexual Behavior. "We need to have an open-minded look at
what is important for women in their sexual lives."</TE>
<TE>   Bancroft said that the American Psychiatric Assn.'s Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Disorders--the DSM IV--which codifies commonly
accepted standards, "is singularly unhelpful in assessing women's
sexual problems and addressing what women's needs are. It is just not
relevant." The manual divides men and women's sexual "dysfunction"
into four categories: sexual desire disorders, sexual arousal
disorders, orgasmic disorders, and pain disorders.</TE>
<TE>   The definitions of dysfunction are based upon the assumption that
there is only one physiological sexual response pattern or a "normal
function," according to Tiefer's manifesto, "A New View of Women's
Sexual Problems," available on the Web site www.fsd-alert.org. This
description of normal function begins with the sex drive, followed by
stages of desire, arousal and orgasm, she writes. But women don't
usually separate desire from arousal, Tiefer said. They care more
about subjective arousal than physical arousal, she argues.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Tiefer said, women's sexual complaints more often focus on
relationship difficulties that are not described at all in the DSM
IV. "The majority of women's sex lives that are not good will not be
helped by medication," Bancroft said. "Most people go through
circumstances in their lives when they are not particularly sexual
because they are depressed, too tired, stressed or there are
relationship or economic problems," Bancroft said. "The key is
distinguishing whether it is a [sexual] dysfunction and a situational
circumstance. Often, the machinery is OK."</TE>
<TE>   Tiefer thinks one of the reasons the search for the "female
Viagra" hasn't resulted in a marketable pill is that there is no
single measurable behavior or outcome that is the equivalent of a
male erection. Indeed, researchers have found that, unlike most men,
women do not tend to be goal-oriented about sex. In one survey, 2,632
self-selected women who were asked to describe sexual satisfaction,
most frequently mentioned feeling close before sex, emotional
closeness after sex and feeling loved, said Carol Rinkeleib Ellison,
a clinical psychologist who detailed the survey results in her book
"Women's Sexualities: Generations of Women Share Intimate Secrets of
Sexual Self-Acceptance," (New Harbinger, 2000). The ways in which
women express and experience their sexuality, Ellison said, varies
radically.</TE>
<TE>   "Some women could take or leave sex, some said it was very
important and many women said that they wanted more physical
closeness that didn't have to lead to orgasm or intercourse," Ellison
said. "My concern about a 'female Viagra' is that when women try it
and find out it isn't the solution for their sexual difficulties,
they will feel like they have somehow failed."</TE>
<TE>   "A number of drugs are being tested, and it is just a matter of
time before a drug is out," said Tiefer, who two years ago founded A
New View Campaign, an organization of social scientists, academics
and clinicians who want to advance the idea that women's sexual
problems are not necessarily only medical in nature and are also due
to psychological, relationship and sociocultural factors.</TE>
<TE>   Most psychiatrists and psychologists specializing in the treatment
of sexual difficulties agree that pharmacological treatment may offer
benefits for some women who have an unusually low propensity for
sexual excitation. Therapeutic gains will probably be modest,
however, Bancroft said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, new medical methods are to be welcomed, he writes in
the upcoming issue of journal Archives of Sexual Behavior, "provided
they don't ... undermine the broad social and psychological factors
impacting the human sexual experience."</TE>

<LD>THE KINDNESS OF SISTERS</LD>
<LD>   Annabella Milbanke and</LD>
<LD>   the Destruction of the Byrons</LD>
<TE>   By David Crane</TE>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf</TE>
<TE>   320 pp., $26.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The news of his death came down on my heart like a mass of lead
... as if I had lost a brother! O God! That so many souls of mud and
clay should fill up their base existence to the utmost bound, and
this, the noblest spirit in Europe, should sink before half his
course was run! ...There is a blank in your heart, and a blank in
mine, since this man passed away."</TE>
<TE>   Thus wrote the future Victorian sage Thomas Carlyle to Jane Welsh,
his future wife, on learning of the death of Lord Byron in 1824, his
36th year, from a fever contracted while fighting in the cause of
Greek independence. Carlyle's reaction was typical of the outpouring
of shock and grief that greeted the poet's death. Although Byron is
still famous today, it is hard to conceive just how large he once
loomed.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Byron's poetry (apart from his scintillating comic satire
"Don Juan" and the occasional well-wrought lyric) may strike us as
bombastic and hollow. Yet Byron, perhaps the least imaginative of the
great English Romantics, was indubitably the most celebrated in his
day, bigger than Elvis and Princess Diana rolled into one.</TE>
<TE>   David Crane's "The Kindness of Sisters" helps illuminate the
nature of Byron-mania. Crane focuses on the tortuous relationship
between two women caught up in his spell: his wife, Annabella
Milbanke, and his half-sister, Augusta Leigh. Byron was embroiled in
a scandalous affair with Lady Caroline Lamb and was trying to put an
end to her pursuit of him. More significantly, he had also become
sexually involved with Augusta, so marriage to the youthful, clever
Miss Milbanke, an accomplished mathematician, seemed to offer a way
out.</TE>
<TE>   But a way out of what? It is Crane's contention that Byron
(consciously or not) was seeking an excuse to escape the "right
little, tight little island" of England, and that a disastrous
marriage was his way of forcing himself to take the plunge. This
seems a trifle far-fetched. Wouldn't it have been simpler to leave
England without going through all this Sturm und Drang? Then again,
things were never simple with Byron.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the wedding, Byron's first words to his new
bride were: "It must come to a separation. It is enough that you are
my wife for me to hate you." Although there were moments of joy still
in store for his baffled but besotted wife, there were many more of
cruelty and misery. Stranger yet was the business of Augusta, who at
one point came to live with them. The sisters-in-law became close
friends, joining forces to try and manage their difficult man. But
Byron did not disguise the fact that it was Augusta whom he truly
loved.</TE>
<TE>   Within a year, Annabella had taken their infant daughter, Ada, and
fled to her parents. Byron fled the country, adjuring Annabella to
"be kind" to his beloved sister.</TE>
<TE>   Annabella soon became involved in a war of words attempting to
establish her status as the high-minded, injured party, and damning
her former spouse and his compliant sister as the sinners. Byron was
beyond her reach, but Augusta, emotionally and financially dependent
on her sister-in-law, became the object of Annabella's evangelical
campaign for moral reform, which lasted into the next generation with
a battle for the souls of their daughters: Annabella and Byron's Ada
(a gifted mathematician like her mother, but with worrying signs of
dissolution like her father), and Augusta's troubled and erratic
daughter Medora, believed to be Byron's as well.</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece of Crane's book is a brilliantly conceived
dramatic scene in the form of a play: a fact-based, if necessarily
speculative, reconstruction of the last face-to-face meeting between
Annabella and Augusta, which took place in 1851. In Annabella, Crane
sees a microcosm of the deep ambivalence of British society: sedate,
orderly and moralistic on one hand, yet secretly in love with
rebellion, wildness and passion on the other. Crane's understanding
of Annabella's continuing susceptibility to Byronic charm makes her
seem a sympathetic character: She genuinely wants to redeem all that
Byronic "beauty and grace" from sin.</TE>
<TE>   But in the final analysis, he portrays Annabella as the heavy,
even though the story also invites a different interpretation, in
which the real heavy is Byron himself.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike his friend and fellow pariah Shelley, Byron was not an
idealistic revolutionary but a rebel without a cause. Shelley's
utopian notions of free love may have caused pain to the women in his
life, but he really did hope for a kind of communal bliss, free from
crippling notions of sin. For the cynical Calvinist Byron, sinfulness
was part of the attraction. No wonder he, rather than the more truly
original Shelley, was the superstar: He challenged society's norms
only to confirm them. No wonder Annabella became embittered when she
saw that all his talent and charisma had led her to nothing that was
genuinely beautiful.</TE>

<HD>The Kindest Cut: Demise of Rudy's Comb-Over</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN GIVHAN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The world's most famous comb-over has vanished. New York's former
mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has at last given in to baldness, allowing
his naked scalp to rise--unashamed--from a ring of smooth, graying
fringe.</LD>
<LD>   The public debut of this more flattering hairstyle was last week,
at his mother's funeral in Brooklyn. But his unabashed baldness was
revealed to the wider world when Giuliani made a series of television
appearances and read from the list of the dead at the memorial
ceremony held at the World Trade Center site.</LD>
<LD>   The comb-over was no more unattractive on Giuliani than it is on
the legions of men who use it in an attempt to conceal the obvious.
But Giuliani's comb-over had reached mythic proportions as it was
memorialized in comedy bits on virtually every television network and
in countless caricatures. One can only assume that its disappearance
will send shock waves ricocheting from the studios of "Saturday Night
Live" to the corner barbershop. This is hair news on the level of a
Matt Lauer crew cut, a George Clooney Caesar, a Justin Timberlake
buzz.</LD>
<TE>   The former mayor hasn't gone to the extreme of rubbing pomades
into his sparse but now well-coiffed hair. He simply but dramatically
has shaken off the image of a door-to-door salesman with an affinity
for Sansabelt slacks, black socks with shorts and the short-sleeve
dress shirt--the garment industry's great oxymoron.</TE>
<TE>   Embracing the hairstyling standard of all savvy, self-aware and
balding men--Sean Connery, Bruce Willis--he has stopped growing long
and parting low. Now his dark suits and crisp white shirts have an
enhanced, self-confident aura, a Robert Duvall-meets-Ed Harris
elegance. Giuliani, 58, is knocking at the door of handsome. The
compliments are rolling in.</TE>
<TE>   Who was his stealth stylist? And what was Giuliani's motivation: a
little pestering from his style-conscious girlfriend Judith Nathan,
one wisecracking comedian too many, an honest self-assessment in
front of the mirror, or a general longing for a fresh start?</TE>
<TE>   According to Giuliani spokeswoman Sunny Mindel, "The mayor has
been extremely busy in the last five days and he combed his hair
quickly like this one morning." His girlfriend approved. And what man
needs more than that?</TE>
<TE>   Yet simply slipping off the almost always pedestrian cloak of
public office can brighten a politician's look.</TE>
<TE>   The demands of public office pressure politicians to strive for
the middle of the road in attire and nonchalance in grooming. Their
clothes may be high-quality and well made, but they do not
necessarily enhance the body inside. So often it seems that
politicians sneak glances into a mirror only when they think no one
is watching, or they avoid them altogether. Style is not their forte.
They take pride in their unfashionableness.</TE>
<TE>   When these folks leave office, they bear the scars of stress and
worry. A few never recover and continue down a slippery slope that
leads to jelly doughnuts, bursting seams and stained ties. Most hold
the line, unable to move beyond the staid appearance that was so
reassuringly inoffensive to voters. A few uncover an inner aesthete.</TE>
<TE>   When Bill Clinton appeared on "The Late Show With David Letterman"
last week, he displayed a keen post-White House sartorial savvy.
Dressed in a black suit, white shirt and sapphire tie, he looked
particularly dashing--as well as rested. Not enough can be said about
the grooming benefits of a good night's sleep.</TE>
<TE>   And instead of looking like a street fighter selling used cars on
the side, Giuliani has polish and dash. An out-of-office makeover
doesn't rewrite history, but at least in the final chapters, the
pictures will be better.</TE>

<LD>Who is Maurice Sendak?</LD>
<LD>   Maurice Sendak is one of America's most famous authors and
illustrators of children's books. One of his best-known works is
"Where the Wild Things Are." But did you know that he also designs
sets and costumes for operas?</LD>
<LD>   Sendak was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1928. As a child, he was
often ill. Spending most of his time indoors, he began to invent
characters and stories that he later put into his books. He also grew
up listening to music. He heard his first opera on the radio.</LD>
<TE>   An opera is a play where actors sing their lines rather than
speak. Actors dress in fancy costumes, and the theater is turned into
a place of fantasy and imagination. The music highlights the mood or
emotions in the story.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Sendak combined his love for books and music and
began designing theater sets and costumes for operas. While
designing, he likes to imagine that the story leaps off the page and
onto the stage. He always listens to the music of his favorite
composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, when he's working because he feels
most creative when he hears music. Sendak has worked on Mozart's "The
Magic Flute" and hopes to one day do the design for all of Mozart's
operas. Do you ever listen to music while you are painting or
drawing? What music do you like to listen to?</TE>
<TE>   Illustrations from Sendak's works and interactive activities are
part of a major exhibition at the Skirball Cultural Center beginning
this Friday and continuing through Jan. 5. For more information, call
(310) 440-4500 or visit www.skirball.org.</TE>

<DH>Anne Lamott's work confronts real-life anger and pain</DH>

<LD>The white VW bug in the garage and the sign at the entrance--Hippies
Use Side Door--signal that this is where Anne Lamott lives. It's a
light-filled house on a knoll in this Marin County town of 7,500 with
its bohemian '60s sensibility.</LD>
<LD>   "You probably saw more tie-dye today than you've seen in years,
right?" says Lamott, opening the door. She's wearing jeans and a
casual shirt and her signature dreadlocks are slightly askew, one
"sticking up like a little antenna."</LD>
<LD>   Kicking off her shoes, she settles into a chair, unruffled in the
midst of domestic chaos. While remodeling a bathroom, workmen had
flooded the floor, broken through the wrong wall and messed up the
electricity, causing the food in the fridge to go bad.</LD>
<TE>   It's something that might have happened to a character in a book
by Lamott, who has built her considerable reputation largely writing
about real life, notably in "Operating Instructions," her 1993
breakthrough memoir chronicling the challenges of the first year of
single motherhood, when she was punching holes in walls, "crazy and
furious and desperate and still trying to do the best job I could."</TE>
<TE>   Pantheon paid $35,000 for it, to her then a "king's ransom," and,
she says, "nobody expected this crabby, black-humored, political baby
book to sell at all," but it became a bestseller--Lamott's first big
deal.</TE>
<TE>   She writes funny, even on serious subjects. Wracked with guilt
over punishing son Sam, she felt as though she were "buzzing Bambi
with a cattle prod."</TE>
<TE>   Due out Oct. 1 is "Blue Shoe" (Riverhead), a novel whose
protagonist, Mattie Ryder, a realistic size 12 with jiggly thighs, is
a recently divorced mother of two young children coping with the
emotional needs of her kids and the demands of her aging mother and
hoping to find love with Mr. Right.</TE>
<TE>   Publishers Weekly says Lamott "brilliantly captures the dilemma of
a divorced woman from the so-called 'sandwich generation' ... a
funny, poignant and occasionally gut-wrenching novel." Kirkus Reviews
mentions the author's infusion of her "quirky brand of Christianity"
and concludes of the novel, "Lots of charm in the details, not much
for momentum."</TE>
<TE>   At 48, with a 13-year-old son, Lamott has never married and has
"waited a long time for a really nice man." She recently has found
one and is in a relationship with a South African art director for a
San Francisco advertising agency.</TE>
<TE>   A woman who has admitted to having just about every
addiction--except gambling--drugs and alcohol, she has been sober for
16 years. She's also had a bout with bulimia. Reared as a
nonbeliever, she has embraced Christianity with a fervor that spills
onto the pages of her books and, she acknowledges, turns off some
readers. She shrugs, "They should write their own book. I'm not
everybody's cup of tea."</TE>
<TE>   She experienced her religious conversion 17 years ago, as a drunk
attracted to the singing coming from St. Andrew, a small,
predominantly African American church in Marin City, where she still
worships. Lamott rejects the label "born-again Christian"--"I think
that's stronger than we need to be, and it's so Pat Robertson. I'm
just a hard-core left-wing activist who believes that everyone goes
to heaven."</TE>
<TE>   She'd been "dodging Christianity all through my 20s and early 30s.
My father hated it so much. He was a child of missionaries." Of her
finding Jesus, she has observed, her intellectual left-wing
nonbeliever friends "would have been less appalled if I had developed
a close personal friendship with Strom Thurmond."</TE>
<TE>   Lamott has rejected friends' suggestions that she tone down
religion in her writing. She doesn't want to write novels like most
of those she reads, in which people "don't believe in anything. It's
all hopeless. The only world I'm interested in showing you around is
animated by beliefs and humanity. I'm as confused and self-centered
and angry as anyone, but that's the world I can be the tour guide
for."</TE>
<TE>   Lamott's writing focuses on four themes--anger, grief, faith and
friendship. She harbors a lot of anger, much of it directed toward
her parents--her writer father Kenneth, who died of a brain tumor
when she was 25, and her mother, who died last year, leaving Lamott
with unresolved issues.</TE>
<TE>   "My parents had an awful marriage and stayed married for 28
years," she says. She grew up in Marin County, one of three
children--and the only girl--in a household where "there was a Harold
Pinter play unfolding all the time." Intellectual discussions were
encouraged, but shows of emotion weren't permitted.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything was about armor and appearance. My mission has been to
get some of the armor off, and be more of a visible mess, and talk
about it in a way that's funny so people can say, 'Thank you. Me,
too.' " She smiles and says, "I was a grown-up, and probably drunk,
before I yelled at somebody."</TE>
<TE>   The drinking started when she was an overweight teenager, as did
drugs, which she discovered would make her thin. She wasn't the class
beauty, nor an A student, so she assumed the role of "flight
attendant, geisha, to the family and the world, in order to be of
value. I was a therapist, a marriage counselor to my parents."</TE>
<TE>   Her mother passed on to her the '50s attitude about the value of
women and girls, who were taught that "you were your teeth and your
breasts and your skin tones."</TE>
<TE>   Lamott struggled with bulimia--being almost invisible was the
goal--and for 15 years has been in therapy, learning "to stop having
to be the light in people's lives" and to understand that "a man can
love me if I have flabby arms." (Today, she eats whatever she wants
and is of healthy weight).</TE>
<TE>   Her writing is so personal that the reader feels she is baring her
darkest secrets. In reality, Lamott says, "I think of it as kind of a
bull's-eye. In the center is my most private stuff. Three or four
rings out is the stuff I write about."</TE>
<TE>   She thinks she resonates with readers because "the stuff I talk
about is universal--the grief, the anger, stuff about women's bodies,
the conflicted feelings of motherhood, the hostility toward your
parents." She has "always loved books where people tell the truth.
When people tell the truth, it's like finding an English language
station in Morocco."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, she likes funny, outspoken women and staunch
political women, including Sen. Hillary Clinton and former Texas Gov.
Ann Richards and Lamott's good friend, columnist Molly Ivins. She
admires writers Barbara Kingsolver, Alice Munro, Fran Leibowitz and
Marianne Williamson, and singer Bonnie Raitt.</TE>
<TE>   "Blue Shoe" is her sixth novel. She also has written three
nonfiction books. As a teenager, she knew writing was her calling and
wrote a column while at Goucher College in Baltimore, then a women's
college that she chose because it was her mother's alma mater, and
there were "many brilliant feminist professors there stirring things
up. Also, I got in, and that attracted me." Radcliffe and Wellesley
turned her down.</TE>
<TE>   She stayed only two years. Moving to San Francisco at 19, she
worked as a clerk typist--"I was terrible at it and wrote short
stories a lot of the day and threw out things that were supposed to
get filed that confused or upset me."</TE>
<TE>   At night, she wrote and drank wine at coffeehouses. Later, in
Bolinas, a counterculture town on the Pacific, she cleaned houses and
taught tennis so she could write. She also "took a lot of LSD and
other psychedelic drugs" and "got drunk every night."</TE>
<TE>   There, she wrote "Hard Laughter," a love letter to her father, who
was dying of brain cancer. Published by Viking in 1980, it was her
first book sale. A few years later she moved to Sausalito, renting
space on a houseboat, where she wrote "Joe Jones" with help from a
Guggenheim fellowship.</TE>
<TE>   The novel is set in Petaluma, where she'd waited tables at a
waterfront dive. During three years on the houseboat, Lamott survived
by writing magazine articles and food reviews until getting an
advance for her "first sober book," her 1989 novel "All New People,"
about a comically dysfunctional family.</TE>
<TE>   Lamott has written extensively about her struggle with alcoholism
and cocaine and of her tumultuous private life, which has included
two abortions.</TE>
<TE>   When she became pregnant with Sam, she says, "I wrote a note to
God--'I'd love to have a kid if this is the kid I'm supposed to
have.' " Certain events led her to believe that God said yes.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a brilliant, gifted child," she says of Sam, "even though
he doesn't read for pleasure."</TE>
<TE>   The phone rings, and Lamott jumps up, joking that it might be
Oprah. It's the local garage.</TE>
<TE>   Sam comes home from school, a friend in tow, and they retreat to
his downstairs bedroom, which Lamott refers to as his "illegal Hugh
Hefner pad."</TE>
<TE>   This house is a work in progress. She bought it three years ago,
moving from a nearby home where she was "writing in the garage" and
thinking that "a real writer should be able to close the door in a
testy way. Actually, I might be reading the new People magazine, but
no one would find out."</TE>
<TE>   When they moved in, the house was falling apart. "They forgot to
put in a wall. They just covered up everything." She is certain that
Ebola and black fungi lurk behind boards. A waterbed had burst and
buckled floors. Eight resident cats had left a lingering urine odor.
The living room, now a soft gold, was purple. But, Lamott says, "we
got it for a song."</TE>
<TE>   She now has a home office but no current writing project. "In a
perfect world, I'd write more spiritual essays. A novel takes so much
more stamina than nonfiction." She'd also like to resume the online
essays she wrote for Salon.com from 1996 to 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a very slow writer," she says, and five pages can take a
week, "even though it comes out sounding like I just said it."
Typically, she drops off Sam at school around 8:30 a.m., comes home
and putters until settling down to four or five hours of writing
time. "Puttering makes me happy. I love to fold laundry. I love to
wash dishes. I have a gift." She laughs and says she is like Rainman
meets the Unabomber, puttering away while her mind spins wildly. "I
think too much. I have a thinking disorder."</TE>
<TE>   She runs the church school at St. Andrew, which means she also is
"the peanut-butter-and-jelly minister," rounding up volunteers to
make sandwiches with a "sanctioned jam," kid-friendly red.</TE>
<TE>   Humor is her defense against darkness, a tool for coping in a
world that she--and Sam--find broken. "I do see the world as an AIDS
baby. Everyone's going to die and that's very frightening."</TE>
<TE>   In a world in which "most people are starving and in deprivation,"
she believes that laughter heals.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it just hard to be a human being most of the time," says
Lamott, for whom standing in the express line at the supermarket,
elbow to elbow with strangers, is a trial that "makes me want to live
on what I can grow."</TE>
<TE>   She is "absolutely, positively sure" there is a heaven, a realm
where spirits live "after our bodies break down like old cars." A pet
lover who has a gray striped cat named Jeanie, she believes, too,
that "our pets wait for us at the bridge between heaven and Earth and
run across the planks to escort us over."</TE>
<TE>   She hopes to land in a smoking area, even though she has kicked a
three-packs-a-day unfiltered Camels habit. "I think smokers and
Jewish people are inherently more interesting than other people."</TE>
<TE>   There's another thing she hopes for in heaven: "I want to be in
the room with the desserts."</TE>

<HD>A Career That's Still Unfolding</HD>
<DH>A former adman, 82, who made his name with pop-ups is a
driving force behind exhibit at the Central Library</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTIJANE LEVINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The world's greatest living expert on pop-up books is Waldo Hunt, 82,
of Encino. He is responsible for the renaissance in that low-tech
literary art form, which languished in America for 100 years until he
revived it in the 1960s. And he is the driving force behind a new
exhibit at the Central Library in Los Angeles, which features rare
antique originals from his collection and from the department of
special collections at the UCLA library.</LD>
<LD>   The exhibit, in two galleries on the first and second floors, is a
bit of a tease. It is filled with exquisitely illustrated books whose
parts would move if only a visitor could spin the paper wheels, or
pull and push the paper tabs and levers. But it is all behind glass,
untouchable for obvious reasons. This is not for little children with
low frustration levels.</LD>
<LD>   But for those who love the history of books, the great names of
the pop-up genre are all here. There are Meggendorfers and
Nisters--children's books created by the two German artists whose
work is the hallmark of the late 1800s, considered the Golden Age of
pop-ups, when upper-class Europeans lavished their children with
expensive playthings.</LD>
<TE>   And books by the Polish master Jan Pienkowski, born in 1936, whose
"Haunted House" (published in 1979) has movable bats in its belfry,
and is an all-time classic and bestseller. Robert Sabuda, who teaches
at the Pratt Institute in New York, is known as the Prince of Paper.
His award-winning "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" is on view with its
cyclone that swirls and hot air balloon that dangles over the Emerald
City.</TE>
<TE>   The classic Victorian fairy tale books show delicate children at
play with movable pastel pets. And scary stories offer vile monsters
that rise without warning from flattened pages.</TE>
<TE>   The saga of Hunt's entry into this esoteric arena is, in a sense,
the story of entrepreneurs in America. Hunt was no bibliophile or
scholar. He never saw rare books as his potential paycheck or
passion. He was an adman at the start, a guy who'd served in World
War II and wanted to strike it rich when he came home to California.
So he opened an ad agency in Los Angeles (W.H. Hunt &amp; Associates),
worked his heart out and made a small fortune when he sold his
successful business to an even bigger agency (Compton) in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Hired by Compton as part of the deal, Hunt moved to Manhattan with
his family. Somewhere along the way, he said by phone last week from
his Marina del Rey offices, the joy of agency life fizzled.</TE>
<TE>   "At one point, my biggest client was Volkswagen. I'd worked
doggedly to build up business for them. Once I'd done it, they
switched the account to another agency. I knew right then that I
needed something that would be all mine, a business that couldn't
disappear on me."</TE>
<TE>   He started another firm, Graphics International, not knowing
exactly for what purpose. Then, while strolling on Fifth Avenue, he
saw a beautiful imported children's pop-up book in a toy store
window. Bells went off in his head.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I'd found the magic key. I would make pop-up insert ads
for magazines, pop-up supermarket displays, pop-up promotional pieces
and direct-mail campaigns. Being an adman, and quite innovative, I
could look at that children's book from Czechoslovakia and see in it
my answer. No one was doing pop-ups in this country. No one could
afford to make them here. They had to be done by hand, and labor was
too expensive. I knew printers and engineers in Japan, where hand
labor was much less expensive then."</TE>
<TE>   He had struck another gold mine. His entrance into pop-ups was a
magazine ad campaign for Wrigley's gum. "It was a series of 14 ads of
zoo scenes; we produced 1 million magazine inserts for each of the 14
ads. It was a major breakthrough in the industry," Hunt recalled. And
business just kept getting better.</TE>
<TE>   He connected with Hallmark and started producing pop-up table
decorations and greeting cards for them. At that point, he says, he
was the only person in the world doing what he did. He became expert
at finding skilled paper engineers and production facilities in
countries where labor and artistry were affordable. He began
collecting pop-up paraphernalia for his private collection.</TE>
<TE>   Hunt says the term "pop-up" is generally taken to mean movable as
well. Modern children's books involve paper wheels to turn, tabs and
levers to push or pull--and the characters often appear to move with
or without popping up.</TE>
<TE>   He produced the first movable book for Random House in 1965.
"Within two years we had 30 pop-up titles in production for Random
House." They were mostly for children. In the late '60s, he sold his
company to Hallmark, reaping another handsome profit. Back in Los
Angeles in 1973, he formed Intervisual Books, which he said is still
the major creator and producer of movable books in the world. He is
now chairman emeritus of the company, and its major stockholder.</TE>
<TE>   Hunt is also the proprietor of the Waldo Hunt Children's Museum,
an interactive play place where children can view and learn to create
movable books. The museum is closed while it relocates to Marina del
Rey, Hunt said. It will reopen in January.</TE>

<LD>I don't get annoyed anymore when I can't remember where I put the car
keys.</LD>
<LD>   This is because I usually have more important matters on my mind.
Like where I put the car.</LD>
<LD>   No, the old memory isn't what it used to be.</LD>
<TE>   There was a time when I could remember names, faces, details,
batting orders, volumes of useless facts.</TE>
<TE>   Now, I can't remember a loaf of bread.</TE>
<TE>   I think the reason that Memory Lane has become, if not a dead end,
a cul-de-sac, can be attributed to the information glut, sensory
overload, and just the general hardening up of stuff that comes with
age.</TE>
<TE>   An early indication that your memory is, shall we say, in
recline--aside from misplacing things like the last 10 years--is a
sudden and mysterious fondness for memory humor.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, I believe there may be a direct relationship between how
amusing you find a memory joke, and the number of blanks your
synapses are firing.</TE>
<TE>   For example:</TE>
<TE>   Among the list of phone options at a doctor's office:</TE>
<TE>   If you have short-term memory loss, press 1.</TE>
<TE>   If you have short-term memory loss, press 1.</TE>
<TE>   If you have short-term memory loss, press 1.</TE>
<TE>   Let me just say that the first time I heard this one, stuff came
out of my nose.</TE>
<TE>   What makes a shaky memory easier to deal with is that a lot of
people seem to also be sailing aboard the good ship tabula rasa.</TE>
<TE>   Memory fade is becoming so common that half the time people don't
even try anymore. Instead, we communicate via a kind of shared,
fill-in-the-blanks mental telepathy.</TE>
<TE>   All too typical conversation:</TE>
<TE>   "So, I was downtown yesterday and I'm walking near ... what's the

<HD>A Wild and Crazy Night</HD>
<DH>In Las Vegas, post-fight euphoria provides a perfect excuse
for ratcheting up the party atmosphere</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Sin City turned into Fight Town and then celebrated into the early
hours Sunday with a giant salsa nightcap.</LD>
<LD>   Fernando Vargas appeared to be the only person in town to call it
an early night, taken to a local hospital for a check after being
pummeled on the head by Oscar De La Hoya in their championship fight.</LD>
<LD>   To the victor went the poolside spoils--a private party at
Mandalay Bay where talk of the boxers' bad blood was chased by bloody
Marys. As De La Hoya's family and supporters again cheered his win on
taped replays, hundreds of spirited but uninvited fans milled outside
the fence, wondering how to crash the gates.</LD>
<TE>   It's a scene that revisits Vegas with every big fight: another
chance for the powerful, the rich and the connected to sit with
celebrity, and the nobodies to at least strut through the gilded
casino scene and brush against the famous.</TE>
<TE>   Shiri Cohen, and her niece Shany Gelbman, tourists from Tel Aviv,
positioned themselves along a hallway leading to the Mandalay Bay
Event Center, hoping to catch a glimpse of the beautiful people
heading for the bout, parading beneath nine-foot-tall boxing gloves
hanging from the ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   "We came here to relax from all the tensions at home," Cohen said.
"We planned our trip here around the fight because we want to see
movie stars. This is the place."</TE>
<TE>   They would end up a little disappointed. Their biggest sighting of
the night: Lakers owner Jerry Buss, which wasn't bad because Cohen is
a big NBA fan. But in the crush, she missed Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx
and Don Johnson, rapper Nelly and supermodel Giselle, singers Sammy
Hager and Brian McKnight and comedians David Allen Grier and Keenan
Ivory Wayans.</TE>
<TE>   Fans hunting for boxing champs got their fix with the likes of
George Foreman, Thomas Hearns, Sugar Ray Leonard, Evander Holyfield
and Shane Mosley.</TE>
<TE>   Fight night in Vegas tips the already weighted scales even more
toward decadence and debauchery; the polished limousines seem a
little longer, the neon a little brighter, the hair a little bigger.
The fashions telegraph so much about one's place in the universe:</TE>
<TE>   Those men arriving in other casinos' carriages, in linen slacks
and silk sports shirts? High-rollers, with no need to make an
ostentatious impression, save their pricey, oversized cigars.</TE>
<TE>   The middle-age couples in finely tailored suits and sparkling,
slinky evening wear? From the ranks of casino executives and
corporate sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   Younger men with the tattoos on their necks, pressed T-shirts, and
gold chains? Partisans for either Golden Boy Oscar or Ferocious
Fernando, here from Los Angeles, Phoenix, Denver and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   And the ladies in tight, plunging tops and low-slung jeans,
finished with wide belts and open-toed heels? So many Jennifer Lopez
wannabes in one town.</TE>
<TE>   Who's to say whether the young women in the skimpiest, see-through
outfits knew Oscar De La Hoya from Oscar Meyer? They seemed to be
trolling for a different kind of action.</TE>
<TE>   Some folks eschewed the celebrity watch in favor of claiming
early, good seats in a nearby, 4,000-seat ballroom that was turned
into a closed-circuit theater. Many said they were too late to get
into the arena--where ringside seats were fetching $1,200 even before
scalpers got a piece of the action--and popped $50 for the next-best
thing.</TE>
<TE>   "I just finished a $5 hotdog and I'm afraid I can't afford what it
would cost to wash it down with a drink," said Harry Vigil, an oil
field worker from Santa Maria, who was still delighted to have
grabbed a screen-side seat.</TE>
<TE>   For others, having purchased seats inside the boxing arena was
only part of the measure of a successful fight night. Jon Maselko and
George Antonakos said the next question was where to go afterward,
and they hoped their fashion statement would win them entrance to an
A-list party.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, maybe not, as these two wild-and-crazy guys stood proud in
their wide-lapel, cranberry-plaid polyester suits. They said they
were a pair of stand-up improv performers, but were acting like the
Czechoslovakian party boys cruising for action on "Saturday Night
Live," bumping their posteriors into the hips of passing ladies and
shedding their sunglasses to wink at others.</TE>
<TE>   They cheerily bragged about being comped their $300 fight seats
after dropping $12,000 at the tables, and wondered what else in town
they could snag for "free."</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to catch De La Hoya's party after the fight, but we
don't know where it is yet," said Maselko, 25 with wholly unjustified
confidence.</TE>
<TE>   But they were nowhere to be seen later at The Beach, Mandalay
Bay's extensive poolside grounds where De La Hoya's celebration was
staged. Buffet lines offered fajitas and prime rib, cilantro and
horse radish, as the man of the hour sat in Cabana 8, looking
remarkably fresh and still-golden, accepting the congratulations of
his admirers.</TE>
<TE>   A few feet away, actor Tony Curtis said he watched the fight from
home on pay-for-view, and then decided to come down to the Strip with
his wife, Jillie, to partake in the celebration.</TE>
<TE>   "Vegas is a great environment for a party like this," he said.
"There's such a blending of people."</TE>

<HD>New AIDS Drug Will Be Free to Some Patients</HD>
<DH>HIV* Hundreds in U.S. who have a resistance to existing
therapies will be eligible for Fuzeon under the FDA's 'compassionate
use' program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA MARSA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An experimental AIDS drug will become available to seriously ill
patients free of charge in early October.</LD>
<LD>   The drug, Fuzeon, is the first in a new class of drugs known as
fusion inhibitors to be made available under the Food and Drug
Administration's "compassionate use" program, which permits certain
patients to take a drug before it is approved for sale. Scientists
estimate that tens of thousands of the 850,000 to 950,000 Americans
infected with HIV have developed resistance to existing drugs.</LD>
<LD>   Fusion inhibitors are "a significant breakthrough" because they
thwart HIV at a much earlier stage in the virus' life cycle than
current treatments, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.
Standard AIDS drugs work inside the cell, foiling HIV by stopping
production of one of two key enzymes, protease or reverse
transcriptase, that the virus needs to replicate. Fusion inhibitors,
in contrast, prevent HIV from entering the cell and inserting its DNA
into the patient's genetic machinery.</LD>
<TE>   Two recent studies, involving nearly 1,000 volunteers with high
viral counts, used Fuzeon in combination with three to five standard
anti-HIV drugs. The therapy reduced viral loads to undetectable
levels (below 50 copies per milliliter) in up to 20% of the test
subjects for whom current AIDS drug therapies were ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   Fuzeon "proves HIV is vulnerable to an attack directed at an
entirely different target," said Fauci, who believes results will
improve when the drug is used by HIV patients who aren't as sick.
This also paves the way for devising more potent drugs that keep HIV
from invading healthy cells, some of which already are in
development.</TE>
<TE>   Another advantage of Fuzeon is that it doesn't have serious side
effects like other antiretrovirals. However, patients must
self-administer the drug twice a day by injection, making it less
convenient than AIDS drugs taken in pill form. Also, Fuzeon must be
combined with other anti-HIV medicines to be effective. "Patients who
are running out of treatment options will probably benefit the most
from the drug," said Dr. Peter R. Wolfe, an HIV specialist in Beverly
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The drug has "fast track" approval status from the FDA and may be
on the market by spring 2003. However, some experts predict that its
cost could exceed $12,000 annually. "We haven't announced the price
yet, but we anticipate it will probably be more expensive than
existing therapies," says Heather Van Ness, a spokeswoman for
Hoffman-La Roche Inc. in Nutley, N.J., which developed Fuzeon in
partnership with Trimeris Inc. in Durham, N.C. The most expensive
AIDS drugs now cost a little less than $8,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Fuzeon will be distributed by doctors enrolled in the
compassionate-use program to 1,200 patients worldwide, including 600
in the U.S. To be eligible, patients must be under the care of
participating physicians.</TE>

<HD>Physicists Warn Against CT Scans for the Healthy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANNE PARTIE LANGE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For most people, having a CT scan as a sort of high-tech checkup not
only puts you at risk of a false alarm about your health, it
unnecessarily increases your exposure to radiation. For those
reasons, the American Assn. of Physicists in Medicine is cautioning
healthy consumers about whole-body scans.</LD>
<LD>   Other medical associations, such as the American College of
Cardiology and the American College of Radiology, have issued
warnings, but the AAPM, a group with special expertise in the physics
of medical radiation, emphasizes the danger of radiation exposure.
According to the group's statement, posted on its Web site,
www.aapm.org, the typical whole-body CT scan delivers hundreds of
times the radiation of a chest X-ray.</LD>
<LD>   "The risk of that causing a radiation-induced cancer is unknown,"
says Robert Gould, president of the association and a professor of
radiology at UC San Francisco. "The question is, is that
risk--however small--worth the benefit?"</LD>
<TE>   CT scans for people without symptoms "has not currently been found
to be scientifically justifiable or clinically efficacious," the
association said, also citing concerns about cost and the detection
of minor problems that lead to unnecessary medical examinations and
expenses.</TE>

<TE>   Starchy Foods May Increase Odds of Developing Pancreatic Cancer</TE>
<TE>   People who are overweight and sedentary are already bumping up
their risk for developing cancer. Now a study shows that the kind of
carbohydrates they eat could affect their risk of developing a
particularly aggressive malignancy, cancer of the pancreas.</TE>
<TE>   By examining the dietary records of 89,000 women participating in
the Nurses' Health Study, an ongoing research project at Boston's
Brigham and Women's Hospital, scientists found that overweight women
who don't get much exercise and eat a lot of starchy foods are 2 1/2
times as likely to develop the cancer than if they ate other kinds of
carbohydrates.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers were prompted to look at starchy foods because
previous studies had indicated that excessive amounts of insulin
enhance the growth of cancer cells in the pancreas. Starchy foods
such as white and rye bread, white rice, and potatoes raise glucose
levels higher--and so increase insulin production more--than other
types of carbohydrates, such as leafy green vegetables, whole grains
and beans.</TE>
<TE>   People who are overweight and sedentary often already have
abnormally high glucose and insulin levels. For them, starchy foods
push those levels even higher.</TE>
<TE>   Lean and fit people are more sensitive to insulin, so they don't
have to produce as much as overweight, insulin-resistant people do,
even when they eat starchy foods. And this study found that the lean
women were far less likely to develop pancreatic cancer than their
overweight, inactive counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   Replacing some of the foods that send insulin levels soaring with
other sources of carbohydrates like green leafy vegetables and fruit
is going to improve your health, not only by reducing the risk of
pancreatic cancer, but by lowering the risk of diabetes and
cardiovascular disease as well, says Charles S. Fuchs, a co-author of
the study and an oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. "At
the same time, it's clear from this research that being lean and fit
is also protective," he says.</TE>

<TE>   Next Time You Feel Faint, Try Crossing Your Legs</TE>
<TE>   People prone to fainting spells might try a leg-crossing,
muscle-tightening maneuver recently put to the test at the University
of Amsterdam. It's a simple technique that--unlike lying down or
putting your head between your legs--isn't obvious to others. The
trick is to do it early.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming the so-called cocktail party posture keeps blood from
pooling in the veins--one reason why people with a tendency to faint
tend to pass out when they have to stand for a long time. As the
veins dilate, the heart rate drops.</TE>
<TE>   Emotional stress can cause a similar response, which is why a
sudden shock can trigger fainting.</TE>
<TE>   To test the intervention, Dutch researchers induced fainting in 20
people with a history of vasovagal syncope, a condition that causes
blood to pool in the legs. The volunteers were placed on a table that
could be tilted, causing them to become lightheaded and nauseated.
All of the patients had a drop in blood pressure when this happened
and half had a drop in heart rate.</TE>
<TE>   With the table then tilted so they were upright, the participants
crossed their legs, and tensed the muscles of the abdomen, legs and
buttocks, relieving their symptoms. None of them fainted.</TE>

<TE>   A Soy Diet Early On May Lower Risk of Breast Cancer Later in Life</TE>
<TE>   Women who consume tofu, fresh soybeans, miso and soy milk when
they're young may be developing defenses against breast cancer later
in life. A study of Asian Americans in Los Angeles County found that
women who ate a soy food at least once a week during adolescence had
a 44% reduction in their risk of breast cancer as adults. Those who
ate soy at least weekly as teens but stopped as adults had a 23%
reduction in risk.</TE>
<TE>   While Asian Americans don't eat as much soy as their counterparts
living in Asia, they still typically consume relatively high amounts.
To see if the soy in their diets had an impact on breast-cancer risk,
USC Keck School of Medicine researchers interviewed some 500 Chinese,
Japanese, and Filipino women with breast cancer and about an equal
number of healthy Asian women. Many of the women in this study moved
to the U.S. as young adults.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike those who ate soy as teenagers, women who didn't eat much
soy until their adult years had little reduction in breast cancer
risk. However, because there were few women who fit this pattern,
much larger studies are needed to determine if there is any benefit
to starting to eat soy as an adult. The greatest risk reduction was
among those who ate soy as adolescents and adults, even when the
researchers took into account other risk factors for breast cancer.</TE>
<TE>   According to the study's co-author, Anna H. Wu, professor of
preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine, it's likely that
those who ate soy as teenagers also ate it as young children. So
although the study didn't look at this, Wu says these results suggest
that beginning early to eat some soy on a weekly basis seems
beneficial.</TE>

<TE>   Survey Finds Married Couples Mirror Each Other's Health</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to choosing a mate, we tend to marry those who are
like us in terms of education, attractiveness and economic status.
Now a study of more than 4,700 middle-aged couples finds that spouses
also mirror each other when it comes to sickness.</TE>
<TE>   Among couples who responded to a nationwide survey, men who were
in excellent health had a 43% chance of being married to a woman in
excellent health, but a man in poor health had only a 17.5% chance of
being married to a woman in excellent health.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for these findings is that education and economic
status tend to predict health--well-educated people who are not
financially stressed tend to be healthier. Another reason is that
once married, couples share the same air, eat the same food, and have
similar health habits. They share the same emotional stresses too.
For instance, when one person is sick, which is stressful, the
partner caring for them is under a lot of pressure too, and their
health may suffer as a result.</TE>
<TE>   This awareness that one partner's health appears to mirror the
other is more than just a curiosity; it has important financial
implications, says Sven Wilson, the study's co-author and assistant
professor of political science and economics at the Brigham Young
University in Provo, Utah. Health insurance is one consideration.
"Disability insurance and long-term care insurance for a healthy
spouse becomes even more important as the health of his or her
partner declines," Wilson says.</TE>

<HD>Surgery Best for Carpal Tunnel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Surgery appears to be more effective than splints in bringing
long-term relief from carpal tunnel syndrome, a painful condition
associated with repetitive, forceful hand motions.</LD>
<LD>   The operation, which involves cutting the ligament over the
wrist's carpal tunnel to relieve pressure on a major nerve, is the
fifth-most-common procedure among Medicare patients. It helps
alleviate wrist pain, numbness and tingling in the thumb, index and
middle fingers.</LD>
<LD>   A new study, from Dr. Annette A.M. Gerritsen at the Institute for
Research in Extramural Medicine at Vrije Universiteit Medical Center
in Amsterdam, is the first to compare splints, which immobilize the
wrist, and surgery. Researchers randomly assigned 176 patients to two
groups: 89 were to wear splints at night for at least six weeks and
87 were to undergo surgery. The patients were evaluated by physical
therapists at one month, three months, six months and 12 months.</LD>
<TE>   After three months, 80% of the surgical patients had improved,
compared with 54% of the splint-wearers, according to the study
published in the current issue of the Journal of the American Medical
Assn. After 18 months, 90% of the surgery group reported improvement.</TE>
<TE>   Among the splinted group, 41% opted for surgery within the 18
months and 94% of those reported improvement. Those who stuck with
splinting alone had a 37% overall improvement rate.</TE>
<TE>   In an accompanying commentary, Dr. E.F. Shaw Wiggis, of the Curtis
National Hand Center at Union Memorial Hospital in Baltimore, noted
that many patients may not want to expose themselves to surgical
risks and potential complications. He advocated studies comparing
surgery to other types of treatment, such as anti-inflammatory
medications and acupuncture.</TE>

<HD>When It Comes to Food, We Fudge a Little</HD>
<DH>Diet* Men and women have a distorted perception of what
they eat and how much, overestimating the amount of healthy food.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLY SQUIRES</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How much--and what--do you really eat? If you're like most people,
the perception is very different from reality.</LD>
<LD>   "People have this notion that their diet is better than it is,"
said Adam Drewnowski, director of the nutritional sciences program at
the University of Washington in Seattle and author of several studies
on food intake.</LD>
<LD>   "People will say, 'Oh yeah, I drink orange juice every day.' " But
food record studies--the kind of research where participants record
everything that passes their lips for about two weeks--often show
otherwise, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Most people overestimate intake of healthful foods and--you may as
well confess right now--underestimate consumption of unhealthful
foods. But research also suggests some gender differences.</TE>
<TE>   For example, men tend to exaggerate their consumption of
vegetables, and women are more likely to underreport eating such
high-calorie foods as chocolate and ice cream, Drewnowski said.</TE>
<TE>   Those findings are echoed by a U.S. Department of Agriculture
survey of 5,700 adults. Conducted by the department's Center for
Nutrition Policy and Promotion and released in 2000, the survey found
striking differences between what participants thought they ate and
what they actually consumed.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the biggest gaps? Underestimating how many carbohydrates,
fats, oils and sweets were eaten and overestimating intake of fruit,
dairy products, meat, poultry, fish, beans, eggs and nuts, according
to Peter Basiotis, director of the center and lead author of the
study.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the breakdown of perception versus reality by food groups.
See how you compare:</TE>
<TE>   Grains:</TE>
<TE>   All adults believed they ate fewer of these carbohydrates (about
two to three servings daily) than they actually consumed (roughly
four to six servings per day). Even so, nearly all ate fewer than the
daily recommendations, which range from six to 11 servings per day.</TE>
<TE>   Fruit:</TE>
<TE>   Men and women thought they ate more fruit than they really
consumed. Men 19 to 50 years old were off the most, believing that
they ate two servings daily, when they actually consumed only one.
The recommendation is to eat three to four servings of fruit per day.</TE>
<TE>   Vegetables:</TE>
<TE>   Women were closest to the mark, perceiving that they consumed
about 2.5 servings per day and in reality eating slightly less than
two servings. But men and women fell short of the daily
recommendation of about three to five servings a day of vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   Milk/dairy foods:</TE>
<TE>   All participants skimped on milk products, believing that they ate
the recommended two to three servings per day. In truth, they
actually consumed between one and 1.6 servings daily.</TE>
<TE>   Meat/poultry/fish:</TE>
<TE>   Everybody's reality fell short on this one. All respondents
thought they consumed about three to four servings a day of these
foods, but their food diaries showed they ate between 1.6 and 2.5
servings a day.</TE>
<TE>   Fat, oils and sweets:</TE>
<TE>   Participants were certain that they ate only about two servings
per day of these high-calorie foods. The reality? They consumed three
to 4.5 servings per day.</TE>

exercise each day for good health and keeping your weight stable.
Here are some ways to meet that threshold:</LD>
<LD>   * 60 minutes of brisk walking every day at a 4 mph pace.</LD>
<LD>   * 15-minute walks twice during the workday, such as during a
coffee break and during lunch, plus a 30-minute walk with family

<HD>Smoking-Cessation Aids Show Waning Success</HD>
<DH>Study: Research shows that since nicotine replacement
products went over the counter, they are proving less effective in
the long term.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nicotine replacement products, such as gum and patches, have become
readily available in recent years, but their usefulness appears to be
waning when it comes to helping smokers quit for the long term.</LD>
<LD>   A new study by San Diego researchers found that smoking-cessation
aids were more helpful prior to the mid-1990s, when physicians had to
write a prescription for the products. But since becoming available
over the counter, the aids--which ease nicotine withdrawal
symptoms--have not proved beneficial in promoting long-term
cessation. The study, published in last week's Journal of the
American Medical Assn., is the first to examine the effectiveness of
nicotine replacement products in the general population.</LD>
<LD>   The authors, John P. Pierce and Elizabeth A. Gilpin of UC San
Diego's Cancer Prevention and Control Program, say more research
should be devoted to how to use the products effectively. For
example, the products may have worked better in their early years
because doctors selected the most appropriate candidates, and when
writing a prescription, were likely to instruct the patient on how to
best use the product. Moreover, doctors may have been more likely to
recommend behavioral counseling along with nicotine replacement.</LD>
<TE>   "They are helpful with withdrawal symptoms. But unless you do
something to handle the psychological dependence of smoking, people
are going to go back to smoking," Pierce says. "Smoking is much more
than a physiological addiction. It's a psychological addiction too."</TE>
<TE>   Since going over the counter, nicotine replacement therapies have
been heavily advertised on television and in the print media, Pierce
notes. But the ads rarely address the need for accompanying
behavioral therapy to increase the chances for success, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Pharmaceutical advertisements ... started treating [nicotine
replacement therapy] like it was a magic bullet," he says. "People
had the expectation that the drug would do everything. I think the
advertisements should say 'this will help you in quitting, but
remember you have to substitute other behaviors for smoking.' "</TE>
<TE>   By approving the products for over-the-counter use, federal health
officials may have been hoping that more people would have access to
them. But, Pierce says, nicotine replacement is being widely used "by
lighter smokers who many physicians would not have recommended it
to."</TE>
<TE>   The nicotine replacement products have no effect on helping these
light smokers quit, the study showed. More than one-third of all
users of nicotine-replacement products are light smokers, defined as
smoking fewer than 15 cigarettes a day.</TE>
<TE>   GlaxoSmithKline, makers of Nicorette gum and the NicoDerm skin
patch, took issue with the study, however, saying that other studies
have contradicted it.</TE>
<TE>   "For people who want to quit without such support programs, the
clinical evidence strongly suggests that [nicotine replacement
therapy] on its own approximately doubles the chances of success
compared to quitting without assistance," the company said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the company offers a personalized support program--an
online program or printed material that focuses on smoking
behavior--to consumers who purchase Nicorette or NicoDerm CQ.</TE>
<TE>   The new study analyzed data from more than 15,000 adult smokers
statewide who participated in annual California tobacco surveys in
1992, 1996 and 1999. Both the percentage of smokers trying to quit
and the use of smoking-cessation products increased over that
seven-year span.</TE>
<TE>   More than one-third of all smokers try to quit each year. Those
who seek assistance in quitting tend to be the most dependent
smokers, Pierce says.</TE>

<LD>Question: What are the benefits and liabilities of walking with hand
weights?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: I don't recommend dumbbells, wrist weights or ankle
weights for walking. Using them increases your risk of injury because
it can strain your neck, back and shoulders. The weights also can
throw off your body alignment, making it difficult to maintain
correct arm movements and proper posture. And weights that are light
enough to hold when walking aren't heavy enough to increase strength.
If the reason you use weights is to increase the intensity of your
walking workout, I'd suggest instead that you walk at a slightly
faster pace or include some hills on your route. To build muscle or
just tone up, take the time to work out with weights separately from
your walks.</LD>

<HD>Major Study Backs Removal of Prostate</HD>
<DH>Cancer* In a trial, radical surgery reduced the chance of
dying by almost half, in comparison with the strategy of 'watchful
waiting.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DELTHIA RICKS</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Surgically removing the prostate is superior to "watchful waiting," a
no-treatment tactic often pursued when cancers are small and confined
to the gland, medical researchers report in a major investigation
released last week.</LD>
<LD>   Zeroing in on one of the biggest controversies in medicine--how
best to treat early prostate cancer--the Swedish study of 695 men
shows that radical surgery can reduce by nearly half the chance of
dying from the disease.</LD>
<LD>   "I am thrilled with the findings. Absolutely thrilled," said Dr.
Patrick Walsh, director of urology at Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore. "There has been so much hype in the [medical] literature
about watchful waiting. This investigation put it to the test." Walsh
called the findings a landmark and said they add to the data that
doctors can share with patients seeking information about treatment.
Prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths among
men.</LD>
<TE>   "Surgery not only reduced death, it also reduced the probability
of distant metastases," Walsh said of prostate cancer spreading to
bones or other sites. Led by Dr. Lars Holmberg of the University
Hospital in Uppsala and reported in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, the study is the first large-scale trial in which surgery
and watchful waiting are compared. Half the group was given a radical
prostatectomy. The others were monitored periodically but not
treated. Men in the study lived in Sweden, Norway and Finland.</TE>
<TE>   Holmberg found six years after diagnosis that 31 men in the
watchful-waiting group died of prostate cancer compared with 16 who
had surgery. Deaths from all causes--other forms of cancer or medical
conditions--were not statistically meaningful, Holmberg said.
Watchful waiting is the primary standard of care in Scandinavia. It
evolved as an option worldwide because it allows men with local
tumors to avoid problems associated with prostate removal:
incontinence, bowel obstruction and erectile dysfunction.</TE>
<TE>   But Walsh said such problems are possibilities with untreated
tumors. "Local prostate cancer is a formidable enemy," he said. Dr.
Otis Brawley of the Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University in
Atlanta applauded the study but said another underway by the Veterans
Administration will probably produce less of a statistical difference
in the two approaches. Here, he said, doctors find smaller cancers
because of screening, not widely used in Scandinavia.</TE>

<HD>Seniors Also Need Their Shots</HD>
<DH>Inoculation * Studies show that most older Americans think
vaccinations are for kids and don't see the need to update
immunizations.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For many seniors, doctor visits, medications and treatments are all
parts of aging. But vaccinations, they assume, are not.</LD>
<LD>   Studies show that most older Americans believe shots are kid
stuff, more important for their grandchildren than for themselves.
This misconception could be fatal.</LD>
<LD>   Each year in the United States, nearly 40,000 adults die from
vaccine-preventable diseases or their complications. The American
Society of Internal Medicine says adults are about 100 times more
likely to die from vaccine-preventable diseases than children, yet
few older folks keep a record of immunizations or check with
physicians to be sure they are up to date.</LD>
<TE>   While children have a standard vaccination schedule well known to
pediatricians and parents, says Dr. John Shanley, an
infectious-disease specialist at the University of Connecticut Health
Center in Farmington, there is no comparable fixed schedule for
adults.</TE>
<TE>   "Adult immunization was a neglected area of medical management,"
said Shanley, who helped organize an adult immunization clinic at the
health center. "But over the past few years, there's been a
tremendous push to educate both the public and physicians on the
importance of immunizations for all ages."</TE>
<TE>   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the
American College of Physicians recommend the following immunizations
for adults:</TE>
<TE>   * Flu. The influenza vaccine is 70% to 90% effective in preventing
the flu. Influenza vaccine can prevent as much as 50% to 60% of
hospitalizations and 80% of deaths from influenza-related
complications among the elderly. Adults over 50 should get a flu shot
each year.</TE>
<TE>   * Pneumonia. This vaccine is about 60% effective in preventing
pneumococcal infections. Adults should get a shot every five years.</TE>
<TE>   * Tetanus. Many people know they need a tetanus shot if they step
on a rusty nail, but few realize the disease can be contracted other
ways. Puncture wounds can be infected with tetanus. Adults should get
a booster every 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   * Diphtheria. Immunization against this bacterial infection
usually is given in combination with the tetanus-pertussis vaccine.
Adults who have been vaccinated should get a booster every 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   * Hepatitis. There is a safe and effective vaccine for hepatitis A
and B infectious liver diseases. Hepatitis A can be spread by
infected individuals or by drinking water or eating shellfish
contaminated with the virus.</TE>
<TE>   "If you like shellfish, I would encourage you to get a hepatitis A
immunization. If you are an older adult traveling abroad, you should
get a hepatitis A vaccine," said Shanley.</TE>
<TE>   Adults often believe that the vaccines they received as children
will protect them for life. But some adults were never inoculated as
children; those who were might have received older, less effective
vaccines, and even among those who were properly vaccinated, immunity
can fade over time.</TE>

<HD>Are They Pulling Our Leg?</HD>
<DH>Studies find stretching does little to prevent injury</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANNE PARTIE LANGE and SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Much of what we know or think we know about fitness isn't based on
science. Take stretching.</LD>
<LD>   Trainers and coaches tell us that taking a few minutes to stretch
before and after exercise will prevent soreness and injury and
improve our ability to play the game or lift the weight. But
Australian researchers have reviewed studies considered
scientifically reliable and found that this revered practice does
little to protect us from harm.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1949, only six studies on muscle soreness and two on injury
risk have passed scientific muster, the researchers found. After
analyzing the data on soreness, they concluded that the beneficial
effects were so small that stretching couldn't be considered
worthwhile. The studies were all performed on healthy young adults
who typically stretched for five to 10 minutes. Analysis of the two
injury studies, both done on army recruits, revealed an insignificant
decrease in risk. "On average a person would have to stretch [before
and after exercise] for 23 years to prevent one injury," says Rob D.
Herbert, a coauthor of the study and lecturer at the University of
Sydney's School of Physiotherapy in New South Wales, Australia.</LD>
<TE>   The study, published in the Aug. 31 issue of the British Medical
Journal, also attempted to determine whether stretching improves
athletic performance. There aren't enough studies even to speculate
on that aspect, the authors found.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is a paucity of research on stretching, the
analysis challenges what is considered one of the fundamental
principles in athletic care, say Dr. Domhnall MacAuley, an Irish
doctor, and Dr. Thomas M. Best, a University of Wisconsin orthopedic
expert, in an editorial accompanying the study. They suggest the need
for more research on modern athletic practices that have little or no
scientific support. "Sport is rife with pseudoscience, and it is
difficult to disentangle the evangelical enthusiasm of the locker
room from research evidence," MacAuley and Best say.</TE>
<TE>   Best points out that there still could be some benefit to
stretching that research has yet to uncover. But accumulating
knowledge about muscle tissues suggests that the processes affecting
injury and muscle soreness are complex.</TE>
<TE>   "There is controversy about this," says Lynn Millar, a professor
of physical therapy at Andrews University in Berrien Springs, Mich.,
who studies flexibility. The lack of benefit associated with
stretching "may have to do with when the person is stretching. And
... the type of exercise you're doing." Millar says, stretches before
jogging--where the goal is to warm up muscles instead of relax
them--may be useless. But, a regular program of 30-second stretches
repeated three times for each muscle group could be helpful,
especially in activities that require quick motions, such as tennis
or racquetball.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a lot of evidence, period," Millar says. "But the
less rapid the activity, the less we need as far as stretching. If
you do light stretching on muscles that feel tight and start into the
activity slowly, that will probably be fine. But if I'm going to play
racquetball, I'll probably want to jog in place and then do a little
bit of extra stretching."</TE>
<TE>   Herbert says further research should examine whether prolonged
stretching by recreational athletes over months and years helps
reduce injury. Based on the evidence so far, it may be reasonable for
most people to give up stretching before a workout, Herbert says. "On
balance I think most recreational athletes could choose not to
stretch, but elite athletes might still stretch on the grounds that
there remains a small possibility of a preventive effect."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood history is replete with siblings who enjoyed success on the
big screen. Perhaps the most famous were the Barrymores--John, Ethel
and Lionel--who each had critically acclaimed film careers, with
Ethel and Lionel winning Academy Awards.</LD>
<LD>   The three even starred together in a film, "Rasputin and the
Emperess," in 1932.</LD>
<LD>   Others have included Warren Beatty and Shirley MacLaine, Julia and
Eric Roberts, Ralph and Joseph Fiennes, Dennis and Randy Quaid, John
and Joan Cusack, Barry Fitzgerald and Arthur Shields, George Sanders
(who played "The Saint") and brother Tom Conway (who played "The
Falcon") in the 1940s, Lawrence Tierney and Scott Brady, and Frank
and Ralph Morgan.</LD>
<TE>   Now comes rising young actors Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal
(pronounced JILL-en-hall), who, as luck would have it, each star in
separate movies coming out in the next two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Maggie, 24, stars with James Spader in the kinky dark comedy
"Secretary," which opens Friday. She plays a woman who takes a job as
a secretary to a strange lawyer who is into S&amp;M, which she finds a
turn-on.</TE>
<TE>   The following week, Jake, 21, co-stars with Dustin Hoffman and
Susan Sarandon in "Moonlight Mile," an emotional tale about a young
husband-to-be immobilized by the murder of his fiance.</TE>
<TE>   The actor first came to moviegoers' attention in "October Sky" and
also appeared with his sister in last year's "Donnie Darko," and
played opposite Jennifer Aniston in the current art house hit "The
Good Girl." Maggie, meanwhile, has appeared in such films as "Riding
in Cars With Boys" and the upcoming Nicolas Cage comedy,
"Adaptation."</TE>
<TE>   That both have pursued show business careers is less surprising
when you know that their parents are director Stephen Gyllenhaal
("Losing Isaiah," "Waterland") and writer Naomi Foner ("Losing
Isaiah" and "A Dangerous Woman").</TE>
<TE>   Sister and brother have thus far leaned toward roles in quirkier,
independent films, though "Moonlight Mile" is being released by
Disney and "Adaptation" (which reunites the "Being John Malkovitch"
writing-directing team of Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze) is being
released by Columbia.</TE>

<HD>A Timely Lull in New Album Releases</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the eeriest aftereffects of the Sept. 11 attacks last year
were skies utterly free of aircraft for days when all flights were
grounded.</LD>
<LD>   The record business faces an analogous situation a year later as
stores nationwide are virtually free of major new albums, a situation
usually limited to Christmas week.</LD>
<LD>   "We've felt it big time," says Tower Records' Southwest region
director, Bob Feterl. "We're going to end up OK, but up to this point
it's been pretty brutal."</LD>
<TE>   Most record companies opted to avoid scheduling major releases
last week, both out of respect for the one-year anniversary and out
of sheer pragmatism, knowing that people wouldn't be in the mood to
be scooping up new albums as usual.</TE>
<TE>   It was a double whammy for retailers, with the new-release scale
back immediately following the traditionally slow Labor Day weekend
and back-to-school week.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who did go ahead with new releases Sept. 10 were
industry maverick Ani DiFranco, who issued a double-CD live set, "So
Much Shouting, So Much Laughter," on her Righteous Babe label,
freshman rapper Shade Sheist ("Informal Introduction") and country
singer Aaron Tippin, whose new "Stars &amp; Stripes" album includes his
post-9/11 hit single "Where the Stars and Stripes and the Eagle Fly,"
making it seem fairer game for Sept. 11-week release.</TE>
<TE>   But don't look for any of those to dislodge the Dixie Chicks,
Eminem or Avril Lavigne from the top of Billboard's album chart when
new Nielsen SoundScan figures are released Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Of the new releases that did come out, there weren't any real big
sales stories there," says Wherehouse Entertainment senior pop buyer
Bob Bell.</TE>
<TE>   Retailers expect things to pick up as early as Tuesday, with the
arrival of new albums from Disturbed, Lifehouse and Kenny G. Then a
raft of potential hit albums lands Sept. 24 with new efforts from
Beck, India.Arie, Peter Gabriel and Uncle Kracker as well as the
widely anticipated Elvis Presley "30 No. 1 Hits" compilation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a temporary situation," Bell says. "It created a couple of
quiet weeks, but that's going to turn around very quickly. It's
nothing we're very concerned about."</TE>

<HD>Punk's Past Meets Its Present</HD>
<DH>At Saturday's Inland Invasion, elder statesmen and newer
acts tried to stay true to their anti-establishment roots amid an
event with corporate trappings</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Has anyone got a safety pin?"</LD>
<LD>   It seemed for a moment that John Lydon, back to his rotten ways on
stage with the Sex Pistols, was performing a credibility check on the
52,000 fans packed into Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion for a massive
punk-rock festival Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   It turned out, though, that, well, his nice new shirt just
wouldn't button properly. "Important part of my punk apparel," Lydon
sneered as he accepted a pin from the pit.</LD>
<TE>   Crises of punk fashion were everywhere Saturday in a strange, epic
and memorable day of music. The Inland Invasion stitched together a
bill of punk stars old and new, and more daringly, tried to make the
genre's anti-establishment ethos fit into an event sponsored by
Levi's at a venue with $20 parking spaces and ivory stretch limos
idling out front.</TE>
<TE>   The musical success of the all-day show was assured, though, with
searing sets by the Pistols and their fellow U.K. punk elder
statesmen (think about that concept) the Buzzcocks and the Damned.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern California punk strain, though, dominated the bill,
with longtime stalwarts X, Bad Religion and Social Distortion up
through the more pop-leaning acts of today, such as the Offspring,
Blink-182 and Unwritten Law. "This," said John Doe of X, "is the
desert bloom of punk rock."</TE>
<TE>   The feast brought fans from across the country and beyond, but
backstage, some of the artists conceded that the trappings of the
event gave them pause.</TE>
<TE>   "It's either going to be spectacular," said the Vandals' Warren
Fitzgerald, "or the biggest disaster ever and the end of punk."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Ness of Social Distortion viewed the day as a precarious step
in punk's ongoing ethical tightrope walk. "It's something I've had to
struggle with for years, the conflict in my mind.... Are we being
turned into the same kind of marketing tool and the things we
rebelled against? Or is it just that, 25 years in, punk has caught on
enough that it can change things and maybe open more minds?"</TE>
<TE>   In matters of punk credibility, not all minds were open Saturday.
The pairing of veteran and newer acts created some chasms on a day
when numbing heat and desert winds in the San Bernardino area, plus
the densely packed crowd, had already tested fans' patience.</TE>
<TE>   The young Florida band New Found Glory, for instance, had the
misfortune of taking the stage between X and the Buzzcocks. The
group's feckless, ragged set got some of the youngsters dancing on
the back lawn, but the older punk fans who were close to the stage
let loose with abuse that was both relentless and creatively lewd.</TE>
<TE>   The band, visibly shaken, chided the audience members who "weren't
very nice"--a response that, on analysis, is not very punk.</TE>
<TE>   What exactly is punk in 2002? The acts Saturday often shared
common ingredients in their sonic recipe, and each had the requisite
rebellion in its set. But the nature of their targets was revealing.
Bad Religion rebels against corrupt government, hatemongers and false
piety. Blink-182 rebels against gym teachers. The effect of their
playing back-to-back was jolting, the difference between a prank call
and a ransom demand.</TE>
<TE>   But Captain Sensible of the Damned says it's the act of
questioning, not necessarily the questions, that defines punk
sensibility. "It's about not compromising, not playing the game."</TE>
<TE>   Walking through the stands to check out the set by the Buzzcocks,
the Captain (his given name is Ray Burns) was stopped every few paces
by fans seeking a handshake, hug or autograph.</TE>
<TE>   He recalled gigs his band did in 1977 with the Buzzcocks when the
other band arrived with guitars that were down to four strings and
carried in grocery bags.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought in those days that something like this could
happen," he said, scanning the massive crowd. "Playing here in these
bloody mountains, in America, which I thought had completely given up
on this kind of music in the 1980s and 1990s and gone to
soul-destroying, long-hair metal music. It's amazing and wonderful.</TE>
<TE>   "And today, seeing a lot of familiar old faces, well, it's good to
see them playing and, you know, still alive."</TE>
<TE>   Punk remains a volatile world. On Saturday, there were several
stabbings and brawls near the second stage, where a large mosh pit
kicked up a two-story dust devil that left onlookers caked in brown.
Random bonfires added to the heat and hazard. No life-threatening
injuries were reported and the preliminary tally of six dozen arrests
was not unusual for an event of such size.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 11 acts played the main stage while six others hammered
out songs on the far more raucous secondary stage.</TE>
<TE>   The sophomoric lunacy of the Vandals inspired delirious howls from
the fans, especially when guitarist Fitzgerald took a turn on vocals,
wore his yellow gym shorts in a style that might be described as a
thong diaper and began exhorting the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're punk and you love it, scream 'Yeah!' " When the
expected response came back, Fitzgerald, perched on a tall amplifier,
shook his head in mock disdain. "That's so not punk! You're supposed
to yell 'No!' "</TE>
<TE>   The Offspring performance was one of the certifiable crowd
favorites, with the Orange County band's considerable storehouse of
radio hits and a mainstream take on punk that is still palatable to
many in the scene itself.</TE>
<TE>   Like classic rock icons, some of the punk generation heroes now
find themselves on stage with graying temples, paunches and voices
that have, like their tattoos, faded a shade or two. But the crowd
warmly embraced and cheered the veterans, and no main stage cheers
were louder than the ones for the show-closing Pistols, together for
the first time since their reunion six years ago. To set the tone,
Lydon's first words to the crowd involved a certain epithet and
Levi's and KROQ. That's punk rock.</TE>
<TE>   As Lydon pranced, scowled and cawed on stage with his coat-hanger
shoulder, he resembled some mad, preening crow. His bandmates were
far more reserved, although Steve Jones, who now has a Tony Soprano
physique, was intense and riveting in his guitar manipulations on
"Pretty Vacant" and other memorable Pistols tracks.</TE>
<TE>   When fans doused Lydon full-face with beers, he unleashed a
withering verbal attack, and he also took on a "long-hair hippie" he
spied in the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "You're in the wrong year.... In fact you're in the wrong decade,"
he screeched at the hapless fan.</TE>
<TE>   Then he offered a barb for himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Funny, me telling you that."</TE>

<HD>'Barbershop' Tops Off the Movie Field</HD>
<DH>Box office* Ice Cube's ensemble comedy opens in first
place; 'Wedding' passes $100 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GERMAIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Barbershop," the warmhearted ensemble comedy starring Ice Cube as
reluctant proprietor of his late father's business, premiered in
first place at the box office with $21 million over the weekend,
according to studio estimates Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The year's big sleeper hit, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," remained
in the No. 2 spot with $11 million, pushing its total to $110.7
million to become the 15th movie of 2002 to cross the $100-million
mark.</LD>
<LD>   And in its first weekend of fairly wide release, Robin Williams'
stalker thriller, "One Hour Photo," came in third, with $7.7 million.</LD>
<TE>   The weekend's other new wide release, Jason Lee and Tom Green's
crime comedy, "Stealing Harvard," premiered at No. 4 with $6.3
million, finishing slightly ahead of last weekend's top film,
"Swimfan," which grossed $6.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, box office revenues rose for the first time in nearly two
months. The top 12 movies took in an estimated $72 million, up 38%
from the same weekend last year, although that was a relatively slow
period in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Barbershop" played in 1,605 theaters and averaged a whopping
$13,084 a cinema.</TE>
<TE>   "'If you make a good movie, they'll come," said Peter Adee, head
of marketing for "Barbershop" distributor MGM. "I think there's a big
audience out there that goes to good movies, whether they're ethnic
or not. Just look at 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding.' "</TE>
<TE>   "Greek Wedding" added 69 locations to reach its widest release yet
at 1,764 theaters and average $6,254, an impressive figure
considering it has been out for five months.</TE>
<TE>   The romantic comedy starring its screenwriter, Nia Vardalos, and
John Corbett, cost just $5 million to make and could finish with a
domestic gross of $150 million to $160 million, said Rob Schwartz,
head of distribution for IFC Films, which released "Greek Wedding."</TE>
<TE>   "One Hour Photo" averaged $6,337 in 1,212 theaters. "Stealing
Harvard" played in 2,366 theaters and averaged a so-so $2,663.</TE>
<TE>   Besides "Barbershop," MGM had good news during the weekend with
the dark coming-of-age comedy "Igby Goes Down," which averaged
$31,918 at 10 theaters in New York City and Los Angeles. The film,
featuring Kieran Culkin, Susan Sarandon, Jeff Goldblum, Claire Danes
and Ryan Phillippe, will expand to more theaters during the next two
weekends.</TE>
<TE>   MGM is struggling to recover from a string of box office losers
such as "Windtalkers" and "Hart's War." With "Barbershop" and "Igby,"
the studio now has two solid lead-ins to an almost certain smash in
"Die Another Day," the 20th James Bond flick, which opens in
November.</TE>

<HD>Bowl Keeps Africa at a Distance in Fireworks Finale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Fireworks Finale--A Dream of Africa" at the Hollywood Bowl on Friday
(the opening of its three-night, summer-closing engagement) was
accurately titled, because the program, with the exception of Miriam
Makeba's set, largely represented African dreams rather than African
realities.</LD>
<LD>   In the opening segment, the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra under John
Mauceri offered selections drawn from African-themed film music by
Maurice Jarre, Alex North, John Barry and John Williams.</LD>
<LD>   Efficiently performed, it was music that for the most part
illustrated the dictum that the best film music is that which is
supportive but invisible to the action taking place on the screen.</LD>
<TE>   More intriguingly, there were excerpts from works by Nigerian
composer Fela Sowande and African American composer William Grant
Still. Even here, however, the emphasis seemed to be on demonstrating
expertise in Western European styles rather than attempting to
introduce elements from the vast vocabulary of African music.
"Caravan," the Ellington classic written by valve trombonist Juan
Tizol, somehow found its way into the program, introduced by Mauceri
in the context of the Sahara. (That may be what lyricist Irving Mills
had in mind, but one can only wonder if the thought ever occurred to
Tizol in the 1930s, when he was simply writing a piece to add to the
already large collection of Ellington's exotic pieces.)</TE>
<TE>   Makeba's set at least had a greater feeling of authenticity. She
has long been viewed as one of the veteran spokeswomen for Africa in
general and the South African anti-apartheid movement in particular.</TE>
<TE>   But the singer, generous to a fault, turned over a far too lengthy
segment of her performance to introductions and solos from each of
her musicians and backing singers. At 70, Makeba is very much at the
peak of her skills, and it would have been nice to hear the full
range of what this magnificent artist has to offer.</TE>
<TE>   The show-closing fireworks display was presented with music from
"The Lion King." But the combination of music and pyrotechnics seemed
surprisingly bland.</TE>

<HD>From Mexico, a Reverie in Movement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER FISHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was a strong sense of dreaming while dancing in two 45-minute
works presented by two Mexican modern dance companies making their
Southern California debuts Friday night at California Plaza downtown.
Perhaps it was the liberal use of slow-motion movement or the way
each piece followed an episodic score so closely. The result was
small, stylish movement essays that followed one another in a
meandering fashion.</LD>
<LD>   For Contradanza, a reverie-like drifting of limbs seemed a natural
choice for director-choreographer Cecilia Appleton's "Camas Con
Historias" (Beds With Stories). Five dancers wore bits of white
sleepwear that was sometimes just underwear, increasing their
vulnerability as they became involved in private moments or intimate
exchanges. Activity revolved around a mobile foam mattress, which
they crawled over, fell onto, manipulated, caressed and--once it was
on a frame--hid under, all without the kind of movement you would
normally do around a bed.</LD>
<LD>   At times there was an interesting construction of the spectators'
angle of vision: We appeared to be above a lone man with his crossed
legs propped against the upended mattress at one point, and, at
another, we witnessed from behind a seated couple wrestling fitfully
on the bed. Focus often shifted to new pairings or a solo of
breakaway restlessness.</LD>
<TE>   A series of songs by Meredith Monk (music was not credited on the
program) spurred changes of mood: To percolating rhythms and
polyrhythmic whispers, feet scrambled and legs got kicky; to a
wordlessly sung lullaby, a couple struggled with sharing weight and
balance.</TE>
<TE>   While personal anxieties played out on an intimate scale in
Appleton's piece, Contempodanza, also based in Mexico City, used
broader strokes and more stretched, formal postures in "Espejo de
Linces" (Lynx's Mirror). Choreographer and troupe director Cecilia
Lugo was inspired by Oscar Oliva's poem about the 1994 Zapatista
uprising in Chiapas. The dynamic commissioned score, by Joaquin Lopez
Chapman, included bits of that text, but no translation or indication
of Oliva's themes was provided.</TE>
<TE>   The bodies told a story of sculptural wariness, defiance and
exhaustion. But crouching and rising were always elegant, as were
steely, rippling arms and animal-like arching. Again, slow motion
reigned.</TE>
<TE>   The rippling of a giant purple cloth in one section represented
dangerous territory to cross, bringing to mind the silken "river" of
Cloud Gate's famous "Crossing the Black Water" by Lin Hwai-min, or
the billowing silk cloud in Jii Kylian's "Petite Mort." But
Contempodanza's stylish black costumes and sometimes showy
articulations of hips and shoulders seemed to call attention more to
the dancers' dramatic bodies than to the subject matter.</TE>
<TE>   A short, unannounced opening piece by Contempodanza was less
ambitious but perhaps more trenchant in matching movement to mood. In
"Nicolasa," to Arturo Marquez's Danzon #2, three women wearing slinky
red dresses showed niftily how to keep amused with rhythm and style
when no partners have shown up.</TE>
<TE>   It's possible that the open spaces of California Plaza mitigate
against long pieces that depend on establishing an atmosphere over
quiet stretches of time. Then again, the moods seemed to appeal to
the vocal audience that supported these representatives of a strong
modern dance scene in Mexico City, and a fleshing out of Mexican
talents in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>How 'Big Deals' Were Made</HD>
<DH>An engaging four-part History Channel series looks back at
the power, egos and intrigue--a chapter on Babe Ruth is a particular
highlight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Sony set its sights on Columbia Pictures in 1989, the plot
twists were like something out of a movie--a costly one.</LD>
<LD>   The Japanese giant badly wanted Peter Guber and Jon Peters, the
ponytailed lawyer and the former hairdresser, to head the studio,
which meant buying their production company as well as their
services.</LD>
<LD>   When Sony's chairman reluctantly agreed to their price but
insisted on securing a deal for Columbia first, the duo countered
with a now-or-never ultimatum. Sony blinked. Its commitments
snowballed. After paying full retail for Columbia, Sony met another
hitch: the apparent formality of getting Guber and Peters out of
their Warner Bros. distribution pact. Sony supposedly slighted
Warner's chief by approaching an underling first, a blunder that
spurred a billion-dollar lawsuit. All told, Sony's ticket to
Hollywood ended up costing $6 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Ego, leverage and timing are among the common factors in the
high-stakes showdowns that have become turning points in corporate
history, as the History Channel shows in an engaging miniseries, "Big
Deals: The Good, the Bad &amp; the Ugly."</TE>
<TE>   The series, hosted by Geoff Colvin from Fortune magazine, starts
tonight with a 90-minute doubleheader: the Sony saga followed by a
look at the sale of Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees for $100,000 in
1919, a deal that still needs to be discussed gingerly in the
presence of Boston Red Sox fans.</TE>
<TE>   One-hour installments follow over the next three nights. Tuesday's
show explores the interlocking deals in 1980 that turned Microsoft
into, well, Microsoft, and the fight for control of "I Love Lucy,"
which helped change how TV shows are made and distributed.
Wednesday's episode covers Seagram's controversial gamble on MCA
Entertainment and Ray Kroc's lopsided deal with the brothers who
founded McDonald's. Thursday is devoted to the battle over
RJR/Nabisco during the 1980s leveraged-buyout boom.</TE>
<TE>   The production tries too hard at times to stir drama, with
insistent music and corny (but mercifully short) reenactments of
boardroom faceoffs. Even so, the interviews with central players and
historians are insightful, and the Ruth chapter is especially fun.</TE>
<TE>   In Boston, fans say the decision by owner Harry Frazee to sell
Ruth jinxed the franchise, creating "the curse of the Bambino." If
that sounds farfetched, the scoreboard says the Yanks have since won
26 World Series championships, becoming arguably the most successful
sports team ever, and the Sox none.</TE>
<TE>   Frazee, who saw Ruth as a self-centered distraction, figured he
could bolster his whole team by buying other players with the cash.
Of course, the Bambino flourished in the New York limelight,
clobbering his home run record with 54 the next year in a taste of
things to come.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his infamy, Frazee made out financially, selling the Sox a
few years later at a hefty profit.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to believe that Harry Frazee knew what he was doing," said
Boston sports columnist Dan Shaughnessy. "He made a bad baseball move
in the interest of his own finances."</TE>
<TE>   In the deal-making game, everyone has their own strategy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Big Deals: The Good, the Bad &amp; the Ugly" can be seen at 9 p.m.
today through Thursday on the History Channel. The series is rated
TV-G (suitable for all ages).</TE>

<HD>World Festival Reaches Wide to Celebrate Quest for
Spirituality</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The World Festival of Sacred Music opened its two-week series of
Southland programs Saturday night with a lengthy, multihued program
at UCLA's Royce Hall. Ambitious in scope and content, its programming
symbolized the broad reach of the entire series via the presentation
of music reaching across the globe from India and Tibet to Africa,
Cuba and the United States.</LD>
<LD>   At the core of the performances rested the inextricable link
between music expression and the quest for meaning within the
infinite that is the goal of all spiritual pursuits. And what was
most fascinating about this concert--and, in fact, what is most
compelling about the entire festival schedule--is the extraordinary
diversity of means that humankind has employed, over thousands of
years, in its efforts to accomplish that goal.</LD>
<LD>   Humanity's first musical instrument was surely the voice,
imitating sounds of nature, furthering communication, accompanying
work and celebrating communal gatherings. Vocal sounds undoubtedly
also played a significant role in the mysteries of early
spirituality, perhaps not unlike the animalistic similes associated
with the many still existent shamanistic rituals. And the
call-and-response pattern--clearly established very early as an
interactive expression between individual and group--was a natural
use of sound and rhythm as an organizing technique, present in
virtually every musical culture.</LD>
<TE>   The importance of the voice was identified at the start of the
Royce program via the presence of the Zangdokpalri Monks and Nuns of
Tibet, led by Kunzang Dechen Lingpa. Although the seven-voice
ensemble accompanied themselves with two-headed drums, bells and
thighbone trumpets, it was their chanting that was at the heart of
their richly meditative presentation.</TE>
<TE>   The vocalized repetitions are intended, in Buddhist practice, to
establish an atmosphere for internal visualizations in an effort to
purify the corporeal gates and clear internal blockages. The
Zangdokpalri Monks and Nuns offered a series of relatively brief
examples of the process, establishing a remarkably pensive spiritual
atmosphere within the distinctly non-pensive environs of Royce Hall.</TE>
<TE>   In music's long passage through history, after the voice came the
drum. And the second group of performers on the opening-night
concert--Puerto Rican-born master drummer Angel Ruben Maldonado Cruz
("Cachete") and his ensemble Los Majaderos--illustrated one of the
ways in which percussion became linked with the voice.</TE>
<TE>   His group, which included four drummers (including himself) and
three singers, moved across the spectrum of Afro-Caribbean musical
culture, colorfully exploring sounds ranging from the bata drumming
of Cuba's Santeria tradition to the secular sounds of the rumba. The
music was both visceral and hypnotic--as trance-inducing as the
efforts of the Zangdokpalri performers, although in a completely
different fashion, at the service of completely different artistic
and spiritual goals.</TE>
<TE>   Flutes and stringed instruments were the likely followers of voice
and percussion. The former arrived initially as perhaps accidental
discoveries, particularly attractive for their capacity to mimic the
sounds of birds and small animals. And, once the bow was created as a
method of propelling arrows, it also arrived as a sound-making
device, initially via a single string, eventually via the
multiplicity of forms that followed.</TE>
<TE>   Prince Diabate, whose large, colorfully garbed ensemble closed the
opening half of the festival opener, is a master kora player from
Guinea, West Africa. The instrument's unique structure--a set of
strings attached to a pole extending out of a large, resonating
gourd--is found throughout Africa, undoubtedly the sophisticated
contemporary end product of centuries of instrumental evolution.</TE>
<TE>   The descendant of a long line of Guinean griots--the storytelling
carriers of history in many African cultures--Diabate is also a
determinedly contemporary artist. Connecting his kora to electronic
amplification, strutting the stage in rock guitarist manner (he has
been described as the "Jimi Hendrix of the kora") and offering music
combining African instruments (the xylophone-like balafon) and the
tambin (a flute from the Fulani people) with electric guitar, bass
and occasional funk rhythms, his music was more culturally
heterogeneous than spiritually convincing. But the "animation"
dancing of Mariatou Camara--present on too few numbers--maintained a
more direct connection with African roots.</TE>
<TE>   Like so many other aspects of contemporary society, the festival
opener was confronted with the reality of the post-Sept. 11 world
when the originally scheduled qawwali singer Rahat Nusrat Fateh Ali
Khan was, at the last minute, unable to fly to Los Angeles from his
native Pakistan. Fortunately, a superb replacement was available:
Indian vocal artist Lakshmi Shankar.</TE>
<TE>   In Indian classical music, the voice, the drum and stringed
instruments reach an extraordinary level of sophistication without in
any way abandoning implicit spiritual connections. Shankar's
marvelous presentation--beginning with a classical kheyal and
continuing with a lighter thumri--was both an extraordinary example
of vocal mastery and an illustration of manner in which Indian
classical music, with its vast array of ragas and talas, all
associated with spiritual factors, links the root sources of music to
its most complex manifestation.</TE>
<TE>   It was a bit strange, however, to hear Shankar performing with an
ensemble that was reportedly scheduled to appear with Khan, the
combination resulting in an odd blend of classical Indian
vocalization accompanied in qawwali style.</TE>
<TE>   The climactic event of the long evening was the performance of a
set of Duke Ellington's sacred music by the Luckman Jazz Orchestra,
led by James Newton--yet another example of the most contemporary
manifestation of spiritual artistry.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the orchestra was not well served by the audio
engineers, who imposed a notion of sound reproduction that almost
completely distorted the ensemble's sound.</TE>
<TE>   It was bad enough that the piano, bass and drums--as so often
happens in big band concerts--were amplified well beyond the level of
the 13 horn players. But, even worse, tuba player William Roper's
horn (which was directed toward its own microphone) was reproduced so
loudly that the gorgeous ensemble textures of the Ellington score
were blown away.</TE>
<TE>   And that was a shame, since the orchestra played superbly, with
fine soloing from saxophonists Jack Nimitz and Frederick Keith
Fiddmont, trumpeters Bobby Rodriguez and Nolan Shaheed and pianist
Lanny Hartley (among others).</TE>
<TE>   Less can be said of the two vocal soloists, Henrietta Davis and
Cedric Berry, who would do well to pay more attention to the majesty
of the Ellington score than to the sound of their own voices.</TE>
<TE>   (One hopes the Luckman orchestra's performance of a more extended
program of Ellington's sacred music on Saturday at the Faithful
Central Bible Church will offer a more faithful reproduction of the
ensemble's exceptional playing.)</TE>
<TE>   A performance by the amazing young tap dancer Landry Barb II ended
the concert on an upbeat note, his enthusiasm and vitality providing
a compelling example of the unspoken, unspecific quality of
spirituality that is always present in music that touches the heart.</TE>

in ABC's "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter."</LD>
<LD>   As for mothers, Bonnie Hunt is again chaotic, only this time as a
zoned-out, minor-celebrity parent of four in ABC's "Life With
Bonnie." Based on its pilot episode, it may be the funniest of this
season' new comedies.</LD>
<TE>   Not much fun at all, though, is the ABC drama "Push, Nevada,"
which is not about parenting. But ... uh ... what is it about?</TE>
<TE>   "Everwood" is about life in a small town nestled picturesquely in
the showy Colorado Rockies. That's where New York neurosurgeon Andrew
Brown (Williams) has relocated with his two kids, after abruptly
uprooting them from Manhattan following the death of his wife in a
car accident. With his new beard, jeans and wardrobe of plaid shirts,
he's now a walking ad for Lands' End while starting a general
practice in an abandoned train depot that looks as if it was whipped
into woodsy chic by Martha Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   The vicarious appeal here should be obvious: a new start and
simpler life in a gorgeous spot where, if you've got big bucks like
Brown, you can live off your wealth and not bother to charge
patients.</TE>
<TE>   But oh-oh. Everwood already has a doctor. He's Harold Abbott (Tom
Amandes), who does charge for his services. Which means he's furious
at Brown for even showing up, to say nothing of starting a free
clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Brown's 15-year-old son, Ephram (Gregory Smith), is even angrier
at his dad, blaming him for his mother's death while failing to adapt
to his new environment as well as his 9-year-old sister, Delia
(Vivien Cardone), whose Colorado Rockies cap symbolizes her
acceptance.</TE>
<TE>   "Everwood" at times overcomes its urban-to-boonies stock TV
premise. Unlike much of prime-time drama, it pauses to mourn death
with sensitivity, and even has Brown regularly engage in
hallucinatory chats with his dead wife as he continues to feel the
ache of grief. And there's an explosive argument here between Andrew
and resentful Ephram (easily the show's most arresting character)
that is memorable for its searing, raw emotion.</TE>
<TE>   Yet otherwise, "Everwood" has much going against it, most notably
an absence of subtlety that undermines Brown and others. He is so
arrogant and smug (with a bedside manner bordering on the smarmy)
that he's likable only compared with his conveniently snotty and
mean-spirited rival. It's a stretch, by the way, that Abbott would be
the only doctor in this rather cosmopolitan hamlet of 9,000 prior to
Brown's arrival.</TE>
<TE>   Also a stretch is how kids here repeatedly speak mature lines
inconsistent with their tender ages. "It's a big step for me," little
Delia tells her dad when starting school in Everwood.</TE>
<TE>   Big Stretches are the soul of ABC's routine new sitcom starring
Ritter, an actor whose skills at comedy surpass his taste in
material.</TE>
<TE>   Ritter's obsessive-compulsive father in "8 Simple Rules ... " is
as grating as Andrew Brown in "Everwood." Just as the doctor's former
career track severed him from parenting, so has Paul Hennessy's
travels as a sports writer kept him from his kids. But now he's
writing a sports column from home, allowing him to laser-in
protectively on his voluptuous 16-year-old daughter, Bridget (Kaley
Cuoco). Meanwhile, his wife, Cate (Katey Sagal), is off being a
hospital nurse, and their bookish 15-year-old daughter, Kerry (Amy
Davidson), focuses on school, and 13-year-old son Rory (Martin
Spanjers) revels in boyish mischief.</TE>
<TE>   So ... Hennessey plays the strict parent, buffoonishly smothering
with attention his thong-wearing older daughter whom a sports
colleague calls "hot," while coming down repressively on her new
boyfriend. "If you make her cry," he warns the kid when he arrives
for Bridget, "I will make you cry."</TE>
<TE>   Even for empathizing parents, this should be enough already.</TE>
<TE>   "Simple Rules" has some nice moments, notably Kerry's caustic
wisecracks. And in a future episode, when Hennessey opens the front
door from the inside to discover Bridget kissing a boy on the porch,
she protests: "Daddy, don't you knock?"</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, however, this is one of those broadly played
comedies that needs reining in and writing sharper than having Ritter
play super dad in what, essentially, is a single-parent comedy. When
"8 Simple Rules" turns maudlin and syrupy regarding parent and
child--as family comedies so often do when trying to show they aren't
entirely frivolous--then you're the one crying.</TE>
<TE>   From pain.</TE>
<TE>   So thank goodness for Hunt, whose new ABC comedy features her
signature running patter, much of it laugh-out-loud funny as she
plays the host of "Morning Chicago," one of those decadent local TV
shows that welcomes guests passing through town and feature cooking
segments in which food becomes almost an afterthought.</TE>
<TE>   Host Bonnie Molloy to a pair of chefs cooking with vino: "That
wine is so strong ... you're both getting better looking."</TE>
<TE>   Hunt is still trying to become an overnight TV sensation after all
these years. While doing well in other venues, success in sitcomdom
has eluded her, and her 1995 comedy for CBS earned more critical
plaudits than viewers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to starring, Hunt writes, directs and produces "Life
With Bonnie." Its quasi-improv environment is perfectly tailored to
her volcanic energy that gushes effortlessly Tuesday night, whether
she's on the home front or the talk-show set with gifted David Alan
Grier as her director.</TE>
<TE>   The episode opens with Bonnie in a witty frenzy--trying to leave
the house with her husband but getting nowhere--and ends
self-effacingly with her not getting the celebrity treatment she
expects while dining out.</TE>
<TE>   Although pilots can be deceptive, this one plays extremely well.</TE>
<TE>   The premiere of "Push, Nevada" doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   Reading about its advertised plot tics and glittery guest list is
more fun than watching it. Billed as both a game show and a drama, it
tries for off-center "Twin Peaks"-ian humor and murkiness, shooting
its subjects in extreme close-up from odd angles. Instead it's David
Lynch lite, for "Push, Nevada" initially lacks the seductive
screwball quality and dark irony that he and Mark Frost gave their TV
experiment of the early 1990s. And even "Twin Peaks" attracted few
viewers.</TE>
<TE>   This series is worth some looks just to see what's what. But
watching the premiere--written by movie star Ben Affleck and his
partner, Sean Bailey, who are executive producers--demands patience.
"If you're going to stay in Push, Nev.," IRS Agent Jim Prufrock
(Derek Cecil) is advised when arriving in this dusty burg to
investigate a financial scam, "take your time." I'll say. This is a
languid slow dance (no wonder there's a slow-dance bar in Push) whose
smoky dialogue makes it all the more deadly as Prufrock searches for
a casino boss named Silas Bodnick (Jon Polito).</TE>
<TE>   Deployed throughout the series are clues that supposedly tip
viewers on the whereabouts of a pile of missing money, and being
first to guess the location can earn you perhaps $1 million. That may
keep you awake, but not much else will.</TE>
<TE>   "Everwood" will air Mondays at 8 p.m. on the WB. The network has
rated it TV-PGDL (may be unsuitable for young children due to coarse
or suggestive dialogue).</TE>
<TE>   "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter" will air Tuesdays
at 8 p.m. on ABC. The network has rated it TV-PGDL (may be unsuitable
for young children due to coarse or suggestive dialogue).</TE>
<TE>   "Life With Bonnie" will air at 9 p.m. Tuesdays on ABC. The network
has rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable for young children).</TE>
<TE>   "Push, Nevada" will premiere at 9 p.m. Tuesday, then run regularly
at 9 p.m. Thursdays on ABC. The network has rated it TV-14LV (may be
unsuitable for children under 14, due to language and violence);
Tuesday's premiere has been rated TV-14SV (may be unsuitable for
children under 14, due to images of sex and violence).</TE>
<TE>   Howard Rosenberg's column appears Mondays and Fridays. He can be

<HD>Clayson to Exit CBS' 'Early Show'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>CBS News has finally made one decision about the future of "The Early
Show": Co-host Jane Clayson will leave the third-place morning
program at the end of the month.</LD>
<LD>   After weeks of speculation, the network is expected to announce
today that Clayson will return to reporting, which is what got her
noticed at ABC News before she was hired at CBS. Effective Sept. 30,
she'll become a correspondent for the "CBS Evening News," working
mostly on the lengthier "Eye on America" investigative and enterprise
pieces. She'll also be a substitute CBS News anchor and do work for
the renamed prime-time newsmagazine "48 Hours Investigates."</LD>
<LD>   Clayson, who has been with "The Early Show" since it was launched
in November 1999, has soldiered on opposite a series of guest
co-anchors since Bryant Gumbel departed in May. CBS has taken its
time trying to figure out what to do with the show since Gumbel's
exit, after one possible quick fix--hiring Meredith Vieira from ABC's
"The View"--didn't pan out.</LD>
<TE>   Although the Gumbel-Clayson team, which operated out of a new
street-level studio across from Manhattan's Central Park, improved
CBS' morning appeal among younger viewers, it never made much of a
dent against NBC's top-rated "Today" show and ABC's "Good Morning
America," which has recently made strides, although it remains in
second place.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long summer, it's been a challenging summer, to try
to juggle all the different personalities that have been there and to
react to their strengths and weaknesses," Clayson said Sunday. "But I
think it's just further strengthened my skills. It's been a great
three years and I would not change a minute of it. Now I'm looking
forward to returning back to my roots in good, solid journalism."</TE>
<TE>   Clayson, 35, is expected to stay on morning duty through Sept. 27.
It's unclear whether CBS will have a new team set to take over then
or will continue with guest hosts. The network's decision to go with
two new hosts in the morning is unusual because that's a time period
when sleepy viewers are thought to prefer continuity.</TE>
<TE>   Clayson said she's proud of some "Early Show" accomplishments,
including the fact that "for the first time, the time slot became
very, very profitable for CBS."</TE>

<LD>A young, middle-class married couple in their mid-20s, Guillermo and
Luisa came to the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim on Friday night for two
very different reasons.</LD>
<LD>   Luisa, a native of El Salvador, would never miss a local
appearance by her favorite rock en espanol band: Jaguares.</LD>
<LD>   Guillermo, born in Los Angeles of Mexican descent, drove to the
Pond knowing he would finally get to see the British pop-rock icon he
idolized as a teenager: Morrissey.</LD>
<TE>   Sitting next to the couple was Guillermo's sister Alejandra, 19,
who considers herself a fan of Jaguares and Morrissey.</TE>
<TE>   "They're sort of similar, in a weird way," she said while the
opening act, Jumbo, was taking the stage. "Not musically, of course.
But they have a common sensibility, a darkness in their lyrics that
unites them somehow."</TE>
<TE>   Alejandra was not the only one to feel this connection at Friday's
intriguing pairing of Mexico's rock stars and England's enfant
terrible.</TE>
<TE>   Morrissey's decision to accept Jaguares' invitation and perform
three dates for their predominantly Latino audience makes sense: The
singer is surprisingly popular among Mexicans and Mexican Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The acceptance of this sexually ambiguous pop star by Mexico's
macho society has puzzled some observers.</TE>
<TE>   But Mexico's take on machismo is accompanied by a full embrace of
melodrama and sentimentality, which explains why an effeminate
performer such as Juan Gabriel is venerated as a national hero in
Mexico, and perhaps why the ever-melodramatic Morrissey has made a
connection.</TE>
<TE>   At the Pond, the former leader of the Smiths wisely ignored all
these matters. Besides the occasional "Hola, Los Angeles," he didn't
address the ethnic issues during a tuneful performance that was all
about Morrissey the naughty poet, the mischievous bohemian, the
self-pitying fatalist.</TE>
<TE>   The singer, who lives in Los Angeles and has not released an album
of new material in five years, is in talks about a possible deal,
according to a representative. He performed some new songs Friday,
including a mournful ballad called "Mexico," whose chorus went, "It
seems if you're rich and you're white/You'll be all right/I just
don't see why this should be so."</TE>
<TE>   That song, like Morrissey's entire set, was received warmly. But
Jaguares created the evening's strongest impression. Now a sextet,
the band has been at its peak since last year's release of the
morbidly atmospheric album, "Cuando La Sangre Galopa."</TE>
<TE>   Augmented by touches of percussion and reeds, the group's current
incarnation is a machine of unstoppable intensity (think 1974's King
Crimson or 1983's U2). The enriched lineup was particularly effective
when previewing songs from Jaguares' forthcoming album, including a
new, austere version of the old favorite "Detras de los Cerros," as
well as a rendition of Juan Gabriel's "Te Lo Pido Por Favor" that
found singer Saul Hernandez drowning its lyrics in a sea of anguish
and romantic despair.</TE>
<TE>   As always, Hernandez's rapport with the audience mirrored his
"we're all one" philosophy. Before ushering in a mariachi ensemble
for a celebrative coda of authentic rancheras, he commented on the
event's underlying message.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's prove something tonight," he said to the enraptured crowd.
"Let's demonstrate that uniting cultures is more important than
making money."</TE>

<HD>Number of Gay TV Characters Plummets</HD>
<DH>Television* In spite of the sharp decline on scripted
series, due to the cancellation of several notable shows, activists
see increasing acceptance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Martin gazed out at the Hollywood crowd as he hosted last
year's Oscars and tried to surmise what the vast television audience
must be thinking: "They're all gay," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Yet for all the jokes about the entertainment industry
embracing--or, in the eyes of religious conservatives, promoting--the
cause of gays and lesbians, this year's prime-time lineup will
actually witness a sharp decline in the number of regular or
recurring gay, lesbian and transgender characters.</LD>
<LD>   According to data compiled by the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation, or GLAAD, the major TV networks featured 20 such
characters in prime time last season, scattered across 16
series--including since-canceled "The Ellen Show," starring Ellen
DeGeneres; and "The Education of Max Bickford," with actress Helen
Shaver playing a man who became a woman.</LD>
<TE>   By contrast, the current season opens with just seven gay or
lesbian characters (all of them white) on a half-dozen shows. Two
midseason programs also contain gay roles, including "Charlie
Lawrence," a CBS sitcom starring Nathan Lane as a gay congressman.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the decrease stems from the cancellation of nearly a dozen
series that showcased gay characters, including "Spin City," "Once
and Again" and "Felicity." In addition, many new shows are procedural
in nature, such as the spinoff "CSI: Miami," dealing with
crime-solving instead of delving into personal lives.</TE>
<TE>   "By no means are we saying anyone's being homophobic because these
shows got canceled," said Scott Seomin, GLAAD's entertainment media
director, who added that he is nevertheless concerned the networks
are steering clear of such material--consciously or not--in their
desire to serve up the equivalent of "comfort food" in the wake of
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Knight, director of the Washington, D.C.-based Culture and
Family Institute, contends that is precisely what's happening, with
the networks skirting "social hot buttons" despite what he sees as a
bias in favor of gay rights that exceeds public acceptance.</TE>
<TE>   "The number of gay characters in recent years reflects Hollywood's
commitment to the homosexual agenda," Knight said. "Post-9/11, they
may find it to be a harder sell with viewers. It doesn't really fit
in with home and hearth."</TE>
<TE>   Gay rights advocates stress that their goals remain unchanged,
which is to see gay and lesbian characters presented organically in
prime time, without fanfare or controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "What we really want to see is matter-of-fact inclusion," Seomin
said. "We're not asking producers to make 'Gay Dramas,' with a
capital 'G' and a capital 'D.' "</TE>
<TE>   At least some additional inclusion is likely forthcoming. The ABC
drama "MDs" added a gay character after the prototype was shot, and a
spokeswoman for CBS' new series "Presidio Med" (which airs opposite
"MDs") said there are plans to include gays and lesbians. Both
medical programs are set in San Francisco, where there is a large gay
community.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, GLAAD's tally for the networks' scripted programs paints
an incomplete picture--omitting fare such as Showtime's "Queer as
Folk," a pay cable series based in the gay community that depicts
explicit sexual situations. Gays are also prominently featured in
HBO's "Sex and the City," "Six Feet Under" and "The Wire."</TE>
<TE>   "Queer as Folk" executive producers Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman
point out that premium channels have far greater latitude than
broadcasters, which, they say, primarily use gay characters as comic
relief and fastidiously avoid their sex lives.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the networks have ever been happy dealing with gay
characters at all. They're quite happy to give that job to cable,"
Cowen said, adding that in regard to this season's perceived "comfort
food" mentality, "Everybody wants to stick their head in the sand and
pretend it's 1962."</TE>
<TE>   Lipman attributes that skittishness to broadcasting's reliance on
advertisers, many of whom remain cautious about sponsoring programs
that might alienate viewers. By contrast, Showtime hoped media buzz
about "Folk's" racy sex scenes would help promote the show. "For
cable, of course, controversy is its mainstay," Lipman said.</TE>
<TE>   Focusing on network dramas and comedies also overlooks unscripted
series, which have almost uniformly incorporated gay contestants. In
fact, the new edition of CBS' "The Amazing Race"--pitting various
teams against each other in a race around the world--includes a
conservative father traveling with his gay son, a woman paired with
her gay best friend, and two brothers, one of whom is gay.</TE>
<TE>   GLAAD's Seomin lauded CBS for its commitment to
diversity--especially within unscripted programs, going back to
Richard Hatch on the first "Survivor." Peter Golden, the network's
senior vice president of casting, said the hope is a varied roster of
contestants will attract the widest audience and that the central
mandate is to "cast" compelling personalities.</TE>
<TE>   "We look for people that will make dynamic and interesting
television," he said. "That's the first order of business."</TE>
<TE>   As it stands, the volume of gay-related programming across the TV
dial is such that a local comic, who calls himself Gay Boy Ric,
issues a daily "Gay TV" update via the Internet and to selected
newspapers, highlighting programs of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Alluding to talk by two companies about launching a gay cable
channel, Ric pointed to last Thursday--when viewers could flip from a
gay character in CBS' "Big Brother" to NBC's "Will &amp; Grace" to "a
fake gay marriage between two fake gay wrestlers" on "WWE Smackdown!"</TE>
<TE>   "Simply by changing the channel, you can almost create your own
gay network," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps for that reason, some gay activists are not overly
concerned about the decline in representation this fall, saying raw
numbers are less significant than the general atmosphere of
acceptance. From that perspective, John Aravosis, who led the
campaign against Dr. Laura Schlessinger's TV show, said he has seen
steady progress on television--citing Fox News Channel host Bill
O'Reilly's outspoken support of tolerance toward homosexuals as a
recent example.</TE>

<HD>Will They Find Pharaoh or Geraldo?</HD>
<DH>Tonight, archeologists and robotocists try to open a
long-closed door on 'Pyramids Live: Secret Chambers Revealed.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hidden passageways are the lifeblood of archeological fiction. In
books and movies, overlooked hallways and hidden doors always open
onto mysterious shrines or fabulous riches, sometimes both.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight, the Fox network will try to capture some of that mystique
when a group of archeologists and robotocists will attempt to look
behind a mysterious door hidden deep within the Great Pyramid of
Giza. The program will be broadcast live in the East, but
tape-delayed here.</LD>
<LD>   Although the team is hoping for a unique perspective on the
builders of the pyramid and some onlookers think the opening might
reveal the mummy of the Pharaoh Khufu, it is not clear whether the
team will find statuary and treasures or an empty chamber reminiscent
of Al Capone's vault, famously opened live on television by Geraldo
Rivera.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a total crap shoot," said archeologist Mark Lehner, one of
the program's hosts.</TE>
<TE>   The narrow shaft projects upward from the lower chamber, or
Queen's Chamber, inside the pyramid, built about 4,500 years ago.
Archeologists at the turn of the last century plumbed the shaft with
pipes and concluded that it ended after about nine feet.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, however, German robotocist Rudolf Gantenbrink sent his
own tank-like robot into the shaft and found that it did not end, but
veered upward at a 45-degree angle. Most of the shaft was composed of
the same rough-hewn local limestone from which the entire pyramid is
constructed.</TE>
<TE>   But about five feet from the end of the passage, the texture
changed abruptly. The remainder was lined with highly polished white
Turah limestone, which has been used in the entryways to chambers in
other tombs. And at the end was what appeared to be a sliding door,
made of the same Turah limestone with tongue-and-groove fittings on
the side that suggest it can be raised and lowered.</TE>
<TE>   This "door" has two corroded copper fittings in the center; a
piece of one fitting has broken off and was found lying in front of
the stone. A small gap is present at the base of the stone, but the
camera on the original robot could not peer though it.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Dave Barrett of iRobot, Inc. has developed a shoebox-sized
robot that he hopes will finally solve the mystery of the passageway.
The robot has sticky rubberized tracks on top and bottom that will
allow it to pass quickly through the tunnel carrying one of six
different instrument packages, including ground-penetrating radar, an
ultrasonic thickness sensor, a metal conductivity sensor and, of
course, a fiber-optic camera.</TE>
<TE>   On tonight's telecast, the team will attempt to determine how
thick the stone door is, whether there is a chamber behind it and, if
there is, what is in it.</TE>
<TE>   While that's going on, the two-hour show will have plenty of other
entertainment. Archeologist Zahi Hawass, head of Egypt's antiquities
department, recently discovered a granite sarcophagus in the
graveyard where the pyramid's builders are interred. The
4,500-year-old coffin is inscribed with the grand title "Overseer of
the Administrative District."</TE>
<TE>   Hawass will open the sarcophagus for the first time during the
telecast.</TE>
<TE>   The program will also feature film of Lehner's ongoing excavations
near the pyramid. His digs have revealed what he called an "extensive
urban complex" covering an area the size of eight football fields.</TE>
<TE>   That "city" is composed of "great blocks" separated by paved city
streets with drains down the middle. The blocks, each 100 yards wide
and 150 yards deep, are most likely barracks or dormitories for the
workers who built the pyramids. The blocks are flanked by several
bakeries and breweries, which provided food and drink for the
workers--who were not slaves, by the way, but farmers spending
periods of public service.</TE>
<TE>   Garbage dumps suggest that the workers ate well, he added, with
"massive amounts of meat consumption," including cattle, sheep and
goats.</TE>
<TE>   To the east of all this, he added, "there is a maze of small
chambers, houses, courtyards, granaries, etc. This is a more
natural-looking town, probably for the more permanent residents"--the
architects and overseers who managed the construction of the
pyramids.</TE>
<TE>   "National Geographic Channel Presents Pyramids Live: Secret
Chambers Revealed" will be shown at 8 tonight on KTTV, Channel 11.</TE>

<HD>'Beyond Therapy' a Little Dated but a Hilarious Romp</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>SAN DIEGO--Bruce and Prudence are New York neurotics looking for
companionship in the classified ads. Their psychobabbling therapists,
Charlotte and Stuart, are downright crazy.</LD>
<LD>   And Bruce's gay lover, Bob, has an Auntie Mame-like mother who
breaks into song whenever she wants to express disapproval or assert
control, which is quite often.</LD>
<LD>   Such is the premise of "Beyond Therapy," a wickedly funny and
farcical take on love and sex and coping in the early 1980s that
opened Saturday at the Globe Theatres here.</LD>
<TE>   The pace is breathless, the acting is uniformly first rate, and
the one-liners litter the floor like confetti on New Year's Eve.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to cry," Bruce says upon first meeting Prudence.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think men should cry unless something falls on them," she
replies.</TE>
<TE>   Written by Christopher Durang, "Beyond Therapy" pushed the
envelope two decades ago in frankness and titillation-spiced humor.</TE>
<TE>   Today--in the era of Fox and WB sitcoms--it seems less daring, and
some of the references are woefully dated. Does anyone still discuss
Dyan Cannon and Cary Grant?</TE>
<TE>   Still, "Beyond" is a romp where everyone is too clever and verbal
for their own good and the comedy can sting or, at least, embarrass.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy in "Beyond" is that nothing succeeds like excess. If
one reference to premature ejaculation is funny, six are better. If
one phone call from Bob's unseen mother is funny, several are
hilarious.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce is divorced and lives with Bob. Now he wants it all.</TE>
<TE>   "I want you and children, and occasionally Bob," Bruce tells
Prudence.</TE>
<TE>   Anna Cody as Prudence and Matthew Montelongo as Bruce are the
classic mismatched couple from hell: drawn to one another but given
to analyzing and announcing each nuance of feeling. Think of Lucy and
Ricky by way of the Bundys from "Married ... With Children."</TE>
<TE>   Prudence's therapist, played by Paul Michael Valley, is a lounge
lizard and serial seducer so slimy and manipulative and obvious that
you can't help but love him. As Bob, Adam Edwards is delightfully
devious and pitiful.</TE>
<TE>   But the award for inspired nuttiness goes to Alma Cuervo as
Bruce's therapist, Charlotte. She dresses like an aging gypsy bag
lady, hugs her Snoopy doll and suffers occasional vocabulary
breakdowns and stammering spells.</TE>
<TE>   Her dissertation on the meaning of certain conjugal positions is a
showstopper. "Couples who prefer the missionary position may wish to
do anthropological work in Ghana," she pronounces.</TE>
<TE>   In context, the line makes perfect sense.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Beyond Therapy," written by Christopher Durang, at the Cassius
Carter Centre Stage of the Globe Theatres complex in Balboa Park
through Oct. 20. Tuesday-Saturday, 8 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 2
p.m; Sunday at 7 p.m. Running time: 1 hour, 45 minutes. Tickets: $35
to $45. Box office: (619) 239-2255.</TE>

<HD>A Daring Leap to the Unexpected</HD>
<DH>With trouble threatening, the Biennale de la Danse makes a
spectacular departure from its contemporary agenda.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LYON, France--Contemporary dance launched the 10th Biennale de la
Danse with high achievement on Tuesday but threatened to bottom out
by the end of the week. With a dancer's injury causing the
postponement of a world premiere by French choreographer Maguy Marin,
and companies from Chile, Brazil and Argentina introducing
problematic modernism, the Biennale's 20-day "Terra Latina" festival
needed a whole different kind of buzz to restore its luster.</LD>
<LD>   Happily, Biennale artistic director Guy Darmet found it in an
elaborate--and risky--program of antique celebration rituals from
Bolivia and Colombia. Performed Thursday in the 3,000-seat ancient
Roman amphitheater of Fourviere, his "Latino Carnivals" turned out to
be an unforgettable statement of splendor and spirituality.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of importing a single professional folklorico company,
Darmet had sought out native groups that normally perform in annual
feast-day processions: 61 dancers and musicians from the Bolivian
mining town of Oruro, for instance, who brought their spectacular "La
Diablada" traditions to Lyon.</LD>
<TE>   Pitting all manner of devils and demons against the archangel
Gabriel, this parade of elaborately costumed and masked performers
capped a four-part evening staged by Walson Botelho that began with
two groups presenting portions of the carnival from Barranquilla in
northeast Colombia. First a 40-member university troupe, Garabato
Unilibre, offered a series of vibrant, stamina-testing dances
interrupted by the figure of Death, swinging his scythe and causing
mass consternation.</TE>
<TE>   Next came the 40-member La Sabrosa contingent in red-and-white,
18th century attire, giving great warmth and elegance to the
Caribbean "Cumbiamba" while representing an entire native
community--teenagers, geezers, the svelte and the zaftig--rather than
the uniformly gorgeous 18-to-24-year-old "folk" on view in most
touring world dance ensembles.</TE>
<TE>   Best of all, perhaps, were the virtuosic, 33-member Bloque
Illimani dancers in "Sambos Caporales," a joyous, high-stepping,
arm-swinging tribute to the fortitude of black slaves forced to work
in the Bolivian mines.</TE>
<TE>   Good versus evil, life shadowed by death, indomitable human
endurance: These themes grounded the event, and when members of the
audience joined all four companies on the forestage at the end, you
could see not merely the desire to boogie but deeper issues. For
instance, two handsome, limber young Lyonnaise kept teasing the
figure of Death, but always carefully danced out of his way when that
scythe swung in their direction. No use tempting fate--or Guy Darmet.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, small and mid-size theaters throughout the Lyon area
programmed strongly executed contemporary works of limited
choreographic distinction--many of them European premieres. Offering
a view of the Argentine middle class as virtually paralyzed--able to
feel nothing but the pain it can inflict on itself and
others--"Secreto y Malibu" suffered from too many obvious borrowings
from German dance theater.</TE>
<TE>   However, the unsparing athleticism of Ines Rampoldi and Leticia
Mazur, who created it with company artistic director Dana Szeinblum,
kept it watchable at the Theatre du Point du Jour on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the physical daring of Chile's Compania Pe Mellado
Danza freshened the directionless cycle of female victimization in
Paulina Mellado S.'s "Place of Desire" at the intimate Salle Gerard
Phillipe the following night. Another Chilean exercise in exhausting
a concept without ever giving it a dramatic shape, Marcela Escobar's
solo "The Sack" completed the program.</TE>
<TE>   The Franco-Brazilian "Transatlantic" project by the Attacca and
Gondwana ensembles at the Theatre des Jeunes Annees on Thursday
offered fine solos by Luciano Souza. But this survey of the cultural
influences shaping Brazil spent less time on dance than talk, songs
and puppet shows.</TE>
<TE>   Talk and songs also dominated Henrique Rodovalho's plotless
"Choreography to Listen To" at the Theatre de la Croix-Russe on
Saturday. Indeed, the close relationship between the choreography and
the accompaniment (lifted from Brazilian TV, complete with interviews
in Portuguese) made it a puzzling choice for export.</TE>
<TE>   Rodovalho, however, fused muscular isolations, gymnastics,
Brazilian pop dancing and moves derived from contact improvisation
into perhaps the most distinctive personal style since early Twyla
Tharp.</TE>
<TE>   That style required the members of his Quasar company to lie on
the floor and twitch their way from place to place, to venture
asymmetrical unison flips not only easily but playfully and to roll
off one another's backs, or up into lifts, at any speed in any
direction.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Rodovalho has anything significant to say, the Quasar
dancers have something unique to show--and the savvy Biennale
audience couldn't get enough of them.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Baby Looney Tunes," premiering this morning on the Cartoon Network,
plays like a cross between "Tiny Toon Adventures" and "Muppet
Babies," without the better features of either of its predecessors.</LD>
<LD>   "Tiny Toons" (1990) featured what were essentially adolescent
versions of the classic Warner Bros. characters: Buster Bunny was
Bugs, Plucky Duck was Daffy, etc. As the title suggests, "Baby Looney
Tunes" turns Bugs, Daffy, Sylvester et al. into infants, under the
care of Granny. Although their mini-adventures are supposed to evoke
the classic Warner Bros. shorts, all the laughs have been drained
out.</LD>
<LD>   The designs for the babies are distinctly unappealing. The
Tasmanian Devil is little more than a large head with arms and stubby
legs. Bugs also has an outsized head, a pudgy little body and feet so
small he looks like he's about to tip over.</LD>
<TE>   The stories embody the sanitized "fun" that's supposed to amuse
small children. In "A Secret Tweet," for example, Tweety feels left
out because the other characters are keeping something from him:
plans for a surprise birthday party. There's no mayhem--and no
laughs. When a house of blocks goes flying, nobody gets beaned.
Accidentally bumping into each other is about as physical as this
bunch gets.</TE>
<TE>   The original Warners Bros. shorts are regarded as classics because
of their razor-sharp timing and hilarious blending of physical and
verbal humor. Ignored by the studio pooh-bahs, the Warners artists
made brilliant short films that were designed to amuse themselves.
Their characters were aggressive and aggressively funny. Even Granny,
who looks like such a sweet old lady, regularly beat the Friskies out
of Sylvester with her umbrella.</TE>
<TE>   The new infant versions are so tame, they make the Teletubbies
look brash.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of "A Secret Tweet," Tweety asks, "You all still wike
me?"</TE>
<TE>   Lola replies, "Why wouldn't we like you?" Any fan of the real
Warner Bros. cartoons could hand her a list of reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "Baby Looney Tunes" can be seen weekdays at 9 a.m. on the Cartoon
Network.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once, on a street in Mexico City, David Harrington, the Kronos
Quartet's first violinist, encountered a one-armed street musician
playing standard melodies by blowing on the edge of an ivy leaf. It
is an eerie sound, unlike any other, and you never forget it.
Harrington knew instantly, he told the audience at UCLA's Royce Hall
on Friday night, that one day Kronos had to play with Carlos Garcia.</LD>
<LD>   Alas, Garcia was not on hand for the concert; we had to make do
with his sublime, sweetly honeyed playing of the popular '40s hit
tune "Perfidia," on tape. Garcia wasn't the only thing on that tape
that accompanied the Kronos' live performance. There were also other
Kronoses, the quartet overdubbed over and over to re-create the
schlocky plush texture of the 101 Strings orchestra of the '50s.</LD>
<LD>   And if that were all there was to it, it might have seemed droll,
even slightly offensive, kitsch, which is how a couple of high-minded
classical critics have greeted Kronos' wildly innovative, Postmodern
global music masterpiece of a CD, "Nuevo," from which this concert
derived.</LD>
<TE>   But hearing "Perfidia" live proved that kitsch was hardly all
there was to it. There were prerecorded street sounds, which located
Garcia in his aural time and space. And then there was the
performance itself, Garcia exquisitely expressive and the Kronos
playing with a rapt fervor that resulted in anything but the
antiseptic hi-fi-era background music of 101 Strings and its like.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was the concert itself, hearing this music among an
enthusiastic crowd that included both new-music-oriented Kronos fans
as well as an audience conversant with Mexican culture (references to
Mexican TV stars were, for instance, warmly applauded).</TE>
<TE>   "Nuevo" launched the UCLA Live season, the most ambitious and
venturesome the school has ever presented. Part of that ambition is
to create context through both obvious and unexpected juxtapositions.
On Friday, Kronos, which is the ensemble in residence for the series
this year, was preceded by Plankton Man (a.k.a. Ignacio Chavez),
operating his computer to make the kind of remixes that are currently
the rage on the energetic Tijuana dance scene, and the polished,
entertaining Mariachi Reyna de Los Angeles, which proudly proclaims
itself the first all-women mariachi band in America.</TE>
<TE>   No evening that attempted to look widely at Mexican music could,
of course, do more than scratch but a few surfaces. And it is to the
Kronos' credit that the ensemble is neither in the business of
appropriation or of doing musicological justice. Rather it is a
quartet with perhaps the most extreme case on record of what the
California multicultural composer Lou Harrison calls the "me-too-ism"
that has propelled the phenomenon of world music. The quartet--which
also includes violinist John Sherba, violist Hank Dutt and cellist
Jennifer Culp--are inveterate collaborators, and that is what "Nuevo"
is all about.</TE>
<TE>   Every number in "Nuevo" (Kronos played 10 of the 13 on the CD)
represents a different aspect of Mexican music, but also a different
notion of collaboration, often with complex layers. Another standard,
"Se Me Hizo Facil" (It Was Easy for Me) by the popular Mexican
songwriter Agustin Lara, was arranged by Agentinian American composer
Osvaldo Golijov to include modern string quartet effects that cause
the melody to fade in and out of focus. It is as if we listen through
a veil of history.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the arrangements are by Golijov. He makes a raucous song
from Sinaloa all the more raw by using ragged amplified distortion of
the quartet. Meanwhile, Golijov's own "Festival for the Holy Mother
Guadalupe," for marimba (here prerecorded by Luanne Warner) and
background sounds from the ritual festival in Chiapas is a quiet
meditation on a mystical occasion.</TE>
<TE>   When Kronos goes to Mexico, it doesn't just walk the streets, but
also turns on the tube. Surely the strangest music of the evening was
hearing the Turkish march from Beethoven's "Ruins of Athens" in a pop
setting, juxtaposed with "I'm Just Wild About Harry," among much
else, including wild sound effects, as it once was on a popular
Mexican comedy show, "Chespirito," and its spinoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The arrangement by Ricardo Gallardo, to this listener's utter
amazement, successfully strives for the transcendental in the end.</TE>
<TE>   "Mini Skirt," a goofy cut from one of Juan Garcia Esquivel's
groovy bachelor-pad LPs from the '60s, is yet another
revelation--silly and dated, of course, but also full of quirky,
inventive electronic effects.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly enough, it was in Mexican art music that Kronos on this
occasion came closest to appropriation in an arrangement of Silvestre
Revueltas' well-known orchestral showpiece, "Sensemaya," for which
they were joined by the impressive Mexico City percussion ensemble
Tambuco.</TE>
<TE>   The percussion worked just fine, but no amount of amplification or
gripping playing from four string instruments can achieve the
instrumental power of the piece.</TE>
<TE>   And at the end, Kronos' collaboration with Cafe Tacoma missed the
thrill of live interaction, however virtuoso the quartet was in
synchronizing with a tape of the exciting Mexican rock band. Still,
that slight impression of disembodiment was the exception to a
venture into musical Mexico that brought us, in an hour, a more
visceral sense of a culture than you would think possible.</TE>

<HD>West Meets East in Hospital Drama</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sunday on the Pax network, Richard Thomas ("The Waltons") made his
return to TV drama in the legal series "Just Cause," and tonight on
the same channel, another familiar face who came up big in the 1970s,
Peter Strauss, takes another turn in the box.</LD>
<LD>   Strauss, who first jumped to prominence in the landmark 1976
miniseries "Rich Man, Poor Man," stars as Dr. Isaac Braun in the new
offbeat medical drama "Body and Soul" (9 p.m.)</LD>
<LD>   The program, the result of an idea that had been percolating in
the head of co-executive producer John Whelpley since an experience
with cancer a dozen years ago, sets its scene in an Ohio hospital.</LD>
<TE>   But it's an ongoing battle between traditional and alternative
medicine that gives the series its dramatic thrust.</TE>
<TE>   Braun is the old-school rep, or at least he remains so until a
bizarre mishap leaves him conscious but muted by a death-like
paralysis. After being wheeled to the hospital morgue to await his
autopsy amid a roomful of corpses, he begins to have doubts about the
hospital's way of doing business.</TE>
<TE>   Helping cement those doubts is Dr. Rachel Griffen (co-star Larissa
Laskin), who is the series' yin to Braun's yang. Griffen has returned
to Century Hospital after spending two years in the Far East, where
she learned the value of nontraditional medical techniques while
easing her terminal father's final days.</TE>
<TE>   But her efforts to meld East and West care regimens at the
hospital get a frosty reception.</TE>
<TE>   Griffen's earnest philosophizing occasionally lapses into phrasing
that conjures up memories of David Carradine in "Kung Fu," but her
chemistry with Strauss and some kooky plot twists help to brighten
the long-term prognosis for "Body and Soul."</TE>

<HD>Galbraith Makes Most of Guitar's Expanded Range</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Guitar virtuoso Paul Galbraith has been on the scene long enough that
we should be accustomed to his unusual presentation, yet it's still a
sight for startled eyes.</LD>
<LD>   Galbraith plays a custom eight-string instrument, with extra
strings on either side of the traditional six, and creates smart
arrangements taking advantage of the added range. In addition, he
plays it upright, like a shrunken cello, with its spike grounded on a
fanciful wooden sound box to enrich the sound output.</LD>
<LD>   This is not your father's classical guitar. Close your eyes,
though, and what impresses most is the simple fact of his musical
mastery, amply evident at USC's Newman Recital Hall on Friday. It was
not a flawless performance, with a few more mis-frettings and
tentative sounds than expected, perhaps the result of a USC audience
teeming with guitarists, of the professional and student variety.
Galbraith was actually more relaxed and flowing at the previous
night's recital at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art.</LD>
<TE>   Glitches, though, couldn't detract Friday from the quiet intensity
and focus of Galbraith's performance.</TE>
<TE>   His instrument's expanded range is well-suited to adaptations of
keyboard music, as he showed in his assured reading of the concert
opener, Bach's "French Suite" No. 2 in C minor (transposed to the
guitar-friendly key of E minor), and Enrique Granados' "Valses
Poeticos," its mellifluous lines reaching up into unexpected, airy
heights.</TE>
<TE>   Other more guitaristic treats on the program included the most
contemporary work, English composer Lennox Berkeley's alternately
sweet and lightly sour Sonatina Opus 51 (written for Julian Bream),
and Jacques Ibert's effervescent and mischievous "Francaise."</TE>
<TE>   Galbraith closed with an ear-opening arrangement of Debussy's
"Children's Corner," its lyrical, Impressionistic palette ideally
refitted to the guitar, or at least to this oddly logical guitar, and
this commanding guitarist's hands.</TE>

<HD>Private Water Project Is All Wet</HD>
<DH>Cadiz control of this precious resource should never be
allowed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE KELLY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California voters are about to witness another boondoggle that could
end up costing $1 billion, contribute to rising water prices and
damage the environment.</LD>
<LD>   Under a controversial water storage project, Cadiz Inc. would
receive $150 million in construction costs from Southern California
consumers to build a 35-mile pipeline and store up to a million
acre-feet of water in the Mojave Desert.</LD>
<LD>   The project also would mine the local groundwater and sell it at a
profit. This would be the first large-scale deal in California to
permit private profit-taking for the sale of groundwater.</LD>
<TE>   This is worrisome because in other states private control of water
has resulted in skyrocketing prices, poor delivery and reduced water
quality.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Brackpool, chief executive of Cadiz, has contributed more
than $250,000 to Gov. Gray Davis' campaign and is a key advisor to
him on water issues. Brackpool also has hired at least three former
California legislators and, most recently, the former law firm of
secretary of the Interior Gale Norton to lobby for preliminary
approval on this proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The Cadiz project was recently approved by the Department of the
Interior. The next step is for the Metropolitan Water District of
Southern California to enter into negotiations on a contract with
Cadiz. Once that is done, the project would receive $75 million
upfront for projected construction costs from the agency. Cadiz is
supposed to be responsible for the remaining $75 million in
construction costs.</TE>
<TE>   However, Cadiz's current loans from ING Bank in the Netherlands
stipulate that all funds coming into the company must go to repay
Cadiz's line of credit. The question is, then, where will Cadiz get
the money for the start-up phase? So far, no one has answered this.</TE>
<TE>   The Cadiz proposal may cost the Metropolitan Water District as
much as $1 billion over the 50-year life of the project, while the
amount of groundwater it can deliver remains uncertain, according to
initial estimates of the U.S. Geological Survey.</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of public interest groups and Sen. Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.) are demanding to know why this project has been
fast-tracked while others--such as the Hayfield Valley Project--that
keep water rights within the control of public utilities and use
existing sites basically have been ignored.</TE>
<TE>   The groups, which include Public Citizen, the National Parks
Conservation Assn., the Sierra Club, the Western Environmental Law
Center, Desert Survivors and Taxpayers for Common Sense, have studied
the Cadiz plan and concluded that it is economically unworkable and
would be a disaster for the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Among the major concerns are that Cadiz grossly overestimates the
amount of groundwater that it can legally extract from the Mojave
aquifer and that it would harm the water table in distant areas, turn
the surrounding area into a dust bowl, contribute to air pollution
and drive out wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Cadiz has promised the Department of the Interior that it will set
up a monitoring system to spot such problems. However, Feinstein and
environmental experts say it is impossible to create one that would
rectify the damage in time.</TE>
<TE>   Should more water storage be required to reduce California's
dependence on a fresh flow each year from the Colorado River, five
other water storage plans have been presented to the MWD. All would
keep control of water in the hands of public utilities.</TE>
<TE>   We need only to look at the problems in Atlanta to see what awaits
us if the Cadiz project is approved. In Atlanta, the water is so
brown that local families don't want to drink it or bathe their
children in it.</TE>
<TE>   We can't let that happen here.</TE>
<TE>   Let the buyer beware: Private control of water can be disastrous
for the consumer.</TE>

<LD>As religious leaders, we collectively disavow the path that affirms
that grief must lead to war. We refuse to accept violence as the
necessary consequence of loss. Our religious traditions must not
bless war. Those peace-loving expressions of one God must not support
the lie of the "just war" against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   We see the costs of war as including the loss of American lives
and treasure; further death and neglect of Iraqi civilians,
especially children; the tarnishing of the United States' reputation
and diplomatic leadership; and an intensification of hatred in the
Middle East toward the U.S. and the West.</LD>
<LD>   We reject the heresy that sprang from the embrace of nationalism
by religion's sanction of wars. For all time, the evil and pernicious
"blessing of war" as just must be repudiated.</LD>
<TE>   We know what our faith traditions command of us: to be
peacemakers; to do good to those who hate us; to abide by the peace
of God/the Ultimate.</TE>
<TE>   Our faith traditions, said Mohandas K. Gandhi, are highways
leading to the same destination. Christian and Muslim, Hindu and Jew,
Buddhist and Shinto, Bahai, Sikh and Jain: All celebrate the
sacredness of human life and charge us to build a just, peaceful and
equitable world; all celebrate the power of love to vanquish hate and
the power of mercy to overcome vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   We also remember all too well the wars carried out in our
religions' name in Vietnam, Korea, Cambodia and many more places. Our
experience in faith leads us to repudiate war as the method for
problem solving.</TE>
<TE>   We mourn the loss of life resulting from the attacks of Sept. 11,
but we do not ask that more blood be shed. Our mourning is a peaceful
mourning and is not a podium to call for a war of vengeance against
Iraqis.</TE>

<HD>Abolish the Death Penalty for Youths</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three U.S. Supreme Court justices have said that the court should
consider abolishing the death penalty for people who committed their
offenses as minors, setting up the juvenile death penalty as the
newest frontier in our nation's debate over capital punishment.</LD>
<LD>   "Given the apparent consensus that exists among the states and in
the international community against the execution of a capital
sentence imposed on a juvenile offender," Justice John Paul Stevens
wrote, "I think it would be appropriate to revisit the issue at the
earliest possible opportunity." Justices Stephen G. Breyer and Ruth
Bader Ginsburg agreed.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last three years, aside from the United States, only
Pakistan, Iran and the Republic of Congo have executed juvenile
offenders--hardly the kind of human rights company we should be
keeping.</LD>
<TE>   Even within the United States, executing juveniles is uncommon.</TE>
<TE>   Although 22 states allow people who committed their offenses when
they were under age 18 to be executed, only seven states have
actually carried out juvenile executions since the death penalty was
reinstated in 1973. Of the 21 who have been executed since, 13 were
in Texas. And of the 26 youthful offenders now on death row in Texas,
10 are from Harris County (Houston) despite the fact that a recent
Houston Chronicle poll found that only 25% of county residents
supported executing juvenile offenders.</TE>
<TE>   In the landmark Atkins decision in June, the high court barred
execution of the mentally retarded, ruling that "those mentally
retarded persons who meet the law's requirements for criminal
responsibility should be tried and punished when they commit crimes.
Because of their disabilities in the areas of reasoning, judgment and
control of their impulses, however, they do not act with the level of
moral culpability that characterizes the most serious adult criminal
conduct."</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, that reasoning is analogous to youthful offenders. Do
juveniles have the same moral reasoning as adults? Of course not,
that's why we don't let them vote until they are 18.</TE>
<TE>   Do young people have the same level of impulse control? Again, an
obvious no, which is why they are forbidden to drink alcohol until
age 21.</TE>
<TE>   According to the American Society for Adolescent Psychiatry,
recent scientific advancements have found that the brain does not
physically stop maturing until age 20 or so, and maturation can be
severely retarded by abuse and neglect, afflictions suffered by most
young offenders on death row.</TE>
<TE>   Death penalty supporters have decried the high court's Atkins
ruling based on public safety and the unlikely premise that
defendants will fake retardation to avoid execution.</TE>
<TE>   These arguments are weaker when it comes to juveniles. It's
virtually impossible to fake age. And, while the diminished
culpability associated with mental retardation is permanent, the
diminished culpability associated with youthfulness can be cured with
maturity and rehabilitation, reducing the risk of future
dangerousness.</TE>
<TE>   At an August press conference announcing the introduction of a
bill to abolish Texas' juvenile death penalty, University of Texas
law professor Jordan Steiker said, "We are in fact deciding whether
we will be among the last jurisdictions on Earth to retain this
practice, with its message of despair and vengeance, or whether we
will acknowledge the uniqueness of youth and bring compassion and
hope to the problems youth presents."</TE>
<TE>   Texas and those other 21 states should get on the right side of
science, public opinion, international and national standards of
decency and, most important, history.</TE>

<LD>On April 19, 2000, five years to the day after the Oklahoma City
bombing, I stood in the media bleachers at the former site of the
Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building as President Clinton dedicated a
memorial to the victims.</LD>
<LD>   As a human being, I was moved. As an art critic, I was appalled.</LD>
<LD>   The memorial is awful, a gauche Hydra that aims to be all things
to all visitors and thus fails spectacularly as public art. It proves
the adage that a camel is a horse built by committee.</LD>
<TE>   New Yorkers facing the task of creating a World Trade Center
memorial should look to the Oklahoma City National Memorial as a
cautionary example of what their memorial must not become.</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time, public memorials were direct and dignified, if
perhaps a tad boring. Washington had his obelisk, Jefferson his
rotunda, Lincoln his acropolis. Then in 1982, Maya Lin's dark elegy
on the Vietnam War redefined our conception of what a memorial looks
and feels like.</TE>
<TE>   It was probably Lin's brand of understated overstatement,
inimitable yet much imitated, that the 350-member Oklahoma City
committee hoped to evoke with what is actually six different
memorials, including a survivor tree, a reflecting pool and 168 empty
chairs inscribed with victims' names.</TE>
<TE>   Any one of these elements alone would have provided the requisite
pathos. Six of them, to use a terribly inappropriate term, is
overkill, a morbid theme park: Branson, Mo., meets Timothy McVeigh.
This is what you get when you try to appease too many competing
alliances. This is what New York must avoid.</TE>
<TE>   Yet already the Lower Manhattan Redevelopment Corp. has bowed to
public complaints that the World Trade Center project is not
inclusive enough, opening the doors to additional architecture firms
after thousands of armchair critics panned the initial proposals.</TE>
<TE>   How many memorials does the World Trade Center site need? One. How
many contests should be held to find the best use for ground zero?
Zero.</TE>
<TE>   The best design has already been submitted, built and dismantled.
It was called the "Tribute in Light," and it was the brainchild of
six designers who created a temporary homage not only to the victims
but also to the great minimalist doctrine, less is more. Unlike the
multipart Oklahoma City memorial, the "Tribute in Light" expressed
its power not in preponderance but in simplicity.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a lesson from the heartland that New Yorkers should
take to heart, it is this: One terrorist atrocity is too many for any
city to live through, and one memorial is enough to remember it by.</TE>

<HD>Welcome to Assassin-istan</HD>
<DH>Killing off leaders is a way of life in Afghanistan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMIR TAHERI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recent assassination attempt against President Hamid Karzai has
triggered an avalanche of comment on how far Afghanistan is from
achieving normality.</LD>
<LD>   Taliban supporters call it a sign of Washington's failure in
Afghanistan. Those who wish to drag the U.S. into empire-building
games in Central Asia have used it to argue for greater American
military involvement.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the truth is that, by Afghan standards, the situation is as
normal as it could get.</LD>
<TE>   Afghanistan has always represented a patchwork of tribal
communities that first came together in the 18th century,
acknowledging the nominal authority of a distant shah, or king, in
Kabul. The idea was that the different communities would be
autonomous in their territories but would unite under one banner to
oppose foreign invaders.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble among the communities broke out only when Kabul tried to
exercise real authority. In such cases, the crisis would come to an
end with the eviction or murder of the interventionist king. In the
last two centuries, two Afghan kings have been murdered and three
more deposed.</TE>
<TE>   Rulers in post-monarchist Afghanistan have fared even worse. From
1973, when the last king was driven into exile, to 2001, Afghanistan
has had eight rulers. Of these, four were murdered and two were
driven from office by force. One was saved by the Soviets at the last
minute because he had been an agent of the KGB. The last, Mullah
Mohammed Omar, is being hunted by U.S. and allied troops.</TE>
<TE>   To this list must be added the murder, just two days before last
year's Sept. 11 attacks, of Ahmed Shah Masoud in his stronghold of
Panjshir. Though he never became head of state, for almost two
decades Masoud symbolized Afghan resistance, first against the
communists and then against the Taliban. His murder was the curtain
raiser for the attacks on New York and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Masoud was not the only prominent Afghan leader to die at the
hands of assassins. A list of tribal, political and religious leaders
who have been murdered by opponents in the last decade reads like an
Afghan who's who.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan normality is under threat not because of assassination
attempts that have always formed part of the Afghan political norm
but rather because of attempts at altering the traditional status of
Afghanistan as a buffer state surrounded by rival powers and making
it instead a foundation for U.S. global defenses. Such attempts are
bound to provoke negative reactions from Iran, Russia, China,
Pakistan and even India.</TE>
<TE>   A second threat to normality in Afghanistan comes from the
mistaken notion that money and American military support could
transform Afghanistan into a centralized state controlled by a small
elite from Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   One other factor complicates the situation. Karzai is supposed to
be a transitional leader whose principal task is to supervise the
writing of a new constitution, the holding of a referendum to approve
it and, eventually, the organization of elections.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai, however, has persuaded the U.S. to help him create a new
national army, something that has never worked in Afghanistan. He has
insisted that the $5 billion in foreign aid promised by the U.S. and
other countries should be channeled through Kabul, giving the capital
a clout it has never had before. And he has played the ethnic card,
creating the impression that the new U.S.-backed leadership of
Afghanistan will be predominantly Pushtun.</TE>
<TE>   Despite occasional acts of violence, Afghanistan is now
experiencing a peace and normality that it had not known for almost
30 years. And that is to a large measure thanks to American
intervention, for which a majority of Afghans say they are grateful.</TE>
<TE>   But the same Afghans resent any attempt by Washington to intervene
in their domestic politics to alter the delicate arrangements that
have kept that "land of insolence," as Muslim literature has called
Afghanistan, under one flag for more than two centuries.</TE>
<TE>   As Muslim historian Abbas Iqbal wrote: "It is when a conqueror has
achieved complete victory in the land of insolence that he is most in
danger. The tribes gradually turn him into another tribal chief and
fete and honor him. And then one day, they will slit his throat."</TE>

<LD>Senior Federal Reserve official William J. McDonough's denunciation
of exorbitant executive compensation at a Sept. 11 memorial service
on Wall Street must have come as a jolt to his audience. Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan has already attacked excessive compensation unrelated
to company performance as part of the "infectious greed" that seized
Wall Street in the last decade. But McDonough went a step further in
declaring that "any notion of moral balance" requires that business
leaders curb their financial appetites. Those appetites appear more
insatiable almost every day.</LD>
<LD>   L. Dennis Kozlowski, former chief executive of Tyco International,
and his second-in-command, Mark H. Swartz, are under New York state
grand jury indictments alleging stock fraud, bribery and the use of
improper loans for goodies ranging from a Park Avenue apartment to
Tiffany's jewelry. The company's former general counsel, Mark A.
Belnick, was also indicted for allegedly concealing improper loans to
himself. John Rigas, former CEO of Adelphia Communications, which is
under bankruptcy protection, allegedly used company funds to pay for
everything from an African safari to luxury apartments.</LD>
<TE>   Executives who didn't do anything illegal have been exploiting
their firms as well. Jack Welch, who retired last year as CEO of
General Electric, has been living lavishly on the company dime,
according to court papers filed by his wife in their divorce case.
During Welch's time at GE, the firm paid more than $7.5 million of
the $32.5 million that the Welches spent on their homes, the papers
said. Welch, now a consultant to GE, is said to even have the company
paying for his postage and toiletries.</TE>
<TE>   Some companies seem to be getting the message. Adelphia, for
example, has stated that it will not hand over $4.2 million in
severance pay to Rigas.</TE>
<TE>   But rescinding a few executives' payments, while a good start, is
not enough. Fundamental changes are needed. McDonough lamented that
the average CEO, who 20 years ago would have made 42 times as much as
an average production worker, now makes almost 500 times as much.
These inequities have not created better CEOs but, instead, an
atmosphere of entitlement and contempt for the law. The onus is on
corporate boards, which too often have been rubber stamps, to demand
that compensation not exceed justifiable levels.</TE>

<LD>A special federal appeals court met in secret last week to hear the
Justice Department argue that it needs still more latitude to spy on
suspected terrorists. The three-member court heard only from lawyers
for Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft on why the expanded powers Congress gave
him in the USA Patriot Act to tap phones, scrub computers and search
homes are not enough. No one was allowed to be present to argue
against Ashcroft, not even members of the Senate Judiciary and
Intelligence committees who asked to attend.</LD>
<LD>   The next day, Judiciary Committee members--obviously troubled by
the potential for civil liberties abuses in these secret, one-sided
proceedings--began discussing the outlines of a possible legislative
response. Their concern is more than warranted.</LD>
<TE>   Congress created the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court
to keep government from snooping on its political opponents, as
Richard Nixon had done. The seven judges rule on requests for
national security-related wiretaps or searches. Congress let the
court operate behind closed doors to keep foreign spies in the dark.
But it directed that, though the information gathered in these
searches could be used to try a suspected spy for espionage, it could
not be passed to local police to bring criminal charges for, say,
grand theft or drug possession. That's because FISA courts can
approve search warrants on a lower threshold of suspicion than the
"probable cause" standard enshrined in the 4th Amendment that governs
criminal cases. Under the Patriot Act, investigators can get a
warrant even if there's no evidence of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, in an unprecedented opinion, the FISA court last May
rebuked Ashcroft for having gone too far in letting criminal
investigators press for secret searches. The court's concern mirrors
the worries of many that the war on foreign terrorists is leading to
civil liberties abuses at home. Ashcroft last week appealed to the
three judges who review FISA court decisions, a trio that had never
before been convened. The panel's ruling is pending.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Congress would do well to shine a judicious bit of
light on the FISA court. Congressional proposals to require more
reporting from the court--on the number of people targeted in these
searches, the prosecutions that result and the legal arguments the
court adopts--make sense. So do clearer limits on the attorney
general's unfortunate tendency to see the Constitution as more an
obstacle than a guide to his anti-terrorism efforts.</TE>

<LD>Recent reports that Al Qaeda terrorists originally considered
slamming airplanes into nuclear power plants but instead targeted
skyscrapers and monuments are of small comfort to Americans still
jittery about future attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's 103 commercial nuclear plants are already "hard
targets." Their domes and towers are made of thick reinforced
concrete. Sophisticated security systems and armed guards protect
control rooms and monitor access to plants. In the new world of
terrorism, however, where zealots are willing to die to cause mass
destruction, these plants are still not "hard" enough.</LD>
<LD>   Since 9/11, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the utilities
that run commercial power plants have implemented many welcome
changes. All facilities have remained on the highest state of alert.
The NRC has ordered plants to upgrade security in dozens of ways.
More than 1,000 new guards now protect the nation's nuclear plants,
bringing the total to about 6,000. New hires must pass a
comprehensive background check. The FBI has checked all plant
employees against a watch list. Many facilities have moved their
security checkpoints farther from plant buildings and added
electronic sensors and concrete barricades to keep out intruders or
truck bombs.</LD>
<TE>   The NRC says it is in touch daily with the Office of Homeland
Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Aviation
Administration, the Coast Guard and other security and
emergency-response agencies. The FAA bars planes from circling over
nuclear plants, and at the San Onofre plant in Orange County and
others on navigable waters, the Coast Guard has set up exclusion
zones barring boats, swimmers and fishing.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there are still weak spots.</TE>
<TE>   Federal rules, publicly available, still only require plants to be
able to repel a handful of intruders on foot and one person inside
the facility--a quaint scenario in light of 9/11. While the NRC says
its new orders postulate more realistic attacks, it won't say how
realistic--for security reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the NRC has suspended the mock assault drills it had
required in past years in favor of "tabletop," or paper, exercises,
insisting that plant managers are overwhelmed with new hires and
security directives. Yet guards at many plants performed dismally
when the drills were run. Some plants still perform their own "force
on force" drills, pitting some plant security guards against others.
But the NRC doesn't always monitor these exercises.</TE>
<TE>   Hiring more guards alone will not safeguard plants. A recent
survey of new power plant guards found that even those who had never
previously fired a gun received only limited weapons training. Some
guards told researchers that they were fearful of their ability to
defend the plant in the event of an assault.</TE>
<TE>   SB 1746, now before the full Senate, would build on the NRC's
efforts to upgrade security by filling in some of these gaps. The
measure, by Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nevada), would add hiring and training
standards for guards, assign a federal security coordinator to each
plant and establish a federal task force to take a comprehensive look
at the security of nuclear plants. The NRC and the utilities, which
oppose several provisions of Reid's bill, don't believe that they
need this help. We think his proposals can only make everyone safer.</TE>

<HD>The Future Holds More Than Memories of 9/11</HD>

<LD>Re "A Day of Remembrance and Resolve," Sept. 12: Now that the "Year
9/11" is over, I hope we can refocus our attention to some other
problems without a daily reminder of the terrorist attacks on the
twin towers and the Pentagon. Regrettably, several thousand people
lost their lives, but during the past year many thousands have died
of starvation without daily headlines.</LD>
<LD>   We do get a few articles about the homeless thousands roaming the
streets without a place to stay. We also hear of terrorism in a
smaller way, where someone is killed in a gang-war shooting or in a
holdup. We cannot change the past, but we can change the future if we
do not become obsessed with yesterday's problems. Praise should
rightfully be given to the firefighters who risked and lost their
lives trying to save other people. But at the same time, that was in
the line of duty, and not as much recognition is being given to other
firefighters who are doing the same thing every day.</LD>
<LD>   Let's look at 9/11 in a more realistic perspective and get on with
our lives.</LD>

<TE>   The government's new terror alert system, an unfortunate
overreaction to last year's tragic attacks, is absolutely useless to
the general public ("U.S. Signals 'High Risk' of New Attacks," Sept.
11). What, exactly, is the ordinary citizen supposed to do with this
information (other than panic)? Does going from yellow to orange mean
the odds of being a victim of a terrorist attack have gone from one
in 10 million to one in 1 million? One in 10,000?</TE>
<TE>   Although the public needs to be aware that the threat of terrorism
is real and growing, these alerts will only serve to escalate fear in
an already anxious public, much to the delight of our enemies. Or
could it be that our fears are being exploited by our own government
in order to gain support for a premature military campaign? Paranoia
is infectious.</TE>

<LD>Nikolai Polissky brings to mind the great Russian writer Ivan
Turgenev, who always set his tales of village life in all its
hardships and folklore against landscapes of hauntingly natural
beauty ("Hope in a Russian Haystack," Sept. 11). These antithetical
juxtapositions underscored the ironies of life and inevitabilities of
fate in the lives of his characters.</LD>
<LD>   No, the snowmen and the basket-weave towers offer no practical
solutions to the problems of those who inhabit Nikola-Lenivets, but
like all important works of art, they draw the viewer into an
alternate reality, apparently much needed, although at times
underappreciated by the people of this former Soviet enclave.</LD>

<HD>Computer Voting: Florida's System Highlights Glitches</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gosh, everyone is so surprised at the latest Florida election fiasco
("Florida Vote Foul-Up Puts Reform Onus on Congress," Sept. 12). For
hundreds of years, little pieces of paper with holes punched in them
have had a pretty good record of providing pretty accurate results in
thousands of polling places in thousands of elections. No system
being perfect, "design flaws" may have caused problems in a handful
of locations over the centuries. And yes, we all know of one possible
biggie in that department--out of billions of "beta tests" of paper
ballots.</LD>
<LD>   But if anyone thinks that going high-tech is going to prevent or
lessen this type of glitch, that person has never had a computer
crash in the middle of a sentence, called a company for information
only to be told the system is down, had a computer file lost in
cyberspace or spent two lovely hours with tech support. Did people
really think that having computers at polling places would solve the
problems? Will California rethink the plan on spending hundreds of
millions of dollars to follow Florida's latest lead?</LD>

<TE>   It was good to see that the only state of emergency in the country
last week was the one Gov. Jeb Bush called in Florida to keep polls
open after hours during the state's glitched primary balloting on
Tuesday. Former Secretary of State Katherine Harris must be so proud
of her track record and election reform legacy there.</TE>
<TE>   And to think, Harris may have a chance to put her magical hands on
the issue at a national level. She easily won the Republican primary
for U.S. representative from a Florida district.</TE>

<HD>LAPD: Merits of Finding a Chief in the Ranks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Next Chief of Police Should Be, First and Foremost, a Cop"
(Commentary, Sept. 12) makes good points about on-the-street policing
experience being a requirement for the next LAPD chief, but Jay
Wachtel is off base when he implies that reforming "police culture"
is not important. It is the police culture that gets police
departments into trouble.</LD>
<LD>   An example is the recent Donovan Jackson case in Inglewood. The
original stop for an expired auto registration was OK, but the stop
went bad when two additional police cars with four additional cops
stopped to offer aid. What they did was abuse the boy and get
themselves and their department in trouble. So it was the culture--of
being so scared of every citizen that the additional cops thought it
was necessary to join the investigation--that caused the problem.</LD>
<LD>   Jeff Warner</LD>
<TE>   La Habra Heights</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I always wonder why cities around the country go on a nationwide
shopping tour for a new police chief (Sept. 11). Isn't it logical to
promote the next senior cop to the top job? If that person isn't fit
for the chief's job, how did he or she get to be No. 2? And if the
No. 2 or 3 or 4, etc., can't cut the mustard, why are they so senior
in the department?</TE>
<TE>   Any city ought to make certain that promotions and commensurate
pay go to those who deserve both; and if that isn't the case, then
the problem isn't inside the police department, and no serious law
enforcement problem will be solved by hiring someone from elsewhere.
Hire locally--at least the candidates know the territory.</TE>

<HD>Single-Room Housing for Skid Row Residents</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Congratulations to Steve Lopez for bringing the community's attention
to issues around the revitalization of the neighborhood in "A Skid
Row Bistro Sounds Pretty Good, Despite Reservations" (Sept. 6).
However, if the area around 4th and Main streets became the exclusive
domain of the poor, it was because everyone else abandoned it. Now
that we are all anxious to experience downtown again, this does not
have to be at the expense of the folks who live there.</LD>
<LD>   More than 3,000 single-room housing units in the area are begging
for rehabilitation. The Skid Row Housing Trust has successfully
rehabilitated 18 buildings, serving 1,100 people with decent housing.
Moreover, we provide supportive services to help residents stay
housed and improve their lives rather than returning to the jails,
hospitals and streets.</LD>
<TE>   Lopez reported that nonprofits own two-thirds of the skid row
hotels. But nonprofits own just 30%, or 2,500, of the housing units.
If and when the two-thirds ownership is achieved, I believe Pete's
Cafe Bar will no longer open its doors on a "Calcutta adventure
park." Instead, low-income people will be successfully included in
the revitalized urban community. Communities in Los Angeles are not
exactly lining up to build affordable housing for people living on
skid row. City development dollars would be well spent on
rehabilitation of the rich stock of single-room housing in the Main
Street corridor.</TE>

<HD>New Simon Verdict: Now Talk Issues</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis has been diverting attention from his own failures
for too long. First he harped on Bill Simon's tax returns, until
Simon made them available. Then Davis harped on the jury's verdict
against Simon's company, but now the verdict has been overturned
(Sept. 13). What will Davis say next? God forbid, he may have to talk
about his record.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Californians have been bombarded with negative speculation
concerning the health of the Simon campaign (Sept. 9). At this point,
voters know more about the smug conventional wisdom that downplays
Simon's chances than about the real differences between him and the
corrupt Gov. Davis.</TE>
<TE>   If California is to remain a functioning democracy in which money
doesn't always buy elections, the media must cover this race more
responsibly. A candidate's fund-raising troubles and his skills as a
campaigner tell us little about who deserves to be governor. Far more
important are Simon's solutions to our deepening crises under
one-party Democratic rule.</TE>
<TE>   David Frisk</TE>
<TE>   Claremont</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Almost everything governors or presidents do can be undone by
their successors. The crucial exception is judicial appointments.
Many Republican judicial nominees frighten me so deeply that I will
never help elect a Republican to an executive position. Some have
suggested that we vote Libertarian or Green or "none of the above"
for governor. I'm a registered Green, and I will happily vote for
Green candidates for lower offices, but to keep right-wing ideologues
off the judicial benches I must vote Democratic for governor and
president. For me, it's the courts, stupid!</TE>
<TE>   Rodney Hoffman</TE>

<TE>   The two men running for governor have spent millions advertising.
I don't know why. People vote their party regardless, even when they
know their candidate isn't the best person for the job. Guess we
would have better people in office if we did away with the parties.</TE>

articulate his vision for California to capture the hearts of the
voters and give them an exciting choice.</TE>

<HD>Guy J. Pauker, 85; Rand Analyst, U.S. Consultant on
Southeast Asia</HD>
<DH>From the 1960s into the '80s, statesmen, generals and
journalists queried and quoted him on knotty international problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Guy J. Pauker, an expert on Southeast Asia who was a consultant to
the National Security Council and other federal agencies on Vietnam,
Indonesia and the Philippines from the 1960s to the 1980s, has died.
He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Pauker died Sept. 4 in Los Angeles after a long illness.</LD>
<LD>   Statesmen, generals and journalists queried and quoted Pauker for
decades on knotty international problems ranging from Indonesian
stability after Sukarno and the political value of discovering oil
and gas in the Philippines to the wisdom of pursuing Vietnam War
peace talks and whether the U.S. should become the world's police
force.</LD>
<TE>   In 1977, before uprisings in Iran, Iraq, Bosnia, Africa and
Afghanistan, Pauker prophetically outlined, in a Rand report for the
Air Force, "a breakdown of global order as a result of sharpening
confrontation between the Third World and the industrial
democracies."</TE>
<TE>   In that report, the veteran Cold War analyst cautioned the
military leaders, to whom the Vietnam debacle was still fresh:</TE>
<TE>   "In deciding to use military force for the protection of limited
national interest, a great power which is also a democracy has to be
responsive to a wide range of considerations. Should the U.S.
government be prepared to project its power into all parts of the
world where Americans may wish to travel, trade, study or engage in
any other normal and peaceful activity, in order to protect them? If
not, where should one draw the line?"</TE>
<TE>   In March 1971, Pauker was also the author of a Rand report sent to
the Pentagon and circulated to top officials, including Henry A.
Kissinger, then presidential advisor for national security affairs
and coincidentally a Harvard classmate of Pauker's. The report, kept
secret for 18 months, spoke of the futility of the Paris peace talks
as an effort to resolve the Vietnam War.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the Nixon administration advocated a twin
approach--peace talks, coupled with "Vietnamization" or creating a
South Vietnamese government strong enough to resist Communist
pressure without direct U.S. military involvement.</TE>
<TE>   The two avenues, Pauker said, "cannot be pursued simultaneously,
with equal chance of success."</TE>
<TE>   A negotiated settlement was impossible, he said, because "neither
side is willing to share power with the other, nor can one visualize
a reasonable division of power between these two mortal enemies....
[Any negotiated coalition government] would not last. No devilishly
clever Communist schemes would be necessary to bring about its
downfall."</TE>
<TE>   The author of more than 100 books and articles, Pauker was
well-schooled in international politics.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Bucharest, Romania, in 1916, he earned master's, doctoral
and law degrees from the University of Bucharest, and worked as an
editorial writer and correspondent.</TE>
<TE>   In the years after World War II, as Communists began their
takeover, Pauker served as secretary general of the Romanian
Institute for International Affairs. He also co-founded Friends of
the U.S. in Bucharest and edited its "Russian-American Review" until
Communists silenced the quarterly publication.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the political conflict, Pauker left Romania for the
U.S. in 1948, and earned a master's degree and a doctorate in social
science at Harvard, concentrating on Southeast Asia. Pauker taught
briefly at Harvard and then, from 1956 to 1963, at UC Berkeley, where
he became head of the Center for Southeast Asian Studies.</TE>
<TE>   In 1960, he also began his work for Rand in Santa Monica. For more
than two decades, he was a consultant to the National Security
Council, the State Department, the Department of Defense, the U.S.
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, the House Committee on
International Affairs and the National War College.</TE>
<TE>   He flew to Washington frequently to testify at hearings and, long
after his official retirement in 1982, journalists still sought his
opinions.</TE>
<TE>   As the Persian Gulf crisis built in 1990, for example, he
predicted for The Times that the economic effects on Southeast Asia
would range from a "disaster" in the energy-short Philippines to
"Christmas" for Indonesia, Asia's largest oil exporter.</TE>
<TE>   When a potentially large oil field was discovered in the
Philippines late that year, he told The Times:</TE>
<TE>   "The whole stability of the government is threatened by the lack
of oil. If they really have found big oil, this would be sensational
and a blessing--the greatest thing that could ever happen to them."</TE>
<TE>   Pauker is survived by his wife of 42 years, Ewa; their son,
Anthony; and one sister, Sylvia of Paris. A celebration of Pauker's
life is being planned for Saturday.</TE>

<HD>P. Wamba, 31; Author and Son of Rebel Leader</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philippe Wamba--author, journalist and the son of a Congolese
professor who became a rebel leader--has died in an automobile
accident in Kenya. He was 31.</LD>
<LD>   Wamba was driving with his brother, James, 25, and an unidentified
friend when his car struck an oncoming truck Wednesday, his cousin,
Richard Bazangoula, said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking by telephone from his home in Lynn, Mass., he said Wamba
had died of his injuries on the way to a hospital in the Indian Ocean
port of Mombasa. The brother and friend were injured, but their lives
were not in danger, Bazangoula said.</LD>
<TE>   Wamba moved from Cambridge, Mass., where he edited the Web site
Africana.com, to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in April after receiving an
Alicia Patterson journalism fellowship to write about the challenges
facing African youth in the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   From Dar es Salaam, Wamba traveled throughout Africa to learn what
young people were doing to improve their lives and those of their
communities.</TE>
<TE>   Wamba, a graduate of Harvard and the Columbia School of
Journalism, was the son of Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, one of the first
rebel leaders to take up arms against then-Congolese President
Laurent Kabila when the four-year war in Congo broke out in August
1998. His mother was Elaine Brown, an African American.</TE>
<TE>   Born in California in 1971, Philippe Wamba was raised in Boston
and Dar es Salaam. His experiences as the son of an African and as a
black American living between the United States and Africa formed the
core of his 1999 memoir "Kinship: A Family's Journey in Africa and
America," which also explores three centuries of shared history
between Africans and black Americans.</TE>
<TE>   He had been editor in chief at Africana.com since July 1999, and
his writings were published in journals in the United States, Britain
and Tanzania.</TE>
<TE>   Bazangoula said arrangements were being made for a funeral in Dar
es Salaam.</TE>

<HD>Main Aegon Shareholder to Sell 25% of Its Stake</HD>
<DH>Insurance: The transaction would raise $3.7 billion to
strengthen the Dutch company's capital and help it avoid a credit
downgrade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>AMSTERDAM</DL>
<LD>Dutch insurance company Aegon said Sunday its main shareholder will
sell a 25% stake in the group, raising about $3.7 billion in a deal
to strengthen the insurer's capital by more than $2 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The transaction will reinforce Aegon at a time when investors and
clients have grown increasingly anxious about the industry's
solvency. The deal also will help avoid a credit downgrade of one of
the world's top 10 insurers.</LD>
<LD>   Aegon recently issued its first ever profit warning and, like
other insurance companies punished by last year's economic downturn,
Aegon's shares have plunged, losing more than two-thirds of their
value this year.</LD>
<TE>   The group's chairman, Don Shepard, told a conference call that
Aegon's share price should benefit from this transaction, which will
raise the company's capital by more than 2 billion euros while
helping unravel its complicated shareholder structure.</TE>
<TE>   Aegon saw its capital fall about 11% to $13 billion as of June 30
and Standard &amp; Poor's recently warned it would cut the insurer's
credit rating if it did not boost its capital.</TE>
<TE>   Aegon is the latest insurer to look to its shareholders to provide
it with cash. Swiss Zurich Financial and Britain's Legal &amp; General
Group have already announced plans for big capital increases.</TE>
<TE>   The Dutch insurer's main shareholder, Vereniging Aegon, known as
the Association, will sell 350 million of its Aegon common shares,
reducing its voting interest in the insurance company to about 33%
from 52%.</TE>
<TE>   At least $1.5 billion of the Association's shares will be sold
directly in an offering outside the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The remainder will initially go to Aegon, which will then place
these shares in the market in an international offering, including a
public offering in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Aegon is reported to be in talks to buy a majority stake in Sony
Corp's life insurance unit, and many analysts have been worried that
any cash expenditure could jeopardize its standing with the credit
agencies.</TE>

<HD>Firms Beef Up Job of Security</HD>
<DH>Workplace: The title of chief security officer gains in
popularity, but the role remains loose and undefined.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUSTIN POPE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Digital Evolution Inc. of Santa Monica already had a chief technology
officer and plenty of security experts. What the Web services company
lacked was a point person on security.</LD>
<LD>   Or as the man ultimately hired for the job remarked, clients
wanted "one neck to choke."</LD>
<LD>   Erick Herring was hired in August 2001 as chief security officer,
a title that hardly existed two years ago. It's an increasingly
popular job title, particularly with chief executives showing more
interest in security after the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   "Senior executives, say CEOs, would call in the head of
[information technology] security and the head of physical security
into his office and say, 'Are we prepared?' " said Giga Information
Group analyst Steve Hunt. "And the two guys had never met."</TE>
<TE>   High-profile chief security officer hires over the last year have
occurred at companies such as AOL Time Warner Inc. and Sun
Microsystems, while a CSO Magazine debuts this month.</TE>
<TE>   Executive search firms also are paying attention. Christian &amp;
Timbers wasn't recruiting any CSOs a few years ago; now it does five
or six a year.</TE>
<TE>   But that doesn't mean all of corporate America is running out to
hire a CSO.</TE>
<TE>   Many companies aren't so sure they need one--or even what the
bearer of the title is supposed to be doing.</TE>
<TE>   Chief security officers mean different things to different
companies. Some handle physical security, some secure company
networks from hackers. Others, such as Herring, focus mostly on
making sure products are secure. Some do all three.</TE>
<TE>   Companies are wrestling with tough questions:</TE>
<TE>   Should one person handle physical and computer security? Should
the CSO push security at any price or find the most efficient
solution? Where does the job fit in the corporate hierarchy?</TE>
<TE>   Christian Byrnes of the research firm META Group says only about
30% of companies have the equivalent of a chief security officer,
with only about 5% of them combining physical and information
security under a single person.</TE>
<TE>   Larger companies are particularly cautious.</TE>
<TE>   When Christian &amp; Timbers surveyed 390 executives at Fortune 1000
companies in April, 95% said they needed to hire a CSO but only 25%
were ready to hire and 8% had begun recruiting.</TE>
<TE>   Hunt says even the Sept. 11 effect was minimal. Although some
companies created the CSO title, for many the job already existed
under a different name so the CSO had little new power.</TE>
<TE>   "The organizations were quick to get someone in place, but they
may not have had the power they need to effect change," said Ray
Wagner, research director at Gartner.</TE>
<TE>   Often, CSOs don't work out.</TE>
<TE>   "Life spans of 12 to 24 months are not uncommon," says Gary Lynch,
who held top information security jobs at Prudential and Chase
Manhattan and is now a consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton.</TE>
<TE>   "They become overwhelmed with operational issues and never get to
strategic issues."</TE>
<TE>   Growth projections for the job vary by sector. Giga estimates that
most software companies will have CSOs by 2009, up from 20% next
year. But in retail, the number is projected to grow to only 10%, up
from 3%.</TE>
<TE>   Many companies are waiting to see how the first wave of CSOs fare.</TE>
<TE>   Others have simply decided that an all-encompassing CSO doesn't
make sense for them.</TE>
<TE>   When Microsoft Corp. CSO Howard Schmidt, who had a military and
law enforcement background, left to work at the White House,
replacement Scott Charney was given the title of chief security
strategist.</TE>
<TE>   Charney oversees security for Microsoft products and talks to the
industry and government about security. But the company's physical
security is now handled separately.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say it may not make sense to incorporate physical
security--of a company's buildings and employees, for instance--and
computer security into one job. That's especially true for companies
that hire a law enforcement veteran with little computer experience
for a job encompassing both.</TE>
<TE>   Still, security needs depend on the industry. For a high-tech
manufacturer, for instance, protecting plants from snoopers is akin
to protecting intellectual property on a computer.</TE>
<TE>   And in large companies, the job is more a political one. The CSO
can rely on staff for technical advice.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem is that too many CSOs understand security, but not
the overall business.</TE>
<TE>   Part of a CSO's job should be to strike a balance.</TE>
<TE>   At Digital Evolution, Herring says he knows companies where the
security people throw up too many firewalls, shutting down the
company's systems too often.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who are in security say, 'That's tough. That's the
price of security,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Pulier, Digital Evolution's CEO, acknowledges that hiring a
CSO meant some cultural changes in the office. Employees were used to
reaching consensus decisions about security.</TE>
<TE>   Pulier still welcomes their feedback, but says the company needed
a single, strong voice.</TE>

<HD>Dot-Coms Stage Comeback</HD>
<DH>Investors are reviving failed Web sites with better sense
and a no-nonsense approach</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL LIEDTKE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Internet digital photo site Webshots seemed destined to dissolve
in the dot-com meltdown a year ago as its owner, Excite@Home Corp.,
prepared to go into bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   But Webshots' co-founders lobbied for another try at developing
the site into a profitable business--a goal that doesn't look as
farfetched as it appeared when Excite@Home was poised to pull the
plug.</LD>
<LD>   About 150,000 new users register at Webshots each week, up 50%
from a year ago. More important, a significant number of those users
are subscribing to the site's premium services, an about-face from
the carefree days when everything was free.</LD>
<TE>   "We have a better sense as businessmen what this space is all
about now," said Narendra Rocherolle, one of the three Webshots
co-founders who bought the site back from Excite@Home eight months
ago at pennies on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Redwood City, Calif.-based Webshots is among a few nearly dead
Internet businesses trying to reincarnate themselves under new
management teams.</TE>
<TE>   Gone is the giddiness of the bubble years. It's been replaced by a
no-nonsense approach.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be about getting the 'first mover' advantage on the
Internet," said Chris Kitze, who invested $9 million of his dot-com
fortune to revive Wine.com, one of the Web's biggest busts, with a
strategy that mostly promotes the sale of premium wines. "Now that
people have become more rational and sane, there is an understanding
that it's all about becoming the last man standing."</TE>
<TE>   It's been an excruciating education for some businesses on the
comeback trail.</TE>
<TE>   To get its second shot, high-speed Internet connections supplier
Yipes Enterprise Services Inc. went into bankruptcy in April after
burning through nearly $300 million in venture capital.</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco company had approached dozens of suitors but
couldn't find a white knight.</TE>
<TE>   In financial despair, Yipes laid off hundreds of employees, closed
several regional offices and alienated creditors by going into
bankruptcy to cleanse its balance sheet.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an ugly process," said Dennis Muse, Yipes' chief
executive.</TE>
<TE>   The reorganization helped Yipes persuade venture capitalists to
invest $54 million in a leaner business that emerged from Bankruptcy
Court in July with more than 500 customers.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Yipes has been growing about 10% a month and
conserving its money.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't spend any dollar before we absolutely have to," Muse
said.</TE>
<TE>   During the bubble years, Yipes spent about $15 million more than
it generated in revenue each month.</TE>
<TE>   The company's so-called burn rate is down to $2.2 million. Muse
expects Yipes to start generating more cash than it spends by the end
of next year.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, some of the Internet's comeback companies owe their
revival to the severity of the dot-com downturn.</TE>
<TE>   The market is so depressed that bargain hunters have been able to
snap up assets at deep discounts.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Rocherolle and his Webshots partners, Andrew
Laakmann and Nicholas Wilder, bought back their site for $2.4
million.</TE>
<TE>   Excite@Home had paid the trio $82.5 million for Webshots in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers looked great to us when we crunched them," Rocherolle
said.</TE>
<TE>   Privately held Webshots doesn't disclose its finances, but
Rocherolle said the site's revenue this year will exceed the price he
and his partners paid in January.</TE>
<TE>   Yipes faced a more daunting sales job because it had to raise
money from several of the venture capitalists who had poured $291
million into the company during the boom years.</TE>
<TE>   For lead investor Norwest Venture Partners, that meant digging
deeper into its pockets at the same time it was forced to write off
$50 million of its previous losses.</TE>
<TE>   "You gulp hard because you have to stand in front of your partners
and tell them you are going to put more money into this company that
already has cost us a lot," said Promod Haque, a Norwest managing
partner who chairs Yipes' board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, you have to decide if there is a large enough
opportunity to make it worth going through all the brain damage
required to fix the business. We decided the opportunity is there."</TE>
<TE>   Kitze regards his $9-million investment in San Francisco-based
Wine.com as a steal because venture capitalists poured $200 million
into the predecessor companies.</TE>
<TE>   Kitze can afford to take a chance because he hit the jackpot
during the dot-com boom.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Kitze merged his online site, Xoom.com, into the
now-defunct NBC Internet Inc. and sold a reported $79 million in that
company's stock. Kitze is so confident in Wine.com that he already is
talking about turning a profit in the fourth quarter. The prospect
summons up a bubble-era specialty--hyperbole.</TE>
<TE>   "If this works," Kitze said, "it will be the greatest turnaround
in the history of the Internet."</TE>

<HD>Filtering Software Poses Unwelcome Classroom Limits</HD>
<DH>Federal law requires schools to block pornographic and
other inappropriate Web sites. But students find it hinders research
access.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICK JESDANUN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dale Alexander, the information technology director for Albuquerque
public schools, was hardly a fan of filtering software designed to
block pornography and Web sites deemed inappropriate for children.</LD>
<LD>   But when Congress required it of schools that receive certain
technology grants, Alexander had no trouble deciding whether to
install the software. After all, as much as $14.7 million was at
stake.</LD>
<LD>   "There was a lot of money on the table," he said. And that
outweighed any arguments that good adult supervision--not an
imperfect filtering product--is the best solution for dealing with
unsavory online content.</LD>
<TE>   All across the country, schools are installing filters or
expanding their use despite flaws in the software, which sometimes
blocks legitimate Web sites that are needed for lessons.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, schools had to install filters by the new
school year. It was an unwelcome surprise for some students and
teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "It has left a lot of teachers scrambling to help kids get the
information they need," said Tom Henning, a high school physics
teacher in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   In one case this summer, he said, a student researching race
tracks for a paper found resources on them blocked as gambling sites.</TE>
<TE>   In Albuquerque, the swim team couldn't access sites about
swimsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The federal Children's Internet Protection Act also requires
filtering software in libraries, but that provision is on hold after
a federal court in Philadelphia struck it down as violating 1st
Amendment guarantees. An appeal is pending.</TE>
<TE>   The requirement for schools--including their libraries--was never
challenged, partly because schools typically have greater leeway in
restricting student conduct.</TE>
<TE>   While the law covers only sexually oriented materials, many
districts are using the same filters to voluntarily block sites that
feature games, shopping and violence.</TE>
<TE>   The filtering software forced Tim Kajstura, a senior at Ossining
High School in Ossining, N.Y., to choose a new senior project because
a site for Red Hat Inc., a software company he was going to profile,
mysteriously got blocked.</TE>
<TE>   "About half the sites I try to access for research on any given
topic are blocked, many of them the most useful," he said. "What's
the use of technology if we can't use it?"</TE>
<TE>   The law affects some technology grants from the Education
Department and the popular e-rate subsidies that are funded through
telephone surcharges.</TE>
<TE>   At least one district, in Eugene, Ore., has opted to reject the
grants in question--totaling about $7,000--rather than expand
filtering to all its schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Filters are imperfect and give parents and students a sense of
security that really is not there," said Les Moore, the district's
director of computing and information services.</TE>
<TE>   Filtering companies generally won't disclose the criteria they use
to block content because they consider them proprietary.</TE>
<TE>   Most schools have policies for overriding blocks. Sometimes it's
as simple as having a teacher do it. For others, it involves a
community-based review committee or the filtering company.</TE>
<TE>   Some school administrators who were reluctant to install filters
have come to accept and even embrace them as useful for managing Net
resources and keeping students focused on the curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   And though technically savvy students have found ways to fool and
bypass filters, administrators say such attempts are rare and can be
easily dealt with by threatening to cut off Internet privileges.</TE>
<TE>   "The feeling from parents and staff both was, 'Why didn't we have
this in place already?' " said Bob Stocking, director of
instructional technology and media for Chapel Hill-Carrboro City
Schools in North Carolina. "We never heard from parents concerned
about students' 1st Amendment rights."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, with Net use more pervasive and filtering technology
improving, it's no longer practical to rely solely on teachers to
supervise Web surfing, said Bob Moore, executive director of
information technology at Blue Valley School District near Kansas
City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Moore worries filters could prevent kids from
learning skills they will need as adults.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't teach safety to kids in a basement. You have to get
them out in the real world," he said. "Are we going to be able to
teach our students Internet safety and effective use of the Internet
in a gated community? We won't know that for years."</TE>
<TE>   A National Research Council study in May concluded that simply
passing laws or blocking computer access won't protect children from
online pornography.</TE>
<TE>   But even without the law, schools were already moving toward
filters.</TE>
<TE>   An Education Department study found that 74% filtered at least
some computers in 2000, when the law was enacted. N2H2 Inc., a
leading maker of filtering software for schools, saw sales jump last
quarter by more than 75%.</TE>
<TE>   Some districts, such as Jefferson County, Colo., have been obliged
to expand filters to all schools, instead of letting individual
schools decide.</TE>
<TE>   Others, including Louisiana's Caddo Public Schools, had to develop
Internet usage policies to go with existing filters.</TE>
<TE>   Henning, the San Francisco teacher, worries that many kids will
simply give up when filters erect research barriers. To make matters
worse, he said, the schools that depend most on the federal grants
are the poorer ones with a high proportion of underachievers.</TE>
<TE>   "This law doesn't add anything to our classroom," he said. "It
creates troubles, distractions and barriers to learning."</TE>

<HD>Gasoline Prices Stay Steady for More Than 5 Months</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gas prices have held steady for more than five months, dropping less
than a penny over the last three weeks, a gasoline industry analyst
said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "The price continues to be nearly flat, which is in great contrast
to prior years," analyst Trilby Lundberg said.</LD>
<LD>   The average price for gas nationwide, including all grades and
taxes, was about $1.45 a gallon Friday, according to the Lundberg
survey of 8,000 stations released Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Prices have shown little change since early April, when a gallon
of gas cost about $1.46, Lundberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, prices were more volatile. In early April, they were
about $1.54 and climbed to $1.76 in mid-May before falling to $1.51
by late August. In 2000 it was the same pattern: A gallon of gas cost
$1.57 in early April, jumped to $1.71 in late June and fell to $1.55
by late August.</TE>
<TE>   This year's flat prices are due to stability in crude oil prices
and consistent production at U.S. refineries, Lundberg said. And
those conditions are expected to continue.</TE>
<TE>   "There does not seem to be any immediate reason to predict the end
of crude oil price stability," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Gas today remains more than a dime cheaper than a year ago. On
Sept. 7, 2001, the average weighted price for a gallon of gas was
about $1.56, Lundberg said.</TE>
<TE>   The national weighted average price of gasoline, including taxes,
at self-serve pumps Friday was about $1.42 per gallon for regular,
$1.52 for mid-grade and $1.60 for premium.</TE>

<HD>Future Retirees to Shoulder More Health-Care Expenses,
Study Says</HD>
<DH>Benefits: Companies are expected to pay less than 10% of
medical costs for elderly ex-workers by 2031.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Future retirees should expect to cover substantially more, if not
all, of the costs of their health care, as employers increasingly
reduce or eliminate retirement medical benefits, according to a study
expected to be released today.</LD>
<LD>   Few workers today are ready for this significant change, according
to the study's authors, who add that if today's workers don't save
more to finance both living and potential medical expenses they may
have to work considerably longer.</LD>
<LD>   Companies are expected to pay less than 10% of total medical
expenses for retirees by 2031 as the result of cutbacks already
underway, according to the report by Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a human
resources consulting firm.</LD>
<TE>   Large employers now typically pay more than half of total retiree
medical expenses, a benefit that's particularly valuable to those who
retire early. Those who wait until age 65 have the bulk of routine
medical costs covered by Medicare and generally have retiree plans
that provide supplemental coverage, such as reimbursement for
prescription drugs. But increasing health-care costs--as well as an
accounting change that makes companies set aside money to address the
future cost of promised benefit plans--are forcing companies to scale
back how much they are willing to offer.</TE>
<TE>   "The burden on future retirees to pay for their own medical costs
is increasing dramatically," said Sylvester J. Schieber, Watson Wyatt
vice president and an author of the study. "If you can't save more,
you are either going to face a lower standard of living or a longer
work life."</TE>
<TE>   Some employees already are working longer simply because of health
care, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "I already know people who don't retire--or find part-time jobs in
retirement--so they can keep their health benefits as long as
possible," said Martin J. Smith, benefits specialist at the Los
Angeles law firm of Sheppard Mullin Richter &amp; Hampton.</TE>
<TE>   About 20% of U.S. employers studied have eliminated retiree
medical benefits for new hires; an additional 17% will allow new
hires to remain on the company plan but require that they pay the
full premiums, the report said. Other companies are capping their
contributions, linking them to the retiree's length of service or
imposing stricter minimum-service requirements.</TE>
<TE>   The study is based on benefit plans of 56 large employers with at
least 5,000 employees. The growing population of retirees, rising
life expectancies and an uncertain business outlook also are
contributing to the trend.</TE>
<TE>   But workers are being confronted by health-care concerns even
before retirement nears. Workers now are paying more as their
benefits erode, a study released this month by the Henry J. Kaiser
Family Foundation found.</TE>
<TE>   The average premium increase for employers was 13%, the highest
since 1990--and marked the second straight year of double-digit
inflation, according to the Kaiser study. Single premiums are now on
average $3,060, with $7,954 for family coverage.</TE>
<TE>   The amount workers pay for coverage also has risen substantially.
Employees now pay an average of $454 a year for single coverage, a
26% increase from last year. Family coverage averaged $2,084 a year,
up 16%. For the first time in four years, more workers experienced a
cut in benefits than an increase.</TE>
<TE>   Retiree medical benefits were relatively inexpensive in the early
1960s, and the introduction of Medicare in 1965 made the benefits
even more affordable. But the cost of maintaining those benefits has
surged.</TE>
<TE>   Nine of 10 large employers that offered retiree medical benefits
to workers older than 65 in 1984 required service of five years or
less. Last year, only about a quarter offered that benefit, according
to Watson Wyatt. For future retirees, only about 14% allow workers to
qualify as quickly.</TE>

<KH>A YEAR AFTER</KH>
<HD>Insurance Prices, Restrictions Are Up</HD>
<DH>Coverage: The industry's response to terrorism has led to
30% rate increases for commercial properties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The attacks that shattered American notions of security a year ago
also exposed how commercial insurers misjudged the threat of
terrorism, an error they've since corrected with a vengeance by
charging far higher premiums for far more restrictive policies.</LD>
<LD>   When the World Trade Center towers collapsed, the insurance
industry was recovering from a competitive battle that had many
insurers providing coverage at a loss in an effort to build market
share. With profits from stock investments--which had covered
underwriting losses in the 1990s--evaporating and claims from storms
and other disasters rising, property insurers already were
restricting coverages and raising premiums sharply.</LD>
<LD>   But the terrorist attacks, which caused the single largest loss in
the industry's history, revealed what investor Warren Buffett, whose
central holdings are insurance companies, called a "fundamental
underwriting mistake."</LD>
<TE>   The industry, Buffett told investors in his Berkshire Hathaway
Inc., had failed to look ahead, training its attention on only
traditional perils: "windstorm, fire, explosion and earthquake ...
thereby assuming a huge terrorism risk for which we received no
premium."</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, the industry changed all that. Reinsurers such as
Berkshire's General Re, which spread risk by insuring other insurers,
quickly dropped terrorism coverage. Regulators in 45 states approved
a standard industry form that essentially gave primary insurers
blanket permission to stop including terrorism in standard policies.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators in California, one of the exceptions, required insurers
to apply to exclude terrorism one line of coverage at a time. By July
24, the last time figures were compiled, state regulators had
approved 392 such exclusion requests, said Insurance Department
spokeswoman Nanci Kramer.</TE>
<TE>   Since the federal government has yet to adopt a backstop plan to
absorb some terrorism costs, the terrorism coverage that is available
from a few insurers, including Berkshire Hathaway, is a high-priced
add-on, with higher deductibles and more exclusions--or part of a
package at drastically higher prices.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent survey of corporate insurance buyers, Prudential
Securities found that nearly two-thirds of businesses expect to do
without terrorism coverage and 14% expect to have it, but with lower
coverage limits than for other types of insurance. Only 24%
anticipated having full coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance Rates Climb</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the attacks reinforced the trend to hike rates across
all lines of property insurance, not just those directly threatened
by terrorism, ultimately strengthening insurers' financial
position--albeit aggravating their customers.</TE>
<TE>   If not for Sept. 11, these broad increases "might have proven
difficult in some insurance lines because of ample surplus capital,
intense price competition and the challenge of raising rates during a
recession," Bryan Gobin, an insurance specialist at consulting firm
Economy.com, said in a recent report.</TE>
<TE>   Annual rate increases for commercial property insurance, which
were running at 10% to 15% before the attacks, average 30% today,
with casualty coverage including workers' compensation and
professional liability up 20% to 25%, said economist Robert Hartwig
of the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group. Insurers'
premium revenue from writing commercial insurance policies is
expected to rise 20% this year, Hartwig said.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of increase varies widely, Hartwig notes, with some
small businesses in remote locations hardly affected. But for
businesses most likely to be affected by terrorism, "the effect has
been extraordinary," said Santa Ana attorney Boyd F. Jensen II, who
represents operators of amusement parks, a sector that along with
high-rise towers, stadiums and other landmark properties has been
socked with huge insurance rate increases.</TE>
<TE>   One amusement park company recently was turned down by two large
commercial carriers that previously had offered coverage, Boyd said.
Other policies were so expensive that the company finally cut costs
by raising its deductible from $10,000 to $100,000, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Though extreme, that example shows the strains that are being
placed on businesses across the country by a catastrophe whose final
cost has been estimated at $30 billion to $70 billion. The latest
estimate from the Insurance Information Institute is that the total
insured loss from Sept. 11 will be $40.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Some Claims in Dispute</TE>
<TE>   Business interruption is likely to be the biggest single loss
category for the industry, accounting for $11 billion, or 27%, of the
total loss, the insurance institute estimates.</TE>
<TE>   But many such claims remain open because records needed to
document losses were destroyed in the attack, or because the
businesses still are operating out of temporary quarters and
receiving payments until they establish a new permanent location.</TE>
<TE>   Although the industry received high marks for not invoking war
exclusions, and for the speed with which foreign insurers stepped up
to bear their half-share of the liability, some disputes over
coverage have emerged.</TE>
<TE>   The industry has refused to pay business-interruption claims by
airports and hotels far from the cordoned-off disaster zones of Lower
Manhattan--facilities that nonetheless suffered huge indirect losses
when the Federal Aviation Administration grounded air traffic after
the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those locations, including airports in Chicago and Las
Vegas, have asked courts to force the insurers to pay. Hartwig
estimated that the lawsuits, if successful, would add less than $1
billion to the insurers' liability.</TE>
<TE>   A potentially more costly dispute involves World Trade Center
leaseholder Larry Silverstein and a group of 20 insurers led by Swiss
Re, a big Zurich-based reinsurer. The insurers contend that the trade
center attacks constituted one catastrophic event for insurance
purposes, while Silverstein argues that each of the two jetliner
crashes was a separate event.</TE>
<TE>   Should Silverstein prevail, the industry will be required to pay
$7 billion for Twin Towers property damage instead of $3.5 billion,
Hartwig said.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance rates for most home and auto coverage, although rising
because of other factors, showed little direct effect from Sept. 11,
since less than 2% of the loss involved personal property, said
Gordon Stewart, president of the insurance institute.</TE>
<TE>   But the psychological effects of the attacks affected the life
insurance industry. Within a month of the attacks, 6% of Americans
bought or increased their life insurance, according to a Harris
Interactive poll, and sales were 15% greater in the fourth quarter of
2001 than in the same period a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street has judged the industry more positively since Sept.
11. A Standard &amp; Poor's index of property and casualty insurers that
stood at 217.45 the day before the attacks climbed as high as 261.64
in April, a 20% gain, as investors decided that premiums were certain
to rise.</TE>
<TE>   The index then fell 28% to 188.79 in July amid a general sell-off
in stocks and fears about insurers' liability for the waves of
corporate scandals and shareholder lawsuits sweeping the country.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the index has climbed back up to 211.42 at Friday's
close--a loss of 2.8% since the attacks, compared with an 18.6%
decline for the S&amp;P 500.</TE>

<HD>Jollibee Struggling to Expand in U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jollibee, the biggest fast-food chain in the Philippines, came to
California four years ago with hopes that its pineapple-topped
burgers and spaghetti-and-hot dog concoctions would fuel a rapid U.S.
expansion.</LD>
<LD>   But with just eight stores in California, Jollibee has only half
the restaurants it expected to have by now, and Jollibee Foods Corp.
officials said per-store sales are 30% below projections.</LD>
<LD>   Although Jollibee has been a hit with Filipino immigrants,
restaurant industry experts say the company has struggled to reach
mainstream fast-food customers. With a limited marketing budget and
only a handful of stores, few outside the Filipino American community
know the chain.</LD>
<TE>   Then there's the food. Some say the chain's Filipino-inspired
sweet-and-spicy meals are too exotic and its American-style offerings
lack distinction.</TE>
<TE>   "It really isn't that much different from what you'd find at a big
banquet that wasn't well catered," said Hal Sieling, a Carlsbad
restaurant consultant who recently ate at a Jollibee near San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "For somebody who's grown up on traditional fast food like Burger
King and McDonald's, Jollibee might be too unusual," said Randall
Hiatt, president of Fessel International, a Costa Mesa-based
restaurant consulting firm. "It's a tough sell."</TE>
<TE>   Jollibee executives acknowledge some disappointment at the chain's
reception. But they think Jollibee's variety of menu items, strong
brand recognition among Asian immigrants and improved offerings will
turn things around.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be a major fast-food player here," said Melvin Claros,
U.S. operations manager for Jollibee Foods. "We might not be there
right now, but we'll eventually get there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Expansion Plans</TE>
<TE>   Claros said the chain, which plans to open two more California
stores by year's end, soon would use Angus ground beef and bigger
patties for its burgers. The company also has high hopes for a new
sandwich named The Works, a $4.49, 1/3-pound burger with sweet
onions, American cheese, mushrooms, bacon and pickles.</TE>
<TE>   The company is counting on these and other improvements, including
a new design at future stores, to fuel its expansion. Plans call for
opening at least five stores a year for the next decade, including
entry into the fast-food markets in Hawaii and Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Restaurant industry consultants and Jollibee officials agree that
reaching a mainstream audience is key. Non-Asians make up less than
one-third of Jollibee's customers, said Mike Navarrete, chief
financial officer for Jollibee Foods. That inability to tap into a
larger market has hurt sales, which are about $1.1 million per store,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   California also has higher wage costs than the Philippines, and as
a result Jollibee's U.S. units have about one-quarter as many workers
as the typical restaurant in the Philippines, Navarrete said.</TE>
<TE>   With fewer workers to greet customers and pick up their trays
after they finish their meals, service at the California restaurants
isn't as good as in the Philippines, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jollibee's growth also has been stymied by the difficulty of
finding good sites for new restaurants, company officials said. In
some cases, they say, landowners have opted to lease locations sought
by Jollibee to its bigger fast-food rivals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Fast-Food Fatigue'</TE>
<TE>   Like other quick-service operators, Jollibee also must grapple
with what one analyst has called "fast-food fatigue." After years of
downing burgers and fries, consumers increasingly are looking for
fresher and more healthful alternatives. As fast-casual chains such
as Panera Bread Co. and Baja Fresh sizzle, fast food is wilting,
growing at just 1% to 2% annually, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean Jollibee lacks fans.</TE>
<TE>   At a restaurant in Cerritos, Anamari Villamil, a 26-year-old
respiratory therapist, downed two portions of spaghetti. The Chino
Hills resident said she drove more than 45 minutes to eat at
Jollibee, which she frequented as a high school student in the
Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   "We need one of these where I live," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her friend, Hazel Dumlao of Garden Grove, said eating at Jollibee
feels "like you're in the Philippines, like you're back home."</TE>
<TE>   Jollibee got its start in Manila in 1978, when entrepreneur Tony
Tan converted a few ice cream parlors into fast-food restaurants.
Borrowing from the Golden Arches, he adopted a red-and-yellow color
scheme and his own version of Ronald McDonald: "Jollibee," a
grinning, Tuxedo-clad bee.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, McDonald's Corp. entered Manila, with its
sights trained on Jollibee. But Tan refused to buckle, focusing more
on providing good service and tweaking food to local tastes, the
company said. The result: Jollibee stung McDonald's. There are now
465 Jollibee outlets in the Philippines, versus 237 McDonald's.</TE>
<TE>   Jollibee Foods, which includes Jollibee, Greenwich Pizza, Chowking
and two other restaurant concepts, posted an $11.4-million profit on
sales of $467 million in 2001, compared with an $18.2-million profit
on revenue of $407 million the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   The company's nearly 900 outlets include locations in Hong Kong,
Guam and Brunei.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Community Ties</TE>
<TE>   To drum up business, Jollibee forges close ties with the local
Filipino community, said Noli Tingzon, vice president of U.S.
operations. The company sponsors youth baseball tournaments and
offers discounts to churches and schools.</TE>
<TE>   It also targets communities with 10,000 to 12,000 Filipinos within
a two-mile radius. The first U.S. Jollibee opened in Daly City,
Calif.; other cities with its restaurants include Long Beach and San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Still, industry officials remain skeptical whether Jollibee can
ever rival the big fast-food chains here, let alone in states with
smaller immigrant populations. There are nearly 1 million Filipino
Americans in California, according to the 2000 Census, but that still
amounts to less than 3% of the state population.</TE>
<TE>   "Jollibee can do well in places where the brand represents a taste
of home," said Dennis Lombardi of Technomic Inc., a restaurant
research and consulting firm in Chicago. "But that's a whole lot
different from going into places like Boise, Idaho, Cedar Rapids and
Pittsburgh."</TE>

<HD>California Economy Already Recovering</HD>
<DH>Forecast: The Southland will lead the comeback while the
Bay Area struggles, LAEDC says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California already is recuperating from last year's mild downturn,
but the hard-hit San Francisco Bay Area probably will continue to
stumble well into 2003 and beyond.</LD>
<LD>   Those are some of the predictions in a forecast expected to be
released today by the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.,
which projects that Southern California will continue to be the
state's growth engine as it moves out of recession.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, Southern California managed to squeak by the recession
altogether, according to the LAEDC's calculations, ending 2001 with
employment growth and a razor-thin 0.9% increase in its share of the
gross state product. The five-county region is expected to add a
modest 22,900 jobs this year, jumping to 133,500 in 2003, when the
area's gross product is projected to surge 4.7%.</LD>
<TE>   The outlook isn't so sunny for Northern California, which
continues to suffer the fallout from the popped technology bubble.
The LAEDC expects three major metropolitan areas--San Francisco, San
Jose and Oakland--to lose 80,500 jobs this year and regain only about
half of those in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The tech sector isn't expected to pick up much next year, outside
of security and homeland defense applications, while
telecommunications may not see glimmers of improvement until at least
2004. Sluggish international travel has pummeled tourism in San
Francisco, which also is experiencing a glut of office space.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a pretty dreary year in the Bay Area," said Jack
Kyser, chief economist with the LAEDC. "Their recovery is going to be
very slow."</TE>
<TE>   Though Southern California evaded the worst of the downturn, it
didn't get away unscathed. Slumps in tourism, construction, film
production, international trade, aircraft production and
manufacturing hobbled Los Angeles County, which posted virtually no
growth in its share of the state gross product in 2001. Lingering
weakness will result in the loss of nearly 24,000 jobs in the county
this year, the forecast said.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that international trade, mostly imports through
the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, has rebounded sharply. That
sector is expected to give the local economy a lift if current labor
talks at the docks don't derail. Defense projects, including
production of Northrop Grumman Corp.'s portion of the F-35 Joint
Strike Fighter in Palmdale, should boost aerospace jobs slightly in
L.A. County next year. Tourism also is expected to post a modest gain
in 2003. The LAEDC projects that county employment will grow by more
than 60,000 jobs, or 1.5%, next year.</TE>
<TE>   The Inland Empire will continue to lead the Southland in job
growth, according to the forecast. San Bernardino and Riverside
counties are expected to post 3.5% nonfarm employment growth this
year, advancing to 4.1%, or more than 44,000 jobs, next year.</TE>
<TE>   As a whole, California will lose 20,400 jobs this year and its
gross product will inch ahead by 0.8% after declining 2.3% last year,
according to the LAEDC. The slowdown cost California a notch in its
ranking among the world's leading economies, where it currently ranks
sixth behind the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain and France.</TE>
<TE>   Preliminary data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development had indicated that California had knocked off France
to grab the fifth spot. Revised data now show that France managed to
hold its position with $1.310 trillion in gross product in 2001, just
ahead of California's $1.309 trillion. But LAEDC economists said that
ranking could change once the state's tech sector recovers.</TE>

<HD>German Government OKs Mobilcom Aid</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The company, which had said it was heading for
bankruptcy, will get a $388-million bailout package.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>The German government announced a $388-million bailout package for
cell phone operator Mobilcom, which had said it was heading for
bankruptcy after shareholder France Telecom cut off funding last
week.</LD>
<LD>   The move Sunday by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's government as
well as the state of Schleswig-Holstein saves some 5,500 jobs, at
least temporarily, a week before Sept. 22 national elections.</LD>
<LD>   The package, announced by Economy Minister Werner Mueller,
includes $311 million in loans from the Kreditanstalt fuer
Wiederaufbau, a government-controlled bank. Some $48.5 million is to
be made available to the firm immediately, and the rest in the coming
year. Mobilcom had said it needed at least $194 million to continue
operations for half a year and to restructure.</LD>
<TE>   Mobilcom was among six companies that paid $8.2 million apiece in
2000 for licenses to offer so-called third-generation, or 3G, phone
services in Germany. Such services have enough capacity to offer
high-speed Internet access and other data capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   But the new service remains unproved and has yet to generate
revenue, and companies face the extra burden of building expensive
networks in Germany and elsewhere just as they struggle with sluggish
European economies.</TE>
<TE>   The costs of building the 3G network were at the heart of the
clash between France Telecom, which is 55% owned by the French
government, and Mobilcom's founder and former chief executive,
Gerhard Schmid.</TE>
<TE>   Schmid wanted France Telecom to pay more and build faster, while
France Telecom wanted to find another partner to share costs.</TE>
<TE>   France Telecom, struggling to cope with large debts of its own,
currently owns 28.5% of Mobilcom and is reluctant to put up more
cash. The French firm's chairman, Michel Bon, resigned ahead of
record losses posted Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Schmid, who owns a 40% stake, has tried without success to force
France Telecom to buy him out and take full control of Mobilcom.</TE>

Pascagoula, Miss., was awarded a $1.9-billion contract to build four
more destroyers at the rate of one per year through fiscal 2005.</LD>
<TE>   The DDG-51 is the Navy's top destroyer. It is equipped with the
Aegis weapon system, which allows it to track, detect and destroy
multiple aircraft targets. The Navy has taken delivery of about 34
DDG-51s in earlier multiyear contracts, and may buy as many as 64 of
the ships. The Navy estimates that the total production cost for the
Aegis destroyer fleet may be as much as $62 billion, once all
purchases are completed.</TE>
<TE>   The contracts, awarded late Friday, marks the completion of a Navy
arrangement to shift shipbuilding work between the companies to
increase efficiency and cut costs.</TE>
<TE>   Bath Iron Works transferred work to Northrop to produce the Navy's
new San Antonio class amphibious warfare vessel. The so-called
ship-swap agreement, developed by Navy acquisitions chief John Young,
required the Navy to give Bath more destroyer work.</TE>
<TE>   To give Bath the additional destroyer under the arrangement, the
Navy in February will propose in its fiscal 2004 budget the purchase
of three destroyers instead of the two planned last year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Fiber-optic network builder Global Crossing Ltd. said it would file
its reorganization plan today with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan.</LD>
<LD>   The core of the plan is expected to be a $250-million cash
infusion from two Asian companies that negotiated with the company's
executives and creditors.</LD>
<LD>   A court hearing on a disclosure statement, which provides details
of the plan, is set for Oct. 21. Global Crossing expects a majority
of creditors to accept the plan and the court to approve it.</LD>
<TE>   The two Asian companies, Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. in Hong Kong and
Singapore Technologies Telemedia Ltd., agreed last month to put $250
million into the company for 61.5% of the stock. Creditors would
receive $175 million in senior notes and 6% of the equity,
bondholders would get 32.5% of the stock and one class of debt
holders would get $25 million worth of notes. Shareholders would get
nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's initial petition in January listed assets of
$22.4 billion and debt of $12.4 billion.</TE>

<HD>Profit Warnings, Talk of War Could Hurt Stocks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks are heading into a tense week amid mounting talk of war and
the steady patter of profit warnings, which could keep investors
sidelined after a three-week string of declines.</LD>
<LD>   "It's kind of a standoff right now," said Philip Dow, director of
equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher. "Most people are hampered. They
see no urgency in doing anything right now."</LD>
<LD>   Iraq flatly rejected President Bush's demand for a swift and
unconditional return of U.N. arms inspectors on Friday, bringing
closer the prospect of a second Gulf War. The specter of war has hung
over stocks for weeks now as investors worry over its effect on the
fragile economic recovery.</LD>
<TE>   The earnings-warning season kicks into high gear this week as many
companies disclose that third-quarter earnings will land shy of
analysts' consensus estimates. This could prove especially dismal as
Wall Street's earlier expectations for profit growth prove too lofty
in the sluggish economy.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expect third-quarter earnings at companies in the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 to rise 10.9% from the year-ago period,
according to Thomson First Call. That's down from expectations of
16.6% growth at the start of the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   This week a few companies will beat the October earnings rush and
release their quarterly earnings: Oracle Corp., the world's No. 2
software company; Best Buy Co., the nation's No. 1 consumer
electronics retailer, and its rival, No. 2 Circuit City Group; and
investment bank Bear Stearns Cos. are among the companies set to
release financial results this week.</TE>

<HD>Report: EU Economy Lags Behind U.S.'</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The European Union's economy continues to lag behind the United
States', and the average EU country's economy is worse in most
respects than the U.S., the World Economic Forum will report today.</LD>
<LD>   "There is no beating around the bush--Europe continues to
under-perform, intra-regional differences notwithstanding," said Anne
Mettler, director for Europe at the forum, which is hosting its
seventh annual European Economic Summit in Salzburg, Austria, this
week.</LD>
<LD>   "Over the last decade, annual economic growth averaged around
2.5%, almost one percentage point less than in the U.S. This year,
the consensus forecasts EU output to expand by a mere 1.25%,
considerably below what the U.S. economy is expected to achieve," she
said.</LD>
<TE>   The forum said the best-performing economy in the EU was Finland,
which it said was consistently on a par with the U.S. in many areas.
The report was prepared by the forum and the Centre for European
Integration Studies.</TE>
<TE>   The weakest-performing economies in the EU were Portugal, Spain,
Italy and Greece. Of the 10 EU accession candidates, the strongest
performers were Estonia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia.</TE>
<TE>   Mettler said that unemployment in the EU continued to be a
problem. "Unemployment in the U.S. appears to be leveling off, while
in the EU it continues to increase from an already significantly
higher level," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The full report will be released at the WEF summit of political
and business leaders, which takes place today and Tuesday.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An economic report on U.S. industrial production is expected to show
this week that a factory rebound has lost speed because companies are
reluctant to add to stockpiles.</LD>
<LD>   Industrial production rose 0.2% last month, a Federal Reserve
report probably will show Tuesday. That would match July's gain,
which was the smallest increase since April. Monthly production gains
averaged 0.4% in the first half of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Business inventories rose 0.2% in July, the same pace as a month
earlier, as retailers keep stockpiles of unsold goods lean, the
Commerce Department is expected to report today. Wal-Mart Stores
Inc., the world's largest retailer, is among merchants that have been
trying to reduce the amount of time that goods sit on store shelves.</LD>
<TE>   Consumers are spending mainly during sales, helping keep inflation
in check. The consumer price index, the most widely followed gauge of
U.S. inflation, probably rose 0.2% in August, matching the average
increase for the first seven months of the year. Excluding volatile
food and energy prices, the so-called core index probably rose 0.2%
as well. The Labor Department releases the report Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   A report on manufacturing in the Philadelphia region is likely to
show that the factory rebound remained slow in September. The Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia is expected to report Thursday that its
factory gauge rose to 2 this month from minus 3.1 in August.</TE>

<HD>Sallie Mae Rival to Sue Over Loan Consolidation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A competitor of SLM Corp. plans to file suit in federal court today,
charging the giant student loan and college finance company, widely
known as Sallie Mae, with trying to force thousands of student
borrowers to continue to do business with it.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is student loan consolidation, a process by which
borrowers who have more than one loan at variable rates can merge
them into a single, fixed-rate note. Such consolidations are highly
desirable at the moment for many students because they can lock in
historically low interest rates. Rates on student loans have dropped
below 4%, in some cases.</LD>
<LD>   The rate is set by a federal formula, but some lenders offer
special programs, such as discounts for electronic payment or for a
certain number of months of on-time payments, for which a borrower
might shop.</LD>
<TE>   However, the rules say a borrower whose loans are all held by the
same lender must consolidate with that lender, a provision known as
the single-holder rule. "Borrowers whose notes are with different
holders can use any of the 4,000 lenders in the program, provided
they make consolidation loans," said Mark Brenner of College Loan
Corp. of San Diego, the plaintiff.</TE>
<TE>   In the suit, CLC plans to accuse Sallie Mae of intentionally
misapplying the single-holder rule by contending that all of its
affiliates constitute a single holder and that the company remains
the holder of loans it has bought and packaged into securities for
sale to investors.</TE>
<TE>   CLC officials said they plan to charge that Sallie Mae's position
that its affiliates constitute a single holder is the opposite of
what it argued several years ago in a dispute with the government
over so-called offset fees that Congress imposed on the company when
it was a government-sponsored enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Sallie Mae said: "Since we opened for business
nearly 30 years ago, Sallie Mae has followed the letter and spirit of
all applicable laws and regulations. While we have not seen a copy of
this filing, we are confident that our policies and procedures are,
as they always have been, consistent with the rules followed by the
hundreds of companies who compete in the student loan marketplace."</TE>

<HD>OPEC Expected to Raise Oil Production Target</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>OPEC is expected to agree this week to boost production quotas for
the first time in two years, as a 45% surge in oil prices threatens
to slow demand and spur rivals to boost output, investors and traders
said.</LD>
<LD>   The group will raise its target by about 950,000 barrels a day, or
4.4%, according to forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of 24 analysts. An
increase would send U.S. oil prices down by $2 a barrel from almost
$30 now, the survey showed. Twenty of the analysts expected an
increase, and the rest saw no change.</LD>
<LD>   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets
Thursday in Osaka, Japan, as the threat of war in Iraq and the
approach of an annual peak in demand threaten to drive prices higher.
OPEC pumps a third of the world's crude oil, and some members are
concerned that more supply and a slowing U.S. economy may cause
prices to plunge.</LD>
<TE>   "This is probably the most important OPEC meeting for quite some
time," said Mario Traviati, a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst in
Singapore, who expects an increase of 1 million to 1.5 million
barrels a day from 21.7 million. "For almost the last two years it's
always been a question of, 'How much are they going to cut?' "</TE>

<HD>GM Makes New Offer to Canadian Union</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp.'s latest contract offer to the Canadian Auto
Workers union moves talks "toward a settlement as opposed to a
strike," CAW President Buzz Hargrove said ahead of a Tuesday
deadline.</LD>
<LD>   The car maker submitted a proposed contract Sunday that removes
lump-sum pay boosts in favor of percentage gains and eliminates an
earlier proposal to reduce cost-of-living increases, Hargrove said at
a news conference.</LD>
<LD>   GM initially proposed a 3% raise for the union's 18,700 CAW
members in the first year of a new contract, followed by lump-sum
payments in the second and third years, Hargrove said. With such
payments, hourly wage rates don't rise, something the union opposed.</LD>
<TE>   The union's contracts with Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler also
expire Tuesday. The union chose GM as the so-called target auto maker
to be the focus of negotiations, and only GM faces a Tuesday strike
deadline. After reaching an agreement with GM, the union will try to
adapt that contract to Ford and Chrysler.</TE>

<HD>Drug Firms Await Ruling on Generic Form of Prilosec</HD>
<DH>Health: Rivals want to make cheaper copies of the heartburn
medicine, which pulls in $6 billion a year for AstraZeneca.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JED SELTZER</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The drawn-out court battle over heartburn drug Prilosec is giving
industry watchers indigestion.</LD>
<LD>   The judge's ruling in this case--after a trial in a New York
courtroom that stretched from early December 2001 through mid-July of
this year--should determine whether generic drug makers are allowed
to sell cut-rate copycat versions of the blockbuster medicine, which
pulls in $6 billion per year for Anglo-Swedish drug maker
AstraZeneca.</LD>
<LD>   As Congress and consumer groups mull how to address the soaring
costs of prescription drugs, insurance companies, uninsured Americans
and retirees stand to benefit from the introduction of cheap generic
forms of a widely used medicine with a hefty price tag of more than
$120 per month.</LD>
<TE>   Since the trial ended this summer, speculation about the timing of
U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones' decision has been rampant.</TE>
<TE>   Jones has been at the center of some high-profile cases, such as a
trial this year aiming to force MasterCard and Visa to open up the
U.S. credit-card business.</TE>
<TE>   She is now presiding over the closely watched fraud case against
former WorldCom Inc. executives in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Drug industry analysts and observers expressed wildly divergent
views about the news Jones would be taking on the WorldCom case. Some
believed it signified a swift ending to the Prilosec matter, while
others speculated that she would be distracted by the WorldCom case
and would be unable to quickly finish writing a ruling on Prilosec.</TE>
<TE>   "Judge Jones has other criminal matters but we would expect the
public interest in the WorldCom case might create upfront demands
that may slow final preparation of the Prilosec decision," Sanford
Bernstein analyst Catherine Arnold said in a recent research note.</TE>
<TE>   "An alternative view circulating in the market is that the judge
accepted assignment of this case because she is done or almost done
with her legal opinion of the Prilosec trial," Arnold wrote. "Her
acceptance" of the WorldCom matter "may have nothing to do with the
status of the Prilosec case."</TE>
<TE>   Each day that copycats are delayed, AstraZeneca saves more than $5
million in sales that could have been lost to generic rivals. The
company's main patent protection ended last Oct. 5. Prilosec was the
world's top-selling drug in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' history does not suggest a rapid resolution, according to
some analysts. She has a reputation for writing thorough decisions
unlikely to be overturned on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts attended every day of the 7 1/2-month trial or sent
legal advisors to help decipher the proceedings. Several say they
check with the court in southern Manhattan daily to see if a decision
is forthcoming, even though the judge's chambers rebuffs all
questions.</TE>
<TE>   AstraZeneca has a lot to lose. If its patents on the method of
making Prilosec are invalidated, it would lose its U.S. monopoly over
the drug and would likely face challenges over the validity of its
patent protection on second-generation heartburn drug Nexium.
AstraZeneca is heavily marketing Nexium to persuade doctors to switch
patients to the newer drug in anticipation of losing exclusivity for
Prilosec.</TE>
<TE>   An AstraZeneca executive said last week the company was prepared
for an announcement "any day," adding it was unclear what
significance--if any--Jones' deployment on the WorldCom case would
have on the timing.</TE>
<TE>   AstraZeneca has prepared a series of different draft press
releases to react to various potential patent rulings, and the
company expects to get only 15 minutes' warning of the judgment
before it is made public.</TE>
<TE>   Drug giant Merck &amp; Co. receives the proceeds of more than 30% of
U.S. Prilosec sales, which translates into more than $1 billion a
year, from a deal with AstraZeneca. So Merck also benefits each day
generics are delayed.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, small generic drug companies have a lot to gain.
Andrx Corp., the company leading the charge to take Prilosec generic,
could generate $500 million during a six-month generic exclusivity
period. That compares with its current annual revenue of less than $1
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Andrx's stock has been on a wild ride since the trial began in
early December, topping $70 at the start of the year but sinking to
just above $20 as the trial dragged on. In Nasdaq trading Friday,
Andrx stock fell 41 cents to $24.65.</TE>

<HD>Funds Sent Home to Mexico Likely to Rise</HD>
<DH>Finances: Remittances reached $8.9 billion last year and
could increase 10% to 20%, council says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Money sent to Mexico by relatives in the United States is likely to
increase 10% to 20% this year, and hundreds of thousands of families
depend heavily on the funds, the government Population Council said
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The council said remittances reached $8.9 billion last
year--nearly $24.4 million a day. That was an increase of 35.3% from
the figure for 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Other Mexican agencies have estimated that remittances surpassed
$9 billion last year. Calculations are difficult and vary because
many funds never pass through banks. It's also hard to distinguish
some transfers from tourism spending.</LD>
<TE>   The council did not give figures for the amount sent home so far
this year. It said about 1.2 million Mexican homes, about one in
five, now receive remittances from relatives in the United States.
The council said most of those families have "a high level of
dependence on dollars from abroad."</TE>
<TE>   The population council said Mexico's economic crisis of 1994-95
stimulated migration to the United States. Before the December 1994
plunge of the Mexican peso, fewer than 700,000 families depended on
regular remittances from abroad.</TE>
<TE>   It said remittances have been rising sharply since 1996, when they
reached $4.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The government of President Vicente Fox, elected in 2000, has been
campaigning to channel more remittances into investments and to
persuade banks and exchange houses to lower transfer fees and make
remittances easier.</TE>
<TE>   The Population Council is a government agency that uses census and
other data to study population and economic trends.</TE>

<HD>McDonald's, Intel Pay to Be in Game</HD>
<DH>Internet: The 'Sims' product placement deal with Electronic
Arts is a milestone for the video game industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taking a page out of Hollywood's product-placement script, Electronic
Arts Inc. has inked a deal with Intel Corp. and McDonald's Corp. to
incorporate their products into its upcoming computer game, "The Sims
Online."</LD>
<LD>   The multimillion-dollar deal is a milestone for the game industry,
which traditionally has paid to use other companies' logos in their
games.</LD>
<LD>   Sony Corp., for example, has paid tens of thousands of dollars to
car manufacturers such as Honda Motor Co. to use real-world race cars
in its driving games. EA has handed over millions of dollars to the
National Football League for its series of "Madden Football" games.</LD>
<TE>   This time, Intel and McDonald's will be the ones spending money
for the privilege of seeing their logos in a game.</TE>
<TE>   The turnaround demonstrates the burgeoning role of video games in
shaping mainstream entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Boosted by more powerful hardware that can render richer and more
immersing virtual environments, games have gained traction with a
wider audience. Sales grew to more than $6 billion in the United
States last year, compared with Hollywood box office receipts of $8.4
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer-product companies are starting to take notice. And EA is
poised to take advantage of the industry's newfound popularity. It
has signed an agreement with Reebok International Ltd. to place the
shoe company's logo into its popular "Madden Football" game this
year.</TE>
<TE>   But the deal announced today dwarfs the Reebok deal "by an order
of magnitude," said EA spokesman Jeff Brown. "We absolutely expect
that there will be more sponsors."</TE>
<TE>   Due out this fall, "The Sims Online," as the name implies, will be
an online version of EA's popular series "The Sims." Since its debut
in 2000, the title has sold 9 million copies and 8 million expansion
packs, separately sold add-on software.</TE>
<TE>   The game, a doll-house simulation of real life, lets players
choose occupations, buy houses, furnish them, date, marry and have
kids. Half its players are women, which is unusual because computer
games typically skew toward young males.</TE>
<TE>   This demographic mix, combined with the game's large following,
makes it an appealing vehicle for advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt we could strengthen our brand identity and increase
awareness of our products with the women and young adults who play
this game," said Alison Richards, director of co-marketing at Intel.
"This is our first product placement in an online environment. Before
this, we did very, very little in the way of product placement."</TE>
<TE>   In "The Sims Online," players can buy Intel PCs, which will help
boost their characters' logic skills and fun factor. They also can
run a McDonald's kiosk to make money.</TE>
<TE>   Product placement is nothing new for Hollywood. Steven Spielberg's
latest movie, "Minority Report," got several million dollars from
featuring the brands of 15 companies, including Toyota Motor Corp.,
American Express Co. and Gap Inc. Perhaps the most well-known product
placement is the Aston Martin car in "James Bond" movies.</TE>
<TE>   But it's new territory for games.</TE>
<TE>   "The video game industry has been experimenting with sponsorships
in recent years," Brown said. But the product placement deal "is a
breakthrough for us," he said.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SBC Communications Inc. may lose 13 million phone lines through the
end of 2003 to rivals who lease the company's network at rates it
says are unfairly low, according to Chief Financial Officer Randall
Stephenson.</LD>
<LD>   At the current rate, SBC's share of the local-phone market in the
Southwest, Midwest and California would fall to 66% from 85%,
according to a presentation the company gave the Federal
Communications Commission last week.</LD>
<LD>   Rivals taking 13 million lines from SBC, which had $45.9 billion
in revenue last year, would translate into a loss of more than $3
billion in annual sales.</LD>
<TE>   San Antonio-based SBC, the second-biggest U.S. local-phone
operator, had a second-quarter sales drop of 5.5% as the number of
phone lines fell 3.8%. The sales decline will accelerate if
regulators don't raise prices the company can charge rivals,
Stephenson said.</TE>

<HD>Intel to Make Its Own Communications Chips</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beefing up its commitment to produce chips for the telecommunications
industry, Intel Corp. will announce today that it will begin making
its own communications chips.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Clara, Calif., semiconductor giant will use a new
manufacturing process that produces the world's smallest commercial
transistors. Intel currently contracts with other companies to
manufacture its communications chips.</LD>
<LD>   Although sales of communications chips made up less than 10% of
Intel's revenue in 2001, Intel is betting that the telecom industry
eventually will lift from its malaise.</LD>
<TE>   "These are markets that Intel is turning to for future growth, so
it's very important to them," said Joseph Byrne, an analyst with
technology research firm Gartner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The move pits Intel in more direct competition with Broadcom Corp.
and Conexant Systems Inc., two Southland companies that sell chips
for cell phones and high-speed networking equipment.</TE>
<TE>   By making the chips in-house, Intel can integrate computing and
communications functions on a single piece of silicon, making them
less costly.</TE>
<TE>   Intel also will use its new manufacturing process for making
circuits that are 90 nanometers wide, one-third less than current
industry standards. Smaller circuits run faster, use less power and
take up less room, lowering overall costs. Intel expects to begin
selling these chips in the second half of 2003.</TE>

<HD>Expensing Stock Options Threatens Tech Firms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The cost of expensing stock options is taking a place alongside
slowing earnings growth, a weakening economy, the threat of terrorism
and the prospect of war in Iraq as a reason for U.S. stocks to fall.</LD>
<LD>   Counting options as an expense reduces profits and is a particular
threat to computer-related companies' results. Cisco Systems Inc. of
San Jose had $2.8 billion in option expenses that might have counted
against net income last year, according to an analysis by Lehman
Bros. Inc. Redwood City, Calif.-based Oracle Corp., which reports
results this week, had $700 million in option costs.</LD>
<LD>   Although criticism by money managers and policymakers of
companies' financial reports makes this accounting change
"inevitable," investors are only beginning to figure it into the

<HD>Chief Building a Team for AMD to Expand</HD>
<DH>Q&amp;A: Hector de Jesus Ruiz is focused on making the chip
maker a fierce Intel competitor through its partnerships with other
companies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hector de Jesus Ruiz, the new chief executive of Advanced Micro
Devices Inc., calls it the perfect storm.</LD>
<LD>   Demand for AMD's chips is woeful. Semiconductors are in
oversupply. The world economy is in a slump. And the threat of
terrorism and political instability abroad are sapping what little
confidence U.S. consumers have left.</LD>
<LD>   It's a grim situation but hardly the first to face the 56-year-old
engineer.</LD>
<TE>   As a boy from Piedras Negras, Mexico, Ruiz cleaned houses in
exchange for English lessons so he could attend high school in Eagle
Pass, Texas. He was the class valedictorian, went on to study at the
University of Texas at Austin and earned a doctorate in electrical
engineering at Rice University.</TE>
<TE>   When he met Jerry Sanders, AMD's flamboyant founder and chairman,
Ruiz was president of Motorola Inc.'s semiconductors division.
Sanders persuaded Ruiz to work for AMD and succeed him as CEO.</TE>
<TE>   Sanders and Ruiz are an odd couple. Sanders is outgoing, boastful
and charismatic. Ruiz is quietly methodical and uncomfortable talking
about himself.</TE>
<TE>   If Sanders hadn't founded AMD, he has said, he'd be an actor. Ruiz
confesses that if he weren't CEO, he'd be a football coach. A sports
fanatic, Ruiz roots for the Houston Texans, a brand-new (read:
underdog) National Football League team that won its first game last
week--against the Dallas Cowboys.</TE>
<TE>   It's a fitting analogy for AMD's position as the outgunned No. 2
chip company, behind Intel Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Question: If you can't outspend Intel, how will you compete with
them?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: It's easy. We can outsmart them.</TE>
<TE>   Q: OK. How about some examples?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think Intel is an awesome competitor. They're good, strong,
well managed. Which makes it harder for us. We have to do things
differently and with less people, less capital.</TE>
<TE>   This requires us to partner with people, build what we call
deep-rooted partnerships. For example, we work with Fujitsu in making
flash memory chips. That relationship started 10 years ago. That has
been good. But going forward, it has to be much deeper. It will
become obvious in the months ahead that this partnership will include
development of ideas and products.</TE>
<TE>   For example, to succeed in microprocessors, you need the chipsets
[the larger piece of silicon on which the central processing unit
sits]. We don't make chipsets. The thing we're changing going forward
is finding a smaller number of participants to jointly develop the
microprocessor architecture so the chips and the chipset work better
together. Every time I sell a processor, it will have been designed
with our partners. Their success will be totally centered around our
mutual work.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What about innovation? Intel has thousands of engineers
thinking about the future of processors. You have about 150 in your
process engineering lab.</TE>
<TE>   A: We think we're more focused. Our efforts are strongly focused
on microprocessors and flash memory. We have some bright people
innovating solely on those two product families. In 2001 and 2000, we
had over 1,000 patents issued through AMD, which is a significantly
larger number than our competitor considering that we're
significantly smaller. We only do a few things, but we try to do them
well.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What's your strategy for AMD, and how will it be different from
what Jerry Sanders has done?</TE>
<TE>   A: There are several levels to this. First, let's look at
personalities. Jerry's a very strong, charismatic leader. He founded
the company. It's centered around him. AMD and Jerry Sanders are
synonymous. But we are now a $3-billion company. We have to scale
that up. We'd like to be a $10-billion company. To scale, we need a
cadre of executives. My near-term goal is to ensure that AMD is
represented by a team of strong representatives, as opposed to just
one strong charismatic leader.</TE>
<TE>   Secondly, look at the partnerships we have. We've never been large
enough to do everything ourselves. We need to evolve our
partnerships, take them into a much deeper mode.</TE>
<TE>   Lastly, in terms of manufacturing technology, Jerry's been quoted
saying that real men own their own fabs [manufacturing plants]. Well,
what we now see is a different scenario. AMD will have to partner
with people who view manufacturing as their core competency. Our core
competency is core processor design. Going forward, I'm modifying the
model to avoid spending as much capital as we had in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How would you say you're different from Jerry as a manager?</TE>
<TE>   A: Those who know me know it's difficult for me to talk about
myself. I find it really awkward. I can tell you what I would hope
people who work for me see, and that is a very strong desire in me to
build a team. If I couldn't be CEO of AMD, my dream's to be the coach
of a football team and win some games.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How are your new Athlon chips or Hammer chips different from
any other AMD product?</TE>
<TE>   A: Athlon is the first product AMD has ever done that is totally
independent of Intel's technology. It's not compatible with [Intel].
This was the first time AMD had to build everything itself. The
motherboard, chipsets, software are all AMD-based. We launched Athlon
in late 1999, and it was the most successful product we had ever
built. We can easily see it three to four years from now still being
a key product.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, it's a 32-bit processor. We needed a 64-bit
processor. So we took all the learning we did on Athlon, added
features and created a 64-bit processor that we call Hammer. If you
use Hammer, it's a 64-bit machine that can run all the 32-bit
applications that Athlon runs, and you don't have to change anything.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The economics of your industry are brutal. Performance rises
even as prices drop. How is AMD going to weather the storm?</TE>
<TE>   A: We're in the most severe recession our industry has ever known.
We refer to it internally at AMD as the perfect storm. Demand is not
there. Inventories are high throughout the whole supply chain. We
also have a global recession that has affected other industries. Then
on top of that, we have the threat of terrorism, the threat of war.</TE>
<TE>   So what do you do? We have to put what we view today in the
context of where we'll be in the future. We think we will be the
leader in 64-bit architecture. So we will focus on Hammer. We intend
to be the leader in flash memory. So we'll focus on our partnership
with Fujitsu. We believe in connectivity. So we will pursue ways to
make connectivity easier.</TE>
<TE>   Connectivity is key. I'm going to make what some people will think
is a heretical statement. I think Moore's law [that the cost of
computing power falls steadily over time] is irrelevant. I don't
think it's applicable anymore. What's applicable is Metcalf's law
[which says the utility of a device increases exponentially with the
number of other devices connected to it].</TE>
<TE>   If you own a fax machine, but you're the only one who does, it's
of very little use. If there are two, then it becomes useful. If you
have three, then it's even more useful. We're looking at an
incredibly connected world. We at AMD are in the sweet spot of that
in providing the flash memory and the microprocessors that enable all
that. How do we make sure we get there? We're putting a lot of
efforts into managing our balance sheets and not getting distracted.</TE>
<TE>   Q: When do you think the chip industry will start to see a
recovery?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's an incredibly challenging time. If you stand at the door
of an electronics retailer and watch people come in, you see they
have a certain amount of money to spend. They've got a tough decision
to make because what's available in stores is huge. It's
mind-boggling. You can upgrade your TV, get a new DVD player, a new
MP3 player. Choices are huge, and the available dollars are flat
because people are concerned about the future.</TE>
<TE>   For a recovery to happen, employment has to go up, people have to
feel more confident about the future. We're all hopeful it'll happen
next year, but things have to settle down. Corporate governance
issues need to go away, and the threat of terrorism has to settle
down before people get that sense of optimism that will allow them to
feel good about opening up their wallets again.</TE>

<HD>TRW to Launch Hiring Effort</HD>
<DH>Firm plans to hire more than 1,000 engineers during the
next year to meet the need at its Redondo Beach space and electronics
unit</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a boost to Southern California's economy and its long-suffering
aerospace industry, TRW Inc. plans to hire more than 1,000 engineers
over the next year as a result of winning four major satellite
contracts.</LD>
<LD>   TRW's Space and Electronics unit in Redondo Beach over the last
nine months has scooped up government contracts potentially worth
more than $14 billion. The achievement vindicates TRW's strategy of
focusing on advanced research, and it will help reverse the region's
long slide in aerospace hiring.</LD>
<LD>   "We are going to go into an aggressive hiring mode," said Timothy
W. Hannemann, chief executive of TRW's Space and Electronics unit in
Redondo Beach.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to the engineering jobs, hundreds of others are likely
to be hired in support roles.</TE>
<TE>   And Hannemann said even more jobs could be created as the programs
begin in earnest over the next year or two.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel pretty good about the future of this place and for the
industry in Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   TRW's resurgence is leading a turnaround for the region's defense
industry after nearly two decades of retrenchment, economists said.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time since 1988, economists are predicting sustained
growth in aerospace jobs in the region.</TE>
<TE>   "People think aerospace has gone away, but if you look at Southern
California in the last few months, there has been an impressive
string of contract wins," said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the
Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. "The decline in
aerospace since 1988 has been pretty relentless, but we're now
looking at an uptick that should last for a while."</TE>
<TE>   The TRW contract wins were among the latest in a batch of major
awards given to Southern California aerospace firms this year.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Boeing Co. won a $9.6-billion Pentagon contract to
build 60 more C-17 military transport jets at its Long Beach plant.
Boeing's Seal Beach operations also garnered two defense contracts,
one to design next-generation weapons for the Army, worth about $6
billion, and another to field a new radio system for about $4
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, Century City-based Northrop Grumman Corp. is hiring
1,500 people to work on the Joint Strike Fighter in El Segundo and
Palmdale.</TE>
<TE>   The growth in jobs is not likely to come anywhere close to the
industry's heyday in the 1940s and 1950s, but the quality of the new
jobs is expected to add significantly to the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, most of those jobs were in manufacturing, but the
new jobs are largely for high-wage engineers.</TE>
<TE>   The spacecraft contracts, which overnight doubled TRW's backlog
from $4 billion to $8 billion, will require the immediate creation of
hundreds of high-paying engineering jobs.</TE>
<TE>   About 8,000 people work in Redondo Beach, with an additional 1,000
scattered in other offices throughout the Southland.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, TRW won a high-profile $825-million contract from NASA
to build the next-generation space observatory to replace the Hubble
Space Telescope.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks ago, TRW won its largest satellite production contract
when it was selected to build weather-monitoring satellites for both
military and civil use, potentially worth $6.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In April, TRW was tapped to oversee a $6-billion satellite system
to track enemy missiles, and earlier in the year it won a
$1.3-billion contract to build instruments for a communications
satellite system.</TE>
<TE>   And there probably are other contracts that TRW has won but can't
disclose because they involve classified Defense Department work,
according to aerospace experts. Company officials declined to discuss
this possibility.</TE>
<TE>   "TRW is winning more contracts than we know about," said William
H. Alderman, an aerospace mergers and acquisitions specialist. "With
the Bush administration's current focus on bolstering military space
programs, and Congress willing to fund those programs, TRW is in a
very good position to win them. What they do fits really well with
what the administration wants."</TE>
<TE>   That's good news for hundreds of engineers who have been laid off
from Boeing's commercial satellite operations in El Segundo in recent
months. The division has been hit hard by the slump in the
telecommunications industry.</TE>
<TE>   TRW's hot streak appears to justify Northrop's logic for acquiring
TRW. Northrop agreed to pay $7.8 billion for Cleveland-based TRW
after a six-month battle that required Northrop to raise its bid
three times.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop has been eyeing TRW's space business in Redondo Beach for
nearly a decade. TRW also has a major automotive parts business and
an aircraft parts operation, both of which Northrop wants to sell.</TE>
<TE>   TRW's space business will be one of Northrop's crown jewels, said
Jon B. Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners Inc., a
Century City-based aerospace investment bank.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop officials have declined to talk about the integration
plans pending government approvals, but analysts anticipate that the
company will not impose much change at TRW since there is little
redundancy in operations.</TE>
<TE>   But some TRW executives have said privately that they are looking
forward to working for Northrop after years of frustration in the
shadows of a company that had increasingly focused on
less-than-stellar ventures into automotive and aircraft parts
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there was a lot of frustration with being a premiere
space company sitting under an automobile parts maker," an executive
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some TRW employees acknowledged feeling uncertain, with Northrop's
acquisition, about whether TRW could maintain its culture focused
around taking on the nation's most challenging engineering tasks. The
culture allowed engineers to feel secure in their jobs, they said.</TE>
<TE>   TRW has been at the forefront of military weapons and space
development, including having designed and launched more than 200
satellites since its predecessor was founded by two Caltech graduates
in a Los Angeles barbershop in 1953. It developed the nation's
ballistic missile system and is a significant contractor for the
missile-defense program.</TE>
<TE>   The anxiety level appears to have diminished considerably in
recent months with the successes in winning the major contracts. An
executive at a rival aerospace company said he no longer gets resumes
from TRW employees after a steady stream of them started to come in
shortly after Northrop announced its acquisition of TRW earlier this
year.</TE>
<TE>   "It just stopped overnight," he said.</TE>
<TE>   TRW officials attributed the contract wins partly to sticking with
the strategy of retaining its core engineering work force despite
intense pressure to make cost-cutting moves.</TE>
<TE>   Although TRW slashed its payroll, mainly cutting administrative
and support staffs, its engineering staff, which had worked on some
of the nation's more pioneering military programs, was mostly
retained.</TE>
<TE>   TRW's research culture is embodied in its sprawling complex in
Redondo Beach, which is modeled like a college campus with grass
courtyards and bricked walkways.</TE>
<TE>   Some 30 low-rise buildings make up the "space park," giving
virtually every engineer an office with a window and a view, an idea
pushed by the company's founders. They believed that the academic
atmosphere would draw the nation's best talent, foster creative
thinking and help TRW maintain a technological edge over its
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   Despite coming under heavy criticism in the 1990s as a prolonged
slump in defense spending led companies to shutter facilities and
slash jobs, TRW stuck to its founding vision, a move that now appears
to be paying off.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the objectives I had, as we went through this time of
contraction, was to maintain our focus on investment in research and
development, and I always thought that one of the strategic
advantages would be to find a way to keep the best people," said
Hannemann, who has been chief executive of the space unit since 1993.
"I'm glad to say we've accomplished both objectives: We were able to
keep and nurture the best and the brightest, and I think that's made
a big difference in our success."</TE>

<HD>Arabs Fear Regional Jolt of Iraq War</HD>
<DH>Security: Leaders are afraid that the Mideast, already
racked by crisis, would be further destabilized if the U.S. invaded,
officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia</DL>
<LD>Arab leaders are unanimously opposed to an American invasion of Iraq
because they are afraid it will lead to greater instability and
violence across an already crisis-plagued region, according to
Western diplomats, Arab officials and political observers.</LD>
<LD>   The Arab community has tried to persuade Washington to cool down
its war talk, insisting that an attack against Iraq would be an
attack on the whole "Arab nation." And it has leaned on Baghdad to
let U.N. weapons inspectors back in, hoping that the move would make
an invasion less likely.</LD>
<LD>   But both approaches have so far proved unsuccessful--and that is
making many people here uneasy.</LD>
<TE>   "They are very, very concerned about the fallout from American
military action," said a Western diplomat based here who spoke on
condition he not be identified. "They see it happening against the
backdrop of unparalleled anti-American sentiment that has already put
pressure on moderate regimes. They are very worried."</TE>
<TE>   But a regional calculus is also taking place, as leaders try to
figure out how to balance their need to maintain public order with
their desire not to completely alienate the White House. Although the
leaderships' public posture remains one of solidarity with the people
of Iraq, there are signs that some are trying to hedge their bets.</TE>
<TE>   In the Persian Gulf region, for example, every government has
publicly objected to an invasion, but several have allowed U.S.
military forces to make war preparations on their soil. And on
Sunday, the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al Faisal, told CNN
that if the United Nations authorized a strike on Iraq, the Saudis
would be "obliged to follow through" if the United States needed
bases in the kingdom.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Western diplomat here, the Saudis "recognize
[Washington is] probably going to do it this way.... When it comes
down to it, they don't want to be left on the sidelines looking
irrelevant."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the region is already in turmoil. Many people are angry at
the United States because they believe that it used the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks as an excuse to advance its self-interest. They are
angry because of what they see as America's one-sided support for
Israel. An attack on Iraq now, many fear, would make everything
worse. The country could break apart. The Arab "street" might rise
up. A cornered Saddam Hussein could hurl chemical or biological
weapons into neighboring nations.</TE>
<TE>   Each country in the region also has its individual concerns. Saudi
Arabia fears that an attack on Iraq would complicate its desire to
maintain ties with Washington and would undermine the war against
terrorism. Jordan worries that it would be overrun by refugees and
lose its supply of cheap oil. Egypt is worried that its people would
take to the streets in demonstrations that could turn against the
regime. And Iran, largely Muslim although not Arab, is not too keen
on having a pro-American regime on its border.</TE>
<TE>   There is one anxiety, however, that touches moderate and hard-line
governments alike: the fear that post-Hussein Iraq would be even more
dangerous, more volatile than it is now. The anxiety is magnified
because in Hussein's Iraq there are no independent government
institutions to speak of and no obvious opposition group waiting in
the wings to assume power.</TE>
<TE>   "Who will run things?" said a top government official from the
region who asked not to be identified. "The military? There will be a
coup every week. All these people of the opposition will not stand
one day in Iraq. They have no credibility in Iraq. They have no
political or tribal depth in Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   The worry that Iraq will unravel is a result of both the country's
religious and ethnic makeup. Hussein and his allies belong to the
main branch of Islam, the Sunni sect. Although Sunnis make up the
vast majority of the world's Muslims, they are a minority in Iraq.
The bulk of the population is Shiite Muslims, a sect that broke off
from the majority in a dispute over who would succeed the prophet
Muhammad as caliph.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, southern Iraq is the location of two of the Shiites'
holiest shrines.</TE>
<TE>   That has people in Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, anxious.
Neighboring Iran, the only country in the region controlled by
Shiites, has a track record of trying to export its revolution and
its fiery brand of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative Islamic regimes in the Persian Gulf have looked to
Hussein's ironfisted government, if nothing else, as a bulwark
against Shiite aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   If Hussein's regime collapses and the U.S. fails to fill the power
vacuum quickly, there is concern that Iran might try to encourage
Iraq's Shiite-dominated south either to break off as an independent
country or to merge with Iran. Saudi Arabia, the most conservative of
Islamic countries, is not eager to have a Shiite neighbor on its
border.</TE>
<TE>   "This is no doubt a big concern," said Saleh ibn Humaid, chairman
of the Shura Council, an appointed advisory board in the kingdom. "It
is a worry for the whole world."</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's religious makeup, however, is only one aspect of the
nation's fragile composition. The northern section of the country
also is not Sunni. But it is not Arab either. It is a stronghold for
Kurds. Since the end of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the Kurds have in
effect had autonomy in the region, with U.S. and British warplanes
enforcing a "no-fly" zone overhead and the United Nations
administering funds brought in under Iraq's U.N.-authorized
"oil-for-food" program.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Kurds have insisted that they are not interested in
declaring independence, there is considerable concern about them
among nations in the region already contending with separatist
Kurdish populations of their own. Those countries are as diverse as
Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and
Syria, which the United States considers a state sponsor of
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, these regional anxieties are magnified by the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The Arab leadership is unanimous in its conviction that the
conflict is the region's foremost problem and should be tackled
before any other. Western diplomats based here, and Western
expatriates who work here, confirm that. But it is a reality that
Washington appears to have ignored, many here say.</TE>
<TE>   "Out here, people think Americans willfully or otherwise ignore
their single most important grievance," said a Western ambassador
based in the region. "And in Washington, they like to tune that
grievance out a bit ... which really de-legitimizes what is a
legitimate point of view."</TE>
<TE>   For this reason, although Arab leaders say they would not shed a
tear if Hussein's regime fell, they say the United States has picked
the worst possible time to force the issue.</TE>
<TE>   In Saudi Arabia, that feeling is magnified by the perception that
Americans have blamed the entire country for the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Arab leaders are concerned about maintaining public calm. Taken
together, poor economic conditions, high unemployment and a young
population pose a potential crisis to regimes either so old that they
are considered by many of their own subjects to be out of touch, or
so young that they have not been able to solidify power.</TE>
<TE>   "I have seen the street in action a lot. The governments here in
this area are capable of controlling it before it gets out of hand,"
the Western ambassador said.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the price of controlling that is they will do and say
things [the U.S.] will not like."</TE>
<TE>   There are signs that the crackdown has already begun. In Egypt,
for example, a military court last week sentenced 51 Islamists to
lengthy prison terms, and other suspected Islamists have been
arrested--moves that at least one security analyst called
preparations for an American invasion.</TE>

<LD>   The prison, which had housed 170,000 men over its 46 years, went
out of control during Brazil's biggest prison uprising last year.
Using cell phones, a gang organized a rebellion that engulfed 29
prisons and led to a 27-hour siege with 7,000 hostages taken. In a
1992 uprising, police stormed the prison and killed 111 inmates.</LD>

<HD>Europe's Food Regions Fight to Keep Their Good Names</HD>
<DH>Trade: From Parma, Italy, to Roquefort, France, specialty
manufacturers are in a cultural and economic fight with the U.S. over
product identity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARMA, Italy</DL>
<LD>For Andrea Bonati, producing Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese is more than
a profession.</LD>
<LD>   "When I was a kid, I used to steal it from where my mother kept
it," he says of the cheese better known around the world as Parmesan.
"It's an addiction. It starts running in your blood. It's something
that deeply affects the feelings of the people who make it. Once you
start, you can't stop."</LD>
<LD>   But there are two kinds of "Parmesan" in this world.</LD>
<TE>   One is Bonati's beloved Parmigiano-Reggiano, a hard, dry, fragrant
cheese made to exacting specifications by a consortium of Parma-area
producers that he heads. To the makers and most Italians, this is the
only real Parmesan, served grated or in elegant slivers.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in their disparaging view, there's that cheap generic stuff
made from other cheeses that comes in cardboard containers and is
sprinkled like so much salt on spaghetti.</TE>
<TE>   Now Bonati, his consortium and European officials have placed the
word "Parmesan" squarely at the center of an escalating slugfest
between European and U.S. manufacturers over the traditional names of
specialty foods.</TE>
<TE>   The European position is that the right to make a product called
"Parmesan" should belong exclusively to the Parma consortium and that
producers of other local foods should have similar rights.</TE>
<TE>   Paolo Galloni makes Parma ham, a dry-cured raw ham, less salty
than most prosciutto, that is famed for its delicate flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Like many producers of regional specialties, Galloni argues that
specific natural conditions at the food's place of origin are an
essential ingredient to its quality. "The speed of the breeze flowing
from the hill is perfect for slow and sweet curing of the ham," he
said, pointing to the open windows of the curing room.</TE>
<TE>   The food fight is both cultural and economic.</TE>
<TE>   For the Europeans, this is a battle to defend traditional culture
against an onslaught of soulless industrialization and globalization.</TE>
<TE>   Without the economic advantage that comes from exclusive rights to
the regional food's name, advocates of these protections argue, small
local producers lose their ability to compete, and as they disappear
they carry old traditions with them into oblivion.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. manufacturers, however, see all this as an ill-disguised
effort to overturn trademarks, wipe out rights to produce various
kinds of generic foods, and boost the profits of European producers
at the expense of foreign competitors.</TE>
<TE>   A recent legal victory by Bonati's group means that U.S. and other
producers who don't belong to the 650-member Parma consortium can no
longer sell "Parmesan" cheese in the European Union, although they
are still free to sell their shake-onto-the-pasta product under
another name.</TE>
<TE>   A Growing List</TE>
<TE>   The European Union enforces rights to the names of about 600
regional foods, ranging from famous products such as Italy's Parma
ham and France's Roquefort cheese to such lesser-known items as 10
distinct varieties of Greek table olives.</TE>
<TE>   The list is constantly growing. This month, for example, the Roman
artichoke, or "carciofi romaneschi," was added. "Now people will be
sure that when they ask for a Roman artichoke, that's what they will
get," said a satisfied Antonio De Amicis, director of the Coldiretti
Farmers' Union.</TE>
<TE>   EU negotiators are now trying to extend such protections globally
through the World Trade Organization, and possibly expand them into
other areas.</TE>
<TE>   If they were to completely succeed, no U.S. manufacturer would be
able to use the names of the 600 products, including the cheeses
Parmesan, Grana Padano, Roquefort, provolone, Romano, Asiago,
Gorgonzola, Fontina or dozens of lesser-known names. Nor could they
call their products Parma ham or balsamic vinegar.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to know what you're eating, you have to know the
place of production. It's part of the richness of Italian culture,"
said Mirella Galloni, one of the second-generation owners of a
family-run firm producing Parma ham in the hilly countryside near the
city.</TE>
<TE>   Her cousin Paolo said that for producers elsewhere to market
"Parma ham" constitutes an attack on both the identity and the
livelihood of people from the region.</TE>
<TE>   "Food is part of the cultural identity of a people," he said. "If
you're in a global world, your personal identity has to be defended."</TE>
<TE>   Galloni factory literature explains to consumers that the way to
savor the ham is to "concentrate, sniff a slice ... and then allow it
to melt in your mouth. Enjoy the taste achieved through artisan
skills. Wait 20 seconds and discover that no aftertaste remains."</TE>
<TE>   One should also appreciate the ham's "intense, rosy color,
brilliant and fast even after slicing," it adds. "Thus we visually
recognize a gourmet masterpiece."</TE>
<TE>   Because the ham is lightly salted, the salt must be spread by hand
in precisely the correct manner, Paolo Galloni said. Then the ham
must be cured at exactly the right temperature. If it is too cold, it
won't absorb enough salt, while if too warm, it may spoil.</TE>
<TE>   Federico Desimoni, legal advisor to the consortium of Parma ham
producers, said that the reputation of regional specialties is
destroyed if other products are sold under the same name.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't just lose market share," Desimoni said. "We lose a
culture, because the typical product is not just a quality product.
It's a product coming from a region, from a culture, from a human
experience."</TE>
<TE>   It is the southern part of Europe that cares most about all this,
Desimoni added. "For sure, if you lose this kind of product, you will
lose a little part of Italian, Spanish, French, Greek culture," he
said. "If you produce the same ham, maybe not so special, but quite
similar, throughout Europe, you lose. You've made out of a lot of
cultures one multiculture."</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Posteraro, a soccer coach who lives in Rome, credits
Parmigiano-Reggiano with boosting his team's performance.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple of hours before we start the game, I give a piece of
Parmigiano to my players," he said. "It's rich in calcium and
vitamins, and the taste is wonderful. We tried to substitute it with
another type of cheese, but it wasn't the same."</TE>
<TE>   Posteraro said he believes that it's important to protect regional
foods because "if we standardize everything, we will lose the
flavors. Behind these flavors is our culture."</TE>
<TE>   Many Italians worried about the rights of specialty food producers
were particularly pleased by the Parma cheese makers' victory on the
word "Parmesan."</TE>
<TE>   "This is an essential step which will help the EU demand quality
standards to be safeguarded ... ridding the world of all the
counterfeit Italian products littering the planet," declared Italy's
farming federation, Confagricoltura.</TE>
<TE>   But now that the Parma producers have the exclusive rights in
Europe to the Parmesan name, they aren't even sure they want to use
it. Bonati said the consortium hasn't decided whether its members
should boost their use of the word in selling Parmigiano-Reggiano in
foreign markets or instead seek to wipe it out.</TE>
<TE>   Personally, he said, he thinks that it would be best to avoid
using the word, because linking "Parmesan" even more closely in
consumers' minds with "Parmigiano-Reggiano" would simply lower the
image of the real product.</TE>
<TE>   Global Protections</TE>
<TE>   On the same day in June that the court issued its Parmesan
decision, EU officials and representatives of more than a dozen other
countries proposed major new global protections for localities'
rights to regional food names. India, Nigeria, Thailand and Bulgaria
were among the co-sponsors of the proposal at the WTO trade-related
aspects of intellectual property rights, or TRIPS, council in Geneva.</TE>
<TE>   The TRIPS agreement already provides legal protections for certain
wines and spirits, and the proposal would extend those rights to a
broad range of traditional food products.</TE>
<TE>   Although manufacturers anywhere would still be allowed to do their
best to imitate a region's specialty food, they generally would not
be allowed to market it using the traditional name.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal raises the possibility of extending such protections
in the future to textiles and other products, meaning that certain
types of Indian saris or Turkish carpets, for example, could
eventually be listed.</TE>
<TE>   A European victory at TRIPS would not by itself overturn any
trademarks or rights to use names that are considered generic.</TE>
<TE>   But in broader WTO negotiations on agricultural trade, the
European Union is pushing for even greater global protections for the
names of regional specialty foods.</TE>
<TE>   In these negotiations, the EU proposal would allow localities that
first created a product to recover exclusive rights to its name even
if it has been registered as a trademark outside Europe or is
considered generic. A company in Canada that has registered "Parma
ham" as a trademark, for example, would have to give it up, or a U.S.
firm making generic "Parmesan" cheese would have to call it something
else.</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of 15 U.S. companies and food trade associations
responded to these developments by releasing a blistering letter to
U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick criticizing EU actions
and urging him to fight the proposals.</TE>
<TE>   EU efforts "have the potential to undermine current trademark
protection as well as the marketing of food products in the EU and
other countries," the letter said. "If successful, the EU could
create significant new barriers for U.S. exports, particularly for
food products, and especially for meat, cheeses and beverages....
Recent EU pronouncements hint at their true agenda--to challenge
existing protections for trademarks and generic products."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed new WTO rules would create a particular burden for
countries such as the United States with a multicultural heritage,
where immigrants brought with them traditional methods of food
production that now enjoy trademark protection, the letter said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Desimoni, the Parma ham lawyer, argues that the U.S. position
is little more than a defense of thievery.</TE>
<TE>   "You can say, 'But why can't we reproduce the same product in
another part of the world?' " he said. "First, I would feel, you are
stealing the idea. It's not your idea."</TE>
<TE>   One should also note, he added, that it is generally small, rural
producers who benefit from stronger protection.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the only way for these areas not to go to sure death is
to have a business," he said. "And if you lose these areas, if you
lose the villages, then you also lose the culture."</TE>

<HD>In Kashmir, Casting Ballots Can Be a Risky Endeavor</HD>
<DH>Election: India is mobilizing local police and federal
troops to guard polling stations, but threats of increased militant
attacks persist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SRINAGAR, India</DL>
<LD>Torn between threats of increased militant attacks and promises of
government reform, voters here in the rugged Himalayan territory of
Kashmir must decide beginning today whether to risk casting ballots
in crucial state elections.</LD>
<LD>   With tensions over the disputed region still high between
nuclear-armed neighbors India and Pakistan, the vote is one of
Kashmir's most important--and could end up one of its bloodiest.</LD>
<LD>   The voting will be staggered over a month to allow Indian
authorities to move half a million local police and federal soldiers
to guard the polling places in Jammu and Kashmir state, which
includes the Indian-held portion of Kashmir.</LD>
<TE>   But on Sunday, separatist guerrillas who have demanded a vote
boycott carried out the latest in a rash of assassination attempts,
sending a clear signal that they won't be deterred by the massive
security operation.</TE>
<TE>   State Tourism Minister Sakina Itoo narrowly escaped an ambush that
left two of her bodyguards dead. When a vehicle in her motorcade
struck a land mine, the guerrillas opened fire, but Itoo was not
injured in the fusillade.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, militants killed the Indian state's law minister,
Mushtaq Ahmad Lone. Earlier, in May, the guerrillas killed Abdul
Ghani Lone, a popular and moderate separatist leader.</TE>
<TE>   At least 110 people have been killed in Kashmir since the election
campaign began in August. Of the dead, 62 were members of the
security forces, 26 were civilians, and 22 were political activists,
according to police.</TE>
<TE>   Indian security forces say they killed more than 395 militants in
Jammu and Kashmir between June and August.</TE>
<TE>   New Delhi says that the current election violence is being
encouraged by Pakistan, which has called the polling a farce and
maintains that India is obliged under United Nations resolutions to
allow Kashmiris to vote for union with Pakistan, continued
affiliation with India or outright independence.</TE>
<TE>   "Misusing the rationale of the war against terrorism, India has
sought to de-legitimize the Kashmir freedom struggle, tarnish
Pakistan with the brush of terrorism and drive a wedge between it and
its coalition partners," Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf told
the U.N. General Assembly in New York on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said Sunday that
Musharraf's rhetoric has "crossed all limits."</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf insists that he is keeping his promise to the U.S. to
stop guerrillas infiltrating the roughly one-third of Kashmir under
Indian control. But India's intelligence agencies say that the
militants' incursions continue with the aid of the Pakistani
military, which is under Musharraf's command.</TE>
<TE>   Citing radio intercepts, a senior Indian intelligence official
said in an interview Saturday in New Delhi that militant commanders
based in the Pakistani-controlled portion of Kashmir have issued
orders to their followers to disrupt the state elections in
Indian-held areas.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's military intelligence organization, the Inter-Services
Intelligence agency, "does not directly get involved in specifying
the operations," according to the Indian source. "However, they do
give general directions."</TE>
<TE>   In radio conversations July 28 and 30, militant commanders in
Pakistani Kashmir told fighters in Indian-held Kashmir to make sure
that the voter turnout is less than half that of the last poll, in
1996, according to the Indian intelligence official. He spoke on
condition of anonymity because of the clandestine nature of his work.</TE>
<TE>   One commander suggested working through Muslim leaders, scholars
and local businesspeople to build support for a boycott, according to
the Indian official.</TE>
<TE>   "Even motivate them by saying there is not a single household that
is not affected. Make everyone understand your point and the only
solution that is available," a transcript of the alleged radio
message says. "You need to stop them [voting] by any means.</TE>
<TE>   "Speak to all the concerned people, and in case they do not agree
to your counseling or advice, then deal with them accordingly," the
transcript goes on. "Prescribe the treatment according to the
ailment. One or two days prior to the election, pressure should be
maintained to scare them."</TE>
<TE>   Only 53.4% of eligible voters cast ballots in 1996, down sharply
from the 74.8% turnout in a 1987 vote. The pro-India National
Conference party's victory in 1987 was widely rejected as rigged, and
an all-out guerrilla insurgency began.</TE>
<TE>   In an Aug. 6 radio communication, another militant commander
wanted to know why he hadn't yet received the names and addresses of
candidates in the elections, according to the Indian intelligence
official.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not confirm from you the details," a transcript of that
purported conversation says. "Have you understood? About all those
persons who are candidates for the election in 'held Kashmir,' I want
to have their addresses."</TE>
<TE>   It's impossible to independently verify the authenticity of the
alleged radio intercepts, and they could easily be more rounds fired
in the propaganda war being waged by both India and Pakistan. But the
large number of candidates and party activists targeted in recent
weeks is consistent with a well-organized campaign of intimidation by
different groups to ensure that whoever wins will be unable to claim
a mandate to negotiate the state's future with the Indian government.</TE>
<TE>   For weeks, U.S. and other Western diplomats have been pressuring
politicians on both sides of the cease-fire line dividing Kashmir, in
an effort to prevent a boycott by the loose, and fractious, coalition
of separatist groups called the All Party Hurriyat Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Indian and Pakistani forces are still dangerously close to war,
Musharraf warned the U.N. He added: "Peace in South Asia is hostage
to one accident, one act of terrorism, one strategic miscalculation
by India."</TE>
<TE>   Jammu and Kashmir's pro-India leader, Farooq Abdullah, is hoping
that his son, Omar, will lead the ruling National Conference to
reelection and maintain a political dynasty in the state.</TE>
<TE>   If the younger Abdullah, India's former junior foreign minister,
takes control of Indian Kashmir, he has promised to press for more
autonomy, but his definition falls far short of what the separatists
want.</TE>
<TE>   Hurriyat leaders say the Kashmir dispute cannot be resolved by
voting for a new state assembly--instead of an election testing the
territory's U.N.-affirmed right to self-determination--and they have
reason to be skeptical of Vajpayee's assurances that they can trust
this election.</TE>
<TE>   Even Vajpayee has admitted that previous state polls were neither
free nor fair, and the widespread voting irregularities in 1987
helped incite Jammu and Kashmir's 15-year insurgency.</TE>
<TE>   Yousuf Shah was one of the assembly candidates in 1987, and by
most accounts he was winning on election night when an official began
physically beating him and an aide, Yasin Malik.</TE>
<TE>   The official results said that Shah lost, along with the rest of
the opposition, and they handed victory to Abdullah's National
Conference, which ruled Jammu and Kashmir with one of the most
corrupt governments in India.</TE>
<TE>   Shah changed his name to Syed Salahuddin, fled to Pakistani-held
Kashmir and became supreme commander of the Hezb-ul-Moujahedeen, the
largest guerrilla army operating in Jammu and Kashmir. He also heads
the United Jihad Council, a loose alliance of militant groups
fighting Indian rule.</TE>
<TE>   India's government wants to put Salahuddin on trial as a
terrorist. It has already imprisoned his former campaign aide, Malik,
who also took up the gun after the 1987 elections and became leader
of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front.</TE>
<TE>   Although Malik transformed that group into a nonviolent movement
for Kashmiri independence, Indian police arrested him March 25 while
he was addressing a news conference in Srinagar, the state's winter
capital. He is being held, without trial, under the draconian
Prevention of Terrorism Act.</TE>

<HD>Book Details the Unenviable Life of Mrs. Vladimir V. Putin</HD>
<DH>People: The Russian president has lied to his wife, missed
the birth of their first child, is constantly late and criticizes her
cooking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>On their dates, he left her waiting, nearly in tears, for as long as
90 minutes at grungy subway stations.</LD>
<LD>   His marriage proposal was so blunt and riddled with warnings about
his "difficult character" that she thought he was preparing to dump
her.</LD>
<LD>   When she was about to give birth to their first child, he was away
on a business trip, so she hailed a taxi and went to the hospital,
where she delivered their daughter alone.</LD>
<TE>   The woman whose unsentimental journey through adulthood is
chronicled in a newly released biography is not your run-of-the-mill
Russian subjected to male chauvinism. She's the wife of President
Vladimir V. Putin.</TE>
<TE>   While Putin is lionized by the state-controlled media and hailed
as a role model of strength, responsibility and clean living, the
second volume in a planned trilogy about the Russian leader paints a
picture of a profoundly insensitive husband.</TE>
<TE>   Lyudmila Putina's candid observations about the man she met in
1980 are couched in the uncomplaining parlance of women of her
generation who have come to expect little from their men--and often
get even less.</TE>
<TE>   Putin, then a KGB spy, lied to her about his occupation, telling
her he was a police investigator for the first 18 months they dated,
Putina recalls in extensive interviews with writer Oleg Blotsky in
"Vladimir Putin: The Road to Power."</TE>
<TE>   The book released this month at the 15th Moscow International Book
Fair covers Putin's life from 1975, when he joined the KGB, to his
ascent to the presidency Dec. 31, 1999. Blotsky told journalists that
he will wait at least another year before issuing the last part of
the trilogy, which will look at Putin's accomplishments as Kremlin
chief.</TE>
<TE>   Blotsky has repeatedly denied that his biographies have the active
support of the Kremlin, although he has had dozens of interviews with
the president and family members. Neither have the Putins asked to
review the manuscripts, Blotsky said.</TE>
<TE>   "Lyudmila said that she understood that I am the author and
promised not to interfere. But she asked me not to lay too much
emphasis on the children," the author said, referring to the Putins'
two daughters, Masha, 17, and Katya, 15.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the first volume, which was widely panned as a saccharine
tribute reminiscent of the personality cults built around leaders of
the Soviet era, the new book relies on the monologues of the
44-year-old Putina to cast the president as a hard-working and
reliable man but one who is emotionally cold.</TE>
<TE>   The former Aeroflot flight attendant who has kept a very low
profile since her husband took office relates how she would lovingly
prepare meals for him and wait in vain for the slightest word of
praise. Finally succumbing to ask what he thought of her creations,
Putina tells of the churlish response: "It's a bit dry," he would say
of meat overcooked because he was always late.</TE>
<TE>   His habitual tardiness while they were dating obviously hurt more
than she let on.</TE>
<TE>   "The first 15 minutes would pass normally, and even a half-hour
would be OK. But after an hour, I would nearly cry out of
humiliation," Putin's wife recalls of the hours spent at appointed
meeting places in subway stations in what was then called Leningrad.
"His excuse was always that he had been held up at work, for which,
by the way, he was always very punctual. But in his personal life he
was sloppy."</TE>
<TE>   He also apparently used KGB tactics to be sure he could trust her.</TE>
<TE>   "Vladimir Vladimirovich has been testing me throughout our life
together," says Russia's first lady, who relates how she has always
wondered if her then-boyfriend was testing her with an ardent suitor
who came out of nowhere to plead for her phone number and a date.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always had the feeling that he's watching me," Putina
observes. "It was like he was waiting to see if I would make the
right decisions, whether I would pass the next test."</TE>
<TE>   Their courtship was subdued. "It wasn't instantaneous passion or
love at first sight," Putina says of the three years before they
married. "For the first time in my life, I fell in love gradually."</TE>
<TE>   Her in-laws hardly come off as more sensitive than their son. She
makes clear in her account of their early years together that Putin's
mother didn't care for her much. At their first meeting, Putina
introduced herself and was told by her future mother-in-law: "He's
already had a girlfriend named Lyuda, and she was quite a nice one."</TE>
<TE>   When Putina was pregnant with their first child, she lived with
her in-laws while her husband was at a training course, but then
moved out to a dormitory. When she went into labor, she took a taxi
to the hospital. Putin returned home more than 24 hours after the
delivery, weighing in to announce that their daughter's name would be
Masha, after his mother.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in tears. I wanted her to be Natasha," Putina recalls. "But
then I realized there was no choice in the matter and my daughter was
going to be Masha."</TE>
<TE>   But her tone is never complaining. The first volume of the
biography was so fawning that some observers speculate that the
current release may have been orchestrated to provide better balance.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Arbatova, a writer and commentator on women's issues,
acknowledges that she has yet to read the book still awaiting public
circulation but contended from what she's heard of it that Blotsky
"was trying to create a sensation."</TE>
<TE>   Putin is widely popular among Russian women and "considered a
typical European man," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Television talk-show moderator Yelena Khanga also said the
author's characterization contrasts with the prevailing public image.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of women see him as the perfect man. He doesn't smoke. He
doesn't drink. He's in good physical condition," Khanga said of
Putin. "Russian women love him because they want someone reliable and
strong. We're sick and tired of guys who have to be taken care of as
if they were another baby in the family."</TE>
<TE>   Another prominent feminist, however, sees the carefully sculpted
image of Putin as propagandistic and sexist.</TE>
<TE>   "The only Russian leader who put women on an equal basis with men
was [Soviet President Mikhail S.] Gorbachev," said Olga Voronina,
head of the Moscow Center for Gender Studies. "The rest of them
divide the world into spheres of men's matters and women's matters,
and they think real men shouldn't get involved in the latter."</TE>
<TE>   Russians have become accustomed to women bearing the brunt of the
domestic load, some social analysts contend, and fail to see anything
wrong with that tradition.</TE>
<TE>   Especially among men from military or security backgrounds,
Voronina said, there persists an attitude that being sensitive is
weak and unmanly.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not very considerate behavior," she said, "but it is the
norm here."</TE>

<HD>Ruling Coalition in Macedonia Is Defeated</HD>
<DH>Balkans: Crowds celebrate the victories of moderate parties
that focused on fighting corruption in races for parliamentary seats.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SKOPJE, Macedonia</DL>
<LD>With honking car horns, celebratory gunfire and surging crowds,
exuberant Macedonians heralded the outcome early today of
parliamentary elections in which the ruling coalition was defeated
overwhelmingly by more moderate parties.</LD>
<LD>   The largely peaceful election was itself a victory for this small
southeastern European country just a year after violent fighting that
pitted ethnic Albanian rebels battling for more rights against ethnic
Macedonians who feared that the rebels' real intent was to divide the
country.</LD>
<LD>   Preliminary voting results indicated that the majority of
Macedonia's 2.2 million people were tired of the politicians who had
led them into last year's armed conflict, who were tainted by
corruption charges and who had resorted to nationalist rhetoric
whenever they wanted to rally support.</LD>
<TE>   One of the winners was a new party formed by Ali Ahmeti, the
former leader of the ethnic Albanian guerrillas involved in last
year's fighting.</TE>
<TE>   "People are sick of violence, crime and corruption and the war
rhetoric," said Vladimir Milcin, who runs the Soros Foundation's Open
Society Institute here. "The victory of the opposition is so
clear.... Now it is the task of civil society to help keep the new
government under control. This is just the beginning."</TE>
<TE>   Macedonians of both major ethnicities--there are small groups of
people with other ethnic backgrounds in the country--were cautious in
assessing the impact of the election. They said they remained wary
that, despite campaign pledges, politicians might find it hard to
resist corruption, and added that the parties that lost power had
also promised to run a clean government.</TE>
<TE>   "We are choosing the lesser evil," said Georgi Marjanovic, a
Skopje law professor who is also a leader of a minor political party.
"But it is better especially because the corruption here during these
past four years was an embarrassment for the country."</TE>
<TE>   Western diplomats said the election appeared to have been
relatively fair.</TE>
<TE>   "Thus far, the results are very positive, especially when you
compare it with previous elections," said one diplomat, noting that,
in both the 1999 presidential election and 2000 local elections,
there were serious allegations of vote tampering and intimidation.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, there were only scattered troubling incidents: the
shooting of a supporter of one of the Albanian parties at a polling
place north of Skopje, the capital, and the robbery of a ballot box
from the ethnic Macedonian village of Lesok by armed ethnic
Macedonians believed to be allied with the current government. There
were also other reports of shooting near polling places.</TE>
<TE>   About 840 international election monitors patrolled the polling
places, backed up by the 700 troops from the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization who remain in the country as peacekeepers.</TE>
<TE>   Macedonia's government traditionally has been a coalition made up
of an ethnic Macedonian party and an ethnic Albanian one. Indeed,
Sunday's election was in essence two elections, since people of one
ethnicity almost never vote for those of another.</TE>
<TE>   There are 120 seats in the parliament, and a party or coalition
must control at least 61 to form a government.</TE>
<TE>   The possibility of postelection problems still exists, with real
questions about whether the winning Macedonian party will refuse to
form a coalition with Ahmeti's party because of his role in last
year's fighting. It is even possible, given the number of seats won
by the ethnic Macedonian Social Democrats, that they might not need
to form a coalition, but they will almost certainly be under
strenuous pressure from Westerners to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmeti has offered to eschew an official role in the government,
but clearly he would be managing his party from behind the scenes.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmeti's transformation from outlaw to legitimate politician was
almost certainly the most startling development in the campaign. In
his stronghold of Tetovo, the country's second-largest city, posters
of him looking well-groomed and wearing a respectable suit and tie
greeted visitors on every street.</TE>
<TE>   Among his supporters, there was no sign of the guns and camouflage
uniforms that were the signature of his National Liberation Army last
year. The only signal of his continuing rebel status was in the
conference room of his Tetovo-area headquarters, where five little
flags--including the United States'--were perched on the main table.
None of them was Macedonia's.</TE>
<TE>   A party strategist who asked not to be identified said the reason
for the omission was that the party feared that displaying the flag
would alienate ethnic Albanian supporters. However, the party must
walk a thin line between distancing itself from its rebel past and
using that past to rally voters.</TE>
<TE>   "Ahmeti represents the war and the crisis last year. He stands for
everything the Albanians are fighting for," said one of Ahmeti's
deputies, Agron Buxhaku, who gave up a job in the Belgian Parliament
to work for Ahmeti.</TE>
<TE>   There is little doubt that Ahmeti is viewed that way among ethnic
Albanians who hope that the changes he brought about through the deal
signed when the war ended will result in more jobs for them in the
police and military.</TE>
<TE>   "People love Ali Ahmeti. They would die for him," said Zemri
Arifi, 43, an unemployed man in the village of Tearce in northwestern
Macedonia.</TE>
<TE>   The Ahmeti party's program centers on the reestablishment of good
relations between ethnic Albanians and ethnic Macedonians, the
country's eventual integration into Europe and the eradication of
corruption.</TE>
<TE>   It is the last point that appears to have resonated most with
voters, many of whom seem to believe that what is really at stake is
control of the ethnic Albanian and Macedonian criminal enterprises
that rake in millions of dollars trafficking in drugs, weapons,
contraband, cigarettes and stolen cars. Both the reigning Albanian
party, led by Arben Xhaferi, and the party of Prime Minister Ljubco
Georgievski are alleged to be corrupt, essentially dividing the
spoils of their illegal businesses and illegal payments for expensive
licenses.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-corruption theme was also emphasized by the leading
opposition ethnic Macedonian party, headed by Branko Crvenkovski, who
was formerly in the government but lost power in an election that
elevated the current prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   Although Crvenkovski's party, the Social Democrats, is tainted by
its past, it has promised to make a fresh start.</TE>
<TE>   "Just as the current government has shown that corruption works
across ethnic lines, so does fighting corruption. You have to have
politicians who make a commitment to fixing the system," said Edward
P. Joseph, the director of the International Crisis Group's office in
Macedonia.</TE>
<TE>   In a strongly worded report released last month, ICG, a
Brussels-based group that monitors trouble spots worldwide, cited
rampant crime and corruption as the biggest impediments to stability
and a sense of normality in Macedonia.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph said that at least it was a good sign that both Ahmeti's
party and Crvenkovski's had pledged to make fighting corruption a
central concern.</TE>

<HD>Terror Suspect Likely to Face Charges in U.S.</HD>
<DH>Investigation: FBI is reportedly questioning alleged 9/11
plotter in Pakistan. Germany says America has 'priority' for man's
extradition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI and SHAMIM UR-REHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Signs mounted Sunday that Ramzi Binalshibh, the man believed to have
been the lead coordinator of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, will be
extradited to the U.S. to face charges for those crimes.</LD>
<LD>   Official sources in this port city said Binalshibh and other
suspected Al Qaeda terrorists, who were captured by police in a
series of raids here Tuesday and Wednesday, were being interviewed in
a military containment area.</LD>
<LD>   The interrogation was being conducted mainly by Americans, sources
close to the investigation said.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, officials said they were still not sure what would
become of the suspects, particularly Binalshibh.</TE>
<TE>   Before his capture, Germany issued an international warrant for
his arrest. But on Sunday, German Interior Minister Otto Schily said
that given the "terrible attacks of Sept. 11" on U.S. soil, "it goes
without saying that Americans have priority for his extradition."</TE>
<TE>   For its part, the United States did not equivocate: President
Bush's national security advisor, Condoleezza Rice, made clear Sunday
that the U.S. government would be asking that Binalshibh be
surrendered to American authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly want custody of him," Rice said on "Fox News
Sunday." "We certainly want to be able to find out what he knows."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials want Binalshibh sent to the United States in part
because Germany has no death penalty and is unwilling to extradite
suspects to countries where they might later face capital punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh was wanted in Germany for his alleged role in the Sept.
11 hijackings and crashes, which killed more than 3,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   Charges have never been leveled against him in the United States,
but he has been accused of being an unindicted co-conspirator in the
indictment of Zacarias Moussaoui, who prosecutors believe had been
destined to be the 20th hijacker if he had not been arrested before
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear whether U.S. authorities would want to put
Binalshibh on trial in a criminal proceeding or treat him as an enemy
combatant who might eventually face a military tribunal.</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh was taken into custody, along with 10 or 11 other
foreigners suspected of being Al Qaeda members, during a series of
raids that culminated in an hours-long gun battle Wednesday in a
well-to-do residential section of Karachi known as the Military
Division.</TE>
<TE>   A Pakistani army source speaking to Reuters news service confirmed
that the men arrested were undergoing intensive questioning at a
secret location.</TE>
<TE>   "They are being interrogated to retrieve maximum possible
information about other Al Qaeda suspects in Pakistan," the source
said, adding that the men were being kept blindfolded and handcuffed.</TE>
<TE>   The interrogation was being led by FBI agents with the help of
Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, Pakistan's military intelligence
agency, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the time, it's ... FBI officials," he added.</TE>
<TE>   No details emerged, however, about whether the suspects were
providing useful information. More than four days after the arrests,
in fact, authorities had failed to release a complete list of the
suspects' names or nationalities.</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh, who once roomed with lead hijacker Mohamed Atta in
Hamburg, Germany, reportedly was being held separately from the
others.</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh, a Yemeni, left Germany a week before the Sept. 11
attacks. Over the last year, he was believed to have traveled to
Afghanistan by way of Pakistan and then to have retreated into
Pakistan after the collapse of the Afghan Taliban regime in December.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few days before Binalshibh's arrest, Qatar-based Al Jazeera
television reported on a June interview it held with him in Karachi
in which he claimed to be the coordinator of the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan has indicated that a second high-level Al Qaeda figure
also was captured last week, but it has refused to identify him by
name or nationality.</TE>
<TE>   "Two out of those arrested are suspected to be high-level Al Qaeda
men, and their identity is being confirmed," officials said in a
statement Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation focused on Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, considered a close
associate of terrorist leader Osama bin Laden. Al Jazeera said
Mohammed was interviewed the same time as Binalshibh.</TE>

<HD>Rat Poison Is Suspected in 41 Deaths in China</HD>
<DH>Asia: Hundreds more are sickened after eating breakfast
snacks at the same restaurant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Rat poison may be to blame for a mass food poisoning that killed 41
people and sent hundreds to hospitals near China's eastern city of
Nanjing over the weekend, state media reported today.</LD>
<LD>   "Initial investigations indicate there was rat poison in the food
that was served to victims," the China Daily quoted Zhou Qiang, a
Jiangsu provincial government spokesman, as saying.</LD>
<LD>   The paper said doctors treating the victims said their symptoms
were consistent with ingesting rat poison, and Zhou said it could
have been put in a restaurant's breakfast snacks deliberately.</LD>
<TE>   The official New China News Agency said on its Web site Saturday
that 400 people, many of them schoolchildren and construction
workers, were poisoned at the breakfast shop in the town of Tangshan,
and 41 had died.</TE>
<TE>   It later reverted to an earlier story, saying 200 were poisoned,
and dropped the toll, saying that only a number of people had died.
Zhou was quoted by the China Daily as saying the death toll was "less
than 100."</TE>
<TE>   Locals who had seen scores of ambulances, however, estimated that
more than 100 had died, and some said they saw victims bleeding from
the mouth and ears.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities had held for questioning the boss of the Heshengyuan
Soy Milk chain store, which sells food including sesame cakes and
fried dough sticks.</TE>
<TE>   China's Cabinet and the Communist Party's Central Committee sent a
team of police and health officials to investigate the case, state
media said, highlighting concerns in Beijing about bad publicity in
the run-up to a key leadership transition expected later this year.</TE>

<HD>Thousands Attend Islamic Gathering in London</HD>
<DH>Religion: Event marked by fiery anti-Western rhetoric shows
the division among Muslims in Britain over accepting mainstream
values.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Radical Muslim speakers drew thousands of followers to a London
ice-hockey arena Sunday, denouncing the West at what organizers
called the largest Islamic gathering in Britain since the Sept. 11
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The fiery rhetoric, delivered to a crowd of about 9,000 mainly
young people, showed the deepening rift in Britain's 2-million-strong
Islamic community over whether Muslims should accept mainstream
culture or reject Western values.</LD>
<LD>   Moderate Islamic groups, saying radicals make up a tiny proportion
of their community, accuse the media of giving too much attention to
firebrands.</LD>
<TE>   But the audience at Sunday's conference, organized by Hizb
ut-Tahrir, a group that calls for the creation of an Islamic state in
Central Asia, was receptive to strong denunciations of the West.</TE>
<TE>   "The take-home message was that the ideologies of Islam and the
Western capitalist world are not compatible. We must not fall into
the trap of integration," Imran Waheed, Hizb ut-Tahrir's leader in
Britain, said after the conference.</TE>
<TE>   "Since Sept. 11 we have been told to choose between accepting
capitalism or being labeled terrorists, but we have chosen a third
way: to maintain our Islamic identity."</TE>
<TE>   Waheed said the group denounced any U.S. action to overthrow Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein. But he added that he would not tell British
Muslims to rise up if Britain joined a possible attack on Iraq, as
some radical clerics have done in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Waheed said Hussein needed to be replaced but not with a
Western-mandated figure like Afghan President Hamid Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   Issam Amireh, a Palestinian cleric, said: "They want Muslims to
integrate and to accept democracy, which is a one-way ticket to
hellfire."</TE>
<TE>   Islamic groups in Britain are broadly divided into those who say
they see Muslims becoming part of British society and those who say
they reject Western values.</TE>
<TE>   A tiny but vocal minority has shown sympathy with the Sept. 11
hijackers, alarming mainstream groups who say such views discredit
the peace-loving majority.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most radical held a rally at a North London mosque
Wednesday on the anniversary of the attacks, observing what they
called "a towering day in history."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain, an umbrella group
for British Muslim organizations, said there was nothing un-Islamic
about joining the mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't accept that Islam is being watered down because
adherents learn to speak English or integrate into British society,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's meeting was about establishing a worldwide Islamic state
and this is not what we are about at all," he added.</TE>
<TE>   But the more radical messages on offer Sunday appeared to have
struck a chord with some in the crowd, which the organizers estimated
at more than 9,000.</TE>
<TE>   A teenager wearing a baseball cap that read "Property of Islam,"
said: "I am tired of my religion being kicked around, and I'm ready
to fight for it."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Inspector's Stance on Iraq Sparks Storm</HD>
<DH>Weapons: Scott Ritter says U.N. teams rid 95% of Saddam
Hussein's arsenal. Critics and colleagues question the depth of his
knowledge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN and BOB DROGIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When former United Nations arms inspector Scott Ritter got home from
Baghdad Tuesday night, he was greeted by a flood of e-mail messages.</LD>
<LD>   Some applauded his courage in standing up to the Bush
administration's war rhetoric by telling Iraq's National Assembly
that the U.S. had no "hard facts" that Baghdad possesses weapons of
mass destruction. Others, saying he'd been brainwashed by President
Saddam Hussein, suggested that he turn in his U.S. passport and move
to Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   "People who call me a traitor are disrespecting American
democracy," Ritter said in an interview, one of dozens he juggled in
the days after his return. "It's mind-boggling."</LD>
<TE>   Mind-boggling is a word often applied to Scott Ritter these days.
As a weapons inspector, he pioneered new techniques to ferret out
Hussein's most virulent weapons. When Ritter resigned in 1998, he was
hailed by conservatives in Congress for standing up to what he saw as
lack of spine in the Clinton administration and the U.N. Security
Council.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraq today is not disarmed and remains an ugly threat to its
neighbors and to world peace," Ritter told a Senate committee in
September 1998. "Americans who think that ... something should be
done about it have to be deeply disappointed in our leadership."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.), called him "a true American hero."
Democratic Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware was less kind,
faulting Ritter for reaching "above his pay grade" in presuming to
tell White House officials how to conduct foreign policy. "That's why
they get paid the big bucks," Biden said. "That's why they get the
limos, and you don't."</TE>
<TE>   These days, Ritter is sounding a different warning. Concerned
about the White House's drumbeat for "regime change," he argues that
95% of Hussein's arsenal was disarmed by the U.N. inspection teams
between 1991 and 1998. The only way to determine whether Iraq has
rearmed in the last four years, he says, is to let inspectors back
in.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no hard evidence, no hard evidence whatsoever," Ritter
told CNN on Friday. "I'm not saying Iraq doesn't pose a threat. I am
saying that it has not been demonstrated to pose a threat worthy of
war."</TE>
<TE>   So this former Marine, a tough-guy Republican with a taste for
intelligence work and a knack for media splash, has been embraced by
the anti-war movement. He says he has little in common with his
latest allies--"they're tree-huggers and I'm for chopping down the
forests," he explains--except for an understanding that war without
provocation is wrong.</TE>
<TE>   His passion for inspections is born of adrenalin-pumping days in
Iraq. There were the "dog ate my homework" excuses Iraqi officials
used to deter detection: Books were missing; documents had been
destroyed during the war; the key to the office was lost. There were
confrontations in parking lots when inspectors refused to leave after
being denied entry to a building. Shots were fired over their heads.</TE>
<TE>   'Underdogs' in the Game</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great game, and we were the underdogs," recalled another
weapons inspector, who asked that his name not be used to avoid a
personality clash with Ritter. "We were like hotel thieves, cooking
up all kinds of creative methods to get in." Being on the inspection
team, he said, "was the highlight of all of our lives."</TE>
<TE>   If some see Ritter's obsession with inspections as nostalgic,
others ridicule him for taking a 180-degree turn and for
demonstrating--as former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North did in
embroiling the Reagan White House in an arms-for-hostages swap with
Iran--that Marines are sometimes better at "taking the hill" than
understanding it.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the classic Marine problem," said Patrick Clawson, deputy
director at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. "It's
building a bridge over the River Kwai, when it's not apparent that a
bridge is what is needed."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1998, Ritter has earned his living as a lecturer. He wrote
"Endgame," which Simon &amp; Schuster is reissuing in paperback. With
$400,000 from an Iraqi American businessman, Shakir Alkhafaji, he
produced a documentary about Iraq, "In Shifting Sands," which will
also be the title of his next book. Ritter bristles at the comparison
to North, who invoked his 5th Amendment rights before Congress
granted him immunity. Ritter also insists that he has done no
180-degree turn, being a fan then and now of the power and efficacy
of inspections. And he is quite angry about accusations that he has
become Hussein's lobbyist.</TE>
<TE>   "I despise what Saddam has done to his people, I wish ... he'd
drop dead," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The trip to Baghdad--funded in part, he says, by peace groups--was
not meant as propaganda for Hussein but as a counter to the White
House media blitz against Iraq. "I used the address to the Iraqi
National Assembly to put my message before the American public," he
said. "I knew Bush was meeting with [British Prime Minister] Tony
Blair. I knew the administration would have its voice on the Sunday
talk shows. I decided to launch a preemptive strike."</TE>
<TE>   A Born Military Man</TE>
<TE>   Ritter is the youngest of four children--and the only son--born
into a military family. His father was in the Air Force. His mother
was a military nurse. The formative high school years, he says, were
spent in Hawaii, Germany and Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   As a kid, he had a special fondness for history, painting
Napoleonic toy soldiers in uniforms researched for accuracy. Ritter
remembers enjoying the combat simulation games in "Strategy &amp;
Tactics," a military history magazine.</TE>
<TE>   He became a Marine, then a weapons inspector sent to the Soviet
Union to enforce the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force Treaty. There
he met his future wife, Marina Khatiashvili, a translator from the
Soviet republic of Georgia. His marriage raised eyebrows in
intelligence circles, where Soviet translators were assumed to be
working for the KGB.</TE>
<TE>   Ritter later applied to the CIA but was derailed by a lie detector
test in which he admitted sharing intelligence with Israel while an
inspector in Iraq--one of his tactical maneuvers to outsmart Hussein,
he says. In two interviews before he left for Iraq, Ritter argued
that the U.N. teams destroyed all the weapons and fundamentally
disarmed Iraq before Hussein barred further inspections in late 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing left that we were aware of that we hadn't
destroyed," he said. "We had suspicions. We had concerns. But we had
no hard evidence."</TE>
<TE>   One reason, he asserts, was his own success as an inspector. "You
wouldn't believe how thorough we were," he said. "In 1992, I went
through Iraq like Attila the Hun."</TE>
<TE>   He dismisses concerns that Baghdad retains several highly
sophisticated devices, called lenses, used to help trigger nuclear
explosions. Iraqi troops tossed the lenses into a truck and then onto
the ground, he said. "Whatever they had was smashed."</TE>
<TE>   He challenges assertions that Iraq has reserves of VX, a deadly
nerve agent, and the means to make more. "The R&amp;D is destroyed. The
major production equipment is destroyed. The warheads are destroyed.
So they don't have the capability to produce VX."</TE>
<TE>   And he ridicules fears that Iraq could deliver anthrax, smallpox
or other deadly biological agents via a long-range missile. "The only
way an Iraqi biological bomb would kill you is if it hit you on the
head," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As for Iraq's nuclear program, "absolutely nothing is going on in
nuclear," he said. "Everything was destroyed. They'd have to be
buying new stuff [from abroad], importing it, installing it, putting
in electricity feeds. We'd see it. We'd know it."</TE>
<TE>   Ex-Inspectors Skeptical</TE>
<TE>   Ritter's statements have stunned other former U.N. weapons
inspectors. Richard Spertzel, the chief biological weapons inspector
in Iraq from 1994 to 1998, ridiculed Ritter's assertions during a
Senate subcommittee hearing Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "How does he know what 100% is?" Spertzel asked. "I don't. And how
many biological sites did he visit? The answer is none. He has no
knowledge of those sites."</TE>
<TE>   David Kay, the chief nuclear inspector in Iraq from 1991 to 1993,
agreed. He said Ritter sharply criticized the ability of U.N.
inspection teams to disarm Iraq when he testified before Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "Either he lied to you then or he's lying to you now," Kay said.
"He's gone completely the other way. I cannot explain it on the basis
of known facts."</TE>
<TE>   So Long, Baghdad</TE>
<TE>   But Ritter says he has been more consistent than critics allow,
favoring inspections instead of either war or a shrug of
indifference. Sobered by the intensely angry reaction over his trip
to Iraq, Ritter says he has no plans to visit Baghdad again.</TE>
<TE>   But he does plan to keep speaking out. This fall he will be in
Britain for the Labor Party conference, and in Berlin, Vienna and
Copenhagen to talk to anti-war groups.</TE>
<TE>   "People who call me a traitor today cheered me wildly when I
resigned," he said. "But I can't let them fabricate the facts for
war. If we want to sell American democracy, by God we have to live
it."</TE>

<HD>3 GIs Involved in Brawl With South Koreans</HD>
<DH>Asia: U.S. military says soldiers were attacked by
protesters. But witnesses reportedly claim that one of the Americans
started the fight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Three U.S. soldiers were assaulted on a Seoul subway over the
weekend, and one was briefly abducted by South Korean university
students on their way to an anti-American demonstration, the U.S.
military reported Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Embassy here lodged an immediate protest with the South
Korean government over the incident and the way it was handled by
local police.</LD>
<LD>   There were sharply conflicting versions of who was at fault in
what apparently started as a brawl on the subway.</LD>
<TE>   In an unusually angry statement, the U.S. military said the three
soldiers were accosted by a large group of students and political
activists who were on their way to a demonstration Saturday night at
Seoul's Kyunghee University. The activists allegedly tried to hand
the soldiers a leaflet about the demonstration, which concerned two
14-year-old girls killed in an accident involving a U.S. military
vehicle. When the soldiers refused to take the Korean-language
leaflet, the statement said, the crowd became angry and a scuffle
broke out.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers then got off the subway to wait for a later train. At
that point, the military said, they were surrounded by demonstrators
who "pulled, punched, kicked and spat" on them as about 200 people
looked on. Two of the soldiers were turned over to South Korean
police, but a third--identified as Pvt. John Murphy--was dragged to
the demonstration.</TE>
<TE>   "The demonstrators allegedly abducted Murphy and took him against
his will to the university's stadium where a memorial demonstration
was being held for the two teenaged girls," the U.S. forces statement
said. "The captors allegedly forced Murphy to watch the
demonstration. During this time he was photographed, videotaped and
allegedly forced to make a public statement about the incident on the
train and in support of the demonstrators."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy was then taken to the university hospital and forced to
apologize to a man, identified as political activist and former
legislator Suh Kyong Won, 65, who had sustained a black eye and,
according to some reports, a broken nose during the subway scuffle.
Murphy was later charged by local police with assault, although
according to the U.S. military, he had been attacked by Suh and had
acted in self-defense. Murphy apparently was held for two hours.</TE>
<TE>   "No charges have apparently been brought against the Korean
participants in this incident, but it is expected that charges of
restraint against one's will and aggravated assault will be filed,"
the U.S. military statement said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Army spokesman Stephen Oertwig added: "It is very unsettling
that this sort of thing could happen. The soldiers were scared for
their lives." He said the soldiers, newly arrived in South Korea,
were on their way back to their base after an early dinner in Seoul
and had followed all procedures correctly.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's Yonhap news agency, however, quoted witnesses as
saying that Murphy had started swearing and had punched Suh in the
face in anger over the leaflets.</TE>
<TE>   "He hit me with the fist when I protested about his swearing," Suh
was quoted as saying from his hospital bed.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Murphy, the other soldiers were identified as Pvts. Eric
Owens and Shane Tucker. Their ages and hometowns were not given. All
three are from the 2nd Infantry Division and are stationed at Camp
Red Cloud, near the demilitarized zone that separates North and South
Korea. Other soldiers from the 2nd Infantry Division were involved in
the June 13 accident in which the two teenagers were crushed to death
by an armored bridge carrier that was being driven along a narrow
road.</TE>
<TE>   The accident has fueled a simmering resentment of the 37,000 U.S.
troops stationed in South Korea, whose presence are seen by some
South Koreans as an affront to national sovereignty. Although two
soldiers have been charged with negligent homicide and are facing
court-martial, many South Koreans say they should have been handed
over to local courts.</TE>
<TE>   "Extremely unwise is the U.S. military that keeps turning a deaf
ear to the rising voices of anger from Koreans.... Koreans are
struggling to defend their dignity and values against the double
standards used by their supposedly trusted benefactors," an editorial
in the Korea Herald, a moderate English-language daily, said last
month.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent lunch with foreign journalists, South Korean President
Kim Dae Jung said: "It worries me that there is a growing trend
toward anti-Americanism.... But no one wants to sever ties with
Washington. The U.S. is our most important ally and plays an
essential part in promoting peace and stability on the Korean
peninsula."</TE>
<TE>   The demonstration at Kyunghee University was organized by
Hanchongryon, a leftist student organization. Members of the group
ransacked the office of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce here in February
to protest a visit to South Korea by President Bush.</TE>

<HD>Sweden's Socialists Win Vote</HD>
<DH>Politics: Electorate backs the ruling party, which has
pledged to preserve welfare state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>STOCKHOLM</DL>
<LD>Sweden's ruling Social Democrats won national elections Sunday,
beating the center-right opposition as voters backed Prime Minister
Goran Persson's pledge to preserve the nation's cherished
cradle-to-grave welfare system.</LD>
<LD>   With nearly 100% of the ballots counted, it was clear that Swedes
had voted to keep the industrialized world's highest taxes to pay for
a big public sector, rather than opting for the tax cuts and
privatization offered by the center-right opposition.</LD>
<LD>   With his party getting 40% of the vote, Persson said he would
again look to support from the Left and Green parties. The three
parties had a combined 191 parliamentary seats, compared with 158 for
the four center-right opposition parties, led by the Moderate
Coalition Party, according to official results. However, Persson has
ruled out a formal coalition with the Left and Greens, because both
oppose Sweden's membership in the European Union.</LD>
<TE>   The election's main surprise was the gain by the Liberal People's
Party after leader Lars Leijonborg, 52, came out strong with a
proposal requiring immigrants to pass a Swedish language test before
gaining citizenship. The Liberals' support tripled, making them the
third-largest parliamentary party, while the Moderates lost 27 seats
in their worst showing since 1973.</TE>
<TE>   For one pressing policy decision, a referendum on adopting the
euro as currency, Persson can count on support from most of the
center-right even if the Greens and Left oppose it.</TE>

<HD>Storm Brews Over Executive Pay</HD>
<DH>Business: Shareholders, regulators and lawmakers are moving
to scale back compensation as outrage grows over alleged excesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF and RALPH FRAMMOLINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Renewed concern about executive pay--stoked by news reports about the
retirement perks offered to former General Electric Co. Chairman Jack
Welch and allegations of millions in secret loans made to Tyco
International Ltd.'s top officers--is pressing government officials,
shareholders and stock exchanges to act.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, the Conference Board, a business think tank, will
issue proposals to rein in executive pay. This follows a high-profile
speech last week by a top Federal Reserve official, who blasted
executive compensation levels and called on business leaders to take
voluntary pay cuts. And by year's end, the giant California Public
Employees' Retirement System will consider ways to exert influence
over the pay policies of the companies in which it invests.</LD>
<LD>   Some lawmakers and institutional investors want to force companies
to run the cost of providing employee stock options through corporate
income statements--a move hotly opposed by many firms.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the AFL-CIO is trying to embarrass executives by
pointing out the inconsistencies in what they say and do and to
exercise the group's considerable clout as a pension fund manager by
opposing management in certain proxy battles.</TE>
<TE>   Though the prescription may be debated, analysts say it's clear
the financial world is now focused on problem pay.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts believe that investors have become so disenchanted
and distrustful of company managers--some of whom appear to be
running firms for their own enrichment rather than the good of
shareholders--that it's undermining faith in the stock market, which
already is suffering through a 2 1/2-year slump.</TE>
<TE>   "This causes a lot of anger and public mistrust and will play
itself out in people not investing, people sitting on their savings,"
said Warren Bennis, a USC professor and an authority on leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Discontent initially arose earlier this year as stories spread
about the lavish rewards reaped by executives at failing companies
such as Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc. and Global Crossing Ltd. But the
issue flared up again recently.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday two former Tyco executives were accused of
systematically looting the company, partly by secretly borrowing
money and then having the company "forgive" the loans.</TE>
<TE>   Days earlier, company-paid perquisites to former GE Chairman Jack
Welch hit the headlines, when Welch's estranged wife alleged in court
filings that GE continues to pay millions of dollars to keep Welch in
private planes, company-paid apartments and limousines.</TE>
<TE>   As the evidence of excess mounts, so do the calls for change. On
the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, William J.
McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank and a
possible successor to Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, said in a speech
that executive pay has gotten out of hand and urged chief executives
to cut their own compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, the Conference Board will unveil a set of specific salary
recommendations produced by a blue-ribbon panel of regulators,
business leaders and investors that includes John C. Bogle, founder
of mutual fund giant Vanguard Group and Andrew S. Grove, chairman of
Intel Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board wouldn't tip its hand to precisely what would
be proposed, but Carolyn Brancato, its director of corporate
governance, said the cycle created by basing executive salaries on an
ever-escalating average of top-paid people has to be broken.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the New York Stock Exchange and the National Assn. of
Securities Dealers have imposed requirements aimed at reducing the
potential conflicts of interest that could affect corporate directors
who decide on executive pay.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional leaders, including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), have
proposed legislative solutions. McCain wants to force companies to
account for the cost of stock grants given to employees on corporate
balance sheets. Rep. Martin Sabo (D-Minn.) has proposed limiting
corporate tax deductions for executive pay that exceeds 25 times the
income of the company's lowest-paid worker.</TE>
<TE>   AFL-CIO officials--shareholders in a wide array of corporations by
virtue of the labor group's $400-billion pension system--said Friday
that they intend to use their clout to push proposals at 300 large
companies to tighten up corporate governance and scale back executive
pay.</TE>
<TE>   William Patterson, director of the AFL-CIO's office of
investments, said the labor group plans to press a four-point plan to
"decouple" CEO pay from short-term price movements and overreliance
on stock options.</TE>
<TE>   With nearly two-thirds of U.S. equity holdings in the hands of
mutual funds, pension managers or other institutions, it is pivotal
that those organizations become active in the debate, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, in the past, it has been difficult to get big institutions to
speak out against excessive executive pay because many of the
nation's largest mutual fund companies are hired by company managers
to operate corporate pension funds and 401(k) programs. For these
institutions to publicly criticize executive pay is tantamount to
biting the hand that feeds them, said Ken Bertsch, director of
corporate governance at TIAA-CREF, the big New York-based mutual fund
and pension administrator.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a perceived pressure on mutual fund companies to be
quiet," Bertsch said. "They often don't take a public stance, even
when they're tougher in their proxy voting than people realize."</TE>
<TE>   That, too, is changing.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS, the nation's largest public pension fund, with nearly
$140 billion in assets, has instructed its staff to present formal
initiatives about executive pay to the group's board by year's end,
for example. Though CalPERS has occasionally spoken out about
executive compensation in the past, it generally has been content to
let others take action, said spokeswoman Patricia Macht.</TE>
<TE>   "Executive pay has not been a formal program, but that's going to
change," Macht said. CalPERS now is looking at CEO pay as a
"diagnostic tool" that can signal when a company's business conduct
is out of whack.</TE>
<TE>   Big mutual fund companies, such as Vanguard and Fidelity
Investments, also have revealed plans to get more involved in
targeting the ways companies set executive pay.</TE>
<TE>   Some companies already are beginning to buckle by voluntarily
agreeing to some investor demands--such as recording stock options as
an expense--and making it tougher for executives to reap windfalls
from stock gains when the company's stock does no more than simply
keep up with the stock market as a whole, said Judy Fischer, managing
director of Executive Compensation Advisory Services of Alexandria,
Va.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America Corp. recently awarded options to executives that
vest only after the shares reach $30 over the market price on the
date of grant, she said.</TE>
<TE>   However, legislative reforms are certain to meet an uphill battle.
Though investors are lining up in support of reining in pay, powerful
corporate organizations ranging from the Business Roundtable to
groups representing the technology industry are almost equally
steadfast in their determination to stop any strict dictates.</TE>
<TE>   An official with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, for
example, bristled at McDonough's remarks about restricting executive
pay.</TE>
<TE>   If Fed members stuck to tending monetary policy "instead of
worrying about how private-sector companies and private-sector
individuals determine private-sector compensation, the whole country
would be better off," said Martin Regalia, the chamber's vice
president for economic and tax policy.</TE>
<TE>   "CEO pay is a private market decision between the company board of
directors and the individual that is offered the job," Regalia said.
"We don't suggest that baseball players that bat .260 or go 5 for 13
should have their pay limited.... Singling out one particular group
and saying this group is paid too much or too little is totally
inappropriate."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, some contend that the threatened baseball
strike was averted largely because fans became outraged enough to
threaten a strike of their own. Investors may well be headed into the
same type of empowering revolt.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way you are going to stop this is if owners
[shareholders] start getting involved," said shareholder activist Bob
Monks. "The only way to get owners involved is if they get so
revolted that they stand up en masse and say, 'What the heck are you
doing with my money?' "</TE>

<HD>Unity May Yet Break Out in Fractious Media Clan</HD>
<DH>Business: Hoiles family, with the Orange County Register as
its flagship, sees a generational shift.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE and MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Harry Hoiles took the news like a knife to the back.</LD>
<LD>   Hoiles had gone to Florida in 1982 for a newspaper publishers'
conference just weeks after the death of his older brother Clarence,
head of the family-owned Freedom media company. Harry, by all
accounts a quiet and gentle man, was expecting to succeed him like a
prince in a house of royalty.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Harry's younger sister and her husband took him aside and
said the family planned to look elsewhere for a new chief executive.
They weren't about to entrust mild-mannered Harry with the family's
golden goose: Freedom Communications, publisher of the Orange County
Register and a string of smaller newspapers and broadcast outlets.</LD>
<TE>   "It ruined him," recalled Harry W. Hoth, a longtime friend who
runs a Colorado-based broadcasting company. "It just completely
devastated and confused him."</TE>
<TE>   But it also ignited him.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Hoiles, who was in the second generation of ownership,
shared the family's staunch libertarian views rejecting government
regulation of business. But he swallowed those principles to file a
lawsuit seeking the breakup and sale of Freedom.</TE>
<TE>   The legal challenge failed, but it drew the very private Hoiles
clan into a very public feud, bitterly fragmenting the family even as
its members remained bound to one another through their joint
ownership of Freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "After the lawsuit was filed, the birthday cards stopped coming,
the invitations to weddings stopped coming," recalled Harry's son
Tim, who retold his father's account of the 1982 meeting. (The father
died in 1998.)</TE>
<TE>   The 20-year rupture has not healed. The bad blood bubbled anew
this summer as Tim Hoiles--now the third generation--renewed a quest
to cash out his family's 8.6% stake in Freedom Communications, now
the nation's 12th-largest media company. In many ways, the Hoiles
saga is a sequel to the stories of other notable American newspaper
families, from the Binghams of Louisville to the Chandlers of Los
Angeles. In each case, publishing empires founded by early 20th
century entrepreneurs fell out of family hands as the later
generations fragmented.</TE>
<TE>   But in August, the Hoiles story veered from the script as members
of the family's fourth generation of ownership persuaded their elders
to give them time to put together a buyout package that would give
them control of the company, one of the nation's highest-profile
proponents of libertarian philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few of the fourth-generation members have ever worked for
Freedom. And only one--Raymond C.H. Bryan, 32--serves on Freedom's
board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   But "the fourth generation is a very united group," said Francois
de Visscher, a Connecticut-based family business consultant working
with the Hoiles descendants. "They are very attached to the family
business, very attached to the family heritage and what Freedom
stands for."</TE>
<TE>   And while the fourth generation has inherited a stake in the
company, de Visscher said, its members did not inherit the feud that
embroiled the second and third generations.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to stay together as an investor group," he said. "They
feel the investment is sound financially, but there are other reasons
for holding onto it. In today's investment world, what opportunities
do you have to be an owner of a company that's been in the family for
generations?"</TE>
<TE>   Privacy Is Paramount</TE>
<TE>   Despite making a fortune selling news, the Hoiles family remains
intensely jealous of its privacy. None of the fourth-generation
members and only one of the third--Tim Hoiles--would consent to an
interview about the family legacy and future.</TE>
<TE>   But a partial family history can be gleaned from court records and
other documents, as well as interviews with old friends of Raymond C.
Hoiles--"R.C.," the first-generation patriarch--along with Harry
Hoiles and former Freedom executives.</TE>
<TE>   It is the tale of a family dynasty struggling to define itself
against the weight of its success, and of its past.</TE>
<TE>   One of the few notable newspaper families to have successfully
handled the generational transition now confronting the Hoiles clan
is the Sulzbergers, publishers of the New York Times, Boston Globe
and other mostly Eastern U.S. papers.</TE>
<TE>   The reason: The family carefully mapped out a plan for succession
by grooming an heir-apparent in each succeeding generation, said
Larry Pryor, an assistant professor of journalism at USC's Annenberg
School for Communication.</TE>
<TE>   That standard bearer can "stand tall in the face of the onslaught
of those who want to cash out" and "build bridges" to dissidents to
keep the company intact, he said. The Hoiles family had no such plan,
trusting that the loyalty of blood would overcome any disputes.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that they don't have a Sulzberger that can rise to the
occasion just makes it that much more difficult and unlikely that
they'll keep it together," Pryor said.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Hoiles said he advised his father in the early 1970s, a couple
of years after R.C.'s death, to get the family to define the order of
succession in writing. Harry refused, believing that family loyalty
made such legalisms unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   "If he had a fault, it would be that he was very trusting of
people," Tim Hoiles said.</TE>
<TE>   Blood loyalty did work for a while. R.C. Hoiles founded the chain
in the 1920s with a few small newspapers in his native Ohio, and
brought in his eldest son, Clarence, then about 20, to learn the
business.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Hoiles sold out his holdings in 1932 and took a few
years off to read political and economic theory while moving to
California to begin his newspaper career again.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very bright man," said Roy Smith, who as a teenager went
to work for Hoiles in the 1940s and retired six years ago as
publisher of Freedom's Colorado Springs newspaper. "He had this
terrific mind, so razor-sharp, and a nice air of independence."</TE>
<TE>   Hoiles took a modest view of his own wealth, said Smith, who
considered Hoiles his mentor.</TE>
<TE>   "He liked to drive big, fast cars, but he bought his suits off the
rack at Penney's," Smith said. "He never used his wealth in any sort
of conspicuous-consumption way.... He was an Ohio farm boy, with all
those values, definitely a Midwestern ethos."</TE>
<TE>   Hoiles bought the Register newspaper in Santa Ana in 1935 and
began building the Freedom chain by buying small-market papers across
the country. The Register was his flagship, and it was renowned for
its libertarian voice and at times anachronistic approach to
journalism. Conservative activists used its letters columns as a
political bulletin board, and news stories often were approached from
a libertarian or conservative viewpoint.</TE>
<TE>   That changed in the mid-'70s, when the Register stories began
embracing more mainstream journalistic standards of objectivity.</TE>
<TE>   A Standout Philosophy</TE>
<TE>   Hoiles was a libertarian apostle, passing out books to recruit
initiates, wearing buttons urging the United States to quit the
United Nations and arguing on his editorial pages against government
funding of education. He gained notoriety as one of the few
publishers to editorialize against the detention of Japanese
Americans during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   His sons inherited the philosophy, Harry more than Clarence, and
they practiced it as well. Over the years Freedom endured
long-running battles with unions, refusing to enter into contracts
and competing with union-financed newspapers in Lima, Ohio, and
Colorado Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Hoiles built his empire with Clarence, the heir-apparent, working
alongside him. But he also included his second son, Harry, and his
daughter's husband, Robert C. Hardie, by making them publishers of
Freedom papers. Harry settled in Colorado Springs, where he ran the
Gazette. The daughter, Mary Jane, and her husband moved to
Marysville, Calif., where Hardie published the Appeal-Democrat for
more than 50 years. Hardie also served as chairman of Freedom for a
number of years.</TE>
<TE>   The first two Hoiles generations and their spouses ran the
business until 1982, when Clarence died and Harry was pushed aside.
Though the family brought in outside executives that year,
descendants of R.C. Hoiles still retain tight control. At least five
of his grandchildren or their spouses--the third generation--have
played significant roles in running the company. Of six family
members on the board, five are from the third generation.</TE>
<TE>   Family members divide $13 million to $14 million in annual
dividends under a complicated formula. Few ownership details are
public, since Freedom is privately held by 11 branches of the family
descended from Clarence, Harry and Mary Jane, some of it in family
trusts and others held outright by individuals.</TE>
<TE>   Clarence, Harry and Mary Jane each inherited about one-third of
Freedom when R.C. Hoiles died. They in turn passed on their stakes to
their children and grandchildren, which began the fragmentation of
the holdings. Clarence and Mary Jane each had four children and 10
grandchildren; Harry had three children and eight grandchildren, one
of whom--Tim's daughter Sarah--died in a car crash in 1997 at age 20.</TE>
<TE>   The largest single block of shares, about 9.6%, is controlled by
R. David Threshie, former publisher of the Register and Freedom vice
president, and the husband of Judith Hoiles, one of Clarence's four
children. Steven Hardie, one of Mary Jane's sons, controls about
8.8%, and Tim Hoiles controls about 8.6%, according to internal
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the fourth generation emerged at a family meeting of
shareholders Aug. 10, convened at Tim Hoiles' instigation to review
options that included an outright sale of Freedom, and proposed
keeping the company in the family by buying out those of the third
generation who wanted to sell.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth generation collectively holds less than 15% of Freedom,
which analysts said makes it exceedingly difficult to raise enough
money to buy out the third generation. It would take as much as $200
million to buy out Tim Hoiles alone, and more than $1 billion to buy
control of the company.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates of the company's worth range from $1.5 billion to more
than $2 billion. Freedom publishes 28 dailies, most in small cities,
and 37 weeklies, with a combined circulation of 1.2 million. With a
circulation of more than 300,000, the Orange County Register is by
far Freedom's largest paper. The company also owns eight television
stations in smaller markets such as Albany, N.Y., and Lansing, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   The push to cash out comes at a time when the company has
struggled with losses tied to ill-fated forays into magazines and the
Internet. Freedom has said it had pretax profit of $23 million for
the first six months of this year, compared with $55 million in
losses in the first half of 2001--before the industry was hit with
revenue slumps tied to economic fallout from the Sept. 11 terror
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Although Freedom has about $400 million in debt, much of it from
the failed ventures, newspaper analyst John Morton believes the
fourth generation could raise enough money with outside help and the
possible sale of some holdings, such as Freedom's television
stations.</TE>
<TE>   "If this is what it takes to keep the company in the family's
hands, I think they'll find a way," Morton said.</TE>
<TE>   An Awkward Reunion</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the Hoileses are strangers to one another, the
legacy of that 20-year-old falling-out.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Hoiles, a compact, balding man of 50 with a passion for
Harley-Davidson motorcycles, hadn't seen his cousin Melissa Stewart,
part of the Hardie branch of the family, in more years than he could
track. Yet she lives less than two hours north of his home in
Colorado Springs, where the Rockies shoulder their way west.</TE>
<TE>   That's what a fractured family can do--turn a scenic two-hour
drive into an impossibility. But earlier this year Tim Hoiles needed
Stewart and many other relatives.</TE>
<TE>   He needed their votes to force Freedom to let him cash in his
shares. So he called Stewart in Boulder and made his overture, then
drove up on a weekend to see her. He was surprised to learn how far
apart they had grown over the years, the distance formed by bad blood
and wounded pride.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't realize she was a painter," Hoiles said last month in
his office, surrounded by the bounty of hunting trips, including a
giraffe mounted from the shoulders up, several antelopes and a bear
rug. "I was blown away."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart declined to comment, but Hoiles said she gave him her
support, part of 54% of the voting shares he said he has lined up
behind his plan to sell the company. Those shares were drawn from the
Harry and Mary Jane branches of the family, reversing the years-long
alignment between the Mary Jane and Clarence branches that initially
forced Harry out.</TE>
<TE>   One insider said the current fight can be defined more closely.
Tim is on one side. Spouses of two of Clarence's daughters--Threshie
and Richard A. Wallace, a Freedom board member and vice
president--are on the other. The Hardies are in the middle.</TE>
<TE>   Tim joined the family business in 1974 after leaving college
without a degree. He was publisher of Freedom papers in Ohio and
Texas before landing in 1978 as publisher of Freedom's daily in the
California high-desert city of Victorville, where he and his wife had
a side business as local Amway dealers.</TE>
<TE>   Paying Familial Price</TE>
<TE>   The fallout from his father's lawsuit against the rest of the
family made it increasingly difficult for Tim, who backed his father,
to be effective as a Freedom publisher.</TE>
<TE>   "I had capital requests [to fund projects] on the books for three
years and they wouldn't give them to me," he said. Meanwhile, he and
his wife were dissatisfied with local schools. "Put those two things
together and we decided to get out of it and go back to Colorado
Springs to manage my parents' assets."</TE>
<TE>   Tim remained a director and is still on the board. In recent
years, he said, the dwindling value of Freedom and stagnant
dividends--"I can do better in a money-market fund"--led him to
revive his family's desire to cash out their holding in Freedom.</TE>
<TE>   He entered the August meeting set up to discuss options with the
54% of the shares in his corner, but some of that eroded when a small
group of fourth-generation members made a pitch to buy out the third
generation. It was a case of children telling parents they wanted
time to pursue a plan.</TE>
<TE>   Enough third-generation family members wanted to give their
children that time that Tim no longer had his majority. "I decided
not to push it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But as he waits to see whether the fourth generation can raise the
money to buy out his interest in the family company, he's still not
sure what is driving them.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been trying to figure out how to ask them," he said.
"They've said they don't want to lose the legacy of R.C. and
libertarianism. But if that was such a big concern to them, as
expressed at the gathering, why aren't more of them in the business?"</TE>

<LD>FBI investigators believe photocopy machines were the reason anthrax
spores were spread throughout an office building in Boca Raton, where
a tainted letter was mailed in last year's attacks, according to a
published report.</LD>
<LD>   Federal investigators returned last month to the American Media
Inc. building for 12 days, armed with new techniques for detecting
large quantities of anthrax.</LD>
<LD>   The investigators found anthrax spores in all of the copy machines
in the three-story, 68,000-square-foot building, a source familiar
with the investigation told the Palm Beach Post.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>New Mexico's Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Bill Richardson, put
his right hand on ice after eclipsing a political handshake record
set in 1907 by President Theodore Roosevelt.</LD>
<LD>   Richardson's new mark of 13,392 for an eight-hour period, with a
Guinness World Records official standing by, went well beyond the
Roosevelt record of 8,513 handshakes set at the White House.
Richardson divided his handshaking between the New Mexico State Fair
and a tailgate party outside the University of New Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   As it happens, Richardson broke the record only for politician
handshakes. The overall record for glad-handing, Guinness
representative Stuart Cloxton said, is held by Yogesh Sharma of
India, who set a record of 31,118 handshakes in January 1996 at a
trade fair.</LD>

<HD>Hope Has Dried Up on Farms</HD>
<DH>A crippling drought in the nation's breadbasket brings home
to growers their dependence on federal aid. Many despair at their
plight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GARDEN CITY, Kan.</DL>
<LD>The sun spun through the broad prairie sky, day after day after
merciless day. The corn wilted. The soybeans withered.</LD>
<LD>   Those farmers who had wells drew on them day and night, spraying
each parched field with 300, 400, 500 gallons of water a
minute--every minute, around the clock, for months. All that water
scarcely dampened the soil. Most evaporated before it hit the ground.</LD>
<LD>   Drought has seared much of America's breadbasket barren this
summer, burning millions of acres of corn, beans and sorghum. There
won't be much of a harvest this autumn. Nor much of a planting
season. In many of the country's most fertile plains, farmers will
scatter their wheat seeds this month on soil as dry as concrete.</LD>
<TE>   The drought, as bad in spots as the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, has
broken spirits. And it has prompted reflection--unhappy
reflection--about the future of farming in these vast, rich plains
when the only money to be made comes from handouts.</TE>
<TE>   Even in fine weather, grain farmers in the heartland rely on
federal subsidies to make ends meet. Usually, they can point to the
bursting bins of inexpensive food they produce as justification for
the aid. This year, though, thousands have little to show for their
government checks--just rubbery ears of corn pocked with five or
eight desolate kernels, just stunted stands of soybeans with
yellowing leaves.</TE>
<TE>   The subsidies feel, more than ever, like welfare.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you not feel embarrassed?" asks Robert Drees, a farmer
here in western Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate last week approved $6 billion in emergency disaster aid
for farmers and ranchers stricken by drought. Farm families are
begging a reluctant House to take similar action. The truth is,
though, that many can't see an end to the emergency. The drought may
ease. But these months of ferocious sun have brought home the stark
truth of their predicament.</TE>
<TE>   With a bumper crop or with no crop at all, they are dependent.</TE>
<TE>   "They've spent a lot of time crying and praying," said Kathy
Bosch, who counsels farm families in Nebraska. "They've lost their
sense of control."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly half of all farm income comes from the federal government
these days. That figure fluctuates from year to year, depending on
commodity prices, but it's been rising steeply since 1996 and is now
near a record high. Nationwide, the average annual subsidy is more
than $36,000. Many of the larger producers, who carry hundreds of
thousands in expenses for seed, fertilizer and equipment, get more.
In Kansas alone, dozens of farmers received subsidies topping
$200,000 last year. A handful took in more than $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   Drees stares out the window of his pickup. The purple dusk deepens
into another rainless night.</TE>
<TE>   Autumn is usually a joyous season for him, the brimming loads of
corn, alfalfa and sorghum sweet payoff for months of sweat. This
year, though, his emotions are as blistered as his land. He planted
1,200 acres of sorghum on "dryland" fields that aren't irrigated;
they depend on summer rains for water. More than half of those fields
produced crops so sparse, he won't bother to harvest. On the
remaining acres, he'll be lucky to get 10 or 15 bushels to the acre.
His standard yield is 70.</TE>
<TE>   Drees would welcome emergency drought aid. Yet he's ashamed to be
asking for it, especially in a recession that has so many Americans
hurting.</TE>
<TE>   "We start sounding like a bunch of never-ending whiners with our
hands out," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The 1996 Freedom to Farm bill ended a decades-old system of paying
farmers not to plant. The goal was to wean rural America off
subsidies. It failed. Free to plant whatever they wanted, farmers
produced way more than the market could bear. Prices plunged and
taxpayers ended up fronting farmers more than ever.</TE>
<TE>   The new farm bill, passed this year, keeps the subsidies flowing.
It will cost $180 billion over the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you tell the computer engineer who just lost his job that
farmers need billions more subsidies?" Drees said. "How do you tell
the person who had his whole retirement in Enron stock?"</TE>
<TE>   Drees, 44, farms the land that his father and his grandfather and
his great-grandfather farmed before him. He is the first to figure
federal subsidies into his annual business plan. He won't say how
much money he gets. He will say it seems like an awful lot for one
man, though without it, he'd never break even, much less support his
family.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to say that we've lost our pride," he murmurs. "I
didn't get into this business to get government payments. But I don't
see how we can survive without."</TE>
<TE>   He pauses. "If there's a way to say thank you to the country, I'd
like to say it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The drought shows up on weather maps as an angry swirl across the
Great Plains, the Rocky Mountains, the Southwest, the Eastern
Seaboard.</TE>
<TE>   The National Drought Mitigation Center in Lincoln, Neb., reports
that two-thirds of the United States is gripped by at least moderate
drought. More than 40% of the nation's land mass is suffering drought
classified as "severe" or worse.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few weeks, the darkest blotch on the map--designating
"exceptional drought"--has receded slightly. A few, much-blessed
rains have fallen. Some land has been reclassified from "exceptional"
to merely "extreme."</TE>
<TE>   Extreme is plenty bad.</TE>
<TE>   From southern Montana through Arizona, from the California desert
to the Kansas plains, many communities report this year's rainfall at
40% of normal. In western Nebraska, this is the most arid year ever
recorded--and records stretch to the 1880s.</TE>
<TE>   In western Kansas, it's possible to dig 12 feet without hitting a
trace of moisture. The state's hardiest crop, the sunflower, can send
roots down an impressive 8 feet. This year, that's not far enough.</TE>
<TE>   Precipitation in the Garden City area is running about 50% of
normal, and much of that has fallen in the last few weeks--too late
to help the wheat harvested earlier in the summer or the corn that
will be picked this month. Many soybean fields too are beyond
salvage.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way we can over-emphasize how serious this is," said
Barry Flinchbaugh, an agricultural economist at Kansas State
University. "It looks like the Great American Desert." Indeed, some
fields in southwest Kansas are carrying less than 3% of their water
capacity.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically," said Mary Knapp, the state climatologist, "that means
you wouldn't be able to tell [the soil] from concrete."</TE>
<TE>   As farmers like to point out, even the hardy yucca--a desert
plant--is dying.</TE>
<TE>   Grazing ranges across the West are so parched, the federal
government has let ranchers bring their livestock onto millions of
acres that were set aside as wildlife habitat. Even so, countless
ranchers have had to sell off their cattle, unable to feed them.</TE>
<TE>   So many baby birds perished in South Dakota that the fall pheasant
hunt--a $100-million industry--will be severely crimped. Biologists
can find just two to three pheasants per square mile across much of
the state. In a good year, there might be 14.</TE>
<TE>   And the farmers? Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota says they're
losing $5 million a day in his state alone. Sen. Kent Conrad of North
Dakota speaks of farm wives forced to visit food banks to fill their
cupboards. Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson sounds shaken when he talks of
walking fields that are brown instead of green: "To go to farms that
have had crops, some good, some bad, but crops every year for 70
years, and then to see that this year there is no crop for the first
time ever, is an eye-opening experience."</TE>
<TE>   Like other agricultural disasters, this one is likely to drive
some family farmers off the land.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas bankruptcy attorney Bill Zimmerman said this summer has
been busy: "I've seen more farmers and ranchers than I've seen in
years." And most agricultural bankers don't start calling in their
loans until winter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's only going to get worse," he predicted.</TE>
<TE>   Crop specialist Roger Stockton knows the despair: He has spent the
last several weeks trudging through fields in northwest Kansas,
advising farmers whether it's worth it to keep watering their crops.</TE>
<TE>   "In most places, it's been pretty clear-cut. There's no hope," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Early projections indicate that the national corn crop will be
down 6.5% this year and the soybean harvest will drop 9.1%. The
numbers are far worse in the West. Here in Garden City, farmers are
bringing to the grain elevator only about half their usual harvests
of sorghum and wheat and just two-thirds of the customary soybean
haul.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing there," said Carl Setzkorn, who farms 270 dryland
acres in west Kansas but will harvest next to nothing. Worry lines,
creased deep, tug at his face.</TE>
<TE>   Another local farmer, Dallas Savolt, has abandoned 1,300 acres of
dryland corn. "We won't pick any of it," he said. What few stalks
have grown, he'll leave in place, hoping they'll anchor the soil to
keep it from blowing away this winter.</TE>
<TE>   Even on some of Savolt's irrigated fields, the corn is almost
worthless. In a warm dusk the other evening, he watched from his
pickup as a harvester ground up the pathetic ears for silage, a
low-grade cattle feed.</TE>
<TE>   "What does it feel like? What do you think it feels like?" said
Savolt, 27. "It feels like I should have went to college and done
something else with my life."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A billboard on Interstate 70 boasts that the average Kansas farmer
feeds "128 people, plus you." Folks here are proud of that statistic.</TE>
<TE>   While they may feel uneasy about receiving subsidies, they point
out that the payments help keep food cheap. The only way they could
stay afloat without aid, they argue, would be for commodity prices to
double or even triple. That might happen if the supply of grain fell.
But farmers feel trapped in a vicious cycle: Their profit margins are
so slim that they push to squeeze ever more corn out of an acre, ever
more berries out of a sorghum plant. The abundant yields keep prices
low. So farmers race to produce ever more.</TE>
<TE>   They grumble that they need a union, a national grain cartel to
limit the harvests. Then they stop themselves. They know they would
never join. Too stubborn. Too independent.</TE>
<TE>   The ironic result: Their determination to go it alone ends up
forcing them to turn again and again to the government for help.</TE>
<TE>   Years when the weather cooperates, they need almost as much aid as
they do in a drought, because bumper crops bring disastrous prices.</TE>
<TE>   "The past few years, prices were so low, we would have been better
off not planting anything at all, just taking the government
payment," said Russell Schartz, 68, who farms 600 acres near Ingalls,
Kan. He shrugged. "That's what farming is these days."</TE>
<TE>   And that's why Robert Drees feels ashamed.</TE>
<TE>   Years like this, when he doesn't have much of a crop to show for
the taxpayer money he collects, he wonders whether he's worth the
investment. Whether farming the Great Plains is any way for a proud
man to live.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the emotional part of this drought," he said. "It's a real
roller-coaster ride. You think about it every day."</TE>
<TE>   Drees has urged his three sons to seek a different life. Yet he
can't bring himself to leave the land. Not yet. His ancestors built
this farm. His neighbors measure him by its success.</TE>
<TE>   So, for now, he stays. He harvests the scrawny ears of corn his
fields produced this summer. He ponders how deep to plant his wheat
in the dusty clods that pass for soil. He scans the horizon for rain.</TE>

<HD>McBride's Lead Over Reno Less After Recheck</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Bill McBride's lead over Janet Reno in Florida's Democratic
gubernatorial primary has dwindled to 5,685 votes, according to
numbers released Sunday by both campaigns.</LD>
<LD>   Reno and McBride campaign officials said they learned the former
U.S. attorney general has picked up 2,511 votes in Miami-Dade County
based on rechecked ballots cast in precincts that had technical
problems.</LD>
<LD>   In the state's unofficial totals, McBride held a 8,196-vote lead,
a larger margin than the half a percentage point that was necessary
to trigger a statewide recount.</LD>
<TE>   Even if the new vote totals were to bring Reno within that margin,
there is no provision to trigger a recount after unofficial totals
are tallied.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Jim Smith said the winner would be the leading
vote-getter after votes are tabulated Tuesday and certified by
Wednesday's deadline; that means Reno's only chance of winning would
be to overtake McBride outright before then.</TE>
<TE>   That appears difficult for Reno. Fewer votes were expected from
Broward County, the only place left expected to turn up a significant
number of new votes.</TE>

<HD>Case Based on 'Material Support'</HD>
<DH>Law: Government will get broad leeway in the prosecution of
five men arrested near Buffalo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The government plans to prosecute the five alleged Al Qaeda
operatives from the Buffalo, N.Y., area under a broad 1996
anti-terrorism law that does not require proof that the accused did
anything illegal in the United States--or even planned to do so.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the government must show only that the defendants
provided "material support" to a known terrorist organization by
giving it money or taking its "training."</LD>
<LD>   Legal experts said Sunday that anti-terrorism laws allow the
government to cast a wide net to capture participants in a terrorist
ring.</LD>
<TE>   "This makes sense, because we are trying to cut off support for an
organization that can wreak havoc--and participating in their
training is a way of assisting the terrorist organization," said
Stephen A. Saltzburg, a law professor at George Washington
University.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint, which was made public Saturday, says the five
men--all U.S. citizens of Yemeni heritage--traveled to Afghanistan
and took military training at an Al Qaeda camp in the summer of 2001.
They were not charged with doing anything upon their return to
Buffalo, and FBI agents found no weapons at their homes.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not fully know the intentions of those charged today," FBI
Director Robert S. Mueller III said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department lawyers stressed that under the law, they did
not have to show that the suspects intended to commit "an actual
terrorist act."</TE>
<TE>   The 1996 law makes it a crime to "knowingly provide material
support to foreign terrorist organizations."</TE>
<TE>   When the legislation was passed, lawmakers said they wanted to bar
Americans from sending money to terrorist groups operating in the
Middle East, such as Hamas. But the law was not limited to sending
money. It defines "material support" to include "lodging, training,
safe houses, false documentation or identification, ... weapons,
explosives and transportation."</TE>
<TE>   The law's wording suggests that it makes it illegal to provide
training for terrorists, but department officials said it also
applies to taking training from known terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department had designated Al Qaeda a foreign terrorist
organization in 1999, long before the five men from Buffalo traveled
to Afghanistan for their training.</TE>
<TE>   The 19 men who participated in the Sept. 11 attacks all were
killed, and so far the government has not charged anyone in the
United States with directly aiding the plot. However, charges have
been lodged against several people for conspiring to aid terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Zacarias Moussaoui, a French citizen, faces the death penalty if
convicted of conspiring to aid the Sept. 11 terrorists, even though
he was behind bars when the attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon occurred. He was arrested in mid-August of 2001 after flight
school officials in Minnesota became suspicious of his desire to fly
jumbo jets despite his minimal flying skills.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a Seattle man, James Ujaama, was indicted for
allegedly providing material support by setting up a training camp
for terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   In April, New York defense lawyer Lynne Stewart was charged with
providing material support for terrorists because she allegedly
passed messages from her client, imprisoned Sheik Abdel Rahman, to
his followers.</TE>

<HD>Liberals at Odds Over Appeals Court Nominee</HD>
<DH>Legal: Professor backed by academics. Activists assail his
views on abortion and religion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The ongoing Senate battle over President Bush's judicial choices will
focus this week on University of Utah law professor Michael W.
McConnell, a soft-spoken, scholarly conservative whose nomination to
a U.S. appeals court has driven a wedge between Washington's liberal
activists, who oppose him, and many of the nation's most prominent
liberal academics, who support him.</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks ago, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee
rejected Bush's choice of Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen
for the federal appeals court in New Orleans, describing her as a
conservative judicial activist.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, the committee will hold a hearing on McConnell, 47,
and liberal groups are urging his defeat as well because he has
spoken out against abortion and the strict separation of church and
state. Bush nominated McConnell to the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of
Appeals in Denver in May 2001.</LD>
<TE>   "We're opposing him because his extensive writings show a
hostility to firmly established constitutional rights, such as the
right to choose," said Nan Aron, president of the Alliance for
Justice, a coalition of civil rights and civil liberties groups.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph G. Neas, president of the liberal People for the American
Way, says he respects McConnell's legal skills, but he opposes giving
him a lifetime seat on the federal bench. "Michael McConnell may be
the most dangerous Bush administration judicial nominee yet to come
before the Judiciary Committee," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League and Americans United for Separation of Church and State are
also urging the Democrats to reject McConnell.</TE>
<TE>   Yet unlike other Bush nominees, McConnell has strong support among
the nation's law professors, 300 of whom signed letters to the
Judiciary Committee in favor of his confirmation. Many of those who
signed are well-known for their liberal interpretations of legal
issues.</TE>
<TE>   Yale law professor Akhil D. Amar, a liberal constitutional
scholar, calls McConnell "America's preeminent scholar of religious
liberty."</TE>
<TE>   The University of Chicago's Cass R. Sunstein, a liberal
constitutional theorist, calls him "extraordinarily able, one of the
best constitutional scholars in the country."</TE>
<TE>   "He is conservative, but he is not an ideologue," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Sunstein pointed out that McConnell opposed the impeachment of
President Clinton in a letter to House Republicans, and he faulted
the Supreme Court for ending the Florida recount after the disputed
2000 presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard law professor Laurence H. Tribe, a leading liberal
constitutional law specialist, and  Walter Dellinger, a former
Clinton administration lawyer and Duke law professor, also support
McConnell.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most remarkable letter of support came from Elena
Kagan, another Harvard law professor. Clinton nominated her in 1999
to the U.S. appeals court in Washington, but Senate Republicans
killed her nomination without even giving her a hearing.</TE>
<TE>   In a Sept. 10 letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman
Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), she urged that McConnell, a former
colleague at the University of Chicago Law School, be confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   "I never knew Michael to be anything other than thoughtful,
open-minded and even-handed in his approach to legal questions," she
wrote. "There is no part of Michael that is activist or extremist. I
do not believe he ever would bend the law to get a political result."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most academics, McConnell has argued issues that have had a
clear effect on the law. He has been an architect of a broad shift in
the law on religion, a move away from the strict separation of church
and state and toward a doctrine of equal treatment for religion.</TE>
<TE>   In law review articles, he argued that the framers of the
Constitution did not intend a strict separation of church and state.
He also advocated this view successfully in a series of cases before
the Supreme Court. For example, he won a 5-4 high court ruling that
evangelical Christian students at a state university deserved the
same subsidy for their campus magazine as student groups that
promoted causes such as environmentalism.</TE>
<TE>   The University of Virginia had argued that the Constitution barred
it from using state funds to promote Christianity, but the court said
equal treatment and free speech for the Christian students is not the
same as government favoritism for religion.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, McConnell won a similar ruling that allowed the
nation's parochial schools to receive federal aid for buying
computers on the same basis as other private and public schools. This
decision paved the way for the high court decision in June that
upheld Ohio's voucher law under which parents can obtain tuition aid
to send their children to religious schools.</TE>
<TE>   In his writings and legal arguments, McConnell stressed that he
favored a "genuine equality of rights" in matters involving religion,
but that he did not support a return to school-sponsored prayers or
Bible readings. "Toleration of the expression of others does not come
easily, but toleration must be even-handed. I am hard-pressed to
understand why traditionalist citizens should be expected to tolerate
the use of their tax dollars for lewd and sacrilegious art, while
others go to court to ban nativity scenes from public property at
Christmas," he told a House committee considering prayer in schools.</TE>
<TE>   His critics say McConnell's writings include many extreme
statements that make him ill-suited to being a federal judge.</TE>
<TE>   For example, lawyers for People for the American Way say McConnell
faulted the high court's ruling that took away tax deductions for Bob
Jones University in South Carolina over its policy that barred
interracial dating on campus. McConnell said the court failed to
"protect religious freedom from the heavy hand of government."</TE>
<TE>   In other writings, McConnell has described abortion as "an evil"
and called the Roe vs. Wade ruling that made it legal "an
embarrassment" to constitutional law.</TE>
<TE>   McConnell also helped write a brief to the Supreme Court for the
Boy Scouts of America, arguing in favor of its right to exclude an
openly gay scoutmaster. In June 2000, the high court sided with the
Boy Scouts on a 5-4 vote.</TE>

<HD>Bush May Have Won the Battle but Lost the War Over an Iraq
Invasion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush's speech to the United Nations last week didn't end
the domestic debate on whether to invade Iraq. But it put Bush in a
much stronger position to carry the argument. Now he has to guard
against the danger that Saddam Hussein will adapt the tactics Bush
employed in the speech to his own advantage.</LD>
<LD>   The key to Bush's speech was his recognition that in a tug of war,
sometimes there's leverage in letting go. Bush accepted demands from
his critics at home and abroad that he involve the U.N. before acting
against Iraq. In so doing, he defused a central argument against war
without materially shifting his course. Bush did the same thing a few
days earlier when he agreed to seek congressional approval before
shots are fired.</LD>
<LD>   In both cases, Bush strengthened his hand by giving ground on
process without conceding anything of substance. The danger in this
strategy is that it leaves Hussein an opportunity to try the same
thing: accepting a process of weapon inspections and U.N.
intervention that preempts military action without truly eliminating
the threat he poses.</LD>
<TE>   At home, the U.N. speech sharply tilted the terms of debate over
Iraq in Bush's direction. As the war drums have grown louder,
skeptics in both parties have relied most heavily on procedural
objections: Bush shouldn't go to war without asking Congress, without
asking the U.N. or without giving international arms inspections one
last chance.</TE>
<TE>   In wartime, it's common for critics to focus on such process
questions. The reason isn't complicated--when the commander in chief
presents military action as essential to national security, opponents
usually find it safer politically to challenge his means than his
goals.</TE>
<TE>   While polls show support for moving against Hussein, for instance,
they also indicate most Americans would strongly prefer the U.S. to
act with allies. Thus, even those officials who aren't sure an
invasion is a good idea under any circumstance have felt more
comfortable talking about the danger of acting alone.</TE>
<TE>   "The [opponents] ... didn't want to say 'no' " to an invasion,
says Gary Schmitt, executive director of the Project for the New
American Century, a hawkish think tank. "When you don't want to say
'no,' you come up with all kind of debate about the means."</TE>
<TE>   But Bush has stripped away that fig leaf by accepting the
procedural steps his critics demanded. That will force opponents to
more directly debate the underlying substantive question: whether
military action against Iraq makes sense.</TE>
<TE>   Those skeptical of war still have valid arguments on that front.
Madeleine Albright, secretary of state under President Clinton, and
Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) last week raised what may be the best
argument against attacking Iraq: the risk that it will divert
attention and resources from the pursuit of Al Qaeda. Others have
raised the possibility that Hussein, faced with overthrow, might
precipitate a wider war, preemptively attacking Israel or even Saudi
Arabia. These are legitimate questions Bush hasn't really begun to
answer.</TE>
<TE>   But the cold political fact is that fewer politicians are likely
to feel comfortable substituting their judgment for the commander in
chief on these substantive issues than on procedural decisions, like
whether to act without the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   Even before last week's speech, both chambers in Congress were
likely to approve resolutions supporting military intervention. But
the decision to work through the U.N. virtually guarantees Bush a
bigger margin--even if he ultimately decides he has to act against
Iraq without U.N. sanction. An aide to a leading liberal senator
predicts that half of Democrats (and virtually all Republicans) would
support an American invasion of Iraq if Bush makes a good-faith
effort to pass a new U.N. resolution with teeth but is blocked by
other nations.</TE>
<TE>   That prospect explains why success at the U.N. may be a greater
danger for Bush than failure. Failure at the U.N. would come if the
United States isn't able to sell other nations, particularly Russia,
on a new regime of weapon inspections and human rights monitoring
that Bush considers strong enough to subdue Hussein. But if such a
U.S. proposal is blocked, Bush would almost certainly attract more
support, not only at home but also abroad, for invading Iraq on his
own.</TE>
<TE>   More dangerous for Bush may be success: U.N. approval of a
resolution that locks the United States into a new round of weapon
inspections, and perhaps even broader efforts to reshape Iraq. The
administration is dubious that any inspection regime can really deter
Hussein, and will surely propose a much more intrusive approach than
the U.N. imposed on Iraq after the Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   But any system designed by human hands will still allow room for
Iraqi mischief and conflicts between the United States and other
nations (France and Russia first on the list) about whether Hussein
is complying. If a resolution passes, Bush, no matter how much he
resists, could still find himself constrained by the system he
creates. "Are you going to be able to go to war because inspectors
were kept in a parking lot for 15 minutes?" worries one
administration official.</TE>
<TE>   That's why for Hussein, accepting a new inspection regime might be
the equivalent of Bush's decision to ask the U.N. for one: A
concession on process that doesn't change his substantive goals (in
Hussein's case, of surviving and developing weapons of mass
destruction).</TE>
<TE>   The odds are greater that inspectors never return to Baghdad; any
inspection regime acceptable to Bush is likely to be unacceptable to
Hussein, and vice versa. Which is why the White House is willing to
risk initiating a U.N. process few in the administration believe will
ultimately extinguish the danger. But having begun that process,
there's no guarantee Bush can conclude it without accepting another
round of negotiations and inspections that delay and complicate the
military action he clearly believes is the only viable solution.</TE>
<TE>   Bush should recognize that problem. By asking the U.N. to act, the
president faces a situation much like the critics who demanded he
consult before any attack: He may get what he's asked for, and not
like it very much.</TE>

overheard them discussing terrorism plans. The men later said the
incident was simply a misunderstanding.</LD>
<LD>   The head of Larkin Community Hospital said Sunday that he had
received more than 200 e-mails since the incident, some threatening.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, nothing is final," Dr. Jack Michel said. "Our primary
objective is to take care of patients. I don't know how that could be
done with all this media coverage."</LD>
<TE>   He said the school where the men are studying, Ross University,
had agreed to transfer them to a different training program.</TE>
<TE>   Kambiz Butt, 25, said Sunday that he and Ayman Gheith, 27, and
Omar Choudhary, 23, simply want to clear their names and continue
their education in America.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not terrorists," Butt said, flanked by Gheith and
Choudhary. "Our concern in life is to become doctors. We want to help
people. We do not want to hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Butt also said that they harbor no resentment toward the woman who
told authorities she overheard them discussing terrorism plans.</TE>

<HD>Terrorism Case Stuns an All-American Town</HD>
<DH>Legal: In Lackawanna, N.Y., family and friends react with
disbelief and anger over allegations that the five arrested were
linked to Al Qaeda.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LACKAWANNA, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>It says something about the contradictions abounding in this small
city that an alleged Al Qaeda terrorist cell here would include a
local youth counselor, an auto salesman, former high school athletes,
sons of steelworkers.</LD>
<LD>   Family and friends of the five men accused of lending support to
Osama bin Laden's terrorist network reacted with disbelief and anger
Sunday as camera crews from the media patrolled their gritty
neighborhood on the Lake Erie shore just south of Buffalo.</LD>
<LD>   It's an all-American enclave--with basketball hoops above many
garage doors, children riding bicycles in the streets and teens
cruising with car stereos at full blast. Yet the narrow streets also
have a strongly Middle Eastern flavor. Many women and girls dress in
chadors, their heads covered, and the local Islamic mosque is perhaps
the central gathering point.</LD>
<TE>   More than 100 people gathered at a social club Sunday afternoon to
discuss the case that some feared would lead to ostracism or
discrimination against the local Yemeni community, which numbers
about 2,000 and dates to the 1930s. Outside the meeting, which was
closed to the press, Adbulwahab Ziad, head of the Lackawanna Islamic
Mosque, where the suspects worshipped, said he was confident that the
five will be found not guilty and that the government will apologize
for charging them.</TE>
<TE>   Others pointed out that well before the arrests Friday and
Saturday, all five had had conversations with FBI agents. "They were
cooperating," said one young man who declined to identify himself.
The accused are Sahim Alwan, 29; Faysal Galab, 26; Yahya Goba, 25;
Shafal Mosed, 24; and Yasein Taher, 24. All are U.S. citizens of
Yemeni descent and all live within a few blocks of each other in
Lackawanna's 1st Ward, within sight of the massive Bethlehem Steel
plant that shut down in the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   A 12-page federal complaint unsealed Saturday lays out the charges
against the five, saying that they and three "uncharged
co-conspirators"--identified only by the letters A, B and C--received
weapon training at an Al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan between April and
June 2001. The unnamed co-conspirators also are U.S.-born Lackawanna
residents of Yemeni descent, the complaint says.</TE>
<TE>   The men accused of aiding Al Qaeda had made no secret of the fact
that they had traveled to Pakistan. But the supposed purpose of the
trip was to visit and receive religious training, said Mohamed
Albanna, vice president of the American Muslim Assn. of Greater New
York.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan camp is the one where the so-called American Talib,
John Walker Lindh, was trained--although authorities would not say
whether Lindh was there at the same time. The complaint does state
that Bin Laden visited the camp while the Lackawanna men were present
and gave a speech "espousing anti-United States and anti-Israel
sentiments."</TE>
<TE>   A sixth New York resident has been arrested in Bahrain, family
members told the New York Times on Sunday. A federal official told
the paper that more details on the new arrest would be given today.</TE>
<TE>   At his arraignment Saturday, Alwan told U.S. District Judge H.
Kenneth Schroeder Jr. that he earns $31,500 a year working for an
organization in nearby Medina, N.Y., that runs an academic and
vocational training center for underprivileged youth. He is married
with three children.</TE>
<TE>   When the judge asked whether he was still employed, the
well-dressed, bespectacled Alwan said: "Yeah, I guess. I don't know
yet." Alwan served as president of the mosque three years ago,
Albanna said. The thriving mosque serves 400 to 500 worshipers in the
heart of the Yemeni neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   According to the federal complaint, Alwan initially denied having
traveled to the Afghan camp while he was on the religious trip to
Pakistan. But on Thursday, confronted with the confession of
"Co-conspirator C," Alwan admitted that he had visited the camp and
received training there along with Galab, Goba, Mosed and Taher, the
complaint says. Galab, Mosed and Taher are longtime friends and
former teammates on school and youth soccer teams and were often seen
together at the mosque.</TE>
<TE>   Taher's uncle, Abdul Noman, said in an interview Sunday at the
neighborhood soccer club that he had coached all three men when they
were on the youth teams.</TE>
<TE>   Taher was the best player of the three, fast and well-disciplined,
a star when he played for the Lackawanna Steelers high school soccer
team, Noman said. Taher quit playing much soccer after he married his
high-school sweetheart and they had a son, his uncle said. Taher is
one of six children of Noman's sister, who immigrated to the United
States from Yemen in 1967. His father, grandfather and uncles all
worked at Bethlehem Steel.</TE>
<TE>   Taher is the most religious of his siblings, regularly praying at
the mosque and refusing to drink alcohol or eat pork, but he hardly
stands out as a religious zealot, Noman said. "He's like any other
young guy," Noman said. "He eats hamburger, pizza, Buffalo chicken
wings."</TE>
<TE>   Taher paid for his trip by borrowing money from friends and
relatives, Noman said. He said Taher remarked that he hadn't enjoyed
the trip because of the primitive conditions in Pakistan, including
the lack of electricity and running water in many places.</TE>
<TE>   At the home where Mosed grew up, two doors from the mosque, family
members said they were exhausted by the strain of the arrests and the
media siege.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't understand what it's doing to us," said Albaneh Mosed,
20, Shafal's younger brother. He too told reporters that his brother
was happy to return to the United States after the difficulties of
Pakistan. Mosed, married with a 2-year-old child, is a part-time
student at Erie Community College.</TE>
<TE>   Galab, also married with a young son and daughter, has worked
selling cars at a local gas station. His defense lawyer, Joseph
LaTona, criticized the government's affidavit as "hearsay" and
"second-hand information." LaTona said that to his knowledge, Galab
had never been to the Afghan camp.</TE>
<TE>   Goba, a heavy-set man with a thick beard, recently married and is
refurbishing a small wood-frame house in the neighborhood while
living in a rented apartment.</TE>
<TE>   When Schroeder was about to swear him in during Saturday's
arraignment, Goba said he would place his hand "only on the Koran,
not on the Bible." The judge did away with the swearing-in procedure
for Goba and the other four.</TE>
<TE>   No one answered the bell at Goba's apartment Saturday. Penciled on
the front door was this message: "Allah is one, he is the only one
who corrected everything."</TE>

<HD>Home May Prove Viking 'Sagas'</HD>
<DH>Archeology: A UCLA team's apparent finding of a New World
native's Iceland residence supports the tale of a trip about AD 1000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A UCLA team has apparently found the Iceland home of Snorri
Thorfinnsson, the first person of European descent born in the New
World.</LD>
<LD>   Icelandic sagas from the 13th century tell the story of how
Snorri's parents led the first Scandinavian group that attempted to
settle in Vinland--on the Canadian coast--about AD 1000.</LD>
<LD>   The attempt failed and the family moved to Iceland, but Snorri was
born while they were in North America.</LD>
<TE>   The "Vinland Sagas," which also tell the story of Leif Ericson,
are the earliest recorded history of the Scandinavian people, but
there has long been a debate over whether they represent real events
or are simply an allegorical tale meant to deliver a moral message.</TE>
<TE>   The 1960 discovery of Viking settlements at L'Anse aux Meadows in
Newfoundland provided some confirmation of the sagas. The apparent
discovery of Snorri's home provides more.</TE>
<TE>   "These sagas were written in Iceland, and they must have been
thinking about this site," said UCLA archeologist John Steinberg, who
led the expedition. "Could this specific story [in the saga] be true?
This site may well hold the answers."</TE>
<TE>   Archeologist Kevin P. Smith of Hunter College in New York City
added: "This is a fairly large, fairly well-appointed house. It's in
the right place, from the right time. It may well be" Snorri's home.</TE>
<TE>   The sagas tell the story of four Viking voyages to the New World.
The second saga recounts the story of the pagan Thorfinn Karlsefni,
who married the converted Christian woman Gudrid Thorbjarnardottir.
With three boats containing 60 to 70 people, livestock, seeds and
other supplies, they left for the New World about AD 1000 to
establish a colony.</TE>
<TE>   According to the sagas: "Karlsefni's son Snorri was born [in
Vinland] the first autumn and was 3 years old when they left."</TE>
<TE>   "Conflict with the native population made the settlement
impossible," Smith said, and they returned to Iceland, where they
established a farm called Glaumbaer. Thorfinn sailed to Norway and
sold a boatload of goods from Vinland, becoming relatively rich in
the process.</TE>
<TE>   Gudrid, described in the sagas as "the most attractive of women
and one to be reckoned with in all her dealings," made one or more
trips between Iceland and Greenland and eventually traveled to Rome
to meet the pope. She became a nun and returned to Iceland, where she
established a church. "She was probably one of the most well-traveled
women of the period--and all of it in an open boat," said historian
Elisabeth Ward of the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of Natural
History.</TE>
<TE>   The family played a major role in the traveling Smithsonian
exhibit, "Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga," which recently came to
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg's continuing project in Iceland is a survey of 26 farms
in five areas of the Skagafjordur fiord valley in northern Iceland.
This region, he said, "is one of the few documented chiefdoms" that
are known. His ultimate goal is to understand how the chiefdoms, in
which private properties' rights were enforced without a central
government, eventually gave way to regional rule. His approach is to
determine how settlement patterns changed.</TE>
<TE>   But archeology is difficult in Iceland, an island about the size
of Kentucky. There are virtually no trees, so buildings were
constructed from turf. The inhabitants also severely abused their
environment. "They put way too many sheep on the land, and all the
soil from the highlands eventually blew onto the coastal regions,"
Steinberg said. "As a result, the archeology is invisible, especially
in the most important areas."</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA team has been surveying the region with sophisticated
equipment that measures the electrical conductivity and resistance of
soil. The turf used in construction has a much lower conductivity, so
electrical patterns reveal where walls are located.</TE>
<TE>   They found what they believe to be Snorri's home about 150 yards
east of the Glaumbaer Folk Museum, just outside the seaside village
of Saudarkrokur. The museum, which documents 18th century rural
Icelandic life, was once thought to have been built on the site of
Snorri's home.</TE>
<TE>   "We had always assumed that the original house must be under the
standing modern turf house, in the very same spot and therefore
mostly destroyed," said Sigridur Sigurardottir, the museum's
director. "But now we have found out that it was in our museum hay
field all along, just under the surface."</TE>
<TE>   The building is "a classic German fortress longhouse like the
Great Hall of Beowulf," Steinberg said. It is 95 feet long--about 50%
longer than Viking longhouses in Newfoundland and Trelleborg,
Denmark, indicating prosperity--and about 30 feet wide, with
5-foot-thick walls. A thick floor of ash and trampled clay was found
at the house's center, about 85 feet long by 5 feet 7 inches wide.
Six-foot-wide raised sleeping benches line both sides of the
building.</TE>
<TE>   A thin layer of volcanic ash from the 1104 eruption of Mt. Hekla
covers the remains, indicating that the structure was abandoned about
1100, when the residents moved up the hill to what is now the site of
the museum. Excavations in a garbage pit outside the museum show that
the site has since been continuously occupied, Steinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   The team has found few artifacts at the site, but they have not
excavated much of the building yet. There are also several smaller
outbuildings around the main structure, which they also have not
begun to study.</TE>
<TE>   The team will spend another five years excavating the site. "What
we are hoping for are artifacts from North America or Rome," Ward
said. "One would think she [Thorbjarnardottir] brought something home
with her. We are keeping our fingers crossed that it survived. "</TE>

<LD>   What: "If Winning Were Easy, Everyone Would Do It"</LD>
<LD>   Authors: Kim Doren and Charlie Jones</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Andrews McMeel</TE>
<TE>   Price: $12.95</TE>
<TE>   Sports quotes are ubiquitous. You see them everywhere--in
newspapers, magazines and locker rooms. They are sometimes humorous,
sometimes inspirational.</TE>
<TE>   Doren and Jones, collaborating on their fifth project, have
compiled a 376-page, 5 1/2-by-5 1/2-inch paperback book filled with
inspirational quotes--words that can uplift and motivate. There is
one quote per page.</TE>
<TE>   "For this book, we have selected quotes that will give you a
better understanding of the mindset required to win," they write.</TE>
<TE>   Some examples:</TE>
<TE>   "My mind is my biggest asset. I expect to win every tournament I
play"--Tiger Woods.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't win on emotion. You win on execution."--Tony Dungy.</TE>
<TE>   "Single-mindedness. I hate to say it because I don't think it's
the best thing for developing a person, but the
single-mindedness--just concentrating in that one area--that's what
it takes to be a champion"--Chris Evert.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times the expectations of you are so high that no matter
what you do you are never going to be able to live up to those
expectations. So you better go out and do the best you can and enjoy
it."--John Elway.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to look back on my life and say, 'What if?' Don't
worry about failure. Try it, and if it doesn't work out that's OK
because at least you tried."--Ann Meyers Drysdale.</TE>
<TE>   "All progress requires change. But not all change is
progress."--John Wooden.</TE>

<HD>Downer for Dodgers</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Their seventh defeat in nine games, a 5-4 loss to
Colorado, caps series of wasted opportunities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>And down the stretch they ... crawl? The Dodgers have 13 games left
in the regular season, including a critical four-game series against
the San Francisco Giants beginning tonight in Dodger Stadium, but
they are staggering--not steaming--toward the finish line.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers lost to Colorado, 5-4, before 26,011 in Coors Field
Sunday, their seventh loss in nine games and third in four games this
weekend against the Rockies, a 69-81 team that the Dodgers had
handled rather easily this season, going 10-3 against them in 13
games before this series.</LD>
<LD>   They caught a huge break when the Giants lost to the San Diego
Padres, 4-1, later Sunday, leaving the Dodgers only one game behind
San Francisco in the National League wild-card race, but they won't
carry any momentum into tonight's showdown series against their
rivals.</LD>
<TE>   "Absolutely, no question," second baseman Mark Grudzielanek said,
when asked if the Dodgers wasted a great opportunity in Denver. "We
probably expected to come here and win ... and it was a pathetic
performance. We went through the motions a bit and didn't take
advantage of the opportunities we had."</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Andy Ashby gave up a two-run home run to Brent Butler
in the second inning and a three-run homer to Todd Zeile in the
fifth, a 4 1/3-inning, seven-hit performance Ashby described as
"embarrassing, an absolute joke," and the Dodgers failed to
capitalize on a forearm injury that sidelined Colorado starter Denny
Neagle in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Karros grounded out with the bases loaded to end the third,
pinch-hitters Dave Hansen and Tyler Houston failed to deliver with
two on in the sixth despite working 3-and-1 counts against reliever
Todd Jones--Hansen struck out and Houston tapped weakly to
second--and Adrian Beltre flied to the wall in center with runners on
first and second to end the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers had one last shot, with leading hitter Shawn Green at
the plate, the bases empty and two outs in the ninth, but Green flied
to the wall in center against Rockies closer Jose Jimenez, who
recorded his 40th save.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy chose to accentuate the positive, saying the
Dodgers "didn't do anything to beat themselves," but the feeling
among some players was that they didn't do enough to beat the
Rockies. They made several critical pitching, fielding and
baserunning mistakes in Friday night's 5-4 loss, and they didn't come
up with enough clutch hits Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't keep losing games like this to a team that's playing
for practically nothing; we've got to rise above that," Grudzielanek
said. "We have to take advantage of every inning, every pitch, every
opportunity, because this is it. This is our season. We've got to do
everything possible to win games."</TE>
<TE>   If the Dodgers lacked a sense of urgency in Denver, they know
they'll have to find it in Los Angeles tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the teams you worry about, the guys who play the
spoiler role, and they set us back," left fielder Brian Jordan said.
"Now the pressure is on. We've got to play each game against San
Francisco as if it's our last game of the season."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers got off to a good start Sunday when Paul Lo Duca hit a
solo homer in the first, but after center fielder Marquis Grissom
lost Zeile's second-inning fly in the sun and the ball dropped for a
double, Butler homered off Ashby.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby walked Todd Helton in the fifth, gave up a single to Larry
Walker and grooved a 3-and-1 pitch to Zeile, who hit a line drive
over the wall in right for a 5-1 lead. The Dodgers crept back with
two in the sixth, as Green singled, Karros doubled and Beltre and
Grudzielanek hit RBI singles, and Grissom homered in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   But by then, too much damage had been done. Ashby, who missed his
last start because of a blister on the middle finger of his pitching
hand, has been rocked for 17 runs, 26 hits and 14 walks in 18 1/3
innings of his last four starts, three losses and a no-decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt fine; I was just inconsistent and couldn't throw strikes,"
Ashby (9-12) said. "That's pretty much the way it's been all year.
You can't pitch like that. It's only a matter of time until it
catches up to you."</TE>
<TE>   Could it be a matter of time before Tracy replaces Ashby with
Kevin Beirne in the rotation? Ashby is scheduled to start Friday
night against the Padres, and the Dodgers can't afford any more shaky
starts.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is well-taken," Tracy said, when asked if he's
considering a switch. "But what are the choices?"</TE>

<HD>Poetry in Motion</HD>
<DH>Double-play artistry was the reason for the rhyme that made

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>What if they had pitched or played in the outfield?</LD>
<LD>   Tinker to Evers to Chance.</LD>
<LD>   What if their team, the Chicago Cubs, had traded one of them away?</LD>
<TE>   Tinker to Evers to Chance.</TE>
<TE>   What if, heaven forbid, they had been born Gottfried or Williamson
or Deponty?</TE>
<TE>   Tinker to Evers to Chance.</TE>
<TE>   Any small glitch in the celestial apparatus could have mucked it
all up. But the planets were aligned, the fates in order, and a
century later we remember these three men as a double-play
combination for the ages.</TE>
<TE>   Tinker to Evers to Chance.</TE>
<TE>   It is doubtful that shortstop Joe Tinker, second baseman Johnny
Evers and first baseman Frank Chance played spectacularly enough over
the course of their careers to occupy such a place in baseball lore.
Though they helped the Cubs to the World Series four times in the
early 1900s, they never led the league in double plays or showed much
power at the plate. Only Chance came close to hitting .300 lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   What made them renowned was the fateful juxtaposition, the words
that skip slickly off the tongue in columnist Franklin P. Adams' 1910
poem, "Baseball's Sad Lexicon."</TE>
<TE>   These are the saddest of possible words:</TE>
<TE>   "Tinker to Evers to Chance."</TE>
<TE>   Trio of bear cubs and fleeter than birds,</TE>
<TE>   Tinker and Evers and Chance.</TE>
<TE>   Thoughtlessly pricking our gonfalon bubble,</TE>
<TE>   Making a Giant hit into a double--</TE>
<TE>   Words that are weighty with nothing but trouble:</TE>
<TE>   "Tinker to Evers to Chance."</TE>
<TE>   The poem, almost as familiar as "Casey at the Bat," set them on
hallowed ground.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's just say Mr. Adams had a lot to do with where they are,"
said Ed Hartig, a historian of the Cubs and member of the Society for
American Baseball Research. "If you go back and look at the numbers,
you'll see."</TE>
<TE>   The trio's debut in print was 100 years ago, on Sept. 16, 1902,
when the Chicago Tribune recorded their first double play in the box
score for a game against Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Chance was a veteran on the team, a strapping man known as "Husk."
Tinker had recently arrived along with Evers, a skinny kid called
"the Crab" because of the way he scrambled for grounders.</TE>
<TE>   They were joined by third baseman Harry Steinfeldt, talented but
doomed to be a trivia answer--Who completed the storied infield?--if
only because of his discordant last name.</TE>
<TE>   For a decade they played on the best teams in Cub history, forming
a solid defense behind pitcher Mordecai "Three Finger" Brown, joined
at the hip by that peculiar collaboration known as the double play.</TE>
<TE>   Funny thing is, they got along horribly.</TE>
<TE>   Chance was a tough guy who, legend has it, brawled with
heavyweight boxer "Gentleman" Jim Corbett in a Broadway cafe. As a
player-manager, he rode teammates mercilessly. Tinker and Evers were
smaller but no less feisty.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time something went wrong on the field, we would be at each
other and there would be a fight in the clubhouse after the game,"
Evers told Sport magazine in an article published in 1949. "[Tinker]
would rush at me and get me by the throat and I'd punch him in the
belly and try to cut him with my spikes."</TE>
<TE>   Even Steinfeldt got into the act, going after Tinker with a pair
of trainer's shears in the clubhouse. By 1908, Tinker and Evers had
stopped talking to each other.</TE>
<TE>   "But on the field, they always knew where the other guy would be,"
Hartig said. "That's what made them good."</TE>
<TE>   And if their statistics were less than dazzling, they had a knack
for coming up big against their rivals, the New York Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Late in the 1908 season, the Giants led in the standings and
appeared to have won a crucial game against the Cubs with a single to
center field in the bottom of the ninth. Amid the celebration, fans
charging onto the field, Evers screamed for his outfielder to throw
him the ball.</TE>
<TE>   According to one version of the story, Joe McGinnity of the Giants
got hold of the ball and tossed it into the bleachers. Evers came up
with a ball from somewhere else and stepped on second base, arguing
that a Giant baserunner, Fred Merkle, had failed to touch the bag. He
had tried a similar protest, with no success, two weeks earlier
against Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   "Evers actually used to sleep with the rule book under his
pillow," Hartig said. "He knew it cover to cover."</TE>
<TE>   This time the protest worked. The umpire called Merkle out and the
game was declared a 1-1 tie.</TE>
<TE>   By season's end, the Cubs caught their rivals and won a one-game
playoff, thanks in large part to Tinker's triple.</TE>
<TE>   Thus the poem's reference to the Giants and "pricking our gonfalon
bubble." Adams, also known as "F.P.A.", used the word gonfalon,
meaning flag or banner, to signify the pennant.</TE>
<TE>   Many assumed the writer, who worked for several New York papers
and was a panelist on the radio show "Information Please," was
sympathizing with his favorite team. In fact, he was a native
Chicagoan.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the only Cub rooter in the Polo Grounds press box," Adams
wrote in a personal letter on file at the Hall of Fame library. "I
wrote that piece because I wanted to get out to the game, and the
foreman of the composing room at the [New York Evening] Mail said I
needed eight lines to fill. The next day [a colleague] said that no
matter what I ever else wrote, I would be known as the guy who wrote
those eight lines. And they weren't much good, at that."</TE>
<TE>   Despite what Adams thought, the poem would be reprinted countless
times, even if the infield disbanded shortly thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   In 1912, Tinker went to Cincinnati, and Chance, who suffered
headaches from too many beanings, was released on waivers. Evers had
one more good season for the Cubs, then was traded to Boston, where
he helped the "Miracle Braves" win the 1914 World Series and was
named the National League's most valuable player.</TE>
<TE>   But no mortal distance could separate them. Tinker and Evers would
meet again in the late 1930s and, embracing, crying, settle their
rift. The three would enter the Hall of Fame together in 1946, long
after Chance had died from a bout of bronchial asthma.</TE>
<TE>   They would be forever bound by providence and the melody of words
on paper.</TE>
<TE>   Tinker to Evers to Chance.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>We don't normally break out the B-movie horror-flick imagery until
much later in the season--you know, the monopoly monster known as
"BCS" terrorizes villagers and squashes dreams of underdog, non-BCS
college town kids across America.</LD>
<LD>   Well, the kill came earlier than expected this year, before the
official end of summer.</LD>
<LD>   Bummer.</LD>
<TE>   Once again, the sign hanging on the BCS door reads: Members Only.</TE>
<TE>   What it also means to the 54 major college schools not affiliated
with the six-conference, 63-school bowl championship series: Abandon
all hope, ye who enter here.</TE>
<TE>   To wit, the chances of a non-BCS school landing in one of four
lucrative BCS bowls are now clinically dead in the wake of warmed
over-the-weekend losses suffered by Marshall (Mid-American) and
Brigham Young (Mountain West). Louisville, a preseason top-25
prospect from Conference USA, tossed in its cards after losing its
opener and Colorado State (Mountain West) skidded out with that UCLA
loss.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks for playing our game, though.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force (Mountain West) and Southern Mississippi (Conference
USA) remain undefeated in their conferences but have no hope in
Hattiesburg of rising into the BCS top six.</TE>
<TE>   Utah of the Mountain West was 2-0 and had Arizona of the Pacific
10 on the ropes Saturday before an official negated the possible
game-winning touchdown on a call Ute Coach Ron McBride called the
worst he'd seen in 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   (Time out here to vent your BCS conspiracy theories.)</TE>
<TE>   Too bad. It's good sport when schools such as Fresno State and
Brigham Young rattle royal jewelry and lead grass-root cries for more
inclusion in the BCS Boys Club.</TE>
<TE>   Conspicuously missing in college football are the little-school
Gonzaga stories, the type that dominate syrupy CBS montages at the
NCAA basketball tournament.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't work that way in football. The champions of the six
major conferences earn automatic bids to eight berths in big-money
BCS bowls.</TE>
<TE>   A non-BCS school can earn one of two at-large bids if it finishes
ranked sixth or higher in the final BCS rankings.</TE>
<TE>   For what it's worth, that hasn't happened in the four-year history
of the BCS, and it won't happen in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   The only chance non-BCS schools have</TE>
<TE>   is to take on, and defeat, BCS schools, usually</TE>
<TE>   on the road, and work up toward the glass</TE>
<TE>   ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Fresno State knocked off Colorado, Oregon State and
Wisconsin to open the season but lost its BCS bid--immediately and
abruptly--after a midseason defeat to Boise State.</TE>
<TE>   All 25 schools in this week's Associated Press writers' poll are
from BCS conferences, and 24 of the top 25 spots in the coaches' poll
are occupied by BCS schools, Colorado State the exception at No. 25.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall was this year's BCS plaything, premiering at No. 19 in
the preseason poll before getting the trap-door treatment after last
Thursday night's loss to Virginia Tech.</TE>
<TE>   This year, like the last, the BCS has snuffed out hope like a boot
heel to a cigarette butt.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing personal though, just business.</TE>
<TE>   Weekend Wrap</TE>
<TE>   Texas El Paso Coach Gary Nord publicly had no problem with
Oklahoma scoring its last touchdown in a 68-0 romp on a
fourth-quarter scoring pass, but Miner receiver Terrance Minor told
the El Paso Times, "I felt like roadkill when they did that."</TE>
<TE>   It's a shame former USC Trojan rah-rah assistant Marv Goux didn't
live long enough to see the brewing renaissance of USC and Notre Dame
football. The last time the schools started out 2-0 (Trojans) and 3-0
(Fighting Irish) the same year was 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe one of college football's most storied--but lately grossly
overrated--rivalries will mean something again when the teams meet
Nov. 30 at the Coliseum. If you're thinking way ahead, the last time
the schools met as No.1 vs. No. 2 was 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of overrated.... The Big 12 began the season touted as
the cut-above conference, with four schools--Oklahoma, Texas,
Colorado and Nebraska--ranked in the top 10, but it's time for a
reassessment. Colorado is stuck in the gate again at 1-2, and
Nebraska players are still picking corn out of ear holes after
Saturday's lopsided loss at Penn State.</TE>
<TE>   The Pac-10, meanwhile, went 7-1 over the weekend and raised its
nonconference mark to 21-4. USC and California defeated ranked teams
on the road, and UCLA scored a significant road victory at Oklahoma
State. The only loser was Washington State, which held a 7-6 lead at
No. 6 Ohio State before losing, 25-7.</TE>
<TE>   With 3-0 Cal no longer a dopey doormat, the Pac-10 has to be
considered the best top-to-bottom conference through Sept. 14, but
that hurts the league's chances of pushing an undefeated team through
to the BCS national title game.</TE>
<TE>   Here is our ranking, best to worst, on the conferences with the
best chances of landing a team in the Jan. 3 Fiesta Bowl:</TE>
<TE>   Big 12 (Oklahoma, Texas), Big East (Miami, Virginia Tech),
Atlantic Coast (Florida State), Southeastern (Tennessee, Georgia),
Big Ten (Ohio State), Pac-10 (USC, Oregon).</TE>
<TE>   This weekend's exit-poll question: Is Ohio State a legitimate
national title threat?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Yes, based on what we saw Saturday against Washington
State, with the caveat always being the Big Ten has not crowned a
consensus national champion since 1968. That championship team was
... Ohio State. This Buckeye team has the look of one of coach Woody
Hayes' vintage teams. It was Hayes who said three things can happen
when you pass, two of them bad. So guess what? Trailing Washington
State by a point at the half, Ohio State abandoned the pass and gave
freshman tailback Maurice Clarett 20 second-half carries in a 25-7
victory. Clarett finished with 230 yards in 31 carries.</TE>
<TE>   It was also Hayes who said, "Freshmen may revolutionize college
football."</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State has a clear path to an undefeated regular season, with
only three toss-up games left: At Wisconsin on Oct. 19, home against
Penn State on Oct. 26 and home against Michigan on Nov. 23.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Notre Dame, attempting to return to its glory days, nearly returned
to the top 10.</LD>
<LD>   With a 25-23 victory over Michigan, the Fighting Irish (3-0)
climbed eight spots to No. 12 in the Associated Press Top 25 poll
released Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Notre Dame, under new Coach Tyrone Willingham, last made AP's top
10 at No. 10 in the 2000 final poll of the regular season. Then came
the 41-9 Fiesta Bowl loss to Oregon State, and the Irish finished No.
15.</LD>
<TE>   While the top six teams remained unchanged from last week--Miami
was a near unanimous choice at No. 1--the Irish led a reshuffling of
the rest of the Top 25.</TE>
<TE>   USC defeated Colorado, 40-3, Saturday and moved up six places to
No. 11. Penn State, a 40-7 winner over Nebraska, returned to the poll
at No. 15.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA moved from No. 23 to 20.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Penn State, newcomers this week are California at No. 23,
Iowa State at No. 21 and Kansas State at No. 25.</TE>
<TE>   There were quite a few tumbles too. Michigan, No. 7 last week,
dropped to No. 14; Nebraska, eighth a week ago, fell to No. 18.
Michigan State, No. 18 last week, dropped out of the poll.</TE>
<TE>   Also dropping out were Marshall, Colorado and Colorado State.
Marshall lost to Virginia Tech, 47-21, last Thursday night. The
Hokies moved up from 11th to seventh this week.</TE>
<TE>   Miami received 68 of the 74 first-place votes and 1,844 points
from the sportswriters and broadcasters on the AP panel.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As far as Utah Coach Ron McBride is concerned, his team did not
lose to Arizona on Saturday night in Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   The scoreboard read "Arizona 23, Utah 17" but McBride knows his
team scored the game-winning touchdown in the final seconds, only to
have it taken away.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a touchdown. Game's over. Period," McBride said. "It's an
impossible call to miss. Everybody in the stadium saw it. Everybody
on TV saw it. That's embarrassing."</TE>
<TE>   The Utes (2-1) trailed, 23-7, early in the third quarter, but
after Bryan Barreson kicked a 53-yard field goal with 4:11 left,
Arizona led, 23-17.</TE>
<TE>   Utah mounted one final drive from its own 28-yard line. On second
and 10 from the Arizona 12, wide receiver Josh Lyman broke open over
the middle and made a diving catch of Lance Rice's pass as he slid
out of the back of the end zone. The official standing on the line a
few feet away ruled the catch was not good.</TE>
<TE>   But television replays showed that Lyman's knee came down at least
a foot inside the end zone.</TE>

<HD>Raiders Pass It On Against Steelers</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Following Patriot ways, Gannon completes 43
of 64 passes in 30-17 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>This might shock the NFL world, but the Oakland Raiders were being
something less than honest last week when asked about their strategy
for playing Pittsburgh.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, they fibbed, sandbagged, pulled off an immaculate deception.
They said they would stick to their grind-it-out game plan, not rely
on the no-huddle, pass-at-all-costs style that allowed New England to
pick apart the Steelers in the opener.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the Raiders came out and threw almost every down Sunday.
Threw so many times that Jerry Rice had 10 receptions by halftime.
Threw so many times they set an NFL record for completions in a
non-overtime game (43).</LD>
<TE>   "The plan going in was to throw," said Raider Coach Bill Callahan,
his voice quavering with emotion after the 30-17 victory. "Always
was, always has been."</TE>
<TE>   That's the same Callahan who earlier in the week told reporters:
"We have six [running backs] here that we call the committee. If we
went to a no-back, I think there would be a few people knocking on my
door."</TE>
<TE>   Well, fellas, form a single-file line.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders (2-0) opened the game with an empty backfield and
frequently used similar formations throughout. It's as if they
Xeroxed the game plan of the Patriots, who peppered the Steelers with
passes in the opener, once throwing 25 in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "We've created a situation here," said Pittsburgh Coach Bill
Cowher, whose 0-2 team has 20 returning starters from the squad that
reached the AFC championship game last season. "And until we can stop
it, we're going to see it. I admit, I did not think they'd come out
and just wing it. I thought they'd run the ball, because they can.
We've got to get these things rectified or it's going to be a long
year."</TE>
<TE>   Out of 87 plays, the Raiders ran 70 pass plays--which includes the
five times Rich Gannon was sacked and a pass by Terry Kirby. They ran
the no-huddle offense throughout the first half, convening only a few
times for a breather, and Gannon set team records for attempts (64)
and completions. He also threw for 403 yards</TE>
<TE>   "He should be icing his arm," joked Rice, who finished with 11
catches for 94 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland offensive tackle Lincoln Kennedy, who is listed at 335
pounds but looks even bigger, plopped down in a chair in front of his
locker a half-hour after the game and was still winded.</TE>
<TE>   "Exhausted," he said, shaking his head. "That's about all I can
say."</TE>
<TE>   Then, he said more. He never pass-blocked so much in his life.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked at the stats at halftime, and we had run 49 plays," he
said. "That's more than some teams run in a whole game."</TE>
<TE>   And it could have been even uglier for the Steelers. Twice, the
Raiders were on the verge of scoring and linebacker Joey Porter came
through for Pittsburgh. He intercepted two passes at the Steeler
one-yard line, returning one of them 84 yards. That return came late
in the third quarter and not only reinvigorated a stagnant Heinz
Field crowd but set up a touchdown for the Steelers, who trimmed the
Oakland lead to 20-17.</TE>
<TE>   But the Raiders snatched the momentum right back when Kirby
returned the ensuing kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown on the first
play of the fourth quarter. It was the third kickoff return for a
touchdown in Kirby's career, and it was just what the Raiders needed
to slam the door. They picked up a 27-yard field goal from Sebastian
Janikowski near the end, but that was just icing. By that time, most
of the 62,260 spectators were streaming toward the exits.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we're not a very good football team," Cowher said.
"And that's probably an obvious statement."</TE>
<TE>   Crippling to the Steelers was their inability to stop the Raiders
on third down. Oakland converted 12 of 20 such situations, answering
the call five times on one touchdown drive.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to find a way to help those DBs out," Pittsburgh
defensive end Aaron Smith said. "We can't expect them to hold these
guys up. It's a long time, and it's hard to cover without anybody
getting pressure on the quarterback."</TE>
<TE>   Now, there's plenty of pressure on Kordell Stewart. Although he
didn't look as sloppy as he did against New England, Stewart never
got on track. By the third quarter, fans were booing him and the rest
of the offense. And Jerome Bettis disappeared for long stretches,
getting only 41 yards in 10 carries.</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers fumbled four times, and, rubbing a little salt in
that wound, three of those were recovered by former Pittsburgh star
Rod Woodson, now Oakland's starting free safety. Pittsburgh converted
four of 10 third-down attempts against a Raider defense that has nine
new starters.</TE>

<HD>Glaus' Big Night Is Made to Order</HD>
<DH>Angels: Batting second in lineup, he hits three homers in
rout of Texas. Anaheim sets win record and is alone in first place.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laughter erupted in the Angel clubhouse Sunday when a makeshift
lineup was posted that listed third baseman Troy Glaus batting
second.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Mike Scioscia shuffled the batting order because of
injuries and illness, putting the slugger in line for some
good-natured ribbing from teammates about his responsibility to
advance runners by "doing the little things."</LD>
<LD>   "That," Glaus said, "wasn't going to happen."</LD>
<TE>   Apparently not.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus broke the rules for a No. 2 hitter, but the Angels weren't
complaining after he hit three home runs and drove in six runs to
power a 13-4 victory over the Texas Rangers as the club took sole
possession of first place in the American League West.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been waiting for him to come alive," said Manager Mike
Scioscia, whose club sent 10 batters to the plate in racing to a 5-0
lead in the first inning. "He's shown glimpses of it, and tonight he
gave us a big lift with the way he swung the bat.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about Troy is, you look around and say, 'Well, he's
struggled at this time, or he's struggled at that time.' But he still
has over 100 RBI, which is really what his role on this club is."</TE>
<TE>   Glaus accounted for more than 1,200 feet of homers with his 25th,
26th and 27th of the season. He led off the fifth with a shot to
center against Texas starter Kenny Rogers, homered to left with one
on in the seventh against Jay Powell and to left-center against Juan
Alvarez with two on in the eighth, giving him at least 100 runs
batted in (101) for the third straight season. The Angels (94-55)
swept the last-place Rangers (69-80) in the three-game series,
winning their sixth in a row and 16th of 17.</TE>
<TE>   They established a team single-season record for victories,
breaking the mark set by the 1982 West championship club. The Angels
moved a franchise-best 39 games above .500 on the day the Oakland
Athletics lost to the Seattle Mariners and dropped out of the
first-place tie the clubs had been in since Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In typical fashion, the stoic Glaus downplayed his big night. But
he seemed pleased about the Angels' continued success.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't really matter [about his homers]," said Glaus, who
scored four runs. "We won the game. That's all we needed to do."</TE>
<TE>   Starter Ramon Ortiz (14-9) pitched seven innings despite flu-like
symptoms, giving up four runs in what Scioscia described as "a real
good effort" under the circumstances. Rogers (13-8) and the rest of
the Rangers' staff all pitched as if they were sick.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus picked up the slack with sparkplug leadoff batter David
Eckstein (hip flexor), top run producer Garret Anderson (strained
right hamstring) and the emerging Adam Kennedy (flu) sidelined. He
hit three homers in a game for the first time and matched his career
high for RBIs in a game. He became the 10th Angel to hit three homers
in a game, becoming the first since Dave Winfield did it April 13,
1991, against the Minnesota Twins at the Metrodome.</TE>
<TE>   Doug DeCinces is the only other Angel third baseman to hit at
least three homers in a game, doing it twice in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have not been alone atop the division this late in a
season since holding a one-game advantage over the Rangers on Sept.
15, 1998, in their 150th game. The entire cast has contributed to the
Angels' stunning ascent after the worst start in franchise history
(6-14), and Glaus punctuated the arrival, taking it to a new plateau.</TE>
<TE>   "He did a great job, every one of those was big, and in the two
hole of all places," said Scott Spiezio, who followed Glaus' homer in
the fifth with his 11th homer to give the Angels a 7-3 lead. "People
were giving him a hard time before the game, asking him if he was
going to bunt guys over and things like that. I guess he didn't need
to tonight."</TE>

<LD>Chone Figgins got his first big league hit, a sharp slash to right
field, and Angel fans gave the speedster who had, until now, done
nothing but pinch-run for the Angels, a standing ovation.</LD>
<LD>   Matt Higgins, a 12-year-old second baseman from Lancaster, was one
of the cheering fans. He came to the game with his parents and sister
because, Matt says, "I like the Angels. They don't have any big
shots."</LD>
<LD>   After beating Texas, 13-4, Monday, this team with no big shots has
94 wins and sole possession of first place in the American League
West.</LD>
<TE>   Troy Glaus, who might be a big shot someday, had three home runs
and made a crowd-ordered curtain call after No. 3 in the bottom of
the eighth. While the smoke from the fireworks was still clearing,
Scott Spiezio hit a sharp ground ball to shortstop. The Angels were
leading by nine runs, and, frankly, most of the paying customers were
waiting for the game to end so they could bust loose with some of
that first-place mojo they've had bottled up for so long.</TE>
<TE>   But Spiezio ran hard from the moment his bat hit the ball. Unless
the ball was bobbled, Spiezio, who is no Tim Montgomery when it comes
to dashes, was not going to be safe at first. He wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   But when you're not a big shot you always run hard.</TE>
<TE>   When you're the son of not a big shot, as Spiezio is, you have a
father who hits you ground balls and a mother that is your
double-play partner. You have two grandmothers who shag fly balls in
the outfield for you and two older sisters, fine tennis players, who
let you field, bare-handed, their serves. And you have an empty
basement perfect in which to hit golf balls, which you try to field
before the ball takes out your eye or breaks your jaw.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio has played first base, second base, third base, right
field and left field for the Angels. He'd play shortstop too, if
asked. "My dad made me field all the positions and be a
switch-hitter," Spiezio says.</TE>
<TE>   His dad, Ed, was a journeyman, a bench filler, a major leaguer,
yes, but one who hung on because he would do anything.</TE>
<TE>   Ed decided Scott would be the same.</TE>
<TE>   In his last 236 games at first base, he has committed only four
errors.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of great fielders playing first base, but in my
mind Scott deserves to win the Gold Glove this year. His play at
first has been phenomenal. What an incredible first baseman he's
become," Manager Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   "We all knew Spieze had the glove if he just got the chance to
play every day," center fielder Darin Erstad said.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't take much to figure that out. You just had to watch him
field."</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio has scored 16 runs in Anaheim's last 15 games. On this
home stand, he has scored eight runs, driven in eight and has made
the hard plays at first base seem easy.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Angels head off on a 10-game trip tied with the Yankees
for the best record in the American League--94-55. That's the most
wins ever for an Angel team in a season.</TE>
<TE>   Not bad for a team of not big shots.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got guys who could be big shots," Spiezio says.</TE>
<TE>   "Troy Glaus, Garret Anderson, Darin Erstad, Troy Percival, Tim
Salmon. Part of being a big shot is getting seen and noticed and
we're kind of lost out here sometimes. If people paid attention to us
more, maybe we'd have some big shots. But we almost do."</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio didn't mention himself. He stands in front of his locker,
getting ready to take a plane to Oakland where he and the other not
big shots will play the A's four more times, four games that will go
far in deciding who wins the AL West. Spiezio has painted an
Angel-red stripe on his chin hair and he giggles, his face turning
Angel-red, when the stripe is commented upon.</TE>
<TE>   "I just thought it would be kind of cool," Spiezio says. "I didn't
do it to get noticed."</TE>
<TE>   In 141 games, Spiezio is batting .287 with 75 runs and 78 RBIs.
He's hitting .360 as a righty and .252 as a lefty.</TE>
<TE>   He has 32 doubles and 11 homers. In his last seven games, Spiezio
is hitting .360, which shows a guy who is getting stronger, more
confident, more reliable.</TE>
<TE>   He played third base twice last week when Glaus jammed his
fingers.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of 2001, the Angels were busy trying out Wally
Joyner and Larry Barnes at first base. If Erstad knew that Spiezio
would be this great a first baseman, he wasn't sharing that
information with anybody else back then.</TE>
<TE>   "I just knew that if I ever got the chance," Spiezio says, "if I
ever got to play somewhere, anywhere, full-time, that I'd be able to
do what I'm doing."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia says Spiezio is such a good fielder because he has
"great, soft hands and a good arm."</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio says it's because his father made him become a great
fielder.</TE>
<TE>   "From the time I was 3 years old," Spiezio says, "I was taking
ground balls."</TE>
<TE>   He's still taking them. Mom doesn't complete the double play the
way she used to, Spiezio says, but his dad can still hit fungoes and
make sure Scott is doing it right. It being everything. That's the
way it is with this not a big shots bunch.</TE>
<TE>   Even the ones in first place.</TE>

<LD>Not long after former Boston Red Sox slugger Mo Vaughn signed a
six-year, $80-million contract with the Anaheim Angels for the 1999
baseball season, the Connecticut native began pining for the
Northeast.</LD>
<LD>   Southern California fans were too laid-back, Vaughn said. They
lacked that intense, live-and-die-with-the-home-team attitude that so
motivates players in Boston's Fenway Park and New York's Yankee
Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   After three years in what seemed like baseball purgatory to him,
Vaughn got his wish when the Angels traded him last winter to the New
York Mets, who have been one of baseball's biggest disappointments
this season and are in last place in the National League East.</LD>
<TE>   In Vaughn's wake, Southern California fans are in baseball heaven.
The Angels and the Los Angeles Dodgers have never made the playoffs
in the same season, and the success of the teams has Southern
California baseball fans dreaming of a Freeway World Series in
October.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers and San Francisco Giants will resume one of baseball's
most bitter rivalries in nearly sold-out Dodger Stadium tonight when
they begin a four-game series that could determine the NL's wild-card
team. The Dodgers trail the Giants by one game with 13 games left.</TE>
<TE>   And the Angels, enjoying what could be their finest season,
tonight will open a four-game series against the Oakland Athletics in
Network Associates Coliseum that could determine the American League
West championship. The Angels hold a one-game lead over the A's after
Sunday's games. They each have 13 games remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "What was Mo doing? Was he talking in his sleep, or what?" said
Tom Lasorda, the Dodgers' senior vice president and their manager
from 1976 to '96. "How can Mo make statements like that? Without a
doubt, he's off-base, because what we have going on right now is
tremendous. Look at the Giants, A's, us and the Angels. That's four
teams playing tremendous baseball. This is what we've always wished
for."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in 1958, have
not reached the playoffs since 1996, and they have not won a
postseason game since winning the World Series in 1988. The Angels,
born in 1961, have not made the playoffs since 1986, when they were
one strike away from going to the World Series before their playoff
collapse against the Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   This season, both teams had to sweat out the possibility of their
dream seasons being wiped out by a players' strike that was averted
with an eleventh-hour contract agreement Aug. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Now fans this week will get two Northern California vs. Southern
California showdowns.</TE>
<TE>   For the Angels and A's, this could be the series to ignite a
rather tepid rivalry. Though they have played in the same division
for decades, the teams have never gone head-to-head in the waning
days of a season with a title at stake.</TE>
<TE>   "This September battle with the Angels is totally new for us," A's
fan and sheet metal shop owner Jerry Slakey said in Oakland. "They
haven't been competitive for years. We've been looking north to
Seattle and east to New York. But now that rivalry is here, that's
for sure."</TE>
<TE>   And if last week's four-game series between the teams in Anaheim
is any indication, the rivalry is heating up. The Angels won three of
four from the A's, two in dramatic, come-from-behind fashion, before
some of the largest and most emotionally charged crowds in recent
Edison Field history.</TE>
<TE>   For the Dodgers and Giants, who played more than 60 years in New
York before moving West in 1958, this is merely the latest chapter in
a long and storied rivalry that has been part mystery, part thriller
and, as legend has it, part murder-she-wrote.</TE>
<TE>   According to Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully, who grew up in
the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, two men in a Brooklyn
bar in the 1930s got into such a heated argument about the Dodgers
and Giants that one went home, got a gun, returned to the bar and
shot the other.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how it was back then," said Scully, the voice of the
Dodgers for 53 years. "The rivalry was bigger than life."</TE>
<TE>   There's a do-or-die feeling about this week's series too. While a
division title is on the line in the Oakland-Anaheim series, both
teams are virtually assured of making the playoffs. Still, the A's
expect more than 120,000 fans for four games.</TE>
<TE>   But there's more at stake for the Dodgers and Giants, because the
World Series champion Arizona Diamondbacks are on their way to
winning the NL West title, leaving L.A. and San Francisco to fight it
out for the wild-card playoff berth. The Houston Astros, 4 1/2 games
behind the Dodgers, are also in the wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   "Four games against the Giants, we're both trying to get to the
postseason, that's about as close as you're going to come to a
playoff game," Dodger outfielder Marquis Grissom said. "The stadium
will be rocking, so we've got to put on a show."</TE>
<TE>   Too bad it wasn't the season's final episode. Each team will have
nine games remaining against other opponents after this series.</TE>
<TE>   "I would love it," Scully said, "if it went down to the last day
of the season."</TE>
<TE>   That wouldn't be a first.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants and Dodgers extended the 1951 season to the last pitch
of the last inning of the last game of a three-game playoff to
determine the NL champion, when Bobby Thomson hit the "shot heard
'round the world," a dramatic three-run home run in the bottom of the
ninth that gave the Giants a 5-4 pennant-clinching win over the
Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   This was the defining moment of the Dodger-Giant rivalry, the one
that gave birth to broadcaster Russ Hodges' famous call, "The Giants
win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant!"</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good rivalry," said Dodger outfielder Brian Jordan, who
had beer dumped on him in San Francisco's Pacific Bell Park in April.
"You can definitely feel the energy when you play those guys."</TE>
<TE>   Much of that energy is supplied by the fans.</TE>
<TE>   "We're fighting the Civil War all over again," said Giant fan and
retired restaurant owner James Woo. "And like it did before, the
North is going to win again."</TE>
<TE>   Woo sat in a Chinese restaurant in San Francisco on Saturday night
with his wife, Annie, and daughter Doris, a transistor radio at their
table tuned to the Giant game against San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the best time of year," Doris Woo said. "What could be
better than our two local teams winning the pennant and beating
Southern California at the same time? Nothing, that's what."</TE>
<TE>   Standing outside their local Peet's coffee shop Sunday, a
half-dozen San Franciscans sipped their coffee and talked baseball.</TE>
<TE>   David Arrick said no matter what time of season, it's always
critical to beat L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "Even when the Giants lose, you can gain some small satisfaction
by checking the box scores to see that the Dodgers lost as well," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger fans are keyed up for the showdown as well.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Bradley of Long Beach was one of several hundred fans who
showed up at the Dodger ticket office at 8:30 a.m. Saturday to buy
division series playoff tickets. Saturday afternoon, he was back to
buy tickets for the Giant-Dodger series.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be a fun week for baseball," he said. "The Dodgers
should be at the top of their game. We'll get four good games."</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Olea, 34, a lab technician from Los Angeles, was at Dodger
Stadium on Saturday to purchase tickets to see the Dodgers play the
Giants on Tuesday. "It's more than a rivalry," he said. "It's the
Giants and the Dodgers."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels don't have a hated rival like the Dodgers do, but that
may change with more seasons like this.</TE>
<TE>   The A's reeled off 20 consecutive wins from Aug. 13 to Sept. 4,
but the Angels, far deeper and more resilient than past team
contenders, won 21 of 27 from Aug. 10 to Sept. 8 to stay within
striking distance.</TE>
<TE>   Then, with Edison Field awash in a sea of red--the new team color
this season--the Angels won three of four from the A's last week,
pulling even with Oakland in the standings and obliterating those
demons of Septembers past, when the Angels usually faded--and
sometimes collapsed--down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got a team coming off a 20-game winning streak and the
Angels keeping pace," said Delany Salmon, a 26-year-old fan from
Fontana who is no relation to Angel right fielder Tim Salmon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's wonderful excitement here in the ballpark. You can feel it
when you're sitting in your seat and that crowd is roaring in the
first inning in the first at-bat. It just gives you chills."</TE>
<TE>   Barry Kennedy, a 56-year-old Santa Ana resident whose 81-year-old
mother, Eloise, has been an Angel season-ticket holder since 1967,
attended Wednesday night's 6-5 comeback victory over Oakland and said
it might have been the most exciting game at Edison Field in three
years.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a comeback and you had the 10th man on the field, the
fans, from about the fourth inning on," Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   "The seed of doubt has to be planted in [the Oakland players'
heads] now that the Angels aren't going to be a pushover."</TE>
<TE>   The job--for the Dodgers, Angels, Giants and A's--resumes tonight.</TE>

<HD>Ware's Best Position Is a Secondary Issue</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>STILLWATER, Okla.</DL>
<LD>Ground control to UCLA coaches: No need to descend from the
stratosphere quite yet. Enjoy the 38-24 victory over Oklahoma State
that solidified your team's place in the top 25.</LD>
<LD>   But when you get back to work, don't ignore a primary issue
involving the secondary.</LD>
<LD>   It's not a problem so much as a quandary. What is the best
position for one of the best Bruin players?</LD>
<TE>   Should Matt Ware remain at free safety or return to cornerback,
where he was a freshman All-American last season?</TE>
<TE>   "We're always evaluating," defensive coordinator Phil Snow said.
"We're opening the season with Matt at safety, that's where we think
he fits best. He's always capable of playing cornerback, that's a
given."</TE>
<TE>   No doubt, Ware is a plus at either spot. But he has been injured
in both games he has played at free safety, a position that requires
more contact than cornerback.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, he sprained his right ankle--albeit on a kickoff--and
sat out the second half. In the opener against Colorado State, he sat
out several series after getting banged up.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor is the rapid development of safeties Ben Emanuel
and Jarrad Page, who have proved they belong on the field.</TE>
<TE>   Emanuel, the starting strong safety, moved to free safety when
Ware was injured Saturday and made a key play, intercepting a pass
with 3:41 to play that stopped Oklahoma State's last drive.</TE>
<TE>   He also picked off a pass in the first half playing strong safety
and had six tackles.</TE>
<TE>   "I like free and I like strong," Emanuel said. "I've learned both
positions and feel comfortable wherever they put me."</TE>
<TE>   Page, a freshman who spurned a $700,000 offer from the Milwaukee
Brewers this summer, played strong safety when Emanuel replaced Ware
and turned in his second impressive performance, making two tackles
and breaking up a pass.</TE>
<TE>   The third--and most delicate--consideration is recognizing that
short cornerbacks Ricky Manning (5 feet 9), Joe Hunter (5-11) and
Matt Clark (5-9) are vulnerable to tall receivers.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State's 6-2 Rashaun Woods gave all three Bruin corners
fits, making seven catches for 143 yards. His counterpart, 6-0 John
Lewis, had seven catches for 113 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Ware is 6-3 and proved last season he can stay with rangy
receivers.</TE>
<TE>   "I like free safety a lot," Ware said. "That's where I want to
play right now. I also liked cornerback a lot. That might be where I
play later on. I just want to play and let the coaches decide the
other stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Ware moved to free safety to fill the void left by Marques
Anderson, a hard-hitting senior last season now with the Green Bay
Packers. Snow signed off on the switch only after becoming convinced
that Hunter and Clark could handle the corner spot opposite Manning,
a two-time All-Pacific 10 Conference pick.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter, a senior, was in the doghouse a year ago because he ran
track instead of participating in spring practice. But he dedicated
himself last spring and is playing well.</TE>
<TE>   Clark, a sophomore who is Ware's cousin, had a strong fall camp as
well, making Ware's move to safety logical.</TE>
<TE>   But the development of Page and Emanuel has given Snow an
abundance of quality defensive backs. How best to align them might be
the most important adjustment the Bruins make as they prepare for the
potent Pac-10 passing attacks they will face down the road.</TE>

<LD>USC moved up six spots to No. 11 in the Associated Press top 25 poll
Sunday, a fitting number for a team that already features 11 players
with pass receptions this season.</LD>
<LD>   Quarterback Carson Palmer, who threw to eight receivers in a
season-opening victory over Auburn, connected with seven during
Saturday's 40-3 rout of Colorado.</LD>
<LD>   Another solid performance from the expanding receiving corps will
be needed this week when the Trojans (2-0) play No. 25 Kansas State
(3-0) at Manhattan, Kan. A victory could propel USC into the top 10
for the first time since Sept. 30, 2000, when the Trojans were ranked
No. 8 before losing at Oregon State.</LD>
<TE>   "We have a lot of guys we can throw the football to, and Carson is
comfortable mixing it up," USC Coach Pete Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, who has completed 45 of 62 passes for 546 yards and two
touchdowns this season, said he is benefiting from a year of
experience running coordinator Norm Chow's offense and an offensive
line that did not allow a sack against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting great protection and that makes it a lot easier,"
said Palmer, who was sacked 36 times last season.</TE>
<TE>   USC displayed its varied threats while handing the Buffaloes their
worst defeat since a 52-7 loss at Nebraska in 1992, and their worst
defeat at home since a 59-20 loss to Missouri in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Junior flanker Keary Colbert caught four passes for 52 yards,
including consecutive receptions of 17 an 21 yards during the
Trojans' first possession. It was an 80-yard drive that ended with
running back Malaefou MacKenzie breaking four tackles to complete a
32-yard touchdown pass play.</TE>
<TE>   MacKenzie, who had six receptions for 110 yards against Auburn,
finished with two catches for 38 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Senior wide receiver Kareem Kelly caught four passes for 36 yards
and moved into a tie with Keyshawn Johnson for second place on USC's
career list with 168 receptions. Johnnie Morton caught a record 201
passes from 1990 to '93.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of great players, so opposing teams cannot
concentrate on one guy," said Kelly, who tied John Jackson's school
record with receptions in 37 consecutive games. "The young guys are
proving that they can make plays."</TE>
<TE>   Emerging freshman standout Mike Williams made a game-high seven
receptions for 90 yards, but the Trojans failed to execute a play
that could become Williams' signature.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through the first quarter, USC had a first down at the
Colorado 14. The Trojans tried to isolate the 6-foot-5 Williams
against a smaller defensive back in the corner of the end zone, but
Williams did not run a smooth route and was unable to get his footing
before Palmer overthrew him.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll was especially happy with the play of 6-8 sophomore tight
end Gregg Guenther, who dropped a pass in the opener against Auburn.
Guenther made his the first catch of his career on a five-yard play
in the first quarter and caught consecutive passes of four and 12
yards during an 80-yard scoring drive that gave the Trojans a 27-3
lead in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman running back Hershel Dennis also caught his first pass--a
four-yard gain in the first quarter--and rushed for 32 yards in five
carries.</TE>
<TE>   Senior fullback Chad Pierson, who sat out the opener because of a
hamstring strain, also caught a pass.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior guard Zach Wilson, who strained his left foot in training
camp and missed the opener, played a few series against Colorado.
Freshman Fred Matua, recovering from a bruised knee, did not. Both
players will push Eric Torres for playing time this week.... Carroll
said freshman Winston Justice will remain the starting right tackle
based on his performance against Colorado.... Colorado's 61 yards of
total offense were the fewest given up by USC since the Trojans gave
up 43 against Oregon State in 1952. Colorado's four first downs were
the fewest given up by USC since 1963, also against Colorado....
Carroll celebrated his 51st birthday Sunday.</TE>

<HD>TV Ads Will Press Hollywood Secession</HD>
<DH>Election: A pair of commercials running on Adelphia cable
channels focus on key issues identified in survey: love of diversity
and dislike of filthy streets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NITA LELYVELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood secession leaders said they will launch two 30-second
advertisements on cable television today, one emphasizing the
diversity of the Hollywood city council candidates, the other the gap
between the area's glamorous image and its trash-strewn streets.</LD>
<LD>   The ads, which will run on Adelphia cable channels in Hollywood,
mark the start of a five-week media campaign that could feature as
many as eight different commercials, secessionists say.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Wilczynski, regional vice president of Adelphia, confirmed
that the campaign had purchased time, but would not divulge the cost
or the size of the buy.</LD>
<TE>   Bob Jimenez, a consultant for the secession campaign, said it has
contracted for 5,207 airings in Hollywood and nearby areas, such as
the south San Fernando Valley and Silver Lake, which share cable
systems with Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to say how much the campaign is spending. Most
showings will cost less than $100 each, said Adelphia's Wilczynski.
They will appear on a range of cable channels, including ESPN,
Lifetime and CNBC.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the money for the spots came from Hollywood secession
leader Gene La Pietra, who already has spent $1 million on the
campaign and has vowed to spend "whatever it takes" to win. But La
Pietra took pains to point out that his funds were no match for the
millions that anti-secessionists, led by Mayor James K. Hahn, would
soon start spending on citywide advertising. Secessionists say they
probably can't afford to air ads across Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Secession measures for Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley will
appear on the Nov. 5 ballot. To win, they need majority votes in
their own areas and in Los Angeles as a whole. The Valley campaign
has yet to start advertising.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the best way to reach voters," said Kam Kuwata, Hahn's
strategist, when told of the Hollywood campaign's cable plans.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign chose the ad themes after reading nearly 400 response
cards from a mailer sent to 30,000 Hollywood residents. Many cited
diversity and the area's history as what they liked best about
Hollywood, and "dirt" and "filth" as what they liked least.</TE>
<TE>   Jimenez, a former KFWB-AM (980) reporter whose wife Sharon is the
campaign's press secretary, produced the two ads. The first cost only
about $1,500 in editing fees because it is made up entirely of
footage from local news broadcasts about the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The ad features quick cuts of Hollywood images, from Grauman's
Chinese Theatre to Marilyn Monroe, which fly by to the tune of the
Hollywood campaign's theme song, "Hey L.A., Set Hollywood Free." La
Pietra, a nightclub owner who hopes to be mayor of the new city,
appears in a clip.</TE>
<TE>   "You drive around Hollywood and it breaks your heart to see what
Hollywood has become. It has been neglected and ignored by City Hall
for the last 75 years, and we're not taking it any longer," he says,
accompanied by images of sidewalk trash and an abandoned couch. The
ad continues with upbeat campaign scenes, mostly from the day the
Local Agency Formation Commission officially put Hollywood secession
on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Jimenez said the fast-paced ad (which includes the words "STRONG
RENT CONTROL" flitting past on the screen so quickly they're almost
imperceptible) is "designed for a younger audience."</TE>
<TE>   The second ad, which cost about $10,000, features five Hollywood
city council candidates with ethnic origins ranging from Thailand to
Armenia to Central America--appearing separately and then crossing a
street, arm in arm. They are filmed at night, mostly in front of the
lights of Hollywood theaters.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm Pashree Sripipat. I stand for diversity in the new city of
Hollywood," says the publisher of a Thai-English newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm Rosa Martinez for improved education," says a teacher who
immigrated to the States from Central America.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra appears with his arms open, speaking over the closing
strains of "America the Beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   "We owe it to our glorious past to create a new future for the
city of Hollywood," he says. Then the candidates are shown together,
arms linked.</TE>
<TE>   "On Nov. 5, make Hollywood its own city. Vote yes on H. Vote yes
for leadership," intones Jimenez, who serves as narrator.</TE>
<TE>   The ad campaign starts gently, but will pack more punch down the
road, said Geoffrey Garfield, campaign manager for Hollywood
Independence.</TE>
<TE>   "First we sell the vision. Then we attach that vision to
personalities, which gives it the human touch. We say, 'We want a
better Hollywood.' Then, 'These are the problems. We think we can
solve them with a separate city.' Then, 'These are the kinds of
people who are going to be running a separate city.' We define
ourselves for ourselves, but then we define" the city of Los Angeles,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't talk about attack commercials. I call them 'distinction.'
What's the distinction between us and [the city of L.A.]?"</TE>
<TE>   He said future "distinction" ads likely will focus on such topics
as the criminal investigation of the Entertainment Industry
Development Corp., a sore subject for the mayor because he sits on
its board. The secession campaign equates the EIDC situation with
Enron and has dubbed it "Filmgate."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, campaign workers have held up pro-secession signs
at major Hollywood intersections. Hollywood secessionists have also
begun turning up at the mayor's news conferences to loudly critique
him. They say they also plan to do joint television ads with Valley
secessionists.</TE>
<TE>   Garfield said he also expected the mayor's anti-secession team to
help the secessionists' campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're going to be heavy-handed. When you're in power,
you're in the comfort zone. You've got buffers of staff and money,"
he said. "They're talking to each other. They're not talking to the
people."</TE>

<HD>Curbs on Security Guards, Weapon Parts Become Law</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis approved a security package Sunday that makes it
illegal to carry weapon replicas or parts at airports and prohibits
security guards from working until their background checks have been
completed.</LD>
<LD>   Saying that the measures strengthened security statewide by
closing legal loopholes, Davis signed state Senate bills 510 and 1241
as a preview of legislation to be approved today at a state homeland
defense summit in Ontario.</LD>
<LD>   The weapon measure was introduced by Sen. Jack Scott (D-Altadena)
after two incidents at LAX last spring, one when a passenger tried to
smuggle a handgun frame onto a plane and another when two terminals
were evacuated after a hand grenade replica was detected in a man's
luggage.</LD>
<TE>   Those actions now would be misdemeanors punishable by six months
in jail and/or a $1,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   "This legislation cracks down on people who incite fear and
disrupt transportation systems," Davis said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo, who supported the bill,
said that allowing passengers to carry weapon parts means that people
could collaborate and assemble a handgun on a plane.</TE>
<TE>   The other bill prevents security guard companies from giving
applicants temporary registration cards allowing them to work while
undergoing background checks. In one incident, cited by bill sponsor
Sen. Liz Figueroa (D-Fremont), a woman recognized a bank guard as a
man who had robbed her five years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Background checks typically find that about 5% of security guard
applicants are convicted felons, Figueroa said.</TE>
<TE>   "When someone sees a security guard, they make the assumption that
they're there to improve security, not detract from it," said Newport
Beach Police Chief Bob McDonell, president of the California Police
Chiefs Assn. Letting guards work before they have been investigated
creates "a real false sense of security that I think is unfair to
businesses and the people that rely on them."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. funds will be used to buy more digital fingerprinting
equipment and hire more investigators, so that the background check
turnaround time will be shortened from up to six months to as little
as a day, Figueroa said.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Davis is expected to sign bills increasing penalties for
possessing weapons of mass destruction, beef up regulations on
transporting hazardous materials and expand law enforcement's
wiretapping rights, said George Vincent, the governor's security
advisor.</TE>

<HD>Program Offers College Without the Long Commute</HD>
<DH>Education: University Center in Valencia lets
advanced-degree students take courses from seven far-flung campuses,
sparing them a daunting drive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE STASSEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lectures and the homework didn't keep Susan Ledoux from getting
her teaching credential at Cal State Northridge, but 45 miles of
freeway gridlock and the endless hunt for campus parking did.</LD>
<LD>   A new program closer to home changed her mind. She enrolled at a
Valencia community college, where seven universities offer an array
of degrees and credential programs.</LD>
<LD>   "CSUN is a huge campus and the drive home at night after class
would have been impossible," said Ledoux, who lives in Green Valley,
about 25 miles north of Valencia. "I definitely wouldn't be getting
my credential now if I had to go there."</LD>
<TE>   The College of the Canyons' pioneering University Center has
attracted about 1,000 students who are earning advanced degrees on
its campus. In spartan temporary quarters, the seven universities
offer more than 20 degree programs ranging from bachelor's to
doctoral degrees, as well as teaching and school administrative
credentials.</TE>
<TE>   Tuition is about the same as students would pay if they were on
the four-year campus. Diplomas bear the name of the university as if
classes were taken on the home campus, instead of in Valencia.</TE>
<TE>   The courses are attractive to those who work or live in Santa
Clarita, a city of 158,000 that has experienced a recent growth spurt
in housing and industry yet lacks a major university. Although Cal
State Northridge is 20 miles away, traffic congestion can make the
trip an hour each way.</TE>
<TE>   About 15 of the state's 108 community colleges have partnerships
with universities, but few have the broad reach of College of the
Canyons, said Chancellor Tom Nussbaum of the California community
college system.</TE>
<TE>   "It fits people's work patterns and gives them access to four-year
degrees. It's a progressive concept, and I applaud them for being on
the forefront," Nussbaum said.</TE>
<TE>   The arrangement is convenient for Dave LeBarron, whose office is
150 feet away from the University Center.</TE>
<TE>   Students Grateful</TE>
<TE>   LeBarron, principal of a small high school program housed at
College of the Canyons, said he had planned for a few years to get a
doctoral degree in educational leadership but didn't want to drive to
UCLA or USC to do it. To earn a master's degree four years ago, he
drove more than 90 miles round trip  from Palmdale to Cal State
Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   "It was horrible. The semester would start and I'd be excited, but
by the end of the semester I'd be saying, 'Just shoot me. I can't
take this,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If it weren't for this, I wouldn't be [getting my doctorate] now.
It would be another seven, eight, nine years," said LeBarron, who
will begin classes next month toward a doctoral degree from Nova
Southeastern University of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. "I have two small
kids at home and I don't want to be away from home any more than I
have to."</TE>
<TE>   The University Center, which began offering courses two years ago,
had been on the drawing board for many years, said College of the
Canyons President Dianne Van Hook.</TE>
<TE>   She first encountered the concept in the early 1980s when, as an
administrator at Santa Ana College, she attended a meeting at
Saddleback College in Mission Viejo. She noticed a sign on the
Saddleback campus saying Cal State Fullerton and learned that the
university was offering upper-division classes in Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   When she came to College of the Canyons 14 years ago, Hook said,
she had hoped to establish such a relationship with CSUN; but for a
variety of reasons it didn't happen at that time. Finally in 1999,
the Valencia college connected with Cal State Bakersfield; and since
then, six other universities have joined the program. In addition to
Bakersfield, Nova Southeastern and CSUN, they are Cal State Fresno,
Woodbury University in Burbank, the University of La Verne and
Chapman University in Orange. The center also has an English-language
immersion program offered through ELS Language Schools.</TE>
<TE>   Building Plans</TE>
<TE>   The center's enrollment has grown so quickly that College of the
Canyons officials plan to replace the 7,600-square-foot temporary
building with a 50,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art facility that
would allow more universities to offer their courses in Valencia.</TE>
<TE>   About 25 community members have organized a campaign to raise the
$10 million needed for construction, which campus officials hope will
start in the next 12 to 18 months, said campaign co-chairman Tom Lee,
former CEO of Newhall Land &amp; Farming.</TE>
<TE>   To date $1.3 million has been raised, mainly from community
college employees and area residents, Lee said. (Campus officials
said as much as $2 million for infrastructure work will be funded
from an $82.1-million college district bond that passed last
November.)</TE>
<TE>   "It's not an easy time to be out raising money, but we are very
determined," said Lee. "The idea is so universally liked in the
community that eventually we'll raise the money."</TE>
<TE>   Although Nussbaum predicts that the University Center concept will
expand to other community colleges, he sends a "signal of concern"
since recent state budget shortfalls may cut funding for colleges.
"We'll need to talk with the Legislature, the governor and the people
of the state," Nussbaum said. "The concept is good; and personally, I
think we ought to find a way to do it."</TE>

<HD>Irvine Stalks Parking Spot Scofflaws</HD>

<LD>At the wheel of her blue minivan, Sandra Keshmiri zips into the
Irvine Spectrum parking lot and pulls into a handicap space, knowing
in the back of her mind that she has no right to take the spot
because her mentally disabled daughter is not with her.</LD>
<LD>   But a matinee showing of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" is about to
start, and she figures she can shave the minute or two it might take
to get to the theater.</LD>
<LD>   "I only do it when I'm late," she explains after being caught
red-handed--and red-faced--by a pair of traffic cops.</LD>
<TE>   Irvine is in the midst of a major crackdown that has exposed an
ugly truth about a city that prides itself on being a slice of
suburban heaven: rampant abuse of handicap parking placards by
able-bodied motorists.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 100 citations have been issued since enforcement began a
few weeks ago, and police are finding that one in three placards is
misused. They have heard every excuse, and seen it all, including a
teenager at a concert who insisted she was her 80-year-old
grandmother when caught using the woman's placard; and drivers who
believe they have the right to use placards inherited from dead
relatives.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have never predicted anything close to what we're
getting," said Lt. Tom Hume, commander of the traffic division. "We
really need to get this stopped. It's a significant problem."</TE>
<TE>   The crackdown, which Irvine officials hope will become a model for
other cities, began as a wager between Irvine Police Chief Mike
Berkow and Planning Commissioner Anthony Dragun.</TE>
<TE>   Dragun, 44, was paralyzed in a bodysurfing accident when he was
younger and uses a wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   He and fellow activists agree that Irvine, a bedroom community of
148,000 with a relatively large disabled population, is one of the
most progressive cities when it comes to meeting their needs. For
example, the city offers a taxi service for disabled people, and
because much of the community's development is new, most buildings
are handicapped-accessible.</TE>
<TE>   But lately, he and some of his friends noticed that even the
clusters of handicapped spaces at shopping centers such as the
Spectrum and stores like Costco are often all taken.</TE>
<TE>   Suspecting that parking privileges were widely abused, Dragun bet
a skeptical Berkow a cup of coffee that his hunch would check out.</TE>
<TE>   "He thought I was probably exaggerating the case," Dragun said.
"What they did find out is that there is a very significant problem
indeed--so much so that Chief Berkow now owes me a cup of coffee."</TE>
<TE>   Dragun and other advocates believe some violators park in the
spaces to save a few seconds in their fast-paced lives, either
unaware or insensitive to the hardship their actions cause. The
problem is most severe at the popular shopping centers where even
regular spaces are hard to come by.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people just don't care," Dragun said. "But a lot of them
don't understand all the ramifications of parking in a handicap spot.
So hopefully, this will educate people. They'll realize these spaces
serve a really important purpose."</TE>
<TE>   The blue placards are issued by the state Department of Motor
Vehicles to anyone whose physical disease or disability impairs their
mobility.</TE>
<TE>   As of July, more than 1.6 million Californians had been granted
placards. They must be renewed every other year, and returned or
discarded once a placard-holder dies. Misuse of the placards is a
misdemeanor, with violators facing fines of up to $1,500 and other
penalties, depending on the jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   The DMV does not track citations, and leaves enforcement and
prosecutions to municipalities.</TE>
<TE>   The use of handicap spaces by able-bodied drivers is a growing
national issue. Some East Coast communities send volunteers to check
parking lots, while the Los Angeles Police Department has its own
parking-place patrols.</TE>
<TE>   In one high-profile case, 19 UCLA football players were accused in
1999 of lying to the DMV about maladies ranging from asthma to lower
back pain to get the placards. Each defendant was ordered to pay
$1,485 and perform 200 hours of community service and was placed on
two years' probation.</TE>
<TE>   In Irvine, violators caught in the new crackdown are issued a $250
parking ticket and can face additional fines of up to $750.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Oldoerp, a traffic investigator, and Scott Grange, a parking
officer, are in charge of policing the parking lots.</TE>
<TE>   When confronted by officers, some violators are unapologetic,
contending they are entitled to use the placards as a reward for
ferrying their disabled friends or family members. Others
shamefacedly admit their error. A few have claimed they are waiting
for a disabled passenger to come out of a restaurant or shop. Oldoerp
and Grange simply outwait them.</TE>
<TE>   During sweeps at the Verizon Amphitheatre, a man running late for
a David Bowie concert was caught using a placard issued for his son,
who has Down syndrome. A teenager attending a Weezer show was caught
using her grandmother's placard three months after the woman died.
She tried to identify herself as her grandmother, birth date and all.</TE>
<TE>   "So I said 'OK, you're 80 years old?' " Oldoerp recalled with a
laugh.</TE>
<TE>   One woman argued that she inherited her husband's parking
privileges when he died two years ago. And in one of the ugliest
confrontations, a woman at Wild Rivers water park with her son nearly
backed her car into Grange.</TE>
<TE>   She insisted the placard was hers even though it was registered to
a male with a different last name. At one point, she tried to rip it
from Grange's hands.</TE>
<TE>   "Her story changed so many times," Grange said, noting that he had
to call two patrol cars for help. "She put her car in reverse and
inched back at me. She said 'I don't have time for this.' She got
verbally abusive."</TE>
<TE>   Grange and Oldoerp say their goal is to someday find no cheaters
at all--because that would mean that people are getting the message.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad. People who need the handicap spaces are not able to use
them because someone's taking advantage of the system. It's
unethical. And it gets to the point sometimes of 'How low will you
sink?' "</TE>

<HD>Gay Activists Split Despite Successes</HD>
<DH>Legislature: With inheritance and other benefits signed
into law, California is seen as second only to Vermont as a
gay-friendly state. Some say it's not enough.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>These would seem heady times for gay rights advocates in California.
Laws granting lesbian and gay couples inheritance and other benefits
that seemed unattainable not long ago were signed by the governor
last week. A caucus was established over the summer for state
lawmakers who want to advance more such measures. And even GOP
gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr.'s staff felt the need to
pledge support for gay rights--never mind that Simon himself reversed
the campaign's position.</LD>
<LD>   Outside Vermont, where a court order allows gays to enter civil
unions resembling marriage, California is now widely perceived as the
country's most gay-friendly state.</LD>
<LD>   Yet despite achieving many of their goals for the legislative
session, gay rights advocates remain divided about whether the year
has been a success, and about the political strategy of the
movement's leaders at the Capitol.</LD>
<TE>   Of eight proposals this year to grant new rights to gays, the
Legislature approved six, and Gov. Gray Davis so far has signed three
into law--measures that provide survivor benefits to gays who suffer
the loss of a domestic partner. He is still considering bills that
would prohibit discrimination against gay youth in foster care and
allow gays and non-gays to take paid family leave from their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   With each measure, sponsors overcame the arguments of opponents
who said the bills were the work of extremists and who fear that any
change in the law is a step toward gay marriage, which the opponents
see as eroding the sanctity of the institution.</TE>
<TE>   Rift Among Activists</TE>
<TE>   Even so, disagreement among gay activists over how to win more
civil rights is bubbling to the surface. Many, including gay
lawmakers who carry the legislation, are pleased with the incremental
victories and warn against reaching for too much too fast.</TE>
<TE>   But a growing group sees the gains made in the last year as
evidence that California voters are ready to accept a Vermont-style
civil union system. They want to mobilize all the gay community's
political might behind a push for it.</TE>
<TE>   Ilona Turner, legislative advocate for the Los Angeles-based
California Alliance for Pride and Equality, remains sobered, she
says, by the math.</TE>
<TE>   By Turner's count, there are 1,000 rights and responsibilities
linked to marriage. California's gay domestic partners so far have
been granted but a handful. At this rate, she says, it will take 100
years for the law to treat gays as equal to everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are getting tired of doing things incrementally,"
she said. "I wouldn't say these are great strides."</TE>
<TE>   Others warn that aggressively pursuing civil-union legislation
would be a big mistake just two years after 57% of Californians
approved Proposition 22, reserving marriage exclusively for
heterosexuals.</TE>
<TE>   Making a hard push for civil unions now, some activists warn,
could stir up resentment among mainstream voters whose support is
crucial to gaining more rights.</TE>
<TE>   "You always have a naysayer sitting on a perch with a mimosa
telling you it is not enough," said Assemblywoman Carole Migden
(D-San Francisco), one of four openly gay state lawmakers. Term
limits are forcing Migden out of the Legislature this year, but the
newly formed Lesbian and Gay Caucus is expected to grow, with openly
gay men favored to win two new seats in the election.</TE>
<TE>   "We're out here getting these things done, and these people are on
the sidelines at brunch saying, 'It is not enough,' " Migden said,
pointing out that the only reason Vermont gays and lesbians have more
rights is a judicial order. "Of course it is not enough. But it is
what we are able to do now."</TE>
<TE>   Even the narrowest of gay rights measures--like one that would
keep a house's value from being reassessed if it has two gay owners
and one dies--are resisted as attempts to slowly slip gay marriage
through a legislative back door.</TE>
<TE>   "It is just the time we live in that an additional benefit here
and there are considered historic," said state Sen. Sheila Kuehl
(D-Santa Monica), California's first openly gay legislator. "The
sheer struggle of it makes every gain a cause for celebration. You
have to sit through hours of homophobic speeches in the Legislature
for every measure. People picket the offices of newer members, hoping
to frighten them into being more homophobic."</TE>
<TE>   When lawmakers tried to bring a civil union bill before the
Assembly last year, it didn't even make it out of committee.</TE>
<TE>   Davis Is Criticized</TE>
<TE>   Davis came under heavy criticism last week for signing AB 2216, a
bill that gives surviving domestic partners inheritance rights equal
to those of married heterosexuals who lose a spouse. Among those who
fought for the law was Keith Bradkowski, whose life partner, Jeff
Collman, was a flight attendant on American Airlines Flight 11, the
first plane that crashed into the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   The two had been together 11 years and were registered as domestic
partners, but when Collman died without a will, Bradkowski was
entitled to none of his assets.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said the measure will help family members of those who died
in the Sept. 11 attacks. Members of the Campaign for California
Families didn't see it that way.</TE>
<TE>   "All of these laws signed by Gray Davis undermine marriage piece
by piece, limb by limb," said a statement from executive director
Randy Thomasson. "Soon, marriage won't be special anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Awaiting the governor's signature is AB 2651, which would require
gay and lesbian sensitivity training for foster parents. In a floor
speech a few weeks ago imploring colleagues not to approve the bill,
Assemblyman Dennis Mountjoy (R-Monrovia) said religious groups
opposed to homosexuality that are working in the foster care system
would have to pull out if the bill were to become law. "You think
you've got a foster care crisis now; pass this and see what happens,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although other Republicans distanced themselves from Mountjoy's
remark that "it is not OK to be gay," 27 of them joined him in voting
against the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Considering that resistance to many gay rights laws extends from
the far right to many mainstream Democrats, Assemblywoman Christine
Kehoe (D-San Diego), another openly gay lawmaker, says the governor's
support for the latest measures has been historic.</TE>
<TE>   "He has signed more landmark legislation than all other California
governors put together," she said. "I see him as an important leader
for equal rights."</TE>
<TE>   Such praise makes other gay rights activists cringe.</TE>
<TE>   John Duran, an openly gay West Hollywood city councilman, said
he's grateful for every step that's been made. But the bills lobbed
at Davis have been softballs, he said, and it is time for the
governor to get behind a civil union measure.</TE>
<TE>   "What people find objectionable is the word 'marriage,' because it
rings themes of a bride and groom on a wedding cake," Duran said.
"With civil union, we can obtain all the rights and responsibilities
without calling it marriage."</TE>
<TE>   Duran and other advocates are drafting a civil union bill to bring
before the Legislature next session. They plan to be in Sacramento in
force to support the newly formed Lesbian and Gay Caucus in moving it
forward.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just fundamentally fair and right," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some think it would not be fair enough. Kuehl suggests that it
might be wiser to steadily build support for gay marriage than to
launch a divisive civil union battle.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ambivalent about a civil union bill because it would be a
large undertaking politically, and we still would be unable to
marry," she said. "We would still have second-class citizenship. I
want us to reach the day when society says, 'I can't remember why we
didn't want them to marry.' "</TE>

<HD>Big-Buck Boats Still Draw the Dreamers</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Annual yacht show attendance is up 40%. The
priciest craft, at $8.4 million, has nine televisions.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 15,000 dreamers and boat lovers streamed into Lido Marina
Village in Newport Beach this weekend to see a flotilla of
million-dollar yachts equipped with features including granite
kitchen counters and high-tech security systems.</LD>
<LD>   The 29th annual Lido Yacht Expo seemed immune from the financial
ills on Wall Street, attracting 40% more visitors than previous
years, organizers said.</LD>
<LD>   "Big-boat sales seem to be insulated from the recession," said
Duncan McIntosh, the show's producer and publisher of Go Boating and
Sea magazines.</LD>
<TE>   McIntosh expected more than a dozen sales during the show, and
many deals made after it ended Sunday. Most yachts that sell are the
"bread-and-butter variety" that cost $400,000 to $1 million, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Iovenitti, Coldwell Banker general manager for Irvine and
Huntington Beach, was looking for one of those to use near his home
on Balboa Island. "We're trying to determine what to do next summer,"
said Iovenitti, who did not plan to buy immediately. "It's like
buying a house. You don't buy the first one you see."</TE>
<TE>   The show was expanded this year to include even more yachts in the
beyond-40-foot range. There were 240 boats at the show, plenty with
multimillion-dollar price tags. Even the smallest, at 26 feet, is
considered a yacht.</TE>
<TE>   The most expensive at the show, an $8.4-million, 91-foot, 2003
Queenship Tri-Deck motoryacht, was sold before the show. Even those
without millions toured the Queenship, eyeballing four spacious
sleeping areas, nine televisions, security cameras, specialized bait
containers in the cockpit and hidden storage for 48 fishing rods
under a sofa. In one sleeping area, a sunroof over the bed opens to
allow in the sea air.</TE>
<TE>   The 205,000-pound boat was built for a Southern California couple
but shown at the Expo to lure other yacht lovers in the market for
their own.</TE>
<TE>   Most visitors touring the vessel could afford only to gawk.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a little tight this month," joked Joan Bloomberg of Coto de
Caza, referring to her finances.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to buy a boat, but probably a smaller version,"
explained husband Paul, who was seriously eyeing 50-footers.</TE>
<TE>   For those who wanted to deal, a 91-foot McKinna yacht was reduced
from $4.4 million to $3.8 million. The boat offers six sleeping areas
and many amenities.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps even of greater interest than the multimillion-dollar
models was a round craft designed by French naval architect
Jean-Michel Ducancell, who was inspired by a round boat used in a
James Bond film.</TE>
<TE>   The futuristic Anthena, which offers an underwater window with
submarine lights that attract fish, drew hundreds of people, said Les
Anthenea President Alan Algan.</TE>
<TE>   The show also included a 34-foot model of the USS Arizona sunk in
Pearl Harbor during World War II.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A reputed member of a skinhead gang who was bailed out of Orange
County Jail in July with $500,000 in bogus cashier's checks was
returned to custody Friday after police found him hiding in a car in
Huntington Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Dominic Peter Rizzo, 33, was being held on attempted murder
charges when a friend bailed him out on July 17. Police discovered
the checks were phony 18 days later and issued a warrant for Rizzo's
arrest. The incident triggered a change in policy at the jail, which
will now only accept checks during banking hours, when the funds can
be verified.</LD>

killed Sunday when he lost control of his Honda Civic and struck the
eucalyptus tree at left. Police say he was apparently driving too
fast on eastbound Crown Valley Parkway, near Greenfield Drive, in
Laguna Niguel about 3:45 p.m., when he struck the center divider and
careened off the road. Garibo was alone in the car.</CP>

<HD>Camarillo's Force Behind the Force</HD>
<DH>Volunteers: The Citizen Patrol is one of several teams in
the county that provide vital assistance to police in their
communities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZIE ST. JOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Carole Crouse's son heard that she was joining the Camarillo
Citizen Patrol, he jokingly asked, "Dad, they're not going to give
her a gun, are they?"</LD>
<LD>   They didn't, but the 64-year-old Crouse said her son, a Santa
Barbara County sheriff's deputy, is well aware of the importance of
the unarmed volunteer group.</LD>
<LD>   "We love to be out there and be helpful," said Crouse, a member of
the patrol since 1999. "Even if it means waiting for a tow truck, I'm
glad to know that I'm able to put a detective back on the street
where he can be helping someone else."</LD>
<TE>   Formed in 1976--originally known as the CB Patrol--the Citizen
Patrol is a joint effort between the city of Camarillo and the
Ventura County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Thousand Oaks, Ojai, Fillmore and Moorpark, Camarillo
contracts for the services of the Sheriff's Department instead of
staffing its own police force. Officers drive black-and-white cars
marked "City of Camarillo Police," but wear Sheriff's Department
uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   The volunteers who make up the Citizen Patrol wear the same
uniform. But instead of a sheriff's badge, their badges are imprinted
with the city seal. They patrol the streets in two marked
electric-powered cars.</TE>
<TE>   Crouse said it took time for the 31 patrol members to get used to
the smaller vehicles because they originally drove Ford Crown
Victorias, the larger sedans used by many police departments.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone said we're going to get run over," Crouse said. "But
they drive like a dream and turn on a dime."</TE>
<TE>   Until 1995, the patrol was essentially a Neighborhood Watch
organization, its members patrolling on foot and communicating by CB
radios. Then the city expanded its duties and its areas of patrol.</TE>
<TE>   Today's group is made up of men and women, most of retirement age.
Asked to volunteer a minimum of 16 hours a month, most are on duty
for between 40 and 100 hours a month. Their backgrounds vary
widely--one was a psychiatrist, another a movie producer--but they
all come together for the common purpose of helping to keep their
city safe.</TE>
<TE>   The patrol members cruise the city in pairs on six-to eight-hour
shifts, from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Their duties include checking on abandoned cars, assisting
deputies with traffic control after accidents, doing house checks for
residents on vacation, waiting with motorists for tow trucks and
being on the lookout for suspicious vehicles or activities.</TE>
<TE>   "They strictly serve as our eyes and ears in the community," said
the patrol's advisor, Yvonne Wooff, a senior deputy with the
Sheriff's Department. "They are not to take any enforcement action.
Anything they see, they radio in to the department."</TE>
<TE>   She said a perfect example of why they don't get into
confrontations happened last year. Two patrol members thought they
saw a disabled vehicle, but upon reaching the front of the car they
observed two men fighting. The patrol members called the department,
but the two men took off--one on foot and one in the car.</TE>
<TE>   "They gave the deputies a good description of the car and the
license plate number," and the vehicle was stopped within minutes,
said Wooff, a 10-year veteran of the department. "In the car, the
deputies found 45 weapons, including automatic rifles, guns and
knives."</TE>
<TE>   The Citizen Patrol is sometimes called upon by detectives to
assist with tasks relating to the cases they're working on. Those
duties could involve anything from providing extra eyes on a stakeout
to photocopying evidence before it's handed over to the district
attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Walker, 66, recalled when the patrol was asked to help with
surveillance on a local hotel after a string of robberies at hotels
from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "After three weeks, we spotted the suspected vehicle entering the
parking lot, and it ended up being tied to more than 40 robberies,"
said Walker, a patrol member since 1997. "We don't do stakeouts that
often, but when extra resources are needed, we're there to help out."</TE>
<TE>   Wooff said the Citizen Patrol members also help with traffic
control at city events such as the annual Christmas parade, work as
school crossing guards and run a fingerprinting program in which a
child's name, address, physical description and thumbprint are
registered with the Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Patrol applicants must be at least 21 years old and are required
to speak, read and write English fluently. After they fill out an
application and questionnaire to determine eligibility, an oral
interview is given, followed by a full background check. They receive
40 hours of on-the-job training on first aid, patrol procedures, how
to recognize suspicious persons and vehicles, traffic control and
searching for lost or missing persons.</TE>
<TE>   Similar volunteer groups throughout the county range in size from
12 members in Santa Paula to 60 in Thousand Oaks. The names vary from
Volunteers In Policing, to Ojai Valley Volunteer Program, to
Neighborhood Watch Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   While many of the duties are similar, some of the volunteer groups
issue parking citations, a duty that was intentionally avoided in
Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you write that first ticket, you become the enemy," Wooff
said. "We don't want that to happen, because we're building a
partnership with the community."</TE>

<HD>Spin on This Poll Enough to Make You Dizzy</HD>

<LD>At first glance the news release from the Bill Simon campaign looked
stop-the-presses good: "Simon Leads Among Highest-Propensity Voters
... Davis-Simon Within 6 Points in New Poll."</LD>
<LD>   Ah, but there's always a "but"--and, in this case, several.</LD>
<LD>   For starters, highest-propensity voters are top-heavily
Republican. Remember Pete Wilson being dramatically ambulanced to
Capitol Hill and carried to the floor of the U.S. Senate in 1985 to
cast an important budget vote after he'd had his appendix cut out?
There's your highest-propensity voter.</LD>
<TE>   Deeper in the very carefully structured news release is the
information that the poll found that 35% of registered Democrats want
a new governor (meaning that as many as 65% do not, and that 35%
doesn't necessarily want a Gov. Simon). Ditto 40% of Latino voters,
same considerations.</TE>
<TE>   And the poll was conducted by Public Opinion Strategies, a big
Republican polling outfit out of Virginia. Not a surprise, you go to
your friends, but in this case they went to the hired help too.
Public Opinion Strategies has been paid tens of thousands by the
Simon campaign over recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Most candidates who publish their own polls usually note it's
their hired pollsters doing the work. It's almost like heading a news
release, "Candidate X: Best, Brightest and Likeliest to Floss,"
quoting Mom. Except you wouldn't have to pay Mom for the compliments.</TE>
<TE>   First National Bank of Hollywood Hit Again</TE>
<TE>   The money will be spread all over the country, but once again, it
comes straight outta Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Barbra 'n' Barry, Streisand and Manilow, will be taking the stage
and singing--individually and, who knows, maybe a deux--to raise
money for Democratic candidates trying to retake the House of
Representatives. The Sept. 29 event at the Kodak Theatre, new home to
the Oscars, will raise cash for the hottest 40 congressional races
around the country.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the DCCC to those
inside the Beltway and in the loop, ran a full-page ad about the
event--not in any organs of opinion and politics, but in
Variety--headlined, "The Fund-Raising Effort to Win a Democratic
Majority in the U.S. House of Representatives Invite You to Join Them
for the National Democratic Gala."</TE>
<TE>   Ticket price is $500 for each of the 3,400 seats; you can do the
math. And if anyone was hoping Bill Clinton might take it into his
head to show up with his saxophone ... he'll be overseas.</TE>
<TE>   GOP Candidates Digging Deep for Dollars</TE>
<TE>   Down the November ballot are the names of some statewide
Republican candidates who are hurting. By August, their campaign
reports showed they'd collected only one dollar for every 10 bagged
by their Democratic opponents.</TE>
<TE>   So Gerry Parsky, FOB (Friend of Bush) and the more moderate muscle
behind the state's GOP, had a plan. He brought together the seven
candidates for constitutional offices (lieutenant governor, secretary
of state and such) and made them an offer that ... well, you've heard
that bit.</TE>
<TE>   The plan was this: The party would raise a million bucks for TV
ads for them to air in the last six days before the election--if they
could match it (meaning rake up about $143,000 each).</TE>
<TE>   It's a deal, but it's still been a struggle, says Greg Conlon,
who's running for state treasurer against the incumbent, Phil
Angelides, and who--as of August--had about $28,200 to Angelides'
$6.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The party is focused on Bill" Simon, Conlon said. A pretty fuzzy
focus, considering that Simon himself has a six-to-one cash
disadvantage on Davis. But now that his family firm is off the hook
for $78 million after a judge threw out a civil judgment against the
company, he may have a little more loose change to spread around.</TE>
<TE>   But Will They Fill Up Their Blue Books?</TE>
<TE>   If there are some empty seats in L.A.'s City Council chamber this
Thursday and Friday, it may be because a few council members, and
even more of their deputies, are at USC, taking notes and cramming
for the city's big final exam, its SAT: secession.</TE>
<TE>   The conference isn't about the flashy politics of drawing a line
in the sand at the Cahuenga Pass, but about the more sober realities
of secession, evidence such seminar titles as "Secession: Size and
Governance" and others on the particulars of boroughs and
neighborhood councils.</TE>
<TE>   The conference, with its big-name social-science players, is
sponsored by the John Randolph Haynes and Dora Haynes Foundation.
Haynes was chief architect of the city's 1925 charter, with its
then-revolutionary provisions for (gasp) citizens commissions. That
makes the Haynes archive at UCLA the Federalist Papers of L.A.
Without the wigs.</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * State Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, whose only point in
common with Gray Davis is that both are Democrats, says he'll work to
help Davis beat Bill Simon by a large margin, even though he couldn't
resist adding, "I don't necessarily think that anybody who beats Bill
Simon by a big margin could consider that a mandate about much,
except Bill Simon."</TE>
<TE>   * You say Hispanic, I say Iberian, it's all Latino. A few
Republican legislators who identify themselves as Hispanic are miffed
about a newspaper ad for Democratic congressional candidate Dennis
Cardoza, who's running for Gary Condit's seat. The ad, in the Latino
Times of Central California, quotes state Democratic Party Chairman
Art Torres as saying, "As a Hispanic candidate, Dennis Cardoza will
bring an important perspective to Washington, D.C." The Republicans'
grievance is that Cardoza's grandparents are from Portugal, that
country right alongside Spain on the Iberian Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   * Actor-turned-director-turned-political powerhouse Rob Reiner
told the Hollywood Reporter that he won't rule out running for office
one day, no doubt building on the success of his 1998 statewide
initiative raising the cigarette tax to fund early-childhood
development programs. Political junkies already are drooling over the
prospect of a gubernatorial 2006 matchup between Reiner and another
actor-turned politico: Arnold Schwarzenegger.</TE>
<TE>   * Huell Howser, a man invariably termed "folksy," host of the
KCET-TV program "California's Gold," is the man a Palm Springs
business group wants to draft to become the city's next mayor.</TE>
<TE>   * Two books out of Orange County: at 100 sales and climbing, Len
Kranser's "Internet for Activists," about how the Internet influenced
Orange County's fight over a commercial airport at the former El Toro
Marine base ... and "The Big Orange," Orange County GOP maven Lois
Lundberg's chatty, self-published memoir of a half-century of Orange
County politics, with many pictures of GOP leaders in the company of
... Lois Lundberg!</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "People will go into the ballot booth, scratch their heads and
wonder why they're voting on this. The language in this went from
creme brulee to plain vanilla."</TE>
<TE>   Lawndale City Atty. Bill Wynder, speaking of an eminent domain
measure on his city's November ballot. A judge ordered the ballot
language simplified, siding with critics who said there was no
guarantee that eminent domain would do everything promised in the
glowing 74-word language, like creating jobs; attracting business;
improving parks, libraries and senior services; and fixing potholes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ups and downs: Nearly 70 days late and many dollars short compared
with the last state spending plan, the completed and signed budget
for the fiscal year 2002-03 is held up by Gov. Gray Davis, left. GOP
gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr., in a San Jose Rotary speech,
shows parental chagrin as he tells how his four children spoke
eloquently of how their father could benefit California--and then son
Willie, 14, said he didn't want his father to win because he didn't
want to move to Sacramento.</TE>

<HD>Universal Preschool a Daunting Task</HD>
<DH>Children: Experts say plan for a countywide system will
require consensus-building, political support.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA RIVERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles County commission attracted wide attention last month
when it resolved to spend $100 million in the first steps toward a
universal preschool system.</LD>
<LD>   Behind-the-scenes members of the staff at the Proposition 10
Commission suddenly were fielding calls from parents eager to enroll
youngsters, from child-care experts offering advice and from overseas
newspapers seeking comment.</LD>
<LD>   The initial excitement, however, was followed quickly by
recognition of the project's enormous scope: It was intended to
provide free preschool to more than 100,000 3-and 4-year-olds and
eventually to serve many more from birth to kindergarten.</LD>
<TE>   The question now is whether the formerly low-key commission,
funded with tobacco tax money, can carry it off.</TE>
<TE>   Many experts around the country applaud the Los Angeles County
initiative but warn that it faces significant barriers--especially to
finding political leaders to champion the project and to uniting the
often squabbling community of child-care and preschool providers.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't kid ourselves on the magnitude of what we have set out
to do," said Teresa Nuno, the commission's programs director. "It's
going to be a tricky balance to keep everyone on the same page; to
keep the energy level and interest in the project high."</TE>
<TE>   The commission, which recently renamed itself the Los Angeles
First Five Commission, for the first five years of life, has taken a
few concrete steps. It released a tentative year-long timeline to
come up with a workable plan. It will establish a community advisory
council and, perhaps more crucial, is looking to hire someone from
outside the agency to guide the project, someone knowledgeable and
respected in the field and with political savvy and vision. The
commission hopes to make the appointment in the next few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Reiner Idea</TE>
<TE>   That person will have to help move the project from the shadow of
filmmaker and children's advocate Rob Reiner, who as chairman of the
state Proposition 10 Commission first championed the idea of
universal preschool in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   In the commission's fledgling plan, existing preschool programs
would be expanded from half days to full days, child-care providers
would be trained to become preschool instructors, new centers would
be built to pick up the slack, and needy families could receive other
social services. The program would be free to 3-and 4-year-olds,
regardless of family income.</TE>
<TE>   But there will be tough choices: Who will administer the vast
system once it's up and running? Which neighborhoods will get
attention first? Will families get vouchers or some other form of
subsidy to enroll their children in the program? What standards will
preschools be held to, and who will monitor their performance?</TE>
<TE>   The first enrollments likely will be in neighborhoods with
low-performing elementary schools. But that concept and decisions
over where to build new facilities could set off political debate.</TE>
<TE>   The commission also must consider whether the preschool program
will divert energies from other worthy projects, such as health care
for youngsters, and how it will afford to maintain and expand
preschool access as tobacco taxes shrink with the decline in smoking.
The county agency now receives about $165 million annually from the
statewide Proposition 10 cigarette tax approved in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Not Enough Preschools</TE>
<TE>   Child care in the county now is an uncoordinated hodgepodge of
private centers, public Head Start programs, school-based preschools
and in-home child-care providers. A recent UC Berkeley study put the
number of licensed preschool slots at nearly 104,000. The preschool
population is estimated at 300,000. That report concluded that at
least 100,000 preschool-age children are on waiting lists for
subsidized care in the county, while some centers have vacancies.</TE>
<TE>   Planners are aware of suspicions among groups that have battled
for resources and turf. "The challenge is the sheer number of
perspectives and groups and people that need to be a part of this,"
said Jacquelyn McCroskey, a USC social work professor and commission
member.</TE>
<TE>   Divisions exist, for example, between the early childhood
education camp, which promotes classroom-based preschool, with
accredited teachers and a strong curriculum, and the home-based
family day-care providers who believe many parents prefer smaller
group settings led by trusted staff members who may not have teaching
credentials.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles commission wants to develop a single standard of
education and training for providers. Part of that initiative may
establish higher pay scales to retain those who earn new degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "Family child-care providers in other states have had the bad
experience of being promised an opportunity to participate and being
disappointed," said Nancy Wyatt, president of the Family Child Care
Council of the San Fernando Valley. "Some people are frightened. They
don't know what L.A. is going to come up with in terms of teacher
requirements or whether families, intentionally or unintentionally,
will be diverted from them."</TE>
<TE>   A Complex Enterprise</TE>
<TE>   Universal preschool represents the most complex enterprise
undertaken by the nine-member commission, which is appointed by the
county Board of Supervisors and includes heads of county departments
as well as community members. Its chairman is Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky, and the executive director is Evelyn V. Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   A state commission and 58 county ones were formed four years ago
after voters approved a 50-cent tax on cigarettes to fund prenatal
services and early childhood development programs. The Los Angeles
County commission has spent about $500 million on services for
newborns, family literacy and education programs and health
initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   A few other county commissions around the state have been
criticized for spending funds unwisely. The commissions must report
their finances to the state commission but there is little formal
oversight. With this child-care initiative, public scrutiny is likely
to increase in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. County commission is enthusiastic but untested on such a
major effort, said Bruce Fuller, a UC Berkeley education professor
who has studied child-care issues. "But my own, biased, emotional
view is that we should help them out, give them some rope and hope it
will work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative has taken off locally because it has such broad
appeal across lines of race, ethnicity, income and geography,
commission members say. They concede that keeping people engaged
through the detailed planning process could be difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hearing from people highly regarded in the field about the
need to stay excited, but at the same time be very deliberate and
thoughtful on something as huge as this," noted commission official
Nuno.</TE>
<TE>   The commission, insisted Executive Director Martinez, will "not be
bureaucratic" in its planning. "We want to have some short-term
objectives and will look at opportunities to expand preschool as soon
as we find them."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is tackling the issue as the movement for universal
preschool grows across the nation, said James J. Gallagher, senior
investigator at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill's Frank
Porter Graham Child Development Institute. Gallagher urged Los
Angeles planners to secure the support of state and local officials.</TE>
<TE>   Cindy Gallagher, who oversees New York's preschool program, which
started in 1998 and uses state general funds, also said public
interest was essential. New York's program delegates planning to
local school districts, which must appoint community advisory boards.
About 50,000 4-year-olds are enrolled in the free program, said
Gallagher. "We put a lot of pressure on ourselves but we also
engendered a real commitment" from the community, she said.</TE>

<HD>Infamous Prison City Torn Down</HD>
<DH>Tijuana: Prostitutes, drugs, shops--all were available at
La Mesa. Mexico's president vows more 'cleansing.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE-MARIE O'CONNOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was never an address for the faint of heart.</LD>
<LD>   Yet when 1,500 well-armed federal police raided Tijuana's
notorious La Mesa State Penitentiary two weeks ago, and bulldozed the
sprawling village prisoners built in its courtyard, the inmates'
children cried.</LD>
<LD>   The infamous penitentiary--a carnivalesque casbah that sprouted
its own homes, shops, prostitutes and drug-dealing gangs--was the
only home many of the children had ever known.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a little city within a city. There was no law except the
law of money," said Raul Gutierrez Anaya, a spokesman for the Baja
California state attorney general's office. "Whoever had money could
have all the luxuries of anyone outside--television, wines, women and
drugs."</TE>
<TE>   The National Human Rights Commission in 1992 concluded that La
Mesa presented "a tableau that is unique in the world." Baja
California Gov. Eugenio Elorduy called the prison a "black legend."</TE>
<TE>   The destruction of the little universe within the penitentiary
gates--a place where prisoners paid $25,000 for townhomes with cell
phones, tiled bathrooms and Jacuzzis--began what Mexican President
Vicente Fox said would be a "complete cleansing" of La Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, who campaigned on promises to wipe out corruption,
characterized the prison raid as a triumph of a joint effort between
the army and newly trained federal police. He said the effort has
achieved "extraordinary results against organized crime and drug
traffickers" in Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   The Baja attorney general's office suggested that there is more
housecleaning to come. "They're going to have to punish those who
allowed all this," Gutierrez said.</TE>
<TE>   But reform of Mexico's criminal justice system has been a rocky
road, strewn with powerful special interests, cowed would-be
reformers and stymied investigations.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest twist to the bizarre saga at La Mesa, state
officials announced a few days ago that the prison's director, Carlos
Lugo Felix, has vanished since the Aug. 20 raid.</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez said authorities asked Lugo Felix to appear to answer
for "abandonment of duties," but he has failed to turn up.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know where he is," Gutierrez said. "The state attorney
general's office is looking for him."</TE>
<TE>   In Lugo Felix's absence, Tijuana state prosecutor Sergio Ortiz
Lara has assumed the post as prison director.</TE>
<TE>   Lugo Felix wasn't the first administrator to run into trouble at
the prison.</TE>
<TE>   The tenure of two previous directors was cut short when they were
killed, one of them during a prison riot in 1978, and a second when
he was gunned down by assassins waiting at his house in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Another fled under a cloud of suspicion that he was involved in
the thriving narcotics trade in the prison, where drugs were said to
be so plentiful that they sold for less than street prices.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of a strong authority over the years, prisoners set
many of the rules. They built as many as 400 houses, some with
microwaves, computers, DVD players and air conditioning. There were
maids, cooks and bodyguards. There were stores, pizza parlors,
tequila bars and video emporiums.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, a prisoner, who had two French poodles and a
Rottweiler, explained to a visitor the going rate for bribes to
smuggle in drugs and guns. One murder in the prison was committed
with an Uzi.</TE>
<TE>   Such a luridly illustrious fate would have seemed unthinkable when
the austere edifice was built in 1956, as a municipal jail for 600
prisoners. By the time of the raid, it housed 6,700.</TE>
<TE>   More than 2,200 prisoners were given a surprise transfer the day
of the raid to other prisons. After years of access to drugs, those
who were shipped out had to go cold turkey.</TE>
<TE>   The raid also touched off an earthquake among the prison staff.</TE>
<TE>   Since the prison director vanished, 53 of the 237 guards at La
Mesa were suspended, as authorities continue to investigate
suspicions of corruption, Gutierrez said. Half of the 53 have since
resigned, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Also displaced were prisoners' wives and children who had lived
inside the prison. The poorest lived in the open and were preyed upon
by thugs. The luckiest lived in the comfortable wood siding homes.</TE>
<TE>   As these families were shown the way out of "El Pueblito"--The
Little Town--bulldozers toppled the houses behind them, creating
mountains of rubble in the prison courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   Some 40 children had no parents except for prisoners, and they
were led away by social workers, tearfully clutching their toys.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the homeless families took shelter at the municipal
auditorium; a few accused the raiding police of stealing their
possessions. The last 80 such refugees have moved out of the
auditorium to the homes of relatives or friends, Gutierrez said.</TE>
<TE>   Difficult Separations</TE>
<TE>   "They cried to be separated from their fathers and husbands," he
said. "Entire families had been living there with the prisoners."</TE>
<TE>   The tradition of family cohabitation was perhaps the most
wholesome aberration at La Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   Here, the unorthodox had become such a tradition that, to some,
the chorus of official outrage over corruption there had a
less-than-sincere ring.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absurd," said Victor Clark, the bearded and bespectacled
director of Tijuana's private Binational Center for Human Rights, who
has visited La Mesa regularly since 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Clark, a respected analyst of organized crime who has interviewed
prison directors and inmates extensively, estimates that the prison's
black market concessions, from prostitution to drugs and housing,
generated $2 million a month in off-the-books earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "We always said the penitentiary was the under-the-table cash
register of the state government," Clark said. "People made a lot of
money at La Mesa, and the corruption went to very high levels."</TE>
<TE>   "Not only did [government officials] know, but they were
beneficiaries of the millions of dollars that penitentiary
generated," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Clark said each new director was quickly intimidated by the
organized criminals.</TE>
<TE>   He said some directors confided that they were sent briefcases of
cash. If they refused the money, they got telephone threats,
underlined by deliveries of elaborate funeral wreaths.</TE>
<TE>   Such persuasive tactics are known in Tijuana by a credo--"plata or
plomo," Spanish for "silver or lead"--whose most literal translation
is: take the cash or take a bullet.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether they sent them cash or funeral wreaths," Clark said, "all
of them maintained the status quo at the penitentiary."</TE>
<TE>   Clark said the captive audience of bored prisoners were a
lucrative, ready-made narcotics market. Some prisoners ran up such
debts that thugs threatened wives outside the prison that their
children would be kidnapped if families didn't pay up.</TE>
<TE>   He said some people visited the prison not to see inmates, but to
buy jewelry and other "merchandise."</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of the cheapest places in the city to buy jewels, all
of them stolen," he said. "You could find drugs on every corner."</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of the most wide open places in Tijuana."</TE>
<TE>   Clark said newcomers quickly adapted to the entrepreneurial

<TE>   It remains to be seen whether the raid of La Mesa is truly the end
of an era.</TE>
<TE>   In one interview, national public security chief Alejandro Gertz
Manero linked the raid at La Mesa to Mexico's drive to recover full
control over federal maximum-security prisons. He said that effort
began in January 2001, after renowned Mexican drug trafficker Joaquin
Guzman bought his way out of another regional prison--riding in a
laundry truck.</TE>
<TE>   "They say things have changed" at La Mesa, Clark said, "but today
prisoners are still selling cell phone calls for 50 cents a minute,
and prostitutes are still going in. The price of heroin and cocaine
has supposedly doubled."</TE>
<TE>   State attorney general's office spokesman Felipe Guicho said
investigators will get to the bottom of the improprieties.</TE>
<TE>   "The investigations will show who was involved in the corruption
at the prison," Guicho said, "until we find all of those
responsible."</TE>

<HD>Tug Over Indian Burial Site Escalates</HD>
<DH>History: In San Juan Capistrano, one faction seeks the
city's help in buying and leaving the land untouched.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of American Indians and archeologists has launched a campaign
to preserve a 29-acre parcel it says contains dozens of ancient
burial plots and is the last undeveloped remnant of the former tribal
village now known as San Juan Capistrano.</LD>
<LD>   At a prayer vigil Sunday, members called for the city to join them
to buy the property, build a cultural center and leave the Juaneno
burial site untouched.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a cemetery, and the people there are our ancestors," said
Fran Yorba, a tribal officer for one faction of Juanenos that
advocates preservation. "We have a moral obligation to our future
generations to fight for this piece of history not to be erased."</LD>
<TE>   It's the latest twist in the saga of the former agricultural
parcel at Camino Capistrano and Junipero Serra Road, a lot the city
had hoped could generate tax dollars and the crowded public school
district is eyeing for a middle school.</TE>
<TE>   The land belongs to Junipero Serra High School, a Roman Catholic
institution slated to open across the street next fall. The parochial
school wants to put athletic fields there, a plan that school
officials say has been approved by another faction of the local
Juaneno tribe so long as only fields, not buildings, are placed above
any burial grounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to use this site, but we want to respect their
ancestors," said Tim Busch, head of Serra's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   Serra supporters, meanwhile, are circulating petitions to force a
citywide vote next spring that would change the parcel's commercial
zoning so it can be used for athletic fields.</TE>
<TE>   Local preservationists have been bolstered in their efforts by
archeologist Patricia Martz, who believes there may be as many as 175
more bodies buried on the land.</TE>
<TE>   Martz, a professor at Cal State Los Angeles, said the tribal
village was first inhabited in the 1400s. It was known as Putiidhem,
which means "her navel" in honor of a revered clan leader.</TE>
<TE>   Martz also heads the California Cultural Resource Preservation
Alliance, a group of Indians and scientists formed to preserve Orange
County archeological sites, including the Serra land.</TE>
<TE>   But archeologist Henry Koerper of Cypress College, an expert on
Orange County prehistory who has studied the property for 20 years
and written reports on it for the city, cast doubt on Martz's burial
estimates. He said some estimates have run as high as a dozen, but
only seven burial plots have been found.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless you have X-ray vision, it's impossible to say how many
more burials are down there," Koerper said.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing where there are concentrations of burials means a school
could probably position buildings and fields so no remains are
disturbed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Koerper and Serra officials said the state has designated San Juan
Capistrano resident David Belardes as the authorized Juaneno
representative and that he has agreed to the school's plan.</TE>
<TE>   Belardes could not be reached for comment, but tribal manager
Joyce Stanfield Perry said the school has promised the tribe that a
Juaneno monument will be dedicated at the fields and that its history
classes will accurately portray Indians.</TE>
<TE>   "It is extremely unfortunate that we do not own that land and that
we cannot protect it in the manner that is appropriate," Perry said.
"But so far, [Serra officials] have been very sensitive to our
needs."</TE>
<TE>   Other members of the splintered tribe challenge Belardes'
authority to make decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Sonia Johnston, tribal council chairwoman for a third faction of
Juanenos, said school officials are listening to whatever Indian
group is willing to go along with its development plans.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to say that all of us who are emotionally and
spiritually attached to that land don't exist," Johnston said.</TE>
<TE>   Busch, Serra's board chairman, replied that while school officials
are sympathetic, they cannot compromise with all the factions.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not discounting their importance, but legally they aren't
recognized by the state," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Serra backers have struggled for three years since they first
announced plans for the Catholic high school at another site in the
city. Since then, a Christian ministry backed out of a deal to sell
land to Serra after finding that non-Catholics would be barred from
teaching religion there.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the school persuaded the city to drop plans for
a hotel and office complex there, but it still needs to win a zoning
change.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating matters, the Capistrano Unified School District has
designated the site as its first choice for a new middle school.</TE>
<TE>   District officials, who have considered using their powers of
eminent domain to take the land, heard a presentation by alliance
members last week and said they may revisit four other sites also
under consideration. But Deputy Supt. Margaret LaRoe said there is
much reason to recommend the Serra Road property.</TE>
<TE>   "If you take away the fact that it's sacred, this is a rare piece
of land: a buildable, flat parcel within San Juan Capistrano," LaRoe
said. "There aren't a lot of good pieces like this left."</TE>
<TE>   If Capistrano Unified does try to take over the land, tribal
manager Perry said the tribe would seek the same provisions it has
with Serra High School.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't about choosing the best development plan," she said.
"This is about making sure that education and preservation prevail."</TE>

<HD>City May Widen Ban on Smoking</HD>
<DH>Government: Mission Viejo's council will consider fining
those who light up in a city-owned building, vehicle or park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mission Viejo City Council today will consider a wide-ranging
anti-smoking ordinance that would prohibit people from lighting up in
any city-owned building, vehicle or public park.</LD>
<LD>   If approved, the ordinance would place Mission Viejo on the
cutting edge of anti-smoking regulations.</LD>
<LD>   Such regulations have moved from the workplace to bars and
restaurants, and are now increasingly being applied to outdoor public
areas.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the next wave of smoke-free areas that local governments
will be looking at," said Paul Knepprath, vice president for
government relations for the American Lung Assn. of California.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the state Legislature passed a law banning smoking on
playgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   A bill that would expand that by outlawing smoking within 25 feet
of playgrounds is currently before Gov. Gray Davis, Knepprath said.</TE>
<TE>   Several city councils--including those in Los Angeles and Beverly
Hills and San Fernando--have also expanded smoke-free areas in parks,
restrictions that go beyond the state's limits.</TE>
<TE>   "People are more and more looking at the effects of outdoor
tobacco smoke exposure," Knepprath said.</TE>
<TE>   It's an emerging field of study by scientists as well, and
"California is at ground zero for this kind of research," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo's ordinance--which would also affect all buildings
leased by the city, including the local YMCA--carries a $100 fine.</TE>
<TE>   "I think secondhand smoke is destructive; studies have shown
this," Mayor Susan Withrow said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our responsibility as a city to promote a healthy
environment," the mayor said. "It's important for us to be leaders
... and discourage unhealthy habits on city property."</TE>
<TE>   The city's planning and transportation committee approved the new
regulations last month.</TE>
<TE>   However, smoking on public streets or right of ways would not be
affected by the ordinance.</TE>

<HD>Parents Fight Changes in Special Ed</HD>
<DH>L.A. Unified: The effort to place children in regular
classes meets stiff resistance. District hopes to cut its spending on
private schools, agencies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An effort by the Los Angeles Unified School District to offer special
education services at public schools rather than pay for care at more
costly private schools and agencies has helped trigger a wave of
litigation, primarily from parents in West Los Angeles and the west
San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   A growing contingent of parents is dissatisfied with the shift
toward in-house services, an approach advocated by Roy Romer shortly
after he was named district superintendent two years ago. Partly as a
result, Romer said, the number of requests for special legal hearings
to resolve disputes has doubled since 1999 to nearly 1,000 annually.</LD>
<LD>   The district is legally obligated to tailor an education plan to
each of its 86,000 special education students who have disabilities
ranging from traumatic brain injury to auditory processing
difficulties. When a parent and the district disagree over a plan,
either can request mediation or a hearing before a state officer to
settle disputes.</LD>
<TE>   Some parents and attorneys say school officials purposely are
denying services to cut costs, knowing that few parents have the
resources to hire an attorney to challenge the district.</TE>
<TE>   "The public system doesn't have the tools, the trained staff or
the capabilities to serve these kids," said Raja Marhaba, a Granada
Hills parent who has recently hired a lawyer to attain private
services for her two children. "There are kids falling through the
cracks."</TE>
<TE>   The district now spends about $145 million a year on outside
contractors and private schools for special education services that
are unavailable in district schools. That's more than double the
amount paid in 1997. The costs are worrisome to a cash-strapped
district that earlier this year scrambled to make cuts--even
increasing class size in some grades--to avert a budget shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   District officials say they will soon be able to provide better
special education services within public schools at a far lower cost.
Moreover, they say, a federal consent decree requires that the
district accommodate more special education students in regular
classrooms; a massive initiative is already planned to move students
out of special centers and into the mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said some parents misinterpret the district's obligation to
provide a "free and appropriate public education" under federal law
to mean they can garner all the services for their children that they
see fit.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't allow a system to develop where there's a cottage
industry of suing the district," Romer said.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the rise in the number of hearings is that under
Romer the district has limited referrals to private schools that
aren't under district contract.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Lorant said that policy leaves her in a bind. What the
district is offering her son is "free and public," she said, "but
it's not appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   She said her 14-year-old son, David, who suffers from Tourette's
syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and
obsessive-compulsive disorder, was given a new lease on life when he
was admitted, at district expense, to a private academy in Sherman
Oaks three years ago. There, he made new friends and got straight A's
one semester.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, Lorant said, the district agreed during mediation
that it couldn't provide services that David needed in its public
schools. In May, however, the district notified her that it could
serve David in-house, offering him a placement at El Camino Real High
School, a public school in Woodland Hills. It no longer wanted to
reimburse the $18,000 a year tuition for the private school, but was
offering extra help with schoolwork, sessions with a counselor and a
special P.E. program.</TE>
<TE>   She refused the offer and now faces a hearing Sept. 26.</TE>
<TE>   "If I put him at El Camino, he would be in classes with 34 to 38
students as opposed to five to eight like he is now," Lorant said.
"He really struggles socially. It would be a huge challenge for him."</TE>
<TE>   Mainstreaming Students</TE>
<TE>   Many parents favor mainstreaming their disabled children in
regular public schools, but they say the district first needs more
one-on-one therapists, classroom aides and smaller classroom sizes.
District officials say L.A. Unified suffers from a national shortage
of speech and language therapists, which has contributed to the rise
in requests for hearings.</TE>
<TE>   The district has no comprehensive record of how much money is
spent on such special education litigation. But a disproportionate
number of disputes appear to arise in L.A. Unified compared with
other districts in California, according to data kept by the
California Special Education Hearing Office.</TE>
<TE>   The district enrolls 13% of the state's disabled children, but
accounted for 34% of all hearing requests in California last year.
The greatest leap occurred in the 2000-01 school year, when the
district garnered 37% of the requests statewide compared with 23% the
previous year, when there was no private school policy.</TE>
<TE>   More than half of the requests in L.A. Unified come from the more
affluent areas of West L.A. and the West Valley. The three
subdistricts covering those areas (districts A, C, and D) account for
23% of L.A. Unified's special education population, but accounted for
62% of the district's 934 hearing requests in the 2000-01 school
year.</TE>
<TE>   Parents' Demands</TE>
<TE>   District officials complain that heavy demand for services from
these parents takes services away from poorer parts of the city.</TE>
<TE>   "These [low-income] parents don't know their rights," said Regina
Davis, a Title I coordinator at Budlong Avenue Elementary School in
South Los Angeles. "We get parents from Mexico and they don't have a
clue. Some of them can't even read their own language. They need
advocates."</TE>
<TE>   Carol Graham, a Santa Monica lawyer who has been representing
disabled children in the district for six years, said the inequity
was not surprising.</TE>
<TE>   "On the Westside, the parents are more educated and they're
willing to fight," she said. "Parents elsewhere don't realize there
are lawyers who will take no retainer [fee]. I charge very little or
nothing because when we prevail, the school district pays us."</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the litigation in Los Angeles Unified stems in part
from ambiguities in the federal law.</TE>
<TE>   The sticking point is how to define "appropriate" education for
special education students. A 1996 federal court ruling on what level
of services a public school district should provide said it doesn't
need to be a "Cadillac." Instead, public schooling should be the
equivalent of a "Chevrolet," the court said.</TE>
<TE>   But school officials--and even some parents' attorneys--say that
L.A. Unified in the past sometimes gave parents "Cadillac" services.
Now the district is trying to correct what it sees as a costly
imbalance.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to get more than an equitable education," said
Donnalyn Jaque-Anton, assistant superintendent for special education
in L.A. Unified. "It's not about can I make you more eligible than
others for Harvard."</TE>
<TE>   Such parents as Elyse Wagner of Valley Village scoff at the
district's reasoning. Wagner is sometimes moved to tears when she
talks about her bureaucratic wrangling with the district. She has
spent the last 18 months trying to get vision therapy for her
13-year-old autistic son Michael, who has been in special education
since third grade because he has trouble processing information he
reads.</TE>
<TE>   The district suggested she send her son to one of three agencies
that contracts with the district for help, but she says the district
declined to pay for the services, and the only appointments the
contractors had conflicted with Michael's school schedule. Wagner
says she will have to seek a hearing to get what her son needs.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had nothing but fabulous relations with the district
until we hit this one issue," she said. "Rather than spend money on
children, the district would rather spend money on lawyers."</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified is not alone in grappling with the rising costs of
special education. Prompted by the growing demands of savvy parents,
shortfalls in federal funding and rising enrollments, many school
districts in the country have taken steps in recent years to make
special education more effective and efficient.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two years, New York City's public school system has
reduced the number of students in special education programs,
reasoning that many were referred there because they weren't being
taught appropriately in regular classrooms. The number of special
education students fell from 160,000 to 120,000, special education
funding was capped and more money was directed toward general
education.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the school system said litigation has not
increased, because the schools added services to ease the transition
of students into regular classes.</TE>
<TE>   Legal Costs Soar</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles Unified, the swelling ranks of special education
students have sent overall costs soaring and probably contributed to
rising litigation as well. Today, the district spends $1.2 billion on
special education, or 13% of its overall budget of $9 billion. Seven
years ago, half the students were enrolled and it cost half as much.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government has not helped as much as expected. It had
pledged to pay 40% of a school district's special education costs
when the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was enacted in
1975, but it never allocated the necessary funding.</TE>
<TE>   This is especially problematic in districts with huge enrollments,
like L.A. Unified. Last year, the federal government provided 6% of
L.A. Unified's special education budget, or $57 million, but it
covers an average of 17% of special education costs nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   The increase in litigation, in itself, is costly to the district.
Most cases are settled before the hearing officer can make a ruling,
but the district often must pay opposing attorney's fees. These fees
alone climbed from $547,000 in the 2000-01 school year, to $1.2
million last year.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the costs for the district's own attorneys--both
in-house and outside lawyers--exceeded $1.5 million last year, said
Harold Kwalwasser, general counsel for L.A. Unified.</TE>
<TE>   Adversarial Approach</TE>
<TE>   Opposing attorneys say the district has made matters worse by
taking a more adversarial approach over the last two years. It has
doubled in-house special education lawyers from three to six and has
plans to hire two more. It also has recently increased from one to
five the number of outside law firms contracted to litigate special
education disputes.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. Unified used to bend over backward to try and resolve
things," said Graham, the Santa Monica lawyer. "But now it's like a
pendulum that has swung the exact opposite way ... I think it has
gone too far."</TE>

<HD>Stooges' Straight Man Took His Laughs, Lumps</HD>
<DH>Tribute: A son keeps alive the legacy of his father, who
played foil to the comedy trio.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Floor-to-ceiling shelves stacked with boxes, filing cabinets packed
with cross-referenced folders, rows of chronologically arranged
binders: But for the movie posters on the walls, Saxon Sitka's rented
Camarillo office looks like a corner in the fluorescent depths of a
presidential library.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, it's a son's tribute to his departed dad--the longtime
straight man for the Three Stooges.</LD>
<LD>   Emil Sitka died four years ago at 83. Since then, Saxon has taken
charge of his father's voluminous legacy, just as Emil so stoically
took pies in the face, seltzer down the pants, pliers on the nose,
the slings and arrows of outrageous Stooges.</LD>
<TE>   After the actor's death, Saxon, a 47-year-old parts manager at a
Santa Monica auto dealership, meticulously organized a lifetime of
letters, unfinished manuscripts and memorabilia he discovered in his
father's Leisure Village home.</TE>
<TE>   Every three months, he draws material from the trove for one of
the fan world's more specialized newsletters: "The Fourth Stooge," a
loving look back at the man who played the butler, the banker and
other accident-prone authority figures in more than 40 films with the
slapstick trio.</TE>
<TE>   "I never even was that big a fan," Saxon said. "But people would
come up to me with all sorts of questions: 'What did Emil think of
Moe? What was Emil's favorite role?' I felt a responsibility to get
educated in a hurry."</TE>
<TE>   About 250 aficionados pay $10 each for annual subscriptions to
"The Fourth Stooge." This, after all, was an unusually outgoing
Stooge figure, sending cards to hundreds of fans each Christmas. At
fans' weddings, he would warble "Hold hands, you lovebirds!"--a
famous line from "Brideless Grooms," in which he portrayed a daffy
minister undone by the Stooges.</TE>
<TE>   "Emil was always my favorite non-Stooge player," said subscriber
Patrick Jordan, a newspaper ad salesman and crossword-puzzle designer
in Ponca City, Okla. "He had such a range, and he was so expert in
his pratfalls. The roles he played were almost as memorable as the
ones the Stooges did."</TE>
<TE>   His comic instincts had grim roots.</TE>
<TE>   Orphaned as a teenager, Emil Sitka hit the rails with his brother,
Rudy, and desperately looked for work during the Depression.</TE>
<TE>   After Emil died, Saxon Sitka found his father's unpublished
account of that bleak period, recalling the hunger, the squalid hobo
jungles and the sexual predators of the boxcars.</TE>
<TE>   For all that, young Emil managed to stay upbeat, as in his
description of a roadside feast in Washington state:</TE>
<TE>   "Many vegetables, a piece of white-lily (liverwurst) and hah Gawd,
a real big hunk of 'red-Mike' (jumbo baloney). This all became a
Mulligan stew at my deft hands, ahem. There was plenty of water
coming out of a pipe, so we even washed our feet. Some of the
drifters shaved. It was too, too de-lovely."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, he drifted to Hollywood, spurred by an early zest for
acting in church Passion plays. When he wound up as a butler in the
Stooges' 1947 "Half-Wits Holiday," he was ecstatic, according to one
of his journal entries excerpted in "The Fourth Stooge."</TE>
<TE>   "Their entire bodies are almost perfect 'clown-machines,' " he
marveled. "They squeak just as the situation demands, they jump
perfectly, they do everything instantly. Their bodies obey their
minds (for comedy) immediately. This came with experience. This is
what I want!"</TE>
<TE>   Readers of "The Fourth Stooge" peek at the Stooges through Emil's
eyes. They learn that in "All Gummed Up," the threesome blew
humongous bubbles not with gum but with condoms. They find out that
Shemp was a nervous wreck, who was scared of heights and so much
else.</TE>
<TE>   In "Hold that Lion," Shemp was "almost mesmerized with fear," Emil
wrote. "The lion's teeth had been removed, and it was old and sickly
looking with flies buzzing around its head. Sometimes it fell asleep
in the middle of a take. But Shemp wouldn't work in the same scene
with it, so the director had a large plate of glass put between the
lion and the Stooges while shooting."</TE>
<TE>   While the Stooges' mayhem frequently swamped Sitka's strait-laced
characters, he always left the set unharmed. But readers learn that
studio doctors dropped the ball after he took a vase in the face
during a non-Stooge film called "Billie Gets Her Man."</TE>
<TE>   "Blood squirted out of my nose," he wrote. "The hit caused a
bluish flash in my mind, and I thought my upper lip was paralyzed."</TE>
<TE>   He suffered severe headaches and frighteningly numb hands for
several years until a cracked bone in his neck was correctly
diagnosed.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the material in the newsletter was also news to Saxon
Sitka.</TE>
<TE>   One of seven children from Emil's failed first marriage, he never
paid much attention to the Stooges.</TE>
<TE>   "How many kids care about their parents' co-workers?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   After Emil's death, though, he sifted through memories by the box
load and dresser full, wondering what to do with it all. Saxon's
wife, Dorine, took a year off from her job at an auto dealership to
help organize it all.</TE>
<TE>   The actor left behind his fourth-grade report card from Costello
Elementary School in Pittsburgh, a letter from Charlton Heston
advising him to get a new agent, meal tickets from his days as a
hobo, scripts for Stooge projects never filmed, hundreds of pages
from his quest to be declared a conscientious objector in World War
II.</TE>
<TE>   He also left notes for a show-business memoir that Saxon vows to
complete.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it will turn a profit can't be predicted. Last year, Saxon
spent $10,000 on the newsletter and brought in only about $2,500.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not the point.</TE>
<TE>   "When I decided to finish his book, it was like a big weight
coming off my shoulders," he said. "Now I knew what to do. My father
had given me a big, positive indication. Now I had a purpose."</TE>

<HD>Outsider Talked Up for Chief</HD>
<DH>Search: John Timoney, who helped cut New York crime, is
LAPD 'candidate du jour.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the Los Angeles Police Commission works to narrow the list of
police chief candidates this week, John Timoney, an outside contender
who attracted little notice at first, has caught the fancy of a
number of city officials.</LD>
<LD>   Ever since the former Philadelphia police commissioner arrived in
Los Angeles a week ago to interview for the city's top cop job, City
Hall politicos have been talking about the Irish-immigrant officer,
who spent most of his career in the NYPD. Some are impressed by his
style, others by his record at two of the nation's largest police
agencies. Still others say they like that he has gone about his quest
for the job with little fanfare.</LD>
<LD>   There's no guarantee that Timoney, 54, will make the cut when the
commission meets to deliberate Tuesday and attempts to narrow the
field to three. But for now, the affable policeman has turned heads
among city decision-makers, who say they have found his candor and
down-to-earth style refreshing.</LD>
<TE>   One sign of the impression Timoney has made: There have been
numerous failed attempts in private conversations throughout City
Hall to imitate his Irish-New York accent, which Timoney's friends
call the "Bronx brogue."</TE>
<TE>   "He's the candidate du jour," said one ranking city official.
"It's the flavor they like today."</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm hearing is that they like the Irish guy from New York,"
said political consultant Rick Taylor. City officials knew little
about Timoney when they began their search to replace former Chief
Bernard C. Parks.</TE>
<TE>   There are 13 finalists for the chief's position--all but five of
them are either current or former members of the LAPD. At different
times in the process, city officials have been enamored of a number
of the candidates. Early on, Portland Police Chief Mark Kroeker, a
former LAPD deputy chief, seemed to be a favorite. Then, when Bill
Bratton, former commissioner of the New York Police Department,
announced that he was seeking the job, the buzz around City Hall was
that Bratton's credentials would make him hard to beat.</TE>
<TE>   Among LAPD insiders, speculation has centered on Deputy Chief
David Kalish, a favorite of some city leaders who believe he would
bring new direction to the LAPD without the risk of hiring a chief
from outside the department.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, however, much of the focus has shifted to Timoney,
who was the second in command under Bratton. He took over the
Philadelphia Police Department in 1998 but stepped down shortly after
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to work as a private consultant for a
New York City security firm.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got a pretty outgoing personality and wins people over,"
said one City Hall insider. "But anything could happen. Honestly, I
think it's totally wide open."</TE>
<TE>   In one of his few interviews about his decision to apply for the
LAPD job, Timoney said he wants the chance to overhaul the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   "I see it as a great challenge," he said. "And I find challenges
invigorating."</TE>
<TE>   Officials who have met with Timoney said that he appears to
understand how to motivate rank-and-file police officers, while at
the same time seeming sensitive to civil liberties issues.</TE>
<TE>   Also, his experience in running large law enforcement
organizations has impressed some lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   He helped Bratton cut crime in New York City, and he is credited
with cleaning up the Philadelphia Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   What Timoney does not have, however, is specific knowledge of Los
Angeles, either geographically or politically. In fact, he has been
to the city only twice in his life.</TE>
<TE>   Timoney said he recognizes that some people in Los Angeles want an
insider, but he said that he is "a quick study." He notes that he was
new to Philadelphia when he took over as head of the police
department there.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like I'm a history teacher applying to be a brain
surgeon," he said. "I've worked in two big city police departments.
I've worked as a consultant for police departments around the world.
The issues are the same."</TE>
<TE>   Timoney's supporters say he would easily learn Los Angeles and
relate to the city's diverse immigrant communities.</TE>
<TE>   Timoney and his family immigrated to the United States from
Ireland when he was 13. After his father died of cancer, he helped
support his family in New York City. In 1969, he joined the NYPD and
worked his way up.</TE>
<TE>   In Philadelphia, he pushed for a measure similar to Los Angeles'
"Special Order 40," which prohibits police from inquiring about the
immigration status of people who are either victims or perpetrators
of crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James Hahn's chief of staff, Tim McOsker, received positive
feedback about Timoney on his fact-finding missions to Philadelphia
and New York City--contributing to the buzz at City Hall. But Deputy
Mayor Matt Middlebrook cautioned that McOsker has picked up little
negative feedback on any of the candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "What has been reinforced for Tim in these discussions and for the
mayor and the Police Commission is, we have a good list of people,"
Middlebrook said. "Each of these candidates is going to bring a
basketful of experience and pros and cons with him. The mayor has to
weigh all of those things."</TE>
<TE>   Timoney said he is pleased that city officials are giving him a
serious look.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be the LAPD chief," he said. Attempting a surfer's
accent, he added: "It would be totally awesome, dude."</TE>

<HD>Smog Risk Found Higher for Children</HD>
<DH>Health: A study shows that adults are less likely to
contract cancer as a result of pollution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A report by a Washington, D.C., environmental group says that
children in California are at greater risk of contracting cancer from
inhaling toxic air pollutants than adults.</LD>
<LD>   The study, which was to be released today and focused on five
areas of the state, maintains that a 2-week-old baby in the Los
Angeles region has already been exposed to more pollution than the
federal government deems acceptable over a lifetime.</LD>
<LD>   By age 18, the same child will have inhaled enough contaminants to
exceed the acceptable exposure level hundreds of times over,
according to the study.</LD>
<TE>   "The concentration of cancer-causing air pollution in California
is so great that, just by breathing this air, children will
accumulate cancer risks that are pretty astounding," said Andy
Igrejas, environmental health program director for the National
Environmental Trust, the advocacy group that produced the report.</TE>
<TE>   "This underscores the urgency of efforts to reduce the cancer
risks. We have such a long way to go for the air to be healthy," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The study examined pollution concentrations in the Los Angeles
region, the Bay Area, the San Joaquin Valley, the Sacramento Valley
and San Diego. The findings echo those of other studies, including a
report prepared three years ago by U.S. Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los
Angeles).</TE>
<TE>   California is the nation's smoggiest state and researchers have
long known that air pollution contains a mix of industrial and
automotive chemicals. Solvents, metals and unburned fuel not only
contribute to smog and haze, but can cause cancer, reproductive harm
and neurological damage.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there is disagreement over just how harmful toxic emissions
are and what should be done to reduce risks.</TE>
<TE>   "If you live in an urbanized, industrialized society with a
growing economy you're going to be exposed to some level of toxic air
pollution," said Jerry Martin, spokesman for the California Air
Resources Board.</TE>
<TE>   Toxic Emissions</TE>
<TE>   Each year, 102,000 tons of the most common toxic emissions are
released in California. Traces of benzene from gasoline fumes,
hexavalent chromium from metal-plating shops and diesel exhaust from
trucks and buses are widespread.</TE>
<TE>   In the four-county Los Angeles region, the state air board
estimates toxic air contaminants cause 720 cancer cases per million
people annually--a risk almost 1,000 times greater than the federal
government's acceptable limit.</TE>
<TE>   That federal benchmark, however, is extraordinarily conservative.
It seeks to limit the odds of a person's contracting cancer from
contaminants to one chance in one million. In contrast, the risk of
getting cancer from sources such as food, cigarette smoke or X-rays,
is about one in five.</TE>
<TE>   Melanie Marty, chief of the air toxicology unit at the California
Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, said children are
more vulnerable to pollutants.</TE>
<TE>   They are more active and inhale relatively more air than adults,
have less well-developed immune systems and undergo rapid growth,
during which cells are more vulnerable to attack by carcinogens.
Further, she said, some animal studies show that exposure to toxic
chemicals early in life increases the risk of cancer in adult years.</TE>
<TE>   "They are making some leaps in the way they estimate risk" in the
new report, Marty said, "but their major point, that children have
higher exposures than adults, that's not disputed."</TE>
<TE>   But do kids get more cancer as a result? That is unclear, experts
say. Theoretical risks do not always translate into actual cancer
cases.</TE>
<TE>   In a study published earlier this year, researchers from the state
Department of Health Services and the Public Health Institute in
Berkeley failed to detect any significant increase in childhood
cancer among 7,000 children living near freeways, where toxic air
pollution is substantial.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, smoggy California communities do not appear to have
more deaths caused by lung cancer than other places. According to the
state health department, Los Angeles County, one of the smoggiest
places in the nation, averages 42 lung cancer deaths per 100,000
people annually, the eighth-lowest rate in the state and lower than
the rates for rural Modoc and San Luis Obispo counties. Experts
caution, however, that lung cancer comparisons are tricky because the
disease has many causes.</TE>
<TE>   More Controls Sought</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, environmentalists, physicians and some parents have
sought stronger protections to safeguard children from pollution.</TE>
<TE>   "We're finding shocking information about levels of exposure,"
Waxman said. "It's higher than anticipated and I'm concerned about
the impacts on children. We have got to redouble our efforts to
control toxic air pollution. It is a wake-up call to all of us."</TE>
<TE>   Under a 3-year-old state law, California has stepped up its
monitoring of toxic air contaminants in communities and undertaken a
review of state air pollution standards to ensure they protect
children.</TE>
<TE>   State health officials also have identified five toxic
contaminants deemed especially harmful to children, and are preparing
new measures to reduce them. Diesel exhaust is one of the worst
sources, studies show, and dozens of smoky, old school buses are
being replaced with cleaner models across Southern California to
reduce children's exposure to diesel soot.</TE>

<HD>Documents Demanded in Westin Investigation</HD>
<DH>Colleges: Lawyers say papers would prove that the Ventura
County chancellor misspent public funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lawyers have turned up the heat against the Ventura County Community
College District, demanding that the board of trustees hand over
documents they contend will prove the chancellor misspent hundreds of
thousands of dollars in public money.</LD>
<LD>   The letter sent to the board last week also demanded minutes from
a private meeting held by the board May 28, which attorneys say will
prove the five trustees awarded Chancellor Philip Westin a
$30,000-a-year raise, in violation of the Brown Act, the state's
open-meetings law.</LD>
<LD>   The request is the latest development in a spending scandal
involving Westin, the board and other high-level district officials
that has enveloped the community college district since early summer.</LD>
<TE>   The demand by the Quisenberry Law Firm in Los Angeles and Benton,
Orr, Duval &amp; Buckingham of Ventura follows a lawsuit filed in July on
behalf of plaintiffs Gerald Leavitt and Gerard Kapuscik and Ventura
County taxpayers, alleging financial improprieties.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit contends Westin's contract should be rescinded because
the board discussed and awarded Westin's raise during a meeting
closed to the public. The Brown Act requires that discussions
regarding salary increases for public officials take place in open
forums, the lawsuit states.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also outlines other allegations, among them that Westin
and board President Norman Nagel charged the district $3,000 for a
trip to Cuba and that Westin charged $1,976 to the district to rent a
Pontiac Grand Prix for his personal use in September and October
2001, while paying him for mileage, automobile repairs and other
related expenses for his personal vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   It also alleges that Westin was reimbursed $1,600 for an outdoor
lighting system purchased for his home and that Westin and Vice
Chancellor Michael Gregoryk awarded a $5-million contract to an
electrical firm while failing to follow the district's bidding
policy.</TE>
<TE>   Westin, who spent $119,000 over four years on car expenses,
computer equipment and meals, maintains he did nothing wrong or
illegal. He was placed on paid administrative leave in July while the
board investigates the latest allegations. Nagel has said he doesn't
know when the probe will be concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Trustee Bob Gonzales, the police chief of Santa Paula, said he has
no problem releasing the material to the law firms or anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they have a right to have those documents," Gonzales
said. "I think everything they're asking for is something we've
already seen. We've had the FBI look at it, the D.A.'s office, and
there's nothing illegal. Maybe the taxpayers think they can find
something."</TE>

<HD>2 Men Reach Climbing Milestone on El Capitan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK</DL>
<LD>With headlamps lighting the way out of the abyss, two rock climbers
scrambled atop El Capitan and stepped into the record books.</LD>
<LD>   Hans Florine and Steve Gerberding, two of the best climbers in the
world, each scaled the 3,000-foot wall for the 100th time Saturday,
setting a mark that once seemed unreachable and demonstrating just
how much the sport has evolved in half a century.</LD>
<LD>   Two helmet-mounted headlamps appeared among the rocky outcroppings
on a ledge about 9 p.m., and a weary voice cried out, "Yowww!"</LD>
<TE>   After 14 hours of nonstop climbing, Gerberding, 42, a climbing
instructor from Joshua Tree, sprawled on the rock and said it would
take a few days for the personal milestone--19 years in the
making--to sink in.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're wasted, nothing feels that special," he said.
"Special would be if there's a helicopter up here."</TE>
<TE>   As the two contemplated how they were going to get down,
Gerberding vomited from a combination of exhaustion and dehydration.
"I'm not going to die. I'm just beat, dude," he said.</TE>
<TE>   El Capitan was not conquered until 1958, five years after
mountaineers reached the summit of Mt. Everest. At 7,000 feet, it
casts an imposing shadow over Yosemite Valley, a glacier-shaped
canyon at 4,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   It was considered unassailable until new techniques and equipment
were developed after World War II. It wasn't seriously attempted for
another decade.</TE>
<TE>   The first ascent, led by Warren Harding, took 45 days. The second
took less than a week.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the fastest climbers, including Florine, 38, a marketing
representative for a San Francisco gym company, have made it up the
most direct route in less than four hours.</TE>
<TE>   Those who can reach the top in less than 24 hours are a new breed
of climber, taking less equipment, moving faster and taking greater
risks.</TE>
<TE>   Like other extreme sports, where fewer firsts remain, the emphasis
among a core of elite athletes is on speed or some other measure of
accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   With Saturday's climb, which shattered the previous 22-hour mark
for that route, Florine has 13 records on El Capitan.</TE>

<LD>The Minnesota Twins refused to be contracted. Instead, they
conquered.</LD>
<LD>   The small-market survivors that baseball couldn't eliminate made
sure their unexpected season will include a trip to October's
postseason.</LD>
<LD>   The Twins, targeted for contraction last November by Commissioner
Bud Selig, clinched the American League Central on Sunday with a 5-0
victory over the defending champion Cleveland Indians.</LD>
<TE>   "Bud Selig couldn't get rid of us," Jacque Jones said during a
wild celebration in Minnesota's clubhouse. "The White Sox couldn't
get rid of us. The Cleveland Indians couldn't get rid of us. Here we
are, and we're staying."</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Lohse (13-8) pitched six shutout innings as the Twins secured
their first playoff appearance since 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long haul," Manager Ron Gardenhire said. "It started
[last] winter when they tried to kick us out and take away our team."</TE>
<TE>   After doing their part by winning, the Twins had to put their
postgame party plans on hold for about 20 minutes as they waited for
the outcome of Chicago's game in New York.</TE>
<TE>   When the second-place White Sox lost, 8-4, at Yankee Stadium in a
game called because of rain, it was time to celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 6, Oakland 3--Bret Boone and Edgar Martinez each drove in
two runs at Oakland as the Mariners finally found some offense and
ended a six-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez hit a two-run homer, Mike Cameron added a solo shot and
Boone had three hits as Seattle ended a 21-inning scoreless drought
and ended Oakland's 12-game home winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland dropped a game behind the first-place Angels in the AL
West.</TE>
<TE>   After a rough first inning, starter Joel Pineiro (14-6) settled
down to retire 10 of the next 11 batters before giving up a solo
homer to John Mabry in the fifth inning.</TE>
<TE>   New York 8, Chicago 4--Alfonso Soriano, Jason Giambi and Bernie
Williams homered, and the Yankees cut their magic number to five in a
game called in the sixth inning after three rain delays at Yankee
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees had been outscored, 21-3, in losing the first two
games of the series and they had to rally after Miguel Olivo hit a
three-run homer in his first major league at-bat to give Chicago a
3-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 8, Boston 3--The visiting Orioles won for only the third
time in 22 games and pushed the Red Sox closer to elimination from
postseason play. Boston, which has 14 games left, is 9 1/2 games
behind the AL East-leading Yankees and nine games behind the
wild-card leading A's.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Batista set a Baltimore record for homers by a third baseman.
His two-run homer in the third inning was his 29th as a third baseman
this season, eclipsing Brooks Robinson's 28 in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 9, Detroit 3--Joe Randa tripled and scored three runs
as the Royals won their second in a row and extended their lead in
the AL Central over the last-place Tigers to five games.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game at Detroit, the Tigers honored longtime
broadcaster Ernie Harwell, who is retiring after 55 years as a major
league announcer, 42 with the Tigers. A statue of Harwell was
unveiled inside the entrance to Comerica Park.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 7, Toronto 4--Joe Kennedy gave up three hits over seven
innings at Toronto as the Devil Rays ended a six-game skid.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Winn drove in two runs for the Devil Rays, who have won only
two of their last 13 games. They lost their 100th game Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Injury May Sideline Anderson Tonight</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Left fielder Garret Anderson (strained right hamstring) may miss the
opener of a four-game American League West showdown with the Oakland
Athletics beginning tonight at Network Associates Coliseum, Manager
Mike Scioscia said.</LD>
<LD>   Anderson sat out Sunday's 13-4 victory against the Texas Rangers
at Edison Field after suffering the strain on an infield hit in the
third inning of Saturday's 8-6 victory. Although the strain is
considered to be mild, Scioscia said he would not take any chances
with the club's top run producer, batting .314 with a team-leading 26
home runs and 114 runs batted in.</LD>
<LD>   "We'll see, but if he needs another day we'll give it to him," he
said. "Although we're at a juncture of the season where we're going
to be looking to play through some things, there's still enough
baseball left to where we've got to make sure that these guys aren't
at risk out there."</LD>
<TE>   Anderson said he was not sure if he would be able to play today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia declined to reveal his rotation plans for the Oakland
series, but the Angels are expected to bring back left-hander Jarrod
Washburn and right-hander Kevin Appier on three days' rest to start
Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn, the Angel staff ace, would face Oakland 17-game winner
Mark Mulder, and Appier would be matched up against 21-game winner
Barry Zito.</TE>
<TE>   Fatigue and arm strength are concerns when starters work on short
rest at this stage of the season, but pitching coach Bud Black
believes Washburn and Appier would be up to the challenge if Scioscia
calls on them.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn is coming off a strong 7 1/3-inning outing Friday in a
victory against Texas. Appier lasted only 3 1/3 innings--throwing 81
pitches--in Saturday's victory.</TE>
<TE>   "He was short enough on pitches, so he could come back a little
earlier," Scioscia said.</TE>

<KH>CLEVELAND 20, CINCINNATI 7</KH>
<HD>Browns Don't Let This One Get Away</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>No hurled helmets, no haunting ending. The Cleveland Browns let
Cincinnati quarterback Gus Frerotte provide the follies this time.</LD>
<LD>   Frerotte heaved a pass with his left hand to avoid a sack, and
Kenard Lang returned the interception 71 yards to set up a pivotal
touchdown as Cleveland rolled to a 20-7 victory over the Bengals
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly Holcomb had another solid game as Tim Couch's fill-in,
throwing for two touchdowns and 198 yards behind a depleted line as
the Browns (1-1) sliced up an overmatched defense.</LD>
<TE>   Linebacker Dwayne Rudd promised fans a great performance to atone
for his helmet-throwing blunder a week earlier, which let Kansas City
get a 40-39 win. The defense didn't have to be great against the
Bengals, who got their first touchdown of the season when the game
was out of hand in the closing minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The helmet fiasco was forgotten--for now.</TE>
<TE>   "It only shuts the door if we are able to go out and do what we
are capable of, and that's making the playoffs," said Rudd, who had
only one tackle. "We won't want to be one win away from the playoffs
and have everybody look back to last week as the reason we didn't
make it."</TE>
<TE>   Phil Dawson made field goals of 52 yards--the longest of his
career--and 45 in front of the largest crowd in Cleveland Browns
Stadium's four-year history. The Browns sold 73,358 tickets for the
game.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd roared when Cincinnati's T.J. Houshmandzadeh was flagged
for taking off his helmet in the closing minutes to fix his chin
strap.</TE>
<TE>   The Bengals fell to 0-2, having been outscored, 54-13, in reviving
their reputation as the NFL's worst team since 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati running back Corey Dillon ran for 108 yards, caught a
team-high eight passes and had to leave to get intravenous fluids for
dehydration late in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Frerotte got most of his yards in the waning minutes and finished
26 for 47 for 239 yards.</TE>

<HD>Chargers Take Carr for a Ride</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Houston Texan rookie quarterback David Carr didn't have a chance.</LD>
<LD>   The San Diego Chargers sacked Carr nine times Sunday to beat the
expansion team 24-3 before 56,098 at Qualcomm Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   "We attacked them all day," said Charger defensive end Marcellus
Wiley, who got two of the sacks.</LD>
<TE>   The Chargers are 2-0 under new Coach Marty Schottenheimer. The
Texans fell to 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   "It was uphill the whole time," said Carr. "I've never played in a
game like that. I'm just going to get in an ice bucket with a snorkel
and come back next week."</TE>
<TE>   Carr, a Fresno State standout, was sacked six times last week but
rallied to complete 10 of 22 passes, including two touchdowns, as the
Texans beat the Dallas Cowboys, 19-10, the first opening-day win by
an expansion team in three decades.</TE>
<TE>   But the Charger defense was tougher.</TE>
<TE>   Carr completed only six of 25 passes for 87 yards, was intercepted
twice and fumbled in the end zone for a Charger touchdown. Seven of
the nine sacks came in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Junior Seau set up the Chargers' second touchdown by
intercepting a Carr pass at the Houston 31-yard line and bulldozing
his way to the six-yard line. Three plays later, wide receiver Curtis
Conway scored on a three-yard reverse.</TE>
<TE>   Schottenheimer praised his defense, criticized his special teams
for punt coverage and let people make up their own minds about the
offense.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't play real artistically in some phases of our game,"
Schottenheimer said. " ... We feel very confident we can play better
than we did."</TE>
<TE>   Charger quarterback Drew Brees completed 15 of 28 passes for 163
yards and one touchdown, a 35-yard toss to Conway for the Chargers'
first score. Conway caught five passes for 113 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "Just to be 2-0 at this point feels good," said Conway, "but I'm
not getting over my head because last year we opened at 3-0 and ended
5-11."</TE>
<TE>   Charger running back LaDainian Tomlinson gained 84 yards in 27
carries. The Texans' James Allen had 51 yards in 13 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Along with a 36-yard field goal by Steve Christie, the Chargers
also scored a touchdown in the fourth quarter when defensive end
Raylee Johnson recovered a Carr fumble in the end zone. Carr had been
sacked by rookie linebacker Ben Leber, who had three.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun to play on this team," said Leber. "When we're clicking
we feel we can dominate."</TE>
<TE>   The Texans' only score was a 45-yard field goal by Kris Brown. The
Chargers led, 17-3, at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers played without strong safety Rodney Harrison (groin).
Cornerback Quentin Jammer, the recently-signed first-round draft
choice, did not suit up.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Charger fans waiting for the arrival of
Marty-ball--Schottenheimer's preference for running plays and short
passes and aversion to more adventuresome attempts--got it in the
second half. The Chargers' Darren Bennett punted 10 times,
second-most in team history.</TE>
<TE>   The half's only score was Johnson's fumble recovery.
Schottenheimer said he was responding to the Texans' tough-tackling
defense.</TE>
<TE>   "We got a little conservative," he said. "My personality is when
you get into a fistfight like that, then get into a fistfight. Let's
not skirt the issue."</TE>

<KH>JACKSONVILLE 23, KANSAS CITY 16</KH>
<HD>Jaguars Save Best for Last</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>For three quarters, Kansas City's shaky defense made good on its vow
to cut down on long gainers. Jacksonville needed only a few minutes
to change that.</LD>
<LD>   On consecutive plays in the fourth quarter, the Jaguars produced a
team-record 79-yard touchdown pass play and a 63-yard scoring run to
beat the Chiefs, 23-16, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "We knew that was going to be the way we took our shots," said
Jaguar Coach Tom Coughlin. "We pointed toward the fourth quarter. We
were picking and picking and picking, and then we made a couple of
big plays."</LD>
<TE>   The Chiefs tied the score at 9-9 on Morten Andersen's third field
goal with just under seven minutes to play in the game.</TE>
<TE>   A moment later, Patrick Johnson took Mark Brunell's pass at the
40, shook off one tackler, outran another and scored the tie-breaking
79-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   After the Chiefs punted, the Jaguars (1-1) added what proved to be
the decisive touchdown on their next play. Fred Taylor burst through
a gaping hole and sped 63 yards to the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure what happened," Chief defensive end Ritchie Owens
said. "I didn't think the play was going to do much. Then I look up
and he's banging his head on the goal post. We hold them to just nine
points. And then on two plays in the fourth quarter, it all blows up
on us."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, who missed almost all of last season with a groin injury,
had 114 yards in 20 carries for the rebuilding Jaguars, who had lost
11 of their last 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   "I just kept trying to pound away and pound away, and finally
things just broke open for me," Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   The Chiefs (1-1) pulled within a touchdown on Trent Green's
12-yard touchdown pass to Tony Gonzalez with 2:35 left. The catch,
which capped an 80-yard drive that took up only 34 seconds, was
initially not allowed. But the Chiefs asked for a review and it was
determined that Donovin Darius had pushed Gonzalez out of bounds in
the back of the end zone.</TE>

<KH>MIAMI 21, INDIANAPOLIS 13</KH>
<HD>Defense, Williams Pave the Way for Dolphins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Miami Dolphins didn't need Ricky Williams to win a personal
battle against Edgerrin James. They needed him to be his big,
bruising self.</LD>
<LD>   Williams ran for 132 yards and caught a touchdown pass, and the
Dolphin defense stopped the Colts at the Miami two-yard line on the
game's last play to preserve a 21-13 victory Sunday. It was Miami's
fifth consecutive win in Indianapolis.</LD>
<LD>   The Dolphins (2-0) forced three turnovers and rode Williams'
running to victory, sticking to Coach Dave Wannstedt's plan.</LD>
<TE>   The game featured two of the NFL's premier runners, and neither
disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who was passed over by the Colts in favor of James in
the 1999 NFL draft, carried 24 times and averaged 5.5 yards. He
became the first Miami player with back-to-back 100-yard games since
Bernie Parmalee in 1994. He's also the first Dolphin to open the
season with two 100-yard games since Mark Higgs in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   James also played well. In his first home game since Oct. 21,
2001, James cut sharply and ran hard--looking almost fully recovered
from surgery on his left knee nearly 10 months ago. He finished with
30 carries for 138 yards, eight receptions for 82 yards, and broke
Eric Dickerson's team record with his 25th career 100-yard game.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fun watching him," Williams said. "He can run, can cut, he
can stop on a dime. He can hit the seams."</TE>
<TE>   While James outshone Williams, the Dolphin offense performed with
more power and precision than the Colts (1-1)--and that proved to be
the difference.</TE>
<TE>   Williams gained much of his yardage by running inside, then
breaking free into the Colt secondary. "I took it upon myself to make
sure I did whatever I could to get back to my Texas days, where I did
break a lot of runs," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   His performance was perfectly complemented by Jay Fiedler's short,
accurate passing game.</TE>
<TE>   Fiedler was 13 for 18 for 187 yards and two touchdowns--one to
Williams, the other to Rob Konrad. The quarterback also ran for a
one-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   It was an ugly home opener for the Colts, who spent much of the
off-season trying to fix two major problems: a defense that allowed
too many points and an offense that turned the ball over too
frequently.</TE>
<TE>   Things didn't look much different Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Peyton Manning was 26 for 45 for 289 yards and one touchdown, but
threw three interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   The defense also appeared to take a step back, giving up 342 yards
and again struggling to stop the run. Miami averaged 4.8 yards per
carry.</TE>
<TE>   With the Colts trailing 21-3 at halftime, fans booed in disgust.</TE>
<TE>   Things got worse early in the third quarter after the Colts drove
to the Miami two. James was stopped on four consecutive plays even
though one replay showed him scoring.</TE>
<TE>   "I should have challenged the one on third down," Colt Coach Tony
Dungy said. "It looked like he was laying in the end zone."</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis couldn't mount a rally until the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Manning threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Marvin Harrison with
9:11 left, and Mike Vanderjagt kicked a 23-yard field goal with 2:54
to go, making it 21-13.</TE>
<TE>   The Colts got one more chance, moving quickly from their 16 to the
Miami two, but Manning's final pass fell incomplete.</TE>

<KH>DALLAS 21, TENNESSEE 13</KH>
<HD>Carter Saves Cowboys and His Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>IRVING, Texas</DL>
<LD>Standing on the blue star at midfield, his head and arms pointed at
the hole in the Texas Stadium roof, Quincy Carter let it all go.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever anger, bitterness or other emotions he had felt all week
didn't matter anymore. He had just thrown his second touchdown pass
and was leading the Dallas Cowboys to a 21-13 victory over the
Tennessee Titans on Sunday, securing his job and possibly saving the
team's season.</LD>
<LD>   Both were in jeopardy after Dallas was humiliated by the expansion
Houston Texans in last week's opener. But as Carter danced to the
sideline after his best pass of the season, his display showed that
he knew he was back in charge.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm starting to be a leader on this team," said Carter, who was
14 of 24 passing for 240 yards, one shy of his career best, with no
interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Carter won his third consecutive game at home and improved to 5-6
as a starter for a team that's 11-23 since the start of the 2000
season. His status was questioned, though, after he threw for only
131 yards against the Texans with as many near-interceptions as
completions.</TE>
<TE>   Critics were after him too, and Carter seemed to be listening for
the first time. His trademark confidence had been replaced by
defensiveness.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Quincy is a competitor, and I'll go into war with a
competitor any day," Dallas Coach Dave Campo said.</TE>
<TE>   The Titans (1-1) were in control the first 2 1/2 quarters, despite
quarterback Steve McNair suffering a mild concussion when he ran into
an equipment trunk on the Dallas sideline midway through the second
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "It kind of stunned me," McNair said. "My neck was a little sore,
but I was OK after that. It didn't hinder me at all."</TE>
<TE>   He returned for the third quarter with Tennessee leading 10-7. In
the second series of the half, McNair threw the game-changing pass
when safety Darren Woodson hit his arm as he threw. Linebacker Dexter
Coakley caught the wobbly ball and returned it 52 yards for a
touchdown, giving Dallas its first lead of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The Cowboys were expecting big plays from their defense this
season, but didn't get any against the Texans. This game featured
Coakley's return and Greg Ellis' sack of McNair for an eight-yard
loss on third-and-nine with 2:31 left.</TE>
<TE>   Emmitt Smith had 59 yards in 18 carries, moving him 414 yards from
becoming the NFL's career rushing leader.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Giants Shuffle Rotation in Effort to Gain Edge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>San Francisco Giant Manager Dusty Baker shuffled his rotation over
the weekend so that right-hander Jason Schmidt, who is 2-0 with a
1.84 earned-run average against the Dodgers, will start the opener of
a crucial four-game series in Dodger Stadium tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Dodger Manager Jim Tracy made a similar move two weeks ago so that
right-hander Hideo Nomo, who has a career 10-3 record and 2.52 ERA
against the Giants, could start last Wednesday's game in Pacific Bell
Park and tonight's game at home.</LD>
<LD>   Nomo also has had success against the Giants' two top hitters,
limiting Barry Bonds to a .219 average (7 for 32) with two homers and
four runs batted in and Jeff Kent to a .179 average (7 for 39) with
two homers and three RBIs.</LD>
<TE>   The hard-throwing Schmidt, who has emerged as the staff ace in the
second half, was supposed to start Sunday against San Diego, but
Baker held him in favor of rookie Kurt Ainsworth, who gave up three
runs and three hits in 5 2/3 innings of the Giants' 4-1 loss to the
Padres.</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt, who gave up two runs and six hits and struck out six in 7
2/3 innings of the Giants' 5-2 win over the Dodgers on Tuesday, will
start on one extra day of rest. He gave up a run and four hits and
struck out 10 in seven innings of the Giants' 3-1 win over the
Dodgers on July 28.</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Ryan Jensen, who was scheduled to start Wednesday
night, was bumped from the rotation for the Dodger series.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious the move was made to set up the best matchups
possible," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger right-hander Andy Ashby, who gave up five runs and seven
hits in 4 1/3 innings Sunday, missed his previous start because of a
blister on the middle finger of his pitching hand; now left-hander
Odalis Perez has a blister on the middle finger of his pitching hand.</TE>
<TE>   But Perez, who was pulled from Saturday's 16-3 win over the
Rockies after five innings and 60 pitches, doesn't believe his
blister, which has bothered him for the last two starts, will prevent
him from pitching Thursday night.</TE>

<HD>Sunkosi Is Set for Trial</HD>

<AU>MARK RATZKY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trainer Beau Greely has waited a year to get Sunkosi back around the
tight turns at Fairplex. The circumstances are today's $50,000 Derby
Trial over a mile and a sixteenth, offering a rematch between last
season's Gateway to Glory hero Rainman's Request and Sunkosi, the
vanquished favorite that afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   After posting a romping maiden decision while sprinting over this
layout, Greely wheeled his colt back in the Gateway to Glory only
eight days later and he was sent off as the 3-2 choice.</LD>
<LD>   But it turned into Rainman's Request's day, however, as he set all
the fractions under a clever ride and lit up the board at 30-1, with
Sunkosi completing the exacta.</LD>
<TE>   Both of these sophomores have done solid, if not spectacular, work
in the interim, as Sunkosi had a nice allowance win at Hollywood Park
and is coming out of two Del Mar turf stakes, and Rainman's Request
comes off a solid try at Del Mar in a $40,000 seller.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's stakes victory here by the latter performer was
obviously not lost on trainer Pete Eurton, who put the claim tag in
last time for clients Alesia, Bram Jam Stable and Ciaglia, and has
given his charge five weeks off to get ready for a return to the site
of his greatest triumph.</TE>
<TE>   Another interesting member of the cast is National Park, who
looked as if he was developing into something special for trainer Bob
Hess Jr. in the spring, but has been a summer disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Twilight Career 2. Steep Climb 3. Nicole's Apollo 4.
Davene 5. Larry's First Lady 6. El Depressa 7. Native Vitality 8.
Crazy Larrys 9. Sunkosi 10.Steamed</TE>

<HD>Bears True to Form</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Another week, another close call for the Chicago Bears.</LD>
<LD>   Atlanta's Jay Feely missed a 45-yard field goal with 56 seconds
left and the Bears held on for a 14-13 victory Sunday, giving Chicago
its first 2-0 start since 1991.</LD>
<LD>   A week earlier, the Bears rallied from 10 points down in the
fourth quarter, defeating Minnesota, 27-23, when Jim Miller threw a
touchdown pass to David Terrell with 28 seconds left.</LD>
<TE>   Miller and Terrell hooked up for another touchdown against the
Falcons, a 14-yard play early in the third quarter that put Chicago
ahead to stay.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the Bears had to hold on at the end. They got help from
an overturned call and Feely's second miss of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Neither game has been pretty, but we'll take it," said Bear
receiver Dez White, who dropped a touchdown pass.</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Brian Urlacher was a dominant force against the Falcons
for the second year in a row. He recovered a fumble, sacked Michael
Vick twice and had a game-high 12 tackles.</TE>
<TE>   Vick put the Falcons (0-2) in position to win at the end, driving
them 44 yards with a quarterback draw and two completions.</TE>
<TE>   On second and one from the Chicago 28-yard line with a minute
left, Warrick Dunn was stopped for no gain, as was Vick on the next
play. Atlanta Coach Dan Reeves then decided to settle for a
field-goal attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Feely, who kicked a 52-yarder to force overtime the previous week
at Green Bay, hooked his kick a couple of feet wide of the left
upright, stunning the Georgia Dome sellout crowd of 68,459.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are easy kicks," Feely said. "I just didn't get the job
done for my team."</TE>
<TE>   Vick completed 17 of 28 passes for 166 yards, including a 10-yard
touchdown to Dunn. Vick also led the Falcons in rushing with 56 yards
in 10 carries.</TE>
<TE>   The Falcons, who managed only 78 yards in the second half, were
denied a big play with about four minutes left. Vick scrambled away
from a fierce rush and threw a pass that went through the hands of
Chicago safety Mike Brown. Falcon receiver Willie Jackson, sprawled
on the turf at the Chicago 22, appeared to make the catch. Vick
clasped his hands in thanks and Jackson had a big smile, but the
Bears challenged the call.</TE>
<TE>   After a review, referee Jeff Triplette said the ball had rolled
off Jackson's left arm and touched the turf before he cradled it.</TE>
<TE>   "That would've made a big difference in the game," Jackson said.</TE>

<HD>It Could Play Into Mosley's Hands</HD>

<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Promoter Bob Arum had barely had time to wipe the sweat off his brow
Saturday night after another close call for his boxing empire when he
began talking about Oscar De La Hoya's future, making Shane Mosley
the second-happiest fighter inside the Mandalay Bay Events Center.</LD>
<LD>   The happiest, of course, was De La Hoya, whose entourage partied
well into the early-morning hours Sunday after his 11th-round
technical knockout over Fernando Vargas not only established De La
Hoya as the most marketable boxer today but restored a reputation
tarnished by two losses, to Felix Trinidad Jr. and Mosley, in his
last five fights.</LD>
<LD>   In a remarkable concession, Arum, whose Top Rank remained on top
in its post-Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Leonard eras because of De La
Hoya, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal last week that the young
fighter out of East L.A. whom Arum signed off his gold-medal
performance in 1992 hadn't quite met expectations.</LD>
<TE>   "With everything he's done, it's less than I imagined it would
have been," Arum said. "I felt when he came out of the Olympics, he
had the capability to be among the one, two or three greatest
fighters of all time. For various circumstances, I don't think he's
achieved that, and time is running out for him to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Arum began to reassess Saturday night, declaring that the victory
over Vargas would be known as De La Hoya's "signature fight."</TE>
<TE>   "This was his best fight ever because he faced adversity, he
rebounded from adversity, and he ended it without relying on the
judges' decision," Arum said. "I can't think of another win I would
put in this category."</TE>
<TE>   It certainly was De La Hoya's most emotional victory. As a result,
he was hardly in the mood Saturday night for reflection. It was
statement enough for him that he had beaten Vargas, who had
challenged De La Hoya's manhood, had even challenged whether he was
worthy of his Mexican American heritage.</TE>
<TE>   When De La Hoya knocked down Vargas in the 11th with a powerful
left, De La Hoya did something he had never done before. He was so
excited that he performed a little stutter-step dance. The Oscar
Shuffle.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very satisfying really to see him down," De La Hoya said.
"I know it sounds bad coming from me, but it felt pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mosley, who watched at ringside, felt almost as excited. You could
tell by the smile on his face and the dollar signs spinning in his
eyes.</TE>
<TE>   He had by far the biggest payday of his career when he won a
decision over De La Hoya in the summer of 2000 at Staples Center. A
rematch seemed inevitable. Mosley offered one and then, in a rare and
humiliating position for the winning fighter, practically begged for
one.</TE>
<TE>   But De La Hoya was amid what will be recalled as his blue period
after losing for the second time in three fights and having a falling
out with Arum. De La Hoya also had a left wrist injury that required
surgery. His fight Saturday night was only his third since he lost to
Mosley, his first in almost 15 months.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, De La Hoya said he is "hungrier than ever." HBO
officials, who said that his fight against Vargas, when all the
numbers are in, will have generated the second-most pay-per-view buys
for non-heavyweights, believe the public might be hungrier than ever
for De La Hoya.</TE>
<TE>   So the standard millions will be available when De La Hoya, who
turns 30 in February, begins a so-called "exit strategy." Those are
Arum's words for De La Hoya's future in boxing, but they also could
apply to the promoter's because he has no fighters to sell to
pay-per-view audiences other than De La Hoya. De La Hoya probably
would have retired if he had lost to Vargas, and Arum probably would
have followed soon after.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy now, however, calls for De La Hoya to avenge losses
to Trinidad and Mosley before moving up against Bernard Hopkins in an
attempt to win a title in a sixth weight class.</TE>
<TE>   If Trinidad doesn't come out of retirement, and there is no
indication that he will, Mosley is next for De La Hoya, probably on
the Saturday before Cinco de Mayo.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's not only about the money for Mosley. Another reason he was
smiling is because he's confident of winning the rematch. He might
not be able to beat Vernon Forrest, whose style confounds him, but
Mosley said he didn't see anything Saturday that made him believe he
can't still beat De La Hoya.</TE>
<TE>   Lost in the euphoria over his dramatic victory was that De La Hoya
was hit with more punches and more stinging punches than ever before.
Although the conventional wisdom before the fight was that De La Hoya
had a significant quickness advantage, Vargas still connected on 43%
of his punches.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya's face was bloodied and bruised. His trainer, Floyd
Mayweather Sr., laughed about that--it wasn't his face--saying,
"Beautiful bodies don't win fights."</TE>
<TE>   But even Mayweather graded De La Hoya's performance as no better
than B-plus. Vargas clearly won the first, third and fifth rounds,
and even after that, there was a sense that he was only one solid
punch away from winning the fight.</TE>
<TE>   But he suffered a gash under the right eye in the sixth round. It
was revealed Sunday that doctors at the hospital after the fight had
treated him for a partial orbital bone fracture. It did not impair
his vision and is not expected to have any effect on career plans.</TE>
<TE>   More damaging, Vargas lost form as his conditioning failed him.</TE>
<TE>   His physical trainer quit immediately after the fight, claiming
there had been dissension in the camp between him and the
nutritionist. He claimed Vargas was not in shape to go the distance.</TE>
<TE>   If he had been, who knows what might have happened? As it was, he
was able to rally to win the ninth round.</TE>
<TE>   Mosley isn't as strong as Vargas, thus not the one-shot threat to
De La Hoya, but Mosley is much quicker.</TE>
<TE>   "If Oscar fights that same fight against me, I'll win," Mosley
said.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya didn't want to think about it yet. He had a party to
attend.</TE>

<LD>Bob Baffert--winner of Saturday's Kentucky Cup Juvenile and trainer
of the first four finishers in last Wednesday's Del Mar
Futurity--might have a full deck for next month's Breeders' Cup
Juvenile, but Patrick Biancone feels he'll go to Arlington Park with
a strong hand of his own.</LD>
<LD>   Biancone saddled Whywhywhy for a 1 3/4-length win in Sunday's
Belmont Futurity--as Baffert's Truckle Feature finished third--and in
another Breeders' Cup prep, he plans to run Zavata in the Champagne
at Belmont Park on Oct. 5.</LD>
<LD>   "He's a real fighter, he's got a big heart and I think he'll win
the Breeders' Cup," Biancone said of Whywhywhy, who overtook Truckle
Feature and then outkicked the second-place finisher, Pretty Wild, in
the Futurity, run over a wet track in a driving rainstorm. Ridden by
Edgar Prado, Whywhywhy ran the mile in 1:36 1/5, paying $5.20.</LD>
<TE>   Whywhywhy's sire, Mr. Greeley, is a nominated Breeders' Cup
stallion, but Biancone's colt was not nominated for the races Oct. 26
at Arlington and his owners, who include the trainer, would have to
pay a supplementary fee of $90,000 to run. That would seem to be an
easy decision after Whywhywhy won his third in a row, after a
second-place finish in his debut, and posted his first victory beyond
six furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Biancone predicted that Zavata, who won two earlier stakes before
running third in the Hopeful, will win the Champagne.</TE>
<TE>   In a Belmont race for 2-year-old fillies, trainer Shug McGaughey
won the Matron for the third time in the last four years as Storm
Flag Flying earned a 12 3/4-length win. Ridden by John Velazquez,
Dinny Phipps' filly was clocked in 1:38 2/5 for a mile and paid
$4.80. Wild Snitch was second.</TE>
<TE>   Storm Flag Flying's final Breeders' Cup prep is expected to be the
Fritzette at Belmont on Oct. 5.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Zippy Chippy remained winless in 96 races, finishing sixth by 5
1/2 lengths at the fair in Northampton, Mass.... Spunky Gal, ridden
by Scott Stevens and trained by Vladimir Cerin, won for the second
time in two weeks--first on grass, now on dirt--when she beat Lookn
Mighty Fine by 1 1/4 lengths in the $49,000 E.B. Johnston Stakes at
Fairplex Park.</TE>

18    SAN CLEMENTE  (1-0, SS-Div. II)      Victory over Edison might
                                           not be considered upset if

<HD>Freshmen Don't Dig High School Playing Rules</HD>
<DH>Volleyball: After getting used to more liberal club rules,
they struggle while trying to adjust to stricter requirements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As first practices go, this one was awful. Coach Cari Klein wanted
nothing more than to cover her face with a volleyball.</LD>
<LD>   It would have been easy to do. They were flying all over the place
in the L.A. Marymount High gym.</LD>
<LD>   The freshmen, bleary-eyed and bewildered, looked at Klein as if
she were clueless, which was unusual. Klein has won the last two
state girls' volleyball Division IV titles at Marymount.</LD>
<TE>   But this incoming group of freshmen had been used to club
volleyball rules markedly different from high school rules. Club
rules include:</TE>
<TE>   * Liberal passing techniques. Players can receive serves with
their hands, as if in a setting position, instead of "bumping" them
with their arms.</TE>
<TE>   * The libero, a back-row player that may freely substitute in and
out, unlike high school matches with a restricted number of
substitutions.</TE>
<TE>   * The "let serve," a served ball that is in play if it touches the
net and continues over to the other side. In high school matches, a
serve that touches the net is immediately whistled dead.</TE>
<TE>   * Point-per-serve, or "rally," scoring in every game, different
from the traditional side-out scoring of high school volleyball.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, Klein and high school coaches dislike the passing
rules in high school and feel the strict requirements are antiquated.</TE>
<TE>   Players can pass the ball with their hands in club, college and
Olympic volleyball, but are practically barred from doing so in high
school. They can attempt to use their hands in high school but are
almost always whistled for a "double-contact" if the pass is not
executed with absolute perfection--there must be no spin on the ball
when it leaves a player's hands.</TE>
<TE>   It is hardly worth the risk. As a result, high school coaches must
break the habits of freshmen and train them to pass with their arms.</TE>
<TE>   "They look at me like I'm speaking another language," Klein said.
"They look at me like this is my dumb rule. I keep explaining it's
not, but I get the feeling that they don't like it."</TE>
<TE>   The looser passing rules have been in effect in club for three
years. Only now is Klein starting to see it trickle down to freshmen,
who know no other way to pass if they have spent the last few years
on a club team.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Peterson, in her first year at Marymount, is one such
player. She has had trouble grasping the concept of passing with her
arms. Like other freshmen, she would prefer to use her hands.</TE>
<TE>   "You've been playing that way for years and as soon as you get to
high school volleyball, they switch all the rules," Peterson said.
"The rules should all be the same. It's very frustrating."</TE>
<TE>   Coaches agree.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard," said Santa Ana Mater
Dei Coach Craig Pazanti. "We're the only level not playing by those
rules. At some point, high school has got to catch up. It's a
completely different game."</TE>
<TE>   Susan Pescar coaches Long Beach Wilson, the No. 1 team in The
Times' preseason rankings. Pescar said her first practices this
season were like boot camps.</TE>
<TE>   "They come in and we're yelling all the time, 'Don't use your
hands, don't use your hands,' " she said. "We don't want to lose
matches because someone used their hands."</TE>
<TE>   Coaches have other complaints besides the rule itself. They feel
enforcement of the rule is somewhat inconsistent.</TE>
<TE>   It turns into a wait-and-see approach for coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "We wait until the other team uses their hands until we start
doing it," Klein said. "We don't want to lose a point if the referee
is going to call it. It's really a gray area."</TE>
<TE>   Some high school coaches, however, criticize club, college and
Olympic rules.</TE>
<TE>   "To me it degrades the beauty of the game if you let somebody grab
the ball and practically throw it up," Anaheim Esperanza Coach Kurt
Kersten said. "I hope high school never goes to the overhand pass.
There's not any skill involved."</TE>
<TE>   Said Newport Harbor Coach Dan Glenn: "In high school, you've got
to have better fundamentals. You've got to move your feet. You've got
to be athletic.</TE>
<TE>   "But we'll probably eventually be forced to play slop ball, like
they do in college and everywhere else."</TE>
<TE>   The California Interscholastic Federation has no plans to change
volleyball rules. A CIF spokesman said it would only happen if the
National Federation of State High School Assns. changes its rules.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, freshmen entrenched in club techniques will continue
to struggle with the difference in rules.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying hard, but they get mad at themselves," Klein said.
"It's hard to switch."</TE>

<KH>NEW ENGLAND 44, NEW YORK JETS 7</KH>
<HD>Patriots Continue to Roll</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The New England Patriots won the Super Bowl the hard way last season.
This season, they're making things look easy.</LD>
<LD>   The Patriots smothered the New York Jets, 44-7, Sunday as Tebucky
Jones and Victor Green scored touchdowns on defense and Tom Brady
threw two touchdown passes for an offense that totally controlled the
ball until it didn't matter any more.</LD>
<LD>   Adam Vinatieri kicked field goals of 28, 31 and 40 yards as the
Patriots won their eighth consecutive regular-season game, and 11th
in a row overall counting two playoff games and the Super Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   "They're a great team," Jet cornerback Donnie Abraham said. "They
really are and I think people have to start giving them credit. They
don't look like they're feeling the pressure of being the defending
Super Bowl champions. To me, it looks like they're having fun
defending their title."</TE>
<TE>   New England linebacker Mike Vrabel said the team's talent is clear
to see.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest thing for us, and it really showed today, is our
depth," Vrabel said. "We have a lot of good players, a lot of
personnel. It's hard to prepare for that. We're just a lot better
team than people give us credit for."</TE>
<TE>   Who can argue with that?</TE>
<TE>   This was the second consecutive week the Patriots were an underdog
against a team that was supposed to be a contender. They beat
Pittsburgh, 30-14, last Monday night in a game between the teams that
played in last season's AFC title game.</TE>
<TE>   It also was a dramatically different second game of the season
than last season, when the Jets knocked out Drew Bledsoe with a chest
injury, paving the way for Brady to take over and lead New England
from 0-2 to the Super Bowl title.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots led only 10-0 at halftime. But on the first series of
the second half, Jones blitzed from his free safety spot and stripped
Jet quarterback Vinny Testaverde of the ball, recovered the fumble
and returned it 24 yards for a touchdown that made it 17-0.</TE>
<TE>   The Jets went three and out and the Patriots ground out a 65-yard,
12-play drive to set up a 31-yard field goal by Vinatieri.</TE>
<TE>   The Jets finally scored late in the third quarter on Testaverde's
11-yard touchdown pass to Anthony Becht.</TE>

<HD>Kings Pursue Their Own</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saturday's signing of captain Mattias Norstrom to a four-year,
$14.5-million contract still left the Kings with four players who
will be eligible for unrestricted free agency next summer--goaltender
Felix Potvin, defenseman Aaron Miller and forwards Bryan Smolinski
and Craig Johnson.</LD>
<LD>   General Manager Dave Taylor would like to reduce that number.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings have held preliminary talks with Potvin and Miller about
contract extensions but have yet to approach Smolinski and Johnson,
though Taylor indicated the club would reach out to them soon.</LD>
<TE>   "If we can get some contracts into place right away," he said,
"we'd like to do that. Ultimately, we'd like to get all the
unrestricteds under contract."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the Kings failed to come to terms with then-captain
Rob Blake, a free agent to be, and the situation turned ugly, putting
a drag on the team until Blake was finally traded to the Colorado
Avalanche in February 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 2001, they retained Mathieu Schneider but lost
Luc Robitaille to the Detroit Red Wings. This summer, they lost
defenseman Philippe Boucher to the Dallas Stars and forward Kelly
Buchberger to the Phoenix Coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   The signing of Norstrom, they hope, signaled to their players a
commitment to winning. It was well received in the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   "I think obviously they learned from what happened with Rob a
couple years ago," Schneider said. "Rob did a tremendous job of
keeping it out of the dressing room, but it was there right down to
the end--trade rumors and so on.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same thing that might have happened with Matty, and to
have your captain in that situation makes it difficult for everyone.
He's not just another player on the team, so that's great [to get him
signed beyond this season]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Andy Murray, on enforcers Ryan Flinn and Kip Brennan, each
of whom was banged up over the weekend: "They were laying on the
massage tables, both of them, and I said, 'You two guys are our tough
guys, aren't you?' "</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Crowe</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Andy McDonald, one of the few bright spots for the Mighty
Ducks last season, found himself out of position Saturday during the
team's scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   Signing Adam Oates and Steve Rucchin being healthy has left the
Ducks deep at center. So McDonald, 10th among rookies with 28 points
last season, shifted to left wing for the scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me I could play either this season," McDonald said. "I
haven't had any experience at wing. I want to play, so I'll adjust."</TE>
<TE>   McDonald had seven goals and 21 assists last season to overcome
concerns about his size. He is 5 feet 10 and weighed 175 pounds last
season. He added 10 pounds during the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   It would seem difficult to find a spot for McDonald at center.
Besides Oates and Rucchin, the Ducks have center Matt Cullen, coming
off his best season. McDonald's skills and size are not suited for
playing on the fourth line.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to give him an opportunity to play," Coach Mike Babcock
said. "Playing on the wing might give him that opportunity. But
nothing is set in stone."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The white team defeated the black team, 1-0, on a goal by enforcer
Kevin Sawyer. Defenseman Fredrik Olausson, slowed by a sore groin
muscle, did not play in the scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks sent centers Tim Brent and Igor Pohanka back to juniors,
assigned center Brian Gornick to Cincinnati and released defenseman
Rod Sarich, who was brought in for a tryout.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Foster</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carolina Hurricane goaltender Kevin Weekes was taken to the
emergency room Sunday after having a seizure and collapsing on the
ice during the first day of training camp in Raleigh, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Weekes, 27, was later released from the hospital in good health
after undergoing evaluations. He is unlikely to practice again before
Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Munich Victims' Families Paid</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Abrahamson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just days after the 30th anniversary of the kidnappings and murders
of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches at the Munich Olympic Games,
German authorities have paid the Israeli families of those slain
about $3 million, bringing to a close a long-running lawsuit with
what was termed a "humanitarian gesture."</LD>
<LD>   The payment was delivered to Israeli government officials in
Berlin, then forwarded this week to Israel, said Pinchas Zeltzer, the
Israeli attorney whose office--one of Israel's leading law firms--has
long represented the 11 families.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit had alleged massive negligence by German local, state
and federal authorities in the events of Sept. 5, 1972. Arab
terrorists invaded the Olympic village before dawn. Within hours,
they had killed two Israelis and taken nine others hostage.</LD>
<TE>   Those nine were later killed in a firefight at a military airport
near Munich.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit was filed in the German courts only after the 1992
disclosure of thousands of files and hundreds of photos documenting
the attack at the village, the daylong siege and a botched rescue
attempt that led to the firefight.</TE>
<TE>   German officials have refused to accept liability in the deaths of
the Israelis. In announcing the payment Sept. 6 at Furstenfeldbruck,
site of the botched rescue attempt, Germany's interior minister, Otto
Schily, said "It is not an admission of guilt. It is a humanitarian
gesture."</TE>
<TE>   Zeltzer said, "This is nonsense. If you don't have to pay, you
don't pay millions. This was a struggle for 30 years.... Payment is a
recognition of guilt. You can't say it was just because they like
us."</TE>

<HD>Hornish Edges Castroneves, Wins Another IRL Title</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sam Hornish Jr. won another close race at Texas Motor Speedway in
Fort Worth, and with it his second consecutive Indy Racing League
season championship.</LD>
<LD>   Hornish went side by side with Helio Castroneves for most of the
final 25 laps Sunday in the season-ending Chevy 500, crossing the
finish line .0096 of a second--only a few inches--ahead of the only
other driver in contention for the title.</LD>
<LD>   Hornish and Castroneves traded the lead six times over the final
35 laps. But they stayed beside each other, almost touching several
times, before the second-closest finish in IRL history.</LD>
<TE>   Hornish won his IRL-record fifth race of the season, and the
23-year-old Penzoil Panther racer became the first driver on the
circuit to win two IRL championships.</TE>
<TE>   Before Hornish won the season finale last year, he already had the
season title in hand. This year, he came into the last race with only
a 12-point lead over Castroneves.</TE>
<TE>   Hornish overtook Castroneves for the points lead when he beat Al
Unser Jr. by .0024 of a second--the closest IRL finish in
history--last week in the Delphi Indy 300 at Joliet, Ill. He finished
with 531 points, 20 ahead of Castroneves.</TE>
<TE>   Had Castroneves been able to overtake Hornish at the finish, the
two would have been tied for the season title. But Hornish would have
been declared the champion because he would have still had one more
win than Castroneves.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Ryan Newman raced to his first NASCAR Winston Cup victory,
barely holding off Kurt Busch in the rain-shortened New Hampshire 300
at Loudon.</TE>
<TE>   Newman, 24, has eight top-five finishes in his last 10 starts and
a series-leading 13 in 27 races. He had five second-place finishes
before winning in his 35th race.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first points-paying victory for the former USAC
open-wheel champion. In May he won the Winston, NASCAR's all-star
race.</TE>
<TE>   Sterling Marlin finished 21st and lost the points lead for the
first time since the second race of the season. Mark Martin, who
finished 16th, leads Marlin by six points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rubens Barrichello and teammate Michael Schumacher transformed the
Formula One Italian Grand Prix at Monza into a showcase for Ferrari.</TE>
<TE>   Barrichello led Schumacher across the finish line, giving Ferrari
a 1-2 finish. Barrichello won his third race of the season and fourth
of his career and Ferrari claimed its 13th victory in 15 races.</TE>
<TE>   Barrichello, who led by 18 seconds with four laps remaining, beat
Schumacher to the line by 0.255 of a second and finished in 1 hour 16
minutes 19.982 seconds. Eddie Irvine finished third in a Jaguar, 52.5
seconds behind Barrichello.</TE>

<TE>   Dan Forsman eagled the 18th hole in the SEI Pennsylvania Classic
at Paoli to win his first PGA Tour victory in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   One day after his course-record-tying 64, Forsman made a 22-foot
putt on the final hole to finish a bogey-free six-under-par 65 in the
final round and 14-under for the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Forsman, who hadn't won since the 1992 Buick Open, finished one
stroke ahead of Robert Allenby and Billy Andrade, who led after the
first three rounds.</TE>
<TE>   Annika Sorenstam won her eighth LPGA Tour title of the year,
closing with a four-under 68 to hold off Kate Golden by a stroke in
the Safeway Classic at Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   She has 10 worldwide victories this year, winning three
consecutive events entering the Solheim Cup matches between Europe
and the United States this week in Minnesota. She won the Compaq Open
in Sweden on Aug. 18 and returned to the tour last week to win the
Williams Championship in Tulsa, Okla.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam earned $150,000 for her 39th tour victory to break her
own season tour record with $2,211,991 in 17 events. She set the
record last year with $2,105,868 in 26 events.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Fleisher held off Hale Irwin, the leading money winner on
the Senior PGA Tour, to end a 38-tournament winless streak, shooting
a 67 to win the RJR Championship in record-setting fashion at
Clemmons, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Fleisher also had rounds of 60 and 64 for a 19-under 191 to set
the tour's 54-hole record. Three players held the old mark of 193,
last done in 1992 by Gibby Gilbert.</TE>
<TE>   Fleisher earned $240,000 to move into third place on the money
list behind Irwin and Bob Gilder with six events left.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin had a 67 to finish at 14 under and five shots behind. Don
Pooley came in third at 12 under after a final-round 68.</TE>

<TE>   Anna Smashnova dashed Anna Kournikova's hopes of winning her first

<KH>DENVER 24, SAN FRANCISCO 14</KH>
<HD>Bronco Message Really Clear</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Though radio problems reduced the Denver Broncos to hand signals and
player relays on offense, their defense sent a signal that every team
in the NFL should be able to hear.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Anderson ran for 95 yards and caught a touchdown pass, and
Brian Griese threw two touchdown passes Sunday as the Broncos beat
the punchless San Francisco 49ers, 24-14, knocking off an NFC Super
Bowl hopeful for the second consecutive week.</LD>
<LD>   Because of interference from the 49er communications systems, the
Broncos (2-0) used old-fashioned methods for nearly everything they
did. While Griese called several plays on his own, the hard-hitting
Bronco defense forced the 49ers into one of their worst games in
recent memory.</LD>
<TE>   "That's one of the most complete games we've played in a while,"
Bronco linebacker Ian Gold said. "They got frustrated because we were
stopping everything they did."</TE>
<TE>   Denver held the 49ers (1-1) to 261 total yards--67 on a
meaningless final drive. Fans booed their team heartily in the second
half, and thousands headed for the exits early.</TE>
<TE>   "We just stunk it up all across the board," 49er receiver Terrell
Owens said. "Everybody messed up. It's early in the season, and we've
got time to correct our mistakes. But basically, we just stunk."</TE>
<TE>   The Broncos, who have missed the playoffs in two of the last three
seasons, appear ready to reclaim their spot among the NFL's elite
after the impressive victory over the 49ers, who lost for only the
second time in 10 home games. The Broncos held the St. Louis Rams to
one touchdown in their season opener.</TE>
<TE>   "There probably weren't many people who thought we'd start off
2-0, but here we are," Griese said.</TE>
<TE>   Bronco defensive coordinator Ray Rhodes dropped two safeties and a
linebacker into deep coverage, forcing the 49ers to throw short
completions. Tight end Eric Johnson caught seven passes for 69 yards,
but linebackers Gold, John Mobley and Al Wilson swarmed all over the
49ers on short receptions.</TE>
<TE>   "The defense did a good job," Bronco Coach Mike Shanahan said.
"That's an excellent offense to contain, and being able to put them
into a one-dimensional game is really great."</TE>
<TE>   The 49er offense also contributed to some of its problems.
Starting with consecutive false-start penalties on Owens during their
first drive, the 49ers had 10 penalties for 114 yards.</TE>

<HD>This Time, Hoffman Does His Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trevor Hoffman finally got Barry Bonds out in a critical situation.</LD>
<LD>   Hoffman--fifth on the career saves list--struck out Bonds and Jeff
Kent with the bases loaded in the ninth inning to preserve the San
Diego Padres' 4-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "The last two times I faced Bonds I intentionally walked him and
he hit a home run on a fastball in," Hoffman said. "With the bases
loaded, you just try to get ahead. There's no room to put him on with
him being the winning run. That's not a situation I wanted to be in."</LD>
<TE>   Ryan Klesko homered and drove in three runs as San Diego won its
first game at Pacific Bell Park in seven tries this season. Jake
Peavy got the win with help from four relievers.</TE>
<TE>   "Hoffy clutched up when he needed against two of the better
hitters in the game," San Diego Manager Bruce Bochy said. "Those are
the last two guys you want to see up with the bases loaded, but with
the game on the line, Hoffy has an unbelievable ability to keep his
focus."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants wasted a chance to take a two-game lead over the
Dodgers in the NL wild-card race. The Dodgers lost at Colorado
earlier in the day.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco Manager Dusty Baker, pitching coach Dave Righetti
and catcher Benito Santiago were ejected in the ninth inning for
arguing balls and strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 8, St. Louis 0--Wade Miller pitched the first shutout of
his career and extended his winning streak to a league-best 11
consecutive decisions. But it's going to take a lot more for the
Astros to win the NL Central.</TE>
<TE>   Miller pitched a three-hitter and Lance Berkman drove in four runs
as Houston beat Matt Morris. The victory cut St. Louis' lead in the
NL Central to 6 1/2 games and gave the Astros a split in the
four-game series.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 6, Cincinnati 0--Sammy Sosa broke a scoreless tie with his
46th homer in the eighth inning at Cinergy Field, a 421-foot,
three-run shot off Scott Sullivan (6-5) that helped Carlos Zambrano
(4-7) get his first victory since July 15.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Hill hit a three-run homer in the top of the ninth, set up
when Reggie Taylor dropped Joe Girardi's fly in center and Todd
Hundley singled. Zambrano was 1-6 with three no-decisions in 10
starts since July 15.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 6, Florida 4--Before a crowd of only 7,844, the smallest
to ever watch the Braves play in Miami, Javy Lopez hit a pinch-hit
grand slam with two outs in the sixth inning and John Smoltz earned
his major league-leading 51st save.</TE>
<TE>   Smoltz pitched a perfect ninth. He needs six saves to tie Bobby
Thigpen's major league record set in 1990. Florida's Kevin Millar hit
a solo homer in the sixth to extend his hitting streak to 21 games,
the longest active streak in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 10, New York 1--With a crowd of 16,608 at Olympic Stadium
for a "Turn Back the Clock" promotion, Javier Vazquez (10-13) got all
the offense he needed to win his second consecutive start after
losing seven in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The Expos scored in each of the first four innings to take a 10-0
lead. Matt Cepicky hit a grand slam and Orlando Cabrera and Jamey
Carroll hit two-run homers to lead the Expos.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 1, Pittsburgh 0--Pat Burrell scored on a fielding
mistake by reliever Scott Sauerbeck in the bottom of the 10th inning.
With one out, Burrell was intentionally walked and went to third on a
single by Travis Lee.</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Estrada then hit a sharp grounder to Sauerbeck (3-3), who
turned and made a bad throw to shortstop Jack Wilson, whose throw to
first was too late, allowing Burrell to score.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Curt Schilling joined Randy Johnson to make strikeout history and
Tony Womack singled home the winning run in the 13th inning Sunday to
give the Arizona Diamondbacks a 6-5 victory over the Milwaukee
Brewers.</LD>
<LD>   Schilling's bid to become baseball's first 24-game winner in six
years was spoiled when a fielding error by second baseman Junior
Spivey allowed the Brewers to score the tying run in the ninth
inning.</LD>
<LD>   Schilling struck out eight to reach 300 for the season. He and
Johnson are the first teammates with 300 strikeouts in the same
season.</LD>
<TE>   Felix Jose and Erubiel Durazo began the 13th with pinch-hit
singles off Nelson Figueroa (1-7), then Womack singled to left to win
it.</TE>
<TE>   The victory, coupled with San Francisco's loss to San Diego, left
Arizona seven games ahead of the second-place Giants with 14 to play.</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks have a magic number of seven to clinch their
third NL West title in four years.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling was far from his best, giving up eight hits and walking
three, but still had a 5-4 lead when he left after eight innings.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee lost its 97th game to tie a franchise record set in
1970, the Brewers' first season. They set a club record with their
51st road loss.</TE>

<HD>Montgomery Takes Cue From Jones</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tim Montgomery and Marion Jones share a coach, Trevor Graham. They
share a house in Raleigh, N.C. They reportedly also share a romantic
relationship.</LD>
<LD>   Sharing a set of starting blocks at Saturday's Grand Prix final in
Paris turned out to be another winning decision by Montgomery.</LD>
<LD>   Jones won the women's 100 meters in 10.88 seconds, taking the
women's overall Grand Prix title. In the next event, the men's 100,
Montgomery used the same blocks and left them where she put them.</LD>
<TE>   "I've been having trouble with my starting, and Marion was helping
me sort it out in training," Montgomery told reporters in Paris.
"She's like my guardian angel."</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery winged his way to a world record of 9.78 seconds,
breaking Maurice Greene's three-year-old mark of 9.79. Montgomery was
quick to say Greene is still king because of his consistency under
pressure, and he credited Jones with giving him sage advice about
rivals Greene--who didn't run Saturday--Dwain Chambers and Coby
Miller.</TE>
<TE>   "Being around Marion, I asked her if there's anything I need to
change," he said. "What I got was, 'Focus on you and what you've got
to work on. They know you've got it. They know you're ready. You
don't have to tell them you're ready.' "</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery was ready: His reaction time out of the blocks was
0.104 of a second. "At 30 meters, I saw no one was around me, so I
kept digging down as deep as possible," he said. "And from then on I
kept running and running and running."</TE>
<TE>   The 27-year-old native of Gaffney, S.C., believes his record won't
stand long. "It could well disappear next year and it might not be me
who lowers it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But with Jones to push him, he's sure to stay in fast company.</TE>
<TE>   New Carroll Students</TE>
<TE>   Frank Carroll's roster of figure skating students, depleted when
Michelle Kwan left last October, has expanded.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll, who already had Olympic bronze medalist and world silver
medalist Tim Goebel and the fourth-place finisher at this year's U.S.
championships, Angela Nikodinov of San Pedro, recently added U.S.
novice women's champion Danielle Kahle of Thousand Oaks. He's also
working in El Segundo with Yebin Mok of Los Angeles, but Mok's
primary coach will be former skater Johnnie Bevan.</TE>
<TE>   Kahle is a tiny, red-haired dynamo whose energy and jumping have
inspired comparisons to Tara Lipinski. She moved up to the junior
level and will compete in a Junior Grand Prix event at Phoenix this
week. Beatrisa Liang of Grenada Hills, ninth at this year's U.S. meet
under coach Tiffany Chin, also will compete there.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing is sure in skating--</TE>
<TE>   especially for the women, where injuries and puberty can knock
skaters off the elite track--but Kahle is worth watching.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, Sarah Hughes was a little-known 12-year-old, and
she went on to win gold at the Salt Lake City Games. Carroll, who
coached four-time world champion Kwan for nearly a decade, isn't
foolish enough to predict Kahle will follow Hughes' golden path, but
he's excited about her potential.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she's a tremendous talent," he said. "She has a lot of
maturing to do, very much like Michelle Kwan did when I first got
her. It looks like she has the same drive and desire."</TE>
<TE>   Mok, 18, was 10th at the U.S. championships in January. Because
Nikodinov is also a top-10 skater, Carroll felt it unfair to coach
both full time. "She's doing very well," he said of Mok, who
struggled with a growth spurt the past few years.</TE>
<TE>   Nikodinov, whom Carroll took on last season after the death of her
coach, Elena Tcherkasskaia, has been hampered by a shoulder injury.
But before that, Carroll said Nikodinov was improving her
conditioning and mental toughness.</TE>
<TE>   A graceful skater with an innate musical sense, Nikodinov often
faded toward the end of her long program. And if she made a mistake,
she often lost confidence and made several more. That happened at the
U.S. championships, where she was fourth, one place too low to make
the Olympic team.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very, very happy. She's been skating magnificently,"
Carroll said of Nikodinov, who is scheduled to compete in Grand Prix
events in Germany and Japan in November. "I think we work well
together. She's made great strides. She's in much better shape, and
we've worked on the idea that she has to keep going if she misses an
element and not get discouraged if she makes a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   However, Carroll said Goebel is struggling to regain his form
after a long post-Olympic tour with Champions on Ice. "He's very
tired, and it's a difficult time for him," Carroll said. "Tim's not
doing as well as he expects, and he expects a lot. He wants to do
everything right away, perfectly. He's a little difficult to be
around now."</TE>
<TE>   Goebel has again enlisted Lori Nichol to choreograph his programs,
which Carroll described as "works in progress." Goebel has time to
polish them before his Grand Prix events: he's scheduled to compete
at Skate Canada, Oct. 31-Nov. 3, and Trophee Lalique, Nov. 14-17 in
Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Spike 'em</TE>
<TE>   Despite losing two regulars, the U.S. women's volleyball team
reached the final of the world championships before losing to Italy
Sunday at Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   Without Keba Phipps of Lakewood, who injured an eye in practice
Saturday, and pregnant team captain Robyn Ah Mow, the U.S. women
relied on their strong blocking. The final game was tied, 9-9, before
Elisa Togut's three consecutive winners put Italy ahead to stay.
Italy won, 18-25, 25-18, 25-16, 22-25, 15-11.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud of my team because they did a great job throughout this
world championship," Long Beach State alum Tara Cross-Battle said.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach State product Danielle Scott was voted the tournament's
best blocker.</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   Suzy Favor Hamilton broke four minutes in the 1,500 twice in the
last two weeks, the second and third times she has broken that
barrier this season. She was timed in 3 minutes 59.43 seconds last
Sunday at Rieti, Italy, two days after she was timed at 3:59.40 at
Berlin and joined Mary Decker  as the only U.S. women to break four
minutes twice in one season.</TE>

<KH>CAROLINA 31, DETROIT 7</KH>
<HD>Panthers Take Win Any Which Way</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>The Carolina Panthers don't care how bad the Detroit Lions might be.
The Panthers will take as many victories as they can get.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday's game between last season's two worst NFL teams was
one-sided, with Carolina looking like a good team in a 31-7 victory.</LD>
<LD>   "People will have a tendency to say, 'That's just the Detroit
Lions, who cares if you beat them?' " receiver Muhsin Muhammad said.
"But what if you lose to a team like that? It doesn't matter who you
beat or how you beat them, all wins are important."</LD>
<TE>   Rodney Peete passed for 310 yards and a touchdown, Lamar Smith ran
for two scores, Mike Minter returned an interception 40 yards for a
touchdown, and No. 1 draft pick Julius Peppers lived up to his
billing with three sacks and a forced fumble.</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers are off to a 2-0 start for the first time since 1996,
having doubled their win total from last season when they lost their
final 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   "People try to slight who you play and how you play, but winning
breeds confidence and we're a lot more confident now than we were two
weeks ago," Coach John Fox said. "And it can't really get any better
than 2-0."</TE>
<TE>   The Lions (0-2) suffered their 10th consecutive road loss and
showed signs of being just as bad as they were last season when they
were 2-14 and didn't get their first win until Week 13.</TE>
<TE>   Lion Coach Marty Mornhinweg took no questions after the game,
instead uttering only a short statement before storming off.</TE>
<TE>   "Our offense was horrible," he said. "We had trouble completing
basic passes. Stayed close at halftime and then did absolutely
nothing. We've got a lot of work to do."</TE>
<TE>   Peete completed 21 of 32 passes, including eight to Muhammad for
107 yards and a touchdown--a 22-yard play just before halftime.
Peete, 36, was making only his 14th start over the last seven years.
This is his 12th NFL season.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought Rodney played great and it speaks volumes that he's
still got it," Muhammad said.</TE>

<HD>They Couldn't Fill His High-Tops</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a better game and a better league when Johnny Unitas was still
backpedaling into the pocket, as the first games since the death of
the league's legendary quarterback reminded us Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   It was a rough-hewn league where men were men and code-of-conduct
regulations concerned eye-gouging and groin-kicking, not the style
and color of the quarterback's shoes.</LD>
<LD>   It was a game beloved by the city of Baltimore, which fielded a
team that didn't embarrass the community on Sundays and played in a
stadium that belonged to Unitas, and everybody knew it, regardless of
what the place was called.</LD>
<TE>   In those days, the Colt quarterback wore high-tops, because nobody
was going to tell him he couldn't, and concluded the last-minute
drive down the field with a completion in the end zone to pull out
the game in the final seconds.</TE>
<TE>   In those days, the Baltimore quarterback put points on the
board--for his team, not the opponent--and never misfired a pitchout
so badly that it bounced against the goal-line marker for a safety.</TE>
<TE>   As tributes to Johnny U go, Peyton Manning and Chris Redman might
have been better off signing the petition to rename Baltimore's
football stadium after Unitas and leaving it at that.</TE>
<TE>   Manning, quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts, petitioned the
league to wear high-tops in Unitas' honor, only to be told he'd
better not, and then was denied again on the game's final play--his
potential game-winning pass knocked down in the end zone as his Colts
lost at home to Miami, 21-13.</TE>
<TE>   Redman, quarterback for the Baltimore Ravens, went ahead with the
high-tops anyway, flying in the face of a potential fine, which
qualifies as a genuine profile in courage in today's NFL. Redman had
the best of intentions--just not the best of connections with his
intended receivers.</TE>
<TE>   Redman's stats on his personal Johnny Unitas Day:</TE>
<TE>   Attempted passes: 38.</TE>
<TE>   Completed passes: 16.</TE>
<TE>   Touchdown passes: 1 (to the other team).</TE>
<TE>   Points produced for Baltimore: 0.</TE>
<TE>   Points produced for Baltimore's opponent: 9, including a pitchout
intended for Jamal Lewis that instead caromed off the goal-line pylon
for a safety.</TE>
<TE>   Final score: Baltimore 0, Tampa Bay 25.</TE>
<TE>   Redman played his college ball at Louisville, same as Unitas, who
had taken a special mentoring interest in the young quarterback.
Redman was making only his second NFL start Sunday, against a Tampa
Bay team still riled about losing its home opener a week earlier.
With high-tops on his feet and the football in his hand, Redman had
only one other thing in common with the old Baltimore Hall of Famer:
Unitas scuffled during his early days too.</TE>
<TE>   Manning has been around longer, been to the Pro Bowl, and in his
No. 18 jersey is considered the closest thing the Colts have had
since Unitas wore 19. He had the right idea, wanting to wear
Unitas-style high-tops to honor the memory, but made the crucial
mistake of notifying the league ahead of time. Knowing today's NFL,
he should have known better--and after the Colts' defeat, Manning
admitted as much, saying he should have gone ahead without first
informing the league.</TE>
<TE>   In today's NFL, a double-murder suspect can be lauded as Super
Bowl most valuable player, but the heir to the Unitas legacy cannot
wear high-tops without being hit with a "horrendous fine," as Manning
put it. Manning said he considered putting on the shoes and paying
the fine, regardless, but didn't want the attendant controversy to
detract from the leaguewide day of remembrance.</TE>
<TE>   On that issue, Manning took the high road.</TE>
<TE>   Too bad he couldn't get anyone from the league office to accompany
him.</TE>
<TE>   Some words that concisely summed up the day: "We keep tying our
shoelaces and stumbling over ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Who uttered them?</TE>
<TE>   a) Manning, after throwing three interceptions and having his
last-second pass broken up in the end zone by Miami's Brock Marion?</TE>
<TE>   b) Redman, after carrying the Ravens to their second shutout
defeat since moving to Baltimore and watching Tampa Bay linebacker
Derrick Brooks return one of his passes 97 yards for a Buccaneer
touchdown?</TE>
<TE>   c) NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue?</TE>
<TE>   d) St. Louis running back Marshall Faulk after watching the
defending NFC champion Rams fall to 0-2 after losing, at home, to the
New York Giants, 26-21.</TE>
<TE>   Incredibly, the speaker was Faulk, who might be the best player in
football--and he hasn't won a game since January.</TE>
<TE>   Remember January? Back then, the Rams were taking bows as the Next
Great Dynasty, moments away from adding the heads of the New England
Patriots to the trophy case.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Rams lost the Super Bowl to the Patriots, all four
of their exhibition games, their season opener to Denver and now
their home opener to the Giants. Absolutely head-shaking, all the way
down to this statistical nugget: the Rams' Kurt Warner threw two
interceptions--one returned for a touchdown by Jason Sehorn, one a
horribly underthrown ball that ended St. Louis' last drive with 1:43
left--and the Giants' Kerry Collins completed 14 of his first 15
passes and finished the day 22 for 26 for 307 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams now share last place in the NFC West with
Seattle--another startling home loser, christening/cursing their new
stadium with a 24-13 loss to Arizona. The Rams are lucky not to be
two games behind San Francisco, which also lost at home, to Denver,
24-14.</TE>
<TE>   Denver did it the old-fashioned way--relying on hand signals and
plays sent in with substitutes because of radio-transmission
problems. Bronco quarterback Brian Griese was even reduced
to--egad!--calling a few of his own plays, and now probably faces a
horrendous fine by the league office.</TE>
<TE>   Unitas would have been proud of the kid. On a day when so many
right-meaning gestures went awry, no one managed a better tribute
than Griese, getting down and dirty and wistfully low tech.</TE>

<HD>Markham: Kids Are All Right</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It looks as if Don Markham, the coach who garnered national attention
last season by calling his Rialto High football players "a bunch of
jerks," has found a more conscientious and agreeable bunch in his
return to Bloomington.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins ended a 10-game losing streak Friday by rolling over
Colton, 40-14, in Markham's first game at Bloomington since 1997.
Glennard Williams had 242 yards and scored three touchdowns running
out of Markham's trademark double-wing formation.</LD>
<LD>   Victories no longer move Markham, 63, who has five Southern
Section titles--three at Bloomington--and 275 wins in his career.
What matters to him is coaching a team full of players willing to
listen and dedicate themselves to improvement.</LD>
<TE>   Markham's verdict after Week 1 at Bloomington? The kids are all
right.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying and they're listening and they're polite," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they tend to, as much as they can, police each other. It
certainly is a step up from last year."</TE>
<TE>   Last year was one Markham would rather forget, even though he
guided Rialto to only its second winning season in the school's
10-year history.</TE>
<TE>   "The players wouldn't listen, wanted to do whatever they wanted to
do," he said. "They didn't want to go to practice and thought they
knew everything."</TE>
<TE>   Markham expressed interest in the Bloomington job when it came
open after last season, but the post went to Stewart Roper. Markham
moved on, accepting a job as offensive coordinator at Eastern Oregon
before receiving a phone call in July.</TE>
<TE>   The caller told him: "Don't throw out your old Bloomington shirts
yet."</TE>
<TE>   Roper was dismissed after inconsistencies were discovered on his
resume, opening the door for Markham to return to the program he had
coached for four seasons in the mid-1990s. He was welcomed back by
coaches Jesse Ceniceros and Jeff Stuckey, who had worked under
Markham at Bloomington before and never left.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't see myself going anywhere else," Markham said. "I think
I'll just stick here and finish [my career]. I don't know when that's
going to be.</TE>
<TE>   "I just take each year and see if I'm having fun and the kids are
listening. If no one's listening and we're not winning, we'll know
when to quit."</TE>
<TE>   A battle of heavies: Newhall Hart and Los Alamitos may rank among
the top teams in Southern California over the last decade, but their
meeting Friday was the kind of test neither is accustomed to in an
opening game.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos had won its last 11 openers, fattening up on teams
such as L.A. Washington and Cypress by an average score of 39-7. Hart
was 10-1 in openers since 1991, outscoring opponents such as Quartz
Hill and Granada Hills by an average tally of 40-13. The lone loss
for Hart was a 38-33 defeat to Honolulu St. Louis in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The teams' string of early success resulted in their meeting
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to get games when you get good," Los Alamitos Coach
John Barnes said. "Nobody wants to play you, so you've got to play
good teams."</TE>
<TE>   Neither team had its record blemished Friday. The game ended in a
21-21 tie after Hart quarterback Sean Norton connected with receiver
Cody Kase on a 68-yard pass as time expired.</TE>
<TE>   Just another victory: With its 49-0 victory over Rialto Eisenhower
on Friday, Corona Centennial won its third consecutive game against
the Eagles and took a 3-2 lead in a series that dates to 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't expect [a blowout]," Centennial Coach Matt Logan said.
"I need 11 game balls for that offense."</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies had outscored Eisenhower, 100-99, in the previous
three games, with the Eagles winning the first game between the
teams, 25-0.</TE>
<TE>   Considering last year's turn of events, the decisive victory
shouldn't lead to overconfidence for the Huskies. Centennial was 10-0
and the top-seeded team when it suffered a double-overtime loss to
Riverside North, 35-28, in the Division V quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Really offensive: An off-season knee injury wasn't the only reason
for Santa Margarita running back Ashton White's tentativeness early
during the Eagles' game against Orange El Modena. Santa Margarita is
also breaking in four offensive linemen, who struggled at times to
open holes for the senior standout.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to do a better job of blocking for him," Eagle Coach Jim
Hartigan said after Santa Margarita escaped with a 17-10 victory. "We
have to get better up front to establish the run."</TE>
<TE>   White, who finished with 90 yards in 27 carries, said he felt
about 80% healthy. The Eagles will need him at full strength Friday
when they play Redlands.</TE>
<TE>   Home cooking? Huntington Beach opened its enviable schedule
Thursday with a 35-29 victory over Fountain Valley Los Amigos. The
Oilers, one of only four Southern Section teams to play seven home
games, are the only section team to play all but one of their games
at home.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Huntington Beach's three road games, against Huntington
Beach Edison and Fountain Valley, will be played at Huntington Beach
High. The Oilers will have to travel only once, when they play Los
Alamitos on Oct. 17 at Veterans Stadium, Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Injury report: Esperanza senior running back Shaun Wildenstein is
expected to return this week when the Aztecs play host to Fallbrook
at Valencia High after suffering a knee contusion in the second half
Friday against Compton Dominguez..... Westlake Village Westlake
running back Kenneth Mackins could be sidelined three weeks because
of a separated shoulder suffered during the Warriors' 45-0 thrashing
of Santa Paula.... Joe Bernardi, a sophomore offensive lineman at
Hart who was expected to start, will have season-ending surgery for
torn knee ligaments later this month.</TE>
<TE>   Extra point: Jason Moss, Chatsworth's starting quarterback the
last two seasons, has passed a required class to regain his academic
eligibility. He will be available to play in the Chancellors' third
game, against Crespi, Coach Bill Coan said.</TE>
<TE>   Staff writers Martin Henderson, Eric Sondheimer and Peter Yoon
contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>BY THE NUMBERS</LD>
<LD>   0 Plays on offense for Manhattan Beach Mira Costa standout running
back Michael Okwo, who, because he had a sore hip, played only
linebacker in the Mustangs' 56-28 season-opening victory over North
Torrance. Okwo also had an upset stomach before the game.</LD>
<LD>   2-0 Score by which Arcadia defeated La Canada St. Francis, ending
a six-game losing streak against the Golden Knights. A snap over the
head of St. Francis punter Travis Berg sailed through the back of the
end zone for the game's only points.</LD>
<TE>   6 Touchdowns scored by South Torrance running back Chauncey
Washington in the Spartans' 56-39 loss to West Torrance. Washington
finished with 272 yards in 26 carries in a game that also featured a
236-yard, four-touchdown performance by the Warriors' Tom Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   35 Yards from which Newhall Hart kicked the extra point with no
time remaining in its 21-21 tie with Los Alamitos. Indian players had
stormed the field after a last-second touchdown completion, drawing
an excessive celebration penalty.</TE>
<TE>   BIG WINNERS</TE>
<TE>   * A large measure of respect was gained by Orange Lutheran, which
fell one two-point conversion short of knocking off Santa Ana Mater
Dei. The Division VI Lancers lost to the Division I Monarchs, 21-20,
in what nearly was one of the biggest upsets in Orange County
history. They will get another shot at a Division I team Thursday
when they play Anaheim Servite.</TE>
<TE>   * Matt Engle of El Segundo returned from a viral infection that
had sidelined him in practice all week to throw five touchdown passes
in the Eagles' 42-14 victory over San Pedro Mary Star.</TE>
<TE>   * Ryan Neinhuis of Santa Margarita stripped the ball from Orange
El Modena running back Daniel Dixon with less than two minutes
remaining to help preserve the Eagles' 17-10 victory. Dixon was
inside the Eagle 30-yard line when he lost the ball.</TE>
<TE>   * Carson scored a big victory for the City Section when it
defeated Long Beach Jordan, 32-22, in an early-season intersectional
showdown. It was the second year in a row that the Colts beat the
Panthers by 10 points in an opener.</TE>
<TE>   UPSETS</TE>
<TE>   * San Clemente defeated then-No. 5 Huntington Beach Edison, 13-10.
As good as he is, Charger quarterback Tommy Grady is effective only
when he has time to throw the ball. That didn't happen Friday, when
the Tritons sacked him seven times.</TE>
<TE>   * Alta Loma defeated then-No. 16 Covina Charter Oak, 35-31. The
Braves capitalized on the Chargers' four second-half turnovers,
completing the victory when Greg Holt ran one yard for a touchdown
with less than two minutes to play.</TE>
<TE>   * La Puente Bishop Amat defeated then-No. 19 Valencia, 17-14.
Christopher Seals scored on a four-yard run with just over a minute
to go, lifting the Lancers.</TE>

people think, or that we're capable of," Giant Coach Jim Fassel said.
"Our guys weren't going to stop unless they were going to win."</TE>
<TE>   Collins completed 14 of his first 15 passes for the Giants (1-1).</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody was writing us off before this game," Collins said.
"But we've got some good leaders."</TE>
<TE>   The error-prone Rams are 0-2 for the first time since they went
4-12 in 1998, the season before Kurt Warner led them to their first
Super Bowl title. St. Louis' offense has produced 37 points in two
games, and the Rams have trailed at the half in their last four
games, including a 14-3 deficit in their Super Bowl loss to the New
England Patriots.</TE>
<TE>   At least they're good at describing their predicament.</TE>
<TE>   "We keep tying our shoelaces in knots and stumbling over
ourselves," running back Marshall Faulk said.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Sehorn scored the fifth touchdown of his career on a 31-yard
interception return, and Matt Bryant kicked four field goals for the
Giants. Faulk fueled the Rams' second-half comeback with a pair of
touchdowns and finished with 87 yards in 14 carries. But he was
stuffed on fourth and inches and fumbled. Michael Strahan recovered
at the Ram 40-yard line with 2:53 left.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams got the ball back, but William Peterson sealed the
victory for the Giants when he intercepted an underthrown ball from
Warner with 1:43 left. Warner was 26 for 39 for 266 yards and two
interceptions as a no-huddle offense the Rams used for the first time
this season wasn't a factor.</TE>
<TE>   "I made too many mistakes and I lost this game for this team,"
Warner said. "I didn't get it done."</TE>
<TE>   Collins, who threw three interceptions in the Giants' narrow
opening loss to San Francisco, was 22 for 26 for 307 yards and kept
his mistakes to a minimum against a defense that gave him plenty of
time to pick his targets.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he played a real smart game," Fassel said. "My opinion
coming out of the first two games is that I think we can throw the
ball on people."</TE>
<TE>   Adam Archuleta intercepted a tipped pass in the third quarter to
give the Rams the ball at the Giant 37. St. Louis trailed only 20-14,
but Warner fumbled it back two plays later at the New York 17.</TE>
<TE>   Sehorn's interception return of a ball tipped by Kenny Holmes, who
had a sack earlier in the same series, had given the Giants a 17-0
lead with 9:44 to go in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Sehorn and Ram Coach Mike Martz engaged in a war of words last
season when Sehorn criticized the coach for being impatient and Martz
responding, "All I know is we run by Jason Sehorn."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Their offense didn't produce a touchdown, yet the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers still found plenty of ways to score.</LD>
<LD>   The Baltimore Ravens wish they could be so fortunate.</LD>
<LD>   Karl Williams returned a punt 56 yards for a touchdown and Derrick
Brooks scored on a 97-yard interception return as Tampa Bay defeated
Baltimore, 25-0, Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Jon Gruden was lured from Oakland to bring some firepower to
the Tampa Bay offense, but his first victory with the Buccaneers came
courtesy of defense and special teams.</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers (1-1) limited the Ravens (0-2) to six first downs
before the fourth quarter and frustrated Baltimore quarterback Chris
Redman. That led to Tampa Bay's first shutout since Sept. 10, 2000,
when it beat Chicago 41-0.</TE>
<TE>   It was an improvement from Tampa Bay's opener, a 26-20 overtime
loss at home to New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   "They called us old and predictable last week," Tampa Bay
defensive tackle Warren Sapp said. "I guess we can still throw an old
predictable goose-egg."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks preserved the shutout with his interception with 1:06 left.</TE>
<TE>   Although Tampa Bay's offense didn't produce a touchdown, it had
three long drives that resulted in field goals by Martin Gramatica.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Johnson was 24 for 31 passing for 211 yards and no
interceptions. He was sacked once.</TE>
<TE>   "The big issue was protecting Brad and giving him enough time to
throw," running back Michael Pittman said.</TE>
<TE>   "Last week, Brad was getting killed. Today he had time, and it
showed."</TE>
<TE>   Redman, making his second start for the Ravens, went 16 for 38 for
141 yards and the interception.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>The New Orleans Saints' relentless defense gave Brett Favre fits all
game.</LD>
<LD>   The Saints held Favre and the Green Bay Packers in check, and
Aaron Brooks threw two touchdown passes in a 35-20 victory Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "You make it easier on them, get the crowd into it, and you take
yourself out of the driver's seat and put them in it," Favre said.
"And they were in the driver's seat from the first snap."</LD>
<TE>   Brooks, who spent the 1999 season as Green Bay's third-string
quarterback, was 16 of 28 passing for 217 yards, and his two
touchdown throws helped the Saints take a 21-3 lead in the second
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "We're happy, but a lot of the credit goes to the defense," Brooks
said. "They stuck in there against Brett at a time that he was at his
best."</TE>
<TE>   The Saints (2-0) used the same pressure defense that helped them
win their season opener against Tampa Bay. Green Bay (1-1) had 357
total yards, but only 95 rushing. The Packers converted only 22% of
their third-down attempts (two of nine) compared to 70% for the
Saints, who also had 357 total yards.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to establish ourselves as one of the most physical
teams in the NFL," Saint defensive tackle Norman Hand said. "And
we're doing that right now."</TE>
<TE>   Favre--9-0 at the Superdome coming in, including exhibition games,
a Super Bowl win and two college victories--was on the run all game.
He was 29 of 44 for 270 yards and two touchdowns. He was sacked once
and had his streak of passes without an interception ended at 158 by
linebacker Darrin Smith. Favre also had two intentional grounding
calls.</TE>
<TE>   "We came in knowing this was a good defensive team," said Packer
tackle Earl Dotson. "I don't think they did anything we didn't
expect. They were just the hungrier team."</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans was called for nine penalties for 59 yards, including
a holding call that nullified a 50-yard touchdown run by Deuce
McAllister in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Saints opened with a 68-yard scoring drive that included three
third-down conversions and 54 yards in passing by Brooks before
McAllister's four-yard touchdown run. McAllister sealed the victory
for New Orleans with a two-yard touchdown run that made it 35-20 at
the two-minute warning.</TE>
<TE>   McAllister, who took over for Ricky Williams as the Saints' main
running back, rushed for 123 yards in 21 carries. It was his second
consecutive game with more than 100 yards rushing.</TE>

<KH>ARIZONA 24, SEATTLE 13</KH>
<HD>Cardinal Victory Is Quite a Rush</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Arizona's Thomas Jones knew the weaknesses of the Seattle defense.</LD>
<LD>   Jones ran for a career-high 173 yards and MarTay Jenkins had a
95-yard kickoff return in the fourth quarter as the Cardinals rallied
to beat the Seahawks, 24-13, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second consecutive 100-yard rushing performance given
up by Seattle (0-2). Charlie Garner had 127 in Oakland's 31-17
opening-week victory.</LD>
<TE>   "We watched the Raiders game," Jones said. "Charlie Garner and the
other running backs all had a good game. We thought we could do some
good things against them because of the size of our offensive line."</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals (1-1) won the first regular-season game at
$430-million Seahawks Stadium, and they handed Seahawk quarterback
Trent Dilfer his first loss as a starter in 16 games, ending a
remarkable streak that included Baltimore's victory in the Super Bowl
two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a while, but I never got too caught up in that," said
Dilfer, who returned after being sidelined five weeks because of a
sprained right knee.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of games in there that were like today. It gets
to the fourth quarter, and the team I was on was able to make a play.
We didn't do that today."</TE>
<TE>   Dilfer was 29 for 47 for a career-best 352 yards and a touchdown,
but he slowed down in the second half after Seattle built a 10-3 lead
at halftime. His last loss as a starter came when the Ravens were
beaten by Pittsburgh on Oct. 29, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Having Trent back clearly gives the offense a boost, but we have
some young people in there," Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren said. "When
we had chances at plays, crazy things happened."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona's Jake Plummer was 10 for 22 for 107 yards, and his
four-yard touchdown pass to Frank Sanders with 3:18 to play sealed
the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, meanwhile, had the first 100-yard rushing game of his
three-year NFL career.</TE>
<TE>   "Thomas was a byproduct of the way those offensive linemen were
blocking," Arizona Coach Dave McGinnis said. "He kept telling me on
the sidelines he was going to break one."</TE>

<LD>Shades of Tom Tupa in Week 1, Cincinnati quarterback Gus Frerotte
showed he is not ambidextrous during Sunday's 20-7 loss to Cleveland.</LD>
<LD>   Trailing 10-0, the Bengals were driving when Orpheus Roye broke
through the line and bear-hugged Frerotte.</LD>
<LD>   Frerotte throws with his right hand, but he flipped an
embarrassing left-handed pass directly in to the arms of Cleveland's
Kenard Lang. The 285-pound lineman headed down the sideline with a
convoy of blockers, making it to the eight before Frerotte made a
diving tackle from behind with 30 seconds left in the half.</LD>
<TE>   "I saw the end zone and at first--I felt like Carl Lewis," Lang
said. "Then I felt like the Pillsbury Dough Boy."</TE>
<TE>   Lang wasn't upset that he got caught from behind by a quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't say anything to him," Lang said. "He had already given
me a present, so I just told him thank you."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How bad was Sunday's 44-7 loss to New England for the Jets?</TE>
<TE>   So strong was the Patriot defense, that it held New York to one
first down until punter Matt Turk ran 14 yards on a fake punt late in
the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The 14 yards made Turk the Jets' leading rusher for the game. No
one else on the team rushed for more than nine yards.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For only the fifth time since the NFL began its blackout policy in
1973, home teams sold out all games in advance of the local TV
blackout deadline, enabling the 16 games of Week 2 to be televised in
the home-team market.</TE>
<TE>   Blackouts have been lifted for all games on a single weekend as a
result of all games selling out on Sept. 6-7, 1998; three times in
2000--Nov. 12-13, Nov. 19-20, and Dec. 10-11; and on November 22-26,
2001.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL blackout policy states that games sold out 72 hours before
kickoff will be televised in the home city.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's key injuries: Larry Allen, the Cowboys' All-Pro lineman,
sprained his left ankle during Dallas' 21-13 victory over Tennessee.
Allen was hurt late in the second quarter. He tried to return but
came out again.</TE>
<TE>   * A week after losing Jevon Kearse with a broken foot, the Titans
were briefly without quarterback Steve McNair, who had a concussion
in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   * The Dolphins were hit hard by injuries, losing linebacker Twan
Russell and cornerback Patrick Surtain with sprained left knees in a
21-13 victory at Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   * In the loss to the Saints, Packer running back Ahman Green left
because of a right knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   * Charger Pro Bowl defensive end, Marcellus Wiley, sprained an
ankle after sacking Texan quarterback David Carr twice in San Diego's
victory.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After a six-year absence, Jimmy Johnson will return full-time to
the "Fox NFL Sunday" pregame show next weekend. Johnson retired as
coach of the Dallas Cowboys in 1993 and was a member of the show
during its first two years, 1994-95. He later became coach of the
Miami Dolphins.</TE>

<LD>Former Manchester United star George Best admitted that he felt like
committing suicide after a life-saving liver transplant six weeks
ago.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview with the Mail on Sunday in London, Best, who also
played for the Los Angeles Aztecs of the defunct North American
Soccer League, said he suffered terrible depressions in the weeks
after the 10-hour operation at London's Cromwell Hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Best was discharged after 18 days, only to be readmitted almost
immediately because of stomach pains.</LD>
<TE>   "Some days I felt suicidal," Best said. "It was horrendous. It
wasn't the pain or the extra days in the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt useless and wished I were dead. I thought, 'I can't cope,
is it all worth it?' "</TE>

<HD>Overtime Getting Routine for Bills</HD>

<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Though overtime was much kinder to them this time, Drew Bledsoe and
the Buffalo Bills would rather not take so long to win.</LD>
<LD>   Peerless Price streaked untouched down the middle of the field for
a 48-yard touchdown reception in overtime, and Bledsoe set career and
franchise highs with 463 yards passing Sunday in a wild 45-39 victory
over the Minnesota Vikings.</LD>
<LD>   "It'd be nice to win one in regulation," Bledsoe admitted.</LD>
<TE>   The Bills, who lost, 37-31, to the New York Jets last week when
Chad Morton returned the opening kickoff in overtime for a touchdown,
played back-to-back overtime games for the second time in their
history--first done in 1987. It was also the third time since 1995 a
team opened a season with two overtime games. Indianapolis split in
1995, as did Tennessee in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Hollis tied the score as time expired in regulation with a
career-long 54-yard field goal that hit the crossbar and bounced
over. That came after Moe Williams' three-yard touchdown run that put
the Vikings up, 39-36, with 26 seconds left--the fourth lead change
of the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "It took everything we had," Bledsoe said, "but hopefully this is
a step for us in the right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe, who became the third-quickest in NFL history to reach
30,000 yards passing earlier in the game, completed 35 of 49 passes
and had three touchdown throws--two to Price.</TE>
<TE>   "With Drew, if you're down 40-0, you believe you can win," Price
said. "We never thought we were out of it. With Drew in the huddle,
the thought of losing never crosses your mind."</TE>
<TE>   Price, whose three-yard touchdown catch put Buffalo up, 36-32,
with 4:19 left in regulation, also had a career day with 13 catches
for 185 yards. Rookie Josh Reed had eight receptions for 110 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Daunte Culpepper, whose three fumbles led to 13 Buffalo points,
completed 25 of 45 passes for 281 yards with no interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "We're good at the start of the game, we're good at the middle of
the game," Viking receiver Randy Moss said, "but in the home stretch,
we can't seem to get it done."</TE>
