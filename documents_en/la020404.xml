<LD>He speaks in a whisper, each word drawn painfully from his damaged
vocal cords. The effort is all the more anguished because once his
voice rose with arias from a dozen operas. Once he had a future
bright with promise. But now?</LD>
<LD>   Jason Black explores the question as though it's a viable presence
in the room. Then, after a long pause, he whispers, "I don't know."</LD>
<LD>   At age 25, he's looking toward days clouded with uncertainty. The
tenor voice that fills my room as I write, Black's voice on a CD, may
never again be heard in person on an opera stage.</LD>
<TE>   He knows that, but the prospect is never tolerable. "I can't
imagine life without singing," he says, forcing out each word. "But
it's no longer in my hands."</TE>
<TE>   We sit in the living room of the Winnetka home that he and his
wife, Tausha, a music teacher, purchased just before an accident two
months ago that changed his life. Whether or not they'll be able to
keep it now is problematical.</TE>
<TE>   Without medical insurance and burdened by bills, Black knows that
future treatment of his injured vocal cords is uncertain. Nothing is
clear anymore. For the second time in his life, Jason Black is
walking in fate's shadow.</TE>
<TE>   The accident that left a red scar down the right side of his neck
occurred as he was moving from a Toluca Lake townhouse to his present
home. Two friends were helping him move a large, heavy glass coffee
table out the front door. They dropped it three times. Twice, it
didn't break. The third time, it did.</TE>
<TE>   "A solid piece of glass came at me like a guillotine," Black says.
"It cut me from behind the ear to the voice box, through both jugular
veins."</TE>
<TE>   He pressed a towel against the wound to stem a heavy flow of blood
until paramedics arrived and rushed him to Cedars-Sinai hospital.
Weak but conscious, he told the surgeon he was an opera singer, and
somehow managed to sing part of an aria from Verdi's "Rigoletto."</TE>
<TE>   He whistles "La Donna e Mobile" for me as we sit in the living
room of his home, tucked into a quiet corner of a cul-de-sac. Though
his voice is a hushed whisper, the whistle is a high, strong, almost
electronic sound, piercing the silence with unnerving clarity.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what the quality of my voice, the timbre, was when I
sang it to the surgeon," he says, sensing the oddity of the moment.
"I don't think I finished. People were doing things to me. I was
angry."</TE>
<TE>   The aria reminds Black of the first time fate's shadow fell over
him. He was singing in "Rigoletto" for the San Jose opera three years
ago when he was involved in an automobile accident. Bones in his arms
and legs were broken, and he suffered brain damage.</TE>
<TE>   He was told then, he says, that he should have died. When he
survived, doctors said he would never walk again and that his brain
would take at least two years to heal.</TE>
<TE>   "It took two weeks," Black whispers as I lean forward to hear the
triumph in his tone. "After the accident, I was the lead tenor in
'Rigoletto,' 'Madame Butterfly' and 'Candide.'" He smiles in spite of
himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wouldn't die."</TE>
<TE>   Music has dominated his life. He began singing in childhood, at
home and in church, and by the time he was an undergraduate at San
Jose State University, he was performing in operas.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Black has sung in 25 productions throughout California
and once in Germany, both as a lead tenor and a member of the chorus.</TE>
<TE>   When the accident that damaged his vocal cords occurred, he was
performing with the Orange County Opera, taking classical music into
schools and preparing for a part in the L.A. Opera presentation of
Puccini's "Turandot."</TE>
<TE>   Steven Dunham, who heads the Orange County group, speaks of the
bright future that was Black's, adding sadly, "That's why all of this
is so much more tragic."</TE>
<TE>   Black's "day job" was as a singing waiter at Miceli's Restaurant
in Universal City. I heard of him from co-workers who were in awe of
his voice and devastated by the accident that reduced his soaring
vibrato to a whisper.</TE>
<TE>   Fate toys with Black. Because he and his wife couldn't afford
medical insurance for both of them, they purchased it only for her.
They must now personally bear the costs of his surgery and subsequent
treatment, which have already exceeded $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   He was told by a surgeon that he would probably get his voice
back, that the damage to his voice box was caused by swelling that
would eventually subside. But a specialist told him not to hold out
hope that he would ever sing again.</TE>
<TE>   "Who do you believe?" he asks in an anguished whisper.</TE>
<TE>   Weeks of therapy and treatment lie ahead: a vocal strobe test,
therapy three times a week, a neurological study and perhaps even
more surgery if he is ever to sing again.</TE>
<TE>   Black is hopeful. He has to be. "Music is all I have," he says.</TE>
<TE>   I listen now as his voice, rich and vibrant, fills my office. The
aria plays over and over on the same CD. I can almost hear fate
whispering in the background.</TE>

<LD>Relatives of Peggy Lee were confounded when the beloved jazz singer
who died Jan. 21 was left out of the Academy Awards telecast "In
Memoriam" segment last month. Lee's daughter, Nicki Lee Foster, has
written Bruce Davis, the executive director of the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences, asking that the singer be included in next
year's show.</LD>
<LD>   But Davis says there's no chance of that happening. Lee's family
is among scores of people who feel a loved one was unfairly omitted
from the popular segment. "I have about 116 of those letters on my
desk," Davis said. "This is not an unusual reaction. The 'In
Memoriam' segment generates more response than anything else we do.
And it's all negative."</LD>
<LD>   Davis said he is also sifting through complaints from relatives of
former teen heartthrob Troy Donahue, Oscar-winning special effects
artist A.D. Flowers, comedy character actress Kathleen Freeman and
actress Dorothy McGuire--all of whom died during the last year but
were not honored on the show.</LD>
<TE>   About 100 Academy members die each year, but the telecast has room
to memorialize only about 24, said Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very cruel couple of weeks toward the end" as selections
are made, he said.</TE>
<TE>   As far as Lee is concerned, Davis said, she was noted more for
hits such as "Fever" and "Is That All There Is?" than her film work,
though she earned an Oscar nomination for her role as an alcoholic
blues singer in the 1955 film "Pete Kelly's Blues."</TE>
<TE>   Lee's relatives question the Academy's decision to bump Lee yet
include young pop star Aaliyah, who died in a plane crash Aug. 25 and
had one film role. The young singer, said family spokeswoman Holly
Azzari, "didn't have a distinguished film career and yet they
eliminated a 20th century icon."</TE>
<TE>   Auction Items for Those Who Have It All</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Davis, organizer of one of the biggest fund-raisers of the
year--the Race to Erase MS--has luxury on her mind. Sitting in the
living room of her Beverly Glen home on a recent afternoon, Davis
talks about how she hopes to use it to coax donations from the
pockets of the wealthy at the Race, an auction to be held at the
Century Plaza Hotel and Spa next month. Summing up her task, the
daughter of Barbara Davis and Marvin Davis asks: "What do you give
that you can't buy yourself?" How about a "fantasy sports
package"--tickets to the biggest sporting events of the year,
including the Super Bowl, the World Series, the NBA finals, the NHL
finals and the U.S. Open (where the bidders will sit at the
president's box), as well as first-class airline tickets to get
there?</TE>
<TE>   Or a child's playhouse that's a replica of your own house,
complete with running water, air-conditioning, lighting and interior
design? For the athletic, there's a weeklong luge camp at the U.S.
Olympic training village. Then there are this year's most coveted
items: "Opportunities," says Davis. "Internships for the children is
a hot thing lately. We're getting a lot of calls for that." To meet
the demand, Davis and her helpers have arranged for the highest
bidder to send a child off to stints at Brillstein-Grey, ICM, or a
New York modeling agency. Every item is donated and, each year, Davis
gets on the phone to get donations and sell tables. (Individual
tickets start at $500, reaching $2,500, and full tables start at
$15,000, reaching $75,000.)</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard and scary," she says about soliciting funds and favors.
"Sometimes it's hard to get the word out."</TE>
<TE>   This year, Davis and about 40 volunteers collected close to 600
auction items, including a Chrysler P.T. Cruiser custom designed by
Tommy Hilfiger, a fashion show complete with one gratis outfit from
Badgley Mischka and a trip to the cosmetic company MAC's New York
offices where makeup consultants will custom-design a lipstick shade
and name it after you.</TE>
<TE>   "People love these things that [they] can't buy," says Davis, like
a spot in the next Jackie Collins novel. The writer has donated a
character, to be named for the highest bidder. Even those among the
expected 1,300 guests who don't bid in the auction will walk away
with gifts en masse. This year, items in the proverbial goody bag
include a specially designed watch, a silver photo album, sunglasses,
T-shirts, a host of beauty products, vitamins ("because I'm a vitamin
person," says Davis) and berets from this year's Olympics. All the
goodies help beget good. Since the Race's inception in 1993 (the
first fund-raiser was a ski weekend in Aspen, Colo.), the event has
raised $14 million to benefit the Nancy Davis Foundation for MS.</TE>

<LD>THE FALL OF LIGHT</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Niall Williams</LD>
<TE>   Warner Books</TE>
<TE>   306 pages; $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Following in the unruly footsteps of his father, grandfather and
even his great-grandfathers, Francis Foley spent his youth as an
outlaw and rebel in the rugged countryside of Ireland. Mistaking
vengeance for justice, the Foleys were fiercely intent upon righting
what was wrong in the history of their country, a pursuit that would
condemn Francis and his own family to a lifetime of ragged poverty
and flight.</TE>
<TE>   It is, as Niall Williams tells us, the saga of his own
forefathers, "not a history" but a story that "has been told and
retold over for a hundred and fifty years." Each teller adds his own
hauntingly imagined details, and their culmination in "The Fall of
Light" results in an epic tale radiating with the majesty of myth,
written in prose as precise and lyrical as poetry.</TE>
<TE>   The tale begins with Francis packing up his four sons and a stolen
telescope, leaving their barely habitable cottage probably in County
Wicklow, then crossing the fields of Tipperary until they reached the
river, and then on to the sea. Exhausted by their repeated flights
and ever-unchanging circumstances, Francis' wife, Emer, had walked
out on the family the day before, refusing to follow her husband yet
another time on his dream-filled quest for a better life. But Francis
is passionately determined and assures his four sons that once they
find their new home, he will bring their mother back to them. When
Teige, Francis' youngest son, refuses to ride his pony across the
river, Francis lashes out at the boy, and in their struggle Francis
falls into the waters and is carried off in the torrent. The boys
ride the riverbank, searching for their father:</TE>
<TE>   "At last they came to where they could ride no more and where the
last sighting of Francis Foley turned out to be a singular lonesome
swan riding the low waves.</TE>
<TE>   "'He is gone,' Tomas said.</TE>
<TE>   "The breath of the horses misted and faded. They sat crouched
forward like ones beneath a burden. The landscape thereabouts was a
green and rumpled stillness. The silence grew heavy. Then Finbar
said, 'He is gone to America,' and laughed a small laugh that faded
away.</TE>
<TE>   "Finan looked at Tomas to see what he would say, but he said
nothing at all.</TE>
<TE>   "They watched the waters.</TE>
<TE>   "'He is not,' Teige said at last, 'he is become a swan.'"</TE>
<TE>   Tomas, Teige and twins Finan and Finbar stoically move on, feeling
stunned and orphaned, yet no less determined to reach the sea that
was their father's destination. As they travel, circumstances
separate the brothers, one by one, until each member of the family is
alone, without word of one another for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   Tomas is the first to become separated from his brothers when he
leaves their camp for the town of Limerick and falls in love with a
young prostitute named Blath. Williams' depiction of Tomas' innocence
and his gradual understanding of Blath's occupation is wrenching and
convincing. Tomas' untainted feelings of love cut straight through to
the young woman's own buried innocence, and this moment of grace
between the two remains one of the novel's most poignant. Determined
to bring Blath back to his remaining family, Tomas rescues her from
the brothel, though his efforts result in terrible violence.</TE>
<TE>   While Tomas is in Limerick, his brothers join a group of gypsies
who are grieving the death of their star horse racer, a young boy who
had succumbed to a mysterious disease, and they come to believe that
Teige, a fine rider himself, has arrived to replace their own lost
child. Williams weaves into his tale a variety of ancient myths,
ranging from those told by the gypsies to the ancient Greek stories
of the stars that the brothers once learned about from their parents.</TE>
<TE>   Stargazing figures large in the novel; it was this preoccupation
that led their father to steal the telescope at their journey's
beginning. Looking to the stars keeps the Foley family believing in
the possibility of passing beyond earthly difficulties, and in fact
surprising and miraculous happenings do grace the family.</TE>
<TE>   Writing with an almost unearthly sensuousness--such phrases as
"the blown souls of the vanished" and descriptions such as the snow
falling in "torn fragments of some broken treaty between heaven and
earth" fill the narrative--Williams, who has been praised as a rising
star in modern Irish literature, brings a loveliness to this story.
"The Fall of Light" recounts a strange and wondrous odyssey, sparked
by human desire and steeped in the tragedies of history.</TE>

<HD>The Quest for a Sense of Place</HD>
<DH>A tour explores some of L.A.'s historic districts, which
offer respite from tear-down mania.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNINE STEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten years ago, Peter Persic had had enough of living in a tear-down
crazed section of Beverly Hills. He wanted a neighborhood with
"architectural integrity," and found his dream a couple of miles east
in South Carthay, which he calls a "tranquil oasis in the middle of
the big city."</LD>
<LD>   Just east of La Cienega Boulevard, South Carthay provides Persic
with "a sense of the kind of theatricality and romance that was Los
Angeles in the '30s." It also happens to be one of Los Angeles' 15
Historic Preservation Overlay Zones--the city's official designation
for a historic neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, seven of these districts will be the subject of "At
Home With History," a self-guided tour showcasing the city's rich,
and often overlooked, architectural heritage. The event is
co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Conservancy, the HPOZ Alliance and
the featured districts.</LD>
<TE>   Historic designations have been granted over the past 19 years to
Los Angeles neighborhoods, or parts of neighborhoods, that have
retained their architectural integrity; all must include buildings
that relate to each other historically, architecturally, or
culturally.</TE>
<TE>   The seven highlighted Sunday were chosen for their range of
styles--Victorian to Spanish Colonial Revival--and locations,
including West Adams-Normandie and Western Heights, both west of
downtown L.A.; University Park, near USC; South Carthay; Angelino
Heights, near Echo Park; Banning Park, in Wilmington, and Miracle
Mile North, just north of the L.A. County Museum of Art. The tour
features one open house in each area, and area residents will be
available for questions.</TE>
<TE>   "'I didn't even know this neighborhood existed' is the most common
comment we hear," says Murray Burns, a preservationist, longtime
Angelino Heights resident and founding member of the HPOZ Alliance, a
2-year-old group formed by members of the various districts. "Letting
people know these areas are here was certainly the object when I
approached the conservancy with the idea for the tour."</TE>
<TE>   "We figure we will have done our jobs on this tour if people walk
two blocks in these neighborhoods," says Jane McNamara, the
conservancy's director of education. "We also wanted people to look
at where they live and to understand their neighborhood's connection
to the history of L.A. Districts may have significance because of
their roles in the city's past, even if they don't have a famous
landmark in the middle. An area of intact 1920s and '30s tract homes
tell an important part of L.A.'s history."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the residents of these ethnically and economically
diverse neighborhoods have become closely connected, sharing a
passion and commitment to preserving the city's residential history.
Although some admit they sometimes clash over various issues, the
benefits of living in these districts far outweigh the occasional
argument, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a reconnection to neighborhoods in the city, and
there's a new level of neighborhood activism in general," says Ken
Bernstein, director of preservation issues for the conservancy. "I
think it's a way of finding a sense of place within a large, often
faceless city."</TE>
<TE>   Persic, public relations director for the Los Angeles Central
Library, found that connection when he moved to South Carthay. The
area, located roughly at Pico and La Cienega boulevards, is filled
with 1930s-era homes built by developer Spiros George Ponty on land
that once grew produce for Ralphs markets.</TE>
<TE>   Although the homes are mostly two-bedroom Spanish Colonial
Revival, one-story tract houses, their details far surpass today's
standards. Exteriors have varied features such as courtyards, tile
and arched entrances. Inside are hand-painted ceilings and murals in
classical motifs, as well as stained glass and delicate molding
trims.</TE>
<TE>   A block away from the gas stations and nondescript storefronts on
Western Avenue, just north of the Santa Monica Freeway, the quiet
neighborhood of Western Heights is filled with early 1900s-era
Craftsman homes. Vine-covered cottages and larger homes, stout and
sturdy, line the street. Some have been restored to pristine
condition, others slump and sag from a lack of attention, but each
has a distinctive personality that gives a glimpse of what the city
was like a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   Don Lynch bought his home, which will be featured on Sunday's
tour, five years ago, moving from Redondo Beach to an area he was
familiar with through his involvement with the West Adams Heritage
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "I know all my neighbors, which wasn't true in Redondo," says
Lynch, a historian and co-author of "Titanic: An Illustrated
History." "Here, everybody kind of knows everybody. When I walk down
to the corner, I have to add on five minutes to visit with anyone
who's out doing yardwork."</TE>
<TE>   Lynch's home was built in 1909 by Frank Tyler, a prominent L.A.
architect, for a Topeka family who used it as a summer residence and
then a retirement home. Although it was converted during the 1980s
into a bed-and-breakfast, no major construction was done to alter its
authenticity, and the home remains a prime example of the era's
changing styles. While the outside has a definite Craftsman look, the
inside features Victorian elements, such as dark wood paneling.</TE>
<TE>   The Col. John E. Stearns Residence in University Park, also on the
tour, is in an area near USC known for elegant Victorian houses. It
too tells a story of shifting style allegiances. Inside black
wrought-iron gates, the Classical Revival-style mansion seems
straight out of New Orleans, one reason the present owners bought it
a dozen years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We had just been in New Orleans and had looked at plantation
houses, and we had those images in our head," explained Jim Robinson,
managing editor of the Long Beach Press-Telegram, who shares the
house with his wife, Janice. He found the house while leafing through
the L.A. Business Journal, and bought it from the family of the
original owners. Highlights include an ornate Victorian drawing room,
a library once used as a billiard room and an enormous
Edwardian-style formal dining room. The coach house and cook's
cottage out back are used as rentals, as are some parts of the
seven-bedroom house.</TE>
<TE>   Although owning this piece of history has been a crash course in
renovation for the couple, who previously lived in a condo in Long
Beach, they say the work as been worth it. "We're very pleased," says
Jim. "We never regretted moving here. It was our chance to live in a
really unique house."</TE>

<LD>Everyone loves music. It's an important part of our lives. In fact,
it's hard to imagine our world without it. Every time you watch a
movie or the television, or turn on the radio, you probably hear
music. Sometimes you hear rock 'n' roll, sometimes you hear jazz, but
a lot of the time, the music you hear is called symphonic
music--music played by an orchestra.</LD>
<LD>   Remember that exciting music from "Star Wars" or "Indiana Jones,"
or "Lord of the Rings" or "Harry Potter"? Most of the music in these
movies was composed for an orchestra. Can you imagine watching those
movies without the orchestra music? It would be pretty boring, but
that's why music is so important. Composers can take how we feel
during a certain part of a movie and turn it into music.</LD>
<LD>   Some popular composers have lived in the United States, such as
John Philip Sousa, also called the "March King" because he wrote
great marches for bands. Many came from other countries. Ludwig van
Beethoven was German and wrote some of the most famous musical pieces
in history, including "Moonlight Sonata" and his Fifth Symphony.
Peter Tchaikovsky was from Russia and wrote many well-known
symphonies and ballets, including "The Nutcracker" and "Swan Lake."</LD>
<TE>   If you come to the Pacific Symphony's family concert this Saturday
morning at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, you will hear
lots of different music from many countries. You can also participate
in a musical treasure hunt, visit a musical petting zoo, play musical
games, try on costumes, meet musicians and much more. And best of
all, you get to hear a symphony orchestra perform live. For more
information, call (714) 755-5799 or visit www.pacificsymphony.org.</TE>

<HD>A Hands-On Approach</HD>
<DH>Clay's 'sensual, earthy' quality is a medium for
self-expression at potter's studio.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY BRYANT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the back workroom at the Clayhouse in Santa Monica, Doris Spivak
is creating a shoe sculpture, Gail Buckley is teaching hand-building
pottery and Anthe Wosczyna is working at the potter's wheel. Out
front, Clayhouse owner Tani Sims-Ebert is presiding over the gallery
space, which features bowls by 30 studio members.</LD>
<LD>   This truly is a place where there's something for everyone. Prices
start at $5, but can reach $70, and each potter's work is distinct
from the others'. Dark colors popular in the 1960s are gone, replaced
by colors that are "earthy but not dirty," as Sims-Ebert puts it.
Stoneware glazes, for example, include copper red, tenmoku
(brown/black), porcelain white and translucent blue. Some of the
bowls, especially the celadon-colored ones, are reminiscent of
Chinese ware; others are rustic looking. Some potters try for a thin,
almost porcelain-like quality, while others make hefty receptacles.</LD>
<LD>   Potters come to the 3,400-square-foot Clayhouse (founded in 1971
as the Pot Farm) both to work and to learn this timeless art form.
Here, aspiring clay artists can learn wheelwork, hand
building--working with clay without a wheel--and sculpture. "Students
learn how to add fine details and make pieces that will survive in
the kiln," Sims-Ebert says.</LD>
<TE>   The kilns fire at 2,390 degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to make
works that can withstand the microwave and dishwasher. The heat also
seals the color and makes the objects food-safe. The Clayhouse offers
25 glazes to work with, Sims-Ebert says, and because many potters,
such as the late Beatrice Wood, are known for their glazes, this is
an important component of the work. Some potters use commercial
powders, while others create glazes by trial and error, adding
substances such as chrome and iron.</TE>
<TE>   The bowls show runs through April 19, and studio exhibitions,
which feature members' works, generally run for a month. Being able
to sell work in the gallery space is part of the experience of being
a working potter, explains Sims-Ebert. "Before, students had to go to
gift shows to sell their works. I also let students take turns
displaying their works in the window." Right now, Spivak's "Feats of
Clay" grace the window, a whimsical display of clay shoes that could
serve as clever paperweights or coffee-table items.</TE>
<TE>   For Sims-Ebert, the Clayhouse is a passion. "I have an Indian
ancestry," she says, "so I was exploring that years ago by taking a
class in pottery-making through adult education. I touched the clay
and that was that. I started designing my own pots, then I got a
teaching credential in ceramics in 1983, and gave up my job in 1993
as a nurse practitioner to teach pottery here and oversee the studio
full-time." She bought the property in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Sims-Ebert may have stopped working in the medical field, but she
believes pottery has a healing effect, and many people are drawn to
learn it for that reason. "Clay is a great medium. We have the term
'learning how to center,' which refers to centering the clay on the
wheel. The more centered you are in life, the more centered the clay
is on the wheel." She says that working with clay has held her
together through a divorce as well as deaths in her family.</TE>
<TE>   "We get all ages here," Sims-Ebert says. Students must be at least
18; "I've had people as old as 90."</TE>
<TE>   Classes are limited to eight students, begin at $220 and last up
to six weeks. All are hands-on, and the price includes supplies,
firing and unlimited studio access. A $150 a month membership allows
for use of kilns, glazes and equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "Clay is such a sensual, earthy medium; it almost throbs. I love
everything about it."</TE>
<TE>   *The Clayhouse is located at 2902 Santa Monica Blvd. in Santa
Monica and is open Tuesday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.</TE>

<LD>Kate neared the end of the bridge. Finally, she stood on shaky legs,
pushed her wet hair out of her eyes, and looked and listened. Then
she saw the lights of the depot and ran, slipping on gravel and
falling several times, but hurrying on.</LD>
<LD>   She ran to the depot, opened the door, and stumbled into the room.</LD>
<LD>   "Help," she cried. "You've got to stop the Midnight Express!" She
was out of breath, shaking with weariness. "And the men that crashed
in the engine down at Honey Creek," she continued, "they need our
help."</LD>
<TE>   The station agent guided her to a bench as Kate continued to talk,
the words all coming in a jumble. Finally, she cried desperately,
"The bridge over Honey Creek is down. Stop the Express!"</TE>
<TE>   Without another word, the night operator set the red reflector in
the lighted semaphore outdoors. Red meant stop to all railroad
engineers. Then the agent tapped out a Morse code message to another
agent, telling him to warn the Midnight Express.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the operator sent out several short blasts on the
station whistle. It told all railroad men who heard it to come to the
station now. Townspeople came too, and soon the rescuers headed for
the accident scene. Kate rode in the cab of an engine as it slowly
re-traced her steps.</TE>
<TE>   When they neared the broken bridge at Honey Creek, Kate hopped out
and helped rescue the train crew. They were soaked through with rain
and one had a broken arm. But they would make it and the Midnight
Express had been stopped in time.</TE>
<TE>   "We're so grateful," one of the men said. "Where's that young girl
who said she would get help for us? Anyone who would crawl across a
bridge like that in the middle of a storm is a true heroine."</TE>
<TE>   Friday: What happens next?</TE>

<HD>Glorious Window on the World of Tulips</HD>
<DH>One woman's floral legacy in Covina is tended, and
expanded, by another.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SMAUS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For nearly half a century, tulips have bloomed in front of this
modest Covina home. The first 19 years, they were planted by the
home's owner, a schoolteacher named Rea Viney, who put in a lovely
bed beside the house. The home's next owner, Helen Crawford, has
continued and expanded the tradition for 30 years.</LD>
<TE>   This is no small feat, considering how difficult it is to grow
tulips well in a climate that is better suited to citrus. But
Crawford, who has thoughtfully planned the garden, gets help from her
friends. For the past 25 years, each day after Thanksgiving, friends
and family plant an amazing 2,300 tulip bulbs. Children who helped
when they were young now have children who help plant, and they are
joined by Crawford's children and grandchildren. It only takes a few
hours, and by 10 a.m., the garden is planted and ready for another
spring. Through the years, this small but spectacular garden has been
featured in The Times, Sunset magazine "and in the local paper about
15 times," Crawford said. Her story has also been included in
"Chicken Soup for the Gardener's Soul," a compilation of inspiring
gardening tales. Flower fever has spread from her garden into many of
the neighbor's frontyards, which are filled this time of the year
with all sorts of colorful annuals and bulbs that bloom in spring,
though only hers depends mostly on tulips, a plant that is not
comfortably at home in Southern California. Getting the display she
does takes a lot of work. You can't simply poke a hole in the ground
and plant a tulip.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford, 79, first spotted the French-Norman house with its tulip
display years ago while driving through the neighborhood with her
daughter. While she was parked on the side of the road admiring the
flowers, "a little old lady came out the door waving her cane at us,"
recalls Crawford. "She wanted us to get out of the car, scolding, 'Do
you think I'd plant all these tulips, if I didn't want people to
enjoy them?'" They did get out of the car, and she can still remember
how pretty the tulips looked. Ten years later, Crawford leaned on her
sofa against a newspaper that she normally never reads and saw a
headline noting that the "tulip lady" had died. She contacted the
heirs and a short while later bought the house in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   Although she's lived on Palm Drive for 30 years, many still call
her home the Viney house. "I keep wondering when they'll start
calling it the Crawford place," she said with mock chagrin.</TE>
<TE>   Each fall, back when orange-packing houses lined the railroad
tracks in Covina, Viney, the daughter of a citrus-growing family,
planted about 800 tulip bulbs imported from the Netherlands, under
the north-facing front window, where they were lightly shaded by the
house. This bed of tulips still exists, but the big show now comes
from a border put in by Crawford that parallels the front walk.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford had observed that in fine English gardens, plants aren't
simply placed around the foundation, but also along paths so you can
walk beside them. Beds of flowers are much more dramatic when viewed
from the ends rather than from the front or sides. Viewed lengthwise,
you can't see the bare dirt between plants. The tulips telescope and
appear tightly packed, a trick that works with any plant but
particularly with those that are spiky or upright.</TE>
<TE>   It was in England that she also saw the prototype for her boxwood
hedge, with its steeply angled sides that are not only dramatic and
focusing, but also guarantee that all the leaves get sunshine. And
she saw how the English backed up their plantings with deep green
shrubs and trees, not the fence or walls of a house. So behind her
tulips, along the property line, several shrubs and a spectacular
dogwood grow under a huge ginkgo. The deciduous trees lightly shade
the tulips from the hot, bleaching sun in spring, then completely
shade the beds in summer. The dogwood is a seedling from an old-timer
that came with the 1932 house and still grows in the yard.</TE>
<TE>   In the big 10-by-60-foot bed that parallels the front walk, she
never plants fewer than 25 tulip bulbs in a group, which partially
accounts for the spectacle. Plantings of less than 25 tend "to gray
out," as Crawford puts it. In total, she plants 100 bulbs for each of
23 kinds each year, but some of these are planted in the narrow beds
on either side of the walk, two weeks after the big bed is planted.
The paving warms the immediate soil just enough to make those bulbs
bloom about two weeks earlier, so she must plant them two weeks later
if all the tulips are to bloom at once.</TE>
<TE>   These two narrow beds run along each side of the brick entry walk,
and the tulip varieties in them are the same as those in the bigger
bed--representatives that can be examined closely so that no one is
tempted to step into the bed for a better view. Crawford is not
particular about the varieties she plants but concentrates on the
colors that create the overall picture. For instance, she chose one
of the tulips because it was purple and feathered, but she had to
check her order to see that it happened to be named 'Blue Heron'.
She's found that just about any tulip variety grows fine. But in
Southern California, tulips are annual flowers; they only last one
season.</TE>
<TE>   The beds bloom for about a month, six weeks in some years, because
other bulbs such as narcissus and hyacinths bloom just before the
tulips and because some of the tulips bloom at slightly different
times. "Not many people would be willing to do all this work for a
mere month of bloom," she admits. But then, she loves tulips. And
their shapes fill more than the frontyard. Inside her home, tulips
are painted on the bathroom walls, where Crawford commissioned a huge
mural of Keukenhof Gardens, the famous tulip display garden in the
Netherlands. There are tulip frescoes on the bedroom ceiling and
abstractions of tulips around the fireplace. There are even
stained-glass tulips embedded in the windows. No wonder some call her
home the "tulip house."In this climate, fresh tulip bulbs must be
ordered every year. Crawford places her huge order in summer and the
bulbs arrive around the first of October. In her garage, she puts the
bags of bulbs in an old-fashioned refrigerator that is not frost-free
(which would dry out the bulbs). There they sit until planting time
at the end of November. This fools the bulbs into thinking they've
been though a short but cold winter, though one must be careful not
to freeze them. Before the planting party arrives, sections of the
beds are excavated to a depth of 8 inches. The excavated soil is
stacked to the side and organic amendments and bulb fertilizer are
mixed into the soil at the bottom of each pit or trench. (It's a
version of the laborious double-digging technique favored by the
English, and it seems to be just what tulips like.)</TE>
<TE>   On planting day, Crawford's friends and family start setting the
bulbs in the bottom of the pits and trenches, spacing them about 2
inches apart, "so they are almost touching," she said. As the areas
are filled with bulbs, the youngest children--with the smallest
feet--place the last few bulbs, even though "it's hard to keep
children from lining everything up in rows," said Crawford, who was a
psychologist and parenting counselor with the Covina public school
system. "That's what they're taught to do in the lower grades," she
said, "but we want the bulbs planted more randomly." Once the bulbs
are in place, the pits and trenches are filled in. Then the areas
where the excavated soil had been stacked are excavated, prepared and
planted.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever the tulips need watering in the winter and spring, the
beds are flooded with 1 or 2 inches of water at a time; overhead
watering with a sprinkler would destroy the fragile flowers and might
even harm emerging leaves. After the big spring bloom, the soil lies
fallow for a while, and then beds, which are shady all summer, are
planted with white impatiens. Crawford plants blue daisies along the
walks. During summer, most of the old tulip bulbs simply rot away. In
the fall, the beds again lie fallow for a few weeks. And then they
are replanted with tulips once more.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It looks as if Celine Dion's two-year break from the stage and
recording studio has only made the hearts of her fans grow fonder.</LD>
<LD>   The pop singer's new album, "A New Day Has Come," entered the
national album chart at No. 1 on Wednesday with the highest
first-week sales total of any collection so far this year.</LD>
<LD>   SoundScan reported that Dion's first album of new material since
"Let's Talk About Love" in 1997 sold 527,000 copies last week, edging
the ninth volume of the "Now That's What I Call Music" compilation
series by 64,000 copies.</LD>
<TE>   Three other albums also debuted in the top 10: "Forceable Entry,"
featuring various rock acts, is No. 3; R&amp;B singer Avant's "Ecstasy"
is No. 6; and the soundtrack for "The Scorpion King" is No. 8.</TE>
<TE>   "Forceable Entry" and "Scorpion" have ties to both rock 'n' roll
and the World Wrestling Federation.</TE>
<TE>   "Forceable Entry," the latest entry in the WWF rock/wrestling
hook-up, features tracks by such acts as Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, Rob
Zombie and Marilyn Manson. The "Scorpion" film stars wrestler the
Rock, while the soundtrack features numbers by such acts as Godsmack,
System of a Down and Coal Chamber.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining positions in the top 10 were claimed by "The Best of
Both Worlds," a collaboration between Jay-Z and R. Kelly (No. 4), the
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack (No. 5), Pink (No. 7), Linkin
Park (No. 9) and Alan Jackson (No. 10).</TE>
<TE>   The nation's best-selling single remains 'N Sync's pairing with
Nelly on "Girlfriend."</TE>

<TE>   French Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve's "Maelstrom" follows a
beautiful young Montreal boutique owner, Bibi Champagne (Marie-Josee
Croze), who is anything but bubbly. As her life takes a downward
spiral that veers into melodrama, tragedy and darkly surreal comedy,
she meets a handsome frogman (Jean-Nicolas Verreault) who may or may
not be her redemption. Pierre Lebeau is the voice of the film's
narrator, a philosophical fish on the verge of death.</TE>

marking the record releases, sharing the high-decibel bill with an
all-female AC/DC homage (Whole Lotta Rosies), an Alanis Morissette

<LD>   Returning to the Southland for what The Times called "an evening
of antic lunacy," the freewheeling, New York-based trio Second Hand
uses an assortment of found objects as props and costumes (hence the
group's name). Studiously irreverent but highly adept at gymnastic
body-sculpture, Marlon Torres, Greg O'Brien and Paul Gordon have
scheduled the West Coast premieres of "Window-7," "The Much,"
"Viklarbo," "Merry-Go-Round" and "Lonesome Cowboy Bob." Old favorites
are also promised, including "Clackers," in which, as the Village
Voice explained, "they've tied triangular wooden pieces under their
buttocks and wooden blocks to their ankles and rap them together
loudly as they dance."</LD>
<LD>   Second Hand, Beckman Auditorium, Caltech, 332 S. Michigan Ave.,
Pasadena. 8 p.m. $14 to $22. (888) 2-CALTECH. Also April 13 at 8 p.m.

hearing-impaired comedian-storyteller Kathy Buckley ("No Labels, No

<TE>   England's Fila Brazillia has been one of electronic music's most
respected forces over the course of its decade-long career, which has
yielded eight albums and remix jobs for the likes of Radiohead, Lamb
and UNKLE. In its latest set, "Jump Leads," the team of Dave McSherry
and Steve Cobby continues to surprise, shedding its "chill out" image
with some heavy funk inflections.</TE>

<TE>   A.R. Gurney grew up in a well-off family in Buffalo, N.Y., and is
known for writing about life amid the comfortable classes of the
American Northeast. "Far East," in its Southern California premiere
at the Laguna Playhouse, is drawn from a different part of his life:
his Navy days stationed in Japan during the early 1950s. The play
concerns a young naval officer who falls in love with a Japanese
woman--to the consternation of the folks back home and the wife of
his commanding officer, who resolves that this East-West twain,
having met, will not remain together.</TE>
<TE>   "Far East," Laguna Playhouse, 606 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna
Beach. Tuesdays to Fridays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays,
2 and 7 p.m. Ends May 5. $38 to $45. (949) 497-2787.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   8pm Dance</TE>
<TE>   No locally based company has caught the imagination of young
audiences as strongly as Jacques Heim's Diavolo Dance Theater, which
uses a gymnastic movement vocabulary to explore unusual physical
environments for dance. In their upcoming program, for instance, the
performers begin "Tete en L'Air" (1994) by streaming down a steep
wooden staircase and end by popping out of trapdoors inside it. In
the two sections of "Trajectoire" (1999 and 2001), they rock the
boat--the set is a large, round-bottom platform that can tip and roll
depending on where they place their weight on it. We're all
conditioned and sometimes undone by the spatial realities of our
homes, offices, modes of transportation. But who besides Diavolo
makes those experiences into potent dance metaphors?</TE>

<CX>   'Adam's' extension--Reservations for the performance of the comedy
evening "Tickling Adam's Rib," at the University of Judaism in Bel-Air
today, Sunday and Tuesday, can be made by calling (310) 476-9777, Ext.
201. The extension is necessary because the university's switchboard is
closed for the Passover holidays. The reservation number ran without the
extension in Thursday's Calendar Weekend and will appear that way again
in Sunday Calendar, which was printed before the error was caught.
Reservations may also be made by calling the show's producer, Jeannine
Frank, at (310) 471-3979.</CX>

<LD>   "Souljacker," the new album from L.A.'s Eels, is quickly drawing
the best reviews of the group's illustrious--if commercially
underachieving--career. And it's not just the hometown daily paper
that has called it the best album so far this year. Time magazine
recently reached the same conclusion.</LD>

and pop music--from old dance tunes to recent jazz, and add singing
and stories into the mix.</TE>

<TE>   Honoring the excellence of artists, teachers, technicians and
others in the Southern California dance community, the annual Lester
Horton Dance Awards are named for the modern dance pioneer who worked
on local stages (including movie sound stages) and launched the
careers of such icons as Alvin Ailey and Bella Lewitzky. Presented by
the Dance Resource Center of Greater Los Angeles (a service
organization), the Hortons have recently become a glittering
black-tie event, though that designation is officially "open to
cultural interpretation" in light of the many, many definitions of
formal attire in our multicultural community. In other words, your
best sarong or sari is just as welcome as a Vera Wang.</TE>

<HD>A Double Dose of Fraying Modern Relationships</HD>
<DH>Full Stop Collective skillfully tackles playwright Hank
Bunker's 'Futon Dialogues,' 'Interview.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP BRANDES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When one of his characters--a frustrated writer --complains that
"sequential narrative has nothing to do with experience," it's a
limitation playwright Hank Bunker is determined to circumvent. His
"Futon Dialogues" contorts chronology as a strategy for exploring a
dysfunctional relationship.</LD>
<LD>   Combining "Futon Dialogues" with Bunker's more linear but equally
edgy "The Interview" at Silver Lake's Salvation Theatre, Full Stop
Collective offers a skillfully staged plunge into this L.A.
playwright's dark, elliptical style, through complementary sardonic
portraits of modern couples.</LD>
<LD>   "Futon Dialogues" is a series of encounters in which each of its
two characters moves through time in the opposite direction. In each
scene, the future awaiting writer Marle (TraceTurville) is the past
for her slacker boyfriend, Peter (Mat Blair). As Marle tries to move
forward with her life, exploring new possibilities and encountering
setbacks (both external and self-imposed), Peter retreats into an
increasingly narrow universe bounded by the dimensions of his
comforting futon.</LD>
<TE>   Trading incisive barbs as they wrestle with the aftermath of
Marle's recent lapse in fidelity, the pair can't help but trip over
one another's vulnerabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, Bunker shrewdly uses the conceit that their histories
never overlap, to exaggerate the gulfs in communication and
understanding between them.</TE>
<TE>   Turville's is the more intriguing performance here--not only is
her character's forward-moving arc easier to follow, but she wrings
an impressive range of emotional reactions from the abstract,
absurdist context.</TE>
<TE>   Blair's Peter is a more one-note portrayal, without the risks or
rewards of playful character exploration.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Interview," another alienated couple (Kyle Christopherson
and Sarah Phemister) find their home invaded by a journalist (David
Mersault) who wants to chronicle their lives in a magazine article.</TE>
<TE>   Preying on their most primal desires, this Mephistophelean house
guest alternates as inquisitor, seducer and destroyer of their
increasingly frayed marriage. Trading the existential whimsy of
"Futon Dialogues" for Pinter-esque menace, director Pete Konerko
ensures atmosphere and tone are always appropriate to this
challenging material.</TE>

<HD>This Workout's a Grind</HD>
<DH>Fitness instructor Jeff Costa leads a sexy style of dance
aerobics for the uninhibited: the Cardio Striptease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICTORIA LOOSELEAF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Janet Jackson's "Throb" is cranked up full blast as 50 bodies slither
back and forth across the wood floor. The group slowly rises in
unison--with precision that would do the Rockettes proud--and heads
start to swing with abandon, hair flying. A guy with a shaved head
wearing a custom-made dog collar attached to a single, cut-out
leather sleeve beseeches the group's members to touch themselves.</LD>
<LD>   "Run your hands over your body. Enjoy yourself," coos Jeff Costa
through his headset microphone before demonstrating a perfectly
executed series of spins.</LD>
<LD>   What's up in this mirror-lined room that's steamy from sweat?
"Fosse" auditions? A new type of primal therapy? Kundalini yoga?</LD>
<TE>   No, it's Cardio Striptease, a workout that was dreamed up by
31-year-old Costa, designed, he says, both to build self-esteem and
shed pounds while shedding clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Working out at a health club has always embraced a kind of
exhibitionism, and at Crunch Gym, beautiful faces, hard bodies and
six-pack abs are already displayed with some abandon. But channeling
sexual energy into exercise has taken on new meaning since Costa
began teaching his class last June.</TE>
<TE>   "A few things motivate people," Costa says after class, his eyes
sparkling, his buff arms glistening from perspiration, "and those are
sex and working out. I put them together."</TE>
<TE>   Costa has emerged at the forefront of the competitive world of
fitness classes, where a new thing--spinning, candlelight yoga, Tae
Bo, Pilates--can become all the rage.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Cape Cod, Mass., the limber-limbed Costa studied French,
English and dance at Boston University before joining the
Boston-based jazz company Impulse Dance in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the dancer-choreographer moved to Los Angeles, where he
has since carved out a niche for himself in the health and fitness
arena. Besides teaching Cardio Striptease, which he recently launched
at Crunch's Tokyo, New York and Miami branches, Costa also teaches
step aerobics, hip-hop, an aqua fitness class and advanced aerobics
at health clubs around town. In addition, Costa teaches on cruise
ships, has appeared in music videos and has, on occasion, strutted
his well-toned body up and down a model's catwalk.</TE>
<TE>   But it's his bump-and-grind routines that have brought Costa a
measure of prominence. Cardio Striptease, a name he trademarked, has
been written up in Playboy and the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   "Stripping," he declares, "is boring, but striptease is hot. At
gyms there's always an element of sex, with people meeting each
other, looking at bodies, flirting. Let's not pretend it's
otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   Costa sounds like a positive-thinking graduate of a Tony Robbins
seminar when he explains the popularity of Cardio Striptease. "Middle
America wants to know how to be provocative, how to be seductive.
'Moulin Rouge' is a huge hit, Victoria's Secret commercials are all
over TV. Cardio Striptease is going to be the next Tae Bo," Costa
says confidently, referring to Billy Blanks' phenomenally successful
workout that blends aerobics with boxing and martial arts.</TE>
<TE>   If the swollen attendance at Costa's class is any indication, it
appears the fitness guru is on to something. His pupils range in age
from 18 to 70-something, 80% of them women.</TE>
<TE>   Only a handful of men show up each week to throw attitude, gyrate
and shamelessly preen. A Beverly Hills real estate agent who declined
to give his name but gladly stripped off his shirt, flashing some
skin while bumping up against a girl doing squats and lunges, said,
"Here I am, a straight guy, who thought the class would be too
girlie. But I think Jeff's special and can pull this off. It's fun
[and] it's really good exercise."</TE>
<TE>   Some classes feature tear-away pants, feather boas and stripping
poles, but this evening's workout involves an erotic routine
performed around chairs. (Eat your heart out, Liza Minnelli.) Most of
the students have removed at least one article of clothing before the
routine ends. In addition, those who wear them begin snapping their
thongs.</TE>
<TE>   Included is Michelle, a 33-year-old accounting coordinator for a
cosmetics company, who flaunts her black-lace thong. She takes the
class, she says, because it celebrates sensuality. "But I think I
need kneepads," she notes, "because crawling around on the floor is
tough on the knees."</TE>
<TE>   Retired secretary Thelma Ostlow, an admitted "senior citizen,"
chooses to sway rather than crawl on the floor. But, dressed in
sweats, she doesn't hesitate to fling her T-shirt off and twirl it
over her head. "It makes me feel great--like I'm young again."</TE>
<TE>   Costa dims the lights for the final routine in the 45-minute
class. The class moves to the large glass wall, where, from the other
side, weightlifters between sets can ogle their shimmying forms. They
leave streaked handprints on the glass like an erotic calling card.
"Thank you all for coming," Costa says earnestly at the end. "God
bless you, I love you. Now go home and have sex."</TE>

<HD>Brew Pubs With Untapped Potential</HD>
<DH>Microbreweries, a hit elsewhere, still try to catch on in
L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HESEON PARK</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ask any microbrew aficionado, and he'll tell you: L.A. just isn't a
beer town. Restaurants here boast multi-page wine lists. Trendy bars
brand themselves with cocktails du jour.</LD>
<LD>   L.A.'s microbreweries have their work cut out for them. They have
a city to convince that beer has a rightful place outside Dodger
games and fraternity parties.</LD>
<LD>   "L.A. is definitely a cocktail place, and we're about educating
people about what good beer looks and tastes like," says Jake
Tringali, manager of Bonaventure Brewing Co. in downtown Los Angeles.
Microbreweries, which took off in other parts of the country in the
1990s, are still trying to make inroads in Southern California. Los
Angeles doesn't have the built-in beer-appreciating culture that
comes with large German and Irish immigrant communities. Angelenos
are still familiarizing themselves with brew pubs, places that make
and sell beer on the premises, such as popular brewery chain
restaurants Gordon Biersch in Pasadena and Rock Bottom Brewery in
Long Beach.</LD>
<TE>   The hotel location of the Bonaventure Brewing Co. provides an
advantage: Conventioneers and out-of-towners are familiar with brew
pubs' unhurried atmosphere as a respite. As for the locals,
Tringali's still trying to educate them about life beyond Budweiser.
"The way I describe drinking a microbrewed beer is like going into a
bakery and eating bread there. It's so fresh and so good," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Beer tasters are a common starting point. The Bonaventure's Five
Tower Sampler comes with taster-size glasses (5 ounces) with
descriptions for a signature Stout, Pale Ale, Blonde, Strawberry
Blonde and a seasonally brewed beer of the month.</TE>
<TE>   Brewmaster David Blackwell shuttles back and forth between
Bonaventure Brewing Co. and its sister brewery, Belmont Brewing Co.
in Long Beach, concocting and formulating each batch of tailor-made
brew. He thinks it's just a matter of time before microbrews are as
popular here as elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "People's palates have become more sophisticated; there are
premium vodkas, cigars, wines and beers," he says. "People's skills
transfer from wine to beer. Their palates are used to strong flavors
in wine, like a robust cabernet. It's pretty flavorful stuff, as is a
stout."</TE>
<TE>   One glance at a popular brew pub like Belmont Brewing shows that
there are already a number of converts. Belmont's seven-barrel system
produces some mean, award-winning brews: the Marathon Ale, a light
golden ale; Top Sail, an amber ale; Long Beach Crude, a stout; and a
fruity Strawberry Blonde have all garnered prizes and acclaim.</TE>
<TE>   In Koreatown, Rosen Brewery has a colorful scene, with a line of
black-leather-jacketed individuals snaking along the sidewalk, mostly
young professionals and residents from Koreatown's hipster contingent
and nearby Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "We're educating Korean Americans about beer," says Mike Rim,
owner of Rosen Brewery. Inspired in part by Gordon Biersch
restaurants and visiting microbreweries out of state, Rim opened shop
two years ago. "From here to Santa Monica, to Hollywood, no one had a
microbrewery in Koreatown."</TE>
<TE>   Rosen Brewery raises the bar on how microbreweries look and feel.
Slightly dimmed lights dramatize the scope and scale of this
glorified brew pub. A two-story wall of glass reveals the
state-of-the-art brew tanks sitting in one corner. Wrap-around
banquette seating creates a 1940s supper club vibe.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen's brewmaster, Brandon Blankenship, crafts a cleaner,
lighter-tasting roster of microbrews. Order a sampler and get five
tiny (4-ounce) tasters: Rosen Lite, a light ale; Sunset Red, an amber
ale; the Koreatown Ale, an English-style ale; California Wheat; and
the chocolaty Hollywood Dark Stout.</TE>
<TE>   But even here, in Rosen's theatrical setting, beer can't escape
the baseball game. Over the bar is probably the largest TV ever to
grace a Southern California bar, making Rosen a popular place to
catch the game after work.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Crown City Brewery in Pasadena cultivates a friendly
sports bar atmosphere, with multiple TVs tuned to different games.
Probably the oldest brew pub in the Southern California area, the
Crown City barkeeps also try to know everyone's name. "We've been
called the 'Cheers of the West Coast' by the Zagat Guide," says Crown
City's Manager, Ed Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to its own handcrafted brews, the Arroyo Amber Ale and
Mt. Wilson Wheat, Crown City has a wide-ranging specialty and import
beer menu. Customers who sign up for Crown City's "Passport" get to
track the international beers they've tried. Once they taste 100, 500
or 1,000 beers, Passport holders get a T-shirt and their name
inscribed on a brass plaque on the bar's "hall of fame."</TE>
<TE>   Drew Beechum, an engineer from Pasadena, has 15 more beers until
he gets his 500th beer plaque.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been all over L.A., and Crown City is the only place where
they actually care about the customer, and who you are," he says. "It
reminds me of pubs in England, where everyone's relaxed, having a
pint or two."</TE>

<HD>Does It Really Exist?</HD>
<DH>A distinctly female sense of humor, that is. Six comics
think it over.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE GORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is there such a thing as women's humor?</LD>
<LD>   Consider the six women who will be performing during "Tickling
Adam's Rib," a three-day, four-performance comedy series, starring
only women, that starts Saturday at the University of Judaism.</LD>
<LD>   None of them plans to do the typical--and what some of them call
distinctly male--stand-up thing: setup, punch line, setup, punch
line.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, one performer will play answering machine messages from
her mom. Another will wear a dress that features a giant,
silk-screened photograph of her root canal. Yet another will sing
cabaret-style songs with themes like "How I Found Out My Boyfriend
Was Cheating."</TE>
<TE>   So that must be women's humor. Right?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not. Depending on which performer you ask, there is such a
thing, or there isn't, or there might be.</TE>
<TE>   You know. Six comedians. Nine opinions.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the point of view held by Flash Rosenberg. As a
backgrounder, she's the one with the root canal dress, and she'll be
hosting the event. She refuses to do jokes about hair, fashion or
weight.</TE>
<TE>   She is from New York and will do jokes based on what can best be
termed as visual aids: slides, for example. There will also be a
dress made out of "balloon skin," crafted by interns.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg cannot resist comparing men's jokes with men's plumbing.
Warning: Ribaldry ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "My humor is in contrast to the typical, ejaculative humor, like,
here is the joke, it's coming, it's coming ... now!" says Rosenberg,
an artist and photographer who has legally changed her name from
Susan to Flash.</TE>
<TE>   "But people will watch my work and say, wait, now that was funny."</TE>
<TE>   So, she says, there may indeed be such a thing as female comedy,
and hers may be it, but she's not 100% sure about that.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Amy Borkowsky, also from New York, also not much help
on the question of women's humor.</TE>
<TE>   She's the one with the answering machine. Borkowsky has saved
nearly all of the telephone messages she has received over the past
14 years, including those from "guys canceling dates because the
exterminator is coming" and an obscene caller that she suspects is a
taxi driver who once overheard her describing her act.</TE>
<TE>   As far as whether female comedy exists, Borkowsky has no idea.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if there is or there isn't, and that is my point of
view," Borkowsky says. "Men and women have different experiences, so
I guess so.</TE>
<TE>   "But," she adds quickly, "the stuff I do tends to cross over."</TE>
<TE>   Even Jeannine Frank, the organizer of the event, has no solid
opinion on the matter. Far from a feminist scholar, Frank first got
started in entertainment 12 years ago, organizing comedy shows in
people's living rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Her favorite performers are comic lyricists, in the genre of Tom
Lehrer. One of Frank's favorite comedians works for a natural history
museum and sings dressed as Charles Darwin.</TE>
<TE>   She insists she had no agenda, such as promoting "female humor,"
in organizing a lineup of all women comedians.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to think thematically," she insists.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Marie Kane, a singer described in the "Adam's Rib"
lineup as a "piano comic." Kane seems to have a more solid
understanding of the matter at hand.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the comedians surveyed, Kane comes closest to thinking that
women's comedy does exist.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think that men and women find different things funny," she
says. "The Three Stooges. Men always laugh at them.... I think that
women don't find excrement jokes or fart jokes funny, but men, they
just do."</TE>
<TE>   Her theory on why?</TE>
<TE>   "We're just smarter," she says. "Sorry."</TE>

<HD>A Bit of New Mexico Pulls Into Town</HD>
<DH>Santa Fe Station offers far more than your usual
Southwestern fare, but please hold the diesel oil.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Odd idea, Santa Fe Station--going for a train station theme here
directly north of the Long Beach Municipal Airport.</LD>
<LD>   But that's just what this restaurant is doing. It's basically a
Southwestern place, complete with strings of dried peppers hanging on
the booths--and also model train tracks up near the ceiling and menu
sections labeled "Caboose Specialties" and so on. Fortunately, the
food is generally good, sometimes downright distinctive.</LD>
<LD>   Take the soups. You don't just get the usual Southwestern choices
of black bean or tortilla. On Monday, there's fideo soup with
chipotle, like a tomato-vermicelli soup with a mischievous bite of
smoked jalapeno. Wednesday's special is a rich carrot puree with sour
cream.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, you actually do get a tortilla soup, like an
old-fashioned vegetable soup that just happens to have some avocado,
sour cream and bright red tortilla strips in it. The corn chowder
(Friday through Sunday) is quite like a seafood chowder: potatoes in
a creamy sauce with corn kernels more or less standing in for clams.</TE>
<TE>   The menu lists tacos, wraps, burritos, flautas and fajitas as well
as "main dishes" such as enchiladas, altogether 47 options when you
figure in all the pork, beef and chicken variations, and they're not
necessarily what you'd think.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, tacos de brocheta don't have the usual taco topping
but something like fajitas: meat, onions and bell peppers fried
together (beef gets fried quite brown). This goes onto tortillas,
followed by some cheese, and the plate is put under a salamander
until the cheese melts. This is one of the very few restaurants where
a waiter has to warn you, "Very hot plate," when you've ordered
tacos.</TE>
<TE>   In New Mexico, enchiladas are often stacked because blue corn
tortillas are too flimsy to roll up. The New Mexico enchiladas here
use three ordinary corn tortillas, but they're still stacked, with
your choice of meat, sauce and Cheddar or Jack. The pork is tender
and the red sauce hot, but not seriously so by New Mexico standards.</TE>
<TE>   There are also enchiladas suizas blanketed with a very rich, tart
combination of tomatillo sauce, melted Jack and sour cream. Various
other enchiladas come in red, green or mole poblano sauce. The
poblano sauce, which also comes in its accustomed place on pollo con
mole, is notable for its restraint. Instead of overdoing the
sweetness and chocolate flavor, it has more of a nutty flavor like
ground pumpkin seeds.</TE>
<TE>   Carne asada appears to be skirt steak, nicely charred (El Paso
asada is the same topped with smoked cheese and chopped New Mexico
peppers with a strong green chile flavor). The Santa Fe carnitas are
not the usual stewed and/or fried pork--the meat is wrapped in banana
leaves and baked, in effect steaming it. It's like very good roast
pork, tender and flavorful, though it could use something by way of a
sauce.</TE>
<TE>   You may be a little surprised to see barbecued ribs on this menu.
They aren't really barbecued--they're baked--but quite good anyway.
You get a 1 1/2-pound rack of baby back ribs, moist and meaty, glazed
with a barbecue sauce with a bracing dash of vinegar in it, showing
again, as in the mole poblano, that this place disdains over-sweet
sauces.</TE>
<TE>   Tacos come with rice and beans, burritos with guacamole and sour
cream and ribs with rice and plantains, but most of the main dishes
give you soup or salad (go for the soup) and a choice of two sides,
which include rather rugged grilled vegetables and the enjoyable
fideo pasta, more or less Spanish rice made with vermicelli.</TE>
<TE>   The dessert list is just sopaipillas (fry bread), flan or the rich
platanos enmielados (caramelized bananas). Breakfast includes
familiar American and Mexican choices, such as New Mexico ranchero:
fried eggs on tortillas, Jack and mole sauce. One of the big
attractions of breakfast is a chewy roll called birote.</TE>
<TE>   I've liked nearly everything I've had here, but I have to say I
haven't tried the "Diesel Locomotive Salads." You can take a theme
too far, and the suggestion of diesel oil on my salad is where I draw
the line.</TE>

<HD>Tapas and Wine Mix at Primitivo</HD>
<DH>The Abbot Kinney bistro is a hit with the chic bohemians in
the neighborhood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least one block of Abbot Kinney Boulevard is full of life after
nightfall. That's Venice's restaurant row, so to speak, where the
newly expanded Joe's Restaurant, Lilly's Cafe and the new Primitivo
Wine Bistro all share the same valet station, and it's rare to see an
empty seat in any of them.</LD>
<LD>   I'd been hearing about Primitivo from wine buffs and finally had
the chance to check it out recently. It made the perfect late-night
dinner stop on the way to the airport to take the red-eye to New
York.</LD>
<LD>   What a change from Fabio, the mediocre Italian restaurant that
previously inhabited this space. Named for the Italian grape that DNA
fingerprinting has established as identical to Zinfandel, Primitivo
has hit on a concept that appeals to the chic bohemians in the
neighborhood. The place is thronged, both the long, welcoming bar and
the tables.</LD>
<TE>   Primitivo offers good wines at fair prices, plus an entire page of
tapas, along with a handful of main courses for those who want to eat
something more substantial. Tapas are the way to go. Order them a few
at a time so there's somewhere to put them on the table.</TE>
<TE>   First of all, a bowl of oil-slicked green and black olives from
Greece, maybe a little baked goat cheese to spread on crouton rafts,
not forgetting an order of tortilla Espanola, Spain's frittata made
with eggs, potatoes and onions in the classic version. But you can
also order it larded with chorizo.</TE>
<TE>   Though the new chef comes from a tapas bar in Spain, the "little
dishes" hail from all around the Mediterranean. There's a nice
platter of cold cuts from Italy, a tangy hummus from the Middle East
paired with Italian flatbread, a Provencal baked tomato stuffed with
breadcrumbs and herbs, and quite decent calamari fritti, fried
calamari with a hot pepper-spiked arrabbiata or "angry" sauce.</TE>
<TE>   To finish off that bottle of Rioja or Chianti, save some room for
the well-chosen cheese platter. Or, if you're still feeling peckish,
dig into a plate of linguine alla vongole made with Manila clams and
a nice balance of olive oil, white wine and garlic, or a simple
grilled lamb chop with a minty yogurt sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and don't forget the potatoes roasted with rosemary.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Primitivo Wine Bistro, 1025 Abbot Kinney Blvd., Venice; (310)
396-5353. Open for dinner only Monday through Saturday, 5 p.m. to
midnight; until 1 a.m. (but no ordering after midnight) Friday and
Saturday. Tapas $3 to $12; main courses $9 to $17. Valet parking.</TE>

<HD>Beyond Sunset Blvd.</HD>
<DH>Billy Wilder's favorite spots in L.A. reflect the
appreciation he had for his adopted home and its people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAMERON CROWE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The celebrated writer-director Billy Wilder, who died last week at
95, was one of Los Angeles' most famous residents. Born in Vienna,
Wilder made movies that showed a grand affection for the city he
adopted after arriving in 1934. He drew boundless inspiration from
the color and the characters, and the opportunities the growing film
world provided a young screenwriter. When I sought him out more than
60 years later, and our meetings grew into the book "Conversations
With Wilder," his recollections of early Los Angeles were still
fresh.</LD>
<LD>   "When I came here, Sunset Boulevard was in the country," Wilder
recalled in 1997, sitting in his Brighton Way office in Beverly
Hills. "It was not even asphalted. People lived around Vine Street,
and Santa Monica Boulevard and Hollywood Boulevard. The Sunset
Boulevard that we've built up since the war ... the high-rises that
were started, they were once meadows."</LD>
<LD>   The key word there is "we." Wilder took the city to heart. Soon
his movies were populated with vivid characterizations and depictions
that could have come only from Los Angeles. From the ridiculously
venal to the gloriously naive, these were the characters that would
soon become his unforgettable screen creations.</LD>
<TE>   And the city embraced Wilder with equal enthusiasm. Even in his
early 90s, I often noted the special bounce in his gait as he walked
the city streets with Audrey Wilder, his wife of more than 50 years.
(On Sunday afternoons, however, nothing could tear him away from the
Dodgers telecast.)</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, there are tours available for just about anything.
This is one you won't find anywhere else. Here's a guide to some of
Billy Wilder's favorite haunts, the spots where he lived and worked,
and the ones he often said made the town indelible in his memory.</TE>
<TE>   The Lot,</TE>
<TE>   1041 N. Formosa Ave.</TE>
<TE>   Originally Samuel Goldwyn Studios. The second floor of the
writer's building is where Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond penned
some of their finest scripts. More accurately, Diamond wrote while
Wilder paced. According to Wilder, "I never sat down in 50 years."
Moving briskly around the room, often carrying a riding crop, Wilder
worked with his beloved co-writer "Izzy" to craft some of the
greatest movies of modern times. Just a few steps down the studio
street, on Stage 4, Wilder filmed "The Apartment." The director
achieved the memorable task of re-creating the huge accounting firm
that employed beleaguered hero C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) by filling
the back of the small stage with miniature desks and cutout figures.</TE>
<TE>   20th Century Fox,</TE>
<TE>   10201 W. Pico Blvd.</TE>
<TE>   The iconic image of Marilyn Monroe's white dress fluttering with
the gust from a subway grate was first shot for Wilder's "The Seven
Year Itch" on a chaotic fan-filled Lexington Avenue in New York City.
The director knew he'd need greater control and later returned to Los
Angeles to shoot the close-ups on the 20th Century Fox lot.</TE>
<TE>   Today, an enormous mural of "Seven Year Itch" stars Monroe and Tom
Ewell adorns the side of the entire New York Street building, not far
from the spot where the memorable sequence was completed.</TE>
<TE>   Paramount Studios,</TE>
<TE>   5555 Melrose Ave.</TE>
<TE>   Paramount was Wilder's first studio home as a writer in Hollywood.
It was also the lot where he earned his stripes as a director. Wilder
filmed on virtually every one of the studio's stages. The final
stairway sequence of "Sunset Boulevard," in which Norma Desmond
(Gloria Swanson) declared herself ready for one final close-up, took
place on Stage 18. Wilder's primary office was on the third floor of
what is now the Ernst Lubitsch building, the site of his early
collaborations with Charles Brackett, Raymond Chandler and others.</TE>
<TE>   Lucy's Restaurant,</TE>
<TE>   Windsor and Melrose</TE>
<TE>   The actual building has long since been torn down, but directly
across the street from Paramount was once a restaurant where some say
more business was conducted than on the lot itself. Lucy's (not to be
confused with Lucy's El Adobe) was the '40s watering hole where many
a working writer, director, executive or star cooled his or her heels
or even knocked back a drink before returning to the studio fray.
It's also a historic location in the career of Billy Wilder.</TE>
<TE>   One fateful afternoon Wilder was lunching with Charles Brackett.
The two writers ran into actor Charles Boyer, who was then filming
their script of "Hold Back the Dawn" with director Mitchell Leisen.
Boyer cavalierly mentioned that he had stricken one of the best
sequences in the script, a moment in which his character delivered a
glorious speech to a cockroach on a motel wall. Wilder decided to
become a director at that moment to protect his scripts from further
maiming. (Boyer also met his karmic justice. Wilder and Brackett
returned to their office and promptly rewrote the ending of the film
to exclude Boyer and emphasize the leading lady, Paulette Goddard.
"If he's not talking to the cockroach," recalled Wilder, "he's not
talking to anybody!")</TE>
<TE>   The Corner of Melrose and</TE>
<TE>   La Cienega</TE>
<TE>   This corner held strong memories for Wilder. At the end of a long
shooting day, it was always at the same spot--traveling down Melrose
and turning right at La Cienega--when he realized the brilliant
solutions to the problems of the day. Always, he recalled, when it
was just a little too late. For Billy Wilder, the corner forever
represented the directing process in all of its beautiful agony.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Chow,</TE>
<TE>   344 N. Camden Drive</TE>
<TE>   The director's favorite restaurant is run by his good friend
Michael Chow. The first table on the left as you enter the main
dining room is revered as Billy Wilder's table. Though he hadn't
directed a film in 21 years, Wilder was well-known and accessible to
modern-day Hollywood. Many an actor or director met the great Wilder,
sharing in his memorable stories, sitting at this table.</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Rockets,</TE>
<TE>   474 N. Beverly Drive</TE>
<TE>   Another favorite Wilder hangout is the lively spot he often
visited for lunch. Billy enjoyed the pure Americana of the place, as
well as the chili, and in the last year of his life something
miraculous happened here. Famously not a fan of rock 'n' roll, Wilder
finally heard one song from the rock era that reached him, courtesy
of the Johnny Rockets jukebox. It was Elvis Presley's aching ballad
"Are You Lonesome Tonight?"</TE>
<TE>   Kate Mantilini's,</TE>
<TE>   9101 Wilshire Blvd.</TE>
<TE>   Wilder was fond of Kate Mantilini's because of the atmosphere, the
waiters and waitresses, and one specific item on their menu: calf's
brains.</TE>
<TE>   Owners Harry and Marilyn Lewis always kept the dish in the
kitchen, just in case Wilder called for a reservation. Few others
ever ordered it. It didn't matter. Just having it on hand was the
restaurant's tip of the hat to one of its most valued customers.</TE>
<TE>   The Corner of Irving</TE>
<TE>   and Wilshire</TE>
<TE>   The search for the perfect gothic house for "Sunset Boulevard"
ended on this corner. Wilder spotted a two-story home and declared it
perfect. "We got it from an early wife of Paul Getty," Wilder
remembered. "She conducted a school for acting there." The swimming
pool where Joe Gillis (William Holden) would meet his watery doom was
constructed, filmed, and later filled in with dirt by Getty, who
leveled the place and replaced it with one of his oil company
offices. "I used to hang around there quite a bit while we built the
little touches," said Wilder. "Sad that it is gone."</TE>
<TE>   The Wilders'</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills Residence,</TE>
<TE>   704 Beverly Drive</TE>
<TE>   Though Billy and Audrey Wilder moved to Century City in 1956, many
vivid memories remained from the house he and Audrey formerly
occupied in Beverly Hills. The regular site of some of the
outstanding social events of the era, or a meeting place for card
games with friends like Cary Grant or neighboring director William
Wyler, Wilder recently declared, "it was a place of many wonderful
memories, our home in the flats of Beverly Hills." Aviator Charles
Lindbergh, then the most recognizable face in the world, once turned
up on the doorstep for a discussion about Wilder's then-upcoming
"Spirit of St. Louis." There was no car in sight. "I took the bus
from Pasadena," said Lindbergh.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Wilder's Office,</TE>
<TE>   9538 Brighton Way</TE>
<TE>   On the second floor of this unmarked office building, just above a
small coffee shop (now a shoe store) was Billy Wilder's office for
many years. In his 80s and well into his 90s, Wilder worked out of
Room 204 and then later moved across the hall to Room 211. Wilder's
routine brought him to the cozy location almost daily, where he
sorted mail, answered phone calls himself and looked out on the
Beverly Hills street traffic with true affection for the colorful
personalities below.</TE>
<TE>   Many tourists looking for celebrities never spotted the renowned
director framed in the double window just above their heads. Others
saw the familiar sight of Wilder, cane in hand, briskly moving down
Brighton Way on his way to lunch. To those who noticed him on the
street, his greeting was always brisk and polite. "Hi, how are you?"
Often he would sign a poster, or a scrap of paper before declaring,
"Good to see you. I cannot be late." And with that, the always dapper
Billy Wilder moved down the street, sometimes waving at honking
passersby, always arriving at his destination precisely on time.</TE>

<LD>There's no better way to honor Billy Wilder's contributions to motion
pictures than by watching some of the 26 films he directed. A few are
screening around Los Angeles in the next few weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Some Like It Hot (1959)</LD>
<LD>   Marilyn Monroe as a singer named Sugar Kane. Jack Lemmon in drag.
Tony Curtis parodying Cary Grant's accent. It doesn't get any better
than this hide-from-the-mob comedy written by Wilder and longtime
collaborator I.A.L. Diamond. Lemmon and Curtis don dresses and join
an all-girl jazz band after they witness the St. Valentine's Day
massacre. The fabulous Hotel de Coronado, near San Diego, stands in
for Miami, where the girls deal with their gangster problem and their
romantic entanglements.</LD>
<TE>   April 12, 7:30 p.m.; April 13, 2:50 and 7:30 p.m. at the New
Beverly Theatre, 7165 Beverly Blvd., L.A., (323) 938-4038.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Apartment (1960)</TE>
<TE>   Made the year after "Some Like It Hot," this is the darker flip
side of Wilder's comedy. Jack Lemmon plays C.C. Baxter, an anonymous
insurance clerk in a huge firm who's found a way to be useful: He
loans out his apartment to company managers who need a place to
rendezvous with their mistresses. The awkward situation gets more so
when he discovers a love interest, Fran (Shirley MacLaine), is one of
the mistresses. Though not the same kind of crowd-pleaser as "Some
Like It Hot," it won five Oscars, including best picture, best
director and best writing (again, with I.A.L. Diamond).</TE>
<TE>   April 12, 9:50 p.m.; April 13, 5:10 and 9:50 p.m. at the New
Beverly Theatre, 7165 Beverly Blvd., L.A., (323) 938-4038.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Witness for the Prosecution (1957)</TE>
<TE>   This adaptation of Agatha Christie's story and stage play is
dramatic courtroom fare, where an ailing attorney (Charles Laughton)
defends an unemployed man (Tyrone Power) accused of murdering a
wealthy widow. His wife (Marlene Dietrich) is his alibi, until she
testifies for the prosecution. The film garnered six Oscar
nominations, and Laughton's performance was a favorite of Wilder's.</TE>
<TE>   April 13, 2 and 8 p.m. at the Alex Theatre, 216 N. Brand Blvd.,
Glendale. $7, matinee; $8.50, evening. (818) 243-2539 or
www.AlexFilmSociety.org.</TE>

<AU>ROBIN RAUZI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Written by Billy Wilder with D.M. Marshman Jr. and Charles Brackett,
"Sunset Boulevard" (1950) is one of the most quotable scripts in
American motion pictures. "I am big. It's the pictures that got
small," wails silent-film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), when
she first encounters screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden). Months
later, completely crazed, she looks right into the camera and says,
"All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up."</LD>
<LD>   From its first moments, in voice-over--"Friend, this is Sunset
Boulevard, Los Angeles, California"--the movie is full of pithy
observations about Hollywood. From Gillis' apartment, "on Ivar, above
Franklin," to Schwab's fabled drugstore, to the back lot of
Paramount, "Sunset Boulevard" captures a Hollywood that's the stuff
of fantasies, even as it ruins the lives of many in the film. It's a
dark portrait of people desperate to gain--and regain--Hollywood's
attention.</LD>
<LD>   Gillis, the prototype for generations of starving screenwriters,
who winds up face-down in the swimming pool, makes the most biting
observations:</LD>
<TE>   Trying to borrow $300 from his agent: "If I lose my car, it's like
having my legs cut off."</TE>
<TE>   Upon first arriving at Norma Desmond's mansion: "It was a great
big white elephant of a place. The kind crazy movie people built back
in the crazy '20s."</TE>
<TE>   About her $28,000 custom-built car: "She'd take me for rides in
the hills above Sunset. The whole thing was upholstered in leopard
skin and had one of those car phones, all gold-plated."</TE>
<TE>   When he moves into her house: "The last week in December the rain
came, a great big package of rain, oversized, like everything else in
California."</TE>
<TE>   Trying to escape Desmond's grasp on New Year's Eve: "There was
bound to be a New Year's shindig going on in his apartment down on
Las Palmas. Writers without a job. Composers without a publisher.
Actresses so young they still believed the guys in the casting
office."</TE>
<TE>   Confronting her as he tries to leave her: "Norma, you're a woman
of 50. There's nothing tragic about being 50--unless you're trying to
be 25."</TE>
<TE>   After his death: "By this time the whole joint was jumping--cops,
reporters, neighbors, passersby--as big a whoop-dee-do as we get in
Los Angeles when they open a supermarket. Even the newsreel guys came
by."</TE>
<TE>   Wilder wrote "Double Indemnity" (1944) with Raymond Chandler,
creating the quintessential Los Angeles film noir. Again, the story
is told with a voice-over, almost entirely in flashback, as insurance
salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) dictates his confession.</TE>
<TE>   Neff and his accomplice, Phyllis (Barbara Stanwyck), plot their
high-stakes claim in and around Los Feliz. Jerry's market is their
rendezvous spot, down the hill from Phyllis' hillside house with a
view of Griffith Park. Neff sizes up the house in the opening moments
of the movie: "I remembered this auto insurance renewal near Los
Feliz Boulevard, so I drove over there. It was one of those
California Spanish houses that everyone was so nuts about 10 or 15
years ago. This one must have cost someone about 30,000 bucks, that
is if he ever finished paying for it."</TE>
<TE>   Neff talks like a detective from a Chandler novel, and "Double
Indemnity" is full of hard-boiled quips: "They'll hang you just as
sure as 10 dimes will buy a dollar," he says, and "I couldn't hear my
own footsteps. It was the walk of a dead man."</TE>
<TE>   The scene where Neff first encounters the flirtatious Phyllis
demonstrates patter that has made "Double Indemnity" a classic. "I'm
from California, born right here in Los Angeles," she tells him, as
they're sitting on her sofa. He replies: "They say all native
Californians come from Iowa."</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, just as he's about to leave but is coming on
strong, she puts on the brakes, at least momentarily:</TE>
<TE>   "There's a speed limit in this state, Mr. Neff, 45 miles an hour."</TE>
<TE>   "How fast was I going, officer?"</TE>
<TE>   "I'd say around 90."</TE>
<TE>   "Suppose you get down off your motorcycle and give me a ticket."</TE>
<TE>   "Suppose I let you off with a warning this time."</TE>
<TE>   "Suppose it doesn't take."</TE>
<TE>   "Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles."</TE>
<TE>   "Suppose I bust out crying and put my head on your shoulder."</TE>
<TE>   "Suppose you try putting it on my husband's shoulder."</TE>

<DH>Franklin Canyon hikes feature filmland tales of location
shooting.</DH>

<AU>VALERIE J. NELSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We are hiking in the footsteps of Hollywood legends. Clark Gable was
here, taking orders from Frank Capra for "It Happened One Night."
Jodie Foster too, jogging around a Virginia lake at the start of
"Silence of the Lambs." The infantrymen of TV's "Combat" battled
across Europe, using as their base a dirt parking lot framed by
enough nonnative trees to make Franklin Canyon in the Santa Monica
Mountains seem anywhere but here.</LD>
<LD>   The canyon's proximity to Hollywood and a decades-old industry
rule that encourages its use have led to dozens of films and
television shows being made here since the first was shot "back in
the teens," says Diane Isaacs, the docent who started the monthly
"Hollywood hike" seven years ago.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a simple hike and a little hometown," Isaacs says of the
90-minute trek, which has been known to stretch to three hours if
hikers are willing. "It's an unassuming little walk with no bells and
whistles."</LD>
<TE>   Just a docent armed with a notebook of still photos and a park
with a Hollywood past that goes back almost 90 years. The easy 2-mile
hike meanders on pathways through native chaparral and mini-forests
of cedar, redwood and fir, and around a lake.</TE>
<TE>   The walk begins on a trail above the parking lot that saw World
War II duty in "Combat," which aired from 1962-67. My family of four
is part of a group of 10 listening to the docent give a detailed
sketch of the canyon's ownership, which stretches from the king of
Spain to the Doheny family and the Department of Water and Power and,
finally, the National Park Service in 1981. It includes William
Mulholland building reservoirs here to bring water to L.A. and the
willy-nilly planting of trees in the 1930s by the Dohenys and the
DWP.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin Canyon's popularity as a filming site began to grow after
the early 1950s, when the industry pushed for creation of a zone in
which location costs--which can double a film's budget--would be
exempted. The resulting zone radiates 30 miles outward from its
center at Beverly and La Cienega boulevards. Diana Hartmann of the
Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, which oversees
filming permits, says about 25 movies a year are made in Franklin
Canyon. Most shoot for two or three days and can be big (this year's
"Minority Report") or small (a lot of student films).</TE>
<TE>   While taking in what was once the "Combat" set, my husband reveals
that his brother's main motivation for studying German in high school
was so that he could bond better with war movies. The kids' eyes
roll.</TE>
<TE>   But the docent mentions enough B-movie and TV fare--about 25
productions in all--to keep my kids, ages 14 and 10, mildly engaged.
(When I called beforehand, the park ranger said the hike is
recommended for kids 10 and older; Isaacs says it's more like 12 and
up because "there are no gimmicks to keep kids interested.")</TE>
<TE>   The kids perk up when they see where "Camp Nowhere" (1992) was
filmed or hear about the water tower built to make the canyon stand
in for Oregon in "Kindergarten Cop" (1990). They also are captivated
by the shoots that went wrong: a car from the TV series "Hunter"
(1984) that crashed into, then polluted the lake; trash from "The
Great Outdoors" that was left behind, drawing small animals who died
from eating it. (Cars are no longer allowed in the lake--only
hulls--and nothing on a set is left behind or unattended.)</TE>
<TE>   Really, though, this is also a nostalgia trip for adults who can
remember watching a young Ron Howard amble down a trail with his TV
dad on "The Andy Griffith Show" (1960-68), or relished
"Thirtysomething" (1987-91) and "Twin Peaks" (1990). An appreciation
for film history also helps--the famous hitchhiking scene in "It
Happened One Night" (1934) was staged at the entrance to the canyon's
Heavenly Pond.</TE>
<TE>   "The editing intrigues people the most," Isaacs says. "They like
the idea you can cut film together so that most of the film takes
place in another part of the world. You can add a piece that's shot
here locally and no one ever knows the difference.</TE>
<TE>   "And they like the fact that they've walked where Opie walked or
stuck their thumb out where Clark Gable hitchhiked, right in their
own backyard."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The "William O. Douglas Outdoor Classroom and the Movies" hike is
the first Saturday of the month at 10 a.m. Meet at the Sooky Goldman
Nature Center, 2600 Franklin Canyon Drive, Beverly Hills. No
reservations needed. Free. (310) 858-9080.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>* The editor of the zine Giant Robot and owner of the new Giant Robot
Store in West L.A., which specializes in Asian pop culture.</LD>
<LD>   Little Tokyo West: In the Sawtelle Corridor, there are three
restaurants that we tend to go to. One is Asahi Ramen, which is a few
doors down from our store. Across the street is Sawtelle Kitchen,
which is like Continental, Japanese-style food. They make this
meatloaf, which is awesome, with something called demi-glaze sauce.
And then there's Hide Sushi, which is like two doors down and always
crowded, but it's good and cheap. And, you know those boba tea shops?
I go to Volcano Tea and Upper House, which is brand-new, so it's not
crowded. I usually get this mango, icy type of thing. I also like
watching Japanese fighting tournaments on video, which you can get at
Japanese video stores on Sawtelle. It's kind of like Ultimate
Fighting, but it's classier and less hick.</LD>
<LD>   Lightning Bolt: Sometimes, the Smell [a downtown L.A. music club]
has metal nights, where they have new indie heavy-metal acts. I saw
this band Lightning Bolt, from Rhode Island, who were out of control,
kind of like old-style Boredoms, just two guys going crazy. One guy
played drums and the other guy played guitar, and they were wearing
masks. I didn't think anyone would even know who they were, but the
place was packed.</LD>
<TE>   Pop Exhibit: I saw the "Super Flat" exhibition at MOCA about a
year ago. That was one of the most memorable art shows I've been to.
It was like Japanese contemporary art, and a lot of it was
anime-influenced. The aftermath of that is any time there's a show
with one of those artists somewhere, I go check it out.</TE>
<TE>   Korean Hot Spot: The Corner Place on James M. Wood Boulevard,
though it's not even on a corner, does Korean barbecue, but their
specialty is the cold noodles. The broth is cold and looks watery,
but it has a lot of vegetable flavor to it. It's a secret recipe.
Everybody who is Korean will probably know about this place. It's
basically famous around the whole country. It gets kind of hectic, a
lot of people and a lot of smoke. You get out and your clothes are
kind of smelly, but oh well.</TE>
<TE>   Big Fish: There's a place called Aquatic Depot near Randy's
Donuts, close to LAX, that's like going to a tide pool. You go to
aquarium stores and they are a certain size that you're used to. This
place is like 10 times that size. I think it was once a wholesaler,
but now it's open to the public. I take friends there and they're
just amazed. They have all kinds of fish and jellyfish there.</TE>

<HD>MSNBC Hires Donahue to Raise Its Prime-Time Profile,
Ratings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>MSNBC took another step in the third-place cable news network's
attempt to make its prime-time lineup more high-profile and
opinionated, confirming Wednesday the hiring of former daytime
talk-show host Phil Donahue to front a still-untitled weeknight show.</LD>
<LD>   Donahue, a liberal who supported Ralph Nader for president, will
air at 5 p.m. Pacific time as counter-programming to Fox News
Channel's top-rated Bill O'Reilly, who appeals to a large
conservative audience. Both will be up against Connie Chung on CNN.</LD>
<LD>   "I want to win. I always have, and it's even more exciting to go
against a personality who has been so successful of late," the
66-year-old Donahue said in a conference call with reporters. "Let's
ring the bell and see what happens here."</LD>
<TE>   Donahue faces a major challenge. Nielsen Media Research ratings
released this week rank "The O'Reilly Factor" as the most-watched
cable news show of first-quarter 2002, with an average 2.1 million
viewers. By contrast, MSNBC's "The News With Brian Williams," which
is moving to make way for Donahue, drew 375,000 viewers on average.
Williams' newscast will move to 4 p.m. when Donahue's show starts
sometime in the summer.</TE>
<TE>   The events of Sept. 11 inspired his return to television, Donahue
said, repeatedly emphasizing the importance he places on free speech.
The new live show will focus on news of the day, which he called
"more dramatic, complex and compelling than at any other time in my
lifetime." There will be guests and calls from viewers but no studio
audience, which he had on his pioneering issue-oriented daytime talk
show, which went off the air in 1996. Of the new show, he said, "I
hope we'll be civil, I hope we'll be different, and, please God, I
hope we won't be boring."</TE>
<TE>   Terms of the long-term deal weren't disclosed. NBC News President
Neal Shapiro called the hiring the first of "what will be many, many
steps" to build the cable network into a more competitive force. In
addition, MSNBC won an internal NBC tug-of-war for exclusive airings
of "Hardball With Chris Matthews," which it had been sharing with
CNBC, diluting ratings of both showings. The two channels will
continue to share Williams' show, although the number of nightly
airings will be reduced to three from five.</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC President Erik Sorenson said the channel plans to bring
"more interesting people" on board. Both he and Donahue also
dismissed speculation that the new show might appeal more to older
viewers than the younger audience MSNBC targets. "You think Phil
Donahue, you think hip- hop, and we're going to exploit that,"
Donahue quipped.</TE>
<TE>   Matthews' show will air at 6 p.m., pushing Ashleigh Banfield's
show to 7, followed by conservative Alan Keyes.</TE>

<HD>Together and Apart, They Defined an Era</HD>
<DH>The 1950s films of star Gloria Grahame and director
Nicholas Ray leave a lasting mark.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actress Gloria Grahame and director Nicholas Ray absolutely define
the 1950s. Their place in the Hollywood sun was brief, but their
legacy and influence have eclipsed actors and directors who were far
more popular during that decade.</LD>
<LD>   The UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive is saluting these talents with
the retrospectives "Gloria Grahame: Bad &amp; Beautiful," which kicks off
Saturday and continues through April 21, and "Nicholas Ray: In a
Lonely Place," which starts Sunday and also continues through April
21, both at the university's James Bridges Theater.</LD>
<LD>   "I have been waiting to do Gloria Grahame for a long time," says
Andrea Alsberg, head of programming for the UCLA archive. "She's an
overlooked superstar, and I think she really represented the '50s in
a real interesting way. The people who she worked with are the top
directors of the '50s. I think they saw in her something about her
looks and manner that was a bit subversive that ran true with the
time--the Cold War paranoia. She was a strong but vulnerable woman.
The woman who could be dangerous but sad and smart."</LD>
<TE>   With her distinctive pout and wispy voice, Grahame caught the
attention of critics and audiences in 1947 in Edward Dmytryk's
groundbreaking murder mystery "Crossfire," receiving a supporting
actress Oscar nomination for two brief but memorable scenes as a bar
girl with a heart of gold.</TE>
<TE>   "Crossfire" transformed Grahame from a starlet into one of the
most distinctive performers working in the film noir genre in the
late '40s and early '50s, playing everything from a murderous
adulterer in "Sudden Fear" to a gangster's moll whose face is
horribly scarred by her boyfriend in "The Big Heat."</TE>
<TE>   Yet she was an atypical "bad girl," with vulnerability beneath her
cynicism--a pathos that made her sympathetic to audiences.</TE>
<TE>   The Grahame festival features such films as Vincente Minnelli's
seminal tale of Hollywood "The Bad and the Beautiful," for which she
won best supporting actress of 1952 as a charming Southern belle
married to a screenwriter; two Fritz Lang film noir classics, "The
Big Heat" (1953) and "Human Desire" (1954); Elia Kazan's "Man on a
Tightrope" (1953), in which she plays the second wife of the owner of
a Czech circus troupe; and Ray's dark and dramatic "In a Lonely
Place" (1950), in which Grahame plays a self-possessed young woman in
a relationship with a volatile screenwriter (Humphrey Bogart). "In a
Lonely Place" also parallels Grahame's and Ray's brief, turbulent
marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the odd and interesting things about Gloria Grahame,"
offers Oscar-winning writer-director Curtis Hanson, who is also
chairman of the UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive, "is [she was] not a
huge star. [There was] not a tremendous library of titles or movies
that she was in. But in this incredibly brief period, maybe in about
five years, she worked with four masters, five if you count she
worked with Fritz Lang twice--Lang, Minnelli, Nick Ray and Kazan. A
couple of those movies for sure you would call masterpieces."</TE>
<TE>   Hanson believes Grahame's career was short-lived for the same
reason that directors liked her so much then and film aficionados
appreciate her today. "She was different," says Hanson. "She was very
attractive, attractive enough to be a movie star, but yet not too
attractive to be unreal. She was very real in these different parts.
She was very versatile, and too hard to pin down. Career longevity
comes out of being easy to identify--it is the opponent of
versatility and creativity. People were so much more hidebound by
typecasting in those days."</TE>
<TE>   Fred Zinnemann's 1955 adaptation of the Rodgers and Hammerstein
musical "Oklahoma!"--one of Grahame's few comedic turns, as Ado
Annie--was one of her last major Hollywood films.</TE>
<TE>   Alsberg feels her career waned in the latter part of the decade
because "she really represented that Eisenhower era.... What do you
do with her come the 1960s, when people are more interested in really
escapist fare?"</TE>
<TE>   Another reason she faded from the Hollywood scene was due to the
scandal that erupted in 1960 when, at 36, she married Tony Ray, the
23-year-old son of her former husband, Nicholas Ray. She subsequently
worked primarily in theater and appeared in 1979's "Head Over Heels"
and 1980's "Melvin and Howard" before her death of cancer in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Like Grahame, Ray's career was brief and remarkable. In just a few
short years he directed several films that are considered
classics--his richly textured, mesmerizing studies of the antihero
and his remarkable visual style were embraced by the young French
film critics of the Cahiers du Cinema like Jean-Luc Godard and
Francois Truffaut, who later became directors themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Nick Ray was a real kind of maverick for the 1950s studio
system," says UCLA program associate Jesse Zigelstein. "He was sort
of a very melodramatic personality, and he certainly had contempt for
the studio bosses he worked for. He sort of conceived each project as
a way to kind of wrestle his vision away from the moneymen in charge.
That kind of battled sensibility can be extremely productive if given
the right environment but, ultimately, it can really burn a lot of
bridges. I think by the late '50s he had worn out his welcome in
Hollywood. He struggled with independent projects throughout the '60s
and the '70s; he was unable to get anything together."</TE>
<TE>   Among the Ray films included in the series is 1952's exceptional
film noir "On Dangerous Ground," starring Robert Ryan as a detective
who falls in love with a blind woman (Ida Lupino); 1955's seminal
youth movie "Rebel Without a Cause," starring James Dean, Natalie
Wood and Sal Mineo as misunderstood teens; and 1954's Freudian
western "Johnny Guitar," with Joan Crawford, Mercedes McCambridge and
Sterling Hayden.</TE>
<TE>   Ray's last film was the 1963 epic "55 Days in Peking,'" which he
made in Spain. He died of cancer at age 67 in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Hanson first came under the spell of Ray's films as a youngster.
One of the reasons he's been so fascinated with Ray is because his
films present a "world that is both frightening and attractive" in
his films. "It is a world that is threatening and ugly, and yet at
the same time there is an incredible and unexpected tenderness, which
you can think of in many different scenes in his movies."</TE>
<TE>   In "Rebel Without a Cause," which Hanson describes as the
quintessential L.A. movie, "you have the kids living on the flatlands
and you've got their school, and up in the hills you have the place
they escape to. It is the place where there is emotion. Each location
is picked so carefully, so iconographic. He studied architecture with
Frank Lloyd Wright, and to what degree [that experience] entered into
his use of space, I don't know. But I do know he used space and the
wide screen better than almost any director."</TE>

<LD>   The Moliere Comedies--From "Lysistrata" to "I Love Lucy" and
beyond, the rebellion of women against self-serving male power has
fueled some of the most memorable and improbable comedies of Western
culture. It doesn't matter that the men in question consider
themselves loving husbands, fathers or guardians: The fact that they
regard women as property makes them ripe for public ridicule.</LD>
<LD>   It's the special achievement of Brian Bedford's staging of the
two-play compendium that the rights of women--including women every
bit as silly as their men--resonate so strongly in an evening
anchored persuasively in the look and style of the 1660s.</LD>
<TE>   "The School for Husbands" and "The Imaginary Cuckold" each turn on
the prevention of a forced, unhappy marriage and involve
self-infatuated characters named Sganarelle (one urban, one rural,
both played by Bedford) who become victims of their own
misconceptions.</TE>

<HD>A Strong Cast Adds Depth to Shadowy 'Lake Street Extension'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It may look like an ordinary basement bedroom, but it's really a
shadow world--a land of waking nightmares.</LD>
<LD>   Two young men find themselves sharing it in the Lee Blessing drama
"Lake Street Extension": an American, who relives molestation by his
father, and a Salvadoran, who flashes back to psychological torture
at the hands of his country's army.</LD>
<LD>   Reality gives way to allegory as their stories expand into a
larger lament about the horrors that swaggering, patriarchal
societies sometimes inflict on their youth.</LD>
<TE>   This is daring, visceral material, but it's also muddled and
off-putting.</TE>
<TE>   Even when performed with commitment--as it is in a Theatre
District production at the Cast Theatre in Hollywood--it never quite
coalesces.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder, then, that this 1992 script exists in near obscurity
among such Blessing plays as "A Walk in the Woods" and
"Eleemosynary."</TE>
<TE>   "Lake Street" is set in an unnamed city in the northern United
States, near the Mississippi River. Events unfold mostly in
flashbacks to 1982, when the 20-ish Trace (Christian Holiday) makes
an unannounced visit home--only to find a young Salvadoran refugee
occupying his boyhood bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Trace's troubled, divorced father, Fuller (David Rousseve), is
trying to reform himself through religion, and he's housing Gregorio
(Julian Andrei) on behalf of his church. Trace's visit shatters
Fuller's good Samaritan fantasy and revives a painful past.</TE>
<TE>   Those long-ago horrors come racing back when a moment of
playfulness--Fuller rendering Trace helpless while tickling him--goes
on several seconds too long and becomes something else. Gregorio
witnesses the incident with dawning awareness and, soon, his past
bubbles to the surface too.</TE>
<TE>   Scary little squalls build out of nowhere in Mario Lescot's
carefully modulated staging, and Holiday gives a haunting performance
as Trace--still very much a boy, in many ways, yet used up and tossed
aside.</TE>
<TE>   Too bad their fine work can't clarify this script.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Lake Street Extension," Theatre District at the Cast, 804 N. El
Centro Ave., Hollywood. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m.

<LD>   Some Good News and Bad News for Liza</LD>
<LD>   Liza Minnelli won mostly cheers from London critics on her return
to the concert stage at London's Royal Albert Hall on
Tuesday--despite grumblings that not all of her clearly exhausting
program was sung live.</LD>
<TE>   Referring to "mutterings that Liza's performance was mimed," Pete
Clark in the Evening Standard went on to praise the 56-year-old Oscar
winner for offering "a salutary reminder that nobody in the world
sings with such intensity."</TE>
<TE>   Taped support during strenuous dance numbers isn't unusual,
concert publicist Phil Symes said, adding that the singer planned to
sing her entire set live the next night "to show that she can."</TE>
<TE>   To the adoring crowd of 3,800, the matter of lip-syncing was less
significant than the fact that Minnelli was there at all. There had
been speculation she'd cancel the concert due to vocal strain, and
the singer has been battling hip and knee problems.</TE>
<TE>   On a different note, Minnelli's 94-year-old stepmother sued her
for elder abuse, breach of contract and neglect on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Filed in L.A. Superior Court, the suit claims that Lee Anderson
Minnelli was guaranteed housing in the will of her late husband,
Vincente Minnelli. His daughter Liza, she said, sold the Beverly
Hills mansion and instructed she be removed.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for the singer could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<TE>   Grammys Head East After Four Years in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers of the Grammy Awards made it official Wednesday: After
four years as an exclusively Los Angeles event, the music industry
gala will return east next February to Madison Square Garden. Usually
held midweek, the 45th annual Grammys will be held on a Sunday, Feb.
23, and broadcast by CBS. The decision is a nod to the Grammy
leadership's publicly stated desire to shuttle the show back and
forth between the industry's two metropolitan hubs.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Greene, president and CEO of the National Academy of
Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, said at a Wednesday press conference that
the money and spotlight associated with the global broadcast are also
going back to Gotham "when the city has needed us most"--a reference
to recovery efforts from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Greene said that, in October, there were hasty efforts to relocate
the most recent Grammy show to New York, but that logistical issues

<TE>   New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg attended the Grammy news
conference Wednesday and was presented a guitar with a painted Sept.
11 tribute, the handiwork of a retired city firefighter. Bloomberg's
presence, it seems, was more than ceremonial. Industry buzz has it
that his election opened the door to the New York move, since former
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Greene had an ongoing public feud.</TE>

<LD>New this week: Written by Neal Marshall Stevens and Richard D'Ovidio
from a story by Robb White and directed by Steve Beck for maximum
tension, "Thirteen Ghosts" is in essence a classic haunted house
story, given some terrifically ingenious and grisly twists. The story
centers on a decent family man, already afflicted with tragedy and
loss, who finds within himself the courage and selflessness to save
his family from evil. "Thirteen Ghosts" begins in a Chicago auto
junkyard in the dead of night, where F. Murray Abraham's sinister
Cyrus Kriticos and his zany yet distraught young psychic, Rafkin
(Matthew Lillard), are doing a little spirit-chasing. Meanwhile,
elegant Kalina (Embeth Davidtz) apparently means to free any spirits
they manage to trap. If this sounds a bit vague, it is, but not to
worry, for it is meant to be a suitably bravura prologue to all the
thrills and chills to come in this sleek, gory remake of the 1960
William Castle original. Although not for the faint of heart, it's a
potent--and very tricky--treat. With Tony Shalhoub, Shannon Elizabeth
and Alec Roberts.</LD>

<DH>Once overwhelmed by a certain bandmate, Caitlin Cary stands
in her own spotlight now.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It wouldn't be surprising if singer-songwriter Caitlin Cary were to
say she's sick of talking about Ryan Adams. Her former partner in the
acclaimed alt-country band Whiskeytown has garnered so much attention
and praise as a solo artist that discussions of Cary's own debut
album, "While You Weren't Looking," have inevitably been tangled up
with him.</LD>
<LD>   But the North Carolina resident shrugs off the potential
irritation.</LD>
<LD>   "My plan was in the next interview to say, 'I don't mind talking
about Ryan, as long as the next time you talk to him, you ask him
about me,'" Cary says, laughing mischievously.</LD>
<TE>   That good-natured self-deprecation was a trademark of the fiddle
player's persona throughout the often-chaotic life of Whiskeytown.
Formed in 1994, the band broke up in 2000 despite widespread acclaim
and a major-label deal, after numerous personnel changes and
bureaucratic hassles torpedoed its momentum.</TE>
<TE>   She may still have her waitress gig in Raleigh, and another day
job, too. But nowadays Cary, 33, is herself garnering attention from
some prestigious quarters, including winning the cover of this
month's No Depression, the alt-country magazine of record.</TE>
<TE>   Cary may have stood in Adams' shadow in Whiskeytown, but the
group's sound was defined by the pair's striking vocal harmonies. Yet
the more grounded Cary often found herself at odds with Adams' wilder
attitudes about performing and songwriting, not to mention his
unpredictable behavior in and out of the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Cary's own music is more sedate than Whiskeytown's
freewheeling country-rock or Adams' classic-rock-flavored 2001
collection, "Gold." Most of the songs on the recently released "While
You Weren't Looking" are folk-pop tales, often about people who
aren't paying attention to a situation or a relationship that needs
to be addressed.</TE>
<TE>   Not that it's all willowy and wan, however.</TE>
<TE>   "I've surprised myself and accidentally written a couple rock
songs," says Cary, who performed Tom Petty's "Refugee" years ago
during her first post-college solo singing turn and remains inspired
by his work.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Petty's influence is strong on the gently rollicking
"Please Don't Hurry Your Heart," one of two tracks co-written with
Adams and former Whiskeytown guitarist Mike Daly. (Cary and Adams
also duet on their composition "The Battle," which appears on a
four-song mini-disc included with the album's first 8,000 copies.)</TE>
<TE>   As the album's title slyly acknowledges, Whiskeytown was still
together when Cary began writing her own songs, often with Daly,
whose name appears on eight of the album's 11 compositions. Also
playing on the collection are former Whiskeytown bassist Mike Santoro
and drummer Eric "Skillet" Gilmore, who is Cary's husband, and a
cornucopia of North Carolina musicians.</TE>
<TE>   Although all helped boost her confidence, Cary reserves the
highest praise for the record's producer, former dB's member Chris
Stamey, who also produced her 2000 EP, "Waltzie."</TE>
<TE>   When she called to ask him about working together, she says, "I
had five or six songs done, a bunch of other ideas, and a strong will
to try. And I kind of had to be coddled through the whole thing."
Stamey shepherded her paradigm shift from backup to leader in ways
she can't begin to count.</TE>
<TE>   "Where I am now and where I was [before] are so radically
different," she says of her songwriting. "He was very patient at
dealing with someone like me," especially because she was only just
learning to play guitar and often had to describe her musical ideas
more in words than sounds.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that perceived kindness was just Cary's own patience with
Adams coming back to her. Even now, her experiences as a solo artist
have made her more understanding of him. She enjoys the attention but
feels burdened by having to make all the decisions. "It makes me look
back on Ryan's role and have a lot more sympathy than I did than when
he was [complaining] about having to do interviews or whatever."</TE>
<TE>   You have to marvel at her seemingly forgiving nature and wonder if
she never wanted to kick Adams' posterior but good. She laughs. "I
kicked [it] a few times. And I'm not the most forgiving person."</TE>
<TE>   OK, so why did she put up with him? "It was such a great
non-romantic romance in the beginning," she says. "We'd drive around
the North Carolina countryside drinking Night Train [wine] and
writing songs." That phase didn't last long, she admits, but the
connection remained powerful.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never had the experience, before or since, of being able to
follow somebody when they just wrote a song," she says. "Which he did
all the time. [He'd say], 'I wrote this song at sound check, and
let's play it tonight.' And I could sing it with him. It was always
worth putting up with a lot because that magic happened sometimes.
Even when things were crazy, it was worth holding on to. Although I
certainly felt crazy for sticking with it sometimes."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Gives Up Red; David Takes It Over: After seven years of
operating Red restaurant on Beverly Boulevard in L.A., David Reiss
decided it was time to give the place up. "It needed a face-lift, and
I wasn't into doing it," he says. Instead, he found someone who
would: David Rosoff. Most recently the general manager of Michael's,
Rosoff had wanted to open his own restaurant for the last year. (He
took part in initial talks to open Jar with Mark Peel and Suzanne
Tracht.) Along with partner Jonathon Horne and minority partner
Kristin Gulcher, fresh from her position as dining-room manager at
Patina, he will remodel the Red space and rename it Opaline. The name
was Oscar Wilde's pet name for absinthe, but no mind-altering
substances but alcohol will be served there. Really, it better
describes the color palette of the dining space, which runs from
yellow to green, than anything else. "I wanted a name that didn't
mean anything," Rosoff tells us. Chef David Lentz, from the Delano
Hotel in Miami Beach and China Grill in Las Vegas, will help execute
the casual-dining concept. He'll use flavors from the Mediterranean,
North Africa and the East Coast. The food is meant to be eclectic
without being precious, sort of European comfort food with American
touches. Look for Opaline to open around July.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Dude, Where's My Meatloaf?: David Slatkin left his roost at Fenix
in the Argyle Hotel to take over the kitchen at Morton's in West
Hollywood. "The Argyle had never taken off," Slatkin explains. The
management at the hotel also wanted to create more of a nightclub
scene with their restaurant space, which Slatkin wasn't interested in
promoting. But Morton's, long known as a power dining spot, hasn't
been what one might call innovative with its menu. Owner Pam Morton
has focused on comfort food in the casual setting. She hired Slatkin
to bring the menu into the 21st century with such dishes as grilled
Chilean sea bass with fava bean, fennel and white corn fricassee
($28). Morton's, 8764 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood; (310) 276-5205.</TE>

<TE>   Thai Food Gets Franchised: Randy Schoch, a restaurateur who owns
three Ruth's Chris Steak Houses in Hawaii and three Roy's restaurants
(two in Arizona and the one in Newport Beach), is making Thai food
more accessible. His new restaurant concept, called Thaifoon, opens
in the Irvine Spectrum on Friday. The first Thaifoon is already
operating in Scottsdale, Ariz., but Schoch says the new spot takes
his idea "to the next level." It presents slightly Americanized Thai
food in a large, pretty setting, complete with a 30-foot water wall
and glass sake locker. Cocktails, wines by the glass and specialty
sakes will be served, and live music will be offered on weekends.
Together, the dining room, patio and bar area can seat 285.
Traditional Thai curries ($10.50-$12.95) have been toned down,
chile-wise, but you can ask for them to be spiced up. Some fusion
dishes, such as lemongrass-crusted halibut ($12.50), are also on the
menu. Appetizers run from beef satay ($6.95) to shrimp and pork
dumplings ($7.95) to crispy calamari($8.50). Thaifoon is open for
lunch and dinner daily. Thaifoon, Irvine Spectrum, 85 Fortune Drive,
Irvine; (949) 585-0022.</TE>

<TE>   Extravagant Entree: On Monday nights, the Grill on the Alley is
serving farm-raised abalone to those willing to part with $55 for a
taste of this now-rare shellfish. It's fried in lemon-butter sauce
and served with wild rice risotto and shiitake mushrooms. The Grill
on the Alley, 9560 Dayton Way, Beverly Hills; (310) 276-0615.</TE>

<TE>   Paperless Survey: The Zagat guides, for which diners choose and
rate the restaurants, won't be conducted on paper this year. Instead,
those who want to fill out a survey for Southern California must
visit www.zagat.com. If you complete a survey by May 5, you'll
receive a free copy of the 2003 Zagat Survey, to be published in
October.</TE>

<LD>The annual City of Lights, City of Angels series of French films
opens Tuesday at the Directors Guild, with Bertrand Tavernier's
superb "Laissez-Passer" ("Safe Passage") screening in Theater 2 at
7:30 p.m. An exciting hommage to those French filmmakers who during
the Occupation managed to maintain their integrity and
professionalism under the most repressive circumstances, the film is
also loaded with suspense, for its central figure, an assistant
director named Jean Devaivre (Jacques Gamblin) displays the same
unflappability on the set as in his activities in the Resistance.
Tavernier drew his consistently engaging picture from the
reminiscences of both Devaivre and Jean Aurenche, whose career was
revived when Tavernier hired the veteran screenwriter on his earliest
films.</LD>
<TE>   Since Tavernier has always been as passionate a film historian as
he is a filmmaker, "Laissez-Passer" (2002) has an acutely authentic
sense of time and place. Devaivre was a champion cyclist, which comes
in handy more than once, and has an athlete's resilience, which is
put to the test when he finds he has no recourse but to accept a job
at the German-run Continental Films, whose heavy-handed chiefs place
the French filmmakers on rigid budgets and shooting schedules and
hold the threat over their heads of packing them off to Babelsburg,
the site of the famed UFA Studios. His first assignment is to assist
the important pioneer director Maurice Tourneur (Philippe
Morier-Genoud), who after a long and significant sojourn in America,
had returned to France--with his American wife.</TE>
<TE>   There's a pleasing contrast between the sober Devaivre and the
rumpled, fun-loving, woman-chasing Aurenche (Denis Podalydes), who is
forever moving from place to place, his worldly possessions packed
into two battered suitcases. But he is as resolved as Devaivre that
he will contribute nothing to German propaganda. As we meet a raft of
characters, "Laissez-Passer" builds tension as Devaivre discovers
documents that will save lives but place his own at an unexpectedly
high risk. This wonderful film brims with the humanity, seriousness,
good humor and commitment that mark all Tavernier's work. DGA, 7920

<TE>   The FilmKitchen distribution company is opening one-week runs
Friday of Olli Saarelan's "Ambush" and Jack Rubio's "Hard Luck" at
the Fairfax Cinemas at Beverly Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   The first is a classic war picture from Finland with a love story
in the foreground that had a tremendous effect on home ground. Eero
(Peter Franzen) and Kaarina (Irina Bjorklund) are beginning to fall
in love just as World War II overtakes them and sends both into
battle, he as a brave lieutenant and she as an army nurse. The love
scenes are tender and erotic, the battle scenes flawlessly staged,
and "Ambush" emerges as affecting and wholly accessible, but it is as
conventional as it is well-crafted. It hasn't the scope and power of
Pekka Parikka's "Winter War" ("Talvisota") more than a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Hard Luck" is the third of actor-writer Kirk Harris' impressively
implacable odysseys of driven, defeated men. Under Jack Rubio's
direction, Harris plays Trevor, a young man who impulsively escapes
from a mental institution three months before his scheduled release
after nearly seven years. He is determined to effect a reunion with
his dying best friend (Matthew Faber) and former wife (Renee
Humphrey) on an Oregon island retreat where, as children, they
enjoyed their happiest times. It's worth overlooking mind-boggling
plot developments and occasional narrative murkiness for experiencing
Trevor's single-minded determination to fulfill a loving gesture.

<TE>   The Los Angeles County Museum of Art's comprehensive series Out of
India: The Films of Satyajit Ray continues Friday at 7:30 p.m. in the
Bing Theater with the second and final films in the director's famous
Apu Trilogy, "Aparajito" (1956) and "The World of Apu" (1959).
Screening Saturday at 7:30 p.m. is the little-seen "The Golden
Fortress" (1974), one of Ray's few comedies.</TE>
<TE>   As a clock strikes 3 a.m., a Calcutta couple are astonished to
discover their 6-year-old son (Kushai Chakravarty) intently drawing a
picture of a golden fortress. He insists that he has lived within
this fortress, apparently in a previous life, and that in his home
there is a hidden treasure of jewels. As the fortress becomes an
obsession with the child, his story eventually is reported in a
newspaper, thus setting in motion the film's complicated adventures.</TE>
<TE>   "The Golden Fortress" gradually evolves into an elaborate pursuit
film. As a result, we get to see a great deal of the rugged and
picturesque Rajasthan region, photographed in color with graceful
simplicity by Sounmendu Roy. At two hours and 20 minutes, the film is
long by Western standards for so slender a tale, but its whimsical
charm and gentle fun eventually cast their spell. Playing with "The
Golden Fortress" is another of Ray's lighter films, "The Elephant
Man" (1978). 5905 Wilshire Blvd. (323) 857-6010.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Laemmle Theaters' current "Documentary Days" series continues
Saturday and Sunday at 10 a.m. at the Sunset 5 with the delightful
and surprising "Cool and Crazy," observes a hearty men's chorus that
thrives on the edge of the world within shooting distance of the
Arctic Circle.</TE>
<TE>   The setting is the small Norwegian fishing village of Berlevag,
which Isak Dinesen chose as the locale for her novella "Babette's
Feast," the movie version of which won the 1987 Oscar for best
foreign film. Thirty years ago, Berlevag boasted five fish-processing
plants; now it is down to one. For all its severity in wintertime, it
is a charming community in a beautiful, natural locale that is
cherished by its predominantly male inhabitants despite its dwindling
economy.</TE>
<TE>   About 30 robust men, aged 29 to 96, cheer themselves up and pass
their time performing as the Berlevag Male Choir, singing a mix of
vintage ballads, hymns and marches. When they raise their voices in
song, the Viking spirit lives. Director Knut Erik Jensen acquaints us
with an amiable cross-section of the choir, which he shoots in
performance in the frosty outdoors on several occasions. We get
deeper insights into the men as they ride in a bus on their way to
perform in Murmansk, Russia, where they are received with wild
acclaim. Their appalled reaction to the vast areas of open fields
turned into industrial wastelands, however, triggers considerable
political debate. By the time "Cool and Crazy" is over, it proves
unexpectedly touching. Sunset 5, 8000 Sunset Blvd. (323) 848-3500.
"Cool and Crazy" also screens at April 13-14 at 11 a.m. at the Monica
4-Plex 1332 2nd St., Santa Monica, (310) 394-9741; April 20-21 at the
Playhouse 7, 673 Colorado Blvd., Pasadena, (626) 844-6500; and May
4-5 at the Lido, 3459 Via Lido, Newport Beach, (949) 673-8351.</TE>

<TE>   Douglas Fairbanks Sr., the great swashbuckler of the silent
screen, made only four talkies before his death from a heart attack
in his 56th year, in 1939. He and his wife, Mary Pickford, teamed
only on a poorly received 1929 talkie version of "Taming of the
Shrew," and two years later Fairbanks followed it up with "Reaching
for the Moon," a minor but enjoyable romantic comedy set aboard an
ocean liner. Bebe Daniels is his lovely leading lady, and the film
features Bing Crosby, music by Irving Berlin and eye-popping Art Deco
sets. It screens at the Silent Movie Friday and Sunday at 8 p.m.,
with Sunday matinees at 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. 611 N. Fairfax Ave. (323)
655-2520.</TE>

<TE>   Milos Forman's 1984 "Amadeus," based on the Peter Shaffer play,
returns in a new director's cut in limited runs at the Arc Light at
the Cinerama Dome Center, Sunset Boulevard and Ivar Avenue, (323)
464-4226, and at the Monica 4-Plex, (310) 394-9741. This version of
the tale about the composer Antonio Salieri's lethal jealousy of the
prodigious young Mozart is 20 minutes longer than its 122-minute
theatrical release and is presented with digitally restored and
remastered images and sounds.</TE>

<TE>   The 18th annual Israel Film Festival opens Wednesday with a

20-25 at the Town Center 5, 17200 Ventura Blvd. (877) 966-5566.</TE>

<DH>Television* Long-unseen material fills the museum series
'The Sound of His Music: A Tribute to Richard Rodgers' in Beverly
Hills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1981, his first year with the company, Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein
Organization President Ted Chapin found several programs gathering
dust in a closet.</LD>
<LD>   "There were all of these reels of film in closets all over the
place," Chapin said. "I actually rented a 16-millimeter projector and
set it up in the conference room and looked at all of the films."</LD>
<LD>   Most of the reels weren't very interesting to Chapin. But some
caught his eye, among them the 1954 special "General Foods:
Presenting Rodgers and Hammerstein." As far as Chapin knows, that
special is the only filmed performance of "South Pacific" stars Mary
Martin and Ezio Pinza. It also contains the only footage of John
Raitt and Jan Clayton, who were in the original "Carousel,"
performing together, as well as scenes from "Allegro" and "Me and
Juliet." "There's a very young Florence Henderson and a very young
Yul Brynner," Chapin said.</LD>
<TE>   Groucho Marx even shows up on the telecast to do a version of "You
Bet Your Life" with Richard Rodgers and his partner, Oscar
Hammerstein II.</TE>
<TE>   "I assume people sent these things to Rodgers, and he wrote lovely
thank-you notes and said [to his staff], 'Put them somewhere' and
didn't really look at them," Chapin said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, all that long-lost material is being featured in "The Sound
of His Music: A Tribute to Richard Rodgers," beginning Friday at the
Museum of Television &amp; Radio.</TE>
<TE>   Continuing through June 3, the series is part of the worldwide
centennial tribute to Rodgers, who is one of the most recognizable
denizens of American musical theater. With his first partner, Lorenz
Hart, Rodgers wrote such Broadway shows as "On Your Toes," "The Boys
From Syracuse" and "Pal Joey." With Hammerstein, he penned the music
to "Oklahoma!," "Carousel," "South Pacific," "The King and I,"
"Flower Drum Song" and "The Sound of Music." His hundreds of
standards include "Isn't It Romantic," "If I Loved You," "Some
Enchanted Evening" and "My Favorite Things."</TE>
<TE>   Rodgers, who died in 1979, would have turned 100 on June 28. The
composer was a prominent figure on television in the '50s and '60s.</TE>
<TE>   "He was fascinated by television as anybody would have been in the
theater in those days as a promotional thing--to appear on 'Ed
Sullivan' and appear when asked" on other shows, Chapin said. On
television, "so many major events were based around Rodgers or
Rodgers and Hammerstein."</TE>
<TE>   "My father was busier than I thought, or the networks were busier
than I thought," added his daughter, Mary Rodgers, a writer and
composer in her own right. "He realized that television got to a lot
of people. I think he was not so comfortable acting on television.
There is a clip of him and Oscar being interviewed by Groucho Marx,
and he's obviously very uncomfortable."</TE>
<TE>   The festival kicks off with the 1957 live telecast of
"Cinderella," starring Julie Andrews. It was the only musical that
Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote for the small screen, and it has been
remade twice for television.</TE>
<TE>   "There was something so exciting about the fact that it was live,"
Mary Rodgers said. "There weren't any TelePrompTers, and if you made
a mistake, you made a mistake and everybody got to see it. There is
something really human about that."</TE>
<TE>   Another find is a 1963 installment of "The Tonight Show." Johnny
Carson had just taken over the reins of the show from Jack Paar five
months earlier, and he seemed nervous and in awe of his famed guest.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't think of 'The Tonight Show' devoting an entire show to
one person," museum curator Ron Simon said. But at the time, devoting
90 minutes to Rodgers gave the late-night series a certain cachet.</TE>
<TE>   "In many ways, television and Richard Rodgers worked very well
together," Simon said. "Rodgers had a cultural legitimacy that he
brought to television. But it was his type of appeal--both
sophisticated and also for a mass audience--that television was
trying to achieve. So there was something that connected very well
with television's mission."</TE>
<TE>   Simon said that the museum engaged in detective work looking for
programs to feature in the tribute. A recent discovery is the 1951
live special "An Evening for Richard Rodgers," which features host
John Daly and such performers as Celeste Holm, Vera Zorina and Alfred
Drake. If a little clunky, the special is quaint and utterly
charming. At the conclusion, Rodgers accompanies Mary Martin on the
piano in "I'm in Love With a Wonderful Guy."</TE>
<TE>   Other rarities include a 1958 episode of "The Perry Como Show"
that finds Rodgers accompanying Como through a medley of tunes, and a
special edition of "The Ed Sullivan Show" telecast in 1962 from
Carnegie Hall. Gordon MacRae, Steve Lawrence, Roberta Peters and
Peter Nero are among the performers in this concert.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the search continues.</TE>
<TE>   "There is one program we are still looking for," Simon said. "That
is the very first Ed Sullivan show [from 1948], when it was 'The
Toast of the Town.' Rodgers and Hammerstein were the guests.... We
are getting very close to it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Sound of His Music: A Tribute to Richard Rodgers" screens
Wednesdays through Sundays at 12:30 p.m., beginning Friday through
June 30 at the Museum of Television &amp; Radio, 465 N. Beverly Drive,
Beverly Hills. Admission is free. Call (310) 786-1000 or visit

<HD>The Tales of 'Rashomon'</HD>
<DH>Akira Kurosawa's film, with its brilliant storytelling and
cinematography, shines in a polished release on DVD.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Akira Kurosawa's powerful 1950 drama "Rashomon" was given an honorary
Oscar for outstanding foreign language film, won the Golden Lion at
the Venice Film Festival and was voted by the Village Voice Film
Critics' Poll as one of the 10 best films of the 20th century. Even
the title has become synonymous for a story that is told from
different points of view.</LD>
<LD>   The Criterion Collection has treated "Rashomon" with the respect
it deserves in a lovely new digital edition ($40) that features a
stunning high-definition transfer with restored image and sound.</LD>
<LD>   Frequent Kurosawa collaborator Toshiro Mifune gives one of his
many electrifying performances, playing a bandit who rapes a woman
and kills her samurai husband in the densely layered forest one
afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   Or did he? Kurosawa plays with audiences' expectations of reality
and truth in "Rashomon" as four different people, through flashbacks,
offer their versions of what happened that fateful day in the forest.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Kurosawa's brilliant storytelling, "Rashomon" also
features the incredible black-and-white cinematography of Kazuo
Miyagawa, whose remarkable use of light and shadows helps bring this
compelling tale to life.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD includes a video introduction by Robert Altman, who talks
about the influence of the film on his craft; excerpts from the 1990
Japanese documentary "The World of Kazuo Miyagawa" and commentary
from Donald Richie, an authority on Japanese film who discusses
Kurosawa's exploration of relative reality and using the triangle as
a framing device for his characters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The 1995 mystery thriller "The Usual Suspects" arrives this week
on DVD in a special edition from MGM ($25). Christopher McQuarrie won
an Oscar for his clever screenplay, which keeps audiences asking the
identity of the villain, Keyser Soze. Kevin Spacey also picked up his
first Academy Award for his supporting performance as a small-time
hood with cerebral palsy who knows more about the evil kingpin Soze
than he is letting on. Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Stephen Baldwin,
Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite and Benicio Del Toro also star.
Bryan Singer directed.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition features both the wide- and full-screen
version of the indie hit; a not-so-entertaining gag reel that had
been originally done by Singer to amuse the cast just in case they
didn't like the final film; home video shot by Pollak's wife, Linda,
at the Cannes Film Festival; and numerous featurettes on the
conception, casting and production. Included are interviews with the
cast, Singer, McQuarrie and editor-composer John Ottman. The latter
offers commentary on several deleted scenes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kino's fascinating new "Vamps, Vixens and Virgins" DVD collection
($30 each) features five silent films that challenged the limits of
screen sexuality during the early days of cinema.</TE>
<TE>   "A Fool There Was," from 1915, stars Theda Bara, who was
considered cinema's first sex symbol and introduced the term "vamp."
She plays a "vampire," a seductive woman who uses her charms to
seduce, ruin and abandon a series of influential men. The DVD also
features a scrapbook of photographs and the text of Rudyard Kipling's
"The Vampire."</TE>
<TE>   Two of Cecil B. DeMille's early films, 1915's "The Cheat" and
1922's "Manslaughter," are presented as a double feature on one disc.</TE>
<TE>   Fannie Ward and Sessue Hayakawa star in "The Cheat," a florid tale
of a wealthy Burmese trader who exacts a high price from a society
woman when he settles a debt for her. "Manslaughter," which features
an evocative new jazzy score by the Alloy Orchestra, stars Leatrice
Joy as a spoiled debutante who is forced to change her ways after she
causes the death of a traffic cop.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the collection is a Clara Bow double bill: 1925's
"Parisian Love" and 1922's "Down to the Sea in Ships."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, Anchor Bay's new "The Three Stooges--Greatest Hits
&amp; Rarities" ($14) sounds like it will be a nyuk-nyuk-out for any
Stooge fan because it features classic shorts starring the
knuckleheads, TV commercials and other rarities. But the disc is a
major disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   The visual quality of the four shorts--"Malice in the Palace,"
"Sing a Song of Six Pants," "Disorder in the Court" and "Brideless
Groom"--is muddy and dark. A 1950 "Camel Comedy Caravan" starring Ed
Wynn features Moe, Larry and Shemp hamming it up as Wynn's guests
stars, but it isn't very funny. And neither is "Knife of the Party,"
a 1934 musical short starring Shemp and Three Stooge wannabes.</TE>
<TE>   Curly makes his first appearance as a Stooge in a 1933 short,
"Hollywood on Parade," which also features Jimmy Durante and Ben
Turpin.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Also new from Anchor Bay this week on DVD is the cult 1980 Disney
thriller, "Watcher in the Woods" ($20). Carroll Baker and David
McCallum play an American couple who move into a big British country
house with their two daughters (Lynn-Holly Johnson and Kyle
Richards). The house is owned by the mysterious Mrs. Alywood (Bette
Davis), who lives in the smaller house on the property and is still
mourning the disappearance of her daughter 30 years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Both girls soon find unexplainable things happening: mirrors
without reflections, circles of light, sudden lightning strikes,
voices and visions of Davis' daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The film is entertaining and oozes atmosphere, but the scariest
thing about it is Johnson's over-the-top, tremulous acting style.</TE>
<TE>   The special-edition DVD features the film's original deleted
ending and an alternate ending. Both include commentary by director
John Hough.</TE>
<TE>   There are also trailers, a TV spot and commentary from the
British-born Hough, who is best known for directing the horror hit
"The Legend of Hell House."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Though MGM describes its DVD of the Bruce Willis-Billy Bob
Thornton-Cate Blanchett caper comedy "Bandits" as a special edition
($27), the disc doesn't include any commentary from director Barry
Levinson. But what it does feature is a decent behind-the-scenes
featurette, an alternate ending with commentary from Blanchett,
deleted scenes introduced by Levinson, and "Inside Scene 71," a
compelling look at how the scene in which Willis and Blanchett share
a bed that's divided by a blanket evolved from script to screen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Get out your hankies for "Life as a House" (New Line, $25),  about
a dying man who brings his estranged family together. It's made
palatable by the strong performances of Kevin Kline and Hayden
Christensen (who will soon be seen as Anakin Skywalker in "Star Wars
II").</TE>
<TE>   The passable digital edition features a lengthy documentary on the
making of the film, four deleted scenes with optional commentary from
director Irwin Winkler, another documentary on the design and
construction of the house used in the film, the trailer and
serviceable commentary from Winkler, co-producer Rob Cowen and writer
Mark Andrus.</TE>

<DH>'Bill's New Frock' takes a playful but thoughtful look at
gender roles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What if you were a 10-year-old boy who woke up one morning to find
that everyone, Mom and Dad included, thought that you were a girl,
and always had been?</LD>
<LD>   And what if your mom sent you to school in the pinkest, frilliest,
laciest dress you've ever seen--and everyone at school thought you
were a girl, too?</LD>
<LD>   Gender stereotypes are given a delicious trouncing in "Bill's New
Frock," presented by the Mark Taper Forum's professional theater for
young audiences, P.L.A.Y. (Performing for Los Angeles Youth), in
schools and at several public venues in April and May.</LD>
<TE>   Adapted by Scottish theater company Visible Fictions from a novel
by Anne Fine, this hourlong comic piece was further adapted for
American audiences by Visible Fictions founding member and
co-artistic director Douglas Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   It's message theater, but there's no soap box in sight in this
zany satire. Physical humor and a genuinely witty script reign
supreme as Bill (Ron Garcia) experiences subtle and not-so-subtle
differences in the way he's now treated by parents, peers and
teachers (played by Julanne Chidi Hill, Paula Killen and Sun St.
Pierre).</TE>
<TE>   As a girl, especially one in a frilly frock, Bill isn't expected
to want to play football, help move furniture, fight with boys, make
noise or get dirty. His trials include unwelcome overtures from a
smitten neighborhood bully (comical Hill), a teacher who expects
neater work from girls than boys, boys who hog the playground with
their game of football, and getting stuck with the Barbie comic book
(which, to Bill's surprise, turns out to have some pretty good
stories in it).</TE>
<TE>   Bill is also expected to play Rapunzel in a class play,
occasioning a wild fantasy sequence in which Bill, impatient with
Rapunzel's apparent lack of spirit, rewrites the story, imagining
Rapunzel rescuing herself in a "Mission: Impossible"-James
Bond-cowboy-swashbuckler adventure.</TE>
<TE>   The production, seen at a stop at the 24th Street Theatre as part
of the theater's Saturday Explorer family series, couldn't ask for a
better Bill than Garcia. A gifted physical actor, he is hilarious
throughout, and convincing, too, as Bill sees the world through new
eyes and bewilderment gives way to understanding.</TE>
<TE>   This stand-out family theater experience, however, is also due to
Irvine's imaginative, assured direction and ensemble members Hill,
Killen and St. Pierre.</TE>
<TE>   These talented actors not only bring alive all of the other
characters in the play, but with the action taking place on Rachel
Hauck's minimal set--three chairs serving multiple purposes--they
perform as sets, props, sound effects and narrators, too. Jose
Lopez's impressive lighting design contributes another layer of depth
and costume designer Joyce Kim Lee adds another helping of visual
humor with Bill's wonderfully over-the-top, girly frock.</TE>

<HD>A Pleasant Reminder From Central Vietnam</HD>
<DH>Review* The aroma and tang at Fountain Valley's Da Lat
Bistro brings one gourmet back to a tasty first encounter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN BOOE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I first had Vietnamese food about 20 years ago. I've long since
forgotten the name of the restaurant and most of the specifics of the
meal, but certain flavor memories remain. Something aromatic rose
like a cloud from my palate to my sinuses. Something creamy but
subtly pungent made my tongue tingle. The food was soft when I bit
into it but loaded with textural surprises, a sort of edible
exploding cigar.</LD>
<LD>   This exotic vocabulary of flavors was, at the time, completely
unfamiliar to me, but I've been hoping to re-create that meal ever
since. And now I finally have, at Da Lat Bistro in Fountain Valley.</LD>
<LD>   I've got nothing against pho, which can be found in abundance
throughout Southern California, but Da Lat (though it does serve pho)
specializes in the cuisine of central Vietnam, where whispers of
Indian, Chinese, Thai and French cooking find their way onto the
plate. In some ways, though, the food is more subtle than any of its
influences.</LD>
<TE>   With its walls covered with bamboo matting and its bar hooded in
thatch, Da Lat is spacious and laid-back, evoking a vague tropical
feeling, something between Maui and Malaysia. It serves no tropical
drinks, just beer and wine, but if you want something cool and
refreshing, try the nonalcoholic drink made from "pennyworth" herb.
The prices are quite reasonable and the quality of the food is
impressively consistent.</TE>
<TE>   There are a number of intriguing appetizers, and it's easy to
stuff yourself on them if you don't watch out. One of my favorites is
the shrimp salad. A hollowed-out, frozen pineapple half is filled
with cold grilled shrimp, white fish and marinated calamari
interspersed with wisps of red cabbage, carrots and lotus root
shoots, generously garnished with chopped, golden-fried shallots.</TE>
<TE>   The beef salad is a sort of beef tartare, though it helps if
you've acquired a taste for the pungent Vietnamese fish sauce nuoc
mam because the ground beef is marinated in it before being mixed
with onions and strips of red and green bell peppers.</TE>
<TE>   Among other appetizers, the crispy chicken wings arrive a little
on the soggy side, but they're quite flavorful, and the spring rolls,
filled with savory pork and shrimp scented with basil, are wonderful.
Fish cakes are small, densely packed fingers of ground fish,
deep-fried and pleasingly chewy.</TE>
<TE>   If you're up for a feast, order the bo 7 mon, the well-known
seven-course beef extravaganza. It starts with the beef salad and
follows with a medley of bovine delights. Beef in vinegar, for
example, is fondue, Indochina style: Thin slices of raw beef are
cooked in a boiling caldron of vinegar, then wrapped in some of the
aromatic herbs (mint, basil, perilla, polygonum) that accompany many
of the dishes. There are also grilled beef, a beef meatball, beef
with lettuce and beef in rice soup, but the most interesting is
ground, spiced beef tightly wrapped in green-purple polygonum leaves,
which gives it a savory, aromatic quality faintly nutty with a
suggestion of mint.</TE>
<TE>   That, I must admit, is about as much beef as even the star of a
"real meat for real people" commercial could consume. Good as it is,
my affections lie with the seafood. Ca nuong, a whole grilled catfish
(you can choose among three sizes of fish ) is fit for a wedding
banquet. The flesh is moist and juicy, skin nicely charred and
thickly strewn with ground peanuts, fried garlic and shallots. The
protocol for devouring this beauty is to wrap hunks of the fish in
lettuce and herbs.</TE>
<TE>   I also like cha ca thang long, grilled snapper in a very mild but
flavorful curry sauce and flecked with dill. A more aggressive curry
sauce is used on frog-leg saute, a spice lover's dream; the frog is
mostly a vehicle for the curry, which is flecked with pieces of chewy
black mushrooms.</TE>
<TE>   The hot pot with seafood is another fondue-like arrangement, with
clams, white fish, shrimp and red snapper. You simmer them to your
taste into a pot of broth that's a lot like hot-and-sour soup, but
with too much lemongrass for my taste. Better is "clam butter stew,"
clams in their shells swimming in a garlicky (and buttery) fish broth
nicely spiked with basil.</TE>
<TE>   Fresh herbs, sublime curry, spring rolls--having retraced my steps
through two meals at Da Lat, the Vietnamese cuisine I first enjoyed
in New York is seemingly served again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Da Lat is moderate. Appetizers run $5.95 to $9.95, noodle and rice
dishes $4.95 to $5.95, entrees $12.95 to $14.95. Large entrees for
two or more are $14.95 to $42.95. Beer and wine.</TE>
<TE>   Da Lat Bistro, 16525 Brookhurst St., Fountain Valley, (714)
839-8338. Open 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily.</TE>

<HD>These 'Idyll' Moments</HD>
<DH>Camerata Pacifica continues the celebration of diversity in
its repertoire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let it not be said the resident chamber music champion, Camerata
Pacifica, doesn't celebrate diversity. During the season, the
impression given is that its classical music repertoire is a vast,
multifaceted world, full of surprises and comforts.</LD>
<LD>   Last month's program, for example, had as its second-half anchor
the romantic main course of Brahms' Sonata in E flat for Viola and
Piano, nicely realized by violist Donald McInnes and pianist Joanne
Pearce Martin.</LD>
<LD>   But the real jewels were tiny, rare things tucked in the crevices.
Nino Rota, best known as film director Fellini's composer, was
represented in oboist Lesley Reed's performance of "Elegia," probably
the season's finest music under three minutes. Elliott Carter's own
early tonal "Elegie" was haunting, with its ruefully meandering
melody.</LD>
<TE>   This weekend's program is probably the season's most definably
modern concert, but that's no reason to stay away. George Crumb's
"Idyll for the Misbegotten" blends in with the soothing sounds of
Debussy, Honegger, a pinch of Rachmaninoff and Bartok's juicy Sonata
for Two Pianos and Percussion, persuasive evidence that 20th century
music can be exciting business.</TE>

<TE>   Further Adventures in New Music: It must be something about
spring. The New West Symphony's program this weekend also leans
toward newer scores, between Argentine composer Ginastera's
"Estancia" and music from John Corigliano's score to the film "The
Red Violin," featuring soloist Charles Stegeman. Berlioz's beloved
"Symphonie Fantastique" finishes off a warhorse-free concert.</TE>

<TE>   Seeds of Art-Making: Head up the stairwell to the Upstairs Gallery
at Natalie's Fine Threads in Ventura and you get a reliable hint that
it's not business as usual. The distinctive wall sculpture called
"Balance of Nature" has a list of materials that includes leaves,
roots, grasses and other natural elements interwoven into a form like
a giant seed pod.</TE>
<TE>   This is a ripe introduction to the artistic world of Richard
Solomon, whose strange, pleasing exhibition "From a Seed" openly pays
tribute to aspects of nature and the culture of Native Americans. The
Los Angeles artist assiduously avoids traditional art supply sources
and instead scavenges materials from nature, bringing the outside
organically in.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, this work springs from the art and artifacts of the
Matussa Tribe, including a replica of a child's "birthing blanket"
and several storytelling "staffs." In "Seed Looker," the materials
include gnarled palm branches and the dry, desert-evoking coyote
melon.</TE>
<TE>   Seeds come to symbolize fertility and creativity for the artist,
whose work might sound too perilously new age for comfort. But seen
firsthand, the results are intriguing, thanks to Solomon's knack for
melding materials into a happy, cogent and artistic whole.</TE>
<TE>   * "From a Seed," works by Richard Solomon, Upstairs Gallery at
Natalie's Fine Threads, 596 E. Main St., Ventura. Ends April 13.
Tuesday-Saturday, 10:30 a.m.-5 p.m.; Sunday, noon-4 p.m. (805)

<TE>   Last Call for O'Neill: This is the last weekend to catch the Santa
Paula Theater Center's production of Eugene O'Neill's "A Moon for the
Misbegotten," a long, sometimes intense and ultimately satisfying
evening of theater, intelligently directed by Gerald Castillo.</TE>

7th St. Friday-Saturday, 8 p.m.; Sunday, 2:30 p.m. Ends April 7. $15

<HD>A Night for Soloists to Take Spotlight</HD>
<DH>The members of the Dave Douglas New Quintet display their
individual talents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trumpeter Dave Douglas leads so many different ensembles--from the
Tiny Bell Trio to Parallel Worlds--that it almost takes a scorecard
to keep track of what he's doing. But none of his other enterprises
is any better than the group he brought to the Jazz Bakery on
Tuesday, which he simply calls the Dave Douglas New Quintet.</LD>
<LD>   It's a modest title for an ensemble that includes a lineup of some
of the most talented young players in the current jazz scene:
saxophonist Chris Potter, pianist Uri Caine, bassist James Genus and
drummer Clarence Penn. And, although it's the same group that is
present on Douglas' latest CD, "Infinite," the live performance at
the Bakery was superior in almost every way to the recorded effort.</LD>
<LD>   The New Quintet has been described as Douglas' tribute to the
Miles Davis band of the late '60s. Though certain aural similarities
were present--Caine, for example, played the electric Fender Rhodes
piano, and many of the themes had a somewhat mainstream, '60s-ish
quality--it would be more accurate to describe the set simply as a
first-rate example of contemporary improvisational jazz.</LD>
<TE>   The material was intermittently compelling--especially during a
cover of Rufus Wainwright's "Poses," as well as a Douglas original,
"Penelope," which included the odd insertion of a phrase from Davis'
classic "Boplicity." But, for the most part, this was an evening in
which soloing, by all the quintet members, took the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas' most attractive qualities as an improviser were related
to the remarkable similarity that his phrasing, sound and
spontaneously generated lines bore to the work of the late trumpeter
Don Ellis. Like Ellis, Douglas approached his solos with an active
musical intelligence and a facile ability to articulate his musical
thoughts. On the downside, however, he also--like Ellis--frequently
tended to generate passages that were lacking in emotion.</TE>
<TE>   Potter, however, was consistently superb. At this point in his
career (he is 32), he is on a remarkable run, his playing improving
by leaps and bounds. The improvisational environments Douglas
provided, with their starts and stops, afforded plenty of opportunity
around which to structure offbeat musical ideas. And Potter made the
most of every opportunity. The only problem related to his playing
was that there weren't more opportunities for him to display his
inventive wares.</TE>
<TE>   Caine, Genus and Penn provided fine accompaniment, intently
supportive of the front-line players and inventive in their
soloing--in general, managing to deal effectively with the Bakery's
tricky acoustics.</TE>
<TE>   The Dave Douglas New Quintet, Jazz Bakery, 3233 Helms Ave., Culver
City; today-Friday, 8 and 9:30 p.m. $25. (310) 271- 9039.</TE>

<HD>Covert Conflict Erupts in 'Battle'</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Understanding the fighters in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict now
dominating headlines is a step in trying to understand the fight.
Tonight's gripping "Frontline" documentary "Battle for the Holy Land"
(9 p.m., KCET; 10 p.m., KVCR) went inside covert operations on both
sides in December to explain their different strategies, weaponry and
intelligence gathering.</LD>
<LD>   For the outgunned Palestinians, the battle is waged through "the
balance of terror," as Ali Safouri, an Islamic Jihad leader, puts it.
That is achieved in part by striking Israeli soldiers and civilians
with suicide bombings. The film interviews not only an engineer who
builds the explosive belts used in such attacks but also a would-be
suicide bomber who concludes, "I hope to be martyred after this
meeting."</LD>
<LD>   For the well-armed Israelis, the strategy is to target "only the
people who actually fight against us," says Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland.
Apache helicopters with missiles are one major weapon, as shown in a
Dec. 10 ambush of a suspected Palestinian militant's car. He wasn't
killed, but two children were.</LD>
<TE>   On another Israeli mission, in one of the show's most
heart-pounding sequences, the film follows commandos storming the
house of a man convicted in Israel of being a Hamas terrorist. Shots
are fired by both sides, as women and children watch. The man is
safely captured--a textbook operation. But the cycle of violence
continues.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GUATEMALA CITY</DL>
<LD>Guatemala has accused three U.S. fast-food chains of tax evasion and
may force them to close some of their restaurants in this country,
officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   McDonald's Corp., Wendy's International Inc. and Burger King Corp.
"have deliberately avoided paying millions in taxes," said Mario
Rivera, head of Congress' Public Finance Committee. A Guatemalan
chicken franchise, Pollo Campero, also has not paid millions in
taxes, Rivera said.</LD>
<LD>   McDonald's spokesman Walt Riker said he "didn't know enough to
comment" on the allegations. Calls to Wendy's and Burger King weren't
immediately returned. A spokesman for Pollo Campero told local radio
stations that his company had done nothing wrong.</LD>

<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc. sold $6billion of bonds, 50% more than planned,
to refinance short-term debt and position itself for possible further
acquisitions.</LD>
<LD>   New York-based AOL, the world's biggest Internet and media
company, drew more than $10 billion of bids for its bonds after
offering yields as high as 7.753% to soothe investors nervous about
its financial flexibility as it grows.</LD>
<LD>   AOL will use proceeds to pay down its nearly $4 billion of bank
loans and more than $3 billion of short-term debt, Treasurer Ray
Murphy said. AOL borrowed this year to buy back a 49.5% stake in AOL
Europe from Germany's Bertelsmann for $6.75 billion in cash.</LD>

<LD>John Malone's Liberty Media Corp. had $4.1 billion in costs last year
to write down the value of media-company investments, wiping out
fourth-quarter earnings. That isn't likely to prevent Malone from
making more purchases.</LD>
<LD>   Investors say Liberty Media, a holding company for Malone's cable
and media investments that reported its fifth-straight loss Monday,
may make a second attempt to buy German cable systems after a
$5-billion bid was thwarted by regulators in February.</LD>
<LD>   Investors expect Malone, Liberty Media's chairman, to benefit from
debt-laden companies selling assets at reduced prices as he pursues
European acquisitions.</LD>

<LD>Vivendi Universal Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier was sued by a

<LD>   The suit, filed in New York by Waddington Galleries Ltd., says

Flanagan for $265,734 but backed out of the verbal agreement after
learning that he could buy another cast of the sculpture from
Sotheby's Inc. for less.</LD>

<HD>Dell Expects to Beat Sales Forecast in First Quarter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dell Computer Corp. said Wednesday that fiscal first-quarter sales
will exceed forecasts and profit will meet targets, as the world's
biggest personal-computer maker wins business from rivals and reduces
costs.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue in the period ending May 3 will be about $7.9 billion.
Dell in February said it would earn 16 cents a share on sales of
$7.65billion to $7.82 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Chairman Michael Dell has predicted that corporate PC sales will
revive in the second half. To compensate for the slump, the PC maker
has focused on consumers. In a meeting with analysts in New York
today, Dell will outline plans to boost sales of more profitable
corporate computers, such as servers and storage devices.</LD>
<TE>   "This is very positive for Dell, but I would be cautious about
extrapolating that to the rest of the industry," said James Lyon, a
portfolio manager at Oakwood Capital Management, which owns 136,000
Dell shares and manages $375 million in assets.</TE>
<TE>   Dell shares rose as high as $27 after the revised forecast. They
fell 38 cents to $26.19 in regular trading before the announcement.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call on average expect
earnings of 16 cents a share on revenue of $7.7 billion.</TE>

<HD>Board Considers Delaying Tougher Accounting Rules</HD>
<DH>Regulations: Companies may have more time before they must
add some off-balance-sheet financing to the books.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Accounting rule makers may delay tougher new guidelines for the
financing vehicles used by Enron Corp. to hide debts.</LD>
<LD>   The delay may allow many companies more time before adding costly
liabilities to their books.</LD>
<LD>   The Financial Accounting Standards Board said Wednesday that it
may phase in the change for certain existing entities used to finance
property purchases. For new entities, however, the rules probably
will take effect by August.</LD>
<TE>   FASB Chairman Edmund Jenkins previously said the rules would take
effect for all companies by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to give a little more thought to the transition, whether
there should be a delayed effective date," said Ray Simpson, FASB
project manager.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest effect of the proposed changes would be on thousands
of companies that financed property using so-called synthetic leases.
Those firms would have to begin including that debt on their balance
sheets. The change could add an estimated $100 billion in debt to
corporate balance sheets, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be a big change in practice and it's going to be very
controversial," said Dennis Beresford, an accounting professor at the
University of Georgia and a former FASB chairman. "I suspect there
will be plenty of people who say: 'We don't mind doing this going
forward but we think it's unfair that we have to change everything
now.' "</TE>
<TE>   The FASB staff is preparing a draft of the new rules that probably
will be finished by the end of April. Once it is published, there
will be a public comment period. Then a final version will be
prepared and approved by the board.</TE>
<TE>   In a synthetic lease arrangement, a financial institution sets up
a special-purpose entity that borrows money to finance new
construction or to purchase an existing building for a company.</TE>
<TE>   The entity holds the title and leases it to the company for the
term of the lease, typically three to seven years, with the
possibility for renewal. During the lease's term, the company deducts
interest payments and depreciation of the property's value from its
taxes. For accounting purposes, however, it treats the arrangement as
a standard operating lease and keeps the property and the debt off
its balance sheet.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Filming Slump May Be Easing</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Effects of 2001 strike threats still are
being felt, but rate of decline in local projects slowed in March.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Film, television, commercial and music video shooting on the streets
of Los Angeles fell again in March, albeit it at a slower rate than
in previous months.</LD>
<LD>   The filming figures continue to be affected by last year's writers
and actors strike threats, which led to a rush of filming in the
first half of 2001, followed by a lull.</LD>
<LD>   Figures from the Entertainment Industry Development Corp. permit
agency showed that the total number of days spent shooting in public
areas dropped 13.6% in March from a year earlier and is down 25% for
the first three months of the year.</LD>
<TE>   The drop is the smallest this year, compared with a 33% decline in
January and a 29% falloff in February.</TE>
<TE>   The EIDC numbers include projects shot in areas of Los Angeles
County requiring permits, such as streets, parks and public areas. It
does not include projects on studio lots, but nonetheless is
considered a key barometer of overall activity.</TE>
<TE>   Current EIDC numbers are difficult to compare with figures in
previous years because of the threat last year of a strike by actors
and writers that never materialized. The mere threat of a strike
caused studios to increase production dramatically through spring,
then put the brakes on new shooting because they had stockpiled so
many projects.</TE>
<TE>   The number of days of shooting television projects rose 6% to
1,305. Days shooting feature films, which have been hardest hit
because studios completed so many of them, declined 32% in March,
while commercials dropped 24% to 487.</TE>

<HD>Accounting Firms Sued Over McDonald's Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Simon Worldwide Inc. sued Ernst &amp; Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers and
KPMG International, claiming the accountants should have stopped a
rogue employee who rigged a McDonald's Corp. promotional game.</LD>
<LD>   Simon said the accounting firms failed to oversee the distribution
of game pieces, including cash awards of $1 million, to the fast-food
outlets, according to the suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court.
The company's Simon Marketing unit, which ran the McDonald's game, is
based in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Simon, which lost 75% of its business and 36% of its share value
after the scandal broke, has traded suits with the fast-food chain
over the loss of $20 million in prizes.</LD>
<TE>   The new suit seeks unspecified actual and punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   "Defendants did not perform what was required of them under the
contracts and did not perform what was required of them as
professional accountants," Simon said in the breach of contract and
negligence lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   KPMG said it hasn't seen the suit and declined to comment
specifically on it. Ernst &amp; Young spokesman Les Zuke said he hasn't
seen the suit but "based on what we know, the suit has no merit."
Pricewaterhouse didn't immediately return a call for comment.</TE>
<TE>   A federal grand jury in September indicted 21 people for
conspiring to defraud McDonald's games such as "Who Wants to be a
Millionaire" and "The Deluxe Monopoly Game." Jerome Jacobson, the
former security director for Simon, was accused of stealing winning
game pieces and distributing them to conspirators.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Wakefield, Mass.-based Simon were unchanged Wednesday at
10 cents on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>AOL Exec Urges Tougher Restrictions on Microsoft</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A proposed settlement of the antitrust case against Microsoft Corp.
would allow the software giant to protect its Windows operating
system monopoly and boost its Internet presence, an executive from
America Online testified Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   AOL Vice President John Borthwick backed alternative remedies
offered by nine states still pursuing the case that aim to level the
playing field for non-Microsoft software.</LD>
<LD>   Without such remedies, Borthwick painted a bleak picture for
Microsoft's competitors. He said the new Windows XP operating system,
combined with Microsoft's .NET strategy, allows the company to
dominate the emerging area of services that reside on a Web server
rather than in software on a user's computer.</LD>
<TE>   "Microsoft's proposed remedy does nothing to ensure that Microsoft
will not use its Windows operating system to thwart platform
competition in the market for Web services," he said in written
testimony to U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly.</TE>
<TE>   Borthwick, in charge of AOL's Advanced Services division, was the
11th witness called by the nine states that have rejected the
settlement reached in November by Microsoft and the Justice
Department.</TE>
<TE>   AOL, part of the giant media and entertainment empire of AOL Time
Warner Inc., is a fierce rival of Microsoft. The software giant
charges that its competitors have been behind the 4-year-old case
from the start.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft has said sanctions against it should not go beyond
specific wrongdoings upheld by a federal appeals court last year,
mainly that Microsoft tried to crush an Internet browser made by
Netscape Communications to preserve the Windows monopoly. Netscape
later was acquired by AOL.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly is considering whether the settlement meets a
required public interest standard.</TE>

<HD>Motorola Expects 2nd Annual Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Motorola Inc., the world's No. 2 maker of mobile telephones, will
have a second straight annual loss this year after accounting for
costs related to unspecified "special items."</LD>
<LD>   The company "does not expect to be profitable in 2002 inclusive of
these charges," according to a regulatory filing made last week. Last
year, net expenses for items such as employee severance, bad loans
and gains from selling units totaled $3.3 billion, contributing to a
loss of $3.94 billion, or $1.78 a share.</LD>
<LD>   Motorola said it will be profitable without such items, repeating
forecasts from December and January. Analysts have criticized the
company for not classifying certain items as operating costs,
excluding them from results promoted to investors over those using
generally accepted accounting principles.</LD>
<TE>   "It's hard to get excited ... when you see those recurring
charges," said Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. analyst Wojtek Uzdelewicz, who
rates the stock "neutral" and doesn't own shares. "Until we see clean
numbers coming out, it's hard for me to upgrade the stock."</TE>
<TE>   The shares of Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola fell 30 cents to
$14.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. They have declined 5.1% this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman Scott Wyman said Motorola has "not identified the amount
of the special charges." The company may give more details in its
quarterly conference call scheduled for April 17, Wyman said. When
including the special items, Motorola's results conform to GAAP, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pretax reorganization expenses totaled $1.86 billion in 2001 as
Motorola shed 36,000 jobs, or about a fourth of its work force.</TE>
<TE>   Motorola had $3.33 billion in pretax special items termed "other
charges." They consist of $1.5 billion in potentially bad loans,
mainly to a Turkish wireless operator that's in a legal dispute with
Motorola; $398 million in costs for legal and arbitration
settlements; and $1.2 billion to write down the value of investments.</TE>

<HD>What the SEC Examines During Financial Reviews</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>A Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here are the broad areas of corporate financial reporting that the
Securities and Exchange Commission says it is targeting in reviews:</LD>
<LD>   * Revenue recognition. The agency calls this the No. 1 problem it
has found in reviews of financial reports. Among the accounting
abuses the SEC has uncovered is "round-tripping," meaning
double-counting of transactions between affiliated companies. For
example, a parent company sells computer systems to a subsidiary and
records the sale as revenue and the new system as an asset.</LD>
<LD>   * Quality of earnings. Some companies have opted to improve their
balance sheets "by simply changing accounting methodology and not
disclosing it," the SEC said. For example, an asset that is being
depreciated over five years can "miraculously" boost earnings if it
suddenly is depreciated over 10 years instead, the agency noted.</LD>
<TE>   * Acquisitions. The SEC says it is concerned about reporting at
companies that have bought others and reported a big boost in
financial results. It may be misleading if the "acquiring company
looks great, but the earnings are all in the subsidiary," the agency
said.</TE>
<TE>   * Netting. Companies may run afoul of accounting rules if one-time
gains are improperly netted against operating expenses, making
operating earnings appear better than they really are, the SEC said.</TE>

<HD>AOL Declares Victory  in Spam Settlement</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Internet service provider AOL declared victory in a lawsuit it
settled against a Florida operator of adult Web sites that allegedly
sent millions of unsolicited pornographic e-mails to its members. The
AOL Time Warner Inc. unit filed suit in December 2000 against
Florida-based Cyber Entertainment Network, officially known as
Netvision Audiotext Inc., alleging it paid Web site managers to send
the unsolicited advertising known as "spam" to AOL members.</LD>
<LD>   Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. AOL, the world's
largest Internet service provider, had sought $10 for each
unsolicited bulk e-mail message transmitted.</LD>
<LD>   AOL said the settlement called for it to get a substantial
monetary payment and an injunction calling for Netvision and its
Webmaster affiliates to cease spamming AOL's 34 million worldwide
members. An attorney for Cyber Entertainment Network would say only
that "the matter has been settled."</LD>

<HD>Inktomi's Quarterly Loss Wider Than Expected</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inktomi Corp., whose software speeds delivery of Internet traffic,
said its fiscal second-quarter loss was wider than analysts'
forecasts because companies are buying less software.</LD>
<LD>   The loss was 8 cents to 10 cents a share in the quarter
endedSunday, including amortization of goodwill and other costs. On
that basis, which doesn't follow generally accepted accounting
principles, the Foster City, Calif., company was expected to lose 5
cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<LD>   Inktomi's sales began declining last year as phone and Internet
companies spent less on their networks. Revenue was $30 million to
$31 million in the second quarter, down from an expected $40 million,
according to First Call.</LD>
<TE>   Inktomi shares fell 12 cents to $3.43 on Nasdaq. The preliminary
results were announced after the close of regular trading.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Verizon Communications Inc. and SBC Communications Inc., the two
biggest U.S. local phone companies, paid a combined $2.7million in
penalties last month for failing to give rivals equal access to their
networks.</LD>
<LD>   SBC paid $1.7 million to the federal government in March for not
meeting access benchmarks accepted to win approval for its 1999
purchase of Ameritech Corp. Verizon paid $922,667; Bell Atlantic
Corp. and GTE Corp. agreed to the conditions in 2000 when they
combined to form Verizon.</LD>
<LD>   The guidelines require SBC and Verizon to provide competitors with
access to the lines and switches needed to provide phone service
equal to that given to their own units. When the companies fall short
for three straight months or for six months out of 12, they must pay
federal penalties.</LD>
<TE>   SBC shares rose 42 cents to $37.62 on the New York Stock Exchange;
Verizon gained 10 cents to $45.50, also on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>Corning Inc.'s long-term and short-term debt ratings may be cut by
Moody's Investors Service on concern that its telecommunications
businesses may not recover until well into next year.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based company, the largest maker of glass fiber used
in telecommunications networks, has a long-term rating of Baa1. The
action affects about $5billion in debt securities. Moody's review
will examine when Corning can return to profitability and whether its
restructuring is sufficient.</LD>

<HD>WorldCom to Lay Off 3,700 at Internet Unit to Trim Costs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc., the No. 2 U.S. long-distance telephone and
data-services company, said Wednesday that it will cut 3,700 jobs at
its main data and Internet business, or 4% of its total work force,
to trim costs and offset slowing revenue growth.</LD>
<LD>   The Clinton, Miss.-based company, which employs 85,000 people,
said it will cut U.S.-based staff at its data unit, WorldCom Group,
but will not eliminate any positions at its long-distance telephone
unit, MCI Group.</LD>
<LD>   The layoff total is about half the number that had been expected.
WorldCom has made several moves to cut costs--ranging from halting
salary increases and stock option grants for some workers to
eliminating free coffee. It also has shed about 9,000 jobs in the
last year.</LD>
<TE>   WorldCom Group shares lost 27 cents, or 4%, to close at $6.51, and
MCI Group shares gained 17 cents, or 3%, to close at $5.76, both on
Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom has been dogged in recent months by concerns about its
high debt, questions about its accounting methods and loans it made
to Chief Executive Bernie Ebbers--issues that have drawn the
attention of federal securities regulators.</TE>
<TE>   These woes added to pressures throughout the telecom industry,
such as a glut of high-speed data network capacity, slim demand for
data-transmission services and restrained spending by business
customers in the weak economy.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the company cut its 2002 revenue-growth forecast for
the WorldCom Group to 5%, down from an earlier forecast of
high-single-digit to low-double-digit growth.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the company could cut its capital spending budget by
an additional $1 billion. Last month, WorldCom said 2002 capital
spending for the data and Internet business could be at the lower end
of the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to cutting jobs Wednesday, WorldCom moved to trim its
massive $30-billion debt load. Using its improved cash position, the
company said it would redeem $700 million of notes.</TE>
<TE>   The company said its cash pile increased because it reaped about
$800 million in proceeds from selling its stake in News Corp., and
its operations generate free cash flow.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said restrained capital spending and cost-cutting moves
also helped add to the cash cushion.</TE>

<HD>New Wave of Accounting Probes Deepens Fear</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Scrutiny may produce more volatility in stocks
and earnings in the short term, analysts warn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A new wave of disclosures about accounting investigations this week
is deepening concerns about the extent of corporate misreporting of
results in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street, still reeling from the Enron Corp. debacle, is facing
an ever-lengthening list of companies whose financial reporting may
have been less than straightforward since the late-1990s.</LD>
<LD>   This week, platinum miner Stillwater Mining Co. said the
Securities and Exchange Commission had raised issues about how the
company accounts for its metal reserves.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, telecom giant Qwest Communications International Inc.
said it may face SEC action over its accounting methods.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC also has opened a probe into accounting at cable TV firm
Adelphia Communications Corp. after the firm last week disclosed that
it was on the hook for $2.3 billion in debt not included on its
balance sheet.</TE>
<TE>   Although the SEC has previously said it was launching new
accounting investigations at an unprecedented pace, this week's
disclosures appear to have taken many investors by surprise, based on
the tumbling prices of the stocks involved and the new downtrend in
the market overall.</TE>
<TE>   "Accounting issues arise more frequently when the stock market is
down, but in my 45 years of experience, this is the biggest wave I've
seen," said Edmund L. Jenkins, chairman of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, which writes bookkeeping rules.</TE>
<TE>   The investigations ultimately will be healthy for markets because
they will spur greater openness, or "transparency," Jenkins said. But
at least in the short term they also may produce more volatility in
corporate earnings and in stock prices, analysts warn.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC says the number of accounting-fraud cases on its plate has
been growing for years, but the Enron debacle--and the stock market's
plunge over the last two years--have made regulators and investors
more sensitive and anxious about the accuracy of corporate reporting.</TE>
<TE>   The heightened awareness has led to a greater number of
allegations of wrongdoing, which helps account for the agency's
growing caseload, an SEC spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   In the first two months of this year, the agency said it launched
49 investigations dealing with financial reporting, compared with 18
in the same period of 2001. The SEC hasn't tabulated March data.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid- to late-90s the SEC's enforcement division was focused
primarily on such issues as insider trading, the Salomon Bros.
Treasury-bond scandal and the landmark Nasdaq market price-collusion
case.</TE>
<TE>   By 1999, well before the Enron case broke, the SEC already had
declared accounting fraud to be its top enforcement priority, dubbing
it "The Year of the Accountant."</TE>
<TE>   The agency said at the time that it was particularly focused on
so-called managed earnings, investigating whether companies were
massaging their books to make sure they met Wall Street's quarterly
profit estimates.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC says it has maintained its focus on accounting ever since.
"It may look like this focus is something new, but that's a public
perception not supported by the facts," an SEC spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, strapped for staff while under heavy pressure from
Congress to root out fraud, the SEC appears to be trying to send
strong messages to Corporate America in some recent cases.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Xerox Corp. agreed to settle an SEC probe into its
reporting of results since 1997 by offering to pay a record
$10-million fine, the largest ever levied against a public company in
a financial-reporting case.</TE>
<TE>   The case centered on Xerox's alleged practice of booking lease
revenues upfront rather than over time. The SEC has said that such
"revenue recognition" issues are the No.1 financial-reporting problem
facing its investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the agency charged former Waste Management Inc.
executives with inflating the garbage company's profit by $1.7
billion in the mid-1990s. The SEC called the case "one of the most
egregious financial frauds we have seen."</TE>
<TE>   The weight of all of these cases is raising new doubts among
investors about the truthfulness of the glowing corporate profit
reports of the late-90s that underpinned the record-breaking bull
market on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Although the upshot of the SEC's push for cleaner accounting
should be to ultimately strengthen investors' faith in the U.S.
financial system, for now the reports are adding to the crisis of
confidence on Wall Street, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Even firms that vigorously defend their accounting are getting
punished in the stock market when questions arise.</TE>
<TE>   Interactive TV-software firm Gemstar-TV Guide International, which
this week disclosed that it had recorded nearly $80 million in
revenue last year that was not actually collected, insisted it
followed accepted accounting rules. Yet investors hammered the stock,
fearing the company's growth rate in recent years has been
overstated.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of energy trader Dynegy Inc. fell $1.30 to $28.79 Wednesday
even as the firm defended its accounting treatment of a complex
gas-supply transaction, the subject of a Wall Street Journal article.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy said the transaction--blessed by both its former accounting
firm, Andersen, and its current one, PricewaterhouseCoopers--was a
legitimate way of locking in a long-term supply of gas, reducing its
taxes and cutting a growing gap between cash flow and net income.</TE>
<TE>   "They're searching the closets and bringing it all out now,"
Richard Cripps, chief equity strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore,
said about companies and regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street analysts, blamed for ignoring questionable accounting
that took hold during the market boom, also are showing a new
aggressiveness, quizzing corporate managers closely about
off-balance-sheet financing, revenue recognition and other accounting
issues, Cripps said.</TE>
<TE>   As often happens on Wall Street, in Congress and in the media,
people are showing a tendency to "fight the last war," Cripps said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're asking all the questions they should have asked a year
ago," he said.</TE>

<HD>Founders May Be Ousted at Adelphia</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Shareholders group is expected to seek the end of
the family's day-to-day management of the cable operator.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Adelphia Communications Corp. facing a potential cash crunch and
an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission, a group of
major shareholders was preparing Wednesday to demand that the family
that runs the nation's sixth-largest cable TV company step down.</LD>
<LD>   Sources close to the situation said the shareholder group is
expected to approach the Rigas family by the end of the week with a
proposal to remove them from day-to-day management. The outside
investment group represents more than 50% of Adelphia's equity
shareholders, according to one member of the group.</LD>
<LD>   The investors are worried that Adelphia will not have enough cash
to pay debts that are due soon and will not be able to find banks
willing to lend it more money.</LD>
<TE>   It is unclear whether a shareholder group could unseat the
Rigases, given the family's control of Adelphia's voting stock.
Adelphia, which is based in Coudersport, Pa., is the largest cable
operator in Southern California, with 1.3 million subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia's stock has plunged 43% in the last week since investors
learned the company had guaranteed $2.3 billion in loans, as of Dec.
31, to off-balance-sheet partnerships owned by the Rigas family.
Adelphia already was one of the most leveraged cable companies, with
$14.7 billion in consolidated debt.</TE>
<TE>   The Rigases maintain that the partnerships were previously and
properly disclosed and are backed by sufficient assets.</TE>
<TE>   Yet investors are concerned that the Rigas family partnerships are
not backed by enough collateral and that Adelphia's public
shareholders will be liable if the partnerships default. Investors
believe the partnerships bought $1.8billion of Adelphia stock since
1998 at an average price of $41 a share. The stock now is worth about
a fourth of that.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia closed at $11.04 on Wednesday, down 79 cents on Nasdaq,
near its five-year low.</TE>
<TE>   Concern about off-balance-sheet accounting practices has
intensified since the Dec. 2 Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of Enron
Corp., which used private partnerships to shift debt off its books.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia confirmed Wednesday that the SEC was conducting an
"informal inquiry" into the company's accounting practices and had
asked for clarification and documents related to these "co-borrowing
arrangements" with the Rigas partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, analysts, investors and bond rating companies
have calculated that Adelphia's total off-balance-sheet debt could be
as much as $3 billion because of stock purchases by the family since
December.</TE>
<TE>   Investors have grown frustrated by the company's refusal to
disclose what the Rigas partnerships bought with the money and what
assets serve as collateral for the debt.</TE>
<TE>   "The SEC inquiry ... is a red flag," said Richard Siderman,
analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, which has put Adelphia's debt rating
under review.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the company requested an extension from the SEC for
filing its 2001 annual report so it could review its accounting
practices.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts predict that in light of the Enron scandal,
Adelphia's auditor, Deloitte &amp; Touche, will force the company to add
at least some of the partnership debt to the public company's balance
sheet. In the worst-case scenario, analysts said, this could violate
Adelphia's bank agreements and put it into default.</TE>
<TE>   Investment bankers were busy combing Adelphia's financial
statements for clients who might want to buy additional cable
properties.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia could be forced to sell some or all of its assets to pay
the debts. Some analysts estimate that Adelphia needs an additional
$3billion over the next two years to continue operating and to cover
various debts that are due.</TE>
<TE>   However, this is not the best time to sell cable assets. Two of
the biggest cable operators, Comcast Corp. and AT&amp;T Broadband, are in
the midst of their own merger and are unlikely to take on another
deal. And the second-biggest cable operator, AOL Time Warner Inc., is
in the midst of restructuring with its cable partner.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street sources say Charter Communications Corp., the
fourth-largest cable operator, controlled by computer billionaire
Paul Allen, is eager to buy Adelphia's Los Angeles system, which
serves 500,000 customers.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Los Angeles operation is the pride of Adelphia founder
John Rigas, who operated mostly in small and medium-sized communities
before his $3.4-billion acquisition two years ago of Century
Communications Corp. As part of that deal, Century founder Leonard
Tow became Adelphia's largest shareholder outside the Rigas family.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Hires Financial Advisor</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Accounting firm Andersen said Wednesday it hired investment bank
Gleacher Partners as its financial advisor to help it weigh options
that could include selling off practices or filing for bankruptcy
protection.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen is looking to sell its U.S. tax and consulting units to
focus on its auditing business, in line with the restructuring
recommended by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker, head
of a seven-member board that has taken control of the company.</LD>
<LD>   Gleacher, a boutique investment bank focused on corporate
restructuring, will help Andersen remodel its operations under the
Volcker plan, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen has been indicted for its role as auditor of Houston
energy trader Enron Corp., which filed for bankruptcy protection in
December. Clients have abandoned the Chicago company in droves, and
many experts expect a bankruptcy filing unless Andersen can soon
settle criminal obstruction-of-justice charges with the Justice
Department over its shredding of Enron-related documents.</TE>
<TE>   Talks with KPMG on a global merger fell apart this week, prompting
several of Andersen's non-U.S. units to merge with rivals. Its
Singapore arm agreed to link up with Ernst &amp; Young on Wednesday, a
day after its Spain unit signed on with Deloitte &amp; Touche.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of one of the key
congressional committees investigating Enron, said Wednesday that he
is considering legislation that would impose tighter quality
standards on accounting firms.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Tauzin's House Energy and Commerce Committee
released documents showing that one of Andersen's internal quality
review auditors had objected to some of Enron's accounting methods,
but was overruled by other Andersen auditors working on the Enron
account.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin said he is considering whether Congress should give the
Financial Accounting Standards Board more power to enforce the rules
it sets, or require that decisions made by internal quality review
boards of accounting firms not be overruled by other auditors.</TE>
<TE>   "One option is to make certain that the decisions of the
[internal] boards are mandatory," Tauzin said. "We're looking at a
possible separate piece of legislation on accounting standards and
practices."</TE>
<TE>   The Louisiana congressman said his committee would postpone
hearings into Andersen's role in the Enron collapse in light of the
Justice Department's indictment. But he is investigating Enron's own
shredding of documents and other potential wrong-doing.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin made the comments during a trip to California this week to
meet with Hollywood studio executives and Silicon Valley leaders to
discuss digital technology, content protection and copyright issues.</TE>

<HD>Asbestos Suit Brings $33-Million Jury Award</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In what is believed to be a record asbestos injury verdict in
California, a San Francisco jury has awarded $33.7 million in a case
involving a 60-year-old former electrician with a rare and incurable
form of cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Alfred Todak blamed his cancer on his exposure to asbestos on
several jobs from 1960 to 1976, including work around insulation and
boilers aboard Navy ships and around joint compound on construction
sites.</LD>
<LD>   In November 2000, almost 25 years after Todak quit the electrical
trade to become an international nursing recruiter, he sought
treatment for shoulder pain and learned that he had mesothelioma, a
cancer caused by asbestos exposure.</LD>
<TE>   Mesothelioma, which most commonly begins in the lining of the
lung, usually is discovered 15 to 40 years after initial exposure.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a recognition of how terrible a disease this is and how
really unfair it is to a guy like Mr. Todak," Gilbert Purcell, his
lawyer, said Wednesday. "It's a recognition that people are still
getting ill ... that we are not out of the woods for people who had
exposures into the '70s."</TE>
<TE>   Todak and his wife, Stephanie, sued more than 25 firms with ties
to products that contained asbestos and to which he believes he was
exposed. The award includes $22.7million for Todak's pain, suffering
and loss of income and $11million for his wife's associated losses.</TE>
<TE>   The Todaks will not receive the entire award, even if
it withstands appeal, because 18 firms settled for a total of $4.2
million before the verdict, most of them before trial.</TE>
<TE>   Foster Wheeler Ltd., the last defendant remaining when the case
went to the jury, was held liable for 30% of the total verdict, or
$10.6 million. The New Jersey design, engineering and construction
firm said it will appeal the verdict. The company said Todak failed
to present credible evidence that he was exposed to one of the
company's naval boilers, as he had charged.</TE>
<TE>   The largest jury verdict in a single-victim asbestos case came
last August. A Texas jury awarded $55.5 million to a former
home-building worker who blamed his mesothelioma on the asbestos in a
Kelly-Moore Paint Co. joint compound he was exposed to on
construction sites in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the previous record verdict was $20.5
million awarded a year ago to a man who blamed his mesothelioma on a
career in a Stockton plant that made pipe containing asbestos.</TE>
<TE>   A fire-retardant mineral fiber prized as a cheap source of
insulation and filler, asbestos has been used in thousands of
products, from floor tiles to automotive brakes. More than 550,000
lawsuits have been filed since the 1970s against companies that made,
used or sold asbestos or products that contained it, contributing to
the bankruptcies of more than 50 firms.</TE>
<TE>   The Todak decision was the first against Foster Wheeler, which has
attempted to settle claims where victims show evidence of injury and
exposure to a company product. It has fought claims from people who
are not sick or cannot prove exposure.</TE>
<TE>   Through the end of 2001, more than 300,000 claims against the
company had been closed without payment, and 220,000 had been
settled, a company spokesman said. Foster Wheeler had 110,000 claims
pending at the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Among the companies that settled with Todak was Viacom Inc., which
picked up its asbestos liabilities through its acquisition of the
former Westinghouse Corp. Viacom agreed to pay Todak $1 million. The
entertainment giant spent $21 million on asbestos settlements and
defense last year and disposed of about 60,000 claims, according to
its latest annual report. Viacom had 106,000 claims pending at the
end of 2001.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Reorganizes; President Belluzzo Is Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN and JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. announced an unexpected shake-up in its management
structure Wednesday that includes the resignation of President and
Chief Operating Officer Rick Belluzzo just 14 months after he assumed
the posts.</LD>
<LD>   The reorganization ends an awkward 21/2-year relationship between
the software behemoth and Belluzzo, a veteran of Silicon Valley
hardware stalwarts Hewlett-Packard Co. and Silicon Graphics Inc.
Since joining Microsoft in September 1999, insiders say he failed to
embrace the company's distinctive corporate culture--a shortcoming
that led to his ouster.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft said the reorganization will give more autonomy to the
leaders of the company's core business units, including those
focusing on the Windows operating system, the MSN Internet service,
Business Solutions and the home and entertainment markets. All of
those units will now report directly to Chief Executive Steve
Ballmer.</LD>
<TE>   "We realized we needed to give our core leaders deeper control and
accountability in the way they run their businesses," Ballmer said in
an e-mail to employees.</TE>
<TE>   Belluzzo, 48, will stay on as president and chief operating
officer until May 1 and remain with the company through September to
ensure that the transition goes smoothly, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Belluzzo said the change will give him the
opportunity to return to a role as CEO, a position he held for less
than two years at Silicon Graphics, the Mountain View, Calif.-based
maker of high-performance computers.</TE>
<TE>   An e-mail from Belluzzo to employees seemed to suggest that his
pending departure wasn't entirely of his own choosing. "While the new
organization structure affects me personally, I'm pleased with the
direction we are taking to give the individual business owners
greater control and accountability for their goals," he wrote. He
also said that it was the right time to pursue his goal of leading
his own company.</TE>
<TE>   The reorganization, which was announced after the markets closed,
initially came as a surprise to Wall Street. But analysts later said
the decision made sense.</TE>
<TE>   "Belluzzo is a hardware guy in a software world," said Brendan
Barnicle, senior research analyst with Pacific Crest Securities in
Portland, Ore. "With the charismatic leaders Microsoft has in [Bill]
Gates and Ballmer, it's hard to see where a third leader can fit in."</TE>
<TE>   Investors took the news in stride. After dropping 97 cents to
close at $56.33 in regular Nasdaq trading Wednesday, Microsoft shares
recovered some of the loss in after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft employees said that Belluzzo had been a poor fit
culturally at the insular company, which tends to rotate high
achievers through a multitude of jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Few outsiders have come to Microsoft at high levels in the
organization and done well. And Belluzzo, with 25 years of experience
in more buttoned-down companies, didn't follow the lead of Ballmer
and other top executives who spent long hours in the office and then
saw co-workers socially.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, Belluzzo chose to live in Seattle, not in the
East Side communities where many workers reside near the Redmond,
Wash., corporate campus. And some employees said they weren't sure
Belluzzo ever developed a deep knowledge of the company's far-flung
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   They also said they were concerned that the centralizing process
that began with Belluzzo's elevation to president appeared to be
reversing, with at least seven units reporting directly to Ballmer.</TE>
<TE>   The reorganization comes a day after Rick Sherlund of Goldman
Sachs reduced his earnings projections for the company. But Microsoft
has not issued an earnings warning for the quarter ended March 31, as
it has when it knew it would disappoint investors.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no operational decisions we ever make because of a
quarter's worth of business," Microsoft spokesman Corey duBrowa said.
"This is about looking toward the future growth of the company."</TE>

<HD>Bristol-Myers Lowers Profit, Sales Forecasts</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: Firm says quarterly results may fall 30%
on poor drug earnings. Revamp is planned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANSDELL PIERSON and EDWARD TOBIN</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. on Wednesday cut its first-quarter revenue
and earnings forecasts amid poor sales of key drugs and said it was
taking steps to remedy its "unacceptable" performance.</LD>
<LD>   Bristol-Myers said it plans to cut excess stockpiling by
wholesalers, reduce costs and implement a management shake-up that
includes the departure of Richard Lane, president of worldwide
medicines. Chief Executive Peter Dolan has assumed command of the
pharmaceutical business.</LD>
<LD>   The promise to revamp the company follows setbacks that have
lowered its stock price by more than 40% in the last six months and
spurred discussion that the company is a takeover target.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of the New York-based firm tumbled to a four-year low
Tuesday after Bristol-Myers said surplus stockpiling last year of its
medicines by wholesalers would crimp demand for its products. On
Wednesday, Bristol-Myers shares plunged as much as 16% to $31.65 in
after-hours trading, after falling 26 cents to $37.70 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "The company's current business performance is unacceptable and I
am taking steps today, and may take additional actions in the future
as necessary, to strengthen our organizational structure, focus our
priorities and accelerate our future growth," Dolan said after
markets closed.</TE>
<TE>   Dolan, who took over as CEO in May 2001, said strong measures were
"absolutely necessary" for the company's future.</TE>
<TE>   But not all analysts were convinced the announced actions were
sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are just completely incompetent," said Barbara Ryan,
an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. "The guy at the head of the
ship, who has destroyed untold value, is now taking over running the
whole thing. And we're supposed to be comforted by that?"</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers said earlier this week that it would adjust its
first-quarter forecast. But the extent of the shortfall in revenue
and earnings was worse than analysts had expected.</TE>
<TE>   "What's surprising is the magnitude of the reduction," Ryan said.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers said Wednesday that it expected first-quarter
earnings to be between 44 cents and 47 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   That is well below the 56 cents expected by Wall Street analysts
and reflects a 25% to 30% decline in earnings from the same quarter
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers said it expects earnings per share to fall 25% to
30% for the full year. But the forecast excludes the negative effect
of the cost of reducing wholesaler inventories, which it said was
equivalent to about 35 cents to 40 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   The firm earned $2.41 a share in 2001, a 12% increase over 2000.
The company estimates sales for this year will decline to the low
single-digit-percentage range compared with 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers also said it expects first-quarter revenue to be
down 7% from the same quarter last year, following patent expirations
on many of its key drugs that have ushered in a wave of cheaper
generic rivals.</TE>
<TE>   The company has lost patent protection on three of its key
products in the last 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   In February, clinical trial data was less than impressive for the
most important drug in the company's pipeline--an experimental blood
pressure treatment called Vanlev.</TE>
<TE>   And its $2-billion partnership with ImClone Systems Inc., which
was engineered by Dolan, received a crushing blow in December when
U.S. regulators refused to accept ImClone's marketing application for
the cancer drug Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   Dolan has been dubbed a spendthrift by some analysts for plunking
down so much to acquire partial rights to Erbitux and for paying
almost $8 billion last year for DuPont Co.'s pharmaceuticals
arm--about $2 billion more than rival bidders.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Services Sector Continues to Expand</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The massive U.S. services sector expanded for a second straight month
in March, according to data released Wednesday, adding to mounting
evidence that the U.S. economy is bouncing out of a shallow
recession.</LD>
<LD>   Though the pace of activity in services moderated from the nearly
11/2-year peak hit in February, growth in new orders and the waning
pace of job cuts suggest the sector, which includes everything from
transportation to legal and financial services, may see steady growth
in the months ahead.</LD>
<LD>   The Institute for Supply Management, an industry trade group, said
its monthly non-manufacturing index slipped to 57.3 in March from
58.7 in February, against market expectations for a 57 reading. March
marks the second straight month the index has stayed above the 50
mark that indicates expansion.</LD>
<TE>   "It is a pretty good report. It is telling you there is a
recovery, but the big question for the markets is how much of it is
inventory related and how much of it is longer lasting," said Carey
Leahey, senior U.S. economist at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Restocking of warehouses, after excess inventories of unsold goods
were worked down over the last year, is boosting first-quarter
growth, but analysts and the Federal Reserve are uncertain whether
demand is strong enough to sustain healthy growth in the second half
of this year.</TE>
<TE>   "On balance, we believe the recovery is underway," Chicago Fed
President Michael Moskow said. But he added that the expansion needs
to see a rebound in business spending and on that front, "the timing
and ultimate magnitude remain quite uncertain."</TE>
<TE>   ISM's inventories index slipped to 50 in March, indicating
material inventories were unchanged after February, when service
sector companies added to their stocks for the first time in 16
months.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the ISM non-manufacturing index surged to its highest
levels since November 2000, capping a series of unexpectedly strong
U.S. reports that prompted economists to raise their U.S. growth
forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts now are looking for the United States to shoot out
of a mild recession with annual growth in the first quarter expected
to be between 5% and 6%.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Wednesday, a report showing vigorous activity in U.S. home
loan applications despite a modest rise in mortgage rates suggested
that consumer spending, barely dented by last year's economic
downturn, remains bright.</TE>

<HD>Homestore's 4th-Quarter Loss Widens</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Homestore.com Inc. posted a wider net loss for its fourth quarter and
said it took a one-time charge of $960 million as it finished a
review of past results and restated the first three quarters of 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The online real estate services company revealed a series of
accounting errors last year that led to the resignation of its
chairman, multiple trading halts and the restatement of some of its
financial results.</LD>
<LD>   Homestore said it lost $146.6 million, or $1.26 a share, before
the one-time charge, compared with a loss of $53.6 million, or 65
cents, a year ago, as revenue rose 85% to $97.2 million.</LD>
<TE>   In its restatement, the Westlake Village-based company reduced
revenue for the first three quarters of 2001 by $123 million, while
increasing its net loss by $113.2 million, to $3.44 a share from
$2.35.</TE>
<TE>   The results reflect the outcome of an investigation into its
accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Cash and cash equivalents available to fund operations stood at
$52.5 million at the end of December, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore shares rose 5 cents to $2.30 Wednesday on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Anxiety Pushes Blue Chips Down</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: The Dow slips to its lowest level in a month. New
accounting probes add to investor nervousness.</DH>
<SE>Markets</SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks fell again Wednesday as investors struggled with worries over
the Mideast conflict, continuing woes in the technology sector, new
accounting probes by federal regulators and more hints the economy
may not be recovering as quickly as expected.</LD>
<LD>   The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average suffered its fourth
straight loss, losing 115.42 points, or 1.1%, to close at
10,198.29--its lowest level in a month. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's
500 index fell 11.36 points, or 1%, to 1,125.40. The technology-laden
Nasdaq composite index fell 20.05 points, or 1.1%, to 1,784.35, as a
number of software companies issued profit warnings.</LD>
<LD>   Losers led winners by 5 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange and by
3 to 2 on Nasdaq. Volume was on the light side, continuing a recent
trend.</LD>
<TE>   "The market is realizing that maybe [corporate] earnings are not
going to be as rosey as people thought they were going to be," said
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for Wells Fargo Bank. "The stock
market may have run ahead of itself, ahead of profit expectations."</TE>
<TE>   Several stocks also were hammered by questions about their
accounting methods. Energy trader Dynegy fell $1.30 to $28.79 after
the Wall Street Journal reported the company used special accounting
methods to boost its cash flow. At the same time, cable and phone
company Adelphia Communications said its books were being probed by
the Securities and Exchange Commission, which also is reportedly
investigating the energy firm Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia fell 79 cents to close at $11.04, while Williams dropped
$1.09 to close at $23.08.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to investor nervousness was fierce fighting in the Middle
East that some feared could lead to disruption in oil supplies and
higher prices worldwide. After hitting six-month highs on Tuesday,
oil prices eased slightly Wednesday on a report of sharply increased
U.S. stockpiles. Crude futures for May delivery dropped 15 cents to
$27.56 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Another politically sensitive commodity, gold, also fell slightly
after a four-day rally. Near-term gold futures fell $3.30 to $302.60
an ounce, after reaching $308.</TE>
<TE>   Lower prices for oil and gold didn't improve stock investors'
mood, however, and the pessimism extended to a tepid economic report
on the services sector.</TE>
<TE>   The Institute for Supply Management said its monthly
nonmanufacturing index fell to 57.3 in March from 58.7 in February.
Although any number over 50 is considered positive, market watchers
were worried that the slippage shows companies may not be growing or
adding jobs as quickly as they had hoped.</TE>
<TE>   Economists also are concerned that the March unemployment rate,
scheduled to be reported Friday, will rise to 5.6% from 5.5% in
February.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to get layoff notices every single day," Sohn said.
"That's an indication that earnings are still under pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Without strong profit growth, the market is likely to remain in a
trading zone--not declining steeply unless wide-scale fighting breaks
out in the Middle East, but not climbing much until clear signs
emerge that companies are making money and hiring new workers, said
James Paulsen, chief investment officer for Wells Capital Management.</TE>
<TE>   "You could get a profitless, jobless recovery," Paulsen said.
"There's no indication that's happening yet, but it's at the back of
people's minds."</TE>
<TE>   Other market watchers dismissed such fears, and pointed to the
recent relatively low trading volumes as a sign that investors aren't
abandoning the market en masse. Indeed, late in the afternoon the Dow
rebounded from a 174-point drop after buyers began looking for
bargains.</TE>
<TE>   "The market is fine," said Al Goldman, chief markets strategist
for A.G. Edwards. "What we had was a tremendous rally since Friday,
Sept. 21, and the last two months we've been working off some of the
excesses."</TE>
<TE>   One area where expectations grew too fast, analysts said, was
computer software. Business software maker PeopleSoft on Tuesday
helped squash hopes for a quick rebound, saying earnings missed
analysts' expectations. Other software makers, including Vitria
Technology and DigitalThink followed with their own profit warnings
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Vitria, which said its first-quarter loss would be much larger
than analysts expected, fell 80 cents, or 23%, to $2.63. Shares of
DigitalThink dropped 71 cents, or 35%, to $1.33 after the company
said its quarterly results would fall short of forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   The Goldman Sachs software stocks index fell 2.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Bond yields fell for a second day on the weak economic news. The
yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 5.28% from 5.34%
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In other market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * 3M fell $2.08 to $112.91 after a Lehman Bros. analyst said its
shares were richly valued and there is concern about slowing sales
and higher costs. 3M shares have climbed 67% the last six months.</TE>
<TE>   * Caterpillar dropped $1.48 to $54.92. J.P. Morgan Securities
analyst Gary McManus said the expected economic rebound may already
be factored into manufacturing stocks and lowered his rating on the
stock to "long-term buy." McManus also cut his rating on
Ingersoll-Rand, which fell $2.06 to $46.89, and Parker Hannifin,
which lost $2.08 to $46.70.</TE>
<TE>   * Oil shares declined along with crude prices. Exxon Mobil fell 69
cents to $43.69, ChevronTexaco lost 86 cents to $90, and oil and gas
producer El Paso lost 87 cents to $45.60.</TE>
<TE>   * Philip Morris was one of only three of the 30 stocks in the Dow
average to gain, adding 24 cents to $53.30. South African Breweries
is in exclusive talks to buy U.S. brewer Miller from Philip Morris
for about $5 billion, according to published reports.</TE>

<HD>Optimism Buoys Mexican Peso, Markets</HD>
<DH>Latin America: An improved image and a sense that the
economy is benefiting from the U.S. recovery have investors flocking.
But not all signs are positive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>The Mexican stock market is up a buoyant 13% this year, ranking it
among the best-performing markets worldwide. The peso continues to
defy gravity as interest rates fall and investors flock.</LD>
<LD>   theseQue pasa?</LD>
<LD>   Mexican markets are on a roll, buoyed by the country's improved
image abroad and optimism that its economy is reviving after a
yearlong recession, thanks to the beneficial effects of the nascent
U.S. recovery. This year's stock market gains follow a respectable
13% bump in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Steady flows of foreign investment and the general feeling that
Mexico has its act together are fueling the optimism. Signs of a
recovery are evident in lower unemployment rates in February, a
pickup in job growth during the last two months and rising exports
since December.</TE>
<TE>   "Just as we went down together last year, the Mexican and U.S.
economies are going up together now," said Alfredo Thorne, chief
Latin America economist at J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. in Mexico City.
Said Jonathan Heath, a Mexico City economist with LatinSource: "Our
recession probably ended in February."</TE>
<TE>   Not all signs are positive, and some analysts go so far as to say
investors have overdone it by bidding up stocks as high as they have.
Industrial activity remains depressed, with jobs at the assembly
plants called maquiladoras at a four-year low. As of January,
consumption was at best sluggish.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion, the Mexican stock market went ahead of itself. The
long-term perspective remains solid. But when you look at individual
companies, you see very little growth in short-term profits," said
Henry Garrido, senior emerging markets analyst at Montgomery Asset
Management in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Others say the economic signals are not conclusive.</TE>
<TE>   "The industries I talk to say markets are still soft. All except
auto companies are still experiencing contraction in sales," said
Mexico City economist Rogelio Ramirez de la O. Car sales here were
boosted by a round of price cuts and no-interest financing deals such
as those given to U.S. consumers late last year.</TE>
<TE>   John Christman of think tank Ciemex-Wefa in Mexico City said the
assembly plants concentrated along the border, where goods are
assembled mainly for shipment to U.S. markets, have taken a
tremendous hit and that the outlook is "still pretty grim."</TE>
<TE>   As of January, the latest month for which figures are available,
the number of maquiladoras had dropped 9% from the previous year to
3,367 and jobs had fallen 18% to 1.07 million.</TE>
<TE>   "U.S. economic indicators seem to be picking up, and if that
continues to be the case, maquiladoras will feel the effects sooner
or later. But there is traditionally a lag time of two to three
months," Christman said.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican stocks lost 1.7% in Wednesday trading after the government
announced $1.2 billion in budget cuts, saying they were necessitated
by lower tax collections and oil revenue in recent months. The cuts
won't help the economy and could, in fact, stifle it.</TE>
<TE>   Still, analysts such as Brian Gendreau of Salomon Smith Barney in
New York, who look to the medium and long term, are upbeat about
Mexico. He cites improving economic fundamentals and the recent
investment-grade status bestowed on Mexican debt by top rating firms.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of momentum in the Mexican market. Investors feel
very comfortable there, happy with the rating upgrades, believing
that Mexico is becoming increasingly integrated with the U.S. economy
and that it's a safe haven from international turmoil," Gendreau
said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the strongest evidence of Mexico's rebound can be seen in
the strength of the currency, now at a 10-month high of about 9 pesos
to the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   A rising tide of foreign investment has put demand pressure on the
peso, boosting its value. Its continuing strength confounds the
forecasts of many economists.</TE>
<TE>   The peso's value has been pumped up by the flood of cash that made
Mexico the final destination for 20% of all foreign investment in
emerging markets last year, according to the Institute for
International Finance.</TE>
<TE>   Low inflation, which is expected to reach only 4.7% this year, has
enhanced the peso's appeal, LatinSource's Heath said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mexico is joined to the hip of the United States, and so Mexico
is a play on the U.S. economy. If we have the U.S. recovery that we
expect, one that will surprise the consensus, Mexico will feel the
impact," said Geoffrey Dennis, emerging markets strategist at Salomon
Smith Barney in New York. One-quarter of Mexico's economic output is
sold in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Mutual funds based in the U.S. and Europe bought $162.6 million of
Mexican stocks in January and February, Salomon's Gendreau said. That
purchasing activity has been partly responsible for the double-digit
gain in Mexican stock values this year, which compares with a 2% drop
in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index. Mexico's main stock index has
outperformed most major markets this year.</TE>
<TE>   Some economists are concerned the strong peso will impede a
recovery because it makes Mexican exports more expensive.</TE>
<TE>   But economist Alfredo Coutino of Ciemex-Wefa says that effect is
balanced out by the steadily declining tariffs on Mexican products
entering the U.S. as a result of the North American Free Trade
Agreement, now in its ninth year.</TE>
<TE>   Mideast jitters have sent crude prices to their highest levels in
a year, good news for the Mexican government, whose budget is 38%
dependent on taxes from oil sales. Dennis warns that if prices remain
high too long, thereby stifling a U.S. recovery, Mexico could suffer.</TE>

<HD>Miramax Acquires Rights to Two 'Pokemon' Sequels</HD>
<DH>Movies: The company gets the franchise two years after the
frenzy but says it will reinvigorate the cartoon monsters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAUDIA ELLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Miramax Films, which specializes in edgy art-house movies, has
acquired the theatrical, home-video and television distribution
rights to the next two "Pokemon" movie sequels in North America and
all international territories outside Asia.</LD>
<LD>   The movie firm, owned by Walt Disney Co., also has first crack at
distributing future animated "Pokemon" films.</LD>
<LD>   Distribution rights to the first three "Pokemon" movies were
licensed to Warner Bros., which controls the rights to two "Pokemon"
TV series airing on the Kids WB! network. Warner also was in the
bidding for the fourth and fifth movie installments.</LD>
<TE>   Miramax Co-Chairman Harvey Weinstein said he closed the Pokemon
deal late Tuesday but declined to disclose financial details. A
source close to the negotiations said Miramax paid a low upfront
guarantee of $1 million and promised the rights holders an attractive
75% on back-end profits.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax negotiated the deal with Pokemon USA Inc., the brand
management licensing subsidiary of the Japanese consortium that owns
the Pokemon franchise in which the three largest investors are
Nintendo Co., Creatures Inc. and Game Freak Inc. All of the low-cost
Pokemon cartoons are produced in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax has landed the Pokemon franchise at an odd time, two years
after the frenzy over the warring cartoon monsters peaked.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Weinstein said his company can "reinvigorate the franchise"
using Miramax's marketing savvy. "We'll come up with a bolder,
smarter marketing concept," he said. Miramax plans to release
"Pokemon 4" in October.</TE>
<TE>   Although the first three Pokemon movies were profitable for Warner
Bros. because of their low acquisition costs, their popularity has
dwindled since the original was released in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "Pokemon: The First Movie" grossed $85.7 million domestically,
according to box-office tracking firm Exhibitor Relations Co. One
year later the sequel, "Pokemon: The Movie 2000," managed only about
half as much, $43.7 million. The most recent installment, "Pokemon 3:
The Movie," took in just $17 million a year ago. Internationally, in
all territories outside Asia where Warner distributed the films, the
numbers also fizzled. The last sequel grossed $12 million.</TE>
<TE>   This week, New York-based 4Kids Entertainment Inc., which
represents all merchandising and TV and film distribution rights to
Pokemon outside Asia, reported that the company's fourth-quarter
profit plummeted 74% as revenue from the cartoon franchise declined.
4Kids Chairman Al Kahn was quoted as saying that the company's
results "reflect the slowdown of Pokemon-related licensing revenues
between 2000 and 2001."</TE>
<TE>   Another indicator of Pokemon's decline: For the first time in more
than two years, Pokemon last week fell from Internet search engine
Lyco's list of the 50 most frequently searched sites. When Lycos
began the list in 1999, Pokemon debuted at No. 1 and stayed there for
a year.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Weinstein has faith that the characters will rise
again. "For us," he said, "this is a big fish and a valuable brand."</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein has been stockpiling projects to start a new family film
label to complement Miramax's art-house movie business and the more
mainstream films of its Dimension Films label, run by younger brother
Bob. Dimension's 2001 release "Spy Kids"--a James Bond-like action
hit that grossed $113 million--already has spawned a family movie
franchise. The sequel is due this summer. Plans for a third movie are
in the works.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time the Weinsteins have attempted to launch
a family division. In 1993, they unveiled Miramax Family Films with
"Into the West." When the film flopped, Miramax dropped its family
label. Harvey Weinstein subsequently said he should stick to what he
knows best--adult movies.</TE>

<HD>GM Recalls 1.9 Million Cars</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp. is recalling 1.9 million Chevrolet, Pontiac,
Buick and Oldsmobile cars to fix an ignition-switch problem that
resulted in smoke or fires in 159 cars and injuries to four people.</LD>
<LD>   The recall involves 1995-1997 Chevrolet Cavaliers and Pontiac
Sunfires and 1996-1997 Buick Skylark, Pontiac Grand Am and Oldsmobile
Achieva models, said Jim Schell, a spokesman for the world's largest
auto maker. The vehicles will be fixed to prevent a high electrical
current through the ignition switch that can cause a fire, the
Detroit-based company said.</LD>
<LD>   None of the fires reported have occurred while the cars were being
driven, and the fires typically start within minutes of an
unsuccessful attempt to start the vehicle, the auto maker said. The
injuries were from smoke inhalation, Schell said.</LD>
<TE>   Owners are being told in letters when they should go to a
dealership for the free repairs. Auto makers typically have several
recalls in a year and the payment for the incidents are taken out of
reserves set aside for that purpose. GM didn't say how much the
recall would cost.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors shares fell 63 cents to $59.35 on the New York
Stock Exchange. They have gained 22% this year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Williams Cos., the second-largest U.S. natural gas pipeline operator,
said it was asked by federal regulators in February to clarify its
third-quarter earnings.</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission sent "an informal, routine
inquiry letter" that was answered promptly, Williams spokesman Jim
Gipson said. The SEC has no other questions "as far as we know," and
Williams considers the matter closed, he said.</LD>
<LD>   An SEC spokesman declined to comment.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC is examining the accounting of companies such as Tulsa,
Okla.-based Williams, Adelphia Communications Corp. and Global
Crossing Ltd. after Enron Corp., once the biggest energy trader, hid
losses and debt from investors and filed for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Williams shares fell $1.09 to $23.08 on the NYSE, after earlier
touching $21.40, an 11% decline.</TE>

<LD>Membership in the United Auto Workers increased about 4.3% last year,
giving one of the largest U.S. labor unions a rank-and-file gain for
the first time in more than two decades.</LD>
<LD>   The UAW said its membership stood at 701,818 at the end of 2001,
an increase of 29,865 from the previous year.</LD>
<LD>   Until last year the UAW's membership, which declined by about 12%
in 2000, had decreased steadily since 1979, when it boasted 1.5
million members.</LD>
<TE>   The union's downsizing largely has been due to Detroit's Big Three
auto makers, which slowly have cut their blue-collar work forces
because of pressures from foreign competitors.</TE>

<LD>Hertz Corp., the biggest U.S. car-rental company, said it eliminated
base commissions paid to North American travel agents on certain
transactions, following similar moves by several major airlines.</LD>
<LD>   Hertz said the change, effective immediately, was made because of
continued weak travel demand, and the need to further reduce costs.</LD>
<LD>   The company, a unit of Ford Motor Corp., said the move will affect
mostly U.S. and Canadian corporate and government accounts with
individually negotiated rate programs. It won't affect travel agency
commissions for leisure car rentals, or for other business rentals.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Ford fell 31 cents to $15.06 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration isn't probing approval of
Schering-Plough Corp.'s allergy drug Clarinex, the Internet
publication FDAWebview said, contrary to a report it published
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The report of an investigation is "untrue," the subscriber-based
online newsletter reported Wednesday, citing an unnamed FDA source.</LD>
<LD>   FDAWebview on Tuesday reported the FDA was investigating approval
of Clarinex because an outside firm that inspected Schering-Plough's
manufacturing plant may have had a conflict of interest. FDA
officials said Tuesday that the use of third parties doesn't pose a
conflict. They wouldn't comment on whether there was an
investigation.</LD>
<TE>   "We regret any misleading effect this chain of events has had,"
the story said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Kenilworth, N.J.-based Schering-Plough rose 83 cents to
$30.77 on the New York Stock Exchange after dropping 2.3% on Tuesday.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Federal Trade Commission will proceed with its challenge of
Libbey Inc.'s $277.5-million purchase of Newell Rubbermaid Inc.'s
Anchor Hocking unit, rejecting Libbey's offer to buy just part of the
glassware maker.</LD>
<LD>   The FTC told a federal judge that the agency voted to move ahead
with a lawsuit opposing the proposed purchase by Libbey, the largest
U.S. maker of food-service glassware. Anchor Hocking is the No.3
producer. The FTC in December voted against the combination, saying
it would reduce competition.</LD>
<LD>   Libbey, which in June agreed to buy all of Anchor Hocking's stock
for $332million, revised the transaction in January after the FTC
sought to block the purchase.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Toledo, Ohio-based Libbey fell $1.35 to $38.45 on the
NYSE. Freeport, Ill.-based Newell fell 41 cents to $31.43, also on
the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Skechers Expects to Beat Estimates</HD>
<DH>Retail: The shoemaker credits strong sales and cost cuts
for its first-quarter profit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Footwear maker Skechers USA Inc., which has been swiping market share
from industry giants such as Nike and Reebok, said Wednesday that it
should beat Wall Street profit estimates for the first quarter by at
least 25% because of strong sales and cost cuts.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement by the Manhattan Beach-based company surprised
analysts and boosted Skechers' stock price by 14%. The news comes as
Skechers is recovering from earnings disappointments in the second
half of last year.</LD>
<LD>   "They had a much better first quarter than we thought and it's
really driven by the performance of the brand at its key retailers,
particularly in its moderate-priced channel," said Steven Richter, an
analyst with RBC Capital Markets. "The brand is performing,
particularly the athletic look is working at retail right now."</LD>
<TE>   The company said sales for the first quarter should be more than
$235 million. A consensus from estimates at First Call had expected
earnings of 34 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Skechers said sales were surging across all product lines, which
include casual and hiking shoes for men and trendy platform styles
for women. The company's athletic shoes have grabbed market share
from the larger athletic shoe companies by selling at lower prices,
analysts said. Spring shoe styles also are selling well, the firm
said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Skechers closed on Wednesday at $21.64, up $2.73, after
brisk trading on the New York Stock Exchange. More than 2.7million
shares changed hands, almost eight times the daily average over the
last three months. The stock price is up 48% in 2002 but is still
down nearly 9% compared with a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Skechers, like many shoemakers, slogged through a tough earnings
year in 2001 but still managed to rake in sales of more than $960
million, up from $675 million the previous year. The company has cut
excess inventory, improved inventory management, laid off 5% of its
workers and closed its catalog operation.</TE>
<TE>   "They're about as diversified across product lines as any company
in the world," said Joseph Teklits, an analyst with Wachovia
Securities. "The key to the business is staying on top of trends with
styling but at lower price points than the competition."</TE>
<TE>   Skechers also is staying in the spotlight by enlisting movie and
music stars--including Matt Dillon and Robert Downey Jr.--in its
advertising and by introducing new products, such as roller skates
with sneaker tops. They hit stores last fall, selling for about $65
for children and about $85 for adults.</TE>
<TE>   About 9% of Skechers' 2001 revenue was devoted to advertising,
said the company, which sells its products in department and
specialty stores and also has 83 of its own stores in more than 20
states.</TE>
<TE>   Skechers President Michael Greenberg declined to estimate how much
the shoe skates business might boost sales in the future, but said it
will be "sizable" because the skates already are being sold in a
number of large department stores.</TE>
<TE>   In most segments of the footwear industry, shoe sales continue to
struggle, after a tough 2001, said Susan Lapetina, strategic-planning
director for American Apparel &amp; Footwear Assn. in Arlington, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "Compared to last year, we're at about the same pace," Lapetina
said. "Business is still very tight and very difficult."</TE>

<HD>Toyota Revises Offer to Repair Damaged Vehicles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an effort to put an embarrassing episode behind it, Toyota Motor
Sales USA has revised and sweetened its offer to repair Toyota and
Lexus vehicles with engines damaged by oil sludge buildup.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's best-selling import brand has come under fire in
recent weeks for rejecting customer claims that engine damage in 1997
and later vehicles equipped with 3.0-liter V-6 engines or 2.2-liter
4-cylinder engines is caused by a flawed design.</LD>
<LD>   After receiving about 3,300 complaints over a three-year period,
Toyota said last month that although it believes the problems were
caused by owners who did not follow proper engine maintenance
schedules, it would pay for repairs for claims made through the end
of this year if the cars were 1997 through 2001 models and still
under warranty.</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, however, Torrance-based Toyota Motor Sales, the U.S.
arm of Japan's Toyota Motor Corp., abandoned that hard-line stand.</TE>
<TE>   It said it now will warranty Toyota and Lexus vehicles with the
two engine types against sludge damage for eight years.</TE>
<TE>   The company also extended the sludge protection plan to
V-6-equipped 2002 models, eliminated mileage limits and said it will
pay not only for repairs but also for incidentals such as the cost of
rental cars.</TE>
<TE>   The engines in question are used in Toyota's Avalon, Camry, Celica
and Solara cars, Sienna minivan and Highlander sport utility vehicles
and in the Lexus ES300 sedan and RX300 SUV.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota continues to insist that the sludge problems, which can
cause damage to an engine's internal moving parts, are not caused by
an engine flaw but by customers' delaying engine oil changes.</TE>
<TE>   The modification Toyota is making to its 3.0-liter V-6 "is not a
repair," said spokesman John Hanson, but an effort to help prolong
engine life for new customers who might not adhere to oil-change
schedules.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota instituted the broad new "customer satisfaction plan,"
Hanson said, "to show that we stand behind our products and to
reassure our customers that they shouldn't lose any sleep over this
issue. If there is a problem, we will take care of it."</TE>

<HD>World Trade Center in Long Beach Is Bought</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 27-story Long Beach World Trade Center and adjoining Hilton Hotel
in downtown Long Beach have been sold for an undisclosed amount to a
joint venture that plans to add more office space as well as housing
and shops to the seaside development.</LD>
<LD>   An affiliate of the project's developer, Kajima USA, sold the
about 12-acre complex at Ocean Boulevard and the Long Beach Freeway
to a joint venture of Ensemble Investments and an investment
partnership managed by AEW Capital Management on behalf of
institutional investors. The new owners also purchased the land,
which had been leased from the Port of Long Beach, for $20.4 million.</LD>
<LD>   The 550,000-square-foot office building was completed in 1989, and
the 393-room hotel opened in 1992. They were to be part of a much
larger complex with nearly 3 million square feet of office, hotel and
retail space. But only a single office tower and the hotel, which
were developed for about $150 million, a plaza and some retail space
were completed before the recession of the early 1990s halted further
expansion.</LD>
<TE>   Despite a turnaround in the Long Beach office market in the late
1990s, the World Trade Center remains about 15% vacant and any future
development on the site will be far smaller than originally planned,
said Kam Babaoff, managing director of Phoenix-based Ensemble, which
owns other office buildings and property in downtown Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The firm will start working on plans to build a mix of housing,
retail and more office space on a seven-acre site north of the
existing hotel and office building, Babaoff said. His company plans
to refurbish the guest rooms of the Hilton Hotel as part of an effort
to attract more travelers.</TE>

<HD>State Will Get the Shaft From Mining</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP R. PRYDE and JIM DIPESO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An axiom of protecting America's natural heritage is that a win is
only temporary, but a loss is forever.</LD>
<LD>   Nowhere is this more true than open pit mines--immensely damaging
projects that leave toxic scars on the public's land and cleanup
liabilities with the taxpayers. Californians can look forward to more
of the same if the proposed Glamis Imperial Project, near the
Colorado River in eastern Imperial County, is approved.</LD>
<LD>   Conservationists, Native American tribes and local residents
thought this bad idea had been put to rest in the 1990s when
then-Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt rejected the mine. The project
is back, however, thanks to Babbitt's successor, Gale Norton.</LD>
<TE>   Mining interests have considerable influence with the Bush
administration, and the Glamis project, about 45 miles from El
Centro, appears to be another example of special interests calling in
chits.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the Bush administration appears to be overlooking
or ignoring several important considerations. Left out of its
political calculus was the toxic cyanide that will have to be poured
over small mountains of low-grade ore to leach out tiny flecks of
gold.</TE>
<TE>   Or that the mine owners, once the mine has ceased operations, plan
to leave behind an open pit, 850 feet deep, in the publicly owned
California Desert Conservation Area.</TE>
<TE>   Or that the intrusion would wreck a landscape held sacred by the
Quechan Indians, contrary to the Interior Department's legal
obligation to protect such lands.</TE>
<TE>   Or that a huge industrial operation would mar the quality of
natural experiences in the nearby Indian Pass wilderness area and the
Picacho State Recreation Area.</TE>
<TE>   Or that gouging a mine in a wild landscape would destroy or
degrade 1,600 acres of habitat for desert tortoises, bighorn sheep
and migratory birds.</TE>
<TE>   Or that digging, operating and cleaning up after this unneeded
mine would burn huge amounts of fuel and other energy that could be
much better used elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   When the mining is done, can Americans feel comfortable that
reclamation will be adequate and that they won't get stuck with the
bill for yet another Superfund site? History doesn't give cause for
optimism.</TE>
<TE>   The West is pockmarked with mines that went bust and left the
taxpayers with seven- and eight-figure cleanup tabs. Bureau of Land
Management regulations do not mandate sufficient bonding to cover the
costs when irresponsible companies fail to clean up after themselves.
In the case of Glamis Imperial Corp., we already know the company
won't finish the cleanup job. Glamis officials have announced that
they plan to leave one of three pits unfilled after the mine is
closed. The company says it won't be able to afford returning the
desert to its former state. Such freeloading is reason enough to
reject the mine.</TE>
<TE>   As owners of the public lands, the taxpayers shouldn't have to do
business with an irresponsible tenant. How many apartment owners
would rent to a person who announced plans to leave a hole in the
ceiling at the end of the lease?</TE>
<TE>   Not to mention, some of the damage could not be cleaned up at any
price. No amount of money could compensate for damage to the
Quechans' cultural heritage. The Bush administration should uphold
the original decision to reject the mine. Otherwise, as President
Reagan was fond of saying, the federal government wouldn't be part of
the solution but part of the problem.</TE>

<HD>Safety Is Still On Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AVIGDOR HASELKORN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The violence in Israel and the occupied territories has stirred fears
that the conflict will spiral into the use of unconventional
weaponry. These fears are exaggerated.</LD>
<LD>   While it is true that if the Palestinians possessed weapons of
mass destruction they would have little compunction about using them,
the fact that they haven't been used strongly suggests they lack
them.</LD>
<LD>   The political groundwork for such an escalation, though, has
already been laid down by Yasser Arafat in his repeated accusations
that Israel has used poison gas against his people. And many
Palestinians believe that such attacks could indeed defeat Israel, or
at least punish it for its "crimes."</LD>
<TE>   Israel has no incentive to resort to any means other than those
currently employed in the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   For Israel, unconventional weapons are an option of last resort.</TE>
<TE>   Although Palestinian militants have dabbled in chemical warfare
since the 1970s, their efforts have been amateurish.</TE>
<TE>   For example, since 1994 traces of various toxic chemicals have
been found in at least five Palestinian bombing attacks. The most
recent time was Dec. 1, when at least one of two bombs detonated
simultaneously by suicide attackers in downtown Jerusalem contained
rat poison.</TE>
<TE>   In all cases, however, the blasts destroyed the pesticides'
potency, thus preventing chemical injuries to the victims.</TE>
<TE>   The situation could change, though, if some outside element were
to undertake a mission using unconventional weapons on behalf of the
Palestinians, or provide them the required arms and training.</TE>
<TE>   For example, it has been reported that Nabil Oukal--Osama bin
Laden's envoy to Gaza and the West Bank who was arrested by Israeli
security in June 2000--was interested in poisoning water sources.</TE>
<TE>   More worrisome, the London Times on Jan. 2 quoted "Israeli
intelligence chiefs" expressing concern that the leaders of the
military wing of Hamas living in Qatar, Syria and Jordan were
"becoming ambitious and are trying to get hold of sarin and other
nerve gases."</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear if Bin Laden's Al Qaeda organization could pull off
a major attack using weapons of mass destruction. Using Sept. 11 as
an indicator, it would seem more likely that such an attack would
come in the form of a suicide mission on a country's own chemical,
biological or nuclear facilities.</TE>
<TE>   But in a state so preoccupied with security as Israel, such an
attack would not be easy.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, rogue states like Syria or Iran have so far refrained
from transferring toxic agents to any of the terrorist organizations
they sponsor. They apparently appreciate the risks that such a
consignment would potentially expose them to.</TE>
<TE>   The exception could be Iraq's Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi leader
believes that the Bush administration is gunning for him. His
capacity to deliver chemical or biological agents via missiles or
airplanes is insufficient to deter the U.S., and a desperate Hussein
could view Palestinian suicide terrorists as an attractive option to
deliver his weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi leader already is doing all he can to encourage suicide
attacks against Israelis as a means to interfere with Washington's
war plans. Even if he were to go, he would rather be remembered by
his last "gift" to the Palestinians than by his chemical attacks on
Kurds and Iranians.</TE>
<TE>   But Israel is very much on guard for such nightmares and would do
all in its power to preempt the threat. Even if its efforts failed,
an unconventional Israeli response would be far from automatic. Much
would depend on the impact of the attack. For instance, past
Palestinian chemical warfare has not elicited harsh Israeli responses
because the attacks themselves were so ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   After the 1991 Gulf War, then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir hinted
he would have kept his cool as long as Israeli casualties were
light--even if Hussein had unleashed weapons of mass destruction
against Israel. Shamir believed that his restraint would have enabled
the U.S. to solve the Hussein problem once and for all.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the situation is similar, and the Israeli civilian
population is better protected against chemical or biological agents
than a decade ago. Still, it is certain that if Israel suffered mass
casualties as a result of a Palestinian terrorist attack using
weapons of mass destruction, its response would be overwhelming. Yet
it need not be a response using unconventional weapons. Indeed, given
the growing presence of U.S. troops in Iraq's vicinity, there is a
good chance it will not be.</TE>

<HD>Let Chief Parks Ride Into the Sunset</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RON SEBAN and RICHARD EIDE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bernard C. Parks should not be offered a new five-year contract as
chief of the Los Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   His policies have led to mismanagement of the department. The cost
of his policies in terms of the police mission, as well as the human
toll, outweighs any benefit he may claim.</LD>
<LD>   These are the issues that have characterized Parks' tenure:</LD>
<TE>   * Recruitment. Parks has created a working environment of fear,
hostility and distrust.</TE>
<TE>   The exodus of young officers and tenured officers and the
inability of the department to attract new recruits are a direct
result of Parks' policies.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998 the LAPD had more than 9,800 officers. Despite several
costly out-of-state recruitment efforts and a vigorous local
campaign, this number has fallen to 8,910.</TE>
<TE>   * The disciplinary system. Parks' disciplinary system demands the
same level of investigation, no matter how small or frivolous the
issue, and has tripled the workload of those involved in the process.</TE>
<TE>   One example: A citizen complained that a police helicopter was
making too much noise.</TE>
<TE>   He was told that officers were looking for a robbery suspect, and
said, ''Great! I hope you get him.''</TE>
<TE>   This still was considered a formal complaint, necessitating the
full administrative process.</TE>
<TE>   No one objects to being held accountable. What officers object to
are the cost and the unreasonableness of the system.</TE>
<TE>   While hundreds of homicides go unsolved because of inadequate
investigation and lack of resources--in 1997 the homicide clearance
rate was 70%; by 2000 it had plummeted to 43.8%--an inordinate amount
of time and resources is spent on frivolous complaints.</TE>
<TE>   * Community-based policing. Community-based policing is dead
because of Parks.</TE>
<TE>   The senior lead officers were the best personification of the
department to residents and the most effective at dealing with
community issues.</TE>
<TE>   Parks removed them with no input from anyone.</TE>
<TE>   The community police advisory boards are another casualty of
Parks' tenure.</TE>
<TE>   He has total control over their makeup and agenda, and, as a
result, has limited input and severely damaged the relationship
between them and residents.</TE>
<TE>   * Morale. Parks has been absolutely devastating to morale.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997 there were approximately 80 resignations. By 2000, this
number had escalated to approximately 340.</TE>
<TE>   The facts are clear from the number of people leaving and the 93%
no-confidence vote in a police union poll by the rank and file.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997 approximately 60% of officers leaving the department were
retirements, with the remaining 40% from resignations. By 2000 this
trend had reversed, with approximately 60% resignations and 40%
retirements.</TE>
<TE>   There are many reasons why officers are leaving: the climate of
fear and intimidation Parks has created, the hostile and degrading
atmosphere employees work under, the unfairness and double standard
of discipline, the cronyism and lack of integrity associated with his
promotions, his failed policies and the lack of hope for improvement
in any of these issues.</TE>
<TE>   If Parks is reappointed, the department, the city and the
community will get another five years of what it has now.</TE>
<TE>   Much damage has been done, and even after Parks is gone it will
take years for the department to recover.</TE>
<TE>   It is the community that suffers when a department is in chaos.</TE>
<TE>   Those whose responsibility it is to correct this disastrous
situation must do the right thing.</TE>
<TE>   Reappointing Chief Parks to a second five-year term is tantamount
to putting new shoes on a dead horse.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

retired in 2000 after 27 years with the LAPD. Richard Eide, former
commanding officer of the narcotics division, retired in 2001 after
26 years with the LAPD. This article was submitted to the Los Angeles

<HD>Antidote to the Liberal Monotone: Blogging</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Internet is irritating the liberal establishment.</LD>
<LD>   There's a simple, predictable reason for this: It's awash in
uncontrolled speech and unedited squibs of the haphazard kind that
people might just prefer to the pigeonholed blurbiage of
mainstream--printed--newspapers and magazines.</LD>
<LD>   Obviously, this could be disastrous for the left's carefully
combed and bowdlerized opus of ideals served up daily on the gray
pages of nearly every big-city newspaper in the country. The Internet
is a chaos of heterodoxy. It is a place where you can disseminate
dangerous notions.</LD>
<TE>   And people are doing just that. What people? Well, the vast
right-wing conspiracy, of course. You remember them? All of repentant
Clinton basher David Brock's former friends. They're alive and well
on the Web.</TE>
<TE>   They're writing Web logs, or "blogs." Also called "me-zines,"
these vanity sites are proliferating at an alarming rate and
attracting substantial daily readership. One of the most popular such
sites, andrewsullivan.com, written by the eponymous pundit and former
New Republic editor, gets about 35,000 hits, or visits, a day.
Another, InstaPundit.com, run by University of Tennessee law
professor Glenn Reynolds, just reported a record 43,000 visits in one
day. A year ago, it was almost unknown. Meanwhile, author and former
New Republic writer Mickey Kaus' irreverent Kausfiles.com is equally
popular while serving up a sharp reality check on the accepted
blather.</TE>
<TE>   There are, of course, blogs of all persuasions on the Net, but the
stars of the genre tend to tilt right of center. This is
understandable, given the leftward swing of the mainstream press. The
Web is an outlet for ideologically homeless opinion-mongers, and the
smart ones are using it. Their audience? Readers and viewers who are
hungry for alternative points of view.</TE>
<TE>   Most blogs are running commentaries on the day's events. They
feature links to noteworthy articles from publications around the
world, the Jerusalem Post to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Readers get
the blogger's take on the issues and then can read the relevant news
items for themselves. Best of all, the bloggers often critique the
way the news is reported, exposing subtle biases in language or
filling in conspicuously omitted facts. Kaus and Sullivan do this
especially well.</TE>
<TE>   This may be exactly the reason why they and their fellow bloggers
are making enemies fast. They're touching a nerve.</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Globe's Alex Beam, for example, wrote derisively of the
genre in a recent column: "Welcome to Blogistan, the Internet-based
journalistic medium where no thought goes unpublished, no
long-out-of-print book goes unhawked and no fellow 'blogger,' no
matter how outre, goes unpraised."</TE>
<TE>   Eric Alterman wrote in the Nation: "While [Sullivan's] site
arouses a certain gruesome car-wreck fascination, it serves primarily
as a reminder to writers of why we need editors. [It] sets a standard
for narcissistic egocentricity that makes Henry Kissinger look like
St. Francis of Assisi."</TE>
<TE>   Why are Web logs so infuriating to their shrewish detractors? Is
it really the narcissism? Or is it the political opinions being
expressed? Ask yourself this question: If Palestinian intellectual
Edward W. Said were blogging, would Alterman and Beam be calling him
a navel gazer? Or would they praise his brave alternative point of
view and complain that the mainstream press is too conservative?</TE>
<TE>   Web logs are infuriating because they are thoughtful alternatives
to the self-important New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Washington
Post and their toady satellites, much of whose reporting has become
hardly less biased than the bloggers'. Bloggers at least have the
honesty to admit their biases up front. They don't pretend to be
objective.</TE>
<TE>   But they do provide a healthy criticism of the liberal
establishment's hopelessly arrogant monotone. What's more, they make
news interactive, so that we can all stop yelling at the television
and actually do something. Readers can opine, as well as argue,
grapple or exchange expletives with their host. That's something
you'll never get in print.</TE>
<TE>   As one popular blogger, Minneapolis Star Tribune columnist James
Lileks (lileks.com), put it: "The newspaper is a lecture. The Web is
a conversation." Amen.</TE>

<LD>The bus drivers strike hammering the Los Angeles Unified School
District this week might have been another staggering blow to
parental morale and students' waning hope for the excellent education
to which they should be entitled. But even the staunchest critics of
the LAUSD--and yes, that includes this editorial page--have to admit
that Supt. Roy Romer and his crew are handling this potentially
debilitating crisis rather gracefully.</LD>
<LD>   District officials say that by 8:30 Wednesday morning, on the
second day of the strike by 700 employees of the private Laidlaw
company, substitute drivers had picked up 80% of the bused students.
Moreover, officials actually have a strategy, giving priority to the
18,000 special ed students and to children who attend classes on a
year-round calendar and are scheduled this week to take the Stanford
9 standardized test required by the state. First they're picking up
kids in neighborhoods where waiting for the bus can be dangerous and
then they pick up the other students.</LD>
<TE>   The district should certainly encourage Laidlaw to work toward a
quick solution with the strikers, who make far less and have fewer
benefits than LAUSD drivers--many of whom started out with private
companies. Indeed, few school districts depend as much on busing as
the LAUSD. Every school day, 2,200 buses crisscross the sprawling
district, picking up children in Pico-Union, the Mid-Wilshire
district, Koreatown and other densely populated areas and dropping
them off in the San Fernando Valley, Pacific Palisades and the
Westside. It adds up to 75,000 students rattling along in traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, parents would be more impressed if the district were as
efficient at raising math and reading scores as it was at
transportation. And while most of the students who spend time in
those iconic yellow vehicles are riding voluntarily--31,000 go to
far-flung magnet schools, for instance--15,000 are shoved onto buses
to get them off campuses that are overcrowded because the district
has failed in its school-building responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   So, in some ways the sign-waving bus drivers spotlight the
district's many shortcomings. (Studies have documented the toll
suffered by bused students, who as a rule do not do as well as their
peers who walk to school.) But so far, the district's handling of the
strike bodes well for how it might take on its myriad other crises.</TE>

<LD>Radio stations sound the same from San Diego to Schenectady. The
homogenization began in 1996 when Congress lifted the cap on the
number of stations a single network could own. About the only break
from the three or four cookie-cut Ashanti/N'Sync/Clint Black playlist
variations comes from a growing number of independent ''Webcasters''
who stream colorful and original programming on the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Congress may wind up shutting them down, though, if it allows the
U.S. Copyright Office to levy draconian "sound recording performance
royalties" on enterprises transmitting over the Internet. The
proposed fee--a bit more than 1/10th of a cent per song per
listener--may not sound like much, but when you realize that most
Webcasters have zippo revenues and that they would have to pay the
fee retroactively since 1998, the truly crippling cost becomes clear.
Take a mid-size independent Webcaster--say, two or three people
working out of a home office or dorm room. Their average audience may
have been 1,000 listeners over the past three years. Their bill for
retroactive royalties would be $525,600.</LD>
<TE>   Currently, over-the-air broadcasters have to hand over about 4% of
their revenues as "artist performance royalties" that go to
songwriters and music publishers. American broadcasters, however,
have never been required to pay a sound recording fee because more
than half a century ago they persuaded Congress that record labels
are already well compensated through the promotional benefit of
having their music played. The same logic should apply to Webcasters.
They already have to pay 4% of their revenue in artist royalties.
It's not fair to stick them with a second fee because, if anything,
they provide better promotion than traditional broadcasters by
showing the album they are playing so listeners can purchase it with
the click of a mouse.</TE>
<TE>   The Recording Industry Assn. of America has argued that the
additional fee would help compensate for any damage that computer
geeks might cause by pirating music broadcast over the Internet. The
truth is that in order to stream music, Webcasters have to degrade
its sound quality to the point that it is unattractive to thieves.</TE>
<TE>   So, the only way to explain the fee is as an unwarranted windfall
for the recording industry--but that doesn't fly either, because the
fee would promptly drive the entrepreneurs who are supposed to pay it
out of business. A misguided 1998 law created the problem by
requiring the Copyright Office to impose a new fee. Now federal
legislators need to revise the dictate, making clear that they never
intended it to demolish diversity.</TE>

<LD>Secretary of the Army Thomas E. White worked as an executive at Enron
for 11 years but claims he knew nothing of the shady practices that
led to its downfall. Maybe White really was clueless during his time
at Enron, but he is not doing himself any favors by failing to
properly explain his dealings with the failed energy giant after he
left it.</LD>
<LD>   White unloaded $3.08 million worth of Enron stock in October,
after having sold about $9 million in shares earlier last year. At
the time he was regularly talking with his former colleagues. Now,
instead of providing answers to Congress about the substance of those
conversations, he is portraying himself as another victim of Enron's
collapse. He has even filed for retirement benefits from the company,
whose downfall is likely to condemn thousands of less-well-connected
investors and former employees to retirements much more modest than
they'd ever imagined.</LD>
<TE>   The questions about White's conduct grew after he told the House
Government Reform Committee in January that he had had seven meetings
and 22 phone conversations with Enron executives, including one with
Kenneth L. Lay. Those talks, White said, were "personal in nature."
However, on the evening of March 22, as Congress was about to recess,
White suddenly admitted that he had had an additional 44
conversations with Enron executives on his home telephone. These
chats, he said, were not necessarily personal and would have involved
"some comment or discussion" relating to Enron's financial condition.
In fact, Secretary White had at least 73 conversations within 10
months of entering the Bush administration, at the very time that
Enron was unraveling.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the matter of White's conduct while at Enron, where
he was second-in-command of the Enron Energy Services Division.
According to former Enron employees, White was part of a 1998 effort
in which staff members tapped away on defunct computers to persuade
visiting Wall Street analysts that the division was far more active
in trading electricity and gas futures than it was in reality. Former
Enron employees have also implicated White's division in the creation
of illusory earnings, which were at the heart of the firm's problems.</TE>
<TE>   White has said he wasn't there for the visit and has distanced
himself from Enron's other suspect activities. He has also said,
however, that if his involvement in Enron becomes a "major
distraction" he will step down. That point has been reached. White
may not have done anything illegal. But the secretary of the Army
needs to be like Caesar's wife--beyond suspicion. White's conduct
during and after his tenure at Enron does not meet that standard. He
should resign.</TE>

<HD>Trying to Comprehend the 'Science of Reading'</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"School Excels in Reading by Sticking With What Works" (April 1)
mischaracterizes the whole-language approach to teaching reading.
Whole language does not simply "encourage children to intuit the nuts
and bolts of how words worked"; rather, whole language is based on
the well-supported hypothesis that we learn to read when we
understand what is on the page.</LD>
<LD>   A central task of a whole-language teacher is to provide children
with interesting texts and to help make these texts comprehensible.
Context is one way of doing this, but it is not the only way. Some
direct teaching of phonics also helps make texts comprehensible.
There are, however, severe limits on how much phonics can be taught
and learned: Some rules are extremely complex, many rules do not work
well and different commercial series teach different rules. Most of
our knowledge of phonics is the result of reading, not the cause. The
core element of whole language is meaningful reading. On tests of
reading comprehension, children in classes in which more meaningful
reading is done outperform those in classes in which less reading is
done.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was heartened by your report that Seaton Elementary School, in
an evidently distressed part of urban Washington, is making great
progress in teaching kids to read based upon the money and philosophy
emanating from the education reform bill recently signed by President
Bush. It appears that the reading program emphasizes the teaching of
letters and sounds rather than the whole-language approach. The
article make a point of saying that the Department of Education will
hand out about $5 billion over the next several years to promote
"scientifically based reading research" and adds, "Not philosophy.
Not instinct. Not hope. Science."</TE>
<TE>   Can one possibly imagine President Bush speaking to parents and
educators who promote the teaching of creationism in public schools
and saying that not philosophy, not instinct, not hope but science
shall be the standard to be applied? There's a certain hypocrisy
here. On the one hand, the administration wants to teach kids to
read, presumably so that they can think for themselves. On the other
hand, the administration is conspicuously silent by allowing others
to tell kids what they should think.</TE>

<LD>In "Supreme Court to Hear Three-Strikes Challenge" (April 2) USC law
professor Erwin Chemerinsky states that "California is the only state
where a misdemeanor shoplifting charge can be the basis for a life
prison term." The voting public understood that the third
strike--regardless of what it is--is proof of a pattern of life that
is a clear and present danger to the public. That is the basis for a
life prison term.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the good professor can explain the reason that we need to
"allow" the criminal to commit another violent act, even putting me
and my innocent family at risk of death or permanent injury, before
we impose such a sentence.</LD>
<LD>   Sorry, professor, but California is the only state that has
finally drawn a reasonable line of intolerance toward repeated and
habitual criminal behavior. Read the whole law, sir, not just the
parts that upset you or prove you right.</LD>

<LD>The headline of Kent Scheidegger's March 29 commentary refers to the
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals when it states: "Senate Blocks
Changes to a Court Gone Amok." As a remedy, he suggests that the
Senate confirm President Bush's nominations. But it is Bush who has
gone amok. His nominees, though they may be experienced, are
extremists. The Senate must hold the line until moderate nominations
are put forward.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Civilian Courts Give Terrorists Far Too Many Loopholes"
(Commentary, March 31), lawyer Spencer J. Crona and prosecutor Neal
A. Richardson insist that Zacarias Moussaoui (the alleged 20th
hijacker), Richard Reid (the alleged shoe bomber), Ahmad Omar Saeed
Sheikh (the alleged mastermind of the killing of Daniel Pearl) and
the Al Qaeda detainees in Guantanamo Bay should all be tried for "war
crimes under international law" before the military commissions being
created by the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   But Crona and Richardson seem oblivious to the fact that "war
crimes under international law" are tried in international courts
such as the ones impaneled to try Slobodan Milosevic and those
accused of war crimes in Rwanda.</LD>
<LD>   The wisdom of using international tribunals instead of makeshift
military commissions (which have been criticized by the American Bar
Assn., Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International) is dramatically
confirmed by Crona and Richardson themselves, who applaud the
"swiftness and certainty" of military commissions in "prosecuting the
guilty." International war crimes tribunals exist to ensure that a
nation at war does not indulge in the dangerous presumption of
"guilty until proven innocent."</LD>

<TE>   Re "U.S. Will Seek Death for Sept. 11 Suspect," March 29: Having
had the privilege of serving as judge, jury and executioner on other
occasions, I would like to offer my services to dispose of Al Qaeda
terrorist Moussaoui. Over Iwo Jima on Nov. 7, 1944, when that
Japanese Zero came after my B-24 bomber, I didn't worry for a moment
about reading him his rights or asking his intentions. I just drew a
bead on him and shot him down.</TE>
<TE>   I fail to understand those who propose to keep this monster alive
and spend the time and money on a trial. His friends, whom he would
have joined on their flights if he had not been previously detained,
certainly did not offer any kind of mercy to the thousands who died
on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Japanese pilot who attacked my plane, he chose to involve
himself in an act of war and he deserves to suffer the consequences.
Please advise me how I can volunteer again to act in defense of my
country.</TE>

<LD>"Hollywood Embraces Big-Brother Tactics" (Opinion, March 31) is right
on the button. But one further point about the attitude of the
entertainment industry came out in a story that ran on Jan. 6, "CDs
That Block Copying May Herald a Revolution." A spokesman for Sony was
quoted as saying: "Unless you recover your costs, there's no way you
can make a new motion picture. It's as simple as that."</LD>
<LD>   No, it is not as simple as that. The cost of making films is up to
the makers, who bid up the budgets according to how much they think
they can squeeze out of the public.</LD>
<LD>   If no one would pay Julia Roberts $20 million per picture, would
she be happy with $1 million? $100,000? Of course.</LD>
<TE>   In all the talk about preventing digital copying, people forget
that it is technically impossible to prevent analog copying. One
generation of an analog copy reduces the quality hardly at all, and
then digital copies can be made ad infinitum. Equipment makers would
have to be compelled by law to fit their machines to a (futile)
copy-protection scheme. Can we really afford to trample over civil
liberties in that way?</TE>

<LD>How ironic that you print a rather thoughtful article about the
Middle East by Robert Scheer below one written by [former Israeli
Prime Minister] Benjamin Netanyahu (Commentary, April 2). Remember,
it was Netanyahu's aggressive expansion of the West Bank settlements
that contributed to the problem today. Maybe your readers are fooled
into thinking that Israeli tanks ravaging West Bank cities is the
same as U.S. troops searching for Bin Laden's men in Afghanistan's
mountains; however, the rest of the world is not. They are fortunate
enough to have an objective press.</LD>
<LD>   The day is coming sadly closer when we will witness more attacks
on Jews and Jewish synagogues outside the U.S. (April 2). These
attacks will be indefensible but will simply represent the
frustration that the rest of the world feels in our arbitrary
designation of the terms "terrorist" or "axis of evil."</LD>

provided all the Arab countries agree to step into a time machine and
live as they did in 1967. Native Americans would like their nation
back as well; should we give it to them?</TE>

<TE>   Re "Washington's Burden . . .," editorial, April 2: It seems to me
the "myopic timidity" that is described in that editorial belongs to
the writer of that very piece.</TE>
<TE>   The editorial cites chapter and verse about all of our statesmen,
from Kissinger to Clinton, and their extensive but, admittedly,
futile efforts to achieve a peace between Israel and the
Palestinians, then chastises President Bush for not diving into this
failed diplomacy.</TE>
<TE>   The people responsible for the Sept. 11 attack and the suicide
bombings are not people who abide by negotiations and treaties.
President Bush, by not interfering, is actually pursuing a very
powerful policy. War, as a last resort, is also a form of diplomacy.
The U.S. has done no less in Afghanistan.</TE>

<TE>   Your editorial states, "Leaders have to play with whoever's on the

statement only requires one name: Hitler. Or how about this name:
Osama bin Laden. The Times would never make this assertion if it were
thousands of Americans being blown up in cafes and at their religious
observances. Talk of the need for Israeli restraint is simply
Chamberlain-style appeasement.</TE>

<LD>Re "Politics Remain Stalemated," Opinion, March 31: Kudos to William
Schneider for his definition of the American body politic. As a
dedicated secularist, I am deeply saddened to see the Republican
Party become the political base for conservative Christian orthodoxy.
No better example of this is the current Bush administration's
opposition to government-funded embryonic stem cell research,
abortion and physician-assisted suicide. At the same time, it
supports government funding for religious charities and prayer in
public schools. Government is best when its policies are fact-based,
not faith-based.</LD>

<HD>Clifton Moore, 80; 'Mr. Aviation' Helped LAX Grow</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clifton A. Moore, who earned the nickname "Mr. Aviation" for
overseeing the transformation of Los Angeles International Airport
into the world's third-busiest transportation hub and for his
leadership role in civil aviation, has died. He was 80.</LD>
<LD>   Moore, who retired as executive director of the Los Angeles
Department of Airports in 1993 after more than two decades on the
job, died Monday of undisclosed causes at a hospital in Lancaster.</LD>
<LD>   A self-educated man who had to decline a scholarship to the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology to help support his family
during the Depression, Moore got his first job with the city as an
electrician in 1946. Among his duties was climbing atop City Hall to
repair the beacon that illuminated what was then the tallest building
in Los Angeles and that guided airplanes to the city's small
commercial airport 17 miles away.</LD>
<TE>   When he retired from the Department of Airports, Moore left what
was then the highest-paying job in city government, with an annual
salary of $181,812, and an international reputation in the field of
aviation.</TE>
<TE>   As the department's executive director, Moore helped build an
airport that was instrumental in Los Angeles' growth as a tourist and
business destination.</TE>
<TE>   Under his leadership, LAX underwent a $750-million expansion that
was completed in June 1984--in time for the influx of visitors to the
Los Angeles Olympic Games. The expansion included a second-level
roadway separating departure and arrival traffic, two new terminals
and three new parking structures.</TE>
<TE>   Three years earlier, Moore helped establish the Regional Airport
Authority for Southern California to develop long-range plans for the
region's airport system.</TE>
<TE>   Among his responsibilities with the Department of Airports was
overseeing the day-to-day operations of Van Nuys Airport, Ontario
International Airport and Palmdale Regional Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "As Mr. Airport in Southern California from the '60s to the '90s,
Clif Moore recognized better than anyone the importance of an airport
system to the city and the region," said Lydia H. Kennard, executive
director of Los Angeles World Airports, as the Department of Airports
is now known.</TE>
<TE>   "As demand for air passenger transportation increased dramatically
over four decades," Kennard said, "he worked tirelessly to ensure Los
Angeles became the premier international air gateway on the West
Coast while preparing the city's airports in Palmdale, Ontario and
Van Nuys to help meet the demand for air service in Southern
California."</TE>
<TE>   "He was the first guy who understood way back in the 1960s that
Los Angeles air travel was going to outgrow LAX--that it's important
to be prepared to grow aviation somewhere else," said Councilwoman
Ruth Galanter, whose district includes the airport.</TE>
<TE>   "He was Mr. LAX," said Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., who served on the
Airport Commission in the '80s and early '90s. "What you see out
there now, the new LAX, is the result of the vision of Clif Moore."</TE>
<TE>   In Moore's frequent travels around the world to promote LAX,
Cochran said, "he helped us grow overseas and boost the cargo tonnage
[at LAX]. He understood that LAX is the engine that drove the economy
for Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   When Moore announced his retirement, then-Mayor Tom Bradley
praised him for helping make LAX a major contributor to the city's
economic vitality.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1976, the airport generated only $7.4 billion in our local
economy," Bradley said. "In 1990, the airport was responsible for
infusing $37 billion in our local economy. More than 400,000 jobs are
produced by our airport."</TE>
<TE>   Cochran, who as an airport commissioner occasionally accompanied
Moore on his overseas trips, said Moore was acknowledged abroad as
"Mr. Aviation." And on those occasions when the mayor accompanied
them, Cochran said, officials "didn't know who to honor first.
[Moore] had the stature around the world."</TE>
<TE>   Moore was born in Jamaica Plain, Mass., in 1922, the son of an
electrician for the city of Boston who died when Moore was 10. After
declining the MIT scholarship, Moore was unable to find a job, so he
joined the Navy in 1940.</TE>
<TE>   At 20, he became the youngest petty officer in Navy history. A
chief electrician's mate, he was aboard the destroyer Warden in Pearl
Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, when the Japanese attacked.</TE>
<TE>   After four years of sea duty in the Pacific and the North
Atlantic, Moore settled in Los Angeles, where he got the
electrician's job.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1950s, after working for the Culver City school
district as director of building and maintenance, Moore took a
competitive examination for building superintendent with the Los
Angeles Department of Airports.</TE>
<TE>   He scored the highest and got the job to supervise construction of
the airport's first jet terminal, which opened in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   Five years later, Moore was named first deputy general manager of
the Department of Airports, and in 1968 the Airport Commission chose
him to become general manager, a title later changed to executive
director.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm one of the examples of civil service that show you can start
way down here and end up here," Moore told The Times in 1976, raising
his hand from one level to another. "I would hope that would inspire
others."</TE>
<TE>   During his 24-year tenure, the affable Moore dealt with residents'
complaints over deafening jet noise and airport expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Irate homeowners weren't his only critics. There were those in
City Hall who referred to him as "Marco Polo" because of his constant
traveling.</TE>
<TE>   Once, when he was not present for a City Council committee
meeting, Councilman Robert M. Wilkinson asked sarcastically, "Is he
visiting Los Angeles now?"</TE>
<TE>   Moore defended his travels as necessary to keep air commerce "a
viable part of our municipal life."</TE>
<TE>   Moore would travel to Montreal or Paris to confer with aviation
officials over international landing agreements, or he would be in
Sacramento or Washington, D.C., to testify before legislative
committees.</TE>
<TE>   Much of that, he explained in 1976, was because he was president
of the Airport Operators Council International, which had been
working to reduce jet noise--particularly at its source, the engine.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest problem on this job," Moore said at the time, "is
trying to bring about a satisfactory resolution of the jet noise
problem without depriving the area of the service or putting a burden
on the economy."</TE>
<TE>   Moore's colleagues, who described him as highly approachable, were
impressed by his refusal to adopt top-executive mannerisms. Whereas
department officials who worked for Moore had their offices
redecorated over the years, he maintained the same functional look
his office had when he moved in.</TE>
<TE>   And in 1988, he was still driving the city-owned Chevrolet sedan
he had used for 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   Moore also earned a reputation for being what one employee called
"a very moral man": He would scrutinize computer printouts of the
department telephone bills, adding up all his personal calls so he
could pay for them.</TE>
<TE>   Moore served two terms as president of the International Civil
Airports Assn., an organization of more than 250 major airports
around the world.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Betty; son Steven of
Fountain Valley; two daughters, Kerry Brice of Oakhurst, Calif., and
Dale Norman of Santa Monica; and six grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral service arrangements were pending.</TE>

<HD>Vanessa Ettinger, 56; 'Spider Lady'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL WILLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vanessa Ettinger, who haunted the streets of Laguna Beach for years
as the homeless "Spider Lady" until treatment for schizophrenia led
the former model to a dramatic transformation, has died. She was 56.</LD>
<LD>   For 15 years, the woman was a familiar figure roaming the streets
of the beach-side community, usually draped in black and wearing a
thick mask of mascara that led to her unflattering nickname.</LD>
<LD>   In the early 1990s, Ettinger was one of the first residents of
Laguna Beach's Friendship Shelter. With the help of medication and
the persistence of a county mental health worker, she slowly emerged
from the crippling illness. In 1993, with the help of a brother she
hadn't seen in 21 years, Ettinger was able to move into an apartment
in Dana Point. She was later reunited with one of her daughters in
Vancouver, Canada, thanks in part to Sandy Todd, the mental health
counselor who befriended Ettinger and nursed her to health.</LD>
<TE>   "She was beautiful. She had an artistic flair, and she was always
sweet to everyone," Todd said Tuesday. "She showed that, if we open
up our eyes and our hearts, we can see all people need love no matter
who they are."</TE>
<TE>   Ettinger's health had been deteriorating, and a stroke a few years
ago left her in a wheelchair and in need of constant care. She was a
resident at Laveta Health Care in Orange, and died Sunday night after
being hospitalized with pneumonia, Todd said.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Missouri and raised in Toronto, Ettinger was the daughter
of Donald "Red Dog" Ettinger, who played for the New York Giants from
1948 to 1950.</TE>
<TE>   Although she was known as Vanessa, her name was Abbey, which she
re-adopted in recent years. She was married once and had two
daughters, and in the late 1960s worked as a model and receptionist
at a Kansas City, Mo., advertising agency.</TE>
<TE>   "She was absolutely gorgeous, I mean knockout gorgeous," recalled
the agency's president, Bernie Papin, in a 1994 interview. "She
always looked like she stepped out of a Vogue magazine."</TE>
<TE>   In 1970, feeling depressed and restless, Ettinger hitchhiked
across America on a journey that eventually led to Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Life on the streets was trying, even in affluent Laguna Beach,
Ettinger had said. Still, she said most people were kind to her,
enough to allow her to survive on handouts.</TE>
<TE>   Even during her darkest days on the streets, Ettinger had said she
tried to look her best, and keep up a "model living at a resort"
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   The painted face made her feel more attractive, she said. And more
secure.</TE>

<HD>B. Harkarvy, 71; Teacher of Dance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Benjamin Harkarvy, an internationally renowned choreographer, dance
teacher and company director, has died. He was 71.</LD>
<LD>   Harkarvy, director of the dance division of the Juilliard School
in New York, died of heart failure in a Manhattan hospital on
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   In 1982, The Times called him "one of the world's leading [dance]
pedagogues," and the previous year the Christian Science Monitor had
described him as looking like "the enjoyer he is--of dance, music,
good food and people--a round man with a shaved head, never mistaken
for a dancer, who has taught since the '50s."</LD>
<TE>   The core of his teaching required as much mental as physical
adaptability. "I want my dancers flexible and intelligent," he told
The Times in 1974. "I want them to have minds like sponges which
absorb, absorb, ABSORB."</TE>
<TE>   Harkarvy was born in New York City and studied with major ballet
teachers and at the School of American Ballet, making his debut as a
dancer with the Brooklyn Lyric Opera in the 1949-50 season. He also
danced in summer stock and with various concert groups before
beginning his teaching career at the Fokine School in New York in
1951.</TE>
<TE>   Writing in Dance magazine in 1974, Tobi Tobias described
Harkarvy's teaching as "quietly knowledgeable, with a personal care
and concern for the dancers that never compromises his evidently high
standards."</TE>
<TE>   Harkarvy left Fokine in 1955 to open his own New York school but
soon was appointed director and ballet master of Canada's Royal
Winnipeg Ballet (1957-58). After a one-year stint as ballet master of
the Netherlands Ballet, he founded what would become one of the
world's great companies, Nederlands Dans Theater, in 1959, serving as
its co-artistic director for the next decade and helping give it the
contemporary focus and fusion of ballet and modern dance technique
that it has sustained ever since.</TE>
<TE>   He also choreographed for the company, for the Joffrey Ballet, the
Bat-Dor company of Israel, the Eglevsky Ballet, Les Grands Ballets
Canadiens and the companies he later directed.</TE>
<TE>   "As a choreographer, Mr. Harkarvy is fluent, gifted and
imaginative," dance critic Clive Barnes wrote in the New York Times
in 1973. "His work has more taste than brilliance, yet that very
quality of taste makes it significant in contemporary ballet."</TE>
<TE>   But success in The Hague eventually inspired him to seek new
horizons. "When I knew that [Nederlands Dans Theater] could stand on
their own feet," he told The Times in 1974, "I decided it was time to
move on."</TE>
<TE>   His wanderlust led him to serve as co-artistic director of the New
York-based Harkness Ballet (1969-70), as co-director of the Dutch
National Ballet (1970-71) and as associate director and then artistic
director of the Pennsylvania Ballet from 1972 to 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Forced out during a company financial crisis, he taught and
choreographed for a number of companies before joining the Juilliard
faculty in 1990. He soon brought the school's philosophy in line with
his concept of contemporary dance.</TE>
<TE>   "Juilliard dancers learn to look at dance as dance, not as modern
or ballet," Harkarvy told Dance magazine two years ago. "They
recognize that really great talent has to do with how you move, how
fascinating you are. They are, therefore, I feel, being trained for
the future."</TE>
<TE>   Harkarvy is survived by his brother, Jerome C. Golden, of Merrick,
N.Y.</TE>

<LD>Levi Celerio, 91, a Filipino composer and lyricist who was designated
a Philippine national artist, died Tuesday in Quezon City after a
bout with emphysema.</LD>
<LD>   Celerio gained fame through writing lyrics for more than 4,000
Filipino folk, Christmas and love songs, including many that became
popular movie titles.</LD>
<LD>   He was awarded the title of national artist for music and
literature in 1997 by then-President Fidel Ramos, who cited the
prolific lyricist and composer for writing music "that was a perfect
embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and valued traditions of the
Filipino."</LD>
<TE>   Born in Manila, Celerio began playing violin at age 11 and studied
at the University of the Philippines College of Music. He turned to
songwriting after breaking his wrist in a fall.</TE>
<TE>   Manila newspapers reported that Celerio gained international
recognition for an unusual feat: being able to play music on a leaf.</TE>

<HD>Albert Whitford, 96; Key Player in Astronomy at UC Santa
Cruz</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Albert E. Whitford, astronomer and educator who directed UC's Lick
Observatory and moved its headquarters from Mt. Hamilton to the new
UC Santa Cruz campus in 1966, has died. He was 96.</LD>
<LD>   Whitford, who had returned to his native Wisconsin in 1996, died
March 28 at Meriter Health Center in Madison after a short illness.</LD>
<LD>   Regarded as an expert on photoelectric photometry and structure of
the galaxy, Whitford headed Lick Observatory from 1958 to 1968. There
he oversaw the completion in 1959 of its 120-inch Shane Telescope,
then the second-largest in the world and still considered a highly
productive research instrument.</LD>
<TE>   Whitford and other astronomers who worked at Mt. Hamilton formed
the core of the new Santa Cruz campus' astronomy department. Whitford
taught until 1973 and continued his research until last year.</TE>
<TE>   The researcher and educator was also recognized for his role in
building the national observatory system and leading the growth of
astronomy research in the U.S. He headed a 1953 conference that laid
the groundwork for the national system and in 1964 guided what became
known as the Whitford Report, outlining the first of a series of
10-year plans for astronomy research.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Milton, Wis., Whitford earned a bachelor's degree from its
Milton College and a master's and doctorate in laboratory physics
from the University of Wisconsin. He did post-doctoral research at
Caltech and Mt. Wilson Observatory in the mid-1930s before joining
the faculty of his alma mater.</TE>
<TE>   Whitford worked at the University of Wisconsin from 1936 until
1958, serving the last 10 years as director of its Washburn
Observatory.</TE>
<TE>   Working with that school's Joel Stebbins, Whitford greatly
improved the sensitivity of the photometers they used to measure the
magnitudes and colors of faint stars, clusters and galaxies. His
"Whitford Reddening Curve," which quantifies the interstellar
absorption of light, helped map the distribution of stars in the
Milky Way galaxy. He was also known for his studies of nuclear
bulges, the blobs of stars in a galaxy's center.</TE>
<TE>   Whitford served as president of the American Astronomical Society
from 1967 to 1970.</TE>
<TE>   A widower, he is survived by three children and nine
grandchildren. Services are planned for April 14 in Madison. Memorial
contributions can be sent to Lick Observatory, Office of the
Director, UC Santa Cruz, 1156 High St., Santa Cruz, CA 95064.</TE>

<LD>The defense attorney for accused Yosemite killer Cary Stayner
questioned Wednesday whether Stayner knew he wasn't under arrest
during the hours he was interrogated by the FBI in Sacramento, and
whether coercive tactics were used to elicit a confession.</LD>
<LD>   The effort was part of a hearing on a defense motion to suppress
Stayner's confession to the FBI that he murdered three park
sightseers in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   The confession already has been released to the public, but
Stayner's lawyer is challenging the conduct of the FBI and FBI Agent
Jeffrey Rinek toward Stayner in the hours leading to the 1999
confession. The hearing will continue next week.</LD>

<LD>A murder suspect who hanged herself in a Florida jail left a suicide
note asking her lawyer to sue the jail for failing to prevent her
from killing herself, authorities said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Laren Sims, who was being held in a Hernando County jail awaiting
extradition to California, suggested that any money from the lawsuit
could be used to support her two children.</LD>
<LD>   Sims, 36, was found in her cell Saturday and died a day later. She
was charged in San Joaquin County, Calif., with killing her husband,
Sacramento lawyer Larry McNabney, and burying him in a vineyard.</LD>
<TE>   In her suicide note, Sims said she was not checked regularly in
her cell.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Owen, spokesman for Corrections Corp. of America, the
company that operates the jail, said an internal investigation by the
company found Sims was properly supervised.</TE>

<LD>   Sudden oak death is caused by a microbe that has been found
harmful to more than a dozen plants and trees. It has killed
thousands of oak trees and has spread across 10 coastal counties.</LD>

<HD>Activists Accuse U.S. of Using Fire Prevention Funds to
Benefit Loggers</HD>
<DH>Dispute: The Forest Service denies neglecting undergrowth
around small towns in favor of cutting Sierra forests.</DH>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>An environmental group charges in a report set for release today that
taxpayer money intended to ease the threat of fire in the overgrown
forests of the Sierra Nevada is being used instead by the U.S. Forest
Service to push commercial logging operations on public lands.</LD>
<LD>   The study by the John Muir Project, a nonprofit conservation
group, concludes that fire protection projects on 56,000 acres in the
Sierra have tended to involve logging operations that cut trees deep
in the forest instead of clearing undergrowth around vulnerable
mountain towns.</LD>
<LD>   Chad Hanson, the group's executive director and author of the
report, said the Forest Service "has abused the policy and funding
intent" of the National Fire Plan, the omnibus blueprint approved by
Congress in 2000 to protect rural communities, wildlife and
watersheds from backwoods blazes.</LD>
<TE>   Matt Mathes, a U.S. Forest Service spokesman, denied the
allegations and called the 20-page report "a selective
interpretation" that fails to recognize that commercial timber
cutting in some cases is a tool to help thin the nation's forests,
which have become overgrown after a century of aggressive
firefighting in the rural West.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike the old days, timber production is no longer the driving
force for us," Mathes said. "Protection from fire is now the driving
force."</TE>
<TE>   Timber industry officials, meanwhile, accused the Muir project of
twisting the truth in an era when commercial logging in federal
forests has been reduced more than 90% from a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too bad that propaganda is getting in the way of sound
decision-making based upon sound science," said Chris Nance, a
California Forestry Assn. spokesman. "Science is driving this
process, not whether the trees are marketable."</TE>
<TE>   The timber industry and environmentalists have long fought over
whether fire prevention efforts are used to mask attempts to boost
commercial logging.</TE>
<TE>   Using Forest Service documents, Hanson determined that 83% of the
new projects funded under the National Fire Plan involve commercial
logging and none focus near towns to remove flammable undergrowth,
which provides a fuel ladder that fire can climb to reach treetops
and rage out of control.</TE>
<TE>   The average distance to the nearest town is six or seven miles,
the report said. In some cases, it said, outhouses or back-country
camps were defined as urban areas to justify cutting trees.</TE>
<TE>   The study said 75% of the projects involve removing trees in
excess of 12 inches in diameter, and 94% are in mature or old-growth
forest suitable for threatened species such as the California spotted
owl or the Pacific fisher, a weasel-like creature. In addition, the
study said, many trees slated for removal are not dead but are being
eyed because they represent potential sources of commercial lumber.</TE>
<TE>   While the National Fire Plan envisioned reducing flammable
undergrowth near homes, the study concluded, "the Forest Service has
overwhelmingly spent these funds on big commercial logging projects."</TE>
<TE>   Mathes of the Forest Service said the process of how best to fix
the forest is being driven by "the best current science."</TE>
<TE>   He said the Muir report fails to account for a key factor--that 14
of 16 projects cited are in the Lassen and Plumas national forests,
which are covered by a separate set of rules signed into law in 1998
by President Bill Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Those rules, though controversial among environmentalists, allow
far-flung thinning operations deep in the forest as a way to knock
down a fire before it approaches a community.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Mathes said, Congress allowed U.S. Forest Service
officials to use National Fire Plan funding for commercial timber
cutting within fuel reduction project sites.</TE>

<HD>Sierra Snowpack at 76% of Normal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is bad news and good news flowing from the rugged, snow-capped
peaks of the eastern Sierra, the most important source of water for
3.8 million customers in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   With relatively light snowfall during the past winter, runoff is
expected to be just 76% of normal, according to experts at the Los
Angeles Department of Water and Power.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the subpar flow, DWP officials say there will be adequate
water supplies to meet customer demands in the coming year. But
they're urging prudence while opening the tap.</LD>
<TE>   "We had two months of unseasonably dry, warm weather this past
winter that sent the snowpack to below-normal levels," said Gerald A.
Gewe, the department's assistant general manager for water. He hopes
Angelenos will "continue to use water wisely" by conserving whenever
possible.</TE>
<TE>   That means saving water in simple ways, like turning off faucets
when shaving or brushing teeth and making sure landscape water is
going to plants, not running into the gutter.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, installation of low-flush toilets can dramatically
cut water use. Over the last decade, DWP has invested more than $100
million on conservation programs, including financial incentives for
installing ultra low-flush toilets and water-efficient washing
machines.</TE>
<TE>   Conserving water not only saves money but can also help the
environment. A big part of every gallon eventually reaches a sewer or
drainage culvert, cascading onward to the sea--and carrying along
fertilizers, pesticides and oil picked up along the way.</TE>
<TE>   Half the city's water comes from eastern Sierra runoff, which
flows into the Owens Valley and then cascades south via the Los
Angeles Aqueduct. The rest is a mix of local ground water and
deliveries from the Colorado River and Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   Each winter, DWP hydrographic crews cull the data needed for
forecasting runoff. They measure the snow's depth in various spots,
calculate the water content, then predict how much water Los Angeles
can expect.</TE>

<KH>SURROUNDINGS / HOBART YARD</KH>
<HD>It Ain't Pretty, but It Delivers the Goods</HD>
<DH>Rail hub is a teeming labyrinth where--24 hours a
day--freight trains and trucks transfer products.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For clutter, for noise, for sheer nonstop action deep in the guts of
industrial Southern California, few places come close to massive
Hobart Yard.</LD>
<LD>   A rail hub since long before the Wright brothers flew, Hobart has
grown only more crowded and forbidding with the rise of Pacific Rim
trade. The yard is two miles long, and if there is a single blade of
grass, it is doomed to be crushed by wheels or poisoned by diesel
fumes. Even the asphalt has a hard time of it: patched, rutted,
crisscrossed with painted-over lines.</LD>
<LD>   Yellow concrete barriers known as K-rails form makeshift pathways
for trucks that snort and rumble in a dance that goes on 24 hours a
day. Trains also come and go around the clock--on average, every 52
minutes. At night they drone in under the pale glow of
rickety-looking light towers.</LD>
<TE>   No passengers ride these mile-long trains, except when an
occasional hobo finds a way to bed down under the overhang of a cargo
container. The single- and double-stack trains are strictly for
commodities: enough computers, clocks, bicycles, jeans, ovens, grain,
soap and chemicals to supply whole cities.</TE>
<TE>   "We simply move millions of tons of freight every day--that's all
we do," said Chuck Potempa, director of facilities operation for the
Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway, which operates the yard in
Los Angeles, Vernon and the City of Commerce. "People fail to ask the
question: 'How does my stuff get from China to Wal-Mart?' This is how
it happens."</TE>
<TE>   Hobart is a billion-dollar locus in a global network of steamship
lines, railways and big-rig trucks. According to Potempa, this is the
busiest yard ever created for transferring train cargo to trucks, and
vice versa. A slightly smaller yard, owned by Union Pacific Railroad,
operates across the street.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the freight arrives at the ports of Long Beach and Los
Angeles, travels by freeway to Hobart, then is sent by rail to points
east, including East Coast ports that will ferry it to Europe. Other
freight leaves Eastern and Midwestern depots and flows into Hobart,
where trucks collect it and carry it to local stores and warehouses.</TE>
<TE>   Like plumbing, Hobart is unvarnished and purely functional. Most
people see it only while driving past on the Long Beach Freeway, just
south of the Santa Ana Freeway. The yard extends to the west in a
seemingly endless landscape of rails and big-rig containers.</TE>
<TE>   Inside its guarded gates, Hobart is a surreal world. Potempa
compares it to an aircraft carrier--huge, flat, complicated,
dangerous. Things happen for which there is no explanation.</TE>
<TE>   A switchman walking the tracks a couple of years ago looked down
and discovered a hand grenade. No one could figure out where it came
from or why. The bomb squad whisked it away.</TE>
<TE>   Fires erupt. Intruders have to be run off. Beehives have to be
destroyed. Not long ago a police chase interrupted business at 2 in
the morning--bad luck for a fugitive thinking he could find his way
back out of the labyrinth.</TE>
<TE>   The physical scale is staggering. In one area stand enormous steel
racks, like ski racks outside a winter lodge. Leaning against them
are hundreds of entire big-rig chassis--the wheels and undercarriages
after the metal containers are removed.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 18,000 chassis, some as long as 53 feet, can be stored
at a time. Each is lifted and placed on end by an oversized,
forklift-like truck with huge clamping arms.</TE>
<TE>   Major shipping companies not only own their own ships but the
containers and truck chassis as well. They contract with the railways
and trucking companies to move those containers over land.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the complexities of operating this facility is we have to
have several chassis pools," Potempa said. "So a Maersk container
ends up on a Maersk chassis, a Yang Ming [container] ends up on a
Yang Ming chassis, a Hanjin ends up on a Hanjin chassis."</TE>
<TE>   The dawn of the container era, in the 1980s, along with the
extraordinary growth of trade at Pacific ports has created traffic
through Hobart that was unimaginable a few years ago, Potempa said.
Cargo volume is measured in "lifts," the number of times a container
or trailer is lifted onto or off of a train. In 2000 alone, the yard
logged more than 1 million lifts.</TE>
<TE>   "In '95, if you'd have [predicted that], you'd have been laughed
off the property," Potempa said.</TE>
<TE>   Lifting is done mainly by 40-foot-tall, mobile, bow-legged cranes
that can straddle the tracks. Outbound containers are lined up beside
a train of flatcars and a crane passes over them, methodically
lifting each container, shifting it into position and dropping it
gently on the rail car. Workers secure each container in place and
double- and triple-check its destination.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping track of everything is the trickiest part of running the
yard. A single train can carry up to 220 containers, and the yard, at
busy peaks, may end up with as many as seven trains at various stages
of being loaded or unloaded.</TE>
<TE>   Containers and trailers are constantly being moved around by
miniature rigs called hostlers. Some containers have to be moved to
the tracks for shipment; others have to be shuttled to parking lots,
where they are picked up and hauled away by larger rigs. On a single
day this year, a record 4,200 containers and trailers were scattered
around the yard.</TE>
<TE>   Computers try to follow their movements. In every crane and
hostler is a terminal. Numbers are logged in. Three "lot checkers" do
nothing but drive around in pickup trucks, keying in container and
parking-space numbers. The information--constantly updated in real
time--is not quite enough, so crews also rely on a more archaic
technology: They scrawl shorthand notations on the sides of the
containers in yellow chalk. Two measly letters--KC--may ensure that
an outbound container reaches Kansas City even if someone misreads a
screen.</TE>
<TE>   Error rates are minuscule. A container winds up in the wrong city
about one time in 80,000, Potempa said.</TE>
<TE>   A different sort of monitoring is designed to keep the yard from
becoming jammed up with too many trains. A train master in a
three-story control tower watches computer diagrams of trains rolling
throughout the West. As many as 21 trains have been headed west
toward Hobart in a 24-hour period.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to gauge your westbounds and make decisions on whether
to hold trains west of Barstow or east of Barstow," said Van Stewart,
a terminal manager who supervises the train masters. Delays and even
derailments can throw schedules into disarray, one reason the train
masters hold planning meetings every three to four hours, around the
clock.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're not properly planning, what you have is chaos," Stewart
said. "It can become helter-skelter out there."</TE>

<HD>911 Tape of Calls on Dog Attack Released</HD>
<DH>Mauling: The recording, deemed inadmissible at the owners'
trial, reveals a neighbor's frantic state as she reported that 'We
have two dogs rampaging out in the hall.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A neighbor frantically called police twice as Diane Whipple was being
fatally mauled by a dog outside her apartment door, a newly released
tape of 911 calls shows.</LD>
<LD>   The 10-minute tape was not used in the trial of dog owners
Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel, who were convicted last month. The
neighbor testified, but the tape, released by police Tuesday, was
deemed inadmissible hearsay.</LD>
<LD>   The recording begins with Esther Birkmaier's first call Jan. 26,
2001, about seven minutes after two giant Presa Canario dogs, Bane
and Hera, began attacking Whipple, a 33-year-old lacrosse coach.</LD>
<TE>   "Yes, I'm just a wreck," the 75-year-old woman said. "Please send
police.... We have two dogs rampaging out in the hall up on the sixth
floor and I think they have--their--even their owner cannot control
them. They are huge."</TE>
<TE>   "OK, the owner knows that the dogs are in the hallway?" the
dispatcher asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're attacking the owner, too, I reckon--she's
screaming right now, and I don't dare open the door 'cause the dogs
are huge.</TE>
<TE>   "Please hurry!" she continued. "I hear her screaming and I don't
dare open the door. These dogs are ferocious."</TE>
<TE>   The dispatcher then reports not an attack but that the dogs are
out of control.</TE>
<TE>   A second 911 call was made by David Kuenzi, a New Yorker who was
staying with a friend in the building. He said he heard a woman
screaming and a dog barking and said he was going to go see what was
happening.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't go up there because you never know what you might get
into," the dispatcher said, and promised help was on the way.</TE>
<TE>   Still, police had not arrived. Birkmaier called 911 again.</TE>
<TE>   "I called five minutes ago; we have two ferocious dogs on the
loose," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "So you've already called us?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes."</TE>
<TE>   "We're on our way, ma'am, you just have to be patient. You only
called five minutes ago."</TE>
<TE>   Less than a minute later, the first two officers arrived and
called for an ambulance and animal control. Whipple was found
bleeding in the hall and died that night.</TE>
<TE>   Sentencing of the dogs' owners is set for May 10. Knoller, who was
with the dogs during the attack, could get 15 years to life for
second-degree murder. She and her husband, who was not home during
the attack, could get four years in prison on the other charges,
including manslaughter and keeping a dog that killed someone.</TE>
<TE>   The defense said the attack couldn't have been foreseen, but
prosecutors said the couple had ignored repeated warnings.</TE>

<HD>State Teen Birth Rate Drops Nearly One-Third in Decade</HD>
<DH>Pregnancy: Figure mirrors a national trend of youths having
less sex, using more contraceptives, health officials say. Latina
rate remains high.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA RIVERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The rate of teenagers giving birth in California dropped 4.2% from
1999 to 2000 and 31.3% during the last decade, mirroring a national
trend of teenagers having less sex and using more contraceptives,
health officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   California's 2000 rate of 48.1 births per 1,000 girls ages 15 to
19 was one of the lowest levels in decades and was below the U.S.
average of 48.7 births in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, decreases were recorded among every ethnic group
surveyed, particularly African American girls, whose birth rate
dropped to 59.9 births per 1,000 in 2000 from 63 in 1999. But the
rate among Latina teenagers, though down, remains stubbornly high,
topping 90 per 1,000.</LD>
<TE>   There were 56,268 births to California mothers under the age of 20
in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, however, "this good news demonstrates that California's
prevention programs and initiatives work," said Gov. Gray Davis, who
announced the numbers as part of the state's National Public Health
Awareness Week events in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Children's advocates also hailed the numbers, which they called in
line with their research.</TE>
<TE>   "The research shows both a delay in the onset of sexual activity
as well as greater use of contraceptives if they are engaged in sex,"
said Amy Dominguez-Arms, vice president of the nonprofit Children
Now.</TE>
<TE>   Teenagers seem to be listening to messages about abstinence but
also appear to fear contracting sexually transmitted diseases,
especially AIDS, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But the positive overall trend masked several worrisome indicators
that state education campaigns are not reaching all teenagers who
engage in risky behavior, Dominguez-Arms said. For all of its
improvement, California still ranks 39th in the country in teenage
birth rates, and at least 22 other nations have lower rates.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the birth rate among Latina teenagers in California is
comparable to rates in economically disadvantaged countries.</TE>
<TE>   "That number is very significant," said Anna Ramirez, chief of
California's Office of Family Planning.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's cultural, but reflects the economic situation
of a lot of young Latina girls growing up in California and how they
feel about themselves and the image they have of themselves," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Research suggests that girls who have fewer economic advantages
tend to have lower self-esteem and a more fractured family life and
to give birth at younger ages.</TE>
<TE>   Also, although the state spends more than $25 million a year on
prevention programs, young girls and boys of all ethnicities are
bombarded with messages in advertising, movies and music about how to
be sexual, but few messages about how to attain constructive goals
and feel good about themselves, Ramirez said.</TE>

<HD>Davis' Problem: Attack Ads Offer High Reward but Carry High
Risk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis faces a painful dilemma and you can't blame him if
he's flinching. He needs to smack rival Bill Simon on TV with
damaging attack ads. But when he does, the blows likely will carom
back at him.</LD>
<LD>   "Just being a great big thug is not necessarily the way to get
reelected," says Republican analyst Tony Quinn. "Davis' problem is
people don't like him."</LD>
<LD>   Problem No. 2 is that people will like Davis even less when he
starts attacking Simon in TV ads. A candidate's shelling of an
opponent often ricochets back on himself.</LD>
<TE>   A classic example was the 1998 "murder-suicide"--a
characterization coined by Davis strategist Garry South--when
gubernatorial aspirant Al Checchi destroyed both his and Rep. Jane
Harman's candidacies with relentless attack ads.</TE>
<TE>   Darry Sragow, a former Checchi advisor, notes that Davis "can't
afford to have Bill Simon paint a flattering picture of himself for
very long. But on the other hand, when you attack an opponent, you
almost invariably pay a price."</TE>
<TE>   "While attack ads done right can be very effective, voters tell us
in focus groups they don't like negative campaigning. Negative ads
are a turnoff, but the fact is they work."</TE>
<TE>   The latest example was the Democratic governor's $9-million ad
assault in the Republican gubernatorial primary that fatally wounded
Richard Riordan, the Republican feared most by Davis.</TE>
<TE>   But the governor did pay a price: He could have spent those
millions touting the Davis record and boosted his popularity, but
opted to ruin Riordan instead.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, Davis' job rating among registered voters near the
end of the primary was an ambivalent 47% approval and 47%
disapproval, according to the Times Poll. That's slightly worse than
it was when the governor began running the attack ads, although a bit
better than last June at the height of the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Among primary voters on election day, according to a Times exit
poll, Davis' job rating was a dismal 41% approval, 59% disapproval.</TE>
<TE>   South explained Davis' strategy at a recent conference in San
Diego of the American Assn. of Political Consultants.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a calculation," South told his fellow gurus, "but our view
was that we were not going to substantially improve the governor's
numbers over the course of a two-month primary campaign by putting on
purely positive [TV] spots talking about him and his record ....</TE>
<TE>   "The real imperative ... was to make sure [Riordan] did not walk
through the primary and have a substantial lead on us when it was
over."</TE>
<TE>   South added, in a comment reflecting his and Davis' bare-knuckles
approach to politics, that Riordan should have been prepared for the
assault because the former L.A. mayor "had been warned for months we
were not going to allow him to bang on the governor without some kind
of response ....</TE>
<TE>   "To think that was an idle threat, or our team was so namby-pamby
we wouldn't carry through, or the governor was such a wimpy
politician he wouldn't hesitate to attack an opponent is something
they should have understood from the history of this campaign team."</TE>
<TE>   Davis also told Times staffers last week: "A candidate cannot just
sit back and allow someone else to misrepresent their record ....
People are likely to believe what they hear unless there is some
refutation."</TE>
<TE>   As for voters not liking him, the governor said: "I mean, I'm not
asking people to marry me. I'm asking them to make a decision as to
who do they want to govern this state."</TE>
<TE>   These hardball attitudes are why many politicos expected Davis to
start belting Simon on TV the day after the primary--pounding him for
his right-wing positions against abortion rights and gun control.</TE>
<TE>   "Never had any such plans," South insists. "Didn't even have spots
in the can. That was all hype and mythology."</TE>
<TE>   When will the aerial bombardment begin? "Our strategy is set. We
know what we're going to do. But that's proprietary. We're not going
to give away our recipe for the secret sauce."</TE>
<TE>   Davis probably is flinching. But he also has other reasons for not
yet buying TV ads, positive or negative.</TE>
<TE>   It's seven months until November. TV spots are very
expensive--roughly $2 million per week statewide--and even a governor
with $30 million in campaign cash must be prudent.</TE>
<TE>   He also needs to be prudent with an inattentive public's patience.
"We'd wear out our welcome with voters," South concedes.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, people's attention right now is turned toward possible
all-out war in the Middle East, plus terrorism and a shaky economy.</TE>
<TE>   "People are jumpy," says Davis pollster Paul Maslin. "If this
thing gets worse, it's going to have a big impact on the November
elections. In what way, we don't know yet."</TE>
<TE>   It's a prudent time to flinch. Hunker down and govern--a proven
way to boost that job rating.</TE>

<HD>Inland Empire Politician Faces New Charges</HD>
<DH>Crime: San Bernardino County supervisor, once indicted for
fraud, now accused of bribery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors filed a new round of charges Wednesday against San
Bernardino County Supervisor Jerry Eaves, one of the most powerful
and enduring politicians in the Inland Empire, accusing him of
participating in a bribery scheme.</LD>
<LD>   The charges mark another step in a corruption scandal that has
rocked the halls of power in San Bernardino County for several years.</LD>
<LD>   In a 37-page, 58-count indictment, the U.S. attorney's office
charged that Eaves and W. Shepardson "Shep" McCook, an Orange County
businessman, concocted a scheme that led to the construction of giant
billboards at the intersection of the 10 and 215 freeways.</LD>
<TE>   Eaves, 62, was already charged in a separate federal indictment
with six counts of fraud, allegedly for depriving the public of its
right to his honest services as a politician. The new indictment
includes those charges and adds a series of new ones, primarily
allegations that he used "interstate wires"--telephones--to commit
bribery, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Andrew Cowan.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment also charges McCook, 55, with eight counts of using
mail or telephones to commit bribery, seven counts of wire fraud and
31 counts of money laundering.</TE>
<TE>   Four people are listed in the indictment as "co-conspirators" but
are not charged. They are: Allan Steward, 55, a Laguna Beach
commercial real estate developer; Abe Beltran, 69, a former member of
the Colton City Council; Donald Sanders, 44, another former city
councilman in Colton; and James Hlawek, 55, the former administrative
officer in San Bernardino County.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the four previously pleaded guilty to federal bribery
charges. The men are scheduled to be sentenced in June.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's indictment contends that McCook bribed public
officials to gain approval for the construction of billboards, and
then shared some of his $4.4 million in profit with government
officials and businessmen.</TE>
<TE>   The plan, prosecutors allege, began in 1992. According to the
indictment, McCook gave Eaves, Eaves' relatives and Eaves' aides
vacations at the Stardust Hotel in Las Vegas. Eaves failed to
disclose the gifts when he filed financial statements with the
California Fair Political Practices Commission, the indictment
charges.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, Eaves voted in favor of leasing San Bernardino
County property to one of McCook's companies. Then, in 1997, Eaves
voted for a proposal that allowed the Oakridge Corp., another McCook
company, to sell five billboards for $4.4 million, prosecutors say.</TE>
<TE>   McCook had been charged in a previous indictment as well, but in
January a federal judge dismissed the case against him, questioning
whether the federal government had jurisdiction over what began as a
local law enforcement case.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, McCook's Santa Ana attorney, James Riddet, said that
federal prosecutors filed the new charges against McCook in
retaliation for the dismissal of the initial charges.</TE>
<TE>   "The government tried one theory for prosecuting this case in
federal court and was thrown out," Riddet said. "Despite that, the
government has elected to file again in federal court. We will defend
the new action vigorously."</TE>
<TE>   The indictment is another blow to Eaves, a former Rialto mayor and
state assemblyman who has long been the only Democrat on the San
Bernardino County Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Eaves pleaded no contest to separate charges of official
misconduct, including allegations that he failed to disclose free
trips to a Canadian fishing lodge. Through that plea agreement, Eaves
was ordered to pay a $20,000 fine and spend three years on probation.
He was allowed to keep his seat on the Board of Supervisors but
agreed not to run for office when his term expires in December
2004--his 26th year in public office.</TE>
<TE>   The charges against Eaves are loosely related to a corruption
scandal that has plagued San Bernardino County.</TE>
<TE>   An investigation led seven former county officials and business
executives to enter guilty pleas in 1999, and the county has since
filed a series of lawsuits in an attempt to recover funds taxpayers
lost through several bribery and kickback schemes.</TE>
<TE>   The county has reached settlements worth millions of dollars with
numerous companies that did business there, and has launched a
campaign to improve the county's image among angry residents.</TE>
<TE>   Eaves could not be reached for comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   His supporters say the criminal cases against him can be
attributed to two things--politics and paperwork problems--and are
hardly of the same caliber as the criminal cases marking the
corruption scandal's other tentacles.</TE>
<TE>   Their claims that Eaves is the victim of a political crusade
seemed to be bolstered last summer when court documents showed that
San Bernardino County Dist. Atty. Dennis Stout and two lieutenants
secretly helped the candidate challenging Eaves for a position on the
Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   The documents showed that Stout's aides encouraged candidate Ed
Scott, Eaves' opponent, to find a "marginally honest" private
investigator who would research Eaves' campaign finance reports.</TE>
<TE>   Stout and Scott are Republicans. Stout was prosecuting Eaves while
he was assisting Eaves' political opponent, and he was later forced
to acknowledge that he "let the public down."</TE>
<TE>   Stout recently decided not to run for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   The charges against Eaves "pale by comparison" to the other pieces
of the bribery and kickback scandal, said Eaves' attorney, Don
Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Tina Dirmann contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>A Sewage Plume Comeback?</HD>
<DH>Environment: Partially treated waste dumped 4 miles off
Huntington Beach could have played a role in '99 beach closures, a
study finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new study says the massive plume of partially treated sewage piped
off the coast of Huntington Beach could have contributed to the
extended closure of a miles-long stretch of the city's shoreline in
1999 and might be causing continued high bacterial counts in that
area.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Sanitation District, which has a federal waiver
allowing it to dump the partly treated sewage four miles offshore,
has long said the polluted plume does not come on shore. The joint
study by UC Irvine and Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La
Jolla says evidence indicates otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   It could provide ammunition to environmentalists who oppose an
extension of the waiver, which expires next year.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't have a smoking gun here--we can't say we have seen a
time when [the sewage] has reached the beach," said Clinton D.
Winant, a study co-author and a professor of oceanography at Scripps.
"But it would also be wrong to say the [sewage] can't reach the
beach."</TE>
<TE>   The study, though independent of the sanitation district, was
based on the agency's data and was published on the Web site of the
American Chemical Society's Environmental Science &amp; Technology
journal this week. It will be published in the journal in May.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have been studying high bacteria counts at Huntington
Beach since the summer of 1999, when county health officials closed
miles of shoreline for more than a month. The cause of the closure
during the city's peak tourist season has never been determined.
Every summer since, bacteria counts have spiked at the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous theories have been put forth. Most recently, research has
focused on the sewage plume, piped out at a rate of 243 million
gallons a day.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, the sanitation district's own evidence cries for
[higher] treatment," said Assemblyman Ken Maddox (R-Garden Grove),
who has sponsored a bill that would kill the waiver.</TE>
<TE>   The study discredits a theory that sewer officials here and around
the nation have long relied upon--that the sewage discharged into the
ocean is trapped in cold water far offshore, and that the cold water
in turn is trapped by a warmer layer of water on top of it. The study
finds that underwater waves can push the cold water to the
beach--especially during late spring, the summer and early fall, when
beaches are busiest.</TE>
<TE>   "We now know that that warm layer is not a permanent fixture and
that colder waters can sometimes rise and come all the way up to the
beach," Winant said. "Since sewage ends up in the cold water, there's
a chance that it could come to the beach as well."</TE>
<TE>   Winant suggested that during the summer, if the water is cold,
parents might want to reconsider letting their children play in it.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people don't worry about this, and I haven't until now," he
said. "Now maybe I will."</TE>
<TE>   Sanitation district spokeswoman Lisa Murphy said Wednesday that
the district analyzed the same data and in September 2001 concluded
that it provided little evidence that the cold water had moved
onshore. She added that the closest the plume has been found to the
beach is a half-mile offshore, 45 feet underwater.</TE>
<TE>   Winant, who wrote the study with UCI professors Alexandria B.
Boehm and Brett F. Sanders, said the project shows that more research
is needed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a scientist--let's do more studies," he joked.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to understand what happens in the ocean environment in a
comprehensive way," he said. "We're dumping all this stuff into the
ocean, and we really don't understand what's going on in that box out
there."</TE>
<TE>   The study was praised by Stanley Grant, a UCI professor who first
theorized that the plume could be causing high bacteria counts at the
beach. He was not affiliated with the study, but he has reviewed it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very solid piece of work," he said. "It certainly
demonstrates that material can move across the [ocean] by internal
tides, which is a very important ingredient to this idea that the
plume can move ... into the surf zone."</TE>
<TE>   But Grant suggested that research is needed to determine whether
the AES power plant in Huntington Beach plays a role. The plant's
cooling system pulls in ocean water, he said, and could be drawing
the plume back to shore.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists and other waiver opponents say the study is the
latest evidence that the waiver should be eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   The sanitation district is the largest of 36 agencies nationwide
to have waivers allowing them to dump sewage that has not all
received secondary treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's beyond possible" that the sewage reaches the beach, said Tod
W. Ridgeway, Newport Beach mayor and a member of the district board.
"It's probable.</TE>
<TE>   "Under all circumstances, we oppose the granting of the waiver,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Board member John M. Gullixson said he is awaiting the results of
a $5.1-million study the district conducted last year to see if the
plume was coming onshore. He noted that the district is about to
begin chlorinating the plume to reduce the amount of disease-causing
microorganisms.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just continuing to gather the information," said Gullixson,
also a Yorba Linda councilman. "I'm still not convinced one way or
the other."</TE>

<LD>Despite findings by an independent arbitrator that two officers who
were fired after the shooting death of Tyisha Miller should be
reinstated, Riverside city officials filed a motion in court this
week to keep Michael Alagna and Wayne Stewart off the force.</LD>
<LD>   Alagna and Stewart were fired after they fatally shot 19-year-old
Miller as she sat passed out in her car with a gun resting in her
lap.</LD>
<LD>   Then-Chief Gerald Carroll said the officers violated policy when
they formed "an unreasonably dangerous plan" to smash the car window
to rouse Miller. She jumped, prompting the officers to fire.</LD>

<HD>Hazardous Waste Storage Firm to Remain Open</HD>
<DH>Environment: State backs away from trying to shut down
Denova, as long as the Rialto facility meets terms of agreement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Rialto facility that stores hazardous waste and has a history of
environmental violations will be allowed to remain open under new
management and in a limited capacity, state and company officials
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The company, Denova Environmental Inc., will be allowed to
continue receiving certain kinds of explosive waste, once it meets
terms of a settlement with the California Department of Toxic
Substances Control.</LD>
<LD>   The state has backed away from earlier moves to shut down the
facility and fine its operators $2.5 million. Denova will be allowed
to appeal to the state to reduce the fine substantially, said
Denova's Newport Beach attorney, Charles Whisonant.</LD>
<TE>   The agreement also calls for Denova to remove all hazardous waste
from its 20-acre site in northern Rialto, Whisonant said. Once that
happens--it's unclear how long it will take--the company will be
allowed to store up to 2,000 pounds of explosive waste such as old
munitions.</TE>
<TE>   However, Denova is in negotiations to sell its operations to
another company, Whisonant said. The new company, which Whisonant
would not name, will likely apply for a permit to store thousands
more pounds of explosive waste at the site than the agreement
permits, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Employees will be required to undergo additional training for
handling waste under the settlement. Acting Denova President Robert
Cole will also be prohibited from maintaining a management role in
the company, said Jeanne Garcia, a spokeswoman for the California
Department of Toxic Substances Control.</TE>
<TE>   Denova has a long history of environmental violations.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, canisters of chemicals and hazardous waste stored there
ignited, causing a brief fire and sending firefighters scurrying to
develop contingency plans for evacuating a large portion of the city.
Concerned that removing containers filled with waste could cause
deadly explosions, firefighters called in the FBI and a local bomb
squad to blow them up on site.</TE>
<TE>   Denova is the last nongovernmental organization in California
licensed to handle many types of explosive waste.</TE>
<TE>   After the state suspended its operating license last year, the
company argued that government contractors and law enforcement
agencies counting on it to store their explosive waste would have to
ship it out of state if Denova were forced to close. That would have
increased the number of waste shipments traversing the state, and
could be dangerous and expensive, the company maintained.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a need for this type of operation in California,"
Whisonant said. "Without the type of services that Denova provided,
you are talking about shipping a lot of small quantities of small
explosives at great expense."</TE>
<TE>   This week, the state concluded that Denova, despite its troubled
past, performs a service for Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "They do provide a valuable and important service out there,"
Garcia said. "We felt that as long as they comply with all the
requirements, we will work with them. This is not a blanket approval.
They need to follow the requirements."</TE>
<TE>   Environmental activists called the agreement predictable.</TE>
<TE>   Many companies whose business involves the handling or storage of
toxic or industrial waste have moved to the Inland Empire in recent
years--partly because land is far more available than in coastal
areas, but also, activists say, because environmental oversight is
less stringent in the region.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like Stringfellow all over again," said Jeff Morgan, vice
chairman of an Inland Empire Sierra Club group, referring to a
notorious toxic dump near Riverside that was once a receptacle for 35
million gallons of industrial chemicals. "Just because this is the
Inland Empire doesn't mean it's not important that these things
should be monitored."</TE>

<HD>Inland Empire Politician Now Facing More Charges</HD>
<DH>Crime: San Bernardino County supervisor is accused of
bribery in a billboard scheme with an O.C. businessman.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors filed a new round of charges Wednesday against San
Bernardino County Supervisor Jerry Eaves, one of the most powerful
and enduring politicians in the Inland Empire, accusing him of
participating in a bribery scheme.</LD>
<LD>   The charges mark another step in a corruption scandal that has
rocked the halls of power in San Bernardino County for several years.</LD>
<LD>   In a 37-page, 58-count indictment, the U.S. attorney's office
charged that Eaves and W. Shepardson "Shep" McCook, an Orange County
businessman, concocted a scheme that led to the construction of giant
billboards at the intersection of the 10 and 215 freeways.</LD>
<TE>   Eaves, 62, was already charged in a separate federal indictment
with six counts of fraud, allegedly for depriving the public of its
right to his honest services as a politician. The new indictment
includes those charges and adds a series of new ones, primarily
allegations that he used "interstate wires"--telephones--to commit
bribery, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Andrew Cowan.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment also charges McCook, 55, with eight counts of using
mail or telephones to commit bribery, seven counts of wire fraud and
31 counts of money laundering.</TE>
<TE>   Four people are listed in the indictment as "co-conspirators" but
are not charged. They are: Allan Steward, 55, a Laguna Beach
commercial real estate developer; Abe Beltran, 69, a former member of
the Colton City Council; Donald Sanders, 44, another former city
councilman in Colton; and James Hlawek, 55, former administrative
officer in San Bernardino County.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the four previously pleaded guilty to federal bribery
charges. The men are scheduled to be sentenced in June.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's indictment contends that McCook bribed public
officials to gain approval for the construction of billboards, and
then shared some of his $4.4 million in profit with government
officials and businessmen.</TE>
<TE>   The plan, prosecutors allege, began in 1992. According to the
indictment, McCook gave Eaves, Eaves' relatives and Eaves' aides
vacations at the Stardust Hotel in Las Vegas. Eaves failed to
disclose the gifts when he filed financial statements with the
California Fair Political Practices Commission, the indictment
charges.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, Eaves voted in favor of leasing San Bernardino
County property to one of McCook's companies. Then, in 1997, Eaves
voted for a proposal that allowed the Oakridge Corp., another McCook
company, to sell five billboards for $4.4 million, prosecutors say.</TE>
<TE>   McCook had been charged in a previous indictment as well, but in
January a federal judge dismissed the case against him, questioning
whether the federal government had jurisdiction over what began as a
local law enforcement case.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, McCook's Santa Ana attorney, James Riddet, said that
federal prosecutors filed the new charges against McCook in
retaliation. "The government tried one theory for prosecuting this
case in federal court and was thrown out," he said. "Despite that,
the government has elected to file again in federal court. We will
defend the new action vigorously."</TE>
<TE>   The indictment is another blow to Eaves, a former Rialto mayor and
state assemblyman who has long been the only Democrat on the San
Bernardino County Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Eaves pleaded no contest to separate charges of official
misconduct, including allegations that he failed to disclose free
trips to a Canadian fishing lodge. Eaves was ordered to pay a $20,000
fine and spend three years on probation. He was allowed to keep his
seat on the Board of Supervisors but agreed not to run for office
when his term expires in December 2004--his 26th year in office.</TE>
<TE>   The charges against Eaves are loosely related to a corruption
scandal that has plagued San Bernardino County. An investigation led
seven former county officials and business executives to enter guilty
pleas in 1999, and the county has since filed a series of lawsuits in
an attempt to recover funds.</TE>
<TE>   Eaves could not be reached for comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   His supporters say the criminal cases against him can be
attributed to politics and paperwork problems and are hardly of the
same caliber as the criminal cases marking the corruption scandal's
other tentacles.</TE>

<HD>Yankees' Wells Gets Past Jitters, Orioles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The schedule said it was the second game of a long, 162-game season.
To David Wells, it was much more.</LD>
<LD>   For Wells, it was the first game of his reborn baseball career.</LD>
<LD>   "I was nervous all day," he said. "This was my first start since
[June], and it was a big night for me--being back with the team I've
always loved."</LD>
<TE>   Wells ultimately fought off the uncharacteristic case of jitters,
pitching marvelously into the eighth inning as the New York Yankees
beat the Baltimore Orioles, 1-0, Wednesday night at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Robin Ventura homered over the right-field wall in the seventh
inning against Jason Johnson to break up an outstanding pitching
duel.</TE>
<TE>   Signed by New York as a free agent in January, Wells (1-0) looked
every bit as good as he did during his first stint with the Yankees,
when he had a 34-14 record in 1997-98 and pitched a perfect game.</TE>
<TE>   The left-hander gave up four hits, walked one and struck out one
in 71/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   It was Wells' first start since June, when he cut short a
disappointing 5-7 season with the Chicago White Sox to undergo back
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "Since 8 this morning, when I woke up, I've been climbing the
walls. I was really antsy today," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After being hitless in New York's 10-3 loss to Baltimore on
opening day, Ventura walked and singled before driving an 0-1 pitch
over the right-field scoreboard in the seventh inning.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an off-speed pitch that he left up a little bit," Ventura
said. "I think the wind kind of helped it a bit. The ball was
hooking, and it brought it back to the line."</TE>
<TE>   Obtained in a trade with the New York Mets for David Justice,
Ventura has 16 career homers against the Orioles, most against any
major league team except Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore failed to put a runner in scoring position through the
first six innings, wasting leadoff singles by Jay Gibbons, Singleton
and Melvin Mora in the third, fourth and fifth innings.</TE>
<TE>   "David Wells is a very good pitcher. He pitches in probably as
good as anyone in the league," Oriole Manager Mike Hargrove said. "He
changed speeds well tonight, too, and really kept us off balance."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson (0-1) gave up six hits in 72/3 innings, walking one and
striking out six. He has lost seven consecutive decisions since July
7.</TE>
<TE>   "We pitched well enough, we played defense well enough, we hit the
ball hard enough," Hargrove said.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 2, Detroit 1--Randy Winn ended an 0-for-10 slump with a
run-scoring single in the 12th inning to lift the Devil Rays at St.
Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays, who lost an American League-high 100 games last
season, are off to the first 2-0 start in the team's five-year
history.</TE>
<TE>   Winn's game-winning hit off Jeff Farnsworth (0-1) drove in Brent
Abernathy from second base. Abernathy led off the inning with his
third hit and advanced to second on Chris Gomez's bunt.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 1, Kansas City 0--Eric Milton (1-0) gave up two
first-inning singles, then retired 19 batters in a row at Kansas
City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Milton, who was 15-7 last season, struck out two and walked none
in seven innings to outduel Dan Reichert (0-1). Eddie Guardado
pitched the ninth for his second save.</TE>
<TE>   Jacque Jones led off the third inning with a single and scored on
David Ortiz's single.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 7, Chicago 6--Bret Boone's run-scoring single with two out
in the ninth inning capped a four-run rally by the Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners trailed, 6-3, when John Olerud singled leading off
the ninth against Keith Foulke (0-1). One-out singles by Jeff Cirillo
and pinch-hitter Ruben Sierra loaded the bases. Carlos Guillen hit a
two-run single and Ichiro Suzuki's single tied the score.</TE>

<HD>Pitchers Struggle on, Off Field</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Angels' Sele rocked in 6-5 loss, while Indians'
Finley deals with domestic problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels newest pitching ace made his debut Wednesday night, but it
was the absence of the team's one-time ace that made the news.</LD>
<LD>   Aaron Sele, who signed a three-year, $24-million contract during
the off-season, was clobbered in his first Angel outing. He gave up
four runs and eight hits and threw two wild pitches in his first
three innings. He was long gone by the time the Cleveland Indians
finally wrapped up a 6-5 victory in front of 18,194 at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, Sele was still better off than former Angel Chuck Finley, who
never made it to the game because of an altercation with his wife
this week. Tawny Kitaen Finley was charged Wednesday with injuring
her husband in an altercation that occurred Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Finley, who suffered scrapes and abrasions after his wife
allegedly kicked him repeatedly, was scratched as the Indians'
starter before the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Chuck has to deal with a personal issue and that is the extent
I'm going to comment on the matter," Cleveland General Manager Mark
Shapiro said.</TE>
<TE>   That put Ryan Drese, who had nine major league games on his
resume, in the path of the Angels. But while Drese was the one tossed
on the grill, it was Sele who pitched like he was uncomfortable. .</TE>
<TE>   With one out in the second inning, Cleveland's Brady Anderson
singled and went to third when Ricky Gutierrez followed with a
single. Russell Branyan's single to left tied the score, 1-1. One out
later, Matt Lawton launched a line drive over the head of center
fielder Darin Erstad, scoring Gutierrez and Branyan.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson had a run-scoring double in the third for a 4-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "When you only get 34 to 35 starts, you want to be at your best
every time," Sele said. "I let it slide a little in the second and
third innings. I kept getting the ball up and that's too good a
hitting team to make that mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Sele settled down after the third inning, but the damage was done.
He was done after five innings, making him the third Angel starter in
three games to be in the dugout by the sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels got close, scoring two runs in the ninth, but Troy
Glaus struck out and left the tying run on second base.</TE>
<TE>   Sele has been that type of pitcher, as he has won at least 15
games each of the last four seasons. He is also the latest free-agent
starting pitcher signed by the Angels. He steps onto a path that John
D'Acquisto, Bill Travers, Frank LeCorte and, more recently, Tim
Belcher--among others--have stumbled down before him.</TE>
<TE>   No free-agent pitcher has won more than 10 games in his first
season with the Angels. More is expected from Sele, who has pitched
in the postseason each of the past four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people said when he signed that he has never won a
postseason game," Erstad said. "That's fine. Just get us there. We'll
take it from there."</TE>
<TE>   Finley, the Angels' all-time leader in victories, spent 13 seasons
chasing a postseason appearance before signing with Cleveland after
the 1999 season. Events unfolded this week that went beyond baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of us have had personal issues to deal with," Shapiro said.
"They just don't get this kind of scrutiny."</TE>
<TE>   Finley and his wife were driving home from dinner Monday evening
when Kitaen Finley allegedly started kicking her husband, according
to Tori Richards, a spokeswoman for the Orange County District
Attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Kitaen Finley allegedly grabbed her husband's ear and pushed his
foot, which was on the car's gas pedal. Finley was able to regain
control of the car and get home safely. When the argument continued,
a third party called police and Kitaen Finley was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   She was released on her own recognizance, but the judge issued a
restraining order that restricts her from going near her husband,
Richards said.</TE>
<TE>   Shapiro said that he talked with Finley Tuesday evening and that
he was physically able to pitch. He will likely rejoin the team this
weekend in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Drese did all that the Indians could have asked as a fill-in,
allowing three runs in 52/3innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels could have sent Drese packing early, but could manage
only one run out of a bases-loaded, no-out situation in the first.</TE>

<HD>Percival Sidelined With Strained Muscle</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Before Wednesday's game, closer Troy Percival underwent an MRI exam,
which revealed a strained muscle in his right side. He is unavailable
to pitch through the weekend and will be reevaluated on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "The treatment they were doing wasn't working so they wanted to
take some pictures to have a better idea of what we're dealing with,"
Percival said. Percival pitched one inning for his first save in
Tuesday's game, but his velocity was down slightly. He said the
discomfort in his right side began three weeks ago after he pitched
in an exhibition game against Colorado.</LD>
<LD>   Percival struck out 14 batters in 71/3innings during the spring,
but he limited his time because of his injury. . His fastball, which
has reached 98 mph in the past, was toping out at 96 most of the
time.</LD>
<TE>   "I still can get the fastball up there, but I start to lose
location," Percival said. "This has not been affecting my daily life.
I'm about 90% and that's OK. I'm just looking to get back to 100%."</TE>
<TE>   Percival has altered his throwing motion some, coming from more
over the top. He said that when he drops his arm, he feels more
discomfort.</TE>
<TE>   "With all the surgeries I have had, this is nothing," Percival
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lou Pote, who has six major league saves, has been used in the
closer role when Percival has been injured in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Pote had a 15.00 earned-run average in eight spring training
games. He had one save, but gave up seven home runs in 12 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever I do in spring training, I leave in Arizona," Pote said.
"I go to spring training to work the kinks out."</TE>
<TE>   Pote looked good Sunday, throwing one hitless inning in the season
opener.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our bullpen is solid," Manager Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brad Fullmer singled to left in the sixth inning Tuesday, his
first hit as an Angel. He then asked for the baseball. He has done
the same with his first hit for every team he has played with
professionally.</TE>
<TE>   "I do that with any hit that's a little special," said Fullmer,
who was acquired from Toronto in an off-season trade. "They don't
mean anything right now, but some day they will be nice to have
around."</TE>
<TE>   The one ball he doesn't have is his 500th hit, which he got while
playing with Toronto last season.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a shame, too, because it was a home run," Fullmer said.</TE>

<HD>Piazza Fined for 'Conduct'</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York Met catcher Mike Piazza was fined $3,000 by the
commissioner's office Wednesday for confronting Dodger reliever
Guillermo Mota during a spring training game last Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Watson, baseball's new disciplinarian, cited Piazza for
"aggressive conduct."</LD>
<LD>   The players' association can appeal. Piazza said he did not think
he would appeal.</LD>
<TE>   Mota hit Piazza in the backside with a 3-0 pitch, the fourth time
during spring training the catcher was hit by a pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Piazza glared at Mota and was replaced by a pinch runner. When
Mota passed the Mets' bench on his way to the clubhouse in the middle
of the eighth inning, Piazza grabbed him by the shirt. There was
shoving between the two and the benches cleared.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Mets traded outfielder Gary Matthews Jr. to the Baltimore
Orioles for left-hander John Bale.... The San Diego Padres acquired
left-handed reliever Juan Moreno from the Texas Rangers for minor
league shortstop Jason Moore.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The percentage of major league players born outside the 50 states
rose to 26.1% this season from 25.3% last year.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 849 players on opening-day rosters and disabled lists, 222
were born among 15 foreign countries, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands, the commissioner's office said.</TE>
<TE>   Seventy-four players were born in the Dominican Republic, and 38
each in Puerto Rico and Venezuela. Mexico had 18, followed by Cuba
and Japan (11 each), Canada (10), Panama (7), Australia and Colombia
(3 each), Aruba, the Netherlands Antilles, Nicaragua and South Korea
(2 each) and the U.S. Virgin Islands (1).</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Casey Jacobsen, Stanford's leading scorer in each of his three
seasons, has announced his intention to enter the NBA draft.</LD>
<LD>   Jacobsen, who led the Pacific 10 Conference in scoring last season
with a 21.9 average, won't hire an agent to leave open the
possibility of returning for his senior season, the school said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Stanford junior center Curtis Borchardt also is likely to enter
the draft.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, Jason Collins became the first player in Stanford
history to leave school early.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indiana sophomore forward Jared Jeffries will make an announcement
about his future early next week.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffries, the Big Ten's player of the year, is considering making
himself eligible for the NBA draft.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati Coach Bob Huggins dismissed Donald Little from the team
after his starting center pleaded innocent to charges accusing him of
kidnapping, beating and burning his roommate.</TE>
<TE>   Huggins took the action after determining Little violated one of
the major terms of a reinstatement contract he signed last September.
Little was dismissed from the team last May after his arrest on
traffic violations. He was allowed to return in September, but his
latest arrest violated the probation conditions of the reinstatement
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As expected, Oklahoma assistant Ray Lopes replaced Jerry Tarkanian
as Fresno State's coach, agreeing to a five-year contract.</TE>

<LD>Woody Paige of the Denver Post ridiculed the fielding of the Colorado
Rockies' Todd Zeile on opening day: "Fresh acquisition Todd Zeile
plays third base less like Brooks Robinson of the Orioles and more
like Mrs. Robinson of 'The Graduate.' He couldn't catch a fish if it
jumped into the boat ...</LD>
<LD>   "If you liked Hardy Astrom in goal for the old [hockey] Colorado
Rockies, you'll love Todd Zeile at third for the new baseball
Colorado Rockies. Zeile should be wearing a mask and a chest
protector."</LD>

<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the only player to lose the Masters in a
playoff twice?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   East is least: Barbara Barker of Newsday commenting wryly on the
NBA's "elite" Eastern Conference teams: "Forget this Final Four
nonsense. Basketball's real Cinderella story is going to be in the
Eastern Conference, where any one of a handful of former scullery
maids could find themselves playing for an NBA championship.</TE>
<TE>   "Former lottery teams Detroit, Boston and New Jersey all have what
it takes to win the East. Of course, the same could be said for just
about any East team that makes the playoffs, and perhaps a few that
don't.</TE>
<TE>   "While Western Conference teams such as the Lakers, Mavericks,
Spurs and Kings slug it out, the Eastern Conference elite (oxymoron
alert) are limping to the finish line."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No lingering for him: Mark Jackson of the New York Knicks, who
recently turned 37, said he'll know when it's time to retire. "A lot
of guys get caught up in ego and they fool themselves," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a guy that, when it's over, I'll walk away. I'll be
unbelievably thankful that I was able to hang around this long."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dog lovers: The National Hot Dog and Sausage Council estimates
that baseball fans will eat more than 26.1 million wieners this
season. The council says that despite a trend toward other menu items
at stadiums, hot dogs and sausages are the most popular selections.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yawn: Once again there is talk about building a basketball arena
near the USC campus. Other than the Sports Arena, the Trojans have
played in the Olympic, Shrine and Pan Pacific auditoriums, the Forum,
Cal State L.A. and the USC men's gymnasium over the years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Best they can do: Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times: "It's not
as if anybody would want any of their players. The first 3,000 fans
attending the Grizzlies' game in Memphis on Friday will receive an
Elvis Presley bobble-head doll. It will be carrying a guitar and
wearing a Grizzlies' uniform."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1994, Arkansas beat Duke, 76-72, in
the men's NCAA championship game at Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Corliss Williamson of the Razorbacks led all scorers with 23
points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Ben Hogan in 1942 and 1954.</TE>
<TE>   However, he also won the tournament in 1951 and 1953.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Skip Bayless of the San Jose Mercury News commenting
on Barry Bonds' two home runs against the Dodgers on opening day:
"Bonds' second homer gave me chills. This was Bonds announcing to
pitchers from here to Cooperstown that he has figured out how to hit
a home run off nearly any pitch thrown over the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "That was no one-time zone that Bonds discovered last September.
That was permanent Bonds."</TE>

<HD>Clippers Go From Bad to Sad</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Selfish play leaves Gentry disgusted and
with no chance against the opportunistic Jazz, which easily prevails,
99-87.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>As ever, the Utah Jazz played like a team Wednesday, setting picks,
passing the ball to an open teammate, helping each other out on
defense. The Clippers played like a bunch of guys who just met at the
park for a pick-up game.</LD>
<LD>   Was it any wonder the Jazz battered the Clippers, 99-87, before a
crowd of 18,591 in the Delta Center? Of course not. The Jazz has been
playing this way since John Stockton's short shorts were actually
considered stylish.</LD>
<LD>   The burning postgame questions centered on what's happened to the
happy-go-lucky team that caught the attention of fans with its
eye-popping play and unending resolve when things didn't go its way.
There also were pointed questions about selfish play and a lack of
team unity on the court.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm upset with my team," Coach Alvin Gentry said after the
Clippers fell below the .500 mark (37-38) for the first time since
they were 30-31 on March 6. "It's not about an individual, it's about
a team. It's the most disappointed I've been all year."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry did not get specific, but center Michael Olowokandi did.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't play well together," said Olowokandi, who had seven
points on two-of-15 shooting. "Whenever you have a group of guys that
are very uncertain of their futures on the team that will always
happen. Whenever you have that situation, you will never have a
basketball team. Not this year, not next year, not 10 years from now.
We had a situation tonight where everyone was just going on their
own. It wasn't good.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are very uncertain with the future of this team. It's
starting to affect the way we play the game."</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi and point guard Jeff McInnis are eligible to become
free agents this summer and neither has been approached about
re-signing.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi is a restricted free agent, with the Clippers able to
match any outside offers to retain his rights.</TE>
<TE>   McInnis is an unrestricted free agent, able to sign with any other
team.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Elton Brand, Corey Maggette and Lamar Odom are
eligible for long-term contract extensions. They also have heard
nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "What people have to understand is when you win, everyone's future
is brighter," Brand said. "Coach said he saw some problems
[Wednesday]. He knows best. It might have been there for who knows
how long. We might just be burned out. We don't want to make excuses.
People definitely don't know what's going on, though."</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi said he was so frustrated by his teammates' freelancing
offense in the first quarter, when they trailed the Jazz 22-9, that
he "didn't want to play."</TE>
<TE>   He also said, "It's frustrating. Off the court, we're a close-knit
group. Once it comes to getting down to business, everyone goes his
own way."</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Olowokandi said, "Guys on the wing, who would
normally throw the ball into the post, were driving right at you.
It's OK if they yell to get out of the way, but they were driving
right at you."</TE>
<TE>   No question the Clippers were out of sync during their worst
quarter of the season.</TE>
<TE>   If not for Brand, who scored all of the team's nine points, they
would have been blanked in the opening 12 minutes. Brand was four for
seven. The rest of the Clippers missed all of their 11 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he could remember the last time he scored all of his
team's points in a quarter, Brand said, "Maybe Rec League."</TE>
<TE>   Utah didn't exactly look like champions, but by halftime the Jazz
led, 41-30, and was beginning to click one night after losing to the
Nuggets at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz rolled to a 28-point lead in the third quarter, picking
apart the Clippers for the 14th consecutive game with their efficient
passing and screening offense. Karl Malone led the Jazz with 24
points. Stockton added 11 points and nine assists.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the only fight the Clippers showed happened on the final
basket of the game, with Darius Miles throwing down a thunderous dunk
over Andrei Kirilenko that brought the Clippers to within 12 points
in the closing seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Brand led the Clippers with 24 points and 11 rebounds, his 53rd
double-double. He needs two more to pass Swen Nater's franchise
record of 54 double-doubles, set in 1980-81.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disheartening," Brand said of the Clippers' poor effort.
"It's a shame we didn't fight harder."</TE>

<LD>The Clippers lost Wednesday to the Jazz for the 26th consecutive time
at Utah, which includes an 0-22 record at the Delta Center. Inquiring
minds wished to know why the Clippers can't seem to win in Salt Lake.</LD>
<LD>   "I can give you two pretty good reasons," Clipper Coach Alvin
Gentry said. "One wears No. 12 and the other wears No. 32." That
would be point guard John Stockton and power forward Karl Malone.</LD>
<LD>   "Guys," Gentry told reporters, "they've been doing that to
everybody for 50 years or for however long they have been playing
together."</LD>
<TE>   The Jazz edged closer to securing a Western Conference playoff
spot. Utah is in eighth place in the West with a 42-33 record. The
Clippers are ninth with a 37-38 mark.</TE>
<TE>   "I can guarantee you there aren't any teams that will be overly
excited about playing them in the playoffs," Gentry said of the Jazz.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As expected, Corey Maggette started at small forward in place of
Tremaine Fowlkes. Maggette had 18 points in 32 minutes in his third
game since coming off the injured list. He was sidelined more than a
month because of two dislocated bones in his right hand. He also had
arthroscopic knee surgery during his layoff.</TE>

high-scoring game tonight, with the Clippers still searching for a
winning record and the Mavericks chasing the Sacramento Kings and the
Lakers for the league's top record. The Mavericks are 13-5 since
acquiring Avery Johnson, Raef LaFrentz, Nick Van Exel and Tariq
Abdul-Wahad from the Denver Nuggets on Feb. 21. LaFrentz is averaging
11.3 points, 7.3 rebounds and 2.1 blocked shots in 18 games as the
Mavericks' starting center.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Bonds smacks two more homers and Giants go the
rout against Dodgers, 12-0.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds took his family on a ski trip to Aspen, Colo., last
winter, but the San Francisco Giant slugger claimed he didn't hit the
slopes. "The kids had a fun time, but I didn't get on the chair
lift," Bonds said. "I'm afraid of heights."</LD>
<LD>   He better get used to them. The way Bonds is ascending baseball's
all-time home run list, he's going to have a serious case of
acrophobia pretty soon.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds mashed two more home runs Wednesday night, a pair of
tape-measure blasts that traveled a combined 902 feet, to lead the
Giants to a 12-0 blowout of the Dodgers before a crowd of 36,374 at
Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Added to the two homers he hit Tuesday, Bonds has 571 home runs,
moving him within two of Harmon Killebrew for sixth on the all-time
list and within 12 of Mark McGwire at No. 5.</TE>
<TE>   At the rate he's going--2002 feels like an extension of Bonds'
astonishing 2001 season, when he shattered McGwire's single-season
record with 73 home runs--Hank Aaron's all-time record of 755 home
runs appears within reach for a 37-year-old who has gotten better and
stronger with age.</TE>
<TE>   "You start getting close to Hank Aaron, pretty soon you'll be able
to levitate," San Francisco Manager Dusty Baker said when asked if
Bonds had reached a new stratosphere of stardom. "What's greater than
great?"</TE>
<TE>   How about four home runs in the span of six at-bats Tuesday and
Wednesday, a daily double that marked only the second time in major
league history (Eddie Mathews, Milwaukee Braves, 1958) a player has
homered twice on the first two days of the season?</TE>
<TE>   How about a 443-foot home run into the right-field pavilion on a
1-2 Hideo Nomo fastball in the first inning Wednesday, and following
that with a 459-foot blast off Terry Mulholland into the same
section, only deeper, in the fourth?</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' homers highlighted a 15-hit barrage that included Benito
Santiago's three-run homer and winning pitcher Russ Ortiz's two-run
homer in the fourth, both of which contributed to a six-run inning
that gave San Francisco a 10-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, it can be demoralizing losing like this," left fielder
Brian Jordan said. "I don't mind losing 3-1 or 4-1, but when you get
your butt handed to you like we have the last two days, it's not
good."</TE>
<TE>   Showing some mercy, Baker lifted Bonds in the bottom of the fifth
inning, but not before Bonds, who already has nine runs batted in,
left Nomo, Mulholland and the Dodgers in tatters.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo ran into immediate trouble in the first, walking leadoff
batter Tsuyoshi Shinjo and giving up a hit-and-run single to Rich
Aurilia. Nomo got ahead of Bonds, 1-and-2 in the count, but instead
of burying a couple of forkballs--supposedly Nomo's best pitch--in
the dirt, Nomo tried to sneak a fastball inside. Some trickery. The
pitch was thigh-high, over the heart of the plate, and Bonds
deposited it over the wall in right for a three-run homer.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think about throwing a forkball at that point," Nomo
said. "I was just thinking about throwing a fastball. Unfortunately,
it was an easy pitch to hit."</TE>
<TE>   Nomo labored through the second and third, walking Shinjo with the
bases loaded to give the Giants a 4-0 lead in the third, and Dodger
Manager Jim Tracy replaced him with Mulholland to start the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Before Bonds, who was intentionally walked with a runner on second
in the second inning, led off the fourth, Dodger catcher Paul LoDuca
went to the mound for a chat with Mulholland, perhaps a reminder not
to throw Bonds anything he could hit.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Mulholland hung a 1-0 slider that Bonds pummeled, sending
it into the right-field seats for his fourth home run of the season
and his eighth off the Dodger left-hander, tying Mulholland with Greg
Maddux and John Smoltz for the most home runs given up to Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland wised up in the fifth, throwing four consecutive balls
to Bonds--one that nearly hit him--but that produced no satisfaction
for Mulholland, who was rocked for eight runs on seven hits in two
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Most pitchers stayed away from Bonds in 2001, and Bonds set a
major league record with 177 walks, but that didn't prevent him from
walloping 73 homers. Before the game, Tracy was asked why teams even
bother pitching to Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy hitting behind him [Reggie Sanders] had 33 homers last
year, so he's not exactly a slouch," Tracy said. "Nor will [injured
cleanup batter Jeff] Kent be when he comes back. You pitch away from
Barry Bonds, and you're pitching to the 2000 [National League] most
valuable player."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said the situation will dictate strategy. Bonds homered with
two on in the second inning Tuesday to make it 5-1, and he added a
solo homer in the seventh to give San Francisco an 8-2 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "If the score is 7-2, are we going to pitch around him?" Tracy
said. "No, we won't."</TE>
<TE>   After Wednesday night, he might want to re-consider.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not going to hit a thousand home runs this year," Mulholland
said. "If he does, I guess we'll have to quit pitching to him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Connect Four</TE>
<TE>   Tracking Barry Bonds' home runs:</TE>
<TE>   No.1--Bonds got off to a roaring start by homering on opening day
for the second consecutive year, the fourth time overall. The
394-foot line drive to left came off Kevin Brown in the second inning
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   No.2--With a 447-foot blast inside the right-field foul pole off
Omar Daal in the seventh, Bonds became only the 10th player to reach
the loge section in Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   No.3--Bonds got the Giants going with a 443-foot three-run home
run to right-center off Hideo Nomo in the first inning Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   No.4--Bonds became the second player to hit two homers in each of
his team's first two games (joining Hall of Famer Eddie Mathews, who
did it in 1958). Bonds drove Terry Mulholland's breaking ball 459
feet into the right-center-field bleachers in the fourth.</TE>

<HD>Mets Foil the Plan and Claim Christensen</HD>

<LD>What the Dodgers feared since last October came to pass Wednesday:
Outfielder McKay Christensen, designated for assignment Sunday and
out of minor league options, was claimed on waivers by the New York
Mets.</LD>
<LD>   Christensen, a 1994 first-round pick of the Angels who was
acquired from the Chicago White Sox for double-A pitcher Wade Parrish
last July 13, lost out to Dave Roberts in his bid for the
center-field job this spring.</LD>
<LD>   But the Dodgers hoped to retain Christensen and add to what little
depth they have in their minor league system. The Mets prevented
that, adding Christensen to their big league roster Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   General Manager Dan Evans said the Dodgers signed former Houston
outfielder Scott Pose on Tuesday because they didn't anticipate
Christensen getting through waivers. "This is the risk we had all
along," he said. "Since October, we knew if McKay didn't make the
club, we couldn't send him down. It's a loss for the organization,
but I wish him the best, except against us."</TE>
<TE>   Christensen batted .286 with a .324 on-base percentage in 20
spring games but seemed to fall out of favor with Dodger coaches
after missing a sign early in camp and missing a cutoff man and
throwing to the wrong base in mid-March.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco slugger Barry Bonds, who hit home run No. 570 in the
first inning and No. 571 in the fourth Wednesday night, needs 184
homers to tie Hank Aaron's record of 755, but he claims reaching the
top of the home run chart is not what motivates him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not playing baseball to climb totem poles, I'm playing to get
to the World Series," Bonds said. "I saw [teammate and former Arizona
outfielder] Reggie Sanders' World Series ring in the locker room
today, and that was kind of emotional for me. I'm hoping one day I
can walk around the clubhouse and show mine."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said Japanese pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii, who
has struggled with control problems, will make his scheduled start
Saturday against Colorado.... Pitcher Brian Corey, who impressed the
Dodgers with a 1.50 earned-run average in 11 spring-training
appearances before being sent to triple-A Las Vegas, suffered a
fractured jaw Tuesday when he was struck in the face by a line drive
during batting practice. Corey will be sidelined for four to six
weeks.... There are two right-handed bats with big names available on
the free-agent market--Jose Canseco, who was released by the Expos,
and Derek Bell, who was released by the Pirates--but Evans said the
Dodgers don't plan to pursue either.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Tie and Beat Crowd</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Result disappoints large contingent of Red Wing
fans at Arrowhead Pond.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just to shake things up, the Mighty Ducks decided to wear their road
purple and jade uniforms for their game against the Detroit Red Wings
on Wednesday night at the Arrowhead Pond.</LD>
<LD>   It turned out to be a good move. The Ducks outplayed the NHL's
best team for much of the night and skated away with a 1-1 tie
despite having Detroit cheered as if it were the home team by a
pro-Red Wing sellout crowd of 17,174.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks, who ended a two-game losing streak, were outshot by
Detroit, 30-23, but they had their chances to win.</LD>
<TE>   In a scoreless first period, the Ducks lost starting goaltender
Steve Shields 11:43 into the game when he suffered facial cuts and a
head injury after being hit by the right elbow of the Red Wings'
Tomas Holmstrom. Jean-Sebastien Giguere stepped in and finished the
game. He had 17 saves.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, who gave Detroit goaltender Dominik Hasek fits all
night with constant traffic in front of him, scored the first goal of
the game when Jeff Friesen picked up his 16th of the season early in
the second. With Anaheim on the power play, Friesen picked up a Paul
Kariya rebound and slipped in a backhand shot between Detroit goalie
Dominik Hasek's legs 26 seconds into the period.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings, who lost to the Ducks at Detroit last month, tied
the score at 1-1 later in the second when former King Luc Robitaille
knocked in a power-play goal at 11:48.</TE>
<TE>   In the third period and overtime, Anaheim seemed to control play
but failed to score despite having a power-play late in the extra
period.</TE>
<TE>   For Detroit, hearing chants of "Let's Go Red Wings" on the road is
nothing new. It's been that way for years and with the team's success
this season, it's heard even more now.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some cities that we go, like Nashville, Tampa Bay, and we
see more red than the home team's colors," said Robitaille, whose
second-period goal gave him his fourth consecutive 30-goal season.
"It's certainly neat because there are a lot of road games that feel
like we're at home. That's pretty amazing."</TE>
<TE>   With the aim of preserving his players for the playoffs, Coach
Scotty Bowman did not play several of his regulars, and defenseman
Nicklas Lidstrom did not make the Red Wings' three-game West Coast
trip because of a groin injury.</TE>
<TE>   But Detroit did have defenseman Uwe Krupp back in the lineup. He
missed most of the season because of a shoulder injury. Steve
Yzerman, who has not played since the Olympics because of a knee
injury, skated with the team Wednesday morning and could return to
the ice before the Red Wings return home.</TE>

<KH>GOLF THOMAS BONK</KH>
<HD>Ten Predictions That Require Masters Degree</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Next week, the Masters lets us know that spring is here--even if Jack
Nicklaus isn't--and all the commentary and discussion and evaluation
of the alterations made to Augusta National can begin in earnest.</LD>
<LD>   You usually know what to expect around the place: Lots of blooming
flowers, lots of blooming trees, lots of blooming complaining about
how hard the course is. Chances are it's not going to be any easier
this time.</LD>
<LD>   With so much to think about, it's probably a good time to get a
head start on the proceedings and point out what things are sure to
happen during Masters week.</LD>
<TE>   1. Someone will count the number of magnolia trees on Magnolia
Lane and reveal the number to be 61. This is correct.</TE>
<TE>   2. Someone will count the number of new pine trees planted just
short of the bunker complex on the left side of the 18th fairway and
reveal this number to be seven.</TE>
<TE>   3. No one, not even Tiger Woods, will hit a pitching wedge as a
second shot at No. 18.</TE>
<TE>   4. John Daly, who had to pull out of the BellSouth Classic because
of the flu, will show up next week even if his caddie is a nurse.</TE>
<TE>   5. David Duval, who says he hopes Augusta National will improve
his spirits, will find it's a tough place to locate his sense of
humor.</TE>
<TE>   6. Someone will find an intersection in Augusta that has a Waffle
House on every corner.</TE>
<TE>   7. Someone will discover that if they lengthen the 18th hole again
and move the putting green any farther back, it's going to wind up on
the front porch of Bobby Jones' cabin.</TE>
<TE>   8. There will be a contest to see who is the first one to actually
say, "The Masters doesn't start until the back nine on Sunday." (Why
play the first 63 holes then?)</TE>
<TE>   9. Greg Norman, who is playing better despite a sore back, will
actually continue doing so, but he won't win, again.</TE>
<TE>   10. Tiger will, again.</TE>
<TE>   Program Note</TE>
<TE>   News item: The LPGA says some of its tournaments will be carried
on cable, on the Oxygen channel.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Isn't that what the Senior Tour is on?</TE>
<TE>   Ballot Update</TE>
<TE>   Ben Crenshaw has been voted into the World Golf Hall of Fame,
selected on the PGA Tour ballot, along with Tony Jacklin, who made it
on the International Ballot. Marlene Hagge also was elected, in the
LPGA Veterans category.</TE>
<TE>   The induction ceremony is Nov. 15 at the World Golf Village near
St. Augustine, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Bernhard Langer will also be inducted. Langer made it in 2001 but
wanted to delay his induction to this year.</TE>
<TE>   Ratings News</TE>
<TE>   There was relief, but no one was doing handsprings at the LPGA
headquarters when the overnight television ratings showed that ABC's
2.6 Nielsen rating for Annika Sorenstam's victory Sunday at Mission
Hills were 92% better than last year's 1.2. Why?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a realist," LPGA Commissioner Ty Votaw said. "We had a PGA
Tour lead-in [the Shell Houston Open] and not going against us. Also,
the leaderboard helped too."</TE>
<TE>   Shoe News</TE>
<TE>   Here's the final update on those red shoes that Sorenstam wore
when she won the Kraft Nabisco Championship. They're made by Nike,
they're from the women's "Verdana" collection, they're $85 and
they're slip-ons.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that they slip off pretty easily too, thank
goodness, the way those things look.</TE>
<TE>   Said Sorenstam: "Maybe Tiger will throw me a few pennies."</TE>
<TE>   The shoes won't be in stores until Sept. 1, so we do have
something to be thankful for. It's fair to say the reaction to them
is mixed. Some people thought the shoes looked fine and others
thought the shoes looked like someone needed to drop a house on them.</TE>
<TE>   Votaw assumed a diplomatic posture about the footwear: "I think
they were nice to look at, but not to wear."</TE>
<TE>   Brace Yourself</TE>
<TE>   The best quote of the week is from Aree Wonglukiet, 15, when asked
when she planned to turn pro: "I don't know, when I get my braces
off."</TE>
<TE>   Beep, Beep</TE>
<TE>   Who's in the driver's seat? It's Chrysler, which announced it will
sponsor two events and renew its sponsorship deal at two other PGA
Tour events from 2003-2006, including the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler will also continue its deal with Greensboro and also take
over the Tucson Open (now the Chrysler Classic of Tucson) and the
Chrysler Championship in Tampa--which gets $24 million from the
automaker and can now offer a $5-million purse for the week before
the Tour Championship.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler replaces Buick as the largest sponsor of regular tour
events.</TE>
<TE>   Program Note II</TE>
<TE>   Here's the latest on the proposed Major Champions Tour--attorney
Leonard Decof has signed on and letters have gone out to the
prospective players to see if 20 of the 34 eligible to play will
agree to do so by the May 30 deadline established by Fox.</TE>

<KH>Mark Heisler ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>Net Result Fine With Scott</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>On the plus side for the Lakers, Shaquille O'Neal finally got to rest
his sore toe.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, the way it was supposed to go, they would stage another
of their patented late-season surges and lock up the No. 1 seed in
the West, first. Instead, O'Neal came up with a sore wrist Wednesday
night, sidelining him against the New Jersey Nets, who romped to a
19-point lead, held off a brave Laker rally and won, 94-92.</LD>
<LD>   However valiant, the Lakers are now 21/2 games behind the
West-leading Sacramento Kings, and three in the loss column, with
seven to play.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, it was even more thrilling for the young Nets, who
don't often beat the NBA champions, or sell out (this was their sixth
of the season and it's almost over) and thus could overlook
indignities, like perhaps 10% of the crowd rooting for the Lakers,
and not having a chance to make a statement against Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   Someone even asked Net Coach Byron Scott afterward if he wasn't a
little sorry O'Neal hadn't played.</TE>
<TE>   "No," said Scott, ignoring convention, as usual. "I was hoping
Kobe [Bryant] would fall down and be out for the game, also. Not hurt
himself but be out for the game.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to take 'em as you get 'em."</TE>
<TE>   This task looked daunting enough. The NBA balance of power doesn't
just tilt West now, it drops, as off a cliff (although there's no
truth to the rumor the East winner will go into a round-robin against
the champions of the National Developmental Basketball League and the
WNBA to see who faces the Western team.)</TE>
<TE>   The Nets, who lead the East by three games, have a .660 winning
percentage against their own conference. Meanwhile, the No. 7 team in
the West, Seattle, has a .655 mark against East teams, and No. 8 Utah
is .633 against them.</TE>
<TE>   So it made good sense for the Nets to zip it up before this game,
which they did. There was none of that "statement game" stuff that
Scott's mentor, Pat Riley, loved, no "potential finals previews"
illusions.</TE>
<TE>   Scott did note that the difference between his team (Nets) and his
old team (Lakers) was one more marquee player ... like Jason Kidd.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the consensus is that it's a miracle that the Nets landed
Kidd, and another such lightning bolt isn't expected soon.</TE>
<TE>   So you can imagine Byron's delight when fate subtracted one of the
Lakers' marquee players, evening out the sides, and the Nets then
went up by 19.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Bryant then went into one of his numbers you have to
see to believe before finally failing to complete the final bit of
magic, coming out of nowhere to rebound Rick Fox's missed free throw
but missing the shot that would have left the Nets talking to
themselves for years.</TE>
<TE>   "He came from the side," said the Nets' Richard Jefferson, who had
lined up on the lane. "You can't box him out so basically, he gets a
running start. And then the ball just came off--on that side, the
side he was on.</TE>
<TE>   "I guarantee you, if Rick Fox was to take that shot 10 more times,
that ball wouldn't come off in that direction, that position again."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, a Net--Kidd, who was next to Bryant--was supposed to box
out Kobe but he had an excuse.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't jump that high," Kidd said.</TE>
<TE>   As Bryant's head, shoulders and torso soared above the crowd on
the play, TV replays showed Scott, normally as expressive as the
Sphinx, watching on the sidelines, with his eyes starting to roll
back in his head.</TE>
<TE>   "First of all, I couldn't believe he got there," Scott said, "and
then when he got it in his hands, I couldn't believe he missed. But
that's Kobe. This guy's an unbelievable athlete, an unbelievable
basketball player. You guys got a chance to see him in rare form
tonight....</TE>
<TE>   "Kobe Bryant is the real deal."</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, when they were Lakers together, they were like teacher
and student. Scott says he still bleeds purple and gold and, of
course, Nets red, white and blue too. Before the game, he walked to
the Laker bench, shook hands with all the coaches and hugged trainer
Gary Vitti and Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   After that, the atmosphere thickened. In the third quarter, with
fans needling him, Laker Coach Phil Jackson growled, "You weren't
even here two months ago! Johnny-come-lately, giving me grief!"</TE>
<TE>   It's just the way things are going for the Lakers these days,
imperfectly.</TE>
<TE>   At this point last season, they already had all their grief out of
the way, with everything falling together in a 23-1 season-ending
thunderclap.</TE>
<TE>   This season is looking a lot more like real life.</TE>

<DH>Horse racing: With 3-year-old crop lacking a star, Came
Home has a chance to stand out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Team Valor owners of Captain Bodgit wish they still had the real
thing, instead of just a son of Captain Bodgit. Murray Friedlander,
an international bloodstock agent, wishes he had been able to find a
good 3-year-old this year. And John Toffan, one of the owners of the
favorite for Saturday's Santa Anita Derby, can only speculate about
how well the class of 1997 might have done in this year's Triple
Crown.</LD>
<LD>   Which is to say, the 2002 Kentucky Derby might be only four weeks
away, but with no clear-cut favorite, there's the lingering feeling
that the current crop of 3-year-olds could be subpar. As always, the
races will decide, and there are too many races left to run--two more
rounds of Kentucky Derby preps, the Derby itself and the rest of the
grueling Triple Crown series. Call back in mid-June for a more
definitive analysis.</LD>
<LD>   Toffan and his partner, Trudy McCaffery, who'll watch Came Home
shoot for his sixth victory in seven starts in the $750,000 Santa
Anita Derby, also raced Free House as a 3-year-old in 1997, a year
marked by a strong group of colts. Free House earned $1.3 million
that year but had to do it the hard way, butting heads with Silver
Charm, Captain Bodgit and Touch Gold in the Triple Crown. After
winning the Santa Anita Derby, Free House finished third in the
Kentucky Derby, lost by a head to Silver Charm in the Preakness and
was third in the Belmont.</LD>
<TE>   "There are no outstanding horses this year," Toffan said Tuesday.
"You think about how tough the horses were the year Free House ran.
Our horse, and the ones he had to beat. If any of those horses were
around now, their owners would think that they'd have a super chance
to win the Triple Crown."</TE>
<TE>   That son of Captain Bodgit, Windward Passage, has been running at
Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Ark., and will be one of the favorites
in the Arkansas Derby on April 13. Meanwhile, at Santa Anita, Came
Home will face six or seven rivals in his first test at 11/8 miles,
an eighth of a mile shorter than the Kentucky Derby. It would cost
Tracemark, not nominated and with only a victory against maidens in
12 starts, $30,000 to run. More likely to start are Mayakovsky,
Danthebluegrassman, Easy Grades, Jack's Silver, Lusty Latin and U S S
Tinosa.</TE>
<TE>   The Came Home camp, which also includes trainer Paco Gonzalez and
additional owners Will Farish and John Goodman, won't vouch for their
colt's potential at 11/4 miles, but after his three-length victory at
a mile in the San Rafael on March 2, they feel Saturday's distance is
well within his scope.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very impressive the way he galloped out after his last
race," said Bill Farish, son of Will Farish, the U.S. ambassador to
Great Britain. "He was hardly blowing at all."</TE>
<TE>   Questioning Came Home's breeding--he's by Gone West out of Nice
Assay, a broodmare that McCaffery and Toffan sold for $1.7 million in
1999--irks Toffan.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care for the self-appointed pedigree experts," he said.
"I know Came Home's out of a speed mare, but the way he trains, we
think he can run farther than he has. The bloodlines don't always
work. You can't just look at a horse and say he's going to be a
sprinter, without trying him. I don't know if any of these horses
want a mile and a quarter. I think a mile and an eighth won't be a
problem for my horse, and then after that, as for the Derby, we'll
just have to see. Paco's calling the shots and he says the horse is
good enough to win the Santa Anita Derby."</TE>
<TE>   The opening line for this week's Kentucky Derby Future Wager has
Came Home, at 10-1, grouped with Johannesburg, Medaglia d'Oro, and
Saarland. The favorites, trained by Ken McPeek, are Harlan's Holiday,
6-1, and Repent, 8-1.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, trainer Aidan O'Brien said Tuesday that undefeated
Johannesburg, unraced since winning the Breeders' Cup Juvenile in
October, might run Sunday at the Curragh near Dublin, in a
seven-furlong grass race against older horses, instead of facing
other 3-year-olds in a one-mile race Saturday over the all-weather
surface at Lingfield Park in England. In an extraordinary plan,
Johannesburg is scheduled to run only once before going in the
Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's a dry week, my first preference is the Curragh," O'Brien
said. "It's been raining, but the last few days it's dried up. You
never know about the weather. I know we'll be taking a huge step in
the Derby. As a 2-year-old, this horse was a freak and no challenge
was too big. We're hopeful he's a freak as a 3-year-old as well."</TE>
<TE>   With 10 horses entered, Repent drew the outside post for
Saturday's $500,000 Illinois Derby at Sportsman's Park. Fonz's, who
ran fifth at Santa Anita in the San Rafael--his first start of the
year--will carry 117 pounds, seven less than Repent, and be ridden by
Alfredo Juarez Jr. for the first time.... Nokoma, seventh in the
Florida Derby, gets a new rider in Mike Smith for the Wood Memorial
at Aqueduct on April 13.... The same day, Azillion, the colt Smith
rode to a second-place finish, a neck behind Perfect Drift, in the
Spiral at Turfway Park, will be ridden by Corey Nakatani in the Blue
Grass at Keeneland.</TE>

<HD>Hoover Is a Force in Pacific</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAUREN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Excitement surrounded the Glendale Hoover High boys' tennis team
before the start of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Expectations have risen since the Tornadoes surprised Arcadia,
14-4, last week in a Pacific League match at Hoover.</LD>
<LD>   In its first measuring-stick match, Hoover (12-0, 3-0 in league
play), No. 6 in The Times' rankings and fourth in the Southern
Section Division I coaches' poll, beat up a previously undefeated
Arcadia team that had won the last two league titles, advanced to the
section Division I semifinals, and had two well-regarded
junior-circuit players in Mark Contreras and Warren Li.</LD>
<TE>   "Our first challenge was Arcadia," said Hoover sophomore Sergy
Vagramian, who plays at No. 3 singles. "It was our first test."</TE>
<TE>   Hoover won seven of nine sets in singles, but surprisingly, did
more damage in doubles, where it swept all three sets in the first
round.</TE>
<TE>   "After that was when I tried to control myself," Coach Lynn
Santamaria said. "But I was somewhat excited. I've never, ever, in 11
years I've been doing this, had this kind of depth in doubles."</TE>
<TE>   It sunk Arcadia (9-1, 1-1), which bowed gracefully to the
Tornadoes.</TE>
<TE>   "They're really strong," Arcadia doubles player Jonathan Lee said.
"There's been a lot of hype about Hoover, so we knew it'd be tough.
But for every single set out there, we had to fight, and we got blown
away anyway. I really think they can win the title for Division I."</TE>
<TE>   So does Hoover, the second-place finisher in the Pacific League
and a loser in the second round of the playoffs last year.</TE>
<TE>   Its lineup includes, at No. 1 singles, freshman Sam Tadevosian,
the runner-up in last summer's U.S. Tennis Assn. Boys' 14 division
Southern California sectional tournament and the Ojai tournament
boys' 14-and-under champion last April.</TE>
<TE>   Tadevosian (31-1 in sets) is No. 19 in the boys' 16 division in
Southern California in current USTA standings. He has lost only to
Contreras, 7-6 (8-6).</TE>
<TE>   Tadevosian is joined by junior Dylan Kim (20-0), who moved with
his family from Korea last summer and advanced to the quarterfinals
of the International Tennis Federation Orange Bowl tournament in
December. He is usually at No. 2 or No. 3 singles, but he is also
strong in doubles.</TE>
<TE>   Vagramian (16-1), a transfer from Burbank, did not play high
school tennis last spring. He was enrolled in a home-schooling
program and at the Weil Tennis Academy in Ojai. He is No. 25 in the
boys' 16 Southern California standings.</TE>
<TE>   He lost in the semifinals of the South Torrance tournament two
weeks ago and will team with Tadevosian in doubles at the USTA Easter
Bowl/Super National Championships beginning this week in Palm
Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Hakop Tadevosian, Sam's brother and the 2000 Ojai
tournament boys' 14-and-under champion, is No. 46 in Southern
California in boys' 16 standings. Relegated by the new talent and
depth to No. 1 doubles, he and sophomore Robert Abedian are 13-1.</TE>
<TE>   Seniors Carl Weber and Eugene Kim are 23-9 at No. 2 doubles and
sophomore Joseph Kim and senior Eddie Choi, another former singles
player, are 20-3 at No. 3 doubles.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the season, we knew we had a great team," Vagramian said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our top guys are all really good, and everybody else is pretty
decent. We don't have any minuses on our team."In addition to the
players' talent, they have also formed a close bond, forged largely
by common Armenian and Korean heritages, their enthusiasm for the
sport and their prospects of success.</TE>
<TE>   "With Sam and Sergy and Hakop, they know each other so well that
they're really close, and they mingle with the other boys very well,"
Santamaria said . "They're creating a really nice atmosphere that's
competitive but fun."</TE>
<TE>   Santamaria has no trouble getting his players to show up for high
school practice sessions and matches, a common problem for coaches of
junior-circuit veterans.</TE>
<TE>   "We take it pretty seriously and have some pretty good practices,"
Vagramian said. "And we really look forward to all our matches."</TE>
<TE>   This season, that's no wonder.</TE>

<HD>Hill and Gooden Pick Up the Pace for Wilson Girls</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Lashinda Demus, the national record-holder in the girls' 300-meter
low hurdles, graduated from Long Beach Wilson High last June. But the
Bruins are hardly in a rebuilding phase in the 300 hurdles this
season.</LD>
<LD>   That was evident Saturday in the Pasadena Games at Pasadena City
College when juniors MacKenzie Hill and Dianna Gooden won their races
in the event.</LD>
<LD>   Hills' 43.82-second clocking in the invitational heat and Gooden's
44.75 effort in the open race were well off Demus' national record of
39.98, but those career-best times moved them to first and fifth on
the yearly state list in the event.</LD>
<TE>   Not bad for two 400 runners who took up the 300 hurdles in earnest
this season after competing in the shadows of teammates such as
Demus, Angel Tate and Ashley Freeman last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew they'd be fast, but we didn't know they'd be that fast,"
said Ed Hauck, the Wilson boys' coach who works with Hill and Gooden
from time to time. "We figured if they ran under 45 that would be
good. We never expected the kind of times they ran, especially a
sub-44 by MacKenzie."</TE>
<TE>   Sidelined state champion: Riverside North, led by Chaunte Howard's
victories in the girls' high jump, long jump and triple jump, turned
in several noteworthy performances at the Pasadena Games. But junior
Ashlee Brown was notable in her absence from the hurdle events.</TE>
<TE>   Brown won the state title in the 300 lows last year after Demus
failed to advance to the state meet, but she has not raced since
finishing second in the 60 highs in the National Scholastic indoor
championships in New York City on March 10.</TE>
<TE>   "She has a bad hamstring," North Coach Charles Leathers said. "I
don't expect her to race [in the Arcadia Invitational at Arcadia High
on April 12-13]. Hopefully, we can get her back for [the Mt. Carmel
Invitational] the following week."</TE>
<TE>   Injury-prompted debut: When Riverside North sprinter Tracee Thomas
was fitted with a cast three weeks ago to help immobilize an injured
knee, Leathers knew his team's state-title chances were dimming.</TE>
<TE>   So he approached Howard about adding the long jump to her list of
competitive events that already included the high jump, in which she
is the defending state champion, triple jump and 100 high hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   Howard worked on the long jump in practice one afternoon last week
before leaping a state-leading 19 feet 8 inches in a dual meet
against Riverside Poly last Thursday and spanning a meet-record
19-73/4 in the Pasadena Games two days later.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, everyone has to step up," said the Georgia Tech-bound
Howard.</TE>
<TE>   Putting it behind him: Junior Noah Smith of Woodland Hills Taft
felt he was incorrectly called for a false start in the boys' 100 at
the Pasadena Games, but he did not use his disqualification from that
event as motivation for the 200 later in the meet.</TE>
<TE>   "I just had to put it behind me because it was messing with my
head," said Smith, who won the 200 in 21.38, the second-fastest time
in the state this year. "I did stay in the blocks a split-second
longer [in the 200] because I didn't want to get called for another
false start when I didn't think I jumped the first time."</TE>
<TE>   Quick exit: T.J. Fakehinde of Fullerton Eastside Christian cleared
a meet-record 7 feet in the boys' high jump in the Surf City
Invitational at Huntington Beach High on March 24 but withdrew from
the Pasadena Games after clearing 5-8 on his opening attempt of the
competition.</TE>
<TE>   "Our plan is to take one jump at Pasadena and call it a day,"
Eastside Christian Coach Rich Davis said several days before the
meet. "I don't want to lose a whole day of training for that meet."</TE>
<TE>   Davis had Fakehinde take one jump in the Pasadena Games so the
competition would count toward one of seven meets Fakehinde is
required to compete in during the regular season to be eligible for
the Southern Section Division IV preliminaries on May 11.</TE>
<TE>   Injured Don: Senior Jermaine Rolison of Dorsey, the fastest
returning performer in the state in the boys' 110 high hurdles,
strained a hamstring while running the first leg on the Dons' 400
relay team in the Pasadena Games and might not race again until the
Mt. San Antonio College Relays on April 20.</TE>
<TE>   "He wants to run at Arcadia," Dorsey boys' Coach Ralph Tilley
said. "But he has to show me that he's completely 100% going into
that meet. If he's not, I'm not going to let him run."</TE>
<TE>   Rolison ran 14.29 in the high hurdles last year and clocked a
hand-timed 14.2 in two meets earlier this season.</TE>

<LD>A new face in the local jockey's colony will make his Santa Anita
debut today.</LD>
<LD>   Apprentice Kevin Krigger, who won 54 races to finish in a tie for
fifth at the recently concluded Golden Gate Fields season, is named
on two horses.</LD>
<LD>   The 18-year-old native of the Virgin Islands will ride two
maidens, Bonair Lake for trainer John Sadler in the sixth and Para
Usted for trainer Henry Moreno in the eighth.</LD>
<TE>   The door is certainly open for an apprentice to shine during the
remaining weeks of the Santa Anita meet and when Hollywood Park kicks
off April 24. Elvis Trujillo, who has won 15 races at Santa Anita,
recently returned from injury and will now begin a suspension Friday
for misuse of the whip in Saturday's second race.</TE>
<TE>   After rushing Hushed Victory to the lead in the $10,000 claimer
and opening up through fast fractions (45 2/5 for the half-mile),
Trujillo continued to whip Hushed Victory even after the 6-year-old
had been passed and clearly had nothing more to give. Hushed Victory
fell at the top of the stretch and had to be euthanized, reportedly
because of an ankle injury.</TE>
<TE>   A more established jockey will be at Lone Star Park tonight to
help the Grand Prairie, Texas, track begin its 70-day meet.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Bailey, the country's perennial leading rider, will have
mounts in four races, including Lights On Broadway in the $50,000
Premiere Stakes, a mile contest restricted to Texas-breds.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Mon Ange shortens up to her preferred
game--sprinting--and will meet sharpies such as Whoopddoo, Our Here
Tiz and Skywriting in today's seventh at Santa Anita. The $57,000
optional claimer drew seven entrants and will be run at 61/2
furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot:  Cole Norman. The trainer is the runaway leader in the
trainer standings at Oaklawn Park. He started the new week with 36
wins, 16 more than runner-up Stanley Roberts.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not:  James McCoy. The trainer is one for 47 at Oaklawn.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick all singling Lady Eddie in the first,
Tiger Trap in the second, and Our Man Red in the third, using High
Counselor and Sir Maskalot in the fourth, Main Street Rub and Kickin
Clover in the fifth, Wagon and Enorme in the sixth, Mon Ange and
Whoopddoo in the seventh and Morning Wine and Politarium in the
eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/196. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $3.80/$1,158. Total money bet: $1,218.</TE>

<HD>A Penalty-Kill Collapse</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It doesn't get any easier.</LD>
<LD>   Winless in five games, their penalty-killing unit in disarray, the
Kings tonight play the Detroit Red Wings, owners of the NHL's best
record and No. 2 power play.</LD>
<LD>   Three times in their last four games, the Kings have given up
three power-play goals--in a 4-0 loss to the Vancouver Canucks, a 5-3
loss to the Calgary Flames and Tuesday night's 4-4 tie against the
Canucks.</LD>
<TE>   This after leading the league in penalty killing for most of the
season and giving up more than two power-play goals only once in 72
games.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think we have to get back to our confident, aggressive
style that we played all year," assistant coach Mark Hardy, who
oversees what is now the league's No. 6 penalty-killing unit, said
Wednesday. "I think it comes down to hard work, stops and starts, and
keeping it as simple as we can and putting pressure on teams....</TE>
<TE>   "Our style is to be aggressive and that's why we were successful
all year and that's probably a change we're going to have to make,
especially against teams that move the puck so well. If you give them
time to set up, they're going to score goals against you."</TE>
<TE>   It hasn't helped that goaltender Felix Potvin, described by Coach
Andy Murray as the Kings' No. 1 penalty killer, has not been
particularly sharp during a 0-3-2 slide that has loosened the team's
grip on a playoff slot.</TE>
<TE>   Potvin's 3.79 goals-against average and .859 save percentage
during the winless streak are far off his season numbers of 2.34 and
.906.</TE>
<TE>   Murray intimated that he had pondered making a switch to backup
Jamie Storr, then said he hadn't seriously considered it. Still, he
met with Potvin to gauge the goaltender's psyche and reassure him
that he was still the starter.</TE>
<TE>   "I brought him in to tell him, 'You're the guy,' " Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>

<HD>Jokes Aside, Kwan Looks to the Future</HD>
<DH>Skating: She's laughing off Olympic barbs and considering
hiring a coach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michelle Kwan has heard the jokes and the jabs.</LD>
<LD>   The popular TV sitcom "Will and Grace" went for laughs at her
expense recently when Will, assuming Kwan would win the figure
skating gold medal at the Salt Lake City Olympics, gave his parents
tickets for a cruise featuring skating lessons from Kwan. After her
third-place finish, the title characters disparaged the gift.</LD>
<LD>   "It seemed like a bigger deal when we bought the package," Grace
said.</LD>
<TE>   Even worse, ESPN listed Kwan among the biggest chokers in sports
because she fell in her Olympic long program and won the bronze medal
behind U.S. compatriot Sarah Hughes and Russia's Irina Slutskaya.</TE>
<TE>   Some barbs sting, but Kwan tries to laugh them off while pondering
whether to continue a career in which she has won a U.S.-record seven
medals at the world championships, six U.S. titles, Olympic silver in
1998 and bronze at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it's a compliment," Kwan said of being the butt of
jokes in non-sports media. "If they didn't think the audience would
know who I am, they wouldn't use my name. It would be 'Kwan who?
What?'</TE>
<TE>   "I was talking to Serena Williams about it, and she told me you
know you've made it when you're in the National Enquirer. That's how
I have to look at it. It's foolish. They don't understand what's
involved and how many other triples I did."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking by phone Wednesday from Daytona Beach, Fla., where she
prepared to begin the four-month John Hancock Champions on Ice tour,
the 21-year-old Torrance native said she will spend the next few
months reevaluating her season and her future. However, she has
decided to hire a coach if she remains in Olympic-eligible
competitions, with that coach possibly doubling as a choreographer.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan fired longtime coach Frank Carroll last October, saying she
needed to take control of her skating. Her father, Danny, accompanied
her to competitions but both said he wasn't coaching her.</TE>
<TE>   After some unusual missteps, she seemed to right herself by
winning the U.S. championships at Staples Center in January,
establishing herself as the favorite at Salt Lake City. However, she
fell on her triple flip in her "Sheherezade'' Olympic free skate and
couldn't pull off the triple-triple combination jump that might have
helped maintain the lead she held after the short program. Hughes,
16, rallied from fourth to win on the strength of an animated and
demanding routine.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan performed a triple-triple at last month's World Championships
at Nagano, Japan, but her short program was flawed. She finished
second to Slutskaya.</TE>
<TE>   "For sure, that's my No. 1 concern," Kwan said of hiring a coach.
"Who do I find? There are a lot of things I have to look into if I
want to keep going.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a lot of approaches and I've considered a few. It's in
the works .... I'll talk to a lot of coaches. Finding the right coach
is tough. You might not immediately click. It may take a month or
two. It can definitely make a very big difference. My dad has been
very helpful and supportive, but he doesn't have the background a
coach has."</TE>
<TE>   Kwan, who is close to her family and has homes in Lake Arrowhead
and the South Bay, doesn't want to leave Southern California. Unless
a top-notch coach relocates here, Kwan's choices are limited.</TE>
<TE>   She's unlikely to return to Carroll, who coaches Olympic bronze
medalist and world silver medalist Tim Goebel and U.S. fourth-place
finisher Angela Nikodinov at El Segundo. John Nicks is also out
because he coaches Sasha Cohen of Laguna Niguel, who was second at
the U.S. championships and fourth at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan has had choreography help from Peter Oppegard, who coaches at
the same Torrance rink as her sister, Karen. But he has never coached
an elite skater like Kwan, a four-time world champion.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to move. I want to finish my education at UCLA,"
said Kwan, who has taken classes in Westwood but put school on hold
to train for Salt Lake City. "I have to put everything into
consideration--my school, my family, my skating."</TE>
<TE>   Among her options is reducing her schedule next season, as she did
after the 1998 Olympics, and competing only at the U.S. championships
in Dallas and the World Championships in Washington. She could also
compete in pro-ams sanctioned by the International Skating Union.
Only if she appeared in a non-sanctioned event, such as the Stars on
Ice tour, would she lose her Olympic eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   Whether competing or exploring potential TV, movie or broadcasting
roles through her promotional contract with the Walt Disney Co., Kwan
will plunge in whole-heartedly.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to do anything halfway and sort of stay around for
four years," she said, referring to the 2006 Turin Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make sure it's for the right reasons. I love competing
....</TE>
<TE>   "[Salt Lake City] is going to be part of my life, and you've got
to be able to live with it. It was a big disappointment, but I still
came home with a medal. It all comes down to the slightest mistake.
If I dropped my right arm on the [rotation of] the flip in practice,
I would have tried to learn from that mistake. Unfortunately, it came
at a crucial time. You can't psychoanalyze things. That's the way it
happens.''</TE>

<HD>Rambis Lacerates Leg in Practice</HD>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Laker assistant Kurt Rambis was taken from the floor of Continental
Airlines Arena on a stretcher after suffering a deep cut on his lower
leg before Wednesday night's game against the New Jersey Nets.</LD>
<LD>   He was treated at Meadowlands Hospital and released in time to
join the team as it flew to Boston, where it plays Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Rambis, as is his near daily ritual, was playing a game of
one-on-one against Mark Madsen when he crashed into a row of chairs
on the baseline. His leg apparently was cut by a sharp or pointed
edge on one of the chairs and it began to bleed profusely.</LD>
<TE>   Medical personnel quickly applied pressure bandages and raised the
leg to stem the bleeding. Several minutes later, Rambis, his right
sock and shoe soaked in blood, was lifted to a stretcher and taken to
the hospital, where he received sutures on the muscle and six
stitches on the exterior leg.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he was carried away, Rambis had regained his famous
sense of humor. Appearing pale, strapped to the stretcher and with
his leg raised, Rambis was being rolled from the floor when fellow
assistant Frank Hamblen peered down and said, "Hey, you going to the
hospital?"</TE>
<TE>   "Well," Rambis said with a laugh, "I hope so."</TE>
<TE>   After watching the second half of the game from the locker room,
Rambis boarded the bus without help, though with a pronounced limp.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant said his relationship with Michael Jordan has evolved
since the days he often called for guidance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's changed," Bryant said. "It's more to the point we talk to
each other to see how we're doing. In the past, I used his advice to
get me out of difficult situations. Now, I'm on my own, I guess."</TE>

<HD>O'Neal's Wrist Is Latest Cause for Concern</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Center misses Lakers' 94-92 loss to the
Nets and says he doesn't know what's wrong.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal has what team medical personnel suspect is a
sprained right wrist, a grim accessory to his arthritic big toe, so
he did not play for the Lakers against the New Jersey Nets on
Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   And while the immediate impact was a thoroughly entertaining game
that concluded in a 94-92 defeat, there is, of course, the grander
scale to consider. That is, the Lakers' chances of a third
consecutive championship and O'Neal's rather central role in it. How
involved the Nets are in that remains to be seen, though they are
accomplished enough to lead the Eastern Conference and game enough to
bring out one of Kobe Bryant's most enduring games.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant led the Lakers from 19 points back to eight points ahead,
from dismal to remarkable with fantastic charisma.</LD>
<TE>   He balled his fists and tightened his jaw and nearly paralyzed the
Nets, and their fans at a sold-out Continental Airlines Arena pointed
and sighed at what Bryant could do, struck by how desperately he
would play without O'Neal. He scored 33 points with 11 Lakers on his
back, including 15 points in the third quarter, when he scared the
stink right out of the swamp.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Lakers lost, and the only thing that mattered as they
poked through this end-to-end affair was O'Neal, whose wrist turned
up injured when he awoke Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   As he trudged through the hallway, toward a bus that would take
them all away from their second loss in eight games, secured when
Bryant's put-back at the buzzer hit the heel of the rim and after Net
Coach Byron Scott nearly fainted at the sight of Bryant so close to
tying the score, O'Neal had no answers about a wrist too sore to
hinge.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what's wrong with it," he said. "I couldn't lift
it."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers will have O'Neal undergo diagnostic tests today in
Boston, where the team was to fly after the game. He was examined by
two Net physicians in the afternoon, and they apparently recommended
he not play.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought both must have had points on the game," Laker Coach
Phil Jackson said with a tight smile.</TE>
<TE>   According to Laker officials, the arena had no X-ray facilities.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said he broke both of his wrists as a child, and that those
felt much worse than this. He agreed that he probably would be able
to play sooner rather than later, which would be a good thing for the
Lakers, because they are running out of regular season.</TE>
<TE>   The playoffs are scheduled to begin two weeks from Saturday,
technically when their three-peat bid begins in earnest. It very
likely just got harder. The Laker loss and the Sacramento King win in
Detroit put the Lakers three losses behind in the Pacific Division
with seven games to play, and it is possible O'Neal hasn't missed his
final game, for toe or wrist.</TE>
<TE>   "Concerned?" Jackson repeated. "Yes."</TE>
<TE>   The popular notion is O'Neal was injured when he tumbled over the
first row of seats at Staples Center on Friday, but O'Neal could not
confirm that. At this point, the Lakers assume O'Neal will reoccupy
the lane when asked, or when absolutely necessary. They play again
Friday in Boston, then Sunday in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq has had so many injuries," Bryant said. "When we need him to
play, he'll suck it up and play."</TE>
<TE>   It was the general assessment in a locker room weary from the
back-to-back games. Half of their 22 losses have come in the second
of such series, but perhaps none quite so dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   Overrun by a full-court, trapping press, the Lakers trailed by
51-32 in the second quarter and 55-40 at halftime, when the Nets
spent more time at the rim than a Grand Canyon tour bus.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bryant returned to the floor with an oddly confident
demeanor, and he shook his fist as he passed center court. He then
made seven of 10 shots in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Two minutes into the fourth quarter, the Lakers caught the Nets at
76-76, and then led, 78-76, a minute later on a Devean George layup.</TE>
<TE>   Though Jackson said he expected the press, Bryant said, "We
weren't ready for a full-court press, the trapping. It took us a
while to get adjusted."</TE>
<TE>   In a timeout in the final moments, behind by 94-91 with 5.4
seconds left, Jackson gave the Lakers the option of a three or a fast
two and a foul.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox took a pass from Robert Horry and went straight to the
rim, where the layup did not fall, but he was fouled by Kenyon
Martin.</TE>
<TE>   With 2.5 seconds left, Fox made the first free throw, missed the
second intentionally, and the crowd gasped when Bryant sneaked along
the baseline, caught the rebound and was long with the putback from a
foot or two.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant believed he was fouled by Jason Kidd, but hardly
complained.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, they could have larger problems if O'Neal's injury
proves serious. Already hindered by an arthritic big toe since the
start of the season, O'Neal appeared to be gaining mobility in recent
games.</TE>
<TE>   He had 18 rebounds against the Washington Wizards on Tuesday
night, as new shoes and orthotics have helped ease his pain.</TE>

<HD>Trainer Ortiz Has Inside Track on Longshots</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Bob Mieszerski</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When heading to Los Alamitos, longshot players are advised to pay
attention to trainer Curley Ortiz. He has struck with several
big-priced winners at the meet, most notably The Risque Rebel ($39),
The Shy Rebel ($24), Wizard Of Easton ($28.20), Duncan Easy ($22.80)
and Flj Chasin Time ($22.40).</LD>
<LD>   Some members of the Ortiz barn will be running tonight. Would She,
a daughter of Candyman Bee owned by Ed Allred, will make her debut in
the first, an 870-yard race for older maidens. The lone thoroughbred
in a field of six, Would She will break from post four and will be
ridden by Dennis Means.</LD>
<LD>   A race later, Jerrad's Desire, a 5-year-old gelding, will make his
first start since Dec. 17, 2000, when he faces $5,000 maidens at 41/2
furlongs.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Christine Schendel, the California-bred faced much better
in his lone race at Hollywood Park and worked three furlongs in 35
2/5 at Los Alamitos eight days ago.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz's other starter is Rebas Rythm, who will be a big price in
the seventh after finishing far back at 58-1 on March 14.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Got No Whoa. 2. Pal Casper. 3. Go Green Go. 4. Five
Wishes. 5. Jake Blues. 6. Miss Absolut. 7. Angelos Secret. 8. White
Rule.</TE>
<TE>   Four!  In the fifth, let's use Jake Blues and Character Counts,
single Miss Absolut in the sixth, use Angelos Secret and LDS Splash
Gordon in the seventh and White Rule, Kid Unit, Reed And Right and No
Mas Delor in the eighth. Total cost: $16.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Comes A Storm could improve second time off the
layoff for trainer Chuck Treece in tonight's second as he stretches
out to 41/2 furlongs, and Reed And Right has a pair of thirds and a
second in his last four starts and has a look in a contentious eighth
race.</TE>
<TE>   Post time: 7:15 p.m.</TE>

<DH>As Part of the LPGA's Five-Point Plan to Promote Its Sport,
Players Are Encouraged to Look Their Best</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was in 1981 and Jan Stephenson still remembers the pose. She was
lying on a bed and her nightgown was slit up one side. It must have
been a bit drafty, but Stephenson wore a big smile, if little else.</LD>
<LD>   That was the picture that did it, the one that frosted some of her
fellow players, such as Kathy Whitworth and Jane Blalock, even though
the photo was for the LPGA's magazine and sanctioned by its
commissioner.</LD>
<LD>   "Jane said to me, 'Why are you lowering yourself to sell sex?'"
said Stephenson, who laughed as she recounted the incident. "Jane
asked me recently if I'd consider doing something like that to help
her promote the Women's Senior Golf Tour."</LD>
<TE>   There is a moral to the story, says Stephenson: "Every single
thing is sold with sex, whether you like it or not."</TE>
<TE>   So it goes on the LPGA Tour, where everything old is new again.
While the women's professional golf organization embarks on an
ambitious five-year plan to secure a more favored position in the
sports entertainment arena of a People magazine-Entertainment
Tonight-Best Damn Sports Show Period money-celebrity-fame crazed
society, the main item on the LPGA's agenda is to make the product
more fan-friendly.</TE>
<TE>   And that, you might recall, is where Stephenson came in ... as had
Marlene Bauer Hagge and her sister, Alice Bauer, three decades
earlier when the LPGA was just beginning. They had part of the
equation down pat. They looked terrific--and they could play golf
too.</TE>
<TE>   Stephenson says she cannot forget what then-LPGA commissioner Ray
Volpe told her about appearing in Fairway magazine in that revealing
nightgown.</TE>
<TE>   "He said your golf doesn't speak for itself," she said. "If you
want to see the best golfers in the world, you would watch the men.
If you want to see the best women golfers, then look like women."</TE>
<TE>   Ty Votaw, current LPGA commissioner, would agree with at least
part of what Volpe said long ago. As Votaw points out, most players
have historically believed that all that was really required of
them--and all that should be required of them--is to play golf to the
best of their abilities and everything else would fall neatly in
place for the benefit of the LPGA.</TE>
<TE>   "Our fans are telling us that that's not the case, that they have
to do more than just play great golf," Votaw said.</TE>
<TE>   As a part of the first, long-range strategic planning session in
its 52-year history, the LPGA identified several short-term goals to
promote the sport. The LPGA wants to increase television viewership
10% each year of the five-year plan and also wants to boost
tournament attendance by 15% each year.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 31 events on this year's schedule, 25 offer at least $1
million in prize money, 13 more than two years ago. Votaw's goal for
2003 is that every tournament has a purse of at least $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   What Votaw came up with is something called the "Five Points of
Celebrity," as outlined in his five-year plan, which he revealed to
the LPGA members in a players-only summit nearly a month ago in
Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Performance is the first point and is the key, said Votaw, but it
cannot be the only factor and must be considered along with the other
four: approachability, joy and passion, relevance and appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Appearance? It's not just ironing golf shirts and shining your
shoes; it's Grace Park revealing her navel when she swings or Carin
Koch's short shorts or Jill McGill's legs. And is that bad? Not
anymore, apparently.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see anything wrong with it," said Juli Inkster, 41 and a
mother of two girls. "When I go out, I watch the best-looking guy
players. It's like, if you've got it, you've got it.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've got the body to do it, go for it. I wish I did.
Remember this: We're still in the entertainment business."</TE>
<TE>   Or, as Votaw said, "Right or wrong, society has decided that it's
important to be attractive, [and] if we're just about being pro
golfers, then our players will not reach their potential."</TE>
<TE>   Annika Sorenstam is a great player but not particularly outgoing.
She said she would do her best to try to improve but that she will
not and cannot be anyone but herself. Votaw said he does not ask that
of any player, least of all Sorenstam, his top card.</TE>
<TE>   Said Votaw: "I'm not asking for contrived fist pumps." He said he
told the players at the summit that they all embody the five points,
that some are stronger in some areas than others. Those five points
are "critical for our young players in order to become more
marketable," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The players seem to be very much on board the ship Votaw is
sailing, and he's got their full attention. They sign more
autographs, they do more print and television interviews. Michelle
McGann was nearly in the locker room after shooting an 84 during the
Kraft Nabisco Championship before a Palm Springs TV reporter asked
her to return to the scoring area for an interview. She complied,
with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN is the major television carrier of the LPGA Tour, and the
network's director of programming, Kelly LaFerriere, isn't sure
simply emphasizing sex appeal is the way to go.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're committed to build stars based on their athletic
ability," she said. "I think whether it's male or female sports, we
need to focus on athletic ability and the stories behind the athletes
to build recognition."</TE>
<TE>   In golfer Helen Alfredsson's opinion, revealing something of
yourself in an interview--providing material for the kinds of stories
LaFerriere is talking about--is as vital as revealing something of
yourself with your choice of wardrobe. Say something interesting, not
necessarily what iron you hit to the green or how your putting is
going, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have to say who you're sleeping with," said Alfredsson,
36. "Most of the things I hear our players say in interviews is so
boring, I want to go to sleep."</TE>
<TE>   It's possible we're seeing a honeymoon period between the players
and the media, but even if that's true, many players are not the
least bit reluctant to speak out about the sensitive issue of how you
look.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to stop Madison Avenue," said Amy Alcott, 46.
"Sex sells. That's not exactly a bulletin. Now, I don't think it
should be the only focal point. Look, if you're an attractive woman
golfer, there's nothing wrong with it. If you have the combination
and it works, fine.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of times there were players bending over in their skirts and
their pictures were on the front page and I would say to myself,
'Amy, don't worry about that. Let your clubs do the talking.' Like I
say, there's nothing wrong with selling sex on the tour, but it can't
be the focal point or you're setting the tour back."</TE>
<TE>   The LPGA seems to be positioned somewhere between the WNBA and the
Women's Tennis Assn., when it comes to marketing its players.</TE>
<TE>   It's only six years old, but the WNBA has made its mark as a
grass-roots league with a solid fan-friendly base. The league
estimates that 28% of its arena audience is under 18 and that 78% of
that sample is female.</TE>
<TE>   "You market to women differently than men," said Traci Cook,
senior director for corporate communications for the WNBA.</TE>
<TE>   "Our fans, young girls and older women, often their moms, they
like to look at the whole person. Like, what do they look like when
they're not playing. What do they look like in clothes?</TE>
<TE>   "Women like to see what other women wear. And a lot of our players
like to dress up."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike tennis or even golf, where players choose their own
clothes, women's professional basketball players play their games in
uniforms. As Cook said, there is only one place to see how they look
in normal clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "Women and young girls want to see them off the court," she said.
"And anyone who is representing the corporate community, you want
them to look appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   But there is always room for self-expression, which helps
marketing the WNBA as well, Cook said. In the April issue of Self
magazine, Lisa Leslie of the Sparks, the league's most valuable
player, is photographed in a swimsuit at a spa.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, women's tennis is nowhere near as subdued in the
marketing of its athletes.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, tennis professional Vanessa Menga, 25, recently
posed for a pictorial in the Brazilian edition of Playboy. Menga is
ranked No. 394 in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's fans expect athletes to be more than athletic," Jim
Fuhse, director of player promotions for the WTA, said in the book
about the women's tour called "Venus Envy."</TE>
<TE>   "We're never going to stop selling sex."</TE>
<TE>   In that case, women's tennis has the best opportunity, since
players are free to wear as little as they dare. Anna Kournikova has
not won a tournament, but she's a champion in marketing products and
has used her allure to become the top pitchman in the sport.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, the WTA prints a calendar with photos of its top
players. However, Chris DeMaria, vice president of communications of
the WTA Tour, says no one is being forced to look or act in any way
she doesn't want.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not asking them to do bikini shots," DeMaria said. "I don't
think it hurts at all to be physically attractive and be a top
player. We don't tell our players how to dress. We have some who
aren't into the fashion side, frankly. You wear what you want to
wear.</TE>
<TE>   "Some players, like Venus [Williams] and Serena [Williams], they
are both fashion students, and their sponsors ... can be more on the
cutting edge with them."</TE>
<TE>   The same was true last year at the U.S. Open, where Ashley
Harkleroad wore clothes that were obviously very progressive and
revealing and worked for her.</TE>
<TE>   Harkleroad, 16, caused a sensation when she wore very tight shorts
and a midriff-baring top, although she lost in the first round. At
Wimbledon, she won the girls' doubles title with Argentina's Gisella
Dulko.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's good for the game if you have a well-rounded
package, that you're physically attractive and a great player,"
DeMaria said. "If you have that combination, you can market it.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't oversell it, though. And I do have to applaud the LPGA
for going in that direction. That's going to help their sport."</TE>
<TE>   Donna Lopiano of the Women's Sports Foundation says the LPGA's
five points of celebrity have been standard in media training for
athletes for decades, though she questions the focus on one
particular issue.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the media is obsessed with stereotype appearances,"
Lopiano said. "Who cares what a [PGA Tour] guy wears? A shirt with a
collar and a pair of slacks. Women golfers dress on the range of
that, to absolute fashion. I think the women on tour have a much
tougher time dressing.</TE>
<TE>   "At the Academy Awards, nobody gives a worst-dressed award to a
guy. He's in a tux. Women, it's entirely different."</TE>
<TE>   Lopiano also said that if the LPGA is marketing sex appeal, it may
be in over its head.</TE>
<TE>   "You're talking about well-traveled, professional, public figures
and impressions and appearances are very important."</TE>
<TE>   Golfer Kris Tschetter says she feels comfortable with the way she
is perceived, which is as one of the most attractive women on the
LPGA Tour. She made the list that Playboy.com included in an on-line
poll of which players the readers would most like to see without golf
clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Tschetter, 37 and married, enjoys the celebrity aspect of her job.</TE>
<TE>   "I do know that it's hard for some people to be approachable," she
said. "You try to look your best. Maybe there's a handful of players
who don't want to agree with that, for whatever reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've got a good body, let's face it, your approval rating
goes up.... It's the same with any guy. If a guy is good-looking, his
approval rating goes up. Maybe it's not fair, but you can't ignore
it."</TE>
<TE>   Tschetter says it's harder for golfers to look great in comparison
to other female athletes because they're generally older.</TE>
<TE>   "Every other sport just about has teenagers playing their games,
and they look great," she said. "People don't get to be 35 and play
except in this sport. But I won't go so far as to call it 'sex
appeal.' It has to be 'appeal.'</TE>
<TE>   Lorie Kane, 37, says she wants to be referred to as an athletic
person who plays golf. She agrees with what Votaw has been saying,
that if the primary focus of the new LPGA's plan is on sex appeal,
"that doesn't last very long."</TE>
<TE>   McGill, a 6-foot USC graduate, is 30 and enjoys skiing, piano,
tennis, movies, throwing darts, singing in the shower, jumping over
rose gardens and dancing. Posing for Playboy might be next, although
she isn't saying. Koch won the Internet poll and isn't interested in
posing for the magazine; runner-up McGill is still considering it.
"I'm not automatically ruling it out," she said.</TE>
<TE>   That's a wise move, says Stephenson, who talked with McGill last
week about the Playboy offer. "Jill asked me if it would hurt the
LPGA and I said, 'Don't be silly. It's a five-day shoot and it's
going to make you famous.'" Now 50, Stephenson doesn't play as many
LPGA events as she used to, only 19 in 2001, but she will tee it up
this week at the Office Depot Championship at El Caballero and
continue her work as honorary chairman of the National Multiple
Sclerosis Society.</TE>
<TE>   Stephenson never appeared in a Playboy pictorial, though she says
she turned down a $150,000 offer. But she did pose for a series of
provocative photos for calendars as a promotion for Dunlop.</TE>
<TE>   The most famous is of Stephenson sitting in a giant tub of golf
balls. She says she was clothed in the tub, but only slightly,
wearing "two little round things and a little triangle." More than
250,000 copies of that calendar were sold with the proceeds going to
charity.</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, Volpe figured things like that were worth 25,000 extra
people a day in the gallery," Stephenson said. "I have no doubt it
was all true."</TE>
<TE>   The LPGA, taking from its past and looking toward its future, has
its five-year strategic plan in place. It's going to take at least
that long to figure out what's gone right, or wrong.</TE>

<HD>Webber Lets His Play Do All the Talking</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Webber's plan worked out perfectly.</LD>
<LD>   Before the game, Webber didn't want to talk about allegations that
he received a lot of money from a booster before turning pro--and he
didn't. He wanted to dominate during it--and he did.</LD>
<LD>   Webber had 28 points, eight assists, seven rebounds and two
blocks, and the Sacramento Kings defeated the Detroit Pistons,
107-86, Wednesday night at Auburn Hills, Mich.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't play with anger," Webber said. "I played with focus."</TE>
<TE>   Webber has been the focus of questions and commentary since a
federal indictment was released two weeks ago that alleged he
received $280,000 from ex-Michigan booster Ed Martin while he was at
Detroit Country Day High and Michigan. Fallasha Erwin, Webber's
agent, said Wednesday that Webber took small gifts and spending money
from Martin but nothing close to the thousands of dollars alleged by
prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Most fans booed and berated Webber--in part because he didn't sign
with Detroit as a free agent last summer--and that only seemed to
motivate him even more.</TE>
<TE>   "Jon Barry told me, 'I wish they hadn't gotten you upset,' because
he was with me for three years," Webber said. "I had some extra
incentive to play for. The worst thing you can do is wake a sleeping
giant. Not that I'm all that great, but when my back is to the wall,
I do come out fighting."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings maintained the best record in the league by winning
their sixth in a row and ninth of 10. They set a franchise record
with their sixth consecutive road victory and matched franchise marks
for victories (55) and road victories (22).</TE>
<TE>   The Central Division-leading Pistons had won nine of 11. Corliss
Williamson scored 13, Jerry Stackhouse had 12 and Ben Wallace had 12
points, 11 rebounds and two blocks.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 97, Miami 90--Baron Davis and Jamal Mashburn each scored
22 points for the Hornets at Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Miami has lost seven of eight. The Heat fell to 32-42,
guaranteeing Pat Riley his first losing season in 20 seasons as a
coach.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 117, Chicago 104--Morris Peterson scored 26 points and
Antonio Davis had 25 at Toronto, and the Raptors won their sixth in a
row without Vince Carter.</TE>
<TE>   The Raptors moved within a half-game of Indiana for the eighth and
final playoff spot in the East. Two of Toronto's final eight games
are against the Pacers.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 89, Phoenix 83--Aaron McKie tied the score at the end
of regulation, then scored eight of his 22 points in overtime to lead
the 76ers at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Stephon Marbury scored 27 points for the Suns, who were eliminated
from playoff contention by Utah's victory.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 90, Seattle 88--Tony Parker made a 16-foot jump shot
with 7.1 seconds to play to lift the Spurs at San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Duncan had 30 points and 18 rebounds for the Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle tied the score, 88-88, on a jump shot by Jerome James with
1:52 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 92, Memphis 81--Chauncey Billups had 26 points, 11
rebounds and 10 assists at Minneapolis, and Minnesota secured a
playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 105, Washington 90--Glenn Robinson tied his season high
with 38 points for the Bucks at Milwaukee.</TE>

<HD>Jordan Has an Early End to His Season</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Wizard star's right knee is slow to recover
from Feb. 27 arthroscopic surgery. He vows to return to the court
next season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A day after his worst scoring game ever, Michael Jordan woke up with
a swollen right knee and decided enough was enough.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan was put on the injured list Wednesday by the Washington
Wizards, and he said he is done for the season.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it is best at this point to rest the knee and let it heal
properly," Jordan said in a statement. "I tried to get back and play
as soon as possible and, early on, the knee responded well. But after
the swelling this morning, I think it's best to give it rest."</LD>
<TE>   Jordan ends his season with a 22.9-point scoring average, the
second lowest of his career. He averaged 22.7 in his second season
with the Chicago Bulls in 1985-86, when played only 18 games because
of a broken foot.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the Wizards overtake Indiana for the last Eastern
Conference berth in the final two weeks of the season, Jordan will
have played for his first non-playoff team.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, 39, reiterated he plans to play next season if he is able.</TE>
<TE>   "I signed a two-year contract to play," Jordan said. "Obviously,
my health will always determine my playing status. But at this time,
my plan is to play next season."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan rushed his rehabilitation from the arthroscopic surgery
Feb. 27 for torn cartilage in the knee. He sat out only 12 games and
returned March 20 in Denver. He was a reserve in all seven games
after he came back, and his knee bothered him so much that he wasn't
able to play unless he pedaled an exercise bicycle in the tunnel
during games.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Doug Collins said he went to see Jordan Tuesday night before
the game against the Lakers and noticed that Jordan's knee was
swollen.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even want him to play last night," Collins said, "and
you know Michael being the competitor that he is said, 'I want to
give it a whirl or whatever' and I said OK.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I got the call this afternoon that he recognizes the fact
that the only way that knee is going to get better is to rest. And
what he said to me was he's going to shut it down, let the thing
heal, get the inflammation out of there. And whether that's six weeks
or eight weeks or whatever it might be.</TE>
<TE>   "And he's doing it with the idea that he wants to play next year."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan played a career-low 12 minutes and scored a career-low two
points in the 113-93 loss to the Lakers.</TE>

<HD>Texans Will Pick Carr No. 1</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Houston Texans know the ultimate success for most National
Football League teams lies at quarterback.</LD>
<LD>   So when the expansion Texans make the first selection in the NFL
draft April 20, they will choose Fresno State quarterback David Carr.
That announcement, unusual in that it came more than two weeks before
the draft, was made Wednesday by owner Bob McNair, although the
decision was reached by General Manager Charley Casserly and Coach
Dom Capers.</LD>
<LD>   "To win, you have to have a good quarterback. Charley and his
people have looked at this long and hard," McNair said. "We know
enough about Carr that we feel like we know who he is."</LD>
<TE>   In 37 games at Fresno State, Carr completed 62.8% of his passes
for 7,849 yards. He threw 70 touchdown passes and had 23 passes
intercepted. As a starter, he had an 18-8 record.</TE>
<TE>   As a senior, Carr led the nation with 4,308 yards passing and 42
touchdown passes, becoming only the sixth quarterback in NCAA history
to throw for more than 4,000 yards and more than 40 touchdown passes
in the same season.</TE>
<TE>   He led the Bulldogs to an 11-2 record last season.</TE>
<TE>   Carr finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting and won the
Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award as the nation's top senior
quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Lional Dalton, who played for Baltimore in its
Super Bowl victory two seasons ago, has signed a $22-million,
seven-year contract with Denver. The deal was reached two weeks ago,
Dalton's agent Steve Weinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago matched a $2.85-million, three-year offer sheet made last
week by Minnesota to receiver D'Wayne Bates. The deal will cost
Chicago $1.1 million against the salary cap this year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carolina quarterback Chris Weinke is still bothered by a sore
throwing shoulder and surgery remains an option.</TE>
<TE>   Weinke said any procedure on his right shoulder would be minor and
he expected to be on the field in time for Carolina's next minicamp.</TE>
<TE>   Basketball</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca Lobo, a star on Connecticut's first unbeaten national
champion, was traded by the WNBA's New York Liberty to the Houston
Comets for a second-round draft choice.</TE>
<TE>   Lobo has been plagued by knee injuries the last few seasons. She
appeared in 16 games last season.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Morris, an 11-year NBA veteran, signed with the ABA's
Southern California Surf. He had been playing with the Harlem
Globetrotters.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Andre Agassi was the first pick in the World Team Tennis draft at
New York and was assigned to the Sacramento Capitals.</TE>
<TE>   The rights to John McEnroe were retained by the New York Hamptons,
owned by brother Patrick.</TE>
<TE>   Other top players drafted included Lindsay Davenport, whose rights
were traded by the St. Louis Aces to the New York Buzz, who then
drafted Davenport.</TE>
<TE>   The league will play July 8-28.</TE>
<TE>   Soccer</TE>
<TE>   Chris Henderson scored two goals and goalkeeper Scott Garlick
moved into second place on the MLS career victories list as the
Colorado Rapids beat D.C. United, 2-0, at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Garlick moved ahead of Mark Dougherty with his 66th career victory
and is one behind career leader Zach Thornton of Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Henderson scored in the 44th minute, beating goalie Nick Rimando
inside the right post from 25 yards, and in the 89th minute.</TE>
<TE>   The Women's United Soccer Assn. said its second title game will be
held Aug. 24 at Atlanta's Herndon Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Included in the announcement that Bob Costas has signed a new
three-year contract with HBO was that he will become a cohost of
"Inside the NFL." That means the departure of Len Dawson, Nick
Buonoconti and Jerry Glanville. Dawson had been with the show for 24
years and Buonoconti for 23.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Clinton died from blunt head and neck injuries when he
crashed March 1 during practice for the Nextel 250 Grand Am series
race the next day at Homestead-Miami Speedway, an autopsy report
said.</TE>
<TE>   He was wearing a head-and-neck restraint.</TE>
<TE>   His car veered off the course as he entered Turn 1 and flipped
repeatedly. His head was severed at the base of the skull, said the
report by Miami-Dade County Associate Medical Examiner Mark Shuman.</TE>
<TE>   Sydney's Olympic organizing committee closed the books on the 2000
Summer Games with a $51-million loss after an unexpected $47-million
payment to the Australian Olympic Committee, it said in its final
report.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, before Sydney was awarded the Games, Sydney's bid
committee predicted a surplus of $15 million on revenue of $975
million. Ticketing, opening and closing ceremonies and the Internet
were among items that cost more than predicted.</TE>
<TE>   Technology, which cost $205 million, was the largest single
expense for Sydney organizers, although it was down from the $219
million spent by organizers of the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   The Ice Dogs lost to the San Diego Gulls, 2-0, at the Long Beach
Arena. Despite the loss, the Ice Dogs wrapped up second place and
will have home-ice advantage when the playoffs start next week.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>That extra point could go a long way for St. Louis in a tight playoff
chase. It has already provided a big boost.</LD>
<LD>   Pavol Demitra scored 2:29 into overtime to give St. Louis a 2-1
win over the Stars Wednesday night at Dallas. The victory pushed the
Blues from the eighth place--which goes to the final playoff team--to
sixth in the Western Conference standings.</LD>
<LD>   The Blues already had earned a point by getting to overtime, but
the extra point for winning pushed them past Edmonton and the Kings
in the Western Conference. St. Louis has 88 points, one more than the
Kings and Oilers.</LD>
<TE>   Colorado 6, Atlanta 0--At Denver, Steven Reinprecht had three
goals, and Patrick Roy posted his NHL-leading ninth shutout of the
season and 61st of his career.</TE>
<TE>   With five games remaining, Colorado moved three points ahead of
San Jose in the race to be the No. 2-seeded team in the Western
Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Nashville 3, Chicago 1--At Chicago, former Blackhawk Steve
Dubinsky recorded his first two-goal game in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   Denis Arkhipov scored his team-leading 20th goal for the
Predators, who ended a winless streak at five games. In its last 15
games, Nashville is 2-10-3.</TE>
<TE>   New York Islanders 1, Buffalo 1--The Islanders' Shawn Bates, his
face bloodied by a high stick, scored with 6:10 remaining at Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Osgood stopped 34 shots, improving to 5-1-1 in his last
seven starts, as the Islanders maintained their sixth-place position
in the Eastern Conference, one point ahead of New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 4, Tampa Bay 1--Sylvain Cote scored his first goal in
50 games, and Peter Bondra scored twice as the Capitals won at
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The Capitals are tied with Montreal for the final Eastern
Conference playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 3, Carolina 2--Jamie Langenbrunner's 13th goal of the

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One long, wild inning turned Kerry Wood's season debut into more of a
preview.</LD>
<LD>   Wood struck out 10 batters in five innings and Sammy Sosa hit his
first home run, and the Chicago Cubs defeated the Cincinnati Reds,
10-3, Wednesday night at Cincinnati.</LD>
<LD>   Wood (1-0) came out for a pinch-hitter in the sixth inning because
he had thrown 104 pitches on a cold night. The right-hander threw 34
in the second inning, only 14 for strikes.</LD>
<TE>   "We made him throw a lot of pitches," Red third baseman Aaron
Boone said. "He's one of those pitchers that it's no fun going out to
face, especially on a night like this. We were able to scratch a
couple of runs together, and then he settled in."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for Wood, by the time he settled down, it was time
to go.</TE>
<TE>   "I started out the way I wanted, but I came out in the second
inning and the walks hurt," said Wood, who walked four. "I was able
to get it back together and go from there."</TE>
<TE>   The lopsided game got heated in the ninth, when Red reliever Luis
Pineda hit two batters and was ejected by plate umpire Mike Everitt.
Both benches and bullpens emptied, but the players did nothing more
than mill about for a few minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 6, Montreal 5--A.J. Burnett (1-0) took a shutout into the
eighth inning, and Derrek Lee hit a grand slam for Florida in front
of 4,779 at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 6-1, in the ninth, the Expos scored four runs behind
homers by Michael Barrett and Vladimir Guerrero.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 3, Atlanta 1--Vicente Padilla (1-0) pitched six
strong innings in his first major league start and Pat Burrell hit a
solo home run and scored twice at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves' Gary Sheffield homered for the second consecutive
game.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 5, New York 3--Pokey Reese drove in three runs at New
York, two after an error by Gold Glove second baseman Roberto Alomar
in the sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Mo Vaughn hit his 300th career home run and his first in the
National League.</TE>
<TE>   Aramis Ramirez drove in two runs for the Pirates and Kip Wells
(1-0) gave up two runs and four hits in five innings. Mike Williams
pitched a perfect ninth for the save.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 15, Milwaukee 2--Daryle Ward homered during an eight-run
fourth inning and finished with four runs batted in at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Ward, who got a starting job in the outfield when Moises Alou
signed with the Cubs in the off-season, tied a career high with three
hits. He also had a double.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 6, St. Louis 3--Denny Neagle (1-0) gave up one run and
five hits in six innings, and Larry Walker hit a three-run home run
for the Rockies at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Garrett Stephenson (0-1), coming off reconstructive elbow surgery,
had a rocky return to the rotation for the Cardinals. He gave up six
runs and six hits in four innings in 45-degree weather.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 8, Arizona 7--D'Angelo Jimenez's single drove in the
go-ahead run and Phil Nevin doubled in two more in the ninth inning
at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego catcher Wiki Gonzalez fractured a bone in his left wrist
when he fouled off a pitch and will be sidelined six to eight weeks.</TE>

<DH>College football: Northwestern angers family by naming
supplement providers as co-defendants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Insisting that football player Rashidi Wheeler played a role in his
own death, Northwestern University on Wednesday named the makers and
sellers of two dietary supplements as their co-defendants in the
wrongful death suit.</LD>
<LD>   Wheeler's family has accused the university of negligence,
contending it was ill-equipped to handle an emergency situation when
Wheeler, a 22-year-old starting strong safety, collapsed and died
Aug. 3 after a series of rigorous conditioning sprints. Bronchial
asthma was listed as the cause of Wheeler's death.</LD>
<LD>   But toxicology reports also showed Wheeler had two dietary
supplements containing the NCAA-banned stimulant ephedrine in his
system. University officials say this is what ultimately killed him.</LD>
<TE>   "Our lawsuit contends Rashidi Wheeler died from cardiac arrhythmia
because he took supplements containing ephedrine before his workout,"
Northwestern spokesman Alan Cubbage said.</TE>
<TE>   Cook County Circuit Court Judge Kathy Flanagan's decision
Wednesday to grant Northwestern permission to add the third-party
defendants means that if a jury were to rule Northwestern negligent,
it could also determine the percentages of a financial award to be
paid by Northwestern and the supplement providers.</TE>
<TE>   The decision was swiftly criticized by Wheeler family
representatives.</TE>
<TE>   "It's interesting to me that instead of keeping its firm position
of, 'We did nothing wrong,' Northwestern is now saying, 'If we did do
something wrong, we deserve to get some of the money we will lose
from someone else,'" said Tom Demetrio, attorney for Wheeler's
father, George.</TE>
<TE>   Northwestern named Next Proteins Inc., of Carlsbad, Cytodyne
Technologies and General Nutrition Corporation in the suit. Next
Proteins formerly manufactured and distributed Ultimate Punch and
Cytodyne manufactures and distributes Xenadrine RFA-1, the
fat-burning products Wheeler allegedly ingested. Northwestern claims
the supplements were purchased at a General Nutrition store.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Katz, a spokeswoman for New Jersey-based Cytodyne, said she
had not seen the suit, but added, "We are very proud of our product."
David Jenkins, the president of Next Proteins, said his company chose
to stop making its product last year because sales were lacking and
the controversy was escalating.</TE>
<TE>   "We've decided we don't want to be party to that debate any
longer," Jenkins said.</TE>
<TE>   The wrongful death lawsuit also took another turn Wednesday when
it was announced that famed attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. and his
Chicago law partner, Jim Montgomery, have been reinstated as
attorneys for Wheeler's mother, Linda Will.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not just a case with Linda, it's about structural change,
and she wants me involved in every aspect to accomplish that
something extra," Cochran said. "This idea of placing winning above
the well-being of our student-athletes has gotten out of hand. You
can't shade the rules, calling a workout voluntary when it's being
supervised and there are repercussions to not performing well.</TE>
<TE>   "Here we are, on the day spring practice begins, and the NCAA
still hasn't come forward on this issue in eight months since Rashidi
died. We can't sue them, but we can ratchet up a lot of pressure on
them. We can exact change."</TE>
<TE>   Will dropped Cochran in November and replaced him with Larry
Rogers Sr., who Will said was better suited for the case's complex
medical evidence. Rogers said he was stunned by the reversal: "Ms.
Will told me she felt Johnnie would give her case more publicity."</TE>
<TE>   Demetrio, representing Will's ex-husband, said Will is likely to
get what she wants.</TE>
<TE>   "[Rogers'] approach is methodical ... as opposed to the approach
of, 'Give me the microphone, and listen to this, NCAA.' There's no
doubting that Johnnie is high-profile, though, and I do believe Linda
when she says she wants all schools to sit up, take notice and not
let this happen ever again."</TE>

<LD>Ed Arreola's three-run triple capped a four-run seventh inning and
Westminster La Quinta High pulled away from Anaheim Esperanza for a
6-2 victory Wednesday in a semifinal baseball game of the Toyo Tires
National Classic at Cal State Fullerton.</LD>
<LD>   Esperanza had intentionally walked Ian Kennedy in the fifth inning
to get to Arreola, who flied out to left field to end a threat. In
the seventh, the senior center fielder blasted reliever Greg Miller's
fastball to the wall in right field to clear the bases. He had four
runs batted in.</LD>
<LD>   La Quinta will face La Puente Bishop Amat, a 12-4 winner over
Placentia El Dorado, at 7 tonight at Cal State Fullerton. It is the
first time in three National Classic appearances that La Quinta
(15-1), No. 5 in The Times' regional rankings, has made the final.</LD>
<TE>   Kennedy (6-0), La Quinta's ace, struck out 11 and gave up two
unearned runs during the complete-game victory to reduce his
0.47earned-run average even more.</TE>
<TE>   In the other National Classic semifinal:</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Amat 12, Placentia El Dorado 4--Andrew Soto went four for
four and drove in three runs as the No. 2 Lancers (12-2) blasted the
No. 14 El Dorado (11-4).</TE>

<DH>With a Roster of All-Stars, Detroit Is Cup Favorite, Hands
Down</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It must be nice being the Detroit Red Wings and Coach Scotty Bowman.</LD>
<LD>   In a season where parity has been a way of life in the NHL,
Bowman's crew of Red Wing All-Stars has sailed through the league as
if it was playing pick-up teams every night.</LD>
<LD>   Detroit, which last month clinched home ice throughout the
playoffs, has been on cruise control since the All-Star break, and
the Red Wings' 114 points are 18 more than Boston, the second-best
team in the league.</LD>
<TE>   "They have lots of talent with hard-core leadership," said King
Coach Andy Murray, whose team will face the Red Wings tonight at
Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody always talks about all of the horses Scotty has to work
with," Murray added, "but he's done an amazing job of keeping
everyone happy and focused on the team goal."</TE>
<TE>   And that hasn't gone unnoticed with Bowman's players.</TE>
<TE>   "You go on any team in any sport that has this many stars and that
would be really hard to handle," said Red Wing forward Luc
Robitaille. "But he's made it click. The thing about Scotty is that
he really doesn't talk much. There are times when he doesn't come on
the ice for practices for a week or two. Then the next thing you
know, he says something and it's like 'Wow,' everyone is listening.
He really knows how to use guys. He's found a way to make us all play
together."</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the first time Bowman has coached a team that has
dominated a regular season from start to finish. His 1976-77 Montreal
Canadiens lost only eight times and went on to win the Stanley Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Arguably the best coach in NHL history, Bowman is working toward
an unprecedented ninth Stanley Cup, which would move him ahead of
famed Montreal coach Toe Blake.</TE>
<TE>   Bowman's secret has been his ability to get his players to play in
his system. Working with associate coaches Dave Lewis and Barry
Smith, Bowman loves to switch things up. From game to game, period to
period and sometimes, shift to shift, Bowman isn't afraid to move his
players around.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter who scores, who gets points and who does what,"
Robitaille said. "It's all about who wins and that's why it's working
out this way. Having everyone switched around and playing with
different guys, is going to be a good thing once we get into the
playoffs. We're going to be a tough team to check.... We can score on
every line, and that makes us very dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit has been so dominant, the NHL has been forced to keep an
eye on Bowman's lineups just to make sure he's following the league
rule that requires coaches to put their best squad on the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "We're monitoring the Red Wings' lineup selection," Frank Brown,
the league's vice president of media relations, told the Chicago
Tribune. "Managing your lineup to maximize your competitiveness long
term is a long-standing practice.... If they pull their top
power-play unit five games in a row, that's something different."</TE>
<TE>   But when you're as deep as the Red Wings, how can you really tell
that they're not following league guidelines when they keep winning?</TE>
<TE>   In their game against the Mighty Ducks on Wednesday night at the
Arrowhead Pond, the Red Wings were without All-Stars Steve Yzerman,
Nicklas Lidstrom and Igor Larionov, but Detroit still has plenty in
reserve. In fact, Lidstrom, last season's Norris Trophy winner as the
league's top defenseman, is not even with the team for the current
three-game West Coast trip just so he can rest a nagging groin
injury.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not giving players a rest as much as we're trying to
monitor [nagging] injuries," said Bowman, who had six players
participate in the league's All-Star weekend and 12 compete in the
Olympics. It also doesn't help that Detroit is the only Eastern time
zone team playing in the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of the guys on our team have had to go right through without
any breaks. Just nonstop."</TE>
<TE>   After the Red Wings were upset by the Kings in the first round of
the playoffs last season, General Manager Ken Holland decided to do
some tinkering over the summer. To say his moves have worked out so
far would be a major understatement.</TE>
<TE>   By adding goal scorers Brett Hull and Robitaille to the mix along
with six-time Vezina Trophy winner Dominik Hasek in goal, the Red
Wings instantly became a favorite to win the Stanley Cup this season.
After all, Detroit already had likely hall of famers Chris Chelios,
Brendan Shanahan, Sergei Fedorov, Igor Larionov, Lidstrom and
Yzerman.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys are here for one reason, and that is to win the Cup," said
Chelios, who at 40 is having a Norris Trophy type of season. "There
is always pressure. Since I've been in Detroit I've felt the pressure
to win because of management's statement of signing good players. By
signing guys like Luc, Brett Hull and Dominik Hasek, we feel
obligated to win and our play during the regular season shows that."</TE>
<TE>   Based on Detroit's 51-14-9-3 record, it would be easy to assume
that opposing teams haven't been giving the Red Wings much of a
fight. It's been just the opposite.</TE>
<TE>   "When I look back, I can remember the Edmonton Oilers in their
heyday and everyone played them harder than any other team," Chelios
said. "Whether you were a fourth-place or sixth-place team, you
played them hard because you were scared of being embarrassed. I'm
sure it's the same with us now and we've just had to be ready for
it."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Red Wings are proud with how they've played during
the regular season, they understand that the playoffs are completely
different.</TE>
<TE>   "The only pressure that really matters is the pressure that we put
on ourselves to be accountable to each other and to be ready when the
playoffs start," said Hull, who joined the Red Wings as a free agent.
"It's too easy to get caught into thinking that we're the best team
in the league and that everyone will lay down for you. It's been good
because everyone has been gunning for us all year. That has kept us
sharp."</TE>
<TE>   With emerging young players such as forwards Pavel Datsyuk, Boyd
Devereaux and defenseman Jiri Fischer joining quality role players
like Kris Draper, Tomas Holmstrom, Steve Duchesne, Darren McCarty and
Kirk Maltby, Detroit is deep and primed for the postseason.</TE>
<TE>   "You look around the room and see that this is special," Hull
said. "With the guys we have, with all of the future hall of famers
and the tradition of the Red Wings, this season has been a wonderful
experience."</TE>

<HD>Romar Replaces Bender at Washington</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Lorenzo Romar will return to Washington as the school's basketball
coach, replacing Bob Bender, who was asked to resign last month.</LD>
<LD>   "If it were not for my alma mater calling, if it were not for
that, I would still be coaching at Saint Louis University," said
Romar, who coached the Billikens the last three seasons. "It just so
happens that the school where I played my collegiate basketball
needed a coach."</LD>
<LD>   Romar was a starting guard for Washington from 1978-80.</LD>
<TE>   Bender's teams had consecutive 20-loss seasons for the first time
in school history.</TE>
<TE>   Romar, 43, was an assistant at UCLA from 1992-96 and is known for
his strong recruiting on the West Coast.</TE>

<HD>Salaries Surpass $2 Billion</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Payroll of 849 players tops mark for first time,
with Alex Rodriguez of Texas No. 1 on the list.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Baseball salaries topped $2 billion for the first time this year,
with Texas Ranger shortstop Alex Rodriguez atop the list at $22
million.</LD>
<LD>   The New York Yankees led all clubs with a record payroll of nearly
$126 million--$92 million more than last-place Tampa Bay.</LD>
<LD>   The figures are the result of a study by the Associated Press of
contracts for 849 players on opening-day rosters and disabled lists.</LD>
<TE>   Players will earn $2.023 billion, up from $1.934 billion last
season. Owners, however, did slow the increase during a troubled
off-season in which baseball unsuccessfully tried to eliminate two
teams.</TE>
<TE>   The average salary of $2,383,235 was up 5.2 percent from last
year. That was less than half of the 13.9 percent increase of 2001
and the smallest percentage jump since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "It goes up every year," New York Met Manager Bobby Valentine
said. "The only time they didn't go up was in the collusion years."</TE>
<TE>   While the average salary has increased 126-fold from 1967, when it
was $19,000, the Consumer Price Index has gone up only five-fold
since then. And while baseball players average $13,000 a day during
the season, the average annual household income in the United States
is $57,045, according to latest figures from Census Bureau. That's
about four days' average pay for someone who wields a bat and wears a
glove.</TE>
<TE>   Still, baseball's average is almost half the $4.2 million in the
NBA last season, according to figures compiled by the league. The
NHL's average was $1.43 million last season and the NFL's average was
$1.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Just behind Rodriguez are Toronto first baseman Carlos Delgado
($19.4 million), Dodger pitcher Kevin Brown ($15.7 million) and
Boston outfielder Manny Ramirez ($15.4 million). Barry Bonds, who hit
a record 73 homers for San Francisco, is tied for fifth with the
Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa at $15 million.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Well on Their Way to a Perfect Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I want to be in Dodger Stadium, of course, in case the team wins a
game this season.</LD>
<LD>   So I was there Wednesday night as Barry Bonds brought back
childhood memories of "Home Run Derby," announcer Mark Scott, Wrigley
Field and fat pitches in a batter's wheelhouse so the ball leaves the
park with regularity.</LD>
<LD>   I would think Bonds has a problem now, however. Who does he select
as batting practice pitcher to serve up fat pitches for the All-Star
game home-run derby--Kevin Brown, Omar Daal, Hideo Nomo or Terry
Mulholland?</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I BELIEVE I waited all the way until Feb. 10 to eliminate the
Dodgers from contention this season. I apologize now for waiting so
long to write that column.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I SAW enough of the Dodgers on opening day to suggest the "Dodger
Mercy Rule," and call it a day after the other team has posted its
third run. That would have ended this debacle, of course, before the
Dodgers ever came to the plate, and in some respects a 3-0 defeat
would have been a moral victory when you consider the final score of
Wednesday night's embarrassment.</TE>
<TE>   As you might imagine, I'm concerned, because come late June when
I'm telling my wife I have to go to Dodger Stadium for the umpteenth
night in a row just in case this is the night the team wins its first
game, I'm not sure she's going to buy it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HOW BAD was it? The Giants were taking out their starters in the
fifth inning to give them a rest--in the second game of the season,
and you can imagine how upset those guys must have been to lose the
opportunity to bat against the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   How bad was it? Chad Kreuter got into the game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FOR THE first time in 35 years, Dodger games are not on the radio
in the Las Vegas area. Who thought Sin City would be the first to
clean up the airwaves?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT'S CUSTOMARY at Dodger Stadium after someone hits a home run for
the team to announce a few minutes later how far the ball traveled. I
had Bonds' homer off Nomo going 3.2 miles, but to my surprise the
Dodgers said it went 443 feet.</TE>
<TE>   I had his second one landing on the 110 Freeway, but the Dodgers
said it went 459 feet, and they do have a lot of experience measuring
Bonds' home runs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THIS FROM e-mailer Cathhoyt: "I just hope Bonds doesn't end up
with an asterisk by his name because he plays against the Dodgers."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT COULD be worse. You could have been sitting down the
right-field line on opening day when former Dodger pitcher Jim Gott
walked by. While making his way to the field to conduct the fourth
inning Coca Cola Trivia Quiz, Gott began passing out 2001 Dodger
magnet schedules and 2001 comic books to the fans.</TE>
<TE>   For the poor fan who went home, attached the magnet to the
refrigerator and took note the Dodgers will be playing the Giants
here April 8 with another chance to see Barry Bonds, the team would
like to apologize in advance when you arrive and find the place
empty.</TE>
<TE>   "We're slightly embarrassed," said a Dodger spokesman, and I can
only guess how big of a goof it will take for someone to say, "We're
greatly embarrassed."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ADRIAN BELTRE said he had been given the signal to steal second
base in the second inning of the Dodgers' opener with L.A. trailing
by four runs with Eric Karros at the plate and one out. Manager Jim
Tracy said Beltre has the OK to run whenever he wants unless stopped
by a sign from Tracy.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre seemed surprised anyone would ask him why he was running in
that situation. "How are we going to score runs?" he said. I guess
I'm not the only one who isn't waiting for Karros to hit the ball any
time soon.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I FIND the report in the Fresno Bee that USC basketball coach
Henry Bibby called the athletic director at Fresno State several
times, left messages and could not get a return phone call very
funny. I wonder if he's ever tried calling his own athletic director?
Or university president?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I GOT the call at Dodger Stadium telling me Cleveland pitcher
Chuck Finley had been roughed up. I thought there had to be some kind
of mistake because he was pitching against the Angels. Then I was
told what happened, and I knew it couldn't have been the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA DEFENSIVE end Asi Faoa begins a 180-day sentence for assault
in May, and he said he won't miss any of the team's games because
he's certain he can negotiate a deal to serve his time in two
parts--before and after the season. Crime might not pay, but being a
UCLA football player apparently helps.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA QUARTERBACK Cory Paus told reporters this week that he hasn't
had a drink in six weeks. I would have been more impressed had he
said the same thing 10 months ago after the police had caught him a
second time for driving drunk.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE NATIONAL Academy of Television Arts and Sciences came out
Wednesday with its nominations for this year's Sports Emmy Awards,
which is an obvious sham.</TE>
<TE>   "The Best Damn Sports Show Period," has been nominated for
outstanding daily studio show, which tells me no one watches these
things before announcing the selections for these awards.</TE>
<TE>   And if that's the case, I know for a fact no one was watching "The
SIMERS &amp; plaschke Show," so why weren't we nominated?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Tim Kettle:</TE>
<TE>   "I hate the Dodgers. I write for my high school newspaper and I
quoted you in my story, because what you said about the Dodgers is
exactly how I feel."</TE>
<TE>   Say hello to your principal for me today when he calls you to his
office.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Can't Catch a Break in 1-0 Loss to U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Javier Aguirre has had no delusions of grandeur regarding Mexico's
chances at winning the World Cup. The Mexico coach said that Los
Tricolores, which needed a mighty rally just to qualify for the
tournament, was not going to win the world title.</LD>
<LD>   A more realistic goal for his rebuilding program, he said, would
be to advance to the second round, no easy feat as Mexico is grouped
with Croatia, Ecuador and Italy.</LD>
<LD>   But Mexico's chances to reach the round of 16 may have taken a
blow one day before its 1-0 exhibition loss to the United States on
Wednesday night. On Tuesday, team captain Claudio Suarez broke his
right leg in practice.</LD>
<TE>   Suarez's injury cast a pall over the World Cup tuneup Wednesday in
front of a pro-Mexico crowd of 48,476 at Invesco Field.</TE>
<TE>   The defender's absence may have contributed to the final score as
a mix-up in Mexico's defense allowed the U.S. score in the 66th
minute.</TE>
<TE>   American forward Clint Mathis found the net when, after a long pass
from Carlos Llamosa, Mexican defender Manuel Vidrio collided with
goalkeeper Oscar Perez to the right of the keeper's box.</TE>
<TE>   Seemingly stunned at being alone in front of the net, Mathis' tired
shot hit the crossbar but had enough on it to dribble in and give the U.S.
the winning margin.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I'm starting to get there," said Mathis, who has five
goals in the last four games. "If I continue to score goals and help
the team win, I have a good chance."</TE>
<TE>   Tempers ran wild at the end, though, when Mexico reserve
midfielder Alberto Garcia Aspe and U.S. defender Frankie Hejduk were
issued red cards in the 90th minute after the two traded shoves.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a day when the soccer wasn't great," U.S. Coach Bruce
Arena said, "and you had to have a big heart to win."</TE>
<TE>   It was the United States' seventh straight shutout on American
soil this year and its overall shutout streak reached 712 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   In 19 matches between Mexico and the United States since 1990, the
U.S. holds a 7-6-6 advantage and has won four of the last five
meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico out-shot the United States, 6-0, in the first half, but
came away empty.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican forward Carlos Ochoa came closest to scoring as he trickled a
shot past goalkeeper Tony Meola and into the right corner of the net from
about five yards out in the seventh minute.</TE>
<TE>   But Ochoa was called for being offside by referee Clive Wright and
the goal was disallowed.</TE>
<TE>   With U.S. defender Greg Vanney sitting out the second half with a
strained back, Arena went from a 4-5-1 alignment to a 3-5-2 and was
able to set the tempo, outshooting Mexico, 6-3, in the second 45
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   In what was most likely a last chance for the U.S. fringe players
to make a statement, Arena played 15 of his 18 players in the
Americans' final home match before announcing their 23-man roster for
the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is grouped with Poland, Portugal and South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Only defender Carlos Bocanegra (injured toe), forward
Brian McBride (injured ankle) and goalkeeper Tim Howard did not play
for the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Arena had delved into Major League Soccer rosters for the
exhibition against Mexico as 16 of his 18 players Wednesday are
currently with MLS teams.</TE>
<TE>   "I liked what I saw but it's nothing I can state publicly [about
the roster]," Arena said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has tuneup matches remaining at Ireland on April 17,
after which the American team will be named, and at home against
Uruguay, Jamaica and Holland in mid-May.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the United States will face eight World Cup qualifiers
this year before heading to Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre, who took what was essentially a junior varsity squad to
the Gold Cup in January, also brought a young team to Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican forwards Cuauhtemoc Blanco and Juan Francisco Palencia and
midfielder Gerardo Torrado, who all play for clubs in Spain, and
defender Rafael Marquez, who plays in France, were not released by
their teams for the exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 17 Mexican players to make the trip, only goalkeeper Jorge
Campos failed to see action in Mexico's final match before Aguirre
announces his World Cup roster on April 15.</TE>
<TE>   He is holding a spot for Suarez.</TE>
<TE>   Suarez, a defender and the world's most capped international
player with 170 career appearances, fractured the fibula in his right
leg after slide-tackling a teammate on the frozen Invesco Field grass
on a night when the temperature had fallen to 27 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Mexican officials were holding out hope that Suarez, 34,
would recover in time to play in the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Because it was a clean break, Mexican officials are anticipating
that Suarez, who played every minute for Mexico in the 1994 and 1998
World Cups, could undergo an operation in which a plate would be
inserted to speed the healing process.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the captain of our team and we are worried," Aguirre said,
"but we have to carry on."</TE>

<HD>Controller to Review Plan for Cityhood</HD>
<DH>Government: Voters could get key information on Hollywood
secession, councilman says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council voted Wednesday to ask for a state
review of a study that found Hollywood would be financially viable if
it seceded.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Eric Garcetti, who represents much of Hollywood, said a
state controller's review will give voters more information to
consider if the secession proposal is placed on the November ballot.</LD>
<LD>   ''There is an intense desire within Hollywood to stay within Los
Angeles, but we have to make that case,'' Garcetti told his
colleagues. ''We have to have the clear information out there so
people know what $10 million in cuts each year for three years are
going to look like.''</LD>
<TE>   The Local Agency Formation Commission recently released its study
of Hollywood secession, concluding that a new city would be
financially healthy but might have to make some cuts to build a
reasonable reserve fund.</TE>
<TE>   State law allows anyone to request a controller's review of the
studies. The city recently paid for reviews of San Fernando Valley
and harbor-area cityhood proposals.</TE>
<TE>   State Controller Kathleen Connell found that a harbor-area city
would have financial viability problems but that a Valley city could
work if it increased its reserves.</TE>
<TE>   The latest council request for a state controller review was no
surprise to Hollywood VOTE board member Fares Wehbe, who said the
city is looking for any ammunition against secession.</TE>
<TE>   ''I'm concerned the city is trying to wiggle out of letting the
voters decide. It's a waste of taxpayers' money,'' Wehbe said of the
review. ''The finding is going to be the same, that we generate more
money than the cost of services, and we are financially viable.''</TE>
<TE>   The council agreed to pay $25,000 toward a Hollywood review, which
will take 45 days and is not expected to delay the commission's
decision in May on whether to put the cityhood measure on the ballot,
according to Larry Calemine, the commission's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   The council also voted Wednesday to send three other reports to
the commission that raise objections to terms and conditions for all
three cityhood proposals and assert that the Valley and harbor plans
would hurt Los Angeles financially. The council insists that a new
Valley city would owe Los Angeles $306 million in annual "alimony"
payments.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles asserts that the cityhood proposals fail the test of
''revenue neutrality'' required before they go on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton said the city has an
obligation to go on record with its concerns about the viability of
all three proposals.</TE>

<LD>The mother of a 28-year-old woman who died a year ago in a car
accident filed a wrongful death lawsuit against shock rocker Marilyn
Manson, alleging he provided the daughter with drugs that impaired
her driving.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit filed Tuesday by Maria St. John contends that on April
1, 2001, Jennifer Syme of Los Angeles was given cocaine at a party at
the home of Manson, whose real name is Bryan Warner.</LD>
<LD>   About 6 a.m., Syme's car crashed into three parked cars and rolled
on its side. She died at the scene.</LD>

<HD>Friend of Rap Exec Killed</HD>
<DH>Violence: Victim, who had ties to 'Suge' Knight, is gunned
down at Compton gas station.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former associate of rap music executive Marion "Suge" Knight was
gunned down Wednesday at a Compton service station.</LD>
<LD>   Alton McDonald, 37, was pumping gas at the Shell station at
Rosecrans and Atlantic avenues near his family's home when "a dark
pickup just drove up and started blasting," Sheriff's Lt. Don Bear
said.</LD>
<LD>   McDonald was hit several times in the upper body and died at St.
Francis Medical Center in Lynwood. A man who had been with him ran
from the scene after the 2 p.m. shooting, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   Deputies said they believe several people were in the pickup, and
that at least one got out and opened fire. The killers remain at
large. Police found numerous large-caliber handgun casings around the
gas pumps.</TE>
<TE>   Knight, head of Death Row Records, went to the hospital Wednesday
afternoon to visit McDonald and later paid his respects to McDonald's
family at their home in Compton.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Death Row Records declined to comment on the shooting
or say whether McDonald had been an employee. McDonald's family also
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   In the hours after the shooting, the Sheriff's Department sent a
gang-enforcement team to search for suspects and stem further
violence, said Sgt. Allen Harris.</TE>
<TE>   According to court records, McDonald was in Las Vegas with Knight
and rap star Tupac Shakur in 1996 when Shakur was killed in a
drive-by shooting near the Strip. Knight was wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Just hours before Shakur was killed, all three men had been
involved in a scuffle in a hotel lobby that was captured by hotel
surveillance cameras. Knight was jailed as a result of that incident
after a judge determined that he had violated his probation on a
previous assault conviction.</TE>

<LD>The Rev. Frederick Murph of Brookins Community AME Church on
Wednesday became the second African American leader in as many days
to say he will consider supporting secession by the San Fernando
Valley, harbor area and Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Murph, who has criticized Mayor James K. Hahn for his failure to
support Police Chief Bernard C. Parks for a second term, said he was
forming an exploratory committee to present information about the
secession movements to African Americans throughout the city.</LD>
<LD>   ''We will be calling community leaders and hearing the pros and
cons of secession,'' said Murph, who plans to announce his initiative
at a news conference today with secession leaders.</LD>
<TE>   Murph said his committee will hold community meetings and sponsor
focus groups.</TE>
<TE>   He said frustration with Hahn was a key reason for his interest in
secession.</TE>
<TE>   ''We have some things in common with those groups that are talking
about seceding,'' Murph said. ''There is a lack of leadership in the
city.... The thing with the police chief was mishandled.''</TE>
<TE>   Hahn could not be reached for comment late Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas told The Times that
if the Valley, harbor area and Hollywood left the city, African
Americans in Los Angeles would have more political clout.</TE>

<LD>The National Ballet of Spain canceled its opening performance in its
current three-city U.S. tour Wednesday, two hours before curtain time
at the Wilshire Theatre in Beverly Hills.</LD>
<LD>   According to Vanessa Kromer, of Nederlander Concerts, the
cancellation was caused by "unforeseen technical conditions"
regarding equipment. The rest of the engagement, with performances
today through Sunday, will go on as scheduled, with an added matinee
Saturday at 2 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Tickets for Wednesday night can be exchanged at point of purchase

<HD>Trying a New Tack to Recruit Teachers</HD>
<DH>L.A. Unified: Mid-career professionals from other fields
are sought for low-performing schools. Three-year internship, intense
training offered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles schools Supt. Roy Romer says accountants, bankers, sales
managers--heck, even journalists--can make good public school
teachers with the proper training.</LD>
<LD>   And so, to ease its teacher shortage, the Los Angeles Unified
School District is launching a campaign to attract professionals from
such various fields.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Teaching Fellows program, Romer announced
Wednesday, hopes to recruit 250 mid-career professionals to become
science, math, English and special education teachers in
low-performing schools especially in the downtown, Boyle Heights and
East Los Angeles areas.</LD>
<TE>   The program is part of a national organization called the New
Teacher Project, which has recruited teachers in New York City and
Washington, D.C. It will be advertised in Los Angeles-area newspapers
and on television and radio.</TE>
<TE>   "You've heard the statistics," says a monotone male voice in the
district's newly unveiled radio promotion for the program. "You know
many of L.A.'s children are still not getting the education they
deserve."</TE>
<TE>   Growing more urgent, the announcer says, "But you might not
realize that you have the power to change things."</TE>
<TE>   The program plans to give the teaching fellows six weeks of
intensive training this summer followed by a three-year internship,
during which they continue their training, take education courses and
lead classroom instruction one day a week.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen months into the internship, fellows will take an exam to
earn their preliminary teaching credentials, and at the end of the
internship they will earn their certification.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a program that will assist us to get talent into our
teaching core," Romer said. "Our main priority is to improve quality
instruction."</TE>
<TE>   Applicants need only have completed a bachelor's degree with a 2.7
grade point average. And fellows will earn the base salary of L.A.
Unified teachers, about $35,000.</TE>
<TE>   For professionals in the middle of their careers--like an
accountant who can start at $50,000--this may be a step down
monetarily. But Romer said he doesn't expect decreased pay to deter
the truly dedicated applicants.</TE>
<TE>   Said school board member Genethia Hayes: "We're not looking for
the young people who are trying to figure out who they are. We're
looking for people who know who they are.</TE>
<TE>   "The best teacher in hard-to-staff, low-performing schools is the
teacher who has the passion for teaching," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Juldene Sims had that passion and felt as though she were wasting
it working as a banker. So last year, she left and sought out an
earlier version of the internship program. Sims is now in her first
year of teaching math at South Gate High School.</TE>
<TE>   She advised other mid-career professionals to have realistic
expectations when they enter the classroom as teachers. "You're not
going to come in and solve the world's problems in education," Sims
said, "but you can make a difference with your group of students."</TE>

<HD>3 Gang Members Who Tried to Kill Officers Get Life in
Prison</HD>
<DH>Crime: The Atwater Village men led a patrol car into an
ambush.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three Atwater Village gang members recently convicted of leading two
Los Angeles police officers into an ambush and trying to kill them
were sentenced to life in prison Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler sentenced Mario "Little
Boy" Aleman, 25, Ramon "Chubbs" Maldonado, 22, and Joseph "Little
Respect" Aghazadeh, 20, to two consecutive life terms plus dozens of
additional years for related offenses such as using guns and robbing
a passerby of his wallet.</LD>
<LD>   They were convicted of trying to kill officers Tom Baker and
Carlos Langarica, who pursued them after an aborted attempt to kill a
rival gang member.</LD>
<TE>   Before pronouncing sentence, Fidler called the actions of the
three "senseless and outrageous violence" and said, "Whatever I can
do to stop it, I am going to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Fidler said gang killings have become so common in Los Angeles
that they seldom attract public attention. "In our community, it's
just another gang case, and that's sad."</TE>
<TE>   The judge said gang members often show no remorse. "They didn't
think about the police officers and their families," he said. "They
don't think. They just act."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven J. Ipsen said later that the three men
probably will remain in prison for the rest of their lives.</TE>
<TE>   He said each had been offered a plea bargain that would have
required his testimony and help in identifying other shooters in the
ambush. Out of loyalty to the gang, they opted to go to trial, he
added.</TE>
<TE>   The incident took place about 3:30 a.m. on July 4, 2000, when
Aleman, Maldonado and Aghazadeh--members of the Toonerville gang--set
out to retaliate against a member of the rival Rascals gang who they
believed was responsible for drive-by shootings in their
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   They aborted the plan when they learned that a passerby was
watching them, Ipsen said. After robbing the passerby, the three
cruised the neighborhood until they noticed Baker and Langarica in a
patrol car and fled.</TE>
<TE>   With Aghazadeh driving, the gang members, in a Honda, led the
patrol car to the corner of Bemis Street and Brunswick Avenue in
their own neighborhood, Langarica said.</TE>
<TE>   He said that someone--in an apparent effort to slow the officers
down--had pushed a washing machine or dryer into the street, and
another person had shoved a bicycle into their path.</TE>
<TE>   Someone then opened fire on the two officers from behind, while
one of the gang members in the Honda shot at them from the other
direction.</TE>
<TE>   Baker used his patrol car to ram the Honda out of their way. The
two officers returned fire, wounding Maldonado. Neither officer was
struck by the gunfire, and the three gang members were arrested at
the scene with the help of backup officers.</TE>

<HD>Sex Offender Suspected of Molesting Boys</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A registered sex offender accused of luring boys to motel rooms in El
Sereno, where he allegedly molested them and photographed them nude,
has been arrested, Los Angeles police said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Alexander Trestrail, 27, of El Sereno, was arrested March 23 after
the mother of a 14-year-old runaway he allegedly befriended tracked
him down at a Super 8 Motel and called police. The teenager did not
report any abuse by Trestrail, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   But while Trestrail was in police custody, authorities received a
complaint from a 12-year-old boy, who said Trestrail had engaged in
sexual acts with him in previous weeks, said Det. Ernest Munoz of the
Los Angeles Police Department's Hollenbeck Division.</LD>
<TE>   The 12-year-old and his father were unaware that Trestrail was in
custody. "It just happened that he told his dad" around the time of
the arrest, Munoz said.</TE>
<TE>   Based on those allegations, prosecutors last week filed charges
against Trestrail, including one count of committing a lewd act on a
child and two counts each of using a minor for a sex act and child
molesting with a prior offense.</TE>
<TE>   Munoz said two 11-year-olds also have accused Trestrail of
molesting them, but those allegations have not yet been presented to
the district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said Trestrail is believed to have given boys
marijuana and money in exchange for permission to photograph them.</TE>
<TE>   Trestrail, who is unemployed and lives with his grandparents, grew
up in El Sereno, police said. He was convicted in 1997 of a
misdemeanor charge of annoying or molesting children.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives said Trestrail frequented such areas as libraries,
swimming pools, parks and schools. They asked others who may have
encountered Trestrail to call police at (323) 526-3165.</TE>

<HD>Ahmanson Ranch Mired in Political Tug of War</HD>
<DH>Growth: Development was once hailed by environmentalists but now
struggles to overcome their scorn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In solemn presidential tones, actor Martin Sheen condemns a plan to
build a small city overlooking the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   "Are you stuck in traffic right now?" the chief executive of
television's "West Wing" declares in a stream of radio ads. "If not,
you'd better enjoy this rare moment. Because it's only going to get
worse, thanks to Washington Mutual Bank."</LD>
<LD>   The radio spots represent the latest broadside against a 3,050-home
golf course community planned for the rugged Simi Hills near Calabasas.</LD>
<TE>   Once the darling of urban planners and even some environmentalists,
Washington Mutual's Ahmanson Ranch project has been thrown on the
defensive by a potent new alliance of politicians, environmentalists and
Hollywood celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   The $2-billion development by the nation's largest savings and loan
places on a collision course two powerful imperatives of California
politics--the push for clustered "smart growth" that puts homes close to
jobs while easing a growing housing crisis, and the pull of a newly
emboldened grass-roots movement to preserve large tracts of dwindling
open space.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of large housing projects statewide--including the giant
Newhall Ranch and Playa Vista developments in Los Angeles County--are
caught between the same determined forces.</TE>
<TE>   The battle is crystallized on 2,800 acres of oak savanna and grassy
plains. Ahmanson Ranch is the largest remaining chunk of undeveloped
private land in the mountains ringing the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "Ahmanson Ranch stands at the intersection of 'smart growth' and
environmental activism in California," said planning expert William
Fulton.</TE>
<TE>   "A generation ago this project would have been accepted as a good
master-planned community," said Fulton, who describes the project's
initial 1992 approval in his book, the "Reluctant Metropolis." "But today
it's seen as a symbol of environmental destruction."</TE>
<TE>   Ahmanson Ranch remains in limbo as Ventura County officials consider a
new environmental study. This one focuses on a prickly, dime-sized white
flower and a springy, red-legged frog, discovered on the ranch in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   A consultant's analysis says both the plant and the amphibian can
survive urbanization in preserves planned by developers. Whatever the
Ventura County Board of Supervisors decides later this year, a new round
of lawsuits is likely.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of closure underscores a question that increasingly confounds
California decision-makers: How do they accommodate the state's constant
growth and save the environment at the same time?</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena architect Donald Brackenbush thought he had the answer when
he designed the Ahmanson project in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   The ranch plan would be a throwback to the balanced communities that
were America's small towns. Brackenbush argued that the community would
be a logical extension of suburban Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Even in Ventura County, a national leader in open space preservation,
the plan had support from some leading environmentalists. It was finally
approved in 1992, primarily because the deal helped save 10,000 acres of
nearby mountain land.</TE>
<TE>   The Ahmanson Ranch "new town" won national awards for a design that
stressed environmental sensitivity. It set aside 22% of homes for those
with low or moderate incomes. And every resident would live within a
10-minute walk or bike ride of the village green and town center.</TE>
<TE>   Developers faced multiple challenges, but they prevailed in a series
of lawsuits that claimed the project skirted state planning and
environmental laws.</TE>
<TE>   By late 1998, after turning over the last of the promised parkland,
project backers were ready to set a date for ground-breaking. But the
golden shovels were stowed away after the discovery of a fragile flower,
not seen since 1929, and a frog that has frequently fallen victim to
human encroachment.</TE>
<TE>   Critics seized the momentum.</TE>
<TE>   What began as a guerrilla movement headed by homeowners in the upscale
neighborhoods around Ahmanson Ranch, has now grown to include a legion of
hostile politicians and Hollywood celebrities, led by actor-director Rob
Reiner and aided by Sheen.</TE>
<TE>   They contend the project is an environmental disaster that would dump
45,000 cars a day onto local streets and the Ventura Freeway, pollute
mountain creeks and distant Malibu beaches, uproot nearly 1,200 oak trees
and kill the rare San Fernando Valley spineflower and California
red-legged frog.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery of 1.6 million of the tiny flowers on a grassy hillside
and 25 of the rare frogs, in deep pools near a planned golf course,
particularly reinvigorated the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Developers pledged to preserve, and expand, the frog and spineflower
populations. But critics used the new ecological issues to rally even
more supporters for open space.</TE>
<TE>   The recent passage of two state bond measures to enhance parks and
open space only increased Ahmanson opponents' sense that they are seizing
the advantage. Some of the $4.7 million in bonds approved by voters in
2000 and last month could help buy and preserve the property.</TE>
<TE>   The project's political footing in Ventura County became more
uncertain in the March election, when a second Ahmanson Ranch critic won
a seat on the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   The seemingly inevitable "park deal of the century," as a top aide to
Gov. Pete Wilson called it in 1991, now finds itself mired in a battle of
attrition.</TE>
<TE>   On one side is Washington Mutual, a financial giant with $243 billion
in assets. On the other is a coalition that vows to throw up roadblocks
and tar the bank's reputation until it agrees to sell.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, if Washington Mutual were a willing seller, state parks
officials say opponents could find the money to buy the onetime sheep and
cattle ranch. Analysts speculate the price could range from $100 million
to $500 million.</TE>
<TE>   A second alternative would be for the bank to polish its image by
giving Ahmanson Ranch to a nonprofit agency in a "conservation easement"
that could also create a huge tax write-off.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual insists, however, that the ranch is not for sale.</TE>
<TE>   "The opposition's best hope is to scare us off the project," said Tim
McGarry, spokesman for Washington Mutual. "But we're not so brittle. We
have the fortitude to see this through."</TE>
<TE>   Ground-breaking is expected by late 2003, McGarry said, including time
to deal with the next round of lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The Ahmanson Ranch stalemate reflects the intense scrutiny faced by
large new developments in California, especially in rare natural
environments or growth-sensitive areas, such as the coast.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, for example, the bulk of the planned
13,000-home Playa Vista project near Marina Del Rey has been halted for
two decades, as various opponents have tried to expand the adjacent
wetlands preserve.</TE>
<TE>   The largest housing project in L.A. County history, 22,000-home
Newhall Ranch near Santa Clarita, is also working its way through the
county bureaucracy again after a judge found two years ago that it had
not identified a reliable water supply.</TE>
<TE>   Builders believe that the dire need for new housing is the strongest
argument for Newhall, Playa Vista and Ahmanson Ranch: California's
population growth outstrips the supply of new housing by 50,000 to 70,000
dwellings a year.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a disastrous housing situation in the state," said Dowell
Myers, a USC urban planning professor who specializes in housing issues.
"And Ahmanson Ranch is a poster child for delay and nonproduction. This
is the Nancy Reagan style of providing housing: 'Just say no.' "</TE>
<TE>   But opponents say that the housing shortage must not trump other,
equally important, concerns. And they have learned that delay can often
function as a veto.</TE>
<TE>   It can also give time for politicians to find an issue. Today, few
elected officials have anything good to say about Ahmanson Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe it should be built at all," said state Sen. Sheila
Kuehl (D-Santa Monica), who represents neighborhoods near the ranch. "New
housing doesn't have to come thousands of houses at a time . . . all of
which dump their cars at the same place onto the same freeway each
morning."</TE>
<TE>   Two area congressmen, Democratic Reps. Brad Sherman and Henry Waxman,
criticize the project. Opposition is also uniform among officials in
neighboring cities and Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Politically potent environmental groups, such as Santa Monica-based
Heal the Bay, have joined the fray, too, pressuring Ventura County to
further study pollution it says the project will dump into Malibu Creek,
which flows into the ocean at landmark Surfrider Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Gold, executive director of Heal the Bay, ridiculed a recent
developer's study that the project's runoff would be cleaner than that
already flowing from the ranch.</TE>
<TE>   "That makes me sick to my stomach," Gold said. "That doesn't meet
anybody's laugh test."</TE>
<TE>   Sheen and a cadre of activist celebrities have thrust Ahmanson Ranch
into the spotlight as never before.</TE>
<TE>   "The politics lined up against this thing has become very impressive,"
author Fulton said. "When the Wednesday-night president [Sheen] is
against it, that's a tough one to fight."</TE>
<TE>   Reiner first heard of the issue last summer from the environmentalist
wife of "Seinfeld" creator Larry David. Reiner says a group he helped
found last fall is determined to kill the project. It raised more than
$100,000 in January at a single dinner at the Pacific Palisades home of
Laurie and Larry David.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought initially it would take between half a million and a
million dollars," Reiner said in an interview. "But this fight might drag
on awhile."</TE>
<TE>   "This is supposedly about affordable housing," he said. "But this is a
luxury-home project. It's dumb growth."</TE>
<TE>   It was Reiner who called his friend Sheen to ask him to do the
voice-overs for radio ads on stations in Los Angeles and Ventura
counties.</TE>
<TE>   "Rob swings a heavy hammer," said state Sen. Kuehl. "That levels the
playing field, and surprises them."</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual has responded with an expensive lobbying campaign,
hiring a firm friendly to Gov. Gray Davis to smooth Ahmanson's way with
transportation and wildlife officials.</TE>
<TE>   In an unusual tactic for a developer, Washington Mutual is also
underwriting a costly campaign with full-page newspaper ads. They declare
that the red-legged frog is "The Boss."</TE>
<TE>   From the start, developers have tried to sell Ahmanson Ranch as an
old-fashioned village. Brackenbush says his original plan invented "smart
growth" in Southern California by making Ahmanson a self-supporting town,
one that mixes million-dollar country club estates with 774 affordable
apartments, condos and "granny flats."</TE>
<TE>   But the project was always a lightning rod, because of its location.</TE>
<TE>   Critics talk about the 37,500 cars a day Ahmanson Ranch would bring to
Los Angeles County roadways, including 10,000 on the jammed Ventura
Freeway. But developers maintain that is only about half of the 72,000
daily trips created by 84 new projects built along a nearby stretch of
the Ventura Freeway during the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Critics talk about the 1,152 oak trees, many of them mature, that
would be destroyed. But developers say they would plant 5,672 new oaks
and 2,000 are already in the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Critics talk about the leveling of hillsides and 45 million cubic
yards of grading. But developers say that is less than grading done,
cumulatively, by three new hilltop subdivisions nearby that provide far
fewer homes.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition to Ahmanson acknowledges that California needs to solve
its housing problems, but favors replacing blighted urban neighborhoods
with new high-density housing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just urban sprawl," said Mary Wiesbrock of Agoura Hills, a
longtime critic. "This land was zoned open space so the area could stay
livable and so we could preserve the Santa Monica Mountains as a national
recreation area. They get away with murder."</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains
Conservancy, endorsed the Ahmanson compromise a decade ago. But he
wonders if the recent frog and spineflower discoveries aren't the final
confirmation that Washington Mutual would be better off selling the land
for a park.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no doubt that if there was truly a willing seller, the funding
would be there at a fair price," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Guy Gniadek, president of Ahmanson Land Co., said he has spent 16
years planning and pushing the Ahmanson project, and he is convinced
Washington Mutual will finally build it.</TE>
<TE>   The 45-year-old Woodland Hills resident said he will move his family
there as soon as he can.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up in Indiana, and I can tell you the difference between being
able to walk to the market, to school or to the park instead of taking a
big car and driving to pick up a loaf of bread," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gniadek likes to take visitors to a ridge at the edge of Ahmanson
Ranch. At his back, the vast tracts of the San Fernando Valley begin.
Before him, in an oak-studded valley, is a vision of his small town.</TE>
<TE>   The two dozen shops and government buildings of the town center would
be here, overlooking a golf course and 300-room resort hotel, he says
with a sweep of his hand. The schools would be there. The equestrian
trails over there, the parks there.</TE>
<TE>   But what if another year passes, the Reiner campaign accelerates and
the reconstituted Ventura County Board of Supervisors decides it should
order another study? What would Washington Mutual do then?</TE>
<TE>   Gniadek pauses, his buoyant presentation deflated.</TE>
<TE>   "It is disappointing," he said, "for it to be such a good project, and
to have this type of opposition."</TE>

<HD>Palestinians Stand Defiant in Bethlehem</HD>
<DH>Mideast: About 100 fighters remain at Nativity church, and 80 flee
another sanctuary. Israel seizes Nablus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>The siege of the shrines of Bethlehem entered its second day
Wednesday with about 100 Palestinian fighters holed up in the Church of
the Nativity, defying Israeli soldiers positioned outside the 4th century
church built on the site revered as Jesus' birthplace.</LD>
<LD>   Intermittent gunfights continued in this shattered holy city.
Palestinian and Israeli officials said that five more Palestinians were
killed but that the death toll was preliminary because some bodies hadn't
been recovered. That would bring the total to an estimated 14 killed here
since the Israeli military swept into town early Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   There was no shooting at the Church of the Nativity, however. Late
Wednesday, an Israeli military commander approached the front doors of
the church and began telephone negotiations with a priest inside acting
as a mediator, according to a spokeswoman for the Israel Defense Forces.
Negotiations were continuing this morning without a resolution.</LD>
<TE>   As the Bethlehem standoff continued Wednesday, Israel widened its
reoccupation of the West Bank, taking control of Nablus, the sixth major
Palestinian population center seized and the largest city in the West
Bank. Alarmed by the escalating violence, Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell said in Washington that he is considering holding talks with
Israeli and Arab leaders during a trip to Europe next week.</TE>
<TE>   In Bethlehem, seven Greek Orthodox clergymen have remained voluntarily
in the besieged church on Manger Square, until recently a thriving
tourist attraction. The clerics were providing medical care to nine
wounded Palestinians, one of them severely injured, and sharing meager
supplies of coffee, tea and biscuits with the fighters, a priest said in
a telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   To the extent that anyone sleeps, the fighters, mostly members of the
Palestinian Authority security forces, bunk in the basilica and the
priests in their adjoining living quarters, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are agitated and nervous, but they respect us very much," said
the 33-year-old Canadian priest, who identified himself as Father
Parthenius, the chant of prayers resounding in the background. "The
Christians among them are joining us in prayer. There is a lot of
shooting outside. We heard two tank shells fired today."</TE>
<TE>   But the priest said that Israeli soldiers refrained from firing at the
church and that the Palestinians inside weren't shooting either. Another
standoff at a house of worship ended earlier Wednesday when about 80
Palestinian fighters fled out the back door of the Santa Maria church,
leaving behind the corpse of a uniformed Palestinian policeman with a
bullet wound to the head, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian governor of Bethlehem said the gunmen managed to sneak
out and escape into the historic city center, a labyrinth of winding
streets and narrow alleys. An Israeli military spokeswoman said troops
didn't engage the fleeing Palestinians in a firefight to ensure the
safety of a priest and nuns who had been inside with them since Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want any trouble around a church," the spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Information was imprecise, but Palestinians were reported to have been
holed up in two other churches. They abandoned one, the Lutheran church,
sometime Wednesday afternoon, according to Bethlehem Gov. Mohammed
Madani.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis say the Palestinians are exploiting the churches by
taking refuge in them.</TE>
<TE>   Father Parthenius said the priests in the Church of the Nativity don't
regard themselves as hostages. Rather, they fulfilled a sacred tradition
of providing sanctuary, he explained.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll never ask them to leave," the cleric said of the fighters. "To
make war is easy. In order to make peace, we must all pray together."</TE>
<TE>   The standoff at one of Christianity's most hallowed sites dominated
world attention, spurring public comments and diplomatic contacts
involving the Vatican, Israel and other governments.</TE>
<TE>   Clerics here were still coming to grips with the unthinkable: Men of
war have taken over places of peace. Nonetheless, several priests said
they were less concerned about the fate of the church buildings than
about the long-suffering people of Bethlehem.</TE>
<TE>   "The dignity of human beings is more important than the historical
center," said the Rev. Maroun Lahham, director of a Catholic seminary
here. "These are men we are dealing with, not stones."</TE>
<TE>   And the harsh human costs of the battle in Bethlehem were on display
just a few blocks from Manger Square.</TE>
<TE>   Two men bled to death Wednesday in the Fawagrah neighborhood,
residents said, because ambulances couldn't reach them through streets
filled with sniper fire, destroyed cars and water gushing from broken
pipes. As a wide-eyed little girl watched, Abdel Kader's agony ended
Wednesday afternoon on the kitchen floor of a family whose members were
strangers to him.</TE>
<TE>   Kader was wounded by shrapnel in the street during the Israeli
military offensive Tuesday morning, witnesses said. The family of
Fatheyeh Mousa, a stout woman wearing an Islamic head scarf, carried
Kader into its ground-floor apartment, a humble place with peeling walls
facing a small courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   "He was from a refugee camp in Jordan," said Issam Isis, crouched in a
daze next to the dead man on the kitchen floor. "He was just here
visiting relatives. Nobody from the hospital was able to pick him up
because of the fighting."</TE>
<TE>   Mousa's family tried to tend to Kader with the help of phone
instructions from doctors at the hospital, which is only a few minutes
away.</TE>
<TE>   "He has been bleeding there since 7 in the morning yesterday," Mousa
exclaimed. "Today he said, 'I'm dying, my blood, I'm going to die soon.'
He kept bleeding from a big hole in his waist. We tried to find any kind
of medicine to help him. We don't know who he is, but we feel as if he
was family. We feel as if we have lost a loved one."</TE>
<TE>   Mousa let loose a tirade of curses against Israelis. Her home and the
adjoining courtyard reverberated with the wails of enraged women, some of
whom also shouted anti-American sentiments, and the agitated chatter of
hard-eyed men smoking cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   The anguish and tension increased when a siren wailed outside. People
appeared on balconies; people spilled out into the street. They were
jumpy after two days hunkered down in a combat zone, and a false report
that a tank was rounding the corner caused a brief stampede for cover.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, an ambulance operated by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society
arrived, men frantically clearing debris out of its path. It was the
first ambulance allowed into the area since Tuesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by people appealing for help, a bearded paramedic named
Jamal Balboul forced his way into Mousa's apartment, took a quick look at
Kader's corpse and declared that there was nothing to be done.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Mousa's pleas to remove the body, Balboul said he had no time
and no room. The International Committee of the Red Cross had negotiated
on behalf of the Palestinians with the Israelis, who granted the
ambulance 30 minutes for its mission, the driver said.</TE>
<TE>   Balboul drove back to the hospital through an eerily deserted Pope
Paul VI Street, the siren mixing with the occasional gunfire in the
distance and the persistent drone of a store burglar alarm. He drove past
walls plastered with the posters of local men slain in the intifada,
tires crunching over a carpet of rubble, broken glass and spent
cartridges.</TE>
<TE>   The ambulance carried a grim cargo: two wounded men riding on top of
three cadavers. The dead included a slain woman and her adult son, whose
bodies had lain in a home for 27 hours with five frightened children.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the restrictions on ambulances, the Israeli military
spokeswoman said that ambulances pose special problems in the slow-motion
war here.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops once discovered an explosives belt of the kind used by
suicide bombers in an ambulance carrying a sick child, she said. Red
Crescent ambulances have been used to transport Palestinian fighters, and
one suicide bomber was a medic, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, not all the casualties in the Fawagrah neighborhood were
innocent bystanders. Residents said a dead man wrapped in a blanket on
the second floor of a street-front mosque was a fighter who had died a
few hours earlier; the white medical gauze wrapped around his wrist
suggested that someone had administered first aid.</TE>
<TE>   And several wounded combatants were on hand as well. A lean fighter
slumped in a chair in Mousa's apartment with a blanket wrapped around his
shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   On a hillside overlooking the city, another fighter, who identified
himself only as Khaled, sported a bandage on an eyebrow. His forehead was
spattered with dried blood. He wore an oversized leather jacket and
carried a cell phone in one hand and red worry beads in the other.</TE>
<TE>   "I was injured in an exchange of fire with the Israelis," Khaled said,
green eyes sweeping warily across faces and rooftops. From the urban
hillside where he stood, he could see Israeli soldiers taking prisoners
on a street below.</TE>
<TE>   Asked which Palestinian armed faction he belonged to, Khaled flashed a
half-smile that exposed prominent front teeth.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just a Palestinian defending my land," Khaled said. "I have
hidden my gun. I am confident the Israelis will not be able to find it. I
will be able to use it again."</TE>

<HD>Judge Rejects Closure of Terrorism Hearings</HD>
<DH>Courts: The challenge on deportation proceedings could have a broad
influence, an expert says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in Detroit ruled Wednesday that a government policy
to close deportation hearings of individuals targeted in the sweeping
terrorism investigation launched after the Sept. 11 attacks is
unconstitutional.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by U.S. District Judge Nancy G. Edmunds is the first by a
federal judge on the controversial issue of closed hearings and could
have a broad influence.</LD>
<LD>   "This has national ramifications," said Lee Gelernt, a senior staff
attorney at the Immigrants' Rights Project of the American Civil
Liberties Union. The ACLU has a similar case pending in Newark, N.J.,
that is scheduled to be heard April 22.</LD>
<TE>   "The judge made it clear that the judiciary cannot look away just
because the government says [a case] has to do with 9/11," Gelernt said.
"We suspect that the government has conducted hundreds of closed
hearings, but it is impossible to know because there has been so much
secrecy."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department spokesman Dan Nelson said department attorneys were
reviewing the decision and would have no other immediate comment.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's ruling arose in the case of Rabbih Haddad, a Lebanese
native who is a longtime resident of Ann Arbor, Mich., and the founder of
an Islamic charity that the government has been investigating since the
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Haddad was taken into custody Dec. 14; the INS has held three closed
hearings in his case, with another scheduled for Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Hackett, an immigration judge in Detroit, has excluded the
news media and the public from all of the hearings, saying she was
following a Sept. 21 directive by Michael Creppy, the chief U.S.
immigration judge.</TE>
<TE>   The government is seeking to deport Haddad, the co-founder of Global
Relief Foundation, as well as his wife and three of their four children.
The government has said Haddad and his wife have overstayed their visas.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the government has frozen Global Relief's assets. The group's
office in Bridgeview, Ill., a Chicago suburb, was raided the same day
Haddad was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   The government contends that Global Relief glorifies "martyrdom
through jihad," but the group denies that it has terrorist ties. A judge
is supposed to rule Friday on Global Relief's motion that its assets be
unfrozen.</TE>
<TE>   In Wednesday's deportation case, Hackett, Creppy and U.S. Atty. Gen.
John Ashcroft were named as defendants in lawsuits filed by the ACLU and
attorneys representing four Michigan newspapers and Haddad.</TE>
<TE>   Edmunds said the government policy is a clear violation of the 1st
Amendment, noting a long U.S. tradition of open court proceedings and
administrative hearings, including deportation hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department lawyers contended that the closed proceedings did
not violate due process and that any infringement on the 1st Amendment
was minimal.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Edmunds sharply disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Haddad's right to remain in the United States will be decided at
these proceedings," Edmunds wrote. "It is important for the public,
particularly individuals who feel that they are being targeted by the
government as a result of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, to know that
even during these sensitive times the Government is adhering to
immigration procedures and respecting individuals' rights."</TE>
<TE>   The judge emphasized that "secrecy only breeds suspicion as to why the
Government is proceeding against Haddad and aliens like him."</TE>
<TE>   Edmunds acknowledged that the public's right of access to deportation
hearings, as with other types of hearings, is not absolute. But she said
that when the government tries to close such a hearing, that action
should be subject to "strict scrutiny" to ensure that the government has
not violated the Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   She noted that closing the hearings was a "direct infringement" on the
1st Amendment rights of the media plaintiffs, including the Detroit Free
Press, the Detroit News, the Ann Arbor News and the Metro Times of
Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the newspapers, the ACLU represented U.S. Rep. John
Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), who also sought to have the hearings opened.</TE>
<TE>   In an affidavit filed with the court, James S. Reynolds, chief of the
terrorism and violent crimes section of the Justice Department's Criminal
Division, said the hearings needed to be closed because "special-interest
detainees could lead to public identification of individuals associated
with them," as well as other investigative sources and potential
witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds also contended that divulging the identity of detainees could
impair the government's ability to infiltrate terrorist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Reynolds contended that the closure "is justified by the need
to avoid stigmatizing 'special interest' detainees, who may ultimately be
found to have no connection to terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Edmunds, who was appointed to the federal bench by the first President
Bush in 1992, noted that the government had provided no reason why
Haddad's hearing in particular needed to be closed.</TE>
<TE>   Edmunds noted that in Haddad's case his identity and the date of his
arrest already had been made public and had been the subject of
considerable news coverage in Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   And she emphasized that "neither in the Creppy directive nor elsewhere
does the Government prohibit detainees in special interest cases (or
their counsel or families) from revealing that information to the press
and public. Thus, the interests the Government offers cannot support its
closure of Haddad's case even under the most deferential standard of
review."</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper plaintiffs had requested the right to attend any future
hearings and to obtain transcripts of the prior closed hearings. Edmunds
issued a preliminary injunction granting those requests.</TE>
<TE>   Edmunds also rejected the government's contention that she did not
have jurisdiction to hear the case.</TE>

<HD>Felled by 'Herbal' Diet Drug</HD>
<DH>AMP II drops, a potent mix of stimulants including ephedrine,
caused a woman's stroke, she alleges. Her case shines a light on a
largely unregulated industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RAY F. HERNDON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ANCHORAGE
</DL>
<LD>Rosie Talbert, a working mother of four, relied on energy and
enthusiasm to hold her own on the volleyball court. "Spiking was way out
of my league since I'm short," she said, "but I could really get under
the ball."</LD>
<LD>   During one game at a state park campground in the summer of 1995, she
felt sick, staggered to the sidelines and collapsed. Talbert was
diagnosed as suffering from heat exhaustion. As they sent her home,
emergency room doctors gave her husband, Dan, this advice: "Get her some
Gatorade."</LD>
<LD>   Three days later, Talbert's condition had not improved. A brain scan
showed that she had suffered a massive stroke. A weeklong battery of
tests failed to determine why.</LD>
<TE>   "They said they couldn't guarantee I wouldn't have another," she
recalled recently. "I was terrified."</TE>
<TE>   For nearly two years, Talbert had been putting diet drops in her
coffee three times a day. The drops were made by a Utah company called
E'Ola International, and they contained ephedrine, a popular but
controversial herbal stimulant.</TE>
<TE>   Ephedrine is the key ingredient in dozens of dietary supplements sold
at supermarkets, drugstores, even health clubs. It gives athletes an
energy surge and helps dieters control their appetites. But a growing
body of evidence has linked ephedrine to heart attacks, strokes and other
side effects.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, awareness of these risks was not widespread, even in the
medical community. Talbert's doctors were at a loss to explain why this
physically active, 34-year-old woman had been stricken.</TE>
<TE>   In time, they and she came to believe that the diet drops were to
blame. The more Talbert thought about it, the angrier she got. She hired
a lawyer and set out to hold E'Ola International accountable. She wanted
money, but not only that. She wanted publicity too. The more the better.</TE>
<TE>   She knew it would not happen quickly. Finally, in an Anchorage
courtroom last year, Talbert's lawyer subjected E'Ola to the kind of
public scrutiny the supplement industry had long sought to avoid.</TE>
<TE>   What the testimony revealed about E'Ola was described by the judge and
jury as "outrageous."</TE>
<TE>   The dietary supplement industry has grown rapidly in recent years and
offers hundreds of herbal products touted as promoting everything from
muscle mass to sexual potency.</TE>
<TE>   Sales have nearly doubled, to $16 billion a year, since 1994. In that
year, Congress exempted supplements from nearly all federal regulation.
Supplement makers are major donors to congressional and presidential
campaigns, and they lobbied hard for the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Its effects were sweeping. Unlike pharmaceuticals or food additives,
herbal supplements do not have to be screened by the Food and Drug
Administration before going on the market, or proved safe through
research.</TE>
<TE>   And unlike drug companies, supplement makers are not required to
notify the FDA of adverse reactions to their products. The agency has
relied on voluntary reporting by physicians and consumers in piecing
together a picture of ephedrine's dangers.</TE>
<TE>   The industry's most important Washington ally is Sen. Orrin G. Hatch
(R-Utah). A supplement user himself, Hatch says he is acting to preserve
freedom of choice for consumers and to protect companies that are major
employers and taxpayers in his state. He says herbal products such as
ephedrine are not foods or drugs and should not be subject to "arbitrary"
actions by federal bureaucrats.</TE>
<TE>Herb Used in China</TE>
<TE>   Ephedrine is derived from a plant called ephedra, or ma huang, a
medicinal herb used in teas in China. It is a chemical cousin of
amphetamine and a stimulant to the heart and nervous system.</TE>
<TE>   Ephedrine energy supplements with names such as Ripped Fuel and Andro
Heat are popular with athletes and bodybuilders. Such products are
suspected of contributing to the deaths of several college and
professional football players over the last year.</TE>
<TE>   But FDA data show that most of those who suffer serious side effects
from ephedrine are women--typically, women in their 30s and 40s who were
taking supplements to lose weight.</TE>
<TE>   Especially risky, according to the FDA, are products containing both
caffeine and ephedrine.</TE>
<TE>   E'Ola's AMP II Pro drops were such a product. Rosie Talbert began
taking them in 1993. She often struggled to control her weight,
especially during the long Alaskan winters. She learned about the diet
drops from her mother, who had learned about them from a deli manager,
who said they had helped her shed 80 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   The drops cost $15 to $20 for a 1-ounce squeeze bottle. Talbert's
mother became an E'Ola distributor so she could get a nearly 30%
discount. Talbert helped out, delivering the drops to her co-workers at
Chugach Electric, a southern Alaska utility.</TE>
<TE>   E'Ola literature touted the drops as "all herbal" and safe. Talbert
took them without incident for nearly two years, losing 20 to 30 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on June 3, 1995, she suffered her stroke. It left two lumps of
dead tissue in her cerebellum, each the size of a golf ball.</TE>
<TE>   The next several months, she said, were filled with fear and
uncertainty.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't walk straight. My left hand would shake uncontrollably.
And I couldn't control my right hand," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Although her condition improved slightly, Talbert continued to be
plagued by nausea, a loss of muscle control, vision problems and
short-term memory lapses. Once, after a trip to a supermarket, she
circled the parking lot, unable to remember what her car looked like.</TE>
<TE>   She tried to return to her job in the utility's credit department but
lasted only a day: She couldn't focus on her computer screen.</TE>
<TE>   The Talberts had to sell their home and move into a trailer with their
four children, whose ages ranged from 8 to 16. Talbert fearedthat her
marriage was failing. She lost all interest in sex and offered to release
Dan from their wedding vows. He refused and instead arranged a ceremony
to renew them.</TE>
<TE>   Her doctors, meanwhile, were still trying to figure out what caused
her collapse. Talbert had told them about the diet drops, but the
information did not raise a flag. In 1994, the FDA had issued a medical
bulletin warning that supplements combining caffeine and ephedrine could
cause heart attacks, strokes and other side effects. But the bulletin got
little attention. There had been no published medical studies linking
ephedrine to strokes.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Talbert read a newspaper article about ephedrine. "It urged you
to contact the FDA if you had any questions," she said. Talbert did just
that and within days had an FDA computer disk describing ephedrine's
danger signs. Many of them matched her symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just shocked," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She brought the information to her neurologist, who concluded that
ephedrine had probably caused her stroke. In mid-1996, Talbert hired
Anchorage attorney Richard E. Vollertsen to sue E'Ola.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Vollertsen was wary. Supplement companies were regarded as
particularly tough courtroom adversaries.</TE>
<TE>   "The food supplement industry is well-heeled and throws lots at you,"
said Mark I. Hefter, a Texas lawyer who has won out-of-court settlements
in three ephedrine cases.</TE>
<TE>   In one of them, Next Nutrition of Carlsbad, maker of an ephedrine
energy drink called Ultimate Orange, paid $4 million to Todd Weger, a
Gulf War veteran who suffered a stroke after drinking Ultimate Orange and
jogging on a treadmill. He was 31 at the time.</TE>
<TE>   After doing some research on Talbert's case, Vollertsen came to
believe she had a decent chance of winning. Texas, he learned, had banned
a product almost identical to the AMP II drops, and the FDA had begun
disclosing reports of heart attacks, strokes and other "adverse events"
associated with ephedrine supplements.</TE>
<TE>   As Talbert's trial date approached, the two sides held settlement
discussions. Talbert rejected E'Ola's offer. Vollertsen said it barely
would have covered the $500,000 in medical and legal expenses she was
facing.</TE>
<TE>   That was not all. The company wanted any settlement to be
confidential. Talbert wouldn't hear of it. She says she wanted other
women to know about the dangers of ephedrine. She wanted to make some
noise.</TE>
<TE>First Case to Trial</TE>
<TE>   The trial began Nov. 12, 1998, in the Anchorage courthouse, a modern,
pink-granite building whose entryway is adorned with totem poles carved
with eagles and ravens. A light snow was falling. Talbert's four children
wanted to attend, but she insisted they go to school.</TE>
<TE>   The case marked a first: There had been previous lawsuits over
ephedrine, but none had gone to trial. Over the next three weeks,
Vollertsen exposed E'Ola's inner workings to public view. A sobering
picture emerged.</TE>
<TE>   E'Ola was founded in 1991 by a former Honolulu car salesman, Don
Rivers. Rivers had retired to Utah, the heartland of the supplement
industry, and was looking for a way to increase his retirement income.</TE>
<TE>   He went into business with Barry Naef, an entrepreneur from Fullerton
who had been drawn to Utah by his dream of making a liquid diet potion. A
mutual acquaintance introduced them to Blaine Rudd, a Salt Lake City
hairdresser who was looking to get into the supplement business. Wayne
Reis, one of Rivers' colleagues from the Honolulu car lot, became
president of E'Ola.</TE>
<TE>   Rudd developed the formula for the AMP II diet drops. His only
previous work experience, he testified, was cutting, perming and dyeing
hair. Rivers' son Ray mixed and bottled the drops by hand in plastic
buckets. His previous job: digging swimming pools.</TE>
<TE>   Later, E'Ola contracted with a private laboratory to produce AMP II.
Even then, the drops were not tested for safety, company officials
testified, and there was no quality control.</TE>
<TE>   Tests conducted for the plaintiffs by an independent laboratory showed
that the amount of ephedrine in the drops could differ by as much as 100%
from one batch to the next.</TE>
<TE>   For a time, E'Ola officials tried to make the diet drops purely with
herbal ephedra. But the herbal concoction was too weak, they testified,
and sales plummeted. E'Ola then added synthetic ephedrine hydrochloride
to boost the supplement's potency, testimony showed.</TE>
<TE>   Ephedrine hydrochloride is the prime ingredient in the street drug
methamphetamine and is a controlled substance under the nation's drug
laws. Inside the body, it breaks down into the same chemical constituents
as herbal ephedrine, but its effect is even more powerful.</TE>
<TE>   It is illegal to put ephedrine hydrochloride in a product marketed as
an herbal supplement. The substance was not listed as an ingredient on
AMP II bottles.</TE>
<TE>   The drops that Talbert took contained ephedrine hydrochloride, but
Vollertsen did not try to prove that it, in particular, caused her
stroke. Rather, he introduced the evidence of spiking in an effort to
paint E'Ola as a rogue company unconcerned with customer safety.</TE>
<TE>   However slapdash its methods, E'Ola was a success. The AMP II drops,
the company's main product, brought in as much as $50 million annually,
testimony showed. Don Rivers was paid as much as $10 million a year.</TE>
<TE>Defense Insists on Proof</TE>
<TE>   Vollertsen's star witness was Dr. George A. Ricaurte, a Johns Hopkins
University neurology professor who had served on a special FDA panel on
ephedrine.</TE>
<TE>   Ricaurte testified about incidents reported to the FDA that linked
ephedrine to serious side effects. Defense lawyers objected, arguing that
the reports had not been scientifically verified.</TE>
<TE>   When the judge overruled the objection, the defense challenged
Ricaurte to cite a single medical study proving that ephedrine
supplements caused strokes.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're asking me has anyone ever taken a group of patients and
given them increasing doses of ephedrine to see if we can produce
strokes, no. That would be unethical," Ricaurte replied. But, he added,
"there is a vast literature that makes a compelling case that these
ephedrine alkaloids have the potential to produce stroke in living human
beings that had no risk factors."</TE>
<TE>   The defense countered with Dr. Lorne S. Label, a neurologist from
Thousand Oaks. In a written report, Label cited two possible causes for
Talbert's stroke: high blood pressure and lupus, an autoimmune disorder
that attacks blood vessels and the brain.</TE>
<TE>   Once on the stand, Label voiced a different opinion: that Talbert was
felled by "a showering" of microscopic clots that blocked the blood flow
in her brain.</TE>
<TE>   He went on to cite "risk factors" that he said made Talbert
particularly susceptible, including her occasional use of alcohol and her
weight--130 pounds on a 5-foot-1 frame, which he described as obese.</TE>
<TE>   Rivers, the company founder, also took the stand. He defended his
product, saying he had no knowledge that AMP II drops had ever been
linked to heart attacks or strokes.</TE>
<TE>   E'Ola's attorney, Phillip J. Eide, hammered away at the lack of
scientific studies proving that the level of ephedrine in recommended
doses of AMP II was dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not dangerous," Eide told the jury. "It doesn't cause heart
attacks, doesn't cause strokes, doesn't cause any kind of dangerous
reaction."</TE>
<TE>   As the trial wore on, Superior Court Judge John Reese grew indignant
at the testimony of E'Ola officials. In a conference with the lawyers in
his chambers, he likened the company's position to keeping one's "head in
the sand: 'I don't care how many people have died from it, there's no
scientific method that proved it.'</TE>
<TE>   "This is the sort of case that could have been brought as a criminal
case," Reese said in one closed-door conference. ". . . It's just
outrageous conduct by these people."</TE>
<TE>   Jurors did not see it that way. After deliberating 5 1/2 hours, they
voted, 10 to 2, against Talbert. She would get nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Talbert was stunned. "I spent many a night awake thinking about it and
crying," she said. "I felt numb for quite a while afterward."</TE>
<TE>   Vollertsen bolstered her spirit, insisting that they had merely lost
the first round. In early 1999, he filed a motion for a new trial. Soon,
new evidence would surface--evidence that would blast a hole in E'Ola's
trial defense.</TE>
<TE>FDA Papers Revealing</TE>
<TE>   A year earlier, Vollertsen had requested FDA documents on E'Ola under
the Freedom of Information Act. Now, two months after the end of the
trial, the agency had finally produced the records.</TE>
<TE>   They showed, as Judge Reese later wrote, that "E'Ola officials
perjured themselves. . . . E'Ola was made aware by the FDA of incidents
or injuries and strokes caused by their product." Nevertheless, the judge
wrote, "E'Ola falsely testified that they were unaware of injuries."</TE>
<TE>   The judge found that E'Ola had misled jurors on another crucial point.
Eide told the jury that the FDA had never taken enforcement action
against E'Ola. The newly released documents showed otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA's authority over supplements was narrow, but it had used that
authority against E'Ola. In 1992, the agency cited the company for
claiming that the AMP II drops had medicinal value as an asthma
treatment, and for spiking them with ephedrine hydrochloride.</TE>
<TE>   The judge ordered a new trial.</TE>
<TE>   It began Jan. 2, 2001, 5 1/2 years after Talbert had collapsed at the
state park campground. By then, her case had been strengthened
considerably by two new medical studies.</TE>
<TE>   In the first, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, UC San
Francisco researchers linked dietary supplements such as E'Ola's to as
many as 10 deaths and 20 heart attacks and strokes reported to the FDA
over a two-year period.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, researchers found, the victims had received much lower
doses of ephedrine than users of the E'Ola drops were getting.</TE>
<TE>   The same issue of the medical journal reported the results of a Yale
University study of stroke victims that led to a nationwide recall of
diet drugs and cold remedies containing phenylpropanolamine, or PPA--a
compound closely related to ephedrine.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers found that using appetite suppressants with PPA (since
banned in the U.S.) increased the risk of stroke in young women 17-fold.</TE>
<TE>   Both studies were introduced as evidence in the second trial.</TE>
<TE>   The defense had a new lineup of experts and a new theory to explain
Talbert's stroke. Dr. Wade Smith, director of stroke services at UC San
Francisco and a defense expert, said the likely cause was a tear in an
artery in Talbert's neck.</TE>
<TE>   In his closing argument, Vollertsen appealed to jurors to send a
message.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is how loudly you're going to speak with your verdict,"
he said. "We are asking you to speak loudly enough to be heard. The
louder you speak, the farther away you will be heard."</TE>
<TE>'Outrageous' Conduct</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 7, 2001, the jury found for Talbert, deciding by an 11-1 vote
that the AMP II drops had caused her stroke and that E'Ola had
misrepresented a defective product as safe.</TE>
<TE>   On the issue of damages, the jurors spoke loudly. They awarded Talbert
$13.3 million--$1.3 million to cover her medical bills, lost earnings and
other expenses, and $12 million in punitive damages to penalize E'Ola for
"outrageous" conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Rivers, who had earned more than $25 million from E'Ola, was
personally ordered to pay more than half the judgment. The rest was to
come from the company itself and Reis, the president.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the trial judge reduced the total damages to about $13.1
million, but otherwise upheld the jury's decision.</TE>
<TE>   E'Ola is contesting the verdict in Alaska's appellate courts, and
Talbert will not receive any money until the appeals are exhausted.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, the FDA again took action against E'Ola for putting
ephedrine hydrochloride in its diet drops. At the FDA's request, U.S.
marshals raided E'Ola's headquarters and seized its entire stock of AMP
II, as well as its supplies of ephedrine hydrochloride.</TE>
<TE>   Under threat of further FDA seizures, the company has stopped selling
AMP II.</TE>
<TE>   But there was nothing to prevent E'Ola from launching new ephedrine
products: ThermoAMP drops and foil-wrapped, chocolate-flavored ThermoAMP
Herbal Chews. Both contain caffeine and ephedrine--the combination that
prompted the 1994 FDA warning about possible heart attacks and strokes.</TE>
<TE>   E'Ola insists its products are safe. Eileen Harding, a company vice
president, said in a statement: "We are proud of our entire product line.
E'Ola has served the dietary and health needs of millions of satisfied
customers, and we will continue to do so."</TE>
<TE>   Talbert is back at her job at Chugach Electric. She is still unsteady
on her feet, has difficulty speaking and has not regained full use of her
left hand. Her doctors have barred her from volleyball.</TE>
<TE>   She expressed disappointment that new E'Ola products have replaced the
AMP II drops but said she feels vindicated.</TE>
<TE>   "We just hope we got their attention and that the next time the
company makes decisions affecting consumer health, they'll act
responsibly and put health before profit."</TE>

<TE>Ancient Treatment Came West in 1920s
   Ephedrine is derived from ephedra, a shrub that thrives in semi-arid
regions of Asia. Often called by its Chinese name, ma huang, ephedra is a
stimulant to the heart and nervous system. It has been used in China for
more than 4,000 years to treat asthma and upper respiratory infections.
It was introduced into Western medicine in the 1920s.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, ephedrine has become a popular, and controversial,
ingredient in dietary supplements. The Food and Drug Administration says
it has received reports of hundreds of strokes, heart attacks and other
"adverse events" associated with ephedrine. Supplement makers say there
is no scientific evidence that ephedrine products are unsafe if taken at
recommended doses.</TE>
<TE>   Key dates in the controversy:</TE>
<TE>   * Oct. 25, 1994: President Clinton signs the Dietary Supplement Health
and Education Act, which permits supplement makers to market herbal
products without proving them safe and effective. The act is sponsored by
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), whose state is home to many supplement
companies.</TE>
<TE>   * June 2, 1997: The FDA proposes limiting the amount of ephedrine in
recommended doses of dietary supplements and requiring labels that warn
consumers that exceeding those doses could cause seizures, heart attacks
and strokes. The FDA later withdraws the proposal in the face of strong
industry and congressional opposition.</TE>
<TE>   * Feb. 7, 2001: An Anchorage jury awards Rosie Talbert $13.3 million
after concluding that ephedrine diet drops made by E'Ola International of
St. George, Utah, caused her stroke.</TE>
<TE>   * Aug. 3, 2001: Rashidi Wheeler, a Northwestern University football
player, collapses and dies during a workout. An autopsy identifies asthma
as the cause of death, but university officials say ephedrine may also
have played a role. Before the workout, Wheeler took two energy
supplements containing the substance. Wheeler's death was one of three
football fatalities that year in which ephedrine was suspected.</TE>
<TE>   * Sept. 8, 2001: The National Football League adds ephedrine to its
list of banned substances, following the lead of the National Collegiate
Athletic Assn. and the International Olympic Committee.</TE>
<TE>   * Jan. 10, 2002: Canadian health authorities call on manufacturers to
stop selling ephedrine supplements containing more than a certain dosage
level, or those that contain caffeine.</TE>

<HD>FBI Security Reform Sees More Use of Polygraphs</HD>
<DH>Espionage: Demands for bureau's director to make changes likely
will intensify after a panel reports on Hanssen saga.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>FBI officials said Wednesday that thousands of employees may be
subjected to polygraph tests in an effort to plug holes in
security--holes so glaring that even convicted spy Robert Philip Hanssen
now says he should have been caught years earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Catching in-house spies and guarding national security interests were
"not a priority" at the bureau in the past, FBI Director Robert Mueller
acknowledged to reporters. "Any employee should recognize in the wake of
Hanssen that we have to emphasize security more than we have."</LD>
<LD>   Mueller's stark assessment of the FBI's failings comes days before a
high-level commission is expected to deliver an even harsher critique of
why the bureau failed for more than two decades to realize that it had a
spy among its ranks.</LD>
<TE>   The Webster Commission, headed by former FBI and CIA Director William
H. Webster, is expected to release its much-awaited report on the Hanssen
debacle later this week, probably Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The report concludes that the Hanssen episode--the worst case of
espionage within the FBI in the bureau's history--grew out of "a
pervasive inattention to security. . . . In the bureau, security is often
viewed as an impediment to operations, and security responsibilities are
seen as an impediment to career advancement," according to an official
familiar with the report.</TE>
<TE>   The report also says the FBI needs to establish a workplace culture
"that recognizes security lapses as significant, restricts access to
particular items of classified information to those who need them to
perform their jobs and makes disloyal employees more quickly visible,"
the official said.</TE>
<TE>   In several days of interviews with Webster Commission investigators,
Hanssen appeared to almost taunt his interrogators with his ability to
elude detection for 22 years after he began spying for Soviet Union in
1979.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Hanssen noted that he had given conflicting accounts to
the FBI during his career about where he got the money for a home
addition, yet the FBI did not pursue the discrepancies. Hanssen told the
Webster Commission that "if they [the FBI] had done a simple background
investigation, they would have caught me," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   The report also says that, in the early 1990s, at a time when Hanssen
appears to have taken a sabbatical from his espionage work, he approached
a Russian diplomat in a parking lot, but the Russian rebuffed his offer
to work for them. The Russian later formally complained to the United
States, saying that a disgruntled FBI agent had contacted him, according
to people familiar with the report. But the tip never led the bureau to
Hanssen.</TE>
<TE>   Demands for reform at the FBI seem certain to intensify once the
Webster Commission formally releases its findings, with Webster already
scheduled to discuss his report at a hearing next week before the Senate
Judiciary Committee.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Wednesday, Webster said the FBI "can do a lot and they
have done a lot. The important thing is to build within the tradition and
culture of the bureau a greater appreciation for the role that security
must play. It represents a cultural evolution."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), a member of the Judiciary
Committee, said Wednesday that, while he is heartened by Mueller's
willingness to embrace reform, "the challenge for the FBI is to make sure
that new bells and whistles for internal security don't distract FBI
leaders from the fundamental scrutiny required to catch spies" within the
bureau.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI moved Wednesday to slow the drumbeat for further reform by
rolling out for reporters what a senior official called "a total remake
of the [security] program from top to bottom."</TE>
<TE>   Although some details in the plan still are being worked out, Mueller
and Kenneth H. Senser, a CIA security specialist who has been assigned to
the FBI as an assistant director to lead the make-over, said they are
committing to plugging the security leaks at the bureau.</TE>
<TE>   Senser said the FBI has "accepted too much risk" in its security
operations, with a "fractured" or nonexistent hierarchy for overseeing
security, inexperienced security investigators and poor training.</TE>
<TE>   One key recommendation from the Webster Commission is expected to
center on the expanded use of polygraphs for employees who have access to
sensitive information.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI, which for years resisted giving its employees routine
polygraph tests, agreed last year in the wake of the Hanssen controversy
to begin polygraphs for a small group of about 700 employees who work in
intelligence operations.</TE>
<TE>   That trial run has worked well, Senser said, with a passing rate of
99% for those tested. Those few employees whose tests came back
"indeterminate" are being subjected to closer scrutiny and follow-up
reviews, but no disciplinary action has been taken against anyone, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Buoyed by the success of the test run, the FBI now is moving ahead
with a tentative plan to significantly expand the pool of employees who
would be subject to the tests. Although no final decision has been made,
Senser said it likely will include "an additional few thousand" employees
who will undergo questioning about unauthorized foreign contacts and the
like.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller said he wants to be careful not to subject agents to
unnecessary testing and risk harming morale in the process. "Nobody likes
taking a polygraph. I didn't particularly enjoy taking a polygraph."</TE>
<TE>   But many agents seem to have grudgingly accepted that as the next big
step in security.</TE>
<TE>   "We've known this was coming," said one senior agent who asked not to
be identified. "I don't get the feeling it's generating a lot of
heartburn. Any protests would probably fall on deaf ears anyway because,
in light of Hanssen, it's hard to make these same self-righteous kinds of
objections and say, 'What is it about me that you don't trust?' "</TE>
<TE>   The FBI also has moved to consolidate its security operation and give
it an elevated status in the chain of command, with Senser as an
assistant director below Mueller. The bureau also is considering a
permanent team of security investigators who are not FBI agents and can
dedicate themselves to detecting internal problems, Senser said.</TE>
<TE>   Such a move is consistent with the Webster report, which finds that
"security responsibilities are often foisted onto agents as collateral
duties, which they eagerly relinquish to return to criminal
investigations that promise career advancement."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI also is planning to beef up its auditing of agents' finances
and enhance its ability to track unauthorized computer use by employees.
Hanssen was able to search out his own name repeatedly in the FBI's
database to see whether anyone had opened an espionage investigation on
him--without ever attracting attention.</TE>
<TE>   On one occasion, the hard drive on Hanssen's computer broke. FBI
employees "noticed he had installed a commercially available system to
hack into other computer systems. The reaction from the bureau was,
'Well, that's Robert Hanssen. He's a computer nerd,' " the official said.</TE>
<TE>   The Webster report also notes other missed danger signs, such as
suspicions voiced about Hanssen around 1997 by Earl Pitts, a former FBI
agent who had been convicted of espionage charges for spying for Moscow.
Pitts said he had heard some "strange things" about Hanssen, but his
suspicions apparently did not reach security officials until three years
later, according to the official familiar with the report.</TE>
<TE>   "You would have needed a photo of Hanssen standing over a dead body
with a signed confession before the FBI would have investigated him for
it," the official said.</TE>

<HD>Europe Sees a Tinderbox in Its Streets</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Spate of anti- Semitic attacks has officials worried
about roxy fighting between Jewish and Arab groups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN
</DL>
<LD>With synagogues ablaze in France, firebombs defacing Jewish
property in Belgium and Orthodox Jews under attack on the streets of
Berlin, Europeans have been given notice that the raging violence in the
Middle East threatens their own peace and security.</LD>
<LD>   Germany, France and the Benelux countries are home to vibrant Jewish
communities and large groups of Arab immigrants who are increasingly at
risk of becoming proxy combatants in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as
Western countries appear helpless to intervene.</LD>
<LD>   European Union leaders, meeting in emergency session in Luxembourg on
Wednesday, called for a continental initiative to dispatch mediators to a
blood-soaked region where U.S. diplomats have so far failed to ease the
violence. But the vague plan being hashed out was clearly hobbled by the
pressure to be evenhanded while condemning Israel's campaign against the
Palestinians.</LD>
<TE>   In France, scene of the worst anti-Semitic outbursts in Europe during
the last week, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin deployed 1,100 national guard
troops to bolster security around Jewish religious sites and prevent
attacks by emboldened vandals. President Jacques Chirac condemned the
recent attacks on synagogues, cemeteries and kosher food shops as
criminal acts "unworthy of France."</TE>
<TE>   "Passions that flare up in the Middle East must not flare up here,"
Jospin warned. "Even if we have the largest Jewish community in Europe
and one of the largest Arab-Muslim communities on the European continent,
we must not import this violence."</TE>
<TE>   Chirac urged EU colleagues at the Luxembourg meeting to send a
delegation to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat to defuse the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   But the EU foreign ministers did more to expose their uncertainty over
how to intervene than to draft a coherent strategy for easing tensions.</TE>
<TE>   While agreeing to send EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and
Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Pique to the region, the European
diplomats mostly criticized U.S. efforts at containing the violence as
ineffective and too tolerant of the Israeli crackdown on Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   European leaders have been much more vocal than their U.S. allies in
criticizing Sharon's attempts to isolate and exile Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "It is clear [U.S.] mediation efforts have failed and we need new
mediation," European Commission President Romano Prodi told journalists.</TE>
<TE>   But Prodi also made it clear that the EU was unwilling to use its
clout as Israel's most important trade partner to pressure Sharon into
withdrawing forces from Palestinian territories. Neutral Switzerland, by
contrast, warned that it was reconsidering economic and military
cooperation with Israel in view of what it sees as the systematic
violation of Palestinian human rights.</TE>
<TE>   The Mideast flare-up is believed to be spurring attacks on Jewish
targets in Europe, including an incident in the Belgian city of Antwerp
on Wednesday in which unidentified attackers hurled two Molotov cocktails
at a synagogue. The vandals caused little damage and no injuries.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday night, two visiting U.S. Orthodox Jews were beaten on
Berlin's fashionable Kurfuerstendamm shopping street. On Tuesday, vandals
painted a swastika on a Jewish memorial in Berlin, and others managed to
lob a firebomb into the Charlottenburg Jewish cemetery on Saturday
despite a heavy police presence there and at all other Jewish religious
sites in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "The events in the Middle East have given right-wing extremists the
impression they can lash out because they think there is now greater
sympathy" for their acts against Jewish people and property, said Henning
Riecke, an analyst with the German Foreign Policy Society. "They think
they are taking advantage of an opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Ali Maarouf, a spokesman for a coalition of more than three dozen Arab
groups in Berlin, expressed concern that the recent outbursts of
anti-Semitic violence could discredit the rightful aspirations of the
Palestinian people and weaken international resolve to come to their aid.</TE>
<TE>   "Such attacks are damaging to our just fight against the occupation in
the Middle East and against the worst attacks of Israel for a long time,"
Maarouf told the Berliner Zeitung daily. "By such actions, the public is
being distracted from the main problem."</TE>
<TE>   Germany is host to the fastest-growing Jewish community outside
Israel, with immigrants from Eastern Europe swelling the ranks from
barely 30,000 a decade ago to more than 100,000 today. But refugees and
asylum seekers from Arab countries outnumber them tenfold.</TE>
<TE>   A strong pro-Palestinian bias was clearly visible over the weekend
when thousands who gathered for traditional Easter human rights
demonstrations demanded that Israel withdraw from Ramallah and other
Palestinian cities and condemned U.S. tolerance of Sharon's retaliatory
offensive following a spate of Palestinian suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer has warned fellow Europeans
that unless the clashes are halted, the Mideast violence threatens "a
destabilization of the entire region" and dangerous spillover into
Europe's ethnically diverse and volatile cities.</TE>
<TE>   "The aggravation of the crisis in the Middle East risks opening a
wound that could infect the whole world," Italian Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi said during a visit to Moscow on Wednesday. "All efforts must
be made to open negotiations in which Europe and Russia could have a
greater role and contribute to finding a peaceful solution. . . . There
is the risk that the Israeli-Palestinian crisis could evolve into a
conflict of all Islam against the West."</TE>
<TE>   The risks of parallel conflicts on the continent were clear at Paris'
Orly Airport on Tuesday when pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian
demonstrators brandished fists and hurled insults at each other while
awaiting the return of French activists expelled from Israel for visiting
Arafat at his besieged offices in Ramallah. Police had to be summoned to
separate the protesters.</TE>
<TE>   Sentiment against the Israeli offensive is strong here in Germany.
Fischer warned that Arafat should be granted freedom of movement and
allowed to meet with foreign mediators, and Swedish Prime Minister Goran
Persson said Arafat is still key to finding a negotiated solution. French
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine denounced Sharon's approach as an
"obsessive focus on Arafat, as though he was the organizer of
everything."</TE>
<TE>   The EU's Solana has suggested that both Sharon and Arafat step down to
allow more coolheaded leaders to be heard.</TE>
<TE>   "Neither is a saint, and sometimes I'm inclined to think that perhaps
a new generation of persons in Israel and Palestine could in the 21st
century come up with a solution to the conflict," he told a Spanish radio
interviewer.</TE>
<TE>   Other political analysts and politicians warn that Israel is
squandering its moral capital in its assault on Palestinian cities and
towns.</TE>
<TE>   "Many Jews living outside the Jewish state have begun to wonder if the
price of combating these terrorists is worth paying," British lawmaker
Gerald Kaufman, a Jewish member of Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor
Party, noted in a recent commentary. "They are beginning to wonder
whether the country they have toiled in and fought wars to defend . . .
is so degrading itself as to be a very different land from the one they
have loved."</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,200 Palestinians and 400 Israelis have been killed since
Palestinians began their revolt against Israeli rule in September 2000.
The uprising has triggered a series of escalations, with the latest and
most intensive Israeli military crackdown following Palestinian suicide
bombings that have killed dozens during the Passover holiday.</TE>

<HD>Arafat Lives With Enemy Breathing Down His Neck</HD>
<DH>Scene: As Israeli forces hunker down, life inside Ramallah compound
has become a waiting game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Yasser Arafat spends his days on the telephone, at least when he
can get a dial tone. He sleeps little, eats less.</LD>
<LD>   With him inside his battered, besieged headquarters is a motley crew
of foreign activists, a large contingent of bodyguards, a couple of
trusted aides and wanted criminals, and the presidential bagpipe players.</LD>
<LD>   Just outside the door sits the Israeli army.</LD>
<TE>   Two decades after Ariel Sharon helped evict Arafat from his Beirut
domain, the Israeli prime minister has once again locked down
hisarchnemesis. Wednesday was Day 6 of the siege on the Palestinian
Authority president, part of a massive reoccupation of the West Bank by
Israeli forces pursuing what they call an anti-terrorist campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Arafat used his imprisonment as a platform. He granted
media interviews and mugged for the cameras as a martyr-in-waiting. His
suddenly renewed celebrity infuriated Sharon, and Israeli forces were
ordered to put a hermetic clamp on Arafat's compound.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat so deftly played the public relations game that the influential
Israeli daily Haaretz wondered whether Sharon would end up exorcising his
private ghost or beatifying him.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few days, Arafat hasn't appeared on television, except for
a phone-in interview, and journalists' access has been all but cut off.
At least physically, Arafat is isolated within a single building at the
center of the sprawling compound. Politically, however, his ordeal has
enhanced his stature with many in the Palestinian territories and in
other parts of the world--at least in the short term.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the compound, Arafat's associates and supporters have
barricaded the windows, and they take turns keeping guard while settling
into a kind of routine of captivity. The atmosphere, as described by
several people in telephone interviews, seems part bunker, part college
dorm.</TE>
<TE>   Some people sleep in hallways and on the floor. Food, heavy on pita
bread and boiled potatoes, is in short supply and must be rationed. The
bagpipers don't even have their instruments. A lot of time is spent
keeping up one another's spirits.</TE>
<TE>   Nerves are clearly fraying. Toilets are backing up. And Israeli forces
have placed barbed wire around the building where Arafat and the rest are
confined.</TE>
<TE>   "It is still very difficult," Arafat's office manager, Zafir Nobani,
said by phone. "We are running out of water, and the phones don't work.
We are also low on food. We can't move--nobody can move."</TE>
<TE>   Nobani said Arafat remains well and in high spirits. But the
Palestinian leader has only a two-day supply of medicine, Nobani said. He
wouldn't specify what kind of medicine the 72-year-old Arafat needs.</TE>
<TE>   (In Jordan, Dr. Ashraf Kurdi, the neurologist who regularly examines
Arafat, told Associated Press that Arafat's routine checkup is four
months overdue and that the Palestinian leader should have one as soon as
possible.)</TE>
<TE>   Photographs show Arafat working at a desk, a gun by his side. His
statements reflect a tone that is increasingly defiant and fatalistic. He
would rather die for the cause than surrender, he says repeatedly, always
adding, "Martyr, martyr, martyr, martyr."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat whiles away the hours with occasional praying, reading the
Koran, receiving the phone calls that make it through and calling out
whenever he gets a line. Nobani said Arafat communicates with regional
Palestinian governors to keep abreast of Israeli military actions and
with European officials to prod world reaction.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat has a mobile phone, but Nobani and others inside the compound
are convinced that the Israelis are blocking the signal.</TE>
<TE>   "The connection is very difficult," Nobani said. "There is no signal."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli government officials said Arafat's entourage, which reportedly
numbers about 300, exaggerates the hardships for political gain. The army
released a list detailing supplies it says it shipped to Arafat on
Tuesday, including 600 pieces of bread, 13 cans of hummus, 66 packages of
yellow cheese, 55 cans of sardines and 145 pounds of coffee.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis say that when Arafat gave a now-famous television
interview by candlelight the other day, he in fact had electricity but
chose candles for effect. Those inside the compound didn't comment on the
incident, but they said electricity comes and goes.</TE>
<TE>   The odd addition to the compound's inhabitants is the foreign
delegation. Thirty-four peace and anti-globalization activists from half
a dozen countries remain inside. They are part of a larger group that, to
the shock of many, marched past the Israeli tanks and infantry Sunday and
made themselves at home at Arafat's side. They brought a CNN crew, and
the images from their visit ricocheted around the world.</TE>
<TE>   The activists said their idea was to serve as human shields for
Arafat, whom many thought Sharon intended to kill.</TE>
<TE>   "The first few days, it was a kind of psychological warfare,"
Israeli-Canadian peace activist Neta Golan said. The Israeli army "was
throwing sound bombs and moving the tanks back and forth. It made sure
everyone was on their toes. Now they've stopped all that, so we are even
more on our toes."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat makes regular appearances to the foreign volunteers, sometimes
sitting with them for breakfast, or at least for a chat.</TE>
<TE>   "He looks strong, determined, and it's clear that he is determined to
leave here free or resist," Golan said.</TE>
<TE>   Caoimhe Butterly, an Irish activist, said that the real fears of the
first days have subsided and that the dynamics within the compound are
somewhat more relaxed.</TE>
<TE>   "It was more chaotic and uncertain at first," she said. "But now the
atmosphere is a little lighter. People are more confident that while this
will be difficult, it will end."</TE>
<TE>   The only public comments from Arafat in the last three days have been
in an interview with satellite television network Al Jazeera. They came
in response to Sharon's offer of a one-way ticket into exile.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it his homeland or mine?" Arafat said. "We have been planted here
since before our prophet Abraham came here." And then he cited a Koranic
verse.</TE>
<TE>   Although those around him claim that Arafat remains upbeat, he
routinely cites the last time he was under siege--in Beirut, his
tormentor Sharon then as well. Until the U.S. government helped negotiate
his departure, Arafat held out for 88 days.</TE>

<HD>Musharraf's Sights Set on a Referendum</HD>
<DH>Politics: The Pakistani president is expected Friday to announce a
national vote. Critics say his bid to extend his rule violates the
constitution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>President Pervez Musharraf is expected Friday to announce a
referendum that he hopes will give him five more years in power despite
opposition charges that the plan violates the constitution.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistan's Cabinet and National Security Council, which includes the
heads of the armed services, said Wednesday that they "unanimously
approved the holding of a national referendum on important national
issues."</LD>
<LD>   The official statement added that Musharraf will speak to the nation
Friday "to take the people into confidence on the details of the
referendum." But Musharraf has been suggesting for weeks that he will
seek a popular mandate through a referendum, which could come in May.</LD>
<TE>   Opposition parties and religious groups have warned against the move,
and radical Muslim leader Fazlur Rehman is already calling for his more
than 550,000 supporters to boycott any referendum.</TE>
<TE>   "Musharraf has abrogated the constitution, and there is a punishment
for that," Rehman, who heads the Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Islam party, said in
an interview. "If he were not the president, he would be in jail."</TE>
<TE>   Rehman was in police custody for more than five months until he was
released two weeks ago. He had been held as a threat to public order, but
Musharraf has allowed several radical Islamic leaders to go free in
recent weeks, along with hundreds of their supporters, in an apparent
attempt to build support in advance of the referendum.</TE>
<TE>1999 Coup Brought General to Power</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf overthrew Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a bloodless coup in
October 1999.</TE>
<TE>   He allowed Sharif and his family to go into exile in Saudi Arabia in
December 2000 after the deposed prime minister was convicted of
corruption and conspiracy to hijack Musharraf's plane on the eve of the
coup.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Musharraf named himself president, but Pakistan's Supreme
Court ruled that he must restore full democracy, with parliamentary
elections, by next October. Musharraf had dissolved parliament after the
coup.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States, Western
governments also were pressing Musharraf to give up power and return
Pakistan to democratic rule. Now that the army general is a key ally in
the war against terrorism, he faces no foreign pressure to step down.</TE>
<TE>   Cold War military ruler Gen. Zia ul-Haq had similar support from
Washington in the 1980s because he provided a secret conduit for weapons
to the moujahedeen fighters in neighboring Afghanistan during the war to
end Soviet occupation there.</TE>
<TE>   Zia held a referendum to legitimize his rule at the end of martial law
in 1984. His opponents alleged widespread fraud and said a massive
boycott left him with less than 10% support among the electorate. But the
electoral commission reported that 62% of eligible voters had endorsed
him.</TE>
<TE>   Less than four years later, on Aug. 17, 1988, Zia died in a mysterious
plane crash, along with the U.S. ambassador, the American defense attache
to Pakistan and 27 other people, including several high-ranking military
officers.</TE>
<TE>   The Pakistan People's Party, whose former leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto
was ousted as prime minister and then hanged by Zia, predicted this week
that the nation's main political parties would tell their supporters to
boycott Musharraf's referendum.</TE>
<TE>   Bhutto's daughter Benazir, also a former prime minister, is in exile
and would probably have to face corruption charges if she returned to
Pakistan. But her party has repeatedly said she will do precisely that to
stand in parliamentary elections set for October.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Pakistani Constitution, the head of state is elected by the
two houses of parliament. If he won the referendum, Musharraf's rule
would thus be established before the parliamentary elections are held.</TE>
<TE>Vote Could Turn Into a Violent Campaign</TE>
<TE>   Some Pakistani analysts have warned that a national vote on
Musharraf's rule could turn into a violent campaign against the
increasing role of the U.S. military and FBI investigators here as they
go after suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban members in Pakistan and
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "Pakistan has become a police station of America, and Musharraf is the
senior head officer," Rehman said, with a hearty laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Six radical Islamic groups in the United Action Committee, which
includes Rehman's party, announced Tuesday that they will stage protests
in several cities to demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   But similar threats fizzled out after the U.S. launched the war in
Afghanistan last fall, and Musharraf may be calculating that what he
calls the "silent majority" will ignore a boycott call by Islamic
hard-liners and more mainstream political parties.</TE>
<TE>   Using a tactic that served him well during the crisis immediately
after Sept. 11, Musharraf has met with some of his biggest enemies, along
with leading editors and commentators, in recent weeks in an effort to
build support.</TE>
<TE>   His interior minister, Moinuddin Haider, said Sunday that Musharraf is
confident of winning a referendum.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll be in a stronger position to provide strong leadership to the
country for the continuation of his reform policy and policies against
terrorism," Haider told a local newspaper.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Base Looks a Lot Like Home</HD>
<DH>Kyrgyzstan: The Air Force has built an almost comfy tent city in an
ex-Soviet republic. And it appears that troops may stay awhile.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan
</DL>
<LD>This is one of the less likely outposts of the war against
terrorism: French fighter pilots lift off from an American base in a
former Soviet republic near China to attack suspected terrorists in
Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   The airfield serving the capital of Kyrgyzstan is one of 13 bases that
the Pentagon has quietly established in nine Middle Eastern and Central
Asian countries neighboring Afghanistan. The Defense Department calls
them "expeditionary airfields."</LD>
<LD>   In some cases, the Pentagon doesn't even acknowledge the existence of
these bases, most of them in Muslim countries where any American presence
is highly problematic. But here in Kyrgyzstan, at least, all signs point
to a lengthy stay.</LD>
<TE>   When Air Force Brig. Gen. Christopher A. Kelly and a vanguard of 26
officials arrived the day after Christmas, there was little here--no
cargo yard, no U.S. or allied aircraft and none of the 275 temporary
structures that today make up the coalition's tent city.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, this area where we're standing right now was nothing but a
boneyard of broken-down Russian aircraft and Kyrgyz aircraft," recalled
Air Force Master Sgt. Gerritt McCrory.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with the spartan U.S. Army base in Kandahar, Afghanistan, the
Air Force has erected a palace here, complete with hot meals and tents
with central heating. The site is already home to 650 Americans, 250
French, a handful of Spaniards and at least one South Korean. The total
is expected to reach 2,000.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. agreement with the Kyrgyz government to use the Manas air
base lasts only until December. But it continues thereafter unless either
nation opts out. And it will be August before all the planes arrive.</TE>
<TE>   "After what we've done here, we're not going to want to tear it down
after a year and bulldoze it," said Col. Billy Montgomery, Kelly's chief
of staff.</TE>
<TE>   The site is officially described as a refueling base for planes flying
in and out of Afghanistan. But the coalition plans to crowd the runway
with C-5, C-17 and C-141 cargo planes, French and Turkish refueling
tankers, commercial 747s and Russian-built Antonov 225s. The facility is
already moving cargo to bases in the Afghan cities of Kandahar, Bagram
and Mazar-i-Sharif.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and coalition partners also have begun to operate C-130 cargo
planes, KC-135 and other refueling tankers, and Marine F/A-18 Hornet and
French Mirage fighters, like those used in the attack on suspected Al
Qaeda and Taliban forces in the fierce battle last month in the Shahi Kot
valley.</TE>
<TE>   Although the United States is unlikely to station forces permanently
at Manas, "what usually happens is, we leave behind a great deal of
equipment, a great deal of relationships and experience that essentially
put that base on the list of places from which we can now operate in the
future," said Michele Flournoy, a former Pentagon official now with the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we'll stay here as long as the relationship is good,"
Montgomery said.</TE>
<TE>   The relationship is good for good reason: It's a lucrative arrangement
for the Kyrgyz. The U.S. military presence is expected to pump more than
$40 million into the weak local economy this year. That doesn't include
visits by troops to Bishkek, where $30 buys dinner and caviar for four at
one of the capital's priciest bistros.</TE>
<TE>   Manas holds two attractions for the anti-terrorism coalition. It is
relatively close to the war and has an unusually
long--13,800-foot--runway built to accommodate Soviet bombers. The base
lies less than 1,000 miles from Kandahar, a three-hour flight for heavy
cargo aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it also has serious limitations. Commercial aircraft use the site,
and customs agents in Soviet-style olive uniforms pore at length over
each visitor's identification. There is room for only four C-17 or C-5
cargo planes to park along the taxiway, so crews are discouraged from
staying overnight. Turkish and Italian commanders would like to operate
here, but there's not enough room.</TE>
<TE>   As with some other allies in the anti-terrorism coalition, Kyrgyzstan
has additional issues. Human rights are sometimes regarded as optional;
American diplomats are pleading with their Kyrgyz hosts to free jailed
opposition members of parliament.</TE>
<TE>   However, on invitation of the government, U.S. Army Special Forces
soldiers began training local soldiers here well before Sept. 11. That
cooperation has been enhanced with new training of border guards, carried
out through the State Department.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has learned the hard way the dangers of being unwanted,
through such incidents as the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers military
housing complex in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 U.S. servicemen. And even
though U.S. troops are here at the invitation of the Kyrgyz government,
this largely Muslim region holds risks for Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Among them is the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, whose goal is to
carve out a Muslim republic spanning several nations in the region.
Members of the group are thought to have fought alongside Al Qaeda in
Afghanistan and were among the targets of French fighter jets based here.</TE>
<TE>   To protect the airfield against threats, commandos from Moody Air
Force Base in Valdosta, Ga., patrol rural hamlets within about a
four-mile perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   As more than a dozen U.S. troops rolled through an agricultural
village called Vostuchny, they encountered watchful scrutiny, handshakes
and children who reached out to touch the Americans' rifles. Most of the
Kyrgyz seemed friendly.</TE>
<TE>   "They should have come long ago," Alec Kurbanov, who served in the
Soviet army from 1972 to 1974 and looks two decades older than his 49
years, said in Russian through a translator. "We don't hold anything
against them, as long as they have peace in mind."</TE>
<TE>   Others were more skeptical. A man who identified himself only as
Sergei expressed concern about the Americans' weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "You carry guns, as you are surrounded by all these kids," he said in
Russian. "I believe you could have talked to the villagers without your
weapons."</TE>
<TE>   Then he raised the same complaint that Osama bin Laden has cited as
justification for attacking Americans: "What is your reason for being in
Saudi Arabia?"</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, camp commander Kelly meets several times a week with his
Kyrgyz liaison, Gen. Boris Polluto, who served as a Soviet soldier during
the Cold War. Back then he was poised to do battle with the man who now
calls him a good friend.</TE>
<TE>   Few of the American troops ever expected to be here.</TE>
<TE>   Said Airman 1st Class Ben Frankenberry, a 19-year-old Seattle native
who was just deployed here from the Pacific island of Guam, "My recruiter
left this part off the video."</TE>

<HD>Former Argentine Minister Arrested in Arms Case</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Once a dominant government figure, Domingo Cavallo
is accused of approving illegal weapons sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's controversial former economy minister,
was arrested Wednesday in a case involving illegal arms sales to Croatia
and Ecuador in the 1990s.</LD>
<LD>   Cavallo's detention came at the end of an hourlong court session in
which Judge Julio Speroni questioned him about the arms deals, which sent
$100 million worth of ammunition, gunpowder, mortars and other weapons to
the two countries, which were then under an international arms embargo.</LD>
<LD>   The arrest of the man who just months ago was a dominant figure in the
Argentine government was only the latest in a series of judicial actions
against top officials in the administration of former President Fernando
de la Rua, who resigned Dec. 20 in the face of massive street protests
over the country's shattered economy.</LD>
<TE>   "He has the clean conscience of a man who knows he did nothing against
the law," said Guillermo Contini, a member of Congress and a Cavallo
ally. "I believe this is more political persecution than a judicial
decision."</TE>
<TE>   Cavallo was implicated in the arms-trafficking case because he signed
the decrees that allowed the sale of 6,500 tons of arms and ammunition
that were destined, ostensibly, for Venezuela and Panama. The true
destination of the shipments was uncovered after Argentine peacekeeping
troops stationed in the former Yugoslav federation came across some of
the weapons and alerted authorities.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the charges, Cavallo said he signed the documents as a
matter of routine and that he had no idea they would be used to hide an
illicit transaction.</TE>
<TE>   Cavallo, 55, was being held in a military facility also occupied by
former Security Minister Enrique Mathov, who has been charged with
misconduct in connection with the deaths of five people shot by police in
the hours before De la Rua's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, De la Rua was brought in to answer questions before a
judge investigating the police repression of the demonstrations against
him. Former federal Police Chief Ruben Santos is also under arrest in the
case.</TE>
<TE>   The arms sales that Judge Speroni is investigating occurred during the
administration of another discredited Argentine president, Carlos Menem,
for whom Cavallo was economy minister from 1991 to 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Menem, accused of orchestrating the arms-smuggling scheme, was placed
under house arrest for six months last year by an investigating judge but
was released.</TE>
<TE>   A congressional commission is also investigating Cavallo for his
actions in De la Rua's government.</TE>
<TE>   Elisa Carrio, who heads the commission, said Cavallo's arrest brought
her "immense happiness." Her panel is investigating suspected
irregularities in the large-scale conversion of Argentina's public debt.
"Truth and justice will return to Argentina," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Cavallo is being investigated by another judge for telling banks to
ignore court orders overturning restrictions on cash withdrawals imposed
during the De la Rua administration.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Cavallo has become one of the most reviled figures of
the nation's political class, a man whose name is synonymous with
Argentina's economic crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Under Menem, Cavallo's orthodox policies helped orchestrate a boom in
the Argentine economy. De la Rua brought Cavallo into his government last
year, but the Harvard-educated economist, a favorite of the international
banking community, failed in his attempt to rescue Argentina from its
ever-deepening recession. He resigned hours before De la Rua himself
stepped down.</TE>

<LD>Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee began a tour of the
riot-racked western state of Gujarat today, hours after fresh religious
violence erupted.</LD>
<LD>   Vajpayee inspected the ruins of a train in Godhra whose torching by a
Muslim mob Feb. 27 triggered sectarian rioting. Fifty-eight people were
burned alive in the train, which was carrying Hindu nationalists.</LD>
<LD>   Vajpayee's arrival came after 10 people died Wednesday in Gujarat,
including a family of five Muslims who were burned to death by a Hindu
mob on the outskirts of Ahmadabad, the commercial capital.</LD>

<DL>AHMADABAD, India
</DL>
<LD>Ten people died as violence flared once again in India's
riot-racked Gujarat state Wednesday, a day ahead of a visit by the prime
minister to the area where more than 800 people have died in Hindu-Muslim
bloodshed that began in February.</LD>
<LD>   The latest victims included a family of five Muslims who were burned
to death by a Hindu mob on the outskirts of Ahmadabad, Gujarat's
commercial capital.</LD>
<LD>   "Five charred bodies [of Muslims] were recovered . . . from one of
three houses burned by a Hindu mob," a senior police officer said. Four
others were hospitalized.</LD>
<TE>   One Muslim married to a Hindu was hacked to death in Ahmadabad, and
his body burned, while another Muslim was stabbed to death late
Wednesday, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Three other people were killed and 20 injured when police sought to
disperse Hindu and Muslim gangs hurling Molotov cocktails and throwing
stones at each other in Ahmadabad and in Umreth, 40 miles to the
southeast.</TE>
<TE>   It was the highest one-day death toll in the last two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has said he wants to take
"personal stock" of the situation during his first trip to the state
since the violence erupted.</TE>
<TE>   Gujarat, in western India, is ruled by Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party, which also heads the ruling federal coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Both the state and federal governments have been sharply criticized by
opposition parties for failing to act swiftly to stop the carnage in
which many victims were burned or hacked to death--a charge they have
denied.</TE>
<TE>   While the worst of the mayhem occurred at the end of February and the
beginning of March, the state has continued to simmer with sporadic
killings and arson attacks, and the violence has spread to rural areas
where there is little security presence.</TE>
<TE>   More than 35 areas across the state remain under curfew.</TE>
<TE>   During his daylong visit, Vajpayee will visit Godhra, 65 miles
southeast of here, where a Muslim mob torched a train carrying Hindus
from a disputed holy site, killing 58 people and triggering the wave of
savagery.</TE>

<HD>China Frees Tibetan Held Since 1983</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ZHENGZHOU, China
</DL>
<LD>The Chinese government has freed one of its longest-serving
political prisoners, a Tibetan teacher, in a release a leading activist
said was an attempt to please the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Tanak Jigme Sangpo, 76, was set free Sunday from Drapchi Prison in
Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, after nearly 19 years, said John Kamm,
president of the San Francisco-based Dui Hua Foundation. Chinese
officials said Jigme Sangpo was released on medical parole, Kamm said.</LD>
<LD>   Jigme Sangpo was arrested in September 1983 and sentenced to 15 years
in prison on charges of "counterrevolutionary incitement and propaganda"
for campaigning against Chinese rule in Tibet, according to Kamm.</LD>
<TE>   His sentence was extended twice and had been due to expire Sept. 3,
2011. Prison authorities exempted him from physical labor several years
ago because of his age, Kamm said.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing has made a practice in the last year of releasing prisoners
when it wants to curry favor with Washington over human rights, the most
persistent sticking point in China-U.S. relations.</TE>
<TE>   "It is clear to me . . . that this is being done by China in order to
improve relations with the United States," Kamm said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Rep. Tom Lantos, a Democrat from San Mateo, Calif., and a
prominent critic of the Chinese government, visited Beijing in January
and asked Chinese officials to reconsider Jigme Sangpo's case.</TE>
<TE>   "I deeply appreciate this humanitarian gesture by the Chinese," Lantos
said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Jigme Sangpo was one of five prisoners cited by U.S. Ambassador Clark
T. Randt Jr. during a Jan. 21 speech in Hong Kong.</TE>

<HD>Man Testifies About Alleged Kidnap Ordeal</HD>
<DH>Court: He says he was held for eight days, sometimes in a
box, over a business dispute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Houston man allegedly kidnapped in a 1999 dispute over a flying
device testified Wednesday he lost 20 pounds during the eight days he
was held--sometimes in a box--in North Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Bradley Wayne Barker, 47, said he was handcuffed the entire time
and could remember eating only one serving of soup and one slice of
pizza during the eight days.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the most scared I've ever been in my life," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Barker testified in the trial of his former business partner,
Thomas Laurence Stanley, 57, of Sugar Land, Texas, and a former
friend, Christopher James Wentzel, 54, of North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The men are accused in Superior Court in Van Nuys of kidnapping,
false imprisonment and extortion. They could face life in prison if
convicted. Both are free on bail.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants contend that they legally detained Barker, acting
as agents of an Arkansas bail bonds company. Barker, they said, had
jumped bail in an Arkansas commercial burglary case. The charge
against Barker in that case was later dropped.</TE>
<TE>   An employee of the bail bonds company testified last week that she
had authorized the defendants to detain Barker but learned later they
were not licensed as bail bond agents.</TE>
<TE>   Barker and Stanley were partners in American RocketBelt Corp.,
which designed and manufactured a single RocketBelt 2000. The Buck
Rogers-like jet backpack was designed to lift a person into the air
for a few seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Their three-year business relationship deteriorated about 1994
when the men fought over money and possession of the RocketBelt.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say the belt has been missing since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Barker testified Wednesday that Wentzel had called him in Texas in
November 1999 about a potential buyer for the belt, but Barker said
he was not interested. Barker also said he was invited by Wentzel to
Los Angeles for three days of work on a movie set that paid $450 a
day.</TE>
<TE>   Barker, who was awaiting trial in Arkansas on the burglary charge,
said he flew to Los Angeles but that the job never materialized.</TE>
<TE>   He testified he was met at the airport by Wentzel and the two went
boating. That evening, Barker said, they returned to Wentzel's North
Hollywood home, where Barker said he was held until he escaped
through a window on Dec. 3, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   For much of the eight days, Barker was kept in a wooden box or
forced to wear a pink velvet hood, authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   Barker said Wednesday he could not recall how long he had spent in
the box.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony, Barker said Wentzel had repeatedly asked him to
disclose the whereabouts of the RocketBelt.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he was going to murder me," Barker said.</TE>
<TE>   Barker said Wentzel and Stanley, who held a .40-caliber handgun,
forced him to sign a notarized affidavit waiving his legal rights to
the belt.</TE>
<TE>   The notary, Elyse Hoyt, a friend of Wentzel, also took the stand
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Hoyt said Barker signed the documents with one arm handcuffed to a
chair.</TE>
<TE>   Hoyt said she asked Barker whether he was signing the documents of
his own free will and that he said yes.</TE>
<TE>   "I did exactly as I was told," Barker said later in court.</TE>
<TE>   Also testifying Wednesday was Nancy Wright, whose brother was
Barker's business partner when found slain in his Houston apartment.
Wright said Stanley had told her he suspected Barker was linked to
the 1998 bludgeoning death of Joe Wright.</TE>
<TE>   She said Stanley had threatened to kidnap, torture and kill Barker
if Texas authorities did not charge Barker in her brother's death.
Barker has not been implicated in the killing.</TE>

<HD>Clinic Workers Block Street to Protest Closure</HD>
<DH>Eastside: Organized by union, dozens gather to demand that
nonprofit center be reopened.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 70 employees of a closed East Los Angeles nonprofit health
clinic and their supporters took over a busy Eastside intersection
Wednesday to dramatize their demands that the clinic operated by the
Community Health Foundation of East Los Angeles be reopened.</LD>
<LD>   The chanting protesters, with whistles and posters, marched
several blocks from the closed clinic to the intersection of Whittier
Boulevard and Indiana Street, where they congregated in the middle of
the street to set up a mock emergency room and treat "patients."</LD>
<LD>   Some truckers and others caught in the bottleneck angrily honked
horns, but could do little else as the protesters remained in the
intersection for 15 minutes. "All I'm trying to do is go straight on
Whittier," a UPS driver said as he sat in his idled delivery truck.</LD>
<TE>   Eventually, the protesters allowed him to drive through the
intersection.</TE>
<TE>   Although sheriff's deputies admonished the protest organizers
because they had no permit to march in the street, no citations were
issued for blocking the intersection. Indiana serves as the boundary
between the city of Los Angeles and unincorporated East L.A., but no
Los Angeles Police Department officers appeared to control the
clogged traffic on the Boyle Heights side of the intersection.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of Local 660 of the Service Employees International
Union organized the protest to demand that the nonprofit clinic at
3945 E. Whittier Blvd. be reopened because it served a largely
low-income region and provided cheap health care.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to straighten this out right now," said Dr. Darren Turko,
who worked at the clinic.</TE>
<TE>   In the past year, the foundation's 13 health clinics have closed
because of deficits reaching $6.5 million. The last two clinics, in
East Los Angeles and Bell, closed March 28.</TE>
<TE>   Allegations of financial mismanagement, including assertions that
the clinics double-billed patients or charged for services that
should have been free, have dogged the foundation. Its longtime
executive director and board of directors were forced to resign
because of growing concerns by federal, state and county officials
that funds were being squandered.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County officials have made arrangements for the
clinic's patients to go to other health providers in the area for
care, but the protesters said Wednesday that some outlets, such as
Clinica Oscar Romero in the Pico-Union district, were too far away
for Eastside patients.</TE>

<DH>Government: She reopens a field office, names chief of
staff and pushes for resources in her 2nd District on a busy first
day in office.</DH>

<LD>Wendy Greuel took the oath of office Wednesday for the Los Angeles
City Council's 2nd District seat and moved quickly to address neglect
that the east San Fernando Valley incurred because it has not had an
elected representative for five months.</LD>
<LD>   On her first day in office, Greuel reopened a long-closed council
field office in the Sunland-Tujunga area, named a Valley resident
with experience at City Hall as her chief of staff and asked the
council to restore funding for economic development along Commerce
Avenue in her district.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a very busy first day," said Greuel, who sat through a
three-hour council meeting before going to a public inauguration
celebration in North Hollywood attended by Mayor James K. Hahn and
many of her council colleagues.</LD>
<TE>   The celebration was held at Fair Avenue Elementary School, one of
the campuses that offers the LA's BEST after-school program, which
Greuel helped create as an aide to then-Mayor Tom Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel won election March 5 to the seat vacated in October by Joel
Wachs, who resigned to head an arts foundation in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel was sworn into office by U.S. 9th Circuit Judge Harry
Pregerson in front of about 500 people.</TE>
<TE>   In her speech, she called secession a real possibility and warned
that the city needs to improve services to the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "We can ignore the cries of the secessionists and invite a
political war, or we can address their concerns once and for all,"
Greuel said. "We can win them over by acknowledging the problems and
dedicating ourselves to solving them."</TE>
<TE>   She proposed community meetings, audits of city programs and a
blue-ribbon panel to determine whether each council district receives
its fair share of city services.</TE>
<TE>   During the City Council meeting at which she was sworn in, Greuel
introduced a motion to recover $165,000 that initially had been
proposed for economic redevelopment along Commerce Avenue in
Sunland-Tujunga but later was reallocated for another project.</TE>
<TE>   "I am asking for the funds to be reprogrammed back," she said.</TE>
<TE>   During a secession debate on the council floor, Greuel asked her
colleagues for support in trying to get more resources for the 2nd
District.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel, a Van Nuys resident, said that when she walked precincts
before the election, "the issue for voters was streets and police
services and public safety and fire, all those issues where they just
want the services to be delivered."</TE>
<TE>   To help her get the district's share of services, Greuel appointed
City Hall veteran Claire Bartels as chief of staff.</TE>
<TE>   Bartels is a former aide to Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, served
as project manager for the Marvin Braude Constituent Service Center
in Van Nuys and headed the Targeted Neighborhood Initiative program
under then-Mayor Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel, 40, introduced Bartels during an open house Wednesday for
a new council field office at 7747 Foothill Blvd. in Tujunga. The
area's previous field office was closed before Wachs left office, and
its reopening was a key promise during Greuel's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   A former executive with the entertainment company DreamWorks SKG,
Greuel said she was pleased to inherit Wachs' chairmanship of the
council's Housing and Community Development Committee, a key panel
for issues affecting her district.</TE>

<HD>Closing of Jail Delayed 3 Weeks</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Chief agrees to allow time for west San Fernando
Valley residents to comment. Foes fear result will be fewer officers
on patrol.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In response to an emergency request by the Los Angeles City Council
on Wednesday, Police Chief Bernard C. Parks agreed to delay Friday's
closure of the west San Fernando Valley jail for three weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Dennis Zine, a former police union official who has
frequently butted heads with the chief, said it was unfair to close
the jail in his district without giving residents a chance to
comment.</LD>
<LD>   The council approved an emergency motion seeking a delay so public
hearings can be held, and Parks late Wednesday agreed.</LD>
<TE>   Zine said the input from residents was important, especially
"after we convinced the people in the Valley to vote for Proposition
Q," a $600-million police bond measure on the March 5 ballot that
will pay for a new West Valley police station.</TE>
<TE>   Although a jail is not planned for the replacement station, Zine
said, the public should be able to comment on whether it should be.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to deceive the people of Los Angeles. They have been
deceived many times on bond measures," Zine said.</TE>
<TE>   The closure was planned because of a lack of detention officers,
said Jason Lee, a spokesman for Parks, who is seeking reappointment
to a second term. LAPD officers should not be taken off the streets
to replace those detention officers, Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, police officers are off the street manning the jails,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The closure originally was proposed five years ago as part of a
jail consolidation plan, and the current budget is counting on the
closure, Miscikowski said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an operational matter, consistent with budget approvals,
and is something the chief of police has discretion to choose or not
choose," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Zine said, however, that a sufficient number of detention officer
candidates are waiting to be hired but that city background checkers
have not moved quickly enough to fill the vacancies.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Janice Hahn said that closing the jail without
seeking public comment is not consistent with the department's move
toward community-based policing.</TE>
<TE>   "Our communities get upset when decisions are made and they find
out after the fact and they don't have a chance to provide input,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   About 3,000 people are booked each year at the West Valley jail.
Its closure will take officers off the street to drive detainees to
the Van Nuys or Devonshire jails, Zine said. With the police force
already far below its peak staffing level, the West Valley cannot
afford the loss of officer time to transport people out of the area,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The West Valley Division is supposed to have 10 patrol cars per
watch but usually has six or seven, Zine said, adding that the number
of sworn officers at the station has declined from 346 in 1997 to 321
now.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of the closure also might help boost the Valley
secession movement, Zine said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need to feed into the attitude that we don't care about
the San Fernando Valley," he said.</TE>

<HD>Judge Stays Culver City's Ban on Signs</HD>
<DH>Civil rights: Removal of one poster but not others is ruled
discriminatory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge prohibited Culver City from removing signs a resident
had posted on city property encouraging residents to vote in the
upcoming municipal election.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Gary A. Feess issued a temporary restraining
order Wednesday, stating that Culver City unconstitutionally enforces
its ordinance banning signs in the public right of way.</LD>
<LD>   City workers and police twice pulled down nonpartisan signs paid
for by Lynne Davidson, 48, instructing residents to "Vote for a
Change" on April 9.</LD>
<TE>   Culver City, like many others, has a sign ordinance prohibiting
posters in the public right of way, regardless of their content.
Davidson's signs urged residents to vote and did not advocate a
candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Davidson said she sued the city because its uneven enforcement of
the code infringed on her free speech rights. More than 20 types of
signs violating the ordinance can be found in Culver City at any
time, including banners for city-sponsored events. Her attorney
argued in court documents that the city singled out Davidson's signs
and left many others untouched.</TE>
<TE>   Feess said the city sometimes hangs banners over the public right
of way advertising city-sponsored events. The judge ruled that the
city cannot post such signs and ban others.</TE>
<TE>   It is a violation of the 1st Amendment "to say the city can pick
and choose content in violation of the ordinance ... particularly
when talking of issues of core speech" such as political signs, he
said. Davidson said low voter turnouts in the Culver City elections
prompted her to spend $3,500 on the signs.</TE>
<TE>   "The people elected are not representative of the whole community
unless people get out and vote," she said.</TE>

<HD>Camelot for Valley City Name? Surely, You Joust</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Camelot? Forget about it.</LD>
<LD>   And Rancho San Fernando, Mission Valley and Valley City? Some
local residents say scratch them off the list of possible names for
the proposed new Valley city, too.</LD>
<LD>   Most say just stick with San Fernando Valley, a name synonymous
with subdivisions and shopping malls.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm used to calling it the San Fernando Valley," said John
Kochian, 49, of Canoga Park, after grabbing a bagel and coffee
Wednesday morning in Northridge. "Why change the name? Who are we
kidding?"</TE>
<TE>   As for Camelot, Kochian could barely contain his laughter.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be great if we were successful in seceding from L.A. and
the Valley becomes Camelot," he said, "but until then, let's hold off
on the name change."</TE>
<TE>   Hermi Spero, 73, of Northridge said Camelot, a fictional place of
political and social perfection immortalized in the medieval tales of
King Arthur and popularized in the Broadway musical of the same name,
could never be associated with the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not Camelot," said the 36-year Valley resident, while
running errands. "We have a lot of problems. We have a ways to go."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Myron Watson, 22, of Van Nuys said he thought Camelot was
cool.</TE>
<TE>   "It would make the Valley a whole different city, a different
environment. It's a cheerful name that gives off that kind of vibe,"
he said, sipping a smoothie.</TE>
<TE>   "The Valley is already kind of like that," he added. "People here
aren't grumpy, they're not uptight. I'm young and I get it."</TE>
<TE>   Camelot got two thumbs down from Lan Phen, 19, of Canoga Park and
Gideon Nayoan, 21, of Reseda.</TE>
<TE>   "Sounds like something out of the medieval times," Nayoan said.
"Do you see any dragons around here?"</TE>
<TE>   Nayoan said he wants to keep the name the way it is, but if the
region were to get a new name, he prefers Valley City. "It gives me a
sense of community. Everyone knows everyone over here anyway."</TE>
<TE>   For Phen, the name Valley City conveys cosmopolitan energy. "It
represents the Valley," she said. "Everyone thinks the Valley is dull
and not a fun place."</TE>
<TE>   Naming the proposed new city San Fernando Valley could make for a
lot of confusion with an existing Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   Germain Carreno, 24, of San Fernando said he is concerned that the
municipalities' monikers might get mixed up. "If they change the name
at all, it should be changed to Rancho San Fernando because there are
a lot of ranches out here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley name game was the butt of jokes at City Hall on
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   During a debate on problems of a new Valley city, Councilman Jack
Weiss quipped, "Are these the sorts of issues you would expect to
arise in Camelot?"</TE>
<TE>   The five proposed names were chosen by secession proponents at a
meeting Tuesday night at a North Hills car dealership. More than 100
Valley residents voted for their favorites from a list of 25 names.
Then, the executive board members of secession group Valley VOTE cast
their ballots.</TE>
<TE>   The five names now go to the state agency studying whether to put
secession up for a citywide vote in November. If the issue is placed
on the ballot, voters would also be asked at that time to choose
their favorite from among the five names.</TE>

<HD>Water Exchanges Help State Through Dry Years</HD>
<DH>Commodity: With erratic supplies, regional agencies make it
a 'marketable resource.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- Spectacular and expensive as it was, the collapse of
the state's electricity market hasn't hindered the buying and selling
of an even more crucial commodity in California: water.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, enough water to supply more than 3 million people for a
year changed hands in deals cut outside the usual operations of
California's major water projects.</LD>
<LD>   The sales amount to a near record, and even more water will be
bought and sold in coming years as the state struggles to accommodate
its vital agriculture industry and its growing population.</LD>
<TE>   Even so, experts say, the water transfers in no way resemble the
electricity market that soared and crashed last year at a cost of
tens of billions of dollars. On the contrary, many believe that a
quietly maturing water exchange makes for a more drought-resistant
California, where naturally erratic supplies get smoothed with
minimal cost and harm.</TE>
<TE>   Some examples: Rice-growing farm districts in the Sacramento
Valley are selling water to their cotton-growing brethren in the San
Joaquin Valley. Southern California cities have teamed up with farm
districts near Bakersfield to capture winter flood flows, percolate
the water underground, then split the supply when dry years come.
Some irrigation districts are selling water directly to the state to
help endangered fish.</TE>
<TE>   Not every deal is free of controversy. Some in Northern
California--where much of the water is sold--have fears of
"colonization" by the southern part of the state. But several of the
more than 2,000 water districts in California are getting more
skilled at shifting water, for profit or policy, without triggering
an outcry.</TE>
<TE>   The Oroville-Wyandotte Irrigation District in the Sierra foothills
of Butte County, for example, earned $750,000 selling water last year
from ditches that date to the Gold Rush.</TE>
<TE>   Without that money, the district--provider of water to rural
residents and gentlemen-farmers--would have had to significantly
raise rates to pay for the consultants and attorneys it must hire to
win federal relicensing of four hydroelectric power plants.</TE>
<TE>   "Fifteen years ago, water did not have a value other than for
consumptive purposes," said district General Manager Mike Glaze. "And
now it is a marketable resource."</TE>
<TE>   Therein lies a tale of two responses to the 1990s rage for
deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   Economists then argued that a free market--a forum in which buyers
and sellers could find one another and settle on prices--would
relieve the chronic California headaches of high electricity rates
and erratic water supplies.</TE>
<TE>   The state's electricity industry and policymakers eventually
embraced the idea. With Sacramento's blessing, the industry cast off
80 years of government control and flung open the door to private
entrepreneurs.</TE>
<TE>   The staid water industry, ever aware that California's
Constitution treats water as a public resource, instead gave an
entrepreneurial twist to government control. Warily, public agencies
began trying to arrange water sales.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the wheelers and dealers of the California water world are
obscure agencies such as the Semitropic Water Storage District and
the Yuba County Water Agency--not Enron Corp. or the Bass Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Not that those big Texas-based companies didn't try. Enron
practically invented trading in natural gas and electricity, and the
company hoped that its subsidiary Azurix would become a player in a
future California water market. Its executives read World Bank and
United Nations reports describing a desperate need for clean,
reliable sources of water around the globe. In 1999, the company
invested $30 million in a Madera County ranch capable of storing
large amounts of water underground. It intended to make Madera Ranch
the cornerstone of its North American operations.</TE>
<TE>   "Due diligence suggested that the way the Central Valley was
growing, it was a good investment," said John "Woody" Wodraska, who
led the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California from 1993
to 1998 before going to work for Azurix. "People in the company went
through that and thought this had a chance for pretty remarkable
payoff if they could market the water."</TE>
<TE>   But Azurix hit stiff opposition from local farmers fearful the
project would drain the county's water for sale to Southern
California. It didn't take long before the speculators abandoned the
state, having failed to earn riches. Enron, once a haughty champion
of free markets, filed for bankruptcy in December. Wodraska left
Azurix last April.</TE>
<TE>   "Like with most things, the pioneers have the arrows in their
backs," Wodraska said.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers Use 80% of State's Water</TE>
<TE>   When water gets transferred in California, it's almost always by
agricultural districts. Farmers use 80% of the developed water in the
state. And water is typically sold from north to south. That's
because, hydrologically speaking, California is out of whack.
Three-quarters of the precipitation in the state falls in the north,
but three-quarters of the demand for water is in the south.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in the 1930s, California and the federal government tried
to correct that imbalance. They dammed northern rivers such as the
Sacramento and Feather, built giant pumps to harness rivers before
they could drain to the Pacific Ocean, then channeled the water
hundreds of miles south in concrete canals.</TE>
<TE>   Two massive water projects, one federal and one state, have fueled
the agricultural development of the San Joaquin Valley and allowed
southern coastal cities to sprawl. But by the 1980s, the projects
were sometimes over-tapped. California kept growing. And federal law
dictated that increasing amounts of water be taken from farms and
cities to protect several species of salmon and other native fish.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure on the water projects increased when drought struck in
1987 and lingered for six years. In 1991, to squeeze more water into
the system, the state Department of Water Resources set up an
emergency "drought water bank." The department paid farmers $68 to
$175 per acre-foot to skip growing a crop for a year and instead sell
the water.</TE>
<TE>   That hastily constructed water market, with the state playing
broker and setting prices, disbanded when the rains returned. But it
helped foster a view of water as a commodity. Water districts that
had for decades simply taken what they needed from a river began to
consider how they might sell the water they otherwise let slip
downstream. Southern districts, wary of seeing their supplies from
government water projects cut back, started shopping for side deals.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a dry year, the Department of Water Resources again
purchased some water for the farms and cities it serves through the
State Water Project. Even more water was purchased by DWR on behalf
of endangered fish through an experimental $57-million program.
Several other water transfers were negotiated one-on-one between
water districts.</TE>
<TE>   One of the largest long-term water transfers being planned would
move water from the Imperial Valley to San Diego. But the deal is
hung up on a major environmental dilemma: how to transfer the water
without accelerating the destruction of the Salton Sea, which is
replenished by drainage from Imperial Valley farm fields.</TE>
<TE>   Urban water districts eager to buy water have begun addressing
such concerns directly.</TE>
<TE>   MWD Signs 35-Year Deal With Palo Verde</TE>
<TE>   Last July, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California--which sells water to agencies serving 17 million people
from Ventura to San Diego--announced a historic agreement with the
Palo Verde Irrigation District.</TE>
<TE>   Under the 35-year deal, Metropolitan would buy enough water from
willing farmers within the Palo Verde district to supply half a
million people a year. The farmers would get the water by fallowing
as much as 29% of their land. Metropolitan would pay an upfront fee
of $3,170 per acre and an annual fee of $550 for every acre not
planted, a deal that could mean millions of dollars each for farmers
struggling with low prices for their fruits and vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   Metropolitan has also promised to give Palo Verde community
leaders $6 million to offset any economic harm from fallowing.</TE>
<TE>   This is an example of how the system is becoming more mature, said
Jerry Johns, chief of the water transfers office of the California
Resources Agency.</TE>
<TE>   "People are understanding what's easily doable and what's not and
trying to make the system work instead of fighting about things," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite rural wariness, the swap of water for dollars will become
more prevalent, many water leaders say.</TE>
<TE>   Water transfers have helped "restore reliability for Southern
California," said Tim Quinn, a Metropolitan vice president. Without
water sales and joint projects with farm districts, he said, the dry
year of 2001 would have triggered a major disruption in the economy.</TE>
<TE>   State policymakers are also banking heavily on voluntary water
sales as a tool to protect salmon and other fish listed under the
Endangered Species Act. And some Northern California water districts
have proposed offering a certain amount of water for sale each year
to avoid challenges to their generous water rights.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, more than 637,000 acre-feet of water was transferred,
the equivalent of 10% of all the water delivered by the state's two
biggest water projects.</TE>
<TE>   That's more water transferred than in any year except 1991, the
first year of the drought water bank, Johns said, and it doesn't
count the unknown amount of water that gets swapped informally within
irrigation districts from farmer to farmer.</TE>
<TE>   But don't dare call it a "market," said Michael George, chief
executive of Western Water Co. in the San Francisco area. His
struggling company tries to broker water sales across the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, a hydrological choke point controlled
by the state Department of Water Resources and the U.S. Bureau of
Reclamation.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's not kid ourselves that we've got a willing-buyer,
willing-seller market in place when we allow the state and federal
government to control the conveyance system and discriminate in terms
of price," said George.</TE>
<TE>   Water Industry Not Quite a 'Market' Yet</TE>
<TE>   Brent Haddad, an associate professor at UC Santa Cruz who studies
water transfers in California, said he agrees that "market" isn't the
right word to describe what's going on in California's water
industry.</TE>
<TE>   A word hasn't been coined yet, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Electricity wires don't interact with society, but canals and
rivers do," Haddad said. "There's so much public interest involved in
water transfers that the way we think about markets, as individuals
trading, is the wrong way to think about it. It's too connected to
the rest of our lives."</TE>
<TE>   "We're not burning policy time trying to create a market," Haddad
said. "We've pushed aside theory, and now we're just seeing what
works."</TE>

<HD>Strike Delays Ease for Students</HD>
<DH>Labor: L.A. schools manage to transport them to class on
the second day of a bus drivers' strike against a district
contractor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE, CARA MIA DiMASSA and ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the second day of a school bus driver strike against Los Angeles
Unified School District's main transportation contractor, many buses
still ran late and students missed early classes Wednesday, but not
as many as the day before.</LD>
<LD>   The district's ability to deliver about 20,000 students to their
campuses could weaken the strikers' position as federal labor
mediation resumes today. The talks will be the first since the strike
began against the Laidlaw Education Services bus firm.</LD>
<LD>   School officials said they managed to get 98% of the bused
students to class by 8:30 a.m., using district buses and other
companies to cover Laidlaw routes. Youngsters' average wait for a bus
was an hour, compared with delays twice and three times as long
Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   The 700 striking drivers, represented by Teamsters Union Local
572, insisted that their bargaining position remains strong in their
effort to win a hike in pay, now usually between $8.50 and $15 an
hour. They want parity with drivers who work directly for the school
district and earn between $15 and $22 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   But some labor observers said the union faces several problems,
including the district's efforts to minimize the strike's effect.</TE>
<TE>   The union local has no strike fund and its drivers will not
receive financial assistance from the national office until they have
been out of work for two weeks. And other L.A. unions have questioned
striking only 18 months after a corruption scandal prompted the
federal government to order a reorganization of the local.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the strike, many drivers said, they lived paycheck to
paycheck and filed for unemployment benefits during longer school
vacations.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Santiago, 24, has been driving for Laidlaw for five years,
picking up shifts for sick employees. He called the strike a "bad
dream" but went along because he believes it will help in the long
run.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, they will see we are serious," he said. "We just want
to be treated a little better."</TE>
<TE>   Without his $13.50-an-hour pay, Santiago said he will dip into his
$1,500 savings to support his girlfriend and two children.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to use that to feed my kids," he said. "It's real hard
to save money."</TE>
<TE>   At a picket line outside Laidlaw's bus yard near Inglewood, union
members grilled meat and tortillas and passed out doughnuts. Two
drivers brought their children, who were on spring break this week,
to help picket.</TE>
<TE>   Many drivers had never been on strike before.</TE>
<TE>   "That's usually pretty tough because this is an unknown area for
them. But for not ever being on strike before, they're holding
together pretty tight," said Rick Middleton, the local's trustee.
"Their spirits are up and they mean to see it through." Middleton was
appointed by the Teamsters' national headquarters after the federal
probe into corruption allegations at the local.</TE>
<TE>   Another striker, Kristina Parker, 31, is a single parent with four
children under age 15. She makes $8.25 an hour. She survives with
help from her family--a situation she said is common among Laidlaw
drivers.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen people older than me living with their parents to pay
the bills," Parker said. "My kids need clothes and shoes."</TE>
<TE>   The two sides have been at an impasse since last month when the
bus drivers voted down Laidlaw's offer.</TE>
<TE>   Across the region, labor leaders sympathized with the Laidlaw
drivers' plight but questioned their strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand why they're on strike," said Tom Newbery, chief of
operations for Service Employees International Union Local 99, which
includes the district's 1,100 in-house school bus drivers. But he
said the strike "kind of hit me by surprise."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the first day of the strike, about 100 Teamster
drivers did their routes as usual because they were unaware of the
labor action.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, SEIU 99 President Janett Humphries said her union
could not join the Teamsters' drivers on picket lines anyway because
they are under a different contract with L.A. Unified.</TE>
<TE>   David Koff, an organizer with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees International Union, said he was outraged by the drivers'
current wages. But he said that walking out without a strike fund to
sustain their members "is not the best way to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Harley Shaiken, a UC Berkeley labor studies professor, said it was
unusual for a union to walk out amid a federally mandated
reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   In September 2000, a federal panel issued a 164-page report
alleging that Local 572 officers misappropriated funds, failed to
hold regular meetings and engaged in cronyism. Those union leaders
were removed and the local's constitution rewritten. Local 572's
federal trusteeship is nearly over, said Don Owens, a spokesman for
the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Owens refused to comment on details of the reorganization because
the trusteeship issue "has nothing to do with our present Laidlaw
action."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Schools Supt. Roy Romer said he hoped for a quick
settlement. "Now, I'm sympathetic with anybody out on a labor action,
but I can't allow that to affect our students," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, students and their families said the inconveniences
continued Wednesday. Field trips and athletic events were canceled
because of the strike.</TE>
<TE>   At Foshay Learning Center in South-Central Los Angeles, some
parents lingered in cars or with their children until buses arrived
to take them elsewhere in the district. Most buses came on time,
about 6:40 a.m., or were about 30 minutes late. But students headed
to Nobel Middle School in Northridge had to wait an hour.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why they go on strike," said Mercedes Tiggs, 14.
"It's worse for us, we've got to stand out in the cold."</TE>
<TE>   Tiggs and most of her schoolmates have no choice but to wait
because their parents work and don't have the 45 minutes to drive
them to school. Some parents rely on public transportation to get to
work.</TE>
<TE>   "My parents have jobs. That's why there are buses!" said Jeanine
Seguro, 13.</TE>

<HD>Portrait Emerges of Alleged Rogue Cop</HD>
<DH>Police: Detectives hope to interview all women who came in
contact with suspected rapist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD and TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He worked alone, authorities say, in the wee hours of the night,
cruising dark and often fetid corners of this rough-and-tumble city
in a squad car that meant nothing but trouble to women walking the
streets.</LD>
<LD>   Between April 2000 and November 2001, officials charge, Ronald
Allen VanRossum, a San Bernardino patrol officer and a 14-year
veteran of the Police Department, sexually assaulted 11 women he
encountered on those streets. He targeted poor women, they
say--sometimes prostitutes, sometimes drug users, sometimes both.</LD>
<LD>   He was arrested last week and has been charged with two dozen
felonies, including eight counts of rape.</LD>
<TE>   Eight detectives have been assigned to investigate every woman
VanRossum came in contact with during his shifts. The painstaking
investigation has yielded about 1,100 pages of evidence so far, as
authorities piece together a more complete picture of VanRossum's
time on the force.</TE>
<TE>   It is a picture, they say, of a renegade officer operating with
little supervision and wielding his badge like a club. "Give me a
reason why I shouldn't book you," he told one woman, according to
court documents, after ordering her into the back of his patrol car,
then driving her toward the desert and allegedly battering and raping
her.</TE>
<TE>   All told, San Bernardino's new police chief said in an interview,
it could mean big changes for the Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime you have an incident like this, you take a look at your
organization," said Police Chief Garrett W. Zimmon, a 29-year veteran
who was a commander of the Los Angeles Police Department before
taking office in San Bernardino in January.</TE>
<TE>   VanRossum's arraignment is scheduled for April 19. His defense
attorney, William J. Hadden, said he will plead not guilty to the
charges. VanRossum is being held on $2-million bail. Hadden said he
also expects to ask for a lowering of the bail at that hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Zimmon said this week that he will consider changes in his
department in response to the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The reforms, he said, will probably include ethics training, the
development of a system that will document an officer's activities
during a shift and renewed emphasis on community policing. The latter
approach, considered essential to modern police work, encourages
officers to know their beat well and target the causes of crime as
well as crime itself.</TE>
<TE>   Zimmon also said he will consider staffing the post of watch
commander--the officer who supervises the day-to-day operations of a
patrol shift--with lieutenants instead of sergeants. That, Zimmon
said, would help increase accountability and ensure that patrol
officers are better supervised.</TE>
<TE>   Such changes can have a profound impact on officers, said
Riverside Assistant Police Chief Mike Smith. His department, 14 miles
south of San Bernardino, embarked on a similar reform campaign after
confronting a scandal of its own--the 1998 shooting of a black woman,
Tyisha Miller, by four white police officers.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, as part of that effort, the department began staffing
the watch commander's post--and daily roll calls for officers--with
lieutenants instead of sergeants.</TE>
<TE>   The results were immediate, Smith said. He said lieutenants can
handle a citizen's complaint of excessive force immediately, for
example, instead of waiting until an administrator arrives in the
morning. And it has helped on a less tangible level, increasing the
awareness among officers that their bosses are watching them closely.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the key reasons we got in trouble here as an organization
was the lack of management of the organization 24 hours a day," Smith
said. "The organization feels the presence of that leadership. That's
very, very important for us."</TE>
<TE>   The changes are necessary not only to improve accountability, but
to shore up the San Bernardino Police Department's relationship with
the community, Zimmon said.</TE>
<TE>   "You had a police officer arrested for a crime that was committed
on duty," he said. "It is not only embarrassing for the Police
Department, but it does raise a level of concern for the community. I
think it's important for the public to know that we are turning over
every stone."</TE>
<TE>   Two alleged victims in the VanRossum case have filed legal claims.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, a 44-year-old woman who was once convicted of
prostitution charged that she was picked up by a San Bernardino
police officer Nov. 1 and forced to perform sexual acts on him.
Documents filed with the city in connection with her case say the
officer had been assaulting "hookers and prostitutes."</TE>
<TE>   The case, said the woman's attorney, Steven Coleman, was settled
out of court about a month ago. The alleged victim had demanded $1
million; Coleman would not say how much was involved in the
settlement. City officials would not confirm that the case was
settled.</TE>
<TE>   A second case, filed in U.S. District Court, alleges that a San
Bernardino police officer found a young woman walking the streets of
San Bernardino in March 2001, then ordered her into the back of his
patrol car. After driving her through the county, court documents
charge, the officer battered and raped the woman, then drove her to a
police station and booked her for an outstanding warrant.</TE>
<TE>   That case, in which unspecified damage payments are requested, is
still in court.</TE>
<TE>   Neither legal claim mentions VanRossum by name. But city
officials, police officials and attorneys representing the women say
they believe the officer is VanRossum.</TE>
<TE>   City and county officials say they are bracing for more claims.
Although there is a six-year statute of limitations for most rape
cases, it does not apply if a rape is conducted in the course of a
kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   If there is also a kidnapping, said Susan Mickey, a spokeswoman
for the San Bernardino County district attorney's office, there is no
statute of limitations. The alleged victims in the VanRossum case are
also considered kidnapping victims, according to court documents,
because they were held against their will.</TE>
<TE>   "As a patrolman, he's had contact with any number of people," said
San Bernardino County Assistant Dist. Atty. James Hackleman. "And
[the Police Department] wants to go out and talk to every person he's
ever talked to."</TE>
<TE>   If more victims file lawsuits and their allegations are proved,
the city's costs could add up quickly, said Robert Mann, a Los
Angeles attorney who has sued officers in the past for negligent
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a campaign to reform the Police Department, San Bernardino
officials and attorneys in the case have been reluctant to discuss
the VanRossum matter.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, the attorney representing one of the alleged victims,
refused to discuss her case in detail.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was told not to by the district attorney's
office--effectively part of the law enforcement community he opposes
in the case.</TE>
<TE>   VanRossum's attorney, Hadden, was given copies of the 1,100 pages
of evidence the police task force has produced.</TE>
<TE>   But he said Wednesday that the district attorney's office had
blocked out the victims' names and addresses and other important
information.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know who these people are," Hadden said. "We don't know
what their histories are."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, photographers from several media companies, including
The Times, received permission from San Bernardino County Superior
Court Judge Robert Fawke to photograph VanRossum during a brief court
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   But when VanRossum's defense attorney objected, the judge
rescinded his permission, then said that because the case is under
investigation, the photographs could not be printed.</TE>

<HD>Agents Tracking Fake Social Security Cards</HD>
<DH>Probe: Terrorist attacks prompt scrutiny of those who
bought numbers from Southland ring.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICH CONNELL and GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal investigators hunting for potential terrorists have been
poring over hundreds of fraudulent Social Security numbers generated
by a Southern California ring that catered mostly to Middle Eastern
immigrants.</LD>
<LD>   Three people have pleaded guilty in the scheme, broken up before
the Sept. 11 attacks, including a Jordanian national who worked in
security at Los Angeles International Airport and a U.S. government
employee who tapped a secure federal computer to procure the
government-issued cards, court records and interviews show.</LD>
<LD>   Over a 14-month period beginning in early 1999, about 1,000 Social
Security numbers were sold to illegal immigrants and foreign
nationals, authorities say.</LD>
<TE>   Although it was one of the most extensive Social Security scams
involving Middle Eastern immigrants uncovered in recent years, the
case drew little public notice. However, within federal law
enforcement circles, interest intensified immediately after the
September attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "The reaction was, 'Let's find out who these people are--what ...
they are doing and where they are,'" said one law enforcement
official.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and other agencies declined to comment on the ongoing
investigation. But law enforcement sources who requested anonymity
said the wide-ranging inquiry has been expanded from an
organized-crime unit to include agents chasing leads in the federal
government's anti-terrorism investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "We are well into tracking all these guys down," one official
said.</TE>
<TE>   The sources declined to say how many cardholders have been
arrested or deported. But at least two of the names used on the cards
match those of individuals indicted in Los Angeles weeks after the
September attacks on charges of Social Security and immigration
fraud, records show.</TE>
<TE>   No links to the Sept. 11 skyjackers or to suspected terrorist
groups have been found so far, officials said. But they note that a
number of individuals still must be located and some have scattered
to other states and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of numbers to track down and [some] people have
left the country," said one official.</TE>
<TE>   Among the intriguing leads in the case files are several names on
the fraudulent cards that, while common in the Middle East, are
similar to aliases used by some of the Sept. 11 skyjackers.
Confidential investigative records obtained by The Times after the
East Coast attacks, for example, indicate that the skyjackers'
suspected ringleader, Mohamed Atta, used numerous variations of his
name, including Mohamed Mohamed El Amir Awad.</TE>
<TE>   Amir Awad was the name on one card sent to a mail drop used by the
ring, records show.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A.-based fraud investigation--and the broader war on
terrorism--underscore gaping holes in government efforts to stop
bogus Social Security cards from being issued and legitimate numbers
from being misused. Most of the skyjackers had multiple identities,
and although it is not clear where or how they did it, six of the
skyjackers are suspected of fraudulently obtaining Social Security
numbers, according to recent congressional testimony.</TE>
<TE>   "It has become quickly apparent just how instrumental the use of a
fraudulent [card] has been for these individuals," James G. Huse,
inspector general of the Social Security Administration, recently
told a congressional panel. "[They] rely on aliases and assumed
identities in order to integrate themselves anonymously into our
society."</TE>
<TE>   Social Security fraud also was cited repeatedly as a reason for
holding many of the hundreds of detainees rounded up in the weeks
after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Theft and misuse of Social Security numbers are soaring so rapidly
that it is impossible to fully gauge the scope of the problem,
authorities say. One barometer, a Social Security Administration
fraud hotline, has seen a fivefold jump in reports of misuse from
1998 to 2001, when it reached 65,000 calls.</TE>
<TE>   One recent report to Congress warned that systems designed to stop
fraud are incapable of spotting misuse that may be connected to
terrorist activity.</TE>
<TE>   Scheme Offered Cards With 'Clean' Numbers</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles investigation was one of more than 50 nationwide
in the last five years involving workers inside the Social Security
agency.</TE>
<TE>   The conspiracy took in nearly $800,000, prosecutors estimated, by
offering one of the most valued types of fake cards--those with
"clean" numbers generated by the government's own computers. Unless
such numbers are identified and flagged by authorities, there is
little chance they will be detected by credit agencies, border agents
or anyone else. They are often used to secure jobs by immigrants who
are prohibited from working while in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers were churned out at a rate of about 15 a week and sold
for roughly $800 each, records show.</TE>
<TE>   Two Jordanian immigrants, Ali Nashawati and Firas Rteimeh,
admitted in federal court plea agreements that they lined up
customers for the cards. A third defendant, Rosa Ioane, worked in the
Social Security Administration office in Downey for nearly 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Nashawati entered the country illegally in 1997, lived in Ohio for
a time and later settled in Buena Park, records and interviews show.
He met Ioane in early 1999 and the two began generating the illegal
Social Security cards a few months later, according to Los Angeles
federal court records. Ioane told investigators she married Nashawati
in Las Vegas to help him gain legal residency, and he gave her cash,
diamond rings and help in purchasing a home.</TE>
<TE>   Rteimeh was a legal Jordanian immigrant who told federal agents he
worked for an LAX security contractor from 1996 to early 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Rteimeh said he met Nashawati at a downtown Los Angeles nightclub
and in January 2000 began providing him with names of people who
wanted to buy fake Social Security cards.</TE>
<TE>   Ioane put information from Nashawati and Rteimeh into a federal
government computer that ordered cards from a processing center in
Baltimore. The cards were mailed to addresses across Los Angeles and
Orange counties, including several apartments and post office boxes
tied to Nashawati and Rteimeh, records show.</TE>
<TE>   Suspicions arose in 1999 when a Social Security Administration
review found multiple cards being mailed to the same addresses.</TE>
<TE>   Agents also received a tip that an unidentified LAX employee with
a contact inside the Downey Social Security office was selling cards.
Investigators traced one of those cards to Ioane.</TE>
<TE>   "The LAX connection is of great interest," a law enforcement
official said recently.</TE>
<TE>   As arrests were being made in June 2000, agents searched Rteimeh's
Playa del Rey apartment and seized Social Security applications, a
U.S. immigration stamp, red ink and more than $100,000 in cash,
records show. Prosecutors were suspicious about the source of the
money.</TE>
<TE>   Rteimeh's attorney, Ronald Richards, said the funds came from
Rteimeh's family members in the Middle East and were not proceeds
from the Social Security card sales.</TE>
<TE>   All three defendants pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges and in
early 2001 were sentenced to 18 to 20 months in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Nashawati and Rteimeh were held without bail beginning in mid-2000
and completed their sentences in December and January. Nashawati
could not be reached for comment and his lawyer did not respond to
interview requests. Records and interviews indicate he may have been
deported.</TE>
<TE>   Conspirator: Little Known About Buyers</TE>
<TE>   In a brief telephone interview, Rteimeh, who is now living in the
Los Angeles area, insisted he knew little about the people who
purchased the Social Security cards. "They were just normal
individuals" who wanted the cards, "mainly for work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he had no idea whether workers at LAX obtained any of
the fraudulent cards.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have not sought his help in the search for the
cardholders, Rteimeh said.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish [them] the best," he said. "The thing is over for me.... I
paid my time." He declined to answer additional questions.</TE>
<TE>   Rteimeh remains here while an appeal of his sentence, which could
affect future deportation hearings, is pending, attorney Richards
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ioane did not begin serving time until last September and remains
in a Victorville prison. She declined to be interviewed, and her
attorneys refused to say whether agents have sought her aid in the
ongoing investigation. One lawyer, Joseph Walsh, said his client
"wasn't in a position to know [the] people" who bought the cards.</TE>
<TE>   Court files shed little additional light on the card buyers, and
efforts by The Times to interview purchasers have been unsuccessful.
One was charged in November with buying a false Social Security card
and using it to apply for a California driver's license, court
records show.</TE>
<TE>   While officials concede that many cards appear to have been
purchased by immigrants seeking to earn a living, they also note that
multiple Social Security numbers were issued to several individuals.
That could indicate the cards were being passed on to third parties
trying to remain anonymous, or that the cards might be used for
various types of credit fraud, law enforcement sources said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a search of public records indicates at least some of
the fraudulent cards may have been used in other states, including
Florida, New Jersey and Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   The government's worry is that even a few cards could have fallen
into the hands of people who aided the September skyjackers or are
plotting future attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously," one law enforcement official said, "[we need] to make
sure no terrorists are running around with ... identities that are
not theirs."</TE>

<HD>Stepmother, 94, Accuses Liza Minnelli of Neglect</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN W. O'NEILL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Entertainer Liza Minnelli has been accused in a Los Angeles Superior
Court lawsuit of neglecting her 94-year-old stepmother and selling
her longtime Beverly Hills home "out from under her."</LD>
<LD>   As the entertainer was sitting down March 16 to a lavish New York
wedding supper with groom David Gest and "850 of their closest
friends," her stepmother faced losing her home of many years,
according to lawyer Tamara L. Green.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed on behalf of Lee Anderson Minnelli, widow of the
late director Vincente Minnelli, contends that Liza, as executor and
trustee of his estate, is obligated to maintain the six-bedroom house
for her stepmother. Yet Liza has refused to pay the utilities or
household staff since trying to sell the house six months ago, court
papers say.</LD>
<TE>   Estate documents attached to the suit indicate that Vincente
Minnelli's 1982 will gave Lee Minnelli lifetime use of the house,
which has been on and off the market since the summer of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Liza Minnelli, 56, and her new husband, 48, are honeymooning in
Europe and could not be reached for comment. But spokesman Warren
Cowan said in a statement, "Liza Minnelli has sold her home in
Beverly Hills, where Lee Minnelli has lived for many years, during
which time Liza has paid for all of Lee's expenses." According to the
statement, "Liza has offered to buy Lee a condo ... but her generous
offer has been refused. It is now in the hands of attorneys."</TE>
<TE>   Liza Minnelli's attorney Joseph D'Onofrio could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Green disputed the assertion that Liza, daughter of Judy Garland
and Vincente Minnelli, offered to buy her stepmother a condominium.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Minnelli was married to Vincente Minnelli from 1980 until his
death in 1986. County records list her as owner of the property since
1987. Now she has "been reduced to an anxious and fearful beggar,"
the suit charges. She is afraid to turn on the lights; as a result,
she falls often. Because the pool man has been fired, the suit says,
''the pool is now a green swamp and a breeding ground for insects.''</TE>
<TE>   The utilities were shut off last week for nonpayment, and the
household staff is working for free. Although Liza's Rolls-Royce is
parked in the driveway, court papers say, the housekeeper, who
doesn't drive, was forced to take a bus to pay the utility bill and
restore electrical service. The house also is cold because a broken
furnace has not been repaired.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Minnelli, who weighs 88 pounds and is just under 5 feet tall,
is hard of hearing. She is disoriented and upset from being
"subjected to the whims and fancies'' of her stepdaughter's
"instructions to her agents and employees to get the old woman out of
her house,'' according to court papers. A move, the legal documents
add, ''will no doubt be the death of her.''</TE>
<TE>   "Liza is the only family she has in the world," Green said. "She
has pictures of her everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   The suit accuses Liza Minnelli of breach of contract, elder abuse
and infliction of emotional distress, and asks the court to set up a
$1-million trust from the proceeds of the house sale to "secure and
maintain suitable housing" for Lee Minnelli.</TE>
<TE>   Correspondence accompanying the suit reveals the hard feelings
surrounding the dispute. Green says that although her client attended
Liza's recent engagement party in Los Angeles, her invitation to the
wedding in New York was withdrawn.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter dated March 4, D'Onofrio wrote: "Given the present
circumstances, Liza Minnelli has instructed me to tell your client
through you that she is no longer invited to David and Liza's
wedding. In our recent conversation, you indicated that you had been
invited to attend one or more of the festivities celebrating the
wedding. If that is true, you also are no longer invited."</TE>
<TE>   Responded Green, "I went to Liza's wedding to Jack Haley. I wrote
them back and said, 'You know, I've already been to one of her
weddings, and I'll catch the next one.'"</TE>
<TE>   The Minnelli-Gest wedding--attended by Michael Jackson, Elizabeth
Taylor, Diana Ross, Dionne Warwick, Rosie O'Donnell, Donald Trump,
Joan Collins, Martha Stewart and Mia Farrow, among others--featured a
36-member bridal party and 12-tier wedding cake.</TE>
<TE>   Ten days later, Green said, her client was sitting in a cold, dark
house as the utilities were cut off.</TE>
<TE>   "The utilities for a year don't cost as much as the top tier of
that cake," Green said. "I hope that Liza is incredibly happy. But to
kick this old woman to the curb for mere money when it's not
necessary--that is unacceptable. Liza gets everything. But she has to
wait."</TE>

<HD>Primary Race Comes Back to Haunt Simon</HD>
<DH>Politics: Gov. Davis exploits Republican challenger's
remarks and endorsements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. announced his "A"
rating from the National Rifle Assn. with the equivalent of a
whisper: a written statement issued just before 9 p.m. on a Friday.</LD>
<LD>   He was just as quiet about his endorsement by the California
ProLife Council, a group that seeks to outlaw abortion. He announced
it just before 7 p.m. the next day.</LD>
<LD>   By releasing both bits of news after dark on a January weekend,
the Simon campaign minimized coverage. His stands on guns and
abortion would be promoted privately--by mail to conservative
Republicans.</LD>
<TE>   But in the month since Simon captured the GOP nomination, Gov.
Gray Davis has sought to turn his rival's primary campaign against
him. Day after day, the Democratic incumbent trumpets Simon's
conservative positions on guns, abortion and other issues that the
Republican candidate now struggles to avoid.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's overtures to conservatives in the primary--no matter how
discreet--have become the centerpiece of the Davis reelection
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "If you allow yourself to get boxed into an ideological corner in
your party primary, whether you're a Democrat or a Republican,
there's going to be hell to pay in the general election," said Garry
South, the governor's top political strategist.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis team is using Simon's statements during the primary to
attack him not just on guns and abortion, but also on the
environment, gay rights, education and energy.</TE>
<TE>   "There is sort of an embarrassment of riches here," said Davis
pollster Paul Maslin.</TE>
<TE>   The governor faced no serious opposition in the Democratic
primary. But as the survivor of a hard-fought GOP primary against
Secretary of State Bill Jones and former Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan, Simon has left a trail of statements for Davis to exploit.
During the primary, Riordan, a moderate, called Simon an unelectable
extremist. Davis, who helped knock Riordan out of the primary by
spending heavily on advertising against him, has picked up the same
theme in his quest to beat Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts Criticize Simon for Avoiding Questions</TE>
<TE>   So far, Simon's strategy has been to hew strictly to his own
agenda. He talks relentlessly about his plans to solve the state's
fiscal troubles, stimulate the economy, improve public schools and
rebuild the water, power and road systems. He dodges all questions
about guns and abortion, refusing to say anything about either topic.</TE>
<TE>   "Each candidate can choose which issues he or she would like to
focus on," Simon said Monday at a campaign stop in Rosemead.</TE>
<TE>   But political analysts are skeptical about Simon's ability to
avoid topics raised by Davis--all of them longtime staples of
California campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be viewed as if he's hiding behind opinions that he does
not want known," said political scientist Larry N. Gerston of San
Jose State. "It will backfire on him terribly."</TE>
<TE>   Simon strategist Sal Russo said the GOP candidate was sticking to
subjects that voters consider important while Davis was raising
extraneous issues to divert attention from his mishandling of
California's energy and budget problems. Simon echoed that view in
his speech to Asian American Republicans on Monday in Rosemead.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a reason why so many Californians now would not vote to
reelect Gray Davis, and it's not because of my stands on a particular
issue," Simon said. "It's about his failed leadership in the areas
that affect Californians each and every day."</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, Simon's focus during the primary was the same
as it is now. But to position himself as the favorite of
conservatives--the bulk of GOP primary voters--Simon also touched on
the issues now favored by Davis, namely abortion and guns. Those
appeals were particularly effective in Simon's effort to gain an edge
over Riordan, whose support of gun control and abortion rights irked
conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's campaign Web site features not just the NRA and ProLife
Council announcements, but also a Feb. 19 statement touting Simon's
endorsement by Gun Owners of California.</TE>
<TE>   "It is time for the politicians to stop harassing law-abiding gun
owners and instead do more to go after the criminals," Simon says in
the statement.</TE>
<TE>   In the California ProLife statement, the group's executive
director, Brian Johnston, says Simon "believes in restoring legal
protection for innocent life" and "wants the government out of the
abortion industry."</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 26, Simon said in a campaign news release that he was
"humbled by this vote of confidence" by the ProLife Council.</TE>
<TE>   "With the help of [the council] and all Californians, it is my
hope that we can begin to work toward a new culture of life in our
state," Simon said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Polls Reflect Disparity Among Voting Groups</TE>
<TE>   On abortion and guns, polls illustrate the stark contrast between
the GOP voters Simon was courting in the primary and the broader
electorate he faces now.</TE>
<TE>   A Times poll in February found that 51% of California Republicans
favored abortion rights, but among all registered voters, 63% held
that view. The survey found that 29% of Republicans supported
stricter gun control, but 51% of all registered voters took that
position.</TE>
<TE>   The margins are even bigger between the conservative Republicans
who dominated last month's primary electorate and the general
election audience that awaits Simon in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   "He's taken some stands that in a general population are not very
popular," said Eric Smith, a UC Santa Barbara political science
professor.</TE>
<TE>   Among the GOP primary candidates, only Riordan favored abortion
rights and gun control. With that in mind, Davis spent millions of
dollars on television ads against Riordan, helping to persuade GOP
voters to nominate the more conservative Simon, who could be attacked
on abortion and guns.</TE>
<TE>   At an East Los Angeles school Monday, Davis did exactly that.</TE>
<TE>   "I remain strongly pro-choice, strongly for sensible gun control,"
he said. "My opponent is endorsed by people who are opposed to a
woman's right to choose ... and does not support reasonable gun
control, so there's a pretty sharp contrast."</TE>
<TE>   Ideology Is a Risky Strategy for Primaries</TE>
<TE>   Simon's predicament is a common one for candidates who win
primaries that split along ideological lines. George W. Bush tried to
score points with conservatives during the 2000 GOP presidential
primary by visiting fundamentalist Bob Jones University in South
Carolina. But by failing to disavow its anti-Catholic sentiments,
Bush drew widespread criticism and tainted the moderate image he had
been trying to project.</TE>
<TE>   In Simon's case, he marketed himself during the primary as a
conservative Republican in his ads. The governor's advisors are
hinting that video excerpts of those spots could soon wind up in a
Davis campaign ad.</TE>
<TE>   "When was the last time you saw a Democrat on the air saying, 'I'm
a liberal Democrat'?" South said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the March 5 primary, Davis aides have broadened their
attacks beyond abortion and guns.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, South accused Simon of rhetorical gay-bashing during
the primary. He cited Simon's criticism of Davis in October for
signing legislation that granted inheritance, sick leave and other
rights to gay couples. South recalled that Simon said California
"should not be in the business of trying to classify people or confer
rights based on lifestyle."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Davis spokesman Gabriel N. Sanchez called Simon a
"self-dubbed oil and gas man from way back," borrowing a phrase Simon
used to describe himself in May. Simon, an oil industry investor, has
insisted that he misspoke, but the Davis campaign is using the
statement nonetheless to cast him as a threat to the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Davis forces also are attacking Simon for saying during the
primary that he favored a free-market approach to the power crisis.</TE>
<TE>   It was a traditional appeal to GOP conservatives, but Davis says
it would invite price gouging by power suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   On schools, Davis advisors call attention to Simon's support
during the primary for the takeover of failing public schools by
for-profit corporations, a position now notably absent from Simon's
public remarks on education.</TE>
<TE>   "He went through the primary trying to convince everybody he was a
camel, and now that the primary is over with, he's trying to tell
everybody he's a giraffe," South said.</TE>
<TE>   Russo, Simon's chief strategist, used his own animal metaphor to
explain why the GOP candidate has emphasized some issues and
downplayed others as he shifted from the primary to the general
election race.</TE>
<TE>   "The audience is different," he said. "It doesn't do any good to
talk about reptiles to people who want to hear about mammals."</TE>

<HD>Afghan Sweep May Include Hundreds</HD>
<DH>Asia: Government arrests political opponents, accusing them of
plotting to assassinate ministers and destabilize regime.</DH>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Afghanistan's interim government has arrested hundreds of political
opponents associated with a former moujahedeen warlord, Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar, accusing them of planning to assassinate government ministers
in a bombing campaign, officials said today.</LD>
<LD>   Lt. Col. Neal Peckman, a spokesman for the International Security
Assistance Force, said 300 people had been arrested in recent days,
including 12 late Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   But senior officials with Prime Minister Hamid Karzai's interim
administration put the figure lower, saying that 30 to 40 people had been
rounded up.</LD>
<TE>   They confirmed that Wahidullah Sabaun, a former Hekmatyar associate,
was under house arrest. He was a minister with the Northern Alliance but
was excluded from the current interim administration.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Abdul Basir, police chief of Kabul, the capital, said that after
Sabaun was denied a post in the interim government he became resentful
and started organizing activities against the Karzai administration.</TE>
<TE>   "About 30 to 40 people who were allied with Sabaun were arrested in
the last three days," he said today.</TE>
<TE>   Basir said it was "probable" that the group was planning to
assassinate the defense minister, Mohammed Qassim Fahim, and the interior
minister, Younis Qanooni, two powerful figures from the Northern
Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   The plan was to destabilize the regime before a grand council, or loya
jirga, is convened in June to choose a new transitional government.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Abdul Khaliq, deputy chief of the Intelligence Department in
Kabul, also said that 30 to 40 arrests had taken place.</TE>
<TE>   Sabaun is under house arrest, but others have been jailed.</TE>
<TE>   Although authorities asserted that a bombing plot had been uncovered,
details were vague and the arrests had a political flavor, with all those
detained being opponents of Karzai's administration.</TE>
<TE>   Basir said that Sabaun had renewed his contact with Hekmatyar, who is
believed to be in Iran.</TE>
<TE>   There is bitter blood between Hekmatyar and the Northern Alliance
figures who dominate the key security posts in Karzai's Cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   Before he fled to Iran, Hekmatyar fought in a vicious civil war in the
early 1990s against the forces of Ahmed Shah Masoud, who went on to lead
the Northern Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   Basir said intelligence services had found documents proving that
Sabaun was trying to recruit people into Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami party.</TE>
<TE>   "Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was organizing sedition," Basir said. "Sabaun has
been under suspicion for some time."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the arrested figures were organizing any illegal activities,
he replied, "Show me which of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's activities is legal.</TE>
<TE>   "They were recruiting people into Hekmatyar's party to organize people
against the interim government."</TE>
<TE>   Basir said there was no detailed evidence of a bombing plot but said,
"I believe it was probable."</TE>

<HD>Despite Peace, Ethnic Hatred Still Splits Macedonia</HD>
<DH>Balkans: Western diplomacy ended war, but the division within the
country is more entrenched than ever.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TETOVO, Macedonia
</DL>
<LD>At first glance, this small Balkan city seems completely recovered
from last summer's combat that emptied its broad boulevards and brought
police checkpoints to placid neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   Just a little more than a year after the first shots were fired here,
shoppers throng the streets, the fruit stands brim with produce and the
cafes are full again.</LD>
<LD>   But a pall remains beneath the busyness, reinforcing for the West the
lesson that seems to have recurred with each recent Balkan war: Diplomacy
and intervention can stop the fighting but cannot heal the ethnic hatreds
that fissure this region.</LD>
<TE>   These divisions are even more entrenched now than they were a year
ago. A recent visit to this northwestern city where ethnic Macedonians
and Albanians lived side by side before the conflict suggests the depth
of the schism afflicting the country.</TE>
<TE>   Albanian flags, symbols of the ethnic Albanian guerrillas, still hang
from houses in the city's Albanian-dominated areas, a reminder of the
residents' sense of a separate identity. Ethnic Macedonian high school
students who used to sit in classes next to Albanians now take their
lessons a mile away at a primary school.</TE>
<TE>   "How can we live anymore with Albanians here? We hate each other,"
said Irina Nestoroska, 18, an ethnic Macedonian. "They did everything to
us; we didn't want this."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, ethnic Albanians blame the Macedonians, especially
citing abuse by the police. "We have no trust in the Macedonians, and we
won't trust them for a very long time," said Veli Pajaziti, 40, president
of an Albanian neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Macedonia, the southernmost republic of the former Yugoslav
federation, has about 2 million people. At least 25% are ethnic
Albanians, concentrated here in the northwestern part of the country.
Unlike other Balkan nations that broke away from Yugoslavia in the 1990s,
Macedonia split peacefully and, until last year, had avoided almost
altogether the ethnic violence that racked the region.</TE>
<TE>   After a vicious and bloody war, nearby Bosnia-Herzegovina split into
an area controlled jointly by ethnic Croats and Muslims and another
controlled by Bosnian Serbs. Even in towns where Croats and Muslims
nominally live together, they tend to divide into different
neighborhoods. In Kosovo, a province of the Yugoslav republic of Serbia,
ethnic animosities led in 1999 to warfare, U.N. control and the virtual
segregation of Serbs and ethnic Albanians.</TE>
<TE>   Observers see the same pattern here.</TE>
<TE>   "Macedonia will be split into cantons--it's really happened already,
just like Kosovo and Bosnia," said Slavko Mangovski, an ethnic Macedonian
and editor of the weekly magazine Macedonian Sun. "People are resigned to
it."</TE>
<TE>   Kim Mehmeti, an influential ethnic Albanian writer, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "The process of division has already started in Macedonia," he said.
"This year, Macedonia writes a double history, and the people to blame
are the political elite."</TE>
<TE>   Mehmeti and others say that undercutting any rapprochement is a
growing distrust of government. That is fueled by a steady stream of
information suggesting that political parties--both ethnic Macedonian and
ethnic Albanian--are corrupt and interested only in their own gain.</TE>
<TE>Government 'Like a Protection Racket'</TE>
<TE>   "We're not talking about ordinary corruption--that the money that is
supposed to be used to build houses is going to finance a villa. We're
talking about a government that functions like a racket," said Edward P.
Joseph, director of the International Crisis Group's Macedonia office.
"Every opportunity is used to shake down citizens for whatever they
need--a license, a permit. It's like a protection racket."</TE>
<TE>   ICG, a Brussels-based nonprofit organization, lobbied hard but with
few results to get Western countries to put strings on nearly $270
million dollars recently pledged to help Macedonia recover from the
damage of last year's fighting. An additional $237 million was pledged in
general economic aid.</TE>
<TE>   Most worrisome for the West: The Balkans is a major transit point for
smuggling guns and illegal immigrants, many of whom come from the Arab
world. Although the vast majority of refugees are almost certainly
escaping bad economic conditions, it is impossible to determine whether
their ranks also include some who have terrorist connections.</TE>
<TE>   It is not a small matter to stop fighting in the Balkans, and Western
diplomats are proud that seven months of skirmishes, which ended in
September, did not explode into a cycle of war in Macedonia. There
remains the larger question, however, of whether such efforts can do more
than delay the fracturing of the region into ever tinier countries, each
with a single ethnic identity. Most policymakers agree that such an
outcome is neither economically viable nor diplomatically desirable.</TE>
<TE>   "I remain optimistic; step by step this is going in the right
direction. But there's still fragility and still lots of weapons," said
Alain Le Roy, the European Union's special envoy to Macedonia, who is
monitoring the peace process. "We need more discussions between the
Macedonian and Albanian parties."</TE>
<TE>   But can such discussions--which Western diplomats can mandate by
threatening to reduce aid--have much effect at the grass-roots level,
where citizens from the two ethnic groups already appear to have reached
firm opinions about each other?</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon in Tetovo, the future looked grim at classes
attended exclusively by ethnic Macedonians, who are in the minority here.</TE>
<TE>   Before last year's fighting, ethnic Albanian and Macedonian children
played on sports teams together, walked home together or took school
buses that headed up into the mountain villages. The two groups rarely
lived in the same communities, but the mountain hamlets often are divided
by only a field. The Albanian children would get off the bus at one
village, and five minutes later the ethnic Macedonians would get off at
the next one.</TE>
<TE>Ethnic Macedonians Shun a High School</TE>
<TE>   Now not a single ethnic Macedonian student is left at Kiril
Pejcinovic, the main high school. Instead, they meet at a primary school
from 2 to 7 p.m. after the younger children have gone home.</TE>
<TE>   "Definitely we will not go back to the other school; our lives are not
safe there. We are afraid of the Albanians," said Sonia Stevcevska, 17, a
Tetovo native.</TE>
<TE>   Although she has never been assaulted by ethnic Albanian peers,
Stevcevska, like several friends with her, said she felt rejected and out
of place. Any good jobs in Tetovo go to Albanians, she said. She has not
spoken with Albanian friends she had as a child for several years and
can't imagine what she would say to them now.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to live here," she said. "There are no possibilities for
success for me here. I will leave as soon as I can."</TE>
<TE>   One of the more chilling aspects of last year's struggle was the
kidnapping of ethnic Macedonians by guerrillas from the National
Liberation Army. The number of people killed in the fighting was less
than 100 and about 400 houses were severely damaged, according to
international aid groups, but the kidnappings by the ethnic Albanian
group cast a long shadow.</TE>
<TE>   In some villages, young men were snatched and held for months. On
several occasions, school buses were stopped and boarded by guerrillas.
Although only a few youths were held for any period of time and the buses
were detained for only an hour, the effect on the children was severe,
said Natasa Janevska, the 33-year-old principal of the primary school.</TE>
<TE>   An added trauma was the nightly gunfire, which resulted in few deaths
but made parents afraid to allow their children outside.</TE>
<TE>   "I think of them all as my children, and I see a bad effect for all of
them," said Janevska, an ethnic Macedonian. "The children were more full
of life before; now they are quieter. If a door slams, they are startled,
and they wet their beds if they are going to be away from home for the
night on a school trip."</TE>
<TE>   The number of students at the primary school has shrunk from 900
before the fighting to 738 now, as some ethnic Macedonian families have
left Tetovo for cities in the center of the country, Janevska said.</TE>
<TE>   Such difficulties hardly surprise longtime Balkan watchers. The
Macedonian peace accord was brokered by the West, which all but
physically dragged political leaders to the bargaining table at a
lakeside resort.</TE>
<TE>   "The agreement was not worked out by Macedonians and Albanians; the
agreement was drafted and brought to Lake Ohrid, and both sides were made
to sign it," saidAlex Grigorev, a program officer at the Project on
Ethnic Relations in Princeton, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, you could have said that they would have made it, and there's
still a slim chance that they will," he added. "But it's a very, very sad
place now."</TE>

<HD>Congo Withdrawal Unresolved</HD>
<DH>Africa: Regional summit ends without a timetable for the departure
of foreign forces from the war-torn country.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LUSAKA, Zambia
</DL>
<LD>A summit of African leaders trying to get peace talks restarted in
Congo ended late Wednesday without a timetable for the withdrawal of
foreign troops from the warn-torn nation.</LD>
<LD>   Six African states have forces in the conflict, but Rwanda and
Zimbabwe--which have the largest deployments--have so far failed to agree
on a time frame for their departure.</LD>
<LD>   In a communique issued at the end of the meeting in Zambia, the
leaders recognized that foreign troops should be withdrawn more quickly
but called on the United Nations to deploy peacekeepers simultaneously to
prevent a security vacuum.</LD>
<TE>   "The summit noted that encouraging progress achieved earlier in the
withdrawal of foreign forces had slowed down," the communique said.</TE>
<TE>   "While acknowledging the need to accelerate this process in a
time-bound program . . . the summit also called on the U.N. to deploy
peacekeepers with an appropriate mandate in order to prevent the creation
of a security gap as foreign forces withdraw."</TE>
<TE>   Diplomats said earlier Wednesday that the summit in Lusaka, Zambia's
capital, put pressure on Rwanda and Zimbabwe to withdraw.</TE>
<TE>   The diplomats said a firm commitment was needed from Rwandan President
Paul Kagame and Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, to implement a peace
deal.</TE>
<TE>   Congo peace facilitator Ketumile Masire, a former president of
Botswana, denied that the Lusaka summit had failed to achieve its
objective of setting a definite timetable.</TE>
<TE>   "In principle they agree, but it would be unrealistic to expect a
definite program at a summit like this," he told a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   War erupted in 1998 when Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda invaded. Angola,
Namibia and Zimbabwe came to the defense of the Congolese government,
spawning a many-sided conflict that has killed more than 2 million
people, most from starvation and disease.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomats said Angola, Burundi and Uganda had indicated that they were
ready to complete an unconditional pullout from Congo.</TE>

<HD>Chechen Broadcasts Could Aid Extremists, Russia Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>The Russian government warned that Radio Free Europe/Radio
Liberty's new Chechen-language news broadcasts could feed extremism in
the troubled North Caucasus region.</LD>
<LD>   Alexei K. Volin, deputy Cabinet chief of staff, said he would "not
rule out the possibility that the broadcasts could be used by Chechen
radical groups," because of what he called the U.S.-funded station's
limited ability to control content, Echo of Moscow radio reported
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   He warned that the broadcasts beginning Wednesday could negatively
affect security in Russia and the United States.</LD>
<TE>   "The start of broadcasting in the Chechen language can be considered a
step, but not in the direction of stabilizing the situation in the North
Caucasus," Volin told the Izvestia newspaper Wednesday. "It is fraught
with possibilities of encouraging extremism not only in Russia but in
other friendly countries due to Chechen terrorists' contacts with
international terrorist organizations."</TE>
<TE>   Russia has been an enthusiastic partner in the U.S.-led fight against
terrorism, and it views Moscow's war in Chechnya as part of the greater
anti-terrorism effort. The government has gone to great lengths to
control reporting on Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin's spokesman on Chechnya, warned
Tuesday that Moscow might pull the radio station's broadcasting rights if
its Chechen programming shows a pro-rebel bias.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Not Convinced Doc Is Real Arafat-Terrorism Link</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Palestinians say alleged invoice from militants
responsible for recent attacks is forged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB DROGIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>U.S. officials said Wednesday that they were unable to confirm the
authenticity of a so-called terror invoice that Israel says its troops
found when they stormed the West Bank headquarters of Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration, desperately seeking a means to defuse the
mounting Mideast crisis, thus sought to avoid becoming embroiled in a
hotly debated sideshow to the bloodletting on the ground.</LD>
<LD>   Israel claims that the document directly links the office of the
besieged Palestinian leader with the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, the
militant offshoot of Arafat's Fatah movement that has conducted some of
the most horrific suicide bombings and other terrorist attacks against
Israeli civilians recently.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Israel released what it called an original invoice from
the group to a senior Palestinian official. The document, typewritten in
Arabic, requests money for bomb-making materials, assault rifles and
ammunition, and other expenses. The document is dated Sept. 16, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials dismissed the document as a crude forgery. A
spokesman called it "baseless and worthless."</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. official said Wednesday that Washington does not know if the
document is real, and suggested that the administration does not consider
the issue a high priority. "We cannot confirm its authenticity," the
official said. "It's possible, but we don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Israel long has accused Arafat of secretly backing terrorist groups,
which have killed more than 40 Israelis since the middle of last week.
Arafat has denied the charge and has condemned suicide attacks. If real,
the document offers the first public evidence of direct support by
someone close to Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Experts describe Al Aqsa as a network of armed guerrilla groups that
share similar tactics and objectives. The U.S. State Department recently
added it to its list of terrorist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials said the document was found Friday by troops who
searched the office of Fuad Shubaki, the Palestinian Authority's top
financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   Shubaki was reported earlier to have been arrested by Palestinian
police for authorizing payment for a shipload of Iranian weapons that
Israeli commandos intercepted in the Red Sea.</TE>
<TE>   The document released by Israel begins by referring to debts of more
than $8,000 that already had been incurred. It then cites "costs for
various electrical components and chemical supplies--for the production
of charges and bombs."</TE>
<TE>   "We need about 5 to 9 bombs a week for our cells in various areas,"
the document reads, noting that the devices "are our largest expense."</TE>
<TE>   The document also lists the cost of portraits of those killed opposing
the Israelis, and requests money to buy AK-47 assault rifles and
ammunition.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops have reoccupied West Bank cities and towns in an
attempt to crush what the government calls "a terrorist infrastructure"
responsible for suicide bombings. Israeli Col. Miri Eisen, an army
spokeswoman, said the document shows why that policy is justified.</TE>
<TE>   "You could probably call this a terror invoice," she told reporters in
Jerusalem. "You often ask what is a terrorist infrastructure? Who are we
[the army] acting against?</TE>
<TE>   "It's the suicide bombers themselves, those who are trying to
transport them, those making the bombs, and especially those who are
paying them, making sure they do it, making sure their families support
them," she said.</TE>

<HD>Egypt to Limit Ties With Israel but Keep Channels Open</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Cairo's move reflects pressures from below on Arab
regimes for a response to Jewish state's military actions.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>CAIRO
</DL>
<LD>The Egyptian government announced Wednesday that it will scale back
contacts with Israel--but keep diplomatic channels open--to protest the
Jewish state's military operations against Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   Egypt's decision, while falling far short of calls to sever all
diplomatic ties with Israel, reflects growing pressure faced by Arab
governments. Jordan and Egypt, the only two Arab nations to have signed
peace treaties with the Jewish state, have in recent days used helmeted
police and water cannons to disperse angry demonstrations.</LD>
<LD>   In Egypt, most classes were canceled at Cairo University to discourage
protests. Truckloads of riot police were on hand at the school's gates to
head off any possible disturbance. One front-page newspaper story spoke
of Israel's "Nazi-like atrocities" and ran a picture of Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon with a swastika drawn over his head.</LD>
<TE>   Amid this environment, President Hosni Mubarak opted for a show of
anger while preserving the landmark peace treaty his country signed with
Israel in 1979. Egypt has spoken with one of the few moderate voices in
the region, pushing for peace since the start of the Palestinian intifada
18 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The Cabinet decided to terminate or stop all contact between the two
governments, except the diplomatic channels as they serve the Palestinian
question and the overall question of peace in the area," said Nabil
Osman, the government's chief spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, he added, "War is not an Egyptian option, simply because
we have chosen peace."</TE>
<TE>   Last week in Beirut, Arab leaders adopted an initiative that offered
Israel security and recognition in return for its withdrawal to pre-1967
borders and other concessions. The summit was fractious, and its members
also endorsed the Palestinian intifada, called for continuing the fight
and labeled Israel a terrorist state. But the peace gesture, no matter
how limited, was enough to put off some hard-liners.</TE>
<TE>   As the Arab leaders were touting the proposal in Beirut, the militant
Islamic group Hamas sent a suicide bomber into a hotel in the central
Israeli coastal city of Netanya. The bomber killed 22 other people,
including elderly men and women, who had come together to celebrate the
Jewish Passover.</TE>
<TE>   The attack opened the door to the latest crisis, with Israeli troops
laying siege to Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's
headquarters and moving into Palestinian cities and towns. Israel says
the operation is aimed at dismantling a terrorist infrastructure it says
is responsible for a series of suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   Since they left Beirut, Arab leaders have almost uniformly been
silent. Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh said he was so disturbed by
the poor show of support for the Palestinians--even rhetorical
support--that he was boycotting all official contacts with his Arab
counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   Though the situation could easily change, officials and analysts said
the silence reflected a struggle between competing sentiments. On the one
side, there are feelings of unparalleled hatred for Israel, coupled with
the desire to do something to prove that the Arab world is not impotent.
This, however, is in contrast with the acceptance by many of the nations,
even hard-line states, that for economic and political reasons,
conventional war is not desirable.</TE>
<TE>   Those competing attitudes are on display in Lebanon, where
Syrian-backed Hezbollah fighters have stepped up cross-border attacks on
Israeli troops and civilians. But even as Hezbollah struck, Syria rapidly
redeployed about 20,000 troops it had stationed around Beirut, pulling
them back to the Bekaa Valley, an act perceived as a sign that Syria is
not interested in a direct confrontation with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "To open a second front, this I think is going too far," said Farid
Khazen, a political science professor at American University in Beirut,
who said Syria would like to step up the pressure without provoking a
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem that Hezbollah and Syria are facing today is they are not
sure of Israel's threshold," Khazen said.</TE>
<TE>   Independent of the Palestinian issue, most countries of the Arab world
are facing serious economic, social and political challenges. Yet it is
the Palestinian issue that dominates the agenda of the leadership. At the
request of the Palestinian Authority, Arab foreign ministers are
scheduled to meet in Cairo on Saturday to try to reconcile the desire to
avoid war with the growing pressure to do something to at least appear to
help the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   In Egypt, officials say that Mubarak has been working the phones,
consulting with regional and world leaders, quietly looking for some way
out of the morass. Ultimately, he decided to take this half-step, a nod
to the growing public pressure but also a signal to Israel, and the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   "The decision is to deal with an angry public and to send a signal to
the Israelis that Sharon is taking them down a very serious road with
very serious implications for everybody," said Abdel Moneim Said,
director of the Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in
Cairo.</TE>
<TE>   Egypt withdrew its ambassador from Tel Aviv in November 2000 to
protest Israel's initial handling of the Palestinian uprising against
Israeli occupation. Israel has kept its ambassador in Cairo.</TE>

<HD>Under Pressure, Powell Considers Talks With Israelis, Arabs</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: 'It's the secretary of State's job to go and to try,'
one senator says.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In a bow to mounting pressure that the United States get involved
in the volatile Mideast crisis, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said
Wednesday that he is considering holding talks with Israeli and Arab
leaders while in Europe next week.</LD>
<LD>   Though no decisions have been made, Powell is also considering a trip
to the Middle East after his European visit.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not out of the question that I might go to the region. It
depends. I'm willing to go to the region. But I have to go to the region
if I have a purpose that I can serve and there is something concrete to
be done," Powell said later on CBS' "60 Minutes II."</LD>
<TE>   Bush administration officials cautioned that Powell's schedule is
still in flux. But there is growing frustration in Washington with both
the Palestinians and the Israelis over their failure to heed strongly
worded U.S. messages to end the cycle of violence that spiked last week.</TE>
<TE>   There are serious risks involved in holding talks or making a Mideast
trip, especially if the administration is unable to get either side to
budge.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of good reasons not to do it--and a lot of reasons
the Israelis don't want him to," said the U.S. official, who requested
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Talks with Israeli and Palestinian officials in Europe would focus on
increasing the pressure on both sides to take specific, immediate actions
to end the violence.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has been sending messages during the last two
days with "a tougher edge" in an effort to get Israel to wrap up its
incursions into Palestinian-governed areas. "The Israelis apparently
don't feel a sense of urgency in this operation, which is of serious
concern to us," the U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell is scheduled to fly to Berlin and Madrid next week to attend a
U.S.-European Union session and meet with Russian Foreign Minister Igor
S. Ivanov to plan for President Bush's first trip to Russia next month.
But Powell acknowledged that the Mideast crisis is likely to be a major
issue during the trip.</TE>
<TE>   The president of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, said American
diplomacy had failed, and he called for European mediation and perhaps a
new conference to prevent an all-out regional war and get the parties
back to the negotiating table.</TE>
<TE>   Powell sought to minimize the U.S.-European differences. "I think we
have done so well to stay together and unified that I am going to work
hard to make sure we do stay together and unified," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The immediate problem is to get control over the terrorism and the
violence in the region. And until that is done, conferences that lay out
different kinds of political goals or new political initiatives just take
us off the main point," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who called on Powell to go to the Middle East was Sen.
Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), who made the same pitch to Bush on Tuesday during
a 25-minute limousine ride in Pennsylvania, where the president made two
public appearances.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to go when you've got it all worked out and you can have a
triumphant trip. But you can't go to bat and expect to hit a home run
every time. And I believe it's the secretary of State's job to go and to
try," Specter said on CBS' "The Early Show." Specter recently returned
from the Middle East, where he met with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon, Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat and U.S. special
envoy Anthony C. Zinni.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times, Specter said he told the president:
"If you don't try, you sure won't succeed; if you try, you might."</TE>
<TE>   At the State Department, meanwhile, a delegation of Arab American
leaders urged the United States to take a more evenhanded approach in the
Middle East and to work more aggressively to end the violence.</TE>
<TE>   In a private, 90-minute meeting with Powell, they urged the
administration to call for not only a cessation of all violence between
Arabs and Israelis but also "an immediate end to Israel's invasion and
occupation of Palestinian areas," said Ziad Asali, president of the
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.</TE>
<TE>   He said the group told Powell that the United States should also set a
specific date for the resumption of security and political talks.</TE>
<TE>   Another meeting participant, James Zogby, president of the Arab
American Institute, said the group also protested what it regards as
Washington's "achingly inadequate" public statements about the situation
in the region, which he says have been "perceived both in Israel and in
the Arab world as giving Ariel Sharon a green light while applying
pressure on only one party."</TE>
<TE>   Zogby said the group also chided Powell for suggesting that the
current Israeli operation could take "some weeks."</TE>
<TE>   After their session with Powell, Zogby and Asali told reporters
outside the State Department that their delegation was generally
satisfied with Powell's responses.</TE>
<TE>   "The secretary gets it," Zogby said. "The question, though, of the
broader policy is one that concerns us and concerns many in the region."</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Saudi Arabia weighed in, asking the administration to help
stop Sharon's offensive and restart the peace talks.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi ambassador to Washington, Prince Bandar ibn Sultan, has
warned administration officials that Arab support for the war on
terrorism could melt away as long as Arabs perceive that the United
States is giving Sharon a blank check, an Arab official said.</TE>
<TE>   But Bandar has made little headway, and the Saudis feel "frustrated,"
the official said.</TE>
<TE>   "Can't the administration see what this is doing to its own interests
in the region?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told reporters
that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has raised the amount that Iraq will
pay relatives of suicide bombers from $10,000 to $25,000.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said he was publicizing the Iraqi move as a way to remind the
world "of the problem that we're dealing with here."</TE>
<TE>   Times Washington Bureau Chief Doyle McManus contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>Israel Steps Up West Bank Offensive</HD>
<DH>Incursion: A soldier and 12 Palestinians die. The Jewish state has
near-total control of the area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Israel controlled almost every major Palestinian city in the West
Bank today after troops and armor shot their way into Nablus, a seething
militant stronghold.</LD>
<LD>   Twelve Palestinians and one Israeli soldier were killed Wednesday in
operations across the West Bank.</LD>
<LD>   A day after one of Christianity's holiest sites became a battlefield,
columns of tanks rolled into Nablus and were headed toward the volatile
Balata refugee camp, where heavy shooting was reported, witnesses said.</LD>
<TE>   The advance into Nablus was the latest in Israel's takeover of towns
and cities in the West Bank in a massive offensive that the government of
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon says is designed to stop a wave of suicide
bombers.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of Palestinians have been arrested, dozens killed and huge
amounts of property destroyed. But Israeli officials say they haven't
captured any top-level militants, and suicide bombings have continued
unabated.</TE>
<TE>   As Israel presses ahead with the campaign, the move into Nablus is
especially risky. It is the Palestinians' largest West Bank city, with
more than 180,000 people, and its cramped, labyrinthine old city, known
as the casbah, has always been synonymous in the Israeli lexicon with
nightmarish urban warfare.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian fighters were congregated earlier Wednesday in the casbah,
where they were placing sandbags and planning resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the suicide attacks were launched from the Nablus area.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, Israeli troops backed by helicopter gunships fought
their way into the West Bank city of Jenin and the town of Salfit. A
female nurse, a 13-year-old boy, a male civilian and three Palestinian
gunmen, along with an Israeli soldier, were killed in that operation,
security officials on both sides said.</TE>
<TE>   In Bethlehem, a standoff between the Israeli army and about 100
Palestinian gunmen holed up inside the Church of the Nativity continued
into a second day. The army said negotiations were underway to stave off
a blood bath on the spot where Jesus is believed to have been born.
Paratroops were fanning out through the narrow streets of Bethlehem.</TE>
<TE>   Alarmed at the escalating war, the European Union decided to send a
delegation to the region, but without assurances that it would even be
allowed to meet Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, who
remains a captive in his Ramallah headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "This is now the most dangerous conflict in the world," Peter Hain,
Britain's minister for Europe, said at a rare emergency meeting of EU
foreign ministers in Luxembourg.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon convened Cabinet ministers to approve the next stage of the
open-ended Operation Protective Wall.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian Authority issued a statement calling on Palestinians
to resist.</TE>
<TE>   "The Palestinian leadership urges our people to close ranks in a
long-term struggle against this occupation and to mobilize all its
resources . . . to confront this unjust and criminal war," it said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the landmark 1993 Oslo peace accords, eight West Bank cities
were handed to the Palestinian Authority. Only two of them, Hebron and
Jericho, were still under Palestinian control today.</TE>
<TE>   In the others--Nablus, Ramallah, Kalkilya, Jenin, Tulkarm and
Bethlehem--tanks patrolled streets and confined hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians to their homes. In Ramallah, city officials said residents
were without water after Israeli troops destroyed the main pumping
station when shelling a Palestinian security compound.</TE>
<TE>   In what some Israelis fear will be another front in the war, Israeli
fighter jets pounded suspected guerrilla hide-outs in southern Lebanon
after Israeli army outposts were repeatedly attacked in a disputed border
area, security officials and witnesses said.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>U.S. television networks are attempting to keep the pictures coming
out of the Middle East as the fighting widens and Israeli officials have
sought to restrict access to some areas of conflict.</LD>
<LD>   CBS News President Andrew Heyward met with the Israeli consul general
in New York on Wednesday to protest restrictions that caused CBS
correspondents to be escorted out of Ramallah in the West Bank earlier in
the week. "We told him we want to be there to tell both sides of the
story," said Marcy McGinnis, senior vice president of news coverage for
CBS News, who also attended the meeting.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli officials have also threatened NBC and CNN with possible legal
action if they continue to keep journalists in Ramallah, which houses
Yasser Arafat's compound, despite attempts to make it off limits to
reporters.</LD>
<TE>   Other print and TV journalists continue to report from Ramallah in
defiance of the ban, which has been criticized by a number of press
freedom organizations. Israel, despite its threats, has yet to expel any
journalists.</TE>
<TE>   NBC and CNN declined to comment on the threat of legal action, with
NBC saying only that the network "believes the press should have access
to stories as important as this one."</TE>
<TE>   The restrictions--and the danger--have made pictures "very hard to
come by," said Paul Slavin, executive producer of ABC's "World News
Tonight." Even when staffers manage to get into restricted areas, they
often play "a game of cat and mouse to get material out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The difficulties are relative, however. "Of course, I wish we had
better pictures, I wish we had better access," Slavin said, while noting
that the access is still better than what the networks were afforded for
most of the U.S. military action in Afghanistan, where reporters and
coverage were severely restricted.</TE>
<TE>   Despite those limitations, said Bill Wheatley, NBC news vice
president, "I believe we have been able to get pictures that are
accurately telling the story."</TE>
<TE>   As Israeli military action has widened, the networks have had to
scramble to be many places at once. Many networks are sending in more
journalists. Wheatley said NBC has increased the amount of coordination
with its traditional partners, including the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
and Germany's ZDF, to share information and pictures, occasionally
dividing up areas to cover.</TE>
<TE>   The networks say they leave it to their journalists on site to decide
whether the danger is too great to stay. NBC correspondent Dana Lewis was
fired upon; CBS anchor Dan Rather passed by a bombing site only moments
before the explosion.</TE>
<TE>   CBS is using one armored car in the region, McGinnis said, and taking
other precautions, including flak jackets and helmets; still, she said
the constant threat of violence from both combat and suicide bombers
"weighs heavily on your psyche."</TE>
<TE>   Network executives declined to provide estimates of what they are
spending on their coverage, but ABC's Slavin noted that "not once has
someone said you can't do this because it will cost too much money."</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Set New Rules for Fight on Terrorism</HD>
<DH>Policy: Homeland security chief Ridge says the focus is on critical
industries, with private firms sharing the cost.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Homeland security director Tom Ridge served notice Wednesday that
the federal government planned to set new safety standards to protect
Americans from terrorism and would expect private industry to bear some
of the cost.</LD>
<LD>   In a wide-ranging interview with a group of reporters, Ridge said his
office was preparing to move beyond the current phase of identifying weak
spots in American security and would draft measures for corrective action
by midyear.</LD>
<LD>   The new guidelines, addressing such areas of concern as ports,
airlines, trains, food, water and nuclear plants, are expected to set off
a fierce lobbying battle from industry groups.</LD>
<TE>   Ridge's comments about the responsibilities of private businesses came
in response to a question about the nation's waterworks industry, which
includes both public and private utilities. It has asked for $2 billion
in federal aid to safeguard the nation's water supply.</TE>
<TE>   But he made clear that the same logic would apply to a wide variety of
potential targets.</TE>
<TE>   "My view has been that if it's a private company, a profit-making
enterprise, then the responsibility for enhanced security is really your
responsibility," Ridge said. "That doesn't mean that the federal
government does not set standards; we have been and will continue to do
so."</TE>
<TE>   The government's homeland security plans have been the focus of
scrutiny and concern from private industry leaders, who say they realize
they have a role to play in making the U.S. more secure but are worried
that new rules may be costly and potentially counterproductive.</TE>
<TE>   And lawmakers say they expect heavy pressure from powerful industry
groups wanting the government to help them meet any new security
requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "The overarching mantra here is that everyone is going to be asked to
sacrifice to improve homeland security, and that's going to include
corporate America," said David Sirota, a spokesman for Rep. David R. Obey
of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee.
"How that exactly plays out I can't be sure."</TE>
<TE>   Sirota, however, said the fact that there is little room for any
discretionary spending "only strengthens the need of large corporations
to chip in and do their part."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Curtis, a spokesman for the American Water Works Assn., said his
industry continued to believe the federal government should help both its
public and private members respond to heightened security needs. Members
of his group lobbied Congress and administration officials last month for
such assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis said the bioterrorism bill currently before Congress would
require about 7,500 water utilities to draw up risk assessment plans, a
step the industry estimates would cost $450 million.</TE>
<TE>   "If utilities are going to be required to do this work and do it on a
very quick schedule, many utilities will need some support," Curtis said.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush appointed Ridge to the newly created position Oct. 8,
and the security chief has hired about 100 staff members to help him
carry out the president's promise to make Americans less vulnerable to
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly six months on the job, Ridge painted a picture Wednesday of a
task only just begun. Preliminary steps have been taken to improve the
security of the airlines, ports and food supply, but inspectors lack
important tools such as those that could easily detect biological
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Calling the more than 40 agencies that have some hand in homeland
security an "extraordinary bureaucratic maze," Ridge said that while Bush
has given him license to assess what changes may be needed, he "will not
recommend reorganization simply for reorganization's sake."</TE>
<TE>   Ridge played a large role in the Bush administration's decision to
earmark nearly $40 billion for homeland security--a fact that has
Democrats demanding that he testify formally to congressional committees.</TE>
<TE>   He said he planned to speak informally to two House committees in the
next weeks: Government Reform next Thursday and Energy and Commerce on
April 17. But he said that his appearances would be for the purpose of
discussion, not testimony.</TE>
<TE>   As a former member of Congress, he said, he understands the tension
between the legislative and executive branches.</TE>
<TE>   "I also served as governor and now serve a president and understand
there are people around an executive who should be accessible but not
compelled to testify, and I fall into that category," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The wrangling over homeland security spending and direction extends
throughout the industries most directly affected by heightened security
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   While there is little argument about the need to do more to safeguard
consumers post-Sept. 11, there is disagreement about what form such
changes should take.</TE>
<TE>   The American Chemical Council, for example, says its members would
like guidance from federal security experts on the greatest risks they
face.</TE>
<TE>   But council spokesman Chris VandenHeuvel said his group believed the
American people would be best served by the government "making
recommendations and then leaving it to private industry to spend the
resources necessary to make that happen--with credible third parties
verifying it was done."</TE>
<TE>   Ridge also defended his five-color terrorism alert system, which went
into effect last month. He said the system will, in the future, signal to
both governmental agencies and private companies what levels of
protection they need to maintain for national security.</TE>
<TE>   At present, the degree of alert is yellow, the midpoint between the
highest alert (red) and the lowest (green). Despite escalating violence
in the Middle East, he said there are no plans to raise the alert level.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service policy will provide farmers
and ranchers in Idaho with federal permits to kill wolves even if the
animals aren't seen killing livestock.</LD>
<LD>   The policy is an extension of one in place for two years in the
Yellowstone National Park wolf recovery area, a service spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   The permit policy does not apply to the panhandle area north of
Interstate 90, and northwestern Montana, where gray wolves are fully
protected as an endangered species.</LD>
<TE>   The 45-day permits allow private landowners to kill any single wolf on
their property. Previous policy allowed ranchers to kill wolves only when
they were caught attacking or feeding on livestock on private land.</TE>

<HD>Seinfeld Project Has No Laugh Lines</HD>
<DH>Conflict: TV celebrity is building a garage in Manhattan to house
his prized cars. But neighbors are up in arms over the dust, noise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>If this wasn't a real-life Manhattan comedy, you'd swear it was a
"Seinfeld" script. Imagine Jerry and Kramer circling the block, looking
in vain for a parking place, as big construction trucks block the street.</LD>
<LD>   When Jerry learns a big shot is building his own garage for luxury
cars, he blows up. But Kramer sees it differently: "We're not just
talking cars, Jerry," he says. "We're talking Porsches. Oh, yeah,
Porsches!"</LD>
<LD>   For the residents of a small block on Manhattan's Upper West Side,
life is now imitating Seinfeld. Ever since TV comedian Jerry Seinfeld
began constructing a garage to house Porsches and other cars on West 83rd
Street, the aggravation from noise and dust has reached a breaking point
for many residents.</LD>
<TE>   It's a crowded block that already has three large public garages, two
rental car agencies, 10 residential buildings, a firehouse, a post
office, a public school and a police station around the corner. This is a
street where not everybody loves Jerry--and his decision to build a
garage here, three blocks from his co-op near Central Park, has sparked
strong reactions from characters who could have come right out of his
show.</TE>
<TE>   There's the beleaguered but hopeful yoga instructor next door. "Jerry
is our supreme teacher," confides Jennifer Walker. "If my students can
learn to breathe through all the noise and construction, they'll master
the art of deep breathing in a hurry."</TE>
<TE>   The anxious chiropractor two doors down is less upbeat. "It's been
like a subway rumbling through here," says Glenn Scarpelli. "And we're
powerless--powerless--to do anything about it!"</TE>
<TE>   Get a life, advises Felix Rios, a philosopher-plumber who works four
doors down from the garage. "Seinfeld is a rich man who can do what he
wants," Rios says. "If it drives you nuts, what are you going to do?"</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, the story of Jerry's Garage shows how New Yorkers'
nerves can fray when it comes to street parking. Many residents don't own
autos because they're expensive and too much trouble in a traffic-clogged
city. Despite nerve-racking rides and mechanical breakdowns, the Big
Apple's taxis, subways and buses offer more reliable transportation.</TE>
<TE>Finding a Space Is Only Half the Problem</TE>
<TE>   For those with cars, finding a space is a frustrating battle.
"Everybody in New York knows there's way more cars than parking spaces,"
Seinfeld himself once noted. "It's like musical chairs, except everybody
sat down around 1964."</TE>
<TE>   Even if you find a space, good luck figuring out the parking
regulations. On West 83rd Street, a flurry of signs on the same block
appear to offer conflicting rules, ranging from "No Parking--11 a.m. to
12:30 p.m. Monday and Thursday" to "No Standing--Fire Zone" to "No
Parking Anytime."</TE>
<TE>   The final barrier to street parking is a torturous, daily ballet
called Alternate Side Parking Regulations. It requires motorists to
remove cars from one side of the street to permit street sweeping and
double-park them temporarily on the other side before returning to the
original side after cleaning is completed. This is a complex procedure
with rules about where people can or can't double-park that varies from
one street to the next.</TE>
<TE>   If you can afford it, there's always room in a $450-per-month garage.
But if you're Jerry Seinfeld, you simply buy a storefront for $880,000
and spend $1.3 million to build a three-story garage.</TE>
<TE>   He set up seismographs to measure the effect of drilling on local
businesses and plans to build an elevator inside the structure to move
his luxury cars from one floor to another. Seinfeld also plans to build a
kitchenette and office in the small 16-by-52-foot brick building.</TE>
<TE>Seinfeld Offers Gifts of Wine</TE>
<TE>   When it's completed, the garage is expected to hold up to five cars,
including some of the comedian's prized Porsches, which he collects. His
1957 Porsche Carrera GT Racer fetched $92,800 at auction last year.</TE>
<TE>   Not that there's anything wrong with that.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Seinfeld's construction company, Campbell and Cantor, has
received all the necessary permits from the city's Building Department,
and the TV star has attempted to soothe ruffled feathers on the block by
offering some residents and merchants complimentary bottles of wine.</TE>
<TE>   "Jerry loves the Upper West Side, and the last thing he'd want to do
is become a stigma in the neighborhood," said his publicist, Elizabeth
Clark. "He's followed the rules, and he's a very considerate person. He
doesn't want to offend anyone," Clark said, adding that the gift of the
wine "shows this is what he'll do if he thinks he's inconveniencing
anyone."</TE>
<TE>   More important, his construction crew has halted work each day during
the 15-minute "savasana," or relaxation period, following yoga sessions
in Walker's Practice Yoga studio. Earlier, the firm compensated her when
the center had to cancel classes for a week because of intensely loud
drilling.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice for him to have done all these things, but we've still had
our share of problems," said Scarpelli, noting that drilling in the last
month has sent shock waves through his home. "At some point you ask if
someone is a good or a bad neighbor, and I'm afraid he's been a bad
neighbor."</TE>
<TE>   On a summer-like day this week, kids whizzed by the garage site on
bicycles and mothers pushed babies in strollers. A construction worker
hauling large bags of debris to a nearby dumpster truck said the project
would be finished early next year--prompting a hearty laugh from Walker.</TE>
<TE>   People in the neighborhood have heard conflicting finish dates,
ranging from this summer to the fall, she said, and the possibility of
the garage work continuing through next year doesn't particularly
surprise her. Besides, Walker noted, it's been a priceless experience.</TE>
<TE>   "In yoga, a Ganesh is the elephant-headed god, the creator and
destroyer of obstacles," she said. "Jerry has given us a more intense
working environment. He's given us our own little obstacles. He is our
Ganesh."</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Archdiocese Turns Over List of Abuse Cases</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>In an apparent about-face, Cardinal Edward M. Egan announced
Wednesday that the New York Archdiocese has voluntarily given the
Manhattan district attorney's office an unspecified number of files on
cases involving priests who have been accused of sexual misconduct with
minors.</LD>
<LD>   Not all of the allegations in the files have been substantiated, the
archdiocese said in a statement. Previously, Egan had indicated he would
only inform authorities of cases in which he determined there was
"reasonable cause" to suspect priests, and only if victims agreed to the
disclosure.</LD>
<LD>   That policy prompted criticism that Egan was not cooperating as
vigorously as other church leaders with investigations of sexual abuse in
the priesthood. Other critics had suggested that Egan covered up cases of
abuse when he was a bishop in Bridgeport, Conn., a contention that Egan
has denied.</LD>
<TE>   "The information forwarded to Dist. Atty. Robert Morgenthau is the
result of a comprehensive review of the personnel files for priests of
the Archdiocese of New York covering the last 35 [to] 40 years," the
archdiocese said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The information sent to Morgenthau included "the date and location of
the alleged activity and the outcome of any legal proceedings that may
have been taken, along with the status of the accused, if it is known."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Egan nor Morgenthau would comment specifically on the files,
but the transfer is expected to accelerate local investigations of sexual
misconduct in the nation's third-largest archdiocese. Morgenthau said he
would forward relevant information to fellow district attorneys in
neighboring jurisdictions.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure had been building on Egan to cooperate more actively, and the
archdiocese's move came amid new calls for disclosure from Westchester
County's district attorney, Jeanine Pirro. She asked Egan to provide
files going back at least 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   Pirro said it was "particularly inappropriate" for the church to
require consent from underage victims before disclosing the names of
suspected priests.</TE>
<TE>   New York law does not require churches to provide such information to
police, but state legislators are moving toward final passage of a bill
to mandate such disclosure from the clergy, as well as from teachers and
physicians.</TE>

<HD>Grounded Pilots Made a Number of Mistakes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Frontier Airlines flight crew that violated restricted airspace
over Washington on Monday flew slightly west of the White House and the
Washington Monument, then flew directly over the vice presidential
residence on the Naval Observatory grounds while trying to get back on
course, aviation sources said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier that day, the same crew had been forced to land at Dulles
International Airport after failing to properly give the password for
permission to fly to its original destination, Reagan National Airport.</LD>
<LD>   The crew's two pilots, who have not been identified, have been
suspended pending an investigation by the airline and the Federal
Aviation Administration.</LD>
<TE>   FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said three other commercial flights and a
medical helicopter have violated White House airspace since Sept. 11, but
none as deeply as the Frontier flight.</TE>
<TE>   Officials, puzzling Wednesday over how one flight crew could make so
many mistakes, said the incident involving Frontier Flight 724 points out
both the strengths and weaknesses of flight security restrictions at
National.</TE>
<TE>   The Secret Service lobbied hard to keep National closed after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, sources said, but President Bush decided
otherwise after hearing from local officials about the devastating
economic effect such a closing would have. Instead, new security measures
were imposed, including more searches of passengers and baggage and
special flight procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers aboard the inbound Frontier flight were never told why they
were landing at Dulles. In fact, one passenger said that after landing, a
flight attendant made an announcement welcoming the passengers to
National.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew it wasn't National," the passenger said.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot then announced that the plane had been told to land at
Dulles and said he didn't know why. The plane was surrounded by vehicles
with flashing lights and was escorted to a secure area for unloading.</TE>

<HD>A Second American Talib Might Be in U.S. Custody</HD>
<DH>Crime: Man held in Cuba was born in Louisiana, records appear to
show. He was captured at the same Afghan prison as John Walker Lindh.</DH>

</DL>
<LD>The U.S. government may have in its custody a second American who
fought for the Taliban in Afghanistan, authorities said Wednesday after
checking birth records that appear to support that he was born in
Louisiana.</LD>
<LD>   The young man, identified by government officials as 22-year-old
Yasser Esam Hamdi, was captured after a late November prison uprising at
Mazar-i-Sharif, the same site where the military seized John Walker
Lindh, a Northern Californian who fought for the Taliban.</LD>
<LD>   Hamdi is one of 300 detainees being held at the U.S. naval base at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   Army Lt. Col. Dan Stoneking, however, cautioned that U.S. authorities
have not confirmed that Hamdi was born in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneking and other government officials noted that most of the
detainees are giving false information about their backgrounds. At this
stage of their investigation, however, they said Hamdi's claim of U.S.
citizenship appears to be valid.</TE>
<TE>   If true, Stoneking said, Hamdi probably would be removed from
Guantanamo Bay and placed in the custody of federal law enforcement
officials, much like Lindh, who is awaiting trial in Virginia on murder
conspiracy charges.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an individual among the detainees in [Guantanamo] who has
indicated his place of birth is Baton Rouge, La.," Stoneking said. "The
Department of Justice has recently informed us that they have uncovered a
corresponding birth certificate in Baton Rouge.</TE>
<TE>   "However, whether or not that means this detainee is a U.S. citizen
may involve some more legal determination. So we're not prepared to
answer that at this point."</TE>
<TE>   Stoneking added that "it's our understanding his parents were employed
in Louisiana at the time of his birth and then returned to Saudi Arabia
when he was a toddler."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials confirmed that they had found a birth
certificate that matched the birth date Hamdi gave U.S. authorities.</TE>
<TE>   But, said one Justice Department official, "we're unclear whether he
was telling them he was an American or whether the military, in doing
checks on these guys, found out he is an American. The Pentagon holds
these guys. We don't."</TE>
<TE>   Stoneking said he and other authorities at Guantanamo have said that
most of the detainees are giving false names to their U.S. interrogators
as well as incorrect information about their pasts. In essence, they
said, the detainees are being very uncooperative and making it extremely
difficult for the U.S. to sort them out.</TE>
<TE>   "Gitmo is full of bad people," Stoneking said, using the military
nickname for Guantanamo. "And among their bad traits is being inveterate
liars. That adds to the difficulties in further concluding who these
people really are."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are attempting to determine whether Hamdi had dual
citizenship with the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   A State Department official said a search of records indicates that
Hamdi never applied for an American passport to travel abroad. The
official also could not say whether Hamdi had ever applied for a visa to
return to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh, who was raised in Marin County, is scheduled to go on trial in
August. His lawyers say that he fought for the Taliban only against the
Northern Alliance in Afghanistan and that he never attempted to betray
his country.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh and Hamdi were captured after the prison uprising, which cost
the life of the first U.S. casualty in the war against terrorism, CIA
officer Johnny "Mike" Spann.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Four months after a judge pulled the plug on the Interior
Department's Internet access, Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton still
can't send e-mail.</LD>
<LD>   Her entire office remains offline, as do the government agencies
responsible for American Indian affairs and mining on federal land.</LD>
<LD>   "We're all hurriedly sending smoke signals" to cope with the lack of
Web access, said Nedra Darling, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Indian
Affairs. "We're doing a lot more faxing. We're making a lot more phone
calls and doing a lot more mailing."</LD>
<TE>   On Dec. 5, U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered officials to
disconnect the department's computers from the Internet to stop hackers
from breaking into an accounting system that manages $500 million in
royalties from Indian land each year.</TE>
<TE>   A court-appointed investigator had found that even a novice hacker
could breach the system's security.</TE>
<TE>   Now, 85% of Interior's access has been restored, the department says.
Still out of service are the accounting systems for the Indian money
Lamberth had sought to guard.</TE>

<HD>Terror Suspect Admits Trying to Kill Guard</HD>
<DH>Court: Prosecutors say the electrical engineer is the
highest-ranking Al Qaeda member held in the United States.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>An electrical engineer who prosecutors say is a confidant of Osama
bin Laden's and a founding member of the Al Qaeda terrorist group pleaded
guilty Wednesday to attempted murder in the stabbing of a federal prison
guard.</LD>
<LD>   Government lawyers said the attack was part of a plot to take hostages
at the high-security unit of the Metropolitan Correctional Center in
Manhattan.</LD>
<LD>   In a courtroom closed to the press, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim admitted that
he stabbed Louis Pepe in the eye with a sharpened comb, a November 2000
attack that left the guard brain damaged.</LD>
<TE>   "I am pleading guilty because I am guilty according to American law,"
said Salim, who is believed to be the highest-ranking member of Al Qaeda
being held in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   He could face life in prison when he is sentenced in August.</TE>
<TE>   Salim, 45, has been in custody since September 1998. He is accused of
plotting to murder American citizens in the August 1998 bombings of two
U.S. embassies in East Africa that killed 224 people. Salim still faces
trial in that case.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom Wednesday, Richard Lind, his lawyer, said Salim
is not cooperating with the government in the embassy cases or other
matters.</TE>
<TE>   An indictment in the embassy bombings, however, shows the quality of
the information prosecutors believe he possesses.</TE>
<TE>   Salim allegedly acted as a business agent and financial advisor to Bin
Laden, conducted sensitive missions to a number of countries on his
behalf and managed terrorist training camps in Afghanistan. According to
court papers, Bin Laden and Salim worked to obtain the components of
nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Deborah A. Batts took the unusual step Wednesday
of closing the courtroom to the public when Salim described the stabbing.
The judge said she wanted to minimize the possibility of juror prejudice
should Salim's plea not be legally acceptable and should Salim go to
trial next week.</TE>
<TE>   After Salim successfully pleaded guilty, Batts ordered a transcript of
the proceedings to be released.</TE>
<TE>   Salim, with a fresh haircut and wearing blue prison fatigues,
conferred with his lawyer as he replied to the judge's questions.</TE>
<TE>   Before the plea, Assistant U.S. Atty. Daniel Himmelfarb succinctly
outlined the government's case.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor said that during a trial the government would have
presented the testimony of eyewitnesses, law enforcement officers and
evidence gathered at the crime scene, including a ransom note with
Salim's fingerprints on it.</TE>
<TE>   The note said Muslims had captured the 10th floor of the prison and
said the action had been taken because they were deprived of their legal
rights.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to attempted murder, Salim also pleaded guilty to
conspiracy to murder the guard.</TE>
<TE>   "In Nov. 1, 2000, I stabbed officer Pepe by a sharpened comb in his
left eye," he told the court.</TE>

<HD>Man Shoots Himself at Cathedral in N.Y.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>A man who said he was depressed shot himself in the head Wednesday
in the parish house of St. Patrick's Cathedral after talking with a
priest, authorities and church officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The man, covered in blood, was taken by ambulance to a hospital, where
he was listed in extremely critical condition.</LD>
<LD>   Police gave no motive for the shooting. Police Commissioner Raymond W.
Kelly said the man wrote a note while talking to the priest that said he
wanted to be buried in an Armenian cemetery.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said they had not determined the man's identity. No
identification was found in his wallet. Police said they planned to
obtain his fingerprints in hopes of learning his name.</TE>
<TE>   His injuries were so severe that authorities initially reported he had
died, but police said later that he had been revived at Weill Cornell
Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   The priest, identified only as Father Mike, was shaken but apparently
not hurt. Police had not interviewed him as of Wednesday evening.</TE>
<TE>   The gunman appeared in the rectory reception area about 2:20 p.m.,
waited for a priest to be summoned, then went with the priest into a
room, said Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York.</TE>
<TE>   The man talked about the quality of his life and said he didn't want
to live anymore, according to a police source who spoke on condition of
anonymity. The man also made statements that caused the priest to fear
for his own life, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   Police and church officials said the man asked for a pencil and paper,
wrote a note, handed it to the priest and then pulled a gun from his
waistband.</TE>
<TE>   The priest backed out of the room and, as he warned the others in the
office area, the man shot himself, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the weapon was a .357-caliber Ruger, which had five
bullets when it was recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg met Wednesday evening with Cardinal Edward
M. Egan to discuss security measures at the cathedral. Bloomberg said
every indication was that the gunman "came to take his own life."</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg said any increase in security at St. Patrick's was up to the
archdiocese and the police commissioner.</TE>

<HD>Michael Kennedy's Ex-Baby-Sitter on Witness List in Skakel Trial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NORWALK, Conn.
</DL>
<LD>A woman who allegedly had a sexual relationship with the late
Michael Kennedy when she was 14 will likely testify in the murder trial
of Kennedy's cousin Michael Skakel, lawyers said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Neither prosecutors nor defense lawyers would say why the woman would
be called to testify.</LD>
<LD>   Jury selection continued for a second day in the trial of Skakel, who
is accused of beating Martha Moxley to death in 1975 with a golf club.</LD>
<TE>   In 1997, Skakel was questioned by investigators looking into reports
that Michael Kennedy had an affair with the woman when she was a
14-year-old baby-sitter for his children. Sex with a minor under 16 is
statutory rape under Massachusetts law.</TE>
<TE>   No charges were ever filed against Kennedy, who died later that year
in a skiing accident.</TE>
<TE>   A third person was seated on the jury Wednesday. After all 12 jurors
and four alternates are selected, the trial is expected to take more than
a month.</TE>
<TE>   Moxley's death was unsolved for years but drew renewed attention after
several books were published about the case. Skakel, whose father was the
brother of Ethel Kennedy, was arrested in January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, Skakel, now 41, could face life in prison.</TE>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department is considering a proposal to let local and
state police officers enforce immigration laws in the aftermath of the
Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Some police departments are resisting the idea of enforcing
noncriminal immigration violations, but Justice Department spokesman Dan
Nelson said Wednesday that the Immigration and Naturalization Service
does not have enough federal agents to do the work.</LD>
<LD>   "With more than 7 million illegal aliens in the United States and only
2,000 INS [investigators] to handle interior enforcement, the Department
of Justice is exploring many options to enforce immigration laws," he
said.</LD>
<TE>   Some police departments are reluctant to get involved in immigration
violations because of concerns over racial profiling and because they
feel it could discourage immigrants from coming forward to help in
criminal cases.</TE>
<TE>   Immigrant roundups conducted by local authorities in conjunction with
the Border Patrol in Chandler, Ariz., in 1997, led to the apprehension of
435 illegal immigrants. But residents sued the city for $35 million
because they were stopped and asked to prove citizenship. The city
settled the suit, paying the plaintiffs $400,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a long-standing policy that our officers are not U.S.
immigration officials," said David Cohen, San Diego Police Department
spokesman. "We operate with one of the smallest big-city police
departments, and our people are plenty busy responding to calls for
service and doing proactive community policing work."</TE>
<TE>   But Jim Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police,
said that, "at a time like this in particular, we welcome the
opportunity." He said it does not make sense for local police to enforce
other federal laws and not immigration laws.</TE>
<TE>   "Every member of the Fraternal Order of Police is a sworn law
enforcement officer," he said. "We don't make judgments as to what laws
are appropriate to be enforced."</TE>
<TE>   Mayors in several major cities have rejected local involvement in
enforcing immigration laws, said Angela Kelley, deputy director for the
National Immigration Forum, an immigrant advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   "It's appalling the attorney general thinks he knows more than the
mayors of the cities of New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, to name a few,
about how to do community and local policing," Kelley said.</TE>

<HD>Billy Graham Remarks Misconstrued, Son Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.
</DL>
<LD>Evangelist Billy Graham's comments about Jews that were recorded at
the White House 30 years ago were not directed at all Jews but at a small
media elite who controlled "the major outlets at that time," his son
says.</LD>
<LD>   "The issue has never been Jewish people," evangelist Franklin Graham
said. "His concern was liberalism in that time in the media. And it's
changed."</LD>
<LD>   The 1972 White House tapes, released last month, included the Southern
Baptist evangelist expressing disdain for what he saw as Jewish
domination of the media.</LD>
<TE>   "This stranglehold has got to be broken or this country's going down
the drain," Billy Graham said, agreeing with President Nixon's own
comments earlier in the conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Several religious groups have criticized Billy Graham for not standing
up to Nixon.</TE>
<TE>   In an apology, Billy Graham, now 83 and in frail health, said he
should have disagreed with Nixon's remarks about Jews. He asked the
Jewish community "to reflect on my actions on behalf of Jews over the
years that contradict my words in the Oval Office that day."</TE>
<TE>   Franklin Graham, his father's chosen successor, said his father's
comments were taken out of context. He said many other people have had
private conversations they wouldn't want to be made public.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you have a private conversation with anybody and it's taped
and released, your confidence has been broken," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His comments came in an interview with the Charlotte Observer.</TE>

<HD>Owner Wants Ship's Alaska Ban Lifted</HD>

<LD>The Exxon Valdez should be allowed to return to Alaska's Prince
William Sound, where it spilled 11 million gallons of oil in 1989, the
tanker's owner told an appeals court Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Exxon Valdez, which now sails between the Middle East and Asia,
has been barred from the sound since 1990, when Congress passed the Oil
Pollution Act. The act prohibits any tanker that has spilled more than 1
million gallons since March 22, 1989, from entering Prince William Sound.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyer E. Edward Bruce, who represents Exxon Mobil Corp. subsidiary
SeaRiver Maritime Inc., argued that the law is unconstitutional because
it singles out SeaRiver.</LD>
<TE>   "This [law] was designed to exclude the Exxon Valdez from Alaska
because of the hostility of Alaskans to the vessel," said Bruce.</TE>
<TE>   He argued that Congress wanted to punish the Exxon Valdez when it set
the date in the law as March 22, 1989. The ship ran aground the next day,
devastating fish and wildlife and smearing oil across 1,500 miles of
coastline in the nation's worst oil spill.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department lawyer Mark Stern argued that the law is
constitutional and denied that it singled out SeaRiver. Around the world,
dozens of other tankers have spilled that much oil since March 1989 and
none would be allowed to enter Prince William Sound under the law, he
said.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration is pushing for an engineer from India to
take over the helm of an influential international science panel on
global warming that is now headed by an American atmospheric chemist who
has been criticized by the energy industry.</LD>
<LD>   Energy lobbyists have accused Robert T. Watson, chairman of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, of promoting his own agenda.
In a memo to the White House a year ago, a senior Exxon Mobil Corp.
official urged the administration to push him out.</LD>
<LD>   "Can Watson be replaced now at the request of the U.S.?" asks the
memo, which was obtained from the White House through a Freedom of
Information Act request by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an
environmental group.</LD>
<TE>   The council accuses the Bush administration of turning its back on
solid science and bending to industry wishes by supporting Watson's
challenger, Dr. Rajendra K. Pachauri. In an election later this month,
the 100-plus member countries of the climate panel will have one vote
each on the chairmanship.</TE>
<TE>   "It's bad enough that Exxon Mobil controls White House energy and
climate policies," said Daniel Lashof, science director of the NRDC
Climate Center. "Now they want to control the science too."</TE>
<TE>   Also promoting Watson's reelection are leading climate scientists such
as Ralph J. Cicerone, chancellor of UC Irvine and chairman of a National
Academy of Sciences panel that reviewed global warming issues for the
Bush White House.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials said they decided to support Pachauri
because his background as an engineer and an economist prepares him to
determine the global implications of climate science. They said the
administration also believes that a chairman from the developing world
would signal that global climate change is a problem for the whole world,
not just for wealthy nations.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists and Watson say the administration's decision
reflects its discomfort with having Watson on a prestigious platform for
broadcasting to the world the seriousness of global climate change
resulting from the burning of coal, gas, oil and other fossil fuels.</TE>
<TE>   "There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed
over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities," the climate
change panel concluded last year in its third comprehensive assessment
under Watson's chairmanship.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been hearing over the last month or two that a small vocal part
of the energy industry has been putting a lot of pressure on the U.S.
government not to reelect me," said Watson, who was the associate
director for environment in the White House Office of Science and
Technology during President Clinton's first term.</TE>
<TE>   Watson said he believes he still has a good chance to win reelection.
Officials from many countries have told him they will support his
candidacy because of his ability to organize thousands of scientists to
review documents and develop coherent analyses of the complicated
problem.</TE>
<TE>   Watson said he hopes the Bush administration does not believe energy
lobbyists' claims that he advocates tough government regulations of
industries that emit carbon dioxide, the major greenhouse gas produced
from human activity.</TE>
<TE>   "My advocacy is for truth in science--that we do get the very best
scientists from around the world," Watson said. "The argument that I'm an
advocate for regulations against the oil industry is incorrect."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush's climate change policy calls on industry to
voluntarily reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Scott McClellan disputed the claim that the
Exxon Mobil memo influenced the White House decision on the IPCC
chairmanship. The memo "was faxed to an individual who had no involvement
with IPCC leadership issues and took no action on the memo," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither he nor any official provided by the Bush administration to
comment on the issue flatly denied that industry influence played a role
in the State Department's decision to side with Pachauri.</TE>
<TE>   Energy industry lobbyists met Tuesday with State Department officials
before the decision to support Pachauri was announced. But a Bush
administration official said the decision already had been made.</TE>

<DL>PHILADELPHIA
</DL>
<LD>Children born to couples who are first or second cousins have a
lower risk of birth defects than is commonly believed, but it still can
be nearly twice as high as usual, according to a study released
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   An unrelated couple has an approximately 3% to 4% risk of having a
child with a birth defect, significant mental retardation or serious
genetic disease, the researchers said. They found that close cousins face
an additional risk of 1.7% to 2.8%.</LD>
<LD>   That is lower than many people, including family doctors, believed to
be the case, said Robin Bennett, one of the researchers.</LD>
<TE>   "The common-sense point of this is that there is a definite risk, but
the risk is rather small," said Dr. Arno G. Motulsky, another of the
researchers and a professor of medicine and genome sciences at the
University of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The analysis of six already-published studies appears in this month's
issue of the Journal of Genetic Counseling. The six studies involved
thousands of related couples.</TE>
<TE>   In some countries, up to 60% of the population is related by blood,
and marriages between cousins are preferred to unions of unrelated
couples. Immigrants are continuing that tradition in the United States,
so doctors need to be better informed about how to treat and advise
related couples, Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   "There have surely been lots of terminations of pregnancies because of
misconceptions about the actual level of risk," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers stressed that it is impossible to calculate the risk with
precision because so many factors are involved. Risks vary among ethnic
groups, and the family history and closeness of the relation may also
play a role.</TE>
<TE>   Funding for the study came from the National Society of Genetic
Counselors and the Department of Health and Human Services.</TE>

<HD>Killer's Mental Competence Argued</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CONROE, Texas
</DL>
<LD>A convicted killer whose death sentence was twice overturned by the
U.S. Supreme Court is competent to stand trial despite IQ tests showing
he may be mildly mentally retarded, prosecutors said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Johnny Paul Penry, 45, has spent half his life locked up for the fatal
stabbing of Pamela Moseley Carpenter in 1979 at her home in Livingston.</LD>
<LD>   The Supreme Court overturned his sentence most recently in June. Both
times, the court said jurors were not given sufficient instructions on
how to weigh his mental condition when they decided punishment.</LD>
<TE>   As testimony began Wednesday in a competence hearing, the prosecution
characterized Penry as a psychopath and manipulator.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the whole picture, not just the IQ tests. His IQ tests are
jumping all over the place," Dist. Atty. Joe Price told jurors in opening
remarks. "It doesn't mean he has to be a rocket scientist. If you took
away his criminal functions, he could survive in society."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney John Wright, though, likened Penry to a 6- or
7-year-old. "People are understandably skeptical when someone suggests
some kind of mental impairment," he said. "The state will say he's faking
it. Obviously, he's not."</TE>
<TE>   If the jury finds Penry competent, a sentencing trial will be held at
which he could be resentenced to death or given a life term.</TE>
<TE>   Death penalty opponents point to Penry, who says he believes in Santa
Claus and likes coloring books, as a reason why Texas should prohibit
executions of the mentally retarded. A bill approved by the Texas
Legislature last year to ban such punishment was vetoed by Gov. Rick
Perry.</TE>
<TE>   Penry's IQ has been measured as high as 63, seven points below the
threshold set by the Supreme Court for retardation.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Sheila Reed, a psychologist at Vernon State Hospital hired by the
defense, testified Wednesday that her assessments showed Penry is mildly
retarded and suffers from brain damage.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Angel Finley's Wife Is Charged</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actress Tawny Kitaen Finley was charged Wednesday with injuring her
husband, former Anaheim Angels pitcher Chuck Finley, during an
argument this week.</LD>
<LD>   The couple were driving to their Newport Beach home from dinner
Monday evening when Kitaen Finley allegedly began kicking her husband
with high-heeled shoes, said Tori Richards, spokeswoman for the
Orange County district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Kitaen Finley then grabbed her husband's ear and pushed his foot
while it was on the car's gas pedal, Richards said.</LD>
<TE>   Finley was able to wrestle free and get home safely, but the
argument continued. A third party called 911. When police arrived
they saw Finley was scraped and arrested Kitaen Finley, Richards
said.</TE>
<TE>   Kitaen Finley, who has appeared in numerous television programs,
including "Hercules" and "America's Funniest People," spent two days
in jail.</TE>
<TE>   A judge on Wednesday ordered her released on her own recognizance.
The judge also issued a restraining order requiring that she stay
away from her husband, Richards said.</TE>
<TE>   Kitaen Finley is scheduled to be back in court April 29, when she
will face two misdemeanor charges of inflicting corporal injury and
battery.</TE>
<TE>   Finley now plays for the Cleveland Indians.</TE>

<HD>Laguna Woods Backs an El Toro Road Trail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a move that could give senior citizens more mobility to reach
shopping malls and other attractions by foot, bicycle and possibly
golf cart, the Laguna Woods City Council on Wednesday approved, in
concept, a 2.5-mile trail parallel to El Toro Road.</LD>
<LD>   City officials said the trail would be the first of its kind in
Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   "When seniors have to give up their [driver's] licenses it takes
away their independence," said Brenda R. Ross, 86, one of three
members of the five-seat council who voted for the trail. "I'm in
favor of anything that keeps a senior independent and able to
function." The average age of Laguna Woods' residents is 78.</LD>
<TE>   Councilman Bert Hack, 72, said he voted against the project out of
concern for safety and liability.</TE>
<TE>   "When you mix people whose eyesight has become marginal and whose
reflexes have slowed with high-speed traffic, it may be a recipe for
problems," he said. "I'm not opposed to it, I just would like to have
seen a legal analysis before we approved the concept. We are entering
uncharted water."</TE>
<TE>   Under the resolution approved, City Manager Leslie Keane said,
city staff will proceed with design work on initial portions of the
trail. The city also will study liability issues and begin looking
for ways to pay for the trail, projected to cost $2 million. "We will
be seeking grant funding for the majority of it," Keane said.</TE>

<HD>Runaway, 13, Is Found Safe With Man She Met on Internet</HD>

<LD>A Panorama City runaway was found safe in Arizona on Wednesday, two
days after she set off for North Carolina with a man she met on the
Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Cheyenne Simmons, 13, was taken into protective custody after
authorities found her at a truck stop near Tombstone.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Allan Hulst, 25, of Jacksonville, N.C., was arrested and
could face federal charges of transporting a minor across state
lines, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   Hulst had told friends he hoped to marry Cheyenne and headed west
last week to get her. She was discovered missing early Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Cheyenne and Hulst were located after someone who had seen
nationwide broadcasts about the missing girl spotted Hulst's white
van and called police.</TE>
<TE>   The two had been communicating since September by computer and
telephone, said her guardian Mary Gallegoes, who recently found a
phone bill for $480 under Cheyenne's mattress.</TE>
<TE>   ''I want to warn parents,'' Gallegoes said, ''that if you think
your child is just on a little kid's Web site, you need to wake up.
This has been ... sheer terror and fear because of the horror stories
we hear over and over about what can happen because of the
Internet.''</TE>

<HD>Warning on Scam Is Issued</HD>
<DH>Crime: Letter and e-mail appeals for cash mention the
Nigerian government or businesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Secret Service and local police agencies issued warnings
Wednesday about a fraud scheme that allegedly offers money-making
opportunities through the Nigerian government or Nigerian businesses.</LD>
<LD>   A Secret Service spokesman said that while the scheme is more than
10 years old, there has been more activity recently. Typically,
letters or e-mails are sent offering high returns--in some instances,
$15 million, police said--in exchange for an upfront investment.
"There's just an ongoing flood of these letters," said Secret Service
Agent Robert Brenner, who is based in Santa Ana. "They'll try to get
people to put money upfront to help them launder some money out of
the country. It's a greedy type of teaser to get people to invest.
More often than not, the people victimized are elderly."</LD>
<LD>   Brenner said the Secret Service has opened an office in Lagos,
Nigeria, to help track down the people behind the scam. He said
Orange County has always been a big draw for scam artists "because of
the affluency."</LD>
<TE>   Garden Grove police also issued a citywide warning about the scam
after several city employees and other residents were contacted. Lt.
Scott Hamilton said his wife, a real estate agent, was approached by
e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   "They said some oil people in Nigeria had $23 million and they
wanted to invest in some property over here," Hamilton said. "They
wanted to use her as a Realtor, and they asked her to front $3,500 to
get the process rolling."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who believes that they have been targeted in the scheme
should contact local authorities or the Secret Service. To see
samples of the various letters used in the scheme, go online to

<HD>UCI to Seek New Business School Dean</HD>
<DH>Education: University opts not to renew David Blake's
contract as faculty criticizes, rankings fall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the Graduate School of Management's ranking falling and faculty
complaining about management and fund-raising, UC Irvine has decided
not to renew the contract of its dean of four years, David Blake.</LD>
<LD>   Ten of the school's 20 full professors signed a letter to the
administration expressing their dissatisfaction with Blake's
leadership.</LD>
<LD>   In an e-mail to faculty last month announcing the administration's
decision, Blake acknowledged the role professors played in his
ouster.</LD>
<TE>   "My understanding is that some senior faculty expressed
significant concern about our school's goals and strategies for
achieving growth and critical mass.... It was felt that these
concerns warranted seeking a different dean."</TE>
<TE>   Blake, 61, remains a tenured professor and said he looks forward
to a return to the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he has received an offer from private industry to
help foster technology-generated companies. He declined to provide
details.</TE>
<TE>   An interim dean will take over this summer. The search for a
replacement could take a year.</TE>
<TE>   Blake came to UCI in 1997 after serving seven years as dean of the
business school at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. An expert
in international business, he also has been a dean and administrator
at Rutgers, Northeastern and the University of Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   UCI deans are appointed for five-year terms. Toward the end of
that time, they are reviewed by a committee of faculty and
administrators, which makes a recommendation to the chancellor.</TE>
<TE>   Chancellor Ralph J. Cicerone was traveling and could not be
reached for comment Wednesday. In a recent letter to management
school supporters, Cicerone tried to reassure them about Blake's
stewardship and the future.</TE>
<TE>   "During this five-year period, GSM has grown substantially in its
faculty, enrollment, student quality and stature as a business
school. As we approach the process of recruiting a new dean, I want
to assure you of UCI's ongoing priority to build GSM into a top-tier
business school."</TE>
<TE>   Professors blamed Blake for a fall in the increasingly important
rankings a number of publications put out. The Financial Times, for
instance, dropped the school of management from 22nd to 38th to 64th
in the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a dean to create value for the school," said finance
professor Neal Stoughton, one of those who signed the letter, "and
[Blake] really didn't fulfill those requirements."</TE>
<TE>   Associate professor Peter Navarro said Blake did a poor job of
marketing, leading to fewer applicants and lower board scores, which
lowered the school's ranking.</TE>
<TE>   Navarro remained optimistic about the graduate school's future.
"The school's in good shape because we have this core of faculty that
have been around for a long time," he said. "We just don't have a
good administrator."</TE>
<TE>   Blake said the school of management has 250 to 300 more students
than when he took over.</TE>
<TE>   He said that like other business schools, UCI has had to make its
way through the dot-com boom--when applicants figured they could get
rich on stock options and didn't need an MBA--to the dot-com bust and
the recession, which has pushed up applications by 35%.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles City Councilman Tom LaBonge proposed Wednesday that 75%
of business taxes collected through a new crackdown on scofflaws be
devoted to reforms, including possible rate reductions and tax code
simplifications.</LD>
<LD>   As a result of a new state law, the city can learn the identity of
all Los Angeles companies paying state taxes, information that can be
cross-checked with city tax rolls to determine which companies are
not paying required city taxes.</LD>
<LD>   The resulting crackdown is expected to produce at least $8 million
a year. The motion will be considered by the City Council.</LD>

<HD>Juvenile Facility's Security Criticized</HD>
<DH>Sylmar: County probation chief faults staff and equipment
failures for the escape of a 17-year-old detainee last month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A county review of an escape last month at a Sylmar juvenile hall has
found a range of security lapses at the detention center, including
the staff's failure to quickly alert authorities that the 17-year-old
had scaled a wall.</LD>
<LD>   Kenneth Gilliam, who was convicted of three counts of attempted
murder and was awaiting sentencing, is still at large. He escaped
March 10 by breaking his dorm room window with the ball of a computer
mouse and then climbing over the 16-foot wall.</LD>
<LD>   In a five-page report to the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors, Chief Probation Officer Richard Shumsky said it took the
staff of Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall 20 minutes to notify
authorities of the escape. The report was released Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Shumsky's review spotlighted security problems beyond the
circumstances of the escape. It found that the hall did not house
violent detainees in more secure quarters until last month.</TE>
<TE>   The report, dated March 28, also said that improperly installed
door locks and an inoperable gate allowed Gilliam to escape. The hall
is repairing and replacing the faulty equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The report recommended more inspections of doors, gates, walls and
fencing, and closer monitoring of tools and equipment that could be
used in an escape. It said computer mouses should be glued so the
metal ball cannot be removed.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, staff members complained that detainees who assault
probation officers are not brought up on additional criminal charges.
The report did not address that complaint, and Shumsky could not be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Gilliam was the second detainee to escape from the hall in as many
months. There have been eight other escape attempts in the last three
years, officials said. The hall holds about 550 minors.</TE>

<HD>Camarillo Pushes for Bigger Library</HD>
<DH>City services: Talks are underway to buy 10 acres of
farmland on Las Posas Road for the $20-million project. State funding
may cover part of costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZIE ST. JOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of Camarillo is moving ahead with plans to construct a
$20-million public library on the last plot of undeveloped land on
Las Posas Road.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant City Manager Larry Davis said negotiations are underway
for the city to purchase 10 acres of farmland between Fieldgate Drive
and Lewis Road. Strawberries are grown on the site.</LD>
<LD>   "We are in the appraisal mode right now," Davis said. "No price
has been mentioned by either party yet."</LD>
<TE>   The parcel is owned by Ohio Teachers Retirement group. A
spokesperson for the organization could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The location was one of 18 that the city was considering for the
proposed 65,000-square-foot library. The alternate sites included
both previously developed plots and other farmland.</TE>
<TE>   "All were in the center part of town, but this one stood out
because it was the most accessible to everyone," said Bob Burrow, the
city's director of community development. "It's near other public
facilities, it's an adequate size and there were no major
restrictions to overcome."</TE>
<TE>   Sandwiched between two churches, the property is also close to the
local sheriff's station, St. John's Pleasant Valley Hospital and a
large residential area, including three new developments on Flynn
Road that also used to be farmland.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still a lot of land in Camarillo and in the county that's
very productive in agriculture," Davis responded when asked about the
area's diminishing farmland. "But sometimes public needs and benefits
are moved to the forefront."</TE>
<TE>   The need for a new library was brought to light two years ago when
the city hired San Francisco library consultant Kathy Page to do an
assessment for Camarillo after passage of Proposition 14, a statewide
bond measure that has generated $350 million for the construction of
libraries.</TE>
<TE>   "It was determined that we are a very undersized library for our
community," said Sandi Banks, Camarillo's library manager.</TE>
<TE>   The current facility on Ponderosa Drive was built in 1974 and is
15,000 square feet. The new library would be more than four times
that size. Plans for the facility include a large children's section
with a storytelling room, a concession area, a community room and a
bookstore.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all very exciting," Banks said. "It will be so nice to have
so much space. We're really very crowded now."</TE>
<TE>   Architect Stephen Finney of the Glendale-based firm of Charles
Walton and Associates showed residents preliminary designs for the
new building Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The drawings were very favorably received," Finney said.</TE>
<TE>   "The City Council had already given us the direction to design the
library in a more traditional Spanish colonial scheme and there was
only one dissenter in the group who wanted something more modern
looking."</TE>
<TE>   With the designs in the works and a site selected, the only
remaining obstacle is money. The city plans to submit its application
for a share of the state bond money in June. Davis said the project's
environmental impact report was completed this week and will be
forwarded to the City Council for certification April 24.</TE>
<TE>   The city expects to know by year's end if it qualifies for the
state funding, which would cover 60% of the total cost. Camarillo
would pay the remainder.</TE>
<TE>   "The city's portion will come from the city's general fund and
hopefully the county will kick in some funds," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the bond is approved, it will be six to eight months for the
architects to finish their drawings. Hopefully we can start building
in January 2004."</TE>

<HD>Thousand Oaks Sued Over Land-Swap Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Thousand Oaks Planning Commission chairman is suing the city
over his concerns about a recently approved land-swap deal with
developers, a move that could jeopardize construction of a
$3.4-million public equestrian center.</LD>
<LD>   In the lawsuit filed this week in Ventura County Superior Court,
Michael Farris argues the City Council cannot change the land
designation on a nine-acre parcel near the Santa Monica Mountains
without voter approval.</LD>
<LD>   City officials disagree and say the case is without merit.</LD>
<TE>   Farris was ousted from the commission seven weeks ago after
raising similar concerns. Three of five council members accused him
of stalling the land swap merely to protect a politically ally.</TE>
<TE>   If Farris' lawsuit is successful, developer Operating Engineers
Pension Trust would need voter approval to build three luxury homes
on the parcel.</TE>
<TE>   Farris said there is more at stake than three homes. By extending
water and electric service south of Potrero Road, he maintains, the
city invites hundreds more houses at the edge of federal parkland.</TE>
<TE>   Farris, who plans to run for a council seat in November, said
Wednesday that he expects to draw heat over the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The city agreed in February to let Operating Engineers build on
the nine acres known as Site I. That was part of negotiations giving
three developers rights to build hundreds of homes in exchange for
preserving 191 acres known as the Western Plateau in Newbury Park.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, Site I was to become a private equestrian center. In
exchange for the right to build luxury homes, the developer promised
$2.5 million toward city plans for a $3.4-million public equestrian
facility at another location.</TE>
<TE>   Before the vote, Councilwoman Linda Parks questioned the city's
ability to change Site I's designation. In 1996, the city passed an
ordinance requiring voter approval to build on parkland. Some city
color-coded maps indicated Site I fell under that designation.</TE>
<TE>   Farris and another planning commissioner, Nora Aidukas, delayed a
recommendation on the Western Plateau deal, saying they shared Parks'
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' critics said Farris and Aidukas wanted to keep the matter
from the City Council until after the March 5 election, because Parks
was locked in a tight race for county supervisor, which she won. The
council voted 3 to 2 to oust the two and moved the issue along.</TE>
<TE>   City planners and lawyers said the land use maps contained a
printing error and that while Site I had once been considered for
parkland it was never approved as such. The city had since corrected
the error and argued that the incorrect maps were not binding
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Though the lawsuit does not jeopardize the land preservation plan,
it does threaten the equestrian center's financing.</TE>
<TE>   "Operating Engineers would be under no obligation to provide $2.5
million if they don't receive the benefit of the bargain, which is
three single-family homes," said Deputy City Manager Jim Friedl.</TE>

<HD>Road Project Is End of Line for Mobile Homes</HD>
<DH>Construction: Oxnard's realignment of Rice Avenue at the
Ventura Freeway is forcing 77 park residents and others to begin
making plans to relocate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN F. SHERRY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seventy-seven residents of an Oxnard mobile home park will be
displaced by a $33.9-million city project to realign Rice Avenue
where it intersects with the Ventura Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   The construction, which also will force the relocation of a dozen
businesses and two single-family homes, is expected to begin by
mid-2003 and take 12 to 18 months to complete, said Cynthia Daniels,
Oxnard's senior project coordinator.</LD>
<LD>   Teresa Galvan, who lives in Owl Mobile Home Park with her husband,
Jose, and 6-year-old daughter Anabel, said it is just beginning to
sink in that her family will have to move. Jose is a lumberyard
employee and 20-year resident of the park. "In reality, we don't know
where we are going," she said in Spanish. "We don't know if it will
be an apartment, another trailer or what.</LD>
<TE>   "The people in our community want to stay together," she said. "We
are so happy to be close to our jobs and to our schools. It's not
something we want to change. Everybody likes each other."</TE>
<TE>   But the park residents have agreed to vacate the 18-space park in
exchange for financial and relocation assistance from the city.</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulations call for relocated people to be placed within
50 miles of their old homes. But the city has agreed to keep the
mobile park residents within five miles of the city limits. The
park's 33 school-aged children will remain in Rio Elementary School
District.</TE>
<TE>   "They would like the children to be able to continue in the same
school, if possible," said lawyer Jeannie Barrett of California Rural
Legal Assistance, which represents more than half of the residents,
who work a variety of low-paying jobs, from farm labor to
landscaping.</TE>
<TE>   The city also agreed to provide financial housing assistance to
qualified relocated residents beyond the 3 1/2 years that state and
federal laws require. Oxnard will hire a consultant to help the
displaced residents and businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty much accepted that their mobile homes are too old to
be relocated," Barrett said. Instead, the residents hope to move into
another mobile home park, condos or even houses, she said. "Nobody
wants an apartment," Barrett said. "They don't want to be in the
rental market. They're used to living in this really kind of tranquil
environment. They don't share walls or ceilings with anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Most residents at Owl Mobile Home Park have lived there for more
than 20 years. "We've got people who are on their second generation,"
said Barrett, adding that some residents have expressed a desire to
move somewhere together and continue being neighbors. "That is a big
deal to several of them," she said. "Those tended also to be the
people with kids. They essentially have a village raising their
children."</TE>
<TE>   Affected business owners, such as Marie Trujillo of A&amp;M Roadhouse
on Ventura Boulevard, hope the city comes up with a satisfactory
relocation package for them also. "It's going to be a little bit hard
to replace this," said Trujillo, who--with her son, Art--operates the
bar that faces the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Most owners have accepted that time in their present location is
limited, she said. "What can you do, you know?" Trujillo asked. "The
city made up its mind."</TE>
<TE>   Rice Avenue near the freeway is now a confusing jumble of
roads--motorists heading east on Ventura Boulevard, for instance,
find that once they reach Santa Clara Avenue they have no choice but
to make a U-turn onto the northbound Ventura Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "The intersection is not designed to handle traffic for the next
20 years," Daniels said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two men aboard a small plane told air traffic controllers Wednesday
night their aircraft was stuck in a tree in the Cleveland National
Forest, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The unidentified pilot called air traffic controllers in San Diego
about 9:05 p.m. to ask for help in getting out of the tree, said
Larri Dillard, a Federal Aviation Administration operations officer
in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The pilot of the single-engine Cessna 152 and a passenger were
stuck in a tree near Santiago Peak at about the 3,000-foot level,
said Capt. Ron Faulkner of the Riverside County Fire Department.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities told the men that darkness and incoming fog would
delay a rescue attempt until this morning. The men said they were not
injured and could wait until then, Faulkner said.</TE>
<TE>   ''They are very fortunate they are still alive,'' Faulkner said</TE>
<TE>   Deputies on the ground and aboard a helicopter searched late
Wednesday night for the plane, said Sgt. Shelley Kennedy-Smith of the
Riverside County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
