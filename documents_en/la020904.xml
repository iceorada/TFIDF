<DL></DL>
<LD>Harley-Davidson Inc. is warming up for its 100th birthday bash in
Milwaukee next year with a 10-city road tour that arrives Friday at
the California Speedway in Fontana.</LD>
<LD>   Based on crowds that showed at the first two stops, in Baltimore
and Atlanta, the three-day Southern California blowout is expected to
draw thousands of Harley riders and fans of the big bikes and the
Harley culture they have spawned.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to celebrating all things Harley-Davidson--there are
even children's events, including free rides on a plastic,
battery-powered mini-Harley three-wheeler made by toy giant
Fisher-Price Inc.--the festival includes a high-powered music lineup.</LD>
<TE>   Performances by Kid Rock, the Stone Temple Pilots, Doobie
Brothers, the Doors, Los Lobos, Billy Idol, Journey, George Clinton
and Parliament/Funkadelic and bluegrass banjo ace Earl Scruggs are
scheduled over the three nights of the festival.</TE>
<TE>   A quartet of 20,000-square-foot exhibit tents will house displays
of Harley-Davidson history, current products, Harley and pop culture,
and Harley-Davidson design and development. The latter tent includes
a display of 100 years of Harley-Davidson gas tanks, tracing design
and styling changes in the motorcycle maker's signature teardrop
tank.</TE>
<TE>   "We started planning for the 100th anniversary events the day
after we took down the tents from our 95th anniversary party," said
Bill Davidson, director of marketing and planning and a grandson of
company co-founder William A. Davidson.</TE>
<TE>   "The road tour is a way to bring the company out to our customers,
and to future customers," he said. "We are going to be showing things
from our archives that have never been seen by the general public
before."</TE>
<TE>   Tickets, available at the California Speedway, Ticketmaster or
online at www.harley-davidson.com, are $35 a day or $75 for all three
days. More events, page G2.</TE>

<HD>Dealer Wins Nissan 350Z EBay Auction With a $95,100 Bid</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Great Nissan Z Auction on EBay has ended, and the winning bid for
the first production model of the new 350Z, submitted by Everett,
Wash., Nissan dealer Hugh Hall, was $95,100. That's more than
two-and-a-half times the $37,000 value of the car, which carries
vehicle identification number 000001.</LD>
<LD>   Hall, who said a 240Z was his first car after he graduated from
college 23 years ago, won in a flurry of action that saw bids ratchet
up to $95,100 from $63,250 in the final 40 minutes of the auction.</LD>
<LD>   Nissan North America will donate proceeds of the sale to the
Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation.</LD>
<TE>   Exhaust Noise</TE>
<TE>   A bill to establish a statewide noise testing program for
aftermarket exhaust systems has been approved by the California
Assembly in a lopsided 68-8 vote.</TE>
<TE>   The measure, sponsored by the Specialty Equipment Market Assn.,
previously had passed the Senate on a 31-3 vote, but must be voted on
again in the upper house because of minor amendments in the Assembly
version.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would authorize state-licensed smog check stations to
issue certificates of compliance for vehicles with exhaust systems
that register no louder than 95 decibels under state-specified test
criteria.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also would allow courts to dismiss exhaust noise
citations when a car owner can show, by providing a certificate of
compliance, that the offending exhaust system meets state
requirements.</TE>
<TE>   The program would be paid for with fees collected for the tests
and compliance certificates.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama-Bound</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler says it will build a crossover sport wagon, the
GST, at its plant in Tuscaloosa, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   The factory, where the Mercedes M-Class sport utility vehicles now
are assembled, is undergoing a $600-million expansion to make room
for the wagon, which will debut as a 2004 model.</TE>
<TE>   Mercedes-Benz showed the GST as a concept car at the Detroit Auto
Show in January.</TE>
<TE>   Cobra Case</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge in Massachusetts has ruled that famed Cobra
builder Carroll Shelby cannot claim trademark protection for the
basic shape of the Cobra roadster he developed in 1962 and built
until 1967.</TE>
<TE>   Shelby, whose original Cobras now sell for $250,000 to $500,000,
said the decision "is just another bump in the road" in his 20-year
series of legal battles against scores of kit-car makers that sell
replicas of the Cobra roadster body along with components of varying
authenticity that buyers can put together for a "replicar" at a cost
far less than the original.</TE>
<TE>   He filed suit against one such replica maker, Superformance
International Inc., in December, alleging that the company's cars
infringed his designs.</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleged infringement of trade dress, a form of trademark
used in design cases. Superformance, based in Newport News, Va.,
asked the court to dismiss Shelby's claims without a trial.</TE>
<TE>   In a decision handed down last month, U.S. District Judge Rya W.
Zobel granted the replica maker's request, ruling that Shelby failed
to prove that he is viewed by the public as the sole source of the
Cobra.</TE>
<TE>   Shelby, however, said he viewed the ruling as encouraging, because
it does acknowledge that he created the original Cobra and that
companies such as Superformance are deliberately copying the design.</TE>
<TE>   Superformance, which has stopped using references to Shelby and
Cobra in its advertising, pointed out it in its court filing that the
original Cobra used a body designed and built by a British company,
AC Cars. And AC has given Superformance permission to copy them, said
the replica maker's Irvine-based attorney, Lynda Zadra-Symes.</TE>
<TE>   Zobel said although many people equate Shelby with the Cobra, Ford
Motor Co. owned the Cobra name and marketed many Cobra vehicles and
is viewed by many consumers as the actual producer.</TE>
<TE>   A similar claim by Ford against Superformance, alleging trademark
counterfeiting, was rejected in the same decision.</TE>

<HD>Driving in Tighter Circles</HD>
<DH>Four-wheel steering system is a breakthrough that helps in
maneuvering long trucks</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVEN COLE SMITH</AU>
<BD>ORLANDO SENTINEL</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's no argument: The most popular vehicle in America is the
pickup truck. The perennial top seller is the Ford F-150, followed by
the Chevrolet Silverado. But driving trucks has drawbacks, not the
least of which is the fact that they are long and not particularly
easy to maneuver.</LD>
<LD>   New technology is changing that. Like a lot of new technology,
it's expensive, but how much would it be worth to you to make an
extended-cab pickup, with an overall length of 227.7 inches, turn in
the same space required by a Saturn sedan, which is just 178.1 inches
long?</LD>
<LD>   That's exactly what Delphi Corp.'s Quadrasteer does for the 2002
GMC Sierra Denali pickup. The Denali, probably the most deluxe pickup
truck available, sells for $44,105, and right now, it's the only
vehicle on the market with Quadrasteer.</LD>
<TE>   That will change. General Motors has a two-year exclusive deal
with Delphi for use of the Quadrasteer system and is adding it to six
more trucks and SUVs next year. After that, well, Delphi says it is
in serious negotiations with a number of truck makers. Quadrasteer
revives an idea that Honda and a few other manufacturers tried, but
failed to popularize, in the late 1980s and early 1990s: four-wheel
steering, meaning that the rear wheels steer to help out the front
wheels. If you are turning left, for instance, the rear wheels turn
just slightly to the right, to swing the rear end around the corner.</TE>
<TE>   But when Honda Motor introduced four-wheel steering on the 1988
Prelude, the difference was not dramatic. The Prelude already was a
small car with very good handling, and although you could tell that
the four-wheel steering was working, tests suggested that it did not
improve lap times on a racetrack over a regular Prelude.</TE>
<TE>   And because the Prelude was no problem to park anyway, the extra
cost and complexity just wasn't worth it. Honda dropped the
four-wheel steering option in 1994, and few noticed. Various forms of
four-wheel steering came and went with other manufacturers, including
Nissan, Mazda and Mitsubishi.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Delphi, a technology company that used to be a part of
General Motors but was spun off on its own, retaining GM as its
largest customer. Delphi figured that four-wheel steering was a good
idea for trucks, not cars.</TE>
<TE>   On the Denali, four-wheel steering reduces the turning circle (the
diameter of a circle made when a vehicle is turning with the steering
wheel cranked all the way to one side) by 21%, down to just over 37
feet. That's the same as the smallest Saturn.</TE>
<TE>   And it's a noticeable difference. Make a sharp right turn at an
intersection from a narrow road, and the rear wheel doesn't jump over
the curb. Parallel park, and the Denali feels like it is a much
shorter vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest difference is in towing.</TE>
<TE>   At the introduction of Quadrasteer technology at an event in
Detroit, GMC laid out a very tight course in a big parking lot,
lining the course with pylons. Journalists had the chance to drive
the course with the Quadrasteer on, and with it off (a
dashboard-mounted switch allows you to turn the feature off).</TE>
<TE>   With the system off, everyone who drove the course took out
several of the plastic pylons. With Quadrasteer on, navigating was no
problem, even for those who had never before towed a trailer.</TE>
<TE>   "The impact that four-wheel steering has is enormous," said Sam
Mancuso, marketing director for the GMC Sierra and Yukon brands. "It
changes the entire driving dynamics."</TE>
<TE>   It's a fairly simple system to understand, but an exceptionally
complex system to design. The front wheels use regular hydraulic
power steering, but the rear wheels steer using a big electric motor,
one at each wheel.</TE>
<TE>   Delphi could use regular hydraulic steering, but the electric
motors operate much faster. With hydraulics, there would be a delay
from the time you turn the steering wheel to the time the rear wheels
get the message.</TE>
<TE>   At very low speeds, the rear wheels steer in the opposite
direction as the front wheels, helping to swing the rear around. At
higher speeds, the rear wheels steer in the same direction as the
front wheels, aiding lane changes.</TE>
<TE>   All this rear steering is not nearly as severe as the front
steering. When you turn the steering wheel from side to side while
stopped, you can see the rear wheels steer slightly, never more than
a 12-degree angle, far less than the front wheels can turn. But it
doesn't take much to make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   The downside: extra weight, cost and complexity. The rear fenders
of the Denali are flared slightly, to make room for the wheels to
steer. But otherwise, this is "transparent technology"--stuff that
works, and works well, but otherwise calls no attention to itself.</TE>
<TE>   For 2003, GMC and Chevrolet are making Quadrasteer available on
less expensive extended cab and some crew cab pickups, and even on
the heavy-duty version of the Suburban and Yukon SUVs. Pricing ranges
from an extra $4,495 to $6,695 for a Quadrasteer package that
includes other upgrades.</TE>
<TE>   Is it worth it? If you need a big truck to tow trailers often, or
if you have to negotiate tight roads and parking lots, yes. It's a
genuine breakthrough.</TE>

<HD>Coalition Targets Youths' ATV Use</HD>
<DH>A surge in vehicle-related fatalities and injuries among
children prompts the call for new rules and a federal inquiry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNE WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last Thanksgiving, when more than 240,000 people arrived for a
weekend of camping, partying and riding dune buggies and all-terrain
vehicles at the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area near El Centro,
Calif., the emergency room at Pioneer Memorial Hospital was swamped.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a madhouse," said Dr. Michael Berger, director of the
hospital's emergency department.</LD>
<LD>   Close to 160 patients a day--most of them injured in ATV- related
accidents--flooded the small hospital in Brawley, he said.</LD>
<TE>   "Beer, gasoline and ATVs" are a dangerous mix, Berger said. "I've
seen so many severe traumas and injuries that it's all a blur."</TE>
<TE>   Amid the stream of broken bones, scrapes and head injuries that
holiday weekend, Berger recalls the death of a child who was riding
on the back of an ATV driven by his father. The father suffered a
broken collarbone; the little boy, a broken neck.</TE>
<TE>   Troubled by the surge of ATV- related injuries and deaths of
children, a coalition of medical, consumer and environmental groups
is calling for a federal inquiry into ATV safety.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition has called on the government to prohibit children
younger than 16 from riding powerful full-size models of the
four-wheeled, motorcycle-derived vehicles. The member groups also
advocate federal or state training and licensing standards for all
ATV users.</TE>
<TE>   Most injuries to children riding ATVs occur on adult-size models,
a recent study by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission
determined.</TE>
<TE>   Some members of the coalition, including the Consumer Federation
of America and the American Academy of Pediatrics, say they would
prefer a rule that goes further, barring children under 16 even from
so-called child-size ATVs.</TE>
<TE>   ATV enthusiasts and industry representatives oppose such
regulations. They maintain that most drivers engage in safe and
responsible use of the vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Elisabeth Piper, director of corporate affairs for the Specialty
Vehicle Institute of America, an ATV trade group, blames accidents on
a minority of users who disregard safety rules and allow their
children to drive or ride adult-size ATVs.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't believe children should be riding adult vehicles," Piper
said. Her group urges ATV buyers to attend its free training programs
and to restrict their children to riding the less powerful ATVs
designed for young riders.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Piper said, only about 25% of all new buyers of
ATVs in the U.S. take advantage of the training sessions.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 20 years, there have been 4,541 ATV-related deaths
nationwide, the Consumer Product Safety Commission report said.
California, a major ATV market, led the nation with 278 of those
fatalities.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers have risen each year, the commission found, as the
popularity of ATV riding has skyrocketed. Annual sales of ATVs jumped
from 368,000 in 1997 to 825,000 in 2001 and are continuing to climb
this year, the commission said. As many as 7 million ATVs are in use
today, according to the Natural Trails and Waters Coalition, which
works to protect public lands and waters from damage caused by
off-road vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly disturbing is that 38% of those killed in ATV
accidents have been children younger than 16. More than 800 of those
children, 18% of the total ATV deaths, were under 12.</TE>
<TE>   Last year alone, nearly 35,000 youngsters under 16 received
emergency treatment for ATV- related injuries, said Dr. Gary Smith,
director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Children's
Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, one of the organizations petitioning the
product safety commission for tougher ATV regulations.</TE>
<TE>   All new ATVs are four-wheeled vehicles. The less-stable,
three-wheeled models haven't been marketed since the late 1980s, when
they were associated with a increase in injuries. But three-wheeled
ATVs remain in use.</TE>
<TE>   The safety coalition wants ATV makers to buy back those
three-wheelers and to offer refunds to people who bought full-size
ATVs for use by children under 16.</TE>
<TE>   "Self-regulation by the ATV industry has led to larger and faster
ATVs and more children being killed and injured," said Rachel
Weintraub, a lawyer for the Consumer Federation of America.</TE>
<TE>   There was a time when the Consumer Product Safety Commission
regulated the ATV industry. The industry challenged the commission's
authority in a lawsuit that resulted in the production ban on
three-wheeled vehicles and ended the regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the safety coalition contend that because ATVs
today are faster (some can travel 75 mph) and bigger (weighing up to
550 pounds), they can be difficult for children to control.</TE>
<TE>   But physician Berger and others also blame the use of alcohol and
a lack of parental supervision for the increase in accidents. Even
industry representatives stress that parents must require their
children to wear proper safety gear and allow them to drive or ride
on only ATVs designed for them.</TE>
<TE>   The sport certainly has become a family activity. But it can be
risky, and parents need to be cautious, Berger advised.</TE>
<TE>   More than once, he said, he has had children being treated in the
emergency room tell him confidentially, when their parents were out
of sight, that they didn't want to ride the vehicles again.</TE>

African-inspired line with bold splashes of denim</DH>

<LD>An oppressive heat hung over the garden of the official residence of
France, but a cheery French Consul General Jean-Luc Sibiude
graciously greeted guests who cooled down with chilled Pommery
Champagne, icy Perrier water or iced tea as they waited for the debut
of the first ready-to-wear line of Los Angeles designer Ahneva Ahneva
.</LD>
<LD>   Best known for her one-of-a-kind, hand-sewn creations that mix
African fabrics with silk, wool and other hand-crafted materials, she
worked in denim for the first time, mixing it with African textiles,
metallic fabrics and faux fur. After 20 years of doing clothes
distinguished as wearable art, "I am ready for the next level," said
the designer, who works out of a showroom in Leimert Park.</LD>
<LD>   Sibiude, whom she met during the Pan African Film Festival in
February, opened his Beverly Hills home to her fashion show Sunday,
where models proved they could control their sweat glands as well as
facial expressions. Models sauntered around white tables canopied
with umbrellas that provided guests with a smidgen of shady respite
from the ultra-humid, 103-degree temperature.</LD>
<TE>   One model, who had to be the hottest person there, looked
appropriately sang-froid in an ankle-length denim coat trimmed with a
huge faux-fur collar over a long denim dress with vertical appliques
of diamond-shaped mud cloth. Ahneva's preference for gold zebra
stripes dominated the show.</TE>
<TE>   Models strolled about in yoked denim jackets topping long skirts
with side slits cut to above the thigh. Ahneva paired an elegant
denim jacket with a long, full matching skirt decorated with pyramid
inserts of patterned denim. She pronounced it "fit for a South
African Zulu queen." When the single male model, a chiseled ebony
Adonis known only as "Charcoal" snatched open the jacket of his denim
outfit revealing washboard abs, Congresswoman Diane Watson (D-L.A.)
murmured, "He looks like a Masai warrior, doesn't he?"</TE>
<TE>   Along with her new QAA denim line, Ahneva previewed her "cultural"
couture collection of silk chiffons and velvets. "We have all these
models who are sizes 4, 6, and 8; I'm a mature woman," she said,
introducing a full-figured model in a formal black burnt velvet
tuxedo dress with a silk satin lapel and scallop train. Prices for
the denim line range from $85 to $450, couture $125 to $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Her couture designs were evident throughout the crowd. The consul
general wore her black linen, double-breasted shirt with a neutral
pinstripe over a pair of black baggy pants. "Fashion is part of the
French culture. France shares a long tradition with Africa," Sibiude
explained, referring to the legacy of French colonization. "This is a
kind of a cultural exchange between France, America and Africa."</TE>
<TE>   Apres fashion, he, Ahneva and her guests nibbled French breads,
turkey, ratatouille froide (cold), a salad of green and yellow beans
spiced with fresh herbs including tarragon, a penne pasta salad with
dried apricots, olives and other ingredients, prepared by the consul
general's personal Parisian chef Gerald Brassoud, and followed by his
desserts served on Limoges china, delicate cream puffs, perfect apple
tarts, miniature chocolate raspberry tartlets, cake avec fruits, that
looked and tasted nothing like American fruit cake, and a beautiful
salade de fruits rouge; translation: a luscious minted strawberry and
raspberry fruit salad.</TE>
<TE>   As the French say, "Il faisait trop chaud."</TE>
<TE>   It was too hot.</TE>

<HD>How Will They Observe the Other Events of Sept. 11?</HD>
<DH>Some change celebration dates; others accept sadness as
part of birthday or anniversary</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the morning of Sept. 11 last year, her 19th wedding anniversary,
Chris Spencer arose in San Diego, kissed her husband, made breakfast
for their four children and turned on the news. At first she thought
she'd tuned in to a movie by mistake. When all channels showed the
same thing, she understood.</LD>
<LD>   She knew right then that there could be no celebration that night.
And not on that date ever again.</LD>
<LD>   "What happened on 9/11 was too horrible. We didn't want that date
as our anniversary anymore," she says. "We decided to change it by
marrying each other again. We'd send the same invitations to the same
people but arrange it for a different date."</LD>
<TE>   Of course, there have been infamous days throughout history. The
day the Titanic sank, the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Kennedy and
Martin Luther King Jr. assassinations, to name a few. Each have been
strangely horrible and wonderful for people whose happiest occasions
occurred on those dates. The question for them: Is it wise--or even
possible--to rewrite personal history in order to snub fate?</TE>
<TE>   In this age when wrinkles can be erased, hair can be replaced and
anxiety removed with a pill, what could be wrong with simply revising
the anniversary of a joyous occasion? Especially if the original
date, such as Sept. 11, has become shorthand for tragedy. Many find
nothing wrong with that at all.</TE>
<TE>   Others might argue that reality rules, that imperfection is
inherent in every person, thing and plan--that when it pops up to mar
the physical or spiritual it must be embraced and acknowledged. What
is, is. There is no way to un-write history.</TE>
<TE>   The Spencers say they discussed such things in the months after
Sept. 11. "As time passed, we just kept thinking that our 20th
anniversary was coming up, that it would be such a joyous landmark
for our family. Yet we were both so deeply saddened and affected by
what happened at the twin towers that we knew it would diminish the
joy of any celebration," Spencer says.</TE>
<TE>   Spencer, 46, describes herself as "a romantic and a CPA." She
works from an office at home so she can keep an eye on the children,
an 11-year-old, a 7-year-old and 2-year-old twins. Her husband, Dan,
50, is a sales executive. The decision to renew their vows on a
different date was not superficial or frivolous, Chris says. It was a
reflection of how deeply committed they are to each other, and how
sincerely sorrowful they are about the tragedy. They felt it would be
impossible for them to express both those emotions on a single day.
And, unlike a birthday, it was an event whose date could be
changed--just by doing it over.</TE>
<TE>   They consulted their pastor, Kathleen Richter, of Tierrasanta
Lutheran church in San Diego. "She thought it was a wonderful idea,"
Spencer says.</TE>
<TE>   She found the names of the 99 original wedding guests and
reprinted an original invitation, which included Shakespeare's Sonnet
116 in its entirety.</TE>
<TE>   It begins: "Let us not to the marriage of true minds admit
impediments/Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds
... "</TE>
<TE>   The Spencers' big problem was finding a time when all the family
and friends could attend. "We tried four successive dates; none
worked until we hit on Aug. 10," one month and one day earlier than
their ceremony 20 years before.</TE>
<TE>   The replay took place on a Saturday, and "it was the most
wonderful event," Spencer recalls in a phone conversation. "When we
first said our vows years ago, we sailed through them beautifully.
This time, all the emotion that came from 20 years of being together,
from having our four children there with us, from the experience of
Sept. 11, and from seeing our relatives gathered after so many
years--it turned out to be much more emotional than the first time.
We both stumbled through our words. We both started to laugh. We
acted like newlyweds."</TE>
<TE>   And with a second wedding comes, of course, a second honeymoon.
Their four days at Rancho La Puerta in Tecate, Mexico, was so
memorable that Spencer couldn't find the right descriptive words:
"Wonderful, tremendous .... " Her voice trailed off in awe.</TE>
<TE>   The day after their return, Dan's brother, Jeffrey, who was 45 and
had never been sick, died suddenly and unexpectedly of heart failure.
"We went from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows," Dan says.
He left a wife, and two children, ages 10 and 2.</TE>
<TE>   Now, just a few weeks later, Chris says she and her husband
realize they have another reason to feel "happy and thankful" they
renewed their vows when they did. Had they waited for their original
anniversary date, Dan's brother would not have been with them. "At
least he saw the whole family together one more time, and they got to
see him. We all had such a happy time before this awful thing."</TE>
<TE>   Among the Spencers' good friends is a Lemon Grove couple who also
married Sept. 11, one year after they did, in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Judy and John Fergus, 53 and 60, were in Las Vegas for their 18th
anniversary on Sept. 11 last year. "We wanted to go home immediately
but couldn't get transportation. After hours of watching events on
TV, "my husband and I decided to get out of our room. We went into
the casino, and everybody was holding hands, singing 'God Bless
America.' People from all over the world, none of whom knew each
other. They were all consoling each other. If you started crying,
someone came up and hugged you. People held onto each other. I felt
so much compassion flowing.</TE>
<TE>   "When I think back on it, so many people's arms were around me
whose names I will never know. For such a terrible day, it was a
wonderful place to be. Everybody reached out and took care of
everybody else."</TE>
<TE>   When her friends the Spencers said they were changing their
anniversary date, she and her husband discussed the idea. "We both
felt that this was the day we married and we cannot change history.
That day is where our memories are--and those memories won't be
erased even though something awful occurred on the same day. I think
you can mix the good memories with the bad. We chose not to change
our date. In fact, we decided it was important to keep it."</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11, 2001, was the day that Julie and Michael Kunkel, of Lake
Ann, Mich., had selected for the induced birth of their child. "We
were in the hospital room, watching TV, when the planes started
hitting the buildings. The hospital was in chaos. Nurses ran in and
out, trying to watch TV as they worked. The doctors all looked
disturbed. Our daughter was born in the afternoon, and the day's
events definitely gave us something to think about other than what we
were going through."</TE>
<TE>   Julie, 30, teaches high school; Michael, 31, sells insurance.
Their children--now 1, 3 and 5--will all be in day care on Sept. 11
this year, their daughter's first birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Michael says he and his wife have talked quite a bit about how to
celebrate this day, which has produced such conflicted emotions. "Our
baby's birth was such a definite bright spot that we must celebrate
it. We also have reverence for those whose lives were lost. We want
to commemorate them as we rejoice that she was born. We decided to do
something special. There are 75 kids in the day-care program, and we
want to bring treats for all of them, not just for those in my
daughter's group as we would ordinarily do. We want to do something
to make it happy for everyone that day."</TE>
<TE>   Josie O'Grady, 20, was in a hospital near Black Hawk, S.D., when
the planes hit the twin towers as her son, Isaiah, was being born. "I
thought it was kind of neat that he was born on that day. With all
those people losing their lives, I brought a new life into the world.
You can believe we are going to celebrate his birthday in a big way."</TE>
<TE>   O'Grady, who works at a day-care center, lives with her parents.
Her son's father lives in Kansas, she says. "We are best friends, and
he's coming down here for our son's first birthday."</TE>
<TE>   Helen Piccolo was in Las Vegas on Sept. 11, 2001. She'd traveled
there from her home in Rockledge, Fla., to celebrate her 76th
birthday with children and grandchildren who'd converged from around
the country to be with her.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, it was a terrible day. We'd gotten there the day before--and
then, on my birthday, the tragedy happened. We just all hung around,
feeling sad." At least she was with her family, she says. And having
a birthday on Sept. 11 has turned out to be an icebreaker and
conversation starter, she adds.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I have to say my birthday, or fill out a form saying
when I was born, like at the eyeglass store, it stops people cold.
And it starts an immediate conversation. They want to know where I
was, what I was doing, whether I mind having a birthday on that day."</TE>
<TE>   Piccolo says it's an interesting side effect of the tragedy, and
she is happy to talk about her experience--"it gives me something in
common with people I wouldn't ordinarily get to talk to. Like
everyone else, I am so saddened by what happened. But it doesn't make
me dislike the day on which I was born."</TE>

<LD>The daughter loads the little sedan full of my stuff, the old Zenith
and the 17-year-old microwave my wife and I bought not long after we
were married. All our treasures heading off to college, in an old
Honda with brand-new brakes. "Can you help her carry the TV?" my wife
asks.</LD>
<LD>   "That's my TV," I say.</LD>
<LD>   "She needs it in the car," my wife says.</LD>
<TE>   Parents, I'll warn you right now: Sophomore year, they hardly even
wave so long. Be ready for it. Be prepared. They'll board that plane
or climb into the car without a second glance back your way. Tough
customers, these sophomores. Nerves of steel. Don't say I didn't warn
you.</TE>
<TE>   "Call when you get there," my wife yells as our daughter gets into
the car. "Call when you reach the end of the street," I yell.</TE>
<TE>   We stand at the porch, waving as she goes, glad that not everyone
in the world drives as fast as she does. "She barely waved goodbye,"
I say as my daughter disappears down the street.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, she forgot her pillow," my wife says.</TE>
<TE>   But not much else. She packed the car tight. Clothes. Stereo.
Computer. A quesadilla maker. Her mother's extra kitchen spoons.
Magellan sailed the globe with less. "Hey, she forgot the couch," I
say.</TE>
<TE>   "She already has a couch," my wife says.</TE>
<TE>   And so ends this summer of love, my mail-order bride suddenly
pregnant and my oldest daughter sprinting off to college like a
quarterback for the end zone. Strange days, these. A time of
surprising hellos and poignant goodbyes. "She call yet?" I ask five
minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   "Not yet," the little girl says.</TE>
<TE>   "She call yet?" I ask in half an hour.</TE>
<TE>   "Who?" asks the boy.</TE>
<TE>   "Your sister," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "She's probably busy," explains the boy.</TE>
<TE>   OK, it's not like I don't have other things to worry about. The
front door needs painting. And there's a ceiling fan to hang. Just in
time for fall. Worse yet, the uniforms have yet to arrive for the
little girl's soccer team. Five days till opening day and we still
don't have uniforms or a team banner. As a coach, this kind of stuff
will eat you alive if you let it. It's one reason you see so much
burnout.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach, where are the uniforms?" the parents keep asking.</TE>
<TE>   "They're coming, they're coming," I answer, when in fact I don't
know for sure. The uniforms may not be coming. We may be the only
team that shows up for the opening day parade in uniforms we make
ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   "You sew a little?" I ask Amy, our talented midfielder. "No," she
says.</TE>
<TE>   "How about you?" I ask Anna, our star forward.</TE>
<TE>   "Not me, Coach," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Strange days, these. We may be the only team that shows up for the
Opening Day Parade in last year's Halloween costumes. No big deal.
Six witches. Some pirates. Couple of ghosts. Play ball. "Last year,
one girl was Marilyn Monroe," the little girl says.</TE>
<TE>   "That'll be perfect," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble is, it's hard to pick a team name when you don't have your
team colors. One year, we were the Pink Kittens. Another year, the
Teal Tornadoes. Generally, soccer teams base their names on the color
of their uniforms. So at a practice, we try to come up with a name
that doesn't have a color reference.</TE>
<TE>   "The Holy Molars," suggests one mom, noting that we are sponsored
by a dentist. "How about "The Kix"?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   With no other suggestions, we go with the Kix, a simple name that
sounds like breakfast cereal. Go Kix. Run, Kix, run. The parents seem
satisfied with the name, but the girls leave practice like hunched
and overworked airline reservation clerks. As names go, Kix is
sufficient. But rather uninspiring.</TE>
<TE>   At a Labor Day scrimmage, we consider some other ideas. "I think
I've got it," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Got what?"</TE>
<TE>   "A name," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "What?"</TE>
<TE>   "The Runny Eggs," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the kids seemed amused. Others seem puzzled and concerned
for our immediate future. "The Runny Eggs?" one of them asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Because we like to run," I explain.</TE>
<TE>   "And we appreciate a good breakfast," says Coach Bruce. Me, I like
the name if only for the potential sight of two-dozen parents
standing on the sidelines on autumn afternoons, yelling "Go Eggs!"
Or, more appropriately, "Run, Eggs, run!"</TE>
<TE>   So, till a better name comes along, we'll be the Runny Eggs. Our
team motto (submitted by Marisa): "No Yolking Around." Kristina still
isn't sure about the name, but Destiny likes it plenty. Jessica does,
too.</TE>
<TE>   "I like eggs," she explains.</TE>
<TE>   "Bless you," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there are added benefits to being the Runny Eggs. If
the uniforms don't arrive in time, we could wear our yellow mesh
practice jerseys to our games. Our team name would then actually
match our uniforms. No yolking. "You think they've ever impeached a
coach?" my wife asks when I tell her about our new name. "Not since
Clinton," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "This could be your year then," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Life. It'll eat you alive if you let it.</TE>

<LD>A cymbal crashes, the saxophone purrs, the bass rips into a
bump-and-grind, and vavoom! Who's that girl?</LD>
<LD>   She springs from behind a curtain, all dolled up in a red low-cut
gown and matching boa, her black bra peeking through, unmatched
stockings full of naughty holes, stilettos high and pointy.</LD>
<LD>   Slender and athletic, sexy and playful, she sashays and struts
inside the spotlight. Her big green eyes and thick black lashes are
all come hither. Her lips curl seductively. Now she's dancing, now
flirting, now gyrating, and, oh, she's hotter than Georgia asphalt.</LD>
<TE>   "Yeah!" yells Andre Blake, 36, jumping from his seat at the center
of the Forty Deuce horseshoe bar. Others around him are hooting and

and being fine in the end because they feel so satisfied," Kane says.</TE>
<TE>   Similar acts have been titillating Hollywood in recent years--the
Pussycat Dolls and Velvet Hammer burlesque dancers occasionally
perform at such clubs as the Viper Room and, earlier this year, the
Sunset Room put on "Sunset Rouge," a full burlesque act complete with
acrobats and clowns.</TE>
<TE>   But Forty Deuce, open for two months, is slightly different. It is
Kane's throwback to New York City's old strip clubs on 42nd Street,
"the back-alley" lounges he frequented as a teenager when he skipped
school with his buddies. Kane gutted his first Hollywood bar, the
eponymous Kane, which had been open for five years, to create Forty
Deuce, a 125-capacity, sophisticated lounge with a low bar, lounge
chair seating and cocktail tables with tiny, inviting lamps.</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, we called 42nd Street 'Forty Deuce' and after Sept.
11, I just wanted to pay homage to my city," Kane says. "The vibe in
the club is right for the name because it has that old Times Square
feel to it. This is not a gentleman's club or an in-your-face strip
club. The dancers are professional dancers. They are not strippers. I
wanted to go back to the days when erotic dancing was an art form,
and the tease was what it was all about."</TE>
<TE>   Teasing, Carolina Cerisola has discovered, comes naturally to the
22-year-old Argentine world-champion salsa dancer. Her sultry
act--which incorporates traditional bump-and-grind a la Gypsy Rose
Lee with modern salsa and samba steps that make climbing the Santa
Monica stairs seem like a Sunday stroll--is not X-rated. She does not
bare all; it just seems as if she does.</TE>
<TE>   "She's phenomenal," says Blake, who says he is partial to her
Latin rhythms because his mom is Venezuelan. "She is sexy but at the
same time refined. She has a lot of class to her. She's a baby, but
up there, ay, Dios mio! Burlesque is a hard thing to do. We live in a
very sexual society, and we've gotten away from the class of it all.
For me, this is refreshing."</TE>
<TE>   Offstage, there's still a lot of girl in this woman whose act is
so hot that she is the only dancer Kane schedules to perform every
night the club is open, Wednesday through Saturday. At 5 feet 6,
she's thin but still preoccupied with the flatness of her abs, which
she mentions often in conversation. She eats only once a day on the
nights she performs "because I don't like my [stomach] rolls." She
also worries what her boyfriend and mother would think if they caught
her act. Knowing how she makes her living, she explains, is "very
different than actually seeing me."</TE>
<TE>   "I've discovered a whole new side of me, my sexy side, since I
started dancing for Ivan," says Cerisola, sipping some orange juice,
the only thing she'll allow herself four hours before her show
begins.</TE>
<TE>   Before Cerisola met Kane through a mutual friend a year ago and
started dancing at Deep, she was on the salsa circuit and spent five
months as partner to Johnny Vasquez, the "Prince of Salsa." She
danced in Marc Anthony's "I Need to Know" video and Guy's "Dancing"
video, both in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the "Latin girl," as club-goers are prone to call her, has
become Forty Deuce's headliner. Hollywood celebrities, such as Nicole
Kidman, Sandra Bullock and George Clooney have stopped in to see what
the fuss is about. Last weekend, Daryl Hannah, Vince Vaughn, and
Kiefer Sutherland were among those in the audience.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe what's happening," says Cerisola, who has lived
in Los Angeles for two years and is still learning English. "Wow! I'm
super happy. More than anything, with myself, which is very
important. I never expected people to respond this way. When they
yell my name, it always takes me by surprise. It's all very new to me
because I've always been in a Latin environment."</TE>
<TE>   Between the hourly acts, a disc jockey spins everything from the
theme from "Peter Gunn" to Nelly. Then the Forty Deuce Trio, a
three-piece jazz and bump-and-grind combo, takes to the stage setting
the mood for the dancers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so much fun to interact with the girls and get them excited
to take their clothes off faster," says bandleader Joey Altruda, the
bassist. Sometimes they draw it out too long "and I have to yell,
'Take off the glove!' " to get them started, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Except with Cerisola, whose 10-to 15-minute numbers include
titillating the Forty Deuce Trio. Strutting all over the horseshoe
bar, without ever knocking a drink, she paces herself, waiting for
the perfect moment to peel off one glove, then the other, and toss
them on the heads of mesmerized men, like Chick Friedman, 36, a real
estate developer from New York. Seconds later, she's bending down,
wrapping her boa around a man's neck and handing a drink to another
as she winks at him.</TE>
<TE>   She heads back to the stage, a part of the bar that is
hydraulically lowered to make room for the dancers, hangs from a
string of pearls and faces Willie McNeil, the drummer whose
expressions could be a comedy act of their own. "I've always mugged a
lot," says McNeil, 40. "I'm a showoff, and it adds a comical element
to the show. This is a perfect gig for a ham like me. Carolina is
great. She's very musical. I can play a riff once, and the next time
I play it, she catches it. No matter what the other girls do on
stage, she's always on top."</TE>
<TE>   McNeil's mouth gapes when Cerisola gets close. She rips off her
dress in one smooth swoop, revealing a pair of sparkly panties that
match her bra. Men whistle and scream. Kane hollers and then catches
himself: "Gotta support my girls," he says wickedly. Cerisola moves
in front of McNeil's drum kit with her back to the audience. He
pounds salsa on his drum, and her feet go off.</TE>
<TE>   "She's sensational," says Mia Dalsemer, a former dancer who is
enjoying a girl's night out with three friends. "This is a very cool
thing to do. What she can do with her body! There were three martinis
on the bar and she didn't knock one down."</TE>
<TE>   Women, Cerisola has been surprised to learn, are among her biggest
fans. She throws back her head and smiles, making another round of
the bar. This time, the saxophonist is her target. Coquettishly, she
gets him to follow her across the bar like a panting dog. She dances
for him and around him, takes off her bra and hangs it on his sax.</TE>
<TE>   When she moves toward the crowd, she's in a nude-colored second
bra with flowery designs. She spots Friedman's pal, who wants to be
identified only as Peter, and tosses her panties on his head and
laughs. Now she's in black briefs. And this is the way she stays
until the lights go out and she falls into her chair in her dressing
room, exhausted.</TE>
<TE>   It's not always this smooth. Once, she swallowed a feather from
her boa and it got stuck in her throat in the beginning of her
number. Another time, her second bra unsnapped before the lights went
out.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so embarrassing," she says, red-faced. "But those things
always happen when you're onstage."</TE>
<TE>   For her boss, it's working out just fine.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about interacting," Kane says. "We're a lounge, not a
theater, but this is the most theatrical thing I've ever done. I
wanted to put the class and taste back in the striptease. I don't
think people want to come out and see something that is so obvious. A
girl takes off her top in 10 seconds, and where does it go after
that?</TE>
<TE>   "Carolina is so much fun and is so good at this. I had no idea she
was going to shine the way she does."</TE>

<HD>For Better or For Worse, the Car Is Still Part of the
Family</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My daughter approaches the black station wagon with the slightly
dented passenger side front door and pats the fender fondly. "My
car," she says, as if greeting a pet or a beloved baby doll. And I
realize that when my husband and I chose this car a couple of years
ago, we were doing more than upgrading from a two-door; we were
picking the Family Car.</LD>
<LD>   That is a term well-known by car designers and marketers, flung
about in advertisements and trend stories, and for the most part it
conjures up "more"--more space, more doors, more seats, more cup
holders, more headroom so it is possible to drop a small TV and, heck
yeah, maybe a microwave oven down from the roof.</LD>
<LD>   The ads inevitably feature a mom in a Dorothy Hamill 'do smiling
into the rearview mirror at a litter of slumbering or otherwise
dreamily focused youngsters.</LD>
<TE>   At their feet, on a floor free of crumbs, shoes and desiccated
juice boxes, lie charmingly worn soccer balls, baseball mitts and
other accouterment of the perfect childhood.</TE>
<TE>   Music swells and the camera pans back to show a quiet country road
cutting through a golden-leaved forest in a place and time that does
not exist on this planet.</TE>
<TE>   Which isn't to say that the Family Car does not exist or that it
doesn't have cultural resonance. Of course it exists; just look at
all those smudgy handprints and Power Ranger stickers on windows of
car after car you pass on the freeway. And as for resonance, well, in
America at least, the Family Car may be the first indication of a
culture outside the family that a person gets.</TE>
<TE>   As Fiona, at 2, has just discovered, her car is different from the
cars of her little friends, and by the time she hits her brother's
age--a sagacious 4--she will begin to understand that this means
something. That the Family Car inevitably betrays quite a bit about
its Family.</TE>
<TE>   When I was 7 and got my very own camera, the first thing I did was
run around my neighborhood taking pictures of everyone's cars. My
parents thought this a fruitless pursuit but figured I had chosen my
subjects because they could neither throw up a protesting palm or
move out of the frame.</TE>
<TE>   I still have those pictures, and looking at them, I know exactly
what I was doing. To me, these cars were as representative of our
neighbors and their ways as their front doors, or their faces.</TE>
<TE>   The Marsons drove an Oldsmobile because he was old and cranky; we
had a Ford station wagon because we were a Ford family; the Bossys
had a trailer hitch because Mr. Bossy had a boat somewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Our family car changed over the years as our family did. At some
point we unloaded the station wagon and Dad got a pickup, but we
still needed a car we could all fit in. For one lamentable period it
was a lemon yellow Pinto soon followed by an Aztec copper Pacer that
looked exactly like an automotive Birkenstock and had a "Jerry Brown
for President" bumper sticker.</TE>
<TE>   It was right about this time that my brother and I came into the
full awareness of the shame that an embarrassing family car can
evoke. These were followed by two Ford Fiestas, orange and yellow,
that were unmercifully sturdy and reliable--no matter how much my
brother and I abused them, they refused to break down.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, we were a family with issues. But there these cars all
were, nosing their way into our pictures as frequently as our dogs or
Christmas trees. For better or for worse, they, like shag carpet and
Fair Isle sweaters, were part of who and what we were.</TE>
<TE>   I hadn't considered any of this when my husband and I picked what
would be our children's first family cars. I think we did OK--the
Passat has become a natural Volvo substitute among growing families
without $45K to spare, and my husband's Camry is sleekish and
unobjectionable.</TE>
<TE>   But still, we'll have to be careful in the future--I still
remember with fondness the washed-out blue of the station wagon and
how hateful the lemon yellow that followed it seemed. As if things
were about to go downhill, as if I'd never feel as I did when lying
on a blanket in the back of the wagon, listening to the road rippling
beneath me and even though the sky was cold and full of snow, I was
warm and sleepy.</TE>
<TE>   The Pinto, as I recall, had bucket seats in the back. They were
green.</TE>

<LD>Charreria</LD>
<LD>   Every family has customs and traditions that are important to its
members. Charreria is a tradition that continues year after year in
Mexico and the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Charreria has its roots in the 16th century when the Spanish
brought horses to Mexico. Men who worked with horses on large pieces
of land, called haciendas, often competed against one another,
showing off their skills.</LD>
<TE>   Males known as charros and females known as charras or escaramuzas
wear beautiful clothing when participating in charreria activities
and also in a charreada, where the elements of clothing, art, music
and sport all come together. A charreada is an equestrian (horseback
riding) sporting event with music and food. On Sundays, many Mexican
American families get together for a charreada, where families pass
down equestrian skills and respect for charreria. Wearing charreria
clothes such as the adelita dress or the charro suit, parents show
their children how to ride a horse and compete in events called
suertes. Charreadas are one way that different generations can get
together and celebrate their Mexican heritage.</TE>
<TE>   Activity</TE>
<TE>   Answer the following questions:</TE>
<TE>   * What do you think the adult and child are talking about in the
photograph?</TE>
<TE>   * When does your family get together to celebrate and have fun?
How do you celebrate? How does your family have fun together?</TE>
<TE>   * What sports do you and your family play or watch together? What
other activities do you and your family share? What are your  family
traditions?</TE>
<TE>   You can celebrate Charro Day on Sept. 14 at the Autry Museum of
Western Heritage. Come dressed as a charro or charra, and get into
the museum free of charge. You can learn more about charreria at the
museum's exhibition "Art of Charreria: A Mexican Tradition," which
has been extended through Oct. 20. For more information, call (323)
667-2000 or visit www.autry -museum.org.</TE>

<LD>Lunchtime! Little Dude and I carry our plates past crowded tables and
sit at an empty one. Mrs. Moss comes toward us, followed by the
couple in those jungle shirts.</LD>
<LD>   "Help!" I whisper. "We need shades if we have to look at those
wild colors!"</LD>
<LD>   Little Dude giggles.</LD>
<TE>   The three grown-ups sit down across from us.</TE>
<TE>   Little Dude hunches down, probably trying to look younger, cuter
and cuddly.</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Moss tells him, "Will you please sit up straight?"</TE>
<TE>   She introduces Mr. and Mrs. Otis. She says our names, Deon
Washington and Lionel Brown. Then she walks away.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Otis repeats our names. "So the two of you are not brothers!"</TE>
<TE>   Little Dude pipes up, "I wish we were. I'd like that!"</TE>
<TE>   "We've been watching you," says Mrs. Otis. "You are so nice to
each other that we were sure you must be related."</TE>
<TE>   Little Dude swigs a huge gulp of punch. When he sets down his cup,
it lands on a crack. The cup tips over.</TE>
<TE>   Red punch splashes onto Mrs. Otis. Man, Little Dude really blew
it. I try to stop the spreading flood with my hands.</TE>
<TE>   "Look out, honey!" warns Mr. Otis.</TE>
<TE>   She jumps up.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry," says Little Dude.</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Otis says, "No problem. It will blend right in with our
shirts."</TE>
<TE>   I hurry to say, "He wouldn't have done that if I hadn't bumped his
elbow."</TE>
<TE>   "You did not!" Little Dude says fiercely.</TE>
<TE>   They look at him, then at me. Back and forth.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's go clean you up, honey," Mr. Otis says to his wife. "It was
nice to meet you, boys," they tell us. Then they walk away.</TE>
<TE>   Little Dude slumps and says, "I better forget about Star Wars
sheets."</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Otis wheels around. Did she hear that?</TE>
<TE>   Little Dude watches them go away and whispers, "And they would
have been so nice."</TE>
<TE>   I put my arm around his skinny shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. and Mrs. Otis get into a little blue Honda and drive out of
the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: Why did Mr. and Mrs. Otis leave the picnic? Was it
because Little Dude spilled punch on Mrs. Otis?</TE>
<TE>   Mary Daegling first learned about adoption fairs when she read
about them in a story in the newspaper. This story will be on The

<HD>Jewels in the Rough</HD>
<DH>We rarely plant them and hardly ever praise them. But beets
are a late summer treasure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY GREEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the face of it, beets are extroverts. Their very veins run
magenta, red and gold. The roots come from the same high palette.
When the hue is purple or red, which it so often is, then they are
not just flamboyant, but inky as an angry octopus.</LD>
<LD>   And yet for all this personality, beets are among the most
neglected vegetables in the marketplace. Their reputation is 50 years
out of date. People grumble of beet fatigue from Victory Gardens.
Others think of beets as canned items. It's hard to find anyone who
studies them. In fact, a convention of U.S. beet experts would be a
convention of one. Then there's the mess. Boil them and the beets
stain your hands, your cutting board, your clothes.</LD>
<LD>   No splendor is perfect. But before writing off the beet, bake it.
Its color seems to retreat within it, becoming even more saturated,
yet more beautiful. Once you've tasted a baked beet, it's hard to
have them any other way. It is one of the most arresting flavors to
come from the field. Its sweetness can only be surpassed by sugar
cane, but then this sweetness is countered by a profound and complex
earthiness.</LD>
<TE>   Summed up in a suffix, beets are -er: brighter, sweeter, stronger,
darker. Right now, they are at their er-est. Across the country, the
shortening days and gradual chill is concentrating their flavor in
the field, even before harvest.</TE>
<TE>   This intensity makes it tricky to move on to the beet's crowning
grace, which is--don't scoff--great subtlety. Faced with other
ingredients, beets have a wholly magical tact. They are a superb
foil. There is no more accommodating food. Beets complement almost
every ingredient that any cook from anywhere can throw at them.</TE>
<TE>   Give it a try. Bake an entire panful. Wash them if they're cruddy.
Cut them about an inch above the stem so the pigment doesn't run. If
they're medium-size, pop them in the oven at about 375 degrees for an
hour and a half. There will be a sweet, toasty almost nutty aroma
wafting around the kitchen when they're done.</TE>
<TE>   You can test for doneness much as you would with a boiled potato,
by sticking something sharp into the beets and deciding if that's the
resistance you find palatable (the beet itself is edible raw). Let
them cool. Store the ones you're not going to eat, unpeeled, in
Tupperware in the fridge.</TE>
<TE>   Peel the ones you are going to use. The skins should come away
fairly easily, if not slipping right off like breezy cookery writers
swear they do. First, put them warm or at room temperature in a salad
with toasted walnuts, goat cheese, mache and orange. See what
happens.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly. The walnuts will never taste nuttier, the chevre never
tangier and orange never fruitier. Now try some more pureed with
vinegar, sugar and horseradish. You'll have a classic condiment,
called chrain, perfect for meats, or dumplings.</TE>
<TE>   Now try pureeing roast beets into chicken stock to make borscht.
Cook beets with star anise, finish them with pastis. Chef
Jean-Georges Vongerichten hits beets with Tabasco, Worcestershire
sauce and capers, and they take it. Whatever you do to them, never
for a second do they lose their integrity. Carrots should have such
character.</TE>
<TE>   Or flexibility. Beets accept whatever oil is in your larder--olive
oil, walnut oil, pine nut oil. They become luminous and satiny in the
presence of butter, bright and refreshing with vinegar. Various
recipes insist on balsamic vinegar here, cider vinegar there, Sherry
vinegar the next breath and raspberry vinegar for yet another
concoction. Beets embrace them all with equanimity.</TE>
<TE>   Vegans use beets in lieu of meat; carnivores use them as pungent
garnishes for beef. They go equally well with dill, with parsley,
with chervil, tarragon or chives. You can bake them like potatoes,
serve them slit and buttered. If you're hungry and want a fast fix
and don't mind the mess, all beets require to constitute a meal are
boiling, peeling and, if you're feeling fancy, the addition of salt
and pepper.</TE>
<TE>   They're that good.</TE>
<TE>   But all this versatility goes unsung. Instead, beets seem to be a
cue for jokes about the Cold War and the Catskills, though beets
don't even originate from Russia, Poland or upstate New York. They
come from the Mediterranean, where the wild progenitors of today's
domesticated crops grew around the seashore at tide lines.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Beet</TE>
<TE>   For insight into the history of beets, horticulture writer Roger
Phillips harks back to Aristotle. The late British food writer Jane
Grigson preferred Pliny. American food historian William Woys Weaver
offers an anecdote about the 6th century Levantine physician
Dioscorides. Myself, I give you Irwin Goldman, a beet breeder at the
University of Wisconsin at Madison.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman is the country's leading authority on the table beet. To
be precise, he's the only authority. The closest California can
produce is UC Davis agronomist Stephen Kaffka, whose work as a sugar
and fat specialist has largely acquainted him with sugar beets. A
clear fan of beets, or as he calls them, "table beets," he
regretfully dismissed the crop as "beneath the radar" of Californian
farm science.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Washington, D.C., an interested and entirely tenacious
information officer with the USDA's Agricultural Research Service
wasn't even sure that the continental United States had a beet
specialist until she ferreted out Goldman. When I left Goldman a
message asking if he might talk, he returned the call immediately and
cried, "I'd love to! There aren't enough people who want to talk
about beets!"</TE>
<TE>   Table beets, it seems, aren't much grown commercially anywhere in
America. While the U.S. devotes a staggering 1.4 million acres to
growing a cousin of theirs, sugar beets, big tough plants fit only
for sugar extraction and livestock fodder, Goldman estimates that we
grow fewer than 8,000 acres of table beets, more than half of these
in Wisconsin for the canning industry.</TE>
<TE>   A depressing statistic.</TE>
<TE>   Part of Goldman's funding has come to breed seeds for red, redder
and reddest table beets to explore the use of their pigments, called
betalains, as natural food dyes. Intermittently over the years, beets
have been used to color Kool-Aid, Yoplait, Ben &amp; Jerry's, Jell-O,
salami, potato chips and pasta. The red we see in beets is "actually
two colors," Goldman says, "a bluish red, produced by a compound
called betacyanin, and then betaxanthin, which is yellow. Bright
yellow."</TE>
<TE>   When we see beets that are gold, they only have yellow pigment.
"That doesn't bleed as much when you cook it," he says. "It's not as
noticeable."</TE>
<TE>   The pigment is contained within the plant's cells, so when we
slice it, it spills out. Extreme boiling will turn it brown, so it is
best to beware the postwar approach to borscht--just simmer the baked
beet root in chicken stock long enough for the flavors to meld, then
puree.</TE>
<TE>   Government scientists are busily discovering nifty anti-oxidants
in these betalains. Some pass straight through us. How much we retain
is unclear. "You aren't what you eat," says Goldman, quoting a
laboratory aphorism. "You are what you don't excrete."</TE>
<TE>   As for the striped beet, an Italian variety called the Chioggia,
or "candy" beet in California, the streaks are a genetic fluke, he
explains. In these, only the phloem, the part of the plant that
conducts sugar created during photosynthesis from the leaves to the
root, produces the red beet pigment. The xylem, the water-conducting
tissue in a plant, does not have it. So look at a cross-section of a
candy beet and the phloem will be pink and the xylem will be white.</TE>
<TE>   Beets weren't always this lurid, says Goldman. The ones we know
were selected over thousands of years by gardeners who fancied the
brightest specimens. Romans liked the red ones enough for the
vegetable's alternate name to have been "Roman beet." Modern chefs
tend to claim that superior flavors reside in the gold and striped
ones. But Goldman rejects that.</TE>
<TE>   "Flavor has absolutely nothing to do with color," he says. "It's
completely unrelated."</TE>
<TE>   Variety can affect flavor. Some chefs commend the turnip-shaped
"Egyptian" varieties, others praise classic "globe"-shaped beets. The
differences, explains Goldman, have to do with three things: variety,
the soil and the climate. He is particularly proud that all beet
hybrids in the world have some Wisconsin genes in them. His favorite
hybrid is Red Ace, and he waxes on about the charms of the classic
types Ruby Queen, Detroit beets, Crosby Green Top and Lutz Green
Leaf.</TE>
<TE>   Beets that need better breeding work, he thinks, are the
cylindrical types promoted for their ease of peeling and chopping. He
studied them as a potential crop for Wisconsin's beet canning
industry and suspects they were bred for shape but not taste.</TE>
<TE>   Size matters too. The younger the beet, the more tender the root
and leaves. But in a crop routinely harvested between 45 and 60 days
old--that is, never beyond the plant's juvenile state--tough roots
are rarely a problem, says Goldman.</TE>
<TE>   A New Leaf</TE>
<TE>   It's different with greens. Very baby beet greens sell at herb
stalls at Santa Monica farmers market for $7 a pound; just a few feet
away at vegetable stalls, most customers want greens chopped off of
beets sold for their roots.</TE>
<TE>   The proprietor of the Coastal Organics stall, Santa Paula farmer
Paul Carpenter, puts this down to innocence. "Most people are used to
buying beets in a can. I don't think the tops have ever occurred to
them," he says.</TE>
<TE>   These teen greens may be too coarse for salads, but are delicious
when treated like cabbage or kale: steamed, stir-fried or, best,
sweated in butter, garlic and herbs, then simmered in chicken broth.
Cook them as you would another cousin, Swiss chard. Beet greens
should be chopped off and eaten separately if you plan to store the
roots, which will keep in a cool, dark place much like potatoes.</TE>
<TE>   And so to the cardinal beet flavor, the earthiness that is divine
to some, dirty to others. It comes from a compound called geosmin,
which is a by-product of certain microorganisms found in soil and
vegetables. Beet farmers will say the biggest thing affecting how
strong the flavor is isn't beet variety, but the type of soil.</TE>
<TE>   "That's logical!" cries Goldman. Peruse the literature on geosmin,
and one finds that this lowdown, earthy tang is desirable in beets
and corn, less so in catfish or drinking water.</TE>
<TE>   A collection of curious Web sites have sprung up offering beet
juice, beet pigment, beet this and beet that as homeopathic remedies.
Neither Goldman nor the USDA's phyto-nutrient specialists would
comment on their claims. What is clear is that, between their sweet
roots and robust greens, beets are nutritious, particularly as
sources of folic acid. To find out just how nutritious, the USDA has
a nifty new Web site where you can check out the value of any food:
www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp.</TE>
<TE>   On the subject of minerals, chefs remark on the varying salt
content in beets. Goldman explains it by saying that wild beets are
native to seashores, and are so salt-tolerant that in the wild that
they can grow right at tide lines. Farmed varieties can vary wildly
in natural salt content. It's prudent to always taste them while
seasoning so as not to overdo it.</TE>
<TE>   A Sensitive Crop</TE>
<TE>   There would be more horticulturalists eager to talk about the beet
if it were a big commercial crop. But it's not. Beet seedlings are
sensitive little sprouts. It takes vigilance to protect them from
predators. Soon after germination, beet fields require hand thinning.
Agri-business long ago wrote the crop off as too labor intensive to
merit much industry-sponsored research.</TE>
<TE>   One of Goldman's colleagues at the University of Wisconsin,
horticulture professor Helen Harrison, says industry indifference is
actually good for specialty farmers. It protects the market for the
little guys. Beet farmers then enjoy a devoted following and a great
return from a crop that may require hand-thinning, but ripens fast
and produces a great yield per acre.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was a specialty grower, I'd grow them," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Grow them specialty farmers do, as do home gardeners. (Thompson &amp;
Morgan describes it as a "moderately popular" crop, and carries 10
varieties of seeds.) Beets not only appear across the country in
farmers markets 45 days after the last frost, they keep on coming
right as the last summer plantings are harvested throughout the
autumn.</TE>
<TE>   The last of these are taken slowly from cold store throughout the
winter.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, conditions are such that the season is
continuous; beets grow 365 days a year.</TE>
<TE>   Between Los Angeles farmers markets and Southern Californian
supermarkets serving large Russian populations, beets and their
greens can be found in one form or another most days of the year.</TE>
<TE>   From his office at UC Davis, Kaffka relishes how a Mediterranean
crop best appreciated by Russians has found its comfiest geographical
niche in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "You're blessed," he says. "It's a new definition of blessedness.
You can eat beets any time."</TE>

<TE>   Beet Tartare</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Total Preparation Time: 2 hours</TE>
<TE>   From "Jean-Georges: Cooking at Home with a Four-Star Chef" by
Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Mark Bittman (Broadway, 1998).</TE>
<TE>   6 beets (about 1 1/2 pounds)</TE>
<TE>   1 shallot, roughly chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</TE>
<TE>   Few drops hot pepper sauce</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon Sherry vinegar</TE>
<TE>   6 cornichons, roughly chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup capers, drained</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon mayonnaise</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons chopped parsley, plus more for garnish</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Wash the beets and, leaving them
wet, wrap them individually in foil. Place in a roasting pan or on a
baking sheet and bake until tender, about 1 1/2 hours. (To test, poke
a thin-bladed knife through the foil.) Let the beets cool in the
foil. (Alternatively, to cook in water, drop the beets into salted
water to cover and bring to a boil. Cook over medium heat until
tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour.)</TE>
<TE>   When the beets are cool enough to handle, peel and cut into
eighths.</TE>
<TE>   Place the beets in the bowl of a food processor with the shallot,
Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, vinegar, cornichons and
capers. Pulse until the mixture is minced but not pureed. You may
have to scrape the mixture down between pulses.</TE>
<TE>   Spoon the mixture into a bowl and stir in the mayonnaise and
parsley. Taste and adjust the seasonings; you may need to add salt
and pepper and more vinegar, Worcestershire or hot sauce. (This dish
keeps well up to 2 days. Refrigerate, keeping it well wrapped or in a
covered container, and bring to room temperature before serving.)
Garnish and serve with steamed fish.</TE>

<TE>   Beets With Orange and Almonds</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 2 hours</TE>
<TE>   Great dishes may be served in fancy restaurants, but often they
have the humblest of origins. French chef Roger Verge is known for
his Michelin-starred restaurant Le Moulin de Mougins near Cannes, but
he dedicated his 1992 book, "Roger Verge's Vegetables," to his father
"an amateur gardener, but a caring one." This beet dish, which comes
from that book, is the soul of simplicity and so universal that a
very similar version (minus chervil, almonds and a certain finesse)
can be found in a vintage American cookbook called "The Best From
Midwest Kitchens" by Ada B. Lothe, Breta L. Griem and Ethel M.
Keating.</TE>
<TE>   The dish could be served as a side dish to meat; it would
certainly raise the tone at Thanksgiving. But it is so exquisite, so
vibrant and delicious, that it deserves to be served as a starter in
its own right.</TE>
<TE>   1 pound beets</TE>
<TE>   Juice of 3 oranges</TE>
<TE>   Zest of 1 orange</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup slivered almonds, toasted</TE>
<TE>   1/2 orange, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons coarsely chopped chervil or 1 to 2 teaspoons chopped
fresh tarragon, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Trim the leaves off the beets, leaving about an inch of stem. Set
the beets in a roasting pan. Bake until the skins are crinkled and
loose and a sweet beety smell permeates the kitchen. Medium-sized
beets should take about 1 1/2 to 2 hours, small ones about 1 1/2
hours.</TE>
<TE>   Peel the beets and cut into 3/8-inch cubes. Place the orange
juice, orange zest, beets and butter in a shallow saucepan or a
skillet. Cook over low to medium heat for 15 minutes--stirring
occasionally--then raise the heat to high to reduce the cooking
liquid, about 2 minutes. The beets should be coated with an orange
glaze. Taste. Salt if necessary, and add plenty of freshly ground
pepper. Turn into a warm serving dish and top with the almonds.
Squeeze the orange half over the cooked beets and garnish with the
chervil. Serve immediately.</TE>

<TE>   Red and Golden Beets With Oranges,</TE>
<TE>   Endive and Walnuts</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1  1/2
hours</TE>
<TE>   From "Chez Panisse Vegetables" by Alice Waters (HarperCollins,
1996).</TE>
<TE>   2 pounds red and golden beets</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup shelled walnuts</TE>
<TE>   2 blood or navel oranges</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons orange juice</TE>
<TE>   Zest of 1/2 orange, finely chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup olive oil</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/4 pound Belgian endive</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Trim and wash the beets and roast
them, tightly covered, with a splash of water in a roasting pan until
very tender, 50 to 60 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   While the oven is on, place the walnuts on a baking sheet and
toast them about 5 minutes. With a sharp paring knife, trim off the
top and bottom of each orange. Pare off the rest of the peel, making
sure to remove all of the pith. Slice the oranges into 1/4-inch
rounds.</TE>
<TE>   Make a vinaigrette by mixing together the vinegar, orange juice
and the zest, and stirring in the olive oil and salt and pepper to
taste.</TE>
<TE>   When the beets are cool enough to handle, peel them and slice into
rounds. Toss them gently with the vinaigrette and arrange the beets
on a plate with the orange slices and Belgian endive leaves. Drizzle
over any vinaigrette remaining in the bowl, and garnish with the
toasted walnuts.</TE>

<LD>Pasadena landscape architect Tony Kienitz recommends sowing beets in
Southern California anytime from Sept. 15 until July. "It's like the
start of spring, in reverse," he says. The only time not to sow them,
he says, is the hottest days of August and early September.</LD>
<LD>   Thompson &amp; Morgan has one of the better selections of beet seeds
with 10 varieties, including Chioggia, Detroit and Red Ace. (800)
274-7333 or www.thompson-mor gan.com.</LD>
<LD>   Seeds should be planted 1-inch deep in rows about a foot apart.
The seeds are actually flower heads, that may produce from three to
seven seedlings, most of which can be harvested for salad greens. As
they germinate, they should be thinned to about 3 1/2 to 4 inches
apart. Irwin Goldman recommends the Red Ace types for producing the
best baby salad greens.</LD>
<TE>   "Monogram" type seeds will produce only one seedling, eliminating
the need for thinning, but they have poor germination records.</TE>
<TE>   Beets take 45 to 60 days to mature. Thompson &amp; Morgan
horticulturalist Susan Jellinek recommends, as the roots start to
emerge, nudging a little mulch over them to prevent them from drying
out.</TE>
<TE>   Irrigation will depend on soil type. Soil should be keep pliable
and moist during germination. Frequent light watering is suitable in
well-prepared soil. A good growing guide is provided by Oregon State
University, oregonstate. edu/Dept/NWREC/beetch .html.</TE>
<TE>   Much is made of the danger of beets "bolting" or going to seed
before harvest as the plant senses a temperature change. There are
even special varieties resistant to bolting, such as "Boltardy."</TE>
<TE>   But bolting is not a problem in California, says Alan Hodgdon,
curator of the beet seed collection at the USDA Western Regional
Research Plant Introduction Station.</TE>
<TE>   "My problem is trying to make them bolt," he says. He wants the
seeds.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of beets, this takes two years. Most beets are
biennials. If your plant is that old, then the root will be tough and
you'll be best off using it as an ornamental.</TE>

<HD>A Mediterranean Shrimp Saute</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE LEVY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although sauteing is at the top of my list, any cooking technique
produces good shrimp--grilling, frying, braising in sauce, boiling in
a flavorful liquid or steaming. Shrimp are more affordable and easier
to prepare than most shellfish, are less temperamental than fish, and
they don't fall apart when you stir them.</LD>
<LD>   I rarely buy these crustaceans ready-cooked. Their flavor and
texture can't compare to the sweetness and succulence of home-cooked
shrimp. The few minutes they take to cook is time well spent.</LD>
<LD>   At the store, shrimp may be labeled with a number such as 31/35,
which indicates that 31 to 35 shrimp make one pound and is more
precise than "medium" or "large." A higher number means smaller
shrimp and usually a lower price. I find 30 per pound convenient for
most purposes. Some markets, menus and recipes call large shrimp
prawns.</LD>
<TE>   Peel shrimp before sauteing for easier eating. Remove the thin
legs and, beginning at the wide (head) end, gently peel the shell
from the belly toward the back. Pull off the shell segment at the
tail's end if you like.</TE>
<TE>   For attractive jumbo shrimp, remove the black threadlike vein,
actually part of the digestive tract, from its back. (In smaller
shrimp it's often not noticeable and you can skip this step.) To
devein a shrimp, make a shallow incision along the length of its back
and, if you see a dark thread, pull it out with the tip of a knife or
with your fingers. If cooking the shrimp unpeeled, slit the shell
down the back with a sturdy knife and devein.</TE>
<TE>   Once the shrimp are cooked, use their juices to saute mushrooms,
asparagus or green beans. The colorful shrimp and vegetable medley is
perfect over angel-hair pasta, linguine, couscous or rice. Another
time turn the sauteed shrimp into a terrific topping for baby greens
or a sensational seafood pizza. Or simply serve fresh, crusty bread
such as a baguette or ciabatta for sopping up every drop of the
savory sauce.</TE>

<TE>   Garlic Shrimp With Asparagus</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 25 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Tomatoes and herbs give these shrimp a bright look. To use green
beans instead of asparagus, break the trimmed beans in three pieces
and cook them about 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   If the shrimp have heads, twist them off and cook them with the
rest of the shells to make the quick shrimp stock; freeze the extra
stock to use for seafood sauces and soups. To save time, you can
substitute packaged fish or seafood stock, which is sold in specialty
stores and some fish markets. Other options are canned vegetable or
chicken stock or 2 to 3 tablespoons of bottled clam juice (you use
less of it because it's salty).</TE>
<TE>   Devein the shrimp if you want.</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds medium or large shrimp, rinsed, shelled,
shells reserved</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup dry white wine</TE>
<TE>   1 sprig fresh thyme plus 1/2 teaspoon minced fresh thyme, or 1
teaspoon dried, divided</TE>
<TE>   3/4 to 1 pound asparagus, peeled if thick, trimmed and cut in 4
pieces</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   2 to 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons butter or 2 tablespoons additional olive oil,
divided</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   4 large cloves garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   2 plum tomatoes, peeled, seeded and diced, or 1/2 cup diced
drained canned tomatoes</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley</TE>
<TE>   Cayenne pepper, optional</TE>
<TE>   Lemon wedges, optional</TE>
<TE>   Combine the shrimp shells, wine and 1 thyme sprig or 1/2 teaspoon
dried in a saucepan. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Simmer
uncovered for 15 minutes. Strain the stock and measure 1/4 cup.</TE>
<TE>   Cook the asparagus uncovered in a saucepan of boiling salted water
until not quite crisp-tender, about 2 or 3 minutes. Drain the pieces,
reserving the liquid, rinse them with cold water and drain well.
Measure 1/4 cup cooking liquid.</TE>
<TE>   Heat 1 or 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter in
a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat until sizzling. Add the
shrimp, salt and pepper and cook, tossing often, for 1 1/2 minutes.
Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until the shrimp turn pink and are
just cooked through, about 1 minute; when you cut one at its thickest
part, it should be white inside. Spoon the shrimp into a bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Wipe the skillet clean, then heat 1 tablespoon of oil and 1
tablespoon of butter in the skillet over medium-low heat. Add the
asparagus, salt and pepper to taste and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.
With a slotted spoon, transfer the asparagus to the bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Pour the measured shrimp stock and asparagus liquid into the
skillet. Boil, stirring often, until the liquid is reduced to about
1/3 cup, 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, remaining tablespoon of butter,
parsley, remaining thyme and cayenne to taste, if using. Return the
shrimp and asparagus to the pan and toss over medium-low heat until
heated through. Taste and adjust seasoning. Serve hot, with lemon
wedges.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One day, while looking through "The British Housewife; or, the Cook,
Housekeeper's, and Gardiner's Companion" by Mrs. Martha Bradley
(1756), I came upon a dessert recipe invitingly titled "velvet
cream." But its first words were, "Clean a couple of Fowls' Gizzards
perfectly well, slash them with a Knife, and set them in Readiness."</LD>
<LD>   There followed a confusing business of heating cream with sugar,
pouring a few spoonfuls of it over a cupful of gizzards, letting it
cool, setting the cup of gizzards over warm embers awhile and then
mixing this with the rest of the cream. After repeating this three or
four times, you finally cooked the cream for a quarter of an hour.</LD>
<LD>   I absolutely had to give it a try. But the cup business made no
sense, so I just simmered the gizzards in cream and then strained
them out. After a couple of hours in the refrigerator, the cream
developed what Mrs. Bradley called a "Softness." In fact, it was like
a luscious pudding. It turns out that gizzards contain high-quality
gelatin.</LD>
<TE>   You'd have to work hard to detect any gizzard flavor in velvet
cream (it would be different if you were putting in chicken livers).
Still, Mrs. Bradley's coffee-flavored variant is more to modern
taste. Everybody I've tried it on has gobbled it up, though I find
it's best not to tell them what they're eating first. If you want to
make it, follow the directions exactly.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coffee Velvet Cream</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour,

<TE>   2 pints whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   7 tablespoons sugar</TE>

and add. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to medium
and cook at a rousing simmer so that small bubbles regularly break

<HD>Soy, With Steam and Attitude</HD>
<DH>'A soy latte' is becoming the order of choice, even if a
good one is almost impossible to make</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAWN HUBLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA CRUZ</DL>
<LD>All trends start somewhere, and for the sake of argument, you could
call this the cradle of the soy latte.</LD>
<LD>   Colleen Crosby recalls making her first one in 1978, not long
after she and her husband opened a coffeehouse here. A friend who was
into two of Northern California's signature passions--veganism and
gourmet coffee--had wondered if the Italian drink of steamed milk and
espresso could be done with no animal products. Crosby remembers
shoving a pitcher of soy milk under her espresso machine steamer and
thinking, "Hmm," when it came out.</LD>
<LD>   "It looked like silly putty," she says, laughing.</LD>
<TE>   Twenty-five years later, the drink that seemed fringe even to
Santa Cruz hippies is moving suddenly, even deliciously, mainstream.
Soy lattes are in high-end restaurants, in airport lounges, in
Midwestern shopping centers. They are on the menu at all 3,300-plus
Starbucks. In Northern California and the Pacific Northwest, some
coffeehouses report, as many as 10% of their coffee-and-milk drinks
are made with soy milk. Renee Zellweger reportedly drinks them, as do
Britney Spears and the drummer for Weezer. The popular rock anthem
"Drops of Jupiter" compares love to "the best soy latte you ever
had."</TE>
<TE>   In America's coffeehouses, however, the soy latte remains the bane
of the barista.</TE>
<TE>   "See? Look at this. It's supposed to look like melted ice cream.
Does this look like melted ice cream?" Anna Lorito ladles a big spoon
into a pitcher of frothed soy milk. It is thick. It is beige. It is
fragrant. But, apparently, it is not yet up to par. Lorito works at a
Peet's Coffee &amp; Tea in San Francisco, and in her nine months at the
bar, she has found soy lattes completely frustrating.</TE>
<TE>   "Ask anyone," she says, her silver nose ring glinting. "Giving
good soy foam is hard."</TE>
<TE>   The taste of a soy latte differs considerably from a conventional
latte, in which espresso is mixed with steamed milk, then topped with
a cap of milk foam. For one thing, soy milk isn't milk; rather it is
an extract of ground, soaked and cooked soybeans. Some soy milks are
bland, some are grassy; some are sweetened to suit the tastes of
American consumers, others have the "beanier" taste preferred in
Asian markets.</TE>
<TE>   At its best, a latte made with soy milk is to regular coffee what
a tall Guinness is to a draft beer--a heartier, almost
maltier-tasting variation on the standard, with a thick, brown,
creamy head.</TE>
<TE>   Such heights, however, are difficult to achieve because soy milk
is so much trickier to steam.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to go into it kind of gently--it's easy to scorch if you
slam into it with full-strength steam," says Patrick Main, the coffee
bar quality manager for the Emeryville, Calif.-based Peet's Coffee &amp;
Tea chain.</TE>
<TE>   Harold McGee, who has written several books on food science, says
this is because soy milk, unlike regular milk, is brought to a boil
in its manufacturing process, which "presensitizes" its proteins to
steam heat.</TE>
<TE>   "Soy milk has already been beaten up pretty badly by the time it
gets to the steamer," he says. "So the proteins are less effective in
doing what they need to do in a steamed milk product, which is to
bond at just the right time to stabilize the structure of its
bubbles."</TE>
<TE>   This is apparently why soy-latte-at-its-best can be tough to track
down. And why soy latte, at its worst, can end up tasting like
livestock feed and looking like old dishwater--wan and thinly bubbled
and gray-brown. Elizabeth Briggs, a professor of culinary arts at the
Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., offers a trick:
"Don't leave the steam nozzle in your soy milk for more than a minute
and a half, total. Get it hot for a minute, pull the nozzle up to
just below the surface and froth the milk for just maybe 30 seconds."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, get in and get out.</TE>
<TE>   The rise of the soy latte is one of those random crossings of true
believers that seem to occur with preternatural frequency on the West
Coast. In this case, the collision was between vegetarian purists,
who drank soy because it was a sustainable, non-animal product, and
coffee purists, who, from the late 1960s, sought to raise mainstream
consciousness about the virtues of fresh-roasted whole beans. Both
groups have been influential for decades in Northern California,
although it wasn't until the mid-1990s--and the rise of the Bay
Area's neo-hippie, dot-com culture--that their convergence began to
catch on.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, coffeehouse owners say, the soy latte was a sort of
sometime fetish that they chalked up to Nor-Cal eccentricity.</TE>
<TE>   "For years, we had this woman who used to come in every morning
with her own soy milk," laughs Daryl Ross, who owns four Berkeley
coffeehouses, including Caffe Strada and the Free Speech Movement
Cafe on the UC Berkeley campus. "Really attractive blond woman.
Professionally dressed. Mysterious. Trench coat. OK, I'm kidding
about the trench coat. But really, she came in every day."</TE>
<TE>   Peet's coffee bar quality manager Main says that his chain didn't
even put soy lattes on the menu until after 1995. People had asked
for them occasionally, he says, but they were treated as special
orders. Then Peet's opened a coffeehouse down the street from
Crosby's Santa Cruz Coffee Roasting Co.</TE>
<TE>   By that time, Crosby says, soy milk was a staple among coffee
condiments in Santa Cruz, from the health-food stores to the coffee
carts on street corners. "There's an Earth-consciousness here you
don't find everywhere," she says. "Santa Cruz is a hip town and you'd
have been unhip not to carry it."</TE>
<TE>   So when Peet's opened in Santa Cruz, Main says, they were deluged
with orders for espresso and steamed soy milk.</TE>
<TE>   "The requests were far above anything we'd seen before then, even
in Berkeley," he says. "In the first week, we got 120 requests and we
figured we'd better do something. So we went out and bought every
dairy substitute we could find--soy milk, rice milk, almond milk, oat
milk, and we did blind tastings. In 1996 we rolled it out everywhere
with Vitasoy Creamy Original soy milk, although we have since
switched to Vitasoy Enriched Original because it's a little bit
lighter and more like milk."</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the decade, soy lattes were such a Bay Area fixture
that customers could be overheard demanding to know the brand of soy
milk, if it was from whole beans or "isolates," if it was organic and
if it was Asian-or American-style.</TE>
<TE>   In Berkeley, Daryl Ross broke down and put his mystery woman's soy
latte on the menu; soy milk orders, he says, have shot up 51% in the
last four years. In San Francisco, coffeehouse regulars claimed they
could tell at a glance who'd order a soy latte: "Just look for the
SUV and the ponytail and the Nikes," offers North Beach artist Bob
Jones, "and the backward baseball cap."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the trend spread East.</TE>
<TE>   "By the fall of last year, we got such a groundswell of demand
that we had to put it on the menu and roll it out in all our stores,"
says Mark Jameson, executive vice president of Bucks County Coffee, a
Philadelphia-area coffeehouse chain.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it's 3% to 5% of our suburban business and probably 8% to 10%
in our campus markets. I hear it's a primarily female-driven product,
although I can't really say for sure--I'm not female and I'm not much
of a soy milk drinker. But it's turning out to be what low-fat milk
used to be."</TE>
<TE>   At the Midwestern coffeehouse chain Caribou Coffee, sales of soy
cappuccinos, mochas and lattes have risen by about 60% in the two
years since they were put on the menu, says marketing director Chris
Toal.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Barr, director of hot beverages for Starbucks Coffee Co. in
Seattle, says the chain has seen "strong growth in the use of soy
milk" in the last two or three years. Though none of the chains would
release sales figures, Barr estimates that Starbucks sold "several
million" soy milk drinks nationally last year.</TE>
<TE>   The attraction appears to be part fashion, part philosophy and
part midlife fear factor. First, soy is a vegetarian staple, and,
according to a recent poll by Teenage Research Unlimited, 25% of
American teens believe vegetarianism is "cool." ("Drops of Jupiter,"
the song with the soy latte reference, climbed to No. 4 on the U.S.
singles charts last year.)</TE>
<TE>   Second, soy milk has held its appeal for the true believers. In
the Pacific Northwest, for example, soy milk and espresso is known as
a "vegan latte." Jeff and Sabrina Nelson, owners of the San Fernando
Valley-based vegetarian Web site VegSource Interactive Inc., say soy
is the perfect creamer for people with lactose intolerance and
animal-rights issues.</TE>
<TE>   "I only drink decaf coffee and I put soy milk in it," says Sabrina
Nelson. "I know--people think, 'Good God, decaf with soy milk? You're
not even drinking coffee!' But see, you don't have the fat, you don't
have the caffeine and you don't have the dairy, but you still have
the taste of coffee. My only complaint is that Starbucks charges 40
cents more for their soy lattes."</TE>
<TE>   (Barr, the Starbucks executive, says they charge more because soy
milk is more expensive and because switching from milk to milk
substitute creates "a shift in the deployment of labor." Most other
chains upcharge for soy as well.)</TE>
<TE>   The biggest growth engine, however, appears to be the health
concerns of aging baby boomers. Peter Golbitz, a food company
consultant who publishes an annual directory to the soybean industry,
notes that sales of soy foods in general have grown at about 20% a
year for the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   "Growth for an established food product is usually around 2% a
year, and is based pretty much around population growth," Golbitz
says. "Soy foods, though, are skyrocketing because of a major shift
toward vegetable proteins. In a sense, the demographic involved is
the same as the gourmet coffee drinker--upscale, and either young and
attuned to natural food movements, or baby boomers who are changing
diets for health reasons, or who were granola crunchers from way
back."</TE>
<TE>   Interest in soy as a health aid has been especially intense since
1999, when the federal government gave food companies the go-ahead to
claim that soy protein reduces cholesterol and the risk of heart
disease. At the same time, other research suggested soy could prevent
bone-density loss and ease some symptoms of menopause. Cancer also
entered the picture as health activists expressed concern about the
possible risks of drinking the milk of cows that had been fed growth
hormones.</TE>
<TE>   Soy has health risks, too; some research, for example, indicates
there may be an increased cancer risk for post-menopausal women who
consume the supplement form of certain soy components known as
isoflavones. Nonetheless, Golbitz says, the quest for health has been
a boon, and one of the biggest drivers has been soy milk, which
tastes better than it used to thanks to improvements in processing
and plant breeding. Soy milk sales reached $550 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, coffeehouses make up only a fraction of those
sales; most soy milk is sold in supermarkets and health food stores.
"But coffeehouses are high visibility and mainstream," he says. "Some
consumers ask for it, so they put it on the menu and more consumers
see it and figure they'll try some in their coffee, just as a start."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the coffeehouse niche has become such a marketing
opportunity for soy milk companies that one--White Wave, the producer
of Silk soy milk--is soliciting alliances with coffeehouses to
promote Silk by name on their menus.</TE>
<TE>   "Millions of gallons are going through these coffeehouses and
nobody's marketing. We want to brand the category," says Steve Demos,
president of White Wave.</TE>
<TE>   Such plans, however, don't make life easier for the hard-working
steamers of all that soy milk.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, look," says Peet's Lorito, shoving another pitcher of Vitasoy
under the steam nozzle. "I'm easing it in ... I'm keeping it high ...
I'm getting the milk going in a spiral ... but see?"</TE>
<TE>   Actually, it looks terrific. But there is soy and then there is
soy in Northern California, a fact that has led some baristas to
avoid soy lattes altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, people ask for 'em. We don't do 'em," says Ida Zoubi, whose
family owns the venerable Caffe Trieste in North Beach. "I mean, soy
milk?" She shrugged, wiping the glass counter.</TE>
<TE>   "Ruins the taste of good coffee, I think."</TE>

<LD>Why do people order latte? Because the richness of the milk
apologizes for the bitterness of the coffee. It's tricky to make one
with soy milk. When it's done just right, it gives an amazingly
similar effect. But when it's off the mark, you get the worst
possible coffee drink--bitter and vegetal at the same time.</LD>
<LD>   We sampled soy lattes at six prominent coffeehouses around town
and rated them on how close they came to a good dairy latte. We were
looking for rich foam, convincing milk-like taste and good balance of
richness and coffee flavor.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles baristas, we discovered, still have a few things to
learn about making soy latte. Here's what we found, rating them on a
scale of 1 to 4 (1 being barely drinkable).</LD>
<TE>   Highland Grounds, 742 N. Highland Ave., Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *Music club by night, coffee purist's place by day, Highland
Grounds seems to be trying to ignore the soy milk. The latte has
scarcely any foam and no sweetening, making for distinctly bitter,
coffee-dominated flavor.</TE>
<TE>   *Small soy latte (12 ounces), $3.25(1)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf, 11698 San Vicente Blvd., Brentwood</TE>
<TE>   *There's nothing to irk the fit, young, go-ahead crowd that flocks
here, cell phones and portable PCs in hand: a mild, milky, sweetish
latte with little foam and a faint vegetal aftertaste.</TE>
<TE>   *Small soy latte (12 ounces), $2.80 (2 1/2)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Daily Grind, 7801 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *Despite the slightly beleaguered tone set by the sign warning
that the Grind's bathrooms are only for paying customers, this is a
comfortable latte with rich foam and a convincing milky flavor.</TE>
<TE>   *Small soy latte (12 ounces), $2.95 (3)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Urth Cafe, 8565 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *Imagine the cozy, sheltered atmosphere of a college town
coffeehouse, only it's in West Hollywood, and at some hours there's
valet parking. Urth's ecologically correct coffee is expensive, but
the place does make an outstanding soy latte, with good creaminess
and a rich, balanced coffee flavor. It's hard to believe you're
drinking soy.</TE>
<TE>   *Small soy latte (10 ounces), $3.50 (4)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Starbucks, 575 S. Lake Ave., Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *The leading espresso chain makes no false moves here: rich foam,
milky, not too sweet, with moderate coffee flavor.</TE>
<TE>   *Small soy latte(12 ounces), $2.90 (3)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Peet's Coffee &amp; Tea, 605 S. Lake Ave., Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *Right across the street is the first Southland branch of the
chain that rules Northern California. Despite Peet's strong focus on
coffee beans, though, this barely sweetened latte is extremely
creamy, with only a mild coffee flavor.</TE>
<TE>   *Small soy latte (10 ounces), $2.80 (2 1/2)</TE>

<LD>I'm often asked, "What do I do with tofu?" It seems plenty of people
want to add it to their diets, since it's low in fat and high in
protein, but they haven't got a clue as to how. Here's a simple yet
flavorful recipe. Served with an aromatic rice, it makes for a
healthful, substantial meal.</LD>
<LD>   Silken or vacuum-packed tofu is usually found in the produce
section of supermarkets. It comes in a variety of consistencies.
Extra-firm is best for this recipe--it holds together in the sauce
without getting mushy, as tofu sometimes can.</LD>
<LD>   To enliven your rice, crush two or three green cardamom pods with
the back of a knife and add to the rice while cooking. Soon you'll
have a wonderful cardamom scent in the kitchen.</LD>
<TE>   Serve this with basmati rice and lime wedges for garnish.</TE>
<TE>   Curried Tofu</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 25 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour *
Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   1 (12.3-ounce) carton extra-firm low-fat silken tofu</TE>
<TE>   Nonstick cooking spray</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon oil</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 cups chopped onion</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons coriander seeds, crushed</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons cumin seeds</TE>
<TE>   4 cloves garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup minced ginger root</TE>
<TE>   2 serrano chiles, chopped</TE>
<TE>   3 tomatoes, diced</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon curry powder</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups water</TE>
<TE>   Chopped cilantro</TE>
<TE>   Place the tofu between paper towels, set a cutting board on top
and then weight it with a bowl. Let the tofu drain, about 15 minutes.
Slice the tofu into 1/2-inch cubes and drain on more paper towels.
Pat dry.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, spray a nonstick skillet with nonstick cooking spray.
Heat the skillet over medium heat and add the oil. Add the onion,
coriander and cumin seeds. Cook until the onions are lightly browned,
stirring, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in the garlic, ginger, chiles and
tomatoes, and cook, stirring, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garam
masala, curry powder and salt, then add the water and bring to a
boil.</TE>
<TE>   Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the liquid has slightly
thickened, 5 minutes. Stir in the tofu. Simmer 5 minutes more.
Sprinkle with the chopped cilantro.</TE>

<HD>High Desert's Late Peaches: Just in Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KARP</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As summer draws to a close, peach lovers need not worry that their
favorite fruit is disappearing. Though the best varieties are winding
down in the San Joaquin Valley, the high desert is just starting the
peak harvest of its peaches. They ripen about three weeks later than
those in Fresno, thanks to the desert's colder, longer winters.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the desert varieties are the same as the Central Valley's,
such as the familiar O'Henry, which will be widely available the next
few weeks. A highly blushed short-fuzzed variety introduced in 1968,
it has good peachy flavor even when fairly firm (but not rock-hard).</LD>
<LD>   "O'Henry is the Cadillac of peaches, consistently good every
year," says John Tenerelli, who grows 75 acres of fruit in
Littlerock, about 10 miles southeast of Palmdale. "Our average sales
go from $300 to $500 per market when we put up the signs for them."</LD>
<TE>   Ryan Sun, a seedling of O'Henry, comes on a week later, but has
similar texture and flavor.</TE>
<TE>   An old favorite getting harder to find, Rio Oso Gem is lumpy and
has a scarred suture dividing its halves. It won't win any beauty
prizes, but aficionados prize its rich, almost citrusy flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Even rarer, but worth seeking out, are Indian Blood peaches, which
sport long, coarse fuzz over grayish-green skin mottled reddish
purple. The flesh, which can be a cream color swirled with crimson or
red all the way through, has a pronounced berry flavor and an intense
aroma.</TE>
<TE>   Before peaches were a big deal in the high desert, the area was
famous for Bartlett pears. In the 1920s, pears grew on more than
6,000 acres, as a main road still bears the name Pearblossom Highway.
However, problems with late spring frosts, severe winds and disease
made the plantings unprofitable by the 1970s, and today only about 25
acres remain in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   The high-desert Bartletts are superbly juicy and musky when
ripened fresh from the tree. They are ready to eat when they have
turned yellow but are still firm. The delicate fruits can be stored
for several months but tend to get banged up and taste of storage, so
the next month or so is the best time to enjoy them.</TE>
<TE>   The reddish-brown Seckel is rarely grown in California because of
its small size, but its highly concentrated, spicy and honeyed flavor
makes it worth a special search.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some notable Antelope Valley fruit growers, with
varieties worth looking for and some of the markets at which they
sell:</TE>
<TE>   Circle C Ranch. Indian Blood peaches and Seckel pears, at
Hollywood and Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   O-M-R Ranch. O'Henry and Rio Oso Gem peaches, Bartlett pears, at
Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Scattaglia Family Farms. O'Henry and Ryan Sun peaches, at Encino,
Hollywood, Irvine, Thousand Oaks and Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   Tenerelli Orchards. O'Henry, Indian Blood and Ryan Sun peaches; it
also carries Bartlett pears from George Bones Ranch, at Beverly
Hills, Hollywood, Pasadena, Santa Monica and Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   Yingst Ranch. Rio Oso Gem and Indian Blood peaches, Bartlett
pears, at Pasadena, Riverside and Victorville.</TE>
<TE>   Yingst Ranch also allows you to pick your own peaches and pears:
35349 80th St. East, Littlerock; (661) 944-2425.</TE>

<LD>What gives this meal its special zest is the "opposites attract"
marriage of pineapple and pork. First, the fruit salad uses orange,
mango and pineapple combined with a sweet onion and a light
mint-ginger vinaigrette. Then, we've added pancetta. Pair the salad
with grilled mahi-mahi, a little chile and lime, and this becomes a
meal worthy of the Big Island.</LD>
<LD>   If you want to go truly tropical, serve a scoop of Kona coffee ice
cream drizzled with bittersweet chocolate sauce and garnished with
macadamia nuts. Or keep it simple with what's in the freezer. Either
way, the end result will be good.</LD>

<TE>   Pineapple Salad With Grilled Mahi-Mahi</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Peeling and dicing a whole pineapple is too time-consuming; look
for bags of cut-up whole pineapples in the refrigerated section of
the produce aisle. If you buy a chunk of pancetta, rather than
slices, it will be easier to quickly dice.</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound pancetta, diced</TE>
<TE>   1 pineapple, peeled and cored, diced</TE>
<TE>   1 mango, peeled and pitted, diced</TE>
<TE>   1 orange</TE>
<TE>   1/2 sweet onion, such as Maui</TE>
<TE>   4 mahi-mahi filets (about 6 ounces each)</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons chili powder</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons orange juice</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon grated ginger root</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons fresh mint leaves, snipped into small pieces with
scissors</TE>
<TE>   Butter lettuce</TE>
<TE>   Lime slices, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   Heat an outdoor grill or an oiled grill pan.</TE>
<TE>   Fry the pancetta in a large skillet over medium-high heat,
stirring occasionally, until crispy, 10 minutes. Drain on paper
towels and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, place the pineapple and mango in a large mixing bowl.
Cut away the rind and pith from the orange and, cutting in between
the membranes, remove the segments. Add to the bowl. Quarter the
onion, remove any core, and slice as thinly as possible. Add to the
bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Brush the mahi-mahi filets on both sides with 1 tablespoon of
olive oil, season with salt and pepper and the chili powder. Place
the fish on the grill and cook until it flakes slightly with a fork
and is opaque, 4 to 5 minutes per side.</TE>
<TE>   Whisk together the seasoned rice vinegar, the remaining 1 1/2
teaspoons of olive oil, the orange juice, pepper to taste and the
grated ginger. Add the snipped pieces of fresh mint and mix.</TE>
<TE>   Pour the dressing over the fruit salad in the large bowl and mix.
Mound the salad in a serving bowl lined with butter lettuce and
garnish with the crispy pancetta. Serve the fish alongside with the

<HD>The Sweet Sides</HD>
<DH>Rosh Hashana's vegetable dishes welcome the new year with
dulcet tones</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE LEVY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Rosh Hashana, the time-honored greeting, "Have a happy and sweet
new year," is also the message of the menu. In selecting dishes,
people are guided not by a prescribed practice but by a popular
concept: Eat sweet foods and your year will be sweet.</LD>
<LD>   A favorite way to express the unique tone of the Jewish holiday,
which begins Friday at sundown, is to surround the main course (often
roast chicken or brisket) with sweet partners.</LD>
<LD>   The side dishes designed for Rosh Hashana are based on vegetables
that are naturally sweet. Time-honored choices of Ashkenazi (Eastern
and Central European) Jews are carrots and beets. Sephardic
(Mediterranean and Middle Eastern) Jews often opt for leeks, which
become sweet from slow cooking. Sweet potatoes and pumpkin have
become part of the repertoire, and to my own table I like to add red
peppers, corn and jicama.</LD>
<TE>   Certain vegetables, whether sweet or not, have additional
symbolism. Carrot rounds resemble coins and exemplify the wish for
prosperity. The Hebrew word for beets sounds like the verb for
getting rid of, and eating them metaphorically encourages heavenly
help in chasing out evildoers. Leeks stand for divine protection in a
similar way. To express hope for abundance, Sephardic Jews eat
black-eyed peas, as American Southerners do at New Year's, or rice,
as Persians do at their new year.</TE>
<TE>   When preparing the holiday vegetables, certain cooks use sugar,
prunes and raisins with a liberal hand. I prefer to subtly sweeten my
vegetables with a drizzle of honey or a sprinkling of dried fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Sweet spices such as cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves are a
popular foil for the sugar. They beautifully enhance glazed carrots,
which I used to make the French way with butter and sugar only, but
now accent with cinnamon, honey and dried cranberries.</TE>
<TE>   Following a tip from a Moroccan friend, I use these gentle spices
with my butternut squash too. She simmers her squash in meat soup,
then presents it and the other soup vegetables around a mound of
couscous and powders them abundantly with sugar and cinnamon. I
braise my squash instead with a pinch of sugar and spice in a sauce
of ripe tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   Some people avoid lemon juice and vinegar to forestall a bitter
year and therefore don't prepare sweet-and-sour dishes. I find that
tomatoes, which are at their seasonal peak around the Jewish New
Year, brighten the taste of sweet dishes, contributing a touch of
tartness without aggressive acidity.</TE>
<TE>   I often set out a platter of rice pilaf with raisins and nuts,
another highlight of the Sephardic holiday kitchen, as an
accompaniment for any meat or poultry entree or as a stuffing for
peppers or zucchini.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in an Ashkenazi home, my brother and I never
encountered pilaf, but marriage into Middle Eastern Jewish families
introduced us to this specialty. Our spouses learned to accept one of
our own new year standards--sweet gefilte fish. I'll let you decide
who got the better bargain.</TE>
<TE>   Faye Levy is the author of "1,000 Jewish Recipes" (Wiley, 2000).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stuffed Sweet Peppers With Rice and Currants</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour, 55
minutes</TE>
<TE>   Choose fairly flat-bottomed peppers that can stand up easily. The
rice pilaf is prepared with less water than usual and cooked until
partially done because it finishes cooking inside the peppers. If
you'd like to prepare the pilaf as a side dish, use twice as much
liquid as rice (1 1/2 cups) and cook the rice until it is just
tender, 18 to 20 minutes. Served on its own, the pilaf makes three
portions; you may want to double the recipe.</TE>
<TE>   5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   2 large onions, finely chopped</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup long-grain white rice</TE>
<TE>   4 to 5 tablespoons slivered almonds</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup currants or raisins</TE>
<TE>   2 plum tomatoes, chopped</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons dried mint or 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon ground allspice</TE>
<TE>   1/2 to 1 teaspoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 cups hot chicken or vegetable broth or water</TE>
<TE>   6 or 7 fairly small red, orange or yellow bell peppers (total
about 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 pounds)</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups hot water</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet or stew pan. Add the
onions and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until they
begin to turn golden, 15 minutes; reduce the heat if they brown too
fast.</TE>
<TE>   Add the rice and almonds and stir over low heat to toast them, 5
minutes. Add the currants, tomatoes, mint, allspice, sugar, salt and
pepper to taste; cook for 2 minutes. Add the broth and bring to a
boil. Cover and cook over low heat until the liquid is absorbed, 12
minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning; the rice will not be cooked
yet.</TE>
<TE>   Cut a slice off the stem end of each pepper. Reserve the slice,
leaving the stem on; carefully remove the core and seeds from inside
the pepper. Spoon the stuffing into the peppers and cover with the
reserved pepper slices. Stand the peppers in a baking dish in which
they just fit. Add 1 1/2 cups hot water to the dish. Sprinkle the
peppers with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil. Cover and bake until
the peppers are tender, 1 hour. Serve hot or at room temperature.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Butternut Squash With Sweet Spices</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 50 minutes</TE>
<TE>   If you want a sweeter stew, stir in more sugar to taste or add 1/3
cup raisins and simmer the stew for 5 more minutes to soften them.
You can also use sweet dumpling, kabocha or Mexican calabaza squash.
With acorn or banana squash, which are less sweet, you may want to
add a little more sugar. This can be prepared two or three days
ahead; it reheats well.</TE>
<TE>   2 pounds butternut or other hard-shelled squash</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound tomatoes, peeled, (about 2), or 1 (14-ounce) can
tomatoes</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons oil</TE>
<TE>   1 large onion, chopped</TE>
<TE>   2 large cloves garlic, chopped (optional)</TE>
<TE>   2/3 cup water</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, or more to taste</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon sugar, or more to taste</TE>
<TE>   Dash freshly grated nutmeg or ground cloves (optional)</TE>
<TE>   Peel or cut off the squash skin, remove the seeds and strings, and
cut the meat in 1-inch pieces. If using fresh tomatoes, halve and
seed them, reserving the juice. Drain canned tomatoes, reserving the
juice. Chop the tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a large, deep, heavy saucepan or stew pan. Add the
onion and cook over medium heat until golden, 7 minutes. Add the
garlic and tomatoes and cook uncovered for 5 minutes. Add the squash,
water, salt to taste, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, cinnamon, ginger and
sugar. Stir and bring to a boil. Cover and cook over low heat,
occasionally stirring gently, until the squash is tender, about 30
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   If the sauce is too sweet, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of the reserved
tomato juice. Taste and add nutmeg and more salt, pepper, cinnamon,
ginger or sugar if you like. If the sauce is too thin, uncover and
cook over medium heat until it thickens, 2 or 3 minutes. Serve hot.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leek Compote With Sweet Corn</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 40 minutes</TE>
<TE>   I add corn kernels to this French specialty to accentuate the
leeks' sweetness and contribute color and texture. I also use a
little broth to reduce the amount of fat needed to cook the leeks.
Serve the compote alongside an entree or spoon it onto toasted slices
or rounds of challah as an appetizer.</TE>
<TE>   2 pounds leeks</TE>
<TE>   2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil or vegetable oil</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 to 2 cups corn kernels, fresh or frozen</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons fresh thyme or 1/2 teaspoon dried</TE>
<TE>   1/3 to 1/2 cup chicken or vegetable broth</TE>
<TE>   Use the white, light and medium green parts of the leeks. Cut off
the dark green tops (you can keep them in the refrigerator or freezer
for flavoring soups and stocks).</TE>
<TE>   Rinse the leeks briefly to remove surface dirt. Halve them
lengthwise and rinse under cold water to remove any sand. Cut the
leeks in thin slices. Put in a bowl of cold water and separate the
pieces. Let them stand about 5 minutes, then lift them out of the
water and drain in a colander. If the water is sandy, soak and drain
them again.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a heavy stew pan or deep saucepan. Add the leeks
and salt and pepper to taste. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring
occasionally, 5 minutes. Add the corn, thyme and 1/3 cup broth and
bring to a simmer. Cover and cook, stirring from time to time, until
the vegetables are tender, 15 minutes, adding more broth if the
mixture becomes dry. If the leeks are soupy, uncover and cook,
stirring often, to evaporate the excess liquid. Taste and adjust
seasoning. Serve hot.</TE>

<HD>Espresso, Shaken Not Stirred</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SHAW</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SIENA, Italy</DL>
<LD>Italians take their coffee very seriously, and, in years past, a
tourist's request for iced coffee--caffe freddo, con ghiaccio--has
often been met with glares of either disdain or incomprehension.</LD>
<LD>   No longer. Not in Tuscany, anyway. Except it's not called  caffe
freddo, and it's not limited to tourists. It's called a shakerato,
and it seems to be all the rage in the bars of Tuscany this
summer--the ideal drink on a sweltering afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   You walk into a bar and ask for a shakerato (shake-er-ah-toe), and
the man or woman behind the counter makes a regular espresso. Then he
or she drops four or five ice cubes in a cocktail shaker, adds a
teaspoon of sugar--or more, or less, or none at all, depending on
your preference--puts the top on the shaker and shakes it vigorously.</LD>
<TE>   The shaking action creates a great deal of foam, so when the
shakerato (ice and all) is poured into a glass--an elegant martini
glass in some bars, a simple water glass in others--it's topped by an
enormous, frothy head.</TE>
<TE>   It's a delicious, refreshing drink, and, best of all, it's as easy
to make at home as ... well, iced coffee. If you want, you can even
add a bit of milk before you shake. And when you drink it, you can
pretend you're sitting in a piazza in a small Tuscan village.</TE>

<LD>DEAR SOS: I've been looking for a lemon chicken like the ones you get
at Chinese restaurants. I've tried recipes from the Internet,
supposedly Chinese-style, but they're not close.</LD>
<LD>   I. KIRIYAMA</LD>
<LD>   Gardena</LD>
<TE>   DEAR I.: This is from Ken Hom's "Foolproof Chinese Cooking" (DK
Publishing, 2001). He explains that many versions of this recipe are
too sweet. This one, though, strikes a nice balance between sweetness
and tartness. Instead of the chicken being battered and fried, it is
made using a technique called "velveting" that requires two steps:
The chicken is dipped in a mixture of cornstarch, egg white and salt,
then blanched in water or cooked in hot oil. This adds a protective
cover to the chicken and holds in the juices. It's great for
stir-fries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Send requests to Culinary SOS, Food Section, Los Angeles Times,
202 W. 1st St., Los Angeles, CA 90012 or e-mail to
cindy.dorn@latimes.com. Please include your last name and city of
residence for publication. Include restaurant address when requesting
recipes from restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Classic Lemon Chicken</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 40 minutes</TE>
<TE>   CHICKEN</TE>
<TE>   1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 3x1/2-inch
strips</TE>
<TE>   1 egg white</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon sesame oil</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons cornstarch</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 cups peanut oil or water</TE>
<TE>   Place the chicken strips in a bowl and combine with the egg white,
salt, sesame oil and cornstarch. Refrigerate the mixture for about 20
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   If you are using oil for velveting the chicken, heat a wok until
very hot, and then add the oil. When it is very hot, remove from the
heat and immediately add the chicken, stirring vigorously to prevent
it from sticking. After about 2 minutes, when the chicken turns
white, quickly pour it into a stainless steel colander set over a
bowl to drain off the oil, which should be discarded. If using water
for velveting the chicken, follow the same procedure, but bring the
water to a full boil in a saucepan before adding the chicken. It will
take about 5 minutes to turn white in the water; make sure the
chicken is cooked through.</TE>
<TE>   SAUCE</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup chicken stock</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon light soy sauce</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 tablespoons rice wine or dry sherry</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic</TE>
<TE>   1 to 2 teaspoons dried red pepper flakes</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon cornstarch, blended with 1 teaspoon water</TE>
<TE>   If you have been using a wok, wipe it clean. Heat it over high
heat, then add the stock, lemon juice, sugar, soy sauce, rice wine,
garlic and pepper flakes. Bring to a boil and add the cornstarch
mixture. Simmer for 1 minute.</TE>
<TE>   ASSEMBLY</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons sesame oil</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons finely chopped green onions, to garnish</TE>
<TE>   Return the chicken strips to the wok and cook them long enough to
coat with the sauce, about 1 minute. Mix in the sesame oil, then turn
onto a platter, garnish with the green onions and serve immediately.</TE>

<LD>There's a kind of eerie stillness in the wine country this week--the
calm before the storm. The vines themselves seem to be holding their
breath as the grapes edge toward maturity.</LD>
<LD>   Vintage 2002 hangs in the balance. And there are few places where
the excitement is more palpable than the Stags Leap District of
southeast Napa Valley, where this gentle summer promises to yield
particularly expressive Cabernet Sauvignons.</LD>
<LD>   There are few viticultural environments as distinctive as the
Stags Leap District. Its remarkable interface of geography and
climate brings grapes to a fine maturity, yielding wines that are
rich and powerful yet clearly defined and often elegant.</LD>
<TE>   Stags Leap District took millions of years and countless random
events to form. Back in the old days--the really old days--terra
firma was more like terra soupa. The coastal margin of what humans
would later call California was as much liquid as solid.</TE>
<TE>   Far beneath the mud, land masses crashed together in cataclysmic
slow motion, opening volcanic seams that spewed melted rock and ash.
Gradually the ocean waves created mountain ranges with trough-like
valleys between them, and the Napa Valley was one of the troughs in
the new coastal mountains.</TE>
<TE>   As the two ranges defining the valley continued to rise, the
atmosphere was simultaneously developing, forming a planetary
envelope in which great forces gradually came into the relative
balance we call climate. Rain and floods, and marine incursions, took
over from the volcanoes.</TE>
<TE>   The process isn't over by any means, as Robert Louis Stevenson
pointed out barely more than a century ago: "Here, indeed, all is
new, nature as well as towns. The very hills of California have an
unfinished look; the rains and streams have not yet carved them to
their perfect shape."</TE>
<TE>   Whether it ever achieves that "perfect shape," the Napa Valley
landscape does yield singular wines--it has been mapped according to
subtle but consistent characteristics of wines from different areas
within the valley. The Stags Leap District viticultural area was
among the first to be identified as producing a recognizable
variation of Napa Valley character, particularly in Cabernet
Sauvignon.</TE>
<TE>   That character--a remarkable combination of power and elegance,
softness and structure--became apparent in the 1970s in the Cabernet
of producers such as Stag's Leap Wine Cellars, Clos du Val and Joseph
Heitz (in his Fay Vineyard bottling). It can now also be tasted in
wines from Shafer, Chimney Rock, Stags' Leap Winery and Steltzner,
among others.</TE>
<TE>   The appellation embraces a relatively small area about three miles
long and one mile wide, east of Yountville between the Napa River and
the Vaca Mountains. Unlike the west-side appellations--such as
Yountville, Oakville and Rutherford, which are defined more by
climate than landscape--Stags Leap has a clear physical identity.
There's a sense of entering it and leaving it, and, when inside it,
of looking out at the rest of the valley.</TE>
<TE>   At its southern end, the vineyards bask on open slopes inclined
toward the afternoon sun. Farther north, this open bench land rises
and narrows into broken, convoluted terrain. Corridors through the
hills accelerate air movements, extending the southern valley's
natural air-conditioning and tempering the hot days. And the Stags
Leap geological formation acts as a giant convection unit that pulls
cool air from the bay to a degree not felt in the rest of the valley.</TE>
<TE>   The heat and the marine influence come into extraordinary balance
in a sort of craggy amphitheater at the heart of the district. It's a
valley-within-the-valley where vineyards owned by Stag's Leap Wine
Cellars, Joseph Phelps, Shafer Vineyards and Stags' Leap Winery,
among others, are set off from the main valley by broken ridges in
which Steltzner Vineyards and Pine Ridge Winery also have their own
little vine-filled enclaves.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was no other influence than the water temperature in the
bay, we'd probably be growing Merlot here," observes Chimney Rock
winemaker Doug Fletcher. "Vineyards on the other side, in Yountville
and Oakville, are some of the better Merlot properties around. But
it's warm enough in Stags Leap District for good Cabernet. And the
only explanation for that in my mind is the geological formations
that make Stags Leap. Those big rock outcroppings get the late
afternoon sun, collect the heat and radiate it out at night."</TE>
<TE>   Those outcroppings are also responsible for the second broad
element of the Stags Leap terroir. The soils are primarily volcanic
material that came straight down from the escarpment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about volcanic bedrock," says Robert Brittan, longtime
winemaker at Stags' Leap Winery. "On the other side of the valley
you're looking at some very different bedrocks and a lot more
difference in the composition of soils. You don't see that
variability in Stags Leap. And the volcanic material drives not only
the soil that we grow the grapes in, but the weather, because it's
the heating of those rocks which brings cooler air up from the bay.
Not only that, all our barrels are in a cave dug out of that same
stuff, and that's where the wines mature. So everything about our
wine goes back to that volcanic bedrock."</TE>
<TE>   Volcanic soils typically yield bright, structured wines with firm
tannins and vibrant, often spicy fruit character. A sympathetic
climate can amplify those qualities to a majestic level, and the
summer of '02 has been sympathetic to the point of fawning.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, of course, it is human intervention that turns a
landscape into a vinescape. Selection of plant material, methods of
cultivation and, perhaps most important, timing of the harvest have
everything to do with how the land is expressed in wines.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the essence of that luscious Cabernet in your glass is
essentially water filtered through volcanic soil and transferred into
fruit that ripened slowly and fully in the stony place called Stags
Leap. And something else, too. Aside from the miraculous phenomenon
of ripe fruit from bare rock, there's an ethereal savor of time,
millions of years in every sip.</TE>

<HD>Wine of the Week</HD>
<DH>1997 Val di Suga Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brunello di Montalcino is Chianti Classico's brooding big brother. It
uses a clone of the same Sangiovese grape, but the vineyards around
the medieval hilltop town of Montalcino give a deeper, more opulent
character to the wine. Ever since Count Biondi-Santi "invented"
Brunello in the late 19th century, it has commanded prices that would
make a simple Chianti blush.</LD>
<LD>   Not all Brunellos live up to their aristocratic reputation, but
when they're great, they have the drama and power of a world-class
tenor. For an introduction, try the smooth, luscious, modestly priced
(for a Brunello) 1997 Val di Suga. It carries a haunting scent of
cherries and toasted wood, and the lovely, lingering finish leaves a
taste of dark cherries and plums.</LD>
<LD>   This is a wine for autumn foods: roasted birds (it's not too early
to start thinking turkey), stews and grilled meats.</LD>
<TE>   About $32. Available at many fine wine shops and retailers.</TE>

<DH>Amid the usual debates about their age and relevance, the
Rolling Stones kick off another tour. As Keith Richards says: 'This
is what we do.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Those old steel wheels are turning again. The Rolling Stones,
celebrating their 40th anniversary as a rock 'n' roll enterprise,
kicked off their latest tour here Tuesday night with searing energy
and the always present subplot: How long can this go on?</LD>
<LD>   From the reaction of the devoted at the 19,000-seat Fleet Arena
here, the answer is: As long as the Stones want.</LD>
<LD>   The quintet hit the stage with a vibrant take on "Street Fighting
Man" and the sing-along in the stands almost drowned out Mick
Jagger's vocals on the classic 1968 hit. The crowd, which was
dominated by people old enough to still have stacks of vinyl records
in their garage, screamed with affection at Jagger's every
herky-jerky, praying mantis move.</LD>
<TE>   After mining its 1972 "Exile on Main Street" album for the nugget
"If You Can't Rock Me," the band played its newest single, "Don't
Stop," and it was easy to imagine the song was a mission statement,
not a random selection.</TE>
<TE>   This one-year tour, which reaches Southern California on Halloween
night, has an intriguing wrinkle. Instead of playing just arenas, as
they did on their last tour, or taking the stadium route, as they
have done again and again, the Stones will play in both, as well as
select theaters. The latter has created great excitement among fans,
as well as within the band.</TE>
<TE>   Guitarist Keith Richards, who in recent days has turned his Four
Seasons hotel suite here into a sort of rehearsal room for the band's
entourage, said the intimate theater shows give the Stones a breather
from the strictures of the stadium gigs, which, because of their
scope and special effects, are tightly choreographed.</TE>
<TE>   "What I love about the small gigs is we can turn around and say,
'Let's do "Midnight Rambler," ' without being fixed into a whole show
before you even start," the garrulous guitarist said in an interview
on the eve of the concert.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes on the big stages you feel like you're part of the
mechanics, you feel overwhelmed by the sheer size of the stage. You
try to figure out how to bring some sense of intimacy into a football
stadium. That's always been one of our main quests."</TE>
<TE>   (The Southern California dates are Staples Center on Oct. 31,
Edison Field in Anaheim on Nov. 2 and the Wiltern Theatre in Los
Angeles on Nov. 4.)</TE>
<TE>   Jagger said in a separate interview that the formulation of the
three set lists remained a work in progress this week. He said the
stadium shows will, with "no apologies," veer toward the band's more
recognized hits. The arena shows will have a dash of lesser-known
nuggets and "a thematic" midsection with songs culled from a
particular album, say "Some Girls" or "Exile on Main Street." The
theater shows will include gems mined from deep in the Stones
catalog, such as "Torn and Frayed" and "Winter."</TE>
<TE>   "All of this is total theory," Jagger said with a chuckle as he
outlined the approach. "If it works, it was my idea. If it doesn't,
it was someone else's."</TE>
<TE>   Stones tours have been massive affairs in recent decades and the
novel approach this time has created profound challenges for the band
and its 125-member touring army, which is hitting the road with
dozens of trucks, enough generator power to light up four city blocks
and, literally, tons of gear.</TE>
<TE>   But tour promoter Michael Cohl said those challenges were exactly
what was needed. After all these years, it takes wild horses to drag
these veteran rockers out again.</TE>
<TE>   "It gets harder every time to get them to tour, and the standard
this time became, 'OK, let's tour if we can think of something
interesting, or let's not tour at all.' It was a huge, huge issue
this time.... They are getting a little bit older, there's wear and
tear, the separation from home and all the other things in their
life. There are, you know, other things in life."</TE>
<TE>   It also helps Cohl that he can point out the tour will gross a ton
of money. The Stones hold the record for the highest-grossing U.S.
concert tour ever with $121.2 million in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting on the band's prowess through the years, Cohl, who has
worked with them since 1974, says there is another deterrent to
extending tours into the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   "How should I put it? Rocky Marciano is the only guy to retire
undefeated, right?" Cohl paused and phrased his words carefully.
"There's always a little concern. Have we done enough? Should we even
do one more?"</TE>
<TE>   The Pretenders were the opening act in Boston, but they give way
in upcoming weeks to other famous faces, both old and young, such as
Elvis Costello, No Doubt, Sheryl Crow and the Strokes.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, it will be often-overlooked R&amp;B legend
Solomon Burke (tapped for the tour personally by Richards, a longtime
admirer) for the sold-out Wiltern show. Accompanying acts have not
been announced for the Staples and Edison performances.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the triple-venue approach, the notion of another Stones
tour will elicit groans from the vocal critics who dismiss the band
as a creaky, overly mercenary exercise in nostalgia.</TE>
<TE>   Others--including the sold-out Boston crowd--hear nothing but the
deep songbook of classic rock and marvel at the longevity of the
still-shining Glimmer Twins, Jagger and Richards.</TE>
<TE>   "They still play great and every song reminds me of a moment in my
life," said Max Foley, a 41-year-old fan in from Philadelphia for the
tour kickoff. "Why should they quit?"</TE>
<TE>   Quitting is an unavoidable topic when you have enjoyed as many
bows and encores as the Stones. If group members see any end in sight
to their touring life, they are not giving any clues.</TE>
<TE>   The group has assembled a new greatest-hits package with the
remastered, two-disc "40 Licks," which arrives next month and
includes new tracks "Key to Your Love," "Stealing My Heart," "Don't
Stop" and "Losing My Touch."</TE>
<TE>   The studio time in Paris that yielded those new tracks also left
them with chunks and concepts for two dozen other songs, Jagger says,
and they plan to reassemble next year after the tour to convert that
protean mass into an album.</TE>
<TE>   Jagger and Richards, ages 59 and 58, respectively, have been
described through the years as volatile collaborators and,
considering the band's legendary penchant for debauchery, it is
somewhat amazing that the partnership is alive and kicking. It is not
lost on Richards that the Beatles and the Who have seen one-half of
their founding foursomes lost.</TE>
<TE>   "It's driven home more every year," Richards said. "You see half
of your generation dropping away."</TE>
<TE>   In this opening arena show, the Stones avoided many of the
flamboyant props of the band's stadium shows--a stadium sensibility
even Jagger described as "almost ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   One of Tuesday's highlights was when the biggest band in the world
crowded onto a secondary stage smaller than a single-car garage for a
bluesy, three-song sequence that included "Mannish Boy" and "Brown
Sugar."</TE>
<TE>   Richards was almost as much the center of attention as Jagger,
drawing cheers every time he channeled another one of those classic
Chuck Berry guitar riffs that excited him nearly a half century ago
as a boy in England.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Watts, gentlemanly as ever at the drums, is the only other
original Stone on tour, though guitarist Ron Wood has been with the
band for so long now (since 1975) that many younger fans must assume
that he, too, was with them at the beginning. Bassist Darryl Jones
first toured with the Stones in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Richards offered a warm cackle when asked about the band's health
and stability as it threatens to present the world with a rock band
that might play on toward a 50th anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   "Mental health? You're probably talking to a madman, anyway. It's
all a matter of degree. Emotional health? Hey, when we get down to
work, there's only one thing in our mind, and that's to do it.</TE>
<TE>   "You put things aside or turn around and laugh at each other, say,
'That really isn't an issue,' and you get on with it. These guys,
they ain't no different than they were 20 years ago. Everybody's got
their chops and they wanna do it. After all, this is what we do, you
know?"</TE>

<LD>With the summer season officially over, the box office wilted in its
final week. Not only was the tally down 7% from last August,
attendance was off 10%.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a lackluster August, the summer movie season ended up
grossing 10% more than last year, with a $3.8 billion total from May
3 through Labor Day. Of the major studio films out in August, "Signs"
continues to do well, becoming Mel Gibson's highest-grossing film.</LD>
<LD>   But by this weekend, the independent hit "My Big Fat Greek
Wedding" could displace "Signs" from the No. 1 one spot.</LD>

<HD>Toronto Festival Seeks the Proper Perspective</HD>
<DH>Movies* Terrorist attacks in the U.S. disrupted last year's
screenings. Now, organizers struggle to balance pain and hope.</DH>

<AU>JOHN CLARK</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>This year's Toronto International Film Festival, which kicks off on
Thursday, takes place under the long shadow of Sept. 11, which
interrupted last year's festival midway through and briefly shut it
down.</LD>
<LD>   To what extent the first anniversary will affect the 2002 festival
is a matter of debate, but there's no doubt that last year still
haunts people who were here.</LD>
<LD>   "I never want to go through what I went through last year," says
Piers Handling, the festival's director. "We were under real serious
pressure. I couldn't remember what we had done that day until a month
later."</LD>
<TE>   "It's always going to be a bond between the film people who were
there," says Tom Ortenberg, head of acquisitions and marketing at
Lions Gate Films, who stayed in Toronto for the duration last year
while many others headed home.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from shock and grief, filmmakers, distributors, journalists
and others visiting Toronto that day shared an urgent need to see to
friends and loved ones, so there was a mad rush for car rentals,
train tickets and--for those who could afford it--private aircraft.
Despite this feverish activity, the streets of Toronto were eerily
empty that day, as if the city had been abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   The air went right out of the festival after the terrorist
attacks. The screenings, halted around noon on Sept. 11, resumed the
next day, a decision that initially raised a few eyebrows. No doubt
there were financial reasons for keeping the festival going, but the
overriding sentiment seemed to be that shutting it down would be a
disservice to the public.</TE>
<TE>   The post-attack screenings were well attended, though the normally
enthusiastic Toronto audiences were understandably subdued. Sept. 11
affected the movies too; films that needed a bounce out of the
festival didn't get one.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was devastating to films that were using the festival
as a launching pad and to those that were trying to sell," says Bob
Berney, president of Newmarket Films, who rented a couple of cars
with actress Debra Winger and raced back to New York on Sept. 11.
("She's a really take-charge gal," he says.)</TE>
<TE>   One of the questions about this year's festival is whether the
film slate will be marginalized the same way last year's was.
Certainly the minds of many Americans will be elsewhere. Maybe their
bodies too. "I've talked to a lot of journalists who want to be in
New York on the 11th," Berney says.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, this year's festival cannot ignore what happened a year
ago, but organizers are not about to dedicate the bulk of the
programming to it. Handling and company have decided to delay
screenings on Sept. 11 until 11 a.m., and there will be two Sept.
11-related gala presentations that night: "The Guys," directed by Jim
Simpson, and "11'09"01," a compilation of shorts from 11
international directors.</TE>
<TE>   Both of these films directly address events of Sept. 11, but in
radically different ways.</TE>
<TE>   "The Guys" is the film version of a stage play (being presented in
Los Angeles at the Actors' Gang Theatre with changing casts, launched
by Tim Robbins and Helen Hunt) about a journalist and a fire captain
trying to craft eulogies for his fallen men. It's fairly apolitical.</TE>
<TE>   "11'09"01," on the other hand, bristles with attitude, and some
observers question whether this is really the way the festival should
memorialize the date. "I'm not sure this is the way you commemorate
the death of ... people in America," says Artisan chief executive
Amir Malin, who admits he hasn't seen the film but whose offices are
a few blocks from where the World Trade Center once stood. "It's not
to say this film shouldn't be seen, but I wonder if it should be seen
on 9/11."</TE>
<TE>   In interviews with The Times, some of the directors reject the
idea that their films are in any way anti-American, and Handling
responds by saying that the short films are "very moving, very
respectful, very thoughtful, in some cases very provocative. In light
of what happened on that day, there was a desire for an airing of
opinions from around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it allows us as North Americans to see how people from
Iran, Egypt perceive that day. There may be one or two films that
will cause controversy, which is their right, but I don't think they
are anti-American. I think that's a very pat cliche put-down."</TE>
<TE>   These special events aside, Handling insists that this year will
be business as usual, though in the normal variation of things, the
10-day festival seems to be light on splashy mainstream films (some
years, the studios use the festival to launch serious fall fare). And
there isn't likely to be an acquisitions frenzy, because most of the
high-profile material already has been picked up for distribution or
simply didn't go into production at all, because of the attacks or
the economics of the indie film business.</TE>
<TE>   A number of distributors say they will be looking at their
competitors' films to scout filmmakers they want to do business with
in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, festival-goers don't care about most of this. They've
got 265 feature films to choose from, 195 of which are world or North
American premieres (Sony Pictures Classics alone has 12 entries). And
this year's slate has not only the usual Toronto size and scope (50
countries are represented) but also some intriguing titles by
established filmmakers and performers.</TE>
<TE>   Opening the festival will be Canadian favorite Atom Egoyan with
"Ararat," about the repercussions of the Turkish slaughter of
Armenians around the turn of the century. Brian De Palma closes with
one of his patented delirious thrillers, "Femme Fatale."</TE>
<TE>   In between will be features by a host of high-profile auteurs,
including Paul Schrader's "Auto Focus," about the sordid life and
mysterious violent death of "Hogan's Heroes" star Bob Crane (Greg
Kinnear); Pedro Almodovar's "Talk to Her," a romance about two very
alive guys and two girls in a coma; and David Cronenberg's "Spider,"
which stars Ralph Fiennes as a man in and out of madness.</TE>
<TE>   There will also be a host of recognizable names: Shekhar Kapur's
"Four Feathers" features heartthrob Heath Ledger in swashbuckling
mode; Peter Kosminsky's "White Oleander" stars Michelle Pfeiffer and
Renee Zellweger in an adaptation of the Janet Fitch novel (an Oprah
Winfrey favorite); Joel Schumacher's "Phone Booth" stars Colin
Farrell as a man who makes the mistake of picking up the phone.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Taymor's "Frida" presents Salma Hayek as the tormented
Mexican painter Frida Kahlo. Todd Haynes directs Julianne Moore in
"Far From Heaven," a Douglas Sirk-style melodrama.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Cholodenko's "Laurel Canyon" features Frances McDormand as
rebellious mom. Tom Tykwer's "Heaven" stars Cate Blanchett as a woman
whose act of vengeance kills four people. Curtis Hanson's
work-in-progress, "8 Mile," showcases Eminem in a
semi-autobiographical story set in a hip-hop milieu. And Bruce
Beresford's "Evelyn" features Pierce Brosnan as a working-class lad
trying to recover his kids.</TE>
<TE>   A number of American actors are here as directors: Matt Dillon
with "City of Ghosts," about a con artist who wants to go straight;
Robert Duvall, who mixes tango and skulduggery in "Operation Tango";
and Denzel Washington with "The Antwone Fisher Story," based on
memoirs of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   There's a British contingent represented here as well: Jim
Sheridan ("In America"), Mike Leigh ("All or Nothing"), Ken Loach
("Sweet Sixteen") and Stephen Frears ("Dirty Pretty Things").</TE>
<TE>   Among foreign-language entries: Francois Ozon's "8 Women," a
musical with an all-star lineup that includes Catherine Deneuve;
Daniele Thompson's "Jet Lag," with Juliette Binoche; Aki Kaurismaki's
"Man Without a Past"; Fernando Meirelles' "City of God"; sexual
provocateur Catherine Breillat's "Sex Is Comedy"; Patrice Leconte's
"L'Homme du train"; Chen Kaige's "Together"; and Lukas Moodysson's
"Lilja 4-ever."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens at this year's festival, it's fair to say that
some movies will be politicized in a way they may not have been in
years past. Eugene Jarecki's documentary "The Trials of Henry
Kissinger" and Michael Moore's "Bowling for Columbine," which
explores America's gun culture and penchant for violence, are overtly
political.</TE>
<TE>   But others, like Paul Justman's "Standing in the Shadows of
Motown," about the Funk Brothers, the unheralded musicians who
supplied the heartbeat for Motown's great '60s hits, may acquire a
meaning not originally intended. "Motown" will premiere on Sept. 11.
"We asked that the film be placed on 9/11," says Artisan's Malin,
whose company is distributing it. "I think Motown music was a great
American export. I wanted to be able to have something on 9/11 that
celebrates America."</TE>

<HD>Curtain Rises on Domingo's Act II</HD>
<DH>Music* L.A. Opera finds itself at a crossroads as it begins
the second season programmed by its star leader. Funding is sought
for accelerated expansion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Opera began its 2001-02 season with a ticket revenue
crisis caused by Sept. 11 and  the abrupt resignation of its unhappy
executive director, Ian White-Thomson. It ended the season with the
temperamental Gian-Carlo del Monaco, director of "Turandot," hurling
an object--by most reports a soda bottle--at a stage manager.</LD>
<LD>   It was also the season the company announced the postponement of a
wildly ambitious project--a production of Wagner's "Ring" with
special effects from George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic--from
2003 to 2006. Cost estimates for that extravaganza range as high as
$60 million. And the season that the company's much-vaunted Young
Artists program failed to materialize, again for lack of money.</LD>
<LD>   Despite such tribulations, the company's first schedule created by
artistic director Placido Domingo, at the helm since July 2000, ended
in the black, with brisk late-season ticket sales resulting in a
$150,000 surplus.</LD>
<TE>   Now it's time for the 2002-03 season--it opens tonight at the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion with Puccini's "The Girl of the Golden
West"--and in terms of offstage drama it is shaping up to be no less
operatic.</TE>
<TE>   In a holdover from last season's game of toss-the-bottle, Del
Monaco, originally scheduled to direct "Girl of the Golden West," was
not invited back. He was replaced by a team of directors: Vera
Calabria, who served as associate director for last season's "Queen
of Spades," and Elena Kalabakos, a longtime Del Monaco associate.</TE>
<TE>   And less than two weeks ago, a lack of ready cash led the opera to
cancel October's much-anticipated $3-million production of
Prokofiev's "War and Peace," imported from the Kirov Opera in St.
Petersburg, Russia. The company has replaced it with a less expensive
Kirov production, Shostakovich's "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk."</TE>
<TE>   Ticket-holders can see "Lady Macbeth," exchange their tickets for
a different L.A. Opera production or get a refund. So far, $5,000
worth of tickets, in an advance sale of $1.5 million, have been
canceled.</TE>
<TE>   High-tech investment mogul Alberto Vilar, acknowledged as the
leading donor for opera worldwide, had pledged $1 million to "War and
Peace," which he also supported at its Kirov premiere and subsequent
productions in London and New York, investing a total of $4 million,
by his calculation.</TE>
<TE>   But Vilar put his foot down when he was asked to cough up not just
the promised $1 million in L.A. but also another $600,000 to pay for
adapting the massive production to the Pavilion stage. He also
declined when asked to move up the payment on his $1-million pledge
to cover advance costs of bringing some 400 Kirov soloists, chorus
and orchestra members to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Opera observers look at the company's ups and downs and point to
the fact that L.A. Opera, a young company with a relatively small
endowment, is attempting exponential growth. Its annual operating
budget increased from $20 million to $30 million in the 2001-02
season and hovers at about the same level for 2002-2003. Looking
forward to when the Los Angeles Philharmonic decamps for Walt Disney
Concert Hall and L.A. Opera can make more use of the Pavilion,
Domingo has plans that would require doubling that figure within six
years.</TE>
<TE>   Marc Scorca, president of the Washington-based service
organization Opera America, says many American opera companies have
experienced similar rapid expansion--and strained budgets--in recent
years as they attempt to keep up with the art form's resurgent
popularity.</TE>
<TE>   But Scorca acknowledges that, when it comes to "the stratosphere"
occupied by L.A. Opera, even the most common problem becomes larger
than life. "With Mr. Domingo and the size of the opera, it creates a
factor of two. It's the result of scale, and celebrity," he says.
All in all, since the appointment of Domingo, the offstage scene at
L.A. Opera, now in its 17th season, continues to have an uncommonly
dramatic, er, tenor.</TE>
<TE>   Domingo declined to be interviewed for this story; Marc I. Stern,
L.A. Opera's board president, acknowledged that life with the
globe-hopping superstar is anything but dull. "I'm so excited about
what we can do here in L.A. if we can pull everything together," he
said. "The worst thing that we could do is be boring. The price of
that is, you have to take chances. It's a wonderfully dynamic
situation, but not one where we can always totally chart our course."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Opera has an endowment of about $8 million. Ideally,
Scorca says, an opera company's endowment should be 200% of the
budget. But he adds, most have not achieved that goal. New York's
119-year-old Metropolitan Opera has an endowment of $275 million
against an operating budget of $200 million. Seventy-nine-year-old
San Francisco Opera has an endowment of $36 million, just more than
half of its $62-million annual budget.</TE>
<TE>   He also notes that opera observers should not assume opera
companies can borrow from their endowments to pay their bills; those
funds are restricted to generate interest income. But a larger
endowment produces higher interest income that can be used to cover
shortfalls. It's the type of money that might have been used to cover
the extra $600,000 needed to cover the cost of adapting the stage for
"War and Peace."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, if the show were to go on, the company would have had to
come up with another donor, and fast. Company artistic administrator
Edgar Baitzel called such a task difficult in tight economic times
and added that since the opera had committed to bill the production
as "underwritten by Alberto Vilar," it would be awkward to
acknowledge an additional donor.</TE>
<TE>   Opera America's Scorca scoffs at the notion that there is
something shocking in Los Angeles Opera's decision to cancel "War and
Peace" in favor of a production that will cost $1 million less. "Arts
organizations are accused of not being run in a businesslike fashion,
but the minute someone makes a businesslike decision, people start
wringing their hands about it," Scorca complained.</TE>
<TE>   Baitzel said that L.A. Opera began exchanging information with
Metropolitan Opera about possible additional staging costs as early
as last January. Still, there are those who wonder how L.A. Opera
could have been caught by surprise by added costs for such a huge
production, since they have occurred everywhere the Kirov production
has traveled. "The major technical stumbling block is an enormous
domed floor which suggests the top of the world, and has a number of
hydraulic elements," said Joe Clark, technical director for the
Metropolitan Opera, which presented "War and Peace." "It's a big
piece of scenery that has to fit together quite precisely, and do
tricks."</TE>
<TE>   Clark said the Met, a co-producer of "War and Peace," realized it
would have to create its own version of the floor that could be moved
on- and offstage quickly, since unlike the Kirov Opera it performs
several operas in repertory.  Plus, with its bigger stage and house,
the Met wanted to create an even more spectacular production than the
original in St. Petersburg, adding extra cast members and even
animals. While animals themselves don't add much expense, the new
domed floor had to be strong enough to accommodate a galloping horse.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the kind of production that you can move easily from
theater to theater," Clark said. "We sent [set] drawings back and
forth to colleagues in Los Angeles, and I said: 'I'm not sure you
don't have more or less the same problems we have.' "</TE>
<TE>   Finger-pointing about whether the opera company should have known
better, however, would be rendered moot if the company had better
cash flow--and did not rely so heavily on one donor, Vilar, a close
friend of Domingo, to fund its most ambitious endeavors.</TE>
<TE>   Said board president Stern: "The first thing I need to do is raise
money. The second thing I have to do is go after a series of new
donors. One of the things we need to do, and will do, is diversify
our support base; we are spending a lot of time and effort on that."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Vilar promised $10 million to L.A. Opera for new
productions--the largest single donation in the opera's history. The
$1 million for "War and Peace" was to have been part of that
long-term gift. Vilar also committed to paying $1 million to start up
the Young Artists program. In the past two years, he has funded
similar institutes at Washington Opera--where Domingo also serves as
artistic director--and at London's Royal Opera.</TE>
<TE>   Vilar says that when L.A. Opera starts up its program, he will
fund it. L.A. Opera says it can't start the program without having
the money in advance. "It's a chicken-and-egg situation," says the
opera company's Baitzel.</TE>
<TE>   Vilar's company, Amerindo Investments Inc., has nose-dived from
managing assets of $5.5 billion at the beginning of 2000 to a current
$1.1 billion. But Vilar said his decision to invest no further in
"War and Peace" had nothing to do with inability to pay. Rumors
persist that Vilar has not met all of his commitments to arts
organizations worldwide, even though those organizations report that
he has paid according to schedule.</TE>
<TE>   And Vilar expressed disappointment that so far Los Angeles Opera
has not used his promised funds for new productions, but has asked
permission to use the money for rented productions, such as last
season's "Lohengrin"--and "War and Peace."  L.A. Opera expects $1.5
million of the $2-million cost of bringing in "Lady Macbeth" to be
covered by ticket sales, and is raising funds for the rest. "Our
problem is we need the money while the Kirov is here, and we know Mr.
Vilar cannot commit himself to our payment schedule. We are not
counting on his money at this point," Baitzel said.</TE>
<TE>   "Someday I'd like to go back to my original intention, which was
to have them build up their repertoire," Vilar said. "The Met has six
operas in its warehouse that I paid for. I definitely remain
committed to Los Angeles; I'd love to see opera flourish in the West.
But I will be disappointed at the end of five or  10 years if I can't
go into their warehouse and say: 'See that one and that one and that
one--they're mine, and I gave them to you.' "</TE>
<TE>   Several L.A. Opera board members say the board remains solidly in
favor of his risk-taking moves. "It is a happy board," said Nick
Ciriello, who has been on the board since the company began.</TE>
<TE>   Alicia Garcia Clark, a board member who heads up the opera support
group Hispanics for Los Angeles Opera, adds that the board endorsed
the decision to replace "War and Peace" with an unusual and
still-expensive Kirov production instead of the tried-and-true.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's exciting to have the Kirov," Clark said. "We could
have presented a 'Madama Butterfly' or one of the standard operas
that we know and love, but it would not have been anything new, it
wouldn't have attracted new people. In order to expand the opera, we
have to have more and more people coming to see it."</TE>

<HD>A Fitting Tribute to a Little-Known Cuban Music Great</HD>
<DH>Groups at the Jazz Bakery honored pianist and composer
Frank Emilio Flynn, who died last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A year after his death in Havana, the long, legendary life of Cuban
pianist-composer Frank Emilio Flynn was celebrated at the Jazz Bakery
on Monday night in a nonstop succession of fine Latin jazz groups.</LD>
<LD>   It was a worthwhile recognition of an artist too little known in
this country. Flynn, who died at 80 last year, participated in all
the significant eras of Cuban popular music, from the descargas of
the '30s through the sounds of the orquesta tipicas and into the
rhythmic, improvisatory settings of Afro-Cuban jazz. He's often been
described as a kind of "one-man Buena Vista Social Club."</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, the program proceeded without one of the scheduled
headliners: saxophonist Jane Bunnett, who had a schedule conflict
that kept her from the gig. On the up side, players such as
percussionist Juan "Long John" Oliva, pianist Paul de Castro, young
Cuban pianist Fermin Sifontes, flutist Danilo Lozano and, especially,
percussionist Bob Fernandez with the CSULA Latin Jazz Ensemble made
for a thoroughly entertaining evening.</LD>
<TE>   There was an odd kind of synchronicity between the Flynn
celebration and the Sweet &amp; Hot Music Festival of the past weekend.
Both events acknowledged the firm connections between music and
dance: swing and jitterbugging in the latter; Afro-Cuban rhythms and
salsa in the former. And both events saw audience members unable to
resist the temptation to get on their feet and move with the music.</TE>
<TE>   The climax of the Flynn program featured Fernandez and the
talented young players in the CSULA Latin Jazz Ensemble (directed by
De Castro). There was powerful symbolism in the presence of these
young artists, taking the music handed to them by Flynn and his
contemporaries and moving it into the future. Open to new
ideas--there were passages of striking, but fascinating
dissonance--the CSULA ensemble also maintained firm contact with its
Afro-Cuban roots.</TE>
<TE>   And one suspects that had he heard the ensemble in action,
Flynn--one of Latin jazz's most important nurturing figures--would
have been delighted that his efforts have produced such impressive,
long-term results.</TE>

<LD>Michael Shermer, publisher of Skeptic magazine and director of the
Skeptics Society, has an idea for a TV show that would debunk
psychics, faith healers and other mysterious phenomena that he deems
a fraud or simply explainable in less-than-supernatural terms.</LD>
<LD>   So far, no one has bitten. And surveying the TV landscape, it's
not hard to understand why--the strange and unexplained having been
very, very good to television, providing scant incentive to suggest
otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   "Crossing Over With John Edward," whose host purports to
communicate with the dead, is a modest hit in syndication and on the
Sci-Fi Channel. Last spring, ABC ran a similar prime-time special,
"Contact: Talking to the Dead," and CBS did well ratings-wise with
the miniseries "Living With the Dead." Finally, let's not forget Miss
Cleo, Kenny Kingston and other late-night TV psychics who must
generate plenty of calls, at $3.99 a minute, to justify all those
commercials geared to advice-seeking insomniacs.</LD>
<TE>   CBS' miniseries was very loosely based on spiritual medium James
Van Praagh, the latest paranormal practitioner to follow Edward into
the mysterious but potentially lucrative dimension of TV syndication.
"Beyond With James Van Praagh" premieres Sept. 16, courtesy of
Tribune Entertainment, which has placed the show on many
Tribune-owned TV stations, including KTLA in Los Angeles. And yes,
sweet spirit, that would be the same Tribune that owns the Los
Angeles Times.</TE>
<TE>   As I learned after writing about "Crossing Over"--and nasty
e-mails are still dribbling in, almost a year later--believers in
psychics cling passionately to that view, and I wouldn't expect or
wish to shake their faith even if I could.</TE>
<TE>   Still, one would think, or at least hope, there would be room on
TV for naysayers, for those willing to propose alternative theories
that don't require opening up your mind--and pocketbook--to someone
relaying messages from a father figure who might be Uncle Ralph
gabbing from the grave.</TE>
<TE>   Shermer, in fact, was briefly associated with such an
enterprise--a since-defunct series for the then-Fox Family Channel
titled "Exploring the Unknown." Featured among the segments was a
bogus psychic who admits his "abilities" are a con, impressing
subjects by asking earnestly during every reading, "Who's Charles?"
As he later explained, if it's a miss, keep talking fast and press
onward, but almost everyone comes back with, "My sister's husband" or
"My brother's best friend."</TE>
<TE>   It was hard not to think about that while previewing episodes of
Van Praagh's new program, especially when he asks actor Wesley Snipes
during a celebrity segment, "Who's Jimmy?" Snipes identifies the name
as his late grandfather, and in a subsequent interview says he's
convinced.</TE>
<TE>   Sorry, that wouldn't do it for me. I know a Chuck or Charles and a
Jimmy or James, and my guess is you do too.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty sure they won't have any skeptics on the show," Sher-
mer said.</TE>
<TE>   Based on an initial sampling, no, they won't. The opening credits
certainly make no bones about Van Praagh's being able to do precisely
what he claims, touting his "extraordinary psychic ability" as "your
connection to the world beyond." If that isn't enough, during
readings text along the bottom of the screen says definitive things
like "James is communicating with her deceased father" to help the TV
audience keep up.</TE>
<TE>   Donna Harrison, Tribune's senior vice president for unscripted and
reality programming, says most of the staff, herself included, was
skeptical going in and that she has since been won over. Still, she
said, "We're not out to preach or convert anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Although episodes are edited for time, Harrison maintains the
program takes pains to ensure that Van Praagh doesn't receive
information in advance. What the show does offer is a lot of maudlin
music and a torrent of tears, as Van Praagh talks to dead spouses,
children, even one fellow's deceased German shepherd ("He misses the
car rides," Van Praagh tells him).</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious that it's canned and edited and staged," Shermer
contends, noting that Van Praagh deftly covers up incorrect
observations and makes statements "that can mean any number of
things," such as saying a woman's late mother is "larger than life."</TE>
<TE>   In one episode, Van Praagh delves into a triple-homicide before
engaging in a reading with the teenage victims' distraught relatives.
"Unsolved murder mysteries are great, because he can say anything and
they don't know," Shermer said.</TE>
<TE>   Given all the tears shed, subjects clearly draw comfort from
feeling their loved ones are somehow with them. In that respect,
"Beyond" may intrigue men with its paranormal elements but
principally aims at women accustomed to absorbing personal stories of
loss and grief in soap operas, newsmagazines and talk shows.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a lot of the emotional storytelling that women are used
to seeing and want to see in daytime," Harrison said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even if it's a performance--a stage show by someone who admits
to having a theatrical background--many will doubtless say, "Where's
the harm?"</TE>
<TE>   "What's the harm with alcohol and drugs, and removing yourself
from reality with a fantasy just to make yourself feel good?" Shermer
said. "In my opinion, it's a scam.... He's playing with people's
emotions. I think it's deplorable--an insult to the dead and the
living."</TE>
<TE>   At the least, programs such as "Beyond" and "Crossing Over"
provide hope to people desperate to contact those who have "passed
over"--potentially bolstering their belief in others who might offer
the same service for a fee. From that perspective, stations airing
these programs would seem duty-bound, in the interest of fairness, to
cultivate dissenting views.</TE>
<TE>   Don't look for equal time, however, within "Beyond." "There are a
lot of fakes, there are a lot of charlatans out there.... I can't
control the rip-off artists," Tribune's Harrison said. "I can only
control the integrity of this program."</TE>
<TE>   Van Praagh, meanwhile, seeks to dispel any doubt as to his
legitimacy, reminding viewers at each show's close to "forget what
you know and believe what you see."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it's just my cynical nature, but all I can see beyond the
tears and piano music are dollar signs, and all I know is that as a
Tribune employee and stockholder, I couldn't be prouder.</TE>

<HD>Citing Arts' Power, Arthur Miller Accepts International
Prize</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Calling the arts "a highway into the soul of the people," playwright
Arthur Miller accepted an international prize Tuesday, an honor
deferred once by Sept. 11 and a second time by the illness of his
late wife.</LD>
<LD>   A six-nation panel of advisors gave Miller its Praemium Imperiale
prize to honor a body of work that has spanned more than half a
century and that includes "Death of a Salesman" and "The Crucible,"
both standards of American theater.</LD>
<LD>   The panel was to announce the award last Sept. 14 in France but
canceled after the terrorist attacks that month.</LD>
<TE>   Miller missed the October award ceremony in Tokyo because of the
sudden illness of his wife, photographer Inge Morath, who later died.</TE>
<TE>   He accepted the prize Tuesday at a special luncheon in Manhattan,
delivering a short speech on the power of the arts to unlock the
secrets of global cultures.</TE>
<TE>   "When the cannons have stopped firing, and the great victories of
finance are reduced to surmise and are long forgotten, it is the art
of the people that will confront future generations," he said. "The
arts can do more to sustain the peace than all the wars, the
armaments and the threats and the warnings of the politicians."</TE>

<LD>   Vilar: No Respect From British Beneficiaries?</LD>
<LD>   Alberto Vilar's recent refusal to shell out additional funding for
the Los Angeles Opera production of "War and Peace" resulted in the
cancellation of the engagement and made headlines nationwide. Now the
arts benefactor is making waves again with a tirade against the
British government, the BBC reports.</LD>
<TE>   Though he's given the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden about
$39.1 million in support and pledges in recent years, he's getting no
respect, Vilar maintains.</TE>
<TE>   "In Germany and Austria, the chancellor and the president invite
me to dinner and have given me honors--but here in Britain, nobody in
government has called me up," he was reported as saying in London's
Sunday Times. "Nobody has talked to me. The pendulum is swinging
against public funding and, once there are cutbacks, they will really
need people like me. Rich people need to be persuaded or even shamed
into giving. But governments and recipients also need to remember the
two most important words--thank you."</TE>
<TE>   Though he'll continue to support the Royal Opera, Vilar added, he
won't forget what he considers the shoddy treatment. The government
would come to regret its "short-sightedness," the Cuban American
philanthropist maintained.</TE>
<TE>   New Art Exhibitions</TE>
<TE>   on Display in Las Vegas</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas, home of Wayne Newton and scantily clad showgirls, is
fast becoming a magnet for art.</TE>
<TE>   Paintings by Titian and Tintoretto, re-created on the ceilings of
the Venetian hotel-casino, are now on display at the venue's
Guggenheim Hermitage Museum through March 2. And an exhibit featuring
Faberge imperial eggs opened over the weekend at the Bellagio hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Spanning more than 500 years, the year-old Venetian's second
exhibit provides a historical glimpse into paintings from 1436 to
1965. The value of the works on display ranges from $5 million to
$100 million, said Sheldon Adelson, chairman of the hotel's parent
company, Las Vegas Sands Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen of the works came from the State Hermitage Museum in St.
Petersburg, Russia, and were chosen in part for their portrayal of
Russia's history. Willem de Kooning's 1955 "Composition" and Roy
Lichtenstein's "Grrrrrrrrrrr!!" are also included.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an experiment for all of us," museum director Thomas
Krens said. "It's an unusual concept to condense six centuries into
39 works, but it's an exciting ride."</TE>
<TE>   Massachusetts Reeling in Wake of Arts Cuts</TE>
<TE>   The Massachusetts arts community is attempting to regroup after
last week's announcement that a fiscal crunch necessitated a 65% drop
in arts funding by the state. Grants were reduced from $15.6 million
in 2001 to $5.9 million this year.</TE>
<TE>   The Massachusetts Cultural Council cuts touched nearly every part
of the state, from small neighborhood theaters and music groups to
major cultural institutions such as the Boston Symphony Orchestra,
the New England Aquarium, the Museum of Fine Arts and the Boston
Ballet. Arts advocates blamed the reductions on acting Gov. Jane
Swift. But her spokesman, James Borghesani, said that a dramatic drop
in state revenue forced tough cuts in all areas, including the arts.</TE>

<TE>   Nirvana's Greatest Hits Edging Toward Release</TE>
<TE>   There's an apparent breakthrough in the two-year legal battle
between Nirvana band members Kurt Novoselic and Dave Grohl and
Courtney Love, widow of lead singer Kurt Cobain, who committed
suicide in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the group say that the three are working toward
an amicable agreement that would permit Universal Music Group to put
out a one-disc greatest hits album before the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   According to Rolling Stone, the CD would include "You Know You're
Right," the song Nirvana recorded less than three months before
Cobain's death.</TE>
<TE>   Love claimed that Cobain's heirs should have control over the
band's legacy, since he was the band's principal songwriter.
Novoselic and Grohl argued that the band had functioned as a
partnership and should continue to do so. The conflict had precluded
the release of a Nirvana box set last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the second volume of U2's "Best of " collection,
covering the years 1990-2000, will be released Nov. 5 by Interscope
Records. It will include two new tracks recorded for this set: "The
Electrical Storm" and "The Hands That Built America."</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Renowned choreographer William Forsythe, artistic director of the
prestigious Frankfurt Ballet, has announced that he will not renew
his contract when it expires in 2004. The move follows years of
dissatisfaction with what he perceives as the city's arts-averse
cultural policy and cuts in subsidies to his company....Freddie
Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar were married in a private
ceremony in Jalisco, Mexico, on Sunday....Mariah Carey and a team of
songwriters did not steal the work of two other composers when she
recorded "Thank God I Found You," U.S. District Judge Christina
Snyder ruled in Los Angeles on Tuesday....  Todd Leavitt, a former
NBC executive who runs his own media consulting firm, has been named
president of the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences, the nonprofit
group that presents the nighttime Emmy Awards. He'll assume the post
in mid-October.</TE>

<HD>Can 20 Literate Novels Yield 1 Good Film?</HD>
<DH>Movies* Patrick O'Brian fans feel hope and horror about the
Fox project, starring Russell Crowe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN RINGLE</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>ROSARITO, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Fox Studios Baja sits beside one of Mexico's dirtiest, most
litter-strewn roadways, about 25 miles south of the U.S. border.
Across the street teeters a phalanx of thrown-together shacks crowded
with rusting lawn ornaments and terra-cotta palm pots. Within the
guarded studio gate, a 20-foot-tall inflatable monkey wobbles astride
the replica turret blown from the replica battleship Arizona in Fox's
cinematic version of "Pearl Harbor," which was filmed here.</LD>
<LD>   It's a stunningly improbable setting in which to contemplate the
novels of Patrick O'Brian, whose highly literate 20-book
Aubrey-Maturin saga celebrates the wondrous, the noble and the
poignantly heroic in man, and is currently being filmed, at least in
part, here.</LD>
<LD>   The $135-million motion picture is "The Far Side of the World," a
cinematic treatment of the 10th of O'Brian's tales of the British
Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. It stars Russell Crowe, the
Oscar-winning actor of "A Beautiful Mind," as Capt. "Lucky Jack"
Aubrey and is directed by Australian Peter Weir, whose acclaimed
films include "Gallipoli," "The Year of Living Dangerously," "Dead
Poets Society," "Witness," "The Mosquito Coast" and, most recently,
"The Truman Show."</LD>
<TE>   The cast includes Paul Bettany (Crowe's college roommate in "A
Beautiful Mind") as Aubrey's surgeon-spy companion, Stephen Maturin
and Billy Boyd (Pippin in "The Lord of the Rings") as Aubrey's
coxswain, Barrett Bonden.</TE>
<TE>   Shooting began in June and is expected to conclude by November,
with release of the film possible late next year.</TE>
<TE>   For O'Brian's millions of passionate worldwide fans, what's
happening here is a constant subject both of hope and of horror. They
fear that no film project could ever do justice to O'Brian's novels,
whose mischievous erudition resembles an improbable blend of Jane
Austen, C.S. Forester, Charles Dickens and Marcel Proust.</TE>
<TE>   The books carry Aubrey and Maturin on global adventures afloat and
ashore during a somewhat elastic 15-year period when the Royal Navy
is contending with Napoleon's ambitions in Europe and, for a while,
with the fledgling U.S. Navy. Layered beneath Aubrey's erratic climb
through the naval ranks are profound explorations of life and the
human heart. Richard Snow, editor of American Heritage Magazine,
writing in the New York Times, described the series as "the greatest
historical novels ever written."</TE>
<TE>   So ardent and proprietary are O'Brian readers that long before the
author died in Dublin in January 2000, entire Web sites were devoted
to fantasy suggestions for which actors, living or dead, could best
play the swashbuckling Aubrey, the secretive Maturin and others in
O'Brian's galaxy of memorable characters.</TE>
<TE>   But rather than reassuring or involving this literary fan base, as
Warner Bros. did with pre-"Harry Potter" blitzes, Fox has attempted
Ft. Knox-level secrecy. Last November, for example, a studio
spokesman denied that any O'Brian picture was in preparation even as
Weir's wife confirmed from Australia that the director was in London
casting the film.</TE>
<TE>   More than 300 extras have been hired for the fight scenes, and a
reasonably clear picture of the movie-making emerges from willing, if
cautious, cast members and workers despite the best efforts of studio
lawyers and the "40-some" executives Fox publicist Sandy O'Neill says
must approve any statement to or access by the press.</TE>
<TE>   "What everybody but Fox executives seems to realize," said one
extra, "is that with 5 million O'Brian books in print in this
country, never mind those worldwide, O'Brian's readers are in a
position to either make or break this film. And that decision is
presently balanced on a pinhead."</TE>
<TE>   That pinhead is the mysterious 400-page script penned by Weir,
John Collee and Larry Ferguson that reportedly changes daily. By best
accounts, it is a kind of O'Brian pastiche, in which the more
provocative ingredients of the 20 volumes are pasted onto a plot
drawn largely from "The Far Side of the World."</TE>
<TE>   That O'Brian book sent Aubrey, Maturin and the Surprise around
Cape Horn during the War of 1812 in an effort to sink or capture an
American warship preying on British whalers in the Pacific. Weir
apparently decided that compared with the fleet actions, exotic
locales and intricate and crowded period settings of most O'Brian
books, the more limited scope of "Far Side of the World" lent itself
better to budgetary realities.</TE>
<TE>   Fox marketers reportedly worry that, abbreviated on theater
marquees, "Far Side" might lead moviegoers to think it's a Gary
Larson movie. They also decided the American public would never hold
still for the United States as the enemy (have they never heard of
"Madama Butterfly"?), so the Norfolk has been renationalized as the
French vessel Acheron.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently the Acheron facade--masts and rigging are abbreviated,
its bowsprit ends in splinters and scaffolding props it up--will be
used for close-up deck and warfare scenes. In the 8 1/2-acre seaside
pond-tank where "Titanic" met its iceberg sits a full-size replica of
Aubrey and Maturin's favorite ship, the frigate Surprise.</TE>
<TE>   (The studio spent $1.5 million to purchase the Rose, a replica of
an 18th century British warship, and remade it as the Surprise. It is
docked south of here in Ensenada.)</TE>
<TE>   Aside from cut-rate Mexican craft salaries, the tank built for
"Titanic" is the biggest reason for shooting here. When filled to the
brim, its seaside edge disappears in an optical illusion and its
surface appears to stretch unbroken to the far ocean horizon.</TE>
<TE>   The replica Surprise perches on a giant underwater tripod equipped
with gadgets to rock, tilt, spin and shake the ship while house-size
fans and jets pummel it with wind. Nearby stand four 50-foot,
400-gallon water tanks that can vomit giant waves. Fake storms will
be augmented by shots of real ones captured last spring by a crew
that rounded Cape Horn in the Endeavor, a square-rigged replica of
the vessel that carried Capt. James Cook around the world in the
1760s.</TE>
<TE>   The actors are shuttled between the facade ships here and
Ensenada, where they board the Rose-Surprise for helicopter shots of
sail furling and cannon firing.</TE>
<TE>   Hard-core O'Brianites might fear a generic Hollywood dumbing down
of the books and characters they love ("none of the Fox people has
read the books," claims one terminally pessimistic insider, "and they
wouldn't understand them if they had"), but Weir, at least, appears
deeply immersed in O'Brian's world. He reportedly combed Britain,
Canada, Scandinavia and Poland in quest of "tired faces" for his
sailors.</TE>

<LD>The Shrine Auditorium, that venerable 1926 hall near Exposition Park,
has empty nest syndrome. Walking through the building, now nearing
the end of a $10-million make-over, Shrine manager and historical
consultant Andy Stamatin sounds like a parent fixing up the house in
hopes that the kids will come home after college.</LD>
<LD>   "We're designing this for the Emmys, and the Oscars--when they
come back," Stamatin says, showing off the newly refurbished seats,
repainted offices and dressing rooms, the array of just-planted palm
trees and antique lighting outside the entrance.</LD>
<LD>   It's all part of a five-year plan to sharpen up the building,
which is on the National Register of Historic Places, within
restrictions for historic landmarks.</LD>
<TE>   At the Shrine, which will host the Emmy Awards on Sept. 22, most
of the recent work is on parts of the theater not obvious to the
public eye: the seats with their crumbling cushions, wood floors that
needed a major sanding, and a green room and backstage that had gone
a bad shade of white. The outside of the building, which had drifted
to cottage white, is back to the beige/stone palette that the
restorers think is closer to its original color.</TE>
<TE>   "The new work hasn't been about Kodak or Staples Center," says
Doug Worthington, the hall's general manager, naming the auditoriums
to which the Shrine has recently lost the Oscars and the Grammy
awards, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   What the Shrine has that the Kodak Theatre and Staples Center
never will is a history that goes back to King Kong (scenes from the
1933 movie were filmed there), early Elvis Presley, Sammy Davis Jr.
and Frank Sinatra (who celebrated his 80th birthday at the Shriners'
Moorish palace).</TE>
<TE>   At the time of its opening, the Shrine--with 6,300 seats--was the
largest theater in the world; it's still the largest in the country.</TE>

<LD>What is "I, Detective," a new series premiering tonight at 9:30 on
Court TV?</LD>
<LD>   (A) a documentary</LD>
<LD>   (B) a murder mystery</LD>
<TE>   (C) a quiz show</TE>
<TE>   (D) all of the above</TE>
<TE>   The correct answer is D, which also stands for "disquieting,"
"disconcerting" or "disturbing"--take your pick.</TE>
<TE>   The basic premise of "I, Detective" is to reconstruct a real-life
crime and retrace the steps investigators took to solve the case,
with interviews and reenactments providing the bulk of the program.
Countless TV documentaries have followed this formula, for better or
worse; at least it keeps former law enforcement officials, faceless
actors and composers of sinister background music off the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Where this show differs from its predecessors, however, is in its
use of intermittent multiple-choice quizzes, designed to make the
program more interactive. Sometimes the questions test general
knowledge, such as which poison smells like bitter almonds; others
are based on viewer comprehension or analysis. If you still suffer
from trauma in connection with high school or college entrance exams,
this might not be a good show for you.</TE>
<TE>   Joking aside, though, the quiz gimmick points up the troubling
issues surrounding any portrayal of real-life crime, and therefore
actual victims and their families and friends, in a program that is
essentially entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's installment focuses on the 1986 investigation of the
death of Sue Snow in Seattle. Snow died after taking painkillers
laced with cyanide, and though initial clues pointed to her husband,
he was cleared when the investigation became much wider.</TE>
<TE>   You have to wonder how horrific it must be for the victims'
survivors, if they tune in, to relive the trauma of 16 years ago--and
pick logical answers related to deaths that were senseless.</TE>

<LD>Lobsters--A California section story Aug. 16 about two men accused of
catching undersized lobsters off San Clemente Island incorrectly
described comments by the attorney representing the suspects, Michael
Lee Brydge and Timothy Norris. Attorney William McGuigan did not say
his clients stole lobsters. He said the men were willing to plead
guilty to taking too many of them. Also, the cove where the incident
occurred is a restricted military zone, but not, as the story stated,
a federal marine sanctuary.</LD>

<HD>U.S. Elevates Inquiry on Air Bags in Ford SUVs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Tuesday that
it has stepped up an investigation of air bags on almost 223,000 Ford
Motor Co. 2002 model Explorer and Mountaineer sport utility vehicles
that may not work because of a wiring problem.</LD>
<LD>   Regulators also opened an inquiry on 204,000 BMWs after reports of
41 injuries from side air bags deploying without a crash, a problem
the German car maker has tried to address in two recalls.</LD>
<LD>   The Ford investigation centers on air bags in the steering wheels
of the sport utilities built before Sept. 4, 2001. The bags may have
improperly installed wiring because the steering wheel and shaft were
turned during assembly, according to NHSTA. The agency said Ford has
received 486 warranty claims, with no reports of accidents or
injuries. Ford is cooperating with the agency, company spokesman Todd
Nissen said.</LD>
<TE>   In the BMW probe, regulators are looking at 3-Series vehicles
built from April 1999 to April 2001. It said its records and others
from BMW show 265 complaints of side air bags that could deploy if
the vehicles were driven over potholes or curbs. BMW also reported
212 warranty claims for side air bags.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA said the 41 injuries were mostly cuts and bruises. There
have been no reports of deaths.</TE>
<TE>   BMW spokesman Dave Buchko said Tuesday that he could not confirm
NHTSA's tally of injury reports.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, NHTSA said it had intensified an investigation of
2001 Kia Rio cars after reports of one death and 26 injuries linked
to air bags failing to deploy in a crash.</TE>

<HD>Bond Yields Tumble to 30-Year Lows</HD>
<DH>Treasuries: The 10-year T-note drops below 4% as investors
seek safety. Home mortgage rates could decline further.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Another rush of money into long-term Treasury bonds drove yields to
new lows Tuesday, defying bond market pros who say returns on
government securities already are absurdly low.</LD>
<LD>   The news could be good for home buyers and those who want to
refinance, because mortgage rates are likely to decline with Treasury
yields, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   The global sell-off in stocks fueled the Treasury rally, sending
the yield on the benchmark 10-year T-note to 3.96%, down from 4.13%
on Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Tuesday's close was the lowest in more than 30 years. The previous
low was 4.09% on Aug. 13.</TE>
<TE>   Among the horde of bond buyers were fund managers and insurers
bailing out of equities, bond mutual fund managers hedging prepayment
risk on mortgage-backed bonds and foreigners seeking safety, traders
said.</TE>
<TE>   The overriding factor was concern that the global economy may
continue to falter, perhaps triggering new interest rate cuts by
central banks, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe yields will continue to decline ... and not just here
but globally," said Charles Van Vleet, director of fixed income at
Credit Suisse Asset Management. "Slow growth is a worldwide problem."</TE>
<TE>   Investors were again toying with the notion of a U.S. rate cut
even though top officials from the Federal Reserve recently played
down the idea. The central bank's key short-term rate has been at a
40-year low of 1.75% all year.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fed seems ready to grin and bear the pain for now in the hope
things get better. Well, we think the pain will only get worse and
they'll have to cut in the end," Van Vleet said.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the two-year T-note, the most sensitive to market
expectations for official interest rates, slid to 1.98% on Tuesday
from 2.15% on Friday and is nearing the low of 1.89% set last month.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds were helped by data from the Institute for Supply
Management's August survey of U.S. manufacturing. Analysts had looked
for some recovery after an alarming deterioration in July, but the
ISM's index remained at 50.5, suggesting sluggish growth at best.</TE>
<TE>   Even more worrying, the new orders index, a leading indicator of
activity, fell to a nine-month low.</TE>
<TE>   The data "show business sentiment is extremely fragile," said
Laura Rhame, senior economist at Brown Bros. Harriman &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fed is hoping everything balances to the good, so they don't
have to move again ... and this tips us to the bad," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts suspect the scales could tip further when the August
employment report is released Friday. Average estimates are for
payrolls to rise just 37,000 after a paltry 6,000 gain in July. Many
analysts see the unemployment rate continuing to rise.</TE>
<TE>   Higher unemployment could hurt consumer sentiment, eat into
incomes and curb consumption.</TE>
<TE>   But lower mortgage rates could help offset those negatives,
analysts noted. The average rate on 30-year home loans fell to 6.22%
last week, matching the record low set the week of Aug. 16, mortgage
firm Freddie Mac said.</TE>

<HD>Citigroup Shares Drop on Analyst's 'Sell' Advice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citigroup Inc. shares tumbled more than 10% on Tuesday after a
prominent Wall Street analyst advised investors to sell the stock, in
part on worries about the firm's liabilities in the Enron  and
WorldCom  scandals.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of the biggest U.S. banking company dropped $3.36 to close
at $29.39 on the New York Stock Exchange after analyst Michael Mayo
of Prudential Securities cut his rating to "sell" from "hold."</LD>
<LD>   Mayo, who has been one of Wall Street's most bearish analysts on
banks this year, noted that Congress and state and federal regulators
are investigating the role Citigroup and its Salomon Smith Barney
securities unit played in the collapses of energy trader Enron Corp.
and telecom giant WorldCom Inc.</LD>
<TE>   "In mid-September, Congress will likely hold more hearings into
the practices of Citi and others with regard to Enron/WorldCom, which
could place Citi in a negative light," Mayo told clients.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup's slide helped fuel a broader sell-off on Wall Street on
Tuesday. It was the biggest loser in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index,
which suffered its biggest one-day decline since last September and
contributed to a 5.4% fall in a key index of 24 bank stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Under subpoena, Salomon last week gave the House Financial
Services Committee documents showing how WorldCom executives who were
Salomon clients were favored for allocations of hot initial public
stock offerings in the late 1990s. Critics of Wall Street say Salomon
doled out the IPO shares to win investment banking business from the
executives' companies.</TE>
<TE>   A court ruling is expected this month on whether lawsuits alleging
that the company helped Enron hide debt can move ahead, Mayo said.
Claims in those suits approach $50 billion, he said, and Citigroup
could be on the hook for a higher percentage of damages than other
defendants if the plaintiffs are successful.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators face a special challenge in investigating Citigroup:
How far are they willing to go if the threat is that they could bring
down the nation's largest bank?</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a safety and soundness issue," Mayo said in an
interview, referring to Citigroup's ultimate survival. "We're still
talking of seat-of-the-pants estimates," but given Citigroup's size,
it should be able to absorb any regulatory fines, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Securities lawyers agreed Tuesday, citing an old industry saying
that banks the size of Citigroup are "too big to fail."</TE>
<TE>   "They are not going to let someone off because they are so big,
but regulators are mindful of collateral damages," such as layoffs of
thousands of employees and disruption to the broader economy, said
David Martin, a Washington securities lawyer formerly with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   More worrisome, experts said, is the stock market's vulnerability
to any hint of corporate scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "The market has been so skittish," Martin said. "The mere mention
of an investigation is enough to make the market wary."</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time in three years that a "sell" recommendation
has been placed on Citigroup stock, said Boston data firm Thomson
First Call. Citigroup is rated a "strong buy" by 13 analysts, a "buy"
by two analysts and "hold" by one, according to Thomson. The last
time Citigroup, formed in 1998 through a merger, was downgraded to
"sell" also was by Mayo, in 1999, Thomson said.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup stock is down 37% this year, but the price remains above
the July 23 low of $25.18 a share. Mayo said he expects Citigroup
shares to fall to $28, a change from his earlier target of $42.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup spokeswoman Leah Johnson said the firm does not comment
on analyst reports.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup, led by Chief Executive Sanford Weill, has responded to
recent scandals in ways that only contribute to the firm's problems,
Mayo said.</TE>
<TE>   "Management has recently practiced what we term 'just-in-time
corporate governance.' Its failure to more aggressively acknowledge
and address the issues facing the company increases the degree of
risk," he said in his report.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to facing corporate governance issues, Mayo said,
Citigroup may lose money on $11 billion in loans and other
commitments in Brazil, where the leading presidential candidate in an
election scheduled for Oct. 27 has suggested he may not honor debt
agreements.</TE>
<TE>   Mayo cut his 2002 profit estimate to $2.85 a share from $2.90, and
his 2003 estimate to $3.30 from $3.50.</TE>
<TE>   One side effect of the recent slide in Citigroup's share price has
been the steady erosion of the value of the company's stock and cash
offer for Golden State Bancorp Inc., the San Francisco-based parent
of California Federal Bank.</TE>
<TE>   When Citigroup made its offer in May to acquire Golden State for
$16.40 in cash and 0.5234 of a share of Citigroup stock for each
share of Golden State, the deal was valued at around $40.10 a share,
or about $5.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday's closing price for Citigroup's stock, however, the
deal's value had fallen below $32 a share, or about $4.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Golden State, whose shareholders approved the merger
Aug. 22 with 87% voting in favor, fell $1.62 on Tuesday to $32.88.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Factory Growth Stalls in August</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. manufacturing barely grew in August after a sharp setback a
month earlier, a report said Tuesday, stoking worries the weak
economic recovery may stagnate more in coming months.</LD>
<LD>   The Institute for Supply Management said its closely watched index
of factory business conditions was unchanged in August at 50.5,
posting a seventh month of growth but coming in below expectations of
a rise to 51.6. The index plunged nearly 6 points in July, raising
fears of a double-dip recession. Any reading above 50 signals growth;
one below 50 indicates contraction in a sector that makes up about
one-sixth of the U.S. economy.</LD>
<LD>   In what ISM said was a cause of concern for manufacturers for the
rest of the year, the new orders index fell in August to 49.7 after
tumbling more than 10 points in July to 50.4.</LD>
<TE>   That showed new orders, a key source of future growth and
production, declining for the first time since November and raised
the prospect that factory output could shrink later in the year. Only
eight of 20 industries posted growth in August, ISM said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not making anybody happy about the economy," said Cary
Leahey, senior U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.</TE>
<TE>   After boosting production earlier in the year to replenish
depleted inventories, factories have scaled back output gradually and
have been reluctant to hire new workers or make investments.</TE>
<TE>   Norbert Ore, head of the ISM survey committee, said that another
month showing new orders close to the unchanged level would "indicate
real softness in the balance of the second half." He said the survey
did not suggest a coming contraction in manufacturing.</TE>
<TE>   Layoffs continued at factories, extending a trend seen since
mid-2000 even as the employment index edged up to 45.8 in August from
45.0 in July.</TE>
<TE>   But in a sign that the run-up in prices may be abating, the prices
paid index fell sharply in August to 61.5 from 68.3 a month earlier.</TE>

<HD>Study Backs Low-Emission Gas Engines</HD>
<DH>Automobiles: Early results show cars meet state's strict
standards. But environmentalists say hybrids and fuel cells are the
best solution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a significant boost to the oft-maligned internal combustion
engine, researchers at UC Riverside have found that new low-emission
vehicles with gasoline engines are as clean as gas-electric hybrids
and can meet or beat the state's strictest emissions standards.</LD>
<LD>   The findings, to be announced today, are sure to be cheered by
auto makers, which have invested billions of dollars in internal
combustion engine development. They will be less pleasing to
environmental groups that have been fighting for years for a
replacement for the conventional, hydrocarbon-burning auto engine.</LD>
<LD>   The university's preliminary findings are based on two years of
study of just a few low-emission vehicles using California's
cleaner-burning gasoline. The program, funded by a small group of
government agencies and auto and fuel industry companies, will wrap
up over the next year with a broader study using a variety of
existing cars and light trucks with low-emission, ultra-low-emission
and super-ultra-low-emission vehicle ratings.</LD>
<TE>   But UCR researcher Jim Lentz said early results show the new
generation of low-emission internal combustion engines already is
capable of competing with other technologies in the drive to reduce
auto emissions.</TE>
<TE>   Tailpipe emissions from the new engines, using gasoline formulated
to California's tough standards, often are cleaner than the ambient
air on freeways, Lentz said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a miracle for those of us who remember the 1970s, when we
talked about emission measurements in terms like 10 grams per mile
and listened to the auto companies tell us it was impossible to make
their cars do any better," he said. "Now we are measuring in the
hundredths or even thousandths of a gram per mile."</TE>
<TE>   The study, being conducted by UCR's Center for Environmental
Research and Technology, shows "startling performance with gasoline
engines," said Ben Knight, vice president of automobile engineering
at Honda Research &amp; Development Americas.</TE>
<TE>   Torrance-based Honda Motor America, a leader in alternative engine
technologies, is a co-sponsor of the study, along with ChevronTexaco
Corp., a group of emissions control equipment manufacturers and the
federal Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources
Board.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have work to do on fuel economy and other issues"
related to emission of gases that contribute to global warming, "but
this shows that we are taking auto emissions out of the [smog]
equation," Knight said. "The impossible is becoming a reality," he
said, and gasoline engines "are a technology worth continued
investment."</TE>
<TE>   The study might show that, said Jason Marks, a Berkeley-based
spokesman for the Union of Concerned Scientists, "but while cleaner
gas engines are vital to air quality now, ultimately we must move
beyond combustion engines."</TE>
<TE>   Marks also said the study needs the coming year's results--with a
multitude of vehicles being tested--before meaningful conclusions can
be drawn.</TE>
<TE>   Lentz acknowledged that the study's numbers are based on results
from just a few vehicles, but he said he is confident the next year
of testing will confirm them. "And if the numbers do hold up, it will
further support the idea that Los Angeles can meet the 2010 federal,
and state, air quality standards," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The state standards would see low-emission vehicles emitting less
than 0.05 grams per mile of hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen, both
key air pollutants, said Alan Lloyd, chairman of the California Air
Resources Board.</TE>
<TE>   The UCR study's interim results show that the only two
super-ultra-low-emission vehicles available in California today--the
Nissan Sentra CA and specially equipped Honda Accords--exceed that
standard, and that vehicles with low-emission-rated engines are
close. Researchers wouldn't identify the makes or models used, citing
concern that the study could be misconstrued as an endorsement of a
particular brand.</TE>
<TE>   Kate Simmons, spokeswoman for the Sierra Club, said that the study
seems to be a step in the right direction and that the club believes
better technology will help address both air pollution and global
warming. "But ultimately, fuel cells and hybrids are the best
answer," she said.</TE>
<TE>*</TE>
<TE>Passing Tests</TE>
<TE>``New-technology'' gasoline engines using fuel formulated for
California standards can meet or beat state emissions limits for
low-emission vehicles (LEV), ultra-low-emission vehicles (ULEV) and
the new 2004 model year standard for super-ultra-low-emission
vehicles (SULEV), according to a study by UC Riverside researchers.</TE>

<HD>Navy Sets Deadline for Defense Contractors</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: Boeing, General Dynamics told to refund $2.3
billion in fighter jet dispute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Navy gave General Dynamics Corp. and Boeing Co. a Sept. 30
deadline to return to the Treasury a total of $2.3 billion paid
during development of a fighter aircraft that was canceled.</LD>
<LD>   Then-Defense Secretary Dick Cheney canceled the A-12 program in
January 1991. McDonnell Douglas Corp.--which later merged with
Boeing--and General Dynamics sued, triggering the military's largest
contract dispute. A federal court ruled against the companies in
August 2001; talks have continued since then, with another session
scheduled Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   General Dynamics called the demand "an unseemly negotiating tactic
and an apparent effort to gain advantage during settlement talks."
The company said it would ask a federal appeals court to delay the
collection if negotiations fail.</LD>
<TE>   The companies earlier this year offered a settlement worth as much
as $2.5 billion over 10 years through discounts, upfront payments,
services and free enhancements to the F/A-18 E/F fighter and
Virginia-class submarine programs and other unspecified cost savings.
The Justice Department rejected the offer.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy is demanding that the companies repay $1.3 billion in
progress payments plus $1 billion in interest, or the money will be
garnisheed from existing contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the large size of the debt, we are prepared in the spirit
of cooperation to discuss the possibility of negotiating a repayment
schedule, or a schedule to offset the amounts owed upon an
installment basis, if either of those approaches would be in the best
mutual interest of all parties," Navy Director of Financial
Management Dionel Aviles wrote General Dynamics and Boeing officials
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Baring payment or agreement on an installment plan, the Navy would
turn over the claim to the Pentagon's Defense Finance and Accounting
Service for garnishment against existing contracts, Aviles wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Boeing has received the letter and is disappointed the letter was
sent in light of the ongoing business discussions," Boeing spokesman
John Dern said.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing is preparing a legal appeal to the August 2001 ruling, Dern
said. He declined to speculate on what effect, if any, repayment
would have on company finances.</TE>
<TE>   General Dynamics in a May 15 SEC filing said it would face about a
$1.2-billion pretax liability, or a $630-million after-tax loss taken
as a charge against discontinued operations, if it was forced to
repay the government.</TE>

<HD>Gehry Says Wetlands Issue Not Behind Relocation Shift</HD>
<DH>Real estate: The Playa Vista space won't be ready in time,
forcing the architect's choice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Architect Frank Gehry denied on Tuesday that he was swayed by the
opponents of the Playa Vista project who last week celebrated the
acclaimed architect's decision to relocate his firm to an industrial
section near Marina del Rey instead of into Playa Vista as announced
last year.</LD>
<LD>   Gehry said his decision was driven by business practicalities and
not by the environmentalists who have lobbied the architect to cut
his ties to the project and support their efforts to restore
wetlands. Gehry said the lease on his existing Santa Monica office
expires at the end of the year while the former airplane hangar he
was interested in occupying at Playa Vista is nowhere near ready for
occupancy.</LD>
<LD>   "It had nothing to do with wetlands," Gehry said during a
telephone interview while he was on a European business trip. "We
just could not get it on time and had to get another place."</LD>
<TE>   Gehry and his 125-employee firm, Gehry Partners, will occupy more
than half of the former West Coast headquarters of BMW of North
America. The 72,000-square-foot complex on Beatrice Street was
recently acquired by NSB Capital Partners for less than $10 million.
Gehry, who also will have an ownership stake in the property, is a
friend of NSB Capital chief Larry Field.</TE>
<TE>   The building is just north of Playa Vista in an industrial zone
that has become popular with high technology and design companies,
including advertising agency TBWAChiatDay.</TE>
<TE>   Gehry Partners will occupy a 40,000-square-foot warehouse section
of the complex that has 20-foot-high ceilings, and NSB Capital
Partners will seek tenants for the remaining office space. The move
will allow the architectural firm--which designed the Disney Concert
Hall now under construction in downtown Los Angeles--to house all of
its employees on a single floor at a site with ample parking, Gehry
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to put in a lot of skylights and bring in a lot of
natural light," Gehry said. "We need to be all on one floor so we are
all together."</TE>
<TE>   Gehry was hired by developer Robert Maguire to create a master
plan for the eastern edge of Playa Vista that includes Howard Hughes'
historic aircraft manufacturing plant and the giant hangar in which
the Spruce Goose was constructed. Gehry said he had planned to move
into one of the smaller hangars on property that Maguire has been
trying to purchase for his commercial development.</TE>
<TE>   But Maguire has yet to complete the acquisition, and with the
commercial real estate market in a deep slump, any development on the
property is still years away, say industry observers.</TE>
<TE>   Gehry has said he remains supportive of Playa Vista, but
environmentalists said his decision to locate elsewhere amounts to
another setback for the long-delayed commercial portion of the
project and gives them more time to have the property dedicated for
open space.</TE>
<TE>   "We are grateful that he's not going in," said Marsha Hanscom,
executive director of the Wetlands Action Network.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>China has blocked access to popular U.S. Internet search engine
Google amid government calls to tighten media controls ahead of a
major Communist Party congress.</LD>
<LD>   Attempts to look at the site Tuesday through Chinese Internet
services were rejected with a notice saying it couldn't be found.
Users and technical consultants who monitor the Chinese Internet said
the site has been blocked for several days.</LD>
<LD>   "We were notified by our users that access to Google in China had
been blocked. We are working with Chinese authorities to resolve the
issue," said Cindy McCaffrey, spokeswoman for Mountain View,
Calif.-based Google Inc.</LD>
<TE>   She had no additional information about what the discussion with
Chinese authorities might involve or when Google access within China
might be restored.</TE>
<TE>   The government is preparing to hold a congress in November that is
expected to begin shifting power to a new generation of leaders.
China routinely tightens controls on news and information as
politically sensitive dates approach.</TE>
<TE>   Google is hugely popular among China's 45 million Internet users
because of its wide-ranging search capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Google does not weed out material the Chinese government blocks as
subversive.</TE>
<TE>   China promotes the Internet for economic use and to spread the
Communist government's views. But it has worked hard to muzzle the
Internet as a forum for free information and discussion.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities prevent Internet users from viewing sites run by Falun
Gong, human rights groups and some foreign news organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Police monitor chat rooms and personal e-mail and erase online
content considered undesirable.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, many users find ways to get around the blocks, said
Duncan Clark, an analyst for consulting firm BDA China.</TE>

that suggests the region's housing market is not overheating.</LD>
<LD>   Home prices in Los Angeles County rose by 10.3% from the second
quarter a year ago, the strongest increase recorded in the
April-through-June period since 1989, according to the Office of
Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which compiled the data.</LD>
<LD>   But 13 years ago, prices shot up 24.9% as the market reached its
zenith before a long downward spiral. That was the largest quarterly
gain recorded in the region since the agency began tracking figures
in 1980.</LD>
<TE>   Price increases across the Southland last quarter outpaced the
state average of 7.6%, which was dragged down by a decline in Silicon
Valley that put growth closer to the national average of 6.5%. But
the rise in Los Angeles County is still too small to suggest a sharp
decline in regional prices is imminent, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "These rates are indicative of strong appreciation, but not in the
magnitude of what we have considered to be a bubble in the past,"
said Shelly Dreiman, a senior economist at the agency who compiled
the report.</TE>
<TE>   Typical warning signs of an overheated market have not surfaced in
the region. Those include annual appreciation topping 20% for several
quarters in a row, an excessive amount of home building that could
cause prices to plunge if demand wanes, and prices that far exceed
incomes when the economy is in recession. The economy, while
sluggish, is not nearly as bad as in the early 1990s in Southern
California, Dreiman said.</TE>
<TE>   An analyst at DataQuick Information Systems Inc. who compiles a
monthly report of Southern California home sales trends agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "There are steady numbers but not ones that show the market is
overheating," John Karevoll said. "The numbers in the late 1980s were
not sustainable, but the current figures are."</TE>
<TE>   The study, a broad measure in home prices, is based on
transactions involving thousands of existing houses. Those
single-family homes have mortgages that have been purchased or
bundled and sold to investors by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, which
account for the largest database of mortgages.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County's 10.3% increase from a year earlier ranks it
34th in appreciation among the nation's major metropolitan areas.
Prices in the county grew 55% in the last five years, compared with a
statewide average of 64%.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego County, prices rose 11.2% during the quarter, giving
it a national ranking of 19. They are up 75% in the last five years.
Ventura County prices rose 10.4%, the 28th highest in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County prices rose 10%, putting it in 37th place. They are
up 64% compared with five years ago. Riverside and San Bernardino
counties were up 9.3% for the quarter, ranking 45th in the nation.</TE>

<HD>Nikkei Index Falls to a 19-Year Low</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News and Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Hopes that Japan's decade-long bear market had ended were dashed
again Tuesday as the country's main blue-chip index plunged to a
19-year-low.</LD>
<LD>   Renewed worries about the nation's banking system helped send the
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei index down 304.59 points, or 3.1%, to
close at 9,217.04.</LD>
<LD>   That was the weakest close since Sept. 19, 1983, and took the
index under the low of 9,421 reached in February.</LD>
<TE>   The Nikkei continued to slide today, falling 1.9% to 9,039.85 by
early afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Mizuho Holdings Inc., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. and
Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group Inc. were the hardest hit Tuesday as
investors feared that economic uncertainty and rising bankruptcies
could add to the massive bad-loan problems at the nation's banks.</TE>
<TE>   The drop in banks' shares accelerated after Tokyo Gov. Shintaro
Ishihara suggested that regulators had hidden the extent of Mizuho's
credit problems.</TE>
<TE>   The city government said it may shift some of its $14.5 billion of
public money to deposit accounts at foreign banks unless Mizuho and
other Japanese banks prove their creditworthiness.</TE>
<TE>   "We're responsible for public money, taxpayers' money, and we
can't just let it go up in smoke," Ishihara said.</TE>
<TE>   Ishihara attacked banking regulators, saying their inspections and
subsequent actions on Mizuho were inadequate and "too lenient."</TE>
<TE>   "The worst part of all this is [regulators are] hiding things so
they don't lose face," Ishihara said.</TE>
<TE>   "Banks are getting caught in a vicious cycle," said Shigemi
Nonaka, chairman of Polestar Investment Management. "Slumping stocks
are going to hurt bank shareholdings, and a further slowdown in the
economy would delay bad loan write-offs."</TE>
<TE>   In a bid to calm the market, Finance Minister Masajuro Shiokawa
said Japan always is monitoring stock and other financial markets to
gauge what they are saying about the state of the economy. But he
said there were no immediate plans to take measures to prop up
faltering stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors reiterated concerns that the government still
doesn't have an effective plan to help banks deal with bad loans that
have been on the books since the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The Nikkei index, which peaked at 38,915 in 1989, mostly traded
between 13,000 and 20,000 in the 1990s, then dived below 10,000 in
2001. It rose as high as 11,979 in spring of this year before sinking
again.</TE>
<TE>   From its all-time high in 1989, the Nikkei has lost 76.3%. That
was almost exactly the decline in the U.S. Nasdaq composite index
from its peak in March 2000 to the five-year low reached Aug. 5.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Tumble in Broad Sell-Off</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Dow sinks 4.1% as a U.S. economic indicator
and global financial conditions raise concern. Some investors run to
bonds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN and KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks tumbled Tuesday as investors returned from summer vacation in
a selling mood, facing new doubts about the economy and jitters over
the global financial system.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average sank 355.45 points, or 4.1%, to
8,308.05 as all 30 stocks in the index lost ground.</LD>
<LD>   The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slid 38.05 points, or 4.2%, to
878.02--its biggest percentage drop in almost a year. The
tech-oriented Nasdaq composite slid 51.01 points, or 3.9%, to
1,263.84.</LD>
<TE>   The major indexes remained above the multiyear lows they set in
midsummer, but Tuesday's sell-off was a reminder that the recovery
since then may be fragile.</TE>
<TE>   As stocks sank, some investors rushed into Treasury bonds, driving
yields to record lows.</TE>
<TE>   As the U.S. stock market began what historically has been its
worst month, there were plenty of reasons to fret, analysts said:
Investors watched Japan's main share index sink to a 19-year low,
while worries about possible financial problems at European insurance
companies sent bourses there sliding.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a disappointing report on U.S. manufacturing activity
worsened investor sentiment on Wall Street, as did cautionary
brokerage reports about banking giant Citigroup and semiconductor
leader Intel.</TE>
<TE>   Ongoing fears of a U.S.-Iraq war also weighed on the market.</TE>
<TE>   After rallying 17.5% from its multiyear low July 23, the Dow has
fallen 8.2% in the last seven trading sessions, raising the
possibility of another demoralizing leg down in the 29-month-long
bear market.</TE>
<TE>   In Tuesday's trading, more than three stocks fell for every one
that rose on both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, and volume
picked up, though it was far from heavy.</TE>
<TE>   On the economic front, the Institute for Supply Management said
its manufacturing index fell shy of expectations in August, with new
orders declining for the first time since November.</TE>
<TE>   The trade group's report was troubling, analysts said, because
businesses will be reluctant to spend until they see evidence of a
pickup in demand.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly we're in an economic soft spot," said Jay Mueller,
economist at Strong Capital Management in Milwaukee. "The question
is: How long does it persist, and does it become self-reinforcing?"</TE>
<TE>   In the computer chip industry, Intel slid 81 cents to a multiyear
low of $15.86 after a Lehman Bros. analyst predicted the bellwether
will cut its third-quarter revenue forecast when it updates its
business outlook Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The latest economic data and the Japanese market's plunge Tuesday
again raised comparisons between the Japanese market bubble of the
late 1980s and the U.S. bubble of the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "I hear a lot of concern that we may be headed the way of
Japan--that this is not just a two-or three-year bear market but
something really ugly," said Steve Colton, manager of the
Phoenix-Oakhurst Growth &amp; Income mutual fund in Scotts Valley, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many economists still say the U.S. will be able to stave off a
"double dip" recession and the nation's financial system remains
healthy--unlike the situation with Japan's banks.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever the economic numbers are a little soft, the 'Japan
syndrome' camp becomes a little more vocal," Mueller said.</TE>
<TE>   He said that despite some iffy loans, the U.S. banking system is
more solid than Japan's, which has been reeling since that country's
real estate bubble burst in the late 1980s. Mueller also said the
U.S. ultimately will continue to benefit from its willingness to
allow companies to fail, leading to a painful but necessary
reallocation of capital as business cycles take their course.</TE>
<TE>   Colton said seasonal worries also may have played a major part in
Tuesday's sell-off.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are thinking it's time to raise cash now and see
if things trade lower," he said. "Psychologically, people tend to go
into September and October with a pessimistic feeling about stocks."</TE>
<TE>   Historically, September has been the worst month for the major
U.S. indexes, on average, while October is remembered for its epic
crashes, such as in 1929 and 1987.</TE>
<TE>   "When the market drops 350 points in a day, you'd normally say
that's a time to buy. But September is supposed to be a cruel month,
so maybe we'll wait," said George B. Kauffman, a retired chemistry
professor from Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors say the market remains too volatile for their
temperament.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Swick, a businesswoman from North Hollywood, said she
abandoned stocks more than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I went into Treasury bonds before Sept. 11," she said. "The
market needs to stabilize before I go back. Right now, it just seems
like gambling."</TE>
<TE>   Others say they continue to grit out the downturn.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to believe it's going to get better, because I don't have
anything else to believe in," said Liesel Friedrich, a Santa Monica
homemaker. "Even though I get these horrible statements every month
showing these huge losses--and it's enormously painful and scary--I
don't have a solution. There's no place else to put your money."</TE>
<TE>   In other trading, the U.S. dollar slumped sharply in reaction to
Wall Street's sell-off, and oil prices dropped after Iraq reiterated
that it would allow United Nations weapons inspections, a move some
traders took as easing the threat of a U.S. attack.</TE>
<TE>   Among Tuesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * In Europe, Germany's main share index lost 5.8%, France's slid
4.5% and Britain's dropped 3.6%.</TE>
<TE>   * The U.S. factory report weighed on manufacturing stocks,
including General Electric, down $1.69 to $28.46, and 3M, off $4.92
to $120.03.</TE>
<TE>   * In the tech sector, IBM fell $3.03 to $72.35, Cisco Systems slid
75 cents to $13.07 and Microsoft dropped $2.06 to $47.02.</TE>

<HD>McDonald's Says New Cooking Oil Is Healthier</HD>
<DH>Food: Chain will make items with less saturated fat and
trans-fatty acids, which have been linked to heart disease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>McDonald's Corp. has made a weighty decision: cook its famous French
fries in a new oil that reduces the type of fats linked to heart
disease.</LD>
<LD>   The move, announced Tuesday, comes as the world's No. 1 restaurant
chain struggles to fend off intensifying competition and combat the
perception among consumers that its quality is poor and service
unsatisfactory.</LD>
<LD>   McDonald's will introduce oil with lower levels of trans-fatty
acids and saturated fat at some restaurants next month, the company
said. All of its 13,000 U.S. locations will use the oil by February
for its fries, Chicken McNuggets, Filet-O-Fish, hash browns and
chicken sandwiches.</LD>
<TE>   Reducing trans-fatty acids and saturated fat, while increasing
polyunsaturated fat, can be healthier for the heart, health experts
say.</TE>
<TE>   The change comes as fast-food chains are being sued for their
high-fat content and rivals such as Wendy's International Inc. boost
sales by offering salads as an alternative to fries and burgers.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess they're trying to appeal to health-conscious people,"
said Clara Braun, a 49-year-old accounting clerk having two
cheeseburgers, fries and a Diet Coke at a Chicago McDonald's.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing wrong with that, but I don't eat McDonald's
because it's healthy."</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's, which a decade ago tried unsuccessfully to introduce
healthier options such as the McLean Deluxe and lower-fat shakes,
probably will face a receptive audience, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now people are worried [about their diet and health]," said John
Glass, an analyst at CIBC World Markets.</TE>
<TE>   "Their knowledge of fat and the type of fat you consume is more
sophisticated."</TE>
<TE>   Criticized by some nutrition experts for contributing to obesity
and other health problems with its fat-laden fries, McDonald's said
it will begin cooking them in a new oil that reduces trans-fatty
acids by 48% and saturated fat by 16%.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's stressed that the new French fries, developed with
agribusiness giant Cargill Inc., will taste the same as the old ones,
which it concedes is a key for keeping customer loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Glass agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Their brand equity is so closely related to their French fries,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some McDonald's customers in New York feel strongly about this.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care what they use as long as it tastes good," said
Rahman Anderson, a 24-year-old mailroom worker dining at the
McDonald's in Times Square.</TE>
<TE>   The new fries will have the same amount of fat as the old ones,
McDonald's said, with polyunsaturated fat rising 167%. And the number
of calories in a large order of fries will remain at 540.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Oak Brook, Ill.-based McDonald's fell 73 cents, or 3%,
to $23.03 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Napster to Liquidate After Sale Blocked</HD>
<DH>Internet: Judge agrees with music industry officials who
complained Bertelsmann was too close to its former employee, the
song-swapping service's CEO.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Napster Inc., the song-swapping service that became the
fastest-growing business in history while terrorizing the
entertainment industry, said Tuesday that it plans to liquidate after
a bankruptcy judge blocked the sale of its technology to Bertelsmann.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Peter Walsh agreed with record labels and music publishers
who complained that the German publishing giant was too close to its
former employee, Napster Chief Executive Konrad Hilbers, when it
negotiated the sale.</LD>
<LD>   "Mr. Hilbers had one foot in the Napster camp and one foot in the
Bertelsmann camp," tainting the transaction, Walsh said.</LD>
<TE>   Hilbers had asked his Bertelsmann superiors for approval before
taking the Napster job, and he later wrote in an e-mail, "My
decision-making was always driven by what I thought was a better
decision for Bertelsmann."</TE>
<TE>   Napster plans to convert the Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization
it filed in June to a Chapter 7 liquidation, keeping only its chief
financial officer and one or two workers.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens more were fired Tuesday including founder Shawn Fanning,
and Hilbers resigned.</TE>
<TE>   By evening, the Web site that had drawn tens of millions of
visitors read only: "Napster was here."</TE>
<TE>   Napster leaves behind a world changed by the powerful peer-to-peer
system it pioneered.</TE>
<TE>   The widespread piracy of copyrighted works the courts found
Napster had encouraged polarized the entertainment and technology
industries, with entertainment winning the early battles in the
political war even as music sales slumped.</TE>
<TE>   "What the Napster denouement shows is that you've got to have
great software consumers want, and you've got to do it in a way
that's consistent with intellectual property laws," said Rob Glaser,
CEO of RealNetworks Inc., a maker of programs for playing music and
video over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Such Napster successors as Kazaa and MusicCity have continued to
make copyrighted material available through broad consumer networks
while fighting lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   During Napster's bankruptcy proceedings, the record labels argued
that more than $80 million in Bertelsmann's loans to Napster were
more like an equity investment, meaning the money shouldn't have
counted toward the proposed purchase price of more than $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh's ruling will cost Napster creditors the $9 million in cash
Bertelsmann's ex-CEO, Thomas Middelhoff, had pledged to complete the
transaction. Under Middelhoff's more conservative successors,
Bertelsmann probably would have pulled the plug on Napster after the
sale, a person familiar with the process said.</TE>
<TE>   Napster blamed the record companies for spoiling the sale. The
Recording Industry Assn. of America declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   But Carey Ramos, an attorney for the music publishers, said his
clients weren't acting out of spite.</TE>
<TE>   He said other bidders had been scared away by Bertelsmann's plan
to include its massive loans in the sale price and that they might
come forward now.</TE>
<TE>   The prospects for that were bleak, Napster said. No bidders had
emerged by last week.</TE>

<HD>Oil Prices Decline 4% on Comments From Iraq</HD>
<DH>Commodities: Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz says the
Mideast's fourth-largest producer is open to the return of weapons
inspectors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oil prices fell Tuesday after Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
said his country was prepared to allow United Nations weapons
inspections, a development seen as reducing the threat of a U.S.
attack on the Middle East's fourth-biggest producer.</LD>
<LD>   Aziz told U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that Iraq would allow
access to arms sites to answer charges that it is producing weapons
of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   Prices of crude oil rose last week after Vice President Dick
Cheney said action against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was
inevitable.</LD>
<TE>   "Tariq Aziz is sounding conciliatory, which makes it more
difficult for the Bush administration to rally support for an
attack," said Michael Fitzpatrick, a futures broker at Fimat USA Inc.
in New York. "We'll have to wait for the administration's response,
but in the meantime, it tones things down."</TE>
<TE>   Crude oil for October delivery fell $1.19, or 4.1%, to $27.79 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the biggest
one-day decline since July 22.</TE>
<TE>   Prices through Friday had climbed 20% since mid-June on
speculation that military action threatened by President Bush against
Hussein would disrupt shipments from a region that pumps a third of
the world's oil.</TE>
<TE>   "The speculators are piling out," said Ed Silliere, vice president
of risk management at Energy Merchant in New York, which markets
wholesale gasoline and heating oil. "The concern is that there will
be a major delay in any military action because of the Iraqi moves."</TE>
<TE>   Oil company shares also fell on a day when stock markets tumbled.
Exxon Mobil Corp. dropped $1.83 to $33.62 in New York Stock Exchange
trading. ChevronTexaco Corp. fell $4.23 to $72.40.</TE>
<TE>   The oil price decline accelerated after a report showed that
members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
boosted production last month and had their weakest compliance with
quotas since 1998, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi minister Aziz said the return of inspectors was conditional
on the lifting of economic sanctions imposed after the Persian Gulf
War ended in 1991, the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty in the north
and south of the country and an end to U.S. threats, the Associated
Press reported.</TE>
<TE>   The White House said Tuesday that it favored the return of
inspectors as a "first step."</TE>

<HD>No Work Slowdowns Yet at Ports</HD>
<DH>Labor: A breakdown in contract talks between dockworkers
union and employers over the weekend paves the way for possible job
action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cargo moved normally through West Coast ports Tuesday after a tense
Labor Day weekend during which contract talks between dockworkers and
shipping lines broke down.</LD>
<LD>   Accusing negotiators for the shipping companies of "sabotaging the
process," the International Longshore and Warehouse Union allowed the
labor contract covering 10,500 members to lapse at 5 p.m. Sunday. The
union had been working on day-to-day contract extensions since the
original agreement expired July 1. Its decision to refuse further
extensions paves the way for work slowdowns that many people had
feared could begin as early as Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, dockworkers kept the goods flowing. But ILWU spokesman
Steve Stallone said the union would keep its options open with regard
to future job actions.</LD>
<TE>   "It didn't happen today, but that doesn't mean it can't happen at
some other time," Stallone said. "We haven't laid down."</TE>
<TE>   A strike, if it comes to that, could be weeks away because union
rules call for balloting by mail.</TE>
<TE>   The ILWU has used work slowdowns in the past to win concessions
from the Pacific Maritime Assn., the management group representing
shipping lines and terminal operators. But PMA officials have vowed
not to tolerate the tactic this time around, threatening to lock out
union members in the event of a slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   Although last weekend's standoff heightened concern that a major
disruption is in the offing, some took Tuesday's normal work flow at
the ports as a sign that more talks could follow.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully cooler heads will prevail, and they'll get back to the
bargaining table," said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los
Angeles County Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at a critical point ... because this is the peak shipping
season when retailers are getting all their Christmas merchandise."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Suite, contract administrator for the employers group, said
his organization contacted union officials Tuesday morning seeking to
restart the stalled talks, but so far has received no response.</TE>
<TE>   "We are prepared to go back to the table as soon as the union is,
and we hope that is soon," Suite said.</TE>
<TE>   Union spokesman Stallone said the ILWU is ready to resume talks,
"but only when the PMA is ready to bargain seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Each side has accused the other of stalling, flip-flopping and
bargaining in bad faith. The major obstacle remains the employer
group's insistence on labor-saving technology, which the union is
worried will cost jobs.</TE>
<TE>   A slowdown or strike would be a huge blow to the U.S. economy.
Ports from San Diego to Seattle move more than $300 billion worth of
goods a year, accounting for about 7% of the nation's gross domestic
product.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. moved closer to Food and Drug Administration
approval of the Abilify schizophrenia drug, which may be the
company's next big product.</LD>
<LD>   The drug maker said it is in discussions with the FDA, which sent
a letter indicating that the product may be approved after certain
issues are resolved. The company didn't reveal what concerns the FDA
raised in the letter. Bristol-Myers said it expects FDA approval of
Abilify this year.</LD>
<LD>   Abilify might be Bristol-Myers's most important introduction since
its Plavix heart drug, approved in the U.S. in 1997, analysts say.
Setbacks with heart and cancer drugs, once considered potential
blockbusters, have left the company more dependent on Abilify.
Analysts say peak annual sales could reach about $700 million.</LD>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers shares fell 95 cents to $24 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<LD>Dynegy Inc. President Steve Bergstrom said a drop in U.S. electricity
prices would force producers to shut power plants in the next few
months, when milder weather reduces demand.</LD>
<LD>   "You're going to see companies take a real long look at taking
capacity off the market," Bergstrom said at an energy conference in
New York. "Price signals are saying that marginal capacity should be
shut off."</LD>
<LD>   Dynegy and rival power producers, such as Calpine Corp. and Mirant
Corp., are under pressure to preserve cash and reduce debt after
prices fell and lenders tightened credit.</LD>

<LD>Boeing Co. said it won a Pentagon contract to design a fuel
cell-based propulsion system for a new unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
that eventually could stay in the air for weeks rather than days.</LD>
<LD>   Boeing, which last month won a $460-million defense contract to
speed development of another UAV, the Air Force's planned X-45B
unmanned bomber, said the new long-endurance UAV could play a vital

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A small Washington state company that makes maps featuring tourist
attractions has sued Disney in federal court for naming its newest
Orange County theme park California Adventure.</LD>
<LD>   World Impressions, based in Tracyton, Wash., says it claimed the
name in 1986 when it started making its maps. Disney's theme park
opened in Anaheim next to Disneyland in February 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit by World Impressions asserts that Disney should
abandon the name immediately, and a federal court in Illinois will
decide the matter.</LD>
<TE>   Attorneys for Disney claim the legal action is an "ill-conceived
and baseless lawsuit" because the two companies work in different
businesses: theme parks and advertising.</TE>

<LD>   The judge said he would issue a ruling by the end of the week.</LD>
<TE>   The sale was proposed by the $5.4-billion Milton Hershey Trust,
which holds 77% of the voting shares in giant the U.S. chocolate
maker. Bidders include Swiss giant Nestle and possibly Kraft Foods
Inc.</TE>

2002 profit will be below its previous forecast because energy

<LD>Responding to Adelphia cable subscribers who have complained about a
recent rate increase, the Los Angeles City Council directed its cable
regulators to study whether the increase was justified.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, reeling after its Bankruptcy Court filing and the
arrest of its founder and two of his sons on fraud charges, Adelphia
Communications Corp. notified Southern California customers that it
was raising rates for its basic cable and premium services.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Coudersport, Pa.-based company notified the city's
Information Technology Agency in March--before it filed for
bankruptcy protection--that it planned to raise rates in one of its
service areas, that increase and increases announced to regulators in
June for three other areas surprised and angered customers and
officials.</LD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Profits at the nation's health insurers jumped 25% in 2001, led by
Blue Cross plans, though earnings from traditional HMO plans slumped.</LD>
<LD>   All Blue Cross Blue Shield plans--led by Anthem Inc. and several
nonprofits--reaped $2.9 billion in profit last year, a 70% increase
from 2000, according to a survey by Weiss Rating, an independent
firm.</LD>
<LD>   Health insurers in the aggregate earned $4.1 billion in 2001, but
earnings at health maintenance organization plans, which suffered
from a consumer backlash against their restrictions, fell about 7%.</LD>
<TE>   Blue Cross plans, which have their roots in nonprofit charitable
groups, "are positioned to take advantage of the public's dislike of
HMOs" by offering alternatives, said Melissa Gannon, vice president
of Weiss.</TE>

<LD>Swiss drug giant Roche said it has reached agreement to sell its
vitamin division for $2.21 billion to DSM, the Dutch chemical and
life sciences company.</LD>
<LD>   Roche said the move would allow it to focus on its priority areas
of pharmaceuticals and diagnostics. The deal is expected to close
early next year.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, which is subject to clearance by European Union
antitrust authorities, comes less than a year after Roche was fined
about $406 million by the European Commission in November for being
the "prime mover" in an international vitamin price-fixing cartel
involving seven companies.</LD>
<TE>   Under terms of the sale, Roche said it would remain responsible
for all present and future liabilities resulting from vitamin

<HD>Appeals Court Upholds $65-Million Jury Award in Sex.com
Domain Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court dismissed the appeal of a fugitive who lost a
$65-million verdict last year over his theft of the lucrative
Internet domain name www.sex.com.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals action Friday affirms an
April 2001 federal jury verdict ordering Stephen Cohen to pay the
site's original and current owner, Gary Kremen, for acquiring the
domain name through fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Kremen hasn't been able to collect the money from Cohen. He also
is trying to sue VeriSign Inc.'s Network Solutions, the company that
registers Web site addresses. The court is reviewing Kremen's appeal
that Network Solutions should be responsible for letting Cohen take
the domain name.</LD>
<TE>   Kremen registered the domain name in 1994, but adult-entertainment
executive Cohen took it in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen's attorney, Michael Mayock, who claimed that his client
wasn't able to pay the jury award because he is under house arrest in
Mexico, couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Donna Patt, Mayock's secretary, said Mayock went home sick Tuesday
and the court's opinion arrived in Tuesday's mail.</TE>
<TE>   In a three-paragraph opinion released Friday, the panel rejected
Cohen's arguments, saying, "in light of Cohen's status as a fugitive
from justice and his egregious abuse of the litigation process, we
exercise our discretion to dismiss his appeal pursuant to the
fugitive disentitlement doctrine."</TE>
<TE>   The three-judge panel also ruled Kremen is entitled to Cohen's
Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., home. Kremen took possession of Cohen's home
last year and estimates the house is worth $6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Until 1998, Network Solutions was the only place users could
register domain names. How the panel rules on Network Solutions'
status in the case could affect Internet law, said James Wagstaffe,
Kremen's attorney.</TE>

<LD>   IBM will eliminate some jobs as it integrates Pricewaterhouse into
its services unit, said Doug Elix, a senior vice president for IBM
Global Services. But it was too early to say how many, he said.</LD>
<LD>   IBM, the world's biggest seller of computer services, is trying to
lower costs this year after five straight quarterly sales declines.
The company has cut 15,600 jobs in 2002, a less than 5% reduction,
IBM said last month. Chief Executive Sam Palmisano is buying
Pricewaterhouse to sell more profitable services.</LD>
<TE>   Pricewaterhouse has about 30,000 workers, and IBM Global Services
has 150,000 employees.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, IBM agreed to buy Access360 for an undisclosed price
to get software that controls who has access to computer files.
Irvine-based Access360's programs give new employees the right to use
applications they need, deny access to sensitive files and lower
costs by requiring fewer people to monitor who can use certain files.</TE>
<TE>   IBM shares fell $3.03 to $72.35 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The shares rose as high as $73.19 in after-hours trading.</TE>

<LD>   Intel reduced the cost of a 2.4-gigahertz Pentium 4 to $193 from
$400 and lowered the prices of 2.26-GHz and 2.2-GHz versions 20% to
$193 each in 1,000-unit shipments.</LD>

<HD>WTO Says Tariff-Sharing Law Illegal</HD>
<DH>Trade: Member nations say U.S. firms are encouraged to
initiate anti-dumping cases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A U.S. law that directed the government to share tariff revenue with
private companies has been declared illegal by the World Trade
Organization, U.S. officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said the decision by the 144-nation organization
represents another trade-related setback for the United States and
could reinforce perceptions that the government preaches free trade
but practices protectionism.</LD>
<LD>   The action is aimed at a law enacted in 2000 on behalf of U.S.
steelmakers and other companies that are hurt when foreign
competitors "dump" products in the United States at less than the
cost of production.</LD>
<TE>   The law, known as the Byrd Amendment, allows the companies to
receive the proceeds from punitive tariffs imposed in anti-dumping
cases. It was challenged by the European Union, Canada and eight
other WTO members.</TE>
<TE>   More than $200 million has been distributed to U.S. companies
since the law took effect. The WTO decision does not require the U.S.
government to take back those funds but will cloud the legality of
any additional distributions.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said the law created a double incentive for companies to
file complaints leading to anti-dumping actions by the government.
Not only do they benefit from the higher prices that result from the
protective duties, but they get the proceeds of the tariffs as well.</TE>
<TE>   The WTO action finalizes a provisional decision in July. Though it
was not announced, U.S. officials said the decision was approved over
the weekend by the WTO panel handling the case.</TE>
<TE>   "It is final, and we intend to appeal," said Richard Mills,
spokesman for U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the promised appeal, Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the
Institute for International Economics in Washington, said neither the
Clinton administration nor the Bush administration was enthusiastic
about enforcing the law.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably nobody in the U.S. government is shedding any tears over
this," Hufbauer said.</TE>
<TE>   The three-person WTO tribunal that handled the case concluded that
the law violated nine provisions of global trade agreements. It urged
the United States to repeal it outright, rather than attempt to amend
it.</TE>
<TE>   Hufbauer said the law was a significant irritant in relations
between the United States and its major trading partners. Those
relations have been strained in recent months by U.S. approval of big
subsidies for U.S. farmers and punitive tariffs on imported steel and
lumber.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the WTO authorized the European Union to impose tariffs
of up to $4 billion on U.S.-made products to compensate for a U.S.
tax credit that subsidizes multinational corporations.</TE>
<TE>   As traditional tariffs and quotas have been gradually reduced
under global trade agreements, the United States increasingly has
used its anti-dumping laws to protect industries that find it hard to
compete against low-cost imports.</TE>

<HD>Truckers' Shares Surge as Rival Files for Bankruptcy
Protection</HD>
<DH>Transit: Roadway, Yellow and Arkansas Best did a better job
during the recession and stand to gain most of Consolidated
Freightways' business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roadway Corp., Yellow Corp. and Arkansas Best Corp. shares rose as
the truckers began divvying up $1.5 billion or more in annual sales
from collapsed rival Consolidated Freightways Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Home Depot Inc., the largest home-improvement retailer, said it
started shifting freight to Roadway in August as Consolidated began
to founder. The trucker, with sales of $2.24 billion last year, filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Tuesday, one day after
announcing it was ceasing operations and letting its 15,500 workers
go.</LD>
<LD>   Roadway, Yellow and Arkansas Best did a better job managing
through last year's recession and stand to get most of the failed
rival's customers, analysts said. Consolidated was the third-biggest
U.S. trucker, with 15% of the market for companies that combine many
customers' shipments in each trailer.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a $2-billion revenue opportunity that hasn't been seen in
some time," said James Corridore, a Standard &amp; Poor's analyst.
Roadway, Yellow and Arkansas Best "are all going to see a nice pickup
in their business."</TE>
<TE>   Akron, Ohio-based Roadway expects to get "more than its equivalent
share" of Consolidated's national sales, Chief Financial Officer
Dawson Cunningham said. That may be enough to raise Roadway's
third-quarter tonnage to year-2000 levels, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Roadway shares rose $3.63, or 15%, to $27.23, while Overland Park,
Kan.-based Yellow gained $2.76, or 12%, to $25.05. Arkansas Best rose
$5.18, or 25%, to $25.76. All trade on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Trading in Consolidated shares was halted, and the Vancouver,
Wash.-based company said the shares probably will have no value
because it won't be able to pay all creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Roadway, Yellow and Arkansas Best have more efficient terminal
networks and pickup and delivery systems than Consolidated and stand
to benefit most, Salomon Smith Barney analyst Scott Flower said.</TE>
<TE>   USFreightways Corp. and CNF Inc.'s Con-Way unit also will be
helped because those regional truckers have expanded their network to
carry cargo, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yellow expects "to pick up our fair share" of business, Chief
Executive William Zollars said, declining to give a target. He said
he expected rates would rise an unspecified amount over the next few
weeks because the truck industry's capacity has been reduced.</TE>
<TE>   "Some customers are so big that they only like to do business with
a big company like Roadway or Yellow, which have the ability to pick
up some nice-sized accounts," Corridore said. The newly reduced
industry capacity "can only help the pricing power" of rivals.</TE>

<HD>UAL Still May Be Chapter 11-Bound</HD>
<DH>Airlines: New CEO faces the tough task of slashing costs.
Unions say they are ready to work with him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The selection of oil executive Glenn Tilton to head United Airlines
drew guarded optimism Tuesday that he can quickly repair the
beleaguered carrier, but some on Wall Street said United is still
headed toward a bankruptcy filing.</LD>
<LD>   Tilton starts today as chairman and chief executive of United and
its parent, UAL Corp., and is expected to meet with leaders of its
powerful labor unions this week. The nation's second-largest airline,
United is seeking huge cost cuts from its work force to help the
carrier survive a pending cash shortage and the slump in air travel.</LD>
<LD>   Union officials, meantime, are meeting today in Chicago to discuss
the changes in United's management, which also included the abrupt
resignations of United's president and chief operating officer. Both
quit under pressure from the unions and to make way for Tilton's own
management team.</LD>
<TE>   The unions, representing United's pilots, mechanics, flight
attendants and other ground workers, say they're ready to work with
Tilton on a recovery plan, but they've made no concessions as yet.</TE>
<TE>   "United's employees and unions have said for some time that a new
CEO and new management was needed," said Frank Larkin, a spokesman
for the International Assn. of Machinists, which represents United's
mechanics. "Whether this is the team to revive the carrier to its
former glory remains to be seen, but it's certainly a step in the
right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Investors also gave a modest lift to UAL's battered stock after
the Labor Day election of Tilton, formerly vice chairman of
ChevronTexaco Corp. The stock edged up 7 cents to $2.94 a share on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   But one veteran airline analyst, James Higgins of Credit Suisse
First Boston, issued a rare "sell" on the stock and said in a report
to clients that "UAL's management/labor relations are growing only
more dysfunctional, the upheaval at the top is an ill-timed,
near-term distraction, and time has run out for United to restructure
itself outside of Chapter 11."</TE>
<TE>   Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, a company continues to
operate but is protected from creditors while it works out a
restructuring plan. But Chapter 11 also typically renders the
company's stock worthless, and UAL's stock is 55%-owned by its
employees.</TE>
<TE>   United has applied for a $1.8-billion federal loan guarantee to
shore up its balance sheet. But the agency overseeing the program,
the Air Transportation Stabilization Board, is waiting for the
airline to first lock in concessions from its workers, creditors and
suppliers before it decides on whether to grant a guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   Tilton succeeded interim CEO Jack Creighton, 70. Before he
retired, Creighton told union leaders United needs $1.5 billion in
annual labor-cost savings for six years. He also set a Sept. 16
deadline for the two sides to reach agreement and avoid a bankruptcy
filing. With Tilton aboard, both of those items now are considered
negotiable.</TE>
<TE>   Tilton declined to comment. But in a taped message to employees,
he said that "we have to make some difficult but critical decisions
right away" and that "there's only one way we can get this done, and
that's together."</TE>
<TE>   United spokesman Chris Brathwaite noted that Creighton had said he
would leave "as soon as the right person was found. We have new
leadership at the top, and that's exactly what the unions have been
looking for."</TE>
<TE>   Relations between United's executives and unions have long been
contentious. Management has said for more than a year that its work
force must make deep concessions to lower United's operating costs.
But the unions blame many of the airline's problems on poor senior
management.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers said Tilton, 54, is ideally suited to break the
logjam. "He's a consensus builder, which is a breath of fresh air in
an industry with this much animosity" between management and labor,
said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst at Fahnestock &amp; Co. who has followed
Tilton's career.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, his lack of airline experience could be a blessing because
"he is going to do things in a very unorthodox way--good, bad or
indifferent," Gheit said. His Texaco experience also means "he knows
how to play before a huge audience and deal with large problems. And
he comes to United with a very strong hand because he has already
proven himself. He's a guy coming in with nothing to lose."</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Production Chief at Warner Quits Unexpectedly</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Lorenzo di Bonaventura denies that
skirmishes with studio boss Alan Horn triggered his decision to
become a producer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES and ANITA M. BUSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just two months after getting a major promotion, the top film
production executive at Warner Bros. resigned abruptly late Tuesday
to become a producer at the studio, saying he was miserable in the
new job.</LD>
<LD>   Lorenzo di Bonaventura had periodically clashed with Warner
President Alan Horn over budgets and picking movies during the three
years they worked together. They frequently had icy relations,
although Warner executives insisted that the two were able to develop
a working relationship.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement and interview, Di Bonaventura laid the blame
entirely on the corporate nature of his job as executive vice
president, worldwide motion pictures, which he was promoted to in
July. He said that as the job became more corporate, "the less
creative it became, and the less creative it became the less joyful
it became."</LD>
<TE>   Di Bonaventura said he concluded after an 18-day rafting trip in
April and May that he needed to make a change. He said he also
decided to make the change after the sequel to "The Matrix" wrapped
and with the next "Harry Potter" installment nearly finished.</TE>
<TE>   "At 45 years old, this was my shot to do this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Horn said Warner executives "respect and support"
Di Bonaventura's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about his past clashes with Horn, Di Bonaventura said: "Alan
is being incredibly supportive of me as a producer. Alan has promoted
me and given me a lot of freedom in my job."</TE>
<TE>   According to high-ranking executives at the studio, Di Bonaventura
and Horn disagreed on a number of issues, most recently on whether to
make another installment in the "Superman" film series, or a film
tentatively titled "Batman vs. Superman."</TE>
<TE>   "That's when it started to get rough again between Alan and
Lorenzo," said one producer on the lot. "Together Alan and Lorenzo
decided to make 'Batman vs. Superman.' Then the 'Superman' script
came in and everyone loved it, but there emerged the conflict. Alan
wanted to make 'Superman.' Lorenzo wanted to make 'Batman vs.
Superman.'</TE>
<TE>   "I know they polled the executives on which to make. Alan
overruled Lorenzo and the project was shelved," the producer added.
"After that, Lorenzo told people he was really upset at Alan. It
wasn't just about this one movie, but it was this project that
brought things to a head."</TE>
<TE>   Di Bonaventura was known to have been interested in the Warner
presidency after former Co-Chairmen Bob Daly and Terry Semel left the
studio, but the job went to Horn instead.</TE>
<TE>   Di Bonaventura worked on such blockbusters as "Harry Potter and
the Sorcerer's Stone" and "The Matrix." He also was responsible for
bringing in the production deals for director Steven Soderbergh and
actors George Clooney and Sandra Bullock.</TE>
<TE>   A Harvard graduate and former river-rafting guide, Di Bonaventura
joined Warner in 1989 as a production executive. He moved into the
top tier at the studio in 1996 when he jointly took over the
production reins with Bill Gerber, with whom he openly clashed.
Gerber eventually left the studio to become a producer.</TE>
<TE>   With his promotion in July, Di Bonaventura gained oversight of
every aspect of the production process, and domestic theatrical
marketing was added to his responsibilities. But Horn retained the
authority to approve scripts for production.</TE>

<HD>Analyst Tipped WorldCom, Committee Says</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Jack Grubman warned executives his firm was
cutting stock recommendation before information was public, a House
panel says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters and Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Salomon Smith Barney telecom analyst Jack Grubman warned top WorldCom
Inc. executives that investment strategists at his firm were dropping
the company from the brokerage's recommended list before the
information was publicly released, the House Financial Services
Committee said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Grubman, who recently left the brokerage under a cloud of
controversy because of his ties to WorldCom, also appeared to
distance himself from his firm's strategists in an e-mail to
WorldCom's then-chief financial officer, Scott D. Sullivan, who
forwarded the e-mail to then-Chief Executive Bernard J. Ebbers.</LD>
<LD>   "This is our strategist, not us. Which is why I hate ever having a
name on that list," Grubman said in the March 12 e-mail to Sullivan.</LD>
<TE>   That day, Salomon removed WorldCom from the brokerage's official
recommended list, even though Grubman continued with a high rating on
the shares.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon's decision followed WorldCom's announcement on March 11
that the Securities and Exchange Commission had requested information
on the firm's accounting procedures. WorldCom shares slumped 12% to
$7.93 on March 12.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman is under investigation by securities regulators and the
New York attorney general for possible conflicts of interest in his
positive ratings of telecommunications companies that were struggling
financially.</TE>
<TE>   "Grubman is distancing himself from somebody else in his own
company that clearly made the right call," said Peggy Peterson, a
spokeswoman for the Financial Services Committee.</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer for Grubman was not immediately available for comment.
The practice of informing a company about a rating change was
appropriate, a Salomon spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Additional e-mails released by the panel showed top WorldCom
executives trying to downplay the company's plight in spring,
including rejecting the notion that bankruptcy was an option, less
than two months before the company sought protection from creditors.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, what all this has in common is it shows how Ebbers,
Sullivan and Grubman dealt with questions about WorldCom; they
obfuscated every time," Peterson said.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom admitted in June that it had improperly accounted for
$3.9 billion in expenses and in July filed for the largest bankruptcy
in history. In early August, the firm said it improperly accounted
for an additional $3.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan was indicted on criminal fraud charges and is slated to
be arraigned today in New York along with WorldCom's former director
of general accounting, Buford Yates.</TE>
<TE>   Former WorldCom Controller David Myers, who resigned after the
accounting debacle emerged in June, is trying to reach a plea
agreement with prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, federal prosecutors received a 30-day extension to
continue plea discussions with Myers, who is charged with helping
Sullivan, his former boss, hide operating expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have filed court papers signaling that Myers and two
other WorldCom employees are preparing to plead guilty and cooperate
against their bosses.</TE>

<HD>Cigna Says It Will Take a $720-Million Charge</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Company says it needs to boost reserves because
of the stock market's swoon this summer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cigna Corp., the third-largest U.S. health insurer, said Tuesday that
it expects to record a charge of $720 million this quarter because
it's putting more money aside to make up for investments that have
dropped in value.</LD>
<LD>   Cigna is trying to cover future payments to customers who bought
contracts that offered them fixed annual payments as well as death
benefits guaranteed at a specific level.</LD>
<LD>   The insurer has to boost reserves because the stock market's
decline means that Cigna may have to pay out more than it expected.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a bit larger than people had anticipated," said Greg
Crawford, an analyst at Fox-Pitt, Kelton Inc. who has an "attractive"
rating on Cigna and doesn't own the shares. "The smart thing to do in
these situations is to erase any future risk that the company
sees--to put the entire issue to bed. That's what they did here."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Cigna said it might have to boost reserves because
certain variable-annuity contracts require the company to make up the
difference between the market value of mutual fund investments and
specified death benefits. Cigna said it had set aside $300 million
for the business as of June 30.</TE>
<TE>   The payments relate to a reinsurance business that Cigna is
exiting.</TE>
<TE>   The Philadelphia-based company said per-share earnings would be
$1.95 to $2.05 for the third quarter and $7.85 to $8.15 for the year,
not including the reserve expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Cigna shares fell $2.47 to $82.65 on the New York Stock Exchange
before the charge-off was announced.</TE>
<TE>   Stilwell to Merge Units Under Janus Name</TE>
<TE>   Stilwell Financial Inc. said Tuesday that it will combine its
operations under the banner of its flagship Janus Capital Management
mutual fund unit, and tapped a Janus insider to head the merged firm.</TE>
<TE>   The moves come as the company tries to boost the once-hot Janus
funds, which have plunged during the stock downturn, and to diversify
its investment offerings. The new structure also resolves speculation
about the future leadership of Janus, whose founder and former Chief
Executive Tom Bailey stepped down July 1--with no obvious successor
in place.</TE>
<TE>   The combined company will be led by Mark Whiston, 41, who will
take over Dec. 31. Whiston, an 11-year Janus veteran, will oversee
all of Stilwell's divisions, including the Berger fund group and
U.K.-based Nelson Money Managers.</TE>
<TE>   The structure will allow Janus, whose growth-oriented strategy has
been bludgeoned by the rough stock market, to market other Stilwell
investments under its own brand name.</TE>
<TE>   The Stilwell name will effectively disappear. The combined company
will shut down its headquarters in Kansas City, Mo., and move its
base to Janus' hometown of Denver. The company said it expects to cut
130 to 140 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Stilwell shares gained $1.06 to $15 Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange, but are still down about 45% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Reuters</TE>
<TE>   Briefly</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said Tuesday that it will adopt all
stock-research reform measures under a settlement with New York Atty.
Gen. Eliot Spitzer even if a few states don't sign onto the deal.</TE>
<TE>   About 40 states have adopted the landmark $100-million settlement
announced in May and other adoptions are imminent, according to the
North American Securities Administrators Assn.</TE>
<TE>   After releasing subpoenaed e-mails showing that Merrill analysts
had publicly touted Internet stocks while privately disparaging them,
Spitzer secured a settlement with Merrill to put in place reforms to
ensure that its stock analysis wasn't compromised by efforts to
secure investment banking business from companies Merrill analysts
rated.</TE>

<HD>It's Sooo High-Tech, She Cooed</HD>
<DH>Walking, talking cell phone ads have the right ring to
them.</DH>

<LD>I'm imagining right now that I am sitting at a bar, one of those
self-conscious, fashionable places where people order $12 martinis in
pastel colors. A Bacall look-alike slides onto the stool adjacent.
Bogart-like, I say nothing. I do, however, notice that she is dressed
to be noticed. Which she notices, and strikes up a conversation about
that topic that men always find irresistible. That is, she asks me
about me. She hangs on my every word.</LD>
<LD>   Bear with me, I told you I was imagining this.</LD>
<LD>   After a few minutes, she seems to remember something. Oh, would I
mind taking her picture using her cell phone? Hum, I reply. I didn't
know cell phones took pictures.</LD>
<TE>   Where are we headed with this story? Not to affairs of the heart.
This is the new realm of reality marketing. Not a TV ad but a
face-to-face encounter.</TE>
<TE>   In trendy bars like this, in trendy cities here and there,
actresses actually are playing hired shill, demonstrating to
unwitting patrons how easy it is to start up a conversation and flirt
if only you will run down the street and buy this just-released cell
phone that takes photographs. Here, where high rollers will pay $12
for glacier-blue martinis, is where fads are born.</TE>
<TE>   And that's the point.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, it may be some time still before I personally encounter
anyone playing the part of Bacall. My local tavern sells only beer in
schooners and pickled eggs on paper towels, and it attracts no one of
fashionable intent insofar as I can discern--and few cell phone users
either. But at last we have a trend in consumer marketing that is
worth a toast. Let's hope it sweeps the country.</TE>
<TE>   The next time I buy tires for the Civic, I'd like it to be because
an actress spent a few hours at Joe Jost's listening to what's on my
mind while she coos and tells me that what made the difference for
her, happiness-wise, was switching to low-profile radials. The usual
kind of saloon prattle.</TE>
<TE>   I know, I know. The Naderites are up in arms about this kind of
"stealth marketing." One of them was quoted as saying: "It's
deceptive. People will be fooled into thinking this is real buzz."
But that's the trouble with the Nader crowd. They don't spend nearly
enough time in bars. If they did, they might catch their breath and
realize that the words "real" and "buzz" never belong in the same
thought. Besides, they might be charitable and see that Sony Corp.
and Ericsson actually are doing us a favor with this new joint
venture that is sending actors and actresses into bars across the
country for 60 days.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not referring specifically to cell phones that take
photographs. About those, I'm reminded of what a general said about
swagger sticks: If you need one, get one. It's the personal service
that I'm talking about.</TE>
<TE>   Life would be immeasurably better if all sales clerks were trained
like actors and actresses to convey interest in you, the consumer. So
what if it comes straight from a prepared script? Better a nice act
than authentic disdain. And if we want to do more business one on one
in the dim lights of a bar with chitchat, smiles, perhaps even some
harmless flirting, I'm all for it.</TE>
<TE>   If George W. Bush had invited me to Waco for his economic summit
last month, I would have told him that he ought to get behind this in
a big way. When a guy with an XL waistline starts feeling like Bogey,
that's consumer confidence of a new order. I still don't think I'd
order a martini in any color but clear, but otherwise I'm game for
these games.</TE>
<TE>   Deceptive? Friends, the word has lost its meaning in consumer
marketing. Last year, we stood by helplessly as brand-name companies
quietly reduced the volume of products they put in packages, like
corn chips, but kept the price the same. They figured we wouldn't
notice or couldn't do anything if we did. And apparently they were
right because I see that none of these companies are on the growing
list of corporate failures.</TE>
<TE>   This year, we learn that at least some big discount retailers are
charging more per ounce for their "value-size" products. Wal-Mart,
for instance, is reportedly pricing bulk-sized commodities at
premiums up to 50% per ounce, taking advantage of the ingrained
consumer expectation that buying larger sizes saves money.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with these gouges, give me an actress and an empty bar
stool and we can talk business.</TE>

<HD>Davis Gets So-So Marks in Education</HD>
<DH>The governor is going to have to work a lot harder to
assist schools.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRUCE FULLER</AU>
<BD>Bruce Fuller, professor of education and public policy
at UC Berkeley, is co-director of Policy Analysis for California
Education.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis promised in 1999 not to run again if his school
reforms failed to boost children's achievement. With scores up four
years running--even in sluggish urban systems like Los Angeles--the
governor should be riding high.</LD>
<LD>   Yet many front-line teachers claim that Davis is more focused on
testing and looking tough on schools than on providing the resources
needed to meet his higher standards. And evidence mounts that the
system still reinforces achievement gaps, favoring kids and teachers
in suburbs.</LD>
<LD>   Here's a report card on Davis' efforts to improve schools.</LD>
<TE>   * Raising student achievement (B+). The governor has earned
bragging rights when it comes to learning gains.</TE>
<TE>   The latest scores show that 44% of all L.A. second-graders now
read above the national average, up from 25% four years ago. Math
performance also has jumped markedly.</TE>
<TE>   By raising the bar and tracking school performance, Davis has
spurred local educators to experiment, such as hiring teaching
coaches for inexperienced teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Other gauges are less upbeat. Smaller gains in the new test items
linked to the state's learning standards, released last week, suggest
that test preparation, not deeper learning, explains part of the
earlier rise in scores.</TE>
<TE>   High school students have shown few gains; graduation rates remain
flat. Yet teenagers' aspirations are rising: The number taking
Advanced Placement exams has climbed 25% under Davis' watch.</TE>
<TE>   * Fresh resources to schools (B-). California spent about $5,900
per pupil when Davis took over from Pete Wilson. Davis' current
spending plan allocates just over $7,000 per pupil, still $800 below
the national average.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' fiscal infusion equals less than 4% in real-dollar growth
annually. Teacher salaries have risen overall, but the average
teacher still earns only slightly more than $40,000 annually.</TE>
<TE>   * Motivating teachers (C+). Sit with any group of teachers and you
will get an earful of opinions regarding the Davis program. Many feel
their profession is being dumbed down, forced to follow lock-step
teaching scripts in classrooms. A few, resentful of Davis'
carrot-and-stick approach, have turned down his monetary performance
incentives, which are based on test scores.</TE>
<TE>   * Equalizing school quality (C+). Black and Latino children now
score at the 34th percentile in L.A., averaged across elementary
grades; white youngsters score at the 67th percentile.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis prefers a trickle-down approach to school equity,
largely ignoring the system's structural inequalities, especially the
huge gap in working conditions and wages paid to teachers in poor
versus affluent communities. This forces urban schools to rely on
what are euphemistically called "emergency credentialed" teachers.
Almost 30% of L.A.'s teachers are not fully credentialed, compared
with just 3% in suburban schools.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has funded efforts to recruit new teachers and improve
teaching, but unions must give ground so teachers who remain
committed to inner-city schools can be rewarded.</TE>
<TE>   * Sparking civic involvement (D-). Governors in Kentucky and North
Carolina have mounted vigorous efforts to spur discussion of
state-led reforms among parents and teachers. Davis has centralized
policy talk within a small circle, strengthening alliances with
corporate leaders. Four pro-education barons have given Davis almost
$1 million since 1999, according to a Times analysis. The governor
has thanked two by appointing them to the state Board of Education.
In contrast, the state's largest teachers union has declined to add
to Davis' campaign war chest.</TE>
<TE>   Without broader civic engagement, sustaining and deepening the
reform strategy will become untenable.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has come to personify the "Little Engine That Could": With
steely determination, he's crisscrossing up a steep mountain. And
it's going to get tougher: The new standards-linked tests are proving
more challenging for students, just as Davis is forced to slash
teacher incentives. More hard climbing is ahead if Davis is to
revitalize reforms in ways that truly empower teachers and advance
equitable results for all children.</TE>

<HD>Throwing 'No-Parent' Kids a Welfare Curveball</HD>
<DH>Family assistance program doesn't need stricter rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SONYA MICHEL</AU>
<BD>Sonya Michel teaches American studies and history at
the University of Maryland and is co-editor of the collection
"Families of a New World," due in March from Routledge.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans love athletes who overcome adversity, and the plucky Little
League team from Harlem that almost won this year's World Series had
more to overcome than most.</LD>
<LD>   The team came close to disqualification because of residency
regulations. Where the three boys involved actually lived was hard to
pin down because they apparently belonged to what social welfare
experts now call "no-parent families."</LD>
<LD>   Because of privacy protections, information on the boys'
backgrounds has been scanty, but it seems that they shuttle among
households of families and friends in Harlem and other areas of New
York City. Such patterns are increasingly common among poor families,
especially urban minorities.</LD>
<TE>   Experts believe that this trend is an unintended consequence of
welfare reform, which forces many mothers to take odd-hours jobs
(often at night) and puts them at risk for benefits loss and
homelessness. Stretched to the limit, they cannot maintain homes for
their children.</TE>
<TE>   Grandparents often wind up caring for kids. One child in this
category was a player on the Little League team. Another player lives
with an uncle. Several stay with nonrelatives; one was taken in by a
sympathetic truant officer. One boy lived with his father in a
homeless shelter.</TE>
<TE>   Such children obviously find a constant in Little League baseball,
and the league has been wise enough to promote this benefit by
allowing kids to play on a team even after they've moved out of its
designated area.</TE>
<TE>   Sports pundits claim that Little League baseball can compensate
for the absence of stable families in the lives of children like some
of those on the Harlem team. Even if this is true, it is a solution
that cannot be generalized because teams are highly competitive and
many youngsters don't make the grade.</TE>
<TE>   More often, children from no-parent families fare badly in school,
are at greater risk for psychological problems and have higher rates
of delinquency than children living with at least one of their
parents. Many get swallowed up in the foster-care system.</TE>
<TE>   These outcomes should be foremost in the minds of congressional
lawmakers when they take up reauthorization of the Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families program in the coming months.</TE>
<TE>   Although congressional supporters claim that the program has been
effective in reducing the welfare rolls, the more stringent rules
under consideration may well increase the trend toward no-parent
families by creating obstacles to consistent parenting.</TE>
<TE>   The bill that probably will come before the Senate is somewhat
softer than the House version, but it still does not recognize caring
for one's own children as "work."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it imposes identical work requirements on single-parent
and two-parent families and ignores the hours spent commuting to
jobs, thereby reducing the time parents can spend with their kids.</TE>
<TE>   By limiting access to post-secondary education, the bill also
makes it more difficult for parents to work their way out of poverty.
It disqualifies parents who have been convicted of drug felonies. And
while offering no support for housing, it diverts scarce funds to
so-called marriage-promotion programs.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing wrong with celebrating the perseverance and spirit
of the Harlem team. But we should also be asking Congress to think
about ways to make life easier, not harder, for the majority of
children in no-parent families--the ones who don't hit home runs.</TE>

<HD>If Hospitals Close, Research Flat-Lines</HD>
<DH>Funding crisis in Los Angeles County threatens clinical
studies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH P. TREVETT</AU>
<BD>Kenneth P. Trevett is president and chief executive of
the Research and Education Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Each day, tens of thousands of Americans discover their cholesterol
levels are high, and their doctors recommend lifestyle and nutrition
changes and perhaps medication that reduces the risk of a heart
attack or stroke.</LD>
<LD>   Each day, thousands of babies are born and are immediately tested
to determine whether their thyroid glands are functioning properly;
if not, they are given synthetic hormones that prevent devastating
and irreversible developmental disabilities.</LD>
<LD>   And each day, people who suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease--the fourth-largest killer in the United States--will be
enrolled in highly specialized exercise regimens so they can live
more fully and freely with this debilitating condition.</LD>
<TE>   These medical innovations and numerous others like them have one
thing in common: They were developed at the Research and Education
Institute, or REI, at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, one of six public
hospitals in Los Angeles County now threatened by a funding crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Harbor-UCLA could be closed to in-patients or have services
seriously curtailed under county health system scenarios being
considered by the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Although the REI is a free-standing biomedical research and
training institution, its survival would be in question if the
hospital closed. Its affiliation with Harbor-UCLA Medical Center is
essential because most of the scientists who work at the REI also
serve as clinicians at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   This year alone, $40 million will be invested by the federal
government and pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical
instrumentation companies in research projects conducted at the REI.
Taking advantage of a melting pot of different ethnic and age groups
in the Torrance area, where it is located, the REI conducts an
average of 125 clinical trials at any given time. Few research
organizations in the country have that kind of diversity of human
subjects--exactly the kind that the federal government seeks.</TE>
<TE>   The research enterprise at the REI costs Los Angeles County
absolutely nothing, and yet its very existence--after 50 years of
highly productive activity--is jeopardized by the fiscal crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the projects underway may have to be moved elsewhere in
the state or out of state or be stopped altogether. They include the
development of a new generation of drugs to combat infections that
are becoming resistant to existing antibiotics;  applying to adult
victims of emphysema and other respiratory disorders the technology
now used to assist premature infants in breathing; the refinement of
arterial stents used to repair ruptured blood vessels; research into
new methods for treating Type I diabetes as well as for postponing
the onset of, or preventing, Type II diabetes; the enhancement of
imaging technology for more accurate diagnosis of breast cancer and
pre-symptomatic heart disease; and studies examining a common pathway
for such autoimmune disorders as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid
arthritis and lupus, thus creating the possibility of one therapeutic
approach to several major illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Other hospitals within the Los Angeles County system also have
ongoing, promising research into several different diseases and
inherited conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Like Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and the REI, these institutions
face disruption or termination of their scientific and training
missions as well as their clinical mission.</TE>
<TE>   Once sacrificed, these programs will not be rebuilt.</TE>
<TE>   It is too difficult and costly to reestablish research programs,
recruit new scientists, develop relationships with patient volunteers
and reconstitute the infrastructure that supports high-quality
biomedical studies.</TE>
<TE>   The victims of this funding crisis are not only the patients of
today but our sons and daughters, our grandchildren and their
children. These are the individuals who can realistically envision a
world where cancer is not a death sentence, where pre-symptomatic
heart disease can be identified and treated, where Alzheimer's is
treatable and perhaps preventable.</TE>
<TE>   Research now, results later. How much later is up to federal,
state and county officials who control budget decisions, as well as
each of us who can express our priorities for how these decisions are
to be made.</TE>

<HD>A Messy Miracle for the ER</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a miracle of resuscitation, the state Legislature on Saturday
approved a new way to pay for California's ailing emergency-care
system. How it happened was messy, but the outcome is hard to fault.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Bill 807, which now awaits Gov. Gray Davis' signature,
would help pay for emergency care by adding a $200 surcharge to fines
for reckless driving, speeding and drunk driving. It's almost a user
fee, since so many of these folks end up needing trauma care.</LD>
<LD>   The money raised--projected at $25 million--wouldn't cure the
state's health-care woes; neither would it lift the pressure from Los
Angeles County. But it would prop up the system facing the most
immediate crisis, the one that all of us count on in the event of an
accident injury or a heart attack.</LD>
<TE>   Hospital emergency departments and the more specialized trauma
centers are overwhelmed and underfunded. Required by law to see
anyone who needs care, regardless of ability to pay, emergency rooms
in California struggle to stay open in the face of inadequate
managed-care payments, pitifully low Medi-Cal reimbursements and 7
million residents with no insurance at all, public or private. Many
don't succeed. In the last decade, more than 50 emergency rooms and
17 trauma centers have closed statewide.</TE>
<TE>   The ones that remain open shoulder ever-larger loads, leading to
backlogs and long waits. Searching for a new source of funding, the
state association of emergency physicians and other medical groups
floated the idea of a "sin tax" on serious traffic violations. A
portion of current fines already goes to emergency care, but costs
have long outpaced the money in the fund the Legislature established
in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Piecing together SB 807 was as rushed and makeshift as any MASH
operation. Using what in Sacramento-speak is called "gut and amend,"
Sens. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) and Don Perata (D-Alameda) deleted the
original content of an unrelated bill and replaced it with completely
new language.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature already had included in its budget a separate $25
million solely for trauma centers. This and SB 807 would help keep
private emergency departments and physicians as part of the
health-care safety net, making up for some of the $325 million they
reported losing in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   There would be little left, however, to help Los Angeles
County-run hospitals. That problem will require Davis' involvement
and leadership, starting with not rolling back payments to
Medi-Cal--the state's version of Medicaid--as he originally proposed.
In the meantime, he should sign SB 807. It is a start on what he
needs to do.</TE>

<HD>Spain Seeks Dissolution of Basque Party</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MADRID</DL>
<LD>Spain asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to outlaw the radical Basque
party Batasuna over its alleged support of the armed group ETA,
setting the stage for possible clashes at banned protests this
weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The legal move was made after the Spanish parliament voted Aug. 26
to seek to dissolve the party because it refuses to condemn violence
by the ETA, Western Europe's most active guerrilla group. The ETA has
killed 836 people in 34 years.</LD>
<LD>   Justice Minister Jose Maria Michavila displayed 26 boxes he said
were packed with 1,000 pieces of evidence linking Batasuna and the
ETA, and singling out 194 of the party's political leaders who he
said also belong to the rebel group.</LD>
<TE>   "Batasuna is the prolongation of terrorism ... the prolongation of
ETA," Michavila said.</TE>
<TE>   Batasuna shares the ETA's vision of Basque independence but denies
it is the group's political wing.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court is Spain's second-highest, leaving Batasuna the
opportunity to appeal to the Constitutional Court should the Supreme
Court rule in favor of the government.</TE>
<TE>   Batasuna supporters said Tuesday that they would go ahead with
street demonstrations set for Saturday in Bilbao, the largest Basque
city, and for Sunday in San Sebastian, a bastion of Basque
nationalism, even though the Basque region's Interior Department
banned the marches.</TE>
<TE>   The Basque government said it decided not to allow the protests
after a demonstration last Sunday in San Sebastian turned violent and
featured shouts in support of the ETA, short for Basque Homeland and
Freedom.</TE>
<TE>   After the march ended peacefully, Basque riot police clashed with
masked Batasuna supporters in the streets of central San Sebastian. A
local man who was not part of the demonstration lost an eye when
police fired rubber bullets at demonstrators who were hurling bottles
and smashing windows.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish police have been shutting down the offices and property of
Batasuna on orders from High Court Judge Baltasar Garzon.</TE>

<HD>Hussein Must Go, Blair Says</HD>
<DH>Europe: Regime in Iraq poses a threat to the global
community, the British leader asserts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET STOBART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister Tony Blair on Tuesday began to make the case for
backing a U.S. preemptive war to topple Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, although the British leader called military action "a last
resort."</LD>
<LD>   Resuming the role of chief U.S. ally and advocate that he played
ahead of the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan, Blair laid out the reasons
he believes Hussein presents a threat to the international community
and promised to publish within a few weeks evidence of Iraq's efforts
to develop weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   "I do believe that the threat posed by the current Iraqi regime is
real," Blair told a news conference in his parliamentary district of
Sedgefield, in northeastern England. "This isn't just an issue for
the U.S., it is an issue for Britain, it is an issue for the wider
world.</LD>
<TE>   "America shouldn't have to face this issue alone--we should face
it together," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Harking back to the U.S.-led military campaigns in Afghanistan and
Kosovo, Blair stated his belief that "there is no such thing now as a
regional conflict that stays regional."</TE>
<TE>   Blair fielded questions for more than an hour and a half, during
which time he repeatedly echoed the Bush administration's arguments
for ousting the Iraqi leader. He said Hussein was "without any
question" still trying to develop Iraq's chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons capability.</TE>
<TE>   "We're dealing with a regime that routinely tortures and executes
its political opponents, was probably responsible for up to 100,000
Kurdish people dying in a brutal campaign, that was responsible for a
million people dying in the Iran-Iraq war, the annexation of Kuwait
and that we know ... is trying to develop these appalling weapons
and, indeed, has actually used these weapons against their own
people," Blair said.</TE>
<TE>   "Either the regime functions in an entirely different way, or the
regime has to change."</TE>
<TE>   Blair argued for the return of United Nations weapons inspectors
to Iraq and vowed that Britain would not "rush in with preemptory
action without thinking it through. We didn't in Kosovo, we didn't in
Afghanistan, we won't do it this time."</TE>
<TE>   But while promising a full public debate ahead of any British
military participation, he stressed his intention to support the Bush
administration, which increasingly appears headed toward a war
against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "If the 11th of September teaches us anything, it teaches us the
importance of not waiting for the threat to materialize, but ...
dealing with it," Blair said. "How we deal with it is an open
question, but that we have to deal with it isn't."</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon, Blair dedicated himself to making the moral and legal case
against the suspected mastermind of the assaults, Osama bin Laden.
The prime minister called a special session of Parliament to present
the first dossier of evidence against Bin Laden and the Taliban
regime in Afghanistan--much as he now appears ready to do against
Iraq's Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Blair and members of his Cabinet traveled the globe to shore up
international support for a U.S.-led war in Afghanistan, in which
Britain later provided more support than any other nation.</TE>
<TE>   Blair has remained one of the staunchest backers of the Bush
administration's declared war on terrorism. He argues that Bin
Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network could just as easily have attacked
London and Paris as New York and Washington and that it is the
responsibility of the international community to face down the
threat.</TE>
<TE>   Blair could well turn out to be the Bush administration's prime
source of public support internationally for a war in Iraq. France,
Germany, Russia and most of the Arab world have come out against a
campaign to oust Hussein, and several Republicans inside and outside
the Bush administration have expressed reservations about the need to
take military action.</TE>
<TE>   A majority of the U.S. public supports a Bush-led war, while 70%
of Britons are opposed to such action.</TE>
<TE>   Blair's remarks were met with criticism Tuesday from members of
Parliament who oppose a war. Labor Party lawmaker George Galloway
said that Britons were "deeply anxious about being driven this close
to a cliff by a president like Mr. Bush" and that Blair had failed to
reassure them.</TE>
<TE>   "The prime minister has thrown in his lot with the most right-wing
faction of the Republican administration in Washington, betraying
even the Colin Powell wing, which had been looking for a way out
short of invasion and war," Galloway said.</TE>
<TE>   Facing such criticism at home and dissent within his own Labor
Party over the prospect of British participation in a U.S.-led war,
Blair asserted that his continued support for the United States was
not out of "blind loyalty."</TE>
<TE>   "The reason why I supported the United States of America after the
11th of September was because it was the right thing to do.
International terrorism executed its worst atrocity on the streets of
America, and that was an attack on the whole of the free and
civilized world, and America should not have to face these problems
alone," Blair said.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested that once Britons saw the details of Hussein's
weapons programs and a specific U.S. plan of action, opinion was
likely to swing toward support for the mission. Asked why he had yet
to present the evidence, he said public debate had overtaken his
plans.</TE>
<TE>   "Originally I had the intention that we wouldn't get round to
publishing the dossier until we had actually taken the key decisions,
but I think it is probably a better idea to bring that forward," he
said. "There needs to be some more work and some more checking done,
but I think the best thing to do is publish that within the next few
weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Blair acknowledged that the Arab world viewed the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict as the main problem in the region and
that "we have a responsibility also to deal with that situation....
There should be a just solution in the Middle East, and we should
deal with weapons of mass destruction."</TE>
<TE>   He countered arguments that a war against Hussein would be
perceived as a war on Islam by saying that the people who are
oppressed in Iraq are Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   Blair argued that he hates war as much as anyone. "But if Iraq
should develop and use weapons of mass destruction ... and I thought
back and could have done something about it, then that would be
something on my conscience too," he said.</TE>

<LD>Ecuador kicked off the campaign for October's presidential election,
the first national vote since an Indian uprising backed by military
officers toppled President Jamil Mahuad two years ago and installed
his vice president, Gustavo Noboa.</LD>
<LD>   Banana millionaire Alvaro Noboa, who is not related to the current
president, leads the pack of 10 candidates. He is backed by a party
he created after he lost his first bid for president to Mahuad in
1998. However, it is unclear who is likely to join him in a November
runoff, if no one wins outright.</LD>

<LD>Four main political groups said they will boycott Bahrain's first
parliamentary elections in 28 years to protest measures giving an
appointed body a role equal to that of parliament.</LD>
<LD>   Bahrain's constitution was amended this year to give the appointed
Shura rights on a level with those of the parliament, which will be
elected Oct. 24.</LD>
<LD>   The groups--the National Democratic Action Society, the National
Democratic Society, Alwefaq National Islamic Society and the Islamic
Action Society--announced their boycott in a joint statement but said
they might reconsider if the situation changed.</LD>

<LD>Six men filed an appeal of their death sentences, asking a court to
overturn their convictions in the gang rape of a woman that was
ordered by a tribal council to punish her family.</LD>
<LD>   The six were convicted last weekend and sentenced to hang in the
case, which drew international criticism of Pakistan's tradition of
tribal justice and the status of women in rural areas.</LD>
<LD>   Defense lawyer Malik Salim said the judge's decision, rendered
shortly after midnight Sunday, "is not maintainable according to the
law and facts of the case." He said the six should all have been
acquitted.</LD>

<LD>   Myrna Mack was stabbed 27 times outside her Guatemala City office
Sept. 11, 1990. In 1993, Sgt. Noel de Jesus Beteta was sentenced to

Augusto Godoy and retired Cols. Juan Valencia Osorio and Juan
Guillermo Oliva were charged with being masterminds of the crime, but

<HD>7 Police Officers Killed in Chechnya; Rebels, Russians
Blame Each Other</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>At least seven police officers were killed and 11 injured Tuesday
when an army truck came under fire in Russia's separatist Chechnya
region, which has been jolted in recent weeks by an upsurge of
violence.</LD>
<LD>   The Russian military said the officers, all ethnic Chechens, hit a
rebel mine and then came under heavy fire while traveling through
Shali, 18 miles southeast of the regional capital, Grozny.</LD>
<LD>   But local authorities said Russian forces had mistakenly fired the
first shots. One senior Russian official accused Moscow's troops of
"sloppiness." The office of the Kremlin's Chechnya spokesman
confirmed the casualties but gave no details.</LD>
<TE>   Violence has been rising in Chechnya, where Russian forces are
engaged in a second post-Soviet drive to crush separatists.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, separatists shot down a helicopter troop carrier,
killing 118 servicemen in the worst disaster to hit the military
since Moscow sent troops back to Chechnya in 1999. Rebels downed a
helicopter gunship last week, killing two pilots.</TE>
<TE>   "The victims were local boys. They were coming back in six, seven
vehicles when they were either blown up or hit something," Akhmad
Kadyrov, head of the pro-Moscow administration, told Russian
television.</TE>
<TE>   Television reports showed a battered truck, its interior sprayed
with blood and its doors riddled with bullets.</TE>
<TE>   Moscow claims to have full control over Chechnya, but its troops
suffer almost daily losses and pro-Moscow Chechen officials and
police are regular targets.</TE>
<TE>   Rebel spokesmen said Russians were responsible for the attack,
which "should serve as a good lesson for those Chechens who continue
to cooperate with the Russian occupiers."</TE>
<TE>   The commander of Moscow's forces in Chechnya, Gen. Vladimir
Moltenskoi, said rebels had mounted a "planned, prepared attack" on
police returning from a search operation.</TE>
<TE>   Local officials dismissed the military version and said forces
from a local Russian regiment had opened fire in error.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard artillery fire coming from the regiment. My bodyguard
was outside and woke me up. He said a shell had hit a target in the
town center," Shaid Alikhadjiev, the top local official, told ORT
television.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul-Khakim Sultygov, Moscow's human rights envoy in Chechnya,
urged local officials to take firmer control. "Can we stop all this
lack of discipline and sloppiness that leads to the deaths of
servicemen and civilians? I hope civilian authorities will prove they
have real control," he told ORT.</TE>
<TE>   The new wave of violence coincided with a fact-finding visit to
Chechnya by the Council of Europe.</TE>

<HD>Siblings Set to Be Exiled to Gaza</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Palestinians accused of aiding their brother in
terror act are to be deported under new Israeli ruling. Rights groups
cry foul.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Sometime today, Kifah and Intisar Ajouri are to be deposited on
Israel's border with the Gaza Strip to begin a two-year exile in that
Palestinian-ruled backwater miles from their home.</LD>
<LD>   The brother and sister are the first Palestinians to be deported
under a new Israeli Supreme Court ruling that allows the army to
"relocate" relatives of militants from the West Bank to the Gaza
Strip.</LD>
<LD>   In a unanimous decision by a panel expanded to include nine
judges, the court, however, limited the army's power by saying there
must be proof that the relatives acted as accomplices to the
terrorist act and pose a potential security threat.</LD>
<TE>   The decision carries enormous repercussions by enshrining the
forced transfer of people not convicted of crimes and marks the first
time in a decade that Israel will expel Palestinians as policy.</TE>
<TE>   For the Ajouris, the court accepted the argument of the Israeli
army and government that the two had assisted their brother Ali in
orchestrating a suicide bombing in July. Kifah allegedly served as a
lookout for Ali, while Intisar was accused of sewing the explosive
belts used by suicide bombers. The Ajouris denied the charges.</TE>
<TE>   A third Palestinian who also was part of the decision, Abed Nasser
Assida, will not be banished because the state failed to establish
his connection to his brother's alleged terrorist operations, the
court said.</TE>
<TE>   The government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, seeking ways to
crush a nearly 2-year-old Palestinian uprising, had in recent weeks
reinstituted the demolition of Palestinian homes and added the threat
of deportations to its arsenal. The measures are designed to dissuade
other Palestinians from attacking Israelis, the government argued.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Israel's highest judicial body has been reluctant to
challenge the military in security matters. On Tuesday, however, the
court said it was trying to strike a balance between human rights and
the security concerns of a nation that sees itself at war.</TE>
<TE>   "In this balance, human rights cannot receive complete protection
as if there were no terror, and state security cannot receive
complete protection as if there were no human rights," Chief Justice
Aharon Barak wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "A delicate and sensitive balance is required," he added. "This is
the price of democracy."</TE>
<TE>   Critics and proponents alike found something to embrace and
something to condemn in the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials and leading human rights organizations such
as Amnesty International branded the expulsion practice a war crime.
In court, attorneys for Assida and the Ajouris argued that forced
transfer is a collective punishment barred by the Fourth Geneva
Convention governing the behavior of an occupying state.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a sad and black day," Palestinian Cabinet minister Saeb
Erekat said.</TE>
<TE>   "We lost," said Jessica Montell, director of the Israeli human
rights organization B'Tselem, "but the decision of the high court
will deter the state from using deportation [readily]. It's clearly
not going to be the effective deterrent measure that the state was
looking for. That's the silver lining."</TE>
<TE>   The government argued that the Geneva Conventions allow "assigned
residency" of people within the occupied territory. Because the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip are part of one entity, the state argued,
transfer from one part to the other is allowed.</TE>
<TE>   But human rights attorneys countered that since the West Bank and
Gaza are not contiguous territory, and since Israel bars Palestinian
travel between the two areas, expulsion from one to the other is
tantamount to expulsion to a separate entity.</TE>
<TE>   Gaza is easier for the Israelis to control because, unlike the
West Bank, it is fenced in.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Justice Minister Meir Sheetrit praised the ruling for
adding a weapon to the nation's arsenal. It proved, he said, that the
"justices of the court are in tune with the Israeli people." There is
wide support among Israelis for expulsions and other tough measures.</TE>
<TE>   Hard-liners said the ruling didn't go far enough.</TE>
<TE>   "The intention behind the relocation was that the suicide bomber
whose mother knows about his intentions will know that she would be
left without a roof over her head," said Gideon Ezra, deputy internal
security minister and a former intelligence official. "Instead of
putting these people in jail, they will now be able to sew explosive
belts in Gaza. There's no doubt that today's ruling will tie the
security establishment's hands in its war against terror."</TE>
<TE>   The court delayed the Ajouris' expulsion by a day, granting a
request that they be allowed a final meeting with their families at
the Ofer military base, just north of Jerusalem, where they are being
held. Later today, the army will transport the siblings to a crossing
point into the Gaza Strip and presumably deliver them to Palestinian
security officials.</TE>
<TE>   "They are terribly worried," said Dalia Kerstein, director of a
human rights law organization representing the Ajouris. "They were
asking lots of questions. Will they be accepted? What do they do,
where do they go? They don't know anyone in Gaza."</TE>
<TE>   In the Askar refugee camp outside Nablus where the Ajouri family
lives, the siblings' mother, Rashida, and other relatives received
the news with bitterness.</TE>
<TE>   Israel accused Ali Ajouri of dispatching two suicide bombers who
killed five people in Tel Aviv in July. Two days after the bombing,
army bulldozers demolished the home of the mother, her five sons,
their families and Intisar, who is single.</TE>
<TE>   A few days after that, Israeli forces hunted down and killed Ali.</TE>

<HD>Flooded-Out Czechs Are Allowed to Return Home</HD>
<DH>Europe: Thousands leave shelters after areas around Prague
reopen. Others must stay put.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PRAGUE, Czech Republic</DL>
<LD>Thousands of residents of the Czech capital moved out of shelters and
went home Tuesday, more than three weeks after the worst flooding in
nearly 200 years forced their evacuation.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities reopened parts of Prague's low-lying Karlin district,
which was hit hard last month by flood waters of the Vltava River.
Thousands of other Prague residents, however, were ordered to remain
in shelters while emergency workers checked for hazards, said Martin
Kupka, a city hall spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   Three apartment buildings collapsed in Karlin because of water
damage, and 40 buildings have been declared at risk. Experts warned
that more houses in the area might be declared uninhabitable.</LD>
<TE>   The floods that struck the Czech Republic last month caused $2.9
billion in damage, and authorities estimate that at least 5,000 new
apartments will have to be built for people who lost their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Floods also forced the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra to move
Saturday's season opening concert from its usual hall near the Vltava
to the Prague Castle, which is on higher ground.</TE>
<TE>   Vaclav Riedlbauch, orchestra manager, estimated damage to
equipment at the Rudolfinum concert hall at more than $3.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Embassy workers, meanwhile, provided equipment to dry out
walls in the town of Terezin, 35 miles north of Prague.</TE>
<TE>   The town, site of a former Nazi concentration camp, was damaged by
the floods. The equipment was donated by the Czech branch of
Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola Inc. and is worth about $10,000.</TE>

<HD>A German Challenger's Parallel Stance</HD>
<DH>Europe: Despite his party's 'Anglo-American mentality,'
Wolfgang Gerhardt offers a foreign policy outlook that is similar to
government's.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>In the view of the man who could soon be Germany's foreign minister,
the government has made a thorough mess of transatlantic relations.</LD>
<LD>   To rectify ties between Europe and the United States, Wolfgang
Gerhardt insists, the country needs the pro-business outlook and
"Anglo-American mentality" of his opposition Free Democratic Party.</LD>
<LD>   But amid U.S. threats to invade Iraq and worldwide worries about
global warming, the party's point man on foreign policy shows
surprisingly little daylight between his positions and those of the
man he wants to supplant, the popular Joschka Fischer.</LD>
<TE>   Like the left-of-center government headed by Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, Gerhardt is skeptical of armed intervention against
Baghdad without United Nations Security Council approval.</TE>
<TE>   And like the governing coalition of Social Democrats and Greens,
Gerhardt laments the White House's refusal to abide by the
pollution-busting Kyoto Protocol or impose its own program for
reducing so-called greenhouse gases.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps even more miffed than the leftist incumbents, Gerhardt
lambastes recent U.S. trade barriers imposed to protect domestic
steel and agricultural products from the free-market forces long
cherished by Washington.</TE>
<TE>   With minor exceptions involving style more than substance, the
Free Democrats' outlook on German-U.S. relations looks strikingly
similar to the status quo.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for example, the challenger's view of the German
contribution to the U.S.-declared war against terrorism, to which
Schroeder pledged his nation's "unlimited solidarity."</TE>
<TE>   Although Berlin has dispatched more than 1,000 troops to the
International Security Assistance Force patrolling the Afghan
capital, Kabul, the State Department has chided Germany for its
flagging commitment to the cause because of Schroeder's resistance to
joining any U.S. attack on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "The war against terrorism has more than a military side,"
Gerhardt, 58, said in an interview, echoing Schroeder and Fischer on
the subject in noting that Germany provides more than half the
development aid to Eastern Europe, Russia and other crisis regions.</TE>
<TE>   "Security is enhanced when people have economic opportunities, and
I say to our American colleagues that they shouldn't underestimate
this aspect," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As they fight to topple Schroeder's government in Sept. 22
elections, Gerhardt and his allies in the conservative Christian
Democratic Union have been quick to criticize the chancellor for
expressing reluctance over any German part in punishing Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   But the opposition parties have been careful not to suggest that
they are any more eager for a military offensive, mindful of the
electorate's opposition to sending more troops abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm of the opinion that even a superpower like the United States
should take care not to overdo it," Gerhardt said.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't achieved our objectives in Afghanistan yet. We have a
very heated situation in Israel and Palestine. We have NATO and
European expansion ahead of us. We're still engaged in the Balkans.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why I believe the Iraq theme should be taken up with
caution and accorded a wiser evaluation."</TE>
<TE>   Party Has 10% Support</TE>
<TE>   The Free Democrats, whose flashy election bandwagon is being
driven by party chief Guido Westerwelle while Gerhardt handles the
more mundane policy matters, currently garner about 10% support in
polls.</TE>
<TE>   Coupled with the roughly 40% saying they favor the Christian
Democrats, the political allies are ahead of the incumbent coalition
by as much as 10 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Gerhardt declined to confirm whether his party has formally
decided who would take on the foreign minister's portfolio in the
event that the opposition wins. But his role in the campaign and his
reported dedication to refreshing his faded English and French make
it clear that he expects to be tapped as the top diplomat.</TE>
<TE>   The FDP's push for tax relief, relaxed employment regulations and
a reduction of state control over the economy had elevated the small
party over the last two years of economic downturn. The party also
managed to weather a scandal this spring when one of its most
prominent members, Juergen Moellemann, voiced sympathy with
Palestinians who commit suicide bombings to express their desperation
over Israeli occupation.</TE>
<TE>   But the party now appears at risk of losing momentum amid
devastating flooding throughout Central Europe that has turned voters
here toward environmental protection--a strength of FDP adversaries
the Greens.</TE>
<TE>   Even on many environmental themes, the Free Democrats' position
vis-a-vis the United States is hardly less troubled than that of
Schroeder or the Greens.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it unfortunately insulting that the United States has
categorically stated it is abandoning the Kyoto Protocol without
adding what it intends to do instead," Gerhardt said, noting the
United States is responsible for about 25% of the world's carbon
dioxide emissions.</TE>
<TE>   While expressing admiration for the American way of life, he
insisted that Americans "must know this is a problem that cannot be
resolved in the context of their lifestyles."</TE>
<TE>   'Eco-Tax' Criticized</TE>
<TE>   Like its conservative allies, the FDP is harshly critical of the
"eco-tax" imposed by the current government that raises the price of
gasoline to nearly $4 a gallon.</TE>
<TE>   The tax hinders neither driving nor the emission of greenhouse
gases, Gerhardt said, accusing the leftist government of using it
simply to bilk the population out of more tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Gerhardt's party espouses significantly different views from the
incumbents in labor-market and energy policy, calling for a
relaxation of restrictions on employers and a retention of nuclear
plants scheduled for shutdown over the next two decades.</TE>
<TE>   But few issues of global reach distinguish the challengers,
especially in the heated trade disputes between Europe and the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   "I consider the legislation on agriculture policy and steel to be
unacceptable," Gerhardt said of recent U.S. measures to protect
farmers and steelworkers.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the man who may be sitting across from Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell in a couple of months contends that it's healthy in
any relationship to discuss problems and conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never been a problem for the FDP to speak its mind with our
transatlantic allies," he said. "This has been more a problem for the
Greens and the Social Democrats, whose political histories are marked
by strong anti-American convictions."</TE>

<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>A knife-wielding man who claimed that he heard voices telling him to
kill people slashed 10 children in a church school cafeteria in the
South Korean capital today, a news agency reported.</LD>
<LD>   The semiofficial Yonhap News Agency said three of the 10 children
suffered severe head and neck injuries after the 53-year-old
unemployed man stormed into the church and attacked.</LD>
<LD>   Police, who were alerted by a school official, arrested the man 30
minutes after the attack. The incident took place as 45 children and
three adults were eating lunch at the Neundong Church in the eastern
Seoul neighborhood of Kunja-Dong.</LD>
<TE>   The victims, students at the church preschool, were seven boys and
three girls. A 6-year-old boy reportedly suffered life-threatening
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The news agency quoted police as saying the man told them that he
had heard voices Tuesday night telling him he would be killed unless
he killed others.</TE>
<TE>   The man was identified only by his family name, Hwang. The news
agency said he lived in the Seoul neighborhood of Sadang.</TE>

<HD>N. Korean Bids for Asylum Continue</HD>
<DH>Asia: In Beijing, 15 people jump a German compound's wall;
20 wait at an embassy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Fifteen North Koreans jumped a wall at a German government compound
Tuesday and were holed up at a school, as a surge in asylum bids by
people fleeing their impoverished, repressive homeland continued.</LD>
<LD>   Also Tuesday, a South Korean official disclosed that at least 20
North Koreans were waiting in the South Korean Embassy in Beijing for
permission from China to leave the country.</LD>
<LD>   The entry into the German compound came a day after a group of 12
North Koreans tried to use a ladder to climb into a diplomatic
apartment complex. They were blocked by Chinese guards, who beat and
kicked them. Eight were detained; the others ran away.</LD>
<TE>   A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, said Tuesday that
he had no information on the status of those detained.</TE>
<TE>   China has let dozens of North Koreans leave for the South since
March, after they sought refuge in foreign embassies and consulates.</TE>
<TE>   The number of asylum bids has jumped in the last two weeks. In
addition to the at least 35 North Koreans in the German compound and
the South Korean Embassy, activists say, as many as 18 others have
been detained by China.</TE>
<TE>   Despite letting some of the asylum seekers go, China has refused
pleas to treat thousands of North Koreans living in its northeast as
refugees. The Communist government, the North Korean government's
last major ally, insists that they are economic migrants.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing is obligated by treaty to send North Koreans home, and
police launch periodic crackdowns aimed at rounding them up.</TE>
<TE>   China has tried to discourage asylum bids by stringing barbed wire
and posting more guards outside embassies, which might be encouraging
North Koreans to switch to other targets such as the German school
compound.</TE>
<TE>   The asylum seekers entered the compound by climbing a wall shortly
before 3 p.m. as students were leaving for the day. Most of the North
Koreans appeared to be in their 20s and 30s, though one man appeared
to be in his 50s or 60s. There were no children.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters saw them walking through the glassed-in hallways of a
nine-story apartment building. A guard chased them out, and they
ended up sitting on an outdoor staircase at the school adjacent to
apartments.</TE>

<HD>Serbs Ordered Cover-Up of Massacre, Witness Says</HD>
<DH>Tribunal: Colonel testifying against the government
exchanges a stare with Milosevic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>THE HAGUE</DL>
<LD>Serbian government officials ordered a cover-up of the remains of 86
Kosovo Albanians found in a truck in the Danube River, a police
colonel testified Tuesday at the war crimes trial of former Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.</LD>
<LD>   Col. Caslav Golubovic headed a regional office of the police in
eastern Serbia when the refrigerated truck was found in April 1999.</LD>
<LD>   The bodies, which included those of women and children, were found
near the Serbian border with Romania, more than 100 miles from
Kosovo, a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic.</LD>
<TE>   Golubovic held Milosevic's gaze with an emotionless stare for
several seconds before taking the oath to testify. The witness said
he received a telephone call from Serbian Gen. Vlastimir Djordjevic a
day after a fisherman found the white Mercedes freezer truck adrift
in the river.</TE>
<TE>   Djordjevic told him "to explore the possibility of transferring
the bodies to a different truck, then transferring them to a burial
place in the area," Golubovic said.</TE>
<TE>   The orders came directly from the Serbian Interior Ministry,
Golubovic said. Former Interior Minister Vlajko Stojiljkovic also
issued instructions not to speak to the media about the incident.</TE>
<TE>   The remains were later sent to Belgrade, the Serbian and Yugoslav
capital, and the truck was destroyed, Golubovic said.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic, who is conducting his own defense at the U.N. court,
has claimed that reports about the truck were invented to incriminate
him. He faces 66 counts of war crimes in connection with a decade of
Balkan conflicts in the 1990s.</TE>

<HD>Russia Grounds 'N Sync Star's Aspirations for Space Travel</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: Officials say Lance Bass' sponsors failed to
make good on $20-million rocket fare.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>To 'N Sync star Lance Bass' dream of becoming the youngest
extraterrestrial traveler, the Russian Space Agency on Tuesday said,
"Bye, bye, bye."</LD>
<LD>   Sponsors for the teen idol's October flight aboard a Russian Soyuz
rocket to the International Space Station failed to deliver the
$20-million fare despite repeated extensions, space agency spokesman
Sergei A. Gorbunov told reporters.</LD>
<LD>   "It's over," Gorbunov said of Bass' space mission, for which the
23-year-old singer has already trained for two months at Star City, a
facility about 25 miles northeast of Moscow.</LD>
<TE>   Bass will be billed for the accommodations and preparation he
received at the cosmonaut training center, the space agency spokesman
added without specifying the sum.</TE>
<TE>   The singer could not be reached for comment in Star City or at a
luxury Moscow hotel where he kept a room until Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the first two space tourists--California businessman Dennis
Tito and South African Internet magnate Mark Shuttleworth--Bass
wasn't planning to cover his own expenses. A consortium of television
and film producers was to have put up the money in return for rights
to a documentary series on the pop star's experience. Bass also
planned to speak to students via ham radio while aboard the station.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Russian announcement could be a pressure tactic to
force Bass' backers to pay, Gorbunov said the decision was final. The
singer, who had been publicly marveling at the chance to realize a
lifelong fantasy of traveling to outer space, was sent packing from
Star City just two days after returning Sunday from a crew trip to
Houston for the final phase of training.</TE>
<TE>   Bass remained in Russia and was still "convinced that he is going
to fly," Jeffrey Manber, a liaison between the Russian Space Agency
and those seeking to buy the experience of space travel, told
Associated Press on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a little dramatic to say he was kicked out," Manber said.
"He was training at Star City yesterday. He is not training today,
but he will be back there probably tomorrow or the day after."</TE>
<TE>   The delay in payment, Manber said, was a technical problem on
which the sponsors were earnestly working and mindful that "the clock
is ticking."</TE>
<TE>   Gorbunov's announcement suggested that the clock had stopped. The
agency spokesman expressed frustration over what he called "crude
violations" of the travel contract, and he spoke with finality in
saying that a cargo container would travel in the singer's place.</TE>
<TE>   Bass had beat out at least two other paying contenders for a seat
on the Soyuz craft, which will blast off Oct. 28 with Russian
commander Sergei Zaletin and Belgian colleague Frank de Winne.</TE>
<TE>   Training for spaceflight takes months and there is too little time
to allow another candidate to prepare, Gorbunov said.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if one of them pays $40 million instead of $20 million, he
will not be able to join the space mission," Gorbunov said, adding
that other partners in the International Space Station, including
NASA, must sign off on lay passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Bass began testing for the mission in April and was confirmed by
the Russian program in July. He spent most of the summer in exercises
involving zero-gravity flight, emergency response measures and
Russian-language education.</TE>
<TE>   Although Zaletin initially expressed reservations about taking the
pop star on board, he told a news conference in Houston last week
that he had since been convinced that Bass had what it takes to make
the voyage.</TE>
<TE>   During the crew trip to Johnson Space Center, NASA gave its
blessing to the singer's participation despite concerns earlier about
his readiness. Bass had acknowledged that he made little progress on
learning Russian, which is required of all Soyuz travelers to
facilitate communication in an emergency.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Asks Sudan to Resume Talks</HD>
<DH>Africa: A State Department official says he got assurances
that a break in the peace negotiations with the rebels is temporary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>The United States urged Sudan on Tuesday to resume much-heralded
peace talks, even as the African nation's leader ordered his generals
to launch an offensive against rebels who have seized a key garrison
town.</LD>
<LD>   President Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir broke off the talks this week
after the main guerrilla group, the Sudan People's Liberation Army,
captured the southern town of Torit, about 70 miles southeast of the
Nile River port of Juba.</LD>
<LD>   Bashir recalled more than 50 members of a peace delegation who
were meeting near Nairobi, Kenya's capital, with rebel leaders to
negotiate an end to Sudan's 19-year-old civil war. He accused the
SPLA of violating earlier agreements by attacking
government-controlled areas.</LD>
<TE>   "Take every path and use all weapons," a government-owned
newspaper quoted Bashir as telling his military.</TE>
<TE>   However, Walter Kansteiner, the U.S. assistant secretary of State
for African affairs, met with both sides here Tuesday and said there
was "enough of a commitment from both parties for talks to make real
progress." He said the Sudanese government assured him the disruption
in talks was only temporary.</TE>
<TE>   "Both parties reconfirmed that there is no possibility of a
military victory for either side," Kansteiner said. "A negotiated
settlement is the only answer. But to get there, both sides need to
be at the negotiating table."</TE>
<TE>   Several analysts agreed Tuesday, dismissing the government's
action as gamesmanship and saying it was only a matter of time before
its negotiators returned to Machakos, a small agricultural town in
Kenya where the talks were being held.</TE>
<TE>   "This is merely an opportunistic move by some government officials
to delay the talks," said John Prendergast, a member of the White
House National Security Council during the Clinton administration.
"They think the talks are going too far too fast, and they need to
pull back and slow it down."</TE>
<TE>   The Sudanese conflict pits the Muslim-dominated government in the
north against rebels seeking autonomy for people practicing
Christianity and traditional African religions in the south.</TE>
<TE>   The government came under intense criticism from some Islamist
hard-liners after agreeing in July to a rebel demand that Islamic law
not be enforced in the south. In what was widely hailed as a
breakthrough, the government also agreed that southerners would hold
a referendum--six years after a final peace deal--to decide whether
to secede.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement on two of the most contentious issues surprised many
analysts and drew predictions that both parties were nearing a
comprehensive peace accord. Even former Sen. John C. Danforth
(R-Mo.), President Bush's special peace envoy to Sudan, predicted
during a stopover in Nairobi two weeks ago that a written deal would
be reached by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S., Britain, Norway and several of Sudan's African neighbors
have been pushing both sides to end the war, which has killed an
estimated 2 million people and caused millions more to flee their
homes.</TE>
<TE>   The recent discovery of oil in southern Sudan has complicated
matters, with the Bashir government clearing thousands of southern
villagers from their homes to make the area safe for Asian and
European oil companies. The regime has used oil money to buy
helicopter gunships and other sophisticated weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the interim agreements, fierce fighting continues in
southern Sudan in the absence of a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   Cease-fire talks were expected to begin later this week, according
to Lazaro Sumbeiywo, a Kenyan army lieutenant general who is heading
the peace talks. Negotiators also were scheduled to discuss how to
share oil revenues and include rebel leaders in the central
government.</TE>
<TE>   Prendergast, a Sudan specialist with the International Crisis
Group, a Brussels-based think tank, said that by pulling out of the
talks, the government was attempting to press its agenda of securing
a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   "They want an early cease-fire so they can start exploiting the
oil and mineral resources in the south before other agreements are in
place," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have called on Bush to become more involved in the peace
talks by telephoning participants, as U.S. leaders have done at times
in the Middle East peace process.</TE>
<TE>   But on Tuesday, Sumbeiywo said involving Bush was not yet
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't like to use big clubs when [we] can use twigs and
sticks," he said.</TE>

<HD>Women Claim a Victory at U.N. Summit</HD>
<DH>Development: Delegates manage to get the finalized document
reopened to add words on rights and reproductive health.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>The issue of women's rights and reproductive health caused delegates
at a U.N. development summit here to stumble briefly Tuesday in their
mad dash to wrap up a global plan to reduce poverty and
simultaneously protect the planet.</LD>
<LD>   Final negotiations on the plan were completed Monday. However,
delegates from Canada and Europe succeeded early today to reopen the
document and add a few words that they said were needed to guarantee
women's rights to contraception, safe abortion and other reproductive
services.</LD>
<LD>   "We won. We won," said June Zeitlin, executive director of the
nonprofit Women's Environment and Development Organization. "Never
underestimate the women of the world."</LD>
<TE>   Zeitlin and U.N. officials said language added to the health-care
paragraph of the plan matches wording used in other international
declarations on the topic. Their efforts had been opposed by a
coalition that includes the United States, the Vatican and
conservative Islamic countries.</TE>
<TE>   After hours of intense negotiations, Zeitlin said, delegates
"added the language that we've been asking for and put it in a
slightly different place in the paragraph," she said. "It's a
distinction without a difference, but it saved face."</TE>
<TE>   The 10-day World Summit on Sustainable Development is scheduled to
end today. The more than 100 assembled heads of state or government
are first expected to adopt the plan, which is designed to bring
clean water, sanitation and energy to the poor while protecting the
environment and preventing further extinction of species.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell--standing in for President
Bush, who opted not to attend--arrived at the conference late Tuesday
and will address the gathering today. His speech will follow two days
of on-again, off-again Bush bashing at the summit, mostly over the
issue of global warming.</TE>
<TE>   Other world leaders continued to express their disappointment that
the U.S. abandoned the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty
designed to control "greenhouse" gas emissions, which are being
blamed for rapid climate changes.</TE>
<TE>   Russian Prime Minister Mikhail M. Kasyanov on Tuesday used the
world stage here to announce that his nation would soon ratify the
protocol, following by one day an announcement by Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien, who said he would submit the treaty to his
Parliament this year for approval.</TE>
<TE>   If these two nations join Japan and the European Union, their
collective support surpasses the threshold needed for the accord to
take effect without the blessing of the United States, which opposes
some of the protocol's restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christine Todd
Whitman said that she was pleased to see other nations step forward
to support the protocol but that the Bush administration still
intends to pursue, on its own, ways to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions from fossil fuel.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never acted as obstructionists for other countries," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of women's reproductive rights triggered protests both
inside and outside the convention center. "Women's rights are human
rights," Nkosazana Zuma, South Africa's foreign minister, said
Tuesday. "Health is a human right."</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for women complained that the plan, at more than 70
pages, retreated from standard language that has been carefully
crafted in other United Nations declarations to balance the interests
of religious conservatives with the rights of women to control their
health care and future.</TE>
<TE>   Usually such texts explain that health services provided should be
consistent with "cultural and religious values," which pleases
conservatives, but also conform with "human rights and fundamental
freedoms," which satisfies women's groups.</TE>
<TE>   Zonibel Woods of Action Canada for Population and Development said
the document, as drafted in committees and agreed upon Monday, lacked
the second half of the language.</TE>
<TE>   Without such an expression of human rights, some countries could
hide behind their laws and local customs to justify everything from
genital excision to denying women health care, she and U.N. officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Under Taliban rule in Afghanistan, she said, "women couldn't go to
the hospital, because women were not allowed to be doctors and women
patients were not allowed to be examined by male doctors. President
Bush, in responding to the anti-choice, pro-life lobby, is promoting
behavior that the Taliban would have found completely acceptable."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration had said it opposed changing the language
of the plan for procedural reasons and because debate over the issue
would have distracted delegates from the other major issues they
faced.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. Population Fund, which recently had $34 million in
funding blocked by the Bush administration, notes that 70,000 women
die every year from unsafe abortions, and 585,000 perish during
pregnancy and childbirth due to inadequate health care.</TE>
<TE>   "Rights to reproductive health care is a matter of life and death
for women throughout the world," said William A. Ryan of the U.N.
agency.</TE>
<TE>   Delegates also continued to negotiate early today over the
language of a political declaration that will be released at the end
of the summit.</TE>
<TE>   With that process bogged down in the slow and often messy
democratic process, former Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
several other Nobel Peace Prize winners issued their own
"Johannesburg declaration." The statement urged the world leaders to
take swift action to help the poor and protect the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Gorbachev, who is president of the environmental group Green Cross
International, urged that the meeting of so many leaders not be
squandered. "If we fail to act decisively and strongly, we will be
judged harshly by future generations," he said. "We should win the
battle for the planet."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Looking at Use of 'Coercive Inspections'</HD>
<DH>Iraq: Under one proposal, arms monitors would be backed by
foreign troops who could shoot their way into suspicious sites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a bid to forge a global strategy toward Iraq and prevent any
wiggle room for President Saddam Hussein, the Bush administration is
exploring tough proposals that would force Baghdad to quickly open
its doors to aggressive weapons inspections or face immediate
punitive action, according to U.S. officials.</LD>
<LD>   The proposals center on "coercive inspections," which would speed
the search for weapons and potentially even back up the inspectors
with thousands of U.S. or multinational troops deployed in or around
Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   One idea under consideration suggests that if inspectors are
turned away from a site suspected of producing or hiding weapons of
mass destruction, foreign troops could shoot their way in, say
sources familiar with the proposals.</LD>
<TE>   Another idea for the "comply or else" effort suggests that
inspectors go quickly to the most sensitive Iraqi sites suspected of
links to nuclear, biological or chemical weapons or ballistic
missiles. If Baghdad refused access, the inspectors would report
immediately to the U.N., with the implicit understanding that a
single refusal could provoke or justify a full military assault to
oust the regime.</TE>
<TE>   Judging from his past actions, Hussein may be reluctant to accept
any such proposals. But if the Bush administration could rally
international support for a common strategy, Hussein might feel
significant new pressure from U.S. allies who have otherwise been
reluctant to back military force.</TE>
<TE>   "The thinking is still in the early stages, but coercive
inspections are one way of bringing the international community into
the planning of what happens next. It could also serve as a casus
belli [cause for justifying war] when the Iraqis refuse to abide by
it, as they will," said a well-placed U.S. official who requested
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the proposals may require a new U.N. resolution,
particularly if Iraq is called on to accept the deployment of foreign
troops. Although debate is likely to be vigorous, U.S. officials
predicted, other members of the Security Council may end up
supporting the tough proposals as a way to avoid an imminent war.</TE>
<TE>   They are also an alternative to previous inspections, which proved
unsuccessful at tracking down weapons of mass destruction. Baghdad
dragged what was supposed to be an 18-month process, begun at the end
of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, into almost eight years of U.N.
inspections, which continued until 1998--when the last team departed
because of looming U.S.-led airstrikes. Iraq has refused to allow the
inspectors to return.</TE>
<TE>   As currently structured, the U.N. inspections call for a
methodical--and very slow--process of first building a baseline of
suspected sites and then systematically tracking down weapons,
equipment and documents and setting up monitors to ensure that
facilities are not used again for arms production. Creating a
baseline could take as long as a year, if done properly, and would
delay Washington's ability to act militarily, according to former
weapons inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Coercive sanctions also are designed to avoid a fatal flaw from
the earlier inspectors' standoffs with the Iraqi government. In a
1992 episode at Baghdad's Ministry of Agriculture, U.N. inspectors
were kept from entering the building as Iraqi officials were seen
carrying boxes of documents related to nuclear programs out the back
door.</TE>
<TE>   Because the U.N. inspections had no backup, the incident passed
without consequences--and former inspectors are not sure to this day
that they obtained all the documents.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the chief weapons inspector was mandated to chronicle
violations and report them to the Security Council every few months.</TE>
<TE>   The new proposals reflect the growing debate on inspections as the
focus shifts from military strategy to the political challenges of
confronting Baghdad. What to do about the inspections process,
mandated by the United Nations and long supported by the United
States, is the question on which the timing--and perhaps the
outcome--of the administration's confrontation with Iraq may now
turn.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq said Tuesday that it was prepared to discuss the return of
inspectors, but only in the context of lifting economic sanctions and
ending foreign intervention.</TE>
<TE>   "If anybody can have a magic solution so that all these issues are
being dealt with together, equitably and reasonably, we are ready to
find such a solution, and we are ready to cooperate with the United
Nations," Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz said after talks with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan at an international summit on
development being held in South Africa. "Sanctions, the continuous
aggression, threats of war--all these issues have to be addressed."</TE>
<TE>   After their talks, Annan said Iraq had not moved any closer to
accepting inspections, even though the majority of countries on the
Security Council want them resumed.</TE>
<TE>   The new focus on how to make inspections more robust reflects the
growing skepticism in Washington over their effectiveness under the
old rules of engagement--and the quandary over how to accommodate
long-standing U.N. resolutions and virtual unanimity around the world
about sending the inspectors back.</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Dick Cheney last week questioned whether returning
inspectors to Iraq would ever lead to disarmament. Inspections that
fail to eliminate weapons of mass destruction would be "useless," he
said. Yet over the weekend, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell told
the BBC that returning the inspectors should be America's "first
step."</TE>
<TE>   The seeming gap in statements doesn't mean anyone in the
administration rejects inspections, White House officials said
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The vice president was saying that the last ones didn't work
because Saddam Hussein was pulling cheat-and-retreat tricks right
under the U.N. noses. But that doesn't mean all inspections in the
future will not work. There has to be a more robust inspections
regime in place to ensure Iraq is disarmed," said Mary Matalin,
counselor to the vice president.</TE>
<TE>   At the Pentagon on Tuesday, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld
charged that Iraq has been playing the U.N. inspections process "like
a guitar, plucking the right string and the right process at the
right moment. And then you'll find at the last moment, they'll
withdraw that carrot and go back into their other mode of thumbing
their nose at the international community."</TE>
<TE>   The various proposals on coercive inspections, which are now being
circulated within the administration and some of which are outlined
in a report to be released Friday by the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, would accommodate the concerns within the
administration as well as the outside world, according to the sources
familiar with the talks.</TE>
<TE>   Congress also is getting into the debate. Though many on Capitol
Hill welcome renewed inspections, they also remain skeptical about
how the inspections would substantially alter the situation. Some are
now indicating support for toughened rules of engagement.</TE>
<TE>   Inspections are widely viewed as a step that must be taken to
demonstrate Hussein's recalcitrance and to help build international
support for military action.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Bob Graham (D-Fla.)
believes that strict conditions can be added to ensure that the
inspections are meaningful.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has suggested giving Iraq a two-week
deadline to get inspectors on the ground. "What the administration
worries about, with some justification, is some long, drawn-out,
word-parsing exercise that would stretch out to months," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) remained
skeptical. "If they did let inspectors back in, would they really be
able to locate the right location and find out what they were up to?"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has invited congressional leaders today for talks
on the administration's thinking and plans on Iraq. President Bush,
Cheney and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice will brief
lawmakers in the morning, and Rumsfeld will brief them at closed
hearings in the afternoon.</TE>

<HD>Zambia OKs Offer to Study Altered Food</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>Zambia's president said Tuesday that he would accept U.S. offers to
provide his country with research on genetically modified food, after
Zambia rejected grain over worries about its safety.</LD>
<LD>   Though nearly 2.5 million Zambians face starvation because of food
shortages, the government recently turned down U.S. corn donations
that might be genetically modified, saying the corn could pose health
risks. U.S. officials offered to help Zambia study modified food.</LD>
<LD>   President Levy Mwanawasa told the World Summit on Sustainable
Development in Johannesburg that he would send researchers to the
U.S. U.S. officials confirmed Zambia's acceptance of the offer.</LD>

<HD>Cathedral Isn't for Everyone on Its Day of Dedication</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Cardinal Roger Mahony gave his liturgy before the
special-invite-only audience at the inauguration of the nearly
$200-million Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels on Monday, many of
the city's faithful, who traveled from all corners of the city to
catch a glimpse of the much-hyped edifice, were turned away. I, like
many others who had the day off this Labor Day holiday and went in
hopes of getting blessed at the new cathedral, never got beyond the
chain-link fence surrounding the security-guard-laden perimeter.</LD>
<LD>   After the disappointment of being denied entrance, I stood on
Grand Avenue as person after person was turned away, many of them old
Latina ladies with rosary beads around their necks. After the
service, those on the way out were mostly affluent technocrats with
gift shop bags in hand. It was a sad sight for the troubled Catholic
Church. As one man who complained to the guard after being turned
away put it, "God doesn't deny you entrance into his kingdom because
you're poor. Why do you?" I guess some things never change.</LD>
<LD>   Oscar Cisneros</LD>
<TE>   San Diego</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the spin, the new cathedral is spiritless, the
building boxy, the interior pedestrian--like the CEO prelate who had
it built. The tapestries, though meant to defer to Jose Rafael
Moneo's "masterpiece," are indicative of the whole within, as
unimaginative and shallow as the heralded architecture. Only the
altar stands as a work of art, and perhaps the body of the Madonna,
but definitely not her hard-featured face. If this structure is
supposed to symbolize the future, how boring it's going to be. If, on
the other hand, this cathedral is supposed to be struggling to find
our communal identity, then perhaps at that it has succeeded and
reflects Los Angeles, a place perhaps sadly spiritless, more spin
than substance--hardly inspiring or given to true enthusiasm (from
the Greek, meaning "God within").</TE>
<TE>   What a disappointment; nothing spirals up to the sky, reaching for
the indefinable, imperishable, incomprehensible we call the
liberating God of love, so it fails to touch the spiritual depths of
our being as well. The cathedral could have been ultramodern and done
that; unfortunately, it did not.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent Virom Coppola</TE>
<TE>   North Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This cathedral is a monolith to the god of conspicuous
consumption. With so much poverty in the world, this superficial
display of the church's wealth is a disgrace. Hospitals, housing for
the homeless, the work of Mother Teresa--these are the true works of
God.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Eckardt</TE>
<TE>   Los Osos</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I thank Steve Lopez for his many months of unflattering potshots
at the cathedral ("Parking Fee May Pave Way to Forgiveness, Even
Heaven," Aug. 30). Nothing has galvanized my support for the
cathedral as much as his facile criticism and shrill writing.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez laments steep parking fees at the cathedral. Then, sentences
later, he admits that parking "will be validated for those attending
Mass." That kind of contradiction helps me pinpoint the paving
stone-size chip on the journalist's shoulder. But I worry that Lopez
will think his efforts have been for naught. Despite his inveighing
against it, the cathedral opened this week. It will serve as a sacred
space for our community long after his writings have turned to dust.
The least we can do in return is give him a free parking space.</TE>
<TE>   John W. Christian</TE>
<TE>   South Pasadena</TE>

<TE>   Kudos for the best Lopez column yet on the "Taj Mahony." Mahony is
the personification of greed, self-indulgence and vanity. He makes
Ken Lay of Enron look like a monk who took a vow of poverty. The
Reformation was at least in part about the corruption of selling
indulgences to build St. Peter's in Rome. Not much has changed in 500
years. Except now, Mahony and his ilk are selling wine, crypts and
parking. Somebody should sue Caltrans to prevent California taxpayers
from funding Mahony's $25-million private driveway off the freeway.</TE>

<HD>No Mandate in Public's Views About Iraq War</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Public Still Backs Military Move on Iraq," Sept. 2: I am appalled
and angered by the way the Times Poll is being used by news outlets
to twist what is at best tenuous public support for a war on Iraq
into a virtual mandate. The central question in your survey asked
whether the respondent would support a decision to order U.S. troops
into a ground war once such a decision had been made; you did not ask
whether the respondent wants to see that happen. This is an extremely
significant difference, given the typical American's attitude toward
protesting a war once it has begun.</LD>
<LD>   Your phrasing implies that we are bystanders who can simply agree
or disagree with the president, not citizens who might participate in
the process. And now your very small survey is being bandied about by
the warmongers and will surely be cited for years as evidence that
President Bush acted democratically. Nice job, folks!</LD>

<TE>   I am wondering who does these polls and who is polled. I have been
a registered voter for 50 years and have never been polled. It seems
to me that any parent with a son or daughter who would be put in
harm's way would be dead set against a war. And it doesn't matter if
the president goes it alone or has the approval of Congress. There is
a huge difference of opinion among his own Cabinet, with the hawks
pitted against the doves. Why doesn't Bush No. 2 have a
heart-to-heart talk with Bush No. 1--Barbara, that is?</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Baruch</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I remember many of those who voted for Bush saying that he would
have world-class advisors to help him decide tough international
issues. Well, here we are, a year and a half into his presidency, and
Vice President Dick Cheney advises one way to deal with Iraq and
Secretary of State Colin Powell advises another (Sept. 2).</TE>
<TE>   So who makes the tough decision? Obviously Bush, the most
ill-prepared, in terms of intellectual depth and government
experience, of any president of the 20th century. This former Texas
governor, oil executive and baseball club owner also wants to change
long-standing American policies regarding containment, use of nuclear
weapons and preemptive war. At least the Republican Party statesmen,
even including his own father, are sending slow-down signals. But
where are the Democratic statesmen? Most are missing in action on
these issues.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Martz</TE>
<TE>   Redlands</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a die-hard Democrat, I didn't vote for Bush, yet I support his
war plan to remove Saddam Hussein. While Hussein has not yet been
directly linked to the Sept. 11 catastrophe, he is, metaphorically
and clearly, another Sept. 11 waiting to happen. If we are determined
never to suffer a catastrophe in the form of biological, chemical or
radioactive terrorism, we must support Bush's decision to remove
Hussein from power.</TE>
<TE>   A war against Hussein will incur U.S. casualties and have
unnerving impacts on the U.S. and global economies as a result of the
disruption of the Saudi oil supply. But that's a small price to pay
for a just war on terrorism to prevent another catastrophe from
happening either on U.S. soil or anywhere else in the industrialized
world.</TE>
<TE>   One of the best ways to commemorate the anniversary of the Sept.
11 disaster is to show our courage by supporting Bush's latest phase
of the war on terrorism.</TE>

<LD>Re "Virtuoso on the Vibraphone, One of the Last Giants of Jazz,"
Sept. 1: It was during a trip from Hoboken, N.J., aboard the Rijndam
in December 1956 that I met Lionel Hampton. I was in the Palm Court
of the ocean liner when, after the dance, Mr. Hampton took a seat at
the bar next to me while his band was engaged in a jam session. I was
a young man then, finishing my studies in Europe, but he took time to
engage me in many conversations during the six-day journey.</LD>
<LD>   On the eve of the arrival in Rotterdam, he wrote me an inspiring
note, which I still hold dear, and signed it, "To Ben, from your
friend Lionel Hampton." Soon after, he left his bar stool and told
me: "Watch, Ben, I'm gonna do my trick," whereupon he jumped upon the
big drum and did his dance. Good vibes, wherever you are, my friend.
I will remember you fondly.</LD>

fan of promoter Dan Pallotta's ego or the way he distributes money to
charity, I do take issue with you on the "three dinners, four
lunches, four breakfasts, mobile hot showers on tractor trailers...."
I did one of those three-day walks and worked on the medical crew for
another. The dinners are not steak, shrimp and champagne but pasta,
green salad and fruit. Lunches and breakfasts are likewise healthy
and full of the carbs you need to keep going.</LD>
<LD>   A suggestion: You walk 20 miles for three consecutive days from
Santa Barbara to Malibu, eat the food you think should be provided,
go without a hot shower and forgo medical help for those blisters and
shin splints you might get--then report back on the experience.</LD>

<LD>Re "Simon and Davis Prove It's Time for a New Voice: None of the

Lopez writes about. I switched from registration as a Democrat last
year. I would like to see some Republican leaders talk Bill Simon
into stepping aside and having either Richard Riordan or Secretary of
State Bill Jones replace him as the Republican nominee. My preference
would be Jones, but I would be happy having either of them as a
choice against Gov. Gray "Fund-Raiser" Davis.</LD>

<LD>Matthew Bunn's timely call for the elimination of highly enriched
uranium from research reactors (Commentary, Aug. 29) also should draw
attention to another risk posed by these facilities: their
vulnerability to terrorist sabotage. The 352 research reactors around
the world do not have the security measures that protect nuclear
power plants. Although research reactor cores and spent fuel
inventories are relatively small, the location of many near
population centers makes them attractive targets that could pose
significant radiological hazards. Governments should take immediate
steps to remove spent fuel from reactors no longer in operation and
significantly enhance security at those facilities that are.</LD>

<HD>Top-Notch School Fails to Close 'Achievement Gap'</HD>
<DH>Learning: Berkeley High tried to lift urban black and
Latino pupils to the level of high-performing Asians and whites. But
a sizable divide persists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>Here in one of the best-educated corners of America, this city's sole
public high school suffers a split personality: One exhibits a steady
stream of National Merit Scholars, the other an undercurrent of
failure.</LD>
<LD>   Viki Rasmussen is a product of one Berkeley High School. The
confident 17-year-old took an array of college-level courses before
graduating in the spring and leaving last week to attend Brown
University. Viki is white.</LD>
<LD>   LaShawna Candies is a product of the other Berkeley High. The
15-year-old, timid and self-doubting, returned last week to start her
sophomore year. As a freshman she scored Fs in most subjects, and
reads at a second-grade level. She may never be able to decipher a
job application, let alone a college text. LaShawna is black.</LD>
<TE>   Attending one of America's most reputable urban high schools is
just about all Viki and LaShawna have in common. The two girls came
through the schoolhouse gate, just blocks from California's flagship
university, with vastly different backgrounds and skills. Rather than
equalize their opportunities, though, Berkeley High may have
succeeded only in maintaining--even widening--the academic chasm
between them.</TE>
<TE>   This despite the best of intentions.</TE>
<TE>   Berkeley was one of the first high schools in the country to
implement a plan to voluntarily desegregate, and its hallways teem
with the children of liberal intellectuals. Yet the school has
struggled, without much success, to close the so-called achievement
gap separating white and Asian students from less well-prepared
blacks and Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   "In desegregating schools in 1968, we thought all we had to do was
mix everybody up to assure equality," said school board President
Shirley Issel. "We were so naive. To achieve the dream of public
education as the great equalizer, we have to work a lot harder than
we thought."</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-four years later, Berkeley is a polarized campus where
high-achieving children from the suburbs meet youths raised on urban
streets. Officials say the four years they spend together is not
enough to close a gulf caused not just by educational disparities,
but also by economics and culture.</TE>
<TE>   Viki and LaShawna are at opposite ends of that gap.</TE>
<TE>   In her home at the foot of the affluent Berkeley Hills, the walls
of Viki's bedroom are a colorful landscape of maps with exotic
locales that she wants to visit. The walls of LaShawna's bedroom are
empty; though her mother lives in Oakland, LaShawna stays with her
mother's boyfriend in a blue-collar area known as "the flatlands" so
her residence will be within Berkeley boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Most days, Viki rode her mountain bike to school or drove her
mother's classic 1967 Cougar. Most days, LaShawna takes a city bus.</TE>
<TE>   Though Viki had access to private tutors, LaShawna appeals to her
13-year-old stepsister for help with homework.</TE>
<TE>   While Berkeley High has battled to narrow the gap between students
such as Viki and LaShawna, experts say the problem is so intractable
that even at this advantaged institution it has placed parents at
odds, frustrated administrators and weakened the school's academic
accreditation.</TE>
<TE>   The gulf has also caused tension among students--not only between
whites and blacks but among African Americans themselves, who
sometimes single out black high achievers as cultural sellouts.</TE>
<TE>   Still, teenagers throughout the region flock to gain admission. A
policy allowing transfers from nearby districts--including
predominantly black Richmond and Oakland--has helped establish
Berkeley among the nation's most diverse high schools.</TE>
<TE>   Many parents contend that the practice, while laudably
egalitarian, has overloaded the school with minority students who
can't compete because their previous schools were so weak. Berkeley's
black student population is nearly triple the city's 12% rate of
African American residents: The school is 32% black, 37% white, 11%
Latino, 9% Asian and 11% multiethnic.</TE>
<TE>   School officials say an additional unknown number of outside
students attend Berkeley illegally by supplying the district with
false addresses to claim city residence. The school has begun an
investigation to determine how many unsanctioned students are
enrolled.</TE>
<TE>   Many of Berkeley's problems are shared by high schools nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Calling the achievement gap America's "most important educational
challenge," a 1999 national study by the College Board, a student
testing group, found just 17% of black and 24% of Latino high school
seniors to be proficient in reading, and scoring even worse in math
and science. Black and Latino seniors nationwide, on average, read at
the same level as eighth-grade whites, other research shows.</TE>
<TE>   Though experts say the problem is more socioeconomic than racial,
they stress that educators can make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   "While race is relevant to the achievement gap, some schools in
high-minority areas have students scoring among the highest in their
state," said Jeanne Brennan, a spokeswoman for the Washington,
D.C.-based nonprofit Education Trust. "If you're black or Latino, you
don't have failure written into your DNA. Schools can help improve
performance."</TE>
<TE>   Berkeley has tried hard to strengthen students who enter
ill-equipped for its rigorous climate--experimenting with
after-school tutoring, buddy systems and stricter attendance
policies. In 1996, the school even entered into a partnership with
nearby UC Berkeley to analyze its culture of education.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers found a campus with polarized academic cultures; one
in which many black transfer students felt lost in a competitive
sink-or-swim atmosphere with few role models and little guidance; and
another with ambitious white students whose parents and teachers made
sure they got the advanced placement classes they needed to graduate
to the finest colleges.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting four-year Diversity Report, released in 2000,
concluded that Berkeley's 3,200 students suffered "apartheid-like
segregation." Though white Berkeley students scored in the top 15th
percentile nationally, blacks scored in the bottom 40th.</TE>
<TE>   Just 3% of black and Latino students are enrolled in advanced
placement classes, compared with 33% of whites. Black students also
experienced much higher dropout and discipline rates, the report
found.</TE>
<TE>   Some minority students eventually find their way and graduate with
good grades. In fact, black students at Berkeley High score higher on
standardized tests than their counterparts at other schools and
achieve better rates for entering the state university system.</TE>
<TE>   Using 1998-99 figures, officials say 55% of black seniors at
Berkeley High had grades enabling them to enter the UC system,
compared with 26.3% statewide. For Latinos, the Berkeley rate was
50%, compared with 22.1% statewide.</TE>
<TE>   But that success pales when black students are compared with
higher-achieving whites and Asians at Berkeley, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "Berkeley gets blamed for not solving a problem no other school
has been able to solve either," Issel said. "If there was a quick
fix, the problem would become like acne: Nobody would have it
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   A former Berkeley school board member, Pedro Noguera, was so
discouraged by the two-tiered educational system that he left to
teach at UC Berkeley. Now a professor at Harvard's School of
Education, he is a research consultant to 15 school districts
struggling to bridge similar achievement gaps.</TE>
<TE>   "How could a high school do so well by one group of students and
do so poorly for another?" Noguera asked. "At Berkeley, white
students get the majority of its energies. Everyone else must settle
for what's left over."</TE>
<TE>   While Noguera was on the school board in the early 1990s, he
acknowledged, little attention was given to Berkeley's minority
students. Instead, the school focused on a revolving door of
principals, each of whom brought a new agenda, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The problem reached its height after the 1994 PBS documentary
"School Colors," which focused on racial tensions that resulted from
Berkeley's student achievement gap, prompting officials to take the
issue more seriously. In 2000, the school was the subject of the book
"Class Dismissed" by Meredith Maran, which also highlighted the
achievement gap.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Berkeley's efforts, some minority parents say the school
fails to aggressively challenge students of color and hold them to
the same academic standards as others.</TE>
<TE>   The best teachers flock to accelerated courses, leaving less
experienced ones to cope with overcrowded mainstream classes
dominated by minority students. And academic competition among strong
students is so fierce that even progressive parents fear that any
attention paid to underachievers comes at the expense of their own
children.</TE>
<TE>   "The parents of wealthy white students don't want to focus on the
failings of poor blacks," Noguera said. "And they have a lot of
political power on the school board."</TE>
<TE>   Minority parents also have accused the school of ignoring
streetwise teaching alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Learning that half of Berkeley High's 300 African American
ninth-graders were failing English, math and history, a group called
Parents of Children of African Descent devised a way to reach
students of color over Christmas vacation in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Their program--nicknamed Rebound--took 50 freshmen who had failed
at least two eighth-grade subjects and placed them in an academic
boot camp. The classes featured small teacher-student ratios and
parent volunteers to help with discipline. Though minority parents
cited a higher student success rate, school administrators called
Rebound too narrowly focused.</TE>
<TE>   Citing its $175,000 cost, officials dropped the program after one
year, angering parents. "They whine about black parents not getting
involved with their kids, but when we develop a sensible plan, they
ignore us," said one group member, Irma Parker.</TE>
<TE>   Issel, the school board president, responded: "To think that
parents can dream up a working plan over Christmas is ridiculous. But
they're on the right track."</TE>
<TE>   Issel said that the achievement gap frustrates her liberal
community because, if any public high school commands the
intellectual resources to motivate low-achieving students, it should
be Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   This fall, a task force will study yet another approach, a "small
schools" alternative in which Berkeley students would be grouped into
smaller classes with the same team of instructors over four years,
seeking to establish a closer student-teacher bond.</TE>
<TE>   Though no new teachers would be hired under the plan, Supt.
Michele Lawrence said, instructors working in groups with the same
students would be better organized.</TE>
<TE>   But any real attempt to end the achievement gap should start long
before students reach high school and should extend as far back as
kindergarten, some officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's only when students hit high school that the rubber meets the
road," former Berkeley High Principal Frank Lynch said. "It's hard to
fix the damage in four years. And we can't just pass them along, like
they do in grade school."</TE>
<TE>   Because the school is so close to UC Berkeley, people expect
better results from his students "as though kids get smarter through
some kind of osmosis," Lynch said.</TE>
<TE>   "A high school principal has the toughest job in education.
Multiply that a million times and you've got the job at Berkeley,"
said Lynch, who left last year after 16 months to become
superintendent of the Del Norte County School District, in the
state's far northwest corner. "You're under a constant microscope."</TE>
<TE>   Berkeley High's achievement gap reached crisis proportions in 1996
when the Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges--an independent
academic board that rates 3,000 schools in California, Hawaii and the
Pacific Islands for their educational standards--refused to give the
school the normal six-year accreditation certificate. At one point,
the association threatened to withdraw accreditation altogether.</TE>
<TE>   But in May, a visiting review team noted the school's commitment
to reform and extended its certification another three years.</TE>
<TE>   It cited a program in which qualified parents tutor struggling
youths, a mentoring program for academically gifted minority
students, and a seminar to coach at-risk incoming freshmen in
negotiating Berkeley's course work.</TE>
<TE>   Though Berkeley officials have high hopes that the small schools
concept can rally student performance, they know there is no single
solution. They are conducting a nationwide search for a new principal
and new leadership.</TE>
<TE>   If Berkeley High could ever bridge its achievement gap, Lawrence
said, schools throughout the country would take notice. "Berkeley is
in such a fishbowl, any success we have solving this problem can
influence an entire nation," she said. "That alone allows us to hold
out hope."</TE>

<HD>Gay Rights Flap Engulfs Simon</HD>
<DH>Politics: Under pressure from conservatives, the GOP
candidate for governor denies signing supportive responses to
questionnaire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN and MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Under pressure from conservative supporters, Republican gubernatorial
candidate Bill Simon Jr. on Tuesday disavowed his campaign's response
to a gay rights questionnaire, saying someone signed his name on it
without his approval.</LD>
<LD>   The response to 24 questions from a gay rights group, the Log
Cabin Republicans of California, included pledges to sign a Gay Pride
Day proclamation and to support job benefits for partners of gay
state employees.</LD>
<LD>   After Simon's answers were publicized a week ago, he twice
discussed gay rights with the news media without disavowing his
response to the questionnaire.</LD>
<TE>   Simon acknowledged that his campaign sent the completed
questionnaire, dated Aug. 9, to the organization. But on Tuesday he
denied signing it and reaffirmed his opposition to several gay rights
measures.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone answered it for me," Simon told reporters during a
campaign stop at the Calvary Christian Center in Sacramento. "I did
not review or approve that questionnaire."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's remarks reassured some conservative supporters, but
angered gay Republican leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy illustrated a key challenge facing the candidate
who billed himself as a "conservative Republican" during the GOP
primary: In a state dominated by Democrats, Simon has attempted to
move toward the political center in recent months, but has struggled
to do so without alienating the conservative voters who helped him
beat former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan in the primary.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, his attempts to reach out to sympathetic Democratic and
independent voters have been contested by Democratic incumbent Gov.
Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The governor is airing extensive political advertising on
television, and on Tuesday criticized Simon's latest move as evidence
that he is inconsistent and unfamiliar with issues that matter to
Californians.</TE>
<TE>   As part of his efforts to court moderate voters, Simon has sought
the support of gay Republican groups. His campaign arranged for Simon
to be the guest of honor Thursday at a Hancock Park reception for a
gay rights group, the Republican Unity Coalition. Guests were to pay
$500 for photos with the candidate and Mary Cheney, the lesbian
daughter of Vice President Dick Cheney.</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of the outreach program that we have at our party,"
Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   But a few hours after Simon disavowed the Log Cabin questionnaire,
Mary Cheney and the coalition's other four board members revoked
Simon's invitation, said Brian O'Leary Bennett, the vice chairman.</TE>
<TE>   "It is hugely disappointing to us to see Bill Simon bow under the
pressure of a small fringe group who evidently yanked his chain hard
the first time he reached out to us and to all voters in the middle
where elections are won," the coalition said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Log Cabin President David Hanson said Simon was "letting the
right-wing people who control the Republican Party in California
dictate to him what he should be doing."</TE>
<TE>   The Simon supporters who are most outspoken against gay rights
said the candidate had satisfied their concerns by denying that he
signed the questionnaire.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside) said his office had received
more than 600 e-mails from constituents angry to read that Simon
would sign a proclamation for Gay Pride Day and support domestic
partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   "The concern was, based on these responses, that either he lied to
us or he changed his position on the so-called homosexual agenda,"
Haynes said. "Either way, particularly among the socially
conservative wing of the party, they would have taken it as a
betrayal."</TE>
<TE>   Haynes said he asked Simon to put down his explanation in a letter
he could distribute to angry conservatives. Simon did so Sunday
night, and the letter was posted on the Web site of the Traditional
Values Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   The Traditional Values chairman, the Rev. Louis Sheldon, said he
had been so upset by the questionnaire response that he spoke to
Simon about it at least 10 times over the last six days. On Tuesday,
Sheldon said he was no longer angry.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line to all of us was that Bill Simon had not changed
his positions," Sheldon said. "Bill doesn't support Gay Pride Day,
doesn't support preferred status for homosexuals."</TE>
<TE>   The questionnaire with Simon's signature at the bottom is dated
Aug. 9. Asked in a brief telephone interview whether someone had
forged his signature, Simon responded, "I didn't review it." He cut
off further questions by saying, "I've got to run into this meeting."</TE>
<TE>   Simon spokesman Mark Miner said a campaign employee used an
"auto-pen" to put Simon's signature on the response.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Simon responses were written in the first person.
"There are a number of gay and lesbian people in my business and
campaign," it says in response to a question on whether he would name
gay men and lesbians to judgeships and other state positions. "My
record of including all people is very clear, and it would certainly
continue in the governor's office."</TE>
<TE>   The candidate is co-chairman of the William E. Simon &amp; Sons
investment firm, which according to the questionnaire response does
not offer domestic partnership benefits "because there has not been a
request for such."</TE>
<TE>   The response says that Simon would not seek to repeal laws that
facilitate adoptions by same-sex couples.</TE>
<TE>   It also says, "I fully support hospital visitation and other
rights for domestic partners."</TE>
<TE>   But at the Sacramento church Tuesday, Simon gave a different
response when asked if he supports hospital visitation and
inheritance rights for gay couples.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's premised on sexual orientation, I do not," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also reaffirmed his opposition to gay marriage. In
explaining why he wrote the letter to Haynes, he said: "I wanted to
clarify my position, because our campaign does put together lots of
questionnaires, as every campaign does, and occasionally there are
statements that are made that don't reflect my precise views."</TE>
<TE>   Sal Russo, Simon's campaign consultant, said the candidate was not
backing away from the statements made to the Log Cabin Republicans,
except for the answer about Gay Pride Day proclamations.</TE>
<TE>   The questionnaire response said Simon would sign them, but in his
letter to Haynes, Simon said: "I do not support a proclamation for
Gay Pride Day."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the governor sought to score points among
supporters of gay rights. Davis, who has signed multiple Gay Pride
proclamations and a law that granted extensive legal rights to gay
couples, cast Simon's maneuvers on the subject as a flip-flop.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I'm not surprised," Davis told reporters after a Los
Angeles rally with labor union supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Simon doesn't seem to know where he is on most of the major
issues," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think consistency is important. Voters need to know where you
are."</TE>

<HD>Good Tidings at Port</HD>
<DH>After decades when nothing could survive in the fouled
waters, sea life is returning to L.A.'s harbor area thanks to
environmental laws.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The water at the Los Angeles-Long Beach port complex was once so foul
that yacht owners rid their hulls of barnacles simply by anchoring
there for a few days. Pollutants and the lack of oxygen killed them
off.</LD>
<LD>   But a soon-to-be-released biological survey of the nation's
busiest harbor has confirmed what fishermen have known for years:
Although it remains a distressed environment, the port is full of
life, and there are more kinds of it than have been seen in half a
century.</LD>
<LD>   Just beneath the trash bobbing on waves often coated with gleaming
oil swim mackerel, bass and a small but growing number of brilliant
orange garibaldi, the official state marine fish. Clinging to its
breakwater are lobsters and crabs, octopus and bat stars. Burrowing
in the mud are worms 14 inches long and fatter than hot dogs.</LD>
<TE>   A 15-acre strip of sand on the Port of Los Angeles' sprawling Pier
400 has become a nesting ground for 3,500 elegant terns and 600
endangered least terns. Cruising the kelp in a shallow water habitat
created beside a cargo ship lane are halibut up to 4 feet long.</TE>
<TE>   JoAnn Goeman, co-owner of Eddie's Marina, one of the oldest
marinas in the Port of Los Angeles, recalled how her 20-year-old
grandson walked into her office this summer lugging a "lobster so big
he had to hug it to lift it."</TE>
<TE>   "That lobster, which was carrying eggs, weighed about 20 pounds,"
she said. "He caught it with his bare hands on the Long Beach side of
the harbor." They didn't have the heart to cook it, and they let it
go.</TE>
<TE>   Another good sign: Boat owners from San Pedro's Ports O' Call
Village to Long Beach's Pier Point Landing complain that worms,
barnacles and algae encrust their tie lines, something boaters never
had to worry about a few decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists say nature is responding to incremental improvements in
water quality, the legacy of state and federal laws curbing
pollution, and the closure of marinas, Navy shipyards and canneries
that for decades spewed toxic chemicals, human waste and fish guts
into the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   True, the harbor will never resemble the placid tidal estuaries
and mudflats that existed before 1900. Sediments in some so-called
hot spots, such as the mouth of the Dominguez Channel, still contain
extremely high levels of carcinogenic DDT and PCBs, which accumulate
in the tissue of bottom-feeding fish.</TE>
<TE>   A witches' brew of debris, bacteria, pesticides and other toxic
substances flows into the harbor from inland cities whenever it
rains. Some boat owners illegally dump human waste, garbage, fuel and
oil.</TE>
<TE>   And above the waters, the air is getting dirtier. No other site in
the region produces more air pollution than the port, and on a
typical day cargo ships release more smog-forming gases than 1
million cars.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the wildlife taking up residence in the harbor's
docks, artificially created shallows and deep-dredged channels are
"part of a permanent trend," said Karen Green, who led the first
biological survey in two decades of the 15,000-acre harbor complex.</TE>
<TE>   By her count, there are about 44,591,000 fish in the harbor,
representing 67 species.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news," she said, "is that it proves environmental
activism works. What we are seeing is an example of what can happen
when activism, environmental laws and pollution-abatement controls
work together."</TE>
<TE>   Mitzy Taggart, a staff scientist for Heal the Bay and an expert on
ocean sediments and pollution, would not argue with that. However,
she cautioned that "while we've made progress, we have a long way to
go."</TE>
<TE>   "We absolutely should expect the harbor to meet the basic
requirements of the federal Clean Water Act, meaning that it should
be fishable and swimmable," Taggart said. "For right now, I would
advise against eating nonmigratory fish, such as white croaker,
because it is likely that some of them have levels of pollutants in
their tissue that exceed safe levels of consumption."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the idea that the harbor would ever again support a
thriving ecosystem seemed farfetched in the 1950s, when marine
biologist Don Reish conducted the first studies of its sediments and
water.</TE>
<TE>   By that time, the region was already so polluted that shipyard and
cannery workers frequently contracted eye infections, and some
channels and inlets had been declared biological dead zones with zero
dissolved oxygen.</TE>
<TE>   At the snug Fish Harbor, tons of tuna scales and bones heaved into
the water by a dozen seafood processors would not decompose because
there were no bacteria to feed on them.</TE>
<TE>   "People didn't care about such things back then," Reish said.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen McDonough, who has been collecting marine specimens for
science classes in the Los Angeles County Office of Education for
three decades, has chronicled the toll.</TE>
<TE>   "In the early 1970s," he said, "we were collecting lots of white
croaker with chemical burns on their bodies caused by nasty stuff
washing in from inland chrome plating companies.</TE>
<TE>   "After a while, the chemical burns disappeared and, to our
amazement, we started getting croakers with monstrous holes in their
sides and fins rotting off. Later, for a short period, we caught
croaker with two heads and tails between their eyes."</TE>
<TE>   These days, the croaker he catches appear normal but he warns they
are "loaded with PCBs and DDT."</TE>
<TE>   Those chemicals, used in transformers and as a pesticide, have
been outlawed and the impact of that ban--along with cleaner water
generally--is readily apparent to McDonough. To prove the point, he
skippered a fishing boat through Fish Harbor's narrow entrance on a
recent weekday and dropped a fine net into the water. A few minutes
later, he pulled it up and poured the contents into a small glass
jar.</TE>
<TE>   "When I did this 12 years go, we got zip," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Not anymore. The jar was filled with thousands of frenzied
greenish-red plankton, the critical first rung of the ocean food
chain.</TE>
<TE>   "Life!" McDonough said, holding the jar above his head
triumphantly.</TE>
<TE>   Later, after docking at San Pedro's 22nd Street landing, he
grabbed a pole and began nudging the rocks along the water's edge.</TE>
<TE>   "See that red bat star over there? Haven't seen them in years," he
said. "There's an octopus living inside that pipe. Those rocks are
covered with Kellet's whelk. The green balls you see on the ropes are
a form of algae that require clean water to survive."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Schaadt, exhibits director of the Cabrillo Marine
Aquarium, gets closer still to harbor wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   The lean and soft-spoken marine biologist has made a daily lunch
hour ritual of swimming out to garibaldi nests he has discovered in
submerged crevices on both sides of the breakwater.</TE>
<TE>   It took Schaadt about 15 minutes to reach a nesting site he has
been monitoring for five years. After stopping briefly to catch his
breath in a kelp bed in 12 feet of water, he plunged down to where a
pair of softball-sized garibaldi--a protected species--were guarding
orange eggs laid on a red patch of algae.</TE>
<TE>   Schaadt, who has a state permit to collect garibaldi eggs and
raise the fry, used a small comb to tease out about 700 eggs and
carefully deposited them in a small plastic bag.</TE>
<TE>   About 40 seconds later, he surfaced near a floating mound of empty
salsa containers and a dead sea gull.</TE>
<TE>   "If the harbor is becoming clean and hospitable for garibaldi," he
said, "that's a positive trend for everything else, from mussels to
seabirds."</TE>
<TE>   The harbor started getting cleaner almost immediately after
passage of the federal Clean Water Act and the California Coastal
Zone Conservation Act in 1972. About that time, the state Regional
Water Quality Control Board began tightening permits for the
discharge of water pollutants.</TE>
<TE>   A few years later, waste water from San Pedro seafood processors
was diverted to the Terminal Island sewage treatment plant.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1980s, water clarity had improved nearly 100% and
levels of dissolved oxygen had soared from almost zero in some places
to a nearly normal 6.8 milligrams per liter.</TE>
<TE>   "There are nowhere near the contaminants that used to end up in
the ports," said Dennis Dickerson, executive officer of the Regional
Water Quality Control Board in Los Angeles. "Life has followed the
cleaner water, attaching itself and holding on anywhere it can."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the "dead zones" found in some dead-end channels and
cannery areas have come back to life.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't just the return of oxygen that helped. Wildlife rushed
into artificial habitats created either by accident or design. In
downtown Long Beach, a former six-acre parking lot was ripped out and
transformed into an estuary now crawling with horned snails and
shorebirds.</TE>
<TE>   The sunbaked northwestern edge of Pier 400, the world's largest
container terminal, was left vacant for the terns who flock there by
the thousands.</TE>
<TE>   Against a backdrop of bridges and cranes rearing skyward, the
nesting area, which is off-limits to the public, is strewn with tiny
speckled tern eggs--their locations marked by 6-inch wooden stakes to
ensure that researchers do not step on them.</TE>
<TE>   On all sides, the air is filled with the raucous calls of adult
terns bringing fish to their demanding chicks. Occasionally, crushes
of fledglings stampede across the sandy plain, raising clouds of dust
like miniature buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   The resurgence of harbor life is not unique to Los Angeles and
Long Beach. Incremental recoveries have been occurring in industrial
ports from Humboldt Bay to San Diego, said Eric Larson, bays and
estuaries coordinator for the California Department of Fish and Game.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, "there's still a lot of work to do," Larson said.
"Increased species diversity and improved water quality are benefits,
but that doesn't mean all our questions are answered or our problems
solved."</TE>
<TE>   For example, cleaner water in West Coast ports has also enabled
invasive exotic species to gain footholds. A species of pale yellow
oyster proliferating across the Los Angeles port is strange and
beautiful, but it doesn't belong there.</TE>
<TE>   Green's biological survey suggests that up to 15% of the
invertebrate species in the harbor may be nonnative.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the No. 1 source of coastal water pollution: urban
runoff, which is almost always toxic to marine life and liable to
sicken swimmers.</TE>
<TE>   The Clean Water Act requires cities to take steps to clean up the
mess that washes down their storm drains.</TE>
<TE>   Many cities, however, say it would be too expensive to comply with
all provisions of the law.</TE>
<TE>   As the battle over that law intensifies, Chad Nelsen,
environmental director of the Surfrider Foundation, a grass-roots
conservation group, said, "It's important to recognize that activists
who've been fighting for clean water for 30 to 40 years have really
accomplished something in the ports.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an incentive for the rest of us to work equally hard," said
Nelsen, 32. "When I'm 65, it will be even better."</TE>
<TE>   But with the clean water comes persistent reminders of industry
and human carelessness. Heaps of trash piled up inside the Catalina
Expressway terminal in downtown Long Beach one recent afternoon, but
that didn't seem to bother a group of young men. They needed no
license to fish off a public pier, but they had to observe the bag
limits on harbors.</TE>
<TE>   In less than an hour, they filled their buckets with 27 fish,
quite a bounty but still within their limits. They had mostly white
croaker, along with shark, calico bass, striped sand bass and
mackerel.</TE>
<TE>   "The fishing's great," one of them said.</TE>

<HD>Clean Air Act Changes Would Worsen Pollution, Critics Say</HD>
<DH>Environment: A senator and a former EPA chief aim to block
the plan to amend a key provision. Administration officials defend
the proposal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Carol Browner
and Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) joined forces Tuesday to try to block
a Bush administration proposal to amend a key provision of the Clean
Air Act.</LD>
<LD>   Browner told a Senate subcommittee hearing that the agency she
headed for eight years under former President Clinton was on the
verge of making changes to the Clean Air Act that would make the air
"dirtier."</LD>
<LD>   The plan, she said, "abandons the promise of the Clean Air
Act--steady air-quality improvements."</LD>
<TE>   Edwards, chairman of the Senate health, education, labor and
pensions subcommittee on public health, contended that the changes
would be bad for public health. "My intention is to do everything in
my power to stop it," he said, adding that he would introduce
legislation toward that end.</TE>
<TE>   Browner and Edwards were targeting an administration plan to give
older coal-fired power plants more leeway to repair and expand their
facilities without triggering the Clean Air Act's "new source review"
provision, which would require them to install modern
pollution-control devices.</TE>
<TE>   The act, passed in 1970, exempted existing power plants from many
of its mandates. But under the new source review provision, it
requires plants, including older ones, to update pollution-control
devices if the plants are modified in any way that increases smog.</TE>
<TE>   EPA officials, who are awaiting final approval of their plan from
the White House, dispute the contention by Browner, environmental
groups and congressional Democrats that pollution levels will
increase.</TE>
<TE>   They contend that by giving power plant operators more
flexibility, the facilities will become more efficient and less
polluting.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the changes we are making will have a positive impact
on air quality," Jeffrey R. Holmstead, the EPA assistant
administrator for air pollution programs, told the subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   But Edwards and Browner challenged that assertion and criticized
administration officials for failing to produce "empirical" evidence
to back up their claims.</TE>
<TE>   Holmstead said the proof comes from a health assessment done in
1996, when the Clinton administration proposed amendments to the
program. That assessment determined that the proposed changes would
have no effect on the environment. He also said that the Bush
administration would release an updated health assessment when it
finalizes the rules.</TE>
<TE>   Browner called the 1996 assessment outdated, saying that it
predates important scientific advancements that have more
definitively tied air pollution to serious illness and premature
death.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists now estimate that as many as 30,000 Americans die
prematurely each year from fine particulate pollution, which causes
heart and lung disease. Power plants are the largest source of such
pollution. This pollution also causes hundreds of thousands of asthma
attacks a year, scientists say.</TE>
<TE>   Browner also took aim at the Bush administration for trying to
equate its plan with what she considered doing while she was head of
the EPA.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing could be further from the truth," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The most important distinction, Browner said, is that the Clinton
administration never adopted the changes because it could not find a
consensus among the power industry, environmentalists and health care
experts on what amendments were needed.</TE>
<TE>   Secondly, she said, the Bush administration chose industries'
favorite options and has altered several of them to grant industry
even greater leeway, opening up the possibility of large increases in
pollution.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, both administrations proposed giving power plants
exemptions from the new source review requirements for a period of
time if they install a particular type of anti-pollution equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton administration's version would have granted the
exemption for 10 years after the new equipment was installed.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal was to prompt the installation of best emissions
controls," Browner said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration would allow plants to use this exemption
to cover equipment installed up to 15 years ago, with no guarantee
that emissions would not increase.</TE>
<TE>   "The effect of the [Bush] administration's change will be dirtier
air than the current program allows," Browner said.</TE>
<TE>   Browner, who has not publicly criticized the administration's
policies until now, said she felt compelled to speak out because she
fears that the consequences of the changes to the Clean Air Act could
be "huge."</TE>
<TE>   Edwards said he was frustrated because administration officials
failed to respond to his two previous requests for an analysis of the
health effects of the changes, including one that came in a letter
signed by 44 senators.</TE>
<TE>   "It is outrageous that this administration treats the legitimate
concerns of nearly half the United States Senate--Republicans and
Democrats--with such open disrespect," Edwards said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is hard to escape the conclusion that the proposed rule
changes amount to a gift for oil companies and power companies, and a
kick in the gut for thousands of people with serious health
problems."</TE>

<HD>Nationwide Effort to Find Missing Children Proposed</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Senators' bill would charge Justice Department
with coordinating 'Amber alerts' and provide funds to expand the
program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Since they were first launched in Texas six years ago, "Amber alerts"
have been used in more than 15 states and 32 locations to try to
rescue missing children.</LD>
<LD>   Named for Amber Hagerman, a 9-year-old kidnapped and brutally
murdered in Arlington, Texas, in 1996, Amber--which also stands for
America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response--notifies the public
through electronic road signs and TV and radio broadcasts that a
child is missing.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, pointing to the program as a nationwide model, a
bipartisan group of senators, including Democrat Dianne Feinstein of
California and Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, introduced
legislation that calls for the Justice Department to coordinate such
alerts across the country. The measure also would provide an
estimated $25 million in matching funds for states and localities
that do not yet have the training--or the electronic signs--to make
the program work.</LD>
<TE>   Advocates say the program has saved lives. The National Center for
Missing &amp; Exploited Children estimates that 30 children have been
rescued because of Amber alerts. In recent months, during what some
have dubbed the summer of child abductions, one of the most
high-profile cases was that of Tamara Brooks, 16, and Jacqueline
Marris, 17, who were kidnapped at gunpoint from a "lovers' lane" area
in the Antelope Valley. The teens were then raped by Roy D. Ratliff,
37, an ex-convict who was killed during a shootout with sheriff's
deputies.</TE>
<TE>   The case--which led to television appearances and a People
magazine cover for the two girls--increased national awareness of
Amber alerts.</TE>
<TE>   But some worry that overuse could kill the system's effectiveness.
Like the pictures of missing children on milk cartons, they say, too
many alerts, issued indiscriminately, could dull public attention.</TE>
<TE>   "Over-activation will kill the plan," said Tarrant County, Texas,
Sheriff Dee Anderson, who serves on a board of law enforcement and
media officials that decides to activate alerts in the Dallas-Fort
Worth area. "It should only be used where the child's life is in
danger."</TE>
<TE>   Already, alerts have been withdrawn by authorities in some cases.
An alert was mistakenly issued after the disappearance of a
12-year-old girl in the Bay Area who turned out to be with relatives
in Massachusetts. And Nicholas Farber, 9, kidnapped from his father's
home, was found three days later at a San Diego-area campground,
where his mother, Debra Rose, involved in a bitter custody battle
over the boy, was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein noted that of the 13 alerts that have been issued by the
California Highway Patrol in the first month of the program in the
state, eight involved abductions by strangers, four by family
members, and one case was a false alarm.</TE>
<TE>   "But the bottom line is that in all 13 cases, Amber alerts have
resulted in the child being returned to his or her family," she said.
"This is powerful evidence. We know it works, and we know that it is
a program that should be nationwide."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson also praised the effectiveness of Amber alerts. "The
power of it is amazing when you see it work," he said. "It's
tremendous, the number of eyes and ears with cell phones."</TE>
<TE>   But he warned that taking the program nationwide could challenge
the delicate relationship between broadcasters--who air news of
kidnappings as a public service--and law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be pressure on law enforcement to activate the system
every time a child is missing, and it takes a thick-skinned
administrator to say no," the sheriff said. "Then the media criticize
us for not issuing an alert quick enough."</TE>
<TE>   As for taking the program national, he questioned the design and
intent. "What is national? If a child is missing in New York City,
are our radio stations in Texas going to interrupt broadcasting every
15 minutes?" he asked. "There's a million questions."</TE>
<TE>   To answer them, the senators are proposing a new Amber alert
coordinator in the Department of Justice to coordinate when and how
alerts go nationwide, or perhaps regionwide.</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of the concerns about overuse, Hutchison said: "We're not
going to try to interfere with any local alert system. We want it to
be simple, expedited. It's a very modest effort that could save
children's lives."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly 25 years after lead paint was banned in the United States,
eight companies go on trial in Providence in the first attempt by a
state to hold manufacturers accountable for lead poisoning in
children.</LD>
<LD>   Other states are watching the potentially multimillion-dollar case
closely and may bring lawsuits of their own if Rhode Island prevails.</LD>
<LD>   The state must first prove that lead paint makers created a public
health hazard. If it wins, the case will move to another phase that
will decide if the paint companies should pay millions in damages.</LD>
<TE>   Lead paint was banned nationally in 1978, after studies showed it
can cause neurological damage and even death in children.</TE>
<TE>   The paint companies deny they are directly responsible for the
chipping and flaking of lead paint. They argue that landlords should
be held responsible for allowing the properties to deteriorate.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>About 20 political activists and others were first in line at Denver
police headquarters to check whether their names were in the 3,200
so-called spy files that city officials concede went too far in
tracking dissidents.</LD>
<LD>   News that religious and peace groups were among those under
surveillance since about 1999 prompted cries of police misconduct, an
investigation by a three-judge panel and a decision to let some
people see their files before they are purged.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Wellington Webb, the subject of police surveillance when he
was a young activist, has condemned keeping files on peaceful
protesters.</LD>
<TE>   Records of those not suspected of crimes will be released to those
named in them, then purged after Nov. 1. The city attorney's office
will keep copies of all files, including those eliminated by police.</TE>
<TE>   Release of the files, though, did not quell the concerns of some
of the activists waiting in the police department lobby.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not being totally upfront, which makes you think they're
not telling you everything," said Wendy Hawthorne of the Denver
Justice and Peace Committee.</TE>

<HD>Bush to Honor Sept. 11 Victims on Anniversary</HD>
<DH>Tribute: He will devote himself to a 'solemn day of
remembrances,' a spokesman says, and will attend services at the
three crash sites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For nearly 14 hours next Wednesday, President Bush will immerse
himself in somber ceremonies marking the first anniversary of the
Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   He will begin the commemoration at a private church service in
Washington. He will end the day with a televised speech to the nation
from New York, the White House announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Bush would use the
speech to offer a tribute to those who lost their lives in the
terrorist strikes, capping what Fleischer said would be a "solemn day
of remembrances."</LD>
<TE>   But beyond the salute to the roughly 3,000 victims, the speech
will offer Bush an opportunity to reconnect his presidency with the
strong emotions of patriotism and nationalism that the attacks
aroused.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has been preparing for the first anniversary of
Sept. 11 for several months, arranging a presidential itinerary that
will take Bush to memorial services at the three places where
hijacked airliners crashed that day--the Pentagon, a field near
Shanksville, Pa., and the World Trade Center site in New York.</TE>
<TE>   As a political event, the route the president will follow should
underscore the distance the country has traveled, emotionally and
militarily, over the last year. The raw shock sparked by the attacks
gave way to a military operation that overthrew the Taliban regime
that harbored Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, a shadowy war
against terrorism and an unease at home about the country's
vulnerability to new attacks.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 12, Bush will turn his attention squarely to the future:
In a speech to the U.N. General Assembly, Bush is expected to set his
international agenda for the coming year.</TE>
<TE>   The forum will provide him with a key opportunity to make the case
among international leaders for quick action to remove Saddam Hussein
from power in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The address has taken on a particular aura of importance, because
at nearly every turn on the international stage, the Bush
administration has encountered doubts from some of its closest
allies--and in many cases outright opposition--as it seeks support
for what could turn into a war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the speech the night before from New York will be
targeted to the domestic audience, placing Bush in a role familiar to
the nation--that of a president seeking by example and carefully
crafted words to heal a wounded national spirit.</TE>
<TE>   His speech, to be delivered at 9:01 p.m. EDT, will be his most
extensive remarks that day.</TE>
<TE>   After the morning church service at a site yet to be announced,
Bush is to return to the White House, arriving in time for a moment
of silence with members of his staff assembled on the South Lawn. He
will then travel across the Potomac River to the Pentagon, for a
memorial observance there.</TE>
<TE>   Then, at midday, he will attend a wreath-laying ceremony at the
Pennsylvania crash site, and in the late afternoon he will do the
same at ground zero in Lower Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said the speech, to be delivered during prime time in
much of the country, will offer a reminder of "how our United States
stands strong throughout the world in promoting liberty."</TE>
<TE>   Montague Kern, an associate professor of political communication
at Rutgers University, said she expects it will serve Bush's
advantage to deliver "a symbolic speech rather than a policy speech,"
saluting heroism and American values of sacrifice.</TE>

<HD>Tentative Pact OKd in Church Sex Abuse Suit</HD>
<DH>Religion: Boston priest's alleged victims to get $10
million. In another case, accuser drops charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The Boston archdiocese and alleged victims of former priest John J.
Geoghan reached a tentative $10-million settlement late Tuesday, a
lawyer for the archdiocese said. The proposed agreement capped more
than a year of negotiation--and followed the collapse of an earlier
accord estimated at $20 million to $30 million.</LD>
<LD>   Reached late Tuesday, J. Owen Todd, an attorney for the Roman
Catholic Archdiocese of Boston, said of the new agreement that
''tentative is the operative word.'' He said he understood that all
86 of the alleged Geoghan victims covered by the proposed agreement
''are prepared to sign'' the new settlement.</LD>
<LD>   Mitchell Garabedian, the attorney representing the 86 plaintiffs,
could not be reached for comment.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed settlement came on the same day that a onetime altar
boy dropped a sexual abuse lawsuit against a high-ranking Catholic
Church official in Boston after doubts arose about the authenticity
of the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   The January trial of Geoghan set off a massive sexual abuse
scandal when documents were published in the Boston Globe showing
that the archdiocese long had known of sexual misconduct charges
against Geoghan.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than removing him from church work involving contact with
young parishioners, the documents showed, the archdiocese repeatedly
moved Geoghan from parish to parish--all the while giving him access
to children.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghan's alleged victims already were in settlement talks when
the former priest was found guilty in January of fondling a child in
the early 1990s. Geoghan is serving a nine-to 10-year sentence.</TE>
<TE>   More serious charges of child rape against Geoghan at first were
thrown out on grounds that the statute of limitations had expired.
But a Boston judge reinstated those charges late last week, and
Geoghan is scheduled to stand trial on child rape as early as next
month.</TE>
<TE>   Todd said the new settlement would draw only on archdiocese
insurance funds. He said the earlier, larger agreement would have
required liquidating property or otherwise drawing on church assets.</TE>
<TE>   After the lawsuit against Msgr. Michael Smith Foster was dropped,
Foster said, "I am grateful to God that the truth has been revealed."
Foster, chief canon lawyer for the archdiocese of Boston, added,
"These false accusations have done harm, not only to me, but also to
the true victims of abuse."</TE>
<TE>   In a suit filed last month, Paul Edwards, 35, accused Foster of
sexually abusing him at a Boston-area parish in the early 1980s.
Edwards also accused the late Father William Cummings of molesting
him during the same period.</TE>
<TE>   But supporters of the priests soon came forward to challenge the
claims of Edwards, who was a teenage altar boy when he said the abuse
took place. Edwards claimed, for example, that he was raped on an
overnight trip to New York City sponsored by the Catholic Youth
Organization. But adult chaperons recalled the outing as a day
excursion.</TE>
<TE>   Other inconsistencies also surfaced, and late last week, Edwards'
lawyer, Eric J. Parker, abruptly withdrew from the case, saying that
"issues arose central to the allegations" Edwards made. Neither
Edwards nor his current attorney, Ellen Martin, was available for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Foster, who immediately denied Edwards' charges, said Tuesday he
has not heard from the archdiocese since he was put on administrative
leave last month.</TE>
<TE>   He said the accusations had left him "bewildered, frustrated,
angry and disappointed," but that he maintained "an inner peace"
because he knew the charges were false. Under procedures set forth by
the archdiocese, Foster must ask to be reinstated.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards' lawsuit was dropped without prejudice, meaning it cannot
be refiled.</TE>

<HD>Security Agency Fight Heats Up</HD>
<DH>Congress: Bush lobbies Senate to approve his version of the
huge new Cabinet department. Democrats say White House is
overreaching.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush bore down on lawmakers Tuesday to approve his vision
of a new Cabinet superagency to spearhead the nation's defense
against terrorism, but a major dispute over executive power is
brewing in the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate, in its first vote on the matter, agreed unanimously
Tuesday to consider the legislation--the prelude to a floor debate
that could take up to three weeks.</LD>
<LD>   But the administration continued to attack provisions it objects
to in the Senate bill, sponsored by Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman
(D-Conn.). The dispute centers on how much freedom Bush and his new
homeland security secretary would have to run the department outside
of the usual government rules and regulations.</LD>
<TE>   The administration is pressing for what it calls ''freedom to
manage''--the ability to reshape pieces of the new department and to
create a new system for hiring, firing and paying its employees.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats say the White House is overreaching. They want to
preserve existing civil service protections for the federal
employees--many of them represented by unions--who would be joining
the new agency. The Democrats also want to preserve congressional
authority over government spending.</TE>
<TE>   Next week's anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks is raising
pressure on Congress to act on Bush's proposal for the Homeland
Security Department, much of which was included in a bill the House
passed in late July.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's Senate vote cleared away an important procedural
obstacle, increasing the likelihood that the Senate soon will pass
its own version of a bill to merge all or parts of more than 20
federal agencies into one new department with as many as 170,000
employees.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate legislation, like the House-passed counterpart, would
set in motion the most significant governmental reorganization of the
last half-century.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Scott McClellan denounced the Senate bill
Tuesday. ''It does not create the lean, effective and flexible agency
that we need to defend against a ruthless enemy who can carry out
their attacks at their choosing,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, whose aides for weeks have threatened a veto by him over the
employee-management issues, pressed his case Tuesday in a burst of
lobbying. Several Republican senators came to the White House for a
strategy session, and the president's homeland security advisor, Tom
Ridge, made the rounds at the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   But some Democrats, led by Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia,
promised to resist what they call an administration power grab.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd acknowledged ''a political windstorm'' to create the homeland
security agency is ''blowing down Pennsylvania Avenue and through the
halls of Congress.''</TE>
<TE>   But he urged the Senate to slow down the debate and preserve the
power of Congress to oversee the executive branch. ''Let's stop, look
and listen and be careful about what we're doing,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his adamant tone on the Senate floor, Byrd indicated he
would not necessarily use every parliamentary weapon to stop the
bill. While he may offer amendments, Byrd told reporters, he did not
plan to try to talk the bill to death through a filibuster. That,
too, was a strong signal that the bill will advance.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate debate on homeland security began as Congress ended its
monthlong summer recess, reconvening for several frantic final weeks
of legislating before, and maybe after, the Nov. 5 midterm elections.</TE>
<TE>   The House returns today for what will be an unusual workweek. On
Friday, both houses of Congress are scheduled to hold a ceremonial
meeting in New York City to commemorate the Sept. 11 attacks on the
World Trade Center. It will be the first time in more than two
centuries that Congress has met in New York.</TE>
<TE>   With the Sept. 11 anniversary much on the minds of lawmakers, many
of whom are up for reelection this fall, the homeland security debate
seems likely to yield a final bill by year's end to create what would
be the government's third-largest Cabinet department.</TE>
<TE>   But Congress will not meet the most optimistic timetables of some
lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Bush proposed the government reorganization in a speech
to the nation on June 6, House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt
(D-Mo.) urged that a bill be completed in time for a signing ceremony
on the anniversary of the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Now, though, the issues surrounding civil service rules and
management authority seem likely to prolong the debate and produce
contentious negotiations between the Republican-led House and the
Democrat-controlled Senate.</TE>
<TE>   ''We're not going to roll over when it comes to principles and
beliefs that we hold to be very, very important,'' said Senate
Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.). He called the Bush plan ''a
power grab of unprecedented magnitude.''</TE>
<TE>   Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), appearing with Ridge
in the Capitol, fired back: ''I think it's important that we focus on
homeland security and not bureaucrat security.''</TE>
<TE>   Amid the partisan sniping, senators from both parties made clear
they have reached consensus on a number of points. Most important,
they agree that a new department should be created, bringing under
one roof such disparate agencies as the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, the Coast Guard, the Transportation Security
Administration and the Customs Service.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman, chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,
tried to downplay the conflict over labor-management issues,
maintaining that his bill would give Bush 90% of what he sought. He
said his bill would help diminish the vulnerabilities in domestic
security that the Sept. 11 hijackers so ruthlessly exposed.</TE>
<TE>   ''We are still at risk,'' Lieberman said, ''and that is why we
must urgently proceed.''</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, the committee's top Republican,
said: ''In the end, we both agree that the creation of a new
Department of Homeland Security is needed to make this country
safer.... Even advocates of smaller government realize that is a
mission that is vital to the security of this nation.''</TE>

<HD>Cuomo Ends Bid for N.Y. Governor</HD>
<DH>Politics: Polls show the ex-Housing secretary was badly
trailing H. Carl McCall in next week's Democratic primary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Former Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, seeking the New York
governor's office once held by his father, suddenly withdrew from the
race Tuesday, just a week before the Democratic primary, and pledged
his support to state Comptroller H. Carl McCall.</LD>
<LD>   Running behind and remaining stagnant in the polls, Cuomo
portrayed his actions as a step toward party unity.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes when you try to communicate too many ideas, sometimes
you end up communicating nothing, and in part the campaign did that,"
Cuomo said at a news conference with former President Clinton and
other politicians at his side.</LD>
<TE>   "I fell behind in the polls in July and August ... and I accept
full responsibility for the way the campaign was run," added Cuomo,
the eldest son of former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.</TE>
<TE>   He said he rejected the recommendation of advisors, who urged a
last-minute, $2-million blitz of commercials attacking McCall.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not close the gap in an election by opening one in the
body politic," Cuomo said. "While it's harder for me to step back
than step forward, today I step back."</TE>
<TE>   Once the Democratic front-runner, Cuomo slipped badly after he
charged that Gov. George Pataki had ceded leadership after the
terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center to then-New York Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani. Cuomo said Pataki had merely "held the leader's
coat."</TE>
<TE>   Cuomo was broadly criticized for his remark--even his father said
it was a political error.</TE>
<TE>   McCall welcomed Cuomo's support and joked, "All this was supposed
to happen next Tuesday. That's one thing about politics. It's always
unpredictable."</TE>
<TE>   Even by the often bizarre standards of politics in the Empire
State, Cuomo's action was unusual. "Nothing comes to mind
historically," said Steven Cohen, a professor of public policy at
Columbia University. "People have pulled out of a race before, but
nothing like this."</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats recalled then-Gov. Cuomo's last-minute decision in
1992 not to seek the White House even as planes waited at the airport
to take him to New Hampshire to enter the presidential primary.</TE>
<TE>   "It's genetic," said a veteran Democratic operative who asked not
to be identified. "His father established the historical precedent."</TE>
<TE>   Polls had shown Cuomo more than 20 points behind McCall, who has
run a steady campaign stressing themes of a first-class education for
all children, affordable health care and housing and greater job
opportunities in the state.</TE>
<TE>   McCall, 66, who with Cuomo's withdrawal will become the state's
first African American nominee for governor from a major party,
repeatedly accused Pataki of inattention to the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Cuomo, 44, proved to be a strong fund-raiser. But politicians and
consultants said his blunder in attacking Pataki after Sept. 11
represented a combative campaign style ill-suited to the politics of
healing after the twin towers tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   "The decline began when he criticized Pataki's role in the 9/11
recovery," said Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research
Center at New York University. "He didn't understand that the whole
debate about 9/11 was not part of the political agenda."</TE>
<TE>   While Cuomo was in Washington serving as secretary of Housing and
Urban Development in the Clinton administration, McCall developed and
nurtured relationships among Democrats in the state.</TE>
<TE>   "In a Democratic primary in New York, relationships mean a lot,"
said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant who has
advised McCall. Cuomo "didn't understand he had to develop those
relationships and keep them going."</TE>
<TE>   Clinton and his wife, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, proclaimed
neutrality in the race.</TE>
<TE>   But as McCall's lead in the polls soared and held steady, signs
appeared that they were leaning toward the comptroller, who stressed
to voters his rise from poverty, his prior experience as a deputy
ambassador to the United Nations and as a vice president of Citibank.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, McCall and Sen. Clinton marched together in Brooklyn's
West Indian American Day parade. Cuomo arrived later at the event.</TE>
<TE>   "Andrew Cuomo is someone who cares deeply about the people of New
York," she said. "This was a difficult decision, and I applaud his
courage in making it."</TE>
<TE>   "I know in many ways this is a sad day," said former President
Clinton, who shared the platform with Cuomo at the news conference.
"I suffered two searing defeats in my life, but I can tell you that
today is the day you should be very proud of Andrew. I am the only
person standing on this stage whose political career is over."</TE>
<TE>   A source close to Clinton said the former president spoke with
Cuomo and Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.) on Monday. The veteran
congressman, who is close to McCall, also attended the news
conference.</TE>
<TE>   "He was someone who was involved in this as it went along," the
source said of Clinton, but declined to say whether the former
president encouraged his onetime Cabinet official to drop out.</TE>
<TE>   Polls show McCall facing an uphill fight against Pataki, who
defeated Cuomo's father eight years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Even with Cuomo's withdrawal, the New York governor's race has
been one of the most frustrating in the nation for Democrats. Though
New York state is heavily Democratic--it favored both Al Gore and
Bill Clinton by nearly 2-million-vote margins in the past two
presidential elections, and Democrats hold both Senate seats--the
party was unable to mount a serious challenge to Pataki in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   And even with a clear path to the nomination now, it is unclear
that McCall can press the incumbent this time either. Pataki, with
his support of gun control and legalized abortion and many
environmental causes, doesn't present Democrats with the usual
targets they have effectively used in recent elections to defeat
Republican gubernatorial candidates in other key coastal states, such
as California and New Jersey. Pataki has been further solidified by a
positive public reaction to his performance in the days after the
Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Cuomo's future is uncertain. Though he's still young, this
campaign leaves some professionals wondering if his intense and often
prickly personality is too polarizing for voters.</TE>

<HD>Scientist in Anthrax Probe Fired</HD>
<DH>Security: Steven Hatfill, who was hired in July, loses LSU
research job. School says it isn't passing judgment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Steven J. Hatfill, who says the federal government has ruined his
life by linking him to the anthrax investigation, was fired Tuesday
from his job as a researcher at Louisiana State University.</LD>
<LD>   Hatfill was hired by LSU's National Center for Biomedical Research
and Training in July and put on administrative leave with pay on Aug.
2.</LD>
<LD>   "The university is making no judgment as to Dr. Hatfill's guilt or
innocence regarding the FBI investigation," said Chancellor Mark A.
Emmert in a brief statement released by the university on Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   "Our ultimate concerns are the ability of the university to
fulfill its role and mission as a land-grant university," he said.
"In considering all of these objectives, I have concluded that it is
clearly in the best interest of LSU to terminate this relationship."</TE>
<TE>   Pat Clawson, a spokesman for Hatfill, said the university called
Hatfill's attorneys Tuesday afternoon and told him of their decision
to fire him.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Hatfill blamed the FBI's investigation for his
firing.</TE>
<TE>   "My life has been completely and utterly destroyed by [Atty. Gen.]
John Ashcroft and the FBI," Hatfill said. "I do not understand why
they are doing this to me. My professional reputation is in tatters.
All I have left are my savings and they will be exhausted soon
because of my legal bills."</TE>
<TE>   Five people were killed by anthrax-laced letters sent through the
mail last fall.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has identified Hatfill as a "person of interest" in its
investigation but no more or less important than about 30 fellow
scientists and researchers with the expertise and opportunity to
conduct the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But Hatfill has been treated differently. FBI and Postal Service
agents wearing protective gloves searched his apartment in Frederick,
Md., twice, once with a search warrant. His photo was the only one
circulated last month in the Princeton, N.J., area where
investigators believe the anthrax letters may have been mailed.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill, 48, worked until 1999 for Ft. Detrick's Army Medical
Research Institute of Infectious Diseases in Maryland, which is the
primary custodian of the virulent Ames strain of anthrax found in
last fall's deadly letters.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill and another scientist, Joseph Soukup, commissioned a study
of a hypothetical anthrax attack in February 1999 as employees of
defense contractor Science Applications International Corp., said Ben
Haddad, spokesman for the San Diego-based firm.</TE>

<HD>Suit Over Hawaiians' Aid Can Proceed, Judge Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lawsuit challenging special benefits for native Hawaiians can move
forward against the state, but without the U.S. government as a
defendant, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by U.S. District Judge Susan Oki Mollway reaffirms
her earlier ruling that the 16 multiethnic plaintiffs challenging the
Hawaiian Home Lands program and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs have
standing as state taxpayers because both programs receive state
money.</LD>
<LD>   Within the last year, two other challenges to the Office of
Hawaiian Affairs were thrown out after the court determined the
plaintiffs lacked standing.</LD>
<TE>   Tuesday's ruling removes the United States as a defendant because
the plaintiffs, based on their standing as state taxpayers, would be
unable to seek relief from the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   "It helps bring focus to the case," said Jon Van Dyke, an attorney
with the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and a professor at the University
of Hawaii's William S. Richardson School of Law. "The plaintiffs
wanted to bring forward a much more broad, sweeping case, but the
court said they haven't been injured in a manner that would permit a
broader claim."</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs sued the state on March 4, charging that the Hawaiian
Home Lands program and Office of Hawaiian Affairs represent
unconstitutional race discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit is based on the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Rice vs.
Cayetano decision, which struck down the Hawaiians-only requirement
to vote in an Office of Hawaiian Affairs election as racial
discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   The new lawsuit seeks an order shutting down the Office of
Hawaiian Affairs and the homestead programs that serve more than
200,000 native Hawaiians and part-Hawaiians.</TE>
<TE>   Mollway said any ruling in the plaintiffs' favor would only affect
state tax dollars that go toward Hawaiian programs.</TE>

<HD>Business Rumblings in Time of War</HD>
<DH>Policy: Bush team tries to balance the needs of its
corporate allies and the needs of the nation in the fight on
terrorism. They can come in conflict.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Like good friends embarrassed by a rare disagreement, the Bush
administration and the business community cannot say enough about how
much the other has done to promote homeland security and what a good
working relationship they share. Behind the positive spin, however,
the White House is scrambling to address the concerns of its
corporate political allies without compromising anti-terrorism
measures that it has portrayed as essential to preventing another
catastrophic attack.</LD>
<LD>   While careful to wrap its resistance in patriotism, corporate
America insists that the front line must not interfere with its
bottom line.</LD>
<LD>   Intensive screening of vehicles and drivers at border checkpoints,
designating hospitals to treat bioterrorism epidemics and searching
containers at ports of entry are all well and good, business
representatives say, but let's not get carried away.</LD>
<TE>   Randy Johnson, vice president for labor and immigration policy at
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, described security-related shipping
delays as barely tolerable.</TE>
<TE>   "Any more is going to kill us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gaining momentum as the Sept. 11 anniversary approaches, the
surprising resistance from some in the business community threatens
to interfere with the administration's message of an America more
secure and more efficient than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "This can be a win-win situation, good for the country and helpful
for business," said Gordon Johndroe, spokesman for the Office of
Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the effect on business of post-Sept. 11 policies that
require intensive searches of shipping containers and 18-wheelers at
ports and border crossings, Johndroe said early problems have been
corrected.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to strike a balance between the security we need and the
free flow of legitimate goods and people," he said. "We will be
moving cargo faster than on Sept. 11 and we'll know more about it."</TE>
<TE>   On the ground, however, business owners and port operators see
time-consuming security measures that delay the delivery of parts to
automobile and other assembly plants, slowing operations and
lengthening the time it takes for products to get to market.</TE>
<TE>   Operators of some U.S. ports worry that frustrated shippers will
take their business to Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "If they think they can get through more quickly, they might go to
Vancouver," said Michael Wasem, communications director for the Port
of Tacoma, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   Business groups also are worried about upfront costs.</TE>
<TE>   Conducting vulnerability assessments, erecting fences, cameras and
other physical barriers, training for worst-case scenarios, hiring
additional guards, buying doubles of essential equipment, and running
background checks on employees are just some of the things the
government says businesses must do to help prevent and respond to
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Some things can be pretty costly," said Stephen Jordan, executive
director of the chamber's Center for Corporate Citizenship. New
security procedures must not interfere with companies' needs to
"still pay the bills and make a little money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone agrees that public-private cooperation is vital for the
protection of the country's critical infrastructure--water and power
utilities, transportation, banking and telecommunication--because
roughly 85% of these essential services are privately owned.</TE>
<TE>   Who pays for what is another question.</TE>
<TE>   Government agencies have worked closely with some industries,
especially to beef up computer system security. And in some key
areas, such as water utilities, Congress and the Bush administration
have agreed to subsidize private security enhancements.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals, which would be among the first responders to a
bioterrorism attack, have received $125 million in preparedness
grants. But they are unhappy with the level of funding and the
strings attached to it.</TE>
<TE>   "The funding so far is just a modest first investment," said
Roslyne Schulman, senior associate director for policy development at
the American Hospital Assn. "We're pushing for sustained federal
funding."</TE>
<TE>   To qualify for the grants, hospitals were required to submit plans
spelling out what they would do to prepare to receive and treat a
surge of as many as 500 critically ill and infectious people in a
short period.</TE>
<TE>   Some have been less willing to be designated as their community's
primary facility for smallpox patients or other victims of a
bioterrorist-spawned epidemic.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Richard Levinson, associate executive director of the American
Public Health Assn., acknowledged the "apprehension" of some hospital
administrators that their facility "would end up being a giant
isolation ward."</TE>
<TE>   But a smallpox or other bioterrorism attack could infect millions
of people, he said, so the need is very real for hospitals where the
staff is trained and prepared to treat them.</TE>
<TE>   "None of them relish the role, but it's a role that has to be
played," he said. "Hospitals are going to have to step up to the
plate."</TE>
<TE>   For other industries, homeland security means dealing with the
possibility that their facilities could become targets of a terrorist
attack.</TE>
<TE>   As long ago as December 1999, a government-commissioned report
concluded that an attack on a U.S. chemical plant could be far more
deadly than attempts to use chemical or biological weapons. The
Environmental Protection Agency has identified 125 facilities where
an attack would endanger at least 1 million people.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the chemical, nuclear and petroleum industries strongly oppose
pending legislation that would impose industrywide security standards
on all 15,000 of the nation's chemical and petrochemical sites and
would fine companies that failed to comply.</TE>
<TE>   The American Petroleum Institute has been working with the
Department of Energy to increase security at the facilities most
critical to the nation's energy supply, as well as at plants near
large cities, said Kendra Martin, chief information officer.</TE>
<TE>   And the American Chemistry Council has adopted a security plan for
its members, the 180 chemical companies that manufacture almost 95%
of the nation's industrial chemical products at 1,000 sites around
the country.</TE>
<TE>   The industries argue that the legislation's timetable would
discourage companies from moving ahead with security improvements
that they are making voluntarily.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to do the right thing once and do it quickly," said Chris
VandenHeuvel, spokesman for the chemistry council.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that 93% of chemical plants are not part of the council's
voluntary program, supporters of the bill, sponsored by Sen. Jon
Corzine (D-N.J.) and Harry Reid (D-Nev.), say it is the only way to
ensure that security is upgraded at all the sites.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, the highly partisan Senate Environmental and Public
Works Committee passed the bill, 19 to 0. But its prospects in the
House, or as part of legislation that would create a homeland
security department, remain uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   On other homeland security matters, business groups have been more
successful. They appear to have won some exemptions from freedom of
information laws and appear to have secured government support for
terrorism insurance.</TE>
<TE>   And while chamber officials brag about the "new special assistant
we've created" in the proposed department of homeland security--the
product of an eleventh-hour amendment added to the House homeland
security bill--the position appears analogous to the private-sector
liaison jobs now standard in virtually every government agency.</TE>
<TE>   For some businesses, of course, homeland security has been a boon.</TE>
<TE>   Most security consultants, for example, have more work than they
can handle.</TE>
<TE>   Firms that provide security guards, manufacturers of key
antibiotics and vaccines, makers of communication systems that link
government agencies, and developers of face-recognition software,
thermal-imaging equipment and other surveillance technologies also
have prospered.</TE>

<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>A state senator who favors raising casino taxes to close Nevada's
$180-million budget deficit was leading in the Democratic primary
Tuesday for the chance to take on popular Republican Gov. Kenny Guinn
in November.</LD>
<LD>   Guinn was headed toward an easy GOP primary victory with 83% of
the vote after 19% of precincts had reported statewide. State Sen.
Joe Neal had 37%, with 24% of Democrats choosing "none of the above."</LD>
<LD>   Neal had been favored over a former stripper and two other
Democrats, while Guinn faced six little-known opponents in the GOP
primary.</LD>
<TE>   Neal would be the state's first black candidate for governor to
advance to the general election.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of focus will be on me for that," Neal said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm willing to take that responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   The race to represent the new 3rd Congressional District in
southern Nevada also has drawn attention because it could have
national implications in the battle between Democrats and Republicans
for control of the House.</TE>
<TE>   Democrat Dario Herrera, a Clark County commissioner, has national
party support against former Republican state Sen. Jon Porter. Both
were receiving 69% of the vote in their respective primaries against
little-known opponents.</TE>
<TE>   As polls closed, the Nevada secretary of state's office said
turnout was light, with just 9% of the state's 829,622 registered
voters casting early or absentee ballots. Two years ago, 23% voted
early or by mail.</TE>
<TE>   Polls have Guinn with a commanding 3-to-1 lead over Neal, who has
been mounting a populist campaign based on his longtime criticism of
the state's powerful hotel-casino industry, which has $18 billion in
annual profits.</TE>
<TE>   He has called for the first tax hike on casino profits in 15 years
to help soften the burden on others.</TE>
<TE>   "The key issue is the people who live here are bearing the burden
of the tourism that we bring in here," Neal said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We should do something to collect more taxes from the hotels."</TE>
<TE>   Neal, 67, teaches constitutional democracy at Community College of
Southern Nevada and has represented North Las Vegas since 1972.</TE>
<TE>   Guinn, 66, announced earlier this year that he has prostate
cancer, but his doctors said it was detected early and would not
affect his campaign or his work.</TE>

<KH>A YEAR AFTER</KH>
<HD>A Toxic Legacy Lingers as Cleanup Efforts Fall Short</HD>
<DH>Health: High levels of pollutants remain in buildings near
the trade center site.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Almost a year after the World Trade Center's collapse shrouded New
York in inches of ash and debris, residents are still finding dust
containing surprisingly high levels of asbestos, lead and mercury in
their homes, offices and schools.</LD>
<LD>   A toxic cocktail containing many times the legal maximum levels of
cancer-causing agents lingers everywhere. It is embedded in school
carpets, settled in office air vents and stuck in the crevices of
firetrucks--even after extensive cleanups.</LD>
<LD>   Under pressure from activists, local politicians and even its own
scientists, the Environmental Protection Agency has agreed to clean
every residence in Lower Manhattan, although top officials continue
to insist that health risks are small.</LD>
<TE>   The unprecedented cleanup is a grand gesture that still falls
short, say such critics as Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), who accuses
the EPA of downplaying the risk in the early days after the attacks
to avoid a costly and politically unwelcome abatement. The planned
cleanup won't include small businesses, firehouses or the residences
of hundreds of thousands of people in Brooklyn who were directly in
the path of the toxic plume. It covers only the random apartment
dwellers who specifically request it, leaving them open to
recontamination by units that have not been cleaned or common areas
that share a ventilation system.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a major health catastrophe," Nadler said. "We're allowing it
to happen, and it's immoral because people are going to die from
this."</TE>
<TE>   Beginning this month, each of the 30,000 residences below Canal
Street is eligible to have a team wipe down every surface in the
home, wet-vacuum the rugs and upholstery and check the vent outlets
for asbestos. So far, 3,205 people have applied for a full cleanup
and 905 for testing only. The abatement could cost up to $7,000 per
apartment, according to the EPA.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that the dust from the World Trade Center can contain
asbestos and silica and fibrous materials," said EPA spokeswoman Mary
Mears.</TE>
<TE>   "Science says that you need fairly high levels and long-term
exposure, but we still think there's a potential risk there. But we
feel that what we're going to find here is very low levels, and that
there would be a very low risk, even if we did nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Nina Lavin, a jeweler, is one of those convinced she's living in a
poisoned building and is angry that the EPA didn't do more to warn
people of the hazards. Her apartment, seven blocks north of the World
Trade Center site, faced the towers, and her belongings were coated
with dust after the buildings fell.</TE>
<TE>   Reassured by EPA chief Christie Whitman's claims two days after
the disaster that "there appears to be no significant levels of
asbestos in the air in New York City," Lavin followed the New York
Department of Health's recommendations to clean up with a mere wet
mop and rags. Trusting the agency, she said, turned out to be a
mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Relocation Plea Rejected</TE>
<TE>   Months later, Lavin couldn't stop coughing and developed chronic
bronchitis, she said. The building manager refused to pay for a
professional cleanup. The Federal Emergency Management Agency turned
down her request to be relocated, insisting that her building was
"structurally sound." Certain that there was still something wrong,
she paid to have her apartment tested, and she found that it
contained 12 times the maximum legal level of asbestos.</TE>
<TE>   Lavin is now living in a hotel until her apartment is thoroughly
cleaned. But even then, she risks recontamination from other tenants
who share the air system in the 460-unit building but who haven't
signed up for the scrub-down.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really distressing to learn that I've been living with these
contamination levels for all these months," Lavin said. "I have no
idea what the long-term prognosis is for me or for all of us."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists aren't sure either. Experts differ on what the
long-term health effects might be, because no one has ever studied
such a broad combination of contaminants dispersed on such a wide
scale before.</TE>
<TE>   The immediate effects are clear. The characteristic "World Trade
Center cough"--which Dr. Philip Landrigan, chairman of the Department
of Community and Preventive Medicine at New York's Mount Sinai School
of Medicine, has documented in hundreds of rescue and construction
workers--is caused by corrosive concrete dust, ground glass and other
lung irritants.</TE>
<TE>   But Landrigan is also worried about effects that will only show up
years later. Asbestos has microscopic, needle-like fibers that can
lodge in the lungs and cause scarring and eventually tumors. It is
hazardous only when inhaled, Landrigan said, but lingering dust can
be circulated by a contaminated air system, stirred up by moving
furniture, or raised by children running through the house.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to be cautiously reassuring," Landrigan said. "It's fair
to say that if someone has been exposed to asbestos indoors for a
year, that they have an increased risk of developing cancer."</TE>
<TE>   The dust has proved much harder to detect and eliminate than
experts had expected. The force of the towers' collapse pulverized
the buildings and their contents into particles so fine, they were
missed by standard testing techniques. In addition to the asbestos
and caustic concrete dust, the cloud contained benzene from jet fuel,
lead from thousands of computers, mercury from millions of
fluorescent lights, and radioactive compounds from smoke detectors.
The haze blanketed the area for blocks, and residue is still being
discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Just in the last few weeks, dangerous levels of asbestos-laden
dust have been found in building air shafts, school carpeting and in
a dozen firetrucks.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the EPA's claim that the level of asbestos poses no
significant risk and that its cleanup is designed mostly to allay
residents' concerns, critics from within the agency say that the EPA
deliberately chose to use crude detection methods in a limited
area--decisions that significantly blunted the agency's findings.</TE>
<TE>   "All the experienced people in the agency knew immediately it was
a disaster and would need massive remediation," said Hugh Kaufman,
the former chief investigator for the EPA ombudsman's office and now
a policy analyst at the agency. "But decisions on how to approach it
were made from the White House down, rather than from the scientists
on the ground up. The message was to get downtown up and running as
soon as possible and worry about the rest later."</TE>
<TE>   Cate Jenkins, a senior environmental scientist at the EPA, said
the agency refused offers from other EPA branches to provide more
sensitive testing equipment the week after the towers' fall.</TE>
<TE>   "They were using the equivalent of a magnifying glass when they
should have been using an electron microscope," she said. "And now
that they have the chance to redeem themselves, the new cleanup plan
is using methods that our own studies show fall short. It's grossly
inadequate."</TE>
<TE>   Mears, the EPA spokeswoman, conceded that the HEPA vacuuming and
wet extraction the agency is offering will remove only 60% to 70% of
asbestos fibers. And although there may be a risk of recontamination
through the air vents, they can't compel residents to open their
doors to the EPA cleaners, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "In order for us to demand access to people's homes, it would have
to be a public health emergency," Mears said. "We don't think that is
the situation we have here at all."</TE>
<TE>   At Stuyvesant High School, four blocks from ground zero, parents
do consider the situation an emergency. Because the school was a
staging ground for rescue workers, parents and teachers have been
especially concerned about contamination.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Education assured them that the school was safe
before students returned in October. But after about 10% of the
students and employees reported new-onset asthma, persistent coughing
and wheezing in a survey conducted by the parents' association, they
insisted on more testing.</TE>
<TE>   In April, consultants found that the air quality was unacceptable
by EPA standards, discovered elevated lead levels and noted that the
air ducts had not been cleaned.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of Watergate lawyer Richard Ben-Veniste, a
Stuyvesant alumnus, the parents' association forced the board to
agree to clean the ventilation system and retest before students
returned to school in September. The Department of Education said it
has spent $1.7 million since Sept. 11 on decontaminating the school.</TE>
<TE>   In August, additional checks found asbestos levels 250 times the
legal limit in the auditorium carpet. One day late last month,
workers were swabbing the ventilation system--without protective
gear--and releasing more asbestos-laden dust into the air, said Jenna
Orkin, a parent who had stopped by the school during the cleanup.
Now, teachers and students are debating whether to return to the
school.</TE>
<TE>   "The Board of Education has an obligation to provide safe schools,
and when they told us it was OK to come back, I believed them," said
Paul Edwards, whose son Brian is a Stuyvesant student. "At this
point, I feel totally betrayed."</TE>
<TE>   Although homes are covered by the government plan, businesses are
not. Many larger companies can afford to have high-level
decontaminations performed, but many small businesses already
struggling since Sept . 11 may simply forgo testing and hope for the
best.</TE>
<TE>   Asbestos Dust Remains</TE>
<TE>   Even after extensive cleanup, asbestos dust can still be found.
Before the Wall Street Journal moved back into its offices last month
at the World Financial Center, across the street from the World Trade
Center site, the company wanted to be sure its workspace was safe.
Its dust-shrouded offices were often pictured to illustrate the depth
of the fallout, its computers and chairs blanketed with ash like a
modern-day Pompeii.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 70% of respondents to an employee-driven survey cited
health concerns about returning.</TE>
<TE>   The walls were stripped to the concrete and resurfaced, carpeting
and furniture replaced, and the air vents checked.</TE>
<TE>   But even after parent company Dow Jones; the landlord, Brookfield
Properties Corp., and the newspaper union each hired an independent
consultant to do the highest-level testing and got the all-clear, a
construction crew found a small amount of asbestos-laced dust
remaining in the ventilation system. It was cleaned out and the area
retested.</TE>
<TE>   But most residents don't have the deep pockets to pay for
independent testing, or even the awareness that the lingering dust
poses a health risk.</TE>
<TE>   Whether out of denial, privacy concerns or pragmatism, only about
10% of eligible households have applied for the EPA cleanup. Many of
those who were most concerned have moved out of the neighborhood and
have had their places taken by those more interested in lower rents
or subsidies than in fears about the long-term health effects.</TE>
<TE>   More than half of the people who lived in the development closest
to the World Trade Center, Battery Park City, left the area last
year. But because of deep rent cuts and a federal grant program that
offers as much as $12,000 for every resident who moves into the area
and stays for two years, occupancy is back up to more than 90% and
sales and rental prices are back to normal. The new tenants tend to
be young singles, agents say.</TE>
<TE>   Real-estate shoppers in trendy TriBeCa, just north of the site,
are more aware of the subsidies than of the EPA program, said Bruce
Ehrmann, a senior vice president of the Stribling and Associates real
estate firm and a longtime TriBeCa resident who applied for cleanup
for his own apartment. "The air quality has not been a sales issue
for months."</TE>
<TE>   Other worried residents are simply ineligible because the EPA's
offer doesn't extend to Brooklyn.</TE>
<TE>   "They should do the cleaning in concentric circles radiating from
ground zero, building by building, until they don't find high
levels," said Kaufman, the EPA policy analyst. "We usually let
science determine the area of contamination, not a politician with a
pin and a map."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The captain of an aircraft carrier stationed in Japan was removed
from command due to "a loss of confidence" in his ability to lead,
the U.S. Navy said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Capt. Thomas A. Hejl, commanding officer of the Kitty Hawk, the
only aircraft carrier based in Japan, was temporarily transferred to
an administrative position in San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   Vice Adm. Robert F. Willard made the unusual decision "due to a
loss of confidence in Capt. Hejl's ability to lead his crew and carry
out essential missions and taskings," the Navy's 7th Fleet in Bahrain
said in a news release.</LD>
<TE>   "The United States is engaged in a global war against terrorism,
and it is vital that our forward deployed ships be ready to carry out
our nation's taskings when ordered," the Navy said.</TE>
<TE>   A 7th Fleet spokesman said that a series of events led to Hejl's
removal.</TE>
<TE>   The 41-year-old carrier failed an engineering assessment last week
that must be passed before it can return to sea. Earlier this year,
the Kitty Hawk also struck a buoy in Singapore, causing damage to the
carrier and prompting a reprimand from the commander of the carrier
battle group.</TE>
<TE>   Hejl will be succeeded by Capt. Robert Barbaree Jr., the
commanding officer of the Seattle and a former executive officer of a
San Diego-based aircraft carrier, the Nimitz.</TE>

was destroyed by the tornado that fell Monday on Ladysmith, Wis.,
about 100 miles northeast of Minneapolis. The afternoon twister
knocked down several downtown structures, including the water tower.
The tornado had followed a thunderstorm system that moved through the
region. About 40 people were taken to local hospitals with injuries,
but officials reported no deaths. Power remained out for 4,000 people
in the area.</CP>

<HD>West Nile Is Linked to Transplants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>West Nile virus infections have been confirmed in three transplant
patients in Florida and Georgia--one of whom died of
encephalitis--and a similar infection is suspected in a fourth
patient.</LD>
<LD>   All received organs from a Georgia woman who died from injuries
suffered in an automobile accident in late July, and federal
officials now think it is likely that her organs transmitted the
virus to the four patients.</LD>
<LD>   What they do not know is whether the woman was infected by a
mosquito bite or a blood transfusion. In the two days before she
died, she received several transfusions and other blood products from
as many as 60 donors.</LD>
<TE>   "There is clear evidence that organ transplantation was the
source" of the infections, said Dr. James Hughes of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. "We have to aggressively
pursue the possibility that a blood product is responsible for this."</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities have blocked the further use of blood products
from the approximately 60 donors, but "roughly 12 people" have
already received blood from them, Hughes said. Those recipients, the
remaining blood collected from the original donors and the donors
themselves will be tested for exposure to the virus, officials said
during a news conference Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   If no evidence of an infection is found in any of the donors,
officials will presume that the female donor who died was infected by
a mosquito, Hughes said.</TE>
<TE>   Health authorities are releasing little information about the
organ recipients because of patient confidentiality. But all received
their donor organs around the beginning of August and developed
symptoms within 2 to 2 1/2 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   One patient in Georgia died of encephalitis and a second was
hospitalized but is now recovering. A 63-year-old man in Florida was
hospitalized with encephalitis and is also recovering. A 71-year-old
woman in Florida developed a severe fever but is recuperating at
home. Officials suspect that she had a West Nile virus infection, but
it has not yet been confirmed by laboratory tests, said Dr. Steven
Wiersma of the Florida health department.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jesse Goodman of the Food and Drug Administration said that
potential blood donors and recipients should not be overly concerned
about the findings. He noted that more than 4.5 million Americans
receive blood products each year, but that this cluster of cases
represents the only instance in which West Nile transmission is
suspected.</TE>
<TE>   All four organ recipients were taking immune-suppressing drugs,
which vastly increased their chances of developing a severe illness
when exposed to the virus, Hughes said.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes also noted that there has never been any evidence of West
Nile virus transmission by blood in Israel, where the virus has been
present for much longer than in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Transmission of other viruses in the same family--including the
dengue and St. Louis encephalitis viruses--is also exceptionally
rare, he added.</TE>
<TE>   The first cases of human West Nile virus infection were observed
in the U.S. three years ago. By now, the virus has been observed in
every state east of the Rockies. As of Tuesday, there have been 673
confirmed human infections so far this year, with 32 deaths.</TE>

<LD>The influential Arab League is belatedly attempting to distance
itself from anti-Jewish comments spewed at a symposium run by an
affiliated organization. The halfhearted disavowal by the 22-member
league is insufficient. The episode demonstrates the lies and the
depth of hate that poison the atmosphere in much of the Middle East,
even in some rarefied Arab circles.</LD>
<LD>   The denunciations of Jews occurred at a conference last week
organized by the Zayed Center for Coordination and Follow-Up, a think
tank with links to the Arab League, whose members include Saudi
Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Iraq. The executive director of the Zayed
Center said in his opening remarks that Jews were "the enemies of all
nations," considered by many to be "cheaters" consumed by greed.</LD>
<LD>   Those libels have endured for centuries, even surviving the murder
of millions of Jews in the Holocaust. The advance notice of the
symposium said it would counter Israel's "lies and exaggerations"
about the Holocaust.</LD>
<TE>   The Zayed Center, based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, is a
respected regional forum that promotes Arab unity. Jewish groups
rightly condemned the seminar for adding to the bitterness between
Arabs and Jews. An Arab League spokesman belatedly argued that the
conference should not reflect badly on the league itself, which
recognizes Israel's right to exist within its pre-1967 borders.
Israel's triumph in war that year led to its occupation of Arab
lands, some of which it still holds. That occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza has inflamed anti-Israel passions among most Arabs.</TE>
<TE>   But many Arab intellectuals had distinguished between Jews in
general and Zionists, followers of the political movement that led to
the establishment of Israel in 1948. The Zayed Center dropped the
distinction, turning anti-Israel statements into full-blown
anti-Jewishness. Contrast that with President Bush's correct
insistence that the horror perpetrated by Osama bin Laden's followers
last Sept. 11 was separate from Islam.</TE>
<TE>   Newspapers in Arab nations, either controlled by governments or
following their lines, publish anti-Jewish lies daily. The
Israel-based Middle East Media Research Institute documents them,
including publication in Egyptian and Saudi newspapers this year of
the loathsome falsehood that matzos eaten on holy days must include
blood from a non-Jew.</TE>
<TE>   The Arab League's weak protestations are far too little. It has
yet to condemn the leadership of the Zayed Center or demand
retraction of the symposium's most hate-filled speech. Rantings
against Jews will not make Israel disappear, but they will continue
to curdle every effort to find peace.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The 2002 state Legislature produced some major achievements,
including the landmark global warming/auto emissions bill and a big
school construction bond issue for the November ballot, but the year
is most memorable for its failures. Lawmakers were inexcusably late
in passing a budget, and they allowed special interests to run wild
during the final week of the session. With cooperative leadership
absent inside the Capitol, the legislative process often went up for
sale.</LD>
<LD>   There's nothing unusual about frantic final days in any
legislature, but this windup bore an excess of confusion and personal
acrimony.</LD>
<LD>   The 62-day budget impasse was finally resolved Saturday night with
a deal that could have been cut two months ago.</LD>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis, standing aloof from his own state's budget fray,
said the issue could best be resolved by the lawmakers, which is what
finally happened. But perhaps they could have done this in July if
the governor had publicly knocked heads and told them to fix the
problem. We'll never know because Davis never really tried.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) showed little
imagination, proffering only a hokey cigarette tax increase. The GOP
vowed to reject any new taxes but finally acceded to "revenue
enhancements" that amounted to the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   One glaring example of the raw power of special-interest money was
the fate of a bill, carried by Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough),
to give consumers some control over personal information now shopped
around for profit by banks and other financial institutions. Opinion
polls show overwhelming public support for protection of financial
privacy. But voters were no match for the money poured in by banks,
insurers and credit card companies, enough to pull several
"pro-business" Democrats to their side and kill Speier's measure.
Political hyperbole reached new heights when one Republican senator
accused Democrats during the budget fight of "replicating the
mistakes of the Third Reich."</TE>
<TE>   California's term limit law, which puts a cap of six years on
service in the Assembly and eight in the Senate, has made the
Legislature an amateur's playground. Lawmakers, even their leaders,
often have dwindling regard for legislative traditions and procedures
designed to create a climate for sound lawmaking. Campaign
fund-raising, one thing term limit proponents expected to rein in, is
more obvious than in past years, and just as suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Also to blame is the 2001 reapportionment of legislative
districts, which gave most members of both major parties safe seats
and hardened the divide between Democrats and Republicans. Members
have less to fear from voters. Compromise is more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature's end-of-session performance will surely give a
boost to voter apathy. And think of the dilemma of civics teachers
trying to explain the legislative process to students. Leadership
took a holiday, and we don't know when it's coming back.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>No mechanical problems were found in a car that lurched into a crowd
waiting for the Balboa Island ferry, injuring 13 people, police said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The car, driven by 87-year-old Mary Anne Nash of Newport Beach,
accelerated out of line Monday as she waited to board a ferry from
Balboa Island.</LD>
<LD>   Nash's 1997 Volvo had "no indication that there was a mechanical
problem" and there was no evidence that she had been using drugs or
alcohol, Newport Beach Police Sgt. Steve Shulman said. The driver
could be cited and will need a state Department of Motor Vehicles
examination to retain her driver's license, he said. Nash was not
injured in the crash.</LD>
<TE>   A 14-year-old girl from Las Vegas, whose name was not released,
remains hospitalized at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana for a
compound leg fracture. Kathleen Bingley, 44, of Orange was reported
in stable condition at the hospital with internal injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Nash was second in a line of cars for a ferry that was docking.
She told police that when she restarted her car, it lurched forward.
Police said the car swerved and traveled about 75 feet along a
sidewalk, hitting pedestrians, newspaper racks and waste cans.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Former San Francisco 49er and USC All-American lineman Jeff Bregel
was arrested early Labor Day morning on suspicion of drunk driving
after rear-ending another car in Granada Hills, Los Angeles police
said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The 38-year-old Granada Hills man was arrested about 1:30 on
Rinaldi Street at Balboa Boulevard, LAPD spokesman Sgt. John
Pasquariello said.</LD>
<LD>   Bregel, who is being held at the Van Nuys jail in lieu of $50,000
bail, was booked for investigation of felony drunk driving. The other
driver was not seriously injured, police said.</LD>

<HD>Innocent Plea in Stalking</HD>
<DH>Court: Other charges are being considered in the case
against British official's son.</DH>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A prosecutor said Tuesday he was considering unspecified additional
charges against the son of Britain's top judicial officer.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Fell made the announcement before an
O.C. Superior Court judge moments after Alastair Irvine pleaded not
guilty to felony stalking, vandalism and weapons charges.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the charges are related to allegations that Irvine, 25,
was rejected by a tanning salon worker, then stalked her boyfriend
and vandalized his truck.</LD>
<TE>   Irvine entered the plea through his attorney, James D. Riddet, who
also asked the court to issue a gag order barring anyone involved in
the case from talking to the news media. Fell argued against it,
saying most of the media attention has come from Britain.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Ronald P. Kreber declined to make a ruling. He said the
issue should be decided by the trial judge.</TE>

<HD>Pomp Past, Masses Flock to Cathedral</HD>
<DH>Religion: Awe and piety, even tears, are much in evidence
as people tour complex, attend services.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER and HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after the elite of Los Angeles and princes of the church filled
the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels at its invitation-only
dedication, the soaring edifice Tuesday became a cathedral for the
common man and woman.</LD>
<LD>   Surprising even the priests who hoped for a good turnout, an
estimated 1,200 people showed up for the first daily Mass at 7 a.m.
An additional 2,500 attended the 12:10 p.m. Mass, part of a first-day
crowd that archdiocese officials estimated at 12,000.</LD>
<LD>   Norwalk resident Margarita Gonzalez, 68, took a bus, the Green
Line train and then the Blue Line to get to the new downtown
landmark. The trip from her home to the statue of Mary at the
cathedral lasted an hour and 40 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   Kneeling before the statue, Gonzalez prayed and dabbed her tears
with a tissue. "They say it cost $200 million, and that it was a
waste of money," she said. "But really it's all for God. What's $200
million for God?"</TE>
<TE>   Many of Tuesday's visitors were as excited and awestruck as the
business, civic and political leaders at Monday's dedication liturgy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is magnificent, I tell you," said Rob Lazaga of Duarte. "The
people who come here will see the flow of Jesus' life into their own.
It could be transforming."</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of overwhelming," said Matt Hourihan, 44, of Pasadena,
who left the church 20 years ago. "All the thought that went into it.
It makes me want to return to the church."</TE>
<TE>   Priests and others who had been present Monday said the mood was
different Tuesday. There were far more displays of simple piety and
many more tears.</TE>
<TE>   After the 12:10 p.m. Mass, a line 90 feet long formed inside the
cathedral, as the devout waited to approach the 14-foot tall wooden
cross bearing the cast-bronze corpus of the suffering Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the archdiocese had invited cathedral visitors to
walk around the altar and approach the crucifix. They did not expect
what happened next.</TE>
<TE>   One after another, worshipers went up to the statue, crossed
themselves and began to touch it, many with tears in their eyes. They
rubbed the bronze feet of the suffering savior; they rubbed the
flayed and abraded skin. They lingered.</TE>
<TE>   The scene reminded some of the way pilgrims rub the bronze feet of
a statue of St. Peter in the Basilica in Vatican City that bears his
name. Over the ages, the toes on Peter's feet have disappeared from
the rubbings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really amazing," said archdiocesan spokesman Tod Tamberg.
"You could see 500 years from now the tradition here is to kiss the
shins and touch the shins of the crucifix--and it's starting today."</TE>
<TE>   Those in Tuesday's crowd were mostly working people, kneeling,
praying, paying $2 and lighting a votive candle.</TE>
<TE>   A Latino couple stood in silence for several minutes in the
cathedral plaza before a shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the patron
saint of Mexico. "It is beautiful in my heart," Marcos de la Cruz of
Van Nuys said in broken English.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Gutierrez, 75, a Pico Rivera resident and native of
Guatemala, tarried before the painting of Mexico's patroness a little
bit longer than her niece and her two small children. As her
relatives walked away, Gutierrez, with halting steps, ventured closer
to the painting and, standing amid the other onlookers, gazed at it
shyly.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real beauty," she said. "Guatemalans don't venerate her
the same way Mexicans do, but to me she is the world's mother and a
mother to me. I love her dearly."</TE>
<TE>   Inside the cathedral, secretaries on their lunch hour and a Latino
family reverently knelt in the Blessed Sacrament Chapel before the
stylized tabernacle containing the consecrated bread and wine, which
Catholics believe is the body and blood of Jesus Christ. A little
girl took a long-stemmed rose from a bouquet her mother had brought
and gently laid it on the floor before the tabernacle.</TE>
<TE>   There were old people in wheelchairs, young mothers with infants,
working men in white cotton T-shirts, and a teenage boy wearing a
baseball cap and headphones. "Oh, my God, it's beautiful and it's
joyful. It's a different feeling. It's just like floating up in the
air," said Rebecca Cate of La Canada Flintridge.</TE>
<TE>   One man carried a plastic grocery bag as he kissed the ring of
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, the archbishop of Los Angeles. An old woman
approached the cardinal and wept as he blessed her.</TE>
<TE>   "God bless you. Thanks for coming," Mahony told one.
"Congratulations," someone told the cardinal. Another momentarily
held his hand. "Thank you for your beautiful cathedral," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our cathedral," Mahony corrected him.</TE>
<TE>   Commenting on those who held a banner Monday protesting the cost
of the cathedral, the cardinal said, "I wish people carrying 'No Fat
Cat Cathedral' signs could have been here today."</TE>

<CX>   Consecrated wine--A California section story Wednesday about
Catholics worshipping at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels
incorrectly reported that consecrated bread and wine are kept in a
tabernacle following Mass. The consecrated bread, or host, is kept in
the tabernacle. But any consecrated wine, which Catholics believe is
the blood of Christ, that is not consumed during Mass is either
consumed by a priest or other liturgical minister or reverently
poured into the ground.</CX>

<HD>Insiders May Have an Edge for LAPD Job</HD>
<DH>Police: The criteria for picking a new chief favor
applicants familiar with the department. But that could be offset by
proven track record elsewhere.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Los Angeles Police Commission today begins interviewing 13
police chief candidates, it will apply guidelines that favor
applicants who know the inner workings of the LAPD and can show an
emotional connection to the city.</LD>
<LD>   It is not enough to be a good crime fighter and leader under the
selection criteria developed for the commission by a citizens
committee. Commissioners say they want a chief who appreciates Los
Angeles' diversity, and has the skills to overhaul the department
while navigating a treacherous political terrain.</LD>
<LD>   Those requirements would seem to give an edge to the eight
applicants who have worked in the Los Angeles Police Department.
Still, officials say, East Coast candidates such as William Bratton
and John Timoney, both veterans of the New York Police Department,
could make up for their lack of local experience with their proven
track records in big-city police departments.</LD>
<TE>   "There is an advantage from being from within [the LAPD]," said
Police Commission President Rick Caruso. "You understand the history
of it, you understand how it operates. The downside is you might not
have the experience of turning something around because you've never
been given the opportunity. That is what we ultimately have to
balance."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the choice will rest with Mayor James K. Hahn, who
said in an interview this week that LAPD experience is just one
measure he will apply in selecting the person to replace Bernard C.
Parks, who was denied a second five-year term by the Police
Commission in April.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said he is looking for four things: someone who can
lower the crime rate, reform the department, motivate the rank and
file and strengthen community-policing efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not saying it is an absolute that someone has to be from
the inside," Hahn said. "That was certainly a strong sentiment of the
people who were on the citizens committee. But at the end of the day,
we want the best person, regardless of what their background is."</TE>
<TE>   Meeting in a private suite in a Westwood high-rise, the Police
Commission will be guided in its interviews by a 31-page report
prepared by the citizens committee.</TE>
<TE>   The five-member commission wants to submit a list of three
finalists to Hahn by the end of the month. Under the City Charter,
the mayor is charged with selecting the chief from the list of three.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn is certain to come under some political pressure as he makes
his decision, but so far there has been no organized public lobbying
for candidates of a particular race or gender. He will make his
choice in the face of lingering anger, particularly in the black
community, over his refusal to reappoint Parks, and at a time when
the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood are contemplating breaking away
to form their own cities.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD veterans have a wide range of experience, some strong in
the area of community policing and others in training and
recruitment.</TE>
<TE>   Asst. Chief David Gascon is the highest-ranking LAPD official up
for the job. With 32 years on the force, he is best known for his
prominent role as the department's spokesman during the O.J. Simpson
murder case. He's the one who told the city that Simpson was on the
run. Gascon was a finalist for the chief's position five years ago.
He may be at a disadvantage, however, because of his strong ties to
Parks' administration.</TE>
<TE>   Also under consideration is Deputy Chief Margaret A. York, who is
in charge of all department operations in downtown Los Angeles and
has 33 years on the force. York, the first woman in the history of
the LAPD to reach the rank of deputy chief, once served as head of
Internal Affairs. That job provided insight into the problems and
culture of the LAPD, but also may have put her at odds with
rank-and-file officers who were charged with misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Another woman up for the job is Cmdr. Sharon Papa, who was head of
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police Department until it
merged with the LAPD in 1997. Unlike York, Papa did not rise through
the ranks of the LAPD, and may not have the same cachet as someone
who spent his or her career with the department.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD candidates with strong connections to the community include
Deputy Chief David Kalish, who is in charge of the department's
Westside operations, and Cmdr. Jim McDonnell, a Medal of Valor winner
who is leading the department's efforts to revitalize its senior lead
officer program.</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles native, Kalish joined the LAPD in 1975. Some
activists hope he will become the first gay chief of a major police
department. Known for being fair and approachable, Kalish is well
liked by members of the department and the community.</TE>
<TE>   Another insider set to be interviewed is Cmdr. George Gascon (no
relation to David Gascon). Gascon, also a Los Angeles native, is in
charge of the department's officer training program. He is considered
an expert on police use-of-force issues and community policing, and
got a high-profile boost when former LAPD officer and crime writer
Joseph Wambaugh touted him in a newspaper column.</TE>
<TE>   Two other LAPD veterans being considered left the department to
head agencies elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Portland, Ore., Police Chief Mark Kroeker, a deputy chief when he
left the LAPD five years ago, headed the San Fernando Valley Division
for 2 1/2 years. Some people have speculated that Hahn would be
willing to appoint Kroeker to the LAPD's top job in an effort to
appease secessionists. Kroeker has come under criticism recently,
however, for making disparaging remarks a decade ago about
gays--something that could ultimately undermine his candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez, meanwhile, held a number of jobs
during his tenure in the LAPD. He was in charge of the Hollenbeck
Division, headed the department's training efforts and oversaw the
Hollywood vice squad. He also served as the Watts field commander
during the 1992 riots.</TE>
<TE>   The five candidates without LAPD experience will stand on other
strengths and connections to the city.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Police Chief Paul Walters, who has spent 31 years in
Santa Ana, helped Hahn develop the LAPD's flexible work schedule last
year. Arturo Venegas worked for the Fresno Police Department before
becoming Sacramento police chief in 1993. He was a finalist for the
LAPD job five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton was in charge of the New York Police Department under
former Mayor Rudy Giuliani. He is widely credited for dramatically
cutting the crime rate in New York City. He also was the head of the
Boston Police Department and the New York City transit police.
Outspoken and dynamic, Bratton has written a book on policing and has
appeared in dozens of newspapers and magazines. Some City Hall
insiders believe that Bratton's huge personality could overshadow the
low-key Hahn, making the mayor reluctant to give the Boston native
the LAPD post.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton has spent the last year monitoring the LAPD's progress in
implementing a variety of reforms outlined in a federal consent
decree. Because of that, he believes he has the inside knowledge it
takes to be the city's chief.</TE>
<TE>   Timoney, meanwhile, is seen as a more compatible match for Hahn.
An Irish immigrant who grew up in poverty in New York City, Timoney
is down to earth and affable. He is a career cop with an Irish brogue
who worked his way up the ranks of the New York Police Department,
becoming one of Bratton's top deputies.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, he was head of the Philadelphia Police Department,
where he forged strong ties with the community. With a love for the
East Coast, he faces the challenge of proving to Los Angeles
officials that he is familiar with the workings of the LAPD and the
city. Also, the fact that former Chief Willie L. Williams came from
Philadelphia could prove to be a detriment for Timoney.</TE>
<TE>   Ronnie Watson, chief of the Cambridge, Mass., Police Department,
faces the challenge of showing that he can make the transition from
his 270-member department to the LAPD, which has more than 9,000
officers. Los Angeles officials say his candidacy is bolstered by the
fact that he spent more than 30 years in the Chicago Police
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles civil rights attorney Connie Rice, who served on the
citizens committee that developed the LAPD selection criteria, said
she recognizes that there is no perfect candidate for the job.</TE>
<TE>   "It would take an action superhero to do everything," she said.
"But you need someone who has the leadership abilities and the
know-how to get things done in this city. Most importantly, we need
someone to reunite this department. It is in tatters right now."</TE>

<HD>Over Dim Sum, They Study Asia</HD>
<DH>A new USC program delves not only into language, but also
culture and food. A free trip to the Far East is among the rewards.</DH>

<LD>Facing the first dim sum cart of his life, David Saeger, 18, paused.
He had no clue that a cluster of snowball-shaped buns contained
barbecued pork, much less how to name them after just one week of
Chinese language classes. Finally, he decided to improvise.</LD>
<LD>   "Nage," he told a smiling waitress at the Empress Pavilion in Los
Angeles' Chinatown. "That one."</LD>
<LD>   That emboldened classmate Linda Chamberlin, also 18. "Liang ge,"
or "two of that," she said, pointing to a couple of beef dishes.</LD>
<TE>   With their Mandarin-language professor's help, the students soon
had their table supplied with steamed dumplings, shrimp rolls and
pastries filled with bean paste. The students grinned with
delight--and self-consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just odd," Saeger said. "I feel so out of place and stupid."</TE>
<TE>   But he did want to be there--which is why he enrolled in USC's new
Explore East Asia program. The classes are designed to enhance
knowledge of Asia for undergraduates who are not necessarily majoring
in the subjects related to the area. A free trip to China will cap
the yearlong experience for the 10 students enrolled this year, while
students completing the program over the next two years will go to
Japan and Korea.</TE>
<TE>   The program was launched with a $2-million grant this year from
the Freeman Foundation, a nonprofit organization based in Stowe, Vt.,
which seeks to deepen Americans' appreciation of Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Houghton Freeman, the foundation's president, said USC's Explore
East Asia program "does much in its way to help us achieve our
mission."</TE>
<TE>   For Sean O'Connell, it took a book of Japanese fiction, "Monkey
Brain Sushi," to get him interested in East Asia during his college
years. Now, a decade later, he is academic coordinator of USC's East
Asian languages and cultures department, which sponsors the program.</TE>
<TE>   "People tend to look inwardly at themselves," he said. "We're
trying to get people involved in Asia and away from Eurocentric
tendencies. The more they learn about someone else, the more they can
improve themselves."</TE>
<TE>   One of Explore East Asia's attractions is that students don't have
to pay for the classes, worth about $11,000 a year. The free trip
across the Pacific doesn't hurt, either.</TE>
<TE>   This year's 10 scholars spent four intense weeks in July and
August studying Chinese. They will take another course on China or
the language during the school year. In May or June, they will travel
to China for five weeks of immersion learning.</TE>
<TE>   The students will probably visit Beijing, Shanghai and Xian and
possibly Taiwan, O'Connell said. They'll take a course at the same
time, possibly in Chinese politics.</TE>
<TE>   When they return, they will teach related four-week courses in the
fall at Los Angeles high schools on such subjects as politics,
history and culture. The goal is to guide other young minds toward
East Asia.</TE>
<TE>   The USC students are admitted to Explore East Asia only if they
have had no prior college-level coursework in Asian languages or
culture and cannot speak the languages fluently. Although about
two-thirds of USC students in other classes offered by the languages
and cultures department have East Asian ethnic backgrounds, only two
of the 10 in the Explore East Asia program do.</TE>
<TE>   They are students like USC freshman Chris Grunenwald, 18, from
Merrill, Wis., who can't recall a single Asian American in his high
school graduating class of about 300. There's freshman Saeger, of La
Canada Flintridge, whose primary interaction with Asia had consisted
of a popular Japanese video game. There's Chamberlin, of Seattle,
whose high school barely touched on Asian history, and Hooman Kazemi,
20, of Los Angeles, who speaks Spanish and Persian and thought
Chinese would help with his international relations major.</TE>
<TE>   And there's freshman Eve Kan, 18, of Lewisville, Texas, and
sophomore Melanie Cheng, 19, of Rolling Hills Estates, Chinese
Americans who never learned their ancestral language.</TE>
<TE>   Five days a week this summer, these students crammed into Room 221
of the Mark Taper Hall of the Humanities and stared at the
blackboards containing Chinese characters chalked in white and
orange. On one day, their spirited professor, Zoe Wu, holding
flashcards labeled "tea" and "soda," urged them to speak the words in
Mandarin.</TE>
<TE>   The program meant packing three hours of Chinese study into a
day--equivalent to one week of classes during a normal schedule--and
six or seven hours of homework. It meant taking four quizzes, two
tests and one midterm exam in a week. It meant sore fingers after
writing 500 Chinese characters a day.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm getting carpal tunnel syndrome," Saeger quipped.</TE>
<TE>   In the classroom, Wu spoke almost exclusively in Mandarin. She
launched into dialogues with students, introducing new words and
phrases. "Ni xihuan bu xihuan cha?" she asked the students, inquiring
if they like tea.</TE>
<TE>   "Wo xihuan cha," Kan answered in the affirmative.</TE>
<TE>   Wu also pushes her students to converse with one another in
Mandarin.</TE>
<TE>   The students speak carefully, knowing that stressing the wrong
syllable could skew their intended meaning. When Wu called for a rare
five-minute rest, a collective sigh broke out. "Now is the hardest,"
Wu said. "They're learning everything from scratch."</TE>
<TE>   But the frenzied pace also brought the students a measure of
delight as they discovered that they understood some storefront signs
in Chinatown during their recent dim sum outing. And it resulted in
the satisfaction of being able to order food in Chinese at a Chinese
restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   The trip to China will offer students a chance not only to study
language, but "what goes behind the meaning of language," said
Dominic Cheung, department chairman.Dim sum, for example, in addition
to describing small plates of Chinese dumplings and food, literally
means "a bit of the heart," which alludes to a kind of Chinese
hospitality, Cheung said.</TE>
<TE>   When the USC students visit Chinese universities next spring,
Cheung said, they'll find out firsthand what "Chinese courtesy"
means.</TE>
<TE>   "When you go off and explore, that's when you'll really learn,"
O'Connell told the students over dim sum. "It's limitless."</TE>

<HD>Feeling the Pain of Health-Care Cuts</HD>
<DH>Clinics: Reductions of service at local centers and their
pending closures pose a hardship for residents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>News that the North Hollywood Health Center would no longer take
walk-ins had run on Spanish-language television and elsewhere, but
Peter Jacquin hadn't heard.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday morning, the 31-year-old Van Nuys resident showed up at
the Los Angeles County clinic with son Christopher, 13, in tow.
Before the boy could start classes at nearby James Madison Middle
School, he needed to be immunized against hepatitis B.</LD>
<LD>   The woman behind the counter told the Jacquins that the clinic is
no longer doing immunizations or TB tests and that only patients with
appointments are now being seen at the North Hollywood clinic and a
smaller facility in Tujunga.</LD>
<TE>   "She said the only place to go is Pacoima, and they're packed. It
means I'm going to miss another day at work," said Jacquin, a sales
associate at Home Depot in Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The San Fernando Valley facilities are the first of 11 community
clinics and four school-based health centers operated by the county
that will close by Oct. 1 because of budget constraints. Approved in
August by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, the closures
will force about 18,000 people to seek care elsewhere, according to
John Wallace, a spokesman for the county Department of Health
Services.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been taking the kids here for years," said Jacquin, who
hoped Christopher could get the necessary immunization today at
Mid-Valley Comprehensive Health Center in Van Nuys, which is expected
to remain open.</TE>
<TE>   Without walk-ins, the North Hollywood clinic was
uncharacteristically quiet Tuesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like we're on vacation," one of the health workers said to
her colleagues. "Last week, it was really, really busy," said
another. "But word gets out on the street and now it's dead."</TE>
<TE>   Patients make about 36,000 visits a year to the North Hollywood
clinic, a neighborhood fixture for 50 years, said nurse manager Karen
Menacker. Typically, the nurse practitioner who handles drop-ins sees
about 20 patients a day and another 40 people come in for
immunizations or TB tests. About 80% of the patients are Latino, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel bad for these patients," said Menacker, who runs both the
North Hollywood and Tujunga facilities. "The majority of our patients
are the working poor. They're working, but they don't have health
insurance."</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen people who visited the clinic Tuesday morning
without appointments were referred elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Roxanne Rodriguez, 22, of North Hollywood was concerned about a
swelling in her arm. She was told to have it checked out at Olive
View/UCLA Medical Center in Sylmar.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of bustle at the clinic came as a pleasant surprise to
Aura Sobernis, 23, who had brought in her 6-month-old daughter,
Emily, who had a rash. Sobernis had made an appointment the week
before and was seen promptly by one of the medical staff who
prescribed an ointment for the baby. "Usually we have to wait,"
Sobernis said.</TE>
<TE>   Menacker said that the clinic would continue to provide adult
primary care, pediatric care and women's services, by appointment,
for the rest of the month.</TE>
<TE>   "And we'll still triage patients in case we have a patient who's
having chest pains or something," she said. "We do have physicians
who will check the patient and say, 'Call 911,' or refer them
elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   The North Hollywood clinic has 22 nurses on staff, eight to 10
health-care providers--either physicians or nurse practitioners--and
an office staff of 21, Menacker said. "We are not emergent care," she
said. "We don't do stitches or broken bones or anything like that."
Such cases are usually referred to Olive View, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But there is concern about the large number of people with chronic
illnesses--about half the clinic's adult patients--especially those
with diabetes and high blood pressure, Menacker said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of our patients have no other health care," she said. "If
they run out of their medication, that's when they get into trouble.
That's when you see them in the emergency rooms."</TE>
<TE>   She predicted that displaced patients will overtax remaining
public health facilities. "I think in the long run it's going to be
more expensive," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The staff has been told that they will be offered jobs elsewhere
in county health services, Menacker said.</TE>
<TE>   But Maria Castro, who runs the business side of the North
Hollywood clinic, said she is afraid many staff members will not be
able to take jobs elsewhere because they live nearby. "We have
employees with children, so they have child-care issues," Castro
said.</TE>
<TE>   Menacker said the clinic's closure will be a real blow to the
neighborhood. Currently, patients without other health insurance pay
$40 a visit, which includes any lab work, X-rays and medication.</TE>

<HD>Fillmore Fire Was Set, Authorities Say</HD>
<DH>Damage: Investigators are attempting to determine if blaze
that consumed 100 acres was started deliberately.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A smoky 100-acre fire that threatened a seniors-only mobile home park
near Fillmore was set, but investigators said they have not
determined whether it was ignited intentionally or by accident.</LD>
<LD>   "We haven't determined the exact cause," said Keith Mashburn,
chief investigator for the Ventura County Fire Department. "But it
was human set. People called to say they saw somebody running from
the scene. And we had another report of a guy throwing a cigarette
from a car."</LD>
<LD>   Emergency crews fully contained the fire early Tuesday after it
moved 1 1/2 miles east in the Santa Clara River bed. Two
water-dropping Ventura County sheriff's helicopters, 15 county Fire
Department engines and 150 firefighters halted the blaze about 2 a.m.</LD>
<TE>   It was declared out by Tuesday afternoon, although mop-up crews
worked into the evening snuffing out with water and foam any
lingering embers inside tough bamboo reeds.</TE>
<TE>   The Fillmore fire was the second in two days, following a
five-acre blaze near Lake Casitas on Sunday. They both showed how
quickly a spark can erupt forcefully, and prompted fire officials to
ask for caution as this fire season enters its fall peak.</TE>
<TE>   "It clearly illustrates how dry this vegetation is," said Joe
Luna, a spokesman for the Fire Department. "The fire danger is
extreme because of the lack of rain."</TE>
<TE>   County rainfall has been less than half of normal so far this
year--one of the driest on record. Temperatures also reached record
or near-record highs over the weekend in inland communities. It was
106 degrees Monday in Fillmore, where flames reached at least 50 feet
in height and crept to within 50 yards of the El Dorado mobile home
park.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fillmore fire started in the river bottom, but it quickly
posed a threat to residents in that mobile home park," Luna said.
"It's alarming when we wake up in the morning and the temperatures
are extreme. It doesn't take much to ignite vegetation, and then it
burns violently."</TE>
<TE>   There have been several brush fires in the county this summer. The
22,000-acre Wolf fire in June on national forest land above Ojai was
the largest. The cause is often accidental and sometimes is simple
recklessness, authorities said. The Wolf fire was started by people
firing guns in dry brush near California 33 about 12 miles north of
Ojai, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The Fillmore fire could have been caused by a similar lack of
care, Mashburn said. It was ignited near the A Street bridge over the
Santa Clara River on the edge of central Fillmore.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an area where a lot of people frequently ride their off-road
motorcycles," the investigator said. "And people just go down there
and hang out during the day. So there's a lot of human activity. A
lot of times it's just plain carelessness."</TE>
<TE>   Fire investigators spent Tuesday questioning witnesses in
Fillmore, Mashburn said.</TE>

<HD>Residents Flee as 5 Homes Burn</HD>
<DH>Fires: Flames race across rural Leona Valley north of L.A.
while Azusa Canyon blaze still rages. Crews hope for rain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL CHAMBERS and ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A raging wildfire swept through the rural community of Leona Valley
on Tuesday afternoon, destroying five homes and sending residents
running for their lives as more than 2,500 firefighters battled
blazes in San Gabriel Mountains brush and timberland parched by one
of the driest years on record.</LD>
<LD>   "A wave of flames came over our heads," said Leona Valley resident
Tony Siro.</LD>
<LD>   "We all ran for safety. The firefighters were hiding behind their
equipment. It was your worst nightmare."</LD>
<TE>   Although the wind-driven firestorm raced along Bouquet Canyon Road
through the community 25 miles north of Los Angeles in seconds, there
were no serious injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The capricious flames claimed some homes, spared others. Siro was
one of the lucky ones. His neighbor Kendra Supple wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   Supple, who was away when the fire did its work, returned a few
hours later to find her one-story, redwood-sided home reduced to
charred timber and ashes.</TE>
<TE>   She said furnishings, records, treasured keepsakes that reached
back through four generations of her family--all of it was lost.</TE>
<TE>   "All I have left is the clothes on my back," Supple said.</TE>
<TE>   She said the greatest loss may have been a Gibson guitar her
father gave her when she was a girl.</TE>
<TE>   "It's gone," she said. "My parents are gone. You can't get that
back."</TE>
<TE>   The Leona Valley blaze was one of four that burned Tuesday in the
rugged backcountry north and west of Los Angeles. By nightfall
Tuesday, at least 19 structures had been destroyed and more than
20,000 acres had been blackened.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials said the best news was the approach of moist
tropical air from Hurricane Hernan, a deteriorating storm off the
coast of Baja California that could bring scattered rain to Southern
California by this afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "That could help a lot," said Ed Gililland, a fire information
officer with the U.S. Forest Service in Arcadia.</TE>
<TE>   The newest fire was the blaze that erupted Tuesday afternoon in
the Leona Valley. Fanned by hot afternoon breezes, the blaze spread
rapidly, burning more than 4,000 acres by sundown.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said at least 200 residents were evacuated. An
evacuation center was set up at Highland High School in Palmdale.</TE>
<TE>   More than 750 firefighters, including 10 engine crews from Los
Angeles, were deployed to fight the blaze. Two SuperScooper planes
that refilled their water tanks at nearby Lake Elizabeth were also
fighting the flames, along with four water-dropping helicopters. It
was the first time this summer that the scooper planes were used in
the Los Angeles area.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was still spreading late Tuesday, and officials said they
had no idea when it might be contained.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's largest fire continued to burn out of control along
steep mountain ridges in the Angeles National Forest 15 miles north
of Azusa, where more than 14,500 acres had burned by Tuesday night.
Officials said at least 14 structures had been charred, including the
Coldbrook ranger station, a Forest Service facility that was closed
several years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Gililland said that despite the efforts of about 1,550
firefighters on the ground and 16 water-dropping helicopters and
aerial tankers, the blaze was only 10% contained at sundown Tuesday.
Full containment was not expected for at least a week.</TE>
<TE>   About 8,000 campers and residents were evacuated Sunday and
Monday. Many of them were forced to flee over a narrow emergency road
connecting Crystal Lake and Angeles Crest Highway after flames
blocked California 39, the normal access route extending south from
the lake to Azusa. There were no reports of injury.</TE>
<TE>   The fire broke out about 12:30 p.m. Sunday beside California 39
near Rincon. The dry brush burned rapidly in temperatures that peaked
near 100 degrees, and the flames spread rapidly into the timbered
mountains that soar above 9,000 feet at the crown of the forest.</TE>
<TE>   A third fire, near Castaic, was knocked down about 1:45 p.m.
Tuesday after blackening about 1,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   That fire, which started Sunday afternoon near Interstate 5 in
Castaic, forced the closure of the freeway for several hours Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze briefly threatened mobile homes at Paradise Valley Park
in Castaic, but 400 firefighters were able to stem the flames before
any structures were damaged.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, firefighters put out a 100-acre blaze that
briefly threatened a mobile home park near Fillmore on Tuesday.
Officials said the fire, which started in undergrowth in the Santa
Clara River bed, may have been intentionally set.</TE>
<TE>   During the meteorological year that ended July 1, rainfall totals
were some of the lowest ever recorded in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The precipitation total in downtown Los Angeles was just 4.42
inches, the lowest since records began in 1877.</TE>
<TE>   By now, because of their unusually low water content, the
chaparral and trees in the open lands and forests surrounding the Los
Angeles area are extraordinarily flammable.</TE>
<TE>   But the National Weather Service said Tuesday that a little help
may be on the way.</TE>
<TE>   Hurricane Hernan was weakening rapidly off the coast of Baja
California on Tuesday, but forecasters said the storm still had
enough punch to spin off wide bands of moisture that should start
sweeping over Southern California by today.</TE>
<TE>   The clouds should drop temperatures a little, and the Weather
Service said there's about a 30% chance of showers this afternoon and
tonight, increasing to about a 50% chance Thursday and Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The rain is not expected to be strong enough to put a serious dent
in the continuing drought, but it should ease the fire danger for a
week or so.</TE>

<HD>Judge's Instruction Benefits Westerfield</HD>
<DH>Trial: Jurors are given more latitude to spare the life of
Danielle van Dam's killer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The judge in the David Westerfield trial decided Tuesday to give an
instruction that would provide jurors greater latitude to spare the
life of the man convicted of killing 7-year-old Danielle van Dam.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors and defense attorneys argued about an instruction
commonly given in death penalty cases. Superior Court Judge William
Mudd sided with the defense.</LD>
<LD>   The clash between prosecutors and defense attorneys came as jurors
were given the afternoon off from hearing testimony in the penalty
portion of Westerfield's trial for Van Dam's abduction and slaying.</LD>
<TE>   At issue is a jury instruction that says that jurors should weigh
mitigating factors--in this case, the 50-year-old Westerfield's lack
of a criminal record and his history of being a good employee and
loyal friend--against the aggravating ones, such as the cruelty of
killing a child and the emotional devastation suffered by her parents
and others.</TE>
<TE>   As written, the instruction says that if jurors find the
aggravating factors "so substantial," then such a finding "warrants"
the death penalty. Prosecutors routinely ask judges to modify that
instruction to tell jurors that they "shall" impose death if the
aggravating factors greatly outweigh the mitigating ones.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Rebecca P. Jones told Mudd that, as written, the
instruction will allow the jurors to vote for life in imprisonment
"for any reason at all," including mercy. That brought a protest from
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not the law and that's not fair," Dusek said.</TE>
<TE>   In two recent high-profile murder cases in San Diego County,
judges have granted prosecutors motions to change "warrants" to
"shall"--and in both cases juries have voted unanimously for death.
One case involved the scalding murder of a young girl by her aunt and
uncle.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, a jury in a death penalty case is asked to
recommend either death or life in prison without parole. If the jury
votes for death, the judge can reduce that sentence to life in
prison. If the jury deadlocks, the prosecution can seek a retrial on
the penalty phase.</TE>
<TE>   During jury selection, all the jurors said they would be capable
of imposing the death penalty in a murder case. But they also said
they would not automatically vote for death.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, several friends and relatives testified in favor of
Westerfield, telling jurors about his kindness and helpfulness.</TE>

<HD>Schools OK Health Pact</HD>
<DH>Labor: L.A. Unified and its seven unions agree on benefits,
and trustees approve a final budget. But teachers still want a pay
raise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District and its seven unions reached
agreement on health benefits Tuesday, solving one of the most crucial
issues in ongoing labor negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   The district's new health plan will maintain current medical
coverage for more than 100,000 active and retired district employees
for 2003. The school district had said it didn't have enough money to
cover rising health coverage rates.</LD>
<LD>   The benefits were among the last items to be added before the
Board of Education approved the final 2002-03 budget by a vote of 4
to 1. Two board members abstained.</LD>
<TE>   Sam Kresner, a United Teachers Los Angeles member and chairman of
the labor-controlled health benefits committee, said resolution of
the health benefits issue was a welcome development. But the teachers
union, whose current contract ends next June, is still demanding a 5%
wage increase that district leaders say they cannot afford.</TE>
<TE>   The benefits "are a great add-on, but they don't take the place of
having a decent salary," Kresner said.</TE>
<TE>   The final budget came three weeks after the district found an
extra $228 million in unspent funds from last year. Budget officials
proposed several expenditures to ease the effect of $455 million in
cutbacks in recent months to cover a massive shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   The district used $56 million to cover rising health coverage
costs; $20 million will be used to replenish the workers'
compensation fund; $350,000 will go for an expanded lobbyist
registration and ethics program; and $11 million will be spent to
address problems at 10 troubled schools targeted for criticism by the
state last year.</TE>
<TE>   The district has $26 million left after the planned expenditures,
which would be enough for only a 1% raise for teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Supt. Roy Romer said he is hopeful that pay negotiations will come
to a satisfactory conclusion, but said he doesn't know where the
money for raises would come from.</TE>
<TE>   Board member Julie Korenstein abstained from voting on the budget
because the current budget does not include any provision for salary
increases.</TE>
<TE>   Board member Genethia Hudley Hayes said she voted against the
budget because the superintendent's staff failed to list among its
fiscal priorities the closing of the achievement gap between poor and
wealthier students.</TE>
<TE>   Board member Jose Huizar echoed Hayes' concerns and said he
abstained because he objected to cutbacks, especially a measure that
saved $70 million by increasing class sizes in grades 4 to 12.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Jury Deadlocks on Penalty for Killer of Hospital
Workers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County jury Tuesday deadlocked on whether a man convicted
of killing three people in a hospital shooting rampage should be
executed, despite the defendant's dramatic courtroom pleas that he be
put to death.</LD>
<LD>   One juror said that after three days of deliberations, 10 members
of the panel supported a sentence of life in prison without parole
for Dung D. Trinh, while the remaining two backed a death sentence.</LD>
<LD>   Trinh, 46, was convicted on three counts of first-degree murder
and one count of attempted murder by the same jury last month after
three hours of deliberations. Trinh opened fire at West Anaheim
Medical Center on Sept. 14, 1999. Trinh, who blamed the hospital for
his mother's death, took the stand last week, pleading with the jury
to impose the death sentence. "I dare all of you to send me to
death," Trinh said. "I deserve it. I not only deserve it, I need it.
I want it."</LD>
<TE>   But juror Dorothy Hoffstatter of Huntington Beach said some on the
panel were not swayed by Trinh's comments. "We were not there to
please him," Hoffstatter said. "I did not think he deserved the death
penalty.... What he did was a coldblooded act, but I don't think he
did it coldbloodedly."</TE>
<TE>   Trinh armed himself heavily and entered the medical center bent on
avenging the death of his mother, who Trinh believed died because of
poor care by hospital employees, prosecutors said. Defense lawyers
did not deny that Trinh killed hospital maintenance director Ronald
Robertson, 50, nurse's aide Marlene Mustaffa, 60, and pharmacist
Vincent Rosetti, 50. But they argued that Trinh was suffering
emotional and physical breakdowns at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Trinh's 72-year-old mother, Mot, had died at another hospital the
morning of the shootings but had had her hip replaced at West Anaheim
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender Sharon Petrosino told jurors Trinh believed
West Anaheim Medical Center hastened her death by failing to provide
a Vietnamese translator. Because he was distraught over his mother's
death Trinh did not act out of evil intent and therefore did not
deserve the death penalty, Petrosino said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Bruce Moore told jurors, however, that Trinh acted in
cold blood, choosing his targets deliberately and firing.</TE>
<TE>   The defense and prosecution will meet before Judge John J. Ryan on
Sept. 12 to discuss selection of a new jury for the penalty phase.</TE>

death penalty during the first round of deliberations, they have the

<HD>Davis Flies Friendly Skies on Private Jets</HD>
<DH>Travel: He regularly uses flights provided by firms and
unions at reduced or no cost. Critics see a conflict of interest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY L. RABIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As he campaigns for reelection, Gov. Gray Davis regularly flies on
private jets provided by corporations and labor unions that do
business with the state and have a major interest in what happens in
Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   Their willingness to give Davis access to their planes--donations
worth thousands of dollars, for which the Davis campaign either pays
nothing or a nominal air fare--has allowed the governor to cover more
ground and to avoid security delays that have become commonplace at
airports during the last year.</LD>
<LD>   A review of the governor's campaign finance reports by The Times
for the last year and a half found that Davis flew on private planes
provided by 18 companies, unions or individuals. The reports show
that between Jan. 1, 2001, and June 30, 2002, the governor traveled
on planes provided by organized labor, water development firm Cadiz
Inc., construction contractor Tutor-Saliba Corp., drug maker Eli
Lilly &amp; Co. and troubled telecommunications firm Global Crossing
Ltd., among others.</LD>
<TE>   "It's hard to get around the state [on commercial airlines] if
you're doing a multi-city trip and not lose a lot of time at
airports," said Davis campaign spokesman Roger Salazar.</TE>
<TE>   Paying Coach Fares</TE>
<TE>   The governor's campaign committee paid only a fraction of the cost
for that travel--usually no more than the price of a commercial coach
airline ticket between the cities involved.</TE>
<TE>   For private plane flights between many points in California, the
amount paid by the Davis campaign was often equal to the price of a
ticket on Southwest Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign reports include only the nominal payment by the Davis
campaign to a corporation or union. The reports do not indicate the
date of travel or the route taken, and the campaign did not provide
that information despite requests from The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Davis campaign strategist Garry South said the state Fair
Political Practices Commission does not require candidates to
disclose the full value of flights on board private planes. Indeed, a
25-year-old opinion by the state's political watchdog agency says
candidates who use corporate airplanes need only report the cost of a
commercial airline ticket between the cities involved.</TE>
<TE>   South said donors often provide the planes in response to a
request from the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The low-cost private air transportation represents just one way
that well-heeled interests are helping Davis--and, to a much lesser
degree, Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr.--in the race
for governor of California. Such in-kind contributions come in many
forms, from Learjets to lavish receptions, vintage wines to
candlelight dinners. They can be as innocuous as buckets of paint or
as important as paying the salary of a top campaign strategist.
South's $15,000-a-month salary, for instance, is paid by the state
Democratic Party, relieving the Davis campaign of that expense.</TE>
<TE>   Although both candidates make use of in-kind contributions, Davis
has relied more heavily on cheap private flights, leading to
criticism from the Simon campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, the average citizen can't afford a flight on an
Air Davis plane," said Mark Miner, a spokesman for Simon. Miner
accused Davis of giving special treatment to the companies and
organizations that give him free or cheap transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar, however, denied that Davis gave anything in return for
those flights. Just because those companies or others have an
interest in state government does not mean that they expect special
treatment, he said. Anyone would be "hard-pressed to find any company
or entity that doesn't have business or interests in something to do
with the state of California," Salazar said.</TE>
<TE>   Like cash contributions in the race for the state's highest
office, there is no limit to how much can be given in so-called
nonmonetary contributions.</TE>
<TE>   And candidates sometimes manipulate the reported value of such
gifts, either to minimize the appearance of influence by a donor or
to intimidate rivals by making the campaign appear flush.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, when Davis was struggling against two well-financed
rivals in the Democratic primary, the then-lieutenant governor paid
nothing for most of his flights on private jets and instead reported
their full value as in-kind contributions from the donors who let him
use their planes. He continued that practice throughout the general
election campaign against Republican Dan Lungren.</TE>
<TE>   Davis reported the donations that way, South says now, because it
highlighted the fact that the campaign was receiving substantial
contributions at a time when Davis' ability to compete against
better-funded rivals was in question.</TE>
<TE>   But in the current campaign, Davis and his aides have taken the
opposite tack: Having raised more than $50 million since he was
elected governor, Davis now usually pays his own way on the flights,
but at rates far cheaper than the actual cost of those flights.</TE>
<TE>   During his first run for governor four years ago, Davis relied
heavily on a jet provided by Cadiz Inc., a Santa Monica-based firm
that is seeking to build a water storage project in the desert. The
Davis campaign reported the total value of those flights as
nonmonetary contributions worth almost $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Davis campaign has reported only a nominal payment
of more than $2,000 to Cadiz for the governor's occasional use of the
company's jet. As an example, Cadiz provided the company plane for a
round trip from Los Angeles to Lake Tahoe in 1999. The Davis campaign
paid only $265 for the governor's special transportation.</TE>
<TE>   The company's president, Keith Brackpool, is one of Davis' chief
advisors on water issues. Cadiz is pushing a project to store surplus
Colorado River water in an aquifer beneath the Mojave Desert for use
in dry years.</TE>
<TE>   Cadiz officials did not return repeated phone calls seeking
comment about why the company provides a corporate jet to the
governor.</TE>
<TE>   Another firm that often supplies planes to Davis is Tutor-Saliba
Corp., one of the nation's biggest construction companies.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Tutor, president of Tutor-Saliba, said the company jet has
been provided to Davis on two or three occasions for flights out of
Los Angeles to other cities in the state. The Davis campaign paid
Tutor-Saliba $1,049 for the flights.</TE>
<TE>   Tutor said the governor's office contacts his company and asks if
the jet is available. If so, Tutor said, "We let them use the plane."</TE>
<TE>   The Sylmar-based company was the largest contractor on the Los
Angeles subway project and Alameda Corridor linking the ports of Los
Angeles and Long Beach with railroad yards near downtown. The company
is currently working on major government contracts to upgrade the
Richmond-San Rafael Bridge and extend the Bay Area Rapid Transit
system to the San Francisco airport.</TE>
<TE>   But Tutor said he makes his plane available to Davis because he
appreciates the governor's work.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the governor," Tutor said. "I've known him for a long
time. He's done a great job as governor."</TE>
<TE>   Union Provided Plane</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the governor flew on a plane provided by the California
Correctional Peace Officers Assn., the union that represents state
prison guards. His campaign paid the union, one of Davis' biggest
financial backers, $976 for use of the plane.</TE>
<TE>   Davis signed legislation granting a multimillion-dollar pay raise
to members of the union, which last week endorsed his reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, Davis accepts private air transportation as a
nonmonetary contribution to his campaign, rather than paying the
nominal air fare. After election day in the March California primary,
for instance, unions representing state firefighters and the building
and construction trades joined to underwrite the cost of a plane to
shuttle Davis and other Democratic primary winners around the state.</TE>
<TE>   In that instance, the Davis campaign reported an in-kind
contribution of $13,000 for one day's air transportation.</TE>
<TE>   And Monday, when Davis took to the air for his traditional Labor
Day fly around California, one of the two jets in his entourage was
paid for by labor unions.</TE>
<TE>   All of those unions have a vital stake in what happens in
Sacramento--from bread-and-butter negotiations over salaries for
state workers to longer-term interests in pension issues, worker
safety and development policies.</TE>
<TE>   Although Davis is provided with private planes much more
frequently than Simon, the Republican candidate also has taken
advantage of the convenience.</TE>
<TE>   When Simon wanted to get maximum mileage out of an endorsement
from a law enforcement group in mid-June, for instance, the GOP
candidate and his entourage boarded a private jet in Van Nuys. For
two days, they crisscrossed the state, flying to Sacramento,
Bakersfield, San Diego, Fresno and Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   That trip cost $51,405, according to Simon's fund-raising reports,
and was paid for by Stockton developer Alex G. Spanos.</TE>
<TE>   One of the nation's biggest housing developers and owner of the
San Diego Chargers, Spanos hosted a Simon fund-raiser Aug. 23 at the
Stockton airport. President Bush was the special guest at that event.</TE>
<TE>   Spanos supported both Simon and former Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan during the long Republican primary campaign, providing both
cash contributions and free air transportation on his private plane.</TE>
<TE>   Simon has flown on donated planes several times since he won the
Republican nomination. The campaign reports the full value of the
flights as in-kind contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey P. Bennett, president of Nature's Recipe Pet Foods,
provided a plane to take Simon from Santa Monica to Apple Valley on
May 17.</TE>
<TE>   That in-kind contribution was valued at $4,396.</TE>
<TE>   Four days later, Simon flew from Santa Barbara to Sacramento on a
plane provided by Fidelity National Financial of Santa Barbara. The
firm covered the $2,375 tab for that journey.</TE>
<TE>   Miner, the Simon campaign spokesman, said in some cases the GOP
candidate may ask a supporter to provide a private jet. More often,
Miner said, Simon flies commercial airlines between the state's major
cities. And in some circumstances, the campaign may charter a plane
at its expense.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's an in-kind contribution of a private jet or a cash
contribution, campaign-finance expert Bob Stern said, "The average
voter should be concerned any time money is involved."</TE>
<TE>   Stern, president of the Los Angeles-based Center for Governmental
Studies, said travel on a corporate jet is appreciated by candidates
both for its monetary value and its convenience.</TE>
<TE>   "This is clearly a major contribution to the campaign," he said.
"This is worth a lot of money, and the candidates should pay for it,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the authors of the state's Watergate-era Political Reform
Act, Stern said he believes the Fair Political Practices Commission
needs to revisit the issue of requiring disclosure of the full value
of private air transportation.</TE>
<TE>   The FPPC noted in its 1977 opinion that public officials enjoy
"the intangible benefits that ordinarily accompany private air
service, such as the added comfort and convenience and avoiding the
aggravation that often attends commercial air travel." But the
commission did not and does not require those intangible benefits to
be reported. Only the fair market value of the travel must be
disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the Federal Election Commission requires that
federal officials, senators and members of Congress who fly on
corporate jets must report the equivalent of the first-class air
fare, rather than the coach fare, between the cities involved.</TE>
<TE>   If no commercial air service is available on the route, the FEC
requires candidates to report the full cost of a charter flight
between the points.</TE>
<TE>   Sigrid Bathen, spokeswoman for the FPPC, defended the state
agency's handling of the private air transportation issue.</TE>
<TE>   "The FPPC has for many years had very clear rules on the reporting
of air transportation that all candidates are expected to follow,"
she said. "Those rules still apply."</TE>

<HD>Who Are All You People Who Support a War Against Iraq?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Polls tell us there's a national passion for the United States to
take Iraq, and having been there once, I thought I might review the
highlights of my trip.</LD>
<LD>   I went in from the north in May of 1991. The Iraqi army was
supposed to have withdrawn from the area, or so I was told.</LD>
<LD>   Traveling with two photographers, I kept driving deeper into the
northern hills, which reminded me of California wine country. We were
in search of Saddam Hussein's summer palace because a crazy editor
thought it would be a good idea to see what the vacation home of a
madman looks like.</LD>
<TE>   Hussein's army had just been destroyed in the south, ending the
Gulf War. And now the coalition forces were ordering the Iraqis out
of the north, so the Kurdish refugees could return home.</TE>
<TE>   Two hours into the drive, we came around a bend and there it
was--a hilltop villa surrounded by a concrete wall. We parked at the
entrance, got out and discovered that some Iraqi soldiers had not
gotten the word to head south.</TE>
<TE>   They came at us slowly, with machine guns, and their leader asked
in English if we were with the CIA. Then he wanted to know what we
thought of Saddam Hussein and George Bush.</TE>
<TE>   I saw a bullet-pocked wall behind us and empty shell casings at
our feet, so I gave the answers the Iraqis wanted to hear: Saddam
good. Bush bad.</TE>
<TE>   They led us into a trailer and offered tea. One soldier took a
photo of Saddam off the wall, kissed it and passed it around for
others to do the same. They talked of all the Iraqis killed by
Americans and of how much they hated the Kurds. I thought, for a
moment, that we might never leave the trailer.</TE>
<TE>   But then the encounter turned surreal. Saddam's army wanted to
talk about Madonna and Michael Jackson. They were torn between
Saddam's party line and their natural curiosity about America.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to go to Hollywood," said one soldier before they all
finally led us outside and waved goodbye, as if we were tourists
who'd taken a wrong turn.</TE>
<TE>   If the experience helped clarify anything for me, it was the idea
of war as puppetry. I would later find much the same in Bosnia, where
Muslims and Serbs who'd lived in peace were turned against each other
to advance the political survival of despots trading in hatred and
caricature.</TE>
<TE>   This is not to say war isn't sometimes necessary, but that we
ought to, with every fiber of our humanity and every democratic
right, challenge the motives and claims of saber-rattling puppeteers
before sending our sons and sisters off to die.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, 11 years after America's first tour of Iraq, The Times
Poll finds a nation eager to go to war, if not kiss a photo of the
commander-in-chief.</TE>
<TE>   Why? Because we're having our strings pulled by the White House in
a propaganda campaign that would impress Saddam. He is evil, we are
told, and we've got to take him out now. If not for our own safety,
then for the sake of a free and democratic Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Let me say without hesitation that if President Bush could prove
Hussein had any connection to Al Qaeda and Sept. 11, war would make
perfect sense.</TE>
<TE>   If we had the vaguest notion who might take over when Saddam is
gone, sure.</TE>
<TE>   If we knew for sure he is capable of blowing up the world, let's
go get him.</TE>
<TE>   If there were any reason to believe war on Iraq might stabilize
the Middle East and diminish, rather than increase, the threat of
terrorist attacks on the U.S., sign me up.</TE>
<TE>   But guess what, folks. There is none of that.</TE>
<TE>   And still, nearly two-thirds of the 1,372 adults polled nationwide
say they would support a ground attack on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Who are you people?</TE>
<TE>   Are you the same ones I see going into the Olive Garden?</TE>
<TE>   Are you the audience CBS and Fox had in mind when they dreamed up
reality TV shows based on "The Beverly Hillbillies" and "Green
Acres"?</TE>
<TE>   Until we can figure out a way to conduct polls that make us look
smarter, we ought to ban them altogether. I don't know about you, but
I'm always dying to ask follow-up questions to the ones you see in
polls.</TE>
<TE>   For instance: You seem to really have it in for Iraq. Do you have
any idea that Saudi Arabia, not Iraq, is where most of the Sept. 11
terrorists came from?</TE>
<TE>   Does it concern you even a little that the two biggest
cheerleaders for war--President Bush and Vice President Dick
Cheney--didn't fight themselves when they had the chance?</TE>
<TE>   Are you willing to lose a loved one to free Iraq?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not. I did notice that while 64% want a ground attack, only
45% would stick to their guns if a lot of blood was spilled. We want
what we want, but not if it involves sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   One saving grace is that 61% of those who want a war said we
should only start one if other countries back us up. But there is no
backup, and some folks in the rest of the world seem to think we're
the madmen now.</TE>

<HD>Unity Day Strikes Note of Discord</HD>
<DH>Politics: A Sept. 11 memorial widens rift among Mission
Viejo City Council members. But sponsors say it wasn't intentional.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a city beset by bitter political divisions, even the best of
intentions can spark a conflagration. Such is the case in Mission
Viejo, where a planned "day of unity" commemorating Sept. 11 has
resulted in anything but.</LD>
<LD>   The rhetoric and conspiracy theories started spreading soon after
residents began receiving fliers in the mail announcing the
interfaith "day of unity and prayer," including a candlelight vigil,
to be held Monday at a local Islamic mosque.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is that not every City Council member's name was
listed on the announcement as supporting the event.</LD>
<TE>   "It's incomprehensible," Councilwoman Gail Reavis said. "It's
unity day, come on--wouldn't you want to show people that you are a
unified City Council?"</TE>
<TE>   Reavis is one of the two council members whose names didn't appear
under the portion of the flier indicating that the event was to be
"presented by" the city of Mission Viejo and listing the names of
Mayor Susan Withrow, Mayor Pro-Tem Sherri M. Butterfield and former
Mayor William S. Craycraft. They make up the council's voting
majority on most issues.</TE>
<TE>   Also absent was the name of Councilman John Paul Ledesma, who
usually joins Reavis in opposing the majority bloc. Ledesma, in fact,
is running for reelection--along with Withrow and Butterfield--on
Nov. 5. He could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "I never got an invitation," Reavis said. "We have a bitterly
divided City Council with 64 days before the election. We also have a
very large Muslim community here with a mosque whose members got
fliers saying that this event is sponsored by the city but listing
only three council members.</TE>
<TE>   "The implication is that we don't support the mosque or the Muslim
community," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She doesn't blame the mosque, Reavis said, but the council
majority, which "operates on a need-to-know basis--they don't like
telling us things. We were just never told."</TE>
<TE>   Withrow denies withholding information on the vigil.</TE>
<TE>   "All I know is that I got an e-mail inviting me to attend," she
said, "and I agreed. I've been invited to lots of these events. I
have no idea who else was or wasn't invited and I have no control
over that."</TE>
<TE>   She said that the city isn't sponsoring the event, despite what
the flier says.</TE>
<TE>   "That's wrong," Withrow said. "My guess is that it was just an
innocent mistake. They probably think that because city officials are
attending they can say it's a city function."</TE>
<TE>   But Mohannad Malas, a spokesman for the Orange County Islamic
Foundation--which sent out the invitations and fliers and runs the
Mission Viejo Masjid where the vigil is to be held--said no mistake
was made.</TE>
<TE>   The event was described as "presented by" the city, he said,
because it will open with a welcome from Withrow. She and Butterfield
were invited, he said, as the city's mayor and mayor pro-tem. And
Craycraft's name was added to the list, Malas said, because he was
the city's mayor on Sept. 11, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of our people were under extreme pressure at that time,"
Malas said, "and we worked with him during a very tough period. We
have invited representatives from several other cities as well, but
only the mayors and mayors pro-tem."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, though, Malas and his foundation colleagues were
working to mend fences.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a day of showing unity and remembrance for the victims of
Sept. 11," he said. "We're not excluding anybody."</TE>
<TE>   To drive that point home, he said, mosque representatives attended
Tuesday night's Mission Viejo City Council meeting and handed the two
overlooked council members written invitations to next week's
commemoration.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to do what we can to appease," Malas said. "We want
to create a day of unity, not a day of bad feelings."</TE>

<LD>Two men whose bodies were found in a burning sport utility vehicle in
Studio City were good-natured buddies who bonded over their passion
for racing motorcycles, friends and colleagues said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The bodies of Christopher Monson, 31, of Culver City and Michael
Tardio, 35, of Los Angeles were discovered Monday morning in the
11600 block of Woodbridge Street by firefighters responding to a
call. The men, each of them shot in the torso, were in a black
Mercedes that one of them had rented in West Hollywood on Saturday,
authorities said. Police believe both men were killed in the car
while it was on Woodbridge Street, said LAPD police spokesman Jason
Lee.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators also believe the fire was set by the assailant or
assailants in an attempt to cover up the shootings, Lee said.</LD>
<TE>   Detectives from the Los Angeles Police Department's North
Hollywood Division had not arrested any suspects Tuesday, Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and relatives said they had no idea why anyone would shoot
either man.</TE>
<TE>   "He did like to live life on the edge--he raced motorcycles, you
know," said David Judaken, owner of the Garden of Eden nightclub,
where Tardio worked as a bouncer. "And he always took it as far as he
could go. But I don't know what he could have been involved in. He
was a very stand-up guy."</TE>
<TE>   Like Tardio, Monson often raced motorcycles at the Willow Springs
Motorcycle Club in Rosamond, said his friend, David Osokow.</TE>
<TE>   Monson's father, also named Chris Monson, said his son ran several
family-owned self-storage facilities in Arizona and California.</TE>
<TE>   "He loved life," said Monson, who arrived in Los Angeles on
Tuesday from his home in Arizona. "He was a great family member and a
great friend."</TE>

<HD>House Made of Trash Is Seen as Eyesore and Tourist
Attraction</HD>
<DH>Landmark: The site in Cambria is a state- recognized 'folk
art environment,' but some neighbors hate it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLY ANN CONNELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Tucked away in this exclusive coastal enclave where redwood decks,
vaulted ceilings and skylights seem standard features for most homes,
there remains a sprawling folk art compound made entirely out of
junk.</LD>
<LD>   Nitt Witt Ridge has always rubbed a large number of people the
wrong way here at the north end of San Luis Obispo County. Animosity
toward the poor man's castle built from abalone shells, toilet seats,
children's toys, artillery shells and more, was strong when its
creator, the eccentric Art Beal, was alive.</LD>
<LD>   But now some of the neighbors are getting rankled all over again,
as the new owners carry out an increasingly aggressive plan to make
Nitt Witt Ridge a stopping point for coastal travelers.</LD>
<TE>   Stacey and Michael O'Malley, former residents of Los Alamitos who
purchased Nitt Witt Ridge in 1999, have had to maneuver delicately
around the shoals of public concern, as they promote private
appointment-only tours at the site.</TE>
<TE>   The couple must proceed cautiously because the property was judged
unsuitable for a public park and is not zoned for business. It's too
close to neighbors' homes, with not enough parking, and was
manufactured of such an unstable hodgepodge of materials that the
safety of visitors could not be assured by the county.</TE>
<TE>   So the O'Malleys have tried to open their property--a state
historic landmark--on a modest scale to visitors who call ahead. They
make a little money from donations and by selling T-shirts and
postcards. The tours avoid county restrictions because they are
considered unpaid tours of private property.</TE>
<TE>   But the owners also must answer complaints about traffic along the
steep slope of Hillcrest Drive, even though the closest neighbors
admit few of the looky-loos ever get out of their cars. And the
couple have opened a downtown Cambria office, after protests that
they were accepting money on-site and violating zoning rules.</TE>
<TE>   "It's costing us $500 a month in rent downtown just to see any
money out of this," said Michael O'Malley.</TE>
<TE>   Critics expressed more displeasure over the more public profile of
Nitt Witt Ridge after the state installed a sign on California 1
giving directions to the landmark. The sign was soon cut down by
unknown vandals. It has been reinstalled, and visitors to Cambria can
now follow the state landmark signs to the site.</TE>
<TE>   And complaints were heard when the O'Malleys briefly specified a
suggested donation--$5 for kids and $10 for adults--that some saw as
an invasion of commerce into a residential area.</TE>
<TE>   But the O'Malleys have also attracted supporters. A neighbor sold
them the home directly above Nitt Witt Ridge, for less than market
value, so the couple could move out of the pop-up tent trailer, where
they had lived with their son and daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "We were able to refinance and pay for what we've done here,"
O'Malley said. "We think of it as Beal sort of taking care of us so
we could take care of his dream."</TE>
<TE>   The opposition to Nitt Witt Ridge is well-established, many
relatively old-timers note, dating back to the days when the
cantankerous Beal was seen around town in his blue bathrobe.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime Collector</TE>
<TE>   Beal, an iconoclastic jack-of-all-trades, collected garbage in
Cambria for many years. He built Nitt Witt Ridge with the junk that
he hauled to the property from the 1930s through the '50s.</TE>
<TE>   He picked the best of the trash to use in his walls and building.
There are pillars made of car rims that were filled with concrete and
then covered with rocks and abalone shells. A fountain on the highest
terrace was made from a succession of sinks and a bathtub.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed Nitwit Ridge by locals decades ago, Beal took to calling
himself Capt. Nitt Witt in his later years. He lived on the site from
1928 until 1989, when he was placed in a Morro Bay nursing home. He
managed to escape once to hitchhike back to Nitt Witt Ridge. By the
time died in 1992 at age 96, he had been interviewed by journalists
from around the world.</TE>
<TE>   But what was appreciated by out-of-towners didn't always warm
hearts closer to home.</TE>
<TE>   "It probably has to do with a basic aspect of folk art," said
Kathe Tanner, a member of the Cambria Historical Society and a writer
for the Cambrian newspaper. "It would be wonderful to drive somewhere
and look at it, but people don't really want to see it at 7:30 a.m.
each day when they get up to get their newspaper."</TE>
<TE>   Since their purchase in 1999, the O'Malleys have cleaned up the
site dramatically. O'Malley stresses they've tried to do nothing to
harm Nitt Witt Ridge's quirky individuality. They've cleaned out the
terraced gardens where beer cans and lightbulbs are built into the
stone fences and stuck stones back into the walls above the concrete
deer that guards the entrance.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the house, the original canned goods left behind by Beal
have been put back on shelves. A kitchen cabinet built out of an old
radio is still there. Beal's coats hang neatly in the closet.</TE>
<TE>   O'Malley never met Beal. He and his wife had decided to move out
of the Los Angeles area, and they encountered Nitt Witt Ridge by
accident when looking for places to buy in the Cambria area. Now,
O'Malley's tours are delivered in a rapid-fire cadence full of Beal
trivia.</TE>
<TE>   The closest neighbors are thrilled with what the O'Malleys have
done. Charlotte and Ken MacLean knew Beal for almost 20 years.</TE>
<TE>"They've restored the walkways. They've put on a roof. They repaired
the windows. I didn't think that two people could do that much work,"
said Charlotte MacLean.</TE>
<TE>   "Granted, even when Art was alive, there were people who wanted to
see this place just slide off the hill," said MacLean, as she walked
through her own private entrance into one of the gardens at Nitt Witt
Ridge. "People in this town were offended by him. But that's part of
being an eccentric."</TE>
<TE>   Recognized as Folk Art</TE>
<TE>Steve McMasters, an environmental planner with the county, said his
agency is responsible for making sure that any improvements made at
Nitt Witt Ridge are historically accurate. The 2.5-acre property is a
state-recognized "folk art environment," in the same category as the
Watts Towers and Grandma Prisbey's Bottle Village in Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   McMasters said most contact between county officials and the
O'Malleys has been over worries from neighbors that a business is
being established in a residential neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   In a very good week, O'Malley shows 100 people through the site.
He is carrying a $4-million liability policy at the county's
insistence.</TE>
<TE>   He says the whole effort has been financially draining. He tries
to sell postcards for up to $10, and T-shirts for up to $25 out of
the downtown office. There is no mandatory fee for the tour, although
the O'Malleys have joined the Cambria Chamber of Commerce so visitors
can learn more about their tours.</TE>
<TE>   Competing With Hearst</TE>
<TE>   In an area that bills itself as Castle Country, a staging ground
for tourists bound for nearby Hearst Castle, Beal's creation often
becomes a secondary attraction.</TE>
<TE>   "I know this sounds like I'm blowing hot air, but they always say
they like this more," O'Malley said of the tourists who come to Nitt
Witt Ridge. "They get some sense of what [Beal] was actually like."</TE>
<TE>   Beal was the son of a Klamath River Indian woman and an Irishman.
His mother died in the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, and he never
knew his father. At various stages of his life, he was a
long-distance swimmer, a plumber and an abalone diver. He never
married.</TE>
<TE>O'Malley found a letter on the property in which Beal asked the U.S.
Patent Office to patent his "human torch" act, in which Beal would
set his skin on fire.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Guy Wilson, a professor of architectural history at the
University of Virginia who has studied folk art environments, said
places like Nitt Witt Ridge are difficult to categorize.</TE>
<TE>   "When you say folk art, you are implying it's somehow from the
common man," he said in a telephone interview. "Aren't these
individuals transcending that?"</TE>
<TE>   MacLean said Michael O'Malley has been able to keep Nitt Witt
Ridge alive for the public in a way the county and state could not.</TE>
<TE>   "I get the feeling Michael is a soul mate of Capt. Nitt Witt,"
MacLean said. "He really feels a need to maintain his dream."</TE>

<HD>Union Targets Nurses</HD>
<DH>Labor: Petition is filed with federal board to organize
1,800 RNs at Cedars-Sinai.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Nurses Assn. filed a petition with a federal labor
board Tuesday seeking to unionize registered nurses at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, one of the largest hospitals in the West.</LD>
<LD>   If the 1,800 nurses at the Los Angeles hospital vote to join the
union, it would be the union's largest organizing victory in years.
Last fall, more than 1,300 nurses at Long Beach Memorial Medical
Center voted for CNA representation.</LD>
<LD>   An election at Cedars-Sinai could be held as soon as 30 days if
the National Labor Relations Board certifies the union's petition.</LD>
<TE>   "It's pretty historic, actually, when you think about it," said
Rose Ann DeMoro, executive director of the union, which represents
about 45,000 nurses statewide.</TE>
<TE>   Cedars-Sinai Vice President Grace Cheng said the hospital "will be
working to ensure that our staff has the facts that they need to make
an informed choice." She could not provide more specifics because the
hospital only learned of the union petition late Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "While we respect the employees' legal right to join a union if
they so choose, our preference is to continue to deal directly with
our employees," Cheng said.</TE>
<TE>   One longtime Cedars-Sinai nurse said she supports unionization
because of the gains that the union has achieved at other hospitals.
Eva Buenconsejo, who works in the hospital's intensive-care unit,
said she and her colleagues want to negotiate such issues as limits
to mandatory overtime, nurse-to-patient ratios, richer retirement
benefits and seniority-based raises</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Cedars-Sinai overlooked nurses or mistreated them,
Buenconsejo said, "They're really not ignoring us, but we'd just feel
better with this protection, with collective bargaining."</TE>
<TE>   This spring, the union won major concessions after threatening a
strike at the University of California's five medical centers. Under
the accord, which covered the system's 8,000 nurses, UC will pay
nurses based on seniority and boost salaries an average of 19% to 25%
over the next three years.</TE>

<HD>Neighborhood Whistle-Blower Tries to Halt Noise Problem in
Laguna Beach</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>You think you have problems. The Laguna News-Post reported that a
neighbor called police to complain of "continued noise problems"
coming from the swim team's practices in the school pool, including
loud yelling and whistle-blowing.</LD>
<LD>   Food for thought:</LD>
<LD>   Today's specials include:</LD>
<TE>   * A brawny offering that is tinted a color once associated with
TV's "Incredible Hulk" (Judy Goodstein of L.A.)</TE>
<TE>   * A modest fish dish that caused Art Vinsel of San Pedro to ask:
"If it's too hot, do they market them nude?"</TE>
<TE>   * A zoo with commoners' food only (photo by Susan Avallon of L.A.)</TE>
<TE>   * And, finally, a property listing that cut off the words
"Latter-day Saints," spotted by real estate agent Greg Bayer. His
colleague, Dennis Berry, said, "It wasn't for someone in Seattle
either."</TE>
<TE>   Dorms, God and booze: The Princeton Review's survey of 345
universities came up with these findings about local schools:</TE>
<TE>   * UCLA: Ranked seventh in the "dorms like dungeons" category (or
338th best, depending on how you look at it).</TE>
<TE>   * Pomona: No. 16 on "dorms like palaces" list. Pomona, not
surprisingly, also ranks second in the nation for "happiest
students."</TE>
<TE>   * Pepperdine: No. 18 in number of students who pray regularly (not
just during finals week).</TE>
<TE>   * Caltech: No. 11 in number of students who "ignore God on a
regular basis."</TE>
<TE>   * UC San Diego: No. 12 in number of students who "ignore hard
liquor on a regular basis." Pepperdine is No. 16.</TE>
<TE>   Are you talking to me? An Acton resident was called away from
dinner recently by a phone call from Robert De Niro. But it wasn't
the actor--it was a Dell computer techie walking her through a
problem from his office in Bangalore, India.</TE>
<TE>   In this era of satellites and the Internet, Dell is one of several
companies that farm out support services to lower-paid workers in
India. And the name De Niro?</TE>
<TE>   The techie explained that the Indian support personnel are
encouraged to use American names to create a more familiar presence
for customers. Obviously, he thought De Niro was more catchy than Bob
Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Bird's-eye view: Attending USC's football opener against Auburn on
Monday night, I quickly spotted the quickest and most determined
creatures on the field.</TE>
<TE>   They were three pigeons who were eating seeds near the
20-yard-line at the west end of the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   They refused to leave when the game began, casually darting out of
the way when humans came stomping through their turf, then returning
to their meals.</TE>
<TE>   I thought I saw one forward pass come close to hitting one of the
birds, who seemed unfazed.</TE>
<TE>   However, when a short fireworks show began at halftime, they flew
off and didn't return for the third quarter. A few more explosions
and I would have followed them.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Soon after a baseball strike was averted, the
Republicans and Democrats in the Legislature ended the deadlock over
the new budget.</TE>
<TE>   It got me to thinking. The baseball players we need. But why
couldn't the legislators go on strike once in a while?</TE>

<HD>Hillside Housing Measure in Ventura Will Stay on Ballot,
Court Declares</HD>
<DH>Land: Judge rejects arguments that initiative seeking
voters' approval to build 1,390 homes violates state law. Debate is
now expected to shift to the political arena.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An initiative seeking voter approval to build 1,390 homes on the
scrub-covered hillsides overlooking Ventura will remain on the
November ballot, a Ventura County judge ruled Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Henry Walsh rejected arguments that Measure A
should be pulled from the ballot because it represents a violation of
a state law that prohibits citizen-sponsored ballot measures from
benefiting private corporations.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of the measure, also known as the Open 80 Master Plan
Act, contend the purpose of the law is to prevent private
profiteering through the initiative process.</LD>
<TE>   But Walsh ruled the language of the section of the California
Constitution cited by the opponents refers specifically to
corporations--not limited partnerships--and therefore does not apply
to the group of landowners backing the measure.</TE>
<TE>   "The language of the constitution limits the proscription against
private interests to corporations," Walsh wrote in a three-page
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "If the legislature or the electorate wishes to make that
proscription more inclusive, they clearly have the power to do so,"
he continued. "The existing language, however, is limited to
corporations."</TE>
<TE>   Also, Walsh said Ventura voters approved a ballot measure last
year requiring public participation in decisions relating to hillside
development. By approving last year's Measure P, he wrote, the
electorate clearly stated its desire to be included in the
decision-making process.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh concluded by stating that his ruling should not be construed
as a position in favor of or against the Open 80 plan.</TE>
<TE>   "That decision," he wrote, "is one for the electorate, and more
specifically, for each individual voter."</TE>
<TE>   Over the past decade, residents in nearly every Ventura County
city have approved strict growth-control laws aimed at curbing urban
expansion onto farmland and open space. The laws require a majority
vote to approve projects outside urban boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Debate over the Open 80 initiative is now expected to shift from
the courtroom to the political arena.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard attorney Richard Francis said the slow-growth group that
sued to remove the measure from the ballot, SOAR Inc., won't file an
appeal to Walsh's ruling because election officials have already
begun to print ballots.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they will turn their attention to defeating the
initiative at the polls.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not only a legally flawed initiative," Francis said, "it is
a politically flawed initiative--in that it asks voters to make a
decision without giving them information on which to make that
decision."</TE>
<TE>   Under the Open 80 plan, six residential tracts would be built on
730 acres of undeveloped grazing land north of Ventura while 3,050
acres--about 80% of the property--would be preserved as open space.
The plan also calls for 32 acres of new parkland, 25 miles of public
trails and some commercial development.</TE>

<HD>El Rio Recreation Program to Close</HD>
<DH>Youths: Sheriff's league runs out of money for after-school
and summer activities at the new community gym.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An after-school and summer program in El Rio is shutting its doors
because the cash-strapped Ventura County Sheriff's Department cannot
afford to keep it afloat.</LD>
<LD>   The Police Activities League in El Rio served about 250 children
at the community's new gym but ran out of money Sunday, two days
before the start of classes in the rural town near Oxnard, Cmdr.
Marty Rouse said.</LD>
<LD>   Soledad Trevino, a Nyeland Acres resident who sits on the
12-member league board, said that losing the popular program will
hurt the entire community.</LD>
<TE>   "We have a high gang rate in this particular area, so this is
going to be a hard blow," Trevino said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   As the Sheriff's Department tries to trim about $3 million from
its budget this year, it also plans to cut a community policing
officer in Piru, a technician in Saticoy and the DARE anti-drug
program in unincorporated areas of western Ventura County and Ojai,
Rouse said. The DARE cuts will affect about five schools.</TE>
<TE>   Although county Supervisor John Flynn, who represents El Rio,
agreed to pay half the $100,000 cost of the Police Activities League,
the Sheriff's Department could not afford to pick up the remainder,
Rouse said.</TE>
<TE>   The league was the only organization to offer after-school and
summer activities in the new $3-million gymnasium. It organized youth
sports leagues, dances and field trips, paid for by the Sheriff's
Department, the Rio Elementary School District and a three-year state
grant.</TE>
<TE>   The state grant ended this year, and the Sheriff's Department and
school district are facing budget shortfalls.</TE>
<TE>   Trevino and several other community members expressed frustration
a year ago because the gym sat idle most of the time as county and
Rio school district officials quarreled about which agency was
responsible for managing recreation programs. Then the Police
Activities League stepped in, attracting as many as 150 young people
a day to the community gym after school.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department will keep the gym open with an officer
for another week or two while Flynn's office and sheriff's officials
try to work out a solution, Rouse said.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn, who is out of the country until Sept. 16, will meet with
Sheriff Bob Brooks when he returns, said Elizabeth Montijo, an
administrative aide to the supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   "Children really enjoyed PAL, and we want to keep it," Montijo
said. "If the funds aren't available, we have to look at something
else."</TE>

<HD>Parole Official Demoted After Complaints</HD>
<DH>Personnel: Attorneys for inmates accused former vice
chairman of state board of inappropriate comments and behavior during
hearings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The vice chairman of the state parole board has been demoted after a
string of attorneys complained that his behavior toward them and
their inmate clients has been demeaning and inappropriate.</LD>
<LD>   In one instance, Board of Prison Terms Commissioner Jones Moore
told a female attorney who remarked on the heat that she was probably
having "a personal problem"--which she interpreted as a reference to
hot flashes.</LD>
<LD>   That and other episodes have led to "an unacceptable number of
complaints" against Moore, board Chairwoman Carol Daly said in a
document obtained by The Times. Although Daly said not all the
complaints were valid, she added that Moore's conduct has had "a
deleterious effect" on the board.</LD>
<TE>   Her comments came in an Aug. 27 letter to state Senate leader John
Burton (D-San Francisco), who inquired about Moore after receiving
complaints about the commissioner's behavior during inmate parole
hearings. Daly told Burton she was demoting Moore in part because he
had developed a "reputation as having an arrogant demeanor and
questionable work ethic."</TE>
<TE>   Although Moore--appointed by Gov. Gray Davis last year--will
remain on the board, Daly said in the letter that she would "take
appropriate action" if his behavior warranted it.</TE>
<TE>   Reached by telephone Tuesday, Daly called the complaints a
personnel issue and declined to comment beyond saying, "Commissioner
Moore is a hard worker and is doing a good job."</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to reach Moore were unsuccessful. But in her letter, Daly
said he "clearly does not acknowledge conduct rising to a level of
concern."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Burton called Moore's behavior "totally
unacceptable" and added, "Hopefully he'll learn from his mistakes and
be a little bit more sensitive from now on."</TE>
<TE>   The first complaint The Times learned of involved an episode in
January, when attorney Stephen Pearcy was representing an inmate
before Moore and a deputy commissioner at the state prison in Tracy.
Pearcy said that as he was telling the commissioner why his client
should be paroled after 23 years behind bars, Moore was reading files
on other inmates with hearings later that day.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a juror reading a newspaper while you're making your
core legal argument in court," Pearcy said in an interview. "My
client was entitled to a meaningful hearing by people who were
actually listening--or at least appeared to be listening. And that's
not what he got."</TE>
<TE>   A transcript of the hearing shows that Pearcy objected to Moore's
behavior and that Moore responded, "I have ... five other cases to
deal with today." Moore also insisted that he was "listening to every
word you have to say" and had not, as Pearcy argued, already made up
his mind about the case.</TE>
<TE>   The inmate was denied parole that day, prompting his lawyer to
file an appeal with the board, whose appeals unit confirmed that
Moore had been reviewing another inmate's file but said that had no
bearing on the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Another episode, in June, involved a female lawyer representing an
inmate at Folsom State Prison. According to documents obtained by The
Times, the attorney observed that the hearing room was hot and
stuffy.</TE>
<TE>   That prompted Moore to remark, "That sounds like a personal
problem." Moore's comment infuriated Marcia Huff, who was sitting in
on the hearing and was the victim of the inmate seeking parole. Huff
wrote to Daly, saying she found Moore's "body language, as well as
verbal comments, to be arrogant and degrading." Huff said she was
"appalled" when Moore called attorneys "mouthpieces," rolled his eyes
during the hearing and noisily slurped water from a bottle.</TE>
<TE>   In her letter to Burton, Daly said that Moore "acted
inappropriately" during that hearing and that he had since apologized
to the attorney.</TE>
<TE>   A third complaint was filed by a San Francisco lawyer representing
two female inmates at hearings in June. In a letter to Daly, the
lawyer, Edwin Caldwell, said Moore opened the hearing for Judy Bell
by saying, "Here we have the drug baby"--an apparent reference to the
fact that Bell was an addict born with fetal alcohol syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the hearing, Caldwell said, his client began weeping when
Moore spoke harshly to her. In response, Caldwell said in his
complaint, Moore told her, "Knock off those tears. They are not going
to get you anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Caldwell called Moore "condescending and
mean-spirited. It's very devastating to women who have waited forever
to get these hearings."</TE>
<TE>   Moore's term expires in 2004. Before his appointment, he was an
executive with the state prison guards union.</TE>

<HD>Is Golf a Suitable Lesson for Kids?</HD>

<LD>When Tiger Woods was 20 and not yet an international phenomenon--in
fact, he had not played his first full year on the PGA Tour--I
predicted in print he'd become a superstar who in time would leave a
large imprint on society.</LD>
<LD>   It was a hunch bet, but I foresaw a Tiger Woods who would pick his
spots and speak out on social issues. And do so with credibility.</LD>
<LD>   Little did I suspect the Woods legacy would involve turning every
living American into a golfer.</LD>
<TE>   While avoiding the spotlight on some of the big-ticket topics of
the day--including even golf-related subjects such as whether a
physically disadvantaged PGA player deserves a cart or whether women
should be admitted at all-male golf clubs--Tiger, now 26, has zeroed
in on leading underprivileged inner-city kids to the wonders of
playing golf.</TE>
<TE>   An interesting choice. Is it really a good idea to expand the
numbers of frustrated Americans who can't cure the shanks or get out
of a sand trap? Is getting a good tee time one of the fixes to what's
wrong with inner-city youngsters? Does playing golf improve a person
or merely point out their most significant character traits?</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, Woods is on a mission to find out.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County-based Tiger Woods Foundation wants to build a
$25-million education center where underprivileged youngsters would
have access to computers and academic tutoring--and then step outside
to practice their putting or whack some drives at the range.</TE>
<TE>   One of the potential sites, according to the foundation, is the
Dad Miller Golf Course in Anaheim, not far from where Tiger grew up
in Cypress. The course would remain, but some consideration has been
given to using the adjacent driving range for the proposed
education/golf center.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation's executive director said last week the idea is to
"introduce the game of golf to kids who otherwise wouldn't have an
opportunity to play."</TE>
<TE>   As a lifelong golfer, I'm compelled to say that that seems like a
rather cruel thing to do to a young person.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, it continues a pattern Woods established several years ago.
Since 1997, he has given a number of clinics around the country to
inner-city youngsters. The standard format, according to published
reports, is that the kids get some tips on real-life things like
interviewing for jobs and getting an education, but the focus is on
golf.</TE>
<TE>   I realize Woods plays golf and wouldn't be expected to give tips
on how to hit a curve ball or build a house, but the linkage between
beating the odds poverty imposes and playing golf is in the eye of
the beholder. I'd bet that an hour-long lecture from Tiger to a group
of kids in which he never mentioned golf would be just as
inspirational.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger and his father, Earl Woods, disagree.</TE>
<TE>   "The game itself teaches kids about life," Earl Woods told an
interviewer in 2000. "What we want to do is improve these kids'
chances in life. They learn how to handle success, failure, integrity
and patience."</TE>
<TE>   I've played hundreds of rounds of golf over the years and never
learned a thing, except that greens fees are way too high. Besides,
golf doesn't teach you to be honest; you either count your strokes or
you don't. Sitting at innumerable tee boxes over the years, waiting
for the group ahead to get moving, didn't teach me patience; it
merely highlighted my lack of it.</TE>
<TE>   But if Tiger thinks access to golf courses will help
underprivileged children lead exemplary lives, more power to him. I'd
simply remind him that the favorite game of America's corporate
executives is ... well, let's not belabor the point.</TE>
<TE>   My misgivings aside, I'm not junking my Tiger Woods prediction of
several years ago.</TE>
<TE>   I remain confident that once every single one of us has played at
least one round of golf, the Tiger Man will direct his charm,
influence and passion to other, larger causes.</TE>

<HD>Manuel Flamarique, 75; Promoted Bullfighting in Spain,
Latin America</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Manuel Martinez Flamarique, 75, one of Spain's top bullfighting
promoters, died Monday of a neurological disease in the seaside city
of San Sebastian.</LD>
<LD>   Born into a family of bullfighting impresarios, Martinez earned a
chemical engineering degree from the French University of Toulouse.
But the death of his father, Pablo Martinez, in 1968 caused him to
switch careers and take over the family business.</LD>
<LD>   His firm was called Chopera. and his nickname in the bullfighting
world was Manolo Chopera. The word "chopera" is slang for "a glass of
wine."</LD>
<TE>   Martinez hit his promotional peak in 1981 when he took over
management of Las Ventas stadium in Madrid. He managed top
bullfighting rings throughout Spain as well as venues in Mexico,
Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and the Basque areas of France and promoted
the careers of many leading matadors.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>George Porter, 81, who shared the 1967 Nobel Prize for chemistry for
his work on light-driven chemical reactions, died Saturday in London
of undisclosed causes.</LD>
<LD>   Porter shared the chemistry prize with his mentor, R.G.W. Norrish
of Cambridge University and Manfred Eigen of the Max Planck Institute
in Germany. Eigen received half the prize and Porter and Norrish a
quarter each.</LD>
<LD>   Working under Norrish, Porter used extremely short pulses of light
in a device he built to study gaseous free radicals and combustion.
One of the practical applications has been the development of ways to
stop dyes from fading.</LD>
<TE>   Porter was knighted in 1972 and elevated to the House of Lords in
1990. He also worked with Norrish to develop a technique known as
flash photolysis, allowing short-lived molecular fragments to be
identified by spectrophotometry.</TE>

<HD>At Hollywood and Highland, All the Sidewalk's a Stage</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Street performers are drawing crowds at the
complex, creating a lively scene that occasionally spills off the
curb into traffic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The latest attraction at the ritzy new $615-million shopping and
entertainment complex at Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue
isn't in the stores.</LD>
<LD>   It's out on the sidewalk.</LD>
<LD>   There are groups of break dancers, whose choreographed routines
draw large crowds that block the sidewalk on Hollywood. There are
magicians, mimes, clowns, tarot card readers and others who offer
entertainment for donations.</LD>
<TE>   And there's the motionless Mercury Man, a silvery costumed living
statue, who specializes in doing, well, nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Audiences drawn to the performers have grown so large, police say,
that the sidewalk sometimes ends up getting blocked on weekend
nights. Some pedestrians are forced onto the busy boulevard, just to
get by.</TE>
<TE>   But some say that's part of the price for the popular sidewalk
spectacle that has surfaced at Hollywood and Highland since the
complex opened last November.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, this is Hollywood," said a tourist, Amy Johnson, who was
visiting recently with her husband and two toddlers from Oregon City,
Ore. "Performers, the stars' plaques on the sidewalk, the footprints
at Grauman's [Chinese Theatre]. I love it."</TE>
<TE>   Her husband Bruce agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "The crowds, the people performing ... that's why we came to visit
Hollywood," he said. "We'll tell our friends to come here. This is
fun."</TE>
<TE>   Street performers are commonplace at some of the most popular
shopping districts in Southern California: the Third Street Promenade
in Santa Monica, Colorado Boulevard in Old Pasadena and the Brand
Avenue business district in Glendale, to name a few. There's also an
assorted lot of earthy street folks who entertain at Venice Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The money can be good. Some performers, who'd prefer not to boast
about it publicly, say they can make as much as $500 on a good night
at the Santa Monica promenade.</TE>
<TE>   On Hollywood, performers can make $200 to $400 in a few hours.</TE>
<TE>   If recent Sunday nights are any indication, things can be
downright crowded at Hollywood and Highland.</TE>
<TE>   At one corner, a group of break dancers moonwalked to a Michael
Jackson song. Just 10 feet away, a clown fashioned animals from
balloons.</TE>
<TE>   Another break dance group, the color-coordinated costumed
Troopers, ran through three-minute routines to songs blaring from a
boombox. The performances brought hearty applause from onlookers.</TE>
<TE>   The Troopers are "doing the art we love, and the people love it,"
said Rodney Banks, a group member who goes by the name of Scrap while
dancing.</TE>
<TE>   "They love to check us out."</TE>
<TE>   Among the acts on the sidewalk is 26-year-old Victor Cretella, the
Mercury Man, who says he can stand motionless for five hours.</TE>
<TE>   He stands still until someone puts a donation in a can in front of
him.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mercury Man thanks you for supporting Hollywood," he says
suddenly to more than a few startled visitors, motioning to shake
hands or waving to acknowledge the tip.</TE>
<TE>   Looking more like an alien from outer space than from his native
New York, Cretella gets some interesting reactions.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you tired?" one girl asked the Mercury Man the other day.</TE>
<TE>   No answer.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you want to get into a staring contest?" one teenage boy
asked.</TE>
<TE>   Still not a word.</TE>
<TE>   When one onlooker fashionably dribbled a basketball near him,
Cretella, out of character, suddenly asked, "You might want to join
the Lakers?"</TE>
<TE>   "You see that?" the dribbler blurted out. "He moved! He talked!"</TE>
<TE>   For their part, the operators of the Hollywood and Highland
complex like the street performers' routines.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great entertainment for our customers," said LeeAnne
Stables, the complex's chief marketing officer and spokeswoman.
"We've hired a few of them to entertain on our property. It's a great
part of Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   The sidewalk scene isn't without some problems, however.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD officers on foot patrol in the area say they constantly have
to remind the performers not to impede foot traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "I must have talked to these guys a dozen times," Senior Lead
Officer Mike Shea said. "Some of the break dancers do flips, and they
come inches from the crowd. They're the ones who cause most of the
problems. We have to immediately stop them.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it's out of control," he said. The dancers have been an
off-and-on problem for about five years, he went on, "but never to
the degree it is now."</TE>
<TE>   Banks said he has been cited four times for blocking the sidewalks
because of the large crowds that watch the Troopers perform.</TE>
<TE>   The Mercury Man was incredulous when he was cited recently for
blocking the sidewalk. "How can I block the sidewalk if I am
perfectly still?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Cretella said he is sensitive to police actions against street
performers because he ran into the same problem--though he still
wasn't moving--while doing his thing in a subway station in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "The cops treat you like you're a vagrant, a bum," he said. "They
don't see what we do as viable."</TE>
<TE>   Not true, Shea replied.</TE>
<TE>   It's good to have people flocking to Hollywood, he said, but
"pedestrians literally have to walk into traffic lanes to get past
the crowds of people watching the street performers. It's a very
unsafe condition."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the street performers seem to be winning the test of
sidewalk wills. Banks said he has beaten in court the four citations
issued against him.</TE>
<TE>   And Cretella said the citation against him was dismissed last
week.</TE>
<TE>   "The city attorney agreed with me that it's physically impossible
for me to block the sidewalk," said the self-styled master of
stillness.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the visitors seem to agree that the street action is
good for Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "What's the harm?" asked a first-time Hollywood visitor, Gale
Henderson of Buffalo, N.Y. "Just like Spider-Man, Superman and
Batman, these people make Hollywood what it is--a place to have fun."</TE>

<HD>'Dr. Dolittle' Escapee Gets 4 More Years</HD>
<DH>Courts: Kevin Pullum, who used a picture of Eddie Murphy on
ID, enters no contest plea.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An inmate who boldly used a fake ID card with actor Eddie Murphy's
picture on it to walk out of Los Angeles County Jail last year
pleaded no contest to a felony escape charge Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   On the day his trial was set to begin, Kevin Pullum, who
represented himself, entered into a plea agreement with prosecutors
and was sentenced to four years in state prison.</LD>
<LD>   He will serve the term in addition to a 65-years-to-life sentence
he received in December for an attempted-murder conviction.</LD>
<TE>   Pullum, 31, casually escaped from the Twin Towers jail on July 6,
2001, after returning from the Van Nuys courthouse, where he had just
been found guilty of attempted murder.</TE>
<TE>   He wore street clothes under his jail uniform, which he dumped in
an unguarded tunnel on his way back to jail, authorities said. Then
he apparently flashed the phony ID badge, which he had made with a
newspaper ad for the movie "Dr. Dolittle 2" and the plastic cover of
a court document.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials launched a massive manhunt for Pullum, who
spent his time on the lam shopping, visiting family members and
romancing his girlfriend at her downtown Los Angeles apartment. He
was arrested after 16 days on skid row, just a few blocks from where
he escaped.</TE>
<TE>   Pullum changed his plea Tuesday after Judge Michael Johnson said
there would be no more delays before beginning the trial. Pullum
faced a possible sentence of 25 years to life if a jury found him
guilty of escape.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office offered Pullum the four-year term
because he already is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison,
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Keri Modder. "So why waste thousands of
dollars trying this case?" she said.</TE>
<TE>   Modder said she also was somewhat reluctant to go to trial because
she would have had to delve into sensitive security issues in open
court concerning the county's jails.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Capt. Rick Adams said Tuesday that the case prompted the
department to review security procedures and implement a new
identification system.</TE>
<TE>   "I am confident that it won't happen again," he said.</TE>

<HD>Magnitude 4.8 Quake Rattles the Southland</HD>
<DH>Seismology: No major damage or injuries are reported from
the temblor centered northeast of Yorba Linda. It is the area's
strongest in five years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH and SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A magnitude 4.8 earthquake centered three miles northeast of Yorba
Linda early Tuesday was the strongest temblor to hit the Orange
County-Los Angeles metropolitan area in more than five years,
scientists said.</LD>
<LD>   The earthquake struck at 12:08 a.m. and was strong enough to wake
some residents in Orange County, the nearby Inland Empire and eastern
Los Angeles County, although no major damage or injuries were
reported.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists at Caltech and the U.S. Geological Survey said it was
the strongest quake in the basin since two Northridge earthquake
aftershocks of magnitude 5.1 and 4.9 near Simi Valley on April 26 and
27, 1997.</LD>
<TE>   The scientists upgraded the Yorba Linda quake from their initial
assessment of magnitude 4.6 to 4.8 on Tuesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Such recalculations are common as more seismic data are reviewed.</TE>
<TE>   That such a comparatively mild shaker was the strongest in five
years demonstrates just how seismically quiet Southern California has
been for what in human terms is an extended period but in geological
terms is just a flicker of time.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, a 4.8 would be strong enough to cause some minor damage,
such as breakage of goods in stores. But the epicenter of Tuesday's
quake was close to the San Bernardino County line in an area not
heavily populated.</TE>
<TE>   The quake was not too many miles from the epicenter of the Oct. 1,
1987, Whittier Narrows earthquake, but, according to Caltech
seismologists Egill Hauksson and Kate Hutton, it was on a different
fault system and was a strike-slip, or horizontal, rather than a
thrust quake.</TE>
<TE>   So, the two quakes had no seismic relation.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's quake occurred at a depth of a little more than four
miles and was felt from Victorville in the north to Escondido in the
south and west into Los Angeles. It was followed by 24 aftershocks in
13 hours, a comparatively large but not unusual number.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the aftershocks were in the high magnitude 2
range--between 2.6 and 2.9--and were felt by nearby residents.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Gruchow, assistant city manager of Yorba Linda, said he was
trying to fall asleep when he felt the main shock.</TE>
<TE>   Gruchow said quakes have occurred regularly in the area because of
its proximity to the Whittier fault system. He took the main shock in
stride, but then was struck by the number of aftershocks and called
scientists for information.</TE>
<TE>   At the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace in Yorba Linda, the
quake knocked some pictures askew, but that was the only evidence of
the jolt.</TE>
<TE>   Seismologists Hauksson and Hutton said the main shock was preceded
by two foreshocks, one a 2.6 at 9:50 p.m. Monday and the other a
minuscule 1.3 at 10:23 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Foreshocks occur, on average, in only one of 20 California
earthquakes, according to studies by U.S. Geological Survey scientist
Lucy Jones and others.</TE>
<TE>   Hauksson and Hutton said the quakes were near the Whittier fault,
which is known as having one of the fastest slip rates in Southern
California, at 2 to 3 millimeters, or about a 10th of an inch, per
year.</TE>
<TE>   The huge San Andreas fault, however, slips at 10 times that rate.</TE>
<TE>   The two scientists said that Tuesday's quakes occurred on a small
fault adjacent to the Whittier fault.</TE>
<TE>   The last quake greater than magnitude 4 in the basin was a 4.2
near Compton on Oct. 28, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The Jan. 17, 1994, Northridge quake--magnitude 6.7--was about 90
times more powerful than Tuesday's.</TE>

<HD>NBA Star's Passenger Shot</HD>
<DH>Crime: Man riding with Chicago Bulls player Jalen Rose is
wounded in attempted carjacking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A passenger in a rented $360,000 Bentley driven by Chicago Bulls
basketball star Jalen Rose was shot in the face early Tuesday in what
police described as a botched carjacking.</LD>
<LD>   The man, whose identity was not released, suffered a wound that
was not life-threatening, Los Angeles police spokesman Jack Richter
said. Rose was unhurt.</LD>
<LD>   The crime marked the second serious incident of violence in a week
in the Police Department's West Los Angeles Division, which has the
lowest rate of homicides and serious crimes in the city.</LD>
<TE>   Rose had stopped the 2002 Bentley Azure at a traffic light at
Sunset Boulevard and Barrington Place about 3 a.m. when three men in
a black, four-door Cadillac Escalade pulled up behind him, Richter
said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the men walked up to the passenger's side of the Bentley,
pulled out a gun and is believed to have said, "Give up the car,"
Richter said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Rose gunned the accelerator and the would-be thief fired
several rounds at the car, hitting the passenger once.</TE>
<TE>   The gunman was described as African American, 6-foot-6 and 160
pounds, with braided hair.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are pursuing several leads but have not made any
arrests, LAPD officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The 64-square-mile West Los Angeles Division includes some of the
city's toniest neighborhoods, including Brentwood, Pacific Palisades
and Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, less than a mile from the scene of the attempted
carjacking, a lone gunman shot to death three men outside a Koo Koo
Roo restaurant at Wilshire Boulevard and Bundy Drive. No arrests have
been made.</TE>
<TE>   Before the triple slaying Aug. 27, there had been only two
homicides and a total of 750 violent crimes in the division this
year, Richter said.</TE>

<LD>About 1,500 workers at three San Jose hospitals entered the second
day of a two-day strike Tuesday, demanding a say in staffing levels
and employer-paid health care for workers' families, said Dave Bates,
spokesman for the Service Employees International Union Local 250.</LD>
<LD>   The workers picketed at Regional Medical Center, Good Samaritan
Hospital and San Jose Medical Center, all owned by Hospital Corp. of
America. They said hospital management has stalled in drafting a
contract since the workers joined the union almost a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   But Hospital Corp. of America spokeswoman Leslie Kelsay said the
company is continuing to negotiate with the union.</LD>

<HD>Support for Rent Control</HD>
<DH>Secession: Most Valley candidates for mayor and council of
the prospective city sign pledge to adopt a law similar to L.A.'s.
Realtors group endorses breakup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to defuse a potent weapon for secession opponents, about 100
candidates for mayor and council in the proposed San Fernando Valley
city have signed a pledge to adopt Los Angeles-style rent-control
laws if voters approve a municipal breakup.</LD>
<LD>   Word that rent control has the support of 99 of the 111 Valley
candidates came as the Southland Regional Assn. of Realtors on
Tuesday announced its endorsement of the secession proposal on the
Nov. 5 ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The Realtors' endorsement and the "renters pledge" show that
Valley cityhood has the confidence of business leaders in the area,
but that renters will continue to enjoy protections offered by Los
Angeles, said Mel Wilson, past president of the Realtors association
and a candidate for Valley mayor.</LD>
<TE>   "Affordable housing is something that we all are entitled to,"
Wilson said at a news conference with 20 other Valley candidates
outside a North Hollywood apartment building.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn and other secession opponents have
said the potential loss of rent control is a key reason voters should
reject a breakup. The issue has been important for secessionists
because six in 10 Los Angeles residents are renters, and about 25% of
the 480,151 rental units under the city's rent controls are in the
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Levine, co-chairman of the anti-secession group One L.A.,
said the pledge does not reduce the uncertainty that would surround
rent control in a Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   "None of these promises are enforceable after an election," Levine
said. "I would caution voters that a bird in the hand is worth far
more than what is hiding in the bushes."</TE>
<TE>   If secession wins, Los Angeles laws would remain in force in the
Valley for up to 120 days. During that transition, the new city would
be free to adopt its own ordinances. The same process would apply to
Hollywood if voters approve the secession measure for that region,
which is also on the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Valley secession leaders began obtaining candidate signatures for
the renters pledge in July. Hollywood independence backers say they
also support rent control, and expect to secure similar pledges from
most candidates running for a Hollywood city council.</TE>
<TE>   Eight of the 10 mayoral candidates in the Valley have signed the
pledge, including perceived front-runners Wilson and Keith Richman, a
Republican assemblyman from Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a big deal for all of us, to stand here today and say
together, 'We support rent control in the San Fernando Valley,' "
Richman said. "But this gathering is more than that: It's to say to
Mayor Hahn ... 'It's time to stop your shameless lies and your
fear-mongering for people of the San Fernando Valley.' "</TE>
<TE>   Greg Roberts, one of the mayoral hopefuls who has not signed the
pledge, said earlier that he supports rent control. The other holdout
among the mayoral candidates, Bruce Boyer, said he is against rent
control.</TE>
<TE>   Ninety-one of the Valley council candidates have signed the
pledge, four have refused to do so, and the others have yet to
respond. The council and mayoral candidates would only take office if
secession passes.</TE>
<TE>   Kam Kuwata, an advisor to the mayor, said voters should be
suspicious of the pledges because many of the Valley secession
leaders have a history of opposing rent control. Among them is Valley
VOTE Chairman Richard Close, a real estate attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Levine said the emergence of the Realtors' organization as a
secession proponent should also cause unease because Realtors
generally oppose rent-control laws. The association has not taken a
position on Los Angeles' rent-control law, said Jim Link, executive
vice president for the group.</TE>
<TE>   "Historically, Realtors have not been in favor of rent control,
but secession is about more than one issue and we don't see this
[endorsement] as saying we are in favor of rent control," Link said.</TE>

<HD>J.L. Thompson, 88; Prolific Director of Action Films</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>J. Lee Thompson, the British-born film director best known for the
World War II action drama "The Guns of Navarone," the original "Cape
Fear," and a string of Charles Bronson action thrillers made during a
four-decade directing career, has died. He was 88.</LD>
<LD>   Thompson, who also introduced a young Hayley Mills to the screen,
died of congestive heart failure Friday at his summer home in Sooke,
on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada.</LD>
<LD>   In a directing career that began in 1950 and spanned 56 films,
Thompson's credits include four films starring Gregory Peck ("The
Guns of Navarone," "Cape Fear," "Mackenna's Gold" and "The Chairman")
and nine films starring Charles Bronson, including "Death Wish 4: The
Crackdown" "The Evil That Men Do," "Messenger of Death" and "Murphy's
Law."</LD>
<TE>   He also directed "Taras Bulba," "John Goldfarb, Please Come Home,"
"What a Way to Go!" a 1974 musical version of "Huckleberry Finn,"
"The Reincarnation of Peter Proud," "The Greek Tycoon" and two
"Planet of the Apes" films--"Conquest of the Planet of the Apes" and
"Battle for the Planet of the Apes."</TE>
<TE>   Although best known for the action-adventure films he made after
moving to Los Angeles in the wake of the 1961 success of his
Oscar-nominated "The Guns of Navarone," Thompson earned critical
acclaim while forging his career as a director of commercial and
socially relevant films in England in the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   He was hailed as the finest filmmaker to emerge from the British
studio system after World War II.</TE>
<TE>   He won the Berlin Film Festival's International Critics Award
three years in a row for "Woman in a Dressing Gown," "Ice-Cold in
Alex" and "Tiger Bay," the 1959 film that introduced a 12-year-old
Mills, whose performance as a lonely child who is abducted after
witnessing a murder led Walt Disney to cast her in the 1960 film that
made her an international star, "Pollyanna." "He had an incredible
career," said Pancho Kohner, who produced nine Thompson films
starring Bronson.</TE>
<TE>   "He made so many marvelous films that really haven't been shown
here, the early films. 'Ice-Cold in Alex,' starring John Mills and
Anthony Quayle, was one of his great films. 'Yield to the Night,'
with Diana Dors and Yvonne Mitchell, won the Cannes Film Festival
special award."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson's early films, shot in black and white, "had a gritty
reality to them," said Kohner. "He called them his kitchen sink
films."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson's American films, beginning with "The Guns of Navarone"
in 1961, were on a much larger scale, Kohner said.</TE>
<TE>   He was a replacement for the original director, British filmmaker
Alexander Mackendrick, who was fired from the production after a few
days' work on location in Greece.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson had only 10 days to do pre-production on the
adventure-thriller about Allied commandos who launch a daring assault
on a Nazi fortress on a Greek island.</TE>
<TE>   Writer-producer Carl Foreman chose Thompson to take over because
he had admired "Tiger Bay" and his 1959 action-adventure film "Flame
Over India."</TE>
<TE>   "He gave those films to Gregory Peck and David Niven to look at
because in their contracts they had the right [to approve] the
director," Thompson said in an interview in 2000. "They both loved
the films."</TE>
<TE>   "The Guns of Navarone" became the biggest hit of 1961 and earned
seven Oscar nominations, including those for best picture, director
and screenplay, and was a winner for special effects.</TE>
<TE>   But while it established Thomas as a bankable director of
big-budget Hollywood films, he later had reservations over it being
the one film for which he would forever be identified.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like since I came to America I'm rather like an old friend
of mine, the producer David Selznick," Thompson told a Canadian
newspaper two years ago. "David said, 'I almost regret having made
"Gone With the Wind," because that's the only film anyone ever
remembers me for.' I know what he's talking about."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Bristol, England, in 1914, Thompson joined the Nottingham
Repertory Company at age 17 and by 20, had two of his plays performed
in London.</TE>
<TE>   He began his career in films as an actor in 1934 and moved into
screenwriting in 1939.</TE>
<TE>   After serving as a tail gunner and a radio operator in the Royal
Air Force during World War II, he made his debut as a film director
in 1950 with "Murder Without Crime," which he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In the foreword to "J. Lee Thompson," a biography by Steve
Chibnall, and published by Manchester University Press in 2000, Sir
John Mills said he always thought Thompson was underrated as a
director.</TE>
<TE>   Mills, who worked twice with Thompson--on "Ice-Cold in Alex" and
"Tiger Bay--praised Thompson's technical brilliance as well as his
ability to always get the best out of actors.</TE>
<TE>   In launching his daughter, Hayley, on her film career in "Tiger
Bay," Mills wrote, Thompson "handled her superbly, and she turned in
a really marvelous performance."</TE>
<TE>   In directing Bronson in nine films, Kohner said: "[Thompson] was a
gentleman and a pleasure to be round. The crew would work 48 hours
straight for him. They loved him and his actors did, too. He had a
terrific sense of humor, and he was their rallying point. He was
definitely the leader of the film crew, and they looked at him and
respected him tremendously."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson is survived by his wife of 40 years, Penny; a daughter,
Lesley; and a granddaughter. His son, Peter Lee, is deceased.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held Sept. 14 at a chapel on Vancouver
Island.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, a longtime resident of Beverly Hills, was an animal
lover, and his family suggests that memorial con-tributions be made
to an animal shelter of the donor's choice.</TE>

<HD>Keep New Schools Out of Greenbelts, Educators Urged</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Educators must erect more two-story schools, rehab existing buildings
and build campuses within city boundaries if Ventura County is to
retain its semirural feel, say advocates of proposed new guidelines
for school construction.</LD>
<LD>   Following these guidelines will help keep bulldozers out of prime
farmland and avoid political fights that can cause expensive building
delays for school districts, proponents say.</LD>
<LD>   The most recent example was a battle to defeat a new elementary
school planned for 14 acres of farmland at the edge of the fertile
Oxnard Plain.</LD>
<TE>   After three years, Oxnard Elementary School District officials
shelved the plans amid opposition from environmental and community
groups, while also losing millions of dollars in state funding.</TE>
<TE>   No one wants to see that happen again, said Supervisor Steve
Bennett, a leader in the county's slow-growth movement.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to balance our desire to protect greenbelts from
development and to get schools built," said Bennett, who helped draft
the guidelines. "Rather than reacting every time a crisis comes up,
it's better to encourage as much advance planning as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Bennett will present the guidelines later this month to the Local
Agency Formation Commission, a planning agency that reviews
development outside city boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   County voters in recent years have enacted laws that restrict
development on farmland and open space. Although schools are exempt,
construction on agricultural property is still fraught with legal and
political challenges.</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines, developed after two workshops involving school
officials, farmers, environmentalists and planners, outline "a new
playing field" for school districts, builders and cities, Bennett
said.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, the guidelines would require cities and school
districts to work together to plan schools when new subdivisions are
going through the approval process. School administrators also would
be required to exhaust all other options before seeking approval to
build on prime farmland, Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   School districts would have to adhere to the guidelines before
they could get a project approved by the Local Agency Formation
Commission, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to say to LAFCO that all reasonable efforts have been
made to avoid building on farmland," said Bennett, who is also
chairman of the LAFCO board.</TE>
<TE>   The pressure to build schools in growth-restricted areas comes
from population growth.</TE>
<TE>   Enrollment in Ventura County schools grew from 112,000 a decade
ago to around 133,000 last year. Estimates of future growth differ,
but experts preparing for the "baby boom echo" anticipate at least 1%
a year in new enrollment to accommodate the children of baby boomers.</TE>
<TE>   That growth rate is equivalent to two elementary schools annually
for the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   This trend plays out most clearly in Oxnard, the county's largest
city with 177,000 residents. The Oxnard district would need to build
a new elementary school every year for the next five years to keep up
with demand, said Charles Weis, the county's superintendent of
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Home builders also need to be more involved, both in locating
property and building schools, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Districts currently have a legal right to demand only part of a
school's construction cost from developers.</TE>

<TE>   "You want to say to LAFCO that all reasonable efforts have been
made to avoid building on farmland," said Bennett, who is also
chairman of the LAFCO board.</TE>
<TE>   School officials say they are already working closely with cities
and developers. The Oxnard school district, for instance, is planning
to convert one-story buildings at seven elementary schools into
two-story facilities, said Sandra Rosales, assistant superintendent
of business.</TE>
<TE>   The extra space will add so many classrooms that it will be like
opening two new schools, Rosales said. The district is already on a
year-round, multi-track calendar to increase capacity at existing
schools, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Oxnard's been doing its part," she said. "But it takes everyone
working together to try to work through this."</TE>
<TE>   Battles often emerge when cities approve developments that produce
school-age children but not the classrooms in which to educate them,
said George Shaw, a planner with the state Department of Education's
facilities division.</TE>
<TE>   "School districts have to do what they are mandated to do--provide
an education for children in their area," Shaw said. "It is laudable
to try to head off problems before they erupt. Certainly school
districts would prefer the benefit of good planning and not be the
scapegoats for bad planning."</TE>
<TE>   The pressure to build schools in growth-restricted areas comes
from population growth.</TE>
<TE>   Enrollment in Ventura County schools grew from 112,000 a decade
ago to around 133,000 last year. Estimates of future growth differ,
but experts preparing from the "baby boom echo" anticipate at least
1% a year in new enrollment to accommodate the children of baby
boomers.</TE>
<TE>   That growth rate is equivalent to two elementary schools annually
for the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   This trend plays out most clearly in Oxnard, the county's largest
city with 177,000 residents. The Oxnard district would need to build
a new elementary school every year for the next five years to keep up
with demand, said Charles Weis, the county's superintendent of
schools.</TE>
<TE>   One goal is to move toward schools that can hold more students,
without compromising safety concerns, Weis said. The optimal number
of students for elementary schools is 500. For high schools, it is
1,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't just say there will be no more schools," Weis said. "So
we have to try to come up with compromises."</TE>
<TE>   Home builders also need to be more involved, both in locating
property and building schools, officials said. Districts currently
have a legal right to demand only part of a school's construction
cost from developers.</TE>
<TE>   But with the increasing difficulty of getting subdivisions
approved, developers are more receptive to taking on new costs. That
is what happened in the Rio Elementary School District last year.</TE>
<TE>   When a 2,800-home project was proposed, Supt. Yolanda Benitez got
the developer to agree to build three campuses right away, with no
guarantee of repayment. If the RiverPark development is approved by
the Oxnard City Council, the schools will be among the first
buildings to go up.</TE>
<TE>   That can be a win-win situation, Shaw said. Home buyers want to
know what school their children will attend and are happy if it's the
new one down the block, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting developers to work with school districts is a kind of
hit-or-miss prospect," he said. "But if they are wise, they can
advertise that there is going to be a new elementary school in that
development."</TE>

<LD>Two men were charged Tuesday with seven misdemeanor counts for
allegedly plowing down 301 oak trees on a ranch outside Ojai and
altering a stream bed without proper permits.</LD>
<LD>   If convicted, William N. Kaddis, 58, of Los Angeles and Aviram Max
Soltes, 21, of La Crescenta face up to 3 1/2 years in prison and
fines totaling $97,300 each, according to prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities believe Kaddis hired Soltes to remove the trees last
fall on Kaddis' 43-acre hillside property near Lake Casitas. Kaddis
has denied any wrongdoing. Arraignment is scheduled for Sept. 25.</LD>

<HD>Rangers Flirt With No-Hitter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joaquin Benoit earned a piece of baseball history, although not the
way he preferred.</LD>
<LD>   Jerry Hairston hit a leadoff triple in the ninth inning, ruining
Benoit's bid to complete a combined no-hitter, but the Texas Rangers
handed the Baltimore Orioles their 10th consecutive loss, 7-1,
Tuesday night at Baltimore.</LD>
<LD>   Ranger starter Aaron Myette was ejected after throwing two
pitches, and Todd Van Poppel followed with two sharp innings. Benoit
then extended the no-hitter through the eighth before giving up
Baltimore's only hit.</LD>
<TE>   "I really didn't think about it. If it's going to happen, it's
going to happen, whatever," the rookie said.</TE>
<TE>   Benoit had to be content with setting a major league record for
the longest outing resulting in a save--seven innings. The previous
record was six, by Horacio Pina of the Rangers in 1972. Saves were
first kept as a stat in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Benoit struck out four, walked none and hit two batters to earn
his first big league save.</TE>
<TE>   On a 1-and-2 count, Hairston hit a sinking liner that dropped in
front of sliding right fielder Carl Everett and rolled to the wall.
Chris Richard followed with a run-scoring groundout.</TE>
<TE>   Myette was ejected by plate umpire Mark Hirschbeck after his first
two pitches went behind Mora, an apparent retaliation for Alex
Rodriguez being hit by a pitch in the top of the first.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not much to talk about. I threw two pitches, and that was
it for my outing," Myette said. "I pitch inside a lot, balls get
away. I've never had perfect control."</TE>
<TE>   Van Poppel (3-1) finished the walk, then walked Hairston before
striking out the side. He worked a perfect second inning, striking
out two batters.</TE>
<TE>   Said Hairston: "This is the first of three games for us against
A-Rod. The last thing we want to do is get him mad."</TE>
<TE>   Herbert Perry homered in the sixth, extending the Rangers' streak
of games with a home run to 21--matching a club record set this
season. Michael Young hit two triples, tying a team mark, and scored
twice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York 4, Boston 2--Roger Clemens struck out 10 at Yankee
Stadium in his 292nd career victory, and New York strengthened its
grip on the American League East.</TE>
<TE>   Clemens (12-5) struck out the first four batters and made three
first-inning runs stand up. He gave up four hits in 7 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees ended a three-game skid and increased their lead in
the division to seven games over Boston. The Red Sox dropped five
games behind the Angels in the wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 4, Cleveland 0--Rookie Andy Van Hekken pitched a shutout
in his major league debut, giving up eight hits and helping the
Tigers end a nine-game home losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Van Hekken, a 23-year-old native of Holland, Mich., struck out one
and walked two. He pitched in front of more than 100 relatives and
friends.</TE>
<TE>   The left-hander was the first AL pitcher to debut with a shutout
since Oakland's Mike Norris on April 10, 1975, and the first Tiger
pitcher to do it since April 15, 1933, when Schoolboy Rowe shut out
the Chicago White Sox, 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   Van Hekken was 5-0 at triple-A Toledo before being called up
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 5, Toronto 4--Jose Valentin's second homer of the game
ended a a tie in the seventh inning at Toronto, and the White Sox won
a season-high seventh in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Valentin ended a 2-2 tie in the fifth inning with a homer against
Esteban Loaiza (7-8) and gave Chicago the lead for good in the
seventh against Loaiza with his 21st homer. Both were solo shots.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Washburn wins 16th in 10-2 victory over lowly
Devil Rays as Anaheim gains ground on Oakland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.</DL>
<LD>This doesn't happen every day--or hardly any day recently--but the
Oakland Athletics lost ground to the Angels on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The A's did not play, true. They haven't lost in three weeks. But
they haven't shaken off the Angels.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels took another step toward the playoffs--and another step
closer to Oakland--with a 10-2 victory over the hapless Tampa Bay
Devil Rays. With Angel ace Jarrod Washburn winning again and
outfielder Orlando Palmeiro tying a career high by driving in four
runs, the Angels gained on both pursuers in the American League
wild-card race. They lead the Seattle Mariners by 2 1/2 games and the
Boston Red Sox by 5 1/2.</LD>
<TE>   But the Angels haven't conceded the AL West to the A's, not with
four games against Oakland next week and four more a week later. The
A's have won 19 consecutive games, but the Angels lurk 3 1/2 games
behind.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing what they're doing. Good for them," Angel outfielder
Darin Erstad said. "But we're still in this thing. We want to win the
division."</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays are abominable. They're 38 games out of first, on
pace for 106 losses. They committed two errors Tuesday, walked home a
run and had a wild pitch and a passed ball. The game ended when they
had a runner thrown out at home.</TE>
<TE>   And, although the Devil Rays announced they had sold 10,146
tickets, the actual "crowd" was less than half that. The announced
crowd would have been even lower if not for two Angel
rookies--infielder Chone Figgins, who lives in Tampa, and pitcher
Scot Shields, who grew up in Fort Lauderdale--combining to draw 70
friends and family members.</TE>
<TE>   There was a game to be won, against a crummy team, beneath a
crummy dome, and the Angels took care of business.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn (16-5) became the first Angel with 16 victories since
Chuck Finley and Mark Langston each won 16 in 1993. No Angel has won
more since 1991, when Langston won 19 and Finley and Jim Abbott each
won 18.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of celebrating the milestone victory, Washburn sounded
embarrassed by it. He pitched five innings, his shortest outing since
April. He gave up six hits and three walks and threw 100 pitches, a
performance far from dominant.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time we can pull out a win when I'm that bad, that's a
positive," he said. "The bullpen should get the win for that. I
shouldn't."</TE>
<TE>   After losing once between April 13 and Aug. 17, Washburn is 1-2
with a 6.08 earned-run average in his last four starts.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn historically fades in September, but the Angels insist
his current stumbles reflect a mechanical flaw--"easily correctable,"
pitching coach Bud Black said--rather than any recurrent fatigue or
weakness in his arm.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia said there is no evidence of decreased
velocity, as there was in previous seasons, or other indicator of
caution. Washburn's career ERA in September is 5.23, but Scioscia and
Washburn believe experience and a conditioning program have made the
pitcher strong enough to flourish this month.</TE>
<TE>   "Physically, I feel great," Washburn said. "I just couldn't throw
a strike."</TE>
<TE>   Al Levine pitched two scoreless relief innings, as did Shields.
Second baseman Adam Kennedy extended his hitting streak to a
career-high 11 games. Palmeiro, about to yield right field back to
Tim Salmon, has seven hits in his last 11 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Garret Anderson doubled again. He leads the majors with
50 doubles and could become the first AL player with 60 since Charlie
Gehringer of the Detroit Tigers in 1936.</TE>
<TE>   The major league record is 67, set by Earl Webb of the 1931 Boston
Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Catcher Bengie Molina drew another walk. Molina, who drew two
walks in April and two in May, has four walks in his last five games.</TE>
<TE>   And Figgins got into the game in the ninth inning, drawing warm
applause from the 45 friends and family members here to cheer him on.
On this night, they were easily heard.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Sele's Status as Starter Uncertain</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.</DL>
<LD>If Aaron Sele returns to the Angels this year--with increasing
emphasis on the "if"--he might do so as a reliever.</LD>
<LD>   Sele has not thrown off a mound since doctors detected a partially
torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder two weeks ago. With 25 days
left in the regular season, it is unlikely he can regain enough
strength in the shoulder and develop enough stamina to return as a
starter and pitch six or seven innings.</LD>
<LD>   "Can he throw 120 pitches again? That's probably out of the
question," pitching coach Bud Black said. "There's a chance he could
start and pitch a certain number of innings or pitches. There's a
possibility of him being in the bullpen as well."</LD>
<TE>   Said Sele: "I don't need a full tank of gas to finish the season."</TE>
<TE>   When the Angels put him on the disabled list, they said he was
expected to miss two to three weeks. But Sele said Tuesday he was
told he could start throwing in two to three weeks--and he has played
catch--not return to the roster on that timetable. Manager Mike
Scioscia said the original time frame reflected only a "possibility"
and said he was more concerned with Sele rehabilitating the shoulder
for next season than this one.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels will pay him $8 million next year and $8.5 million in
2004.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still a lot of steps he has to take before you consider
him being close enough to pitch in a game," Scioscia said. "The most
important thing for Aaron's career is to make sure he's in a position
to get his arm healthy so he can pitch for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Now that the players and owners have reached a new labor
agreement, the union is expected to consider whether to lift the ban
on admitting those who served as replacement players during the
1994-95 strike.</TE>
<TE>   Those players, including Brendan Donnelly of the Angels, Rick Reed
of the Minnesota Twins and Damian Miller of the Arizona Diamondbacks,
do not share in licensing revenue, worth about $30,000 per player per
year.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Schoeneweis, the Angels' player representative, said he
would support Donnelly for union membership. That decision would be
up to the players on the executive board of the union.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to see Brendan be a part of the union," Schoeneweis
said. "What he did doesn't tarnish the type of person he is and the
type of teammate he is."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder and No. 3 hitter Tim Salmon, who has not started since
his left hand was hit and badly bruised by a pitch Aug. 10, is
expected to return to the lineup no later than Friday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels claimed outfielder Barry Wesson on waivers from the
Houston Astros and optioned him to triple-A Salt Lake. Wesson, 25,
hit .293 with 11 home runs at triple-A New Orleans.</TE>

<HD>Tosca Has Contract Extended by Blue Jays</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Toronto Blue Jay Manager Carlos Tosca and his coaching staff received
contract extensions through the 2004 season on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Tosca took over the Blue Jays after Buck Martinez was fired June
3, and has led the team to a 40-45 record.</LD>
<LD>   "I knew real early that we had the right guy in charge," General
Manager J.P. Ricciardi said. "We are going in the right direction.
We've said all along that we wanted to change the perception that the
Blue Jays were a team that didn't hustle or play hard."</LD>
<TE>   Tosca, 48, became third base coach in December after Ricciardi
replaced Gord Ash as general manager. Tosca had managed 1,759 games
in the minor leagues.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so appreciative to J.P. because he went against the grain
when he hired me," Tosca said. "It showed a lot of guts on his part
to be able to do that.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any professional playing experience and for some
reason that's a hang-up for some people."</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jays extended the contracts of pitching coach Gil
Patterson, hitting coach Mike Barnett, third base coach Brian
Butterfield, first base coach John Gibbons and bullpen coach Bruce
Walton.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Yankee closer Mariano Rivera, on the disabled list
because of a right shoulder strain, expects to pitch again this
season.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what we're looking for," Rivera said after a workout in
Tampa, Fla. "I'm always optimistic."</TE>
<TE>   Rivera is on a program of rest and exercise at the Yankees' minor
league complex.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco reacquired infielder Bill Mueller from the Chicago
Cubs for minor league pitcher Jeff Verplancke.... Houston sent minor
league pitcher Wayne Franklin to Milwaukee as one of the two players
to be named in the weekend deal for infielder Mark Loretta.</TE>

<HD>There Were Some Sorry Exhibitions by Rams</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Greg Cote in the Miami Herald: "Predicting an NFL team's fortunes
based on preseason results is like forecasting if it will rain by
looking up at the ceiling. The correlation is spectacularly not
there.</LD>
<LD>   "You are as likely to bull's-eye a Super Bowl champion on evidence
of August outcomes as you are to accurately pick the future U.S.
president from a hospital full of sock-headed newborns caterwauling
in cribs."</LD>
<LD>   Many years ago Paul Brown, owner and coach of the Cleveland
Browns, scoffed at the L.A. Rams as they ran up large scores in
exhibition games, including routing the Browns, sneering, "I see
where the Rams won their letters today."</LD>
<TE>   The Browns would then beat the Rams in the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who were the first USC and UCLA football players
selected as consensus All-Americans?</TE>
<TE>   Unfamiliar territory: New York Met catcher Mike Piazza is "shocked
and dismayed" that the Mets didn't win a home game during August:
"This is unchartered waters for me. Now it's to the point it's a
strange feeling where your motivation and goal is not to extend a
losing streak. Trust me, that's bitter and it [stinks]."</TE>
<TE>   Cold: Utah State assistant football coach Mike Lynch, commenting
on a walk-on quitting on the first day after having a physical and
eating: "Maybe the brutality of walking to the cafeteria was too much
for him."</TE>
<TE>   Hey, coach, take it easy. Maybe the poor guy was just hungry and
couldn't afford a decent meal.</TE>
<TE>   It still hurts: Steve Hummer of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,
commenting on Shaquille O'Neal's arthritic big toe: "The proportion
is all wrong here. O'Neal, the giant among giants, is troubled by one
of the smallest parts of his massive frame.</TE>
<TE>   "That's like parking an 18-wheeler on a broken cigarette lighter."</TE>
<TE>   No cake either: No other kid Ty Tyron's age has a PGA Tour card.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of mixing it up with Tiger Woods, Tyron had his
tonsils taken out a week before his 18th birthday in June.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't even eat my birthday dinner," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Back-breaking book: Jim Armstrong in the Denver Post: "Now I know
how all those linemen in Nebraska get so big. They bench press the
media guide. Damn thing is thicker than Madonna's little black book."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1941, the New York Yankees recorded
the earliest pennant-clinching date in history when they defeated
Boston, 6-3. The Yankees finished the season with a 101-53 record, 17
games ahead of the Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: USC tailback Mort Kaer in 1926 and UCLA end Burr
Baldwin in 1946.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: David Whitley of the Orlando Sentinel is skeptical
that Shawn Kemp will add anything more to the Magic this season
except his weight: "The Magic needs a big man, but a 350-pounder? If
he brings all his illegitimate children to games, at least there
shouldn't be any empty seats at the TD Waterhouse Center ...</TE>
<TE>   "Kemp is only 32. But when he got a $100-million contract five
years ago, he became a shadow of himself. Actually, he became a
shadow of Fat Elvis, only with a shorter vertical leap and [at least]
seven kids."</TE>

<LD>Washington Coach Rick Neuheisel has agreed to a six-year contract
extension, keeping him with the Huskies through 2008.</LD>
<LD>   The university also gave him a $1.5 million loan, in addition to
his annual university compensation of $1.2 million, Athletic Director
Barbara Hedges said.</LD>
<LD>   While Neuheisel, 41, will make semiannual interest payments at 5%,
the $1.5 million is his to keep if he stays for the six years. If he
leaves before Jan. 1, 2008, Neuheisel must repay the loan, plus pay
an early departure penalty of $600,000.</LD>
<TE>   That penalty was increased from the previous $100,000.</TE>

<HD>Ishii, Dodgers Back in Striking Range</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Pitcher returns to form after prolonged slump,
gets win in 3-2 victory over NL West-leading Diamondbacks; L.A.
within four games of first.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>It was 81 degrees inside air-conditioned Bank One Ballpark on Tuesday
night, but the way the Dodgers continued to turn up the heat on the
defending World Series-champion Arizona Diamondbacks, it felt more
like the scorching 107-degree temperatures outside the dome.</LD>
<LD>   Left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii saved his starting job with 5 1/3
shutout innings, and relievers Kevin Brown and Jesse Orosco each
struck out batters with the bases loaded in the sixth to lead the
Dodgers to a 3-2 victory over the Diamondbacks before a crowd of
35,891.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers won for the 19th time in 25 games, improved to 27-11
in one-run games and have shaved five games off Arizona's National
League West lead in eight days, going from nine games back on Aug. 26
to four back before today's series finale, in which the Dodgers will
face left-hander Randy Johnson.</LD>
<TE>   "It's disturbing," Arizona pitcher Brian Anderson said after the
Diamondbacks lost for the seventh time in 10 games. "We can say,
'Well, we're still four games up,' but it doesn't take a rocket
scientist to figure out that not that long ago, we were nine up. And
it's been cut by more than a half in a week. No question, we need to
come out [today] and right the ship a bit, because right now, it's
ugly."</TE>
<TE>   It's the first time since 1991, when they finished 93-69, that the
Dodgers (81-57) have been 24 games over .500.</TE>
<TE>   Few would admit it, but many Dodgers had all but conceded the
division title to the Diamondbacks in late August and set their
sights on the NL wild card.</TE>
<TE>   But after Adrian Beltre hit a two-run homer in the first inning
Tuesday night, Paul Lo Duca hit an RBI double in the seventh and five
relievers carried the Dodgers to the finish line, talk turned to a
possible NL West championship.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like we were in the thick of it last week," Manager Jim
Tracy said. "But it's a little thicker now."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the Diamondbacks were beginning to feel some pressure,
Dodger closer Eric Gagne, who gave up one run in 1 1/3 innings but
still recorded his 47th save Tuesday night, said, "I hope so. They
should."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii, whose rotation spot was in jeopardy because of his 3-8
record and 5.58 earned-run average since June 14, was also feeling
some pressure--Tracy wouldn't say before Tuesday's game if he would
even make his next start.</TE>
<TE>   But after improving to 3-0 with an 0.95 ERA in three starts
against Arizona this season, Tracy said Ishii, who gave up four hits
and walked only two, will start Sunday against Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "That was arguably as good a performance as he's had all year,"
Tracy said. "The key for him was fastball command. When he throws
strikes, his pitches are difficult for the opposition to deal with."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii, who began the game with a major league-leading 100 walks,
issued no walks and no three-ball counts in the first five innings.
But he rushed his throw on Tony Womack's leadoff bunt in the sixth,
stumbling backward and missing first base.</TE>
<TE>   The play, scored a single, seemed to rattle Ishii, who got Steve
Finley to fly to left but walked Junior Spivey and Luis Gonzalez to
load the bases. Tracy pulled Ishii in favor of Brown, the Dodgers'
$15-million situational reliever, and Brown responded with a huge
strikeout of Greg Colbrunn.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy then summoned Orosco to face Erubiel Durazo, who pulled a
450-foot foul ball down the right-field line. Two pitches later, the
free-swinging Durazo missed badly on Orosco's sweeping slider for an
inning-ending strikeout.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers added an insurance run in the seventh when
pinch-hitter Mike Kinkade singled, Marquis Grissom reached on a
fielder's choice and Lo Duca slapped an RBI double to right.</TE>
<TE>   That offset Diamondback third baseman Chris Donnels' RBI double in
the bottom of the seventh off reliever Paul Shuey.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Quantrill and Gagne combined for a scoreless eighth. Mark
Grace led off the ninth with a double off Gagne and scored on
Donnels' sacrifice fly, but Gagne got Womack on a comebacker to end
the game.</TE>
<TE>   "You're focused on getting to the playoffs any way you can," Lo
Duca said, "but it would be nice to put some pressure on these guys
and see what happens."</TE>

<HD>Grace's Pitching Appearance Helped Soothe Sting of Loss</HD>

<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Though it was not his intention, Arizona first baseman Mark Grace's
cameo as a pitcher in the ninth inning of the Dodgers' 19-1 thrashing
of the Diamondbacks on Monday night provided more than comic relief.
It took the sting out of the worst loss in franchise history.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a stroke of genius," Dodger center fielder Dave Roberts
said. "You watch 'SportsCenter,' and the game couldn't have been
downplayed more. They could have shown every run we scored, and they
didn't. It made it easier for [the Diamondbacks] to realize it was a
fluke."</LD>
<LD>   All Grace wanted to do was save a worn-out bullpen from having to
throw another inning.</LD>
<TE>   "In [the clubhouse] the focus wasn't so much on the game and that
we got our ... kicked," Grace said. "It took the edge off the first
eight innings.... One thing I've never been called is a genius. But
if you want to, it's spelled, G-E-N-I-U-S. I had a lot of fun."</TE>
<TE>   Before his first pitch, Grace took an exaggerated deep breath and
thrust his head toward the batter, an impression of teammate and
former Dodger reliever Mike Fetters that had players from both
dugouts laughing. Grace retired three of four batters, giving up a
home run to David Ross.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With a day off Thursday, Dodger Manager Jim Tracy will shuffle his
rotation so that Hideo Nomo, who has a 9-3 record and 2.51 earned-run
average in his career against San Francisco, can pitch against the
Giants next Wednesday and left-hander Omar Daal can face a
predominantly left-handed Colorado lineup next weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo will open a three-game series against Houston on Friday
night, Daal will pitch Saturday and Kazuhisa Ishii will start Sunday.
Odalis Perez, Andy Ashby and Nomo, who threw 7 2/3 shutout innings in
a 3-0 win over the Giants in Pacific Bell Park on April 9, will start
in San Francisco next week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brian Jordan, who didn't play for three weeks in August because of
a protrusion in his lower back, woke up Monday feeling "pretty locked
up and sore," but the left fielder loosened up by game time and had a
home run and a single Monday night. Jordan felt better Tuesday and
said he's determined not to let his injuries affect his play.</TE>
<TE>   "I talked to [Tracy] about this, and he agreed to turn me loose,"
Jordan said. "If it blows, it blows; let's go for it. I want to win,
and every game is important, so I'm going to give it all I have.
Whatever happens, happens."</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The ATP's Board of Directors and its Player Council have approved
changes designed to strengthen its anti-doping program, which is
organized in conjunction with the WTA and ITF.</LD>
<LD>   Revisions will include reworked language regarding blood testing.
Only urine specimens are currently used in the testing procedure. The
second issue deals with out-of-competition testing, which is random,
not targeted.</LD>
<LD>   "We've done a lot of work on the out-of-competition testing to
bring it up to speed," said Richard Ings, the ATP's executive vice
president of Rules and Competition. "Now we need to do more. We've
targeted out-of-competition testing. It is random--there's a pool of
players. Testing was more for recreational drugs [in the beginning]."</LD>
<TE>   The new language could, for example, allow for targeted testing of
players who have achieved a certain ranking; testing of players who
have missed a period of time because of injury; or testing a player
who withdraws late from a tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Ings said Tuesday that the goal is to have the revisions in place
no later than the start of the 2003 season, pending approval from the
other two governing bodies of tennis. The ATP's Board and Player
Council approved the changes in separate meetings at the U.S. Open
last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the good things is the players want as much done as
possible," said Ings of the vote in favor of changes.</TE>

<LD>Del Mar, with seven days of racing left on its calendar, will run the
$100,000 Generous Portion, a six-furlong contest for 2-year-old
fillies bred in California, for the 10th time today.</LD>
<LD>   Trainers Bob Baffert and John Sadler have won the race and both
have representatives in the field of 11.</LD>
<LD>   Baffert, who won with Fiscal Year in 1997, is scheduled to send
out Servaline, a $2-million yearling purchase who broke her maiden in
her third start on Aug. 16, and Small Town Girl, who has yet to win
in five starts and who ran only six days ago.</LD>
<TE>   Sadler, who won with One More Angel in 1996, will try again with
the longshot Madam General. The gray daughter of General Meeting was
fourth at 43-1 in her debut Aug. 16, beaten by 3 1/2 lengths by
Servaline.</TE>
<TE>   The filly to beat might be Hollywood Honey. Owned by a partnership
and trained by Wesley Ward, the daughter of Distinctive Cat will be
making her first start since she won a two-furlong race at Santa
Anita on March 21. She completed the quarter mile in 21 2/5 seconds
while winning by 3 1/2 lengths.</TE>
<TE>   Tyler Baze will ride Hollywood Honey and it will be interesting to
see if she can carry her speed an additional half-mile around a turn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The third at Del Mar kicks off the pick six and
is an interesting optional claimer at 1 1/16 miles on the turf.
Contenders include All The Gears, Caveolin, Top Honours and Come Back
Ronnie.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Bet On Sunshine. The 10-year-old, who was retired
earlier this week, finished his career with 22 victories in 47 starts
and earned more than $1.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Ron Goodridge. The trainer has won with two of 82
starters at the Arlington Park meet in suburban Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Lucky In Love, Jetinto
Houston, Arms Control and Sci Fi Kin in the fifth, Bold Mango and
Spend Spend Spend in the sixth, Summer Wind Dancer, Hollywood Honey,
Amber Hills and Servaline in the seventh and singling Fight For
Freedom in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/71. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $7.80/$412.80. Total money bet: $618.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Major League Baseball owners will meet in Chicago on Thursday to
discuss ratification of the new labor agreement, it was learned
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   A majority--or 16 of the 30 owners--is required to approve the
agreement in its entirety, but three-fourths, or 23 owners, is
required to approve the revenue-sharing component.</LD>
<LD>   Although a group of seven or eight owners took a hard-line stance
during the negotiations, lobbying Commissioner Bud Selig to refrain
from major compromise on the key issues, the agreement is expected to
be approved.</LD>
<TE>   "I'd be surprised if it's not a unanimous vote," San Diego Padre
owner John Moores said.</TE>
<TE>   Moores had said during the negotiations he was prepared to sit out
the 2003 season rather than approve a bad agreement. He said Tuesday
that he would have liked a "stronger deal" and that "the union
probably feels fortunate it didn't have to give up more," but "on
balance I think the game will be ahead because of it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will improve our financial situation and enable us to
do some things differently, but in our situation it's hard to
overstate how important the new ballpark [scheduled to open in 2004]
will be. The ballpark is still the 1,000-pound gorilla in the
equation."</TE>

<HD>Pierce, Finley Ignite Rout by the U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Only one more game at the men's basketball World Championships will
match two unbeaten teams. The United States warmed up for it by
getting its act together in the second half Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   With Paul Pierce and Michael Finley leading the way, a dominant
third quarter made up for an uninspired first half in a 110-62
victory over New Zealand at Indianapolis.</LD>
<LD>   Pierce and Finley scored 20 points apiece and Shawn Marion had 16
for the Americans (5-0), who conclude the second round against
Argentina (5-0) tonight. The quarterfinals are Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   "In a lot of ways, the games begin now. Every team has a chance to
beat us if we don't play the right way," U.S. Coach George Karl said.</TE>
<TE>   Karl watched parts of the Argentina-Germany game from the tunnel
near the Indiana Pacers' locker room, and the U.S. came out playing
as though it were looking past New Zealand.</TE>
<TE>   Despite being without its only NBA player, Sean Marks, who sat out
because of a scratched eye, New Zealand kept it close for 24 minutes.
The U.S. team outscored New Zealand, 35-10, in the fourth to make it
a rout.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans, playing lethargically for long stretches, didn't
open their first double-digit lead until midway through the third
quarter. They held New Zealand scoreless for a stretch of six minutes
and used a 15-0 run that included an eight-point possession to break
things open.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried every trick in the book," New Zealand Coach Tab Baldwin
said. "For a while, there were some things that worked, but the water
on the other side of that dam is pretty deep and pretty cold, and we
didn't have enough fingers to keep that thing from busting."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. improved to 58-0 when using NBA players in international
competitions, but that record could be at risk against the South
American champions.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina has been one of the most impressive teams in the
tournament, scoring 100 points per game and winning by an average of
20.8 points.</TE>
<TE>   "They're probably more NBA-like than any team that we play," Karl
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Portland Fire of the WNBA said it won't renew the contract of
Coach and General Manager Linda Hargrove for next season.</TE>
<TE>   The Fire had a 37-59 record the last three seasons under Hargrove.
The contracts of assistants Jessie Kenlaw and Tom Newell won't be
renewed either.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lin Dunn resigned as coach and general manager of the Seattle
Storm. She had a 33-63 record in the three years with the WNBA team.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Former IRL champion Greg Ray was hired to drive in the last two

<HD>Jets Are Asked to Fire Instant-Replay Advisor</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The NFL asked the New York Jets to fire 78-year-old advisor Tony
Veteri from his role in making instant-replay decisions because his
son is a head linesman in the league.</LD>
<LD>   Veteri, a former official who worked four Super Bowls during a
24-year career, was hired to help Coach Herman Edwards decide when to
ask for an instant-replay review of officials' calls. Veteri also was
teaching the Jets how to avoid penalties.</LD>
<LD>   The league asked the team to dismiss him because his son Tony is a
head linesman and it might pose a conflict of interest, Jet spokesman
Ron Colangelo said.</LD>
<TE>   "The NFL contacted us and thought it was in the best interest of
all parties that Tony not continue in that capacity," Colangelo said.
"We obliged the NFL's wishes."</TE>
<TE>   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the situation raised a potential
conflict because "the club would have preferential access to an
official. Not only was he a former supervisor, but we'd have to
switch Tony Jr.'s assignments so he wouldn't be officiating Jets'
games."</TE>
<TE>   Veteri can work with the team during practices.</TE>
<TE>   Jet General Manager Terry Bradway didn't immediately return calls.</TE>
<TE>   The younger Veteri, reached at his father's home, said the
officials' contract bans them from talking to the media. The elder
Veteri didn't return calls.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City tackle Willie Roaf, who was arrested Saturday on
suspicion of drunken driving, will face no disciplinary action from
the team.</TE>
<TE>   Roaf, a seven-time Pro Bowl selection with New Orleans, is in his
first season with the Chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   "Willie and I talked about it. I don't really plan any
discipline," Chief Coach Dick Vermeil said. "I'm not a big fine guy.
I think sometimes the greatest punishment is self. He's embarrassed
about it."</TE>
<TE>   Roaf was not available for comment.</TE>

<TE>   Seattle gave linebacker Chad Brown, 32, a three-time Pro Bowl
selection, a five-year contract extension that begins after his

<TE>   Matt Bryant, who was cut by the New York Giants on Friday, became
the team's starting kicker Tuesday when Owen Pochman was put on
injured reserve because of a knee injury. Bryant, 27, hasn't kicked

<TE>   Former Seattle Seahawk receiver Brian Blades, 37, accepted a plea
deal in Miami that allows him to avoid jail time for charges stemming

must perform 100 hours of community service, enroll in an anger
control course, and undergo a substance-abuse evaluation.</TE>

<HD>Sanders Lifts Giants Over Colorado</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reggie Sanders homered, Rich Aurilia drove in two runs and Russ Ortiz
helped himself at the plate in another strong start as the San
Francisco Giants beat the Colorado Rockies, 4-2, Tuesday night at San
Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco used five pitchers to win for the eighth time in
nine games and remain two games behind the Dodgers in the National
League wild-card race. San Francisco moved within six games of
first-place Arizona in the NL West.</LD>
<LD>   The Rockies held Barry Bonds in check but couldn't manage much
offense against Ortiz, who gave up one run and five hits in six
innings. He also doubled and scored.</LD>
<TE>   Robb Nen pitched the ninth for his 35th save in 43 opportunities.
He is one save from tying the franchise record of 199, set by Rod
Beck from 1991-97.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado did everything in its power to make sure Bonds wouldn't
hurt them this week the way he did last--with five home runs in three
games at Denver. Bonds was 0 for 2, got hit by a pitch and walked.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 3-5, New York 2-11--Pinch-hitter Mike Piazza hit a
three-run homer and the Mets ended their National League-record home
losing streak at 15 by winning the second game of a doubleheader.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets won for the first time at Shea Stadium since beating the
Houston Astros 10-0 on July 31. Their 12-inning loss in the first
game set the record for ineptitude at home, surpassing Boston's 14 in
a row in 1911.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bacsik (3-1) won for the first time in five starts, improving
to 3-0 against the Marlins. He gave up five runs and 10 hits in 7 2/3
innings.</TE>
<TE>   A host of low-paid players on the Mets' $104-million payroll led
New York to a five-run cushion before Piazza, who did not start the
second game because of a sore left wrist, hit his 25th homer and
fourth as a pinch-hitter in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Bacsik got his first major league hit, a run-scoring double in the
first, Joe McEwing had two runs batted in, and September callup Jason
Phillips drove in another as the Mets battered Justin Wayne in his
major league debut.</TE>
<TE>   In the first game, Preston Wilson hit a score-tying homer against
Armando Benitez in the ninth, and Juan Encarnacion had a run-scoring
double in the 12th.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 3, Atlanta 0--Salomon Torres made a triumphant return
to the majors, coming within two out of a shutout in his first big
league appearance since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Aramis Ramirez and Craig Wilson homered for the Pirates, who ended
host Atlanta's four-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   The 30-year-old Torres gave up four hits in 8 1/3 innings in front
of 18,931, the smallest crowd in Turner Field history.</TE>
<TE>   Torres, once a top prospect for the Giants, retired after the 1997
season and spent the next three years as a $1,200-per-month pitching
coach for Montreal's affiliate in his native Dominican Republic.</TE>
<TE>   He sat out most of last season, too, beginning his comeback in
earnest when he signed with the Pirates in January.</TE>
<TE>   After honing his game in triple-A, Torres was called up Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 6, San Diego 2--Roy Oswalt dodged a bases-loaded jam in
the sixth inning at San Diego and won his eighth consecutive start.</TE>
<TE>   Oswalt (18-6) was coming off a five-game suspension for throwing a
pitch at Chicago's Alex Gonzalez on Aug. 12.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander started his winning streak July 27 against
Pittsburgh, then won his six starts in August, becoming the fourth
pitcher in Astro history with six victories in a month.</TE>
<TE>   Backed by three double plays, Oswalt gave up one run and eight
hits in seven innings, struck out three and walked one. He improved
to 3-0 with a 1.09 earned-run average in five career appearances
against San Diego, including three starts.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Wagner earned his 31st save in 37 chances.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 7, Philadelphia 6--Brad Wilkerson singled home the
winning run in the bottom of the 10th inning against Terry Adams
(5-9).</TE>
<TE>   With 3,879 on hand at Olympic Stadium, the Expos turned the 11th
triple play in their 34-year history in the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   The triple play began with Marlon Anderson striking out. Placido
Polanco was tagged out in a rundown between first and second on a
steal attempt, and Travis Lee was tagged out when he strayed too far
off third base during the Polanco rundown.</TE>
<TE>   Fernando Tatis hit a three-run homer for Montreal in the second
inning, and Andres Galarraga hit a three-run shot in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 10, Milwaukee 1--Alex Gonzalez and Todd Hundley each hit a
three-run homer, and Matt Clement pitched a six-hitter at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Clement (12-9) threw his third complete game. He struck out seven
and walked three. Clement has won his last three starts and two of
them have been complete games.</TE>

<HD>Williams, Edmonds Lead Cardinals</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Pitcher wins for first time since July and
outfielder hits two-run homer in 3-1 victory over Cincinnati.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Woody Williams, a major reason for the St. Louis Cardinals' playoff
appearance last season, finally made a meaningful contribution to
their stretch drive this year.</LD>
<LD>   Williams won for the first time in more than two months, and Jim
Edmonds hit a two-run home run in the Cardinals' 3-1 victory over the
Cincinnati Reds on Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Edmonds had three runs batted in, and Williams (7-4) gave up one
run and four hits for his first victory since beating San Diego on
July 1.</LD>
<TE>   It was Williams' second start, both against the Reds, since his
second stint on the disabled list this season because of a pulled
muscle in his left side. He was 7-1 the last two months of 2001 after
being acquired in a trade with San Diego, helping the Cardinals
secure the National League wild-card berth.</TE>
<TE>   "It was nice to finally get out there and do something to help the
team, rather than what I did last week and obviously just sitting
around for seven weeks," Williams said. "It just seemed like
everybody was at their best and that's what we need to do the rest of
the way out."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Kline got out of a bases-loaded jam in the eighth, striking
out Barry Larkin and Aaron Boone sandwiched around a walk to Adam
Dunn. Dave Veres got three outs for his fourth save.</TE>
<TE>   At Cincinnati on Thursday, Williams gave up five runs and eight
hits in four innings of a 7-0 loss to Jimmy Haynes in his
second-shortest outing of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Williams has given up three or fewer runs in 20 of his last 21
starts for a 2.14 earned-run average during that span.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was handcuffed at the plate, usually a strength for him.
He is under orders not to swing the bat hard and took some feeble
cuts, going 0 for 2.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the hardest thing for me, to go up there and just stand
like a statue," Williams said. "I know in the long run that's what's
best for me, and I have to bite the bullet."</TE>
<TE>   Edmonds hit his 26th homer, and second in four games, after J.D.
Drew doubled against Haynes (13-9) with two out in the third. Edmonds
had been in a 3-for-17 slump and did not start Monday against
left-hander Shawn Estes.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonds hit a 3-and-1 pitch into the first row in the
left-center-field bleachers as center fielder Reggie Taylor just
missed on a leaping catch. Edmonds had a sacrifice fly in the eighth
against Scott Williamson.</TE>
<TE>   Larkin and Boone doubled in the first to produce Cincinnati's run.
Boone has five RBIs in the first two games of the series.</TE>
<TE>   "When you only score one, you don't win many games," Red Manager
Bob Boone said. "Scoring one [run] don't get it done, that's the
bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   Haynes, who threw eight shutout innings with a season-best seven
strikeouts Thursday, was nearly as effective. In seven innings, he
gave up two runs and seven hits, struck out two and walked one.</TE>
<TE>   "The other pitcher pitched a little bit better," Haynes said.
"I've been pitching pretty good all year, and these last two outings
I may have been pitching better than I have been."</TE>
<TE>   The main thing lacking in his performance the second time around
was offense. Haynes had two hits and a career-best three RBIs last
week, but was 0 for 2 with two groundouts this time.</TE>

<KH>MUNICH OLYMPICS: 30 YEARS LATER</KH>
<HD>Golden Shadow</HD>
<DH>Seven medals and world records made Mark Spitz an icon, and
today he is still swimming's giant</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Spitz was a '70s icon, and if you remember much about that
decade's pop culture, he was one of the decade's two poster children.
The other was Farrah Fawcett. Both were clad in swimsuits, only Spitz
accessorized his with seven gold medals.</LD>
<LD>   It was about the hair too.</LD>
<LD>   She had the hair. He had the hair, and the well-coifed mustache.
His poster remains the best-selling Olympic keepsake. Bruce and Mary
Lou, get in line.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't think of any athlete in any sport 30 years after their
prime who is still the No. 1 in their sport," said John Naber, who
won four gold medals and a silver in the 1976 Olympics. "If you went
up to 100 strangers in a supermarket, and asked about an Olympic
swimmer, 99% of them will name Mark Spitz, if not 100.</TE>
<TE>   "Joe Montana's name will not come up 99%. [Michael] Jordan, give
him another 10 years. Tiger Woods, in 30 years, will not be the name
on everyone's mouth. Mark Spitz is the ultimate name in swimming.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody loves the number seven."</TE>
<TE>   Former USC coach, Peter Daland, who was the men's coach of the
Olympic team in 1972, is 81 years old, but is still clocking times
and walking the pool deck, coaching a Masters team in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take a lot to beat it," he said. "Don't expect it
to happen, not in my life and not in yours."</TE>
<TE>   How his seven gold medals compare to the list of other perhaps
unassailable records--Joe DiMaggio's 56-consecutive game hitting
streak, Wayne Gretzky's goals and points records, or Jack Nicklaus'
number of victories in majors--is not something Spitz really
considers a pertinent comparison.</TE>
<TE>   Daland, for one, thought that setting world records in all seven
races was a much more significant accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   "My success as an athlete was not in an event," Spitz said. "The
DiMaggios, the Williamses, the Tiger Woods and Babe Ruths, it's a
journey through your sports life. The last five, six years of my
sports career was my journey. You don't get recognized for that
journey.</TE>
<TE>   "The last 11 races I ever swam, I had 11 world records. That's
part of that journey."</TE>
<TE>   His accomplishments--gold medals in three relays and four
individual races, all world records, in 1972 at Munich, Germany--cast
a shadow on his envious rivals and jealous teammates, often the same
people. Even years later, his aura seemed to do the same to those
poor new kids in the blocks.</TE>
<TE>   One was Matt Biondi, who, by no fault of his own, became the first
big male American name in swimming after Spitz when he competed at
the 1988 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Spitz wasn't swimming at Seoul, but his long shadow was there.
Even though Biondi was three Olympics removed from the event, he
vividly recalled the pressure during a conversation at the 2000
Sydney Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Biondi, a friend and hundreds of others were packed into a train
compartment--like being jammed into a Speedo--on the way from Darling
Harbor to Homebush Bay, going to the last day of the swim meet. He
started talking on the train about the over-the-top expectations in
1988.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after winning a bronze, Biondi watched television and
learned from the commentator at about the same time as the rest of
the world, that he was a failure for having finished third in the
200-meter freestyle. The words "failed" and "settle" became chiseled
in his memory, and he was willing to tell a reporter, very nicely,
how much the moment hurt him.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind the fact he eventually won five gold medals. The
pride-wounding culprit was NBC, which pointed out that he would not
have a chance to win seven. There was the shadowy, elusive opponent
he, nor anyone else, could ever beat.</TE>
<TE>   "Mark was sort of my nemesis," Biondi says.</TE>
<TE>   The idol understood.</TE>
<TE>   "He [Biondi] was the first person to really have that kind of
comparison pressure," Spitz said, rattling off Biondi's results,
noting that he lost the 100-meter butterfly in Seoul by a hundredth
of a second.</TE>
<TE>   "Stuff can happen. I never had that. I never had to compare myself
with somebody else."</TE>
<TE>   Spitz is compared to no one else but himself. His legacy was so
tough, he couldn't even compete against it when he resurfaced in a
highly publicized comeback for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. He did
not qualify and is now a Los Angeles-area entrepreneur.</TE>
<TE>   His career data is fascinating. All of his international and
national competitions were analyzed during the Sydney Olympics. Just
counting the finals, he said he swam in about 75 races, and recorded
35 world records.</TE>
<TE>   Spitz is proud of that batting average, but don't get him started
on baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "My sport is not recognized from the statistical point as baseball
is looked at. They've got some crazy statistics," he said. "It would
be like saying I was on world-record pace through three laps of four.
Who gives a damn?</TE>
<TE>   "To me, that's just bogus. I almost want to throw up when I hear
statistics like that. Is that what you have to do while you're
waiting around for three hours, talking to people about stuff like
that? Think about it: Mark Spitz was on world-record pace 3,900 times
through two thirds of most of his races.</TE>
<TE>   "But it wasn't to be!"</TE>
<TE>   All joking aside, his lasting Munich fame almost didn't happen.
His last individual race was the 100 freestyle, and Spitz had valid
concerns about his U.S. teammate Jerry Heidenreich, who went faster
than Spitz in his 100 split in the earlier 400 freestyle relay.</TE>
<TE>   Already, Spitz had five gold medals and the last event was
practically a foregone conclusion, the 400 medley relay. For him, a
clean sheet, six gold medals in six races, sounded a lot better than
six gold medals and one silver in seven races.</TE>
<TE>   He seriously thought about skipping the final of the 100
freestyle. His longtime mentor, Sherm Chavoor, coach of the U.S.
women's team, got in his face, giving him a dose of straight talk.</TE>
<TE>   "He [Chavoor] kept saying, 'You'd be chicken if you don't swim
that event,' " Spitz said. "The 100 free is the premier fast event.
If somebody wins the 100 free, they'll be known as the fastest
swimmer in the world. It wouldn't have mattered if you won 17 gold
medals. He said, 'The guy that wins that is the fastest swimmer,
undisputed, plus the fact you're the world record holder, so what are
you doing?' "</TE>
<TE>   Spitz did it, winning in 51.22 seconds, another world record.
Heidenreich was second in 51.65 and the bronze medalist was Vladimir
Bure, the father of hockey star Pavel Bure.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't become great unless you can beat somebody," Spitz said.
"If you only had one person out there in an eight-lane pool winning a
gold medal, it would be relatively meaningless. Somebody like a Jerry
Heidenreich who I competed against was a very motivating factor, and
so was Gary Hall [Sr.]. I had to beat these people."</TE>
<TE>   Spitz acknowledged the importance of his psychological edge in his
swimming days. He had three legendary coaches, Chavoor, George Haines
at the famous Santa Clara Swim Club and Doc Counsilman at Indiana
University. The early psychological architect was Arnold Spitz, who
commuted 80 miles to work each day so his son could train at Santa
Clara.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold apparently was good at removing obstacles. The family rabbi
was told, "Even God likes a winner," when training conflicted with
religious lessons.</TE>
<TE>   According to a Mark Spitz's Web site, the father and son would
routinely have this dialogue:</TE>
<TE>   Arnold: "How many lanes are there in a swimming pool?"</TE>
<TE>   Mark: "Six."</TE>
<TE>   Arnold: "And how many of these lanes win?"</TE>
<TE>   Mark: "One!"</TE>
<TE>   Spitz carried over the theme of self-belief to the current
superstar of swimming, 19-year-old Ian Thorpe of Australia. Thorpe,
who won three Olympic gold medals in Sydney and has set 17 individual
world records, has spawned talk of chasing Spitz's mark of seven gold
in one Olympic Games.</TE>
<TE>   Thorpe won six gold medals this summer at a lesser international
competition, the Commonwealth Games in Manchester, and added a silver
in the 100 backstroke. It was the first time he competed in that race
in about four years.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that adds to Ian's strengths is the same thing
that helped me," Spitz said. "The longer your career lasts, the more
times you can continue to beat your competition. The more I'm
convinced the more they compete against somebody like Ian, they're
arguing among themselves who's going to be first to get second.</TE>
<TE>   "There's this subliminal thing going on. You can't possibly
believe your coach: 'This is going to be the day you're going to beat
Ian Thorpe.' 'I haven't done it, coach, in the last 17 times I
competed against him. Why today is this going to be any different?' "</TE>
<TE>   Spitz first met Thorpe at the 1999 Pan Pacific Swimming
Championships and the youngster quizzed him at great length about his
pre-race routine and preparations during the 1972 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, the legend was suitably impressed before they met. The
first time he spotted Thorpe in the water was at the 1998 World
Championships in Perth, Australia. During the race, Spitz turned to
the man sitting next to him and predicted Thorpe would win.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'He looked up to find out where the guy was so he could
pass him. He did a Mark Sptiz maneuver.' And of course the guy went
on to do exactly that."</TE>
<TE>   Thorpe has repeatedly said that he feels Spitz record won't ever
be broken. Nevertheless, as Thorpe evolved, it will be fascinating
watching his quest at Athens in 2004 and, possibly, Beijing in 2008.</TE>
<TE>   Spitz was almost like a machine that could not be beaten. The
world records were fleeting, as was the acting career in TV and
movies, but the seven gold medals have endured for the last 30 years.
Though he feels Thorpe may be the one to do it, others aren't so
sure.</TE>
<TE>   "None of them [the world records] lasted longer than five years,"
Naber said. "What he did physically was that remarkable, over and
over and over again.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like rolling craps in Las Vegas. He rolled craps seven times
in a row. It's pretty easy to roll the second, the third impressive.
Four, gather a crowd. Fifth, the whole casino is watching. Six in a
row, stop the printing press and watch you throw the seventh."</TE>

<HD>Panthers' Leader Is Old Hand</HD>
<DH>Football: Carolina names Peete to replace Weinke as its
quarterback for opener; he hasn't thrown a regular-season pass since
1999.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He was supposed to be a tutor, a confidant, a behind-the-scenes
sounding board for a young quarterback on the rise.</LD>
<LD>   Instead--suddenly--the ball is in Rodney Peete's hands.</LD>
<LD>   Peete, 36, the former USC star and a 14-year NFL veteran, has been
named Carolina's starting quarterback for the Panthers' opener Sunday
against Baltimore. He replaces Chris Weinke, a second-year player who
is still working on the finer points of a new offense.</LD>
<TE>   The Panthers are the sixth team for Peete, who was Oakland's
third-string quarterback the past two seasons and before that played
for Detroit, Dallas, Philadelphia and Washington. He hasn't thrown a
pass in more than two seasons and last started a game in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "When he left here he wasn't sure what he was going to do," said
his older brother, Skip, running back coach for the Raiders. "He was
talking about retiring. I had mixed feelings about it. I knew if he
was in the right situation at the right time, it would eventually
come his way."</TE>
<TE>   Even though he has made a career of being at the ready at all
times, Rodney Peete said he was "surprised" when coaches informed him
of the move a day earlier. Make that surprised and delighted.</TE>
<TE>   "You play this game to play," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither he nor Weinke was particularly sharp this summer. In four
exhibition games, Weinke completed 59.3% of his passes (35 of 59) for
270 yards with one touchdown and four interceptions. His most recent
game was his worst, a sloppy showing against Cleveland last Friday
when he completed one of three passes for three yards with an
interception returned 47 yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Peete missed much of training camp, first because of a strained
left knee, and later because of the death of his father-in-law and
the birth of his third child. He is married to actress Holly Robinson
Peete.</TE>
<TE>   In two quarters this summer, Peete completed nine of 19 passes for
68 yards with no touchdowns and no interceptions. The Panthers signed
him as a backup because he is a mature, even-keeled veteran who
doesn't require a lot of reps in practice to pick up an offense. They
could have grabbed a starting-caliber quarterback, say Jeff George,
but clearly wanted someone who would not be threatening to Weinke.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I've got enough experience, and once you get in there
for one snap, you feel like you've been in there the whole time," he
said. "Yes, I would have liked to have been totally healthy during
training camp, and, yes, I would have liked to have gotten more snaps
in the preseason. But it didn't work out that way. I've got to deal
with the situation as it is."</TE>
<TE>   Switching quarterbacks at such a late date is familiar ground for
the Panthers, who made then-rookie Weinke the starter 10 days before
last season even though Jeff Lewis started the first three exhibition
games. Weinke made his debut with a victory at Minnesota, throwing
for one touchdown and running for another, then faded as Carolina
lost its next 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   Before playing football at Florida State, where he won the Heisman
Trophy in 2000, Weinke, 30, spent six seasons in the Toronto Blue Jay
organization. (Peete has a connection to the Blue Jays too: the
organization selected him in the 30th round of the 1984 free-agent
draft, but he did not sign.) Weinke's claim to fame in baseball is he
was playing first base for a double-A team in Knoxville, Tenn., when
Michael Jordan got his first professional hit.</TE>
<TE>   Although Weinke rushed for six touchdowns last season, more than
any other NFL quarterback, his passer rating (62.0) was the league's
second-lowest. It didn't help inspire confidence that he missed a
mini-camp and June workouts recovering from shoulder surgery. On top
of that, he was trying to absorb his third offense in three years.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina Coach John Fox, a defensive specialist who replaced fired
George Seifert, has entrusted the Panther offense to Dan Henning, who
has coached dozens of quarterbacks in his 24-year NFL career,
including Joe Theismann and Doug Williams during Washington's Super
Bowl years, and Vinny Testaverde when the Jets advanced to the AFC
championship game in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Henning coached Peete in Detroit and appears more comfortable with
Peete's grasp of the offense than with Weinke's. Normally chatty,
Henning has declined to speak with reporters about the quarterback
change, allowing Fox to do the talking.</TE>
<TE>   "We just haven't produced," Fox said. "I just didn't see the spunk
and the spark in the offense that I know we need to have to win."</TE>
<TE>   Fox went on to say the decision "is not an indictment of Chris
Weinke" and that Weinke "is the quarterback of the future."</TE>
<TE>   All that was little consolation to Weinke, who was informed Sunday
of the switch.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough to swallow when you don't know it's coming," he said.
"I didn't know it was coming. I didn't foresee this. I had no idea."</TE>

<HD>Johnson, Augusta Stinking It Up</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It rained this spring at the Masters, a hard, cleansing Southern
shower that soaked the aging oaks, drenched the colorful azaleas and
stripped the veneer off the most esteemed golf club in America.</LD>
<LD>   Fragrant Augusta National was left basking in a different sort of
smell.</LD>
<LD>   Cow manure.</LD>
<TE>   The grounds outside Butler Cabin stunk like a pasture. Amen Corner
reeked like a county fair.</TE>
<TE>   Those officials daring enough to even recognize the stench quietly
blamed it on floating fertilizer.</TE>
<TE>   I prefer to think of it as the house cologne.</TE>
<TE>   Strip away tradition and legend, and Augusta National becomes just
another overgrown Southern backyard patrolled by good ol' boys in
Wal-Mart blazers.</TE>
<TE>   Take away the band of great golfers who occasionally drop in, and
the chief residents are Hootie and the Blowhards.</TE>
<TE>   This being a private club, its rules should be nobody's business.</TE>
<TE>   But because Augusta National chooses to step on a worldwide stage
for one week a year, hosting a golf tournament that has become a
public institution, those rules become everybody's business.</TE>
<TE>   So when Augusta boss-man Hootie Johnson responds to pressure to
admit the club's first female member by telling women's groups to go
suck on an apron, we should pay attention.</TE>
<TE>   And when he tells the rest of the world to also leave his club
alone, which is what happened when he incredibly canceled more than
$7 million in sponsorships to avoid allowing women to pressure those
companies, we should heed his call.</TE>
<TE>   It's time we leave him alone.</TE>
<TE>   Those who truly care about diversity in society need to stop
caring about the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   The impetus for change is not with Augusta National, which, as a
private club, is under no constitutional responsibility to have its
members behave as humans.</TE>
<TE>   The impetus for change is with us.</TE>
<TE>   CBS should stop televising it. Golf fans should stop watching it.
Golfers should stop playing it.</TE>
<TE>   If Augusta National wants to behave like a private club, fine,
then it should do so in private.</TE>
<TE>   None of which will ever happen, of course.</TE>
<TE>   The noses at CBS are browner than Augusta's sand traps from years
of pandering to the rich rednecks.</TE>
<TE>   Many golf fans are men who feel that women shouldn't be allowed
more than three high-heeled steps from the beverage cart.</TE>
<TE>   And the average golfer thinks equality means everybody gets the
same size courtesy car.</TE>
<TE>   Ignoring Augusta until it blends into the Georgia woods like every
other private club still fighting the Civil War is as silly as trying
to get Tiger Woods to even acknowledge the existence of a Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   But the whole thing still stinks.</TE>
<TE>   For years, public watchdogs have endured Augusta's arrogance under
the notion that if nudged, it would change.</TE>
<TE>   The club didn't allow blacks until 1990. But pressure was applied
and today, of about 300 members, there are four African-Americans.</TE>
<TE>   When there were complaints that the course was too short, they
lengthened it.</TE>
<TE>   When TV viewers asked that the front nine be televised, they
televised it.</TE>
<TE>   Women golfers are allowed on the course like any other invited
guests, even reportedly playing more than 1,000 rounds there last
year.</TE>
<TE>   So what happened this summer when Martha Burk, chairman of the
National Council of Women's Organizations, sent a gentle letter to
the club urging that it open its doors to women?</TE>
<TE>   Hootie Johnson dismissed her with a three-paragraph letter that
sounded as if he was ordering his wife into the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Burk respectfully requested a meeting. Johnson described her
request as "coercive."</TE>
<TE>   Burk urged that membership, while not officially closed to women,
be realistically opened. Johnson termed her request "offensive."</TE>
<TE>   As the chairman of a private club, Johnson had every right to act
so nasty.</TE>
<TE>   But as the curator of what has become a public trust, he should
have been ashamed.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he was not. Hootie was, in fact, quite proud.</TE>
<TE>   Discussing his letter, he claimed he would not integrate the club
"at the point of a bayonet."</TE>
<TE>   Didn't they once use those at Antietam?</TE>
<TE>   Then, on Friday, Johnson glowingly announced he was severing ties
with all sponsors rather than deal with Burk's pressures of
Citigroup, Coca-Cola and IBM.</TE>
<TE>   Didn't some baseball teams once threaten to do the same thing if
forced to host Jackie Robinson?</TE>
<TE>   Oh, but because this is about gender and not race, it's different,
right?</TE>
<TE>   The PGA Tour would not agree. Because of its policy of not
sponsoring tournaments at clubs that discriminate, it could not stage
an event at Augusta National, where the Masters is a privately run
affair.</TE>
<TE>   Some are celebrating that the tournament will now be televised
without commercials.</TE>
<TE>   It would be better to celebrate the day it is televised without
viewers.</TE>
<TE>   In banning women membership and obscenely gesturing to those who
would fight that ban, Augusta National is exercising its right as a
private club.</TE>
<TE>   So when are we going to exercise our rights as a civilized
society?</TE>

<LD>A product of science and sport, Valery Borzov was almost robotic in
his precision.</LD>
<LD>   A long jumper who switched to sprinting at the relatively advanced
age of 17, Borzov was a graduate of the Kiev Institute of Physical
Culture. Working there with a team of mathematicians and scientists,
he studied films of great sprinters from the past as well as his
contemporaries, analyzing techniques for getting out of the blocks
quickly or the best angle at which to incline his body.</LD>
<LD>   His attention to detail paid off at Munich, where he won the 100
and 200 on Sept. 1 and Sept. 4, respectively. He became the first
Soviet runner to win a gold medal in a race under 5,000 meters and
the first sprinter from any nation to win the sprint double since
1956, when Bobby Morrow of the U.S. did it.</LD>
<TE>   In a story headlined, "The Fastest Human is a Commie," Pulitzer
Prize-winning New York Times columnist Red Smith wrote after the 100,
"When the race was over, not one tan hair in the winner's wavy
coiffure was out of place. As befits a clean-cut citizen of the
U.S.S.R., the coiffure was parted to the left."</TE>
<TE>   Smith called the race "mechanically perfect, and in no respect
remarkable."</TE>
<TE>   But Borzov, 22, was no automaton. As Olympic historian David
Wallechinsky noted in his 1984 edition of "The Complete Book of the
Olympics," Borzov had an introspective side.</TE>
<TE>   "I very often have the following urge," Wallechinsky quoted him as
having said. "I suddenly feel on the street that I have to run. I
absolutely have to run, dressed in a suit, wearing my hat and tie,
not paying attention to the passers-by.... Then convention gets the
upper hand and I restrain myself."</TE>
<TE>   He made it clear after the 100 that he was offended by observers
who said his victory was tainted by the absence of U.S. sprinters Rey
Robinson and Eddie Hart, who missed their second-round heats because
U.S. coaches didn't get updated schedule information.</TE>
<TE>   And he had reason. Although Robinson and Hart had tied the world
record of 9.95 seconds months earlier, Borzov was ranked first in the
world in the 100 in 1971 and was the European champion in 1969 and
1971. According to some reports at the time, he, too, was unaware of
his start time and was asleep in the stadium, awakened only when his
heat was called.</TE>
<TE>   "I beat the men who were there," said Borzov, who took the lead
after about 30 meters and had a big enough lead over Robert Taylor--a
third American who had almost missed his heat--to ease up at the
finish. He won in 10.14, ahead of Taylor (10.24) and Lennox Miller of
Jamaica (10.33).</TE>
<TE>   Borzov also held the European title in the 200, and he added the
Olympic title to that by passing Larry Black of the U.S. in the last
65 meters to win in 20.0. Bitter about his treatment after the 100,
he refused to be interviewed after the 200. He also won a silver
medal in the 400 relay.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later, at Montreal, he won a bronze in the 100--with
the same time that had won him gold four years earlier--and bronze in
the 400 relay. He attempted a comeback for the 1980 Moscow Games but
ankle injuries slowed him.</TE>
<TE>   Borzov has been married since 1977 to gymnast Lyudmila
Tourischeva, who won three gold medals, two silver and three bronze
at the 1972 and 1976 Games.</TE>
<TE>   Borzov was the first president of Ukraine's national Olympic
Committee, formed in 1991 after the breakup of the old Soviet Union,
and is Ukraine's minister of youth and sports. He is also president
of Ukraine's athletics federation and since 1994 has been a member of
the International Olympic Committee, for whom he serves on the
Commission for Culture and Olympic Education.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Too bad Sports Illustrated felt it had to jump on the latest movie
device and make up a hot new female tennis prospect. Because women's
tennis doesn't really need a virtual babe in short shorts and a
belly-baring top.</LD>
<LD>   Anybody who pays attention would know the real players have good
stories plus muscles and game.</LD>
<LD>   In this week's SI, there was a story that chronicled the rise of a
17-year-old player from Tashkent. She had a name, Simonya Popova. She
had a digitalized photo. The story and picture apparently fooled some
real sports editors into trying to find Simonya. But this Simonya was
made up, a take off on the movie Simone, which had a virtual female
lead.</LD>
<TE>   What was the point of this fake player? The real flesh and blood
women, the ones wearing cat suits, the ones baring their souls, the
ones with the knee surgeries and tattoos, the women with lives, are
so much more interesting.</TE>
<TE>   Monica Seles beat Martina Hingis in two easy sets Tuesday at the
U.S. Open and then spoke emotionally of watching a replay of her 1991
semifinal against Jennifer Capriati. Seles was 17, with a short
haircut and a baggy outfit. Capriati was 15 and full of youthful
confidence.</TE>
<TE>   It was Seles who won that match, after nearly three hours and
until Monday, when rain forced the players into six hours of doing
nothing but watching TV, Seles said she had never seen a replay of
that thrilling match.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very good!" Seles said. She laughed. A soft laugh, a little
bit of a sad laugh. "I have to look back after this tournament is
over because I definitely did much better than I do now."</TE>
<TE>   Seles may be on the verge of retirement. Whenever her Open is
over, Seles may walk away from the game. She is 28. She has played
through the death of her coach and father and has endured the mental
and physical trauma suffered after being stabbed on the court by a
man who wanted her chief rival, Steffi Graf, to be No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "I was playing very well those two, three years before my
stabbing," Seles said Tuesday. "I guess dominating the sport at that
stage." There is still a catch in Seles's voice when she says
"stabbing."</TE>
<TE>   You can't capture Seles' soul in a virtual girl.</TE>
<TE>   Seles plays Venus Williams tonight in a quarterfinal.</TE>
<TE>   Venus, seeded No. 2, was pushed, prodded and pressured by Chanda
Rubin into three tense sets. Venus wasn't happy with the win but she
should have been.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin played smartly and bravely by moving forward all the time,
coming to the net and volleying. It is a path not taken by many of
Venus' opponents and maybe some will learn from Rubin.</TE>
<TE>   They could also learn from Rubin's path in life. She has not been
deterred by three serious surgeries and she has quietly started her
own grassroots tennis program at two Louisiana schools using her own
money and donating her own time.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of commitment to the game, both on the court and off,
wasn't part of the plastic tennis girl of the magazine.</TE>
<TE>   And our Simonya had no muscles, no bulges, no curves, no form.</TE>
<TE>   Serena Williams, proudly wearing her skin-tight, one-piece and
saying she feels "so free and easy," is into the semifinals. Serena
beat Daniela Hantuchova, 6-2, 6-2, Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of her costumes don't bother Serena. An incarcerated
stalker doesn't bother Serena. "I feel so free and floaty, just
carefree," she said. "I'm just going out there and having fun."</TE>
<TE>   Take that, Simonya. A champion who is having fun, a No. 1 player
who can laugh at herself, at the world. A top-level athlete who
considers "entertainer" as part of her job description.</TE>
<TE>   Serena will play Lindsay Davenport in the semifinals. Davenport
has recently returned from an eight-month retreat after having
serious knee surgery. After beating Elena Bovina, 3-6, 6-0, 6-2,
Davenport became introspective.</TE>
<TE>   "I've started to reflect on things I've gone through," she said.
"I just wanted to play here so badly and do well. It's not to be
emotional or dramatic about it, but just not being able to move my
leg more than 25 degrees for the first few days, fighting just to get
one more degree for the day. Then to come out and still be in the
semifinals of a Grand Slam. It's so emotional."</TE>
<TE>   And this is what makes Davenport a real person and not a Simonya.
She is emotional and she's not sure why.</TE>
<TE>   It is at the start of Week 2 at the Open. It is the time when the
tennis is as entertaining as the clothing, when the points played are
as enthralling as guessing who's a real blond and who's not. All the
women are real here. The game is not in need of virtual babes.</TE>

<LD>Monica Wiesener, ranked No. 10 in Southern California in the girls'
18 division, will not play for Calabasas High this season and is not
enrolled at the school this fall.</LD>
<LD>   Wiesener, a junior, has enrolled in home-schooling by
correspondence through Laurel Springs Academy in Ojai and plans to
concentrate on competition in International Tennis Federation and
Challenger-level tournaments this year.</LD>
<LD>   "I really want to do this and make a go of it," Wiesener
said."I've been playing in a lot of tournaments and doing really well
lately, and if I want to keep it up, I won't really have time for
school."</LD>
<TE>   Wiesener advanced to the round of 16 in the Southern Section
individual tournament each of the last two seasons. She helped the
Coyotes reach the Division IV team finals in 2000 and semifinals last
year.</TE>

<LD>Harold Kromer is what baseball people call a "wily veteran with the
smarts to get the job done," so he's still pitching while the
wunderkinds have come and gone.</LD>
<LD>   Once in a while a young one will catch his eye, like Harlie Lunke
on Tuesday morning on an Anaheim diamond in Marshall Park, and as raw
as this one appeared, it was obvious Lunke might have the
determination to make it to the next level.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm serious about this," said Lunke, who has been spending his
own money at an amusement park to hit 40-to-60 balls a day in the
batting cage. "I throw a ball against a wall to strengthen my arm,
run and lift. I want to make it."</LD>
<TE>   Lunke is 79. His goal is to make the local 80-and-over softball
team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KROMER IS 86, and looks two years younger than sports editor Bill
Dwyre. He pitched nine innings for the Dodgers in a 23-3 victory on
an unusually warm Tuesday morning, and he will be 87 next month. "As
long as the widow down the block doesn't find out I'm really 87, I'll
be just fine," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Babe Ruth dived for a foul ball in the stands just a row or two
from where Kromer was sitting in Yankee Stadium. He recently filled
out medical paperwork, and when the nurse said he must have made some
kind of mistake, he said, "No, that's correct. I had one surgery in
1999 and the other in 1919."</TE>
<TE>   He married his wife after the last World War, and next week will
mark the 30th anniversary of her death. "You can imagine how young
she was when she died," he said. "I know she would have really
enjoyed these softball games."</TE>
<TE>   It would have also given him the chance to show off for his bride,
not only winning the game, but making the play of the day.</TE>
<TE>   In the third inning, the Downey Dizzy Deans' Ron Cunningham lined
a shot directly up the middle only to have Kromer reach out with the
quickness you wouldn't even expect from Andy Ashby. I haven't seen
anything like that since the last time someone tried walking past
Dwyre with a tray full of Krispy Kremes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW I can't recall the last time I had as much fun watching the
Dodgers. In the first, the Deans' No. 2 hitter hit a ball to right
field and beat the throw to first. Eric Karros would be considered
Carl Lewis in this league. It took two more singles to the outfield
and a sacrifice fly to creak a run home for the Deans, and then
82-year-old hurler Frank Russell took the mound to oppose the
Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "We call him, 'Russell McNasty,' " said one of his teammates after
Russell began yelling at his third baseman for failing to make a tag.
Then he had words for his manager, Roger LeClaire, who just laughed.</TE>
<TE>   Between innings I asked Russell if he was the Deans' version of
Kevin Brown, and he blew me off.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW ANYONE who has ever been to a Little League game knows the
most-repeated thing you hear after "hey batter-batter," is "hustle in
and hustle out" between innings. There is no hustle in senior slow
pitch.</TE>
<TE>   There are exceptions, though. Lunke, the eager kid trying to make
the 80-year-old roster, jogged everywhere like he was auditioning for
the lead role in "Pete Rose, The Later Years."</TE>
<TE>   "I played baseball in my 20s, but not since then," said Lunke, who
also goes ballroom dancing two-to-four times a week with a younger
partner. "You know, the recreation department has some great dance

<TE>   "Is your boss old enough to play in the 65-and-older league?"
Deans' first baseman Doug Oatman said.</TE>
<TE>   "Does acting like he's 65 count?"</TE>

<TE>   KROMER PROBABLY threw more than 100 pitches in Tuesday's heat and
looked as if he could have thrown another 100, which he will do today
when his 65-and-older team plays, and then again Thursday when his
70-and-older team plays.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't just sit at home," he said. "I don't understand people
who do."</TE>
<TE>   He also won't take a drink of water, and hasn't since 1949, and
while that's the first time I've ever heard something like that, I
can't recall the last 86-year-old pitcher I ever interviewed who has
better stuff than Kazuhisa Ishii.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up in Long Island and the water was great," he said. "We
moved near Brooklyn, and it was terrible, so I stopped drinking the
water. Never missed it."</TE>
<TE>   When the temperature topped 100 at a recent tournament, teammate
Ray Thien watched Kromer, "and never once did he take a drink of
anything."</TE>
<TE>   So much for thinking the guy has tapped into the fountain of
youth.</TE>
<TE>   "If I get thirsty, I eat a piece of fruit," he said, and for 30
years I've been pushing myself away from the wife's cooking and
getting in trouble when it appears now I was saving my life. "I read
an article recently where someone from Dartmouth said drinking eight
glasses of water a day is baloney. I could've told them that."</TE>
<TE>   Now the Angels and Dodgers, who play for money, were out of town
Tuesday, but no complaints here after watching Kromer &amp; Co. compete
with such zest. Some things just never get old.</TE>

<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Jason Elander:</TE>

call you names? Come on, don't be a jerk."</TE>
<TE>   All you had to do was say the magic word.</TE>

<HD>Ruiz Leads Galaxy Into Title Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since Carlos Ruiz is already leading Major League Soccer in scoring
this season, why shouldn't the Galaxy rookie forward have the same
level of success in the U.S. Open Cup?</LD>
<LD>   Ruiz was involved in three of the Galaxy's four goals Tuesday
night to lead his team to a 4-1 victory over the Dallas Burn in a
U.S. Open Cup semifinal match at Cal State Fullerton's Titan Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   And his goal and two assists in front of 3,132 gave Ruiz nine
points in the tournament to tie him with Johnny Menyongar of the
A-League's Minnesota Thunder for the tourney lead.</LD>
<TE>   "It was an emotional time before the game and we knew we had to
have a strong effort on the field," said Ruiz, who has 41 points and
20 goals in MLS play. "We were ready to win it on the field."</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy, the defending U.S. Open Cup champion, is riding an
eight-game winning streak in the tournament and goalkeeper Matt Reis
has given up one goal in three games.</TE>
<TE>   Reis had six saves against Dallas and, until surrendering an 89th
minute goal to Dallas forward Ronald Cerritos, he had not given up a
goal in 280 minutes of Open Cup play this year.</TE>
<TE>   In attempting to become the first Open Cup champion to repeat
since the New York Pancyprian-Freedoms of the Cosmopolitan Soccer
League in 1982-83 and the eighth team to win consecutive titles since
the tournament began in 1914, the Galaxy will meet either the Kansas
City Wizards or Columbus Crew--who play their semifinal next
Tuesday--in the title match on Oct. 26 or 27.</TE>
<TE>   If Columbus wins, it would probably play host to the title game.
Because the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs play at Arrowhead Stadium that
weekend, the Galaxy would get the home game if the Wizards win.</TE>
<TE>   Having advanced to the Open Cup title game, the Galaxy is
guaranteed at least $50,000, to be split evenly among team members,
as the tournament runners-up receive that much and the champions get
$100,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy's first goal came in the 11th minute when Ruiz received
a short pass from Sasha Victorine in the middle of the field. Ruiz
won the ball, spun around and fired a hard shot from 30 yards out
that went into the upper right corner.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy went up 2-0 six minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   Ezra Hendrickson headed a Victorine pass to Ruiz, who left a slow
rolling ball for an onrushing Mauricio Cienfuegos. The playmaking
midfielder's low line drive of a shot from 17 yards out went into the
bottom right corner of the net.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy's third goal came in the 34th minute when Ruiz led Cobi
Jones on the left side and Jones, Dallas defender Ryan Suarez and
goalkeeper Matt Jordan converged on the ball in the goalkeeper's box.
Suarez got a foot on the ball but his tackle resulted in the ball
ricocheting off Jones and into the goal.</TE>
<TE>   Simon Elliott finished off the Burn when he converted a penalty
kick in the 81st minute after Cienfuegos was pulled down in the box
by Paul Broome.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Gutierrez</TE>
<TE>   Keane Has Surgery</TE>
<TE>   Manchester United captain Roy Keane underwent hip surgery and
won't play for about six weeks, during which time he will serve a
suspension.</TE>
<TE>   Keane, 31, missed United's 1-0 win against Middlesbrough on
Tuesday to have the operation. His recovery is set to coincide with a
suspension after his red card for elbowing Sunderland's Jason McAteer
last Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect him to be out six weeks," United Coach Sir Alex
Ferguson told Sky Sports. "We had thought it was going to be three
months."</TE>
<TE>   Keane was sent home from Ireland's World Cup team eight days
before the tournament after a falling out with Coach Mick McCarthy.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo Not Ready</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo, who has been dogged by knee problems and muscle strains
the last two years, can't yet begin training with Real Madrid because
he has a thigh muscle injury.</TE>
<TE>   The 25-year-old Brazilian, who joined European champion Real from
Inter Milan on Saturday for $46.3 million, told a news conference
he'll be able to exercise again "in the coming days."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors have blamed the injuries on nerves.</TE>

<HD>Sparks' New Goal Has Familiar Ring</HD>
<DH>WNBA: Players celebrate second title by promising another
one next season. Team officials hope to improve squad's depth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The only things shining brighter than the sun Tuesday at the
Hollywood &amp; Highland shopping center were the smiles of the Sparks,
basking in the adulation of fans after winning their second
consecutive WNBA championship.</LD>
<LD>   This was one of the public celebrations of the Sparks' dramatic
69-66 victory over the New York Liberty on Saturday to close out the
season. There will be another next May, when they receive their
championship rings.</LD>
<LD>   In between, the team has to look for ways to bring about the
"three-peat" it promised fans during the 55-minute ceremony.</LD>
<TE>   "Of course it will be harder to take it a third time," club
President Johnny Buss said. "As this league grows in competitive
spirit and physical play, we expect it to be extremely hard next
year. We have to keep up and always think ahead."</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks' core group is still in its prime, but the team has
some needs.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll look to do what other teams do," Coach Michael Cooper said.
"We'll see what [veterans] they discard if they want to go young and
see if they can help us. But we've got some time, so we probably
won't be making moves until the end of the college season."</TE>
<TE>   Cooper wants another guard or forward who can reduce the workloads
on Mwadi Mabika and Tamecka Dixon.</TE>
<TE>   They may have that player now. Rosalind Ross, their first-round
draft choice from Oklahoma last year, had knee surgery and missed the
season but will be given a long look at the 2003 training camp.</TE>
<TE>   "If Rosalind's OK, I think we'll be fine," General Manager Penny
Toler said. "She would definitely be better than anything we could
get [with the 16th pick in the next draft]."</TE>
<TE>   Cooper would also like another big forward or center to back up
Lisa Leslie in case any of his reserve players, like the promising
but raw Brazilian Erika Desouza, choose not to return.</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, the 2003 draft will offer nowhere near the talent
as the draft did last spring. Vanderbilt center Chantelle Anderson,
6-6, is envisioned by many as the next franchise player, but most
WNBA general managers have difficulty naming other college seniors
who figure to have immediate impacts.</TE>
<TE>   That's OK with the Sparks, who traded their first-round pick to
Miami for Marlies Askamp.</TE>
<TE>   There are players to sign, among them two-time playoff MVP Leslie,
but the league deals with player contracts. Buss has to worry about
keeping Cooper, who has received attention from some NBA teams
recently, most notably Denver. His contract with the Sparks expires
after next season.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll do whatever Michael wants," Buss said. "If we can sign him
forever, we'll do that. If he has plans to go to the NBA, more power
to him. But if he wants to stay with the Sparks, we'll sign him
accordingly."</TE>
<TE>   The players will be busy in the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie, Dixon and DeLisha Milton will play with the USA national
team at the FIBA World Championships in China, beginning Sept. 14.</TE>
<TE>   After the 16-team FIBA tournament, Milton and Mabika will be
playing in a Russian league.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be on opposite teams; I hope I don't have to guard her,"
Milton said of Mwadi.</TE>
<TE>   Other Sparks considering foreign leagues include Vedrana
Grgin-Fonseca (France), Sophia Witherspoon (Europe or Korea) and
Latasha Byears.</TE>
<TE>   Askamp is headed back to her native Germany to spend time with her
family--her mother died just before the season started--and is
considering retiring from the WNBA.</TE>
<TE>   Nikki Teasley needs to complete a couple classes to graduate from
North Carolina in December. She said she would return to Los Angeles
in January for workouts.</TE>
<TE>   After the World Championships, Leslie will pursue opportunities to
model and is considering new endorsement deals.</TE>
<TE>   The league has to work out a new collective bargaining agreement
with the players' union. The current contract expires Sept .15.</TE>
<TE>   So, there will be a lot going on between now and next May, when
the Sparks go for title No. 3.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we can win with what we have," Milton said. "Even though
the league is getting better every year, so are the Sparks. You taste
the sweetness of success, and you want it again."</TE>

<HD>Pressing Onward</HD>
<DH>Stevens reluctantly steps into spotlight, hoping to lead
Peninsula back to top</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Craig Stevens doesn't know what to say.</LD>
<LD>   It's the first day of practice for the Rolling Hills Estates
Peninsula High football team, and somehow Stevens has been thrust
into the spotlight for the Panthers.</LD>
<LD>   Stevens, a 6-foot-4, 240-pound senior tight end, doesn't know how
that came about. Up to and including his freshman year, Stevens
played soccer. The only football experience he had was in sandlot
pickup games.</LD>
<TE>   "Not even Pop Warner," Stevens said.</TE>
<TE>   Even his experience with the Panthers is limited. He played
sparingly as a sophomore and missed five games last season with a
broken collarbone.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he's made enough of an impression to attract interest from
colleges in conferences such as the Pacific 10, Big 12 and Big 10.
Impressive speed--a 4.7-second, 40-yard dash--and strength--he holds
the school record with a 300-pound power clean--made him stand out at
summer camps and recruiting combines.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens must back that up with a solid senior season and live up
to expectations.. He also must lead a Peninsula team that has only
six senior starters, even though he is relatively raw.</TE>
<TE>   He speaks timidly during an interview and leaves his helmet on
while giving short, nondescript answers. Pressed, he explains.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not really that quiet, I'm just not used to this," he said.
"I mean, I'm thankful for the attention. I guess I just don't know
how to deal with it."</TE>
<TE>   Peninsula Coach Tony Uruburu warns not to judge Stevens' on-field
ability by his off-field demeanor. His size and strength make him a
menace to opposing teams trying to stop Peninsula's running game.
Uruburu said Stevens' blocking ability is unparalleled, his hands
soft for a big man and his tenacity unquestionable, no matter how
calm he acts.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not one of those loud, goofy teenagers," Uruburu said. "He's
real low key, doesn't look for attention, but he's the real deal.
Everybody that needs to know about him, knows about him."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Peninsula went 3-7--the first losing season since the
school opened in 1991. The Panthers, Southern Section Division II
champions in 1997 and semifinalists twice since, did not make the
playoffs last season for the first time in school history. In the
four years leading into last season, Peninsula lost a combined seven
games.</TE>
<TE>   "No one likes that feeling," Stevens said. "It gives me motivation
to work harder."</TE>
<TE>   In hopes of turning the team around, Uruburu plans on adding some
wrinkles to its option offense based on the ability of his tight end.</TE>
<TE>   "We spent a lot of time this summer figuring out ways to get him
the ball," Uruburu said. "It can be a weapon having a guy that big,
especially in high school football."</TE>
<TE>   Stevens will also take a crack on defense for the first time as a
starting linebacker. He hopes that by playing both ways, he can play
a bigger part in helping a proud program rebound from a down year.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want that to happen again," he said. "I don't even want
to think about that. I guess we have a lot to prove."</TE>

<LD>The Boost Mobile Pro Presented by Billabong, the only Assn. of
Surfing Professionals World Championship Tour event being held this
year on the U.S. mainland, will begin Thursday at Lower Trestles near
San Clemente.</LD>
<LD>   The contest will be run over five days, with Saturday being a lay
day. Organizers had anticipated a Sunday start but moved the dates up
to take advantage of large waves already being generated by Hurricane
Hernan off Baja California.</LD>
<LD>   With another big swell expected to arrive Saturday or Sunday, the
contest promises to be exciting for athletes and spectators. Andy
Irons of Princeville, Kauai, is the world's top-rated surfer with
seven WCT events remaining. The top local surfers are Pat O'Connell

<HD>Revival Act Keeps Rolling</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Resurgent Sampras topples third-seeded Haas in four
sets to reach U.S. Open quarterfinals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>This was the place where it all began for Pete Sampras 12 years ago,
so it certainly makes sense that the U.S. Open has become a source of
rejuvenation since Wimbledon has not been restorative lately.</LD>
<LD>   Loud, noisy, disruptive New York and a cool, calm champion are
turning into quite the odd couple. It's happening again, a re-Pete,
of sorts.</LD>
<LD>   Greg Rusedski certainly didn't understand when he lost to Sampras
in the third round and criticized him, saying he had lost a step and
a half, and that he would not put money on him beating Tommy Haas of
Germany.</LD>
<TE>   Sampras, a finalist here last year, reached the quarterfinals of a
Grand Slam for the first time in 2002, serving 27 aces and defeating
the third-seeded Haas, 7-5, 6-4, 6-7 (5), 7-5, in 3 hours 5 minutes
on Tuesday at the U.S. Open. The 17th-seeded Sampras will face No. 11
Andy Roddick in the quarterfinals on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope it's a nightmare for [Roddick]," Sampras said, smiling.
"He's the future of the game, especially in the U.S. It's kind of an
older veteran playing against the younger guy."</TE>
<TE>   The glee he had in beating Rusedski on Monday was replaced by
quiet, almost subdued focus. Against Haas, the serve saved Sampras,
who admitted he was tiring quickly under heavy conditions and matches
on consecutive days.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, Sampras was asked about Rusedski's critical comments.
Had the 31-year-old, as Rusedski suggested, lost a step and a half?</TE>
<TE>   "Against [Rusedski] I don't need to be a step and a half quicker,"
Sampras said. His match was the fitting finale of a long day, and
longer night, of All-American surprises, seeming like an assembly
line of surprises.</TE>
<TE>   There was Chanda Rubin playing the best match against Venus
Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin had two break points in the 11th game of the third set, but
the second-seeded and two-time defending champion survived the
fourth-round match, beating No. 14 Rubin, 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, in 1 hour 53
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who had not lost a set here since the semifinals in
2000, was highly displeased. She went out and practiced with her
father Richard for about 20 minutes after her match.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking a little bit, this is how I used to play back in
'98, back in the day," Williams said. "I don't like to go backward to
those times."</TE>
<TE>   Rubin is one of the few players who doesn't appear to be
intimidated against either Venus or Serena. In fact, Rubin stopped
Serena's 21-match winning streak by defeating her at Manhattan Beach
last month on her way to the title.</TE>
<TE>   And there was Andy Roddick's aching body holding together for
another day. Roddick, who was suffering from inflammation of the left
foot, needed treatment from the trainer after losing the first set
against Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as it often happens with Roddick, he turned into a new
player and something of a character, urging on the crowd, arguing
with the chair umpire and, most important, making the shot of the
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   It came in the second set and changed the tenor of the match,
unraveling Chela's psyche. In the seventh game, Roddick chased down a
drop shot, raced back to retrieve a lob, quickly changing directions
to do it, and finally won the point with a backhand passing shot down
the line. He dropped his racket and used his frenzied momentum to
propel himself in the stands, yelling and high-fiving a couple of
fans.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really remember it too well because it was all reaction,"
said Roddick, who won, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. "It wasn't like I was in
control of anything out there. I think it helped turn things around."</TE>
<TE>   Then there was No. 4 Lindsay Davenport, who was thrilled to reach
the semifinals, after missing nearly nine months because of an
injured knee and surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport defeated unseeded Elena Bovina of Russia, 3-6, 6-0, 6-2,
in the quarterfinals, winning seven consecutive games at one point,
and will play No. 1 Serena Williams. But she wasn't ready to look
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "The last few weeks I was really happy to be playing," Davenport
said. "I got away from the fact how far I really have come."</TE>
<TE>   And, finally, there was No. 6 Monica Seles, who defeated wild-card
entry Martina Hingis of Switzerland, 6-4, 6-2, in the fourth round,
and will play Venus Williams in the quarterfinals tonight.</TE>
<TE>   But, as evidenced by Tuesday, Venus is not playing the best tennis
in her family. That honor goes to Serena, who had 12 aces in an
impressive 6-2, 6-2 quarterfinal victory against No. 11 Daniela
Hantuchova of Slovakia.</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>Guard Lehmann Suspended</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Another day, another rationalization offered by UCLA coaches for
another fight involving a player.</LD>
<LD>   Junior guard Shane Lehmann pleaded no contest Tuesday to a
misdemeanor battery charge stemming from an incident that occurred in
May outside Madison's Neighborhood Grill, the same Westwood
establishment where cornerback Ricky Manning Jr. got into a fight in
April that resulted in felony charges.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-foot-5, 285-pound Lehmann, who started five games last
season and is currently second-string behind Steve Vieira, was
charged with felony battery and agreed to the no contest plea instead
of going to trial. He was sentenced to three years probation and 30
days of community service.</LD>
<TE>   In keeping with team policy, Coach Bob Toledo suspended Lehmann
for Saturday's opener against Colorado State because of the
conviction. However, the coach's explanation of events made it
curious that Lehmann pleaded no contest, which is the equivalent of a
guilty plea in criminal court.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy threw a punch and [Shane] threw a punch back," Toledo
said. "I believe there was an [off-duty] sheriff there who saw the
incident and said Shane was innocent."</TE>
<TE>   A manager at Madison's said that Lehmann had been employed as a
bouncer but had resigned before the night of the incident, which
occurred in an adjacent parking lot after Lehmann, 21, and an
employee had escorted someone from the bar.</TE>
<TE>   Neither UCLA nor Madison's would divulge the identity of the
victim or the nature of his injuries. Lehmann, who was cited two
years ago for using false identification, was not made available for
comment. His attorney, William A. Bartz, did not return calls.</TE>
<TE>   Lehmann has a groin injury and was listed as questionable for the
opener, raising the question of whether the suspension was
meaningful. But Toledo said trainers had cleared Lehmann to play.</TE>
<TE>   "He was questionable anyway, but now he's suspended," Toledo said.
"We've got 100-and-something football players and 100 of them are
doing a darn good job. We are preparing to play a football game and
aren't going to be distracted."</TE>
<TE>   Three players, however, have pending court dates pertaining to
fights. Manning, a two-time All-Pacific 10 Conference selection, will
be arraigned Sept. 17 on felony assault charges and could face 11
years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Junior defensive end Asi Faoa has been convicted of misdemeanor
assault and was sentenced a year ago to 180 days in jail. He has yet
to serve the time and will appear in court Sept. 11 to arrange work
furlough.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman defensive end C.J. Niusulu faces felony battery charges
for allegedly punching an employee at a drive-in theater in his
hometown of Barstow in July.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, senior linebacker Audie Attar was dismissed from the
team during the summer after punching the younger brother of former
Bruin quarterback Scott McEwan at Westwood Brewing Company.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo said he has banned players from Madison's and forbade them
from working anywhere as bouncers.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a great idea," senior tackle Mike Saffer said. "No one
needs to work as a bouncer and put themselves in harm's way. And
nobody should be going to a place like that during the season for any
reason.</TE>
<TE>   "Shane did hit somebody and he has to be accountable. It's
obviously disturbing that there have been so many fights. But it's
important to remember that both Shane and Ricky did this last spring.
We've known about it and both of them were punished by our coaches at
the time."</TE>
<TE>   Bruin players and coaches just hope this is the last violent
incident associated with the team.</TE>
<TE>   "To my knowledge, this is it," Toledo said. "There is nothing else
that I am aware of."</TE>

<KH>USC REPORT</KH>
<HD>Carroll Sees Hope for Running Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC hoped to unleash an improved running game Monday against Auburn,
but the numbers told an old, downtrodden story:</LD>
<LD>   * The Trojans rushed for 84 yards, worse than last season's 87.7
average.</LD>
<LD>   * They averaged 2.3 yards per carry, worse than last season's 2.55
average.</LD>
<TE>   By falling short of those barrel-scraping levels, USC showed it
still has a long way to go before entertaining any thought of having
a balanced offense this season.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Coach Pete Carroll was cautiously optimistic that the Trojans
could correct the mistakes they made in Monday's 24-17 victory and
get the ground game in better shape for their next game, Sept. 14 at
Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll pointed to three factors that slowed USC against Auburn.
Senior tailback Sultan McCullough, who got the bulk of the carries,
is still not at full speed after suffering from hamstring problems;
the offensive line is not at full strength because of injuries; and
senior Justin Fargas, perhaps the team's best tailback, sat out the
opener because of a strained hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said Fargas will use this week to get sound and hopefully
be able to practice at full speed Tuesday. The Trojans, who took
Tuesday off, resume practice today.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really counting on him playing against Colorado," Carroll
said. "He gives us a little more punch because of his great speed and
attack at the line of scrimmage."</TE>
<TE>   USC ran 37 times, most successfully late in the game, and
attempted 32 passes against Auburn.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a good mix," Carroll said. "They'll be games when we'll be
running over 40 times."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Several freshmen contributed to USC's victory, a fact that pleased
Carroll.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kind of excited about it," he said. "We need them to grow and
be part of things. [After Monday], they won't be as big-eyed the next
time."</TE>
<TE>   Cornerback Justin Wyatt, who was playing for Compton Dominguez
High at this time last year, played the entire second half after
starter Ronald Nunn suffered a hip injury. Wyatt helped the Trojans
shut down Auburn's limited passing game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Mike Patterson, a 6-foot, 285-pound sophomore,
led USC with eight tackles, most coming in the second half when the
Trojans held Auburn to 35 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very quick off the ball in the second half," Carroll said.
"He made a couple of adjustments, found himself in the backfield and
caused some problems. His leverage and quickness made it hard for
[Auburn] to block him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outside linebacker Matt Grootegoed and reserve safety Sandy
Fletcher suffered mild concussions against Auburn and are listed as
day to day.... Senior guard Zach Wilson is still recovering from a
sprained arch and is questionable for the Colorado game.</TE>

<HD>No Sure Bet for Wisconsin Faithful</HD>
<DH>Gambling: When lights went out on Saturday's game in Las
Vegas, so did any hope of a winning wager for Badger followers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>There was a sea of red in this gambling mecca last weekend, but it
wasn't necessarily the color of Wisconsin fans' apparel. It was the
color of their faces.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of Badger football fans were outraged that Saturday's
Wisconsin-Nevada Las Vegas game was called with 7:41 left and the
Badgers holding a 27-7 lead.</LD>
<LD>   Wisconsin, a six-or seven-point favorite at most sports books at
kickoff, was 2:41 from an apparent victory against the betting line
when the lights went out at Sam Boyd Stadium because of an equipment
failure at a power riser.</LD>
<TE>   College and pro football games are not official in Nevada sports
books unless 55 minutes of play is completed.</TE>
<TE>   After Wisconsin Coach Barry Alvarez and UNLV Coach John Robinson
agreed to call the game after the first 15 minutes of delay, Badger
fans flocked to casinos to collect what they believed were winning
wagers, only to find out differently.</TE>
<TE>   All wagers were refunded.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a bunch of Cheesehead fans that were outraged, saying the
fix is in, that this could only happen in Vegas," said Ed Malinowski,
race and sports supervisor at the Luxor hotel. "They didn't want to
hear they didn't win their money."</TE>
<TE>   Complaints continued Sunday as Wisconsin bettors showed up at
casinos with wagering tickets in hand.</TE>
<TE>   "It stinks of Vegas chicanery," said Craig Johnson, 40, who wore a
red Wisconsin T-shirt as he received his $300 bet refund from the Las
Vegas Hilton. "I figured it was an official game, but Vegas is going
to rip off Wisconsin people from their winnings."</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin was a three-point favorite at most sports books when the
line opened Aug. 26, but the spread moved dramatically because of
heavy wagering on the Badgers.</TE>
<TE>   Malinowski declined to specify how much money was bet on Wisconsin
but said "there was a lot of it."</TE>
<TE>   Malinowski said it takes about $2,000 to $4,000 to move a college
football spread a half-point at the Luxor. Using that math, the Luxor
had between $10,000 and $20,000 more money wagered on Wisconsin than
UNLV.</TE>
<TE>   The Luxor is one of about 140 sports books in Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Arseneau, 23, figured he won his $20 bet when Wisconsin took
a 27-7 lead on a field goal with 7:57 left.</TE>
<TE>   "People were already celebrating their money," said Arseneau, who
wore a white Wisconsin polo shirt as he collected his bet refund at
the Luxor. "I was like, 'I won ... who wants a round [of drinks] on
me?' Then they take the money out of our pockets."</TE>
<TE>   Nevada casinos have been able to handle bets on UNLV and Nevada
games since February 2001, when the Nevada Gaming Commission adopted
a rule that ended a ban on such wagering.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the Nevada Gaming Control Board said there are
no plans to review the rule based on Saturday's blackout.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have any reason to believe [foul play]," Joanie Jacka
said. "It's just a power failure."</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin bettors were paid in full on some offshore Web sites
that have different rules than Nevada casinos.</TE>
<TE>   A 49-year-old lawyer who wagered $350 on the Badgers through the
Internet and $550 at the Las Vegas Hilton said the Internet wager was
paid but the Hilton wager was refunded.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a 'Sopranos' episode," said the lawyer, a Wisconsin alum
who requested anonymity. "All the money came in on Wisconsin and the
casinos were going to take a hit. It's just a little too
coincidental."</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the power failure was blamed on a vehicle that crashed
into a transformer near the stadium. But Tuesday, UNLV officials said
the 9 p.m. outage was caused by a failing power riser about 1 1/2
miles away, a condition unrelated to the car accident.</TE>
<TE>   "We giggle when we hear the conspiracy theory ... this [power
riser] isn't something you can just go unplug," said Daren Libonati,
director of UNLV's athletic facilities. "Nevada Power has made it
clear that we had some serious issues there. We did not get power
back until 4:02 a.m. [Sunday]."</TE>
<TE>   Malinowski called the blackout "bizarre" and said the only
comparable event for gamblers was Robin Ventura's 15th-inning grand
slam for the New York Mets in Game 5 of the 1999 National League
Championship Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   The hit was later ruled a single after the on-field celebration
prevented Ventura from advancing past third. The final score was
reduced from 5-3 to 4-3. Most Las Vegas sports books had an
over-under line--the total runs to be scored in a game--at 7 1/2
runs.</TE>
<TE>   The announced crowd of 42,075 at Sam Boyd Stadium, about half of
which was Wisconsin fans, was the largest to attend a team sport
event in Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone left Las Vegas with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   "What can I really do, take it up with the Nevada gaming
commissioner?" Arseneau said. "We're happy to be here, but we would
have been happier if we won money."</TE>
