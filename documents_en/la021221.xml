<HD>The radio as rabbit hole: Alice comes to KCRW</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Carney</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The premise sounds as nonsensical as anything from the pen of Lewis
Carroll: a storybook's extraordinary illustrations prompting the
creation of a play for radio.</LD>
<LD>   But the contemporary art by DeLoss McGraw in the 2001 edition of
"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" made the book so popular among
listeners when KCRW-FM (89.9) gave it away as a premium last year
that station management decided to stage a dramatic reading of the
classic children's story. The two-hour trip down the rabbit hole will
air from 2 to 4 p.m. on Christmas Eve, and at the same time on New
Year's Eve.</LD>
<LD>   "Given the kind of station we are, we thought it was a suitable
Christmas offering. It's edgy. It's unconventional. It's arch and
it's playful," said KCRW general manager Ruth Seymour. "There's no
sentimentality about this. It's just very crisp. It's mad."</LD>
<TE>   Seymour said it was a daunting undertaking. "After all, you're
taking on a classic," she said, and "many of us have not looked at it
since we were children."</TE>
<TE>   She said director Louis Fantasia and his star-studded cast have
created an "Alice" meant to appeal to both children and adults.</TE>
<TE>   "I think children will read it naively, in the best sense of that
word," said Fantasia, who also reviews theater for KCRW. Meanwhile,
adults may appreciate not only the fantastic situations but also the
subtle, acerbic humor.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Shearer, who among many other pursuits has hosted "Le Show"
on KCRW for 20 years, narrates the tale.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a perfect Harry Shearer story. He has that humor himself,"
Seymour said. "He's such a wonderful storyteller, and he's got that
great radio voice."</TE>
<TE>   Alice is played by 26-year-old Vinessa Shaw, who has appeared in
such movies as "40 Days and 40 Nights," "Corky Romano" and "Eyes Wide
Shut." Seymour said the actress ensures that the title character
comes across as youthful but not childish.</TE>
<TE>   "Alice is a very sophisticated little girl," Seymour said. "Alice
is a skeptic, and she constantly gets into situations where she's
appalled by the people around her."</TE>
<TE>   Fantasia said he wanted an independent Alice, on a trip of
self-discovery. "In the more traditional reading of the story, she
seems to be the good girl doing what she's told." He said he also
took care not to make the production overly broad or surreal, instead
letting the wordplay and curious situations speak for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "We have alienated a lot of the Lewis Carroll fan club. It's not
English enough," he said. "I didn't want to make the English garden
variety again."</TE>
<TE>   "That's precisely why I was interested in being part of it," said
actor Michael York, who plays the Red King. "The perfect BBC version
-- we've seen all of those."</TE>
<TE>   To further set it apart, Fantasia said he consciously featured a
cast heavy in Americans, which also set up a collision between York
and the other Britons in the royal court and Alice, who, he said,
doesn't "surrender to English propriety."</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the cast includes Joe Spano as the March Hare, Hector
Elizondo as the Mad Hatter, Rhea Perlman as the Dormouse, Julia
Migenes as the Red Queen, Malcolm McDowell as the Gryphon, Orson Bean
as the Mock Turtle and John Rubenstein as the White Rabbit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd listen to the thing just to hear Elliott Gould play the
Cheshire cat," York said.</TE>
<TE>   "Simpsons" actors Yeardley Smith (Lisa) and Dan Castellaneta
(Homer) play the Mouse and the Dodo, respectively. Even KCRW public
affairs host Warren Olney gets a line.</TE>
<TE>   Seymour said the story was the biggest selling point in attracting
performers. "Everybody saw it as an opportunity to play, but to play
with a great deal of intelligence," she said. "There's not a facile
word in all of this. That's why it's lasted all these years."</TE>
<TE>   Full of dichotomy, the story plays with relativity and upends
notions of time and space. It's "complex and simple at the same
time," York said</TE>
<TE>   "It's a children's story for children of all ages," he added.
"It's a nice little gift to give at this time of year."</TE>
<TE>   Messages to the people of Iraq</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle complained last month about
the stridency of conservative talk radio in the U.S., which he said
incites its listeners. He should be thankful the broadcasters
targeting him aren't in the Air Force.</TE>
<TE>   This week the Defense Department disclosed that it has been
blanketing Iraq not only with propaganda leaflets but also with
anti-Saddam Hussein radio broadcasts beamed from planes circling the
country.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam uses his soldiers as puppets, not for the glory of Iraq,"
says one broadcast, adding that he placed land mines in the way of
his retreating army during the Gulf War. "Will your unit be the next
one sacrificed?"</TE>
<TE>   Other messages, meant for Iraqi civilians, compare Saddam to
Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, charge that he sells oil to buy and
produce weapons rather than feed or medicate the populace, and state
that Iraqi children die of easily treated diseases.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Defense Department, one broadcast suggests he be
stopped "before he destroys Iraq and crushes the hope of its proud
people."</TE>
<TE>   Among the leaflets being dropped from different planes are notices
about the broadcasts and newsletters letting listeners know where and
when to tune in.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force used the same planes -- massive four-engine Lockheed
EC-130E Commando Solos packed with electronic gear -- in Bosnia, and
again over Afghanistan to broadcast music, news and information,
including warnings to civilians to stay away from potential bombing
targets, and explanations of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>

<HD>China exports a family house and its history</HD>
<DH>After sheltering the Huang clan for 200 years, the dwelling
becomes part of a U.S. museum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jay Lindsay</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALEM, Mass.</DL>
<LD>Its name means "Hall of Plentiful Shelter," and for almost two
centuries, the Yin Yu Tang house provided just that to the Huang
family in the remote Huizhou region of China.</LD>
<LD>   But by the mid-1980s, the clan had scattered and the home was
abandoned. In 1996, the family gathered there to decide the house's
fate.</LD>
<LD>   It was then that a remarkable coincidence saved it from
destruction and set its future across the ocean.</LD>
<TE>   Nancy Berliner, the curator of Chinese art at the Peabody Essex
Museum, was in the region when she passed the house's open door,
walked in according to common Chinese practice and found herself in
the family meeting. A discussion ensued and Berliner eventually made
a proposal: Why not move the house to America?</TE>
<TE>   Six years later, the house is being reconstructed, piece by piece,
on the museum grounds of this coastal city.</TE>
<TE>   More than 2,700 wooden pieces were among the original stones,
bricks and tiles shipped from China to New York City in 18 cargo
containers in early 1998. A team of Chinese and American artisans has
been reassembling it.</TE>
<TE>   The $15-million project is the first to transplant an entire
Chinese house to the United States and has the potential to influence
Western architecture by giving greater exposure to Chinese practices,
says Ronald Knapp, an expert in Chinese folk architecture from the
State University of New York at New Paltz. "The scope of it is really
extraordinary," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Yin Yu Tang belonged to merchants, not royalty, and Berliner says
it will provide a look into everyday middle-class Chinese life that
most Westerners have never seen. "People lived here," she says. "It's
not a temple; it's not a shrine. It has a life and it has many lives
that were inhabiting it."</TE>
<TE>   The house is scheduled to open in June as part of a $125-million
expansion at the museum, which was founded in the 18th century by Far
East traders and has a collection that spans numerous mediums and
cultures.</TE>
<TE>   Museum officials view the house as a Chinese counterpart to the
Federal-style houses those traders built in Salem.</TE>
<TE>   Yin Yu Tang's exterior is stone and brick covered with lime
plaster over a wooden post and beam frame. Inside, the reconstructed
home will display intricate latticework and stone column bases.</TE>
<TE>   Its central feature is an open-air courtyard, called a "sky well,"
with two fish ponds.</TE>
<TE>   Yin Yu Tang will be restored to its condition in the 1980s, when
the family last lived there full time, and contain the furniture and
artifacts collected over a 200-year history that was sometimes
tumultuous for both a nation and a family.</TE>
<TE>   The two-story, 2,600-square-foot building housed generations of
the Huang family at once, and room assignments reflected the family
hierarchy. The oldest and most respected members occupied rooms
closest to the east and the rising sun.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese emphasis on family is further shown in window
placement, Berliner said. The exterior windows are few and small,
measuring about a foot square. By contrast, interior windows are
broad and face the courtyard that was the center of family life.</TE>
<TE>   The house was constructed with wooden pegs and joints, fitting
together like a giant jigsaw puzzle. The delicate and detailed work
has been completed in a warehouse in the nearby town of Melrose,
where sections are reconstructed, and at the Salem site where the
house will stand.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese artisans, often using Chinese tools, are guiding the
process. Some concessions must be made to fit local building codes,
such as eliminating three of the four kitchens to fit an elevator for
handicapped access.</TE>
<TE>   The entire project is a look inside the rich field of Chinese folk
architecture, which Knapp said is relatively untapped because of so
much turmoil in China over the years.</TE>
<TE>   In the Chinese tradition, homes are designed to work with nature.
For example, they are positioned to take advantage of prevailing
winds.</TE>
<TE>   Those features will be obvious to any visitor to Yin Yu Tang and
could open new avenues into Western practices, Knapp says.</TE>
<TE>   "I think architectural students and the public alike will see it
very clearly," he said. "I think it will offer inspiration."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the agreement that brought Yin Yu Tang to the U.S., the
Peabody Essex Museum has agreed to help restore a 16th century shrine
and three 17th century homes in the Huizhou region.</TE>

<HD>How today's Santa evolved from an ad man's brush</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dahleen Glanton</AU>
<BD>Chicago Tribune</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>When most Americans think of Santa, a jovial old man who is quite a
bit overweight and wears a red velvet suit with white fur trim comes
to mind. But Santa didn't always look that way. He evolved over time,
with the help of a Chicago artist named Haddon Sundblom.</LD>
<LD>   Inspired by the works of popular American illustrators such as
Thomas Nast, Norman Rockwell and J.C. Leyendecker, Sundblom painted a
series of portraits of Santa between 1931 and 1964 for Coca-Cola
advertisements that helped to shape the modern image of the jolly
character known as Santa Claus.</LD>
<LD>   For decades, the 35 paintings have been stored in the Coca-Cola
archives in Atlanta, occasionally exhibited in museums around the
world -- in Paris, Tokyo, Sydney and Toronto. This year, 18 of the
paintings are on display at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   "What most people don't realize is that Santa's origins were very
commercial from the beginning. He was created by mass media artists
and invented by Americans in the beginning of the 19th century," said
Anne Knutson, guest curator of the High Museum of Art. "The
interesting thing is that he managed to stay above the commercial
fray; even during wars and the Great Depression, he remained the
same. And that was very comforting to Americans."</TE>
<TE>   In 1809, writer Washington Irving introduced Santa to Americans,
producing a version of the Dutch gift-giving St. Nicholas legend.
More than 70 years later, Nast, known as the father of American
political cartooning, created the modern Santa first popularized in
Harper's Weekly.</TE>
<TE>   Determined to make his Santa fully American, Nast got rid of
Santa's European attributes -- his slightly dangerous look -- and
made him more jovial, dressed in his red suit with white trim and
black leather belt. Nast also declared the North Pole Santa's home.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 years ago, advertisers began using Santa to sell
everything from soap to sterling silver coffee spoons. And by the
1920s, Leyendecker and Rockwell codified Santa's image with their
illustrations in the Saturday Evening Post. But it was Sundblom's
image that showed up in almost every home in America -- in magazine
ads promoting Coca-Cola as not only a summer refresher but a winter
drink as well. The historic pictures are still used.</TE>
<TE>   "Over three decades, his work was seen by just about every
American ... ," said Phil Mooney, archivist for Coca-Cola. "Thus,
Sundblom is credited with establishing the modern image of Santa
Claus, defining what he looks like for most of us when we think of
Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   Through the exhibit, the evolutionary process is evident. The
early paintings focus on the character of Santa Claus, with a ruddy
complexion and a Coke bottle in one hand. Later, Sundblom adds other
elements, such as a sack full of toys, a workshop with elves,
children and pets.</TE>
<TE>   Sundblom left his hometown of Muskegon, Mich., in 1899 and headed
for Chicago. His mother had recently died, and he was only 13. He
worked in construction for seven years before he became an
illustrator. He died in 1976. In the 1920s, Chicago's advertising
community was the most vital in the nation. And Sundblom was in the
midst of it. He painted for Cream of Wheat and Nabisco Shredded Wheat
cereals, Aunt Jemima pancake mix, Maxwell House coffee, Palmolive,
Whitman chocolates and Goodyear tires, among other products.</TE>
<TE>   But his biggest job was for Coca-Cola.</TE>
<TE>   For a third of a century, his vision materialized on canvas.
Disliking the cheap costumes and meager look common in department
store and charity Santas during the Depression, he countered with an
abundance of lavish fur and leather. While other Santas were skinny,
he painted a waistline so ample that it required a belt and
suspenders.</TE>

<LD>Pauline Wilson was the lead singer in one of the significant but now
nearly forgotten groups of the '70s, Seawind. Initially based in
Hawaii, then Los Angeles, the band pioneered many of the elements
that became essential to the emergence of smooth jazz.</LD>
<LD>   Wilson, who won a Grammy in 1979 for "Friends," her duet with
George Benson, has worked during the past two decades primarily as a
session artist, surfacing as a solo act in 1994 with her album
"Intuition" and, more recently, "Tribute."</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, despite a too-brief performance at La Ve Lee, she
affirmed that she is a singer with the mature musicality and inherent
jazz abilities to merit wider attention.</LD>
<TE>   Her feeling-filled rendering of "Good Morning, Heartache,"
followed by the buoyant, pop-jazz rhythms of "Rio de Janeiro Blues,"
were fine efforts by a first-rate vocal talent.</TE>
<TE>   Although Wilson was billed as the headliner, at least half the set
was devoted to the tenor saxophone and keyboard playing of Larry
Williams, an original member of Seawind who also has had a diverse
career as a studio artist.</TE>
<TE>   For this performance, however, he chose to take a more upfront
musical role. Nothing wrong with that, since Williams is an
articulate saxophonist and a proficient keyboard artist.</TE>
<TE>   But his domination of most of the performing space unfortunately
diminished the vocal presence of Wilson, as well as the solo
opportunities for two of his gifted musical associates, guitarist
Larry Koonse and bassist Dave Carpenter.</TE>

<HD>He's taking the 'Future' and his past for a spin</HD>
<DH>Now that the films that made him a star are out on DVD,
Michael J. Fox recalls his Hollywood beginnings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael J. Fox went back to his past earlier this week, thanks to the
high-profile release of the three "Back to the Future" films on DVD.</LD>
<LD>   It's been 12 years since the actor was last seen in his signature
big-screen role, the tireless time-traveling Marty McFly in the
hugely successful trilogy. In the years since "Back to the Future,
Part III" was released, Fox made a number of films -- none with quite
the impact of that series -- starred in his second hit TV sitcom,
"Spin City," and, four years ago, disclosed he was suffering from
Parkinson's disease. He soon left "Spin City" and has withdrawn
somewhat from the public eye, while staying busy with new projects.</LD>
<LD>   But there he was on Monday, revisiting McFly once again.</LD>
<TE>   The day began with the 41-year-old actor getting his star on the
Hollywood Walk of Fame. That evening, he reunited with the cast and
crew of the three "Back to the Futures" at Universal Studios' clock
tower square, which was pivotal in the films. The DVD version of the
movies is one of Universal's big holiday releases.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, who has been suffering from Parkinson's since 1991, sounded
tired during a phone interview Monday afternoon but seemed in good
spirits. Like many entertainers who aren't as visible as they once
were, he emphasized how busy he is.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm writing a pilot for ABC," Fox says. "It's for a comedy. Then
I promised my book publisher I would write a novel sometime this year
and next. And I am looking at a lot of scripts to direct. Not doing a
series and not producing on a weekly level, I feel a lot more rested
and a lot better in the last couple of years than I have in a while."</TE>
<TE>   He's also been busy running the Michael J. Fox Foundation for
Parkinson's Research and being a dad to his four children.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's 13-year-old son, Sam, who is only a few years younger than
the McFly character his father played, accompanied him to Los Angeles
for the two Monday events. So did the actor's mother, Phyllis Fox,
who lives in Canada. His wife, actress Tracy Pollan, stayed home in
New York with their 7-year-old twin girls and 13-month-old daughter.
"She's still nursing our youngest," Fox says.</TE>
<TE>   He was joined at the morning's Walk of Fame ceremony by such
business associates as "Family Ties" and "Spin City" executive
producer and creator Gary David Goldberg, and "Back to the Future"
director Robert Zemeckis and writer Bob Gale.</TE>
<TE>   "When I came to L.A. in 1979, my father drove me down [from
Canada] for this kind of fact-finding mission to see if it was a
viable thing to let his 18-year-old son move to L.A. When we came
down, we went to this really, really great ice cream parlor called
C.C. Brown's. It was, I think, in the same block where the Galaxy
Theaters are now, where the star is. It is kind of a nice connection
because when I think of it, it makes me think of my dad. He has been
gone since 1990."</TE>
<TE>   Zemeckis and Gale, as well as his film co-stars Lea Thompson and
Christopher Lloyd then joined him as Universal saluted the "Back to
the Future" trilogy with a lavish party. The event was originally to
be al fresco in front of the film's famous clock, but party planners
scrambled over the weekend to erect a massive tent when weather
forecasters predicted -- correctly -- that Monday would be rainy.</TE>
<TE>   For the three-disc DVD release of the "Back to the Future" movies,
which between them grossed more than $500 million in the U.S. alone,
Fox appears in several documentaries and does select on-screen
commentary for the original 1985 "Back to the Future." "I didn't
actually sit down and watch all three films again, but I wish I had,"
he says. "I have seen bits and pieces of them over the years, and my
son has watched at least the first couple.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of those things that for a lot of people it is part of
their popular culture, and for me, it's basically home movies.
Sometimes you feel like sitting down and watching home movies and
sometimes you don't. I am actually looking forward to sitting down
and exploring them throughout one day."</TE>
<TE>   Fox was doing the low-budget film "Teen Wolf" in the fall of 1984.
"Family Ties" was on a filming hiatus because star Meredith Baxter
was about to give birth to twins. "I did 'Teen Wolf' as a lark. We
shot in Pasadena in a place where a lot of people shoot film and this
advance scout company came to scout for 'Back to the Future.' I
didn't know what it was about, I just remember sitting there
thinking, 'I wish I was on that movie and not this one.' "</TE>
<TE>   He did know that Eric Stoltz was set to star in "Back to the
Future" playing the teenage McFly. But Stoltz hadn't filmed too many
scenes when he was released from the film because he wasn't working
out.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we had just come back from the Christmas holidays in
early '85 and Gary Goldberg called me into the office and gave me the
script [to 'Back to the Future'] and said they had approached him
originally back in the beginning of the season. He couldn't let me
out and he didn't want to disappoint me by even bringing it up. But
all of a sudden, they had come back to him."</TE>
<TE>   This time, Goldberg worked out the "Family Ties" schedule so Fox
could do the NBC sitcom by day and the film at night. "He was
responsible for me having a film career," Fox says.</TE>
<TE>   Doing the movie and TV series simultaneously was exhausting but
tremendously exciting for Fox. "You're only 24 once," he says. "It
was just a tremendous blur. So when the film came out there were
actual scenes that I watched I couldn't specifically remember doing."</TE>

<DH>A late substitution, Viggo Mortensen dived into 'Rings.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Irene Lacher</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The cutest guy in Middle-earth has an urge to smoke. Mumbling
something about going to his car, Viggo Mortensen, the dashing human
hero of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, heads out of Chez Jay,
Hollywood's favorite dive in spitting distance of the ocean. The
Santa Monica place is pretty skeevy as Sunday brunch spots go, which
is of course part of its charm. That may be especially true for
Mortensen, who finds the industry's sleeker trappings as skeevy as
some Bel-Air-ians would find Chez Jay.</LD>
<LD>   On his return, Mortensen, who's been drinking virginal grapefruit
juice, notices the eggs of his brunch partner, which are beginning to
resemble the plastic food in Japanese restaurant windows. "Sorry
about your food," he says sheepishly. "Would you like them to heat
that up?"</LD>
<LD>   Smoking may be Mortensen's only antisocial activity, because the
guy is well known for his thoughtfulness. During the 18-month-long
"Rings" shoot in New Zealand, Mortensen, an experienced horseman,
spent hours helping novice equestrienne and co-star Liv Tyler learn
how to take the reins. And when it came his turn to enjoy an
executive producer's morale-buffing dinner invitation for cast
members, the producer, Mark Ordesky, never got a chance to reach for
his wallet.</LD>
<TE>   "When I called Viggo, he said, 'Pick me up at 8,' " New Line
Cinema's Ordesky recalls. "I get there and he cooks. He's a
Renaissance man. He paints, he acts, he writes poetry, you could
bounce a quarter off of him and he cooks the way our mothers cook --
from scratch."</TE>
<TE>   Mortensen's natural capacity for noblesse oblige is clearly an
asset for his transformation into the dashing Aragorn. In "The Two
Towers," the second installment of the trilogy, which opened
Wednesday, the exiled heir to the throne of Gondor valiantly leads
humans and elves in the battle against the forces of the evil Sauron,
who lusts after the One Ring that could empower him to destroy all
that is good in Middle-earth. The movie opened to generally glowing
reviews and huge box office.</TE>
<TE>   "The Two Towers" showcases Mortensen far more than the
ensemble-driven first installment, and if the trilogy can propel
Mortensen into the ranks of household hunks, "The Two Towers" would
be the vehicle to do it in. The new film spends more screen time than
the first episode did in showing off Aragorn's talents for slaying
evil Uruk-hai and making virtuous beauties swoon, the basic
prerequisites for action herohood.</TE>
<TE>   When director Peter Jackson cast Mortensen as the sensitive,
romantic warrior-king, critics predicted that the role would turn the
44-year-old actor into an action superstar in the same way that
"Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Gladiator" made A-list hotties out of
Harrison Ford and Russell Crowe, respectively. Mortensen's previous
turns before the camera, as a soulful lover who entices women into
extramarital affairs in "A Walk on the Moon" (1999) and "A Perfect
Murder" (1998), won plaudits from critics, but "A Walk" was a small
film, and Mortensen's heat in "Murder" had to compete with the star
wattage generated by Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly "The Fellowship of the Ring," based on the first book of
J.R.R. Tolkien's cult-friendly epic about hobbits, humans and orcs
duking it out in a primeval fantasy world, expanded Mortensen's
audience a zillion-fold. The movie was last year's
second-highest-grossing film, generating $860 million worldwide and
13 Oscar nominations including best picture. But so far, Mortensen's
place in the matinee idol universe remains as fuzzy as hobbit feet.</TE>
<TE>   Mortensen's innate valor could turn out to be a double-edged
sword: The quality that helps make him perfect for the role of
Aragorn may have its downside, according to at least one critic.
"He's deadly earnest, and that can be a problem," says New York
magazine critic Peter Rainer. "He's always been very effective, but
there's a sort of one-note earnestness that you get.... What people
seem to want now from these action heroes is a little more variation,
a little more spoofy element, wit and fun."</TE>
<TE>   Back at Chez Jay, Mortensen is asked what he thinks of the
predictions that "Rings" would make him a big movie star, nearly two
decades after his 1985 film debut as an Amish farmer in "Witness."</TE>
<TE>   "First of all, I don't think it has, but I don't think about it
much," he says slowly. "It's not connected to what I do in
collaboration with others in trying to help the director tell a
story. As far as arriving, I've been told I had arrived many times in
the past 20 years. And presumably departed as well," he adds with a
wry laugh. "I think that in my case they've exhausted the idea of the
new face."</TE>
<TE>   Middle-earth to Old West</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, he certainly doesn't look like a standard-issue
movie star. His Scandinavian cheekbones and cleft chin are covered in
5 o'clock fuzz, even though it's a good 17 hours since that hirsute
hour. His crystal-blue eyes are shaded by a squooshy felt hat that
he's breaking in so it will be ratty enough for his next film,
"Hidalgo," named after the horse of Pony Express rider Frank T.
Hopkins.</TE>
<TE>   The New York-born, L.A.-based actor isn't entirely unmindful of
the perks of success, and he recognizes that "Rings" helped him snare
the role of Hopkins, a well-known long-distance racer of the 1890s
who competed in Saudi Arabia. The Disney film, directed by Joe
Johnston and co-starring Omar Sharif, has been shooting in South
Dakota and the Arabian desert, where Mortensen discussed post-Sept.
11 events with local Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   The experience fueled his misgivings about U.S. foreign policy,
and when he went on "The Charlie Rose Show" last month with Jackson
and Elijah Wood (Frodo in the trilogy), he sported a self-made
T-shirt that said "No More Blood for Oil." Mortensen says he was
tired of hearing the post-9/11 spin on the trilogy, comparing "the
plight of the fellowship and the plight of the United States,
simplifying what is not simple in Tolkien's world -- good versus
evil."</TE>
<TE>   "For a year we've been wiping out all these people, and we don't
have a sense of them in this country," Mortensen says. "If we saw
their faces on a regular basis like we did the World Trade Center
victims -- not to take anything away from that, but there were many
more people than were killed at the World Trade Center."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Mortensen has a reputation for intensity on the
set. His fellow cast members talked about how he carried his sword
everywhere, even to an antiseptic studio facility for dialogue
looping, and how he sometimes camped out with his weapons when the
rest of the cast and crew bunked down in cozy hotels. But Mortensen
downplays the media image of him as wild-man artiste. He says he
camped out to experience New Zealand's natural beauty, and he lived
with his sword because he had to play catch-up after being cast at
the 11th hour to replace Stuart Townsend in the role of Aragorn.</TE>
<TE>   Mortensen didn't crack open the trilogy until he was on a plane to
New Zealand. He took the role partly on career advice from someone
who had: Henry Mortensen, his 14-year-old son with his ex-wife,
punk-rock singer Exene Cervenka.</TE>
<TE>   Acting is only part of Mortensen's artistic repertoire. He's a
published poet, and his paintings and photography have been exhibited
at the Track 16 Gallery at Bergamot Station in Santa Monica and the
Robert Mann Gallery in New York. Next year, his work will travel to
galleries in Milan, Madrid and Havana. Earlier this year he launched
Perceval Press, which publishes poetry and art, including his own
collections, "Coincidence of Memory" and "Signguage."</TE>
<TE>   Perceval's only other published artist so far is Lola Schnabel,
Julian Schnabel's 22-year-old daughter, who has been linked
romantically with Mortensen. The actor, who has been voluble on the
subjects of Tolkien, U.S. foreign policy and the sometimes grueling
shoot, is suddenly tight-lipped. "She's a friend of mine," he says
simply.</TE>
<TE>   Later, the reason for his reticence becomes clear: The New York
Post's Page Six reported this week that Schnabel had dumped Mortensen
after two years. His publicist didn't return a call for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Mortensen is so private and shy that it took years of practice to
brave auditions and interviews comfortably. So when a reporter asks
to see the tattoo he and the other "Fellowship" actors got to
immortalize their camaraderie, he declines. Politely, of course. "No,
thank you," he says. "But thanks for asking."</TE>

<LD>I read with sadness your article "A Donation? ... Gee ... Thanks" (by
Bettijane Levine, Dec. 17), regarding people who were offended that
friends gave a charitable donation in their name instead of a gift.
Most telling was the number of times the words "me," "we" and "us"
were used by the offended recipients.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, one should not automatically donate to just any charity
when giving a charitable donation as a gift; rather it should be to a
charity that the recipient normally gives to. But I suppose that only
works if the recipient is truly interested in the charity as opposed
to the tax deduction that it offers them.</LD>

<TE>   WITH regard to the Thousand Oaks hostess who was "offended"
because one couple at her 60-guest holiday bash didn't bring her a
present, I can only fall back on the words of Miss Manners: "Contrary
to general belief, present giving is never required. You must pretend
that you invite people because you want to celebrate important
occasions with them."</TE>
<TE>   To act as if presents are standard payment, she writes, "is
rude-rude-rude."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps The Times could begin running Miss Manners' column. It
appears that there are some who could benefit from her gentle
reminders.</TE>

<TE>   THE shallow pettiness of the people in the article disgusts me. I
would rather have the sick and poor benefit than receive silly
Christmas gifts. After all, the Bible says Jesus spent a lot of time
healing the sick and feeding the poor, but it never mentions him
shopping for presents.</TE>

<TE>   A thoughtful card reflecting the donor's passionate interest in a
cause is a gift -- a gift of expanding the thinking of the
self-centered characters that this article portrays to include
thinking about the world and the needs of people even beyond the
suburbs of Thousand Oaks.</TE>

<TE>   YEARS ago -- and for years -- a dear friend would skip sending the
unneeded baskets of goodies, and in his Christmas card say that he
was sending the money he would have spent on gifts to a Japanese
woman who had faithfully brought him food when he was a prisoner of
war. As she had kept him alive, so he was taking care of her for the
rest of her life.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing has ever meant as much to me as that gift.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Levine's essay on giving poses a problem: How do you give a
meaningful gift that is personal and still helps charities?
Unfortunately, a solution wasn't offered, but there is a solution,
based right here in the L.A. area. The nonprofit Charity Checks
offers Giving Certificates that allow you to "give the joy of giving"
to someone else -- who then picks the charity that benefits.</TE>
<TE>   When you give someone a Giving Certificate, any of the more than
800,000 charities in the United States can benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of saying a "donation has been made in your name to my
favorite cause," you are showing that you care and respect the
recipient's passions and concerns. The recipient gets to mail in the
check to the charity of choice.</TE>
<TE>   Charity Checks are available online at www.charitychecks.us and
via phone, (800) 854-5601.</TE>

<LD>MARIA Elena Fernandez's article ("Their Comfort Zone," Dec. 14) was
one of the biggest excuse-making pieces I've ever read. Let's get
something straight. These people are not "full-bodied,"
"full-figured" or even "big, beautiful women." They're fat, or obese,
if you'd rather use that word. To use her more euphemistic terms is
like calling Hannibal Lecter a "non-mainstream, selective diner."</LD>
<LD>   No one forced these people to stuff all those calories down their
throats. They lack self-control and are attempting to make the rest
of us tell them it's OK.</LD>
<LD>   The article mentions that there are critics but never gives lip
service to the problems they address. Our medical insurance costs are
skyrocketing due to health problems associated with obesity,
including high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes and diabetes.
We seem to have no problem railing on about how smokers adversely
affect our medical insurance but never seem to want to make the same
justifiable complaints against people who don't want to control their
eating.</LD>

<LD>I was rereading the review of "The Two Towers" ("Must Be Geek Love,"
Dec. 18) for the third time when I finally figured it out: Manohla
Dargis must belong to that refreshing new breed of movie critics who
deliberately write turgid, off-the-wall reviews to avoid having a
reputation sullied by being quoted in movie ads. Well done!</LD>

<LD>IN his Dec. 17 article "The Monster in 'Max,' " a movie about Adolf
Hitler, Patrick Goldstein quotes Abraham Foxman of the
Anti-Defamation League as saying, "Why the need or desire to make
this monster human? Why trivialize the judgment of history by
focusing on his childhood and adolescence?"</LD>
<LD>   Much as Foxman may deny the fact, Hitler was a complex human
being. The need to acknowledge that fact derives from the need to
understand how a person could acquire power in a modern nation. To
pretend that such an understanding is not worthwhile is dangerous.</LD>
<LD>   I assume that Foxman is sophisticated enough to realize that
because one seeks such understanding does not make one sympathetic
toward Hitler. Indeed, understanding the complexity of his character
makes one better able to comprehend what evil is. If Hitler is a
one-dimensional character, then one's understanding of evil is
trivialized.</LD>

Hefner's big lie being exposed ("Playboy's New Digs: Not a Smoking
Jacket in Sight," by Mary McNamara, Dec. 17). Hefner's entire empire
was built on lies: that "real women" look like his bunnies, that what
he was schlepping was "for gentlemen," that guys like him, Bill Maher
and Drew Cary are cool.</LD>
<LD>   The older Hefner gets, the more foolish he looks. Even Hef's
daughter saw his lie and has decided that to survive, Playboy must be
about its real business: producing pornography.</LD>

<HD>Wordsmith can still conjure heartache</HD>
<DH>In a rare L.A.-area appearance, Red Simpson exhibits
emotional flexibility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Lewis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Red Simpson never hit the heights his fellow Bakersfield denizens
Buck Owens and Merle Haggard did, but those two owe some of their
successes to Simpson.</LD>
<LD>   Owens recorded nearly three dozen songs written or co-written by
Simpson, notably "Close Up the Honky Tonks," later covered by the
Flying Burrito Brothers, and the 1965 slice of honky-tonk life "Sam's
Place." Simpson, 68, dusted off both tunes Thursday in a rare
L.A.-area appearance at the cozy Viva Cantina in Burbank.</LD>
<LD>   "Sam's Place" and "Honky Tonks" boast the richly delineated notes
of character, teetering at times on caricature, that also typify the
trucking songs with which the Arizona-born, Bakersfield-reared
Simpson made a moderate name for himself in the '60s and '70s.</LD>
<TE>   Entertaining as they are, "(Hello) I'm a Truck," "Truckin' Trees
for Christmas" and "Highway Patrol" represent just one side of
Simpson's music -- the catchy, quasi-novelty songs full of crisp
wordplay and a strong sense of humor.</TE>
<TE>   The other side encompasses love songs such as "You Don't Have Very
Far to Go," which he wrote with Haggard. It's the kind that's almost
vanished from mainstream country: unflinchingly honest, filled with a
soul-deep heartache that doesn't magically vanish in a cheery final
chorus.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson was backed by L.A. country singer Cody Bryant and his
sharp band, who are working with him on a new album aimed for release
next year.</TE>
<TE>   His mighty baritone is every bit as authoritative as ever, and
perhaps more richly complex.</TE>

<HD>Jingle Ball has the hits, but not the fire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Natalie Nichols</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The annual KIIS-FM Jingle Ball concert treated pop fans to some of
2002's bigger hit-makers on Thursday at the Arrowhead Pond. Yet the
assortment of divas, crooners and sassy teens amounted to little more
than a few trinkets (and a lump of coal or two) wrapped up in a
giant, flashy package topped with cascades of glittery fake snow.</LD>
<LD>   Almost everyone mined '80s music in some way, from pop to new wave
to rock. But the more distressing commonality among these disparate
acts was a general inability to take their slick favorites to the
stage.</LD>
<LD>   Still, fans at the sold-out show squealed with delight throughout
the four-plus hours, which featured brief sets by Mariah Carey,
Australian disco dolly Kylie Minogue, R&amp;B trio Destiny's Child, Nick
Carter of the Backstreet Boys, Justin Timberlake of 'N Sync, "SK8TR"
girl Avril Lavigne, Ozzy offspring Kelly Osbourne, DJ-with-a-band
Paul Oakenfold and token rock group the Goo Goo Dolls.</LD>
<TE>   All offered brief performances on a brightly decorated revolving
stage dominated by a Times Square-like cluster of giant video
screens, an electronic ticker and a half-dozen or so smaller,
ornament-shaped monitors that ceaselessly played loud radio-station
promos, videos by the featured artists, DJ shtick and sponsor
advertising.</TE>
<TE>   This setup made the actual-size artists seem somewhat ... er,
smaller than life, if you will. Probably the only act to live up to
its videos was Minogue, whose show-closing presentation recalled
'80s-era Madonna with the pumping hit "Can't Get You Out of My Head"
and bunches of campy, "Rocky Horror"-esque dancer shtick, including
bare-chested men in stockings, high heels and flirty can-can skirts.</TE>
<TE>   Troubled songbird Carey couldn't compete with that, and she didn't
even try. After whipping up the crowd by entering from the back of
the arena, she spent barely 10 minutes on stage, singing her new
ballad "Through the Rain" and a Phil Spector-esque holiday song (the
evening's sole seasonal offering) gamely but with little of her
vaunted power and range.</TE>
<TE>   At least the Goo Goo Dolls had genuine heartland, sensitive-rebel
appeal. But most artists proved more charismatic in two-dimensional
form, whether it was the this-is-the-live-remix hits regurgitation of
Destiny's Child or Lavigne's Alanis-lite fusion of glossy folk-pop
and gritty punk-metal. Although "Complicated" and other tunes from
Lavigne's debut album, "Let Go," demonstrated the promising
Canadian's real facility for tapping the alienation, frustration and
neediness of youth, she will have to log more stage time to achieve
the oomph and spark of the song's video.</TE>
<TE>   Osbourne (a last-minute substitution for the apparently so-over
"American Idol" stars Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini) seized the
moment with more verve. In gothic ballerina garb, she proved Daddy's
little provocateur, asking the crowd to make gender-specific gestures
during a song about masturbation. But while the title track from her
punk-pop debut album, "Shut Up," had a goofy rebelliousness, she was
hardly the Ricky Nelson of "The Osbournes" and would be much better
off taking after her mum.</TE>
<TE>   As for the dueling boy-band crooners, well, it wasn't much of a
contest.</TE>
<TE>   Neither had memorable material, but Timberlake displayed oodles
more charisma than Carter, who favored Journey-esque anthems and a
sugary take on the Cars' deadpan love song "Just What I Needed."</TE>
<TE>   Both had live bands, and Timberlake brought out a gaggle of
dancers to execute steps that were so lame he had no trouble doing
them even with a broken foot. His hip-hop-flavored "Cry Me a River"
and other songs may have been sanctioned by production wizards the
Neptunes, whose Pharrell Williams made a guest appearance with
Timberlake, but the 'N Syncer was content to plunder history with the
Jacksons-esque hit "Like I Love You."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The final installment of CBS' unscripted series "Survivor: Thailand"
conquered its competition Thursday night, beating the other three
major networks combined both in audience size and key demographics,
according to figures released Friday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   The two-hour installment was watched by more than 24 million
viewers. Still, that was about 1 million fewer than tuned in for the
finale of "Survivor: Marquesas" last May. CBS executives attributed
the decrease to the Christmas shopping season.</LD>
<LD>   Car salesman Brian Heidek was named the winner of "Survivor:
Thailand" and walked away with the $1-million prize. Heidek had
formerly appeared in several soft-core porno movies, and his wife was
arrested last month on charges of spousal abuse.</LD>
<TE>   The big numbers for the "Survivor" finale carried through for CBS,
with "Late Night With David Letterman" and "The Late Late Show With
Craig Kilborn" scoring season-high ratings, network executives said.</TE>

<LD>UC Santa Cruz has received a donation of 160 photographs from Bay
Area photographer Pirkle Jones and his late wife, poet and
photographer Ruth-Marion Baruch, a gift valued at more than $1
million.</LD>
<LD>   The donation includes the pair's landmark 1968 series on the Black
Panther party, recently published as a book, and their complete
archive.</LD>
<LD>   Jones, 88, got acquainted with the university in 1969, when he
taught at a workshop on campus led by Ansel Adams. The Jones-Baruch
donation will join other photographers' works and archives in the
university library's special collections.</LD>

<LD>Gilberto Gil, Brazil's popular Grammy-winning pop star, accepted an
offer from President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to become the
country's next culture minister.</LD>
<LD>   Gil, 60, was one of the creators of Tropicalia, which opened
traditional bossa nova to rock 'n' roll, reggae and Latin sounds. He
campaigned for Silva and is the most prominent member of Brazil's
Green Party, which is allied with Silva's Workers Party.</LD>
<LD>   Gil initially was reluctant to take the position, explaining he
couldn't maintain his lifestyle on the $26,000 salary. But he told
reporters he has Silva's permission to continue making money from his
music. "I can work from Monday through Friday at the ministry and do
shows on Saturday and Sunday," he said.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Steven Spielberg has rescued another Oscar from the auction block.</LD>
<LD>   The director-producer paid $180,000, not including fees and taxes,
to buy Bette Davis' best actress Oscar for the 1935 movie
"Dangerous," spokesman Marvin Levy said. It was auctioned by
Sotheby's in New York last Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Spielberg will donate the Oscar to the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences. "It's part of preserving film history," Levy said.</LD>
<TE>   Spielberg, himself a multiple Academy Award winner, bought and
donated two other Oscars that were being sold privately. He paid
$578,000 last year for Davis' Oscar for the 1938 movie "Jezebel," and
$607,500 in 1996 for Clark Gable's best-actor Oscar for 1934's "It
Happened One Night."</TE>

<LD>Two J.M.W. Turner masterpieces stolen from a German exhibition eight
years ago have been returned to the Tate Britain, the London gallery
announced Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The two paintings, which had been insured for a total of $38.5
million, were found intact but without their original frames.</LD>
<LD>   "These two are among Turner's most important works," Tate director
Nicholas Serota told reporters. They were stolen along with a
painting by German artist Caspar David Friedrich while on loan to the
Schirn Kunsthalle in Frankfurt. Three thieves and the driver who
carried out the theft were arrested in 1995 and convicted in Germany
in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   One of the Turner paintings, "Shade and Darkness," was actually
recovered in July 2000. But the discovery was kept secret while
investigations continued. The second, "Light and Color," was
recovered Monday. Both were returned to Britain on Wednesday.</TE>

flipper</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Still struggling to find the perfect gift for that special man, woman
or space alien in your life? What better way to say "I love you" than
a $3,995 inflatable iceberg. It's stylish yet practical. And it's one
of many thoughtful gifts in our holiday guide:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Grizzly creche: Most theologians believe Jesus was fully divine
and fully human. But others think he was a bear. Perhaps that
explains why wspmf.org now offers a Nativity set in which Mary,
Joseph and the baby Jesus have been replaced by cutesy bears. Even
the angels in this $60 "bear-tivity" scene are ursine figures. Sadly,
there are no Wise Men bearing gifts of gold, frankincense and
Jellystone Park picnic baskets.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Instant Antarctica: For years, landscape architects have been
sprucing up yards with fake rocks and waterfalls. Frankly, it's
gotten predictable. Why not break out of the mold with a $3,995
inflatable iceberg? Made from industrial-strength fabric, the blow-up
berg is ideal for "turning an otherwise flat, featureless lake or
harbor [or koi pond?] into a full-scale adventure." Or you can use it
to sink inflatable Titanics. From www.hammacher.com.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The gasoline-powered blender: Few things are more annoying than
being in the wilderness and developing a sudden craving for a
margarita or pina colada. It's not like you can whip up a frozen
alcoholic beverage in the middle of nowhere. Or can you? Introducing
the Daiquiri Whacker, the "gas-powered, go-anywhere party starter."
Available from wonder fullywacky.com, this $255 machine features a
"heat-treated stainless steel drive shaft coupled to an unbreakable
plastic Oster jar." Cheers!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bushy-tailed kleptomaniacs: Claiming that squirrels eat "millions
of dollars worth of food meant for birds" each year, a Rhode Island
company has created the Yankee Flipper, a "revolutionary
squirrel-proof bird feeder."</TE>
<TE>   Whenever a squirrel steps on the $111 device's perch, the excess
weight activates a motor that spins the feeder and throws the
bushy-tailed critter to the ground. Company officials are so amused
by the results that they also sell a 60-minute video of squirrels
being flung to and fro by the device (www.yankeeflip per.com).</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the company should also invent a version for overweight
humans. Whenever someone opens the door of the Yankee Flipper Fridge,
a V-8 motor spins the refrigerator and throws the person across the
kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Rockefeller phone: The Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog is
usually a reliable source for outrageously expensive gifts. In years
past, it has offered everything from his and her submarines to
chocolate Monopoly games to blimps. This year's lineup includes a
$6,100 luxury cell phone from Vertu. Encased in stainless steel, it
plays your choice of 10 ring tone tunes. But we don't recommend it.
For that price, the phone should come with its own musicians who
follow the phone around and perform the song whenever you have a
call. Or, if you set the phone to vibrate, a professional masseuse
should be on hand to give you a back rub to signal incoming calls.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sport-utility dentures: A Galveston, Texas, company has begun
selling giant sets of plastic teeth that mount on automobile grilles.
Designed to resemble the choppers of sharks, vampires,
jack-o'-lanterns, gators or rabbits, the $39 car teeth (available at
www.autoexpressions.com) can also be customized to light up at night.
Can giant floss be far behind?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Surreal estate: Sometimes a man's home is his castle--and
sometimes it's his prefabricated log cabin. At least, that's the
theory behind Blue Ridge Log Cabins (www.blueridgelog cabins.com), a
company that builds mobile homes that look like something Davy
Crockett lived in. The wooden structures also include such
pioneer-era amenities as microwave ovens, double-glazed windows,
cathedral ceilings and electric stoves. It's an intriguing concept,
but why limit it to log cabins? How about trailer-park homes that
resemble Medieval castles (with prefab moats containing plastic
alligators), igloos, Egyptian pyramids, tepees, skyscrapers or the
White House?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Budget burglar deterrent: One of the weirdest products to come
down the pike this season is Watchdogdoo, a new home security device.
Well, "device" might be a stretch. It's actually a "Beware of Dog"
sign accompanied by five piles of realistic dog poop designed by a
Hollywood special effects artist.</TE>
<TE>   "It's perfect for people who don't own a dog and can't afford an
expensive burglar alarm system," says a press release from the
company's Web site, www.watchdogdoo.com. The theory is that would-be
thieves will see the sign, notice the lifelike piles in the yard and
assume a watchdog lives in the house.</TE>
<TE>   But we envision other uses. For example, instead of wasting your
money on a car alarm, simply set a couple of piles on your dashboard.
Watchdogdoo is also ideal for bad blind dates. With a strategically
placed hunk of the stuff on your person, you can subtly let unwanted
suitors know you're "not available."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Theater in the drowned: It's a movie theater. No, it's a hot tub.
No, it's a movie theater. Wait, it's both! Inspired by Milan's famous
opera house (if it were under water), Jacuzzi Inc.'s new La Scala tub
is the world's first combination whirlpool and home theater system.
Big enough to seat two people, the $30,000 whirlpool features a
42-inch plasma TV, surround-sound stereo system, 10 hydrotherapy jets
and a floating remote control. The only thing missing is waterproof
popcorn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Portable Church: Here's the perfect gift for pastors who are
full of hot air -- an inflatable church. Available for rental or
purchase from www.inflatable church.com, this blow-up British
cathedral features plastic stained-glass windows, as well as an
inflatable altar, pulpit, organ and pews. If your bride is an
inflatable doll, she'll feel right at home getting married here.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The medium is the massage: Minnesota masseur Paul Herb offers
custom "themed massages" for $1,000 to $3,500. Past efforts include a
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" massage with green tea body balm and
"unintelligible Chinese mumbling" soundtrack, and a "1492" rubdown in
which the room was decorated with canvas sails and the masseur
dressed like Christopher Columbus. Apparently, nothing relaxes the
body like a rubdown by a famous dead explorer. Personally, we prefer
Magellan-themed massages, but some others swear by Ponce de Leon. For
information, contact Paulherb@earthlink.net.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cathouses R Us: A former stunt double for Barbara Eden and Heather
Locklear has launched a company that builds unusual houses for cats
(www.gotta-have-it.us). The kitty cabanas are built to resemble the
Taj Mahal, an Airstream trailer (complete with blinking taillights),
a castle or a cottage with tiny French doors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hanukkah Helper: Why should Christmas and Easter be the only
religious holidays whose true significance is overshadowed by
commercialization? In a major breakthrough, now Jews can enjoy
trivialized holidays too. At anymenorah.com, they can buy Hanukkah
candelabras shaped like a robot, the New York City skyline (including
the World Trade Center), an airplane or a box of crayons. Other
menorahs feature Mickey Mouse, Curious George, Donald Duck,
Winnie-the-Pooh or "Rugrats" characters. Still no Britney Spears
menorah, but give it time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stocking Stuffers: Last but not least ...</TE>
<TE>   The Batesville Casket Co.'s souvenir shop (http://biz.bates
ville.com/LogoStore/index.asp) sells coffin-shaped chocolate bars
($4) and coffin-shaped cigar humidors ($150).</TE>
<TE>   AromaLand, a New Mexico aromatherapy company, now carries a line
of "aroma-free" aromatherapy products.</TE>
<TE>   Turn your loved one into a pinata and then beat the stuffing out
of him. Pinatas.com creates custom pinatas based on photos or other
artwork sent in by customers.</TE>
<TE>   Personalized checks featuring artwork of dogs playing poker or
"The Brady Bunch" are available from Checksinthemail.com and
Designerchecks.com, respectively.</TE>

<KH>REGARDING MEDIA / TIM RUTTEN</KH>
<HD>Inquiry into weeklies is coming to town</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PROSECUTORS investigating whether the nation's two largest
alternative newspaper chains violated federal and state antitrust
laws when they closed competing publications in Los Angeles and
Cleveland will begin taking sworn testimony in Southern California
during the first week of January, according to law enforcement
officials and witnesses whose depositions already have been
scheduled.</LD>
<LD>   Sources with firsthand knowledge say the probe has focused
increasingly on whether the deal between New York-based Village Voice
Media and New Times Media of Phoenix has influenced both advertising
rates and the amount and quality of local news in both cities. The
latter line of inquiry, those sources say, involves not only
questions about whether closing the two alternative weeklies reduced
overall news coverage, but also whether the absence of competition
has allowed the surviving papers to de-emphasize local reporting and
analysis in favor of more lucrative lifestyle and entertainment
journalism.</LD>
<TE>   "State and federal antitrust laws prohibit deals that unreasonably
deprive consumers of the benefits of competition resulting in higher
prices for inferior products and services," said L.A. County Deputy
Dist. Atty. Kathleen Tuttle, who heads the antitrust section of the
D.A.'s consumer protection division. "The law does not condemn all
agreements between companies. Only those that threaten to raise
prices to consumers or to deprive them of new or better products."</TE>
<TE>   According to antitrust lawyer Don T. Hibner Jr., "Editorial
content has been deemed a federal concern under the Newspaper
Preservation Act. To the degree this deal removes editorial choice
from consumers, it is bound to concern the U.S. Department of
Justice." (The 32-year-old federal statute allows newspapers to merge
business operations in the interest of maintaining separate editorial
voices.)</TE>
<TE>   In October, New Times Media agreed to shut down its 6-year-old Los
Angeles paper in exchange for more than $8 million, ceding its
Southern California niche to L.A. Weekly, which is owned by Village
Voice Media. Village Voice Media agreed to close its Cleveland Free
Times in exchange for a much smaller cash payment from New Times,
which continues to publish its Cleveland Scene.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a month later, a joint task force of prosecutors from
the U.S. Department of Justice, the California and Ohio attorneys
general and the L.A. County district attorney's office served both
chains with a demand for all documents, correspondence, e-mails and
telephone messages relating to their arrangement. Shortly afterward,
officials began interviewing potential witnesses in both cities. Last
month, the task force began taking sworn testimony from witnesses in
Cleveland, where some depositions lasted as long as 10 hours.</TE>
<TE>   This week, prosecutors began scheduling depositions to be taken in
downtown Los Angeles' federal courthouse during the first two weeks
of January. Among those whose testimony under oath already has been
set are three former L.A. Weekly executives, one-time publisher
Michael Sigmund, former classified advertising director Jim Kaplan,
and Paul Davis, who managed production. Former local government
columnist Mark Haefele, who quit the Weekly over what he regarded as
inappropriate editorial intrusion, also is scheduled to testify.</TE>
<TE>   According to sources familiar with the investigation, prosecutors
also have been interviewing advertisers in Los Angeles about the
degree to which the Weekly and New Times formerly competed for their
business and about whether rates have increased since the deal was
struck. Sources said representatives of a number of those businesses,
particularly in the concert and film sectors, will also be deposed
under oath.</TE>
<TE>   Haefele said Thursday that he "had a long discussion last month
with the DOJ, and they asked me whether I thought that Village Voice
Media's takeover of New Times Los Angeles in any way reflected a
general de-emphasis of local news on the part of VVM. The Justice
Department lawyers brought this up, and I told them I thought it was
part and parcel of a Village Voice Media policy that not only leaves
us with one alternative newspaper in L.A., but also one that is, on
the whole, less interested in local news and more interested in style
and fashion. The DOJ asked me whether my column was affected by this
policy and whether I was pushed to leave. They wondered if there was
less space in the paper for hard news, particularly local news than
there used to be. I told them yes."</TE>
<TE>   Several L.A. Weekly journalists, all of whom asked not to be
identified, said they too believe the paper is not as interested as
it once was in local news and commentary. "The number of news-related
covers definitely has gone down," said one, who cited Laurie Ochoa's
appointment as editor last year, "as a clear sign that New York wants
a softer focus for the paper." Ochoa formerly worked as editor of The
Times' food section and at Gourmet magazine. "People are sort of in
retreat here," the Weekly staff member said. "This is not a paper
that carries big causes anymore."</TE>
<TE>   According to federal sources in Cleveland, prosecutors have raised
similar concerns during depositions there. "Cleveland Scene was
started 30 years ago as a concert promotion rag," one of those
sources said. "The Free Times came along 10 years ago and provided a
real alternative weekly, one that had biting reporting and did some
deep digging into local politics and corruption. The Scene began
doing one news story or so an issue, but there really was a clear
editorial difference and this deal has swept that away."</TE>
<TE>   Village Voice Media is a privately held company, but witnesses
familiar with the L.A. Weekly's finances say the paper came under
increasing pressure from CEO David Schneiderman to emphasize its
profitable entertainment and lifestyle coverage after the Sept. 11
attack, which deeply depressed advertising revenue at the Village
Voice.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the witnesses said, annual return on equity at
the Weekly declined from about 29% to 26%. The chain's executives
became concerned that the combined fall at their two crown jewels
would undermine their ability to service the substantial debt
incurred when the company was purchased from its previous owner.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses in both Cleveland and Los Angeles said prosecutors
appear keenly interested in fashioning a remedy, perhaps by way of a
settlement, that would restore competition to both cities'
alternative press markets. During the more than nine hours government
lawyers questioned former Cleveland Free Times publisher Matt Fabyan,
for example, they repeatedly returned to the question of what sort of
help he would need to move forward with plans to start a new
alternative paper there.</TE>
<TE>   "I got the strong impression," said one Los Angeles witness, "that
the feds are less interested in leading people off in chains than
they are in forcing a solution that returns things to the status quo
ante."</TE>

<HD>It's a narrated 'Life' for former president</HD>
<DH>Secondary audio option, developed to aid the blind,
features George H.W. Bush describing the action in the Capra classic.</DH>

<AU>Tracy L. Scott</AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This year, the Frank Capra Christmas classic "It's a Wonderful Life"
features former President George H.W. Bush in a major role.</LD>
<LD>   He cannot be seen, but he can be heard by viewers whose
televisions come equipped with the secondary audio program option.</LD>
<LD>   The new version of "It's a Wonderful Life," including Bush's
narrative, first aired on Dec. 7 and will repeat Tuesday at 8 p.m. on
NBC.</LD>
<TE>   The movie's video description, provided by TheatreVision, is
available on a separate track that allows blind and visually impaired
viewers to hear a description of the on-screen action.</TE>
<TE>   The secondary audio feature must be activated by the television's
remote device. Most newer sets come equipped with the technology,
which often is used to add a secondary Spanish-language audio track
to television programs.</TE>
<TE>   The described audio feature was introduced in 1985 by WGBH in
Boston, the PBS station that developed Descriptive Video Service, the
first of its kind.</TE>
<TE>   According to Larry Goldberg, director of the National Center for
Accessible Media, several companies offer such service, and each
offers something unique.</TE>
<TE>   TheatreVision was the first to provide descriptive service in
movie theaters; it is available at some movie houses in Los Angeles
and Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   The company often uses celebrities to provide narration, including
Samuel L. Jackson, Pat Morita, Katharine Hepburn, Monty Hall, William
Shatner and Angie Dickinson.</TE>
<TE>   Using celebrities and people who portrayed characters in a movie
to describe action adds a "different touch of excitement," said Helen
Harris, president of RP (retinitis pigmentosa) International, the
developer of TheatreVision.</TE>
<TE>   However, most of the widely used descriptive services prefer not
to use famous personalities.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not believe in celebrity narrators. That calls much too
much attention to the narration," said Goldberg. Instead, WGBH and
the National Captioning Institute in Vienna, Va., use voice-over
artists who are trained not to be intrusive.</TE>
<TE>   The Narrative Television Network, situated in Tulsa, Okla., has
been providing descriptive audio since 1988. Jim Stovall, the company
president, said it uses four full-time narrators. Stovall, who is
blind, said it is important that the listener recognize the voice of
the person doing the describing and not confuse that narrator with
one of the characters.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the four larger services, some smaller
organizations describe action for live theater and industrial tapes,
Goldberg said.</TE>
<TE>   There are approximately 6.3 million blind and visually impaired
people in the United States, according to the National Health
Interview Survey conducted in 1994-95.</TE>

<HD>Singer Shakira gives 10,000 shoes to her native Colombia</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>Colombian singer Shakira returned to her hometown of Barranquilla
this week to donate 10,000 pairs of tennis shoes to impoverished
children.</LD>
<LD>   The Latin pop star sang for the children Thursday night and urged
them to take part in sports.</LD>
<LD>   Shakira said she remembered "seeing many children in the streets
playing soccer without shoes" in Barranquilla, a city on Colombia's
Caribbean coast 435 miles north of Bogota.</LD>
<TE>   The donation was made through the Barefoot Foundation, named after
one of Shakira's discs, called "Pies Descalzos" in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   In October, at the first MTV Video Music Awards Latin America,
Shakira swept all five categories in which she was nominated,
including artist of the year. A month earlier, Shakira won a Latin
Grammy for her "Suerte" video, the Spanish-language version of her
hit "Whenever, Wherever."</TE>

<HD>'Merry-thon' unwraps 48 hours of seasonal favorites</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Sachs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Christmas just a few days away, TV Land has called upon its
extended family of shows to provide an early present for viewers with
a 48-hour block of yule-themed episodes that it's calling a
"Merry-thon."</LD>
<LD>   The programming feast, which begins at 6 this morning, is
particularly notable for how deep the cable channel has reached into
its bag of classic goodies. Along with such long-running,
heavy-rotation chestnuts as "The Bob Newhart Show," "The Jeffersons"
and "The Dick Van Dyke Show" are Christmas programs from "Chico and
the Man," "Hazel" and "Fish."</LD>
<LD>   And it's not all sitcoms. "Gunsmoke" opens the marathon this
morning with an hourlong episode titled "P.S. Murray Christmas," and
later shows include entries from "The Waltons" and "S.W.A.T." Several
of the episodes, including the "Gunsmoke" opener, will be repeated
during the 48-hour block.</LD>
<TE>   It's also interesting to note the downbeat elements of some of
these Christmas shows. Everybody is depressed on the episode from
"Perfect Strangers." Fonzie has bitter memories of his father in
"Happy Days." And the title of that "S.W.A.T" episode? It's "Silent
Night, Deadly Night."</TE>
<TE>   But cheer up; there's a seldom seen Christmas flashback episode
from "I Love Lucy," and "The Monkees" try to teach a cold-hearted
child the true meaning of the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   And for sheer staying power, it's hard to beat the "The
Honeymooners' " take on the "The Gift of the Magi" tale, in which a
cash-strapped Ralph sells his beloved bowling ball so he can buy wife
Alice a present.</TE>
<TE>   When Jackie Gleason breaks character at the end of the episode to
wish one and all a merry Christmas, it's truly a gift that keeps on
giving.</TE>

<HD>Socks? Oh, you shouldn't have</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE>One in a series of holiday essays.</SE>
<AU>Shawn Hubler</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jillian Venters will never forget the "amazingly clueless" past
boyfriends, who, each Christmas, would lavish her with girlish
trinkets and pretty clothes. Hadn't she told them how as a 6-year-old
she had dreamed of being the Wicked Witch of the West when she grew
up?</LD>
<LD>   Not that she's bitter. "I realized quickly," she says, "that I had
to find a graceful way to say, 'Uh, this is a very cute, uh, sterling
silver heart, but haven't you noticed the bat motif on all my other
jewelry?' " Today, as the online columnist Gothic Miss Manners,
Venters, 34, devotes space each holiday season to the all-too-common
problem of gift disappointment among Goths.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, it's an all-too-common problem among non-Goths, too, as
it turns out. Once the dirty little secret of the holiday season,
that sinking feeling that says, "You shouldn't have -- no, I mean
really!" now appears to be everywhere. It's the new fruitcake (not to
mention the old fruitcake).</LD>
<TE>   Fueled by technology and a confessional culture, disappointment
has become seasonal Topic A from news outlets to academic papers to
Web logs to, in the case of Venters' column, horror-fiction 'zines
read by people with lots of eyeliner.</TE>
<TE>   This year, recognition of gift disappointment as a force to be
dealt with has included a move by a majority of shoppers toward gift
certificates. Meanwhile, personal expressions of dissatisfaction have
become a seasonal standby.</TE>
<TE>   "Two years ago I got this musical jewelry box from my mom. I'm a
22-year-old male. Also, I never wear any sort of jewelry," moaned
NickLess on a forum sponsored by the Seattle-based somethingawful.com
Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "Three packages of freaking socks," read a posting on the San
Diego-based funny-funny-pictures.com humor Web site. "No wonder I
divorced him, huh!?"</TE>
<TE>   But gift disappointment isn't just about wildly inappropriate or
cheap gifts. More commonly, the gifts that fail to please are
completely reasonable presents -- for someone else.</TE>
<TE>   A lovely sweater for a woman who prefers jackets is not going to
elicit a heartfelt thank-you. Top-of-the-line fishing gear for the
man who spends all his free time on the basketball court is a similar
letdown.</TE>
<TE>   Until a little more than a year ago, Tim Koltek ran a Web site
that specialized in outing such perpetrators of gift disappointment.
Although the site is no longer up, "at its peak, it was getting
thousands of hits and had an online newsletter with a circulation of
11,000," says Koltek, 28, who now is the CEO of a Silicon Valley
wireless software company. "I was doing 10, 12 interviews a day
around the holidays."</TE>
<TE>   The interest in gift disappointment, like the reign of the Furby,
is in some ways a cipher. After all, off-the-mark gifts have been
around as long as there have been holidays. (Hard to imagine that the
baby at that first Christmas cried, "Yay! Myrrh!")</TE>
<TE>   But people who study the subject -- and people now do, in fact,
study gift disappointment -- point out that gift givers are only
human.</TE>
<TE>   Research at the University of Utah, for instance, indicates that
in most gift exchanges, good or bad, the giver's self-image matters
more than the recipient's self-image -- in other words, a lot of
gifts are given in the spirit of pleasing the giver, so it is often
pure luck that the recipient likes them.</TE>
<TE>   In another study, Cele Otnes, an associate professor of business
administration at the University of Illinois, found that not all
gifts are pleasing because not all givers are created equal.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people are 'socializers' who give to impart values that are
important to them," she said. "Some people are 'providers' who insist
on giving things like socks and underwear that they think you 'need.'
Some people are 'acknowledgers' whose intent is just to recognize
people such as teachers and secretaries in their social network, so
they buy something just to buy something."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, some people are just hard to buy for, a fact now
recognized by two surveys. Last month, American Express and America's
Research Group, a marketing organization, found that the number of
consumers who plan to play it safe with gift certificates instead of
presents is at an all-time high; in both surveys, the figure topped
50%.</TE>
<TE>   The good news, says Otnes, is that bad gifts don't damage good
friendships. "It isn't the thought that counts," she says, "it's the
relationship."</TE>
<TE>   That said, in the event of gift disappointment, etiquette experts
suggest a simple, fake-smiled "thank you" (as opposed to another
oft-suggested response, "Gosh, I sure hope this never catches fire,
really").</TE>
<TE>   Above all, Venters says, if your well-meaning aunt gives you a
fuzzy yellow sweater instead of that festive cheek-piercing you'd
hoped for, remember "rule one: Don't throw a fit."</TE>

<DH>Sales of clothing are No. 2 behind computers as more women
shop on the Internet and retailers learn from mistakes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Colker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Web sites that sell clothing are all dressed up this holiday season,
and they have someplace to go: the bank.</LD>
<LD>   Once relegated to hand-me-down status while books and electronics
thrived, the apparel category is now second only to computer hardware
in online sales.</LD>
<LD>   "Last year it was starting to do well, but this season apparel is
really hot," said Michele David Adams of market research firm
ComScore Networks Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Though analysts cite numerous reasons why clothing is finally
coming into its own online, Kate Delhagen of Forrester Research says
it comes down to one main factor.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first year in which the number of women purchasing
online exceeds the number of men, and women are the primary apparel
buyers," she said.</TE>
<TE>   According to a study this year funded by the Pew Internet &amp;
American Life Project, 58% of online shoppers are women.</TE>
<TE>   "For years, men dominated the online shopping universe," the study
said. "That made sense because men were more likely to be early
adopters of the Internet."</TE>
<TE>   But women have helped sites from L.L. Bean, Eddie Bauer and other
apparel retailers shoot past those for books, toys and even consumer
electronics, racking up $1.29 billion in online sales between Nov. 1
and Dec. 13, according to a ComScore survey. That's not far behind
computer sales, the top online consumer goods category, with $1.32
billion in business for the same period.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest online retailer of all, Amazon.com Inc., entered the
fray last month with its hugely ambitious apparel store featuring
clothing from Gap, Lands' End, Liz Claiborne and other well-known
brands.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of the number of items sold in the first 30 days, it's
off to the fastest start ever for an Amazon store," spokesman Bill
Curry said. He declined to disclose any sales figures, however, and
said the Seattle company is not planning to break out apparel when
announcing quarterly results next month.</TE>
<TE>   Delhagen suggested that Amazon might be persuaded otherwise. "They
say they are doing well with apparel, but analysts are going to want
to have figures to substantiate that," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Clothing sites didn't catch on simply because women took to the
Internet. Unlike with books, which are relatively easy to present
online, there were painful lessons to be learned before apparel sales
could take off.</TE>
<TE>   "We launched our site on July 17, 1995," said Anna Schryver,
e-marketing manager at Dodgeville, Wis.-based Lands' End Inc., the
leader in online apparel sales. "In the first month we had $160 in
sales, and we were thrilled."</TE>
<TE>   By last year, online sales for the company had grown to $327
million, and they were up another 45% in the first half of 2002
compared with the same period in 2001. Online sales account for about
a quarter of the business of Lands' End, which was founded in 1963 as
a mail-order company. It was purchased recently by Sears, Roebuck &amp;
Co.</TE>
<TE>   The first edition of the Lands' End Web site included only 100
clothing items. The rest of the site featured lengthy essays about
the company and its products. There was even a "Dateline Dodgeville"
section with local news about the town, including the tractor auction
firm next to Lands' End headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "It took us a little while to figure out that people were not much
interested," Schryver said. Over time the company dumped much of the
text, added detail shots of the clothes and added Web-savvy tools
such as a virtual model that customers can manipulate to approximate
their body shape and use to try on clothes. The site now features
about 1,000 items.</TE>
<TE>   Dodgeville recently got its second traffic light, but you won't
read about it on the Web. "We learned our lesson," Schryver said.</TE>
<TE>   "I love to curl up in bed and read a catalog. No one wants to do
that with a computer."</TE>

<LD>Warren N. Lieberfarb, credited in Hollywood as the godfather of the
lucrative DVD market, is abruptly leaving Warner Bros., where he was
the top home video executive, the studio said Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Lieberfarb could not be reached, and Warner declined to comment on
reasons for the departure.</LD>
<LD>   The executive was known to have been on tense terms for some time
with his bosses at both the studio and at parent AOL Time Warner Inc.
and had been critical of them.</LD>
<TE>   Lieberfarb worked for Warner Home Video for 20 of his 27 years at
the studio, where he embarked on a decade-long quest to develop DVD
technology in an industry initially skeptical about its feasibility.</TE>
<TE>   He was instrumental in getting studios to adopt one standard
format, avoiding a repeat of the messy early days of videocassettes,
when two formats -- VHS and Beta -- competed. His actions were
important for Warner, which holds patents on some key DVD technology.</TE>
<TE>   "He's clearly made an impact on the business. He's the guy who
fought uphill to get the DVD market established, and it wouldn't be
there without him," said Bill Mechanic, former movie chief at 20th
Century Fox and, before that, head of home video at Walt Disney Co.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberfarb was openly disillusioned with the ill-fated merger of
America Online and Time Warner, which he believed was mismanaged. He
was especially unhappy at having been rewarded for his moneymaking
DVD efforts with options on AOL Time Warner's now-depressed stock.</TE>
<TE>   Known as an abrasive, opinionated executive, Lieberfarb complained
about being passed over for bigger jobs at the company.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he took pride in what he called "Lieberfarbian
controversies," often irritating other executives in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   He aggressively pushed the sale of DVDs by cutting prices --
something that didn't endear him to competitors or to Blockbuster
Inc., which has seen its video rental business erode as consumers opt
to buy DVDs.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the giant video chain said its earnings would fall
short of expectations, causing its stock price to plunge.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberfarb has long argued that Hollywood is too beholden to
Blockbuster.</TE>
<TE>   Pushed by Warner and its home entertainment chief, the studios
have increasingly emphasized DVD sales through mass merchandisers
such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Best Buy Inc.</TE>
<TE>   No successor was named, but the company said one would come from
within its ranks.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Warner Bros. Chief Executive Barry Meyer called
Lieberfarb "a true visionary and a world-class executive."</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner Chief Executive Richard D. Parsons said Lieberfarb
"combines being a visionary and strategist with being a hands-on,
first-class operating executive."</TE>

<HD>SoCal Edison Prepares to Buy Electricity Once Again</HD>
<DH>Three utilities will resume a job given up during the
state's electricity crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Closing a dark chapter from California's electricity crisis, Southern
California Edison Co. announced Friday that it was ready once again
to do what utilities normally do: buy power for customers.</LD>
<LD>   PG&amp;E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. and Sempra Energy's San
Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. also said they were poised to return to
electricity buying after actions taken this week by the California
Public Utilities Commission, although PG&amp;E still awaits Bankruptcy
Court approval of electricity expenditures.</LD>
<LD>   Rosemead-based Edison, with 12 million customers, said it would
begin buying power Jan. 1 -- despite reservations about portions of
the PUC orders that, among other things, restrict the utility's
ability to sign contracts with suppliers.</LD>
<TE>   "We hope that over the months that come as we get into this
business again that we can improve some of the procedures and
processes that the commission has suggested," said John Fielder,
Edison senior vice president for regulatory policy and affairs.
Southern California Edison is the primary subsidiary of
Rosemead-based Edison International.</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Water Resources took over the
electricity-purchasing job in January 2001 after skyrocketing
electricity prices sucked so much cash out of Edison and PG&amp;E that
power suppliers refused to do business with them. The department's
power-buying authority ends Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   State electricity officials have expressed confidence that the
three investor-owned utilities will be ready to buy power, largely
through contracts with suppliers, to supplement electricity from the
utilities' own generation sources and the expensive long-term
contracts signed by the water department. The amount of power that
the utilities must buy is relatively small, about 5% to 10% of
customer needs.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC on Tuesday obligated customers of the three utilities to
pay a $4.65-billion tab next year for the water department's
contracts. The commission on Thursday directed the utilities to use
power from a mix of sources that is cheapest for customers rather
than more profitable for the utilities' shareholders. The
commissioners agreed to penalize the utilities if they violate the
order, but -- after heated discussion -- limited the size of the
penalties in a 3-2 vote.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission gave PG&amp;E
authority to resume trading electricity in California's wholesale
markets.</TE>

<KH>THE WALL STREET SETTLEMENT</KH>
<HD>Grubman May Agree to Fine of $15 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James S. Granelli</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack Grubman, the former Salomon Smith Barney stock analyst whose
rosy recommendations helped Global Crossing Ltd. and WorldCom Inc.
become telecommunications giants before they collapsed, tentatively
agreed Friday to pay a $15-million fine and be barred for life from
the securities industry.</LD>
<LD>   Grubman, who flaunted his close ties to the chairmen of Global
Crossing and WorldCom, resigned in August amid widespread criticism
for going beyond the traditional analyst function of simply
evaluating companies. He also helped broker lucrative investment
banking deals for Salomon.</LD>
<LD>   Such conflicts came under scrutiny after the downfall of the
telecommunications giants this year, and securities houses now are
keeping their researchers out of investment banking operations. In
January, Global Crossing became the largest telecom company to file
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. WorldCom eclipsed that in
July, becoming the biggest corporate bankruptcy in terms of assets.</LD>
<TE>   Grubman, who received a $13.2-million severance package when he
left Salomon, agreed in principle to the deal, whose terms were still
being finalized.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement was part of an agreement announced Friday between
state and federal regulators and Wall Street's leading brokerage
firms. Salomon parent Citigroup Inc. and other firms agreed to pay a
total of $1.4 billion to settle claims they misled investors with
biased stock research. Citigroup will pay $400 million, the largest
amount.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman "simply will not be permitted to go back to the securities
business," said New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said Citigroup Chairman Sanford Weill would not be
prosecuted for his role in asking Grubman to consider upgrading a
rating on AT&amp;T Corp., allegedly to help Citigroup win AT&amp;T's banking
business. Weill has denied any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman was once Wall Street's highest-paid researcher, at $20
million a year, and an enthusiastic backer of telecoms. He kept "buy"
ratings on Global Crossing and WorldCom long after they hit the skids
and their share prices eroded.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Grubman maintained regular contact with Bernard
J. Ebbers, then WorldCom's chairman, even attending board meetings.
Grubman also built such strong ties with Global Crossing Chairman
Gary Winnick that Salomon had a role in most every Global merger,
acquisition and bond offering, as well as the company's initial
public stock offering.</TE>
<TE>   The analyst and Winnick, a Los Angeles financier, grew so tight
that at a dinner at Claridge's Hotel in London, Winnick seated
Grubman with him at the lead table, along with then- Defense
Secretary William S. Cohen and former British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher.</TE>
<TE>   In congressional testimony this year, Grubman expressed remorse
for maintaining his positive outlook as WorldCom and other telecom
firms crumbled under massive debts and an excess of fiber-optic
capac- ity.</TE>
<TE>   "I regret that I was wrong in rating WorldCom highly for too
long," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman contended that he became better informed by attending
three WorldCom board meetings and by analyzing the company's
financial data days before the general public could.</TE>

<KH>THE WALL STREET SETTLEMENT</KH>
<HD>Brokerages Will Need to Mend Many Fences</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman and Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street's latest pledge to clean up its act is getting a
skeptical reception from some individual investors.</LD>
<LD>   At least that was the initial reaction Friday to the $1.4-billion
settlement between federal and state regulators and 10 big brokerages
designed to curb conflicts of interest among stock analysts.</LD>
<LD>   "It's going to be slow going to bring the average investor back to
the market," said Bob Byrd, a high school geometry teacher from
Greenfield, Ind., who has had money in stocks in recent years. "This
doesn't take the fear out."</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, it's clear that Wall Street still has a long way to go to
restore people's faith after feeding them years of allegedly biased
research aimed at winning juicy investment banking deals -- not at
honestly evaluating a company's prospects.</TE>
<TE>   "I will treat Wall Street in the future as it has treated me,"
said Frank Glaser, a retiree from Rancho Palos Verdes, who added that
he doesn't trust analysts "any further than I can throw them."</TE>
<TE>   Under the settlement, major brokerages are required to hire at
least three outside firms to provide stock research that supplements
their own work. Among the independent researchers expected to get a
boost from the accord are Value Line Inc. and Standard &amp; Poor's.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement terms apply only to the 10 large brokerages that
are parties to the agreement. It remains to be seen whether the
Securities and Exchange Commission will follow up with industrywide
regulations that extend to regional investment houses.</TE>
<TE>   Though regulators have said they wanted to create a restitution
fund to reimburse small investors for some of their stock market
losses, the structure of such a fund has not been determined. And
it's unclear whether it actually would be established.</TE>
<TE>   For individual investors, then, the value of the settlement
ultimately may hinge on how stock research is refined and
distributed.</TE>
<TE>   In general, it's "debatable" whether so-called independent
analysts are any better than those working at major investment banks,
said Tom Carter, chief financial officer of StarMine Corp. in San
Francisco, which tracks analyst performance on and off Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, any analyst's track record can be deceiving. "It's
just like trying to pick mutual funds: Past performance is no
guarantee of future success," said Jay Ritter, finance professor at
the University of Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Hill, director of research at analyst tracker Thomson First
Call, said certain independent research boutiques probably would
refuse to make their reports widely available. That's because their
institutional customers pay top dollar and will not want to see the
work handed out to the general public, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some individuals say they are inclined to do their own research,
anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "I figure [the professionals] don't know any more than I do," said
Tricia Cardinale, a hairstylist in Los Angeles who is a member of an
investment club. "You have to do your homework. You have to find a
company with a track record."</TE>
<TE>   Another area covered by the settlement is initial public
offerings. The pact bans steering hot new stock offerings to a few
select customers -- a practice known as "spinning." Still, that's no
guarantee that small investors will get a crack at coveted IPO
shares. Customers with clout still are likely to get preferential
treatment, Ritter said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the uncertainties, many investment pros said they believed
the plan would level the playing field on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to improve the independence and objectivity of
research to the point where it was, and where it should be again,"
said Ed Wedbush, chief executive of Wedbush Morgan Securities, an
L.A.-based brokerage and investment bank.</TE>
<TE>   But many remain skeptical. Marilyn Barrett, a Los Angeles attorney
and an investor, said analysts and executives -- not just their firms
-- should be punished.</TE>
<TE>   "This type of conduct can too easily become a cost of doing
business," she said. "Unless you hold the individuals accountable,
the same abuses will come back again."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Bargain Hunters Help Lift Beaten-Down Stocks</HD>
<DH>Investors also are heartened by a settlement with Wall
Street brokerages and easing of war fears. Bond yields rise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks jumped Friday as fears of war with Iraq eased and bargain
hunters bought shares beaten down by three straight days of losses.</LD>
<LD>   Investors also took heart from a $1.4-billion settlement with Wall
Street concerning biased stock research and data showing the U.S.
economy expanded briskly in the third quarter.</LD>
<LD>   But traders said the rally had more to do with investors looking
for bargains after the market's recent decline. As of Thursday, the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index and the Dow Jones industrial average each
had fallen about 6% since peaking in late November.</LD>
<TE>   "We were due for a little rally, coming off the levels we were
at," said Jay Finkel, senior equity trader at Lord Abbett.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow industrials closed up 146.52 points, or 1.8%, at 8,511.32.
The broader S&amp;P 500 rose 11.51 points, or 1.3%, at 895.76. The
technology-laced Nasdaq composite index rose 8.95 points, or 0.7%, to
1,363.05.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers by 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by
4 to 3 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow rose 0.9%, the Nasdaq gained 0.1% and the
S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.7%, snapping two-week losing streaks for all three
indexes.</TE>
<TE>   Trading was heavy Friday as investors positioned themselves during
the expiration of futures and options contracts. Friday also marked a
quadruple witching session -- when stock index futures, stock index
options and individual stock futures and options expired
simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   The expiration of so many contracts on the same day can lead to
wild gyrations in prices of the underlying stocks, though that was
absent Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Changes to the Nasdaq 100 and S&amp;P indexes also took effect at the
close of trading. The rebalancing can spark market swings, as index
managers whose portfolios track the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 must
buy and sell shares to ensure that their portfolios accurately
reflect the makeup of the two indexes.</TE>
<TE>   Heightened tensions over Iraq eased after U.S. officials said the
next milestone would be reached Jan. 27, when U.N. weapons inspectors
are scheduled to make their first substantial assessment to the
Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   The United States said Thursday that Baghdad was in "material
breach" of a United Nations arms resolution, a term that could
trigger war.</TE>
<TE>   Gold, which has risen in recent weeks as Mideast tensions
escalated, fell $5.40 to $340.50 an ounce in New York trading.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury yields rose for the first time in four days after Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said the economy is emerging from a
"soft patch." The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose
to 3.96% from Thursday's close of 3.94%.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of all 10 firms involved in the Wall Street settlement
rose, including Citigroup, parent of Salomon Smith Barney, which
gained $1.14 to close at $38.14. The Amex index of brokerage stocks
climbed 1%.</TE>
<TE>   * Nike jumped $3.57 to $45.10 after the world's largest maker of
sport shoes said quarterly earnings rose 18%. Nike rival Reebok
International rose $1.92 to $29.50.</TE>
<TE>   * Oilfield services company Halliburton sagged 42 cents to $19.08
after announcing that the Securities and Exchange Commission had
launched a formal investigation into its disclosure and accounting
practices.</TE>
<TE>   * 3M added $3.83 to $124.13, for the Dow's largest gain. The maker
of circuitry, television parts and masking tape expects growth in
Asia from sales of optical products and may consider splitting its
stock if the economy improves, Chief Executive James McNerney said.</TE>

<HD>Game Maker Midway Said to Be for Sale</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Midway Games Inc., best known for its "Mortal Kombat" series of
fighting games, is battling for its own survival and is shopping
itself to other video game publishers, sources said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Industry executives familiar with the situation said Midway had
approached at least two firms about a possible deal.</LD>
<LD>   But whether a merger or an acquisition will transpire is far from
clear. Companies such as Santa Monica-based Activision Inc. and
Redwood City, Calif.-based Electronic Arts Inc. are among the
healthiest of the game publishers, but sources said neither was
interested in buying Midway.</LD>
<TE>   Midway executives didn't return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago-based firm is scheduled to give guidance on its
quarterly results Monday.</TE>
<TE>   After 12 consecutive quarterly losses, Midway faces a crucial
holiday season. Even with strong sales of its "Mortal Kombat: Deadly
Alliance," analysts are speculating about how long the company can
survive as an independent entity.</TE>
<TE>   "They're doing OK, not great," said UBS Warburg analyst Michael
Wallace. "They have one game in the top 10, and that's 'Mortal
Kombat.' But all their other games did not perform well."</TE>
<TE>   Midway in November sold 345,000 copies of "Mortal Kombat," helping
the company generate $26.6 million in U.S. retail sales. But sales of
its other key titles -- "Dr. Muto," "Defender" and "Haven: Call of
the King" -- fared poorly, with just 21,000 combined copies sold,
according to Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan
Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Compounding Midway's difficulties is lackluster holiday spending,
which forced several game firms this week to revise sales
expectations downward.</TE>
<TE>   Midway has faced near-death scenarios before. Founded as an arcade
company in the 1950s, it was forced to phase out its dwindling arcade
business in the mid-1990s and begin developing games for home game
consoles.</TE>
<TE>   The transition was costly because the arcade and home console
markets are vastly different.</TE>
<TE>   Arcades rely on quick-paced action games lasting only a few
minutes. Home console games, by contrast, require hours of content.</TE>
<TE>   After heavy investments into developing games for Sony Corp.'s
PlayStation 2, Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox and Nintendo Co.'s GameCube,
Midway this year fully shed its arcade business and faces its first
year of revenue entirely based on consoles.</TE>
<TE>   2002 has been difficult. While sales in the first nine months were
up 55% to $111.7 million, losses continued to mount, hitting $29.1
million. As of Sept. 30, Midway had $64.7 million in cash.</TE>
<TE>   Heightening the expectation that the company may be sold soon,
Viacom Inc.'s chairman and chief executive, Sumner M. Redstone, has
sustained his longtime personal investment in Midway stock and owns
more than 18% of the company's shares outstanding. His former wife,
Phyllis, owns nearly 8% of the company.</TE>
<TE>   Some say Redstone purchased the shares in hopes that he would reap
a return in the event of a sale of the company.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Midway shares closed at $4.35, down 15 cents, on the
New York Stock Exchange, giving the company a valuation of $204
million.</TE>

<LD>Heavy discounting and a strong appeal to local visitors helped
Disneyland and Universal Studios Hollywood boost attendance this
year, even as the U.S. theme park industry overall showed a slight
decline from 2001, according to a report to be released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Disneyland's attendance rose 3% and Universal's was up 10%,
according to estimates from Nashville-based Amusement Business, a
weekly trade magazine.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives of both theme parks, which are California's
largest, said the holidays were looking strong and they were
expecting to post solid gains next year as well, thanks in part to
continued discounting and improvements in international tourism.</LD>
<TE>   But the picture was less rosy at other parks in California.
SeaWorld in San Diego, Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia and
Legoland in Carlsbad posted declines ranging from 2% to 6%, and
attendance at Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park essentially was flat.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Florida's theme park industry, which is much more
dependent on out-of-area visitors, had another grim year, with
attendance at the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World falling 5% and
Universal Studios in Orlando down 6%.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the number of visitors at Universal's park in
Universal City rose to 5.2 million this year, according to Amusement
Business, which tracks the 50 most popular amusement parks in the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   Much of that growth was due to the company's "buy a day, get a
year" discount program, a promotion that will be back next year, said
Jim Yeager, a spokesman for Universal Parks and Resorts, a unit of
Vivendi Universal.</TE>
<TE>   Disneyland, which offered discounts during the summer, drew 12.7
million people. But California Adventure, its sister park in Anaheim,
continued to struggle, with the number of visitors falling 6% to 4.7
million.</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co., however, is counting on the holidays to draw big
crowds at its parks.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a strong holiday performance," said Leslie Goodman,
spokeswoman for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Goodman said, however, that it was too soon to predict when a full
recovery would occur, given uncertainties in the economy and
lingering weakness in international travel.</TE>

raided a California medical center owned by the second-biggest U.S.
hospital chain.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of the Santa Barbara-based company fell $1.69 to $15.35 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. agents Thursday served search warrants and sealed off offices

<KH>THE WALL STREET SETTLEMENT</KH>
<HD>Investors Await Effects of Analyst Deal</HD>
<DH>Ten major investment banks would shell out more than $1.4
billion in fines and other payments, but many unknowns remain.</DH>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>As a long-anticipated settlement of stock-analyst conflicts was
rolled out Friday, the agreement was met with questions about whether
it actually would change the way Wall Street works to make it a
fairer place for small investors.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement was unveiled at a news conference at the New York
Stock Exchange, where regulators cast it as a dramatic reform that
would close "perhaps one of the darkest chapters in the history of
modern finance," in the words of NYSE Chairman Richard Grasso.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement with such Wall Street giants as Citigroup Inc.,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley "will result in
significant reforms that will serve investors for many years to
come," said Stephen Cutler, chief of the Securities and Exchange
Commission's enforcement division. It "is intended to bring new
integrity to Wall Street research."</LD>
<TE>   The tentative agreement would end a series of government probes
into whether stock analysts intentionally deceived investors with
bullish stock picks designed to draw lucrative investment banking
work to their firms.</TE>
<TE>   The deal calls for 10 major investment banks to shell out more
than $1.4 billion in fines and other payments and to take steps to
insulate their stock analysts from the pressure of drumming up
business.</TE>
<TE>   The deal also would ban the brokerages from handing out lucrative
new-stock offerings to corporate executives and would force them to
buy research from independent firms and give it to their own
customers.</TE>
<TE>   A final deal is expected to be signed next month.</TE>
<TE>   All told, experts said, the settlement sweeps away the most
flagrant abuses of the late-1990s market bubble and sets in motion
several innovative, if untested, reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "On balance, the [individual] investor is better served," said
professor Samuel Hayes of Harvard University. "This is about as good
as we could have hoped for."</TE>
<TE>   However, the settlement's true effect will not be known for some
time, in part because key questions went unanswered Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Though regulators said they wanted to create a restitution fund to
reimburse small investors who lost money in the market, its structure
has not been determined. New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer said he
wanted to reimburse investors but that a restitution fund may be
tough logistically.</TE>
<TE>   Another key question is how much evidence of wrongdoing will be
released to the public.</TE>
<TE>   The best chance investors have to recover money is to prevail in
class-action lawsuits and arbitration hearings, and voluminous proof
of misconduct would help their cases. Yet it is unclear how much data
regulators will make public or whether it would bolster legal
actions, said John Coffee, a Columbia University law professor.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way to get meaningful restitution is if the SEC and
Spitzer turn over the smoking-gun documents they've been uncovering
for the last year," Coffee said.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest unknown is whether the pact would succeed in restoring
investor confidence, which has been badly eroded by this year's
procession of Wall Street and corporate scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Some people doubted that the sanctions and reforms would have much
effect on Wall Street's behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "It's business as usual -- just a slap on the wrist," said T.
Sheridan O'Keefe, president of the National Assn. of Investment
Professionals. "Eventually, when this uproar dies down, things will
just go back to the cozy way they were."</TE>
<TE>   Regulators sharply disagreed. "A banker is a banker. A research
analyst is a research analyst," said the NYSE's Grasso. "Cross the
line and you're in violation" of the new rules.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators also dismissed the notion that the firms, which earned
billions in investment banking fees in the 1990s, got off with
comparatively light fines.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think you can call $1.4 billion a slap on the wrist,"
Cutler said.</TE>
<TE>   The penalty is the largest ever imposed for securities law
violations, according to the SEC, eclipsing earlier settlements with
Prudential Securities Inc. and Nasdaq market dealers.</TE>
<TE>   The fines will be divided evenly among federal regulators and the
states. California, the most populous state, will receive the most
money -- though the exact amount wasn't immediately disclosed. Each
state will decide how to spend its share.</TE>
<TE>   As is standard in any settlement, the firms will neither admit nor
deny guilt. But Citigroup and some other firms could be forced by
Spitzer to issue statements of contrition.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup, parent of Salomon Smith Barney, said that it has
"implemented new practices and standards" that make it "a stronger
company."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the firms involved in the settlement said they were glad
the deal was done and are committed to providing quality research.
Others declined to comment or could not be reached.</TE>
<TE>   In a surprise deal struck Friday, Spitzer announced that Jack
Grubman, a former Salomon analyst at the center of the credibility
furor, has tentatively agreed to pay a $15-million fine and be barred
from the securities industry for life.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer has said that executives at the brokerage firms would not
be prosecuted, but it is unclear whether some individuals eventually
will face civil charges.</TE>
<TE>   What is certain in the wake of Friday's accord is that some things
won't change.</TE>
<TE>   No settlement could resolve all of Wall Street's inherent
conflicts. Though analysts would be walled off from investment
banking, the split is not complete. For example, analyst bonuses
still could be set by overall firm revenue -- a major portion of
which comes from banking profits.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is there a guarantee that stock research, even that provided
by independent firms, would be an improvement. Boutique research
firms are expecting the huge payday that would come from contracts
with investment banks, and they could fear contradicting the analysts
of their new employers, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most important outcome of the lengthy probes, some
add, is that the accompanying notoriety has put investors on notice
to be wary of analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Equally significant, the controversy may alter the makeup of the
analyst ranks. As analysts became celebrities in the 1990s, their
salaries skyrocketed. Paychecks are certain to decline sharply in
coming years, weeding out those simply looking to make a quick buck.</TE>
<TE>   The most immediate effect of Friday's announcement was a boost for
brokerage stocks. With the cloud above them partially lifted, all 10
brokerages in the deal saw their share prices rise.</TE>

<HD>SGI Settles Charges in Russian Lab Sale</HD>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Silicon Graphics Inc. said late Friday that it would pay a $1-million
fine to settle charges that it sold computer equipment to a Russian
nuclear lab without obtaining a license from the Department of
Commerce.</LD>
<LD>   According to the criminal complaint, the company failed to get a
license when it twice in 1996 shipped equipment and upgrades to
Chelyabinsk-70, described as a "nuclear laboratory operated by
Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy." Silicon Graphics gets about 35%
of its revenue from U.S. military-related spending.</LD>
<LD>   The company had been charged with two counts of violating the
Export Administration Act, which expired in 1994. Export controls
under the act have been extended. The settlement is subject to court
approval. Sandra Escher, the firm's general counsel, said the
incident stemmed from miscommunication between the Moscow office and
the Mountain View, Calif., headquarters.</LD>

<HD>Undocumented Student Aid</HD>
<DH>Cal Grant money could put college within their reach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Theodore R. Mitchell</AU>
<BD>Theodore R. Mitchell is president of Occidental
College.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Monday's decision by the University of California and the California
State University to raise student fees has placed a harsh new
spotlight on college affordability.</LD>
<LD>   Lost in the debate over access are thousands of high-achieving
students in California who find they are unable to afford college
because they were brought into this country illegally as children --
and hence are ineligible for state and federal financial aid.</LD>
<LD>   Continuing our historic commitment to access is not only good for
individual students, it is essential to the prosperity of the state.</LD>
<TE>   As a new report from the California Research Bureau released
Monday makes clear, a college-educated workforce is vital to the
high-growth industries that drive the state economy.</TE>
<TE>   But the questions that must be answered -- especially in hard
budget times -- are who will have access to college and who will we
count on to sustain California's economy in the years to come?</TE>
<TE>   The key that unlocks the door to college for many students is the
Cal Grant program, designed to give scholarships to all needy high
school students in California who meet rigorous academic standards.</TE>
<TE>   This is a cost-effective investment in our future. But the sad
fact is that we deny this vital financial aid to thousands of
well-qualified students who, brought here illegally by their parents
as youngsters, remain undocumented.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of undocumented students see themselves as
Californians. They plan to live, work and raise their families here.
They are a part of our collective future.</TE>
<TE>   We can invest in that future by creating a special fund from
unclaimed Cal Grant dollars to be used as a pool for a competitive
scholarship program for undocumented students. The competition could
be modeled on the existing Cal Grant program and based on need,
scholastic merit and length of residency in California.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Bill 540, the legislation passed last year that made some
undocumented students eligible for in-state tuition rates at many
public colleges, could serve as a model -- and a spur to action.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the new opportunities created by AB 540, most academically
qualified undocumented students are still unable to attend college
because of their lack of access to state and federal financial aid.</TE>
<TE>   At a private liberal arts college like Occidental, almost
three-quarters of the student body receive some form of financial
aid. Most of those packages include a substantial amount of state and
federal grants and loans.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few of the most generously endowed colleges and
universities can afford to provide the kind of aid most undocumented
students require -- if they are willing to accept applications from
undocumented students at all.</TE>
<TE>   Brought to this country at a young age, many undocumented students
have grown up as Americans and share in the traditional American
belief that hard work and achievement are the tickets to success.
Many of these young people have the potential to become leaders in
industry, education and civic life.</TE>
<TE>   It's time to take another step toward claiming this important
resource and helping the Cal Grant program work to secure a future of
opportunity for all.</TE>

<HD>Santa Claus Is a Lie We Can Safely Tell Our Kids</HD>
<DH>Let the myth teach children the spirit of generosity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vickie Oddino</AU>
<BD>Vickie Oddino teaches English at Mission College in
Sylmar.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa is increasingly under attack. And that saddens me.</LD>
<LD>   In this zero-tolerance age, parents worry about "lying" to their
children about Santa, as if all lies were created equal, as if all
lies are malicious.</LD>
<LD>   Santa does exist, in the hearts of people the world over.</LD>
<TE>   Part of the reason for the lie is that when children are young,
they take everything literally. For example, my 3-year-old son is
convinced that God is a man with a long white beard and flowing white
robes, having dinner with Uncle Arnie. It is difficult for them to
understand the spiritual aspects of God and of the soul. To ease
children through this shift from literal understanding to figurative
language, do we shield them from God? No.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Santa may not literally have a long white beard and a
red suit. But rather than deny his existence whole cloth, we can ease
the transition from believing that Santa actually slips down the
chimney to understanding the symbolic importance and the spirituality
of St. Nicholas.</TE>
<TE>   To claim, as some parents do, that once a child inevitably finds
out that Santa Claus is, in fact, mom and/or dad, he or she will be
irreparably angry and the parent will forever lose his or her
credibility is an overreaction. Such a child has other, more serious,
issues that go beyond simple anger at this benevolent lie.</TE>
<TE>   Some dismiss Santa for other reasons. One friend boasts that his
children never believed in Santa Claus. He wants them to know that he
and his hard work are responsible for any and all presents. Another
friend's son asked Santa for an expensive scooter. However, Santa
would definitely not be bringing that; she didn't want Santa to get
credit for giving that cherished gift. These people are actually
jealous of Santa Claus.</TE>
<TE>   And what if little Tommy next door received more gifts? Does that
mean he was better? Sure, this is a problem, but if your young child
is busy counting his presents and the neighbor's presents, you have
allowed materialism to set in quite early.</TE>
<TE>   Is it fair that a child in a wealthy neighborhood receive more
than a child in a poor neighborhood? Perhaps not. But Santa is at
work even in the poorest neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Santa comes in the form of the Toys for Tots campaign, for
example, providing new toys for needy children. Santa comes in the
form of churches that prepare Christmas meals for the hungry. Santa
comes in the form of my son's preschool, which requests a monetary
donation from each child for the school's "adopted" family. Santa
comes in the form of my daughter's private school, which asks
students to donate food in the spirit of JOY, where the "Y" stands
for you. They are taught that they too are responsible for bringing
joy and hope, for being Santa Claus.</TE>
<TE>   So to those who are worried about losing credibility as a parent
for lying about Santa Claus, relax. Raise children who understand
gratitude, and you, as Santa, will rise in stature. In this season,
let's embrace Santa Claus, and in doing so, we embrace love,
generosity, humility, joy and even God.</TE>

<HD>Baseball's Ball Battle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First of all, both grown men should go stand in separate corners and
ponder their behavior in this feud over a used baseball. Last year,
Alex Popov caught Barry Bonds' record 73rd home run with a glove he
happened to be wearing in the right-field stands of PacBell Park.
That's on videotape. So is the instant assault by a mob of men (so
far uncharged). And so, soon after, is the emergence from the melee
of Patrick Hayashi, holding the ball. Superior Court Judge Kevin
McCarthy has ordered the ball be sold and the estimated $1
million-plus proceeds split equally. He's waiting 10 days to see if
the litigants grow up and agree.</LD>
<LD>   We appreciate the judge's earnest attempt at Solomonic justice. He
could have proposed slicing the ball in half to see which man
relinquished his claim in order to keep the ball whole. The judge's
lawyerly reasoning addressed what constitutes possession. But many
questions remain: Did Popov have both feet inbounds for the catch?
Was Hayashi a legal substitution? Who owns the movie rights? Why
would Popov use a softball glove at a hardball game?</LD>
<LD>   It's very American to fight fiercely for your rights, especially
if you can get rich doing so. It's also very American to sue in
court, even over a game, then appeal if you lose. That perhaps helps
explain why an overwhelming majority of humanity opts not to live the
American way.</LD>
<TE>   Here's an un-American solution to the Great Bonds Baseball Ball
Battle: Take this sacred orb from the bank vault, mix it into a bin
of, say, 49 other scuffed baseballs. Ask Bonds to sign all 50, then
auction them one by one to bidders who can claim they each own the
real McCoy. Split the enormous financial proceeds to buy new
baseballs for Little League teams whose youngsters spent the last 14
months watching this spectacle of alleged adults. The kids will say,
"Thank you." And everyone in the feud can say another two words: "I'm
sorry."</TE>

<HD>After Lott, Bush's Challenge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trent Lott's political free-fall ended with a thud Friday when the
disgraced and chastened Mississippian agreed to resign the post of
Senate majority leader. Lott's Republican colleagues ultimately
shoved the senator aside to staunch the damage he was doing to the
party, despite his ever-more-desperate apologies for waxing nostalgic
about racial segregation at Sen. Strom Thurmond's (R-S.C.) 100th
birthday party and in earlier statements.</LD>
<LD>   But Lott's announcement presents an even bigger challenge -- or
opportunity -- to President Bush and his supporters in the Senate,
who pitch themselves as compassionate conservatives and inclusive
big-tenters but who too often have pursued a different agenda on
civil rights.</LD>
<LD>   Few politicians or judges are as blunt or voluble as Lott on civil
rights issues. But for the last two years, the president's nominees
to federal appeals courts have tended toward lower-court judges whose
records display a striking antipathy to workers and minorities,
disguised in the carefully groomed language of states' rights.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Charles W. Pickering of Mississippi was one, a
Lott friend whose bona fides as a segregationist pushed the Senate
Judiciary Committee to reject him for an appellate seat this year.
Bush had vowed to renominate Pickering for what looked like certain
confirmation by the Republican-controlled Senate. With Lott
disgraced, Pickering may become too hot a political potato for the
president.</TE>
<TE>   Bush still stands solidly behind other nominees to appellate
courts who lack Pickering's blatant record on segregation but have
made their names by resisting this nation's commitment to equal
opportunity: Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Carolyn Kuhl, who
argued in 1981 that racially discriminatory Bob Jones University
should be allowed to keep its tax-exempt status; Jeffrey Sutton for
his antipathy to federal protections for state workers; U.S. District
Judge Terrence W. Boyle of North Carolina, a former staffer to Sen.
Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and twice overruled by the U.S. Supreme Court
for striking down minority voting districts; and Texas Supreme Court
Justice Priscilla Owen, whose undisguised activism on the bench
against abortion rights drew fire even from one of Bush's top
counselors.</TE>
<TE>   Lott's disgrace gives the White House and Senate an opportunity to
go deaf to aging former Dixiecrats and their debt to a racist past.
Bush, who appropriately called segregation "unfaithful to our
founding ideals," can further distance himself from the old double
standard by nominating centrists to the bench.</TE>
<TE>   He also could offer the most contentious nominees the opportunity
to withdraw. That would save the Senate's new leaders from having to
defend would-be federal judges who are exclusionary, if more subtle
than Lott.</TE>

<HD>Now the West Is One</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As fourth-graders zigzag through the galleries of the Autry Museum of
Western Heritage, hollering to come see this or that, the themes
change kaleidoscopically.</LD>
<LD>   Images of Jewish life in the American West mesh with posters
documenting African American cowboys, photographs of Mexican charros
in their silver-laced suits and paintings depicting Spanish priests
in their missions. The children's quest continues to detailed
artifacts of the westward march of Anglos and a replica of the
founding of Chinatown, where Union Station is today. A larger space
holds a Native American collection, telling of the group whose
cultural story is central to the others.</LD>
<LD>   Watching the children pass, John L. Gray, the Autry Museum's
executive director, explains the mission of the institution. It is
"the story of the American West. It includes many cultures, many
races, many ethnicities. And the whole purpose is to show how the
American West came together."</LD>
<TE>   Coming together to be stronger is also the driving idea behind the
merger of the Autry, with its $100-million endowment and its
financial discipline, and the venerable but fiscally broken Southwest
Museum.</TE>
<TE>   The merger should keep the Southwest's leading collection of
Native American art and artifacts together and on view in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   If all proceeds as planned, the Southwest will move to a new
building added to the Autry in Griffith Park. The two institutions
will retain separate identities, but their research functions will be
combined in an Institute for the Study of the American West.
Together, the three institutions will become the Autry National
Center of the American West.</TE>
<TE>   The possibilities for cross-fertilization are rich. Consider, for
example, White Swan, a Crow warrior who served as a scout for Lt.
Col. George Armstrong Custer at the battle of Little Bighorn. White
Swan turned to painting war scenes he had witnessed after being
wounded in battle.</TE>
<TE>   "To my knowledge," says Steve Grafe, chief curator at the
Southwest Museum, "no other institution has more than one of White
Swan's large muslin paintings. Combining the one from the Southwest
and the one from the Autry not only allows for an opportunity to show
them together, but alongside other collection items we have like his
headdress." There's also a Southwest-owned painting by Kicking Bear,
the Sioux chief, that offers a view of the same battle with Crazy
Horse and Custer's representatives.</TE>
<TE>   "The merger," says Duane King, executive director of the Southwest
Museum, "creates the potential for something that is much more than
what the Autry and the Southwest Museum could ever be independently.
And does it without taking away anything from the educational
mandate, the collections or the missions of either museum."</TE>

<HD>Afghans Seek Oil, Gas Field Data From Russia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Kraul</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>An Afghan demand that Russia return oil and gas geological data
"borrowed" by the former Soviet Union during its occupation of
Afghanistan in the 1980s has been ignored, causing friction in
relations between the two nations.</LD>
<LD>   Afghan Minister of Mines and Industries Joma Mohamadi told The
Times that his country has formally requested the return of the
extensive geological surveys.</LD>
<LD>   The Soviets "borrowed the data for safekeeping" in 1987 and the
Russians have not returned them, Mohamadi said. The surveys covered
the large natural gas field near Sheberghan that the Afghan
government says could contain hundreds of millions of cubic feet of
gas, a potentially major deposit.</LD>
<TE>   "The data is the property of the government of Afghanistan," said
Mohamadi, who has returned to Afghanistan after fleeing his
homeland's strife years ago for a career at the World Bank in
Washington. "It was not stolen but handed to them for the safety of
the documents. And now we want it back."</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan's energy industry has been left a shambles by more
than two decades of warfare, looting and anarchy. The data would help
the nation in its efforts to attract foreign investment in developing
oil and gas fields, which lie mainly in the northwestern part of the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Recovering the data might also help impoverished Afghanistan save
some of the tens of millions of dollars that a comprehensive new
geological survey would cost. Such surveys are a prerequisite to any
major investment in oil and gas drilling.</TE>
<TE>   As part of a $500-million agreement they signed this year, Russia
would supply oil and oil products to Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Rosneft, the Russian state-owned oil company that Mohamadi says is
responsible for the data, maintains that it doesn't know where the
material is.</TE>
<TE>   Most likely, this information is not kept in one place, Dmitri
Panteleyev, press spokesman for the Moscow-based Rosneft, said in a
telephone interview, and collecting it would be a task of "enormous
difficulty and effort."</TE>
<TE>   "And even if this information was available at one specific place,
there is no guarantee that the Russian side would be ready to share
it with Afghanistan," he said. "It is more of a political question
than an economic one."</TE>
<TE>   The spokesman also questioned Mohamadi's contention that the
surveys are Afghan property.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not that the Soviets came and took what the Afghans had
already obtained before them," Panteleyev said. "All the work was
done by Soviet specialists. Besides this, it was [done with] Soviet
know-how too."</TE>
<TE>   The dispute has reopened some old wounds and comes to light as
foreign oil companies, including Rosneft, are considering the Afghan
government's invitation to invest in energy development here.</TE>
<TE>   The former Soviet Union made huge investments in Afghan energy
during its 10-year occupation. Its oil companies drilled 100 gas
wells, 55 of which are still in good condition, Mohamadi said. The
Soviets capped them all before their retreat in 1989. The Soviets
also built pipelines, now largely destroyed, that shipped fuel north
out of the country as well as to Kabul, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Zakir Kadyrov, Rosneft's Kabul office chief, said that his company
is open to being a part of a consortium that develops Afghan oil and
gas and that his company brings a lot to the table. But he said he is
not in possession of any Afghan geological data.</TE>
<TE>   "The Afghan government is seeking partners. It would be nonsense
for Western companies to proceed without us," he said. "All these
wells were built with our technology. The other companies would be
starting from zero."</TE>
<TE>   Attracting investment in natural resources is one of the few
short-term solutions open to the Afghan government in addressing its
severe revenue shortage. Tax collections are virtually nil, and
customs duties are for the most part monopolized by regional warlords
who pass only a tiny fraction on to the administration of President
Hamid Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   All told, the Afghan government is responsible for collecting less
than 20% of its $460-million annual budget. Foreign nations and
multinational agencies have promised to donate the rest.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing energy as one of the few potential bright spots on an
otherwise bleak economic landscape, the U.S. Trade and Development
Agency is financing a $1.1-million feasibility study for a proposed
pipeline that would bring gas from northern Afghanistan to the Kabul
area to feed a gas-powered electricity-generating plant.</TE>
<TE>   Preliminary data produced by an August survey of the gas fields by
the U.S. Geological Survey indicate that "there is significant
amounts of gas there," said a government official who wanted neither
his name nor nationality printed.</TE>
<TE>   The World Bank has expressed interest in financing both the
250-mile pipeline and the gas-fired power plant, as long as there is
enough gas to make such an investment feasible, Mohamadi said. Hence,
he pointed out, the need for the data.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan is also trying to revive a transnational pipeline
project considered by El Segundo-based Unocal and other companies in
the mid-1990s. The pipeline would run from the major natural gas
fields of Turkmenistan and through northeastern Afghanistan and
Pakistan before terminating in India. Transit fees of between $150
million and $300 million would be a bonanza for the Afghans.</TE>
<TE>   But even top Afghan officials acknowledge that the transnational
project has little chance until India and Pakistan settle their
dispute over the Kashmir region.</TE>

<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>Tens of thousands of Argentines demanding food and jobs marched past
shuttered shops and hordes of riot police Friday on the first
anniversary of deadly protests that ousted the elected government.</LD>
<LD>   In the demonstration marking last year's riots, in which 36 people
died, jobless people, students and left-wing militants peacefully
rallied outside the pink presidential palace to protest the country's
worst economic depression.</LD>
<LD>   "Get Rid of Them All!" read a massive banner hung near the palace,
alluding to politicians of every hue blamed for a severe economic
contraction.</LD>
<TE>   One of Latin America's largest economies and a model of market
reform in the 1990s, Argentina crashed this year amid a debt default
and a massive currency devaluation.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands from the jobless ranks, who make up nearly a quarter of
the work force, protested from northern Andean provinces to Atlantic
seaside resorts in a nation the size of India and home to 38 million
people. It was a second and final day of protests.</TE>
<TE>   Before dawn, bombs broke windows and spewed pamphlets criticizing
the International Monetary Fund. The explosions occurred near a
branch of Citibank and Spanish-run Telefonica 18 miles from the
capital.</TE>
<TE>   Some shopkeepers openly carried guns to deter a repeat of looting
a year ago that sparked chaos as Congress appointed four presidents
in two weeks. The last, Eduardo Duhalde, has said he will resign
before completing his term. Elections are scheduled for April.</TE>
<TE>   Half of all Argentines live below the poverty line. Malnourished
children are dying in the impoverished north, in a nation that
produces enough food to feed the United States.</TE>

<LD>   The quotas, many sharply reduced from 2002 levels, were more than
initially proposed but still angered fishermen.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists say cod stocks in northern EU waters are at the lowest

<HD>New Phase of War on Terror Moves to E. Africa</HD>
<DH>American military presence is beefed up as a Navy vessel
becomes a mobile forward base.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ABOARD THE USS MT. WHITNEY</DL>
<LD>Amid paper Santas, boughs of holly and a portrait of a bullet-riddled
Osama bin Laden, the commander of the next phase of the U.S.-declared
war on terror laid down the gauntlet Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "We're coming, we're hunting, we're relentless," U.S. Marine Maj.
Gen. John F. Sattler declared as this high-tech floating intelligence
center cruised the troubled waters of the Gulf of Aden. "If they
stumble, we'll bring them to justice. Even if they don't stumble, if
they sleep a little too early one night or a little too late one
morning, we'll be there."</LD>
<LD>   As the prospect of war with Iraq looms, most eyes are focused on
America's military buildup in the Persian Gulf. But Sattler and his
new command ship are emblematic of how U.S. military forces have been
beefed up in East Africa as well, in the first major presence in the
region since their bitter departure from Somalia nearly a decade ago.</LD>
<TE>   "This fight cannot be put on the back burner," Sattler said. "The
global war on terrorism is continual, regardless of what else happens
around the world."</TE>
<TE>   Sattler on Friday detailed for the first time a new U.S. strategy
in eastern Africa to track -- and attack -- terrorist suspects
throughout the seven-nation region of Somalia, Yemen, Kenya,
Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti and Sudan.</TE>
<TE>   The new mission officially began this week, less than a month
after lethal terror attacks in Kenya just down the coast. The mandate
is to target Al Qaeda members and other terrorists who, intelligence
sources say, have fled Afghanistan for havens here.</TE>
<TE>   Sattler declined to comment on whether last month's attack by an
unmanned CIA Predator drone that killed a carload of Al Qaeda
suspects in Yemen was a prototype of the new campaign. But, he added,
"if I were a terrorist and I thought I was happily driving down the
road with my terrorist buddies and all of a sudden with no warning I
cease to exist, I would be looking left, right and, now, up, because
we're out there."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has yet to outline the rules of engagement
of the mission, and the Yemen strike raised legal issues about
targeted killings. After the attack, President Bush said only, "The
best way to keep America safe from terrorism is to go after
terrorists where they plan and hide."</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece of the mission here is the Mt. Whitney itself, a
U.S. Navy amphibious command ship that has been transformed into a
mobile forward base for the effort.</TE>
<TE>   The Horn of Africa is a region of great concern in the anti-terror
effort. Bin Laden lived in Sudan for four years in the 1990s. Many of
his followers are from Yemen. His suicide bombers have attacked U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. And the deep poverty of Djibouti,
Ethiopia and Eritrea provides rich breeding grounds for future
supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Sattler described the mission as "detect, disrupt, defeat and
deny." The goal is to locate terrorists through intelligence from the
military, the CIA and international coalition members; dismantle
their financial and logistics networks; capture them through arrest
or "violent military action"; and then "change the environment so
that once we move out, the countries within the Horn of Africa are
able to maintain that stable presence."</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing everything from hanging doors to hanging curtains to
breaking doors and breaking windows," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sattler said he will use his seaborne center to deploy air and
land assets that include special forces, members of all four armed
services and the new U.S. Camp Lemonier in Djibouti. The 80-acre base
is America's first in East Africa since a firefight in Mogadishu, the
Somali capital, killed 18 U.S. soldiers and drove the United States
from a failed U.N. mission to rebuild Somalia in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   The Mt. Whitney is equipped with an electronic war room, vast
databases and constant satellite feeds of the latest real-time
intelligence on suspected terror activities across the globe.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is intelligence out there that we can't receive back on
this ship, the next time we go to shore I will buy you the libation
of your choice," Sattler said before allowing a small group of
journalists to tour the Whitney's joint operations center.</TE>
<TE>   But the ship also includes human resources, some of them witnesses
to the Somalia mission -- and the toll of terror attacks in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Jaja O'Neil was blown 3 feet into the
air near the bow of the U.S. destroyer Cole when terrorists rammed it
with a suicide boat in nearby Yemen two years ago, killing 17
sailors. On Friday, O'Neil sat in the joint operations center of the
Mt. Whitney, just an hour's sail from the Aden harbor where the
attack occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about revenge," said O'Neil, a 29-year-old Chicagoan who
volunteered for the mission. "A lot of people from the Cole got out
of the Navy after the bombing. I stayed in because I wanted to see
that the job was finished."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neil, who said his first name means "God's gift" in the Ibo
language of Nigeria, still carries the dog tags of shipmates killed
in the October 2000 attack in his breast pocket. "I also felt
compelled to continually inform my new shipmates about the security
of our business -- to not let them let their guard down."</TE>
<TE>   On deck, Marine Staff Sgt. Chris McDonald of Garden Grove was back
in the region for the first time since he manned a checkpoint in
Somalia in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a different mission," McDonald said. "We're going after
terrorists, to protect our families back home. Last time, we were
trying to help the Somalis out."</TE>
<TE>   McDonald, 32, is among about 200 Marines aboard the Whitney, most
of them part of a quick-reaction force that expects to be deployed on
land during the mission. Sattler also might move his command center
ashore, but only if it includes the array of intelligence assets
available aboard the Whitney.</TE>
<TE>   Sattler outlined a broad mission, ranging from hunting down
terrorists to humanitarian work in the seven nations, that is
intended to improve their economies, win new friends for America and
prevent terrorist bases from springing up in the region after U.S.
forces leave.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy is to bring to bear all military and civilian forces
in the area to maintain pressure on the terror groups.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to engage somebody with all of your talents and all
your spirit when you're looking over your shoulder," Sattler said.</TE>
<TE>   "You're constantly afraid somebody's breathing down your neck.
You're afraid to use your cell phone. You're afraid to use your car
more than one day, afraid to spend more than one night in a
location."</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged the difficulties the mission faces.</TE>
<TE>   "We may come up with some empty holes on occasion. We may come up
empty-handed if we push into an area," Sattler said. "But if somebody
was there a week or a day prior, and they shut down and moved on,
that's not a failure. That's a successful operation.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was easy, we would have already done it. But the other
option is to do nothing."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Plans Doubling of Its Forces in Gulf</HD>
<DH>Decision coincides with moves to share data on Iraqi
weapons programs with the United Nations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Wright and Greg Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The United States on Friday began sharing highly sensitive
intelligence about Iraq's weapons programs with the United Nations,
as the White House agreed to nearly double the number of U.S. troops
in the Persian Gulf region next month, according to U.S. officials.</LD>
<LD>   The Pentagon is preparing to deploy as many as 50,000 troops,
bringing the total to almost 100,000, Pentagon officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Both steps will increase the pressure on the regime of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein in preparation for a tough new round of
inspections that is set to begin in the new year, according to U.S.
and U.N. officials.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. intelligence shared with U.N. weapons inspectors Friday
involved a few sites -- fewer than half a dozen -- suspected of being
connected to chemical weapons production, U.S. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The hand-over of data is meant to test what happens to information
provided by the United States -- and to see whether it falls into
Iraqi hands before U.N. weapons inspectors can check out the
facilities, a common problem in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "We're starting out cautiously," said a senior U.S. official who
requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The new intelligence cooperation began as U.S. officials expressed
growing concern about the fate of leading Iraqi scientists.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe Iraq is taking steps to make people unavailable or
less available," a senior Bush administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   Some scientists and engineers involved in the production of
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons or ballistic missiles may
already have been imprisoned or put under a form of house arrest or
protective custody, to cut them off both from U.N. inspectors and
from defecting, the sources added.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's top scientists are expected to be the centerpiece in the
next phase of inspections, because the U.S. and the U.N. believe the
arms experts can uncover what Washington insists are Iraq's hidden
weapons programs.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, U.S. officials refused to discuss unconfirmed reports
from U.N. diplomats and Iraqi dissidents that almost three dozen key
Iraqi arms experts are unaccounted for. According to at least one
report, Iraq has issued false death certificates for scientists
spirited out of sight.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials would confirm only their tentative conclusion that
some of the Iraqis they want the U.N. teams to interview are likely
to be beyond the reach of inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   "We have reports that scientists may have been hidden away, and we
believe this is probably true," said a well-placed official who
requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. sources also said they had heard reports of scientists being
taken out of the country, being killed or going missing but hadn't
yet tested the Iraqis' ability to produce specific experts.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes those who are in jail are the easiest to produce," said
Ewen Buchanan of the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has promised to meet the deadline for providing a full list
of all personnel connected with its arms industry by the end of the
month, Gen. Amar Saadi said Thursday in Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and the U.N. are still working out procedures for
tracking down and interviewing scientists in January. They are also
discussing the sticky issue of what would happen to those scientists
-- and their families -- afterward.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, weighing in for the first time since a U.N.
assessment Thursday, said Friday that Iraq's weapons declaration was
not encouraging because it was "a long way" from meeting the Hussein
regime's obligation.</TE>
<TE>   "We expected him to show that he would disarm.... Yesterday was a
disappointing day for those who have longed for peace," Bush said
after White House talks with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
top Russian and European Union officials on the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process.</TE>
<TE>   In a signal of the intensifying focus on Iraq, the White House
also announced that the president was canceling a long-scheduled trip
to Africa that was to have taken place Jan. 10-17.</TE>
<TE>   A brief statement issued by the president's spokesman cited "a
combination of domestic and international considerations" and pledged
that Bush would reschedule his visit in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "You have the need to monitor the situation in Iraq," a White
House official said. "We're entering a new phase."</TE>
<TE>   The official also conceded that security in Africa, especially
Kenya, was a concern.</TE>
<TE>   The growing focus on war was also underscored when Bush met Friday
with Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Army Gen. Tommy Franks,
who would lead U.S. forces in any invasion of Iraq, to endorse a
proposal to double the U.S. military deployment in the Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all part of the keep-the-pressure-on-Saddam operation," a
senior administration official said, adding that a number of top
Pentagon and other officials will be traveling to the region in
January.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld is expected to sign the deployment order in the coming
days, Pentagon officials said.</TE>
<TE>   It is aimed at placing enough equipment and manpower in the region
to shorten the lead time for any invasion to a matter of weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "If [the president] decides to do something Feb. 1, you can't wait
till Jan. 15" to assemble the pieces, one Pentagon official said.
"You need forces in place."</TE>
<TE>   The deployment is heavy on equipment, airpower and crews that
provide logistics, maintenance and engineering support, officials
said. Although some infantry troops are expected to be involved,
major ground force deployments would come later.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more things than people," another official said. The
military already has about 400 aircraft at bases in Turkey, Saudi
Arabia, Oman and Bahrain, officials said. But the Air Force is
expected to send additional warplanes, including Stealth bombers,
which experts say would play a crucial role in the opening hours of
an invasion.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, about 30,000 National Guard members and military
reservists have been alerted that they could soon be called to active
duty, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Militants in Gaza Fatally Shoot Rabbi</HD>
<DH>Islamic Jihad claims responsibility for the attack that
came after the Israeli army raided a nearby Palestinian town,
arresting 10.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>With his wife and six children looking on, the rabbi of an
ultra-Orthodox Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip was fatally shot
in an ambush by Palestinian gunmen on Friday, hours after the Israeli
army had engaged Palestinian militants in a deadly clash nearby.</LD>
<LD>   The fate of the Gaza settlements -- where about 6,000 Jews live
among more than 1 million Palestinians -- has been the subject of
debate during the campaign leading up to Israel's Jan. 28 elections.
Amram Mitzna, the opposition Labor Party's candidate for prime
minister, says he would pull Israeli troops and Jewish settlers out
of Gaza, whether or not the Palestinians made any concessions.</LD>
<LD>   His party's platform, details of which emerged Friday, also calls
for handing over parts of Jerusalem to the Palestinians -- a stance
similar to that taken by former Prime Minister Ehud Barak during
U.S.-brokered peace talks at Camp David during the last months of the
Clinton administration.</LD>
<TE>   Those talks collapsed in acrimony, and the Palestinian uprising
began two months later.</TE>
<TE>   The left-leaning Labor Party is still running far behind Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon's conservative Likud Party in public-opinion
polls, but a vote-buying scandal has eaten into Likud's support.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington on Friday, U.S. officials met with representatives
of the United Nations, the European Union and Russia on a
long-awaited plan for peace in the Middle East. White House officials
said the plan was not yet ready, an assertion that other members of
the so-called Quartet group disputed.</TE>
<TE>   Associates said the 40-year-old rabbi, Yitzhak Aramai, was
critically wounded by gunmen who fired a volley of shots at a car
carrying him and his family near the entrance to the Gush Katif
settlement bloc. He died a short time later.</TE>
<TE>   In accordance with Jewish tradition, he was buried within hours,
in the town of Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv. Aramai, the rabbi of the
Netzer Hazani settlement, was a well-known figure among Gaza
settlers, and his death prompted cries for vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops staged a manhunt, but failed to find the
assailants. The Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad claimed
responsibility for the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Angry settlers demanded that the army demolish Palestinian homes
along the route where the shooting took place. Palestinians said two
houses were bulldozed later Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Before dawn, shortly before the rabbi was shot and killed, the
Israeli army staged a major raid in the nearby Palestinian town of
Deir al Balah, seizing 10 Palestinian militants and demolishing
several homes.</TE>
<TE>   During the demolition, which was carried out by troops backed by
tanks, shooting broke out, and a Palestinian was killed, the two
sides said. Palestinians identified him as a security guard.</TE>
<TE>   The arrested men were from Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Fatah
faction of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation
Organization, the Israeli army said.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials, meanwhile, made their strongest call yet
for the postponement of Palestinian elections, which have been set
for Jan. 20. The Palestinian central election committee recommended
that Arafat delay the balloting because a vote could not be carried
out while most of the West Bank's cities and towns remain under
Israeli occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat, who has been confined for months to his headquarters in
the West Bank town of Ramallah, has been hinting that it would be
impossible to hold free and fair balloting unless the Israelis pulled
back.</TE>
<TE>   Israel staged a sweeping offensive in the West Bank in April, and
has maintained an intermittent presence in most major Palestinian
population centers since then. The drive was triggered by a wave of
suicide bombings inside Israel that caused hundreds of casualties.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said that what could have been a grisly attack was
averted Friday when a passerby spotted a gift-wrapped package that
was abandoned near a shopping center in the Israeli coastal city of
Netanya. The parcel contained a powerful bomb with nails and shrapnel
that was set to be activated by cell phone, authorities said. It was
detonated by remote control, and no one was hurt.</TE>
<TE>   As the Quartet meeting got underway in Washington, President Bush
said, "I believe it is in everybody's best interests that there be
two states living side by side in peace. And this government will
work hard to achieve that."</TE>
<TE>   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer declined to discuss the timing of the
peace plan, which is known as the "road map," or whether it was being
delayed at Israel's request because of the impending national
election.</TE>
<TE>   "The president would very much like to make progress on the road
map," Fleischer said. "He thinks it's important to move forward. He'd
like to move forward at the first possible date that the parties will
be willing to give an effective consideration to the road map."</TE>
<TE>   Other Quartet officials said the plan was ready but that they had
agreed to delay implementation for the time being. "We have finalized
the text," said Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller of Denmark, which
holds the rotating presidency of the EU.</TE>

<HD>Venezuela's Military Stays Above the Fray</HD>
<DH>Few members of the nation's armed forces are involved in
the strike against the president, who has promoted loyalists in the
ranks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MARACAY, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Gen. Raul Baduel is a picture of calm.</LD>
<LD>   The commander of Venezuela's most powerful military force sits
behind a large dark wood desk surrounded by Virgin Mary statues and
Buddhist prayer strips. The smell of patchouli fills the air.
Gregorian chant music floats ethereally.</LD>
<LD>   Today's military, he said at a base here, is different from the
one that launched a coup against President Hugo Chavez eight months
ago.</LD>
<TE>   "What prevails now is a strict attachment to the constitution and
the law," said Baduel, the army commander responsible for returning
Chavez to power two days after he was ousted April 11. "Our democracy
has been strengthened."</TE>
<TE>   After 19 days of a nationwide strike that has hobbled oil
production and curtailed food and gas supplies -- and that sent
hundreds of thousands of protesters into the streets Friday -- there
are no indications that the Venezuelan military is ready to rise up
again and overthrow the president.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Chavez has managed to consolidate power over the nation's
armed forces, ensuring his grip on power in a region where the
military is often the ultimate authority.</TE>
<TE>   The military has largely stayed out of the protest, except for the
national guard, which has broken up demonstrations with tear gas and
has sent troops to guard gas stations and oil production facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Since the strike began, only five military officers have left
their posts to join more than 120 others who are waging a protest at
a tony plaza in an upscale eastern section of the capital, Caracas.</TE>
<TE>   Both the defense minister and the commander of the armed forces
have broadcast statements nationwide declaring that the armed forces
support a peaceful solution to the country's political crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The armed forces' commander, army Gen. Julio Garcia, went a step
further, condemning striking oil workers from the state petroleum
company, Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA.</TE>
<TE>   "There are now in operation acts against the constitution,
democracy and the order of the state," he said earlier this week.
"Acts that, in the specific case of PDVSA, constitute sabotage
against the principal source of Venezuelan wealth."</TE>
<TE>   That is not to say that there aren't still some segments of
Venezuela's opposition pushing the military to rise up against
Chavez. The opposition, which includes businesses, unions and rival
politicians, has maintained that it seeks a constitutional solution
through Chavez's resignation and new presidential elections early
next year.</TE>
<TE>   Baduel, who commands nearly a fifth of Venezuela's 45,000-member
army, the largest and most powerful branch of the country's armed
forces, said he has received dozens of phone calls since the strike
began.</TE>
<TE>   He said even members of the opposition Democratic Coordinating
Committee, a sprawling group of politicians and nonprofits that has
declared itself in search of an electoral solution to the crisis,
have tried to make contact with him.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to provide names, but he said some callers have made
it clear that they want him to help boot Chavez from office.</TE>
<TE>   "I have received calls, even propositions from a very high level,
propositions of an economic nature that reach into the hundreds of
thousands of dollars, seeking, to put it elegantly, that I influence
the president so that the president understands that he has to
resolve this situation with his resignation," Baduel told several
visiting U.S. reporters in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Baduel acknowledged that there are some in the military who
continue to wish for Chavez's downfall. But he downplayed their
importance.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't deny that there could be individuals that still have
adverse positions and tendencies apart from their constitutional
duties," he said. "But that's what it is. It's individuals."</TE>
<TE>   The military's strong backing has allowed Chavez some peace of
mind as he confronts the latest challenge to his rule.</TE>
<TE>   The combative leader said in an interview with reporters this week
that he has no "big worries" about the military but that he tries to
maintain constant contact throughout the ranks to counter what he
considers a media campaign against him.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to keep sending messages to clear things up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, a former paratrooper who led a failed coup himself in
1992, has spent his time since April placing his supporters in key
positions throughout the armed forces, using officers' behavior
during the overthrow as a test of loyalty to decide whom to expel and
whom to promote.</TE>
<TE>   Baduel, a close Chavez friend for nearly three decades, is a
perfect example.</TE>
<TE>   A fan of Sun Tzu's "The Art of War" who dabbles in Taoist
philosophy, he is committed to Chavez's vision of a leftist
revolution designed to help the 80% of this nation's 24 million
people who live in poverty. He even leads a committee made up of
local government officials to improve public health, build
infrastructure and provide training to those who want to start small
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Baduel was commander of the 42nd Army Paratrooper
Brigade, the unit from which Chavez launched his 1992 coup attempt,
based here in Maracay, a temperate city in a valley southwest of
Caracas.</TE>
<TE>   When top generals announced Chavez's overthrow, Baduel rose up
against the interim government and sent three helicopters to rescue
the president from military custody on an island off Venezuela's
coast. Rather than fight, the government collapsed, and Chavez
returned to power 48 hours after the coup began.</TE>
<TE>   In the ensuing months, Chavez promoted many of the high-ranking
officers who joined the ad hoc command staff that Baduel created to
lead loyal forces during the coup. Baduel became a general commanding
the army's 4th Armored Division.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez's attempt to strengthen his grip on the armed forces has
also benefited from a sort of self-purging.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the more than 120 officers in Plaza Altamira took part in
the April coup. They have announced themselves in rebellion against
Chavez and have declared the square in eastern Caracas "liberated
territory."</TE>
<TE>   Even one of Baduel's cousins, an army colonel, has joined the
group of dissident military officers, some of whom have been
dismissed from service.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the square is a hotbed of protest activity. People camp in
tents scattered around the plaza, which has grown fragrant after two
months of protests without consistent garbage service. There is a
stage with an enormous digital clock that counts the hours of
occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Some officers sleep in a basement beneath the square. Others sleep
in some of the private condos that surround the plaza.</TE>
<TE>   They have vowed to resist any attempt by Chavez supporters --
known as Bolivarian Circles -- to clear the square, although they
have said they would not resist a military takeover.</TE>
<TE>   The group is also armed. When a gunman shot three protesters in
the square Dec. 6, several dissident officers ran around in the
aftermath with their service-issued pistols in hand.</TE>
<TE>   The officers have said they want a peaceful solution to the
crisis. But they also say the military must rise up if Chavez drives
the country into chaos.</TE>
<TE>   "The armed forces must say, 'President, if you plan to use us to
go against the majority of Venezuelans to reestablish order, we will
not recognize you,' " said national guard Gen. Carlos Martinez, the
second officer to turn against Chavez during the coup in April. "I
would like [the armed forces] to be preventive to stop the loss of
innocent lives."</TE>

<HD>Incoming S. Korean Leader to Visit U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Trying to dispel an anti-American image, South Korean President-elect
Roh Moo Hyun accepted an invitation from President Bush on Friday to
visit Washington as soon as possible and pledged to work to
strengthen his country's alliance with the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   The day after Roh's victory in a bitterly contested election, Bush
telephoned to offer his congratulations and extend the invitation.
There is some urgency to the visit, expected soon after Roh's
inauguration Feb. 25, because of North Korea's recent threat to
resume its nuclear program. U.S. policy toward the North has been
stalled, in part because of uncertainty over who would win the
election.</LD>
<LD>   Roh, 56, a lawyer who once represented radical students, has never
been to the United States, and during the campaign he ridiculed as "a
legacy of the colonial mentality" South Korean politicians' fondness
for flocking to Washington to have their pictures taken.</LD>
<TE>   Backers of Roh's conservative opponent, Lee Hoi Chang, tried to
use that comment and others to depict Roh as a dangerous firebrand
who, they hinted darkly, would sell out South Korea to the North.</TE>
<TE>   On his first day as president-elect, Roh worked to soften that
image and to reassure the mainstream. During the telephone
conversation with Bush, he "agreed to work closely together for peace
on the Korean peninsula and strengthen the South Korea-U.S.
alliance," Roh's office said in a press release.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, described the 10-minute talk as
"warm."</TE>
<TE>   "President-elect Roh accepted President Bush's invitation to visit
Washington at his earliest convenience," Fleischer said. He also said
the United States and Roh's transition team would probably exchange
envoys before that meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Friday morning, Roh gave a speech in which he spoke cordially of
the United States--while hinting that he would like to see changes.</TE>
<TE>   "The traditional friendship and alliance between the Republic of
Korea and the United States must mature and advance," Roh said, in a
cautious reference to his demands that South Korea play an equal role
in the partnership.</TE>
<TE>   Like incumbent Kim Dae Jung, Roh disagrees with the Bush
administration's insistence on isolating North Korea until the
Communist regime repudiates its weapons programs.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not a matter of whether President Bush is right or wrong,
but a question of solving the problem," Roh said in an interview last
week. "One can use both a carrot and a stick with North Korea, but if
you use a stick and it fails, the results will be devastating.... The
carrot, I know, will definitely work in the end....There is no other
way."</TE>
<TE>   In Friday's speech, Roh also said he wants to address the Status
of Forces Agreement, which governs the 37,000 U.S. troops stationed
in South Korea. South Koreans have been calling for changes in the
agreement, especially since the recent acquittal by courts-martial of
two GIs who accidentally killed two South Korean girls with an
armored minesweeping vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Roh's supporters believe that the Bush administration should
listen more closely to South Korea in formulating its policy toward
the North, especially because Seoul lies barely 25 miles from the
demilitarized zone that separates the countries and could sustain
tremendous damage if a war broke out.</TE>
<TE>   "For you, North Korea is an important foreign policy matter, but
it is life and death to the Korean people," said Huh Un Na, an
assemblywoman who served as a Roh campaign advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Despite policy differences, Huh said, she expects Roh and Bush to
get along well because Roh is more American in style than most Korean
politicians.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that the United States is unnecessarily worried about Mr.
Roh about being anti-American," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Roh said in last week's interview that a healthy relationship
depends more on a South Korean president "who thinks rationally" than
on one who is in complete agreement on policy.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>Mother Teresa, the Roman Catholic nun who spent much of her life
caring for the poor of Calcutta, moved a step closer to sainthood
Friday when Pope John Paul II recognized a reported miracle credited
to her intercession.</LD>
<LD>   Mother Teresa will be beatified in a ceremony scheduled for Oct.
19 in Rome, her order said.</LD>
<LD>   Mother Teresa died in 1997 at age 87. A second miracle is required
for sainthood.</LD>
<TE>   The pope gave his approval to the miracle -- as well as 13 others
for other saintly candidates -- in a Vatican ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   The miracle involved the recovery of a woman, Monica Besra, who
had a stomach tumor.</TE>
<TE>   Her recovery came after an image of Mother Teresa was placed on
her stomach, although detractors have asserted that she also received
medicine.</TE>

<HD>Addressing the Apostrophe</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Some People Can Get Very Possessive About Apostrophe's,"
Commentary, Dec. 16: For years I have railed and groused about this
problem of using apostrophes to indicate plural nouns, but it has
only grown worse. Is it merely a symptom of our ailing schools or an
apathetic populace blindly following the many brazenly published
errors? I suspect the root of the problem is a little of both.</LD>
<LD>   The endless parade of apostrophe abuse in the media,
advertisements and signage breeds uncertainty in a public primed for
gullibility by ignorance of grammar. I won't attack our teachers, who
do as much as they can with not enough, but those of us in the
business of publishing in any form have a responsibility to be sure
that what we publish is grammatically correct. Making pretty layouts
is only part of the job. Ignorant mistakes are embarrassing to our
clients, to the designer, to their colleagues and to anyone doing
business with them.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I sympathize with Arianna Huffington's discomfort at the misuse of
the apostrophe. Last week I spent five days working on the film
"Seabiscuit" at Santa Anita. Each cold, dark morning when I arrived I
was greeted by several signs bearing arrows. One directed me to the
"Extra's Parking" area and another to the "Extra's Holding" area. It
appears that the sign maker thought that the horses in the cinematic
races would be cheered on by a crowd of one.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason why we have widespread misuse of punctuation
marks is that people who should know better don't set a very good
example. Some years ago when an NFL football game ran late, CBS ran
an announcement at the bottom of the screen telling viewers that "60
Minutes" would be seen "in it's entirety" on the East Coast after the
game. I probably wouldn't remember this incident were it not for the
fact that CBS ran that same felonious punctuation mark at least three
more times that season.</TE>
<TE>   While she's at it, I think Huffington should take on the
copywriters who misuse the word "their" in advertising, as in "ABC
Jewelry is having their annual end-of-year clearance." She could also
expose misplaced quotation marks. But let's not even discuss
"hopefully." As Edwin Newman observed two decades ago, "We've lost
the battle on 'hopefully.' "</TE>
<TE>   David Riley</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Woods</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The two best things about Huffington's commentary: The Times
purposely put an apostrophe in the headline ("Apostrophe's"); and I
can finally give myself a title. Ever since the Earth was cooling,
when I graduated from USC, I have been a "grammar scold," much to the
chagrin of some of my family and friends.</TE>
<TE>   One of the apostrophe gaffes that bugs me the most is when people
take a four-word sentence like "You are a moron" and condense it to
three words by incorrectly writing "Your a moron" instead of "You're
a moron."</TE>
<TE>   Robert L. West</TE>
<TE>   Calabasas</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I would like to add a postscript to Huffington's words concerning
the use of the apostrophe. Years ago I wondered what there was about
the Oakland "A's" that required an apostrophe. I figured I was
missing some hidden meaning, because it just glares at us on those
baseball caps. Along those lines, how about references to the
"1930's" or "1950's," etc.?</TE>
<TE>   Since Huffington opened the gate on the misuse of the English
language, how many journalists and reporters do we hear within an
hour's presentation who don't know when to use "there is" and "there
are"? Finally, to keep this short, where on Earth did "most
importantly" come from?</TE>
<TE>   Pat Ostrye</TE>
<TE>   Monrovia</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sorry, Arianna. I have a brickbat for you. According to the
Chicago Manual of Style, 12th edition, 6.5: "Abbreviations with ...
capital letters that would be confusing if s alone were added form
the plural with an apostrophe and an s: M.A.'s and Ph.D.'s." Thus,
G.I.'s is the correct way to form the plural, and "G.I.'s are
recovering" is also correct.</TE>
<TE>   Jackie Naiditch</TE>
<TE>   Altadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I had to nod in complete agreement with Huffington's rant about
the misuse (or lack of use) of apostrophes. As an English professor,
I get extremely frustrated at the same problems in my students'
papers.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know whether the misuse of apostrophes with plurals or the
lack of apostrophes with possessives is more irritating, but either
way, such errors distract me from the content of the paper and give
me a less-than-stellar impression of the writer. As I tell my
students, "Apostrophes are our friends."</TE>

<LD>Re "Catholic Church Must Lose the Psychobabble," Commentary, Dec. 17:
George Weigel's analysis of the current sex abuse crisis sounds
logical but doesn't match the facts. Is clerical sex abuse really
just homosexual molestation? Tragically, priests and bishops have
abused minors of both genders. To define the problem as clerical gays
run amok reflects the homophobia of many Catholic Church leaders but
not the facts.</LD>
<LD>   Was this crisis caused, as Weigel says, by weak, confused moral
teaching and a lack of firm leadership on the part of the bishops?
When we examine sex abuse at "ground zero," the Archdiocese of
Boston, we find no particular lack of clarity on church teachings,
and we see a culture of clerical authoritarianism as strong as any in
the country or, indeed, in the world. Treating the church like an
army won't bring about healing and justice. We need a broad,
inclusive consultation and participation in the governance of the
church.</LD>

<TE>   Weigel's commentary is right on. Cardinal Roger Mahony has been
the prime mover in the festering culture of dissent within the
Catholic Church in our Los Angeles Archdiocese. His call to open up
discussion on celibacy was quickly rebuffed by the Holy See and his
fellow cardinals. Bishop Wilton Gregory and other leading theologians
have rightly put the emphasis on a return to orthodoxy with complete
fidelity to the Magisterium. All of this has resulted in large
numbers of disaffected and alienated Catholic laity and clergy in Los
Angeles and the counties of Santa Barbara and Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   The sexual abuse cover-ups by our priests are no less heinous than
those reported in Boston. Up until 2000, Mahony would transfer such
priests from one ministry to another, and hence the flood of current
litigation. When the scandals erupted in L.A., his first order of
business was to hire a well-oiled public-relations spin machine.</TE>
<TE>   Our clergy, like those in Boston, must show some backbone and call
for Mahony's resignation. It is only then that the "healing process"
of renewal will begin with a return to true Catholic identity,
Scripture, culture, sacred art and music and tradition.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Weigel's dogmatic, ideological response to the Catholic Church's
recent scandals is breathtaking. The causes of the scandal, according
to him, are the weakening of the church's moral standing by an
acceptance of liberal teachings and by "confused teenagers and young
men weakened by a sex-saturated culture."</TE>
<TE>   Not only is he blaming the victims (an argument akin to the
rapist's "she asked for it"), but he completely ignores the central
cause, the central issue, the thing that most upsets about the
scandal -- that is, the decades-long policy of so many church
officials to cover up the crimes; move priests from parish to parish
without informing the new parishes of the priests' histories, thereby
endangering countless new children; and intimidate victims and their
families to keep everything quiet.</TE>
<TE>   This scandal has nothing to do with liberal Catholic theology
versus conservative Catholic theology but with a hierarchy more
interested in its self-preservation than with the well-being of its
flock.</TE>

<LD>"EIDC May Pay Some of Cluff's Legal Fees" (Dec. 17) touches on the
problem that community groups all over Los Angeles and L.A. County
are having with commercial filming in their neighborhoods. The Times'
articles in the fall focused on the alleged fiscal indiscretions of
the Entertainment Industry Development Corp. but did not fully
address the issue of just how these have affected communities at the
local level.</LD>
<LD>   For years, community groups attempted to get the EIDC to improve
consideration for citizens upon whose streets it issues permits for
commercial activities. It has been impossible to get effective
assistance from elected representatives at the city or county levels.
Your articles now seem to demonstrate the reason for this: Most of
the City Council members and county supervisors have been receiving
campaign contributions from the EIDC in spite of the fact that they
not only were directors of the corporation but also were responsible
for giving the job to the EIDC in the first place. This conflict of
interest vis-a-vis their duty to represent their constituents is the
truly significant issue that you have not reported.</LD>

<HD>Music's Tracks in the Brain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I read with interest "Music Leaves Its Mark on the Brain" (Dec. 13),
regarding the latest research by scientists at Dartmouth College that
measures some of the effects of listening to music. The article
mentioned previously documented research that indicates that the
serious study of music increases the size of the corpus callosum and
the amount of gray matter in the auditory cortex. Listening to music
gives a person pleasure and activates the brain in ways we are just
beginning to understand.</LD>
<LD>   In essence, the study -- as well as the practice and performance
-- of music makes you smarter. Music educators have observed this
phenomenon for decades, but those who fund music education for the
vast majority of Americans have yet to see (or hear) the truth. We
feel vindicated by the findings of the research, and it validates
what musicians and dedicated educators have long known and tried
faithfully to communicate to parents, administrators and school
boards.</LD>
<TE>   For those of us who work with young musicians every day, these
recent findings come as no surprise. Our music majors are bright,
articulate, excellent students and engaged learners. They did not
come to music inherently brighter than their peers. They grew
intellectually because of the advantage of an early classical music
education. Art education begins at home, but it needs to be further
nurtured in all classrooms, both public and private, as many schools
are successfully demonstrating. In the interest of expanding creative
thinking and imaginative minds, we recommend that all parents
introduce their children to the study of music. If it is good for the
most talented child, it is good for every child.</TE>

<TE>   Dartmouth music psychologist Petr Janata's assertion that "music
is not necessary for human survival" puzzles me. It is significant
that the ancient Greeks made Apollo the god of both healing and the
arts. They also (like the Chinese) tied music closely to the fortunes
and conduct of the state. The musical ideals of harmony, of doing
complex things together, of achieving unity in diversity, of
transcending the self, of becoming part of a greater, higher, more
lasting order may well be vital to the well-being -- if not of
individual humans -- of human societies. Shakespeare's Caesar may
infer this when he says of his soon-to-be assassin Cassius, " ... he
hears no music" ("Julius Caesar," I, ii, 204).</TE>

<HD>College's Wheelchair Speed Limit</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a 38-year-old disabled person, I am appalled by "Speeding
Wheelchair Users Are Put on Notice" (Dec. 14). For Los Angeles Valley
College to put a speed limit on electric wheelchairs is utterly
discriminatory. It is telling these students that they are not
trusted by school officials to control their only mode of
transportation. I use an electric wheelchair and consider myself to
be a very safe driver. In fact, in my numerous visits to Staples
Center and Dodger Stadium, I have yet to run into or cause bodily
harm to anyone.</LD>
<LD>   Valley College needs to stop segregating its disabled population
and begin treating its disabled students with the respect they have
striven so long to earn. Discrimination is a thing of the past. Being
disabled is difficult enough. Valley College should not punish its
entire disabled student body for an issue that might be the fault of
a few careless students.</LD>

<TE>   How ludicrous, stupid and just plan insensitive. I'm a faculty
member of a community college that has several wheelchair-bound
students. As I walk across the campus, the near misses I observe (and
they are rare) are the result of inattentive "temporarily
able-bodied" students.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the temporarily able-bodied don't think to look for
disabled students any more than they think to look for anyone else. I
have often narrowly missed colliding with a student when wheeling
audiovisual equipment to my classroom, because the student was
inattentive and walked right into my path. Should I be cited and
fined? What should we do with the administrator at my college who is
blind and who is frequently seen in the building in which I work
bumping into people in the lobby who are so wrapped up in their own
conversations that they just don't see the guy?</TE>
<TE>   I'm afraid that Valley College is just one example of the
insensitivity we as a society are developing to those among us whom
we declare to be less fortunate. We create barriers for them and then
blame them for their failure to meet our standards.</TE>

<TE>   Some administrators seem determined to make Valley College one of
the country's wheelchair-unfriendly colleges. The absurd implication
of the 4-mph speed limit seems to be "if you're late for class, get
out and walk briskly or run."</TE>
<TE>   The modifiers "bound" and "confined," which are so often
misapplied to wheelchair users (the wheelchair represents freedom and
liberation), will again be applicable. We're confined by the rule,
and bound to be late for class.</TE>

<TE>   Valley College's new regulation is a stellar example of the
slippery slope of knee-jerk policy. Offenders will receive a ticket
or even expulsion. Although no collisions have been reported and no
citations have been handed out on the 20,000-student campus,
administrators feel the policy is proactive.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid legal exposure and prevent this policy from being
discriminatory -- that is, having a disparate impact on a class of
individuals (wheelchair users) -- the college will wisely soon
initiate the following: Walkers, including individuals pushing baby
carriages and delivery carts, and drivers of maintenance carts cannot
exceed 4 mph. All people on campus are prohibited from riding bikes,
running, walking while talking, walking while using cell phones,
walking while eating, walking while drinking, walking while chewing
gum. New speed limit and other warning signs will be posted. Security
guards will be provided with speed-radar guns and pedestrian
intersections will be equipped with cameras.</TE>

<LD>Re "Gore Decides He Won't Run for President," Dec. 16: Karl Rove, the
president's chief political strategist, reveals his mean-spirited,
low political culture in his response to Al Gore's withdrawal from a
presidential run in '04: "I thought it would be a fool's errand, but
he's probably figured it out." In times gone by, we might have had:
"I'm sure Vice President Gore would have been an honorable and
formidable adversary in '04 and I'm also sure we haven't seen the
last of him on the political scene," or something like that.</LD>
<LD>   But that would have been in days past when literate public
servants on opposite sides of the aisle revealed respect for one
another as players in the tough work of running this country and
growing our democratic form of government, at least, I suppose, in
public utterances. Not now.</LD>

<LD>Many reasons are provided for why the current downturn in technology
has resulted in the export of jobs overseas (Dec. 12). However, the
tired old excuse provided by William Archey of the American
Electronics Assn. -- that if the U.S. wants to stay on the cutting
edge, it must do a better job of educating its workforce,
particularly in science, mathematics and physics -- is one of the big
lies perpetuated by America's technology industry. The U.S. educates
many thousands of skilled employees in these fields; they're just not
willing to work for $3 an hour.</LD>

<LD>Re "Justice Without Borders" (Dec. 16), about Israelis and
Palestinians who defy divisions in the ongoing struggles for justice
and peace in this intractable Mideast conflict: Both peoples are
plagued by leaders who are hard-liners and devoid of vision, while
the killing of each other's children hardens hearts and breeds
intolerance among those who must eventually live together. Such
forces bode poorly for traditional diplomacy and the success of
Secretary of State Colin Powell's "road map" for peace -- as does the
recent appointment of Elliott Abrams [to lead the National Security
Council's Office for Near East and North African Affairs].</LD>
<LD>   Recognizing this deadlock, an increasing number of Israelis and
Palestinians are acting out of a deep commitment to basic human
rights to engage in what we term "peace-building." In addition to
attorneys such as Leah Tzemel and Shamai Leibowitz, one can point to
the Israeli Committee Against Home Demolitions, Al Haq (Law in the
Service of Man) and B'Tselem (the Israeli Information Center for
Human Rights in the Occupied Territories), which documents abuses by
both Israel and the Palestinian Authority, as well as other
organizations.</LD>
<TE>   While extremists in the region promote religious states and
advocate "transfer," i.e., ethnic cleansing, these principled groups
are laying the foundations of a society where both peoples can pursue
their dreams of democracy and security. We should be supporting these
efforts rather than pouring billions of dollars of military
assistance into the tinderbox.</TE>

<TE>   Your front-page article on the Israeli leftists trying to aid
Palestinian terrorists in court is a good illustration of why most of
the Israeli public has such a low opinion of them. Nowhere in Arab
lands have Jews been accorded any rights, not that there are any left
to speak of following the 1948-60 pogroms and formalized
discrimination. These leftists have shown time and time again that
they distort and lie to advance their agenda.</TE>

<HD>Southern Strategy Backfires; Lott Resigns</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Leaders within the Republican Party, including President Bush, forced
Sen. Trent Lott to resign his leadership position on Friday. His
ill-advised comments have publicly exposed the reason why Republicans
repeatedly fail to make inroads with Southern minority voters.</LD>
<LD>   Those minority voters have known that Republicans in the South are
different from other Republicans. The growth of the Republican Party
in the once-solid Democratic South is the result of various
long-term, conscious plans to entice conservative white Southerners
into the party by using racial "code words." Republicans elsewhere
were content to accept these new Southern Republican voters and the
raw political power that came with them, only if the party's "dirty
little secret" would remain a private matter. Only in that way could
the Republicans continue to market and sell themselves to voters as
"uniters, not dividers."</LD>
<LD>   That myth is now dispelled; the emperor has no clothes. Republican
leaders are embarrassed by the public exposure of their cynical plan.
Lott has paid the political price for making the secret public.
Nonetheless, the sacrifice of Lott will not cleanse the party of
Lincoln of its sins, especially in the South.</LD>

illogical and prejudicial thoughts. In an unguarded moment you may
blast it out and ruin your brilliant career.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Weeraratne</TE>
<TE>   Marina del Rey</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Times has published a large number of letters and commentaries
attacking the record of the Republican Party on race without allowing
any rebuttal. You know as well as I do that the 1964 Civil Rights Act
would not have passed without the majority of the Republican Party in
both houses of Congress. The record on race of the GOP from 1933 to
1964 far surpasses that of the Democrats. Sen. Everett Dirksen
(R-Ill.) was the true father of the Civil Rights Act.</TE>
<TE>   Lott is resigning, as he should. The Times should apologize to the
Republicans it has smeared. Unlike Lott, I doubt that you will do the
right thing.</TE>

<LD>The capital murder trial of a Lake Elsinore man accused of kidnapping
and killing 5-year-old Samantha Runnion was put off until January
2004 after a judge Friday agreed that defense attorneys needed more
time to review the evidence.</LD>
<LD>   Over the objections of Orange County prosecutors, Judge William R.
Froeberg ordered the trial of Alejandro Avila to begin Jan. 12, 2004.
"My primary goal is to try a case one time and one time only,"
Froeberg said.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant Public Defender Denise Gragg argued that the defense
needed 18 months to review more than 13,000 pages of documents, DNA
evidence, cell phone records and hundreds of tips.</LD>
<TE>   Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas said he was disappointed
by the decision, but that he understood the judge's reasoning.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha was kidnapped July 15 as she played with a friend outside
her Stanton condominium complex.</TE>

<HD>FDA Faults Red Cross' Handling of Blood Supply</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein and Megan Garvey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal regulators on Friday disclosed widespread problems with the
screening, storage and distribution of blood by the American Red
Cross, calling into question the safety of the nation's blood supply.</LD>
<LD>   The FDA cited more than 200 safety violations and deficiencies in
its preliminary inspection report, the latest since the Red Cross was
first ordered by a federal court nearly a decade ago to correct
systemic problems -- including inadequate testing and tracking of
donations.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said they were still trying to determine whether the
latest violations, affecting a small portion of the Red Cross'
inventory, resulted in patients becoming sick from transfusions of
contaminated blood. The Red Cross is far and away the nation's
largest supplier of blood, collecting nearly 7 million donations in
the last fiscal year alone.</LD>
<TE>   "I am troubled by the apparent lapses in blood safety practices,"
said Dr. Mark McClellan, commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration, in a statement released Friday. "Our observations
appear to show continuing evidence of a culture that is willing to
accept noncompliance, as in many previous inspections."</TE>
<TE>   The news comes at a time of year when blood banks often issue
pleas to donors sidelined by illness or holiday obligations. FDA
officials took pains to say there is no risk associated with donating
blood.</TE>
<TE>   They also encouraged people needing blood transfusions to get
them. "The risk of not receiving a blood transfusion far outweighs
the risk of receiving blood," said FDA spokesman Jason Brodsky.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Cross, which provides nearly half of the nation's blood,
said the supply is safer than it has ever been. But the nonprofit
organization acknowledged some shortcomings.</TE>
<TE>   "The Red Cross understands more work needs to be done to further
strengthen our processes and procedures, and we are fully committed
to working collaboratively with the FDA to enhance our systems," said
Ramesh Thadani, the organization's executive vice president and CEO
of biomedical services, in a written statement Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Among steps being taken: the introduction of new technology to
reduce human error, the expansion of the quality assurance staff by
50% -- an addition of 175 new positions -- and improved training
procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Despite long-standing problems at the Red Cross, the organization
dominates the industry and the federal government is in no position
to curtail its operations. In Los Angeles, for example, the Red Cross
supplies nearly all of the blood used in hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Caplan, former chairman of the federal Advisory Committee
on Blood Safety and Availability, said the Red Cross has deflected
punishment by flexing its powerful lobbying clout, "using the threat
of no blood as a way to fend off the need to ensure they have the
safest possible blood."</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of this pattern of abuse, and they've gotten away with
it," said Caplan, a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA's findings, contained in a 45-page report, were the result
of an eight-month inspection at Red Cross biomedical headquarters in
the Washington, D.C. area.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators said the organization was unable to account for small
amounts of blood infected with HIV and human cytomegalovirus.
Cytomegalovirus, though a common infection, is potentially fatal for
infants of newly infected women and dangerous for those with
compromised immune systems.</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors also found evidence of employees falsifying records and
shipping orders without completing testing, as well as instances of
blood products that were labeled unsuitable for release and then
released anyway.</TE>
<TE>   The report noted that employees who saw problems feared coming
forward because of possible retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   A quality control officer at one of the Red Cross' national
testing laboratories described a "culture to hide problems" and said,
"There is a pervasive attitude that the staff can clean problems up
so they can never be found," according to the FDA report.</TE>
<TE>   The report said that the Red Cross had not fixed a host of
deficiencies identified two years ago when the federal agency last
conducted a review. These included a failure to properly quarantine
potentially contaminated blood, to follow instructions on an HIV test
kit and to keep track of blood supplies and donor medical histories.</TE>
<TE>   The reviews are part of a 1993 federal court order requiring
improvements. The FDA has grown increasingly dissatisfied, however,
with the Red Cross' progress. A year ago, the agency asked a federal
judge to find the Red Cross in contempt of court for "persistent and
serious violations" of blood safety rules.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, FDA officials said monetary penalties -- as much as
$10,000 a day for every new violation and as much as $50,000 for
every unit of unsuitable blood circulated -- were the only way to
prod the Red Cross into action.</TE>
<TE>   But Red Cross officials argued they already had invested more than
$280 million in improving safety and that such fines were out of
proportion to what had been required of other blood suppliers. The
two sides are involved in court-ordered mediation.</TE>
<TE>   The court battle with the FDA came during a rough year for the Red
Cross, which provides disaster relief as well as blood. It
encountered scathing criticism from the public and lawmakers over its
handling of monetary donations solicited in the wake of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, when some funds were used for unrelated efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Also controversial was the group's continued solicitation of blood
in the days after the attacks, although it was not needed. Thousands
of units had to be thrown out.</TE>
<TE>   Some industry experts defended the Red Cross on Friday, saying the
violations cited by the FDA were far from unique to the giant blood
supplier.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Michael Busch, vice president for research at Blood Systems, a
smaller blood supplier, said the FDA was picking on the Red Cross.
"They're, in my opinion, a quality, well-intentioned organization,
and they're doing the best they can," said Busch, also a professor of
laboratory medicine at UC San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Berman, a consultant who works for the Red Cross on plasma
derivatives, said payments for blood products are far too low. "It's
a huge fundamental problem and the fallout from that is that the Red
Cross is chronically unable to retain quality staff," Berman said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the FDA report's specific findings:</TE>
<TE>   Employees reported that they were encouraged to falsify records
and pressured to turn away fewer donors, some of whom presented
possible safety risks.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Cross did not adequately investigate post-transfusion
infections, particularly hepatitis, in blood recipients to see if
their cases were linked to donations.</TE>
<TE>   Despite being warned after the last inspection to account for lost
blood products, the group could not account for the fate of 1,062
blood products since April 2000.</TE>
<TE>   One of those was an HIV-positive donation of blood platelets
collected in Kentucky, which was discovered missing in February 2001.
Another was a plasma donation that tested positive for hepatitis C.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Cross had to recall 1,850 "unsuitable" blood products
since January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ronald Gilcher, president and chief executive of the Oklahoma
Blood Institute, said federal officials were right to demand action.</TE>
<TE>   "When you find this kind of a problem, you've got to fix it," he
said.</TE>

<CX>   Red Cross -- An article in Section A on Dec. 21 incorrectly reported
that the American Red Cross supplies nearly all of the blood used in
Los Angeles hospitals. The Red Cross estimates that it provides 70%
of the region's blood, although officials at other blood banks say
the figure is lower than that.</CX>

<HD>Suit Disputing Busway Report Is Dismissed</HD>
<DH>Judge says MTA did not break state law in its environmental
review of 14-mile route in Valley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Caitlin Liu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clearing the way for an east-west busway across the San Fernando
Valley, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge Friday dismissed a
lawsuit filed by a citizens' group challenging the project's
environmental impact report.</LD>
<LD>   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority "did what it was
supposed to do under the California Environmental Quality Act," said
Judge David P. Yaffe, adding that the MTA had adequately responded to
critics during its review of plans for the 14-mile designated bus
corridor.</LD>
<LD>   MTA officials said they are pleased they can move forward with the
$329.5-million project.</LD>
<TE>   "The Valley has waited a long time for this," said county
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who also serves as an MTA director. "This
brings us one step closer."</TE>
<TE>   The busway's opponents said they haven't ruled out an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "The public did not have all the facts," said Diana Lipari,
chairwoman of Citizens Organized for Smart Transit, which filed the
petition. "We still think it's bad transportation for the Valley."</TE>
<TE>   The busway, to be built over old railroad tracks, will stretch
from Warner Center in Woodland Hills to the North Hollywood Red Line
subway station, with stops that will include Pierce College,
Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area, Van Nuys Government Center and
Valley College.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the buses using the route will be 60 feet in length --
with an accordion-like midsection for turning -- and will be able to
carry 50% more riders than standard 40-foot buses. After an earlier
projection that an end-to-end run would take 28.8 minutes, officials
have since revised the estimate to 35 to 40 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Although California's budget crisis has put transportation funding
under a cloud, MTA Chief Executive Roger Snoble has said the busway
remains a top priority. The project includes $184.5 million in local
money and another $47 million in state money, MTA spokesman Marc
Littman said. Uncertain is $98 million in unallocated state funds.</TE>
<TE>   Still, officials expressed confidence the project would proceed as
scheduled. The MTA plans to award a contract early next year for
designing and building the corridor and hopes to begin construction
in March. The busway is set to open in April 2005.</TE>
<TE>   During more than an hour of oral arguments, lawyers debated the
safety of the busway, which will have about 12 buses an hour
traveling in each direction, rolling through intersections at speeds
up to 45 mph.</TE>
<TE>   John Henning, who represented the citizens' group, said the busway
is similar to one in Miami, where serious accidents and fatalities
have occurred. But Judge Yaffe sided with the MTA, whose lawyers said
Miami's dangerous intersections are not comparable to the Valley's
busway crossings.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley busway will have better signs, street paint and more
prominently placed traffic signals to make it safer for motorists,
said Jeffrey Springer, an MTA lawyer.</TE>

<HD>Blue Cross Leaving O.C.'s CalOptima</HD>
<DH>Thousands will need a new health insurance provider
beginning in March. About 5,000 must change doctors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Gottlieb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 30,000 poor, elderly and disabled people in Orange County will
have to switch to a new health insurance provider because Blue Cross
of California will no longer contract with the county's CalOptima
program.</LD>
<LD>   In a joint press release issued Friday, CalOptima and Blue Cross
of California announced the change, which will take effect March 31.</LD>
<LD>   CalOptima officials said patients would have to switch to one of
nine health networks that remain with the agency. CalOptima disburses
government funds to companies such as Blue Cross, which then pay
doctors to provide health benefits to Medi-Cal patients. But about
25,000 patients have doctors who also are enrolled in the other
networks, so only about 5,000 will need new physicians, CalOptima
officials said.</LD>
<TE>   A letter was sent to CalOptima members Thursday explaining the
changes. A Blue Cross spokeswoman said Friday that contracting with
CalOptima no longer fit into the company's business plan.</TE>
<TE>   Although few of the 275,000 people in CalOptima will have to
change doctors, Marty Earlabaugh-Gordon, CEO of the Coalition of
Orange County Community Clinics, said some of those who do may have
problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who have chronic conditions and are really depending on
their physician, they don't want to change," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Cross had been part of CalOptima since 1995, when the agency
began providing managed care to Medi-Cal beneficiaries in Orange
County. CalOptima receives nearly all of its budget, about $700
million, from the state, and is by far the largest participant in the
county's public health-care sector.</TE>
<TE>   Like other networks in the system, Blue Cross was paid a fee per
member each month. It was the second largest plan in the system. The
largest is the Children's Hospital of Orange County Health Alliance,
with 40,000 members.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Jankowski, CalOptima's CEO, said Blue Cross turned down
basically the same three-year contract that the other plans signed.
"It wasn't much of a case of negotiation," he said. "I suspect
they've been thinking about it for some time."</TE>
<TE>   Blue Cross remains involved in Medi-Cal programs in 12 other
counties. Because CalOptima is administered differently, however, the
company had to build a separate bureaucracy that cost additional
money, said Blue Cross spokeswoman Lisa Mee-Stephenson.</TE>
<TE>   The rates CalOptima pays its health networks are reviewed
annually.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the huge budget deficit California is anticipating,
CalOptima is worried it will be forced to cut back. CalOptima already
will be using $11 million of its reserves to help cover an
anticipated $20.8-million deficit.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Is Moving Forward on Vote</HD>
<DH>Preparations for election to fill spot on Board of
Supervisors will cost at least $270,000. Judge still might call it
off.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Seema Mehta and Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County supervisors on Friday decided to go ahead with a Jan.
28 special election to fill a vacancy on the board even though a
judge has warned he might cancel the vote.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors, after an emergency closed-door meeting, said they are
willing to spend the money -- at least $270,000 -- preparing for an
election that may not be held rather than postpone the vote until
legal questions are resolved.</LD>
<LD>   The decision comes a day after a judge said that a ballot measure
that made the election possible was seriously flawed and that he
might find it unconstitutional. Measure V allowed voters -- rather
than the governor -- to fill vacant supervisorial seats. If the
measure is tossed out, Gov. Gray Davis could appoint a new
supervisor. Five candidates are competing for the District 3 seat.</LD>
<TE>   "We abided by the will of the people," said Supervisor Tom Wilson.
"If the judge wants to go against what the people have put in place,
that will be his decision to make."</TE>
<TE>   Added board Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad: "Obviously, the voters
wanted it to happen, so we don't really have a choice."</TE>
<TE>   A few speakers who attended a public meeting held before the
closed-door session urged supervisors to delay the election, calling
it a waste of money until the judge makes his final ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm outraged that this board would be so cavalier with the
taxpayers' money," said David Thompson of Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unconscionable you would spend hundreds of thousands of
taxpayers' dollars on an election that might not count."</TE>
<TE>   Added Orange County Deputy Sheriff Thomas Dominguez: "$200,000 is
a ... lot of money. A simple delay of the election would avoid risk
to the taxpayer."</TE>
<TE>   The election will replace former Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who
resigned last month after being elected to the California Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer, a Republican, proposed Measure V with one thing in mind:
To prevent Davis, a Democrat, from naming his successor.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer on Friday praised the supervisors' stance. "We need to
fill the vacancy on the Board of Supervisors," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The people have a right to be represented."</TE>
<TE>   Measure V, approved by voters in March, established a county
charter.</TE>
<TE>   The charter's single provision calls for elections to fill vacant
board seats. In all other areas, the charter carries over state laws
and regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Andrew P. Banks said the measure could be
fatally flawed because voters were told that any future changes to
the charter could be made only by a vote of the people. In reality,
he said, state laws affecting the county can be changed by the
Legislature without a local vote.</TE>
<TE>   County attorneys initially told Banks during a hearing Thursday
that they were opposed to spending money on an election that may be
called off after he revisits the issue Jan. 21. They later said they
would move forward with the vote.</TE>
<TE>   The county expects to spend the first $60,000 Monday to print
ballot materials.</TE>
<TE>   One candidate, Bill Campbell, said Thursday it made sense to delay
the election. But candidate Jim Potts said that while postponing it
would have been helpful to his campaign, the board made the right
decision. "I think that the people did vote [for] V, and it should
move forward."</TE>

<HD>Colin Clark, 70; Wrote Monroe Book</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Colin Clark, a television director whose memoir "My Week With
Marilyn" described his close but never consummated love affair with
Marilyn Monroe, died of cancer Tuesday in his London home. He was 70.</LD>
<LD>   The son of British art historian Lord Kenneth Clark, Colin was 24
when he was hired as an assistant director on the movie "The Prince
and the Showgirl" in 1956. It starred Monroe and Sir Laurence
Olivier, who did not get along very well.</LD>
<LD>   In his first memoir about the movie, "The Prince, the Showgirl and
Me," Clark wrote of the co-stars' misadventures. He said he spent
most of his time as a go-between for the two and that Olivier
referred to Monroe as "the stupidest, most self-indulgent little tart
I've ever come across." The book was published in 1995.</LD>
<TE>   It omitted the one week in Clark's diary entries that became the
subject of his second memoir about the movie, "My Week With Marilyn."
In the volume he told of having the brief romance with Monroe.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, she was married to Arthur Miller, who stayed with her
in Surrey, England, during filming of the movie. Miller's brief trip
to Paris led to Clark's "dream come true," as he referred to it in
his memoir.</TE>
<TE>   The dream began when Clark was called to Monroe's house on
business. He bumped into her on the stairs, wrapped in a pink
bedspread, and the next day she invited him to lunch, he said. That
led to a day trip to Windsor Castle, a swim in the Thames River and,
later in the week, a call from Monroe's staff saying they feared she
had taken an overdose of sleeping pills. Clark said he went to the
house, found her alive and healthy in bed and accepted the invitation
to join her there.</TE>
<TE>   "You are like a beautiful force of nature, Marilyn, forever out of
reach," Clark told her.</TE>
<TE>   "But Colin, I don't want to be out of reach," he said she
protested. "I want to be touched." Clark wrote that he reminded her
she had a husband and that he then went to sleep.</TE>
<TE>   When the book was published in 2000, critics were skeptical. One
scolded Clark for letting England down. He continued to refer to the
incident as an idyllic "fairy story."</TE>
<TE>   After his adventures in Surrey, Clark spent most of his career as
a television director, working with Granada Television in England
and, later, PBS in New York.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his third wife, Helena, and a son.</TE>

<HD>A Cold Trail Ends at the Coroner's Office</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Warren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She was hunted by the state for 30 years, a wily prison escapee
featured prominently on California's 10 Most Wanted list.</LD>
<LD>   Annette Hernandez, a tattooed convicted murderer, jumped a fence
at the Corona women's prison in 1972, disappearing into the
surrounding cow fields. The breakout appeared effortless, perhaps
because Hernandez had been a trapeze artist for most of her life.</LD>
<LD>   Years slipped by, and the fugitive's file grew thick. Tips poured
in and fizzled, the trail grew hot and then cooled again.</LD>
<TE>   Last week the mystery finally ended at the Los Angeles County
coroner's office: Hernandez, it turns out, committed suicide in 1985,
swallowing fistfuls of prescription pills in a Bellflower apartment.</TE>
<TE>   News of her fate capped a long, strange odyssey for Cindy Tigh,
one of an elite team of agents who track escapees and fugitive
parolees for the state. Like her brethren on the force, Tigh had
hoped one day to slap handcuffs on Hernandez, ending the escapee's
life on the run. Instead, she can only tie up a few loose ends and
move on to another case.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know what you'll find," Tigh said. "At least we can
close this one now."</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of the murder victim, Stephen Paul Smith, are sorting
through a mix of emotions as they confront the news that Hernandez
has been dead all this time. For three decades, they coped with the
belief that Smith's killer was out there, somewhere, escaping
justice. Now, in an instant, it's over.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel a little cheated, finding out she's dead," said Rhonda
Smith-Hosler, a dental hygienist who was an infant when her father
was killed. "But I suppose this brings some sort of closure to the
whole thing."</TE>
<TE>   The bizarre saga of Hernandez is a rare one, in part because it is
unusual for a California prisoner to escape and avoid discovery for
so long. Breakouts were more common in the 1970s and 1980s -- there
were 81 statewide in 1985 -- but even then most fugitives were
rearrested, usually because they broke the law again or were turned
in by spurned lovers. Last year, 14 inmates escaped, and all were
recaptured.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, however, was different, managing to live in the shadows
-- briefly in the Bay Area but mostly in Southern California. Details
of her life as a fugitive are sketchy, in part because those family
members who could be found wouldn't say much.</TE>
<TE>   There are tantalizing rumors -- that the Hells Angels broke her
out of prison, paid for plastic surgery and burned her fingertips to
change her prints, for example -- but such stories have not been
confirmed, Tigh said.</TE>
<TE>   What does seem certain is that Hernandez, a mother of five,
lurched from one failed relationship to another and fought a drug
addiction that took hold of her early and lasted until her death at
what officials believe was the age of 53. She may have been free for
13 years, Tigh said, but they weren't very happy years.</TE>
<TE>   Prison documents portray Hernandez as an only child whose life
began with promise and unraveled with the help of a heroin needle.</TE>
<TE>   Born to parents who were traveling circus performers, she grew up
under the big top, with her father, Bernard Griggs, performing as a
clown and her mother, Leta, as an aerialist, or trapeze artist. After
dropping out of school at 17, Hernandez, too, joined the Ringling
Bros. circus trapeze troupe, specializing in the daring ladder act,
documents say.</TE>
<TE>   She married young and had her first three children quickly,
developing her addiction along the way. By the 1960s, heroin was her
narcotic of choice, and she bounced in and out of prison for a string
of burglaries, forgeries and other offenses to support her habit.</TE>
<TE>   The murder came one December night in 1970, at the San Bernardino
house that Hernandez shared with her second husband, Arthur
Hernandez, documents say. Smith, a brakeman for the Santa Fe
railroad, had gone Christmas shopping with a friend and stopped by
the Hernandez place for a party.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, two gunmen demanded money from them, and Smith, a
24-year-old father of two, was shot to death in a scuffle. Hernandez
denied any involvement, but investigators concluded that the robbery
had been a setup that she had masterminded. Convicted of
second-degree murder, she was sentenced to five years to life in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Lockups for women were different then. At Hernandez's new home,
the California Institution for Women, there was one fence, with no
razor wire, and inmates were allowed to wear street clothes.</TE>
<TE>   One warm May morning two months after her arrival, Hernandez and
another convicted murderer, Susan Sutcliffe, were assigned to water
plants outside the prison's administration building. They were
wearing shorts and multicolored blouses, and were last seen by guards
at 10:40 a.m., a prison report says.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-five minutes later, a local dairyman phoned, saying he had
seen two women hitchhiking near his place. An inmate count was taken.
Two were missing.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's deputies in a helicopter and three squad cars scoured
the area, while investigators searched the prison's perimeter for
clues. They found footprints, a cigarette case and some cosmetics
near the fence. Caught in the wire was a shred of fabric from
Hernandez's blouse.</TE>
<TE>   Despite reports that two women matching the inmates' description
had bought tickets at the local bus depot, officials never turned up
a trace of Hernandez. Sutcliffe was arrested four months later and
was in and out of prison for the next decade. She refused to answer
agents' questions about the escape or Hernandez's possible
whereabouts, Tigh said.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, the Department of Corrections assigned a team of
parole agents to tackle some of the system's coldest cases, an effort
dubbed Operation Manhunt. Among those given to Agent Tigh was one
marked with the case number W08905. Thus began her connection with
Hernandez.</TE>
<TE>   While some fugitives leave paper trails that a computer-savvy
agent can follow, the Hernandez case yielded little in the way of
clues. The escapee's three Social Security numbers led Tigh down some
fruitless alleys. Checks of the dozen or more aliases Hernandez had
been known to use also failed to pay off.</TE>
<TE>   "It was cold, very cold," she said. "She had been gone a long,
long time."</TE>
<TE>   Help finally came from the victim's daughter, Smith-Hosler, who
lives in Colorado and was haunted by the death of the father she had
never known. Frustrated and hoping for a break, she contacted the TV
crime show "America's Most Wanted." On Dec. 7, the program aired a
segment on Hernandez, asking the public to call with tips on the
fugitive.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, Richard Pena Jr. of Van Nuys is a fan of the show,
because he called in with some startling news: That's my grandmother
on your program, he said, and she died in Los Angeles 17 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with that information, Tigh called the coroner's office. The
files showed no record of Hernandez, but using her aliases, her
tattoos -- including one on her hip that read "Property of the Hells
Angels" -- and a distinctive scar on her right hand, a student worker
prowled the old records and made a possible match.</TE>
<TE>   The body in question belonged to Shelli Jane Aucoin, who was found
by her apartment manager amid a sea of prescription pill bottles and
several suicide notes to her children Aug. 26, 1985. A daughter
confirmed her identity as Aucoin, as did her driver's license. She
was later cremated.</TE>
<TE>   Tigh believed she had finally found Hernandez, and a fingerprint
expert confirmed it a few days later. That left the agent wondering:
Why hadn't the coroner's office compared the prints with those in the
state Department of Justice database 17 years ago, enabling officials
to close the case then?</TE>
<TE>   David Campbell, a coroner's spokesman, said the answer is simple:
There was no reason to believe Aucoin wasn't the person her
identification and relatives said she was.</TE>
<TE>   "The law does not require us to send fingerprints to the
Department of Justice unless we have a concern about the
identification," he said. "In this case, there was no dispute."</TE>
<TE>   Campbell added another twist to the Hernandez tale. At the time of
her death, he said, neighbors told sheriff's detectives they believed
Aucoin was an escapee, information that was passed on to the
Department of Corrections. A check by prison officials at that time,
however, made no match because the name was wrong, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The suicide notes Hernandez left behind, Tigh said, were mostly
the sad ramblings of a mother who was not well and felt unloved by
most of her children. Hernandez was tired of her struggle, and feared
she might someday land back behind bars, Tigh said.</TE>
<TE>   Reached at his home in Van Nuys, Hernandez's grandson declined to
comment. Efforts to reach Hernandez's children were unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   In San Bernardino, Smith's relatives recently marked the 32nd
anniversary of his murder. His mother, Grace Smith, said news that
Hernandez had died doesn't help much, and "sure doesn't bring my son
back."</TE>
<TE>   Smith's former wife, Jeanne Smith, remembered the difficulties of
raising two children alone, without the man she said she loved like
no other. She said she always resented Hernandez through the years,
"going fancy free while we were struggling," and wondered whether the
fugitive ever felt sorry for the killing.</TE>
<TE>   "When I heard about the suicide," Jeanne Smith said, "I thought,
'Did Steve's death bother her to the point that it drove her to
this?' I guess we'll never know."</TE>

<HD>Coalition Sues Over No-Fishing Zones</HD>
<DH>Commercial groups say the Channel Islands marine reserves
were created illegally, use flawed science and threaten livelihoods.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of fishing groups has sued the state Fish and Game
Commission, seeking to block creation of new marine reserves around
the Channel Islands.</LD>
<LD>   The groups say that commissioners illegally ignored their
objections to the no-fishing zones, used flawed science and violated
state environmental laws when they set boundaries for the reserves in
October. The zones are to go into effect early next year.</LD>
<LD>   Commercial fishermen say the restrictions would devastate their
livelihood while doing little to protect sensitive species of fish
around the islands off the coast of Ventura and Santa Barbara
counties.</LD>
<TE>   The 70-member Ventura County Commercial Fishermen's Assn., along
with other groups representing hundreds of thousands of commercial
and recreational fishermen in California, filed the lawsuit earlier
this month in Ventura County Superior Court. They are seeking an
order temporarily blocking the creation of the reserves, and then a
permanent injunction.</TE>
<TE>   No court hearings have been scheduled, and Fish and Game officials
are still reviewing the complaint and petition, staff counsel John
Mattox said.</TE>
<TE>   "Both the department and the commission are confident that they
fully complied with the law in establishing the marine protective
areas in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To replenish the populations of a wide array of fish and
shellfish, the commission banned fishing within a 175-square-mile
network around the five Channel Islands. It is one of the largest
marine reserves in U.S. waters.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County fisherman Chris Hoeflinger said the public comment
process on the state regulations was a sham and did not follow the
California Environmental Quality Act.</TE>
<TE>   The state's fishing regulators had already decided what they were
going to do, Hoeflinger said, "and we were just put through kind of a
kangaroo court of a process that didn't account for any of our input
and concerns along the way."</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen fear that the Channel Islands ban will lead quickly to
over-restrictive no-fishing zones and conservation areas up and down
California's 1,150-mile coastline. State law requires a draft map of
such a network by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Around the Channel Islands, the regulations were to have taken
effect Jan. 1, but because of delays in getting the legal wording
reviewed, it could be several months before the ban begins.</TE>
<TE>   Colder currents around the Channel Islands have made for a good
year for lobster and crab fishermen and a terrific year for sea bass
and halibut fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   To Tim Athens, who has been fishing commercially for 12 years, the
fish population seems healthier than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "If I can go out in less time, catch more fish than I have ever
caught and I'm getting more money than ever for them, it seems to me
things are pretty good," Athens said.</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen contend that by shrinking the area where they fish,
regulators will actually harm fish by forcing boats into a smaller
area.</TE>
<TE>   "We're forced to fish unsustainably; we're forced to over-fish,"
Hoeflinger said.</TE>
<TE>   A marine biologist for the Department of Fish and Game said there
is no evidence from protected areas elsewhere in the world that
suggests that will happen.</TE>
<TE>   "You actually have better catches" outside reserves, John Ugoretz
said.</TE>

<HD>Former Angels Batgirl Faces Death as a Hero</HD>
<DH>Diana Ayala, 15, who has a rare cancer, raises money at UCI
Medical Center to fight the disease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vivian LeTran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels winning the World Series was her first wish granted. Diana
Ayala's working on making a second come true: saving other children
from the incurable disease that is killing her.</LD>
<LD>   The 15-year-old held a bake sale Friday in a cafe at UCI Medical
Center in Orange, where she is undergoing treatment for a rare type
of bone cancer. She raised about $1,814 during the two-hour sale; she
will donate the money to cancer research.</LD>
<LD>   "I just want to find out about my cancer, so the doctors can help
more kids survive the cancer," said Diana, who has been told that she
has less than six months to live.</LD>
<TE>   A former Angels batgirl, Diana can rattle off all the players
names, including one of her favorites, first baseman Scott Spiezio.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be praying for you," Spiezio said when he reached her by
telephone Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm scared," Diana admitted to Spiezio with a quiet sob.</TE>
<TE>   Diana first complained of excruciating back pain shortly after her
12th birthday. She was diagnosed in 1999 with Ewing's sarcoma.</TE>
<TE>   The disease is difficult to detect until it is in advanced stages
because it develops in the bone or soft tissue. Cancer in children as
young as Diana is rare. Ewing's sarcoma is especially rare, with only
about 300 cases diagnosed each year, said Dr. Stanley Calderwood, a
pediatric oncologist at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a strong kid and mature for her age," he said. "She's not
afraid to die, but she wants to keep fighting for as long as she can.
It's remarkable what she's been able to do."</TE>
<TE>   Diana underwent surgery to remove the coin-size tumor detected in
her lower spine. After radiation and chemotherapy treatments, the
cancer went into remission.</TE>
<TE>   But it recurred last year and metastasized in her left arm. The
tumor has spread to her legs, confining her to a wheelchair, and, for
the last two months, to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "At this stage, we're just trying to preserve the quality of life
she wants, keep her mobile by controlling the pain and nausea and
other symptoms," Calderwood said.</TE>
<TE>   Diana has kept busy, watching the World Series and finishing the
latest "Harry Potter" book. Accepting the inevitable, she's also
planning her funeral "party."</TE>
<TE>   But in all her endeavors, she's intent on feeling alive. And the
one thing Diana loves more than the Angels is Betty Crocker brownies.</TE>
<TE>   "The nurses here always bring me baked goods to make me feel
better," said Diana, who wears a jeweled Santa's hat to cover her
hair loss caused by the cancer treatment. She considered the bake
sale a way to return the favor.</TE>
<TE>   Because of her weakened condition, Diana is faced with the
prospect of celebrating Christmas away from home.</TE>
<TE>   "This is such a shock to us, and it's so sad because she's my
younger sister," said Tania, 16, one of Diana's six brothers and
sisters. Diana's mother died of lung cancer when Diana was 8. She and
her siblings live with their father and stepmother in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   "But Diana is feisty," Tania said. "She'll get her way if she
wants to come home for Christmas."</TE>

<HD>8th Suspect Is Arrested in Shooting at Party in 2000</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tustin police have arrested a 22-year-old Aliso Viejo man in
connection with a shooting at a Halloween party two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Seven gang members had been arrested and convicted of the
shooting, but Chuong Van Nguyen had fled to Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Nguyen recently returned to California and was arrested at his
parents' home in Aliso Viejo on Thursday night without incident,
police said. Nguyen's bail has been set at $500,000. Police had
issued a felony warrant for Nguyen on charges of attempted murder and
conspiracy.</LD>
<TE>   Police say Nguyen was involved in an argument that started between
members of a notoriously violent Vietnamese/Cambodian gang known as
We Don't Care and some high-school-age partygoers in the Tustin
Meadows housing tract. Although gang members wielded clubs and fired
semiautomatic weapons into the crowd, no one was seriously hurt.</TE>

<HD>James Hazeldine, 55; Actor Won Praise for 'Iceman' Role</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Hazeldine, who captured New York theater critics' attention
three years ago as Harry Hope in "The Iceman Cometh" by Eugene
O'Neill, died Wednesday in London. He was 55. The cause of death was
not immediately known.</LD>
<LD>   Actor Kevin Spacey, who played Hickey in the production, said
Thursday that "James Hazeldine was one of the great actors of his
generation." He said that to see Hazeldine on stage as the proprietor
of the saloon where the play is set "was like watching a nightly
tribute to the acting profession."</LD>
<LD>   "I will forever recall with warmth in my heart this wonderful man
who led our company, as Harry led his bar, like a man who was in on
his own joke," Spacey said.</LD>
<TE>   In a stage career that was based in London starting in the 1970s,
Hazeldine appeared with the Royal Shakespeare Company as Troilus in
"Troilus and Cressida" and as Alcibiades in "Timon of Athens." This
month at London's Royal National Theatre, he was cast as Sigmund
Freud, opposite Ralph Fiennes as Carl Jung, in "The Talking Cure," a
new play by Christopher Hampton. Hazeldine became ill during
previews.</TE>
<TE>   "It is rare that great charismatic talent and selfless, warm
generosity are found in the same person, but this was so with Jimmy
Hazeldine," said Trevor Nunn, director of the Royal National Theatre
in an interview with Associated Press this week.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Hazeldine was a regular on "London's Burning," a
British TV series about firefighters that aired from 1988 to 1994. He
made guest appearances on several episodes of the "Mystery" series,
including "Inspector Morse" and "Sherlock Holmes," that aired on PBS.</TE>
<TE>   He had roles in several Hollywood films, including "Nicholas and
Alexandra" in 1971 and "The Ruling Class" in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Rebecca, and two children.</TE>

<HD>Bill Hunter, 82; Founder of World Hockey Assn.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Hunter, a legendary name in Canadian hockey who co-founded the
Edmonton Oilers and the upstart World Hockey Assn., has died. He was
82.</LD>
<LD>   Hunter, who was known to hockey fans as "Wild Bill" and was fondly
dubbed the king of hyperbole by sportswriters, died Monday in a
hospital in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, after a three-year battle with
bone cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Hunter was part of a group of investors who launched the World
Hockey Assn. in 1972 to compete against the National Hockey League
and bring professional hockey to new markets.</LD>
<TE>   Hunter, who secured a franchise for Edmonton and convinced
officials to build the Northlands Coliseum for the Oilers, became
president of the new league.</TE>
<TE>   In a move that gave the new league instant credibility, the WHA's
Winnipeg Jets in 1972 signed the Chicago Black Hawks' scoring star
Bobby Hull to a $1-million contract, the first seven-figure deal in
professional hockey.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter's ownership group sold the Oilers in 1976, three years
before the Oilers and three other WHA teams joined the NHL after the
failed WHA broke up -- and well before the Oilers became a Stanley
Cup dynasty with players such as Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier.</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky this week called Hunter "the father of hockey in
Edmonton."</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line: Had it not been for his vision and his dream of
building a new arena in Edmonton and bringing the WHA to Edmonton,
I'm not sure if the NHL would have come to Alberta," Gretzky told the
Toronto Globe and Mail.</TE>
<TE>   In the early '80s, Hunter tried to bring the NHL to Saskatoon, his
hometown, in what he envisioned as his legacy. He bought the St.
Louis Blues for $12 million and convinced city officials to build a
$44-million, 18,000-seat arena.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1983 the NHL's board of governors, unconvinced that the
city of 160,000 could support a big-league franchise, voted to block
the Blues' transfer north.</TE>
<TE>   "I still have Saskatchewan people say to me, 'Thank you for almost
getting us in the NHL,' " Hunter said in a recent interview. "We were
so close we could taste it."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Saskatoon, in central Saskatchewan, Hunter was still in
high school when he organized and funded his first team: a junior
football team that eventually became the Saskatoon Hilltops.</TE>
<TE>   At Notre Dame College in Wilcox, Saskatchewan, Hunter managed the
college's sports teams.</TE>
<TE>   After flying with the Royal Air Force's International Squadron
during World War II, Hunter ran a wholesale grocery business and
established a sporting goods store in Saskatchewan.</TE>
<TE>   But beginning in 1946, he began a quarter-century of owning,
managing and coaching minor league hockey teams in half a dozen
Canadian cities, including Saskatoon and Edmonton.</TE>
<TE>   In 1966, he joined a group of hockey team owners to form the
Western Junior Hockey League. Now known as the Western Hockey League,
it became one of the largest junior leagues in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter earned his "Wild Bill" nickname from a referee during a
vociferous argument Hunter had with the referee as the coach of a
minor league team in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter reportedly never cared for the nickname, but he defended it
in his autobiography, "Wild Bill: Bill Hunter's Legendary 65 Years in
Canadian Sport," published in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "If to be passionate and emotional looks wild to some people, so
be it," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "If that's what Wild Bill means, it's a compliment and I hope the
name always remains appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   His reputation as the king of hyperbole was also well-earned.</TE>
<TE>   When the formation of the WHA was announced at a news conference
in New York in 1971, Hunter greeted the media with, "Ladies and
gentlemen, this is the greatest day in the history of the world."</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his fourth wife, Vi; seven children; and six
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Giovanni Intra, 34; Chinatown Artist</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Giovanni Intra, an artist, writer and pioneering entrepreneur in Los
Angeles' burgeoning Chinatown gallery scene, died Monday in New York.
He was 34.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of death has not been determined, according to his
business partner, Steve Hanson.</LD>
<LD>   Born and raised in New Zealand, Intra made a name for himself as a
conceptual painter while he was a teenager and soon developed skills
in writing about art. He moved to Los Angeles in 1996, after winning
a Fulbright fellowship to study at the Art Center College of Design
in Pasadena.</LD>
<TE>   The college awarded him a degree in critical studies in 2001, but
he had already taken on the challenge of running an avant-garde
gallery.</TE>
<TE>   He and Hanson, whom he met at Art Center, opened the gallery in
January 1999, in a storefront formerly occupied by a shop called
China Art Objects. They kept the name and set an example that helped
transform Chung King Road into an edgy showcase for contemporary art.</TE>
<TE>   Intra "had a lot of energy and enthusiasm for young artists,"
Times art critic Christopher Knight said. "The gallery was a catalyst
for Chinatown and for introducing a lot of younger artists to the
public."</TE>
<TE>   China Art Objects is still a shoestring operation, but it has
gained a national reputation. Earlier this month, the gallery was
represented at Art Basel Miami Beach, a prestigious art fair. At the
time of his death, Intra was in New York for an exhibition of the
work of Eric Wesley, one of the gallery's artists.</TE>

<HD>Witness Denies Role in Luster Sex Film</HD>
<DH>Victim of alleged rape says she worked for the suspect but
didn't participate in a movie.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A woman allegedly drugged and raped by suspect Andrew Luster
testified Friday that she did clerical work for his fledgling film
production company, but never participated in a pornographic movie
shoot.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorneys say two homemade films that depict Luster
engaging in sex acts with women who appear to be unconscious are
actually adult movies in which the purported victims pretended to be
asleep.</LD>
<LD>   One of those women, a 29-year-old paralegal who dated Luster for
several months, admitted Friday under defense questioning to helping
the 39-year-old Mussel Shoals surfer and Max Factor cosmetics heir
with his company.</LD>
<TE>   "It didn't seem like much of a business," she said. "I don't
remember that he actually sold anything."</TE>
<TE>   The woman, identified as Tonja Doe, testified that she did see a
movie produced by Luster titled "Waves and Babes," but described it
as a girls-in-bikinis surf movie, not a hard-core skin flick.</TE>
<TE>   But she denied participating in a sex film shoot -- testimony that
ignited a contentious hour-long hearing in Ventura County Superior
Court and a demand for a mistrial.</TE>
<TE>   Before the noon recess, defense attorney Roger Jon Diamond asked
Tonja whether she had ever seen a video camera in Luster's house. She
said she had.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you and Andrew ever have sex in front of that video camera?"
Diamond asked, drawing an immediate objection from Deputy Dist. Atty.
Maeve Fox.</TE>
<TE>   The judge overruled the objection and Tonja said, "No." Diamond
raised his eyebrows in surprise, and after the recess accused Tonja
of perjury.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the presence of the jury and the witness, Diamond insisted
that he be allowed to confront her with videotapes, previously ruled
inadmissible, that allegedly show her knowingly having sex before the
camera.</TE>
<TE>   He told Judge Ken Riley that the tapes will show, in part, that
Tonja took her shirt off at Luster's direction.</TE>
<TE>   Fox accused the defense of trying to put improper information
before the jury in violation of a prior court order, and urged Riley
to prevent the defense from humiliating the witness.</TE>
<TE>   "This victim has been raped, and I am not going to let her be
raped again as Mr. Diamond turns this into a circus," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Diamond said the defense tapes are needed to rebut charges
that Luster raped Tonja while she was unconscious.</TE>
<TE>   "They were making pornographic movies. That is the defense,
including the video that was shown yesterday," Diamond said,
suggesting that Tonja was play-acting in a tape that showed Luster
manipulating her body like a doll to have sex. Prosecutors played the
video for the jury on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Riley stood by his earlier ruling that the tapes offered by the
defense are irrelevant and will not be shown to the jury.</TE>
<TE>   "Taking off a top," he said, "is a far cry from what we saw
yesterday."</TE>
<TE>   Diamond demanded a mistrial and accused the judge of violating his
client's rights by hampering cross-examination of a witness. Riley
denied the request.</TE>

<HD>Florence Mahoney, 103; Health-Care Activist Pushed
Institute on Aging</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Rourke</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Florence Mahoney, a health-care advocate who was instrumental in
creating the National Institute on Aging and expanding the National
Institutes of Health that contains it, died at home in the Georgetown
section of Washington on Nov. 29. She was 103 and died of natural
causes.</LD>
<LD>   A presence in Washington political circles from the time of
President Harry S. Truman, Mahoney lobbied for government-sponsored
health care, health insurance and medical research, often using small
dinner parties in her home as her platform. She built a network of
contacts that included politicians, doctors and research scientists,
calling on them to help push her causes through Congress.</LD>
<LD>   She and her colleague, the heiress and humanitarian Mary Lasker,
were early advocates of research on mental illness, heart disease and
Alzheimer's disease. They were among the first to foresee the health
concerns that would accompany the country's increasing older
population and began to press for the Institute on Aging in the early
1960s.</LD>
<TE>   The office was finally approved by President Nixon in 1974 after
he twice vetoed the proposal. Opponents, including the American
Medical Assn, had called it an example of socialized medicine.</TE>
<TE>   "Florence was nothing if not persistent," said Mary Margaret
Valenti, secretary to Lyndon B. Johnson when he was a U.S. senator.
"Florence was a lobbyist in the best sense. She would not give up
until finally Sen. Johnson would say, 'OK, OK, OK!' "</TE>
<TE>   Last year in Washington at her 102nd birthday party and the
launching of the book "Noble Conspirator: Florence S. Mahoney and the
Rise of the National Institutes of Health," by Judith Robinson,
Mahoney's guests included former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, who
credited her with getting him started in politics in 1969. He told
how the two of them were shopping one day in Mexico and later stopped
at "a cowboy bar" in Tubac, on the Arizona side of the border.</TE>
<TE>   Babbitt said Mahoney told him, "Bruce, now is the time to start on
your political career." Surveying the tough-looking characters in the
bar, she added, "This is a great place to start campaigning. I'm
going to introduce you to this audience."</TE>
<TE>   "I learned a lesson," Babbitt said. "Take a position and act upon
it. That's Florence."</TE>
<TE>   Babbitt said Mahoney also influenced his positions on health care.
"She said any health-care program needs to be universally available
and needs cost containment without eliminating anyone from qualifying
for it." What came of their discussions was a managed-care health
insurance program for the state, said Babbitt, who was governor from
1978 to 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up as one of three daughters on a farm near Muncie, Ind.,
Florence Sheets wanted to be a physician. After graduating from high
school in 1917 she studied anatomy and kinesiology at the Normal
School of Physical Education in Battle Creek, Mich. She later taught
physical education and took courses in medicine.</TE>
<TE>   In 1926 she married Daniel J. Mahoney, a newspaper executive who
became publisher of the Miami Daily News. They lived in Miami,
Washington and New York City, and she wrote a column for the
newspaper, which gave her access to political leaders and helped
focus her concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Mahoney's passionate interest in health issues grew step by step.
In the 1930s she volunteered at Miami hospitals. She focused on
mental health when a friend asked her to help raise money for a
clinic. She used her newspaper connections to get articles published
on an unfit mental institution in Florida and, afterward, using her
husband's political connections, gained access to state legislators
to push appropriating more state money for mental health care.
Several million dollars were added that year.</TE>
<TE>   Her path was set. She had combined her devotion to health-care
issues with her access to politicians and seen her plan for reform
put into effect.</TE>
<TE>   Mahoney and her husband, who had two children, divorced in 1950;
soon after, Mahoney made Georgetown her home.</TE>
<TE>   Clad in a sheath dress and sporting a double strand of pearls and
a bouffant hairstyle -- the uniform of a Washington socialite in the
1960s -- Mahoney charmed senators and House members by taking them
homemade lunches, and then stayed to ask their advice on how to get
her projects funded.</TE>
<TE>   One of her more controversial causes was a national birth control
program. Among guests she invited to her home for tea and
conversation about the topic were several papal nuncios,
representatives of the Vatican in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "She'd entertain one papal nuncio, trying to talk the Catholic
Church into changing its anti-birth control position," said Stephen
Strickland, a longtime friend of Mahoney and chairman of the National
Peace Foundation. When she received no encouragement from one, she
would wait for the next to be appointed and try again, Strickland
said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years she proposed that anyone who wanted to have a baby
be required to be licensed.</TE>
<TE>   Although she was conscious of fitness and health, she was not
obsessive, Strickland said. She loved caviar. To keep fit, she swam
in a neighbor's pool and sometimes did ballet stretches while talking
with friends. "It was all quite natural," Strickland said.</TE>
<TE>   Mahoney is survived by one son, J. Michael Mahoney, and
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Stretching the Oscar Envelope</HD>
<DH>Academy Award campaigns must adhere to detailed rules, but
the letter and spirit of these laws get put through the Hollywood
wringer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert W. Welkos and Lorenza Munoz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's Saturday evening in Brentwood. Inside the home of producer Mark
Johnson, a casually dressed, bearded Mexican director named Alfonso
Cuaron is caught in a crush of Hollywood partygoers who have come to
shake his hand, share a drink, sample some shrimp in pesto and gush
over his film, "Y Tu Mama Tambien."</LD>
<LD>   Oscar-winning producer Brian Grazer leans against a wall, deep in
conversation with Variety editor in chief Peter Bart. Another Oscar
winner, director Steven Soderbergh, wearing his distinctive
black-framed, rectangular eyeglasses, schmoozes with reporters while
simultaneously fending off on-the-record contact, saying, "No press!
No press!" Even Frank Pierson, president of the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences, is here -- as a co-host, no less.</LD>
<LD>   All in all, an amiable and festive gathering of Hollywood elites,
and clearly helpful to Cuaron's own Oscar hopes. And, had it been
thrown by a studio instead of an individual, strictly forbidden.</LD>
<TE>   Although the Academy Awards are more than three months away,
Hollywood's great race has begun, and its campaign route winds
through a sprawling but highly entertaining gray area in which it's
sometimes hard to tell the socializing, which is part and parcel of
Hollywood, from the politicking, which the academy frowns upon.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, the town is awash in would-be Oscar candidates out
pressing the flesh at parties, private screenings and a blizzard of
year-end gatherings where academy voters might just happen to
congregate. The proximity of other awards shows is a factor too;
Thursday's announcement of the nominees for the Golden Globes --
given by the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn., and often seen as playing
New Hampshire primary to Oscar's election night -- got things going
in earnest.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to ward off the more brazen attempts to woo votes,
the academy each year goes to great lengths to police the Oscar
campaigns. To the outside world, the rules may seem obsessive,
arcane, even something to wink at. But to the academy -- and the
studios and independent distributors with Oscar-worthy films to
promote -- the provisions carry the high seriousness of the
California penal code, or the DMV rule book, at the very least. To
wit:</TE>
<TE>   On screenings: "The Academy encourages the screening of eligible
films in a theatrical setting for its members. However, such
screenings should not be accompanied by receptions, buffets or other
refreshments, nor should such screenings feature the live
participation of the film's artists before or after the screening."</TE>
<TE>   On screening schedules: "Screening schedules or notices or
upcoming screenings may be mailed to members, but only in letter
format (8 1/2" x 11" paper, no photographs, no glossy or card stock)
or postcards (maximum size 4"x6," logo and title only, no
photographs, no key or other art, no glossy stock.)"</TE>
<TE>   On events: "Receptions, dinners or other events to which Academy
members are invited and which are specifically designed to promote a
film or achievement for Academy Awards consideration are expressly
forbidden."</TE>
<TE>   Yet just as politicians have figured out ways to skirt federal
campaign finance laws, savvy studios and publicists know just how far
they can push the envelope regarding Oscar regulations.</TE>
<TE>   'The American Way'</TE>
<TE>   The rules prohibit studios from inviting academy members to
question-and-answer sessions with the stars? No problem. Send out
invites to the Hollywood guilds representing directors, actors,
writers and producers, many of whose members -- surprise, surprise --
are also among the 6,000 or so card-carrying members of the academy.</TE>
<TE>   "Campaigners take the rules seriously but that doesn't mean they
don't try to get around them -- and that is OK; it's the American
way," said Tony Angellotti, an Oscar campaign consultant who advises
the studios on strategies to win nominations and awards. "It's not
like anyone is saying, 'What rascals.' They are saying, 'I wish I had
thought of that.' "</TE>
<TE>   This season's tactic of choice seems to be the celebrity Q&amp;A. The
post-screening discussion session is a time-honored Hollywood
practice. But the sessions have proliferated this year, morphing into
a series of glitzy events where the stars take questions from an
audience and then mingle among the crowds at catered receptions.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the Screen Actors Guild is hosting a series of
"conversations" this month with people like George Clooney, making
his directorial debut in "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," and Nia
Vardalos of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding." The Directors Guild of
America's Sunset Boulevard theater is the site of 11 Q&amp;A's this
month. The studios are behind most of these, trotting out the
Oscar-hopeful stars and directors of films including "The Hours"
(Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, Nicole Kidman, director Stephen
Daldry); "The Emperor's Club" (director Michael Hoffman); and "One
Hour Photo" (Robin Williams).</TE>
<TE>   And over at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, which
dispenses Britain's equivalent of the Academy Awards, stars like
Moore of "Far From Heaven" and "The Hours," Ray Liotta of "Narc" and
Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere and director Rob
Marshall of the brassy new Miramax musical "Chicago" are among those
who have stopped by to chat after screenings.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't been asked to kiss any babies yet," said Marshall,
whose "Chicago" ended up dominating Thursday's Golden Globe
nominations, garnering eight. "You never know with Miramax. They may
ask me that."</TE>
<TE>   Marshall, a Tony Award-winning choreographer-director, is from the
theater world, so events like these offer valuable face time with
movie people.</TE>
<TE>   "What would make me uncomfortable is if I had to feel like I was
really campaigning for myself," he said. "That's an odd feeling
because I don't want to put the focus on awards."</TE>
<TE>   Political Parties</TE>
<TE>   Many point to Miramax's 1998 romantic comedy "Shakespeare in Love"
as the film that changed the dynamics of the Oscar race, causing it
to resemble presidential politics as never before. For the most part,
previous Oscar campaigns had been less in-your-face, relying more on
behind-the-scenes lobbying than saturation marketing and the brash
style most famously personified by Miramax co-founder Harvey
Weinstein.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did Miramax spend a fortune placing ads touting the film
and performances in Hollywood's two trade papers, Variety and the
Hollywood Reporter, but actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who went on to win
the best actress Oscar for her performance in the film, was seemingly
everywhere in the run-up to the Oscar show. If there was a magazine
cover, she graced it. If there was a premiere, she was there, posing
for the paparazzi. And "Entertainment Tonight" seemed to chronicle
every event she attended.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, actress Cate Blanchett, who delivered a powerful
performance in "Elizabeth" that year, remained in England much of the
time and that may have hurt her Oscar chances.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Australian director Baz Luhrmann went on a worldwide
barnstorming tour on behalf of his movie musical "Moulin Rouge" and
many credit his publicity blitzkrieg with landing the 20th Century
Fox film eight Academy Award nominations, including one for best
picture. (Although Luhrmann was not nominated for best director, and
his movie did not take best picture honors, it did win two Academy
Awards -- for costume design and art direction-set direction.)</TE>
<TE>   During awards season -- which resembles a free-for-all now but
will take on a focused intensity after Oscar nominees are announced
Feb. 11 -- actors and directors hit the campaign trail not only in
Los Angeles and New York, but also in London, San Francisco, Santa
Fe, N.M., anywhere where there are pockets of academy voters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about exposure, it's about access," said producer Steve
Tisch ("Snatch"). "People in Hollywood love to say their new best
friend is so-and-so."</TE>
<TE>   "I've been at parties where either the studio involved or the
producers involved or the talent agencies involved create an
opportunity for their clients to meet academy members," added Tisch,
a member of the academy's producers branch.</TE>
<TE>   Private parties like the one held earlier this month for Alfonso
Cuaron do not violate any Oscar rules, but they do show the blurry
line between campaigning and socializing.</TE>
<TE>   The party was deemed legal under academy rules because academy
members were not specifically invited and IFC Films, the distributor
for U.S. and Canada, did not underwrite the bash. However, IFC
Entertainment President Jonathon Sehring flew out from New York to
attend the party.</TE>
<TE>   Academy president Pierson, who won an Oscar for best screenplay
for "Dog Day Afternoon" (1975), spoke approvingly as he stood across
the crowded room from Cuaron: "I admire this picture and I wanted to
meet the filmmaker."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a social occasion. There is nothing wrong with that....
Should we call off all dinner parties and luncheons and de facto
parties among friends as the Christmas season approaches because we
are all involved in the business? We have to have latitude to sit
down and eat and break bread together and be a community of
filmmakers. That is what this is all about."</TE>
<TE>   Yet in one of those strange juxtapositions that can give this time
of year a certain "Alice in Wonderland" quality in Hollywood, only
the night before Pierson had pulled out of co-hosting a screening
followed by a Q&amp;A for Cuaron at the Los Angeles Film Academy. He did
so after an advertisement for the event appeared in Variety
mentioning that an academy membership card and ID were required for
admittance; both the ad and requirement were violations of academy
rules.</TE>
<TE>   Fredell Pogodin, the publicist handling the film, received a
letter from the academy alerting her that her ad had stepped over the
line. The academy took no immediate action and Pogodin had no
comment.</TE>
<TE>   (If it wants to get serious with violators, the academy carries a
big stick: denial of the highly sought-after tickets to the Oscars
ceremony, coming up on March 23, 2003. But yes, the film could still
compete.)</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Johnson ("The Rookie"), the chairman of the academy's
foreign-language film selection committee, said he saw no problem
with holding a party for Cuaron in his house. "The reason we threw
the party was because Alfonso is a good friend and we wanted to do
it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Y Tu Mama Tambien," which opened in Mexico last year, was not
submitted at that time by the country for Oscar consideration in the
foreign language category. However, since its release in the U.S. in
March, it is eligible for best picture, director and all other major
categories.</TE>
<TE>   And the room clearly was filled with heavy hitters from the film
community and opinion-makers from the entertainment media who could
help get the Oscar buzz going for Cuaron.</TE>
<TE>   When 20th Century Fox Co-Chairman Tom Rothman spotted Cuaron, he
made his way through the crowd to give the director a bearhug. He
told Cuaron, an old friend, that he always wins the office pool so he
was sure the director would be nominated this year.</TE>
<TE>   The 41-year-old director, who only a few years ago was making
commercials in his native Mexico, flew in for the party from London,
where he was preparing to direct "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of
Azkaban," the third installment in the blockbuster series.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he felt like a politician pressing the flesh, Cuaron
beamed. "Definitely," he said. He then jokingly broke into song -- a
rendition of the presidential salute, "Hail to the Chief," as he
posed for a flashing camera.</TE>

<HD>Caught Up in the Ultimate Comeback Sport</HD>
<DH>The boomerang, called 'the thinking man's Frisbee,' can be
a passion for throwers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like original sin or bad chili, Budd Jamieson's favorite pastime
keeps coming back on him.</LD>
<LD>   And it's a good thing.</LD>
<LD>   If the homemade fiberglass-composite boomerang he calls the Pigeon
were to keep traveling, it could take off someone's head.</LD>
<TE>   Jamieson, a computer expert in the materials engineering
department at UC Santa Barbara, is a past U.S. champion of distance
boomerang throwing.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, he threw the Pigeon 155 meters -- the equivalent of a
football field plus 70 yards. More incredible, The Pigeon flew all
the way back, whirring past Jamieson at a speed that would slash the
palms of anyone foolhardy enough to try to catch it.</TE>
<TE>   A well-thrown boomerang can travel faster than 60 mph. If you're
like Jamieson, you hold it almost vertically, more like a tomahawk
than a Frisbee.</TE>
<TE>   You rip up a few blades of grass and let them fall to gauge the
wind. You take a few short, strong steps and let loose. But putting
the secret of a successful launch into words is like trying to put
mojo in a bottle.</TE>
<TE>   Practicing on a massive athletic field at the university, Jamieson
spoke with the enthusiasm of a boy scientist about spin, airfoils and
thermal currents. But explaining how to actually throw the thing, he
was more roundabout.</TE>
<TE>   "It's in the wrist, it's how you snap your arm, it's how much you
want to put yourself in pain," Jameson ventured. "It's -- I don't
know."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever it is, it can be addictive when you finally get it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just magical," Alan Scott Craig said as he crafted high-end
art boomerangs in the workshop at his Fillmore home. "It's like a
moving meditation or a ballet. You have to work with nature, with the
wind, with the environment, with obstacles. You can't think about
anything else."</TE>
<TE>   For 15 years, Craig has made a living turning laminated birch into
boomerangs shaped like parrots and toucans, eagles and gaudy tropical
fish. From ingeniously arranged, oddly shaped boomerangs he fashions
stylized scenes: a golf course here, a motorcycle racer there.</TE>
<TE>   Several of his works are in a Smithsonian collection and others
hang on the walls of Hollywood celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   "People buy them as showpieces," said Craig, who test-flies each
piece before selling it. "It's the only art you can buy with a
guaranteed return."</TE>
<TE>   Just across town -- who would have guessed tiny Fillmore would
have two boomerang makers? -- Steve Conaway makes what insiders call
" 'rangs" for his Aboriginal Steve's Internet business. Over 11
years, he figures he's made more than 6,000, selling them to NASA as
convention giveaways, to the "Survivor" TV show as props for
contestants, and to throwers across the United States as sporting
gear.</TE>
<TE>   "We're out there," said Conaway, a power system operating
specialist for Southern California Edison. "We're a small group of
whacks, but we're out there."</TE>
<TE>   Boomerangs took off in this country with the help of Ben Ruhe, a
former curator of aboriginal art at the Smithsonian. In the 1970s,
Ruhe organized an annual fling in the shadow of the Washington
Monument, introducing thousands to the ancient club of the outback.</TE>
<TE>   When he was a boy in Ohio, Gregg Snouffer talked his parents into
a trip to the event in 1978. Like a you-know-what, he came back the
next year, and the next. Today, he's president of the 300-member U.S.
Boomerang Assn., a veteran of a boomerang tour for a British cereal
called Uncle Toby's Oats, and a frequent participant in international
competition.</TE>
<TE>   "There's got to be thousands of people who are into it," said
Snouffer, a high school teacher and coach. "We keep running into
closet boomerangers everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., there are about 20 tournaments yearly. The sport's
World Cup -- the current champions are a team from Germany -- is
staged every two years. The field is mostly men: largely engineers,
pilots, kite-fliers and others intrigued by the physics of what has
been called "the thinking man's Frisbee."</TE>
<TE>   "People into aerodynamics are working with all kinds of new
materials," Snouffer said. "It would really blow away guys from 20
years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Competitors throw for more than distance. There are trick-catch
specialists who can trap a speeding 'rang between their feet. Some
throwers craft their boomerangs for maximum-time-aloft contests, with
one achieving an astounding unofficial time of more than 17 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   In the fast-throw event, the reigning champion is a Brooklyn,
N.Y., teenager who threw and caught five consecutive 20-meter shots
in 13.9 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are throwers such as Gary Broadbent, an inspirational
speaker from Canton, Ohio, with a collection of about 15,000
boomerangs. A man who talks as fast as he throws, Broadbent has won
his share of records, but he especially savors sailing his favorite
'rangs around world landmarks.</TE>
<TE>   "I've boomed the St. Louis arch, the Eiffel Tower, the Washington
Monument, Yosemite, the Grand Canyon and the Golden Gate Bridge,"
Broadbent said from his boomerang shop in Canton. "I've boomed the
cathedral in Cuneo, Italy. Everyone ran to the square and they were
amazed!"</TE>
<TE>   Once a salesman for Campbell's soup, Broadbent said he quit his
job for boomerangs, becoming a kind of evangelist for "the most
complex flying machines on Earth."</TE>
<TE>   "They're everything to me," he said. "The greatest gift in my life
came from the aborigines."</TE>
<TE>   For Jamieson in Santa Barbara, throwing is more a passion than an
obsession. Like any devoted thrower, he makes his own, molding the
material used in computer circuit boards into something that looks a
lot like a question mark.</TE>
<TE>   His distance title was snagged by his friend Erik Fields, an
oceanographer at the university. Fields, who throws less these days
because of a skydiving injury, bested him by just three meters.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Erik: I've got to get it back," Jamieson said as his
practice session drew to a close.</TE>
<TE>   And what sport would be better suited than boomeranging for the
efforts of a comeback kid?</TE>

<HD>More Bad News for Planning Agency</HD>

<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A court decision Friday could spell more bad news for Orange County's
beleaguered Planning Department.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge C. Robert Jameson ruled that the county must
follow federal guidelines on the type of expenses that can be paid
with user fees. A lawsuit claims that the Planning Department spent
revenue collected from building permits on overhead and
administration instead of costs associated with the permitting
process.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed by a national homebuilder, says the county
violated federal guidelines.</LD>
<TE>   A special master selected by the judge to examine Orange County's
planning finances has said in court papers that the Planning
Department may have misspent as much as $10 million.</TE>
<TE>   The master, Robert P. Mosier, said the county may have to place
that amount into a reserve fund until a ruling is made on whether the
money was spent properly.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey V. Dunne, a private attorney representing the county, said
the county has complied with the federal and state guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the Board of Supervisors approved an $8-million
emergency loan to the department. Planning officials hoped to
persuade supervisors to raise permit fees as a way of repaying that
loan and replenishing their reserves. Supervisors had the issue
before them twice this month, only to have it postponed. Supervisors
are again scheduled to discuss it Jan. 14.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Chief Executive Officer Michael Schumacher said
Auditor-Controller David Sundstrom is reviewing the "reasonableness"
of the fee increase and will meet with a consultant about
establishing new proposed fees.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor-elect Chris Norby, who will replace outgoing board
Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad on Jan. 6, said the fee issue and the
finances of the planning department are a priority.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to look at this thing from the bottom up," he said.</TE>

<CX>   Planning department -- Two stories in the California section about
the Orange County Planning Department's financial problems contained
inaccuracies. An article Saturday incorrectly reported that the
department may have to place $10 million in planning fees into a
special fund until a judge rules whether the money was properly
spent. In fact, the money will be put into the fund permanently if a
judge rules that it was spent improperly. A story Sunday reported
incorrectly that a judge has ruled that the department misspent $12
million from a fund containing building permit fees. The judge has
not yet ruled on the issue.</CX>

<HD>A Historic Holiday Moment for L.A.</HD>
<DH>Throngs are expected for the cathedral's first midnight
Mass. A second service may be held in the plaza.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry B. Stammer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Gregorian chant, bells and incense, Christmas will be celebrated
at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels for the first time next
week, a historic occasion that is expected to draw large crowds to
the new mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Dedicated in September, the $189-million downtown cathedral can
seat 3,000 people in its soaring, modernistic nave. But there may not
be enough room to accommodate the crowds expected for the traditional
midnight Mass, according to Msgr. Kevin Kostelnik, cathedral pastor.</LD>
<LD>   "People want to be a part of history," he said. "It's very
historical to celebrate the cathedral's first Christmas."</LD>
<TE>   He said the church is prepared to offer a second -- and
simultaneous -- midnight Mass beneath the stars in the cathedral
plaza, unless it rains.</TE>
<TE>   An introit from the old solemn Mass, "Dominus Dixit -- The Lord
said" will be sung. "It's the most beautiful chant of all," Director
of Music Frank Brownstead said. "It's God talking to Jesus, and God
says you are my begotten son."</TE>
<TE>   The chant is a musical expression of classical Christian theology,
the belief that the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob again intervened
in human history through the person of Jesus, whom Christians call
the Son of God.</TE>
<TE>   Kostelnik and Cardinal Roger M. Mahony said the belief that God is
present is especially reassuring in view of the sexual abuse crisis
that has shaken the Catholic Church this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a terrible year because of the scandal, but it's also
been a year in which the church has been called to grow and heal and
express concern and to assist all those who have been" victimized by
priests, Kostelnik said. "One of the reasons so many people have come
here is, this is a real point of light in the midst of what has been
a lot of darkness this year."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, archbishop of Los Angeles, said he has no intention of
ignoring the scandal as the nation's largest Roman Catholic
archdiocese celebrates Jesus' birth.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a very difficult year for us in the church, in the
world, our country and in our community. We've had the scandal on
clergy abuse. We've had ongoing ... tensions and terrible problems in
the Middle East with Israel and Palestine, and the prospects of war
with Iraq," Mahony said in an interview. Many are worried about their
jobs or how they can pay the doctor or dentist, he added.</TE>
<TE>   This year more than 350 priests nationwide have either resigned or
retired as a result of sexual abuse accusations. Just this month,
Cardinal Bernard Law resigned as archbishop of Boston. The scandal
erupted in Boston last January and soon spread across the country,
with priests in the Los Angeles Archdiocese and the dioceses of
Orange, San Diego and San Bernardino accused of molesting children.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy is expected to continue into the new year. Mahony
said he expects the Los Angeles Archdiocese to be at least named in
several hundred civil lawsuits expected to be filed in 2003. The
legal actions would come under a new state law that temporarily
waives the statute of limitations so victims of older cases can sue
the church or other institutions responsible for placing clergy or
other personnel in positions where they could sexually abuse
children.</TE>
<TE>   Alluding to the loss of trust in the church, Mahony wrote in his
annual Christmas message: "It is a moment for each one of us to take
stock of what is deepest in our belief in Christ, the Sun of Justice,
even as we experience the loss of so much in which we have placed our
confidence."</TE>
<TE>   The scandal and its continuation into the new year are not happy
prospects to consider at Christmas, Mahony said. But during this
season, he said, he takes heart in the words of the angels to the
shepherds, "Do not be afraid; for see -- I am bringing you good news
of great joy."</TE>
<TE>   "We just seem to have a longer list of woes than usual, and yet in
the midst of all of that which seems so despairing and hopeless here
come these words -- 'Do not be afraid; I bring you good news of great
joy, that a Savior, a Messiah, has come to bring hope,' " Mahony
said.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean the sexual abuse crisis will suddenly disappear
Dec. 25, he added. But he said the angel's words, recounted in Luke
2:10, "give us a new inner strength, a new energy, to find solutions
with God's presence, with God in our midst. So we are not alone, we
are not abandoned, and we don't have to rely on our own human
weakness and limited strength."</TE>
<TE>   Seats for all Masses are free and available on a first come, first
served basis. The midnight Mass on Christmas Eve will be preceded by
carols at 11:30 p.m. and a choral performance of "O Magnum Mysterium
-- O Great Mystery," a composition by Morten Lauridsen of USC.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Masses are scheduled Christmas Eve at 4 and 9 p.m. in
English and 6 p.m. in Spanish. On Christmas, Mass will be said at 8
and 10 a.m. in English and noon in Spanish. Mahony will be present at
all Christmas Eve services, and will preside at midnight Mass.</TE>

<HD>Mormons Give $25,000 to L.A. Catholic Charities Program</HD>

<LD>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has donated $25,000
to a Roman Catholic charities program operated by the Cathedral of
Our Lady of the Angels.</LD>
<LD>   The check from the LDS Foundation was presented this week to
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony by Mormon Elder Tad Callister.</LD>
<LD>   The money will be used by Cathedral Charities -- run by Sister
Patricia Geoghegan -- to fund intramural basketball and baseball
teams for 420 youths who live in nearby low-income housing.</LD>
<TE>   Steve Gilliland, a Mormon spokesman, said the church had long
planned to contribute something "in honor of the wonderful and
beautiful cathedral and all the good Catholic charities do throughout
the world."</TE>
<TE>   "As churches in the community, we need to pull together and
support each other, especially at a time when religious
establishments are under attack," Gilliland said, referring to the
last year's continuing sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to focus also on the good they do. The Catholic Church is
under the gun right now, but a lot of times people are forgetting the
wonderful services they are providing for the community."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Like Poor Nations Spiritually, Poll Finds</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Religion is much more important to Americans than to people in other
wealthy countries, according to an international poll released
Thursday that found that the United States is more spiritually akin
to many developing nations.</LD>
<LD>   In the United States, 59% of poll respondents said religion is
"very important" in their lives.</LD>
<LD>   That was well above the numbers for other industrialized nations,
including Britain (33%), Canada (30%), Italy (27%), South Korea
(25%), Germany (21%), Japan (12%) and France (11%).</LD>
<TE>   The poll was sponsored by the Washington-based Pew Research Center
for the People and the Press, which previously issued data comparing
political attitudes of 44 nations.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Kohut, the center director, said previous international
polling by the Gallup organization had found similar religious
patterns.</TE>
<TE>   Kohut said he would leave it to historians and sociologists to
explain why America is distinct, but he stressed the political impact
of the findings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's who we are, who we've always been," he said, and this
"represents an important divide between the United States and our
traditional allies" on matters like abortion and use of new
biological technologies.</TE>
<TE>   All 10 African nations that were polled had higher levels of
religiousity than did the United States. Also higher were six nations
in Latin America and six in Asia (including Turkey, which lies partly
in Europe).</TE>
<TE>   Muslim nations ranked high in religiosity. Among traditionally
Christian countries, the United States was the only Western nation
with numbers similar to those in the Philippines and most of Latin
America.</TE>
<TE>   The project polled 38,000 people in 46 languages between July and
October. The margin of error varied by country from 2.1 percentage
points to 4.4 percentage points. In some developing nations, only
urban areas were covered.</TE>

<HD>Descendant of Chinese Royalty Named Bishop</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II has named Msg. Ignatius Wang, a descendant of
China's last royal dynasty, an auxiliary bishop in the Archdiocese of
San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   Wang, 68, a native of Beijing, is believed to be the first
Asian-born bishop in the U.S. Catholic Church.</LD>
<LD>   He has been assigned since 1974 to San Francisco, where about
one-quarter of the population is of Chinese descent.</LD>
<TE>   The Vatican said, in announcing Wang's appointment, that his
family, although Catholic for 12 generations, was related to the
Manchu emperors of the Ch'ing Dynasty, who ruled China from 1644
until 1911.</TE>
<TE>   Wang attended a seminary in Hong Kong and, after he was ordained
in 1959, studied canon law at the Pontifical Gregorian University in
Rome.</TE>
<TE>   Because he was unable to return to China, he was sent first to
Grenada in the Antilles.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, Wang served as a priest and on the archdiocesan
tribunal.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, he became coordinator of the apostolate to Chinese
Catholics; in 1994, director of the Society for the Propagation of
the Faith; and in 1998, chancellor of the archdiocese.</TE>

<HD>Anglican Groups Urge Focus on Sexual Policies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Keeping pressure on the new archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams,
several evangelical groups in the worldwide Anglican communion have
issued a statement contending that sexual policies should be a "first
order" of concern of the church.</LD>
<LD>   Many conservatives have been alarmed that Williams knowingly
ordained a practicing homosexual while he was a bishop in Wales.</LD>
<LD>   "The church has tried to teach sensitively the biblical norm of
lifelong heterosexual marriage and abstinence outside it, not just
for its own members but out of concern for the health, moral life,
well-being and character of the whole community," said the
evangelical groups' statement.</LD>
<TE>   Signers included Archbishop Peter Akinola, the Anglican primate of
Nigeria, and U.S. Episcopal bishops John Howe of central Florida and
James Stanton of Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, meanwhile, in his first public lecture since assuming
office, said society must "take religion a good deal more seriously"
as the Western world adapts to change.</TE>
<TE>   In the lecture, which was broadcast in Britain, Williams noted a
shift among nation states to market states, where responsibilities
have changed from protecting citizens to enabling free market
capitalism.</TE>
<TE>   "It means that government is free to encourage enterprise but not
to protect against risk, to try and increase the literal and
metaphorical purchasing power of citizens, but not to take for
granted anything much in the way of agreement about common goals or
social good," Williams said.</TE>

<HD>Lewis B. Smedes, 81; Theology Professor Studied Forgiveness</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry B. Stammer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lewis B. Smedes, a pioneer in forgiveness research and author of more
than 15 books, died Thursday at Methodist Hospital in Arcadia after a
fall Tuesday while putting up Christmas lights at his home in Sierra
Madre. He was 81.</LD>
<LD>   A professor emeritus of theology and ethics at Fuller Theological
Seminary in Pasadena, where he taught and wrote for 27 years, Smedes
was known for thought-provoking ideas on issues ranging from
forgiveness to human sexuality. At times, he broke the mold within
evangelical Christianity, the faith that nurtured and formed him
throughout his life, as when he allowed for a more nuanced
understanding of homosexual relationships rather than uncompromising
condemnation.</LD>
<LD>   But it was his insights into forgiveness as not simply a godly
virtue but a human necessity for getting on with one's life that
propelled Smedes from the academic cloister to the public
marketplace.</LD>
<TE>   He said a misconception about forgiveness is that an aggrieved
individual must wait for an apology. To wait, he said, is to leave
your future peace and happiness in the hands of the person who
injured you in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   He rejected the idea that unconditional forgiveness -- even when
the offender fails to apologize -- amounts to self-centeredness by
the victim and cheapens the value of forgiveness.</TE>
<TE>   "They call it American egoism," he said last year in an interview
with The Times. "I think they're all wet. They see it as cheap
forgiveness. I don't think it's ever cheap. It's costly."</TE>
<TE>   Its costliness would come as the aggrieved party worked his or her
way through four stages, described Friday by book editor Roy Carlisle
as: We hurt. We hate. We heal ourselves. We come together.</TE>
<TE>   Carlisle edited Smedes' 1985 "Forgive and Forget: Healing the Hurt
We Don't Deserve," which he said sold more than 500,000 copies.</TE>
<TE>   Smedes "said you go through this experience of being hurt and then
you go through this experience of having what he called that 'unfair
pain.' Then you respond in anger; 'the tiger snarling in the soul'
was his wonderful phrase," Carlisle recalled.</TE>
<TE>   That leads to a decision to forgive, and then to express that to
another person, said Carlisle, now a senior editor at Crossroad
Publishing in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Pott, executive editor at William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.
in Grand Rapids, Mich., which published Smedes' "Sex for Christians"
in 1976, said the author had the rigorous mind of a theologian and
the heart of a pastor.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not only a matter of being able to bring theology to bear
meaningfully to the most important human concerns -- the kind of
things that keep us awake -- but his sensitivity to the complexity of
human life didn't allow him to settle for easy theological answers,"
Pott said. "He wrestled with God, and he wrestled with human
problems."</TE>
<TE>   In a 1999 interview with the Detroit Free Press, Smedes' knack for
eloquence and metaphor was evident when he spoke of Jesus' death as
"opening the sluice gates to forgiveness from God."</TE>
<TE>   Everett Worthington, chairman of the psychology department and
professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, said Friday that many,
including himself, have followed Smedes into the study of
forgiveness.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at the literature that existed in 1984, it was
pretty thin and pretty diverse and didn't use what I called once the
'F word' -- forgiveness. He made it legitimate to talk about that,"
Worthington said. He said Smedes' 1985 book opened the door for
forgiveness to be examined not only by theologians but by
psychologists and others.</TE>
<TE>   Among Smedes' other books are "Caring and Commitment," "Keeping
Hope Alive," "Mere Morality: What God Expects From Ordinary People"
and "A Life of Distinction: What It Takes to LiveWith Courage,
Honesty and Gratitude."</TE>
<TE>   Richard J. Mouw, president of Fuller, on Friday called Smedes "an
influential interpreter of our kind of open evangelicalism."</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Allan Schranz of Sutton Place Synagogue in New York said
Smedes was a man of "soaring intellect" whose devoutness was "the
bloom of his mind and soul."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Michigan in 1921, Smedes married Doris Dekker in 1948.
They had three children: Catherine, Charles and John.</TE>
<TE>   He studied at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, receiving a
bachelor's degree in 1947. He earned a master's of divinity at Calvin
Theological Seminary, also in Grand Rapids, in 1950 and a PhD in 1953
from the Free University of Amsterdam. He also studied at Oxford
University in England and the University of Basel in Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   After several years of pastoral ministry in the Christian Reformed
Church, he became a professor of religion and theology at Calvin
College. He came to Fuller in 1968 and accepted a chair in theology
and psychology in 1990. He retired in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Mouw said Smedes' classroom prayers were often as notable as his
lectures.</TE>
<TE>   "More than one of his former students has said that, while his
class lectures were unforgettable, it was worth coming to class just
to hear his opening prayer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Besides his wife and children, he is survived by two
grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. next
Saturday at Pasadena Presbyterian Church, 585 E. Colorado Blvd.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial gifts may be sent to Child SHARE, 1544 W. Glenoaks Blvd.,
Glendale, CA 91201.</TE>

<HD>Ezra Solomon, 82; Nixon Aide, Economics Expert</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elaine Woo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ezra Solomon, a Stanford University economist credited with making
the study of finance more theory-based, died of a stroke Dec. 9 at
his campus home. He was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Solomon was the author of "The Theory of Financial Management,"
which was published in 1963 and is still considered a seminal work by
finance scholars. Beginning in 1965, he was also editor for several
years of the Prentice-Hall series "Foundation of Finance," which was
influential in accounting and finance.</LD>
<LD>   As adept in the world of policy as he was in academe, he served on
President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisors from 1971 to 1973,
when the Nixon administration suspended the gold standard for the
dollar and imposed wage and price controls in an attempt to remold
the world economy.</LD>
<TE>   Before teaching at Stanford, Solomon served on the faculty at the
University of Chicago, home of a school of economists who emphasized
the importance of regulating the supply of money to direct the
economy. Despite his long association with the Chicago school,
Solomon was known for his analytical, nondoctrinaire thinking.</TE>
<TE>   He gave U.S. senators an inkling of his independence during his
confirmation hearing in June 1971.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not against letting the dollar float. It is one way of
finding parity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people go to Washington and wind up thinking they can
give political advice," said former Secretary of State George P.
Shultz, who was a colleague of Solomon when both taught at the
University of Chicago. "Ezra stuck to economic advice and agreed with
the fundamentals. He was a gifted economist, with real wit, and had a
wonderful, candid, clear way of expressing himself."</TE>
<TE>   Solomon, born and raised in Burma (now Myanmar), earned a degree
in economics from the University of Rangoon in 1940. Soon after his
graduation, the Japanese army occupied Burma, forcing his family to
flee to India.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the Burma Division of the British Royal Navy and became
commander of a gunboat. He left his command in 1947 to accept a
fellowship for overseas graduate study at the University of Chicago,
where he soon became a professor and a naturalized U.S. citizen. He
earned his doctorate in 1950 and remained on the Chicago faculty
until 1956, when he moved west.</TE>
<TE>   At Stanford, he became founding director of the International
Center for the Advancement of Management Education, which drew
faculty from business schools in developing nations for a year of
intensive study. He later became the business school's first Dean
Witter Distinguished Professor of Finance.</TE>
<TE>   During his three decades at Stanford, he wrote 13 books and more
than 100 papers, and was known for his incisive lectures and generous
mentoring.</TE>
<TE>   "He became a leader in transforming [Stanford's] Graduate School
of Business, then a parochial West Coast school, into a world-class
academic institution," said economist and longtime Stanford colleague
Gerald Meier.</TE>
<TE>   His wife of 53 years, the former Janet Lorraine Cameron, died Nov.
14. Solomon is survived by three daughters, Catherine Shan Solomon of
Newark, Calif., Ming Solomon Lovejoy of Eureka, Mont., and Lorna
Solomon-Oyarce of Stanford; and five grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Protesters Petition Antonovich to Stop Removal of Old Oak</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Krikorian</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chanting "Uproot Antonovich, not the tree," a group of supporters
joined by actress Rene Russo gathered Friday at the Los Angeles
County Hall of Administration to protest Supervisor Mike Antonovich's
proposal to move a 400-year-old oak tree for a road-widening project.</LD>
<LD>   The more than two dozen protesters delivered a petition to the
supervisor's office signed by 4,000 people who favor keeping the tree
at its present location on Pico Canyon Road in the Santa Clarita
Valley.</LD>
<LD>   "That tree represents California and it's beauty," said Russo, a
Los Angeles native. "I think it's time we wake up and fight to bring
the beauty of California back to this city."</LD>
<TE>   Antonovich, who represents the unincorporated area of Stevenson
Ranch, where the oak is located, did not meet with the demonstrators.
But a spokesman said the supervisor believes that the best solution
is to move the tree.</TE>
<TE>   During the rally, Russo said that Valley Crest Tree Co., a large
tree supplier that had agreed to move the towering oak, is no longer
willing to risk damaging the tree. The company had said the tree
could be moved but could not guarantee how long it would live.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to thank Valley Crest for the good news," Russo said.
"They do not want to put the tree in danger."</TE>
<TE>   Stuart Sperber, chief executive of Valley Crest, confirmed that
the company had pulled out of the project "because of the circus
atmosphere and bad publicity."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign to save the tree began Nov. 1, when activist John
Quigley climbed up the towering oak in protest over its planned
removal for the road project. John Laing Homes, the developer of a
nearby subdivision, is required to widen the road as part of its
county building permit.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley has vowed to remain in the tree until an alternative to
moving the oak is found.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, this week, a Valencia-based engineer offered a design
plan that would split the roadway in two, leaving a narrow wedge in
between for the tree. Quigley said Friday he was encouraged by the
proposal and by the support he has received from the community.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we are now down to the right conversation, which is the
fine points of going around the tree," he said. "I don't think at
this stage they would move it."</TE>
<TE>   But Tony Bell, an Antonovich spokesman, said the supervisor is not
swayed by the new roadway plan supported by environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is about public safety," Bell said. "Since Day 1, we've
said, if there were a way to safely leave the tree in place, the
Department of Public Works would have found it."</TE>

<HD>Man Killed by Trash Truck While Crossing the Street</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 43-year-old Oxnard man trying to cross a street was crushed in or
near a crosswalk by a city garbage truck just before dawn Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Jayantilal Joitaram Patel, dressed in a dark coat and dark pants,
was killed when the 4-ton truck ran over him at Ventura Road and 5th
Street, authorities said. His body was found just outside the
crosswalk. He died immediately from severe chest and abdominal
injuries, said Craig Stevens, senior deputy medical examiner.</LD>
<LD>   A witness told authorities the truck's driver was heading east on
5th Street and attempting to make a right turn onto southbound
Ventura Road as Patel tried to cross the street on a green light,
Stevens said. However, it was unclear whether the pedestrian signal
was flashing "walk" or "don't walk," Stevens said.</LD>
<TE>   The driver, 40-year-old Andres Corona Jr., was questioned at the
scene by Oxnard police, but not cited. Officials in the city's Solid
Waste Division could not be reached Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The intersection was closed for about four hours Friday morning as
Oxnard traffic officers investigated.</TE>

<HD>Ousted Fairground Chief Gets $24,000</HD>
<DH>Under the severance agreement, Roger Gibbs agrees not to
sue. 'Philosophical differences' with the board are cited.</DH>

<LD>The popular Ventura County fairgrounds chief who was forced from his
job by a divided fair board will leave with a severance check of
$24,000.</LD>
<LD>   Roger Gibbs, 56, had held his $93,000-a-year position for two
years.</LD>
<LD>   Under an agreement released Friday, Gibbs agreed not to sue the
district over his monthlong paid suspension or his resignation.</LD>
<TE>   The agreement said Gibbs and the fair board had "experienced
philosophical differences over the management and operation" of
Seaside Park, the 62-acre oceanfront fairgrounds in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs' supporters say he objected to efforts by several fair board
members intent on getting more revenue from the property. They fear
those plans would sacrifice such down-home events as stock-car racing
and rodeos for attractions like an upscale concert venue.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs quit his job during the fair board's Tuesday meeting, saying
he would be ineffective working for a board that was split 4 to 4 on
whether to retain him.</TE>

<HD>Community Raises Over $5,000 for Child's Burial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandra Murillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The parents of a 9-year-old Oxnard girl who bravely fought leukemia
before dying Monday have raised enough money to have her buried in
their hometown in central Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   People touched by Sarahi Cuecuecha's two-year struggle against the
blood disease have donated more than the $3,200 the family needed for
the funeral and to ship the body home.</LD>
<LD>   "To be honest, I was surprised by the tremendous outpouring of
support and generosity," said Oxnard Elementary School District Supt.
Richard Duarte. "I was overjoyed at the feeling that everyone wanted
to help."</LD>
<TE>   The district's educational foundation headed the brief
fund-raising effort that had generated more than $5,000 in
contributions by Friday. Donations ranged from $30 by Sarahi's
classmates and $400 by Pictsweet farm workers to $800 by school
district officials. Three people have offered to match the total of
all donations, Duarte said. Other donations included change collected
from children's savings and $500 from Childrens Hospital in Los
Angeles, where Sarahi had been treated before she fell ill at home
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The girl's family is grateful for the outpouring of kindness, said
Sarahi's aunt, Marcela Vega. "This is a very difficult time for them,
and I can't even imagine how much they're hurting," Vega said. "But
[the mother] feels very grateful. She is thankful so many people
helped out."</TE>
<TE>   Family and friends were expected to say a rosary Friday evening
before the child's body is transported today to the village of
Panzacola north of Mexico City, Vega said.</TE>
<TE>   It was very important to the parents, Cristina and Amado
Cuecuecha, that their daughter be laid to rest in Panzacola, Vega
said. Although she was born in Ventura, Sarahi lived in Tlaxacala for
several years before her parents brought her to the United States
more than two years ago for better medical care.</TE>
<TE>   Sarahi traveled to Children's Hospital as often as once a week for
chemotherapy. On Sunday, her parents rushed her to Ventura County
Medical Center after she complained of pain. An infection had ravaged
Sarahi's body. She died the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Sarahi's fourth-grade teacher, Isabel Olachea, said she would
attend the girl's wake and give her parents the perseverance award
their daughter would have received in school this week. "She never
complained about being sick or showed any signs of being ill,"
Olachea said. "She just kept going no matter what."</TE>

<HD>Mudslide Briefly Closes 101 Freeway</HD>
<DH>The county has received up to 4 inches of rain along the
coast since Monday, with one more system to go. Season's totals top
last winter's.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly J. Wolcott and Jenifer Ragland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A steady rain saturated coastal Ventura County and covered the
mountains with snow early Friday, loosening mud that briefly closed
the Ventura Freeway, triggering a power outage, but causing little
flooding and no serious accidents.</LD>
<LD>   Thursday night's storm, the second of three expected this week,
dropped nearly 2 inches of rain at the county Government Center in
Ventura and in the mountains above Santa Paula and Ojai. About an
inch fell in Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   "Our rainy season is definitely here," said Mark Lenz, a
meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Oxnard.</LD>
<TE>   A final moderate rain system is expected to roll through this
afternoon with at least an inch of precipitation. Since Monday, the
county has received up to 4 inches along the coast and more than 5
inches in the mountains, according to the county's flood control
district.</TE>
<TE>   Rain totals this season have already passed those for all of last
winter in many county locations.</TE>
<TE>   While this evening's rain is expected to be milder than Thursday
night's, temperatures in the mountains will remain in the 20s and
30s, cold enough to keep snow on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "It snowed all night, and from what I can see on top of the cars
outside, it looks like more than a foot," said Sheriff's Deputy
Robert Berger, who is stationed in Lockwood Valley at an elevation of
about 5,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Berger said snow started falling about 7 p.m. Thursday and
continued through the night, causing white-out conditions for drivers
and stranding cars.</TE>
<TE>   Berger and his partner spent most of Friday helping area residents
dig out their driveways. Between 5 and 8 inches of snow could fall
today and Sunday, he said, adding that the temperature Friday
afternoon was 28 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Snow chains are required on Lockwood Valley Road and on most roads
between Lockwood Valley and Frazier Park in northern Los Angeles
County. County crews were scheduled to work through the night to
clear snow from roads in the area, Berger said.</TE>
<TE>   The snow level could dip to 3,500 feet by this afternoon, said
Dessa Garton, a Weather Service manager in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a weaker system so we probably won't have all
the warnings and watches we had on Thursday," she added. A high surf
advisory warning of 6- to 10-foot breakers remained in effect Friday.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, rain started about mid-evening and continued until
shortly before sunrise Friday. The system brought strong winds and
downpours along the coast and provided a steady rain in Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   The storm left the county far ahead of normal rainfall for late
December. County officials said that local reservoirs could fill
completely if rain continues at the current pace.</TE>
<TE>   A two-mile section of the Ventura Freeway south of Carpinteria was
closed from 2:30 to 5:30 a.m. Friday, after mud on the road caused
several spinouts, said California Highway Patrol spokesman Steve
Reid.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic was rerouted onto Old Rincon Highway as California
Department of Transportation workers cleaned up the mess and secured
the adjacent hillside.</TE>
<TE>   The storm knocked out power for some Thousand Oaks residents for
about six minutes at 2:30 a.m. Friday, but no other incidents in
Ventura County were reported, said Nancy Williams, a regional manager
for Southern California Edison.</TE>
<TE>   "We were pretty fortunate last night in Ventura County," she said.</TE>

<HD>Lott Resigns His Post as Senate GOP Leader</HD>
<DH>Within hours, Republican lawmakers rush to back Bill Frist
of Tennessee. He is expected to be named Monday as replacement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Senate Republican leader Trent Lott, who unleashed a national furor
with a racially divisive remark, resigned his post Friday as GOP
senators rushed to anoint Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee his successor.</LD>
<LD>   In a rapid end to a lingering controversy, Frist is expected to be
named Senate majority leader Monday by his Republican colleagues for
the Congress that convenes in January.</LD>
<LD>   Lott, 61, had maintained for days that he would survive the
controversy that engulfed him, encouraged by several prominent
senators who stuck by him. But Friday morning -- less than 24 hours
after Frist publicly announced a bid for the leadership post -- Lott
abruptly abandoned his fight to retain the job.</LD>
<TE>   "In the interest of pursuing the best possible agenda for the
future of our country, I will not seek to remain as majority leader
of the United States Senate for the 108th Congress," Lott said in a
statement. He said he will keep the Senate seat from Mississippi he
has held 14 years.</TE>
<TE>   The White House was given no notice of the announcement,
reflecting the strains that had developed between the Bush
administration and Lott since the remark that seemed to embrace
segregation. President Bush last week sharply criticized Lott's Dec.
5 remarks as "offensive" and "wrong," seriously undermining any
chance Lott had of riding out the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to Lott's resignation, Bush said: "I respect the very
difficult decision Trent made on behalf of the American people. Trent
is a valued friend, and a man I respect."</TE>
<TE>   Within hours of Lott's announcement, all significant opposition to
Frist's candidacy melted away.</TE>
<TE>   Eager to ratify their choice as quickly as possible, the GOP
lawmakers moved up an emergency meeting they had planned for Jan. 6.
The vote to replace Lott now is scheduled for Monday by conference
call.</TE>
<TE>   In turning to Frist, a wealthy former heart surgeon emblematic of
a new generation of Southern politicians, Republicans hope to move
past questions of their commitment to racial equality that have
haunted the party. Frist also is closely allied with the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Frist, 50, praised Lott's decision. "He has always put concern for
his family, country and colleagues first and demonstrated that
today," a statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Frist also acknowledged the high stakes for Republicans, who in
January will control both houses of Congress and the presidency. "We
all know that we have a unique opportunity to accomplish great things
for America during the next few months," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With his background as a doctor, Frist will provide expertise on
an issue expected to be on the front burner in the next Congress:
health care. He is well-versed in AIDS policy, Medicare, managed
care, prescription drugs and bioterrorism and has worked frequently
with Democrats on many of these issues.</TE>
<TE>   Lott's resignation culminated a startling 15-day political
meltdown. While some House leaders in recent years have been felled
by scandal or coup, no Senate party leader had been forced out of
office amid such controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Only five weeks ago, Lott was reelected GOP leader without
opposition. Humiliated in mid-2001 when Sen. James M. Jeffords of
Vermont defected from the GOP, handing Senate control to Democrats,
Lott was celebrating the party's return to the majority because of
gains in November's midterm elections.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Sen. Strom Thurmond's 100th birthday party Dec. 5.</TE>
<TE>   In many respects, it was what Lott later described as a
light-hearted celebration for the venerable Republican from South
Carolina. There was a Marilyn Monroe impersonator and jokes and
laughter aplenty.</TE>
<TE>   Lott spoke after former Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) -- his wisecracking
predecessor as majority leader. Lott noted that Thurmond carried
Mississippi in 1948 when he ran for president as a Dixiecrat. He
added: "And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we
wouldn't have had all these problems over all these years, either."</TE>
<TE>   By seeming to endorse the policy of racial segregation that
Thurmond fervently advocated at the time -- an impression Lott
insisted later was inaccurate -- he drew attention to his party's
perennially weak standing among black voters and his own spotty
record on civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   His repeated apologies failed to extinguish the questions. The
ongoing furor also threatened to undermine Bush's legislative goals
only weeks after the Republican electoral triumph.</TE>
<TE>   In the days before Lott's resignation, momentum was building for
Frist to replace him. After Lott's announcement, Republicans
stampeded toward the two-term Tennessee senator they hailed as a
conciliatory figure with a generally conservative record who is known
to have Bush's ear.</TE>
<TE>   By Friday afternoon, it was clear that Frist had locked up the
support of well over half of the 51 Republicans who will serve in
next year's Senate.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, an array of key senators endorsed Frist. They included
Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the outgoing Republican whip who was Lott's
second in command and rival for power; Mitch McConnell of Kentucky,
the incoming whip and a primary Lott supporter; and Kay Bailey
Hutchison of Texas, whose name had been floated earlier as a
potential candidate for Lott's job.</TE>
<TE>   The last prominent holdout was Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, the
third-ranking Senate Republican, who had been supporting Lott. He
briefly considered a late bid for majority leader, backed by some
activists who view him a more reliable conservative than Frist. But
Santorum ended up endorsing Frist, removing the last doubts that he
would succeed Lott.</TE>
<TE>   House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois said the party should
draw a lesson from Lott's resignation. "The legacy of segregation is
a stain on our nation's history," Hastert said. "Let us learn from
this incident that we must all strive to come together as a community
and as a nation."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, who have been watching Republicans squirm over the
racial controversy for two weeks, said Lott's resignation would not
end the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said the
GOP's new leader "must confront the Republican Party's record on race
and embrace policies that promote genuine healing and greater
opportunity for all Americans."</TE>
<TE>   Incoming House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco)
said: "The Republican Party still needs to do much more to remove the
issue of race and any of its symbols from our political process." She
challenged Bush and the GOP to disassociate themselves from the
Confederate flag -- still a powerful icon in Southern politics.</TE>
<TE>   It had not been immediately clear that Lott's now-infamous remarks
would provoke such a backlash.</TE>
<TE>   The Thurmond party was broadcast on C-SPAN, but most media outlets
were slow to take note of Lott's remarks. When it was first reported,
much of official Washington thought, as Lott did, that the incident
would quickly pass.</TE>
<TE>   Lott first apologized for the statements Dec. 9. The next day,
White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said the apology appeared
to be the final word on the matter. Bush, Fleischer said, supported
Lott as leader "unquestionably."</TE>
<TE>   But critics from the left and right rejected the first apology,
and several subsequent Lott apologies, as insufficient. On Dec. 12,
Bush delivered his scolding to Lott during a speech in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Though the White House publicly sought to maintain neutrality in
the unfolding leadership scramble, Bush's rebuke of Lott strongly
signaled that the administration would not object to a change. Lott
complained that administration aides were undermining him through
anonymous quotes to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   By last weekend, internal debate within the party was raging.
Nickles on Sunday called for a new meeting of GOP senators to
reconsider the leadership position. On Monday, Frist issued a
statement distancing himself from Lott.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the week, Frist gathered support behind the scenes,
aided by the goodwill he had banked as the most recent chairman of
the National Republican Senatorial Committee. On Wednesday,
Republican senators began calling Lott to urge him to step aside. One
-- Sen. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island -- did so publicly. Lott
resisted.</TE>
<TE>   One source close to Lott said Lott thought he could have competed
strongly against Frist, but that the fight would have torn the party
apart. The source described Lott as being in "a positive, analytical
mood."</TE>
<TE>   In his one-paragraph resignation e-mailed to the media, Lott said
his resignation is effective Jan. 6, a day before the new Congress
convenes.</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate sign that Lott had been offered a committee
chairmanship or other party post to ease his fall from power. Lott
remained in seclusion Friday at his home in Pascagoula, Miss., where
his wife, Tricia, turned away reporters who gathered outside in hopes
of further comment.</TE>
<TE>   She distributed a handwritten note signed by the man who is now
the outgoing Senate Republican leader.</TE>
<TE>   "My official written statement was released from Washington at 11
EST. There will be no statement to the television media! Please go
home."</TE>

<HD>Estimates Are Submitted In Church Abuse Suits</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>In a step aimed at resolving more than 400 sex-abuse lawsuits filed
against the Boston Archdiocese, lawyers for alleged victims submitted
rough estimates Friday of how much money they are seeking.</LD>
<LD>   The undisclosed figures were submitted by about two dozen lawyers
and were based on descriptions of the alleged abuse, how alleged
victims were hurt and how much money the lawyers believe their
clients should receive.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for the archdiocese have until Jan. 15 to respond. If the
two sides are not too far apart, the lawsuits could be sent to
mediators to oversee settlements.</LD>
<TE>   Plaintiffs' lawyers would not reveal details of the estimates or
say what they expect the combined total to be.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Carmen Durso, who represents 35 plaintiffs, said the
lawyers submitted a range of amounts they are willing to negotiate
for their clients as a group.</TE>
<TE>   The church doesn't "so much care how much John Smith who was
victimized is asking for. What's important for them is to get a
handle on the total amount that all the plaintiffs are looking for,"
Durso said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Jeffrey Newman, whose firm represents 222 alleged
victims, said the archdiocese's lawyers will probably submit the
estimates to the Roman Catholic Church's insurance carriers to see
how much they will cover.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese's lead lawyer, Wilson Rogers Jr., did not return a
call seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the personnel files of four more priests were released
Friday by plaintiffs' attorneys. The files include allegations of
sexual abuse made against them and the archdiocese's handling of
them.</TE>

<HD>Some Damage Control Work Remains for GOP</HD>
<DH>With Lott gone, the firestorm is out, but the 'whole affair
resurfaced all the lingering negative stories' of the party, a
strategist says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Trent Lott's decision to step down as Senate Republican leader
abruptly ends a political firestorm that had consumed the party. But
some Republicans believe the GOP needs to do more to recover from a
controversy that reached beyond the fate of a single senator into the
soul of his entire party.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans are hoping that Lott's departure will send a clear
message that the GOP does not tolerate anything smacking of sympathy
with racism, and reinforce President Bush's determination to make his
party more welcoming to minorities.</LD>
<LD>   "We had a problem. We took care of it," said William J. Bennett, a
conservative commentator who had called for Lott's resignation. "The
fact that [Lott's] comments provoked such a strong reaction and such
quick action is to our credit."</LD>
<TE>   But at least for now, the episode could be a setback for
Republicans on two fronts. It may damage the party's image among
swing voters throughout the country who embrace ethnic and racial
tolerance. And as an emotional reminder of the South's legacy of
racism, the furor has been tantamount to a get-out-the-vote drive for
blacks, who vote overwhelmingly for Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole affair resurfaced all the lingering negative stories
about the Republican Party and race -- and reminded Democrats why
they are Democrats," a senior Republican strategist said.</TE>
<TE>   That's why some Republicans believe that, even with Lott gone as a
party leader, Bush and the GOP have work to do to truly put the
controversy behind them -- an impulse that could give a big boost to
the agenda of "compassionate conservatism" that Bush has advocated
but, in the view of some, not always made a priority.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're going to have to make a very clear statement on the
issue of race relations," Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.) said on CNN.
"Clearly we need to deal with it as a nation and we need to deal with
it as a party." Said Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.): "There's been this
loud wake-up call to the Republican Party.... Stop talking like the
party of Lincoln and start acting like it."</TE>
<TE>   The controversy's outcome is good news for Bush, whose stinging
public criticism of his own party's Senate leader was probably the
single biggest factor in forcing Lott to step down.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush has emerged stronger," said Merle Black, an expert in
Southern politics at Emory University in Atlanta. "He's going to have
a Senate leader who's more in sync with him. He's established his
leadership of the Republican Party."</TE>
<TE>   Lott's resignation gives Bush and Republicans in Congress an
opportunity to recapture some of the initiative they gained in the
November midterm elections -- and then proceeded to squander after
Lott said the nation would have been better off if Sen. Strom
Thurmond's 1948 segregationist presidential campaign had been
successful.</TE>
<TE>   It was an offhand comment Dec. 5 at Thurmond's 100th birthday
party that Lott, in repeated apologies, said was simply meant to
honor the South Carolinian, not to embrace segregation.</TE>
<TE>   But the controversy rocked the GOP just as it was celebrating an
election that increased its House majority and gave the party control
of the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Fevered preparations for a fast start in the new Congress --
including early action on spending bills, an economic stimulus
package and an extension of unemployment benefits -- were undercut
when Senate Republicans were plunged into unrelenting soul-searching
about the future of their leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Even with Lott gone, it's clear that the controversy has taken a
toll. "I don't sense that anyone thinks that we go now into [the new
Congress] with the same momentum we had in November," a senior
Republican aide said.</TE>
<TE>   Some Republicans hope the broader damage to the party from the
Lott controversy will be contained because most voters do not take
their cues about a party's message from the Senate leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "It is bad," a Republican strategist close to the White House
said. "But most of these swing voters take their view of the broad
value stuff -- tolerance, compassion -- from the president."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans will be pushing their legislative agenda in a
dramatically different political context than a month ago. Race has
been catapulted to the front burner of the policy debates, after an
election in which it was generally not a big issue.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is a silver lining to the Lott controversy, it may be a
new emerging dialogue on race," said Doug Muzzio, a professor of
public affairs at Baruch College at the City University of New York.
"One of the positive outgrowths of this episode may be a more full
and honest assessment of the American dilemma at the turn of the
century. Exactly what that will mean for Republican legislative
priorities is unclear."</TE>
<TE>   "There will be heightened sensitivity to the issue and to trying
to demonstrate what a lot of [Senate Republicans] feel they are
about," said a source close to Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee, who is
expected to become the majority leader. "Whether that translates into
legislation or not is not clear."</TE>
<TE>   Brownback has suggested that the Senate set up a special committee
to discuss racial reconciliation.</TE>
<TE>   Some Republicans say they should do a better job of explaining how
GOP initiatives such as school vouchers and spurring economic growth
benefit minorities.</TE>
<TE>   "The Republican agenda is going to be one that is going to be
filled with hope," said Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.).</TE>
<TE>   As they sort through the aftermath of the Lott controversy,
Republicans are already divided on what it means for their position
on affirmative action. Specter, for one, wrote to Bush this week
urging him to support the University of Michigan's affirmative action
program that is being challenged before the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "The spotlight which has been placed on this issue as a result of
Sen. Lott's statement should lead our party to a closer examination
of this matter," Specter said in his letter to the president.</TE>
<TE>   But Bennett argues the opposite, that Republicans should oppose
affirmative action for the same reason they deplore the segregation
Lott seemed to embrace. Racial preferences in university admissions
"is a system of segregation as well."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, meanwhile, express skepticism that Republicans will
match their words with deeds.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the challenge of President Bush and the Republican Party is
to finally demonstrate in substantive policy initiatives their
commitment to expand opportunity for all Americans," said a statement
by the Congressional Black Caucus, which applauded Lott for stepping
down.</TE>
<TE>   One thing is clear: Members of both parties are now likely to
tread more carefully around the racial issue.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone in public life will be even more careful than in the
past about any comments that relate, however tangentially, about
race," said Whit Ayres, a GOP pollster.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still a deeply emotional subject in American life, even
though most Americans have gotten beyond their obsession with race."</TE>

<LD>A Texas man behind a worldwide e-mail ring that traded pornographic
images of children, some as young as 18 months old, was sentenced to
the maximum of 30 years in federal prison.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm sorry for the children in the pictures," Mark Bates, 33, of
Palestine said. "I was using the pictures so I wouldn't go out and
hurt anyone. I wasn't thinking there was actually a person behind the
pictures."</LD>
<LD>   Bates pleaded guilty to trafficking in child pornography via
computer. He was the moderator of the "Candyman" e-mail group that
served more than 6,000 users, who were expected to contribute images
as well as receive them. More than 80 people in 26 states were
arrested in the case in March.</LD>

<LD>A law that makes it a crime to possess many of the materials used in
manufacturing methamphetamine was declared unconstitutional by the
Nevada Supreme Court.</LD>
<LD>   The court said it recognized the "evil" targeted by the law, but
said the law lacks an "intent element" and thus imposes criminal
sanctions on what is otherwise noncriminal activity.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling in Carson City, involving two Washoe County cases, said
the law's purpose isn't to convict people for possessing a few common
household items that could be used to make a controlled substance.</LD>

<LD>About 300 sailors aboard the Theodore Roosevelt were hit with the
stomach flu this week during a training exercise while the aircraft
carrier was off the Virginia and North Carolina coasts.</LD>
<LD>   The sailors were told to drink plenty of fluids, rest and wash
their hands frequently.</LD>
<LD>   The illness peaked four to five days ago among the crew of 5,000.
Tests showed that the sailors did not get sick from a Norwalk-like
virus, which has been blamed for recent outbreaks on a number of
cruise ships, a spokesman in Norfolk for the Navy's Atlantic Fleet
said.</LD>

<HD>Proposed Internet Monitoring Center Worries Industry</HD>
<DH>Trade groups don't want the government to lead an effort to
head off cyber-attacks. White House denies plans to read citizens'
e-mail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The White House is proposing an Internet-wide monitoring center to
detect and defend against major cyber-attacks, but the Bush
administration sought Friday to ease worries it might scrutinize
individual users' e-mail along with other data traffic.</LD>
<LD>   Some Internet industry executives and lawyers said they would
raise civil liberties concerns if the U.S. government, not an
industry consortium, operated such a powerful monitoring center. The
proposal would require congressional approval.</LD>
<LD>   Under federal wiretap laws, privately operated centers can in some
circumstances analyze e-mail and other data flowing across parts of
the Internet without approval from a judge.</LD>
<TE>   President Bush's top cyberspace advisor, Richard Clarke, on Friday
strongly disputed concerns about government broadly eavesdropping on
citizen e-mail. Clarke wrote there was "nothing ... which in any way
suggests or proposes a government system that could extend to
monitoring individuals' e-mails."</TE>
<TE>   Clarke sent the letter to Harris Miller, the head of a prominent
trade group, the Information Technology Assn. of America. He said the
White House plan "articulates a strong policy of protecting citizens'
privacy in cyberspace."</TE>
<TE>   The industry's fears appeared to stem from a subtle change between
an earlier proposal and one currently circulated within the
administration as part of its forthcoming "National Strategy to
Secure Cyberspace," set for release early next year.</TE>
<TE>   The latest draft, parts of which were obtained by Associated
Press, envisions a monitoring center to "analyze and exchange data
about attacks that could prevent exploits from escalating and causing
damage or disruption of vital systems."</TE>
<TE>   It said the center "could be operated by the private sector but
could share information with the federal government through the
Department of Homeland Security."</TE>
<TE>   The administration's earlier proposal, released in September as a
draft for public comment, said explicitly that such a monitoring
center "would not be a government entity and would be managed by a
private board."</TE>
<TE>   A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Friday that the administration still envisions that any such
monitoring operation would be run by the private sector.</TE>
<TE>   "The latest proposal seems to make this more aggressive, put the
government in charge of it," said Stewart Baker, a Washington lawyer
who represents the U.S. Internet Service Provider Assn.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the new Department of Homeland Security, Brian
Roehrkasse, said Friday there was no proposal that would call for
monitoring e-mail and other data traffic of Internet users.</TE>
<TE>   Roehrkasse said he could not describe proposals that have not been
publicly announced, such as whether the monitoring center should be
operated by industry or government.</TE>

<HD>Lawmaker Says He Felt 'Segregationist'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Responding to Sen. Trent Lott's recent comments, Rep. Cass Ballenger
told a newspaper he has had "segregationist feelings" himself after
conflicts with a black colleague. Friday morning, he went on local
radio to say it was a stupid comment to make.</LD>
<LD>   Ballenger, a North Carolina Republican, had said in Friday's
Charlotte Observer that former Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.) so
provoked him that "I must admit I had segregationist feelings."</LD>
<LD>   "If I had to listen to her, I probably would have developed a
little bit of a segregationist feeling," Ballenger told the Observer.
"But I think everybody can look at my life and what I've done and say
that's not true."</LD>
<TE>   McKinney, who lost her reelection bid last month, could not be
reached for comment. Friday morning, Ballenger told Charlotte radio
station WBT that the comments were "pretty stupid on my part" and
that he didn't think he had segregationist feelings.</TE>
<TE>   "I talk too much," Ballenger said. "In that specific case, I was
trying to say that almost anybody can develop an animosity to
individuals. In this particular case, I picked on Cynthia McKinney
because she was what I consider less than patriotic to the United
States."</TE>
<TE>   Ballenger's chief of staff, Dan Gurley, told Associated Press on
Friday that Ballenger's comment was "not a general statement of his
belief."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Melvin Watt, a black Democrat from Charlotte, said he
believed race wasn't the main motivation for Ballenger's words. "I
suspect that whatever she's doing that's gnawing on him has to do
more with what she's saying and how she's saying it than the fact
that she's black," he said.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As he prepares to become the next Senate majority leader, Bill Frist
is on the cusp of another milestone in a second career that some
believe may include a run for the White House in 2008.</LD>
<LD>   "Fristy" to his ally President Bush, the heart-and-lung transplant
surgeon-turned-senator from Tennessee had already been mentioned as a
possible secretary of the new Department of Homeland Security, a
future party leader in the Senate, even Bush's running mate in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   Not bad for a man who didn't bother to vote until age 34.</LD>
<TE>   The 51-seat Senate Republican majority will find in Frist a
consensus builder. Like Bush, he presents himself as a "compassionate
conservative."</TE>
<TE>   For years, this scion of a wealthy Tennessee family has spent
portions of his congressional vacations performing free surgeries all
over Africa, sometimes under flashlights.</TE>
<TE>   But Frist's unassuming, straight-arrow persona belies a sharply
partisan streak that surfaces during election campaigns -- as
Democratic Senate candidates discovered this fall.</TE>
<TE>   As head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Frist, 50
years old and two years into his second term, engineered the party's
recapture of the Senate last month by raising more than $100 million
and waging a hard-hitting ad campaign that exploited Southern
Democrats' opposition to the display of the Confederate flag.</TE>
<TE>   William H. Frist is a fourth-generation Tennessean and the first
physician to serve in the Senate since 1928.</TE>
<TE>   He learned to pilot a plane as a teenager and soloed for the first
time at age 16.</TE>
<TE>   His father, Thomas Frist Sr., was a cardiologist who in 1968
founded the Hospital Corp. of America, now known as HCA, the nation's
largest chain of for-profit hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   According to the congressional newspaper Roll Call, with personal
wealth of about $20 million, the senator is in ninth place in the
Senate's roll of millionaires, just behind Edward M. Kennedy
(D-Mass.).</TE>
<TE>   As a source of wealth, HCA could prove politically nettlesome down
the road as Frist comes under increased scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   After a lengthy federal investigation, the company pleaded guilty
in 2000 to charges of large-scale Medicare fraud, and agreed to pay
more than $880 million in fines and restitution.</TE>
<TE>   Frist, who never worked at HCA, was untouched by the
investigation. But his Senate financial disclosure forms indicate
that he, his wife and their children hold millions of dollars in HCA
stock.</TE>
<TE>   Frist and his wife have also held smaller investments in other
health-related companies, the disclosure forms show. And during his
time in the Senate, he has accepted more than $1.8 million in
campaign contributions from health-care and related industries,
according to data compiled by campaign finance expert Dwight L.
Morris.</TE>
<TE>   Frist has rejected suggestions that because of his investments he
recuse himself from health-care legislation. He has argued, instead,
that the Senate benefits from his expertise. The Senate Ethics
Committee ruled that he was not required to divest his health-related
holdings.</TE>
<TE>   But if Frist becomes majority leader, "he's going to get a level
of scrutiny that he's not used to," congressional scholar Norman
Ornstein said.</TE>
<TE>   And health issues could prove a minefield for him, Ornstein added.
"Any large for-profit health-care company is going to have lots of
things -- that cut costs, for example -- that people won't like," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Frist, one of five children, earned his bachelor's degree from
Princeton.</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of those students who would come up after class to
discuss things you had mentioned," recalled Uwe Reinhardt, a
Princeton University economist.</TE>
<TE>   "He always had a keen interest in policy and clearly was
interested in becoming a policymaker even in those days," Reinhardt
recalled Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Frist earned his medical degree from Harvard. As a student, he
adopted stray cats from Boston-area shelters -- and then dissected
them. He later confessed that it had been "a heinous and dishonest
thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Much of what is known about Frist's life before his 1994 election
to the Senate derives from his 1989 autobiography, "Transplant: A
Heart Surgeon's Account of the Life-and-Death Dramas of the New
Medicine."</TE>
<TE>   After postgraduate training at Stanford University, at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, and in the United Kingdom,
Frist returned to his native Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   There, he taught at Vanderbilt University and founded the school's
transplant center; he performed more than 200 organ transplants.</TE>
<TE>   Frist told an interviewer for the Hospitals &amp; Health Network that
he had not voted earlier in life because "I didn't realize ... how
significant the impact of an individual could be."</TE>
<TE>   In his bid for political office, Frist upset James R. Sasser, a
three-term Democratic incumbent, by a 14-percentage-point margin.
Frist spent $3.7 million of his own fortune campaigning.</TE>
<TE>   He arrived in Congress as a citizen-legislator, having vowed to
serve only two terms. That pledge now looms as a big question mark
over his political future because his second term ends in January
2007.</TE>
<TE>   "His pledge was unequivocal," said William Lyons, a political
science professor at the University of Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   But given his impending ascension to Senate majority leader, Frist
could probably get away with changing his mind without serious
consequences, Lyons said. "I think the people of Tennessee would not
hold him to that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, Frist quickly became a leader on health issues,
from prescription drug coverage and legislation protecting patients'
rights to anthrax and smallpox vaccinations.</TE>
<TE>   "He has proven to be very adept personally and a quick study,"
Lyons said. "He's somebody who's exceeded just about everybody's
expectations, and he continues to surprise people."</TE>
<TE>   But AIDS activists have criticized Frist for not fighting for more
funding to combat the disease. Consumer groups have chided him for
siding with a Bush-backed version of a patient's bill of rights that
would limit consumers' ability to sue providers.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Senate's moderate Republicans on Friday hailed
Frist's impending ascension, his voting record is quite consistently
conservative.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Frist -- like Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi --
received a failing record from the National Assn. for the Advancement
of Colored People on 37 key votes during the congressional session
that ended last month. He also voted against an amendment to make it
easier to investigate and prosecute hate crimes.</TE>
<TE>   His record is generally antiabortion, though he has made
exceptions for rape, incest and protecting the mother's life. But
some antiabortion activists say he does not go far enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Frist projects a moderate image, but he's very conservative," one
top Democratic Senate aide said.</TE>
<TE>   Frist also was criticized from the right on Friday. Paul M.
Weyrich, head of the Free Congress Foundation, described him as "not
somebody conservatives would be comfortable with."</TE>
<TE>   Frist, who keeps a white lab coat and an emergency doctor's bag in
his office, also has put his medical expertise to more immediate use.
On numerous occasions, he has provided emergency treatment to
colleagues and tourists alike.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Frist helped a heart attack victim who had collapsed in
the Dirksen Senate Office Building. Performing CPR, Frist was able to
restore the man's normal heart rhythm. The patient -- who turned out
to be a Tennessee voter -- survived.</TE>
<TE>   Frist is known for often getting by on just four or five hours of
sleep. Aides can recall countless e-mails from him that were composed
in the dead of night.</TE>
<TE>   Frist was quite chubby when he arrived in Washington. But he
quickly regained his fitness and in recent years has run half a dozen
marathons.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not fast, but he runs a long way," said Rep. Zach Wamp
(R-Tenn.). Wamp said Friday he will never forget a Frist speech at
the 2001 National Prayer Breakfast in which Frist spoke of holding in
his hands a beating heart and "the gift of life."</TE>

<HD>Perils of Foot-in-Mouth Disease</HD>
<DH>Surviving a gaffe in Washington, experts say, is a matter
of personal history, luck and timing -- none of which Lott had on his
side.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Faye Fiore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For some in political high places, foot-in-mouth disease causes a
raging fever for a few miserable days and then passes.</LD>
<LD>   For Mississippi Sen. Trent Lott, the question was when -- and how
-- his fate would be decided in a case that had consumed Washington's
talk show and Christmas party circuits. On Friday, after two long
weeks, the case proved terminal with Lott's announcement that he
would bow out as Senate GOP leader.</LD>
<LD>   He infected himself on Dec. 5 with seemingly racist birthday
salutations delivered at a party for an aged fellow Southern
Republican, and had struggled since then to hang on to the leadership
post.</LD>
<TE>   In truth, scads of public figures before Lott have made similarly
insensitive remarks. So what separates casualties from survivors? Is
there a political gene that enables some to apologize with dignity
and chagrin while others come off as pandering fools?</TE>
<TE>   The answer, experts say, is a combination of personal history,
luck and timing -- none of which went the besieged senator's way.</TE>
<TE>   There are lessons to be learned from the plight of Chester Trent
Lott. If you are going to make a gaffe in Washington:</TE>
<TE>   * Do not confirm people's worst suspicions about yourself.</TE>
<TE>   * Never compromise your president.</TE>
<TE>   * Never misspeak during a slow news week.</TE>
<TE>   * Mobilize your allies.</TE>
<TE>   * Apologize fast -- and with feeling.</TE>
<TE>   "A full-throated apology within a couple of days of the event and
we wouldn't be talking about this. People would say it's the
holidays, forget it; but his overconfidence and arrogance kept him
from doing what he needed to do," said Larry J. Sabato, a University
of Virginia professor and author of two books about political
scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Lott's troubles began when he asserted at a 100th birthday party
for Sen. Strom Thurmond that the country would have been better off
had the South Carolina Republican been elected president in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was that Thurmond was a segregationist in 1948. Lott
failed to immediately recant, and when he finally did, the incident
had grown its own political life, a dangerous development for a
powerful man who, it turns out, has more enemies in Washington than
friends.</TE>
<TE>   His party's leading conservatives called for his resignation as
leader, denouncing him as "thoughtless and careless ... ineffective
and clumsy." Perhaps worse, Democrats had started to defend him: "The
way his party is stabbing him in the back right now is pretty
savage," veteran Democratic Party strategist Paul Begala said before
Lott stepped down Friday.</TE>
<TE>   History books are filled with political bloopers, some that led to
early retirement, others that faded to mere footnotes.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most famous headstones in the graveyard of blown careers
is that of Earl Butz. Agriculture secretary under President Ford, he
made a racist remark so coarse newspapers wouldn't print it. Ford, in
the midst of a grueling reelection campaign, asked him to resign.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush neither openly abandoned Lott nor defended him. In
the coded language of Washington, that spelled trouble.</TE>
<TE>   The debacle was proving "politically very harmful for Bush," said
Stephen Hess, a scholar of the presidency at the Brookings
Institution, a centrist think tank in Washington. "He wants to move
ahead with his program in the Senate, he's just won a big election
and instead he's mired in this other battle."</TE>
<TE>   Whether a loose-tongued official survives his mistakes depends to
some degree on the mathematics of politics: Where does he fall in the
hierarchy of government and how many people did the remark offend?</TE>
<TE>   Take recently retired House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas),
who in 1995 referred to openly gay Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) as
"Barney Fag." The epithet provoked a storm of headlines but no
broad-based outrage, in part because the Republican base openly
considers homosexuality morally repugnant. Armey emerged undamaged.
(Lott, incidentally, weighed in at the time by equating homosexuals
with kleptomaniacs.)</TE>
<TE>   And when President Reagan's secretary of State, Alexander M. Haig
Jr., called Britain's foreign secretary a "duplicitous bastard" in a
staff meeting, he swiftly apologized and moved on unscathed. Few
people cared.</TE>
<TE>   But Lott's remark was perceived as racist, a third-rail issue for
a political party working hard to shed its image as civil rights
obstructionist. The senator's voting record made his mea culpa all
the harder to accept: He had opposed the creation of a Martin Luther
King Jr. holiday, voted against the extension of the Voting Rights
Act in 1982 and embraced Confederate President Jefferson Davis as
some sort of soul mate.</TE>
<TE>   His most recent words only served to confirm a mind-set a lot of
people already suspected.</TE>
<TE>   "If Trent Lott had a cadre of close friends and advisors in the
civil rights community he would have gotten a great deal of feedback
very fast. But he doesn't, so he didn't," said Jack Pitney, a
political scientist at Claremont McKenna College and a former
Republican National Committee operative.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't only in the civil rights community that Lott seemed to
lack allies. Most Washington insiders knew Lott's record on race and
lived with it. But when it became an albatross to their party, that
they could not abide.</TE>
<TE>   "If the charge is racism, I don't think he's guilty," Pitney said.
"But if the charge is being a political burden to his party, he's got
a big problem."</TE>
<TE>   The controversy left Lott standing virtually alone, giving courage
to ambitious rivals waiting in the wings.</TE>
<TE>   Lott's troubles are as much a function of timing as substance. He
misspoke during a Washington news vacuum, with the march to war in a
holding pattern and Congress idled by the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   But all other factors aside, Lott's single worst mistake may have
been his failure to deliver a prompt and heartfelt apology. The delay
gave the impression that he did not take the matter seriously, and
gave the story legs.</TE>
<TE>   When Lott ultimately made his fullest act of contrition, his
characteristic stiffness came off first as stilted and then as
desperate. While trying to establish himself as an ardent supporter
of equal rights, he only succeeded in alienating his party's
conservative base by embracing affirmative action across the board in
an interview on Black Entertainment Television.</TE>
<TE>   "His final step was a step too far -- he went overboard," Pitney
said. "The interviewer reminded me of Ward Cleaver giving the Beaver
a talking-to -- not a good image for a party leader."</TE>
<TE>   By then, there had been plenty of time for Washington's pot of
conflicting agendas to stew. Enemies looking for a reason to
challenge Lott finally had one. His party didn't need the baggage.
His president didn't want the distraction.</TE>
<TE>   "He should have groveled," Hess said. "Groveling has a very
important role in this city."</TE>

<HD>Astronaut Set to Take All of Israel Into Space With Him</HD>
<DH>Ilan Ramon is ready to become the first person from the
Jewish state to orbit Earth. He is proud of his heritage and will
carry a special drawing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John-Thor Dahlburg and Lianne Hart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>He is a coffee fiend, father of four and combat-tested fighter jock
with more than 4,000 hours in the air. Next month, if the countdown
goes as planned, Ilan Ramon will climb aboard a rocket and become the
first Israeli in space.</LD>
<LD>   On Jan. 16, the space shuttle Columbia is scheduled to blast off
from Kennedy Space Center carrying a seven-member crew, including
Ramon, a 48-year-old colonel in the Israeli air force. For the native
of Tel Aviv whose mother survived 1 1/2 years in the Auschwitz
concentration camp, it is a sobering honor.</LD>
<LD>   "Being the first Israeli astronaut -- I feel I am representing all
Jews and all Israelis," Ramon said. "The fact that I'm the son of a
Holocaust survivor -- I carry on the suffering the Holocaust
generation went through, and I'm kind of proof that even through all
the horror they went through, we're going forward."</LD>
<TE>   In Israel, the term "astronaut" has roughly been equivalent to
"space cadet" in American slang -- that is, someone out of touch with
the real world. But the 16 days the short-statured, extremely fit
Ramon will spend in orbit are expected to give the Jewish state a new
national hero, as well as a welcome respite from the usual dreary
litany of Middle Eastern news.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the first Israeli to win an Olympic medal," said Mark
Regev, spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in Washington, when asked to
gauge the level of interest back home in Ramon's flight. "I think all
Israelis are looking at Ramon. He is the first one of us to go up
there."</TE>
<TE>   The ongoing suicide bombings, shootings and other manifestations
of the Israeli-Palestinian struggle, plus the mounting likelihood of
a war in neighboring Iraq, "are precisely why this flight is big
news," Regev said. "It is the sort of thing Israelis will be able to
feel good about."</TE>
<TE>   The mission, originally scheduled for January 2000, has been
delayed several times, said Bruce Buckingham, a spokesman for Kennedy
Space Center. Ramon would become the second person from the Middle
East to travel on a U.S. spacecraft. A member of the Saudi royal
family, Prince Sultan Salman Abdul Aziz Al-Saud, flew on the space
shuttle Discovery in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Ramon, a former F-16 squadron commander and chief of
weapons-system development acquisition for the Israeli air force, has
been training since 1998 at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in
Houston, representing the Israel Space Agency.</TE>
<TE>   As a payload specialist, Ramon's main responsibility will be to
use a multispectral camera in space to track dust particles from the
sandstorms that blow from the Sahara over the Mediterranean and
Middle East. The study, designed by scientists at Tel Aviv
University, is intended to learn how the dust affects rainfall.</TE>
<TE>   It is a "scientific experiment," Ramon told reporters in Houston.
"It has nothing to do with the military or reconnaissance
operations."</TE>
<TE>   There have already have been a small number of Jewish astronauts,
including Judith Resnik, who died in the 1986 Challenger disaster.
But Ramon will be the first to adhere to Jewish dietary rules in
space, eating kosher meals in sealed, self-heating pouches
manufactured for the U.S. armed forces by an Illinois company.</TE>
<TE>   Though he said he isn't particularly religiously observant, Ramon
has also had to ponder issues worthy of a Talmudic scholar. How, for
example, to mark the Sabbath, which occurs every seven days and
begins at sunset on Friday? Since it takes 90 minutes for the shuttle
to orbit the earth, there arguably is a Sabbath every 10 1/2 hours in
space. After consulting with two rabbis, Ramon plans to recite a
kiddush on Friday evening, Houston time, if the mission permits.</TE>
<TE>   The prayer is traditionally said over a goblet of wine, but since
Ramon is not allowed to bring wine on the shuttle, and it isn't
practical to drink from a glass in a gravity-free environment, he
will have to improvise, perhaps with a pouch of grape juice.</TE>
<TE>   The five-man, two-woman crew of shuttle mission STS-107 was at
Cape Canaveral for a dress rehearsal this week, touring Kennedy Space
Center, boarding Columbia and conducting drills in emergency exit
procedures, NASA officials said. In the fall of 2001, the astronauts
took a nine-day, get-acquainted wilderness hike through the Wind
River Mountains of Wyoming, and Ramon's team spirit and
unflappability left a strong impression.</TE>
<TE>   "You learn a lot about people when you're tired and hungry and
carrying around a 60-pound pack for miles," said mission specialist
David M. Brown, a Navy captain who will be the crew's flight surgeon.
"He's a guy who now only carries his own share, but always looks for
an opportunity to do things for other folks."</TE>
<TE>   NASA beefed up security around shuttle launches after the Sept.
11terrorist attacks, reasoning that there was no higher-profile
target for anyone intending to strike at U.S. interests or prestige.
Agency officials refuse to say if the presence of an Israeli in
Columbia's crew has led to even greater measures to guard against any
attempted sabotage but express assurance that security is as tight as
it needs to be.</TE>
<TE>   "We have taken an enormous amount of security interest, as we do
with every single launch," NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe has said.</TE>
<TE>   To see him blast off, Ramon has invited friends and relatives, as
well as Ezer Weizman, a former president of Israel and one of the

Kippur War and the 1983 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and survived a
midair collision in which he ejected from his fighter jet.</TE>
<TE>   Shuttle crew members are allowed to carry a small bag of personal
items into space, and in his, Ramon will include a simple
black-and-white drawing borrowed from the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum
in Jerusalem. It is the haunting work of a 14-year-old boy from
Czechoslovakia, Petr Ginz, who died at Auschwitz in 1944. Ramon's
mother lived to be liberated by the Russians but other family members
perished in the Nazis' campaign against the Jews.</TE>
<TE>   "The picture is a drawing of Petr as he imagined himself looking
at Earth from the moon," Ramon said. "I really feel I'm taking his
imagination and fulfilling his wish of being there, of being his
eyes."</TE>

<HD>It's All in the Family in Alaska Politics</HD>
<DH>New Gov. Frank H. Murkowski names his daughter Lisa as his
successor to the U.S. Senate. She is seen as more moderate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Howe Verhovek</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Alaska's Frank H. Murkowski delivered an early Christmas present
Friday to his daughter Lisa, appointing her to the U.S. Senate seat
he vacated after being elected the state's governor last month.</LD>
<LD>   Lisa Murkowski, 45, a state representative from Anchorage who
recently had been elected House majority leader, was sworn in Friday
and will serve the remaining two years of her father's fourth term.
She is the first woman to serve as a U.S. senator in Alaska's 43
years of statehood.</LD>
<LD>   Her appointment does not change the balance of power in the
Senate, since she is a Republican like her father. And in a state
where Republicans generally dominate politics, reaction from party
members to the appointment was generally positive.</LD>
<TE>   Many Democrats, however, leapt all over the appointment and vowed
to mount a vigorous challenge to Lisa Murkowski's presumed run in
2004 for a full six-year term.</TE>
<TE>   "This is supposed to be a democracy, not a nepotistic monarchy,"
said Tammy Troyer, director of the Alaska Democratic Party, even as
she allowed that the appointment did amount to "a very nice gift from
a father to his daughter."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Murkowski said Friday that he had made his selection only
after an extensive search in which, he said, he considered 26 people
for the position and interviewed 11 of them.</TE>
<TE>   "I've reached out to Alaskans from all over the state," he said at
a news conference in Anchorage. "Above all, I felt the person I
appoint to the remaining two years of my term should be someone who
shares my basic philosophy, my values."</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Murkowski, a lawyer and mother of two, said she was "deeply
honored" by the appointment. "We have a great deal in common besides
sharing a name," she said of her 68-year-old father. "We share the
same vision for the state."</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats had a muted reaction to the news, making it
difficult to gauge just how much controversy the unusual appointment
will generate in the last frontier.</TE>
<TE>   The House minority leader, Democratic Rep. Ethan Berkowitz, said
of the new senator: "Lisa is a friend of mine and I wish her well.
This is one of the few times in my life that I will say no more than
that."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry McBeath, a political science professor at the University of
Alaska Fairbanks, predicted there would be "a big hoot and holler,
but then it will all blow over."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "She is a polished politician, she presents herself well
and she will be a far better senator for Alaska than her father ever
was. She is much more moderate, and in a three-person delegation,
that moderation can be very important.</TE>
<TE>   "And she is a woman senator coming out of Alaska," McBeath said.
"That is a new frontier."</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Murkowski is perceived in the state as more moderate than her
father on some issues.</TE>
<TE>   She has come out in favor of new taxes to help ease a budget
deficit aggravated by dwindling oil revenues in the state, while her
father ran for governor on a staunch anti-tax platform. Daughter and
father favor opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling
for oil.</TE>
<TE>   Among the people Gov. Murkowski considered for the job was state
Sen. Ben Stevens, son of Alaska's senior U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Murkowski, sworn in as governor this month, was able to name
his Senate successor only because of a state law enacted this year by
the Republican-controlled Legislature over the veto of then-Gov. Tony
Knowles, a Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   That law mandated a five-day waiting period for U.S. Senate
vacancies to be filled, thus allowing Frank Murkowski to resign from
the Senate, be sworn in as governor and then name the new senator.</TE>
<TE>   Knowles, who criticized the maneuver, is a leading contender for
the Democratic 2004 Senate nomination.</TE>

<HD>N.J. Governor Has a Rough First Year</HD>
<DH>Democrat James E. McGreevey is charged with wasting tax
dollars and being politically tone-deaf. He says he is 'learning,
growing.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TRENTON, N.J.</DL>
<LD>After getting elected on a promise to look out for the people's
money, Gov. James E. McGreevey has spent much of his first year
explaining away junkets, helicopter rides and a mysterious
$110,000-a-year aide.</LD>
<LD>   Even poetry has proved poor politics for the Democrat: He has been
accused of racism for trying to remove New Jersey's poet laureate
over a Sept. 11 memorial verse critics called anti-Semitic.</LD>
<LD>   "This administration seems to create their own problems and then
rather than solve them, try to cover them up," said Carl Golden, a
Republican political analyst. "They seem to want to grow another foot
so they can shoot that one too."</LD>
<TE>   McGreevey, 44, came within 1 percentage point of defeating Gov.
Christie Whitman in 1997, then came back four years later to win a
landslide victory over Republican Bret Schundler.</TE>
<TE>   He pledged to impose fiscal discipline, restore public trust in
government and end business as usual in Trenton. Among other things,
he called for bringing back the post of public advocate, whose job
was to fight for consumers against state government. He also faulted
Whitman for allowing political insiders to get contracts for the
state's electronic toll system and auto-emissions testing program.</TE>
<TE>   But things have soured since then.</TE>
<TE>   In one recent poll, only 37% of voters said they approve of the
way McGreevey operates as governor. When it came to issues such as
the budget, taxes, the economy and jobs, only one in three backed
him.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview this week, McGreevey said his biggest problem was
not understanding how complicated it is to get something done in
government.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a matter of learning, growing. The important thing is that
if you're going to do it, you're going to make mistakes, and that's
inevitable," McGreevey said. "The important thing is to learn from
those mistakes, to learn those lessons, and to move on. I've worked
to learn those lessons."</TE>
<TE>   McGreevey took office in January battling what he said was a
projected budget gap of $6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's choice to head the state police, Joseph Santiago,
quickly drew fire. Santiago resigned in October after a flurry of
criticism and news reports about bankruptcies and assault charges and
alleged organized crime ties. Santiago denied the mob allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, McGreevey was ducking complaints that his homeland
security advisor, Golan Cipel, was not qualified and that as an
Israeli he could not get the needed security clearances. Cipel
refused to speak to reporters and the administration withheld details
about his duties, even after McGreevey reassigned him to an
unspecified job with a $110,000 salary.</TE>
<TE>   Cipel has since left state government, but Amiri Baraka refuses to
go. He has rejected McGreevey's calls to resign as poet laureate. The
governor has pressed for legislation giving him the authority to fire
the poet, prompting activists to accuse him of racial insensitivity.</TE>
<TE>   In July, McGreevey headed to Ireland on what he called a trade
mission. Four months later, he admitted that taxpayers should not
have been stuck with the $70,000 tab for banquets, shows and stays in
boutique hotels.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks later, a newspaper reported that he made personal
trips in the State Police helicopter. McGreevey responded by saying
the Democratic State Committee would pay for 12 of the trips. The
administration refused to say where McGreevey flew.</TE>
<TE>   Rider University political scientist David Rebovich said
McGreevey's troubles might end if he relinquished some duties:
"McGreevey now needs someone to say that to him and he needs to
respect the advice of those people."</TE>

<SE></SE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Sen. Bill Frist has not always believed that being Senate majority
leader is a good idea.</LD>
<LD>   In 1994, when he made his first run for the Senate, the Tennessee
Republican attacked his opponent, Democratic Sen. James R. Sasser,
for seeking the leadership post.</LD>
<LD>   "Mr. Sasser's becoming majority leader means ... [he] has to put
the majority's interests before that of Tennesseans," Frist said
during a campaign debate.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, Frist spokesman Nick Smith said Frist believes he can
serve his state if he becomes majority leader.</TE>
<TE>   "Sen. Frist has been one of Tennessee's biggest advocates here in
Washington and will continue to do so throughout his career," Smith
said.</TE>
<TE>   During the same 1994 campaign, according to the Memphis Commercial
Appeal newspaper, Frist touched off a controversy by charging that
Sasser had voted to send Tennesseans' tax dollars "to Washington,
D.C., home of Marion Barry." Barry is black, and a former Washington
mayor who had been convicted of cocaine possession.</TE>
<TE>   Sasser supporters accused Frist of race-baiting, but Frist's
campaign denied the charge.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody takes that as a racial comment," Smith
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The legacy of Marion Barry was tarnished of his own doing."</TE>

<HD>Lott Still Popular Back Home</HD>
<DH>In Pascagoula, some are critical, but everyone fears what
his fall means for their economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lianne Hart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PASCAGOULA, Miss.</DL>
<LD>Mickey Baggett sees the signs of a local economy in decline every
day, in the televisions, VCRs and drum sets that residents of this
Gulf Coast town continually haul into his downtown pawnshop.</LD>
<LD>   "With Trent Lott stepping down, it's only going to get worse
here," said Baggett, 75. "I was shocked when I heard about his
decision."</LD>
<LD>   Lott's resignation Friday as the incoming Senate majority leader
over racially divisive comments has many in his hometown wondering
about their own futures. Love him or hate him, most here give Lott
credit for keeping Pascagoula's shaky economy afloat, mainly by
funneling government contracts to the Northrop Grumman shipyard on
the edge of town.</LD>
<TE>   "Pascagoula revolves around the shipyard; most people here depend
on it for their livelihood," said Earl Godwin, 53, who is white and
has worked as a sheet metal foreman for 32 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate that he stepped aside. This town will suffer because of
it."</TE>
<TE>   While Lott will remain in the Senate, residents feared the
Republican's political heft would be stripped along with his
leadership title.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle Anderson, a white 34-year-old homemaker who was born and
raised in Pascagoula, was blunt. "This town is going to go downhill,"
she said. "If people think the economy here was bad before, wait till
they see what happens without Trent looking out for us. This town
will be abandoned in a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Trent has done so much for south Mississippi. This whole thing is
just so stupid," added Anderson, waving her arms in distress. "If the
state of Mississippi doesn't decide to vote him out, he shouldn't
have to go."</TE>
<TE>   See this? she indicated, pointing to the American flag emblazoned
on her T-shirt. "I'm an American through and through, and it's
un-American that Trent was pushed out like that. He is not a bad man
whatsoever."</TE>
<TE>   At the Dixie Gas station, 33-year-old Thaddeus Fairley, a
maintenance man at the shipyard, said that Lott's decision was purely
political. "He didn't do it for the hard-working man," said Fairley,
who is black. "He did it because the other politicians didn't want to
be connected to him."</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone was ready to forgive Lott for comments made two
weeks ago that voiced support for the 1948 segregationist
presidential campaign of fellow GOP Sen. Strom Thurmond of South
Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   LaTresha Trotter, 42, who is black, teaches toddlers at a Head
Start program here. "Even 3- and 4-year-old children are taught to
think before they speak," said Trotter as she inspected Christmas
trees in a Wal-Mart parking lot. "Trent Lott should have done the
same thing."</TE>
<TE>   Emotions were running high at a downtown hair salon, where patrons
debated the Lott debacle with the stylists. "It was a drastic step,
but it was the right step," said Terrence Williams, 35, a black
accountant. "No one is going to look at him and respect him after
what he said."</TE>
<TE>   Lott "gave Mississippi a black eye," Williams added. "People
already think we're backward, that we don't wear shoes. But we do
wear shoes, and suits too. He put his foot in his mouth and made
Mississippi look bad."</TE>
<TE>   Lamont Parson, a 29-year-old auto engineer, at first declined to
join the discussion. "Let he who is without sin cast the first
stone," he intoned. But as the debate grew livelier, Parson couldn't
resist.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, he was trying to give the old man props, give Strom
Thurmond a little credit. The way Lott did it, well, that type of
thinking is rooted deep inside of him. That's how he was raised.</TE>
<TE>   "I wished he didn't step down," said Parson, who is black. "The
Republicans pushed him out because they didn't want to look bad. But
they already look bad, so why bother? Let the man keep his job. He
helps Mississippi."</TE>
<TE>   At that, Williams almost rose to his feet. "People say it's going
to be hard for Mississippi because we won't have a powerhouse like
him pushing for jobs here," he said. "But after what he said, it
would be hard for him to be effective in the future, so Mississippi
would have been hurt even if he stayed."</TE>
<TE>   Only last Sunday, Lott and his wife attended services at First
Baptist Church here, and the senator received a five-minute standing
ovation, said Baggett, who is white. "He knew we were behind him, and
we still are.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll still be our senator, just not as powerful as he was."</TE>

<HD>Lott's Fall Is Signaling a Shift From Old South to New
Breed</HD>
<DH>Senator's resignation as majority leader and the retirement
of Helms and Thurmond advance the Southern GOP's move to moderation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ken Ellingwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ATLANTA -- Strom Thurmond and Jesse Helms won't be back. Trent Lott
will, but not as Republican leader in the U.S. Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Lott's decision to relinquish the post marks another shift in the
look of GOP politics in the South, where an old guard of former
segregationists is giving way to a new breed of leaders, political
experts say. Lott, who was elected to Congress in 1972, the same year
as Helms, was among a group of former Democrats who cut their teeth
in the segregationist South and switched parties as the Republican
Party gained sway in the region.</LD>
<LD>   "You've got Thurmond and Helms leaving and Lott left neutered....
It's kind of a generational replacement of leadership," said Merle
Black, an expert on Southern politics at Emory University in Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   The Republicans have converted the South into a reliable base
since the 1960s, when the party capitalized on the resentment among
conservative rural whites, many of them raised as Democrats, toward
new federal civil rights measures. The so-called Southern strategy,
personified by politicians such as Lott, who began in politics as a
congressional aide to a segregationist Democrat, became a linchpin of
GOP campaigning nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   The new flock of Southern Republicans tends to be more moderate
and more likely to be concerned with the anxieties of the region's
swelling ranks of moderate suburbanites, who hold the critical swing
votes in modern campaigns in the South. While the votes of rural
white residents are still crucial to the GOP, there is also now
reason to appeal to the increasing rolls of voters who've moved from
other regions of the country and to a growing share of Latino and
Asian American voters.</TE>
<TE>   "The South has changed and a lot of people haven't been noticing
-- until you get to a defining moment like this and see a passing of
the torch," said Ralph Reed, chairman of the Republican Party in
Georgia. He said the GOP in the South has grown more inclusive.</TE>
<TE>   Lott's expected replacement as majority leader, Sen. Bill Frist of
Tennessee, reflects a shift in background. Though generally
conservative and a Southerner, Frist was schooled in the Ivy League
and entered politics in the 1990s, at age 42, after a successful
career as a surgeon. Unlike Lott, he has little connection to the
politics of the South's racially divided past, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "His background is medicine and business. It is not old-time,
segregationist politics," said Hastings Wyman, who publishes the
Southern Political Report, a biweekly newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   Observers said Frist embodies the "compassionate conservatism"
espoused by President Bush -- a philosophy favoring low taxes and
less government but more accommodating on social matters. "Frist is a
very different generation of politician," Black said. "Frist could go
anywhere in the country and be perceived as reasonable."</TE>
<TE>   Moderate Republicans did well in the South this year. Thurmond and
Helms will be replaced by successors viewed as less conservative.
Rep. Lindsey O. Graham takes the South Carolina seat that Thurmond
held since 1954. Elizabeth Hanford Dole, a former Cabinet member,
succeeds Helms in North Carolina. GOP moderates edged out
conservative primary opponents in gubernatorial contests in Alabama
and South Carolina, in a Senate race in Louisiana and two
congressional campaigns in Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Many are waiting to see whether the racial sensitivities raised
during the Lott episode will affect political contests in the South,
where Democrats have long accused the GOP of subtly using racial
antagonisms to garner white votes. Overt racial rhetoric disappeared
from Southern campaigns years ago, but emotions remain strong in
debates over racially tinged symbols, such as the Confederate battle
flag.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts said the widespread condemnation across racial lines
of Lott's apparent endorsement of the segregationist policies of
Thurmond's 1948 presidential campaign illustrated the possible
pitfalls of racial insensitivity. The controversy may have dealt a
severe blow to the efforts of Confederate flag supporters to restore
the emblem to its former prominent size on the Georgia state flag.</TE>
<TE>   The Lott case presents Southern Republicans with "a moment of
examination of conscience," said Ferrel Guillory, director of the
Program in Southern Politics, Media and Public Life at the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "Having built this party and having
succeeded, to what extent do they want to continue to be defined by
themes like states' rights, opposition to affirmative action? Or do
they generate a new agenda, even at the risk of alienating some
supporters?"</TE>
<TE>   He added: "The Republicans remain a strong political force in the
South. This is not Watergate. But it may influence the tone and
texture of political dialogue."</TE>
<TE>   One Democratic consultant remained skeptical. "Republicans, as
part of the Southern strategy, have danced with the devil," said Tim
Phillips, who managed the campaign of Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes, a
Democrat defeated in November. "This doesn't set new rules. It just
reminds us what the rules are."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Echoes of the Dixiecrat era</TE>
<TE>   Objecting to their party's civil rights program, a group of
Southern Democrats broke away to form the States' Rights Democrats in
1948. The right-wing splinter organization, labeled the "Dixiecrats"
by Bill Weisner of the Charlotte News, nominated South Carolina Gov.
Strom Thurmond for president and Mississippi Gov. Fielding Wright as
his running mate. The ticket carried South Carolina, Mississippi,
Louisiana and Alabama, receiving 39 electoral votes and more than 1
million popular votes. These quotes are from and about that era:</TE>
<TE>   "We stand for the segregation of the races and the racial
integrity of each race. ... We oppose and condemn the action of the
Democratic convention in sponsoring a civil rights program calling
for the elimination of segregation. ... We affirm that effective
enforcement of such a program would be utterly destructive of the
social, economic and political life of the Southern people."</TE>
<TE>   --Official platform of 1948, States' Rights Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to tell you that there's not enough troops in the Army to
force the Southern people to break down segregation and admit the
Negro race into our theaters, into our swimming pools, into our homes
and into our churches."</TE>
<TE>   --Thurmond, accepting the States' Rights party nomination for
president in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   "If the South should vote for Truman this year, we might just as
well petition the government to give us colonial status."</TE>
<TE>   --Thurmond, in his 1948 acceptance speech, commenting on the
decreasing power of Southerners within the Democratic Party.</TE>
<TE>   "Every American has lost part of his fundamental rights."</TE>
<TE>   --Thurmond, after the Supreme Court in 1948 threw out South
Carolina's white primary, decreeing that the party could not bar
blacks from voting.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the most astounding theories ever advanced is that the
federal government by passing a law can force the white people of the
South to accept into their businesses, their schools, their places of
amusement, and in other public places, those they do not want to
accept."</TE>
<TE>   --Thurmond, 1948.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, if we had elected this man 30 years ago, we wouldn't be
in the mess we are today."</TE>
<TE>   --Then-Rep. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   "I probably made some statements I do not agree with now."</TE>
<TE>   --Thurmond, in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to say this about my state: When Strom Thurmond ran for
president, we voted for him. We're proud of it. And if the rest of
the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these
problems over all these years, either."</TE>
<TE>   --Sen. Lott, Dec. 5, at Thurmond's 100th birthday party.</TE>

<HD>Risen From White Poverty, Lott Undone by White Politics</HD>
<DH>In his roots were born the ambition that made his career
and the remark that derailed it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Johanna Neuman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The son of a hard-drinking sharecropper from one of the most
historically segregationist of Mississippi's 82 counties, Chester
Trent Lott was always ambitious, always conservative, always
congenial.</LD>
<LD>   Like other famous sons of alcoholic fathers, such as Bill Clinton
and Ronald Reagan, he wanted to be liked. And so, from an early age,
he learned how to count -- amassing an impressive campus victory as
head cheerleader at the University of Mississippi, winning a
competitive primary for the House at the age of 30, besting Sen. Alan
Simpson of Wyoming by one vote in a gutsy run for Senate whip in
1995. Now 61, Lott is the only man in history to serve as the whip,
the chief vote-counter, in both the House and the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   But if his career was born in the hungry ambition of white
poverty, it crashed on the hard shoals of white politics. When Lott
tried, as he put it, "to flatter an old man" on his 100th birthday,
the core conviction of a childhood rearing in racism escaped his
lips. The code words that had sustained him in Mississippi politics
-- that the nation would have been better off if the segregationist
platform of Strom Thurmond's 1948 presidential campaign had prevailed
-- no longer played on a national stage.</LD>
<TE>   "Trent is a neo-Confederate," said Bill Minor, a longtime
columnist and observer of Mississippi politics. "He thought he was
talking to the good ol' yahoos down here. Suddenly he had a national
audience."</TE>
<TE>   To some it may seem awfully late in the nation's history to bury
states' rights. Jimmy Carter, on being sworn in as governor of
Georgia, declared an end to segregation in 1970. Time magazine put
his picture on its cover, trumpeting a new kind of Southerner.</TE>
<TE>   But Douglas Brinkley, a historian at the University of New
Orleans, thinks the political fall of Trent Lott more than 30 years
later is still a signal moment. "This is the last hurrah of the
prejudiced white Southerner," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Brinkley said, Republicans stoked white fears about
African Americans. "They didn't want to lose the Confederate vote,
and all it took was waving the flag," he said. Now, he said, a new
generation of conservatives will be scrutinized for prejudice. Call
it the Trent Lott test.</TE>
<TE>   It is not the political legacy he would have preferred. A
meticulously groomed man -- he irons his starched shirts when they
come back from the laundry and sprays his full head of hair for
tighter control -- Lott values order. Now he will be remembered for
creating chaos.</TE>
<TE>   An only child, Lott grew up negotiating between often-feuding
parents. "I was born to parents that had very meager means," he said
Monday night in one of the most revealing segments of his interview
on Black Entertainment Television. "My dad was a sharecropper. He
raised cotton on somebody else's land. My mother did teach school in
a three-room schoolhouse. When they came to Pascagoula my dad worked
the shipyard. And so, you know, there was a society then that was
wrong and wicked. I didn't create it, and I didn't even really
understand it."</TE>
<TE>   He was born in Carroll County, one of the counties most feared by
civil rights leaders trying to register blacks to vote in the 1960s.
His uncle, Arnie Watson, was an early influence. A local leader of
the White Citizens Council -- the businessman's version of the Ku
Klux Klan -- he was a teacher who preached segregation.</TE>
<TE>   As late as the 1980s, Minor recalled, when Carroll County
dedicated a library, Watson suggested the audience recite the pledges
of allegiance to the United States and to the Confederacy. And
Friday, after Lott announced that he was bowing out as Republican
leader but retaining his Senate seat, the Council of Conservative
Citizens -- a holdover segregationist group active in Carroll as in
few other counties in Mississippi -- still posted two items of note
on its Web site. One was the Confederate battle flag. The other was a
headline about the Lott controversy that said, "Sucker Punched."</TE>
<TE>   Lott's struggling family moved to Pascagoula, where the father
worked in the shipyards and the son soaked up the local culture.
Mississippi's Gulf Coast was largely white territory, unlike the
Delta, where so much of Mississippi's black history and music is
centered. In Pascagoula, Lott saw the mansion of Jefferson Davis,
president of the Confederacy, a man he would later in public life
praise. He played tuba in the band, sang in the Baptist church choir,
was voted Most Likely to Succeed of the class of 1959.</TE>
<TE>   Lott does not remember his childhood unkindly, and in fact
bristles at comparison to Clinton's similar experiences in Arkansas.
"I'd like to think that my family was not quite as dysfunctional as
his," he once told an interviewer. He called his mother "opinionated"
(Iona Watson Lott once wrote a letter to a local editor who
editorialized in favor of integration, saying she hoped "you not only
get a hole through your office door but through your stupid head.")
and his father a "little bit of a happy-go-lucky guy." After Lott
left for college, the couple divorced, and his father died in 1969 in
an automobile accident linked to drinking. "It's not a sad story of
oppression," Lott said. "It's not something I go home and brood
about."</TE>
<TE>   He remembers fondly all the talk of politics on the family's front
porch. His grandfather was a county commissioner in northern
Mississippi, and he loved to eavesdrop on the shop talk. "Grandpa
would sit in his rocker and the boys [Trent's father and uncles]
would sit on chairs around him on the steps and they'd talk," Lott
told the Baltimore Sun in a 1997 interview. "I used to get up under
the edge of the porch and listen. I thought it was a wonderful event.
I loved to hear them."</TE>
<TE>   He took his first electoral steps at Ole Miss, launching a
campaign -- complete with banners, calling cards, a campaign manager
and even a musical group -- that made him the top vote-getter. In a
school and a state where football was second only to church as a
revered weekend activity, he was the head cheerleader.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most remarkable chapter of Lott's career at Ole Miss
came during his senior year. He was president of the Sigma Nu
fraternity when James Meredith became the first black student to
enroll at the university. With federal marshals guarding Meredith,
riots broke out, cars burned, tear gas flared. In the melee, two
people were shot dead and 150 were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Lott did not believe that the federal government should dictate
integrationist policy to Mississippi. But he saw his role that night
not as blocking Meredith's admission but as protecting his frat
brothers. He took to the phones, rounded up his members, got them
home unscathed. It was a model for his later years as House and
Senate leader. Until recently, he made no apology for his ideology.
He saw his role as a pragmatist.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, some Senate colleagues grumbled that Lott was not
ideological enough, that he compromised too easily -- letting a
treaty banning chemical weapons come to the floor where, to the anger
of conservatives, it passed; agreeing to a 1998 budget deal that
escalated federal spending, something conservatives opposed. The
grumbling grew louder still in 2001, when Sen. James M. Jeffords of
Vermont defected from the Republican Party, becoming an independent
and costing the GOP its hold on the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Lott said at the time that he learned from his mistakes. That he
had not was evident at Thurmond's birthday party on Dec. 5. Lott
watchers note that he had provoked controversy by his warm embrace of
the Council of Conservative Citizens. He should have been on notice,
they believe.</TE>
<TE>   To many in Mississippi, the national furor over Lott's remarks was
itself instructive. "It wasn't a surprise to us that Trent Lott had
these ideological leanings," said Leslie McLemore, a political
scientist at Jackson State University. "We just never figured he
would utter them nationally."</TE>
<TE>   Wilbur Colom, a black Republican attorney in Columbus, Miss., was
philosophical. "He always made those harsh remarks," he said. "I
guess he just rose too high to get away with it."</TE>

<HD>Tribe Dealt Legal Setback on Whaling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court ruled Friday that the Makah Tribe could not
resume gray whale hunts, agreeing with whaling opponents who argued
that the government must further study the hunt's impact.</LD>
<LD>   A U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel in San Francisco
rejected as inadequate a federal environmental assessment showing the
hunt caused no significant impact. The court said the assessment did
not adequately determine the hunt's effect on the local whale
population and the precedent the hunt could set in other areas.</LD>
<LD>   Questions remain "as to whether the tribe's whaling plans will
have a significant effect on the environment," said Judge Marsha S.
Berzon, writing for the panel.</LD>
<TE>   Overturning a lower court, the panel ordered the National Marine
Fisheries Service to create an environmental impact statement, which
is more extensive than an environmental assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "We are extremely excited about the court's decision," said
Michael Markarian, president of the Fund for Animals.</TE>
<TE>   A lawsuit filed by the New York-based group, the Washington-based
Humane Society of the United States and others contends that Makah
whaling would endanger public safety and harm gray whales that linger
in Washington's Strait of Juan de Fuca.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of the population migrates between Alaska and Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, we're disappointed," Fisheries Service spokesman Brian
Gorman said.</TE>
<TE>   But he added that the agency probably would heed the court's
order.</TE>
<TE>   The tribe's lawyer, John Arum, said Friday he had not read the
court's opinion and could not comment. Calls to the Makah tribal
chairman were not immediately returned.</TE>
<TE>   Makah whaling rights are guaranteed by an 1855 treaty.</TE>
<TE>   After a seven-decade break, the tribe resumed whaling after gray
whales were removed from the Endangered Species List in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the tribe has killed just one whale, in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the International Whaling Commission authorized the tribe
to continue whaling, allowing a harvest of as many as four gray
whales annually for five years.</TE>

<LD>NASA's Galileo spacecraft has begun transmitting data again after
strong radiation near Jupiter had left its tape recorder inoperable
for weeks. Galileo's flight team traced the problem to a
light-emitting diode and completed a long-distance repair job.</LD>
<LD>   "We hope this will be the best data set that's ever been collected
about the inner region of Jupiter's magnetic environment," said Dr.
Torrence Johnson, Galileo project scientist at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.</LD>

<LD>The discovery of molecules that instantly shut off genes was the top
science story of the year, according to Science magazine.</LD>
<LD>   The molecular switches, called small interfering RNAs or siRNAs,
have the potential to treat such diseases as HIV and cancer.
Runners-up for top discovery were a measurement of the mass of
neutrinos; the complete genome of the parasite that causes malaria;
cameras that take pictures in a billionth of a billionth of a second;
and the finding of a 7-million-year-old skeleton in Africa that may
be the oldest human ancestor.</LD>

<LD>U.S. greenhouse gas emissions linked to global warming fell by 1.2%
last year, the largest decrease in a decade, due in part to slow
economic growth and a milder winter, the government said.</LD>

annual growth rate in U.S. emissions from 1990 to 2000, according to

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A tiny, late-blooming galaxy -- a distorted clump of gas and stars
whose development lags far behind its galactic cousins -- has been
captured in new Hubble Space Telescope images.</LD>
<LD>   Known as POX 186, the infant galaxy probably formed when two
smaller cosmic clumps collided to create a burst of stars less than
100 million years ago, the Space Telescope Science Institute said in
a statement. Most larger galaxies are thought to have formed most of
their stars billions of years ago.</LD>
<LD>   POX 186 is minuscule, only 900 light-years across. By contrast,
the Milky Way is about 100,000 light-years across.</LD>
<TE>   Hubble's pictures of POX 186 support theories that all galaxies
were put together from smaller "building blocks" of gas and stars
that formed soon after the theoretical Big Bang, the cosmic explosion
many astronomers believe gave birth to the universe.</TE>

<HD>Apology in a Stem Cell Feud</HD>
<DH>Stanford retracts statement viewed as suggesting
presidential panel backs cloning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stanford University this week issued an apology and corrected a
written statement after the chairman of President Bush's bioethics
council said the school had mischaracterized the council's views on
human cloning.</LD>
<LD>   Stanford has said its new cancer institute may try to produce
human embryonic stem cells using nuclear transfer techniques -- work
that many consider to be a type of human cloning. But Stanford said
characterizing the method as cloning is wrong because its goal would
be to produce stem cells, not cloned children.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement posted on the university's Web site last week,
Stanford said the President's Council on Bioethics supported its view
-- and its research strategy.</LD>
<TE>   But the council demanded a correction, saying it does not endorse
cloning for biomedical research and that Stanford had tried to
"obfuscate" the nature of its potential experiments. Stanford changed
its statement Wednesday, deleting all references to the council.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Irving Weissman, the Stanford institute's director, was out of
the country and couldn't be reached for comment, a university
spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Stem cells are created in the first days of pregnancy and give
rise to the human body. Scientists hope to someday direct stem cells
to grow into replacement organs and tissues to treat a wide range of
diseases.</TE>
<TE>   But to harvest stem cells, researchers must destroy days-old
embryos -- a procedure condemned by the Roman Catholic Church, Bush
and some antiabortion activists and women's rights organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The chairman of the President's Council on Bioethics, Dr. Leon
Kass of the University of Chicago, said it is unfortunate that
Stanford and Weissman have clouded the ongoing debate over stem cells
by disputing that their work could result in cloned human embryos.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has banned federal funding of new embryonic stem cell
programs. Stanford's research will be privately funded.</TE>
<TE>   Most stem cell researchers get unwanted embryos donated by
fertility clinics. Some researchers see a big scientific benefit in
developing new sources of genetically identical stem cells using
nuclear transfer.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a forecast of methane rain, astronomers have captured the first
images of clouds on Titan, which confirms suggestions that the
distant moon of Saturn has summer storms like those on Earth.</LD>
<LD>   The vast, glowing clouds, most likely formed of methane rather
than water vapor, drift high in Titan's cold, smoggy atmosphere near
the moon's south pole. They were discovered by Caltech planetary
astronomer Michael Brown and his colleagues at UC Berkeley using the
W.M. Keck II 10-meter and Gemini North 8-meter telescopes atop Mauna
Kea in Hawaii.</LD>
<LD>   "I am looking out my office window now and seeing clouds. They are
white," Brown said. "The clouds on Titan look the same."</LD>
<TE>   The clouds came as something of a surprise because previous images
of Titan had revealed only unchanging surface markings and very
gradual seasonal changes in the haze, making the moon look "like L.A.
on a bad day," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   But since December 2001, the clouds have been visible almost every
night, invariably as a single large plume almost always in the same
general area of the south pole.</TE>

<HD>City's Care of Art Collection Criticized</HD>
<DH>Little of it is insured and much of it is languishing in
City Hall basement, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of Los Angeles has at least $2 million worth of artwork that
is not insured, including hundreds of pieces that are in storage
without proper humidity and temperature controls, officials said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Some city leaders said Los Angeles should take steps to do a
better job of preserving and protecting the artwork, much of which
was given to the city during the last century.</LD>
<LD>   "To me this is a very unfortunate situation," said City Controller
Laura Chick. "If we are not going to display them or preserve them,
then we are just wasting them."</LD>
<TE>   The problems were identified in a study completed by the Cultural
Affairs Department two years ago after embarrassed city officials
admitted that they did not know how many artworks were owned by the
city and where they were.</TE>
<TE>   An inventory released this week identified 2,300 objects in the
city art collection. About 15% of the collection has been appraised
and found to have a fair market value of $2.1 million and a
replacement value of $3.1 million. Nearly all of it was found to be
uninsured, and city officials warn that as appraisals continue the
value of uninsured artwork will go up.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that about 600 of the artworks, mostly paintings,
drawings and photographs, are stored in a room in the basement of
City Hall without climate control.</TE>
<TE>   "The area is quite humid and warm," the report says. "Fluctuations
in heat and humidity outside of acceptable standards are serious and
can cause warping, mold, cracking, flaking and other major damage to
artwork, which is already evident due to a past history of improper
storage conditions."</TE>
<TE>   The estimate to install climate control equipment and other
protective measures is about $65,000, said Felicia Filer, director of
public art for the Cultural Affairs Department.</TE>
<TE>   The department also found that the city holds fine art insurance
for some of the collection being displayed in city buildings, but
that several expensive works are not covered by private insurance.</TE>
<TE>   The uninsured art includes bronze and stone busts and statues in
Lincoln Park that are estimated to have a market value of $1.4
million.</TE>
<TE>   There is also no private insurance coverage for artwork with a
fair market value of $565,000 in storage at City Hall and in leased
offices on Spring Street, the study found.</TE>
<TE>   An insurance firm has offered a blanket policy, but Filer said the
council may wait until all the appraisals are done in June before
deciding whether to buy insurance or continue with what she described
as a self-insurance mode.</TE>
<TE>   Appraisals so far have found a mixed bag of valuable and not so
valuable work in the city's collection. A Gustave Dore painting was
appraised as having a fair market value of $70,000 but a replacement
value of twice that. The city's 34 portraits of mayors are worth a
total of $40,500, and 24 Edmund Teske photographs are worth $54,900.</TE>
<TE>   The report will go to the City Council next month for
consideration.</TE>

<HD>Avila's Trial Put Off Until January 2004</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The capital murder trial of a Lake Elsinore man accused of kidnapping
and killing 5-year-old Samantha Runnion was put off until January
2004 after a judge Friday agreed that defense attorneys needed more
time to review the evidence.</LD>
<LD>   Over the objections of Orange County prosecutors, Judge William R.
Froeberg ordered the trial of Alejandro Avila to begin Jan. 12, 2004.
"My primary goal is to try a case one time and one time only,"
Froeberg said.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant Public Defender Denise Gragg argued that the defense
needed 18 months to review more than 13,000 pages of documents, DNA
evidence, cell phone records and hundreds of tips.</LD>
<TE>   Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas said he was disappointed
at the decision, but that he understood the judge's reasoning.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha was kidnapped July 15 as she played with a friend outside
her Stanton condominium complex.</TE>

<HD>City Council OKs Phasing Out Community Development Bank</HD>
<DH>Agency, conceived after the 1992 riots, was plagued by
mistakes and risky loans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lee Romney</AU>
<BD>Los Angeles Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The City Council approved a plan Friday to phase the troubled Los
Angeles Community Development Bank out of existence, while granting
the bank access to $1.4 million to keep it operating for the next six
months.</LD>
<LD>   More than a third of that is slated for Zone Ventures, a venture
capital firm that has already received a controversial $29 million in
investments from the federally funded bank. A recent federal audit
labeled that use of public funds questionable and said the risky
program to invest in high-tech start-ups had done almost nothing to
help the low-income residents that the bank was designed to serve.</LD>
<LD>   The bank was created after the 1992 riots to revitalize Central,
East and South Los Angeles and Pacoima. The bank is funded by grants
and loans from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
and is overseen by the city. If the bank defaults on its loans, the
city could lose millions of dollars in future federal grants.</LD>
<TE>   Risky loans and early mistakes have plagued the bank, and the City
Council had directed it to phase out operations in the next 18
months. On Friday, the council approved six more months of funding to
allow the bank to carry out its transition plan.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the bank will attempt to contract out
management of its loan portfolio or sell it altogether. The bank is
also looking for investors to take over its partnership with Zone
Ventures, pay the firm's hefty management fees and make additional
investments in those high-tech firms that have survived the
recession.</TE>
<TE>   The bank must report on its progress and request more funding in
six months.</TE>
<TE>   The recent audit, by HUD's office of inspector general, found that
the bank had fallen short on its mandate to spend most of its $430
million in the designated Empowerment Zone and create jobs for
residents. The venture capital program was largely to blame. Of 505
jobs created by the high-tech companies, only four had gone to
Empowerment Zone residents, the audit found, and most of the
companies hadn't located in the core zone.</TE>
<TE>   The bank entered into the partnership with Zone Ventures, the Los
Angeles arm of Silicon Valley-based Draper Fisher Jurvetson, at the
height of the dot-com boom. While some bank officials acknowledged
that the high-tech firms weren't likely to create jobs for low-income
residents, the bank hoped to cash in when the companies went public.
The scheme backfired when the market soured.</TE>
<TE>   While the audit said Zone Ventures had not met the terms of its
agreement with the bank and never intended to create jobs for
Empowerment Zone residents, Zone Ventures' managing partner, Frank
Creer, disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have done exactly what we told the bank we would do,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>Yearly Counting Ritual Brings Out the Birders</HD>
<DH>Aficionados flock to Orange County fringes for Audubon
Society's Christmas count.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Picnickers at Irvine Regional Park last weekend were treated to a
curious sight: four fine specimens of that subspecies known as
"birders" peering skyward for the first Sunday of the National
Audubon Society's annual Christmas Bird Count.</LD>
<LD>   Hikers, mountain bikers and horseback riders -- the usual winter
weekend warriors in Southern California's national forest and
regional parks -- are being joined for a few Sundays this month by
bands of birders, recognizable by their often drab chest covering,
bright headgear, and sturdy, waterproof shoes.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday at the park in northeastern Orange County, 64-year-old
Curtis Johnson, in his faded military camouflage hat festooned with
pins from birding trips around the world, was making the "psh-psh"
call favored by avian aficionados.</LD>
<TE>   With him were Paul Klahr, 71, of Laguna Woods, a flash of teal
turtleneck showing under his black pullover, and Jason Bock, 54, of
Brea, hopping excitedly with field guide in hand, ready to record a
sighting.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Boyd had come too. Bleary and unshaven, the 51-year-old from
Long Beach protested he'd given up birding since yuppies took over --
until a wing flap or a caw caught his ear, then his binoculars swung
up by reflex.</TE>
<TE>   This is a man who's had his car stolen from a South Texas bird
sanctuary parking lot, who has missed Christmas dinner while
attempting a personal best bird count, a man who can lay claim to
having been the first birder to spot the rare field sparrow in
mainland California. Other birders treat Boyd with awe and affection.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen him call birds in from the sky like magic," Bock said.
"They come right to him."</TE>
<TE>   The men had gathered to engage in an annual ritual that began more
than a century ago, on Christmas Day, 1900, when 27 conservationists
in 25 U.S. localities started an alternative to holiday hunting
practice.</TE>
<TE>   In the "side hunt," as it was known, teams competed to see who
could shoot the most birds and small animals.</TE>
<TE>   Ornithologists decided to count the birds they saw instead,
unwittingly creating one of the enduring citizen-based conservation
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Since that day, birders across the United States have mixed among
their Christmas turkeys and other holiday trimmings an outdoor
excursion to list all the birds they can see in a 24-hour period
within a 15-mile radius.</TE>
<TE>   Those circles now stretch from Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, to
Tierra del Fuego in South America. And the "Christmas" Bird Count now
occurs in any 24-hour window between mid-December and early January.</TE>
<TE>   More than 56,000 observers participated in nearly 2,000 circles
last year.</TE>
<TE>   One of the Golden State's hot spots, surprisingly, is Orange
County. It ranks near the top of bird-watching lists nationally and
statewide, although development in formerly remote areas has led to
the elimination of numerous species.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't seen a common murre in years," Johnson, a retired
automotive cost analyst from La Palma, said mournfully.</TE>
<TE>   Still, with Newport Bay, Bolsa Chica and Huntington Beach wetlands
along the coast, and the relatively undisturbed northern portions of
the Irvine Ranch abutting the Cleveland National Forest in the Santa
Ana Mountains, more than 300 species usually are recorded in Orange
County each year.</TE>
<TE>   The quartet at Irvine Regional Park, near the remnant rural edge
of Orange County, were men with lifelong bird species counts of 500
and more. They earned those counts the old-fashioned way -- on foot
-- not from fancy helicopters with high-powered telescopes.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, 64, has been doing Christmas counts for half a century,
since he was a boy in Pennsylvania. He holds the coveted title of
compiler, the one who gathers the hand tallies and assembles Orange
County's master list to be submitted to the national organization by
Jan. 5.</TE>
<TE>   It will be merged with numbers from Belize to Bakersfield and
Boston. The data are published and used by scientists who study bird
population trends throughout the Western Hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   Up before dawn, Orange County's birders spent Sunday in the inland
areas, traipsing remote boulder-filled canyons and ducking barbecuing
suburbanites, in search of everything from wrentits to golden eagles.</TE>
<TE>   Conversation with the birders was a fluttery affair, punctuated by
cries of "Oh, here come the robins!" and the sudden upsweep of
binoculars to eyeglasses, the intent, long stare, and the satisfied
murmurs of a positive identification.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a fox sparrow. That's our best of the day," said Victor
Leipzig quietly, pointing to a brown and white blob perched on a
toyon sugar bush halfway up the steep flanks of Harding Canyon, deep
in the Cleveland forest.</TE>
<TE>   A minute later, a squishy burbling followed by serious thrashing
of dry leaves erupted in a smaller bush.</TE>
<TE>   "Sounds like a whoopee cushion," said Mary Joseph, 56, of Fountain
Valley, who was on her first bird count.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd describe it as an unmusical squawk," said Leipzig, 54, a
longtime biology professor from Huntington Beach. "That's a spotted
towhee, and it's a very unattractive sound for such a pretty little
bird."</TE>
<TE>   They stood still for several minutes, as the sun broke through on
the rumpled, chaparral green hills, and the air filled with a
symphony -- or cacophony, depending on your point of view -- of
birdsong.</TE>
<TE>   Yellow rumped warblers divebombed, their calls growing louder the
faster they flew. A western scrub jay emitted chainsaw-like
screeches.</TE>
<TE>   An impossibly tiny Anna's hummingbird pirouetted past a high tree
branch, its wings whirring. Far overhead, a raven floated silently
by. Joseph recorded them neatly in pencil on her improvised clipboard
-- a square of corrugated cardboard with a sheet of paper secured by
a rubber band.</TE>
<TE>   From a tangle of tree and brush came the unmistakable tap-tap of a
woodpecker. They'd seen plenty of acorn woodpeckers already on the
road, but this one might be a rarer Lewis' woodpecker. There was no
way to tell for sure, though, unless they saw it.</TE>
<TE>   For several minutes they loitered, but the bird had ceased its
labors. No luck up the creek either, where Leipzig searched in vain
for a rare canyon wren in a rock face above clear running water.</TE>
<TE>   They did, however, spot five species of owls before dawn,
including the shy long-eared owl, which looks like it got caught in a
funhouse mirror, its head and ears oddly long and skinny.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson shook his head sadly as the day's counting ended. Sunday's
numbers were down from last year -- way down.</TE>
<TE>   "Too many people, and not enough rain; way too many people," he
groused, pointing with his chin to new homes packed tightly on a
ridge visible across the park.</TE>
<TE>   "It's incredibly depressing," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   But he'll be back out with the others this weekend for the coastal
count, ignoring the honking cars on busy Pacific Coast Highway,
savoring the wheeling gulls and swooping pelicans.</TE>

<HD>Cedars-Sinai to Challenge Union Vote</HD>
<DH>The filing of objections with the National Labor Relations
Board over 'misconduct' in nurses' election could delay certification
of vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein and Peter Y. Hong</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center said Friday that it will challenge a vote
by its 1,500 registered nurses to join a labor union.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at Cedars-Sinai, the largest private hospital in the
West, accused the California Nurses Assn. of intimidation, property
damage and "interference with the right to vote." Last week, the
nurses voted in favor of union representation, 695 to 627.</LD>
<LD>   The filing of objections with the National Labor Relations Board
could delay the certification of the election by weeks or months,
both sides said.</LD>
<TE>   "There are rules set forth in the election that both parties need
to abide by -- and that includes the CNA," said Jeanne Flores, the
hospital's senior vice president for human resources.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that we believe that there was misconduct, we have
a right and a duty to our nurses to raise the issue and let the NLRB
decide."</TE>
<TE>   Flores refused to disclose examples of misconduct, saying, "We do
have specifics, but we prefer to raise those with the NLRB in the
legal process."</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the California Nurses Assn. called the hospital's
allegations baseless and outrageous. If anything, they said, the
labor board should sanction Cedars-Sinai for its conduct during the
election.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, they're trying to win through legal maneuvering what
they failed to win at the ballot box," said Rose Ann DeMoro,
executive director of the union, which represents more than 45,000
nurses in the state.</TE>
<TE>   "They invested so much money into this anti-union campaign that I
imagine they're embarrassed, and they're looking for some way to save
face."</TE>
<TE>   DeMoro added: "They ran a vile, vicious campaign against the
nurses."</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers and actors rallied to the union's side during the nasty
union battle. They accused Cedars-Sinai of misrepresenting the
union's positions and forcing nurses to attend anti-union meetings.
Several pro-union nurses also said that they were threatened with
retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   Some labor advocates contend that, by aggressively opposing the
union campaign, Cedars-Sinai is betraying, not only workers, but its
own heritage as a Jewish institution born a century ago on the
Eastside.</TE>
<TE>   "The Star of David is not there by accident," said Assemblyman
Paul Koretz (D-West Hollywood), referring to the symbol of Judaism
atop the hospital's main building.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always hoped Cedars-Sinai would reflect positive Jewish
values. I'm so disappointed," he said, referring to allegations by
pro-union nurses of heavy-handed anti-union tactics by hospital
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas M. Priselac, Cedars-Sinai's president and chief executive,
has said the lawmakers and actors made such statements based on
misinformation.</TE>
<TE>   Priselac also rejected assertions that the hospital had breached
Jewish values. "My impression is that the Jewish community has a
diversity of opinions about matters related to unions, as is true in
the community in general," he said earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital industry officials say facilities like Cedars-Sinai
prefer to work directly with their employees, without a union set on
increasing its ranks.</TE>
<TE>   A union "really complicates a lot of situations, and it really
handcuffs the hospital in terms of being more creative and in terms
of being able to deal directly with their employees," said Jan
Emerson, a spokeswoman for the California Healthcare Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Long before it became the hospital for the stars, with towering
buildings named for Max Factor and George Burns, the hospital was an
institution for the city's working poor, many of whom were Jewish.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital began in 1902 as Kaspare Cohn Hospital, named for a
financier who made an early fortune lending money to Basque
sheepherders in Los Angeles and who would later found Union Bank, the
leading bank in the city's garment district. In 1910, it moved from
Echo Park to East Los Angeles, on what is now Whittier Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   In 1929, the hospital changed its name to Cedars of Lebanon. The
same year, Mt. Sinai Home for the Chronic Invalids, which would later
merge to create Cedars-Sinai, was established in East Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   A bustling community of immigrant Jewish workers relied on Cedars
of Lebanon's clinic, which offered care free or for 10 cents. Many of
them also did what they could to contribute to the hospitals. Both
Cedars of Lebanon and Mt. Sinai hospitals benefited from fund-raising
by groups such as the Workmen's Circle, or Arbeter Ring, a leftist
community service group.</TE>
<TE>   "Those institutions welcomed support from mass organizations such
as the Workmen's Circle," Eric A. Gordon, director of the Workmen's
Circle Southern California district, said of hospitals like the
forerunners to Cedars-Sinai. With that history, "it's kind of
embarrassing for any Jewish place to be fighting unions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cedars-Sinai officials disagreed. "There has been an implication
that the fact that we simply campaigned has been somehow
anti-democratic, and I don't think that's at all true," Flores said.
"We are in favor of a free and fair election, and of allowing our
employees to make the decision for themselves."</TE>

<HD>O.C. Keeps Plans for Special Election</HD>
<DH>Although judge warns he might void measure that allows the
vote, Board of Supervisors moves ahead with spending plan.</DH>

<LD>Orange County supervisors on Friday decided to go ahead with a Jan.
28 special election to fill a vacancy on the board even though a
judge has warned he might cancel the vote.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors, after an emergency closed-door meeting, said they are
willing to spend the money -- at least $270,000 -- preparing for an
election that may not be held rather than postpone the vote until
legal questions are resolved.</LD>
<LD>   The decision comes a day after a judge said that a ballot measure
that made the election possible was seriously flawed and that he
might find it unconstitutional. Measure V allowed voters -- rather
than the governor -- to fill vacant supervisorial seats. If the
measure is tossed out, Gov. Gray Davis could appoint a new
supervisor. Five candidates are competing for the District 3 seat.</LD>
<TE>   "We abided by the will of the people," said Supervisor Tom Wilson.
"If the judge wants to go against what the people have put in place,
that will be his decision to make."</TE>
<TE>   Added board Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad: "Obviously, the voters
wanted it to happen, so we don't really have a choice."</TE>
<TE>   A few speakers who attended a public meeting held before the
closed-door session urged supervisors to delay the election, calling
it a waste of money until the judge makes his final ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm outraged that this board would be so cavalier with the
taxpayers' money," said David Thompson of Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unconscionable you would spend hundreds of thousands of
taxpayers' dollars on an election that might not count."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Deputy Sheriff Thomas Dominguez added: "$200,000 is
a ... lot of money.... A simple delay of the election would avoid
risk to the taxpayer."</TE>
<TE>   The election will replace former Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who
resigned last month after being elected to the California Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer, a Republican, proposed Measure V with one thing in mind:
To prevent Gov. Davis, a Democrat, from appointing his successor.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer on Friday praised the supervisors' stance. "We need to
fill the vacancy on the Board of Supervisors," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The people have a right to be represented."</TE>
<TE>   Measure V, approved by voters in March, established a county
charter.</TE>
<TE>   The charter's single provision calls for elections to fill vacant
board seats. In all other areas, the charter carries over state laws
and regulations.</TE>
<TE>   The county expects to spend the first $60,000 Monday to print
ballot materials.</TE>

<HD>CRA Chief May Stay on Payroll</HD>
<DH>In what critics call an 'inside deal,' departing head would
be allowed an $18,000 city pension.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Jerry Scharlin scheduled to step down as head of the Los Angeles
redevelopment agency in January, its board agreed Friday to keep him
on the payroll for another 18 months as an advisor, which will allow
him to qualify for a city pension.</LD>
<LD>   The action was described by redevelopment officials as a way to
have Scharlin available to advise the next agency administrator.
Others criticized it as an effort to provide Scharlin with a golden
parachute.</LD>
<LD>   Scharlin will be kept on as a city employee at a reduced salary of
$2,610 a month. At the end of his 18-month stint, he will become
eligible for a pension of about $18,000 per year, or 10% of his
salary as administrator, said Dov Lesel, an agency attorney.</LD>
<TE>   "The board thought it would be helpful in terms of a transition to
have a person around to advise the next administrator," Lesel said.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney added that Scharlin had asked to remain a city
employee, rather than serve as a private consultant, so he could
become vested for a pension. Employees must work for the city at
least five years to qualify for a pension.</TE>
<TE>   Local leaders who monitor the Community Redevelopment Agency
voiced outrage at the way the action had been taken -- in a special,
closed meeting just before the holidays and after the City Council
had adjourned for the year. The meeting was held at the exclusive
City Club instead of in the board's normal meeting room at agency
headquarters. "It's business as usual," said North Hollywood attorney
Glenn Hoiby, who heads a watchdog group that oversees the agency.
"They are making their inside deals to take care of their friends."</TE>
<TE>   Hoiby and other critics questioned the need to retain Scharlin as
an advisor at a time when the redevelopment agency is trying to trim
its workforce because of expected budget problems next year.</TE>
<TE>   Neither CRA board Chairman David Farrar nor Scharlin returned
calls for comment, but an agency board member, Madeline
Janice-Aparacio, defended the decision to keep Scharlin on the
payroll.</TE>
<TE>   "Jerry has tremendous experience and skills and also knows a lot
of history here, and so this will be vital for a new administrator to
have during the transition," she said. Scharlin's contract extension
is subject to approval by the council.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Jack Weiss said in a telephone interview that he
would need assurances that Scharlin's services are really needed.</TE>
<TE>   He also said it was "odd" for a public agency to meet at "a
private, exclusive club" to conduct business.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal of a public agency should be to inspire public
confidence, and meeting like this probably doesn't advance that
goal," Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   Scharlin, who has many detractors at City Hall, announced in
October that he would not seek to renew his contract as administrator
when it expires at the end of January. The agency then launched a
national search for a replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Scharlin was hired to temporarily head the CRA in July 1999, but
later was given a contract to serve as full-time administrator, with
an annual salary of about $180,000.</TE>
<TE>   He oversees an agency with a $342-million budget. The CRA has
undergone significant cutbacks in the last five years because of
financial problems tied to the weak economy.</TE>
<TE>   An audit by the city controller accused the agency two years ago
of overpaying for property. Scharlin also sparked controversy when he
fired two top managers; the City Council paid $584,000 to settle the
employees' wrongful discharge claims.</TE>
<TE>   Critics contend the agency has a history of offering golden
parachutes to its top administrators. One former administrator who
was pressured to step down in 1990, John Tuitt, negotiated a
$1.7-million retirement agreement. When the City Council balked, he
sued and ultimately walked away with more than $1 million.</TE>

<HD>Manhattan Beach Officer Not Guilty of Assault</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Berry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Superior Court jury in Torrance acquitted a veteran Manhattan Beach
police officer Friday of charges he assaulted a 20-year-old man
during a traffic stop and filed a false police report.</LD>
<LD>   After an eight-day trial in which two officers testified against
their colleague, the jury deliberated 1 1/2 days before finding Eric
Eccles, 27, not guilty of charges related to allegations that he
repeatedly struck 20-year-old Daniel Wayne Chance after Chance ran
away from him during a routine traffic stop last December.</LD>
<LD>   The defense argued that Chance had resisted arrest and that Eccles
had used proper force to subdue the man.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. John Gilligan said he accepted the jury's
decision. He said the jury apparently saw it as an
"officer-versus-officer" case, and that there was not sufficient
proof beyond a reasonable doubt. He said jurors from Torrance and
Redondo Beach are "very supportive of their own police departments,
and it's hard for them to conceptualize that police would engage in
misconduct."</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Bill Seki said Eccles is still on paid
administrative leave, but he hopes he can resume his job soon.</TE>
<TE>   Eccles and another officer pulled Chance over on Rosecrans Avenue
on Dec. 29, 2001, for fishtailing his car while speeding. Chance ran
after he was given a ticket.</TE>
<TE>   Chance testified before a grand jury that he was afraid he would
lose his job as a heavy equipment operator trainer because he had
been drinking and was younger than 21. Eccles chased him and found
Chance hiding under the deck of a house.</TE>
<TE>   Eccles, who testified in the trial, said he hit Chance only once
in the knee because Chance was resisting.</TE>
<TE>   Seki said two Manhattan Beach police officers testified that they
saw Eccles strike Chance two or three times with a flashlight. Seki
raised questions about the officers' credibility and their ability to
see whether Chance was resisting arrest.</TE>
<TE>   He also argued that Chance's injuries were not consistent with
those that would have been suffered by someone hit repeatedly.</TE>

<HD>Fishing Groups Sue State Over Marine Reserves</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of fishing groups has sued the state Fish and Game
Commission, seeking to block creation of new marine reserves around
the Channel Islands.</LD>
<LD>   The groups say that commissioners illegally ignored their
objections to the no-fishing zones, used flawed science and violated
state environmental laws when they set boundaries for the reserves in
October. The zones are to go into effect early next year.</LD>
<LD>   Commercial fishermen say the restrictions would devastate their
livelihood while doing little to protect sensitive species of fish
around the islands off the coast of Ventura and Santa Barbara
counties.</LD>
<TE>   The 70-member Ventura County Commercial Fishermen's Assn., along
with other groups representing hundreds of thousands of commercial
and recreational fishermen in California, filed the lawsuit earlier
this month in Ventura County Superior Court. They are seeking an
order temporarily blocking the creation of the reserves, and then a
permanent injunction.</TE>
<TE>   No court hearings have been scheduled, and Fish and Game officials
are still reviewing the complaint and petition, staff counsel John
Mattox said.</TE>
<TE>   "Both the department and the commission are confident that they
fully complied with the law in establishing the marine protective
areas in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To replenish the populations of a wide array of fish and
shellfish, the commission banned fishing within a 175-square-mile
network around the five Channel Islands. It is one of the largest
marine reserves in U.S. waters.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County fisherman Chris Hoeflinger said the public comment
process on the state regulations was a sham and did not follow the
California Environmental Quality Act.</TE>
<TE>   The state's fishing regulators had already decided what they were
going to do, Hoeflinger said, "and we were just put through kind of a
kangaroo court of a process that didn't account for any of our input
and concerns along the way."</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen fear that the Channel Islands ban will lead quickly to
over-restrictive no-fishing zones and conservation areas up and down
California's 1,150-mile coastline. State law requires a draft map of
such a network by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Around the Channel Islands, the regulations were to have taken
effect Jan. 1, but because of delays in getting the legal wording
reviewed, it could be several months before the ban begins.</TE>
<TE>   Colder currents around the Channel Islands have made for a good
year for lobster and crab fishermen and a terrific year for sea bass
and halibut fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   To Tim Athens, who has been fishing commercially for 12 years, the
fish population seems healthier than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "If I can go out in less time, catch more fish than I have ever
caught and I'm getting more money than ever for them, it seems to me
things are pretty good," Athens said.</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen contend that by shrinking the area where they fish,
regulators will actually harm fish by forcing boats into a smaller
area.</TE>
<TE>   "We're forced to fish unsustainably; we're forced to over-fish,"
Hoeflinger said.</TE>
<TE>   A marine biologist for the Department of Fish and Game said there
is no evidence from protected areas elsewhere in the world that
suggests that will happen.</TE>
<TE>   "You actually have better catches" outside reserves, John Ugoretz
said.</TE>

<HD>'Hiding Your Money' Author, L.A. Lawyer Indicted in IRS
Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerome Schneider, author of "Hiding Your Money," and Los Angeles
attorney Eric Witmeyer were indicted Thursday on charges of
conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service and of wire and
mail fraud.</LD>
<LD>   The indictments were the latest volley in redoubled efforts by the
IRS to crack down on offshore accounts that the government believes
U.S. citizens use to hide billions of dollars in assets and income.</LD>
<LD>   According to the indictment, Schneider, who lives in Vancouver,
Canada, promoted tax fraud through the use of offshore banks. He
marketed the program through books published by a Manhattan Beach
company that he allegedly controls and through advertisements in
newspapers and in-flight magazines such as American Way and Sky Mall.</LD>
<TE>   The indictment said he also hosted "offshore wealth summits" --
attended by congressmen and other public figures -- in Canada;
Cancun, Mexico; and Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider would get wealthy clients to pay $15,000 to $60,000 to
buy the shares of dormant companies with banking licenses in the
island nation of Nauru -- a tiny Pacific island with few people but
many banks, according to the indictment, which was handed up by a
federal grand jury in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Witmeyer then would charge the client an additional $15,000 to
obscure the investor's ownership through a so-called decontrol
process, according to legal papers filed in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is not illegal to own shares in an offshore bank or to
deposit money offshore, U.S. residents must report their income -- no
matter where it was earned -- and pay tax on it.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider's attorney, Los Angeles criminal defense lawyer Harlan
Braun, maintains that his client is an honest businessman whose
operations are simply misunderstood.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Schneider has set up offshore banks for years," said Braun,
"but offshore banks have both legal purposes and illegal purposes.
Mr. Schneider's position is that he has told people you cannot use
them for tax evasion."</TE>
<TE>   Witmeyer could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment was the result of a five-year investigation
involving two undercover IRS agents who posed as prospective clients.</TE>
<TE>   The government alleged in court documents that Schneider and
Witmeyer not only helped U.S. residents buy banks, but also told them
that the entities would allow them "to evade the payment of income
tax on income earned or gain realized by the offshore entity."</TE>
<TE>   The pair were indicted on one count of conspiracy to defraud the
IRS, 14 counts of wire fraud and eight counts of mail fraud. If
convicted of all charges, each man could face up to 115 years in
prison, according to the U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco.</TE>

<LD>Chief William J. Bratton unveiled his organizational blueprint for
the Los Angeles Police Department on Friday, saying he would appoint
more civilians to top posts and elevate the importance of bureaus
dealing with homeland security, internal affairs and the federal
consent decree.</LD>
<LD>   The heads of those bureaus will report directly to the chief.
Bratton said he is trying to decentralize other areas of the
department, which will be consolidated under three previously named
deputy and assistant chiefs.</LD>
<LD>   "Parker Center supposedly has a tilt going toward my office,"
Bratton told a group of more than 100 LAPD officials of captain rank
and above during an all-day retreat at the Burbank Airport Hilton.
"The tilt should be out of my office."</LD>
<TE>   Bratton said a new Homeland Security Bureau will consolidate
functions such as intelligence, counterterrorism, major narcotics and
organized crime, among others. Bratton has picked ABC news magazine
co-anchor John Miller to head the office.</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Chaleff, most recently a senior advisor to City Atty. Rocky
Delgadillo, has been picked by Bratton for the new post that oversees
implementation of the federal consent decree instituted after the
Rampart corruption scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton has yet to select the head of Internal Affairs, which
previously was under the chief of staff but will now report to the
chief. It remains unclear if that post will be filled by a police
official or a civilian.</TE>
<TE>   Under prior LAPD regimes, civilians have been relegated to
administrative functions. But Bratton, former head of the New York
Police Commission, wants to move more civilians into the department
to free sworn officers for more traditional police work.</TE>
<TE>   The 14 LAPD department heads who now report directly to the chief
of police will be trimmed to about seven to reflect the new
priorities of the department, the mayor and Police Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The deputy chiefs heading the South, West, Valley and Central
operations bureaus and the deputy chief coordinating gangs will
report to Assistant Chief Jim McDonnell, as will the heads of the new
Compstat computer tracking system and the LAPD's detective bureau, a
newly created position. Bratton has announced plans to elevate George
Gascon and Sharon Papa to be assistant chiefs.</TE>

<HD>Mother of 'Dr. Laura' Found Dead</HD>
<DH>The body of radio host's estranged parent was in her
Beverly Hills condo for up to two months. Police are investigating
case as a homicide.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The mother of radio talk show personality Laura Schlessinger was
found dead this week in her Beverly Hills condominium, where she had
remained undiscovered for as long as two months. Police said they are
investigating it as a homicide.</LD>
<LD>   Neighbors said they had last seen Yolanda Schlessinger, 77, in
September. Building managers called police after noticing her
uncollected mail. She also had not paid her condo fees.</LD>
<LD>   The younger Schlessinger, who grew wealthy dispensing advice about
families and relationships on her radio program, had talked often
about being estranged from her mother. She confirmed the death on her
radio show Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Police would not say how long Yolanda Schlessinger had been dead.
In a statement released before her show Friday, Laura Schlessinger
said she was "horrified by the tragic circumstances of my mother's
death, and so sad to learn that she died as she chose to live --
alone and isolated. My mother shut all her family out of her life
over the years, though we made several futile attempts to stay
connected. May God rest her soul."</TE>
<TE>   Later, on the air, Schlessinger said she was, "shocked and
horrified" by the suspicion of a crime and, "overwhelmed by sadness,"
but blamed their estrangement on her mother. Schlessinger also has a
sister.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1994 People magazine profile, Schlessinger said the
estrangement dated to 1986, when her mother walked off the job as
Laura's secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors described Yolanda Schlessinger as a friendly, pleasant,
talkative person who seemed "quite bright," said Edna Neidorff, a
former resident of the apartment complex in the 400 block of North
Palm Drive.</TE>
<TE>   Neidorff said the victim was chatty with neighbors. They called
her "Lundy," the name she listed on the condo roster.</TE>
<TE>   Schlessinger had lived in the building two or three years with a
very noisy, white, parrot-like bird, Neidorff and other neighbors
said. Several said they had stopped hearing the bird some weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Licia Masi lived in the same building as Yolanda Schlessinger.
Masi said that earlier this week, her daughter, a building manager,
had called police to check on Schlessinger.</TE>
<TE>   Masi's daughter had grown concerned because she had not seen
Schlessinger in about two months, mail had begun to pile up, and two
months had passed without her paying her condo bill, Masi said.</TE>
<TE>   When police entered the apartment, they found the windows slightly
ajar -- one reason, Masi said, that no odor was detectable to other
residents. Police could not confirm this.</TE>
<TE>   Why no one noticed the death "is a question that we have," said
Beverly Hills Police Lt. Gary Gilmond, noting that officers were
finally alerted only because Schlessinger had not been seen recently.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Friday that they found Yolanda Schlessinger's body
Monday afternoon when officers responded to a request for a check on
her welfare.</TE>
<TE>   The victim had been dead "for a substantial period of time,"
Gilmond said.</TE>
<TE>   The coroner's office said an autopsy Wednesday did not immediately
reveal the cause of death, and that more tests will be conducted.</TE>
<TE>   Gilmond said, however, that police "have sufficient information
from the coroner that we are handling it as a homicide at this time."</TE>
<TE>   The case presents detectives with difficulties because so much
time has passed, Gilmond said.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Schlessinger, 55, has long been one of talk radio's biggest
stars, internationally syndicated since 1994. In September 1997,
Jacor Communications Inc. paid a then-record $71.5 million to buy the
show from Synergy Broadcasting Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Although not a professionally trained psychotherapist, "Dr. Laura"
(she has a doctorate in physiology) specializes in a sort of
tough-love approach to counseling. The Dr. Laura Schlessinger Show
began in 1990 on KFI in Los Angeles and is now heard on more than 300
stations worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   With her stern morality and emphasis on traditional family values,
Schlessinger has long been the darling of conservatives and religious
conservatives -- called "a positive voice for positive values without
equal in our time" by the Rev. Robert Schuller.</TE>
<TE>   But Schlessinger's popularity has waned somewhat in recent years.
She angered supporters of gay rights several years ago by calling
homosexuality "a biological error."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, she issued a statement saying that she was sorry for
causing hurt, but did not retract the substance of the remark.</TE>
<TE>   A syndicated television talk show, "Dr. Laura," was canceled in
2001 after one season, and Schlessinger blamed an advertising boycott
encouraged by gay rights groups.</TE>
<TE>   She has publicly acknowledged on numerous occasions that she has
been estranged from her mother, who she said was "Sophia Loren-like,"
since sometime in the mid-1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Her early family life in Brooklyn was troubled, Laura Schlessinger
has said.</TE>
<TE>   She has said her parents fought constantly, and her father was
physically and emotionally abusive. "I have a background that would
curl your hair," she said in a 1998 interview with The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking with a tremor in her voice unlike her more steely
trademark style, Schlessinger said Friday at the close of her show:
"I deeply regret that, despite any attempts I made to make contact or
stay connected, she died without that ever being accomplished. And
it's very sad. It's very horrifying, obviously, and very sad."</TE>
<TE>   In her show, Schlessinger frequently draws a distinction between
good and bad mothers. The theme is so typical of her that she and her
fans wear shirts emblazoned with "I Am My Kid's Mom."</TE>
<TE>   Schlessinger has accused her own mother of falling short.
Schlessinger's mother, the former Yolanda Ceccovini, was born and
raised in Italy, but immigrated to the United States after meeting an
American soldier, Monroe Schlessinger, during World War II, according
to Laura Schlessinger's biography.</TE>
<TE>   Ceccovini had been raised Roman Catholic; Schlessinger was Jewish;
and their daughter has said that religion was just one of the
battlegrounds on which the couple fought in succeeding years. Laura
Schlessinger has said she was raised without any religion; she
converted to Judaism in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Masi, the building manager's mother, said Yolanda Schlessinger was
a charming, very conversational person, who spoke English as well as
Italian and dressed very elegantly.</TE>
<TE>   Although she believed the blond, blue-eyed Schlessinger was in her
70s, Masi said the woman looked much younger and had a youthful,
jovial manner.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so strange that she had no visitors," Masi said. She said
Schlessinger never mentioned her famous daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Neidorff described her acquaintance, Schlessinger, as a "lovely
lady" who seemed "very wise."</TE>
<TE>   "She was very friendly," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "But very private -- an interesting combination. She had an accent
that someone told me was Italian.... She never mentioned her
daughter."</TE>

<HD>County Revises Market Loan</HD>
<DH>Transit agency officials restructure terms for financially
struggling Grand Central complex.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kurt Streeter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seeking to bail out downtown's financially struggling Grand Central
Market, Los Angeles County transportation officials have decided to
restructure a multimillion-dollar loan package made to the market's
developer nine years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Under the agreement, the $38.6-million debt owed by the private
development team that rehabilitated the market and a surrounding
group of buildings in downtown's historic district will be split into
two 30-year loans, and the payments will be lowered, said Steve
Carnevale, chief legal counsel for the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority.</LD>
<LD>   One of the loan notes, for $19 million, comes with an interest
rate that starts at 4% and will rise over time, reaching 8% in the
last five years. Records show that annual payments will begin at
$760,000 and eventually reach $1.5 million. The second loan, for
$19.6 million, will be due in one lump sum, without interest, at the
end of the 30-year term.</LD>
<TE>   The market's ownership said the restructured deal will allow it to
keep the Grand Central complex intact. To help boost revenue, rates
will be raised on its 500-space parking lot, said Anne Peaks, vice
president of the Yellin Co., which owns and oversees the complex.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations are underway to fill vacancies in the theater that is
part of the complex and a basement under the market, where a grocery
store is one possibility. Peaks said ownership is also banking on a
recovery by the historic area, which would increase patronage.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA, which signed off on a previous restructuring in 1997,
could have foreclosed and taken over or sold the market, but chose
not to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the options, this was just the best thing for us to do,"
Carnevale said, noting that his agency did not want the
responsibility of operating the complex and would have lost millions
if it tried to sell the building.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, the MTA led an effort to provide public backing of the
complex, teaming with the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency
on a $44-million loan package to a group headed by Ira Yellin, a
noted developer and downtown preservationist who died in September.</TE>
<TE>   Yellin's group of investors added about $20 million to the
project, which included revamping the landmark market, turning
surrounding offices into apartments, remodeling the vaudeville-era
Million Dollar Theater and building a multilevel parking garage.</TE>
<TE>   City officials saw the rehabilitation as key to efforts to
energize the historic core. MTA officials said they thought the
project could spur ridership at the nearby Red Line stop.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its popularity, the Grand Central Market complex has
struggled financially from the start, as has much of the
long-depressed downtown core.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, the MTA and CRA approved a deal to restructure
debt payments from Yellin's management team. That deal allowed the
management team to fall behind on payments, to a limit of $4 million,
at which point the MTA could foreclose.</TE>
<TE>   Records show that, in June 2001, the management team fell more
than $4 million behind on payments and is now more than $5 million in
arrears. A report prepared for MTA board members details the
complex's struggles. The report also shows that much of the financial
trouble springs from the market, which relies on stalls that sell
fast food and curios.</TE>
<TE>   Vacancies and higher-than-anticipated maintenance costs are
dragging the market's finances down. The apartments and theater also
are bringing in far less revenue than anticipated. The entire complex
is now appraised at $19 million, Carnevale said.</TE>
<TE>   Yellin's widow, Adele, is now overseeing the project. She said it
was important that the market complex be saved.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a linchpin in the effort to revitalize downtown, and it
needed to be kept intact," she said. "I know Ira would have been
thrilled with the deal."</TE>

<LD>A judge refused to dismiss criminal charges against Jeremy J. Morse,
a former Inglewood police officer charged in an arrest caught on
videotape that shows him slamming a teenager onto the trunk of a
police car.</LD>
<LD>   Eleven days after the controversial July 6 arrest, Inglewood
Officers Morse and Bijan Darvish were indicted on charges of assault
under color of law and filing a false police report, respectively.</LD>
<LD>   Morse was fired in October after the police chief reviewed the
incident; Darvish remains with the department. Trial was set for
March 3 for the defendants, both 25, who appeared in court Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Defense lawyer John Barnett argued that the prosecution failed to
inform a grand jury of two so-called experts -- including one from
the Los Angeles County district attorney's office -- who say the
officers' use of force was within reason.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge William Hollingsworth said
he denied the defense's request Friday because he believes the case
should go to trial. He rejected a similar motion last month on behalf
of Darvish. A lawyer for Darvish filed an appeal earlier this month,
saying that the prosecution did not provide jurors with important
information, including the use-of-force experts.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett said Friday that he will consider whether to appeal the
judge's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "But we'll be prepared to go to trial and explain to a jury why
[Morse's] actions were not unlawful," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The incident began when police began questioning the teenager's
father. Videotapes -- one recorded by an amateur cameraman and
another by surveillance cameras at the gas station where the arrest
occurred -- showed police struggling with 16-year-old Donovan Jackson
before handcuffing him.</TE>
<TE>   Tapes then reveal Morse lifting the teenager by the back of the
collar and beltline, carrying him to the squad car, slamming Jackson
down on the trunk and hitting him in the jaw. The bystander's
videotape was broadcast nationwide, prompting protests of police
brutality and drawing the attention of U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft.</TE>
<TE>   Morse has said that he had to hit Jackson because the teenager had
grabbed his testicles and would not let go. His defense lawyer argued
Friday that Morse had to lift Jackson and place the teenager in the
squad car because Jackson was resisting arrest by going limp. Both
sides agreed that a key element of the trial will focus on whether
Jackson was conscious.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Max Huntsman questioned the credibility of the
defense's expert witnesses -- Senior Dist. Atty. Investigator David
Ishibashi and Inglewood Officer G.D. Sanford, the department's
use-of-force instructor. The district attorney's office has
emphasized that neither man has qualified in a courtroom as a
use-of-force expert.</TE>
<TE>   Morse and Darvish are each free on $25,000 bail. They return to
court Jan. 29 for a pretrial hearing.</TE>

<LD>'Tis the season to become disoriented while shopping. The crime log
of the Big Bear Grizzly, in terse cop talk, carried a "report of
purse stolen from grocery cart while shopping....</LD>
<LD>   "Party was talking to store staff about high price of potatoes and
turned around and continued shopping, placing potatoes in the wrong
cart." The newspaper added that the missing cart and purse were found
"by the bananas."</LD>

<TE>   Some stores are a bit confused too: Nan Williams of West Hollywood

<LD>A court decision Friday could spell more bad news for Orange County's
beleaguered Planning Department.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge C. Robert Jameson ruled that the county must
follow federal guidelines on the type of expenses that can be paid
with user fees.</LD>
<LD>   A lawsuit claims that the Planning Department spent revenue
collected from building permits on overhead and administration
instead of costs associated with the permitting process. The suit,
filed by a national homebuilder, says the county violated federal
guidelines.</LD>
<TE>   A special master selected by the judge to examine Orange County's
planning finances has said in court papers that the Planning
Department may have misspent as much as $10 million.</TE>
<TE>   The master, Robert P. Mosier, said the county may have to place
that amount into a reserve fund until a ruling is made on whether the
money was spent properly.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey V. Dunne, a private attorney representing the county, said
the county has complied with the federal and state guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the Board of Supervisors approved an $8-million
emergency loan to the department. Planning officials hoped to
persuade supervisors to raise permit fees as a way of repaying that
loan and replenishing their reserves.</TE>

<CX>   Planning department -- Two stories in the California section about
the Orange County Planning Department's financial problems contained
inaccuracies. An article Saturday incorrectly reported that the
department may have to place $10 million in planning fees into a
special fund until a judge rules whether the money was properly
spent. In fact, the money will be put into the fund permanently if a
judge rules that it was spent improperly. A story Sunday reported
incorrectly that a judge has ruled that the department misspent $12
million from a fund containing building permit fees. The judge has
not yet ruled on the issue.</CX>

<HD>Caught Between Dueling Policies</HD>
<DH>Hundreds of Middle Eastern immigrants who overstayed visas
hoped to pay a fine and have a hearing. Instead, they were detained.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Weinstein and Greg Krikorian</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Bijan Pirazdeh, a native of Iran, went to INS headquarters in
downtown Los Angeles at 5 a.m. Monday, he expected to fill out some
routine paperwork under the government's new immigration registration
program and go to work a few blocks away.</LD>
<LD>   After all, Pirazdeh, 43, was a Caltrans engineer who had worked
for the state more than two years. A resident of California since
1995, he had fled Iran in the mid-1980s after being jailed for three
years on political offenses and was granted political asylum in
Norway before coming to the United States. He had an interview
scheduled for Feb. 7 to obtain permanent resident status.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of heading to the office, Pirazdeh was sent to jail. He
remained in custody Friday, threatened with deportation.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel sorrow for this society," Pirazdeh said in an interview
from an INS detention facility in San Pedro. "I still believe this
society and this country is based on freedom."</TE>
<TE>   Like many of the hundreds of immigrants who were detained in
Southern California on Monday by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, Pirazdeh was caught between two conflicting government
policies.</TE>
<TE>   Under an immigration law adopted in the 1990s and reauthorized in
2000, immigrants who have overstayed their visas can have their
status regularized by paying a fine and going through a hearing so
long as they have family ties in the United States, a job or job
offer and a clean record. In Pirazdeh's case, he has a job and a
family relationship because his mother is a permanent resident who is
soon to become a citizen.</TE>
<TE>   Many immigrants who had green card applications pending as part of
that process -- known as 245i after the relevant section of the
immigration law -- had assumed that they were protected under the law
while they waited for the INS to finish processing their paperwork
even though their visas had expired.</TE>
<TE>   But under the policies adopted to govern the registration process
-- at least in the Los Angeles region -- INS officials detained
anyone who had an immigration irregularity. Once detained, many of
the immigrants, even if released on bail, faced the possibility of
deportation.</TE>
<TE>   Stories like Pirazdeh's have fueled a barrage of criticism all
week of the way the INS handled a new requirement that men and boys
from many predominantly Muslim nations register with the agency. Men
in the United States on temporary visa status who come from Iran,
Iraq, Syria, Sudan and Libya were required to register by Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration advocates say the Justice Department and the INS
wrongly placed hundreds of foreign nationals in an impossible
situation.</TE>
<TE>   "This should never have happened," said Greg Simons of the
Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles. "A lot of these
people who went to register were just waiting for the INS to
finishing processing their applications. And so their being out of
status was just a matter of the INS not being able to finish its
task."</TE>
<TE>   Such delays, he and others said, led to scene after scene of
families desperately awaiting word on husbands, fathers or brothers
who had gone in to obey the law and now found themselves treated like
criminals.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw one pregnant woman who must have been within a week of
having a baby," said immigration advocate Farah Ramchandani, an
Iranian American whose brother was among the 53 U.S. hostages taken
by radicals at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran two decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The woman had been waiting for days to have her husband released.
But they were holding him without bond" for a visa violation.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Justice Department and the INS have defended
the registration program, insisting that the vast majority of
individuals who showed up to register were in the country lawfully
and not detained.</TE>
<TE>   Those who were arrested, officials added, were kept in custody
only because hundreds of people arrived at the registration process
on the last day. The crush of people overwhelmed the ability of
authorities to conduct thorough security checks on all those whose
visas or other immigration papers had expired, INS officials say.</TE>
<TE>   A city-by-city summary of the new registration process seemed to
verify that the problems in the Los Angeles area, home to the
nation's largest Iranian immigrant population, were by far the worst
in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The summary, compiled by the American Immigration Lawyers Assn.,
shows that while INS officials in Baltimore, Boston, San Diego and
New York referred out-of-status cases to investigators, the Los
Angeles office decided to arrest those individuals until they had
been thoroughly cleared through security checks.</TE>
<TE>   Although the INS said all but two dozen of those detained in Los
Angeles had been released by Friday, agency officials declined to
comment about the other cities.</TE>
<TE>   In Buena Park, about 450 people -- many of them Muslim immigrants
from the Middle East -- gathered at the Sequoia Conference Center
Friday to rail against the detainments.</TE>
<TE>   "We have rights, and we will not go away simply because we are not
citizens," Tareef Nashashibi, president of the Arab-American
Republican Club of Orange County. "We are outraged at what is going
on. When you wake up in the morning to say your prayers, call your
congressman."</TE>
<TE>   Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Council on
America-Islamic Relations of Southern California, echoed that
message.</TE>
<TE>   "This new McCarthyism against Muslims must end," he said. "Are you
going to deport us all?"</TE>
<TE>   Other groups participating included the American Civil Liberties
Union, League of United Latin American Citizens, Los Angeles County
Bar Assn., National Lawyers Guild and the Japanese American Citizens
League.</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Swank, a community relations officer for the INS, evoked
hoots when he said: "We feel your pain. We are very sensitive to the
issues being raised, but the rules need to be followed. Your message
is being very carefully considered at the highest levels."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Howard Berman (D-Van Nuys), a key sponsor of immigration
reforms, criticized the registration program Friday as "an outrageous
and self-defeating policy."</TE>
<TE>   "The real outrage is that we are asking people to come forward
voluntarily and using the program to ensnare them," Berman said.</TE>
<TE>   The possibility that the INS would be unable to handle a flood of
people showing up to comply with the new registration program had
been discussed by immigration lawyers and advocates for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Some immigration officials blamed the problems on a last-minute
flood of registrants, but others warned that what happened was an
omen of things to come under new Justice Department regulations that
will require more immigrants to register in coming months.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an atrocity," immigration attorney Steve Espinoza said
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, you could immigrate to the United States and you didn't
have to worry about being detained," he said. "Now, you can bank on
being detained, on paying a bond, and on your case being delayed.
What used to take maybe eight months will now probably take two or
three years just because of the backlog in immigration."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, an INS official said individuals with complaints about
their treatment should call (800) 869-4499 to report the cases to the
Justice Department's inspector general's office.</TE>

<HD>Clearing Canyon by Truck Is Urged</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Cara Mia DiMassa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The best way to remove tens of thousands of cubic yards of rock
debris from a San Gabriel Mountains canyon is to construct a
temporary road and haul the material out by truck, the U.S. Forest
Service announced Friday.</LD>
<LD>   After almost a year of waiting, the agency issued its
environmental assessment report for the Rubio Canyon debris pile,
pushing the above option as the best of five plans to restore the
Angeles National Forest site north of Altadena that was buried under
a landslide in 1998, when a water pipe replacement project went awry.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the debris field, which stretches hundreds of feet and is
estimated to be as deep as 100 feet in places, is a staggering sight,
visible on a clear day from as far away as Torrance, according to
some activists and hikers.</LD>
<TE>   How the recommended cleanup, estimated to cost $1.5 million to $2
million, will be paid for is still under discussion. Rep. David
Dreier (R-Glendora) is trying to appropriate some federal funds for
the project. The Rubio Canon Land and Water Assn. controls a water
pipeline in the canyon.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Forest Service report, the debris pile was
created when a contractor used explosives while working on the
pipeline in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The pipeline had been damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake,
and Federal Emergency Management Agency funds had been obtained to
repair it, the Forest Service said. The Rubio Canon association,
which has owned water rights to the canyon for more than 100 years,
is responsible for the upkeep of its pipelines.</TE>
<TE>   Association officials could not be reached for comment Friday. But
in the past, they have disputed the Forest Service's characterization
of the chain of events that led to the debris pile and have called on
FEMA to pay for the cleanup.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service has said Rubio Canon got permission to
construct a rock "bench" measuring 4 feet by 4 feet by 80 feet to
hold the pipeline. But the project's contractor overstepped those
parameters, creating a much bigger bench, the service said. By the
time the Forest Service examined the construction site, the canyon
was swamped in rocks.</TE>
<TE>   Trapped underneath are five or six once-pristine waterfalls, as
well as some remnants of the old Mt. Lowe Railway.</TE>
<TE>   The report, by the environmental consulting firm Jones and Stokes,
presents five possible solutions.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it does an excellent job of looking at all of the
possibilities, or at least all the ones we and the public came up
with," said Rich Borden, a Forest Service planner.</TE>
<TE>   "We picked five that are the most practical, and we looked at the
impact of those," said Borden. Among the options: taking no action
and letting the rocks naturally work their way down the canyon into a
debris basin; trying to manipulate some debris downstream via
tractor; and completely removing the debris pile via a temporary road
within the stream channel.</TE>
<TE>   That alternative, which was added to Jones and Stokes' original
proposals late in the report cycle, is one reason for the report's
delay, Borden said.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Ayers, a civil rights attorney who has become an advocate for
the canyon's restoration, said the Forest Service has learned a
valuable lesson from the slides and their aftermath. "They've gone
from being exploiters to being stewards," he said earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, he praised the report -- and the Forest Service's
conclusion that carting the rock out by truck is the best approach.</TE>
<TE>   "The best thing in terms of historical and recreational usage is
to get all the debris out," Ayers said.</TE>
<TE>   The public has until Jan. 31 to submit comments to the Forest
Service about the report, which is available online at
http://208.187.37.229/rubio.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>California's bond rating was cut for the second time in two days,
with New York-based Fitch Ratings lowering its assessment three
levels because of a projected $34.8-billion budget deficit in the
next two fiscal years.</LD>
<LD>   Fitch cited the growing deficit Friday as the trigger for cutting
its rating on $23.5 billion in general obligation bonds to A from AA.
On Thursday, Standard &amp; Poor's cut it to A from A+. Fitch issued an
alert 20 months ago that the rating might be lowered because of state
power purchases during the energy crisis.</LD>

<LD>Alarmed by the recent surge in murders and violence in Los Angeles,
school officials have bolstered security to prevent those crimes from
spilling onto school grounds.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Unified School District, already facing rising
crime rates this year in its facilities, has increased the number of
school police officers from one to two on 10 campuses in the most
crime-ridden areas. Some schools also plan to hire more aides and
install video cameras, while administrators across the district say
they are being more vigilant.</LD>
<LD>   "Schools are a microcosm of society," said Willie Crittendon, the
district's director of school operations and safety. "We're seeing an
increase of violent behavior on school campuses. We're asking schools
to review safe school plans and modify them. We're reaching out to
parents, the community, staff members."</LD>
<TE>   The district's other 39 high schools have one full-time officer on
campus from the school district's independent police force.
Forty-five of the district's 75 middle schools each have one officer.
Many educators and police officers, especially in the San Fernando
Valley, have complained for years that Los Angeles Unified's police
department is understaffed.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Kerstein, who became chief of the 309-officer Los Angeles
Unified School District police department in June, said he plans to
submit a proposal that would expand staffing to four full-time
gun-carrying police officers for every high school campus, and at
least one for every middle school campus over the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of crime is committed by 14- to 18-year-old males, which is
our students," said Kerstein, a former Los Angeles Police Department
officer who also was chief of police in the West Valley City Police
Department in Utah. "Increased truancy translates to increased
burglary rates in the area."</TE>
<TE>   Although budget problems may curtail his plans, such extra
policing has the support of some educators.</TE>
<TE>   "The resources are all going to the instruction side," said Denny
Thompson, principal of Canoga Park High.</TE>
<TE>   He said he feels the recent focus on test scores and balancing the
budget has compromised security.</TE>
<TE>   "We need more campus aides, whether older adults or young adults,"
he said. "A lot of times, the problem is outsiders who come onto
campus."</TE>
<TE>   Some principals and students, however, don't want too much of a
police presence.</TE>
<TE>   Erran Daniels, 17, a student at Manual Arts High School, said
administrators are already reaching out more to students to prevent
fights or violence. "They promise to protect [us] on campus now," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   But she does not want more police or security guards because they
make students feel they are being "labeled as violent criminals," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The violence off campus in recent weeks has many students worried.
Although none of the killings occurred on school grounds, some
involved students or took place near high schools. Many educators
fear retaliation or fights between rival gangs may creep onto
campuses or affect students coming from or going to school.</TE>
<TE>   "None of the students feel safe," said Kenneth Raymond, 17, a
junior at Dorsey High School who recently helped form a student group
that meets with district officials and police to discuss ways to
prevent violence.</TE>
<TE>   Raymond said students were jolted in July when two of their
classmates were shot just outside the school.</TE>
<TE>   He said he's seen staff members put themselves in danger to break
up fights on campus.</TE>
<TE>   "Before you see school police, you see our principal or assistant
principal come running to break up a fight," Raymond said.</TE>
<TE>   "But they can only do so much.... They don't have guns or
bulletproof vests." And extra campus police won't change that, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw High School students recently mourned the death of Clive
Jackson, 14, a freshman basketball player. He was slain Nov. 21 in
front of a South-Central doughnut shop after a fistfight.</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw Principal Isaac Hammond said that "as the violence goes
up you see more huddles at lunch ... you hear about retaliation."</TE>
<TE>   Christine Clark, principal of Francis Polytechnic High School in
Sun Valley, said gang battles have erupted nearby. "If it happens out
in the community, you just hope it doesn't come onto campus," she
added.</TE>
<TE>   But administrators and teachers say they are also experiencing a
more volatile climate inside their schools compared with a year ago
because of intensified gang rivalries. This is discouraging, they
say, because they have long thought of their schools as havens.</TE>
<TE>   "Particularly for us in the south area, we have been aware of it
heating up months ago," said Sgt. Mike Bowman of the Los Angeles
school police. "We're really seeing an upward swing in activity."</TE>
<TE>   Crime on L.A. Unified campuses has increased for the first three
months of this school year compared with last year, according to
district statistics.</TE>
<TE>   In the 737,000-student district, crimes against people rose from
556 during August, September and October last year to 606 this year.</TE>
<TE>   Among those, battery crimes against a school employee rose from 28
to 45. Assaults with a deadly weapon rose from 66 to 84. Robbery and
extortion crimes rose from 72 to 95.</TE>
<TE>   The number of property crimes in the district rose from 1,522 in
2001 to 1,790 in 2002. And the number of weapons violations rose from
111 to 155, including 12 involving firearms possession.</TE>
<TE>   Buren Simmons, director of the Los Angeles Unified Youth Relations
and Crime Prevention Unit, said the district is also focusing on
improving student mediation programs and boosting staff training, as
well as working with community groups, the Sheriff's Department and
the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, some LAPD officers agreed to alter their shifts so that
staff rotations would not occur around 3 p.m., when most students are
getting out of school.</TE>
<TE>   The school district police force recently added a drug-sniffing
dog for schools and its only motorcycle officer to improve traffic
around campuses.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, Chief Kerstein also reassigned a second police
officer to the 10 most violent high schools: Washington Preparatory,
Crenshaw, Manual Arts, Locke, Fremont, Jordan, Gardena, Belmont, Los
Angeles and Dorsey.</TE>
<TE>   Washington, which last month was called "out of control" after a
teacher wrote a letter to the district complaining that students were
having sex, gambling and fighting on campus, is receiving more video
cameras, security aides and two additional bicycle patrol police
officers.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, when school was letting out at Washington
Prep, Ed Woodruff, an L.A. Unified crime prevention worker, was
warned by a student that a shooting was about to happen nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, minutes later a few blocks from the school a shooting
resulted in an overturned car and three injured people, Woodruff
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad that these things are happening," Woodruff said.</TE>
<TE>   "The killings and those issues, whatever spills over from their
homeland they bring that baggage to school. It affects how young
people participate in the classroom."</TE>

<HD>Court Weighs Barring Judges From Scouting</HD>
<DH>California justices will consider whether Boy Scouts'
prohibition on gays provides ethical grounds for banning jurists'
involvement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Guccione</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the urging of Los Angeles and San Francisco bar association
leaders, the California Supreme Court will consider whether state
judges should be ethically barred from belonging to the Boys Scouts
of America because the organization discriminates against
homosexuals.</LD>
<LD>   California Chief Justice Ronald M. George said Friday that he met
with San Francisco bar leaders for an hour earlier this month to
discuss their request to amend the California Code of Judicial Ethics
to ban membership in the Scouts.</LD>
<LD>   "I heard them out," George said. "And I made a commitment only to
discuss it with my colleagues."</LD>
<TE>   In reintroducing the issue, George said he was responding to
requests from three local bar groups and heightened interest among
some lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we should have a fair airing of the issue," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, after the U.S. Supreme Court held that the national
Boy Scout organization had a constitutional right to discriminate,
the state Supreme Court reviewed the section of the judicial ethics
code that allows association with Boy Scouts, and took no action to
change it.</TE>
<TE>   But Los Angeles bar leaders said in a Dec. 11 letter to George
that the state high court should reconsider its position in light of
the Judicial Council's 2001 "Report on Sexual Orientation Fairness in
California."</TE>
<TE>   The report found, among other things, that half of the gay and
lesbian court-users surveyed believe that the state court system was
not providing fair and unbiased treatment of those groups.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles bar joined the bar associations in San Francisco
and Santa Clara counties in asking the state Supreme Court to delete
the Boy Scout exception in the judicial ethics code.</TE>
<TE>   Canon 2C prohibits judges from belonging to organizations that
practice "invidious discrimination on the basis of race, sex,
religion, national origin or sexual orientation." But it makes an
exception for "nonprofit youth organizations."</TE>
<TE>   "Such actions raise serious and legitimate questions in the
public's mind about the ability of courts to render fair and unbiased
justice," wrote Miriam Aroni Krinksy, president of the Los Angeles
County Bar Assn.</TE>
<TE>   George said Friday that the court would spend the next few months
researching the issues and circulating memorandums among the
justices. The justices may amend the rules, refer the issue to an
advisory committee or take no action.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say such a ban would violate their freedom of
association and prevent them from participating in Scouting
activities with their children.</TE>
<TE>   Under the current code, "judges are put in the individual position
of deciding for themselves" whether membership in the Boy Scouts is
unethical, George said.</TE>
<TE>   The state Supreme Court has had sole power to adopt and amend the
judicial ethics code since 1995. George said all changes to the code
have been made by consensus among the seven justices.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, judges in San Francisco Superior Court adopted
a ban on membership in Scouting chapters unless those chapters had
disavowed the national organization's policy on homosexuals.</TE>

<HD>'70s SLA Fugitive Pleads Not Guilty to U.S. Charges</HD>
<DH>James Kilgore returns from South Africa for trial on
explosives indictment. He also faces state charges in 1975 robbery,
murder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John M. Glionna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Symbionese Liberation Army foot soldier James W. Kilgore was
arraigned in U.S. District Court here Friday, ending a
quarter-century on the run from his past as a violent 1970s political
dissident.</LD>
<LD>   Dressed in a pea-green lockup jumpsuit covered by a brown jacket,
the 55-year-old Kilgore looked stiff and said little as he pleaded
not guilty to explosives charges and other counts before U.S.
Magistrate Bernard Zimmerman.</LD>
<LD>   Guarded by U.S. marshals, Kilgore arrived Thursday from Cape Town,
South Africa, where he was arrested last month while leading a
fugitive's life as a national activist and university professor.</LD>
<TE>   He was ordered held without bail, and is scheduled to appear in
court again Jan. 6.</TE>
<TE>   Kilgore smiled briefly at several friends in the hushed courtroom,
among them William Harris, a fellow member of the radical leftist
group, who appeared to offer emotional support.</TE>
<TE>   Kilgore and Harris were members of the extremist group that
kidnapped newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst and participated in a
1975 bank robbery in which a 42-year-old homemaker, Myra Opsahl, was
killed while depositing money from a church collection.</TE>
<TE>   Two decades after their crimes, Harris and three other members of
the group -- Emily Harris Montague, Michael Bortin and Sara Jane
Olson -- pleaded guilty last month to Opsahl's murder under an
agreement in which each will face no more than eight years in prison.
Harris is free on bail. Kilgore's attorney, Louis Freeman, said
Friday that state prosecutors had offered his client a similar deal.</TE>
<TE>   Kilgore was arrested in South Africa just one day after the other
four entered their plea agreement, a turn of events U.S. prosecutors
say was a coincidence.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office has yet to offer any deal on two
federal indictments faced by Kilgore, who lived for years in a Cape
Town suburb under the alias Charles William Pape.</TE>
<TE>   Kilgore had been on the run since 1975. He vanished shortly before
he was indicted on two counts of allegedly possessing a destructive
device after authorities recovered explosives at a Symbionese
Liberation Army hide-out near San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Kilgore also was indicted on a charge of making false
statements in connection with a passport application.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, he faces 10 years' imprisonment and a $10,000 fine
on the bomb charge and another five years and a $250,000 fine on the
passport charge. He must face the federal explosives indictment
before answering the state's murder charge.</TE>
<TE>   In the courtroom Friday, Kilgore responded to questions from Judge
Zimmerman in a low voice. When asked for his identity, he replied,
"James William Kilgore, your honor." And when asked his age, he
hesitated and responded, "Um, 55." To which the judge retorted:
"Certainly not a juvenile."</TE>
<TE>   In requesting that Kilgore be held without bail, U.S. Atty. Kevin
Ryan called the ex-fugitive "an extreme flight risk and an extreme
danger to society." Lawyers representing Kilgore have disputed that
characterization, saying their client was surrendering to authorities
when he was taken into custody at his suburban home by South African
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The last of the known Symbionese Liberation Army members to emerge
from hiding, Kilgore was raised in Marin County, and graduated from
UC Santa Barbara in 1969 before hooking up with the radical group.</TE>
<TE>   After fleeing the U.S. in 1975, Kilgore taught school in Zimbabwe
and earned a doctorate through correspondence courses.</TE>
<TE>   He spent several years as a neo-Marxist researcher and activist,
gaining a reputation for raw energy and vision. More recently, he was
an instructor at the University of Cape Town.</TE>
<TE>   In attendance at the court hearing were two American college
professors who knew Kilgore as "John Pape," a committed South African
activist and member of the South African National Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Roxanne Dunbar Ortiz, an ethnic studies professor at Cal State
Hayward, knew Kilgore; the fugitive's American wife, Terry; and the
couple's two sons while living in South Africa. She said she was
disappointed in the South African and American governments.</TE>
<TE>   "Especially in the new South Africa, a nation where truth and
reconciliation is now the norm, he should have been given amnesty
years ago. It should have happened in the Carter administration," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   A UC Santa Cruz instructor, Frank Wilderson III, said he had
worked on numerous causes with Kilgore, and questioned the decision
by the South African government to participate in his capture.</TE>
<TE>   "I know this man as a South African hero," he said outside the
courtroom. "And this is no way for any country to treat one of its
heroes."</TE>

<HD>Former San Joaquin County Supervisor Indicted on Federal
Corruption Charges</HD>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Former San Joaquin County Supervisor Lynn Bedford was indicted
Thursday on federal corruption charges, including allegations that he
took part in a conspiracy to commit extortion against an energy
company.</LD>
<LD>   The grand jury also issued additional charges against Monte
McFall, a former San Joaquin County sheriff's deputy and water board
member facing mail fraud, attempted extortion and witness-tampering
allegations.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, the jury returned a 19-count superseding indictment
accusing McFall and Bedford of conspiring to commit extortion against
Calpine Corp., which bid to build a power plant at the Port of
Stockton.</LD>
<TE>   According to federal prosecutors, McFall and Bedford told Calpine
in May 2001 to withdraw its bid to build the plant so that another
company, Sunlaw Energy Corp., would get the project.</TE>
<TE>   McFall, 56, threatened to drum up opposition to a Calpine project
in Alameda County if the company didn't pick another site in San
Joaquin County for the plant, federal prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Sunlaw had agreed to pay McFall and his partners as much as $2
million as a commission for the project, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   After Calpine refused to withdraw, the San Joaquin County Board of
Supervisors scolded Calpine officials and passed a resolution
proposed by Bedford opposing the plant's construction in Alameda
County.</TE>
<TE>   Bedford also is accused of lying to FBI agents about being unaware
of any financial arrangement between McFall and Sunlaw and that
McFall had not raised campaign money for him.</TE>

Gorman. Another Pacific storm is expected to drop as much as an inch
of rain on Los Angeles today. The weather system will cover local
mountains with six to eight inches of snow, according to the National
Weather Service. Mountain areas will be mostly cloudy through Sunday,
with a lingering chance of rain and snow. The next chance of rain in
the Los Angeles Basin is forecast for Thursday or Friday.</CP>

<HD>Injured Infant's Family Seeks Payment</HD>
<DH>Parents file $30-million claim against city of L.A. after
being hit by car fleeing police.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Guccione</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The family of a 5-week-old infant whose left arm was severed in a car
crash stemming from a high-speed police pursuit asked the city of Los
Angeles for $30 million Friday for the injuries they suffered,
including emotional distress.</LD>
<LD>   The parents of Harley Medellin are seeking $25 million for their
son's injuries plus $5 million for themselves, according to a legal
claim filed on behalf of the family. The claim is the first step
toward filing a lawsuit against the city and the Los Angeles Police
Department.</LD>
<LD>   The city has 45 days to either accept or reject the claim by Henry
Medellin, 32, and his wife, Victoria, 30. If it is rejected, the
Medellins can sue for damages.</LD>
<TE>   An attorney for the city said he had not seen the claim and
declined comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Medellin vehicle was sideswiped Dec. 3 by a car fleeing police
during a brief, high-speed pursuit in Sylmar. Seven people were
injured, including the infant.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Los Angeles police officials have debated the
department's pursuit policy, with Chief William J. Bratton calling
for a ban on chases that begin as a result of minor infractions. In
this case, officers were pursuing suspects wanted in connection with
a stabbing a few minutes earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The Medellins are seeking compensation for their physical injuries
and the emotional distress they suffered while witnessing the events
that led to the severing of their son's arm above the elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Harley was released Tuesday from Childrens Hospital Los Angeles.
The release was a week later than anticipated because the baby was
suffering from seizures, said Stephen C. Mancini, the Medellins'
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   The family's claim alleges that the officers "conducted a pursuit
with a complete, total and deliberate disregard for the safety of the
public, exercising grossly negligent and reckless judgment during a 2
1/2-minute pursuit."</TE>
<TE>   "It may have been a legitimate chase because the police were
chasing a suspected felon," said Mancini, "but we question the
judgment of police to begin a chase in a residential school zone at
2:40 in the afternoon without activating their lights and sirens."</TE>
<TE>   The parents want a new state law making it easier for victims to
recover monetary damages from police agencies that initiate pursuits,
Mancini said.</TE>
<TE>   "And they want it to be called the Harley Medellin law," the
attorney added.</TE>

<HD>Roof in a Fix, Tenants Get Rained Out</HD>
<DH>40 Athens residents are left homeless as storm catches
apartment complex in disrepair.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Hernandez and Carla Rivera</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forty residents of an Athens-area apartment building were rousted
from their beds in the middle of the night and left temporarily
homeless early Friday, when heavy rains poured through unfinished
roof repairs and caused extensive flooding and damage.</LD>
<LD>   The tenants had complained about the conditions for weeks, and the
latest storm finally caught officials' attention. It was too late,
however, for the residents to celebrate Christmas at home and keep
their holiday gifts from getting soaked.</LD>
<LD>   County officials were working to find accommodations for the
mostly low-income tenants -- many of them women and young children --
until repairs at the building in the 1400 block of West 105th Street
can be completed, possibly as long as a month.</LD>
<TE>   And because some of the residents do not own cars, they will be
without transportation to jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Shirley Flemings said she first noticed dripping about 11 p.m. the
previous evening. She awoke at 2 a.m. with rain pouring into her
upstairs bedroom from cracks in the ceiling, windows and light
sockets.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard neighbors slamming doors and shouting," said Flemings, a
mother of two who has lived in the building for three years. "We
stood outside because it was raining more inside the building. We
made coffee and tried to comfort each other."</TE>
<TE>   There has been little cheer in this holiday season for the
waterlogged tenants. The flooding Friday is the latest in a series of
misfortunes related to extensive roofing and plumbing repairs that
began before Thanksgiving. Tenants say previous wet weather caused
flooding that left fungus and mushrooms growing from the carpets,
soaked beds and couches and soggy Christmas trees.</TE>
<TE>   Despite complaints, county health and housing officials previously
had said that the building repairs would not require the tenants to
relocate. After Friday's rains, though, fire officials determined
that water pouring through electrical outlets posed a safety hazard.</TE>
<TE>   County officials now say they will cite the building's owner for
health and safety code violations.</TE>
<TE>   "The units are completely flooded," said Los Angeles County
environmental health specialist Scott Abbott, who inspected the
building. "The wall materials, carpeting, floors are completely
saturated. Every tenant's personal belongings are damaged as well as
the structure. The owner will have to take steps to eliminate mold
growth and hazards due to lead paint before it can be reoccupied."</TE>
<TE>   Building owner Nancy Wilson, a Las Vegas resident, defended her
own efforts and those of the contractors.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to do a good thing, I'm trying to better the place for
people to live," Wilson said in a phone conversation. "I wanted my
tenants to have a perfect apartment complex to live in before
Christmas, that was my goal. Who knew it was going to storm? Those
workers were up there at 2 in the morning to make sure stuff wouldn't
get wet."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson received a $205,000 federal rehabilitation loan through the
county Community Development Commission for the renovations, said
commission spokesman Calvin Naito.</TE>
<TE>   Workers began tearing up the roof early last month, but discovered
damage in its interior layers, said Kishore "Kevin" Kaul, owner of
the Brea-based contracting firm KDMG. Kaul said his firm offered to
relocate tenants early in the week, but told them they would have to
pay for hotel rooms and be reimbursed. Only two tenants took him up
on the offer, he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, workers struggled late into the evening to put up a
layer of fiberglass and plastic tarps in anticipation of the coming
storm, said Kaul.</TE>
<TE>   "We put up 12,000 square feet of material, and we thought it would
hold," he said.</TE>
<TE>   By midday Friday, tenants, many who had not slept all night, were
still trying to retrieve personal belongings that were not drenched.</TE>
<TE>   Shameka Foster was taking stock of the damage: a computer too
soaked to even try to turn on, furniture drenched through to its
stuffing, nearly all of her children's clothing wet.</TE>
<TE>   A bookkeeper who was able to take Friday off, she worried most
about how the disruption would affect her children, 9-year-old Tyler,
2 1/2-year-old Marquesha and especially 2-month-old son Terron.</TE>
<TE>   "He's brand new and doesn't know what's going on," said Foster.
'It's my baby's first Christmas, and this has messed that all up."</TE>
<TE>   Sheila Rice, mother of two girls, one age 5 and the other 10
months old, was almost in tears wondering what she would do with her
third baby -- 6-month-old house cat Smokey.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't sit up and worry about him when I have to take care of my
kids," said Rice, snuggling Smokey. "I guess I'll try to find someone
in the neighborhood to give him to. It's going to be hard, though,
because we don't know how long we'll have to be gone."</TE>

<HD>Community Raises Over $5,000 for Child's Funeral</HD>
<DH>Nine-year-old Oxnard student Sarahi Cuecuecha, who died of
leukemia, will be buried in Mexico.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandra Murillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The parents of a 9-year-old Oxnard girl who bravely fought leukemia
before dying Monday have raised enough money to have her buried in
their hometown in central Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   People touched by Sarahi Cuecuecha's two-year struggle against the
blood disease have donated more than the $3,200 the family needed for
the funeral and to ship the body home.</LD>
<LD>   "To be honest, I was surprised by the tremendous outpouring of
support and generosity," said Oxnard Elementary School District Supt.
Richard Duarte. "I was overjoyed at the feeling that everyone wanted
to help."</LD>
<TE>   The district's educational foundation headed the brief
fund-raising effort that had generated more than $5,000 in
contributions by Friday. Donations ranged from $30 by Sarahi's
classmates and $400 by Pictsweet farm workers to $800 by school
district officials. Three people have offered to match the total of
all donations, Duarte said.</TE>
<TE>   Other donations included change collected from children's savings
and $500 from Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles, where Sarahi had
been treated before she fell gravely ill at home Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The girl's family is grateful for the outpouring of kindness, said
Sarahi's aunt, Marcela Vega. "This is a very difficult time for them,
and I can't even imagine how much they're hurting," Vega said. "But
[the mother] feels very grateful. She is thankful so many people
helped out."</TE>
<TE>   Family, friends, teachers and schoolmates were expected to say a
rosary Friday evening before the child's body is transported Saturday
to the village of Panzacola north of Mexico City, Vega said.</TE>

<HD>Cameras to Monitor Washington Demonstrations</HD>
<DH>Police are ready to use automated surveillance devices at
two events next month. Officials defend the plan, while critics decry
intrusion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Police intend to use more than a dozen automated surveillance cameras
to keep an eye on large demonstrations planned in the nation's
capital next month.</LD>
<LD>   The cameras, monitored at police command centers, will keep tabs
on antiwar protests planned for the weekend of Jan. 18-19 and the
Jan. 22 "March for Life," an antiabortion demonstration to mark the
30th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said Friday they were publicizing the plans to comply
with an ordinance passed in November by the District of Columbia
Council. It requires advanced public notice when the tactic is to be
used.</LD>
<TE>   "The major advantage is to deploy police resources if you see any
problems developing, if you need more people one place or fewer
people another place," said Councilwoman Kathleen Patterson.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the notice provision, district law requires that signs be
posted to inform the public that certain areas in or near downtown
Washington can be under camera surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the police ought to be taking video of peaceful
demonstrators when there's no hint of lawbreaking," said Art Spitzer,
legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union's National
Capital Area Chapter. The ACLU worries that cameras will deter
participation in what they see as expressions of 1st Amendment rights
to freedom of speech, association and expression.</TE>
<TE>   Police concede they have no information to indicate any plans for
civil disobedience or violence.</TE>
<TE>   The cameras transmit images of the areas they are trained on and
are not connected to videotaping equipment. Kevin Morison, spokesman
for the Metropolitan Police Department, said the cameras do not
employ face recognition or biometrics technology to help identify
specific individuals.</TE>
<TE>   "Big events like this that attract people to the nation's capital
could either themselves become targets of terrorists, or terrorists
could use those major events as cover to launch some sort of attack,"
Morison said.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect tens of thousands of people to be coming out Jan. 18 to
oppose this war drive," said Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, a lawyer with
the Partnership for Civil Justice, a nonprofit lawyers' group. "We
hear from people who are outraged by the surveillance cameras."</TE>
<TE>   For nearly 30 years, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arlington, Va.,
and the archdioceses of Baltimore and Washington have organized at
least 10,000 young people each year for the "March for Life" on the
Mall.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad that the government would feel we're at a point" at
which cameras are required, said Susan Gibbs, spokeswoman for the
Archdiocese of Washington. "We're in a time of great national
distress, and we do need to trust in our government."</TE>

<LD>It seems that no matter what the Clippers do, the Lakers do it
bigger, more dramatically, to greater notice.</LD>
<LD>   Those feel-good Clipper seasons quickly were forgotten once the
Lakers began their championship push, and now the national debate
about what's wrong with the Lakers has overshadowed the Clippers' own
disappointing start.</LD>
<LD>   Not only have the Clippers failed to meet the high expectations
for 2002-03, they're behind last season's 39-43 pace.</LD>
<TE>   Why? The "in" things. Injuries, inexperience and an inability to
win the close games.</TE>
<TE>   And don't forget the interminably long absence of Lamar Odom.
Chief among the injuries that derailed their training camp and have
cost them 89 games of service so far are the lingering injuries that
have kept Odom from wearing a uniform for anything other than photo
day.</TE>
<TE>   A few players in the locker room will remind you that the team is
missing the guy who only a year ago was considered their leader and
best player.</TE>
<TE>   "He just has a certain swagger about him that carries over to the
whole team," point guard Keyon Dooling said. "He's a special player."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers say that against Golden State on Dec. 28 Odom will
return from the ankle and wrist injuries that cut his season short
after 29 game last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm even thinking of coming back on the 27th [at Phoenix]," Odom
said Friday night. "I might not put too much pressure on myself on
the road."</TE>
<TE>   After he does come back, then what? If Shaquille O'Neal wasn't
enough to fix the Lakers, can Odom snap the Clippers out of their
sputtering ways? Can Odom be counted on to do anything?</TE>
<TE>   The league already busted him for not following through on his
drug rehabilitation program, and the Clippers thought he didn't stick
to his injury rehabilitation program diligently enough in the
off-season. In Odom style, he didn't show up for Friday night's game
against Phoenix. He said he went to the airport to pick up his kids,
then got into a minor car accident, so he decided to head home.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Odom and the Clippers need to grow up. The question is,
will they be given the time to mature?</TE>
<TE>   It's too early to give up on this season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's coming along," Odom said, when reached by telephone. "We
haven't been able to get on the court together because of injuries.
By mid-January, you're going to see this team jell."</TE>
<TE>   It will be up to Donald Sterling to keep this team together for
its fruition. Nothing happens overnight in the NBA. It usually
requires years and years of failure and frustrating before it gets
right.</TE>
<TE>   It took the Laker core of Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Robert
Horry, Rick Fox and Derek Fisher four years before they won a
championship.</TE>
<TE>   If you want to talk about teams that are actually winning games
these days, Chris Webber, Vlade Divac and Peja Stojakovic have been
together in Sacramento for five years, and it's the fifth year of the
Steve Nash-Michael Finley-Dirk Nowitzki crew in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, it's possible that Odom's career in L.A. is down to
about 55 games. He'll be a restricted free agent this summer (if he
receives another offer, the Clippers can retain him by matching it),
giving him about 3 1/2 months to show his stuff.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody in the league knows I can play," Odom said. "I'm not
auditioning. I'm trying to win games for the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   "[The contract] is really not important now. What's important is
trying to win games for the Clippers. I'm not trying to play
Nostradamus and see what's going to happen next."</TE>
<TE>   When Odom does return to action, it will have been more than 11
months since his last NBA game.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that the one thing I want our guys to avoid -- and the
people in general to avoid -- is to think he's going to step on the
court and be the same player that he was before he got hurt," Clipper
Coach Alvin Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to talk to him about it and make sure that it's not going
to happen overnight. You can't sit out of baseball for a year and
think you're going to be able to hit an off-speed pitch or a fastball
in the major leagues. You can't be a quarterback and sit out for a
year in the NFL and think you can throw out routes to Jerry Rice.
It's an adjustment to get back. He's got to understand that."</TE>
<TE>   Dooling missed almost all last season with an ankle injury.</TE>
<TE>   "There's several things that's hard," about coming back, Dooling
said. "For one, getting over the injury, trying to tell your mind
that your body's better. For two, timing. Three, just getting your
cardio back. Lamar's been working hard at it, so I think he'll be
fine."</TE>
<TE>   Don't expect too many home runs or touchdown passes from Odom.
Right now, the Clippers would settle for a guy who can give them
another low-post threat, a guy who can swing the basketball and
create one-on-one when the game slows down in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   More often than not, the Clippers can't answer the challenge in
crunch time.</TE>
<TE>   Only two Clippers know what it's like to play for a winning team
in the NBA: Sean Rooks with the Lakers in the late 1990s and Wang
Zhizhi with Dallas last year. Neither was on the court much during
crunch time.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't have a fourth-quarter lead to blow Friday night,
thanks to missed layups in the first half, errant jump shots in the
third quarter and no Elton Brand the entire game (strained right calf
injury).</TE>
<TE>   And so we wait for the maturation of this team to come, while
wondering how many of these players -- or Gentry -- will be around to
see it, searching for any sign of maturity.</TE>
<TE>   So how's the Christmas shopping coming, Lamar?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm all done," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It's a start.</TE>

<LD>   UC Santa Barbara (3-4) at Brigham Young (7-1), 4 p.m. PST, KEYT
(1250) -- A year ago the host Gauchos handed the Cougars a 68-58
loss. Santa Barbara returns with four starters and 10 lettermen from
that team, but this time around BYU, which is averaging 13,222
spectators each home game, has to be a big favorite. A Cougar victory
would give BYU its best start since the 1991-92 season. The Gauchos
have lost two straight and have a 1-4 road record. They've committed
56 turnovers in their last three games.</LD>
<LD>   UC Riverside (1-3) at San Diego (5-3), 7 p.m., KPRO (1570), KCBQ
(1170) -- This is a rematch of San Diego's 84-64 romp Nov. 30 at
Riverside. San Diego made 31 of 44 field goals and had five players
score in double figures. Freshman guard Nate Carter scored 16 points
for Riverside. The Highlanders have been in foul trouble all season.
They committed 30 in Tuesday's 79-74 loss at St. Mary's.</LD>
<TE>   CS Fullerton (1-6) at Sacramento State (4-4), 7:30 p.m., KWRM-AM
(1370) -- Fullerton hobbles onto the road for its next four games.
The Titans are without senior forward Brandon Campbell, who is out
indefinitely with a degenerative bone problem in his left ankle, and
junior forward Bron Groomes, who severely injured an ankle in the
Titans' 69-60 loss to Idaho State on Dec. 14. Center Pape Sow has a
sprained ankle and a sore wrist but is expected to play. Sacramento
has had its best start under third-year Coach Jerome Jenkins.</TE>
<TE>   -- Paul McLeod</TE>
<TE>   Montana (4-7) at Loyola Marymount (5-5), 7 p.m.-- The Lions are
hoping to shake the close-game blues after losing to Cal Poly San
Luis Obispo in overtime, 72-70, and Cal State Northridge, 74-71.
Forward Adam Osborn scored a career-high 23 points against
Northridge, but a late Lions' rally fell short. Montana grabbed the
national spotlight by beating Stanford, 70-68, but then lost to
Pepperdine, 86-69, in the championship of the Stanford Invitational.
Loyola Marymount defeated Montana, 65-62, at the Great Alaska
Shootout on Nov. 29.</TE>

<TE>   USC (5-4) at Colorado (7-1), 1 p.m. PST -- The Trojan offense got
a boost from Duke transfer Rometra Craig, who scored 18 points in her
USC debut against Southern Methodist. The 80 points USC scored
against SMU were more than the combined point totals against
Connecticut and Tennessee (73). Colorado has been idle since
defeating in-state rival Colorado State, 66-51, on Dec. 12. Junior
center Tera Bjorklund is the Buffaloes' leading scorer (18.8).</TE>
<TE>   Northridge (0-7) at UCLA (4-4), Pauley Pavilion, 2 p.m., KBET
(850) -- The Bruins have lost three straight, including Thursday's
89-77 decision to Baylor. But UCLA is also holding its breath on the
results of Friday's MRI of freshman forward Julia Pitts' injured left
knee. Northridge is more hungry for a victory than UCLA is. The
Matadors, now under first-year coach Tammy Holder, have lost 13
straight since Feb. 10. Junior forward Brezya Rhodes is the Matadors'
leading scorer (11.6).</TE>

<LD>Not every sports commentator wants Pete Rose in the Baseball Hall of
Fame.</LD>
<LD>   Writes Mark Madden of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: "Pete Rose can
never be reinstated by Major League Baseball. He can never be made
eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame. Any arguments contradicting
my views are based on emotion, not logic. For nothing even resembling
logic supports Rose's reinstatement."</LD>
<LD>   Steve Scholfield of the North County Times: "Why is Major League
Baseball even talking to Pete Rose? What has Rose done to merit
consideration for reinstatement? The answer is nothing.</LD>
<TE>   "A guy can be racist (Ty Cobb), a womanizer (Babe Ruth) or a
fall-down drunk (Mickey Mantle) and get into Cooperstown. Rose broke
the one cardinal rule in baseball -- he bet on games."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: How many Washington State players have been Rose Bowl
player of the game?</TE>
<TE>   Raider World: There is a mystique about the Raiders that seems to
permeate pro football. Ron Mix, a Pro Football Hall of Fame offensive
tackle, told Jerry Magee of the San Diego Union-Tribune about it.</TE>
<TE>   "When I am introduced to someone and the person introducing me
says, 'Ron played pro football,' I say, 'Ten years with the Chargers
and two with the Raiders.'</TE>
<TE>   "Invariably, the person I am meeting says, 'Wow! The Raiders!' "</TE>
<TE>   Self analysis: Denver Bronco quarterback Brian Griese, on the
Broncos having lost three consecutive home games: "No team that loses
three in a row deserves to be in the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   North of the border: Speedskater Catriona Le May Doan edged Dallas
Maverick guard Steve Nash in winning the Lou Marsh Trophy, given
annually to Canada's outstanding athlete.</TE>
<TE>   Also in Canada: The father of a 16-year-old is suing the New
Brunswick Amateur Hockey Assn., seeking $200,000 in psychological and
punitive damages for the harm done his son because he did not win the
league's most-valuable-player award.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Croteau said his son, Steven, the leading scorer in the
league, was so crushed he lost his desire to play.</TE>
<TE>   Asks Tom FitzGerald in the San Francisco Chronicle: "How could
hockey possibly recover from such a loss?"</TE>
<TE>   Big is better: Kansas City Chief Coach Dick Vermeil, on Leonard
Davis, Arizona's 372-pound tackle: "[He] is big enough to eat hay. He
is enormous. Sooner or later you've got to put in a law against guys
that size."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: One, fullback Carl Dietz, in 1916. He rushed for
105 yards and a touchdown in the rain as Washington State beat Brown,
14-0.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Former USC wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson knows how
to rate talent when he sees it.</TE>
<TE>   After Johnson had watched Trojan freshman receiver Mike Williams,
ESPN.com reported that the NFL star said, "He could become one of the
best receivers at USC, like the second-best receiver to play here."</TE>
<TE>   Could he have been thinking of Johnnie Morton as No. 1?</TE>

<LD>Luke Jackson had his second career triple-double with 14 points, 11
rebounds and 10 assists as No. 5 Oregon bounced back with a 107-66
romp over Florida A&amp;M on Friday night at Eugene, Ore.</LD>
<LD>   It was the third triple-double in Oregon history. Ron Lee had the
first in 1972 and Jackson had the second in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Luke Ridnour scored 21 points for Oregon (7-1), which won its 21st
straight at home, the fifth-longest streak in the country and
second-longest in school history. Florida A&amp;M is 3-4.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday night, Oregon lost, 77-52, to unranked Cincinnati at
East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   No. 21 Xavier 87, Ball State 58 -- David West watched most of the
first half from the bench because of two quick fouls but still
finished with a season-high 24 points as the Musketeers (6-2) beat
the Cardinals (5-4) at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve NBA scouts attended the game to watch West, who made 10 of
11 shots from the field, all but one of them on moves to the basket.
He also had nine rebounds for Xavier, which blew the game open with a
23-6 run to start the second half.</TE>

<HD>Clippers Run Out of Options</HD>
<DH>With Brand out too, they don't have enough to stay with the
Suns in 87-76 loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is the way it is when your power forward, your small forward and
your shooting guard are sitting out because of injuries, unable to
save their teammates from themselves.</LD>
<LD>   Considering all the Clippers were missing Friday, their 87-76 loss
to the Phoenix Suns before a grumpy crowd of 15,970 at Staples Center
was predictable.</LD>
<LD>   "We were not shorthanded," Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry insisted
after the game. "They had five guys and we had five guys [on the
floor]. We expect them to perform.... You've got to make shots. We
didn't make any shots. We had open shots."</LD>
<TE>   Soon, perhaps only a few days after their Christmas break, the
Clippers will be at full strength again. Maybe then their shots will
fall, their defense will be tighter and their competitive fire will
be rekindled.</TE>
<TE>   It probably won't be long before Elton Brand's strained right calf
will be sound again, although he won't play tonight against the
Denver Nuggets. Lamar Odom's badly sprained right ankle is about as
good as it's going to get, and he's expected to be back Dec. 28 for a
game against Golden State after an 11-month layoff. Eric Piatkowski's
lower abdominal strain most likely will be better soon.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, the Clippers must soldier on, as they did without much
success Friday against the Suns. The Clippers couldn't shoot,
couldn't defend and couldn't win, as Phoenix took control after a
12-0 run to start the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "That was very difficult to watch," said Brand, speaking on behalf
of the injured Clippers after the game. "It hurts missing the game,
period. But being down by 20 in the third quarter hurts too."</TE>
<TE>   Here's how bad it was: The Clippers (11-16) didn't pass the
50-point barrier until Wang Zhizhi made a three-point field goal with
9:55 remaining in the game. By then, the Suns led, 71-52, and were
well on their way to improving their record to 15-11.</TE>
<TE>   Or so it seemed.</TE>
<TE>   With reserves from both teams in the game, the Clippers fought
back. Wang had 13 of his 16 points in an 11-minute span and helped to
trim the deficit to 75-60 with a free throw with 5:51 left. Wang
finished with six-for-11 shooting in 17 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Marko Jaric, who led the Clippers with 18 points, nine assists and
seven rebounds, cut the Suns' lead to 75-62 with a dunk with 5:32 to
go.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, Staples crackled with energy.</TE>
<TE>   Another Jaric field goal got the Clippers within 75-64, but the
Suns kept a double-digit lead the rest of the way. Amare Stoudemire
all but ended the Clipper comeback with a rebound and a thunderous
dunk, then blocked Tremaine Fowlkes dunk attempt at the other end,
which led to Shawn Marion's dunk and an 83-69 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad we fought back," said Brand, the Clippers' leading
scorer and rebounder. "But it was tough to watch."</TE>
<TE>   Without Brand for the first time this season, Gentry turned to
rookie Chris Wilcox as his starting power forward. The Clippers lost
that matchup.</TE>
<TE>   Stoudemire, the high school standout the Suns selected ninth (one
spot behind Wilcox) in last June's draft, ended up scoring 18 points,
including a soaring dunk over Michael Olowokandi in the third
quarter, and took 11 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Marion had 20 points, and Stephon Marbury added 16.</TE>
<TE>   Stoudemire worked over Wilcox on the low block, particularly in
the first half. Stoudemire had nine points on four-for-seven shooting
and took six rebounds in 20 minutes in the first half. Wilcox had six
points on two-for-four shooting and one rebound in 13 minutes in
half.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't have the body of an 18-year-old," Gentry said of
Stoudemire. "He plays with confidence. He plays extremely hard.
They've got themselves a heck of a ballplayer."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers stayed close through the first quarter, believing
they had tied the score, at 23-23, after Quentin Richardson's layup
at the buzzer. After a video review, the shot was nullified and the

<HD>McGriff Becomes Dodgers' First Choice</HD>
<DH>Veteran free agent with 478 home runs fills a hole left by
trade of Karros, and more important to Evans, he fits in L.A.'s
budget at $3.75 million. All he needs to do is pass a physical next
week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers on Friday agreed in principle with veteran first baseman
Fred McGriff on a one-year, $3.75-million contract, a bargain price
for one of baseball's most dependable power hitters and a comfortable
fit into the team's complicated payroll structure.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a terrific fit for both sides," Dodger General Manager Dan
Evans said. "He really wanted to play for us and be with a
competitive club, and we add a veteran presence who has been one of
baseball's most consistent run-producers. Clearly, he's a guy who
made a lot of sense for us."</LD>
<LD>   With about $5 million to spend for a hitter to replace departed
first baseman Eric Karros, the Dodgers pursued both Cliff Floyd --
who agreed to a four-year, $26-million deal with the New York Mets on
Friday -- and McGriff, 39, who has a .286 career average with 478
home runs and 1,503 runs batted in.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers offered Floyd a three-year, $15.5-million deal, which
would have pushed them to the edge of the new $117-million luxury tax
threshold, but McGriff's relatively small deal, which is contingent
on his passing a physical next Friday, leaves the Dodgers with
another $1 million to pursue a left-handed reliever.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Dodgers won't have to give up a first-round draft
pick -- Floyd would have cost them such a prospect -- they'll have
far more payroll flexibility in 2004 and 2005, and though McGriff is
no Gold Glove candidate, he is an experienced first baseman. Had
Floyd, a corner outfielder, signed with the Dodgers, he would have
moved to first base, a position he has been reluctant to play.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a situation we prefer," Evans said. "We can make more
moves in the trade and free-agent markets now. Some of the other
situations we explored would have really limited us."</TE>
<TE>   McGriff, who has never been on a big league disabled list, made
$7.25 million last season with the Chicago Cubs, who declined to
exercise an $8.5-million option on McGriff for 2003 and did not offer
him arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   Though the five-time All-Star has averaged 30 homers and 94 RBIs
in his career and knocked in 102 runs or more in five of the last
seven seasons, there was a tepid market for him this winter. So,
McGriff settled for a deal that will pay about half what he made last
season.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'll be fine, I don't have any problem with that," McGriff
said by phone from his Tampa home. "It's a real tough market right
now, but that's cool. I'll just chalk it up to experience."</TE>
<TE>   McGriff, a five-time All-Star who won a World Series championship
with the Atlanta Braves in 1995, has made millions in his career, and
money -- much to the Dodgers' appreciation --wasn't his top priority
this winter.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking for a team with tradition, a team that has a chance
to win, that's the main thing," McGriff said. "The Dodgers are a
great organization, and they've won a few championships. They had a
decent team last year -- they won 92 games -- hopefully we can win a
few more next year. I'm excited."</TE>
<TE>   McGriff will never be confused with J.T. Snow defensively -- he
has limited range and has trouble digging balls in the dirt -- but
his bat has shown no signs of slowing in recent years, and he should
be a considerable offensive upgrade over Karros, who was traded with
second baseman Mark Grudzielanek to the Cubs.</TE>
<TE>   After a slow start, McGriff hit .273 with 30 homers and 103 RBIs
last season, batting .304 with runners in scoring position. He had a
.353 on-base percentage, with 63 walks and 99 strikeouts, and a .505
slugging percentage. Dodger first basemen combined for a .405
slugging percentage, 14 homers and 91 RBIs last season.</TE>
<TE>   McGriff feasted on right-handers, hitting .296 with 28 home runs
against them, and struggled against left-handers, batting .213 with
two homers in 141 at-bats against them. But the Dodgers can use
right-handed hitting Mike Kinkade at first base against tougher
left-handers.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who ranked 11th in the National League in home runs
and 15th in on-base percentage, hit .299 against left-handers but
.253 against right-handers last season. With McGriff's left-handed
bat added to a lineup that includes Shawn Green, Evans believes the
Dodgers will have more success against right-handers.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers will also have a major milestone to market next
season. McGriff, who has a .303 average with 10 homers and 37 RBIs in
50 career postseason games, is 22 home runs shy of 500, an
achievement that only 17 others have reached and will make him a
strong Hall of Fame candidate.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first started playing, my goal was to just play in the big
leagues," McGriff said. "I started having some success, hit some home
runs, and one thing led to another. I've been blessed with good
health -- that's the main thing. I work out, stay in shape, and if
you play every day, you always have a chance."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brad Mills, who managed triple-A Las Vegas to an 85-59 record last
season, has left the Dodgers to become Montreal's bench coach under
Manager Frank Robinson.... The Dodgers are still pursuing a trade for
Florida center fielder Abraham Nunez, a multi-tooled prospect who has
only 19 games of big league experience, but have had little luck
prying the right-handed hitter from the Marlins.... Among the new
batch of free agents who could interest the Dodgers are pitcher Paul
Wilson, who was not tendered a contract by Tampa Bay, and utility
infielder Frank Catalanotto, who was not offered a contract by Texas.</TE>

<HD>Last Drop Isn't Good</HD>
<DH>Bryant scores 44, but botched play between Fox, Horry in
overtime leads to 107-104 Laker loss to the 76ers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Their chance -- at the end of 53 minutes, of 28 games, of two months
misspent -- fell out of bounds and the crowd that breathed down their
necks for three hours went hysterical and Rick Fox let his head fall
lightly to Robert Horry's shoulder.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers had played hard enough Friday night to see glimpses of
what they had intended all along, well enough to beat the
Philadelphia 76ers despite some old familiar flaws, which, it turns
out, were preferable to the new ones.</LD>
<LD>   They didn't win. The play that was to free Fox for a layup in
fact, raised their hopes but not their standing, and concluded in
victory for the 76ers, 107-104, in overtime at First Union Center.</LD>
<TE>   At the end of Kobe Bryant's 44 points and 10 assists, of Allen
Iverson's 32 points, of Shaquille O'Neal's 26 points and 14 rebounds
and six missed free throws in the fourth quarter, two that might have
won it with 31.1 seconds left, Fox was open and Horry saw him. The
Lakers trailed, 105-104, Iverson had missed two free throws to give
them the break they'd sought since that fourth quarter against
Dallas, and now Fox was running through the lane, the ball rushing to
him.</TE>
<TE>   "It was here," Fox said, holding his hands to his right ear, "then
I had to try and catch it quick, and it was hard."</TE>
<TE>   A little too hard, maybe. A little behind him, maybe. There to be
caught, for sure, and turned into the layup that might not have ended
the struggle, but give them a moment's rest from it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's 50-50," Horry said. "Hopefully, he could have batted it down
and laid it up. That's the only way I could get it to him."</TE>
<TE>   It did not matter which, because Fox could not hold it. He closed
his eyes and Horry turned and screamed at the ceiling and the 76ers
celebrated. Something close to the real Lakers had shown up, for the
first time in weeks, longer, and the 76ers had sent them off to
Toronto, for the last of a four-game trip, with a 10-18 record, 2-13
on the road, losing still, no matter how close.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt like a big playoff game," Iverson said. "I'm talking
about a playoff game where the series was tied or something. It was
nice."</TE>
<TE>   While the 76ers moved into first place alone in the Atlantic
Division, past the New Jersey Nets who defeated the Lakers the night
before, the Lakers scrounged again for less material wonders, having
fallen into last in the Pacific Division.</TE>
<TE>   They played with ferocity, only to have O'Neal miss those free
throws, then foul out 59 seconds into the overtime. O'Neal's new
open-door policy -- he spoke to reporters before the game -- did not
extend to the postgame explanation.</TE>
<TE>   They played with tautness, only to have four turnovers in
overtime, the critical one off Fox, only to have the 76ers score 37
points in the third quarter, and only to have their bench score six
points in 61 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Still, this was the effort they sought. Booed again in his
hometown, Bryant made 16 of 35 shots and was the best player on the
floor. O'Neal was surly and quicker to the rim. Derek Fisher hung as
best he could with Iverson, though it was Bryant who took him for key
possessions in the fourth quarter. They came back from 10 points down
in the fourth quarter to force the overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "If we play like we played tonight, we're going to win a lot of
games," Fox said. "It was encouraging."</TE>
<TE>   Then it became one play the Lakers could not make.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't Rick's fault," Coach Phil Jackson said in a postgame
news conference. "We knew they would jump to Kobe. Robert just had to
pass the ball on an angle like that because of the pressure he was
receiving."</TE>
<TE>   They found themselves in a place rife with memories of their
three-peat, having won three of those 12 Finals games in this very
arena in 2001, against a team thick with a mix of their last two
Finals foes, Iverson and Eric Snow and Aaron McKie threaded through
Keith Van Horn and Todd MacCulloch.</TE>
<TE>   They spent six weeks trying to draw out the occasional good
quarter into four. Progress, on one night, was playing through the
one bad one.</TE>
<TE>   For a night, most of it, their legs were back. Their heads were
back with their legs. For most of it.</TE>
<TE>   "We played in spurts very well," Bryant said, and that would have
to be close enough. Again.</TE>

<HD>Is Dorrell Best Choice or Simply Cheapest?</HD>

<LD>Karl Dorrell could not be a better choice as the next head coach at
UCLA. He brings intangibles that Bob Toledo never had. He understands
what UCLA is all about and can sell it to recruits. I recently sent
my ticket to the Washington State game back to Mr. Guerrero and urged
others to do the same. When can I order my season tickets for 2003?</LD>
<LD>   Alan Yudman</LD>
<LD>   North Hollywood</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'm sure Karl Dorrell is a great guy and all that, but let him cut
his teeth at, say, East Carolina or San Diego State. UCLA should
reconsider this ill-thought-out plan, and hire a coach who has
already proven himself at the Division I-A level, not one who will
require years of on-the-job training. I predict Bob Toledo will be
remembered fondly by this time next year.</TE>
<TE>   Rusty Austin</TE>
<TE>   Culver City</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's very exciting to get a coach who will bring us back to the
great days of Terry Donahue. I am sure Mr. Guerrero is looking
forward to increasing winning percentage from the .605 of Bob Toledo
to the .665 of Donahue.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, the good old days of the Rose Bowl filled to the UCLA capacity
of 35,000 fans, all leaving early, are coming back. I bet every major
school in the country is trembling from the fear of having to play
UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   The tradition of mediocrity continues.</TE>
<TE>   Earl Longly</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For 20 years, I've believed reports that Peter Dalis and now Dan
Guerrero hired coaches for the UCLA athletic programs. Now I know the
truth. The appointment of yet another inexperienced, inexpensive,
unqualified head coach, the unwillingness to spend money for quality,
and the acceptance of mediocrity by the department make it obvious.
The man calling the shots in Westwood is ... Donald Sterling.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Stock</TE>
<TE>   Calabasas</TE>

you, Chancellor Carnesale, Pete Blackman and Dan Guerrero for the
early Christmas present.</TE>

<LD>Bill Plaschke [Dec. 18] is absolutely right in saying that Pete Rose
belongs in the Hall of Fame. He has more hits than anyone who ever
played the game, more rings than my bathtub and would have been a
unanimous first-ballot choice if it weren't for that gambling habit.</LD>
<LD>   I just checked with Cooperstown and they tell me that it's called
the Baseball Hall of Fame and not the Ethics Hall of Fame, the
Integrity Hall of Fame or even the Likability Hall of Fame.</LD>
<LD>   However, I understand that Pete's laying five to two against being
elected before 2005.</LD>
<TE>   Allen E. Kahn</TE>

<TE>   Not only does Pete Rose need help with his gambling problem, Bill
Plaschke needs help with his logic problem.</TE>
<TE>   He wants Rose to be made an exception. That's just the problem;
Rose always has considered himself to be the exception. The rule
never applied to him.</TE>
<TE>   Plaschke says Rose's induction into the Hall of Fame weakens
Rose's cause. Rose's cause is induction into the Hall of Fame. It
would be his ultimate triumph.</TE>

<HD>Carson Palmer Goes to Head of Class</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carson Palmer should be congratulated, not only for his outstanding
performance on the field this year as USC's quarterback, but also for
the manner in which he conducted himself during his five years at
USC.</LD>
<LD>   During some difficult times early in his career, he never
complained. He stayed the course, worked very hard to improve his
game and remained committed to USC for his entire football
eligibility. He always conducted himself with class and dignity as a
player and in his acceptance of the Heisman award.</LD>
<LD>   He has made the Trojan family as well as all Southland fans very
proud.</LD>
<TE>   Frank R. Gamberdella</TE>
<TE>   Professor, Keck School of Medicine, USC</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a former Trojan football player, I watched in delight the
announcement of another one of our own as the winner of the Heisman
Trophy. Congratulations to Carson Palmer and the entire football team
and staff this year. I was struck by Carson's quote, "I think it was
the Notre Dame game. If anyone else was playing in that game, maybe
they would have gotten the trophy."</TE>
<TE>   Reading this quote made me think of another 31-point victory over
Notre Dame, when 28 years ago, No. 28, Anthony Davis scored more
touchdowns than even Carson did. Anthony Davis, my teammate and my
friend, should have won the Heisman Trophy that year, but he didn't.
Instead, it was given to Ohio State junior Archie Griffin, another
great running back and former teammate of mine with the Cincinnati
Bengals.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it was Anthony's style. He liked to talk a little smack, but
he backed up every word. Or maybe it was the fact that the Heisman
vote took place that year before the Notre Dame game was played.
Either way, AD still likes to talk a little smack, and I'm glad the
Heisman voters count the final game of the season now, for Carson
Palmer and for USC football.</TE>
<TE>   Marvin Cobb</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Bill Plaschke's column of Dec. 17, he refers to Ken Dorsey's
"mediocre personal statistics" giving way to the Carson Palmer
numerical tidal wave. Dorsey's numbers actually compare reasonably
well to Palmer's. We should celebrate Carson Palmer's talent and
teamwork without depreciating Ken Dorsey's very impressive
achievements.</TE>

<LD>Aren't those Clippers just three-quarters awesome? Aren't they

wishful, but I expect them to three-quarters qualify for the

three-quarters of that would be ... 30 1/2 wins. Yes, I think we are

<LD>Here's a Phil-osphical question. If Phil Jackson just stopped showing
up on the Laker bench, would anybody notice?</LD>
<LD>   Gary Schwind</LD>
<LD>   Huntington Beach</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a former Chicagoan now in L.A. for some time, I can only
chuckle at the drubbing Phil Jackson and his Lakers get.</TE>
<TE>   How can anything negative be said about a man who brings you three
championships in the only three years he has coached the team?</TE>
<TE>   Phil not "really coaching?"</TE>
<TE>   Maybe as an ex-player and 10-time NBA champion, he has an
understanding of the excruciatingly long haul that the NBA season can
be.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq "should have had his surgery sooner?"</TE>
<TE>   So, Shaq wanted time off after his third championship in a row.
Doesn't he deserve it? Michael Jordan retired after winning three
titles.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Shaq knows how to pace himself and store energy for crunch
time? Maybe he, not us, has some idea of how to go about winning the
Finals and, oh, I don't know, maybe the MVP trophy.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Buss is "cheap"? Isn't this the guy who put the cash
together to bring Shaq and then Phil to L.A.?</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson should be thought of as a god in this town. All Laker
fans should be following Jerry Buss' lead by offering up their
daughters to him in deference to his greatness.</TE>
<TE>   It's a long time between dynasties.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Campbell</TE>
<TE>   Glendale</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a Laker fan going on 22 years, it pains me to say the
following: It's no fun watching the Lakers anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, the losing has a lot to do with it, but there's more to
it than that. It's the way they're losing. Completely devoid of
urgency or enthusiasm. No competitive fire to speak of, nothing to
leave out there on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   I came through the pitiful Randy Pfund era still bleeding purple
and gold, which means I'll never stop watching. But if the team
continues to play with this same carelessness, this same lack of
passion, then I'll probably start greeting wins with a sense of
relief, not a feeling of joy.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe I'm already doing that.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Zemanek</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Memo to the Lakers: Now is the time to start defending what is
yours and displaying this "heart of a champion" you so freely claim
to own exclusively.</TE>
<TE>   As a lifelong Laker fan, I will continue to support the team
through good times and bad. However, if this team continues down its
current path, continues to cry, complain and make excuses like the
schoolyard bully who finally got punched in the nose, then I'm afraid
it will risk tarnishing the legitimacy of all it has accomplished
during this current title run.</TE>
<TE>   And I, for one, could not stand to listen to Rick Adelman utter
the word "asterisk" in reference to past Laker championships.</TE>

club embarrassed a city and themselves like these Lakers.</TE>

<HD>It's a Little Early for Dodger Optimism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've always been fascinated by the L.A. Times sportswriters' attempts
to convince their readers that the hapless Dodgers will somehow
challenge Arizona, San Francisco and the rest of the National League
West.</LD>
<LD>   This week, Jason Reid wrote a piece regarding the Diamondbacks'
acquisition of pitcher Elmer Dressens. Jason wrote, " ... completing
a deal that could help the Diamondbacks hold off the Dodgers in the
National League West next season."</LD>
<LD>   Hold off the Dodgers? Jason, wake up and smell the resin bags! The
Dodgers were a factor in the National League West 14 years ago, the
last time they won a playoff game. Last year they finished in third
place in a five-team division and accomplished that with the highest
payroll in the division.</LD>
<TE>   I realize the L.A. media must hype the Dodgers each year to
stimulate some fan interest, but Jason, save it for April, not
December.</TE>
<TE>   William Michael</TE>
<TE>   Dana Point</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As the Dodgers attempt to add some needed offense to their team,
the major priority was stated quite succinctly by General Manager Dan
Evans. While discussing the pursuit of free-agent outfielder Cliff
Floyd, Evans said, "The biggest factor is how a guy fits into our
payroll structure."</TE>
<TE>   What happened to home runs and RBIs?</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Muramatsu</TE>
<TE>   Cerritos</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So the Dodgers are having trouble filling some holes due to
financial restraints, yet no word from Darren Dreifort and Kevin
Brown, offering to defer some of their bloated salaries for 2003 so
they can sign a proven first baseman or outfielder?</TE>
<TE>   I guess winning really means nothing to these guys as long as they
keep getting those fat paychecks. Or should I say stealing them.</TE>

<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Let's see, Kobe Bryant is back doing what they need, Shaquille O'Neal
isn't upset, the supporting cast is playing better....</LD>
<LD>   What's missing?</LD>
<LD>   Oh yes, the victory. There is that.</LD>
<TE>   Having failed to resemble the 2002 champions in New Jersey, the
Lakers drove south to the arena where they won in 2001 but that
didn't quite do it, either.</TE>
<TE>   It was just more of the same ... another town ... more fulsome
praise by the opponent ... another loss.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers played better. Bryant was back on his game in a big
way, 44 points and 10 assists' worth, and O'Neal was feeling so good
about things, he ended his media boycott, but in the end ...</TE>
<TE>   Bingo!</TE>
<TE>   They now have 18 of the 20 losses they need at this time of the
year before Phil Jackson says it would be "devastating for us to
overcome and we know that."</TE>
<TE>   Remember when Phil said he just had his sights set on 50 wins? He
may have to recalibrate again because when you start 10-18, you have
to finish 40-14.</TE>
<TE>   It would have been really nice for the Lakes to read about
themselves in the local papers before this one. Philadelphia Coach
Larry Brown, who's as gracious as he is zany, who lavished praise
upon the Lakers even as they beat his team's brains out in the 2001
Finals, was back at it, pooh-poohing talk of their problems,
predicting more great things for them.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're the best team," Brown said. "They've won
championships. They have two of the best players in the league.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's had an answer for Shaq [and] I don't think there's
anybody in the league any better than Kobe all-around. There might be
some as good, but they're special players. They have had their
problems, but I think they've always proven to me that they're the
best team when everybody's healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Where had we heard that before?</TE>
<TE>   Oh yes, in New Jersey, and Minnesota before that, and that's just
on this trip, on which they still haven't won.</TE>
<TE>   That's the way it has been going. The Lakers would arrive to
huzzahs. The opponent would roll out its A game and the Lakers
couldn't respond with much more than their D game, which wasn't even
enough to beat small fry like the Heat and Cavaliers.</TE>
<TE>   Friday was different for the Lakers. Just not different enough.</TE>
<TE>   Problem No. 1 had been solved at New Jersey, where Bryant went
back to shooting, even if he missed 21 of 29, which turned that
evening into an unseemly-looking waste of time and loss No. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Problem 1A, Shaq's mood, started looking better before Friday's
game, when he broke his nine-day vow of silence, taking questions
from the media, explaining he had only spoken angrily of his
teammates' contribution in an attempt to motivate them.</TE>
<TE>   Not that this was earth-shaking news, just a good omen for Laker
fans. However, Shaq being Shaq, just the news that he was talking
prompted the Associated Press office in New York to query its
correspondent at the game, wanting to know what Shaq had said.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, it wasn't a complete surprise when the Lakers took the floor
and began looking like a good basketball team, for the first time in
weeks, or this season.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant was as aggressive as they needed him to be, ignoring the
boos that poured forth from his resentful fellow Philly natives each
time he touched the ball, going 52 of a possible 53 minutes and
scoring 44 points.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, he called them "fun boos," but that was after taking a
long, long time to dress, a clear sign he needed a happier ending.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for the Lakers, if they didn't get the 76ers' A game
-- it's hard to call it that when Allen Iverson is missing 22 of 33
shots -- they got a big 76er effort, especially by
born-again-if-belatedly Derrick Coleman, now a 35-year-old backup
center, who tottered off the bench on his old, used-up legs and went
for 18 points and eight rebounds in 27 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   So they fought on even terms to the end, with the Lakers cutting a
nine-point deficit early in the fourth quarter to four with O'Neal on
the bench ... the Lakers taking the lead ... O'Neal missing four free
throws in the last 2:42 of regulation ... O'Neal fouling out in
overtime ... the Lakers cutting a five-point deficit to one in the
last 28 seconds of overtime ... before Rick Fox couldn't handle
Robert Horry's pass for the potential game-winner.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes you play well and you lose anyway, even when you're the
three-time defending champions.</TE>
<TE>   Not that they were in any mood for silver linings. Bryant took all
that time to dress. O'Neal started a new vow of silence.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, who has recently been giving out ever sunnier assessments
after ever-more gruesome efforts, should have been enchanted with
this one, at least on a relative basis, but he looked more overcast
and gloomy.</TE>
<TE>   "You make your own breaks in this game," he said stonily. "I'm not
going to complain about that."</TE>
<TE>   Next stop: Toronto, where, no doubt, no one can believe what's
happening to the Lakers, and where, for the Lakers' sake, it had
better not continue.</TE>

<HD>It's a Signing of the Times for Payroll-Sensitive Evans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ultimate objective for the Dodgers in trading Eric Karros and
Mark Grudzielanek was to secure a measure of financial and roster
flexibility -- the new password at Dodger Stadium -- and improve
their 2003 production at first base, the power position from which
Karros hit only 28 home runs the last two years.</LD>
<LD>   How did they do?</LD>
<LD>   Well, selecting from a limited market while constricted by their
determination to remain under the $117-million payroll tax threshold
(you don't suppose Kevin Brown or Darren Dreifort have paused in
their therapies and thought about reworking their contracts to help
management improve the team?), they fulfilled their objective about
as well as they could.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, some will categorize Fred McGriff as a consolation
prize compared to Cliff Floyd, but he is far more than that, and his
one-year, $3.75-million contract in the context of where the Dodgers
are represents bargain dollars and bountiful sense.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it could be argued that the agreement was the most
sensible of a day on which the Atlanta Braves, in a pure salary dump,
allowed the division rival Philadelphia Phillies to steal 18-game
winner Kevin Millwood (for catching prospect Johnny Estrada) and the
New York Mets stretched to a puzzling four years and $26 million in
acquiring Floyd, though neither the Dodgers, at about $15.5 million,
nor Baltimore Orioles, around $19 million, had offered more than
three years.</TE>
<TE>   Give Dan Evans credit.</TE>
<TE>   As much as Dodger Manager Jim Tracy lobbied for Floyd, because of
their relationship in the Montreal Expos' system, the general manager
maintained that if Floyd truly wanted to play for the Dodgers it
would have to be on their terms, the club would not exceed the tax
threshold.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, money talked.</TE>
<TE>   Coming off a four-year, $19-million contract and having rejected
an offer of salary arbitration from the Boston Red Sox, Floyd decided
he could always chat with Tracy by phone and opted for the
considerably larger Met offer.</TE>
<TE>   Make no mistake: At 39, McGriff doesn't have the speed or upside
of the 30-year-old old Floyd, but he is a true first baseman
(although not exactly the golden J.T. Snow, but then neither was
Karros, of course) and his familiarity around the bag (some Dodger
officials worried about Floyd's lack of it) could prove important
considering that the rest of the infield includes the untested Joe
Thurston, the still inexperienced Cesar Izturis and the sometimes
erratic Adrian Beltre.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, now just 22 homers shy of 500 (and don't think the
Dodgers aren't salivating at the marketing prospects), he has been
the epitome of 30-homer, 100-RBI consistency, even while playing for
the woeful Tampa Bay Devil Rays and even as he approaches his 40th
birthday.</TE>
<TE>   He has hit 32, 27, 31 and 30 homers in the last four seasons,
driving in 104, 106, 102 and 103 runs. If the Crime Dog doesn't
approach those figures again, William Bratton may investigate.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not asking him to do anything he hasn't done before," said
Evans, whose first basemen had a .405 slugging percentage last season
compared to McGriff's .505 and whose predominantly right-handed
hitting team batted .253 against right-handed pitching compared to
.299 against left-handers, a disparity that the left-handed hitting
McGriff may help correct while batting behind the left-handed Shawn
Green.</TE>
<TE>   If successive left-handers in the middle of the lineup leave the
Dodgers vulnerable to a late-inning relief specialist, an improved
offense may compensate for that.</TE>
<TE>   This much is certain:</TE>
<TE>   McGriff's willingness to accept the modest terms (he made $7.25
million last season with the Chicago Cubs, who bought out his 2003
option for $500,000) reflects his concern for a market in which the
clubs are now taking delight in turning the screws, does not cost the
Dodgers any compensatory draft picks (Floyd's signing would have cost
the club its first-round pick) and gives the Dodgers the financial
flexibility to add a left-handed reliever and/or another outfielder
while tying up first base for only one year, opposed to Floyd's
three.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, replacing McGriff and left fielder Brian Jordan after
the 2003 season -- if it comes to that -- could be a challenge,
especially if the Dodger farm system is still not kicking out
prospects, but flexibility is paramount given the club's emphasis on
recycling the payroll and roster -- and won't Vladimir Guerrero be
among next year's free agents?</TE>
<TE>   It comes down to this: The Dodgers created a payroll mess with bad
decisions and are now exhibiting the overdue discipline necessary to
correct it, a process that requires give and take because of the
nature of the system.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the Karros/Grudzielanek trade.</TE>
<TE>   To convince the Cubs, the Dodgers had to include $2 million and
pick up the $12.5 million (possibly $13 million depending on the
number of games he appears in next season) owed Todd Hundley over the
next two years.</TE>
<TE>   That's a ton for a backup catcher who hit .211 last season and
belittled the Dodger Stadium environment when he left as a free agent
after the 2000 season. In addition, it also means the trade was
tantamount to a financial wash, but then flexibility comes in
different forms.</TE>
<TE>   In 2003, for instance, it will take the form of the veteran Fred
McGriff at first base and the rookie Joe Thurston at second. Only
time will determine if the Dodgers are to be better because of it,
but given the recent production at those positions, the opinion here
is that it's a shot well worth taking.</TE>

<KH>ON THE NFL</KH>
<HD>Even He's Ravin' About Billick</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I say this through gritted teeth: Brian Billick deserves strong
coach-of-the-year consideration.</LD>
<LD>   Not only that -- and this will go over big in Cleveland -- Art
Modell has done an outstanding job as owner of the Baltimore Ravens.</LD>
<LD>   First, Billick: OK, so his ego could fill the Potomac, and
sometimes he talks as if he invented the game. But it's impossible to
deny what he and the Ravens (7-7) have done this season.</LD>
<TE>   The team that was gutted of its best players, and wasn't projected
to win more than five games, is suddenly in the thick of a playoff
race.</TE>
<TE>   If Baltimore beats Cleveland on Sunday, and Pittsburgh loses at
Tampa on Monday, the Ravens and Steelers will play for the AFC North
title Dec. 29 at Heinz Field.</TE>
<TE>   "This may be the most gratifying season I've had in 45 years,"
said Modell, in his second-to-last year as owner of the team.
Minority owner Steve Bisciotti will assume a majority share in the
franchise after next season.</TE>
<TE>   Modell could have angled for a short-term solution and kept some
of the team's big-money players through next season, essentially
leaving Bisciotti cap-strapped for years to come. Instead, Modell
gave the OK for a colossal salary-cap purge in the off-season, and
the Ravens cut loose a parade of all-star players: Rod Woodson, Duane
Starks, Elvis Grbac, Carnell Lake, Jamie Sharper, Sam Adams, Tony
Siragusa, Terry Allen, Randall Cunningham, Qadry Ismail, Rob Burnett,
Lional Dalton, Shannon Sharpe and Jermaine Lewis, among others.</TE>
<TE>   It was a tremendous favor to Bisciotti.</TE>
<TE>   "I would not do any man wrong in a deal of this kind," said
Modell, who will be forever loathed in Cleveland as the man who stole
the Browns. "I said, 'Look, guys, we're going to leave this franchise
in as good a shape or better than when we started it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore had only 13 defensive players on its 35-man roster
before last spring's draft. Then, in training camp, 60 players on the
80-man roster had NFL experience of two years or less.</TE>
<TE>   The Ravens started 0-2 and looked horrible before winning a
bizarre Monday night game against Denver that was widely written off
as a fluke. Making matters worse, Baltimore played most of the season
without three of its top defensive players -- Ray Lewis, Michael
McCrary and Chris McAlister, all sidelined with injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Just last month, when his team was 4-6, Billick dismissed his team
as a playoff longshot. This has been a strange season, though, and
counting out any team is risky. The Ravens have won seven of their
last 12 games, and have developed a core of talented young players,
many of whom were sixth- and seventh-round draft picks.</TE>
<TE>   That they are in position to win a division title puts Billick in
the class of Philadelphia's Andy Reid, whose team is winning despite
the loss of Donovan McNabb, and Indianapolis' Tony Dungy, who has
turned one of the league's worst defenses into one of its best.</TE>
<TE>   Fear of Flying</TE>
<TE>   Anyone want to fill in for Joe Horn at the Pro Bowl?</TE>
<TE>   It may come to that.</TE>
<TE>   The New Orleans receiver reportedly is having second thoughts
about traveling to Hawaii, only because he's afraid to fly. He boards
an airplane only when he must and stays ground-bound throughout the
off-season.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like flying at all -- at all," he told the New Orleans
Times-Picayune. "I don't care if it's a 20-minute flight. I don't fly
anywhere in the off-season. The only reason I fly here [with the
Saints] is because I have to. It's part of the job."</TE>
<TE>   Horn made the Pro Bowl trip two years ago, only because it was his
first invitation, but he couldn't fully enjoy his Hawaii experience
because he couldn't get the thought of the return flight off his
mind. Last year, he was selected as an alternate, but he aborted his
trip in Houston when mechanical problems with the plane delayed his
departure during the stopover. He rented a 15-passenger van and drove
home with the 14 friends and family members who'd accompanied him on
the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "The mechanic came on board, like, two or three times, and it was
raining. That did it," Horn recalled. "I felt pretty bad. I may suck
it up this time because a lot of my friends and family members were
with me last time and they really wanted to go."</TE>
<TE>   Around the NFL</TE>
<TE>   AFC EAST -- The Patriots are the first defending Super Bowl
champions to surrender three 200-yard rushing games, the latest being
Monday's loss at Tennessee, when the Titans rolled up 238. New
England Coach Bill Belichick, a defensive guru, isn't too worried
about the situation and doesn't think it's a trend that will
continue. He points out that the Titans gained all that ground by
constantly running Eddie George (101 yards in 31 carries), a few big
scrambles by Steve McNair, and some coaching breakdowns -- Robert
Holcombe had some long runs when the Patriots were using their nickel
or dime package.</TE>
<TE>   New England plays host to the Jets on Sunday, and needs to stop
running back Curtis Martin. Before this season, Martin had averaged
100-plus yards in his previous eight games against the Patriots. They
held him to five yards in four carries earlier this season, but
Martin was slowed by an ankle injury.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters who cover the Patriots got some disappointing news this
week when the team cut defensive tackle Steve Martin, maybe the
team's liveliest interview. Martin, a former Jet signed as a free
agent during the summer, was a fountain of quotes who always drew a
crowd around his locker-room stall. He had only 17 tackles, though,
and his days were numbered. He went out in a blaze. On a conference
call with writers who cover the Jets, he called center Kevin Mawae "a
dirty player," and said he was confused about his own role with the
Patriots, saying sometimes he felt like he was on the team "to stand
around and look pretty."</TE>
<TE>   As I said, a tragic loss.</TE>
<TE>   AFC NORTH -- They won't face each other on the field Monday, but
that didn't stop Pittsburgh safety Lee Flowers and Tampa Bay
defensive tackle Warren Sapp from jawing in the press this week. It
started after the Steelers beat the Buccaneers last season and
Flowers called them "paper champions" because they have never gotten
to the Super Bowl, despite an abundance of Pro Bowl players. This
time, the winner of the Buccaneer-Steeler game wins its division
title. Sapp, who is from Orlando and the University of Miami,
launched the first salvo, calling Flowers some unprintable things,
then saying, "Listen, man, Lee Flowers is a guy from Georgia. Florida
boys walk around with chips on their shoulders all the time. We talk
more stuff than anybody. He doesn't have any credentials to talk
stuff, so I'm wondering where this stuff is coming from.... You
wouldn't even know the man unless you get in front of the television
and they put his name under his face."</TE>
<TE>   Sapp is known as a "red-light" guy, who springs to life any time a
TV camera's red light comes on.</TE>
<TE>   Flowers had a retort, of course. "I'm not from Georgia, I'm from
South Carolina. You need to do your homework if you're gong to talk
about somebody. I went to school in Georgia. I haven't checked the
last time somebody got a degree from Miami, anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati is one loss away from a franchise-record 14 and will
secure the No. 1 pick in the draft. Hello, Carson Palmer. Who says
the Bengals don't give their fans anything?</TE>
<TE>   AFC SOUTH -- Houston will hold the Super Bowl in 2004, but the
expansion Texans will be playing in their "Super Bowl" on Sunday in
Washington. Seventeen members of the Houston organization are former
Redskin employees who were unceremoniously dumped when Dan Snyder
bought the team. Most prominent of that pink-slip brigade is Texan
General Manager Charley Casserly, who joined the Redskins in 1977 as
an unpaid errand boy for then-coach George Allen. Casserly doesn't
hide his contempt for Snyder, 37, among the league's most pompous and
least-liked team owners.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a problem with what happened to me," Casserly told
the Houston Chronicle. "It was his team, and he could do whatever he
wanted. I understood that. I don't have any issues with him about how
it went down.... But Daniel Snyder didn't know half the people who
were fired. I have issues with some others in and around the
organization who undercut people for their own selfish interests."</TE>
<TE>   There's more incentive for the Texans: If they win, they will
become the first expansion team to post three victories on the road.</TE>
<TE>   If you're a Jacksonville fan who believes Tom Coughlin should go,
there's a Web site for you: FireTomCoughlin.com. The site features an
online store with all sorts of items emblazoned with an encircled
"Tom" with a slash through it. There are teddy bears, greeting cards,
T-shirts, mouse pads, even baby bibs. My favorite is the No-Tom thong
-- $9.99.</TE>
<TE>   In an unusual twist, there's also KeepTomCoughlin.com, which
offers items from the same company that carry the opposite message.
Any way to make a buck, I guess.</TE>
<TE>   AFC WEST -- According to an NFL source, several Oakland players
were fined for missing curfew last Saturday in Miami, the night
before a 23-17 loss to the Dolphins. That kind of stuff might have
been laughed off in the days of the rollicking Raiders. But
considering the league is so balanced -- and the Raiders have yet to
clinch a playoff berth -- that's a troubling lapse in focus.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders haven't swept the Broncos in a season series since
Mike Shanahan took over as Denver's coach in 1995. The Chiefs are the
last team to have swept the Broncos, doing so twice in the last three
seasons. Oakland can earn a playoff berth with a win Sunday over
Denver and a loss by Miami, New England, Tennessee or Indianapolis.
If the Raiders win or tie and San Diego loses at Kansas City, the
Raiders win the AFC West.</TE>
<TE>   NFC EAST -- Philadelphia receiver Antonio Freeman has impeccable
timing. His older brother, Clarence, was attending his first Eagle
game this season on Sunday when Antonio caught a touchdown pass.
Antonio found his brother in the stands and gave him the ball.
Clarence is a Marine master sergeant who has been stationed near Iraq
for the last six months. He returned to the U.S. five days before the
game and flew to Philadelphia to watch his brother play. "He's my
best friend, my idol," Antonio told reporters. "Everything I am today
is because of him and my father and my mother. Every time I get to
show them a sense of gratitude, make them feel special, I try to do
it. I caught the touchdown and then shared the joy with my brother."</TE>
<TE>   NFC NORTH -- Brett Favre is downsizing. The Packer quarterback has
put his five-bedroom home on the market for $1.4 million and plans to
move with his family into a Green Bay townhouse by next season. The
decision has stoked the buzz that Favre is flirting with retirement
and doesn't want to have to unload a big house when he calls it
quits. He has said he plans to play next season but has not
elaborated on his plans beyond that. Favre and his wife, Deanna,
reportedly have told friends they're tired of keeping up two large
homes. They also own an estate outside Hattiesburg, Miss. Their
two-story brick home in southwest Green Bay is 7,829 square feet and
sits on 2.77 acres of woodland.</TE>
<TE>   The Packers will reshuffle their offensive line Sunday for the
fifth time this season, using their center at left tackle and a
free-agent rookie at right tackle. No wonder Favre is thinking about
retiring. Actually, the line has played well, in spite of the
shakeups. Favre has been sacked 24 times -- almost three times fewer
than Houston's David Carr.</TE>
<TE>   NFC SOUTH -- Not only does he draw swarms of defensive players,
Michael Vick draws fans by the thousands. The Falcons have sold out
every home game this season, the first time that has happened since
1992, the year the Georgia Dome opened. Demand for tickets is so
great, the Falcons have started accepting deposits for season tickets
for 2003. They have received 3,000 deposits from fans in 18 states
and from as far away as Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Vick's jersey has become the league's No. 1 seller, followed by
the jerseys of Oakland's Charles Woodson, Chicago's Brian Urlacher,
St. Louis' Marshall Faulk and Philadelphia's McNabb.</TE>
<TE>   NFC WEST -- The 49ers haven't had a tight end of note since Brent
Jones retired after the 1997 season. They might have found one in
Eric Johnson, a converted college receiver, who caught eight passes
in each of the last two games. One of his most promising plays didn't
lead to a catch, but reminded people of the possibilities. The 49ers
sent him deep down the middle on third and 10, reminiscent of a
pattern Jones might have run.</TE>
<TE>   Since Matt Hasselbeck replaced the injured Trent Dilfer on Oct.
27, Seattle's passing offense has risen from 19th to seventh. The
Seahawks have averaged 468 yards of offense in the last four games.
Regardless, Mike Holmgren's job status has been shakier this season
than at any other time in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Sharpie is coming out with another Terrell Owens commercial. Yawn.
I'm waiting for the ad for the Coughlin thong.</TE>

<LD>SAM FARMER'S NFL RANKINGS AND COMMENTS:</LD>
<TE>*--*
Rank  Team (rec.)           Comment (last week's rank)
1     PHILADELPHIA  (11-3)  After McNabb went down, the defense
                            picked up the pace. (2)
2     GREEN BAY  (11-3)     Terry Glenn has come on strong in the
                            second half of the season. (4)
3     TAMPA BAY  (11-3)     No defense is quicker sideline to
                            sideline. (3)
4     MIAMI  (9-5)          Jason Taylor isn't just the defensive
                            MVP, but an overall MVP candidate. (5)
5     OAKLAND  (9-5)        Raiders won't run into a lot of teams
                            with cover corners like Miami's. (1)
6     INDIANAPOLIS  (9-5)   Colts cause a lot of fumbles but don't
                            recover many. (11)
7     DENVER (8-6)          In last two weeks, Broncos have gone from
                            also-rans to contenders. (13)
8     TENNESSEE (9-5)       Robert Holcombe is a great complement to
                            Eddie George. (14)
9     NEW ORLEANS  (9-5)    Every so often, Saints lose a game they
                            have no business losing. (6)
10    SAN FRANCISCO  (9-5)  With nothing at stake, the 49ers will
                            coast until the playoffs. (7)
11    ATLANTA  (8-5-1)      All of a sudden, Michael Vick looks very
                            human. (8)
12    PITTSBURGH  (8-5-1)   If Steelers don't win at Tampa, it could
                            be do or die against Baltimore. (15)
13    NEW ENGLAND  (8-6)    Patriot line did a poor job of protecting
                            Tom Brady vs. Titans. (9)
14    SAN DIEGO (8-6)       No Priest Holmes this week? What a break.
                            (10)
15    N.Y. JETS  (7-7)      Three fights at practice before the loss
                            to Chicago. (12)
16    KANSAS CITY  (7-7)    Losing Holmes could be a devastating blow
                            to this offense. (16)
17    BUFFALO (7-7)         Bill defense is just starting to come
                            around. (17)
18    N.Y. GIANTS  (8-6)    Flickering playoff hopes should be doused
                            by Sunday night. (18)
19    BALTIMORE  (7-7)      Ravens lost three best defensive players
                            but still held together. (20)
20    SEATTLE  (5-9)        Late surge still might not save
                            Holmgren's job. (22)
21    ST. LOUIS  (6-8)      Now that the pressure's off, let's see if
                            Bulger can continue to shine. (23)
22    CLEVELAND  (7-7)      This was supposed to be the season the
                            Browns hit their stride. (19)
23    JACKSONVILLE  (6-8)   Technically, Jaguars are alive. Really,
                            they don't have a playoff prayer. (24)
24    CAROLINA (5-9)        Panthers have to start thinking draft
                            position. (25)
25    DALLAS (5-9)          Dave Campo is definitely on his way out
                            of town. (21)
26    WASHINGTON  (5-9)     Redskins won't be breezing past Houston.
                            (26)
27    MINNESOTA (4-10)      Vikings will, ahem, welcome Cris Carter
                            back to the Metrodome. (28)
28    DETROIT (3-11)        Lions are moving on up ... in the draft.
                            (30)
29    CHICAGO (4-10)        Chris Chandler didn't look too bad
                            against the Jets. (31)
30    ARIZONA  (5-9)        For one game, made the new Rams look like
                            the old ones. (27)
31    HOUSTON  (4-10)       David Carr is almost sure to break the
                            record for times sacked. (29)
32    CINCINNATI  (1-13)    Hello, Carson? What do you mean, wrong
                            number? (32)</TE>

<KH>AROUND THE LEAGUE</KH>
<HD>New Rule to Promote Coaching Diversity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The NFL will begin a program to promote diversity in league hiring
practices, including modifying a rule to allow assistant coaches on
playoff teams to interview for head coaching positions.</LD>
<LD>   The new rule to give more opportunities to minority candidates
will go into effect immediately, the NFL said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The league's old anti-tampering rule was criticized in 2001 when
Marvin Lewis, then Baltimore's defensive coordinator, was mentioned
as a candidate for several openings but was unable to interview for
them because the Ravens went to the Super Bowl. By the time the
Ravens had won the NFL title, the positions had been filled.</LD>
<TE>   League owners have also agreed in principle that any team seeking
to hire a head coach will interview at least one minority. The
exception would be when a team has already made a commitment to
promote a current assistant, as the St. Louis Rams did with Mike
Martz.</TE>
<TE>   The league made the changes based on recommendations made by the
NFL Committee on Workplace Diversity.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys Johnnie Cochran Jr. and Cyrus Mehri, whose group met
with NFL leaders in October, called the measures "a major step in the
right direction."</TE>
<TE>   But in a statement, they said, "Implementation is the key to the
success of the diverse candidate slate principle."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh Steeler punter Josh Miller had season-ending shoulder
surgery and will be replaced by former Denver punter Tom Rouen.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, one of the AFC's most reliable punters, was put on injured
reserve after undergoing arthroscopic surgery Friday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Rouen, who was recently released by the Giants, averaged 42.5
yards, with a 32-yard net average and two blocked punts for New York.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jim Miller's season officially ended when the Chicago Bears put
the veteran quarterback on their crowded injured list.</TE>
<TE>   Miller was bothered by tendinitis in his shoulder and elbow for
much of the year, with the pain so bad he rarely practiced. He plans
to have surgery in the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   But it was a knee injury that ultimately cut his season short. In
Chicago's Dec. 9 loss at Miami, Miller sprained a ligament in his
knee and bruised a bone, putting him on crutches for several weeks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pat Tillman, a former Arizona Cardinal safety who left the NFL to
join the U.S. Army, has been accepted into the service's elite
Rangers unit.</TE>
<TE>   Tillman, 26, completed basic and advanced infantry training in
October, became certified as an Airborne parachutist in November and
graduated from the Ranger Indoctrination Program today, Army
spokeswoman Carol Darby said.</TE>

<HD>Pepperdine Falls to Utah, 77-61</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Utah Coach Rick Majerus called Friday's game the "Injury Bowl," which
was only partially correct.</LD>
<LD>   If he wanted, Majerus could have added insult to injury, as his
team did to Pepperdine, drilling the Waves, 77-61, in a nonconference
game before 1,627 at Malibu.</LD>
<LD>   The Waves were without three players and Utah went without its top
scorer, but one look at the stat sheet told all there was to know:
Utah worked harder, outrebounding Pepperdine, 48-32, and played
sticky defense that held the Waves to 24-for-71 shooting (33.8%),
including three for 22 from three-point range.</LD>
<TE>   "They just took us apart any way you can take a team apart,"
Pepperdine Coach Paul Westphal said. "They taught us a lesson. They
played 40 minutes of tough basketball that we couldn't match."</TE>
<TE>   It was a surprising way to lose for Pepperdine (5-4), which won
the Stanford Invitational earlier this week and had won five of six.</TE>
<TE>   Utah was coming off a 59-54 loss to Utah State. Toss in that the
Utes (6-3) played without forward Britton Johnsen, who had surgery
Wednesday to repair a torn ligament in his right thumb, and it's easy
to see why Majerus was pleased.</TE>
<TE>   "Our guys played in great fashion given the loss of Britton,"
Majerus said. "A lot of people are calling it a rebuilding year for
us, but our guys looked tough tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Utah, which relies heavily on three freshmen, pounded the Waves on
the way to a 41-30 halftime lead, grabbing rebound after rebound and
beating the Waves upcourt for easy transition baskets.</TE>
<TE>   "We got outworked tonight," said Pepperdine forward Jimmy Miggins,
who had 12 points.</TE>
<TE>   Utah guard Nick Jacobson scored a game-high 19 points.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine was without Glen McGowan, who was out because of a
blood clot in his left arm, and Devin Montgomery, who sat out because
of a fractured right thumb. Will Kimble has been out almost three
weeks because of a heart condition.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga 90, Long Beach State 55 -- Cory Violette and Ronny Turiaf
each scored 17 points and Blake Stepp had a school-record 16 assists
at Spokane, Wash., as the Bulldogs (7-3) handed the 49ers (1-7) a
sixth consecutive loss.</TE>

<HD>Staff, Recruiting First for Dorrell</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New Bruin Coach Karl Dorrell does not plan on attending the Las Vegas
Bowl. Instead, he will spend next week assembling a staff and making
recruiting calls.</LD>
<LD>   A so-called dead period for recruiting begins Monday and extends
until Jan. 2. Recruits can be contacted by telephone but not in
person. Dorrell is informing players who have already committed to
UCLA that he will extend a letter-of-intent on signing day in
February, but he does not plan on aggressively pursuing players who
have committed to other schools.</LD>
<LD>   Technically, Dorrell's tenure begins Thursday, so the Las Vegas
Bowl will not be part of his UCLA win-loss record.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bruin players were given $190 apiece and must arrange for their
own transportation to Las Vegas. They must check in to the MGM Grand
Hotel by 12:30 p.m. today and attend a team meeting 90 minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   The 10 Bruin coaches, including interim Coach Ed Kezirian, are
taking their families.</TE>
<TE>   A reception for UCLA and New Mexico takes place at New York-New
York Hotel &amp; Casino at 3 p.m. and it's all fun. A quarterback singing
and Elvis impersonation contest will be followed by a pie-eating
contest for linemen.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Olson, Matt Moore and John Sciarra -- call them "The Three
Freshmen" -- will do the singing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jon Embree, the receivers coach at Colorado, is high on Dorrell's
list to join his staff. But Embree said it probably would take an
offer to become offensive coordinator for him to come to Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   "There would have to be a lot of things that would have to go into
that decision," he said. "First, there would be family. They would
all have to be on board with it. Karl and I have a close
relationship, and the opportunity to work with him and help him have
success is very appealing."</TE>
<TE>   Another potential offensive coordinator is Washington quarterbacks
coach Steve Axman, who was Northern Arizona head coach when Dorrell
was an assistant there. Axman said he hasn't talked to Dorrell in
about a week.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd probably find it hard to find it much better than what I have
here," he said</TE>
<TE>   Bruin Athletic Director Dan Guerrero indicated that the salaries
of assistants would climb. Currently, the assistants make from
$96,000 to $151,000.</TE>

<HD>Effortless Won't Cut It for Bruins</HD>
<DH>After loss to Northern Arizona, UCLA will need to show a
lot more intensity on the road against No. 19 Kansas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAWRENCE, Kan.</DL>
<LD>Not even floppy red Santa Claus caps can disguise the sadness
triggered by the realization that the passion is gone from a
relationship.</LD>
<LD>   Three UCLA basketball players donned the headgear for a holiday
sing-along before departing for a monumental matchup against Kansas.</LD>
<LD>   Merry, however, they weren't.</LD>
<TE>   A humiliating loss at home to Northern Arizona on Tuesday --
UCLA's third defeat in five games -- had the Bruins lamenting their
inability to rekindle the flame.</TE>
<TE>   Where did the love go?</TE>
<TE>   "You can't point fingers at one person," forward Jason Kapono
said. "It's a collective thing. We just aren't playing with passion,
especially on defense."</TE>
<TE>   Kapono admitted the Bruins had taken Northern Arizona lightly. But
why?</TE>
<TE>   Had they been struck by collective amnesia, forgetting losses in
two exhibitions and regular-season games against San Diego and Duke?</TE>
<TE>   Blowout victories over Long Beach State and Portland gave them the
impression the romance was back for good. So they went through the
motions against the Lumberjacks and were scorned by the barely 5,000
fans who risked heartache by showing up at Pauley Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   Northern Arizona made wide-open three-point shots and a forward
named Ryan McDade, who, Kapono swears, is no taller than 6 feet 5,
pushed around Bruin post players as if they were rag dolls, notching
22 points and 12 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "The effort wasn't there," forward T.J. Cummings said. "And
defense is all about effort."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA was as flat as Kansas -- the state, not the team -- prompting
head-shaking all around.</TE>
<TE>   "We had good practices, and practice usually carries over into the
game," senior guard Ray Young said. "Then we showed up, or rather, we
didn't show up."</TE>
<TE>   Arriving with a measure of zeal today is strongly suggested.
Passion undoubtedly will be evident in the 17,000 or so fans showing
up at historic Allen Fieldhouse, where Kansas has won 43 of its last
45.</TE>
<TE>   The objects of their affection -- the Jayhawks -- have had
troubles of their own, lurching to a 5-3 start that includes losses
to Oregon, Florida and North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Still learning to compensate for the departure of All-American
forward Drew Gooden and sharpshooting guard Jeff Boschee, Kansas is
averaging 16.4 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Kirk Hinrich is off to a slow start and point guard Aaron
Miles has been reckless with the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "Regardless of whether this was UCLA or some Division II or
Division AA school, we need this win," Jayhawk guard Keith Langford
said. "We need to get some wins under our belts for our team's sake."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA defeated No. 1 Kansas last season at Pauley Pavilion by
shooting at a high percentage and hustling back on defense to stymie
the signature Jayhawk transition game. But Bruin seniors Matt Barnes,
Dan Gadzuric and Billy Knight were crucial, and they are gone.</TE>
<TE>   In their place are freshman centers Michael Fey and Ryan Hollins,
late-arrival forward Andre Patterson -- who might get his first start
since becoming academically eligible a week ago -- and rusty guards
Young and Jon Crispin, both of whom redshirted last season.</TE>
<TE>   Journeyman post players such as Jason Keep of San Diego and McDade
have bullied UCLA, so contending with Jayhawk All-American candidate
Nick Collison (6-9, 255 pounds) is a frightening prospect.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to get position, use our feet and play with the passion
we've lacked," Cummings said. "We usually get up for these big games.
We've won them in the past. This is why you go to UCLA."</TE>
<TE>   Players also go to UCLA because they know they'll play in the NCAA
tournament. But the Bruins' 14-year tournament streak -- and maybe
their streak of 54 winning seasons -- is in jeopardy.</TE>

<TE>   Update -- Whose slide will cease? Kansas dropped from a preseason
ranking of No. 2 with three losses in four games. UCLA fell from No.
12 all the way out of the rankings after opening with losses to San
Diego and Duke. Getting beat by Northern Arizona on Tuesday
underscored the impression that the Bruins might not return to the
rankings all season. Kansas has won its last two games, beating Tulsa
and Emporia State, and is finally beginning to adjust to the loss of
Drew Gooden. UCLA forward Andre Patterson is expected to make his
first start.</TE>

<HD>Trojans Get Feet Wet in Practice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The field was wet and the temperature fluctuated dramatically
throughout USC's practice Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Perfect conditions, Coach Pete Carroll said, to prepare for the
Jan. 2 Orange Bowl game against Iowa at Pro Player Stadium in Miami.</LD>
<LD>   "It's good to get on a field like this because [the weather] can
just turn in a heartbeat in Miami, and rain and wet everything down,"
Carroll said.</LD>
<TE>   USC played only a few quarters in drizzle this season. Running
back Justin Fargas welcomed the opportunity to test his footing and
other skills with the elements working against him.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to prepare for all situations, so we were getting our
feet wet," Fargas said. "I think everyone did a pretty good job
keeping their feet and being able to handle a wet football."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lee Webb, who moved from linebacker to fullback in the second half
of the season, returned to defense and will back up middle linebacker
Mike Pollard.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans are thin at the position because freshman Oscar Lua
suffered a knee injury during practice a few weeks ago and will have
surgery Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said Webb would compete with Brandon Hancock for the
starting fullback position in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't focused real hard on our recruiting the fullback
spot," Carroll said. "We're counting on those guys."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After appearing ragged at times Thursday, the Trojan offense
executed with better precision.</TE>
<TE>   But defensive lineman Omar Nazel turned in the play of the day
when he intercepted a pass by quarterback Carson Palmer and returned
it about 10 yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "That was cool," Nazel said. "Trophy Man couldn't catch me that
time. He saw a blitz coming and tried to get the ball to one of his
guys. I happened to be standing in the way."</TE>
<TE>   Nazel, however, said he tempered his celebration.</TE>
<TE>   "Gotta respect that man," he said of Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC convinced Florida native Mike Williams to come to Los Angeles,
and the freshman proved he was big-time receiver this season. Over
the next two days, the Trojans hope Williams proves an adept salesman
as well.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, from Tampa, will help entertain recruit Andre Caldwell,
a wide receiver from Tampa Jefferson High who is the younger brother
of former Florida receiver Reche Caldwell.</TE>
<TE>   Also visiting this weekend is running back Reggie Bush from Helix
High in La Mesa. The Trojans could face a tough sell, though, because
new UCLA Coach Karl Dorrell is a Helix High graduate.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Offensive coordinator Norm Chow said he has not heard from
Kentucky in five days regarding the school's head coaching position.</TE>

<HD>Hutchinson Is Getting His Shot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How fierce was Coach Henry Bibby's loyalty to four-season starting
point guard Brandon Granville?</LD>
<LD>   Ardent enough to keep Robert Hutchinson buried on the bench, even
though research showed that the Trojans had better results when
Hutchinson was on the floor. But with Granville graduated, Hutchinson
has stepped to the fore this season and is shooting his way into
Bibby's heart.</LD>
<LD>   "I always knew Hutch could shoot the basketball," Bibby said.
"It's just that there wasn't playing time with Brandon Granville
here. We took statistics and 90% of the games, when Hutch was in last
year, we were better.</LD>
<TE>   "We made big jumps on the floor offensively and defensively,
percentage-wise and statistic-wise, with Hutch in the game. A lot of
our guys wanted to play him more last year, but I was a big Brandon
Granville fan and I kind of stick with guys that have done it for me
before."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Hutchinson relished his role of spot relief. Now he's
savoring his shot as a senior while putting distance between himself
and sophomores Brandon Brooks and Derrick Craven in the battle for
the point.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting a lot of reps, that helps," Hutchinson said. "But it's
confidence too. [Bibby] gave me a lot of confidence and told me to
shoot the ball. He told me if I don't shoot, I'm coming out. So I
have to put it up."</TE>
<TE>   Hutchinson, who transferred to USC from Okaloosa-Walton Community
College in Niceville, Fla., for his sophomore season, started this
season averaging 1.5 points in 9.5 minutes and had three starts for
the Trojans while shooting 35.6%, a shaky 25.5% from three-point
territory.</TE>
<TE>   This season, he's averaging 9.8 points, shooting 59.4%, and has
made 55% -- 11 of 20 -- of his three-point attempts. Hutchinson has
twice scored a career-high 17 points and has started four of the five
games in which he has played while averaging 28.2 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior forward Jerry Dupree, awaiting the posting of grades
Tuesday to see if he's eligible for the spring semester, got in a
conditioning workout alongside the Trojans while they practiced
Friday morning and took part in a quick team film session. He will
not dress for today's game.... Junior center Jonathan Oliver, who has
a sprained left ankle, is questionable for today's game.</TE>

<HD>Ross Is Leading Trojans' Charge</HD>
<DH>USC has lost recent bids for women's volleyball title, but
the junior hitter says, 'It's a whole new season.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>April Ross came to USC expecting to compete for national titles in
volleyball. But until now, there has been only heartbreak for the
junior outside hitter.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans were awestruck two years ago in their first Final Four
in 15 years, and were swept aside by Wisconsin in a semifinal. With a
more experienced group last year, the pieces appeared to be in place
with Ross as their leader.</LD>
<LD>   Then, with USC holding a one-game lead in the regional final
against Arizona, Ross severely injured her right ankle and left the
match. The Wildcats rallied for a five-game victory.</LD>
<TE>   "Injuries happen and that one just happened at a bad time," Ross
said. "I don't really think about it too much. It's a whole new
season."</TE>
<TE>   One that finds Ross and the Trojans at New Orleans Arena today
trying to win USC's first national championship in women's volleyball
in 21 years.</TE>
<TE>   Standing in the Trojans' way is Pacific 10 Conference rival
Stanford, a team they have split with in two matches this season.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 4, USC upheld its No. 1 ranking with a thrilling 30-23,
27-30, 30-28, 25-30, 24-22 win at Stanford, ending the Cardinal's
26-match home winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford (32-4) exacted revenge Nov. 2 by dealing the Trojans a
30-26, 16-30, 26-30, 30-28, 16-14 loss before the largest crowd at
USC's Lyon Center.</TE>
<TE>   That remains the Trojans' only loss in 31 matches.</TE>
<TE>   "The first match against Stanford was one of my favorite matches
that I've ever played in," Ross said. "The second one was kind of
heartbreaking because I felt we should have won that one."</TE>
<TE>   Ross, who was national high school player of the year at Newport
Harbor, leads USC in kills, service aces and ranks second behind
defensive specialist Nicole Davis in digs.</TE>
<TE>   "If you watch April's point production, she scored points in every
way you can score them," USC Coach Mick Haley said. "She's come up
with a jump serve this year as opposed to those floaters in the past.
It doesn't look that devastating but it really has been effective.
She's worked hard at her blocking and is becoming an accomplished
blocker. Her hitting is not the power game but it's more crafty.</TE>
<TE>   "She is as complete a player that we have in the country right now
other than say Logan."</TE>
<TE>   Logan is Logan Tom, Stanford's two-time national player of the
year. As the only college player on the national team, she led the
U.S. to a fourth-place finish in the 2000 Olympics and a silver medal
in the FIVB World Championships in September.</TE>
<TE>   Against Hawaii in a semifinal Thursday, Tom had 13 kills, but it
was her dominating defensive effort against big-hitting All-American
Kim Willoughby that powered the Cardinal to a three-game sweep.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, Logan is a great player," said Katie Olsovsky, a
junior middle blocker for USC. "There's not a lot you can do other
than get as tall as you can and take away sharp angles. She has a lot
of shots and we have to take away the shots that are the hardest to
defend."</TE>
<TE>   But while Stanford has one established superstar, USC has several
powerful options.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the top of our game is something we haven't done too many
times," said Ross, a first-team All-American. "But I think if we do
play at the top of our game, I think we're really tough to beat."</TE>

<LD>With his team on the run after blowing a double-digit second-half
lead against Portland on Wednesday night at Staples Center, Coach
Alvin Gentry switched the Clippers to a zone defense late in the
fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The Trail Blazers, who led by a point, seemed to be caught off
guard by Gentry's 1-2-2 and settled for a three-point shot by Bonzi
Wells, which was closely contested by the Clippers' Quentin
Richardson.</LD>
<LD>   Wells' shot barely nipped the rim but because the Clippers were in
a zone, they failed to box out and the Trail Blazers ended up with
the rebound and eventually won the game, 97-93.</LD>
<TE>   The Clippers did not lose because of their zone, but they didn't
win with it, either. Which basically sums up the NBA's growing
relationship with a long-forbidden defense that was approved in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Minnesota was the league's bellwether for zone
defenses but the Timberwolves learned that it's difficult to win with
a zone over the long haul. In a five- or seven-game playoff series, a
zone becomes easier to pick apart.</TE>
<TE>   But this season, more teams are turning to zones and that may be
one reason the league scoring average is only 97.2. Dallas, New
Jersey, Seattle, Minnesota and even the Clippers have gotten a lot of
mileage out of multiple zone defenses.</TE>
<TE>   Are zone defenses effective against superstar players? Yes,
especially if you have plenty of size to line up around the lane to
slow dribble penetration.</TE>
<TE>   Because more coaches are using unconventional zones, ranging from
a box-and-one (a 2-2 zone with one defender playing man to man) to a
1-3-1 trap (a defense that double-teams the ball), talented scorers
are facing difficult challenges every night. Just ask the Lakers'
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA emphasizes individual talent and high-powered offensive
players are going to get their points. But zones make them rely more
on their teammates and that's not always good.</TE>
<TE>   Offenses tend to fall apart when the ball has to be reversed
around the court a few times and players have to change positioning.
The shot clock runs down, resulting in forced shots. Even talented
scorers such as Tracy McGrady, Allen Iverson and Bryant look average
when they have to hoist up a bad shot to beat the 24-second clock.</TE>
<TE>   Why are more teams using zones? Because many of today's NBA
players can't shoot.</TE>
<TE>   Just look at some of the futility records set already this season.
The Lakers set a franchise record for lowest field-goal percentage in
a game twice within a month. Denver and Detroit put up the lowest
halftime score in NBA history, 29-28, which broke a record set in the
pre-shot clock days of 1955. Maybe the best example of brick shooting
was the Nuggets' scoring only three points in the first quarter of a
game against San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Zones make offensive players think and play together as a five-man
unit. Which doesn't happen too often in a league filled with young
players who don't know how to move without the ball, or take good
percentage shots.</TE>
<TE>   That's how the Clippers, who certainly have plenty of holes in
their zone defenses, won a couple of games this season.</TE>
<TE>   Another plus for zones is that they often leave the perimeter
open, not a bad idea, considering the modern NBA player grew up
watching highlight dunks on "SportsCenter."</TE>
<TE>   Only seven teams are shooting better than 45%, and four, one of
them the Lakers, are not even shooting 40%. Six teams are making less
than 30% from behind the three-point arc, so it's easy to understand
why the term "self-check" has become so popular.</TE>
<TE>   Why doesn't every team play a zone? Because it takes a lot of work
and familiarity to play it effectively.</TE>
<TE>   The concept of defending an area of the floor instead of guarding
a man is a tough adjustment for many of today's players, who often
lack the knowledge of basic defensive principles.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent game against Houston, Indiana played a variety of
zones, hoping to slow Rocket center Yao Ming. It didn't work. Yao
finished with 29 points and 10 rebounds and the Rockets dominated on
the boards, 60-34, getting 25 rebounds on the offensive end.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason teams don't play more zones is the three-second
limit for defenders in the paint. This prevents defenses from placing
players under the basket and allows for more cuts through the lane.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Zone Improvement</TE>
<TE>   The Dallas Mavericks have benefited the most from the zone
defense. Last season, the Mavericks averaged 105.2 points but gave up
101.0. This season, the Mavericks -- with the help of the zone -- are
allowing 92.6 points and scoring 104.9. A look at teams' scoring
averages and field-goal percentages (through Thursday's games):</TE>

<HD>Fullmer Becomes Free Agent</HD>
<DH>Angels show interest in Ortiz or Fick to fill vacancy at
DH. Stoneman says Fullmer not part of 'core.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels tossed Brad Fullmer into the free-agent pool Friday,
creating a vacancy at designated hitter that could eventually be
filled by David Ortiz, Robert Fick or even Fullmer himself.</LD>
<LD>   "If it's Brad Fullmer, fine," Angel General Manager Bill Stoneman
said. "If it's not, it's going to be somebody who's as good as Brad
Fullmer."</LD>
<LD>   Pat Rooney, the agent for Ortiz, said Friday that Stoneman had
called to express interest in Ortiz. Fick, cut Friday by the Detroit
Tigers, said he would direct his agent to express interest in signing
with the Angels.</LD>
<TE>   "That would be like a dream come true," Fick said.</TE>
<TE>   Fick, 28, made the American League All-Star team last season,
hitting .270 with 17 home runs and 63 runs batted in. The Manhattan
Beach resident married last month, and the wedding party included a
former Cal State Northridge teammate, Angel second baseman Adam
Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz, 27, hit .272 with 20 homers and 75 RBIs for the Minnesota
Twins. Fullmer, 27, hit .289 with 19 homers and 59 RBI for the
Angels.</TE>
<TE>   The players join such other quality hitters as Frank Catalanotto,
Jose Cruz Jr. and Reggie Sanders in an expanding free-agent pool
created by teams unwilling to risk arbitration hearings for useful
but not critical players.</TE>
<TE>   With Shawn Wooten expected to return as the Angels' right-handed
designated hitter, Stoneman said he could find a left-handed
designated hitter among what he called "a glut of first base-DH
guys."</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman decided it did not make sense to risk an arbitration
hearing in which Fullmer could have been awarded as much as $5
million. He made $3.75 million last season.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman expressed interest in retaining him but, according to
Fullmer and agent Arn Tellem, did not extend a contract offer that he
could have accepted in lieu of arbitration. Still, should the Angels
extend an offer at a later date, Fullmer remains interested in
returning.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even have an opportunity to say no to anything," he
said. "I would have certainly listened. "</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman said last month that the Angels could accommodate Fullmer
within their 2003 budget. The Angels since have announced a stiff
increase in ticket prices, explaining that the revenue would help
keep the World Series championship team together.</TE>
<TE>   After cutting Fullmer for financial reasons, Stoneman said he did
not believe the fans were betrayed.</TE>
<TE>   "Had we moved Troy Glaus or somebody like that, that might be a
different story," Stoneman said. "We are going to keep the core of
the team together. The core doesn't extend to 25 players."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels also remain in search of a veteran backup outfielder.
They have discussed free agents Todd Hollandsworth, John Mabry and
John Vander Wal.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Mets have added a big bat to go with their upgraded
pitching staff, agreeing in principle with Cliff Floyd on a $26
million, four-year contract Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Floyd, who declined salary arbitration from the Boston Red Sox on
Thursday night, must pass a physical today to make the deal official.</LD>
<LD>   Floyd batted .288 with 28 homers, 43 doubles and 79 runs batted in
last season for Boston, Montreal and Florida. He had a .388 on-base
percentage and slugged .533.</LD>
<TE>   The Mets also learned that third baseman Norihiro Nakamura shunned
their $7 million, two-year offer to remain in Japan, re-signing with
the Kintetsu Buffaloes for a reported $30 million over five years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Philadelphia Phillies acquired right-hander Kevin Millwood
from the Atlanta Braves for catcher Johnny Estrada.</TE>
<TE>   Millwood was 18-8 with a 3.24 earned-run average last season,
helping the Braves win an unprecedented 11th straight division title.</TE>
<TE>   Estrada, 26, spent almost all of last season at triple-A Scranton
Wilkes Barre.</TE>
<TE>   He hit .279 with 11 homers and 67 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Matt Herges, a former Dodger reliever, was traded by the Montreal
Expos to the Pittsburgh Pirates for pitching prospects Chris Young
and Jon Searles.</TE>
<TE>   Herges, 32, was 2-5 with a 4.04 ERA and six saves in 62
appearances with Montreal last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Black Entertainment Television founder Robert Johnson hired Lehman
Brothers Inc. to help him buy a major league team and move it to
Washington, a Lehman banker said. Lehman advised Johnson on his
pursuit of an NBA expansion franchise in Charlotte, N.C, which he was
granted Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Alomar Jr. signed a $700,000 deal with the Chicago White
Sox.... Shortstop Mike Bordick agreed to a $1 million deal with
Toronto.... Left-hander Shawn Estes finalized a $3 million deal with
the Chicago Cubs.... Charles Nagy signed a minor league deal with the
San Diego Padres.... Tiger All-Star outfielder Robert Fick became a
free agent when Detroit did not offer him a contract for 2003. Others
who became free agents included: Toronto outfielder Jose Cruz Jr.,
New York Yankee outfielder Shane Spencer and Boston first baseman
Brian Daubach.... Several players agreed to deals ahead of Friday's
deadline to offer 2003 contracts to unsigned players on 40-man
rosters, including Florida infielders Luis Castillo ($4.85 million)
and Alex Gonzalez ($1.7 million), Cub catcher Paul Bako ($750,000),
Milwaukee left-hander Valerio De Los Santos ($925,000) and San
Francisco left-hander Scott Eyre ($725,000).... Cub broadcaster Ron
Santo underwent surgery Friday to have his left leg amputated below
the knee, WGN-AM radio reported. Santo, 62, discussed his surgery in
an interview on the station earlier, saying the procedure was

<HD>Leiweke Planning to Put Up a Fight</HD>

<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The phone call early Tuesday morning came from an irate Times reader.
He wasn't calling because his paper had been thrown on his roof. He
wasn't calling because his sports section was missing. As a matter of
fact, he wasn't even calling The Times.</LD>
<LD>   The call was placed to the Top Rank office of promoter Bob Arum in
Las Vegas. On the other end was Staples Center President Tim Leiweke.</LD>
<LD>   He had read a Times story in which Arum said a second fight
between Oscar De La Hoya and Shane Mosley had been agreed upon in
principle with the expectation that the contract would be signed
shortly. The fight, said Arum, would be held in Las Vegas at either
Mandalay Bay or the MGM Grand.</LD>
<TE>   Don't count us out, Leiweke told Arum.</TE>
<TE>   Later that day, Leiweke remained emotional and resolute in talking
to a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   "I am telling you," he said, "we are going to get this fight. This
is an L.A. fight. If it takes place anywhere else, it's a crime, a
joke."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but Vegas casino owners would be the ones laughing.</TE>
<TE>   When De La Hoya, who comes from East L.A., fought Mosley, from
Pomona, the first time, in June of 2000, Staples Center hosted it.
Staples officials paid a site fee of $5.5 million and showed a small
profit. This time, Arum is asking for a site fee between $7 million
and $8 million.</TE>
<TE>   And he was delighted to get the call from Leiweke. When it comes
to a bidding war, the more combatants, the happier Arum is.</TE>
<TE>   But in this war, Leiweke appears to be outnumbered. He insists
that he won't pass the added cost of a higher site fee on to the
fans. "We are not going to get into a situation where we have to
charge the fans ridiculous prices," Leiweke said.</TE>
<TE>   Not because he wouldn't like to. Leiweke simply can't charge
$1,500 for a ringside seat and exorbitant amounts elsewhere in the
arena as well and expect to fill the seats. The Vegas crowd is
accustomed to high prices. L.A. fans have too many other cheaper
options.</TE>
<TE>   The Las Vegas casinos are not even dependent on outrageous prices
to recoup their site fee. For them, it's an entirely different
philosophy. Merely by having such a marquee event, they can bring in
their high rollers and turn their profits at the gaming tables. When
De La Hoya fought Fernando Vargas in September at the Mandalay Bay
Events Center, the hotel and casino had one of its most profitable
weekends ever.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we can't compete with the gaming revenue," Leiweke
conceded, "but I don't think that will be the case. This will be a 10
times better fight here as a marketing tool and HBO knows that. It
will be a 10 times better fight here because, in L.A., it's about
territory and it's about heritage. If Vegas rents the fight, so what?
What does it mean?"</TE>
<TE>   Why would Leiweke be willing to pay the huge site fee if he were
not planning on drastically raising ticket prices?</TE>
<TE>   "I think they really need a star attraction in there," said
Richard Schaefer, De La Hoya's business manager. "The Lakers are not
doing that well. They have the Clippers and the Kings, but they want
added attractions to keep the people in the luxury boxes happy. It
would be an additional feather in their cap to say that, in
September, Staples Center will have the biggest fight of next year
for free for those who have purchased luxury boxes. That in itself
might make it worth the cost of getting the fight."</TE>
<TE>   Suppose Leiweke matches the offer of the Vegas casinos.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I would leave it up to the fighters," Arum said. "Both kids
being from L.A., they might opt to do it there."</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke says both fighters have assured him they would like to
stage the fight at Staples Center where Mosley won the first time on
a split decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we can say we favor one venue over the other,"
Schaefer said. "Oscar feels very comfortable at Mandalay and the MGM
Grand. He has had great fights in both places. The first fight
against Mosley was a great night in L.A., except for the outcome.
Staples did a great job with the fight and the marketing. It was one
of the best nights of boxing L.A. has ever seen. But there are other
things to consider. There is a cost for having it in California.
There are taxes and the cost of hotels. At this point, we are not
ruling anything out."</TE>
<TE>   Said publicist Norman Horton, speaking for Mosley: "Shane liked
being a part of Staples Center's history, participating in the first
fight ever at the arena. I don't think he would have a problem
fighting at Staples Center, but it's not his call. It's the
promoter."</TE>
<TE>   Arum says he won't make a decision before meeting with Leiweke
next week. "He knows the numbers," Arum said.</TE>
<TE>   "The fight will be held here," vowed Leiweke. "End of story."</TE>
<TE>   Quick Jabs</TE>
<TE>   Vargas' Ferocious Foundation for Kids will be holding a toy
giveaway for disadvantaged youngsters Sunday at the Mary Star of the
Sea Church in Oxnard from 1 to 3 p.m.... Vitali Klitschko's promoter
says his fighter will get a shot at Lennox Lewis in April, probably
in Las Vegas.</TE>

<LD>The hits keep coming for the Clippers.</LD>
<LD>   They played Friday against the Phoenix Suns without power forward
Elton Brand, their leading scorer and rebound. Brand suffered a
strained right calf in Monday's victory against the San Antonio
Spurs. He had only 10 points and four rebounds during Wednesday's
loss to the Portland Trail Blazers.</LD>
<LD>   The team kept Brand's injury a secret until Friday, when it became
obvious that the All-Star could not play. Rookie Chris Wilcox started
in Brand's place.</LD>
<TE>   Brand will not play tonight against the Denver Nuggets.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to play through it," said Brand, who limped around the
locker room before the game. "I just came down wrong on it. I can't
jump right now."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Brand, the Clippers were without two other
starters: small forward Lamar Odom (wrist/ankle) and shooting guard
Eric Piatkowski (abdominal strain). Plus, point guard Andre Miller is
nursing a sprained left ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of crazy the way it's gone for us," Coach Alvin Gentry
said of the team's string of injuries.</TE>

victory. The Nuggets on Wednesday traded Posey to the Houston Rockets
as part of a three-team deal. The Nuggets acquired Mark Bryant, Art
Long and a first-round pick from the Philadelphia 76ers and a
second-round pick from Houston. Denver's 89-80 defeat by Orlando

<HD>Sawyer Out for Sunday</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A still shaky Kevin Sawyer appeared at the Mighty Duck offices
Friday, in better shape than when he had wobbled off the ice Thursday
following a fight in a 5-4 loss to the Kings.</LD>
<LD>   Sawyer, who went to a hospital for examination after the game, was
still suffering from minor headaches, said team officials, who
indicated he did not have a concussion. Sawyer will not play in
Sunday's game against Phoenix. He will probably go on injured reserve
until after the Christmas break. Mike Brown was recalled from minor
league Cincinnati to fill the enforcer role.</LD>
<LD>   Sawyer, who is second in the NHL with 115 penalty minutes, and the
Kings' Brad Norton fought in the second period. Sawyer didn't even
make it to penalty box. He looked so woozy that he was sent off the
ice by game officials.</LD>
<TE>   "Sawyer is a competitive guy, who battles for his team," King
Coach Andy Murray said Friday. "He's worked hard to get the National
Hockey League and has played hard to stay there.</TE>
<TE>   "By the same token, he has not been shy about hitting other teams'
good players. That's the type of game he plays. That's why he's been
able to stay in the league. He has fought all the big guys. At the
same time we feel bad. We're human beings, we care for people and you
don't want any to get hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Norton, too, was concerned about Sawyer, who initiated the fight
after Norton had checked Paul Kariya.</TE>
<TE>   "He was just doing his job," Norton said. "I got a lucky punch in
there. You never like to see that. You know it's going to happen, but
you don't like to see a fellow player go down."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duck Coach Mike Babcock said defensemen Ruslan Salei and Keith
Carney would be available for Sunday's game.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks were left with only five defensemen after Carney was
sent home with a stomach virus Thursday. Salei had hoped to play
against the Kings but sat out for the ninth time in 10 games because
of a strained muscle in his right side.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adam Oates' two assists Thursday gave him 1,369 points in his
career, tying John Bucyk (Detroit, Boston) for 16th on the NHL's
all-time list.</TE>

<LD>Although some voters are inexplicably wrestling with the idea of
casting their votes for the filly Azeri for 2002 horse of the year,
by and large the latest Eclipse awards ballot is one of the easiest
to fill out in years. The exception is the older-horse division on
dirt. This is one of the weakest groups of horses in some time, and
voters couldn't be faulted if they just passed.</LD>
<LD>   You know you might be in trouble when two of the candidates --
Hal's Hope and Left Bank -- have died. Left Bank could win in a
partly sentimental vote. Before colic did him in, he was a versatile
runner, winning at sprint distances as well as nine furlongs, but his
record, like the other contenders, is skimpy for a champion. Left
Bank ran only four times, winning three, and didn't start after Aug.
3.</LD>
<LD>   Left Bank had only one Grade I win, but of the 12 horses listed --
theoretically, voters also can consider others -- only Street Cry won
more than one Grade I. He won two, the Dubai World Cup on his home
track in March and the Stephen Foster Handicap at Churchill Downs in
June, and then Left Bank beat him in the Whitney Handicap at Saratoga
in August. That, too, was Street Cry's last race of the year.</LD>
<TE>   The organizations that run the Eclipse program -- the Daily Racing
Form, the National Turf Writers Assn. and the National Thoroughbred
Racing Assn. -- were obviously hard-pressed to find enough horses to
fill two pages of past performances. Mizzen Mast is there, a win in
the Strub in February his only start of the year. Tenpins is listed,
even though he was badly beaten in his only Grade I start.</TE>
<TE>   There are several horses -- Kudos, Milwaukee Brew, Mongoose, Sky
Jack and the unfortunate Hal's Hope -- who were one-shot Grade I
wonders, and early in the year at that. Evening Attire won the most
stakes, four, but the Jockey Club Gold Cup was his only Grade I
victory and he was badly beaten in the Breeders' Cup Classic. It
would have cost Lido Palace's owners an outlandish $800,000 to run in
the Classic. Outside the big show, he posted a record that was no
better nor no worse than any of them.</TE>
<TE>   In a year with not much staying power and relatively little
consistency, the Classic winner is capable of sneaking in. A vote for
Volponi would not be ridiculous, but the Classic winner, at 43-1, was
no more than a hard-trying loser before he got to Arlington Park.
Volponi will receive some votes, but his lasting achievement will be
triggering a longshot pick six that exposed three computer rogues
before they made off with $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen times since 1971, the horse-of-the-year winner has come
out of the older-horse division, including Forego and Cigar more than
once. There's no one remotely close to their league this year. Kurt
Hoover, the perceptive telecaster, has suggested that voters consider
Orientate, the cinch sprint champion, for a dual award.</TE>
<TE>   Voting for a sprinter, in what is traditionally routers'
territory, is heresy for many of the electorate, but Orientate is not
an outrageous alternative. From April to October, at distances of
seven furlongs or less, the colt won six dirt races at five different
tracks, capped by the Breeders' Cup Sprint at Arlington. He won on
dry tracks as well as wet. When he ran around two turns, early in the
year, it was a different game and Orientate was overmatched. But so
were many of the year's horses that did nothing else.</TE>

<LD>The Lynwood High girls' basketball team, ranked No. 1 in the nation
by USA Today, was upset Friday night by Canyon (Tex.), 56-39, in the
semifinals of the Nike Tournament of Champions in Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Canyon, ranked 14th by USA Today and No. 1 in the state, according
to the Texas Assn. of Basketball Coaches poll, frustrated Lynwood
with its patient offense keyed by the inside-outside combination of
6-5 post Kalee Carey and guard Brooke Baughman. Carey had a game-high
20 points and 19 rebounds for the Lady Eagles. Baughman made two
three-pointers and finished the game with 17 points.</LD>
<LD>   Newhall Hart transfer Brandi Kimble scored 12 points. Sade
Wiley-Gatewood had 11 for Lynwood (6-1), which last week defeated the
nation's second-ranked team, Forestville (Md.) Bishop McNamara, at
the Lone Star Classic in San Antonio.</LD>

<LD>Michael Poe of Etiwanda won three major boys' cross-country

in October was the best indicator of his drive and determination.</LD>
<LD>   Poe, a senior, was expected to be one of the top finishers in the
individual sweepstakes race at Mt. SAC on Oct. 26. But he placed
13th, 46 seconds behind the winner of a race that included some of
the top runners from California, Arizona and Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   Poe attributed his finish to a lack of mental toughness, but he
used that to motivate himself to a series of superb efforts,
including victories in the Division I races of the Southern Section
and state championships in November and in the West region
championships Dec. 7.</LD>
<TE>   "I was in great shape going into Mt. SAC," Poe said. "But I wasn't
mentally ready to run in a race of that caliber. That race was a
great example of how you have to be mentally prepared to race."</TE>
<TE>   Poe felt ready to contend for a top-five finish in the national
championships at Morley Field in San Diego last Saturday, but
finished 22nd in the 32-runner field while running his sixth race in
40 days.</TE>
<TE>   He wore a look of fatigue and disappointment as he plopped down on
the grass near the finish line moments after the race.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little tired after the last five weeks," Poe said. "But
I'm not going to complain. I had a great season.... It's a little
hard [racing] back to back to back to back, but I'm totally excited
just to come here. Still, top 22 in the country isn't so bad."</TE>
<TE>   Junior Mohamed Trafeh of Duarte finished seventh in the national
meet to beat Poe for the third time in five meetings this season. But
the series of superb efforts that Poe strung together from the
Baseline League finals Nov. 5 to the West region championships helped
him edge Trafeh for The Times' boys' cross-country runner of the year
honors.</TE>
<TE>   The Baseline League finals were held at Mt. SAC, only 10 days
after Poe's meltdown on that course. Yet he ran 14 minutes 57 seconds
over the 2.91-mile layout to win the race by more than a minute and
cut four seconds off his previous course best.</TE>
<TE>   He followed that race with an easy 15:21 effort to win his
qualifying heat in the section preliminaries at Mt. SAC on Nov. 16
and then zipped to a 14:48 clocking on the same course to win the
Division I final by 19 seconds a week later.</TE>
<TE>   He won the state Division I final at Woodward Park in Fresno by 16
seconds Nov. 30 before posting a four-second margin of victory in the
West region championships on Mt. SAC's 5,000-meter course.</TE>
<TE>   He was relaxed and confident entering the national championships,
but faded from 10th to 22nd in the second half of the race.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that I was in shape to run with most of those guys," he
said. "But my body was just tired from all the races in the previous
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I just need to take some time off and start getting ready for
track."</TE>

<LD>The $100,000 Pete Axthelm Stakes and $100,000 Frances A. Genter
Stakes will be the secondary attractions on today's card at Calder in
Miami.</LD>
<LD>   Laffit Pincay Jr., the world's winningest jockey who is marching
toward 10,000 career victories, will be honored by both Calder and
Presidente Ramon, the track in Panama where he began his career more
than 38 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Pincay, sidelined by a suspension at Hollywood Park for a week,
hopes to do some winning while he's in Florida. He will ride
Heyahohowdy in the Genter, named after the late owner of 1990
Kentucky Derby winner Unbridled, and The Judge Sez Who in the
Axthelm, named in honor of the late sportswriter and broadcaster.</LD>
<TE>   Fourth in his most recent outing, the Mrs. Revere Stakes at
Churchill Downs, Heyahohowdy was a two-time stakes winner in Canada
and will be facing, among others, Nonsuch Bay, the winner of the
Mother Goose, a Grade I, this year at Belmont Park. Nonsuch Bay will
be making her first start on the grass.</TE>
<TE>   In the Axthelm, which goes at 7 1/2 furlongs on turf, The Judge
Sez Who will be seeking his eighth win in 20 starts for owner Sez Who
Racing and trainer Marty Wolfson.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Golden Ticket, who has been rejuvenated at the
Hollywood Park meet, will try for his third consecutive win in the
sixth, a starter allowance at 1 3/8 miles on the dirt.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Ron Warren Jr. At Golden Gate Fields, only perennial
champion jockey Russell Baze is winning at a higher percentage.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: John Quiles and Robert Triola. The two New York-based
trainers are a combined five for 130 in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four singling Golden Ticket in the
sixth; using Sweet Stepper, Sudden Glory, Brazil Nut, Color
Prospector and Dream Weekend in the seventh; Roll Hennessy Roll and
Toccet in the eighth and Wheaton One, Wild Horse Jones and Song
Minister in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/83. Money: Previous day/meet

<LD>King Coach Andy Murray didn't know whether to laugh or cry after
Thursday night's 5-4 victory over the Mighty Ducks.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings, who controlled the first two periods in building a 3-1
lead, gave up three goals in less than five minutes to lose their
edge, then rallied to extend their nearly two-year unbeaten streak
against the Ducks to nine games.</LD>
<LD>   "You come in after the game, should you yell at them?" he said.
"Should you pat them on the back? I just said, 'We won. Enjoy the
fact that we battled back to get it, but let's come back tomorrow
prepared to talk about what happened.' "</LD>
<TE>   "Tomorrow" was Friday, and Murray said that poor special-teams
play by the Kings, who gave up three power-play goals, had nearly
ruined them. But Brad Chartrand's second goal of the game, scored on
a redirection of a shot by Jaroslav Modry to tie the score with 8:12
to play, changed everything.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, the belief system came back in again," he said.
"We were almost at a point where you could sense, this shouldn't be
happening."</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Smolinski's winner, scored on a rebound with 2:29 to play,
was the Kings' 11th goal in two games, their 10th by somebody other
than their big three of Jason Allison, Adam Deadmarsh and Ziggy
Palffy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Deadmarsh and Derek Armstrong will practice with the Kings this
morning before it's decided whether they'll travel with the Kings for
games Sunday night at Chicago and Monday night at St. Louis.
Deadmarsh has an undetermined ailment, possibly related to the
concussion he suffered last month. Armstrong has a groin injury.</TE>

<HD>O'Neal Is Speaking Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Unwilling to speak publicly for two weeks because he either hated or
feared the state of a suddenly fragile team sagging in its attempt to
win a fourth consecutive championship, Shaquille O'Neal said Friday
he disparaged his teammates for good reason.</LD>
<LD>   "When I make my guys mad, they usually respond," O'Neal said
before the game with the 76ers, in which he fouled out.</LD>
<LD>   As the Lakers played their way to a 10-17 record, into last place
in the Pacific Division, the Big Psychologist twice denigrated his
guys for their lack of productivity. The result was twofold: His
teammates felt betrayed and then they played no better, and some
performed worse.</LD>
<TE>   More than a week after the likes of Brian Shaw asked they hear the
criticism firsthand rather than through the media, O'Neal said he
never left their sides. Figuratively speaking. "I never jump ship on
my guys," O'Neal said. "We win together and lose together."</TE>
<TE>   They'd be happy to hear it, of course. And happy to have him back.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly chatty, O'Neal touched a handful of topics with
reporters, among them:</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' situation: "Am I bothered? Yeah, I'm bothered. That's
why I haven't talked to you guys.... I'm a little bit concerned. As
we go along, I'll be able to tell."</TE>
<TE>   On recovering from surgery: "My foot's still hurting a little bit,
but I'll never say nothing."</TE>
<TE>   On his progress: "I'm only as good as my team's going. Once the
team gets back on track, I'll be at my best."</TE>
<TE>   On how the Lakers go from championship team to 10-17: "I won with
these guys the last three years. I don't know what the difference is
now. I don't know what the cancer is.... Hopefully, they'll get
better. Still time. Still time."</TE>
<TE>   On the lasting effects of criticizing his teammates: "If they
haven't been hurt in the past, it shouldn't hurt now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tracy Murray, who has played two minutes on this trip, has taken
to riding an exercise bike during games to stay warm, in the off
chance Phil Jackson plays him.</TE>

<LD>   "We've always said that when it was time to call it a career for A
Ransom, he would tell us," Hall said.</LD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rasheed Wallace's remarkable final minute was ruined by an ugly fight
at the end of the Portland Trail Blazers' 113-111 victory over the
Golden State Warriors on Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Wallace scored his team's final six points at Oakland, including a
game-winning fadeaway jumper at the buzzer.</LD>
<LD>   After racing to congratulate him, his teammates rushed to the aid
of Bonzi Wells.</LD>
<TE>   Wells and Golden State's Chris Mills were battling for position on
the shot and were still tied up after the ball went through. As the
two exchanged words and then began pushing each other, the Warriors'
Troy Murphy entered the fray and threw punches. Golden State Coach
Eric Musselman ran over and shoved Wells.</TE>
<TE>   Ruben Patterson and Murphy then began fighting as both teams were
pushing each other around and officials tried to break it up.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to make sure we don't fight," Patterson said. "But when
three or four guys are jumping on us, we've got to support each
other."</TE>
<TE>   Police officers ran up into the stands as fans started yelling,
rushing the court and throwing things at the Trail Blazers as they

leave the game tied.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Oracle beat OneWorld by less than a boat length today to take a
three-point lead in their semifinal repechage at the America's Cup in
Auckland, New Zealand.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco team's victory came a day after it won by more
than four minutes in the opener of the best-of-seven series.</LD>
<LD>   For a moment, close to the finish line, OneWorld edged ahead. But
Oracle thrust its bow ahead to cross only three seconds ahead in the
closest race of the Cup challenger series.</LD>
<TE>   Seattle's OneWorld had been 16 seconds behind Oracle at the final
turning mark.</TE>
<TE>   The yachts briefly separated at the top of the last run and
OneWorld, to the right of Oracle, steadily closed on its rival. When
they converged near the middle of the run, OneWorld was only a boat
length behind Oracle and closing rapidly.</TE>
<TE>   The yachts crossed the finish line with Oracle less than the
length of its burnished hull ahead of the hard-pressed Seattle team.</TE>
<TE>   "Our hearts were in our mouths," said Oracle navigator Ian Burns.</TE>
<TE>   "We've practiced that kind of finish a few hundred times now and
it paid off at last," he said. "We just try to keep it business as
usual in a situation like that, but it's pretty hard with them
breathing down your neck. You just have to sit there and hold on
tight."</TE>
<TE>   Boxing</TE>
<TE>   Former World Boxing Assn. super-featherweight champion Joel
Casamayor stopped Mexico's Yoni Vargas in five rounds at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Casamayor used his superior boxing skills to wear down Vargas in a
scheduled 10-round lightweight bout. It was Casamayor's second fight
since losing his 130-pound crown to Acelino Freitas on Jan. 12.</TE>
<TE>   A 1992 Olympic gold medalist while representing Cuba, Casamayor is
now 28-1 with 18 knockouts.</TE>
<TE>   Casamayor, known more as a technical fighter than a brawler,
became the aggressor when he needed to and finished Vargas (23-4)
with two fifth-round knockdowns.</TE>

<TE>   Japan's Masamori Tokuyama (28-2-1) retained his World Boxing

<TE>   Vitali Klitschko will challenge Lennox Lewis for the heavyweight

fight will take place in the United States on either April 12 or one
week later, and Las Vegas is one of the possible venues.</TE>

<LD>Martin Rucinsky scored St. Louis' third power-play goal early in the
third period, and the visiting Blues skated to a 3-3 tie Friday night
against the Phoenix Coyotes.</LD>
<LD>   The Coyotes had a goal disallowed with 2:06 left in overtime, but
hung on behind Brian Boucher's 39 saves to improve to 3-1-2 in their
last six games.</LD>
<LD>   St. Louis outshot Phoenix, 42-18, with each team taking three
shots in overtime.</LD>
<TE>   Keith Tkachuk had two goals for the Blues, and Ladislav Nagy, one
of the players Phoenix obtained by trading Tkachuk nearly two years
ago, had two goals for the Coyotes. Ramzi Abid scored the other,
giving Phoenix to a 3-1 lead with 4:18 left in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   Petr Cajanek had two assists for the Blues, who went 0-2-1 on a
western road trip.</TE>
<TE>   The Coyotes appeared to have won when Teppo Numminen jammed a
rebound of Tony Amonte's shot inside the left goalpost in the extra
period. But Amonte crashed into Johnson, with Tkachuk on his back,
and officials waved off the goal.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 3, Atlanta 2 -- Aaron Ward scored with 1:08 left in
overtime as the Hurricanes rallied for a victory over the Thrashers
at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Francis scored with 6:14 left in regulation and then set up

<TE>   The Dallas Stars put center Mike Modano on injured reserve after

retroactive to Wednesday, as a precaution after Modano was hit by
Philadelphia's Jeremy Roenick on Tuesday night. Modano missed
Thursday's game at Detroit and won't play today in New Jersey or
Sunday in Carolina.... Boston Bruin forward Sergei Samsonov is
expected to miss up to three months after he undergoes surgery on a

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) Friday acquired total control
of its sixth Major League Soccer team when the company exercised its
option to become the sole investor-operator of the San Jose
Earthquakes.</LD>
<LD>   The 2001 MLS champion was jointly operated by AEG and Silicon
Valley Sports and Entertainment in 2002, but Greg Jamison, president
and chief executive of SVS&amp;E, said the company, which also runs the
NHL's San Jose Sharks, was ending its involvement with the
Earthquakes "due to a variety of business factors."</LD>
<LD>   Don Garber, commissioner of the 10-team league, said he expected
"a seamless transition" to AEG control, especially considering that
the Earthquakes' marquee player, U.S. forward Landon Donovan, has
been re-signed and that the club this week extended its lease with
Spartan Stadium on the San Jose State campus.</LD>
<TE>   Along with the Earthquakes, AEG also operates the Galaxy, Colorado
Rapids, Chicago Fire, D.C. United and the New York/New Jersey
MetroStars.</TE>
<TE>   Rowley Dies</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Rowley, who scored more goals in English soccer than any
other player but who never represented his country, has died at 76,
the English Football Assn. announced. Rowley scored 434 goals in 619
league games and 30 more in cup competitions during an 18-year career
between 1947-1965 with West Bromwich Albion, Fulham, Leicester City
and Shrewsbury.</TE>
<TE>   Poland's Choice</TE>
<TE>   Former Poland international and Legia Warsaw coach Pawel Janas, a
member of the country's silver medal-winning team at the 1992
Barcelona Olympics, was named Poland's new coach.</TE>
<TE>   Janas, 49, replaces Zbigniew Boniek, who quit two weeks ago after
only five months in charge.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren Retires</TE>
<TE>   Cameroon World Cup defender Lauren, who helped the African nation
win the gold medal at the Sydney 2000 Olympics and win the African
Nations Cup earlier this year, announced his retirement from
international soccer.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren, 25, said he will concentrate on his career with English
champion Arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   Pumpido Denied</TE>
<TE>   South American champion Olimpia of Paraguay has rejected, at least
temporarily, Argentine Coach Nery Pumpido's efforts to get a pay
raise for leading the club to the Copa Libertadores title.</TE>
<TE>   "Pumpido is planning to be paid more than he was this season and
that's impossible," said Osvaldo Dominguez Dibb, the team's
president. "Everyone in Paraguay is suffering [financially] and
Olimpia cannot avoid this reality.</TE>
<TE>   "I explained to Pumpido that we could not increase his wages now
unless we can negotiate a good transfer [of one or more Olimpia
players]."</TE>
<TE>   Briegel Chosen</TE>
<TE>   Former international defender Hans-Peter Briegel, who played 72
games for Germany between 1979 and 1986 and was on its World Cup
final losing sides at Spain '82 and Mexico '86, has agreed to coach
Albania's national team through the end of qualifying for the 2004
European Championship in Portugal. Armando Duka, president of the
Albanian soccer federation, said Briegel, 47, would be paid $170,000.</TE>
<TE>   Quick Passes</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. men's national team will play Japan on March 29 at
Seahawks Stadium in Seattle, U.S. Soccer said, confirming an earlier
announcement by Japan.... U.S. defender Frankie Hejduk's
relegation-threatened Swiss club, St Gallen, named Austrian Heinz
Peischl as its new coach.... Kazakhstan has named former Russia
under-21 coach Leonid Pakhomov, 59, as its national coach.</TE>

<HD>Williams' Daughter Drops Objections to Cryonic Storage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INVERNESS, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Ted Williams' eldest daughter dropped her objections Friday to her
siblings' decision to have the Hall of Famer's body frozen at a
cryonics lab in Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   Bobby-Jo Williams Ferrell relented after Circuit Judge Patricia
Thomas agreed to allow a $645,000 trust to be distributed equally
among Ferrell, half-brother John-Henry Williams and half-sister
Claudia Williams.</LD>
<LD>   Ferrell could not afford to continue the legal fight to have her
father unfrozen and cremated. The suit would have cost $250,000 and
she already had spent $87,000, said Ferrell's husband, Mark, said.</LD>
<TE>   "The financial cost of my struggle would be extraordinary and
would result in significant difficulties for my family," Ferrell said
in a statement read by her husband over the telephone. "I'm at peace
with the decision and I know that my father will understand."</TE>
<TE>   Added Mark Ferrell, "We were whipped."</TE>
<TE>   Ferrell had sued to have her father cremated and his ashes
scattered in the ocean off Florida, as was specified in Williams'
1996 will. Her siblings maintained they signed a pact with him in
2000 agreeing that their bodies would be frozen.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Williams died at 83 of cardiac arrest, John-Henry
had his father's body moved to the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in
Arizona, where it was frozen. Cryonics supporters believe that bodies
might one day be brought back to life, but most experts say that is
highly unlikely.</TE>
