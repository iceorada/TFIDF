<HD>L.A. Gay Rights Icon Loud, Proud, Moving On</HD>

<LD>Clearly, Morris Kight was in a hurry.</LD>
<LD>   He wanted to get through the ritual, even though it was a day when
honors were being heaped upon him as a retiring member of the L.A.
County Human Relations Commission.</LD>
<LD>   He fidgeted, made mumbled references to moving on and rose to lean
on his walker midway through a laudatory talk by Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky to indicate that Yaroslavsky should wind it up.</LD>
<TE>   It was, in some ways, characteristic of the man who has been in
the forefront of the gay liberation movement for almost half a
century. Speak out. Get it done. Hit the streets. Move on.</TE>
<TE>   But no one was listening to Kight this time. Those who had
gathered on the eighth floor of the county administration building
were not to be denied. Kight was retiring after 22 years, and by God,
they were going to honor him whether he liked it or not.</TE>
<TE>   Later, a tree would be planted in his honor in a small park in
West Hollywood, a city in which so much of Kight's work had been
done. But for now, members of the commission, friends, supporters and
co-activists in the gay community wanted to thank him for standing
tall when it was neither popular nor safe to do so.</TE>
<TE>   They wanted everyone to know that Kight, almost 83, was a hero of
the gay rights movement in L.A., and Kight wanted everyone to know it
too. No stranger to publicity, he had telephoned me to be there, and
I hesitated not a moment.</TE>
<TE>   Why not celebrate a man who through deed and effort had demanded a
place in the sun for a group of people defiled and murdered by
religions and governments throughout human history? Why not be there?</TE>
<TE>   "Kight," as someone at the meeting pointed out, "was always
there."</TE>
<TE>   Felled by a series of strokes, he is frail and must use a walker
to get around these days. And yet, there remains a patrician
authority in his voice, a crisp, articulate degree of command that
will not be silenced. He was, as someone has said, "the liberator,"
and in some ways, he still is.</TE>
<TE>   Texas born, Kight knew almost from the beginning that he was
"different." His father, a blue-collar worker at many jobs, knew it
too. "He brought me a present once when I was 4," Kight recalls. "It
was an embroidery set. Then he kissed me and said he knew something
about me. He just sensed it, and he wanted to make it easier for me."</TE>
<TE>   His mother was less forgiving. She maintained her silence
throughout her life but left behind notes that burned with hatred
toward homosexuals. Kight read them only after her death, and
destroyed them.</TE>
<TE>   "She'd have been happier," he said to me in a voice oddly muted,
"if she had loved me."</TE>
<TE>   It was Rosa Parks' refusal to move to the back of a bus in
Montgomery, Ala., in 1955 that "radicalized" Kight. He came to L.A.
because, inspired by Parks' courage, he felt the time was right for a
nonviolent movement on behalf of gays, and this was the place where
it should begin.</TE>
<TE>   "I never denied or concealed my gayness," he said, peering out
from large, horn-rimmed glasses. His thinning hair is white and his
skin pale. "I just eased out the closet door in stages. But I never
pretended to be anything I wasn't."</TE>
<TE>   Once here, he says, he founded the Gay and Lesbian Resistance in
1957, one of the first organizations of its kind in the country. For
nine years he conducted training classes every Sunday afternoon that
taught gays how to react in the face of insults and brutality. Twelve
years later, he was instrumental in establishing the Gay Liberation
Front in L.A., only the third such organization in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   For all those years, Kight has offered leadership to the
uncertain, pride to the demeaned and comfort to the dying. In 1970,
he and others marched through Hollywood to honor the first
anniversary of the so-called Stonewall Uprising in New York. It was
the start of the Gay and Lesbian Pride celebration and parade here.</TE>
<TE>   And it galvanized a population that for too long had been almost
invisible.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have called Kight theatrical and egotistical, but leaders
must always possess those traits. Theatrics are necessary to gather a
crowd, and self-assurance is required to convince others to follow a
path of resistance they might otherwise avoid, or liberation will
never be achieved.</TE>
<TE>   "Morris comes from an era where, to be openly gay, you were
putting your physical safety on the line," Yaroslavsky once told an
interviewer, adding: "When the history of civil liberties is written,
he'll be there."</TE>
<TE>   "It has been exciting," Kight says as we talk in a corner of the
room where the Human Relations Commission is about to begin its first
meeting without him in more than two decades. There is a prevailing
sadness to the event, a sense that an important era is ending.</TE>
<TE>   Kight is made an honorary commissioner, and then he's halfway out
the door by the time the commission is called to order to begin its
formal meeting without him. Walker or no walker, he moves away from
the meeting room as quickly as he can. It's time to step out, to get
going, to move on.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the past," he says, in a tone meant to categorize his
honored yesterdays. "There are still things to do in the future."</TE>
<TE>   And the liberator moves determinedly down the hall toward the
elevator.</TE>

<HD>Boys, Baseball and a Weeklong Dream Season</HD>
<DH>At this Cooperstown ballpark, summer turns every player
into a hall of famer</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>COOPERSTOWN, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Long before "mamma" or "dada," his first word was "ball." At 18
months, he crouched in front of the television set, wearing a
potholder mitt for a glove, pretending to be the catcher for the
Boston Red Sox. By 2, he was sighing rapturously when he passed his
personal shrine.</LD>
<LD>   "There's Friendly Fenway," he would say, his voice filled with
dreams.</LD>
<LD>   Now our left-handed pitcher was 12 and standing on a mound in the
very place where the national pastime began. Behind him were the
emerald hills of upstate New York. And surrounding him, on 14 perfect
ball fields, were 1,100 other 12-year-old boys representing 64 youth
baseball teams from as far away as Hawaii.</LD>
<TE>   "The road here was really bad," said Dave, a father who
accompanied those island all-stars. Their team name was Tsunami, and
this week, the fifth session of a summer-long baseball marathon at
the Cooperstown Dreams Park, the team from Oahu hoped to roll a tidal
wave over all of us.</TE>
<TE>   Dave admitted he had used the bad-road-from-Hawaii line only about
33 times since he and his team--along with several dozen bleary-eyed
family members--flew first to Newark, N.J., then to Syracuse, N.Y.,
and then traveled by rental-car caravan to this small town west of
Albany, N.Y. He stood in a lot packed with cars from Kentucky,
Michigan, Missouri, Utah, Colorado, California, Florida--a
license-plate variety so vast it resembled a scene near national
landmarks like the Capitol or better yet, Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   After all, as more than one parent was to observe in the course of
a week of nonstop six-inning encounters, this was Disneyland for
baseball. "Ladies and gentlemen," a marketing consultant and former
Little League coach named Lou Presutti announced at opening
ceremonies modeled after the Olympics, "you are about to embark on a
journey. A journey through life....Baseball life."</TE>
<TE>   Wait. Baseball is life, right?</TE>
<TE>   That, at least, was the assumption among our team, the mighty Heat
of Hingham, Mass. Four years ago, our town's Little League coaches
plucked one boy from each team of 9-year-olds to form an all-star
summer travel team. Somewhere early in the team's career, head coach
Bruce Issadore, an attorney in our small town, floated the prospect
of playing in Cooperstown, where in 1807, Abner Doubleday is said to
have invented baseball. The Dreams Park, designed as a mecca for
12-year-old baseball fanatics, was new then--and as parents, we were
well aware of the vagaries of marriages, careers and youthful sports
passions. Who knew where any of us would be after our kids turned 12?</TE>
<TE>   But in a country of perpetual transition, we had settled, somehow,
in a bastion of stability. Many families claim roots going back to
the 17th century, when our seaport south of Boston was first settled.
Some still live in homes from that era. Although there is little
racial diversity, Hingham residents diverge in income, profession,
religion. After four years, only one boy had opted off the team. The
rest of us--players, parents and an astonishing assortment of
siblings--devoted week after summer week to baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Cooperstown became a goal and a mantra. The kids raised money
selling pizza door-to-door. We designed trading pins and T-shirts. We
thought we were hot--or maybe cool--until we arrived to find teams
where parents, players and little sisters all wore matching satin
warmup suits. Some teams brought flashy banners; one mom drove a
super-sized SUV whose license plate read BAMM (for Baseball Academy
of Mid-Michigan), the name of her son's team.</TE>
<TE>   It was dizzying to see the assortment of sizes and shapes
12-year-old ballplayers could come in. One catcher from Colorado was
so tall that when he crouched behind the plate, he was eye-level with
our batters. An outfielder from Illinois provided our pitchers with
the world's shortest strike zone. When one chubby kid from Florida
stepped up to bat, we thought, easy out. Then he blasted the ball to
the next county.</TE>
<TE>   But in their Dreams Park--issued uniforms (red for home; blue for
away), the sea of young athletes carrying bat bags and visions of
big-league careers seemed indistinguishable. They were focused young
athletes with so much in common that more than one mom confessed that
she approached some boy in uniform, only to find it was not her son.
Many of us got teary when they marched into Field One for opening
ceremonies, lined up behind their coaches bursting with excitement.
Teetering on the brink of adolescence, they radiated the last gasps
of childhood--and telegraphed the incipient arrival of manhood.</TE>
<TE>   Presutti, owner and founder of the Dreams Park, said he issued the
uniforms to--in the best sense of the phrase--level the playing
field. "They walk out on the field, it's all equal," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Presutti was inspired to build the park after his father, a
minor-league second baseman, exclaimed on a visit to the Baseball
Hall of Fame here, "Every kid in America should have the opportunity
to play baseball in Cooperstown."</TE>
<TE>   Little League teams from around the world already bust their bats
to compete each year in Williamsport, Pa. But rather than another
center for killer youth baseball contests, Presutti envisioned a
place to build memories.</TE>
<TE>   His plan was to build the $2.5-million, 110-acre facility through
the eyes of a 12-year-old. The fields are sized for teams designated
"travel-select" (all-stars) with 50-foot mounds and 70-foot
baselines. High green fences that circle the fields are furled with
red, white and blue bunting. Flags and pennants flutter everywhere.
Scores are recorded on lighted boards, an unheard-of luxury for most
youth baseball teams. Night games under the lights are high points.
At closing ceremonies, each boy is inducted into the American Youth
Baseball Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   "Cooperstown Dreams Park," said Presutti, summoning up a
well-rehearsed line, "is motherhood, apple pie and the American dream
revisited. This is our game. It is all about us as Americans. It is
about us and our youth, the pride of the present and the hope for the
future."</TE>
<TE>   To keep the place kid-focused, parents are not allowed into the
area where the boys and their coaches sleep--primitive barracks-style
housing.</TE>
<TE>   "Excuse me," Presutti interjected. "That is the Baseball Village
and those are called 'clubhouses.' "</TE>
<TE>   The park has been such a boon to local businesses that nearby
guest houses have taken on such names as Lefty's Cottage and the
Dugout. A cafe near the park calls itself the Hamburger Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Presutti, too, has profited handsomely. Each player and coach pays
a base price of $495 for the week's baseball experience. Add in the
50 billion trips each player and spectator makes to the concession
stands and souvenir store and the Cooperstown Dreams Park also looks
like a money machine.</TE>
<TE>   But while making no attempt to downplay the park's success,
Presutti, 60, prefers to paint himself as a guy who loves baseball
and wants to make sure that kids keep playing it, forever.</TE>
<TE>   In the brilliant summer week when the Hingham Heat roared into
Cooperstown, that ideal seemed safe. Demography and climate zones
were against us, we knew from the start. We might easily face, for
example, the Cannons from Santa Clarita, where all-stars are selected
from a population of 1 million (versus our hamlet's 20,000) and where
the season lasts 11 1/2 months (versus three for us). As the boys
staked out their beds, coach Issadore declared he would be happy if
we won just one of eight scheduled games.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, remarkably, we entered the playoffs in 19th place. Teams
from Colorado and Boca Raton, Fla., defeated us. But we clobbered a
second team from Colorado, as well as players from Utah, Illinois and
Long Island. When we defeated the Rebels, from New Fairfield, Conn.,
their players and coaches mobbed our team and cheered, "Go, New
England!"</TE>
<TE>   We held on through the third round of the final playoffs before
ceding to the Bobcats of Tinley Park, Ill. Along with his uniform and
his Hall of Fame ring, every boy on the Heat packed a heart full of
memories. Many kids also went home with Gatorade bottles filled with
Cooperstown dirt. This was a week they wanted to hold on to.</TE>
<TE>   The parents, too, etched each moment into the sacred mental vault
that houses their sons' childhoods. Soon enough, we will blink and
these boys will be gone to lives of their own.</TE>
<TE>   For now, we will treasure the image of our boy Sam Butterfield
standing on the mound in Cooperstown and baffling batters with his
curve. We will never forget his big-league grin as he raced across
home plate.</TE>
<TE>   Parents and players, all of us on this outing understood that
tournaments must end.</TE>
<TE>   But dreams go on forever.</TE>

<HD>The Upside of Down Marriages</HD>
<DH>Five-year study shows that, given time, relationships can
often bounce back</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To divorce or not to divorce. That is the question some deeply
unhappily wed people wrestle with as they weigh the personal costs of
staying in an unhappy marriage against the hope of finding
contentedness on their own.</LD>
<LD>   In what is believed to be one of the first studies of its kind, a
team of sociologists, psychologists and scholars compared unhappily
married people who divorced to unhappily married people who stayed
together.</LD>
<LD>   Using a 12-question survey that measured psychological and
emotional well-being, the researchers found that, on average,
unhappily married people who divorced were no happier and no less
depressed than unhappily married people who stayed the conjugal
course.</LD>
<TE>   Further, they had no greater self-esteem or sense of personal
mastery.</TE>
<TE>   About 19% of unhappy spouses who divorced or separated were
happily remarried five years later, but they were no happier, on
average, than those who stayed married. Two-thirds of unhappily
married spouses who hung in there described themselves as happily
married five years later. Perhaps most striking, 80% of marriages in
deepest turmoil turned around five years later, with the unhappy
spouse reportedly very happy.</TE>
<TE>   "The conventional belief is that when a marriage is down, it is
done," said Scott Stanley, co-director of the Center for Marital and
Family Studies at the University of Denver and one of the study's
co-authors. "But what we are seeing with this data is that there are
couples who are basically down, but the relationship bounces back."</TE>
<TE>   The study was presented earlier this month in Arlington, Va., at
the "Smart Marriages" conference sponsored by the Coalition for
Marriage, Families and Couples Education. The research team, led by
University of Chicago sociologist Linda J. Waite, was funded by the
Institute for American Values, a New York City think tank focused on
the family and promoting marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Using the National Survey of Families and Households, a nationally
representative sample of 5,232 married adults who took surveys
measuring personal and marital happiness at different time intervals,
the researchers focused on 645 spouses who rated their marriages
"unhappy" in the late '80s.</TE>
<TE>   Five years later, when the discontented partners were
re-interviewed, 167 had divorced or separated, while 478 had remained
married. In general, the study found, divorce was not a ticket to
happiness.</TE>
<TE>   "Divorce on average did not improve the personal lives of those
who went through it within that five-year period," said William J.
Doherty, co-author of the report, who is a professor of family social
science and director of the Marriage and Family Therapy program at
the University of Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the exceptions were people in violent and
abusive marriages, whose lives improved markedly following divorce.
Divorce doesn't necessarily make people happy, the researchers said,
because it introduces an exponential increase in emotionally laden,
complex problems that a person has little control over and that have
a wide and varied impact on well-being, such as child-custody
battles, children's reactions to divorce, economic hardship and
romantic disappointments.</TE>
<TE>   But people don't get divorced in pursuit of happiness, argues
Constance Ahrons, professor emeritus of sociology at USC and author
of "The Good Divorce" (HarperCollins, 1998). "People get a divorce
because they can't take it anymore, and they can't stand what they
are living," said Ahrons, who said she is suspicious of the findings
because of what she regards as the researchers' anti-divorce bias.</TE>
<TE>   Some new research suggests that divorce improves the lives of some
people--and not just those in abusive relationships. E. Mavis
Hetherington, a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of
Virginia who co-wrote "For Better or for Worse: Divorce Reconsidered"
(Norton, 2002), followed 1,400 families and 2,500 children, some for
three decades.</TE>
<TE>   She found that divorce enhanced the lives of 20% of people (i.e.,
they had more success in work, marriages and parenting). Another 10%
of people who divorced were "emotionally self-sustaining" and leading
happy, fulfilling lives without a partner by choice. Forty percent of
people who divorced had different partners and different marriages
but the same problems, Hetherington found.</TE>
<TE>   Other research has found that the children of parents in
high-conflict, volatile marriages are better off if their parents
divorce.</TE>
<TE>   No research perfectly answers any question, said Doherty. "Our
study is just one study and it needs to be replicated," he said. "The
larger message of this study is that unhappy marriages improve, and
that there is the possibility of turning around unhappy marriages."</TE>
<TE>   Doherty and his team explored how marriages turned from bad to
good by conducting interviews with survivors of marital strife. The
researchers recruited 55 people from northern Virginia and New Jersey
who said they had considered divorce during extended periods of
marital distress. Marital lows were brought about by such things as
alcoholism, infidelity, verbal abuse, depression and setbacks at
work. Most of the participants were affluent white couples, with a
low number of dual-career couples.</TE>
<TE>   Three marriage-survival narratives emerged: the endurance ethic,
the work ethic and the personal happiness ethic.</TE>
<TE>   In the endurance ethic, couples said their marriages improved not
because partners solved problems, but because they outlasted them. As
time passed, sources of conflict and stress such as financial and
child-rearing problems eased. "Some marital problems are transitory,"
said Stanley. People survived their marital nadir by "putting one
foot in front of the other, by pure endurance and outliving the
problem."</TE>
<TE>   In the work ethic, spouses told of working on problems, changing
behavior or improving communication. Partners said they arranged
dates, sought support from family and friends or clergy and sometimes
threatened divorce. "What these people did was use grit,
determination and the support of family, friends and clergy. These
were people who never sought professional help and who made efforts
to heal their own marriages," Stanley said.</TE>
<TE>   In the personal happiness ethic, partners changed themselves, not
their spouses. Partners found ways to improve their own happiness and
to build a happy life. "Some people do better in their marriage
because they don't expect their marriage to be the defining happiness
in their life," said Stanley.</TE>
<TE>   "One woman said she started pursuing things that gave her life
personal meaning, and she said, 'I got wings.' The metaphor of
diversifying your investments applies here."</TE>
<TE>   All of this begs that question: Would most unhappy spouses (in
three out of four unhappy marriages, it is one partner who is
unhappy) who divorced have ended up happily married if they had stuck
it out? The researchers said that unhappy spouses who divorced
reported more conflict, and were about twice as likely to report
violence in their marriage than unhappy partners who stayed married.</TE>
<TE>   But only 21% of unhappy spouses who divorced said they experienced
husband-to-wife violence compared with 9% who stayed married.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, there is no one who can tell an unhappy partner
whether a 30-year investment in a marriage will mean contentment in
the end, or if cutting one's losses by getting a divorce will afford
more life-enhancing choices. The trouble is, our culture is beset by
both the myth of the perfect marriage and the myth of the perfect
divorce, said Maggie Gallagher, an affiliate scholar at the Institute
for American Values and lead author of the report. But relationships
are far more nuanced, complex and difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "People should make the choice they want to about staying [in an
unhappy marriage] or leaving it," said Waite in an e-mail. "But they
should be aware of what tends to happen to people in their
situation."</TE>

<LD>RUNNING WITH SCISSORS</LD>
<LD>   A Memoir</LD>
<LD>   By Augusten Burroughs</LD>
<TE>   St. Martin's</TE>
<TE>   304 pages, $23.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ever wonder what it might be like to grow up in a lunatic asylum
run by the lunatics? Augusten Burroughs' hilarious and horrifying
memoir, "Running with Scissors," tells the story of a polite,
well-groomed, cheerful little gay boy who finds himself, like
Voltaire's Candide, being thrown from one bizarre situation into
another.</TE>
<TE>   We meet Augusten at age 11: a child of the 1970s who loves Donny
and Marie, glitzy costumes and shiny objects. He is so keen on
cleanliness and efficiency that he dreams of becoming a doctor or
playing one on TV. Although he and his parents inhabit an elegant,
streamlined glass house, their life is anything but neat.</TE>
<TE>   Augusten's chilly father, a mathematics professor, and his
narcissistic mother, a transplanted Southerner who's convinced she is
a poetic genius, are constantly engaged in vicious fights that lead
to their breakup. Next thing, the lad and his mother are living on
their own, just like in his favorite TV sitcom, "One Day at a Time."
Only his mom is prone to psychotic episodes: "Not crazy in a, let's
paint the kitchen bright red! sort of way. But crazy in a gas oven,
toothpaste sandwich, I am God sort of way."</TE>
<TE>   Enter Dr. Finch, a fat, jolly psychiatrist, who looks like Santa
Claus and predictably assures Augusten's mother that selfishness and
anger are healthy. "My mother's face tightened with pride and she
raised her chin slightly. 'Doctor, if being a bitch is healthy, then
I am the healthiest ... woman on the face of the earth.' " But this
does not prove to be a guarantee of mental health, nor do her
sessions with the doctor prevent her from being in and out of mental
institutions. Uninterested in her son except as a captive audience to
listen to her poems, Augusten's mother encourages him to spend time
at Dr. Finch's home in Northampton and, eventually, she lets Finch
become her son's legal guardian.</TE>
<TE>   Life with Papa Finch, his subservient, crone-like wife and their
brood of designedly uninhibited offspring is stranger than the Mad
Hatter's Tea Party. Anger is freely expressed. Children are
considered adults at age 13 and allowed to do whatever they want. The
house is knee-deep in garbage, the doctor's teenage daughters never
wash, and a 6-year-old nephew enjoys evacuating the contents of his
bowels under the piano. This, however, is just the tip of the
iceberg. There's the doctor's adopted son, a former patient, now in
his 30s, who becomes Augusten's lover.</TE>
<TE>   One of the doctor's teenage daughters lives on a hippie commune;
another, Natalie, on turning 13 ("adulthood"), is permitted to choose
her own father: a millionaire patient of her dad's who becomes her
legal guardian and also has sex with her. Meanwhile, Augusten's
mother is having a hot affair with a minister's wife and can't get
over the minister's lack of support of their love. On the other hand,
she's pleased by Augusten's 30-something boyfriend: "He's always been
supportive of me and my writing," she remarks.</TE>
<TE>   When Augusten doesn't want to go to school, Dr. Finch arranges for
him to circumvent the law requiring attendance by helping him fake a
suicide attempt. Over the next few years, Augusten and Natalie become
friends. Although they've grown accustomed to the strange world they
inhabit, even they can still be shocked by how weird things can get:
"You really should write all this stuff down," suggests Natalie.
Replies Augusten: "Even if I did, nobody would believe it."</TE>
<TE>   If the author had used this material to fashion a novel rather
than a memoir, the result might have been criticized as downright
improbable. The nuttiness of the goings-on described in this memoir
seem to exemplify the adage: Truth is stranger than fiction. The
memoirist enjoys this advantage over the novelist: One can't blame
him for flouting the rules of probability. The more outlandish his
experience, the more one feels inclined to sympathize with him. Even
so, our only assurance these things happened is that the author says
they did.</TE>
<TE>   While some writers might have told a story like this in raw,
anguished outrage, Burroughs (like a growing number of gay male
writers) takes the path of outrageous comedy and satire. It's an apt
response to a world in which psychotic behavior is mistaken for
creativity, sane people are berated as "judgmental" and "oppressive,"
and "freedom" is just another word for not knowing what you're doing:
"Freedom was what we had. Nobody told us when to go to bed. Nobody
told us to do our homework. Nobody told us we couldn't drink two
six-packs of Budweiser and then throw up in the Maytag. So why did we
feel so trapped? Why did I feel like I had no options in my life when
it seemed that options were the only thing I did have? ... More than
anything I wanted to break free. But free from what?" A resonant
question.</TE>

<LD>Sarah's Tea Party</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes it's fun to jump, skip and play. But other times it's
good to sit, talk and listen. Do you have a special place where you
like to go with a friend? Maybe you rest under a tree in your yard or
play with toys in your room. At Rancho Los Cerritos over 130 years
ago, the children who lived there sometimes spent time outdoors in
the gazebo.</LD>
<LD>   A gazebo is an open, outdoor summerhouse. A gazebo's roof offers
shade from the sun, and its open sides allow warm summer breezes to
blow through. It is a calm place to sit, enjoy the singing birds,
smell the fresh flowers or have a tea party. When Sarah Bixby was
growing up at the Rancho Los Cerritos in the 1870s, she would have
tea parties for her mother, aunts, and her cousin, Harry, in their
gazebo.</LD>
<TE>   Sarah made her tea with the fragrant leaves of mint plants. She
knew she could find a healthy supply of the herb in the damp soil by
the water tank at the rancho. Maybe you can find mint in your garden,
too. It's easy to identify because when you rub mint leaves between
your fingers, they will smell like candy canes.</TE>
<TE>   At Rancho Los Cerritos, tea was served between 3 and 5 p.m. when
the afternoon was cooler. Sometimes Ying, the family's cook, baked
delicious sugar cookies for Sarah's summer tea parties. What kinds of
treats would you serve at a tea party?</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Los Cerritos is one of the few two-story adobe homes
remaining in Southern California. You can see the rebuilt gazebo
where Sarah held her tea parties at Rancho Los Cerritos beginning
Aug. 1. (The rancho has been closed since March 2001 for a seismic
retrofit.) For more information, call (562) 570-1755 or visit

<HD>To Call Brutality 'Frequent' Is Unnecessary Use of Force</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I read Sandy Banks' column on police brutality today ("It Happens--So
Why Don't We Face It?" July 16) and was very impressed with her
recognition of "expectations" as a causative factor in situations
similar to the Inglewood incident. Surely she realizes that
"expectation" is synonymous to "profiling." Formed by prior
experience, expectation is considered a legitimate and worthwhile
human trait. Expectation, after all, leads us to avoid snakes and
spiders even though a relative few of them are poisonous.</LD>
<LD>   Profiling, though, is a sinister, right-wing mechanism that allows
cops and other government employees to arbitrarily deprive citizens
of their rights.</LD>
<LD>   I also must take exception to her statement as a fact that police
brutality happens frequently. As popular as she may be, I seriously
doubt that Banks knows nearly enough victims of police brutality to
in any way draw such a conclusion.</LD>
<TE>   I would ask her this: How many police-public contacts are made
daily in Los Angeles? Los Angeles County? California? Nationwide? I
can tell her that in L.A. County the number is in the tens of
thousands. I couldn't begin to guess what the number might be state
and nationwide. And what percentage of those contacts does she think
result in acts of police brutality? The number, I'd bet, is
minuscule.</TE>
<TE>   In my 21 years in law enforcement ... I never saw any of the
people I worked with use unnecessary force.</TE>

<HD>Pet Peeve: What's in an Owner's Name</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sandy Banks treats her dog very well ("No Way to Treat a Loyal Pet
Owner," July 14), so she thinks there ought not to be a name change
that might move us closer to being able to protect pets from less
loving owners? The issue appears not to be the name change, but what
that change would imply. People worry that if animals are not
conceptualized as property, humans may become restricted in how they
treat them. My understanding is that this proposed change in
terminology is an attempt to raise consciousness about the
human/animal relationship. Any day one can find stories of extreme
abuse: dogs being dragged on ropes behind pickup trucks as
punishment, cats set on fire for someone's amusement, or a pet dying
because of negligence.</LD>
<LD>   As it stands now, if someone loses a pet [at the hands of
another], they can only recover damages equal to the cost of the pet
as property. The fact that the pet was loved and considered a member
of someone's family is not a factor.</LD>
<LD>   While it is true that animal cruelty is already illegal, the
penalties are generally not very stiff.</LD>
<TE>   JUDITH GRANT</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I cannot begin to express how disappointed I am with people like
Sandy Banks and Al Martinez, not to mention many of your letter
writers. Their negative attitudes about changing legal language from
animal "owners" to animal "guardians" show how sadly uninformed they
all are.</TE>
<TE>   First, I wish they had explored the many studies that indicate
that language does, in many cases, determine behavior. Second, before
anyone disparages this idea, they should spend a week or two at a
shelter, and listen to the disgusting reasons people give for turning
in their animals. And then they should listen to the dog crying as
the family drives off. Then watch the depression set in as they
realize that the owner they loved is not coming back to get them. If
changing the language from "owner" to "guardian" helps just one of
these voiceless creatures to be treated more kindly, then so be it.</TE>

<HD>Fashionable to a T</HD>
<DH>The novelty shirt has said it all--from pop imagery to cool
slogans</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like no other article of clothing, the T-shirt has become a universal
communicator of cool. A new book sets out to document the history of
the blank cloth slate, which over the years has been embellished with
political slogans, fashion logos, images of pop idols and tourist
locales. Although it's written by French fashion journalist Charlotte
Brunel, "T-shirts" (Assouline, 2002) presents a global perspective of
the mass-produced garment, with hundreds of wonderful color
photographs.</LD>
<LD>   The origins of T-shirts are a bit cloudy. One theory suggests they
were derived from square-necked cotton flannel shirts worn in the
1880s by sailors in the U.S. Navy, another that they came from a
style worn by members of the British Navy. Whichever side of the
Atlantic they came from, it was on the backs of U.S. troops in World
War II that T-shirts achieved fame, as part of the historic image of
the liberating GI.</LD>
<LD>   The shirt was largely a working-class emblem in America until
James Dean, Elvis Presley, Marlon Brando and other rebellious youths
made it universally popular in the 1950s, on- and off-screen.
T-shirts have had many memorable movie moments, but one of the finest
was when Brando let it rip in the 1951 film "A Streetcar Named
Desire."</LD>
<TE>   In the 1960s, T-shirts were political tools for antiwar protesters
and tie-dyed canvases for hippies; they were slashed and
safety-pinned by 1970s punk rockers; a decade later fashion designers
covered them in logos and used them as clever fashion show
invitations. By the 1990s, T-shirts were deconstructed or festooned
with retro images.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in the days after Sept. 11, they played out a silent
dialogue between the U.S., where New Yorkers wore "Bin Laden: Dead or
Alive" T-shirts, and the Arab world, where young militant Muslims in
Islamabad, Pakistan, paid tribute to their hero by wearing his mug
across their chests.</TE>
<TE>   T-shirts reflect new technology, too, with fabrics that block the
sun's UV rays, repel insects, release fragrance and monitor vital
signs. Who knows what the future holds, but, as Brunel writes, "the
T-shirt is definitely not through with us yet."</TE>
<TE>   Old Shirts Never Die</TE>
<TE>   As a staple of the modern wardrobe, T-shirts tend to multiply like
paparazzi at a celebrity wedding.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody wants to get rid of them because they represent a
mini-history of hobbies, dreams, vacations and achievements.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of letting tees stack up in the closet, many people are
making T-shirt quilts or wall hangings.</TE>
<TE>   The T-Quilts company in Lake Wylie, S.C., sells how-to kits
($9.95), which include a pattern and instructions for making a small
wall hanging using as few as nine shirts, or up to a king-size quilt
using as many as 49. If you don't know whipstitch from whiplash,
T-Quilts owner Linda Long does custom work. The charge is $15 per
square (shirt) plus $5 additional for combining shirts into one
square, and the cost for fabric and postage.</TE>
<TE>   If the squares are 12 inches, 30 would make a twin-size. Check out

<DH>The whimsical donkeys and elephants all over Washington
have some people butting heads over art and politics</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The last elephant is unpainted, awaiting a judge's decision on
whether People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has a
constitutional right to use the beast for a message about
mistreatment of circus animals.</LD>
<LD>   But the rest of the so-called party animals are on the streets of
the nation's capital. Decorated as everything from Elvis Presley to a
tourist donning an FBI baseball cap and sporting a video camera, the
animals are providing a touch of whimsy to a city shadowed by
terrorism. Painted by local artists and pop artists these 800-pound
sculptures of polyurethane resin depicting Republicans (elephants)
and Democrats (donkeys) are bringing smiles--and a few rolled
eyes--to residents and visitors alike.</LD>
<TE>   "As both whimsy and as art, this is the biggest event in D.C.
since I've been here," said Sam Gilliam, a painter of abstract art
whose Seurat-style elephant stands in front of the National Gallery
of Art. "Art is another way people have of talking." So popular have
the animals become that their placement has occasioned some
high-toned lobbying (imagine that, in this city). City officials
recently installed "Florida Hybrid," an elephant decorated with
butterfly ballots, in front of the Turkish Embassy on Massachusetts
Avenue. Embassy officials were delighted, but insisted they needed a
donkey too. "The British Embassy has both," Turkish diplomat Cihad
Erginay explained.</TE>
<TE>   At every stop, from the watermelon elephant in front of Whole
Foods to the woolly mammoth in front of the National Geographic
Society, the animals interrupt the cityscape with a sense of the
unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, it's like summer reading," said Elizabeth Broun, director of
the Smithsonian's National Museum of American Art. "You can read
Heisenberg's theories of quantum mechanics all you want, but in the
summer, we all want a great mystery novel." Sharon Roy Finch, an
artist whose elephant depicting Washington's monuments guards the
Delta Shuttle at Reagan National Airport, thinks the animals are
beloved because they're so big. "There's something engaging about
being eye-to-eye with an animal," she said. "It makes you feel like a
toddler again, looking a golden retriever in the eye."</TE>
<TE>   But Blake Gopnik, chief art critic for the Washington Post, thinks
they are far too small. "Give me a real, life-sized Indian elephant
on every corner, I would have gone for that," he said. "These look
like oversized key chains." Gopnik thinks so little of the animals
that he has no plans to write about them. "Either they're not art or
they are, in which case they're incredibly bad."</TE>
<TE>   Trend Started in Zurich</TE>
<TE>   Although Chicago is credited with starting the
animals-as-public-art craze, installing 300 cows on parade in 1999 as
a tribute to the town's gritty history as a meat-packing capital, the
trend actually got its start in Switzerland a year earlier, when cows
appeared on the streets of Zurich. Ever since, cities have been
experimenting with animals that wink: In New Orleans, it was giant
fish; Cincinnati did pigs. New York did cows; Toronto, moose; Santa
Fe, horses; and Cincinnati, hogs. Miami Beach, perhaps the most
self-amused, did 8-foot fiberglass pink flamingos. Los Angeles,
naturally, did angels.</TE>
<TE>   In most cities, the installations went off without a hitch, but
this is Washington, where anything worth doing is worth having
political squabbles over.</TE>
<TE>   First, the Green Party protested that the nation has more than two
parties. The Greens pointed out that in the last presidential
election, Ralph Nader, a Green, took 6% of the vote in heavily
Democratic Washington, D.C., while George W. Bush, a Republican, got
9%. Party officials wanted the D.C. Commission on the Arts and
Humanities to decorate the streets with 100 sunflowers--their party
emblem. A judge ruled that the animals were not political speech but
art. Case dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   (In fact, the commission considered other animals before settling
on the party animals. There was some discussion of pandas--the
National Zoo's top draw--and someone suggested squirrels, although as
the Daily Oklahoman commented, "That was wisely rejected. When you
think of squirrels, you think of nuts, and then you think of
Congress.")</TE>
<TE>   PETA sued the commission for rejecting its designs: a shackled
circus elephant with a tear running down its face and a bull hook in
its side. Hiring New Yorker magazine artist Harry Bliss, PETA
designed an elephant to represent the "miserable, deprived, and
broken animals used in circuses ... forced to perform uncomfortable,
confusing, and often painful acts over and over again under the
threat of thrashings with a bull hook." The commission rejected the
design because it had a political message, even though other
animals--like the "Time for Heroes" elephant clearly had something to
say.</TE>
<TE>   "This is discrimination based on message," said Arthur Spitzer,
the ACLU lawyer handling the case for PETA. Public art, he said, "is
not a forum for just happy speech."</TE>
<TE>   Acts of Vandalism</TE>
<TE>   Life for the party animals has not been all happy either. Vandals
stole the tutu off Prima Donkey, festooned in pearls and pointed
shoes, painted magenta and poised in front of Neiman-Marcus. She's
now in the "Animal Shelter," a small shopping center at 2000
Pennsylvania Ave. where artists can repair their animals.</TE>
<TE>   Graffiti is a constant worry. A Dupont Circle donkey was smeared
with ketchup. And the briefcase of "L.E.Phant," an elephant dressed
as a lawyer and posted outside the Chamber of Commerce, was ripped
off.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,200 artists sent in designs. The commission selected 200.
Each artist--many from Washington but others from California, New
York, Switzerland and Tokyo--was paid $1,000 and given an elephant or
donkey, plus $200 for supplies. Earlier this year, they toiled in an
emptied department store downtown, letting the animals mingle.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the elephants and donkeys have all been assigned to their
public spaces. New York artist Philip Pearlstein's elephant, one of
the last to arrive, is to be installed in front of the Corcoran
Museum any day now. There's an itinerary of the animals at
www.partyanimalsdc.org.</TE>
<TE>   The Smithsonian's Broun thinks one reason this kind of project
works is because it is temporary. "If art is permanent, it provokes a
lot of debate. Is this the right person to commemorate?" said Broun,
whose museum advises cities about the care of some 50,000 monuments
on public streets. "These are shared spaces, and people are more
forgiving when they are temporary. There's a spirit of fun, a license
to be frivolous."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, where fun is usually confined to outmaneuvering
one's political opponents, the animals will be on display until
October, one month before the midterm elections, when they will be
auctioned to fund future arts projects. In the meantime, despite
their obvious political affiliation, the animals seem to appeal
across party lines. "There's an instant joy, when a child sees one of
the animals," said Lou Stovall, an artist and vice chairman of the
D.C. Arts Commission, who has installed many of the animals. "There's
a sense of humor, and a sense of country."</TE>

<CX>   Elephant design--A July 22 Southern California Living story about the
decorated elephant and donkey statues scattered through Washington,
D.C., stated that the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
hired New Yorker magazine artist Harry Bliss to design an elephant.
Actually, Bliss donated his design after being approached by PETA.</CX>

<LD>Peter and Sally walked with Uncle Stanley and his dog, Dinah, along
the cliff road at Princeville, Hawaii.</LD>
<LD>   "I have a surprise for you today," Uncle Stanley said.</LD>
<LD>   "Tell us what it is," Sally begged. "We love your surprises."</LD>
<TE>   But Uncle Stanley just smiled. "Follow me."</TE>
<TE>   He led them to a vacant lot where the grass was long and two small
palm trees bent away from the wind.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll tie Dinah to this tree," he said. "We don't want her to
scare my surprise. Now, let's be very quiet."</TE>
<TE>   He led Peter and Sally over to what looked like a heap of leaves
and twigs, but as they came closer they could see it was a nest with
a large chick inside.</TE>
<TE>   "What a big baby bird!" Sally whispered.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a young albatross, the largest of our seabirds," Uncle
Stanley replied. "People sometimes call them gooney birds because
they are so clumsy. But they are wonderful fliers. When this fellow
is full-grown he'll have a 6-foot wingspan."</TE>
<TE>   "Wow!" Peter said.</TE>
<TE>   The chick craned his neck, making little "eh-eh" sounds. Just then
a huge albatross flew down and waddled over to the nest. The chick
pushed his bill sideways inside the other's bill.</TE>
<TE>   "What's he doing?" Sally asked, standing on tiptoe to see.</TE>
<TE>   "His parent is feeding him squid. He's not old enough to fly and
catch his own food yet."</TE>
<TE>   "Squid? Yuck!"</TE>
<TE>   "That's his favorite. He's about 4 months old now and my friend
Fran who lives here says he's already trying to fly."</TE>
<TE>   "Where will he go?" Peter asked.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll fly around all the islands and then out into the wide
southern Pacific. He'll stay at sea for months at a time."</TE>
<TE>   Sally's eyes opened wide. "He must be a good swimmer!"</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, he is, Sally," Uncle Stanley said. "Better than you or I will
ever be."</TE>
<TE>   "Now, let's get Dinah and we'll go for a shave ice."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: Peter and Sally learn more about albatrosses and visit a
large colony of them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eve Begley Kiehm has studied the albatrosses that live on the

<HD>Foreign Performers and U.S. Gigs: Getting Here Is a Tougher
Ticket</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The aftermath of Sept. 11 has created a new kind of MIA: foreign
performers missing their engagements in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Immigration authorities at home and officers at U.S. embassies
abroad have intensified security checks to keep out potential
terrorists; consequently it can take months longer to issue the
clearances foreigners need to get into the country. Some have been
denied entry; others haven't made it through the maze in time.</LD>
<LD>   Since June, venues from Lincoln Center in New York to California
Plaza and the Conga Room in Los Angeles have felt the impact.</LD>
<TE>   Those unable to gain entry have included a Welsh harpist who was
going to perform at a small festival in Pennsylvania and an English
player of the sackbut, a medieval wind instrument, who failed to make
it to UC Berkeley. Eliso Virsaladze and Alexander Melnikov, two
pianists from the former Soviet Union were supposed to help the
Newport Music Festival in Rhode Island uphold its tradition of
presenting U.S. debuts of classical musicians. Not this time.</TE>
<TE>   The Lincoln Center Festival has been hit hardest: 10 players in a
28-member Iranian theater troupe, including one of the lead actors,
did not make it past the U.S. consulate in the United Arab Emirates.
Officials there ruled that the 10 were a risk to remain illegally in
America, festival director Nigel Redden said. That forced Lincoln
Center to reconfigure its U.S. premiere of a cycle of "Ta'ziyeh"
plays, traditional musical-theater works based on Shiite lore.</TE>
<TE>   The Lincoln Center Festival took a second hit when the Paris-based
Algerian singer-guitarist Souad Massi bowed out. Redden said that her
partner, a Moroccan, was held up because of a waiting period imposed
after Sept. 11 on visa applicants from 26 Muslim nations in North
Africa, the Middle East and East Asia; Massi did not want to travel
without him.</TE>
<TE>   World music fans in L.A. last month missed what was to have been
the Southern California debut of Toto La Momposina, a Colombian
singer-dancer billed as "The Queen of Cumbia." Her agent, Alison
Loerke, described a bureaucratic nightmare of documents being
misplaced and delayed by immigration authorities; the mess could not
be untangled in time for Momposina's scheduled June 24 concert at the
Conga Room.</TE>
<TE>   Cheika Rimitti, an Algerian rai singer, made it to California
Plaza for a free concert on July 13, but she was missing her keyboard
player and a guest singer, Cheb Sahraoui. They were held up by the
new 20-day security waiting period for North Africans and Middle
Easterners, said Walter Nick Durkacz, the New York City festival
director who handled visa arrangements for Rimitti's tour.</TE>
<TE>   Durkacz, who has directed the Central Park Summerstage series for
17 years, said that delays he encountered this year included having
the Immigration and Naturalization Service bounce back visa
applications because he had signed them in black ink rather than
blue, and because he mistakenly had written a check for $135--$5 more
than the required application fee.</TE>
<TE>   The INS has been criticized since Sept. 11 for, among other
things, granting student visas to the two pilots who felled the World
Trade Center--six months after they died carrying out their attack.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a lot of criticism and they're playing it
extremely by the book because they don't want to make mistakes,"
Durkacz said. "I can't blame them. We all do things differently now."</TE>
<TE>   Presenters point to June 1, 2001, as well as Sept. 11 as a
milestone on the road to uncertainty for importers of foreign talent.
That's when the INS began offering to ramrod visa applications
through the system in 15 days--for those willing to pay a $1,000 fee.
Executives of service organizations such as Opera America and the
American Symphony Orchestra League say that many of their members
can't afford the fee and that visa approvals that could be obtained
in 30 to 60 days early in 2001 now take 100 days or more.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Johnson, a supervisor at the California Service Center in
Laguna Niguel, one of four INS centers nationwide that process visa
applications, acknowledges the average time for unexpedited visa
approval has increased from 75 days early in 2001 to more than 100
days now. The culprit, he said, is global terrorism, not the "premium
processing fee" criticized by arts groups.</TE>
<TE>   It takes five to 10 minutes to run post-Sept. 11 computerized
security checks on each visa applicant, Johnson said--a big reason
for the slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   In June, he said, the California Service Center received 9,500
applications for temporary worker visas--about 500 of them for
artists. Their American presenters must persuade the INS that the
performers possess "extraordinary ability" or are "culturally unique"
--a process that for many years has generated periodic instances of
esteemed but not-so-famous performers being denied entry.</TE>
<TE>   Once the INS has OKd a performer, it is up to officers at U.S.
consulates around the world to decide whether they are trustworthy.
Are they apt to break the law? Is there a risk that they will try to
use a temporary visa as a portal to illegal immigration? Besides the
20-day security waiting period for those from "countries considered
problematic," as the State Department's consular affairs spokesman,
Edward Dickens, put it, all male visa-seekers ages 16 to 45 must now
provide detailed biographical information.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte Lee, who handles visas for IMG Artists, which has a
large roster of classical musicians, said it recently took her more
than five hours to help a client from China complete the form.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Denton, executive director of the American Arts Alliance, is
trying to educate INS officials about the unique needs of arts
presenters--and the potential damage to their reputations and
pocketbooks when advertised performers fail to appear. She hopes that
will lead to more consistent procedures for evaluating visa
applications for artists and more flexible ways of handling
emergencies and preventing no-shows.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand that [immigration authorities] are very, very
beleaguered. Maybe they'll understand what we're up against."</TE>
<TE>   The INS is not about to streamline anything in ways that would
compromise security, said Virginia Kice, spokeswoman for the
service's Western Region. "Nobody wants to make a mistake that has
awful repercussions."</TE>
<TE>   Arts presenters fear that without relief from visa delays, some
foreign performers may give up on the U.S.--and that some American
producers may balk at booking lesser-known artists, or ones from
hot-spot nations, for fear they won't get through the system.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing I want is to let that be a decisive factor in what
we program," said Redden, the Lincoln Center Festival director. "But
at some point it may come to that."</TE>

<LD>It's Day 10 of the Television Critics Assn. annual summer press tour.
At the rear of a large ballroom at the Ritz-Carlton in Pasadena, one
critic caresses his head in mock anguish and launches into his best
Martin Sheen "Apocalypse Now" impression:</LD>
<LD>   "Press tour. Shhhhhh," the reporter moans. "I'm still at press
tour."</LD>
<LD>   He and more than 200 television reporters from around the country
were about midway through the three-week summit, a twice-annual
"blind date" set up by the TV network publicity machine where the
journalists get up close and personal with the new fall shows. The
elaborately choreographed ritual, which concludes Friday, is fueled
by oceans of free alcohol, mountains of free food and nonstop
schmoozing of reporters, who pay for their own travel and
accommodations. If there was an official press tour dance, it might
be called "The Spin."</LD>
<TE>   Since July 9, much of the nation's TV press has been hunkered down
at the venerable Pasadena hotel to be relentlessly wooed by broadcast
and cable networks angling for favorable stories about their upcoming
fall series.</TE>
<TE>   The following is a behind-the-scenes look at one day, with its
grueling slate of press conferences, softball questions, cynical
asides and celebrity ogling.</TE>
<TE>   Before this day is over, some of the journalists will have tugged
admiringly at sitcom veteran John Ritter, laughed at Drew Carey's
raunchy story about asking "The Bachelor's" Alex Michel if he had sex
with his "soul mate," and mobbed Ben Affleck as if they were
teeny-boppers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   9:36 a.m.: Several reporters, most dressed comfortably in jeans,
T-shirts and jackets, move into the first of the day's eight press
conferences held by ABC, one of the four major broadcast networks
that join their cable and public television counterparts in putting
on the tour. They gather in a large ballroom, where photographs of
Ritter, Gregory Hines, John Madden and several other stars dominate
huge color posters on the walls.</TE>
<TE>   ABC executives and staffers gather at the rear of the room. Their
principal duty during the sessions is to provide a laugh track and
cheer the panelists. The reporters usually look on in glowering
silence.</TE>
<TE>   9:41 a.m.: The room darkens and George Stephanopoulos, the new
solo anchor of the Sunday morning discussion show "This Week,"
appears in a clip shown on two massive screens. Interrogating
politicians and others, the former Clinton administration aide is
hailed as a news superhero of the Beltway. Among the pronouncements:
"Fearless." "Pulling No Punches." "He's known from the War Room to
the West Wing." With the quick edits and rock music in the promo,
Stephanopoulos comes across like a young Indiana Jones, with a
microphone instead of a whip.</TE>
<TE>   11:05 a.m.: The new comedy "8 Simple Rules ...," in which parents
John Ritter ("Three's Company") and Katey Sagal ("Married ... With
Children") deal with the budding sexuality and growing pains of their
two teenage daughters, is introduced. The comedy is one of the
struggling network's high hopes for success this fall.</TE>
<TE>   A beaming Ritter bounces on stage along with Sagal and several
cast members and show producers. The first question: "John, you've
been the root of launching a series a good number of times, and there
is so much anticipation about this one. Is there any special anxiety
this time out?"</TE>
<TE>   "The anxiety is, what's Episode 2?" Ritter quips.</TE>
<TE>   11:30 a.m.: Kaley Cuoco, who plays the show's thong-wearing
16-year-old daughter Bridget, is asked how old she is. "Um, 16," she
says. A freelance journalist leans back in her chair and mutters, "If
she's 16, I'm 16."</TE>
<TE>   11:52 a.m.: The session winds to a close and Ritter, the
consummate showman who knows that a little extra stroking can go a
long way with this crowd, says with a huge smile, "Thank you so much,
everybody. We really appreciate this." Sensing some reluctance by the
journalists, the ABC cheering section responds dutifully with
grateful applause.</TE>
<TE>   11:54 a.m.: Sagal, a survivor of press tours past, exits the
ballroom, being questioned by several reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been though this several times," Sagal says after the
reporters leave. "They really blasted us with 'Married ... With
Children' .... So it's really nice when the reporters embrace a
show."</TE>
<TE>   Noon: The fact that escape is often difficult for some of the more
popular celebrities is demonstrated as Ritter is accosted by a sea of
quote-hungry reporters when he exits the men's room. Publicists give
up trying to pull the actor from the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope he washed his hands," someone says.</TE>
<TE>   12:30 p.m.: During the session devoted to "Miracles," a midseason
drama defined by its producers as a spiritual "The X-Files," star
Skeet Ulrich is asked, "What would you consider to be the greatest
miracle of your own life?"</TE>
<TE>   The press tour is not exactly a breeding ground for future Ted
Koppels or Dan Rathers. Though some tough and relevant questions are
asked, the sessions often are peppered with fluffy or bewildering
inquiries. These questions frequently result in fluffy or bewildering
responses.</TE>
<TE>   And Ulrich's answer to the "miracle" question does not disappoint:
"Probably the birth of our twins 16 months ago. You just can't
describe it. It's amazing."</TE>
<TE>   2:36 p.m.: The panel for "MDs," a new medical drama set in San
Francisco, comes out. Among the cast members is "Undercover Brother"
co-star Aunjanue Ellis, wearing a revealing yellow-green dress. A
magazine writer leans over to ask his table mate if there's an awards
show down the street.</TE>
<TE>   4:19 p.m.: An overflow crowd of reporters and publicists fills the
ballroom for the session on "Push, Nevada," a drama series developed
by actor Ben Affleck and Sean Bailey, two of the executive producers
of HBO's "Project Greenlight." Some of the reporters applaud when
Affleck walks on stage.</TE>
<TE>   4:30 p.m.: Affleck and Hayes patiently explain how clues in the
show could lead viewers to win $1.2 million, the amount stolen in the
fictional series.</TE>
<TE>   A reporter asks, "What do you do in case of a tie? In case two
people at the same time send in an entry saying, 'The money is in the
refrigerator.' "</TE>
<TE>   Affleck replies with feigned anger: "First of all, you've now
ruined it. The money was in the fridge, and now we have to change it.
I knew this was too easy." He shouts an expletive, standing up as if
he is about to leave. Everyone laughs.</TE>
<TE>   4:50 p.m.: The session ends, and Affleck immediately is swarmed by
reporters. He can barely exit the ballroom. While publicists try to
pull him away, Affleck keeps talking, trying his best to be
accommodating. One reporter thrusts a script of "Good Will Hunting"
at him and begs him to sign it.</TE>
<TE>   7:10 p.m.: Reporters and several ABC stars go to the Tournament of
Roses house in Pasadena. The days usually end with parties that
feature lavish buffets with mounds of shrimp, pizza, French fries,
chicken skewers and desserts.</TE>
<TE>   9:30 p.m.: The party builds to a crescendo when several
attendees--including ABC employees, actors and even a few
reporters--start to dance to what could be their anthem: "I Will
Survive."</TE>
<TE>   "Keep dancing," one reporter says, "because by Halloween, most of
you are gonna be canceled."</TE>

<HD>Rap's Show of Shows</HD>
<DH>Grooves tour, headed by OutKast, proves the genre can be
professional and riveting in concert.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let's not hear any more of that grumbling about rap just not working
in a live setting.</LD>
<LD>   Though still widely held in pop circles, the notion is long out of
date, thanks largely to the momentum started six years ago by the
annual Smokin' Grooves tour.</LD>
<LD>   Before the first Grooves outing in 1996, there was a genuine
concern in pop about the viability of hip-hop and rap concerts.
Despite selling millions of albums and helping shape pop culture, rap
concerts had a history of poorly organized shows, weak sound and
other production values, and frequently amateurish performances.
Occasional security lapses didn't help matters.</LD>
<TE>   Grooves changed all that by bringing to rap the same
professionalism long associated with pop and rock events. Several
other high-profile rap tours have sprung up, but Grooves remains the
model.</TE>
<TE>   This excellence was evident again Friday at the Universal
Amphitheatre as Grooves returned after a three-year break with a
lineup headed by OutKast, one of the most exciting attractions ever
in rap.</TE>
<TE>   Cee-Lo, from Atlanta's Goodie Mob and Dungeon Family creative
stream, opened the five-hour concert with a half-hour set that
suggested he is as much influenced by soul music as hip-hop.</TE>
<TE>   If the rapper, who shifts with ease between rapping and singing,
had been recording back in the '60s, he and such tunes as "Closet
Freak" would been right at home on Stax Records, the soul-oriented
label of Otis Redding and Booker T. &amp; the MGs. Cee-Lo's five-piece
band played with funk-accented drive that gave much of the music a
joyful, explosive edge. Cee-Lo's lyrics, too, include some thoughtful
reflections on relationships and life.</TE>
<TE>   Next up was Truth Hurts, who surely has the best stage name ever
for an R&amp;B singer whose songs deal aggressively with the intensity of
sexual politics.</TE>
<TE>   The first woman signed by Dr. Dre's Aftermath label, Truth proved
to be a confident, winning performer who combines some of the
independence of Macy Gray and the sassiness of Millie Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Working with a six-piece band and three back-up singers (also
cleverly named: the Consequences), Truth has a strong, forceful voice
but needs far stronger material to reach her considerable potential.</TE>
<TE>   Jurassic 5, which followed, is a leader in L.A.'s respected (but
commercially challenged) "positive rap" movement and their set Friday
was typically uplifting and warm.</TE>
<TE>   The group is so engaging that you wonder whether the "positive
rap" label doesn't handicap it in the marketplace, where the term may
be synonymous with "wimpy rap."</TE>
<TE>   It's more instructive to think of Jurassic 5, with its four
rappers and two DJs, as simply imaginative and original
alt-rappers--musicians who, like OutKast and the Roots, stay clear of
gangsta rap territory. Where Cee-Lo and the Roots showed Friday the
value of live bands, Jurassic 5's Cut Chemist and Nu-Mark took over
at one point for a blistering workout that belittled the argument of
hip-hop outsiders that turntable DJs aren't true artists.</TE>
<TE>   The Roots, who came on after Jurassic 5, helped introduce live
musicianship to hip-hop years ago, and it's possible that has hurt
the veteran Philadelphia outfit commercially the same way "positive
rap" has stymied Jurassic 5. The Roots may be seen by young rap fans
as some sort of worthy novelty, but the group is worthy by any
standard.</TE>
<TE>   Black Thought is a stylish, convincing rapper with biting,
socially conscious lyrics, and there's an equal authority and spark
to the five-piece band's jazzy-funk style. The Roots had such a
powerful presence Friday that it would have been hard for most acts
to follow.</TE>
<TE>   But OutKast had little trouble in that closer role because the
Georgia duo is in a class of its own.</TE>
<TE>   Andre Benjamin (Dre), one of the most charismatic figures in rap,
and Antoine Patton (Big Boi) combine the street sensibilities of rap
with the creative explosiveness of Parliament-Funkadelic and a sort
of Sly Stone sense of community. The rappers use both DJs and live
musicians, and their themes range from flat-out fun to social
consciousness without ever sacrificing a strong, disarming pop
sensibility.</TE>
<TE>   Even at the best of shows, some of the crowd starts heading for
the exit by midnight, but everyone held their ground Friday. You
don't walk out on OutKast. The audience was rewarded with a closing
barrage that included three of the most appealing tracks of recent
years in the anthem-like "Rosa Parks," the tender "Ms. Jackson" and
the simply jubilant "B.O.B." It's a good thing no one had to follow
that.</TE>

<DL>MSNBC is a scream</DL>
<LD>literally.</LD>
<LD>   Even after fatuously anointing itself "America's News- Channel,"
this flailing NBC-Microsoft hybrid a week ago assumed a second
identity as cable's replica of frantic talk radio. You know,
knee-jerk, yet superficial.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, MSNBC is America's SchmoozeChannel. No, not snooze, for
it's hard dozing through a din, notably one as loud as this--created
by an agenda that is usually not coherent discourse, but
attention-grabbing combat.</LD>
<TE>   The message: Don't confuse making a racket with passion. That's
especially so in MSNBC's evening hours (mostly late afternoon here on
the West Coast) that it calls its prime time.</TE>
<TE>   When not screaming, MSNBC's prime talkers screech. When not
screeching, they bellow. When not bellowing, they shout. The strategy
here is to transfix viewers with a brand of self-goosing that will
boost MSNBC's wee audience so that it one day will overtake its more
popular rivals, CNN and the Fox News Channel. MSNBC gained a bit
against CNN this week before sliding back, but it's too early for
definitive judgments when it comes to ratings.</TE>
<TE>   There's a shorter cut for MSNBC. Why not cut the gab and give Mike
Tyson a show and some guests to bite, and call it an evening.</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC will always have in common with CNN and Fox an addiction to
mislabeling rumor and innuendo as news. Call it gene sharing. There's
nothing wrong with MSNBC trying to separate itself from competitors
by going to talk, however, with bows to such breaking stories as the
stock market collapse and Samantha Runnion murder case. Two unevenly
performing 24-hour news channels are surely plenty, and a talk
channel makes sense in this era of specialized narrowcasting.</TE>
<TE>   Buyer beware, though.</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC has talk hosts galore accomplished at chomping the set,
among them the one, the only (before imitators usurped his act) Phil
Donahue. "Fasten your seat belts," MSNBC ballyhooed in advance of
Thursday's fruitless headline clash on "Donahue." It pitted
Donahue--the talk-show pioneer exhumed from TV's dank catacombs for
this reconstituted go against CNN and Fox--against his lead guest,
that snide, nasty Dragon Lady of the right, Ann Coulter.</TE>
<TE>   In a classic talk-show symbiosis, Coulter and Donahue engaged in a
mutually beneficial taffy pull. She used "Donahue" to promote her
bestseller, "Slander," which attacks the left, and he used her
reputation as a liberal slasher to advertise his new show. Called
"fireworks" by one MSNBC anchor, portions of the Donahue-Coulter duel
were rerun Friday, as if worthy of banner headlines.</TE>
<TE>   Question: What do you learn from fireworks? That they're loud and
produce light that swiftly disappears.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally Donahue and Coulter fought, going white against
white--his hair, her teeth. He got her to admit writing that liberals
"hate" all religions except Islam, and slammed her for "trying to get
Bubba (Bill Clinton)." She accused him of calling her names and
"losing the entire viewing audience when I'm trying to sell a book."
The nerve.</TE>
<TE>   It was bitter, it was brutal, and in the control booth there were
surely high-fives and shouts of "Great TV!" all around.</TE>
<TE>   The fairness advocate in me wanted Donahue to grant Coulter more
time to state her case instead of continually stomping over her when
she attempted to speak. The liberal in me applauded him for bullying
someone known for smearing her leftish targets by deploying words
against them carelessly.</TE>
<TE>   In a curious way, Coulter and MSNBC have identical agendas. She
draws attention to herself with a book many regard as outrageous,
just as the new, blabbier MSNBC hopes to earn attention by behaving
outrageously.</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC has "Donahue" preceding "Hardball With Chris Matthews,"
which is headed by the speed-talking former CNBC host rivaled only by
Fox's Bill O'Reilly in the art of delivering clamor. But young Dan
Abrams of MSNBC's "The Abrams Report" often registers impressive
noise himself in this new talk bloc, and with Matthews and Donahue as
role models, his future in shouting down guests looks promising.</TE>
<TE>   The exception here is "Nachman With Jerry Nachman," the "Donahue"
lead-in whose arrogant host has the gift of irritating without ever
raising his voice. Nachman's show is apparently his ego-stroking gift
to Nachman, a news veteran who is also MSNBC's new vice president and
editor in chief.</TE>
<TE>   "He's Nachman," announces an MSNBC promo melodramatically, as if
he prowls the dark streets for stories in a trench coat and snap-brim
hat. Nachman is a pretty smart guy, all right, but not smart enough
to know that he belongs behind the camera, not in front, a lesson he
should have learned a few years ago when bombing as an interviewer on
KCET's "Life &amp; Times."</TE>
<TE>   His roundness and baldness are not relevant here, only his
tendency to cut off guests prematurely, stumble over words, belabor
topics and sourly present himself as superior. That came across when
he apologized "for the entire [news] industry" to the father of
missing Elizabeth Smart for its shift of focus to Samantha Runnion
from her. Yeah, like the media hasn't spent enough time on the Smart
abduction.</TE>
<TE>   As editor in chief, moreover, Nachman can assign himself to be
debriefed daily by anchor Lester Holt about the Runnion case, as if
his insights were unique. Obviously, he's not Nachman for nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Donahue, on the other hand, spent an entire career shaping and
tailoring himself to TV. For many years he was daytime's only
talk-show host with the smarts and debating, interviewing and
devil's-advocacy skills to go highbrow as often as low, and tackle
topics worldly and complex.</TE>
<TE>   When it came to ratings, though, that didn't stop his rear
appendage from getting ultimately kicked by Oprah and others heading
lesser talk shows, and his attempts to recast himself in their images
flopped badly.</TE>
<TE>   His first week on MSNBC produced some good interviews, including a
pair with Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) and Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) on
the U.S. Patriot Act that were admirably civil as well as
informative. Another came with NBC's Bob Costas about alleged illegal
steroid use in professional baseball.</TE>
<TE>   But the Feingold/Kyl chats followed a debate on the same act by
others that was deafeningly shrill and vitriolic to the point of
being incomprehensible, with Donahue either unable or unwilling to
rein it in. "I regret we are unable to have a civil wrap-up of this,"
he apologized later.</TE>
<TE>   And the Costas interview followed Donahue's stereophonic shout-out
with Pat Buchanan, whom MSNBC advertised here for promotional
purposes as a conservative "firebrand," even though it bills him
reverently as "one of America's leading conservative voices" for
"Buchanan and Press," its new talk show that he co-hosts with liberal
Bill Press.</TE>
<TE>   Donahue was shocked, just shocked, by his blowup with Buchanan. "I
didn't think we'd be screaming at each other here," he said
afterward. "Maybe we ought to go back to the drawing board."</TE>
<TE>   Puh-leeeeeeze, Phil, baby, sweetheart. Screaming is the drawing
board.</TE>

<HD>This Is My Life, Robert Evans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After sauntering to Sundance and holding court at Cannes,
barnstorming Robert Evans--the former boy
toy-turned-studio-chief-turned disgraced Hollywood pasha--will
finally bring his trademark throaty roar and suave '60s panache to
multiplexes across America on  Friday with the release of "The Kid
Stays in the Picture," the documentary, or rather, hagiography about
his life.</LD>
<LD>   Just a few years ago, Evans--the studio kingpin who backed such
legendary '70s films as "Chinatown," "Rosemary's Baby" and "The
Godfather"--was just another disgraced mogul, convicted of drug
charges, linked by innuendo to the infamous "Cotton Club murder" (for
which he was never charged), and almost irrelevant in the movie
business.</LD>
<LD>   Now he's the hippest guy in Hollywood, holding screenings of the
documentary, by Nanette Burstein and Brett Morgen, in his Beverly
Hills home for tout Hollywood--from old pals Warren Beatty and Jack
Nicholson, who knew the glory days, to up-and-coming directors Wes
Anderson and David O. Russell, who are witnesses to the revival.</LD>
<TE>   The film redefines the term "vanity project," and the filmmakers,
who were nominated for an Oscar for their boxing documentary, "On the
Ropes," note with the film's opening quote: "There are three sides to
every story: my side, your side and the truth. And no one is lying."</TE>
<TE>   The film is based on Evans' 1994 autobiography and is told
exclusively from Evans' point of view. It's a pastiche of photos and
rare footage (which Evans has squirreled away over the years),
chronicling the glory days and skating charmingly--but
elusively--over the dark underbelly. The high points include a tour
of the famous house and gardens, a young Dustin Hoffman impersonating
Evans and footage--shot by then newcomer Mike Nichols--of Evans
pleading with the board of Gulf and Western, then-owners of
Paramount, not to close the studio because he has some winners in the
can, including one called "The Godfather."</TE>
<TE>   You can take the interim title off Michelle Tuzee's anchoring
duties at KABC-TV. Tuzee, who began anchoring the 4, 6 and 11 p.m.
newscasts two weeks ago--after longtime anchor Laura Diaz left the
station for a job at KCBS-TV--will now officially headline those
newscasts alongside Marc Brown.</TE>
<TE>   A USC graduate who majored in journalism, Tuzee worked at TV
stations in Colorado, her native Wisconsin and Florida before joining
the "Eyewitness News" team in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   As is customary in local news, KABC took Diaz--a 19-year veteran
of the station--off the air as soon as she accepted the position at a
rival station.</TE>
<TE>   When the shift was announced, Diaz stressed that there was no
bitterness surrounding her departure, calling the new job "the
opportunity of a lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   David Ono, meanwhile, continues to anchor KABC's 5 p.m. newscast,
with a permanent co-anchor to replace Tuzee still to be determined.</TE>
<TE>   When the band Heart plays the Orange County Fair on Friday, fans
will notice a decidedly slimmer Ann Wilson. The singer has lost 50
pounds since surgeons placed a Lap-Band device around her stomach to
reduce her food intake, her doctor told Reuters news service last
week.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, 52, who with her guitar-playing sister, Nancy, was the
spark behind the 1970s and '80s rock group, underwent the surgery in
January, according to Dr. Brian B. Quebbemann, who performed the
"minimally invasive" procedure.</TE>
<TE>   Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year, the
Lap-Band is a belt placed around the stomach to limit its capacity
and produce an early feeling of "fullness," Quebbemann said.</TE>
<TE>   The band can be adjusted without further surgery to increase or
decrease the restriction on food intake. The surgery is designed for
individuals who are 100 pounds or more overweight, or for those who
are 75 pounds overweight with serious medical conditions attributed
to their obesity.</TE>
<TE>   It was not disclosed how much Wilson weighed before the surgery,
but the statement said she had lost 50 pounds in the first five
months and "expects to lose the vast majority of her excess weight."</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for the singer could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Quebbemann said one advantage of the Lap-Band over other
weight-loss procedures, such as gastric bypass surgery, was that it
avoids any cutting or stapling of the intestines or stomach. He also
said there was no risk of malnutrition.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the doctor said Wilson's surgery was at an Orange
County hospital, but Quebbemann said it can be done on an outpatient
basis for younger people.</TE>

<HD>For a Change, Reventon Fest a Fresh Latin Treat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERNESTO LECHNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a rule, festival-type concerts sponsored by Latin radio stations
are hit-and-miss affairs. What with the rapid succession of
lip-synching pop idols and the inevitable self-congratulatory remarks
by the station's DJs, music takes the back seat.</LD>
<LD>   The annual Reventon Super Estrella festival--sponsored by KSSE-FM
(97.5)--has been no exception over the years. The fifth edition,
however, Saturday at the Arrowhead Pond brought a refreshing change
of pace by offering a fulfilling variety of acts and genres.</LD>
<LD>   Oh, sure, the show still had its share of duds, namely a few
musical lightweights prancing to the sound of playback. But you had
to be a real grouch not to surrender to the contagious atmosphere
established by thousands of young fans partying to the sounds of
sticky merengue and arena-friendly rock en espanol.</LD>
<TE>   Mexico's Paulina Rubio, who's currently in the middle of a
breathless mission to cross over to mainstream America with an
English album, was the evening's first surprise.</TE>
<TE>   Rubio doesn't sound terribly appealing when she sings in English,
but she has definitely created an easily identifiable persona through
her wardrobe (a bizarre cross between trashy and bohemian) and her
ideological manifesto that celebrates womanhood and offers a positive
outlook on life.</TE>
<TE>   Although she seemed to be aided vocally by some pre-recorded tape,
it was hard not to be entertained by the split-timing precision and
the sheer energy of her performance, which brought to life the vibe
of an expensive music video.</TE>
<TE>   The quintessential pop diva, Rubio would stand still, waiting for
electric fans to blow air on her, making her hair float in an oddly
poetic way.</TE>
<TE>   And though Rubio's brand of feel-good pop is generic to say the
least, her "El Ultimo Adios" ( The Last Goodbye) is an intriguing
blend of old-fashioned ranchera and snappy electronica, one of Latin
music's most successful attempts in recent times to merge genres that
are seemingly contrasting.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Rubio, Elvis Crespo, whose music reflects the bouncy joys
of the merengue, has no aspirations of leaving a major multicultural
statement.</TE>
<TE>   The Puerto Rican singer has been on the rebound since his 2000
album, "Wow Flash," was a critical and sales disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   There's no need to come up with new hits, however, when the old
ones will do just fine, and the singer added extra oomph to old
favorites such as "Suavemente" (Softly) and "Pintame" (Paint Me).</TE>
<TE>   Because it lacks the rhythmic complexity of salsa, the
Dominican-born merengue fits into a pop context with its repetitive,
sinuous sax lines and syncopated tambora beats.</TE>
<TE>   If Crespo was Reventon's unexpected delight, Mexican starlet Fey,
one of the evening's most anticipated performers, was its biggest
disappointment. The singer has just released "Vertigo," an album that
forsakes her previous image as bubblegum pop princess in favor of a
more mature sound, heavily influenced by electronica and
sophisticated European pop.</TE>
<TE>   The collection is a brave step forward for Fey, who is
experimenting with sounds that are new to her. Unfortunately, her
brief appearance on Saturday did not replicate the album's daring
vision.</TE>
<TE>   Other performers Saturday included Rabanes, Pilar Montenego, Aleks
Syntek, Kabah, Serralde and Enanitos Verdes.</TE>

<HD>In Chaotic 'Movin' Out,' Dancing Off to the Vietnam War</HD>
<DH>The frenetic collaboration from Twyla Tharp and Billy Joel,
prepping in Chicago before Broadway, shows promise, aside from an
ill-conceived first act.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL PHILLIPS</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CHICAGO--If Oliver Stone did a Broadway dance musical--and truly,
that's not a suggestion--it might come out like the more risible
passages of "Movin' Out," the Twyla Tharp/Billy Joel collaboration
that opened its Shubert Theatre pre-Broadway tryout Friday after
several weeks of previews. It is a strenuous, chaotic, occasionally
exhilarating dance-play, in which America's war in Vietnam gets
blue-bagged for one more pop-cultural recycling.</LD>
<LD>   "Don't worry, the second act's better--much better," said the
waitress working the sidewalk tables at the Grillroom, across the
street from the Shubert, during Friday's intermission. She was
reassuring a couple of Playbill-wielding "Movin' Out" first-nighters.
And she was right; it is. Yet with a first act so pile-driving and
ill-conceived, the question remains: Is "better" better enough?</LD>
<TE>   The dance quotient alone may be enough to alienate a lot of Joel
fans, especially those who would've been content with a night of
nostalgic karaoke, in the style of the Abba-fueled "Mamma Mia!" Even
when director-choreographer Tharp's 27-person cast throws itself into
her sweatiest, most manic-depressive choreography, the engaging
athleticism of Act 2 cannot erase the misjudgments of Act 1. There's
a marijuana dream sequence that's at least as silly as anything in
"Reefer Madness," and when "Movin' Out" takes three of its central
characters to war, the resulting combat leaves half the audience
asking the other half: So what just happened? Who died? Huh?</TE>
<TE>   The story thread of "Movin' Out" covers 20 years in the lives of
archetypes from the Joel catalog. It begins in Hicksville, Long
Island, where the tune "Scenes From an Italian Restaurant" (from "The
Stranger") introduces Brenda (Elizabeth Parkinson) and Eddie (John
Selya), married but already bickering their way into a split.</TE>
<TE>   Brenda wants more of a life. She finds it with Tony (Keith
Roberts), the kid with the Peter Frampton hair who works in the
grocery store, savin' his pennies for someday. Meanwhile, Tony's
clean-cut brother, James (Benjamin G. Bowman), proposes to Judy
(Ashley Tuttle), to the tune of "Just the Way You Are." Then Eddie,
Tony and James go to Vietnam; James does not return; Tony suffers
from post-traumatic stress disorder; and Eddie descends into a
vaguely S&amp;M Greenwich Village milieu. The surviving characters emerge
sadder, wiser and, in the end, still friends.</TE>
<TE>   Tharp appears to have had a devil of a time determining how much,
or little, to deal with in terms of linear narrative. The
introduction scene, which brings Eddie onstage behind the wheel of a
Mustang, degenerates into a muddle of "local color" and
guess-the-principals. As the men march reluctantly into war--Scott
Wise plays a drill instructor, as well as Sgt. O'Leary, everybody's
favorite cop back home--the military maneuvers recall Tharp's work
for the film version of "Hair," albeit far less effectively.</TE>
<TE>   Act 2 improves, with the rageful "Angry Young Man" trio, led by
Selya, echoing Jerome Robbins' "West Side Story" anguish; "Big Shot,"
a shattered-nerves duet for Roberts and Parkinson; and a bookend duet
"Shameless," full of flying, grasping leaps. In these sequences the
show acquires some emotional lucidity, as well as storytelling
clarity.</TE>
<TE>   Ever-present piano man and Joel sound-alike Michael Cavanaugh
handles lead vocals. He fronts a good 10-piece band, suspended above
the frantic action onstage. The band gets a lot of visual competition
from Donald Holder's annoying "interactive" lighting design,
periodically blinding the audience with zap effects. Santo Loquasto's
unit set is a simple, rather disappointing amalgam of chain-link
fencing and Long Island anywhere-ville.</TE>
<TE>   A crazily uneven show is better than a relatively solid bore
anytime, and "Movin' Out" is, in fact, the former. More story isn't
really the answer. But the whole show needs to relax. Tharp and
company are going for a more dance-oriented version of "The Who's
Tommy," with its elegant assaultiveness, but they haven't shaped the
key relationships very well. The production is often stunningly
danced, with standout contributions from the menacingly gorgeous
Parkinson (her curls were destined to meet up with Roberts'; when
they pair up, it's like a curl-off) and the buoyant,
anti-gravitational Selya. Yet there's a hard-sell quality to "Movin'
Out," when it's not testing the audience's ability to track the often
opaque action.</TE>
<TE>   In "Nine Sinatra Songs," Tharp brought out the harsh beauty and
violence in a great American conundrum. If the Vietnam War was a
conundrum of a different sort, then "Movin' Out" is a spiritual
cousin to the Sinatra project--Tharp's attempt, on a bigger canvas,
to match a spiky dance vocabulary with popular song. There's probably
enough stuff in "Movin' Out" for Tharp to extract "Nine Joel Songs"
(well, six or seven, anyway).</TE>
<TE>   But first things first. If the satisfactions of the second act are
to add up to anything, the first-act quagmire must be addressed in
time for the planned October Broadway opening.</TE>

<HD>Shiite Mourning, Glory in N.Y.</HD>
<DH>Iranian folk theater, or Ta'ziyeh, is performed at Lincoln
Center's summer festival, exploring the theme of martyrdom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--While ever loved as a wonderful town, post-9/11 this
remains a wary town. In the subway, for instance, a slight smell of
smoke--common enough from small track fires or station renovation
work--was once ignored by hardened commuters but now generates
nervous looks and panicky exits. New York hops as it always does in
the summer, but the World Trade Center tragedy and fear of terrorism
are continuing undercurrents.</LD>
<LD>   This is not, then, an altogether welcoming atmosphere in which to
introduce the form of indigenous Iranian near-operatic music theater,
Ta'ziyeh, to America. Even so, Lincoln Center has done so, making
three Ta'ziyeh--passion plays about the origins of the Shiite sect of
Islam--one of the centerpieces of its annual summer festival.</LD>
<LD>   The Ta'ziyeh (there are some 200 of the plays) are dramatizations
of the massacre of the Prophet Muhammed's grandson, Iman Hussein, on
the Kerbala desert in AD 680 in a battle of succession. The Shiite
Muslims, who revere Hussein as a martyr, contended that Islam's
leaders should be descended from the prophet; the Sunnis favored
election.</LD>
<TE>   Begun in Iran 250 years ago as communal rituals of mourning
(Ta'ziyeh translates as mourning), Ta'ziyeh is a kind of folk
theater, which includes horsemanship and parades of sheep and camels.</TE>
<TE>   When performed in Iran, the audiences feel a familial closeness
with the historical figures. They weep and beat their breasts over
the death of Hussein and of the young children who also find their
way into martyrdom--all three of the Ta'ziyeh brought to Lincoln
Center included slain boys. So despised are the villains that it is
difficult for the faithful actors to portray them. At one time,
foreign prisoners were forced into the roles, and then beaten by
angry spectators after the performance.</TE>
<TE>   This is not exactly what the three Ta'ziyeh last week at Lincoln
Center were like, however. Because 10 of the 28 performers scheduled
to travel from Iran were denied U.S. visas by the State Department,
the scale was reduced. The performances were not held outdoors, but
in a big, blue circus tent in the center's Damrosch Park, the singers
and musicians competing with the roar of air-conditioning.</TE>
<TE>   We Westerners watched in the respectful silence we accord all
theater, but so did the Iranians in the audience, perhaps intimidated
by their surroundings. Good guys and bad got the same applause.</TE>
<TE>   There were a few outcries in the press about the inappropriateness
of glorifying martyrdom in today's New York. But the martyrdom
depicted is little different from that found in biblical stories, to
say nothing of the Homeric epic poems on which our modern literature
derives.</TE>
<TE>   The three Ta'ziyeh, all directed by Mohammad Ghaffari, were short
and straightforward, and their conventions easy to discern. Heroes
sing; villains speak; heroes wear graceful green and white robes;
villains wear silly and elaborate red costumes. The stage is a
circular platform surrounded by a dirt track. When someone circles it
on foot or horseback, he has changed locations. Everyone is a he;
veiled men dressed in black play the women's roles.</TE>
<TE>   A raucous ensemble of five musicians (trumpets and percussion) is
one of the highlights; their elaborations of modal melodies and
martial drumming almost sound like an Iranian version of some of the
further-out American jazz (Lester Bowie, in particular).</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps what proved most off-putting for the Lincoln Center
audience (there were empty seats all three nights I attended) was the
amateurish quality of the acting, although some of the singing was
quite impressive. Texts were not translated, but short synopses of
each scene were enough. The actors--most have day jobs that range
from mechanic to dentist to bazaar merchant--telegraph their
intentions with the urgent obviousness of actors in silent films. And
they don't worry about realism, often fussing with their garments.</TE>
<TE>   All children die in the same way: Their hands flutter over their
heart, their feet beat wildly, they quiver and then become motionless
(or pretty much so).</TE>
<TE>   The most spectacular of the three plays was "The Ta'ziyeh of Hor,"
in which Hussein's enemy, Hor, changes sides and dies a martyr, along
with his young son. Here was exciting horsemanship, a caravan of
camels and careless-looking swordplay. What struck most, though, was
the singing, with roles for three heroic tenors--Hor (Alaeaddin
Ghassemi), Hussein (Hassan Aliabbasi Jazi) and Hussein's brother
(Hassan Nargeskhani Deligani)--all in full declamation.</TE>
<TE>   "The Ta'ziyeh of the Children of Moslem," a last-minute substitute
due to the State Department's actions, is lyrical, pastorale
melodrama. Two young boys, children of Hussein's cousin, Moslem, are
tracked down and their throats cut. There is a touching scene in
which their dead father appears to his sleeping children and sings
them a lullaby, thereby startling the boys. Though in hiding, they
cry out and are discovered.</TE>
<TE>   But it was "The Ta'ziyeh of Iman Hussein" that proved the most
moving and fabulous. Not only does the Angel Gabriel make an
appearance, wearing a purple robe and gold crown, but there is a
comic scene in which travelers from the future in ludicrous
Napoleonic garb and wrap-around shades are rescued from a lion by
Iman Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The ending of "Hussein," though, revealed some of the emotional
intensity that this art form can produce at its best. The lion suit
may be off the rack, but in an extraordinary final scene, as he
wandered the battlefield mourning the slaughtered Hussein and his
family, his wails of anguish filled the tent with overwhelming
lyrical thunder. Powerful though this was, it seemed hardly
incendiary.</TE>
<TE>   Ta'ziyeh is, in fact, a dying art form in Iran, with performers
increasingly hard to find. I'm not sure how much its first
compromised tour to America teaches about the complexities of one
small branch of Islamic culture, but it was enough to display some
basic humanity and make one wish to know it in a more authentic way.</TE>

<HD>Stuart Edges His Fuzzy Nose Ahead of Hanks</HD>
<DH>Box Office* The mouse debuts at $15.6 million, only about
$30,000 more than 'Road to Perdition.'</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The continuing adventures of a talking mouse and the darkly alluring
story of a hit-man father's journey of vengeance fought to a virtual
tie for the No. 1 slot during a rare lull in this summer's box
office.</LD>
<LD>   "Stuart Little 2," the sequel about the computer-generated rodent,
voiced by Michael J. Fox, debuted with $15.6 million, according to
studio estimates released Sunday, just $30,000 ahead of the estimate
for "Road to Perdition."</LD>
<LD>   The Depression-era gangster tale starring Tom Hanks grossed $15.57
million in its second weekend.</LD>
<TE>   Rankings could change when final numbers are released today.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll settle it tomorrow, Stuart against Tom Hanks," said Jeff
Blake, head of distribution for Sony, which released "Stuart Little
2." Some observers had predicted the sequel would open with as much
as $25 million.</TE>
<TE>   The last time the No. 1 movie grossed such a low figure was in
February, when "Queen of the Damned" opened with $14.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Men in Black II," also from Sony, the No. 1 movie for two
straight weekends, fell to third place with an estimated $15 million,
lifting its 19-day total to $158.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Estimated total for the top 10 movies for Friday through Sunday
was $95.6 million, down 23% from last week, according to box-office
tracking firm Nielsen EDI, and down 27% from the top 10 tally of
$130.4 million in the comparable weekend last year, when "Jurassic
Park III" and "America's Sweethearts" took in nearly $50.8 million
and almost $30.2 million, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison Ford's Soviet submarine drama "K-19: The Widowmaker" from
Paramount premiered at No. 4 with $13.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros.' giant-spider spoof "Eight Legged Freaks," starring
David Arquette, was in seventh place with $6.7 million, pushing its
total to $9.3 million since opening Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax's "Tadpole," a favorite at the Sundance Film Festival,
opened strongly in limited release, taking in $80,000 at six
theaters.</TE>
<TE>   The original "Stuart Little" debuted with $15 million just before
Christmas in 1999, then held on and became a $140-million hit.
Because "Stuart Little" was a known franchise, industry executives
had expected the sequel to open with a higher gross.</TE>
<TE>   "With a family film, you hope for a good opening and great legs,"
Blake said. "You hope for seven-day-a-week business, where whatever
you lose in opening weekend you hope to pick up in the longevity of
the picture. That was the case with the first one, and I think
'Stuart' will be fine going forward."</TE>
<TE>   Playing in 3,255 theaters, "Stuart Little 2" averaged a modest
$4,793 per cinema, compared to a $5,218 average for the original.</TE>
<TE>   "Road to Perdition" expanded to 2,159 theaters and averaged
$7,212. Its 10-day total stands at $47.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   "K-19" averaged $4,632 in 2,828 theaters, and "Eight Legged
Freaks" had a weak average of $2,648 in 2,530 cinemas.</TE>
<TE>   Studio executives expect the overall box office to bounce back
next weekend when "Austin Powers in Goldmember" hits theaters. Adam
Sandler's "Mr. Deeds," also from Sony, took fifth place, with an
estimated $7.3 million and cumulative gross of $107.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Holding its own against the spiders in the creature-feature
department, Disney's futuristic dragon tale "Reign of Fire" inhaled
an estimated $7.1 million at No. 6, bringing its total to $29 million
after two weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Dimension Films' slasher movie retread "Halloween: Resurrection"
brought in an estimated $5.4 million in eighth place for a 10-day
total of $21.8 million</TE>
<TE>   With an estimate of $5.1 million in ninth place, Disney's
whimsical animated alien adventure "Lilo &amp; Stitch" brought its total
to $128.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the top 10 was MGM's "The Crocodile Hunter: Collision
Course," with an estimated $4.8 million and 10-day total of about
$18.9 million.</TE>

<HD>Fall on Fox: More 'Idol,' an Ad-Free '24' Episode</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fox will air a second installment of its teen talent contest
"American Idol" early next year and will also debut its
Emmy-nominated drama "24" with a commercial-free episode, top network
officials said Sunday at an annual gathering of television reporters
in Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   Without much else to crow about, such as ratings or the strength
of its overall schedule, the network replaced the obligatory opening
sales pitch with a choir, led in song by comedian Cedric the
Entertainer, who will have a new sitcom on Fox called "Cedric the
Entertainer Presents."</LD>
<LD>   Prayer is a fitting theme for Fox, whose ratings woes were
overshadowed during the 2001 television season by ABC's precipitous
declines. All the major broadcast networks face dwindling audience
shares as viewers scan through a host of options, but Fox and ABC
have felt it more acutely of late.</LD>
<TE>   While Fox used the Super Bowl and World Series to edge out CBS for
second place among viewers ages 18 to 49, coveted by advertisers, the
network, fourth in total viewers, faces the same challenge as
slumping ABC--to rebuild brand identity and draw attention to its
programming at a time of increasing viewer fragmentation, when even
critically lauded programming fails to make a ripple.</TE>
<TE>   "American Idol," in which aspiring young singers are whittled down
to finalists who compete for a recording contract, has at least given
Fox a boost in summer viewership, particularly among young females.
The first installment of the series has its finale Sept. 4, with the
second go-round to be broadcast sometime in 2003, said Gail Berman,
Fox's entertainment president.</TE>
<TE>   Fox will have another fall season in which coverage of the major
league baseball playoffs and World Series will stagger the roll-out
of its prime-time lineup over several months (assuming there is no
lockout or strike). While a host of series will start in September,
others, including "The Simpsons," "Malcolm in the Middle" and "Girls
Club," a new drama from David E. Kelley, won't debut until late
October or early November.</TE>
<TE>   And the network must also recover from the loss of both "Ally
McBeal" and "The X-Files," whose long runs on Fox ended last season
amid declining ratings.</TE>
<TE>   But Sandy Grushow, chairman of the Fox Television Entertainment
Group, argued that with the sitcom "The Bernie Mac Show" and the
critically acclaimed "24," Fox "did better than most" in introducing
new scripted series to audiences last season. "24," which struggled
for ratings despite critical raves, debuts on Oct. 29 in a
commercial-free episode sponsored by Ford Motor Co. There had been
speculation that Fox would change the show's serialized format (an
entire season tracks 24 hours in the chaotic counter-terrorism life
of Jack Bauer, played by Kiefer Sutherland). While offering few
specifics, Berman said the show's second season won't be undergoing
any radical format shifts.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bernie Mac Show," starring comedian Bernie Mac, is moving to
8 p.m. Wednesdays, opposite another sitcom with an African American
cast, ABC's "My Wife and Kids," starring Damon Wayans.</TE>

<LD>The new Fox series "24" and "The Bernie Mac Show" were named program
of the year and best comedy by the Television Critics Assn. at its
annual awards ceremony Saturday in Pasadena, with another honor going
to the latter's star, Bernie Mac, for best achievement in comedy.</LD>
<LD>   The series "24," starring Kiefer Sutherland, drew modest ratings
and almost wasn't renewed for a second year.</LD>
<LD>   HBO, following an industry-leading haul in last week's Emmy
nominations, also garnered honors for its drama "Six Feet Under" and
miniseries "Band of Brothers." The remaining dramatic award went to
Michael Chiklis, star of the FX crime drama "The Shield."</LD>
<TE>   Additional awards went to PBS' "Frontline" as best news show and
Nickelodeon's "SpongeBob SquarePants" for children's programming.
Bill Cosby and "The Simpsons" were also recognized with career and
heritage awards, the latter for its "impact on society and popular
culture."</TE>
<TE>   The group consists of more than 200 print critics and reporters in
North America. Some major critics do not participate, including The
Times' Howard Rosenberg and the Washington Post's Tom Shales.</TE>

<HD>A Home Run in the Ninth for Pacific Symphony</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Using a baseball metaphor no doubt tied in with the summer season,
the Pacific Symphony called its program at Irvine's Verizon Wireless
Amphitheatre on Saturday night "Classic Heavy Hitters"--the
"sluggers" in question being Beethoven and Mozart. Let's run with
that a bit; while Beethoven's mighty Symphony No. 9 is certainly a
home run-sized opus--a grand slam, actually--Mozart's less grandly
proportioned Concerto No. 10 for two pianos is more like a solid
leadoff single to left field, or perhaps more accurately, a double,
from this great contact hitter.</LD>
<LD>   Conductor Carl St.Clair reconfirmed previous impressions that he
has Mozart in his grip, with disciplined, lean yet vibrant textures
backing the crisp duo-piano team of Arianna Goldina and Remy
Loumbrozo. In effect, St.Clair seemed to use the Ninth's opening
movements as a transition from Mozart's classical niceties, producing
robust yet precisely etched lines and fast-leaning tempos. Nor was
St.Clair in any mood to linger over the slow movement, taking the
Andante moderato tempo marking at its word.</LD>
<TE>   The huge choral finale can actually seem anticlimactic in poorly
paced performances, but there was no danger of that Saturday night.
St.Clair was aiming his sights upon a big finish and he pulled it
off, culminating with a warp-speed coda slamming along faster and
faster as it went. Moreover, he had the tools for the job, from the
big-boned cello-bass recitatives at the beginning to the stentorian,
slightly driven quartet of vocal soloists, the fervent Pacific
Chorale--and last, but not least, excellent outdoor amplification. At
the right times, you could feel the electricity and sense of occasion
that a good performance of the Ninth should produce.</TE>

<HD>Mendes, Pink Martini Bring Lounge to the Bowl</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERNESTO LECHNER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lounge revival of the '90s has given us plenty of campy fun--and
a bunch of Martin Denny reissues. But the newly emerged genre has
also allowed us an opportunity to reevaluate pop innovators such as
Sergio Mendes, and enjoy the beautiful creations of new groups like
Pink Martini.</LD>
<LD>   Lounge and its bubbly, tongue-in-cheek mystique were at the core
of Friday's show at the Hollywood Bowl, where Pink Martini and Mendes
performed accompanied by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, with Charles
Floyd conducting.</LD>
<LD>   In the case of Pink Martini, the combination was irresistible. Led
by pianist Thomas Lauderdale, the 11-piece ensemble has always
exhibited an orchestral approach in its arrangements, going as far as
beginning its shows with a stripped-down, jazzy version of Ravel's
"Bolero."</LD>
<TE>   On "Que Sera Sera," the orchestra's sweeping strings, Lauderdale's
minimalist, haunting piano line and China Forbes' crystalline singing
created a phantasmagoric effect, as if Doris Day had teamed up with
Tim Burton for a Halloween flick.</TE>
<TE>   Across the spectrum, Mendes and his combo favor fuller, more
conventional arrangements that can sound a bit muddy. Whereas Pink
Martini throws itself to lounge with restraint, Mendes clutters his
arrangements with unflattering keyboard sounds and over-the-top sax
solos. Still, there was a lot to enjoy in Mendes' fluffy
extravaganza.</TE>

<LD>As if the dating scene weren't already stressful enough and the
thought of unsolicited parental input didn't induce shuddering, NBC
offers an entry in the surreality TV category to take it all to
another level.</LD>
<LD>   "Meet My Folks" (premiering tonight at 10, then continuing
Wednesdays at 8) is an odd cocktail of the 2000 movie "Meet the
Parents," starring Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller, and MTV's "The
Real World," leaving the three male contestants both shaken and
stirred. Each episode follows three bachelors braving a weekend with
a single woman--oh, and her mom and dad.</LD>
<LD>   In the premiere, average guys Kory, Christopher and Jason vie for
Senta's affection--and more important, Rhoda and Randy Blankenship's
approval. Although Senta seems intrigued, Dad is less than impressed
with the guys, particularly as more is learned about each.</LD>
<TE>   Every time the doorbell rings, another bone appears as skeletons
are shoved from their respective closets. The men are confronted with
and confounded by letters from former employers and so-called best
friends, as well as ex-girlfriends in the flesh.</TE>
<TE>   From the physical challenge initiated by the dad, a
whistle-wearing football coach, to a lie detector test, the three
suitors spend most of the weekend on edge. The prize: The surviving
beau gets a week in Hawaii with the young woman. (Note that the
vacation is longer than the time the parents get for scrutinizing the
guy and that the closing credits indicate the couple don't have to
go.)</TE>
<TE>   Of course, this is contrived "reality." People generally don't
have to process that much information--dirty little secrets and
all--about a prospective mate while being bombarded with video-taped
revelations and ghosts of relationships past at every turn. And we
learn little if anything about the young woman.</TE>
<TE>   That being said, the show, in all of its calculated glory, has a
quality that's more riveting than a freeway chase.</TE>

<HD>A Midsummer's Seduction</HD>
<DH>Italian ballet troupe Aterballetto makes desire the driving
force in the Shakespeare play.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most new Shakespeare ballets prove so relentlessly intent on
recycling solid-gold titles, familiar plots, preexisting scores and
standard classroom step-combinations that they exist in a little
world of their own--irrelevant to the way the plays are staged by
major directors.</LD>
<LD>   In contrast, Aterballetto's millennial "A Midsummer Night's Dream"
(a.k.a. "Il Sogno di Una Notte di Mezza Estate") dares to take
Shakespeare seriously. The leaders of this groundbreaking Italian
ballet company assume that Shakespeare's plays still dominate the
dramatic repertory for some deeper reason than force of habit. So
they enlist a constellation of contemporary artists to create a
bracingly sardonic dance interpretation of one his most popular
comedies.</LD>
<LD>   At the ballet's American premiere, Friday in the Orange County
Performing Arts Center, a program note by choreographer-company
director Mauro Bigonzetti spoke of desire as the driving force of the
play, "a mysterious power that judges and controls."</LD>
<TE>   A red-caped Puck, danced with menacing glee by Veronique Dina
Jean, becomes the embodiment of that power, a lord of misrule who can
capriciously derail even the conventionally celebratory finale by
giving everyone in the cast one more outbreak of that overwhelming
inner itch.</TE>
<TE>   A recent modern-dance "Dream" by Bejart Ballet Lausanne
choreographer Philippe Saire is even more radical in depicting the
power of nature to overthrow rational behavior, but Bigonzetti's
large-scale version preserves more of the play's structure and
characters. Classical ballet may form the technical base of his
choreography, but the style is notably twisty, twitchy, eclectic and
off-center, with lifts initially serving as a symbol of male attempts
to own or control women--until those women rebel.</TE>
<TE>   A female Puck reinforces the sexual politics of the work by making
the relationship with Oberon (the charismatic Cyril Griset) more
complex, but you can usually rely on Bigonzetti to seek out the
darkest implications of his Shakespearean source and turn them into
potent movement theater.</TE>
<TE>   Puck's magical transformation of Bottom, for instance, here
becomes a painful process that terrifies the superbly malleable
Walter Matteini the way a sudden, drastic body change would frighten
anyone. And after Bottom has become an ungainly beast, Ina Broeckx
plays Titania as initially repelled by him but inevitably consumed by
lust.</TE>
<TE>   If you want a cute donkey mask and coy mime flirtations, there are
plenty of other "Dream" ballets to serve you. This one, however, is
comedy from the culture that produced "The Divine Comedy," not
exactly a compendium of mirth. And its expressive ambitions are
superbly reflected in a complex, varied symphonic score (on tape) by
rocker Elvis Costello.</TE>
<TE>   Evoking Baroque pomp in the court of Theseus and jazz riffs in the
forest of Oberon, it is most of all poignantly involved in the plight
of young lovers lost in the woods and torn by emotions they cannot
control or understand.</TE>
<TE>   The physical production, however, causes problems. Initially
sheeted in silver, Fabrizio Plessi's arrangement of lashed logs (five
horizontal, one vertical) require too many intimate scenes to be
played far upstage. Worse, Guglielmo Capone's costumes keep everyone
except Puck in the same colors (black and white up to the finale,
then beige), making it extraordinarily difficult to tell apart the
characters in the darkness, enforced by lighting designer Carlo
Cerri.</TE>
<TE>   The 21-member company, however, generates its own luminescence,
whether dressed in workmen's clothes and unveiling the major
characters as a kind of living waxworks (not one of Bigonzetti's most
purposeful ideas), or dressed in asymmetrical black bodysuits as
willful, and dangerous, forest creatures.</TE>
<TE>   Duets for the young lovers dominate the choreographic text, with
Hermia (Macha Daudel), Helena (Sveva Berti), Lysander (Adrien
Boissonnet) and Demetrius (Thibaut Cherradi) integrating a daunting
array of choreographic and expressive priorities with spectacular
flair.</TE>
<TE>   As in many stagings of the play, they are progressively stripped
of their illusions and their clothes as the forest confronts them
with their basic needs and natures. However, after their
relationships are sorted out, Bigonzetti rewards them (and the
audience) with a scene in which Plessi's giant, priapic oak rises in
the air and they bathe in the gentle shower issuing from its base.</TE>
<TE>   If there's anything more alluring than naked Italians, it's got to
be naked wet Italians, so this "Midsummer Night's Dream" not only
depicts desire, but generates plenty of it during its memorably
probing, sensual and adult reinvention of the Shakespearean
story-ballet as a vehicle for major artists and companies.</TE>

<HD>ABC Bets Heavily on Fall Show</HD>
<DH>Media: Hoping to reverse its ratings slide, the TV network
is placing the quirky new 'Push, Nevada' in a key time slot against
some stiff competition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ABC's hopes for the fall TV season, and for reversing its programming
slide, come down to a "push."</LD>
<LD>   In blackjack, a push is a game that ends in a tie and the gambler
doesn't lose his money on the table. Likewise, ABC is gambling big by
placing one of its hottest prospects -- a mystery-drama called "Push,
Nevada" -- on Thursdays at 9 p.m., one of the most competitive time
slots in network television.</LD>
<LD>   ABC executives concede that it's risky to put a quirky new show
about an IRS agent probing a casino embezzlement scheme against two
established, Emmy-nominated hits: CBS' "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation" and NBC's comedy "Will &amp; Grace."</LD>
<TE>   "We expect there's a lot of people sitting around going, 'What are
we going to watch on television on Thursday nights?' " joked Ben
Affleck, executive producer and co-creator of "Push, Nevada," last
week at the Television Critics Assn. conference in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   But ABC Entertainment Television Group Chairman Lloyd Braun told
Affleck the network is not expecting "Push, Nevada" to finish first
or even second in the ratings for that time period. "We just told
them to produce a show of great quality in which you can maintain or
grow a loyal audience," Braun said.</TE>
<TE>   After last year's dismal showing, ABC's strategy for the fall
season is to stop the ratings decline and regain momentum. The
network lost 20% of its prime-time audience last year and fell to
fourth place among viewers aged 18 to 49, the group advertisers pay
the most to reach.</TE>
<TE>   The network realizes that it will take more than a year to rebuild
its prime-time lineup, Braun said. So, ABC is positioning itself by
offering new shows that executives hope will grab viewers who might
be getting tired of aging Thursday night hits, such as NBC's
"Friends" and "ER" or CBS' "Survivor."</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC, plans to heavily promote "Push,
Nevada" on ABC and at Disney's theme parks and on its cable channels
such as ESPN. The company is betting the show will make a splash
among viewers aged 18 to 34 and spawn a cadre of loyal fans who will
be obsessed with "Push, Nevada's" side show--an interactive Internet
treasure hunt offering more than $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the 13th episode, the person or team that finds the
"stolen money" wins the $1-million-plus prize. Said Affleck, "There's
nothing like a cheap gimmick to get people to watch your show."</TE>
<TE>   Treasure hunt clues will be revealed during each episode that
follows an IRS agent who travels to a strange and corrupt Nevada
town. Clues will take the form of room numbers, Web site addresses or
fax numbers that flash on the screen. "Push, Nevada" is being pitched
as "Twin Peaks" meets "Blair Witch Project."</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a risk," Braun said Thursday. "But hits do come
from the fringes."</TE>
<TE>   So far, "Push, Nevada" has been the network's most popular new
show among advertisers. ABC has signed up two companies as program
sponsors to get their products incorporated into background scenes
and as part of the clues for the treasure hunt. A deal for a third
corporate sponsor is in the works, said Alex Wallau, president of the
ABC Television Network.</TE>
<TE>   ABC could have placed the show in a less competitive time period
to slowly build a fan base. Instead, the network is hoping to quickly
cash in on the big ad money that movie studios spend for commercials
on Thursday nights to promote their films for the weekend. "Push,
Nevada" probably will appeal to the same young crowd that flocks to
cinema megaplexes on weekends and to Internet chat rooms.</TE>
<TE>   The show will cost nearly $2 million an episode to produce, the
industry average for an hourlong drama. Disney executives say they
expect to make money on the show, but it could bomb if the treasure
hunt clues are too difficult, if viewers who miss a few episodes feel
they can't keep up with the unfolding story or if the show's creative
team devotes too much time to the treasure hunt rather than creating
intriguing stories.</TE>
<TE>   "The story has to be engaging. It has to be a compelling show,"
agreed another executive producer of the show, Sean Bailey.</TE>
<TE>   ABC had little to lose by putting "Push, Nevada" in a key time
slot, said media analyst David W. Miller of investment banking firm
Sanders Morris Harris.</TE>
<TE>   "If the show works and it gets down to the wire, then Disney will
have that much more [advertising] inventory to sell via the
interactive portion on the Internet," Miller said. "If the show hits,
it will be huge for ABC on Thursday nights, which is the most
important night for advertisers."</TE>
<TE>   Early on, the show's producers worried that viewers might not
sympathize with an IRS agent. "But nowadays with all these corruption
and accounting scandals we actually were kind of precognitive in a
way," said Affleck, who has written two episodes but does not plan to
appear on the show. "And we thought, they're going to put us on
against 'CSI' and 'Will &amp; Grace' anyway, what does it really matter,
we might as well make him an IRS agent."</TE>

<HD>Banks Benefiting From Low Rates</HD>
<DH>Finance: A surge in deposits is providing cheap funds to
fuel the home loan market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If your banker seems irrationally exuberant these days, blame Alan
Greenspan.</LD>
<LD>   Since the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark short-term interest
rate last year to a 40-year low of 1.75%, stock indexes have tumbled
while the economy's performance has been mixed, with weakness
persisting in some key sectors.</LD>
<LD>   But through it all, many banking institutions might as well have
been printing money.</LD>
<TE>   Despite a 55% increase in losses on loans industry-wide last year,
to levels higher than in the savings and loan crisis year of 1991,
bank profits overall set records that have continued this year--as
second-quarter reports from many institutions have demonstrated.</TE>
<TE>   The chief reason: a highly favorable interest rate environment,
with a surge in low-cost bank deposits providing cheap funds to fuel
the booming mortgage refinance and home-equity loan markets.</TE>
<TE>   Because the next move in interest rates probably is up, banks may
be nearing the end of this particular chapter, analysts say. But for
the near term, the banks' financial health is a pillar of strength
for an economy now threatened by the stock market's ongoing woes.</TE>
<TE>   Second-quarter financial results released last week by major banks
and thrifts showed strong earnings growth. Washington Mutual Inc. in
Seattle said earnings rose 23% from a year earlier, to $984 million;
Wells Fargo &amp; Co. in San Francisco said profit was up 17% to $1.4
billion; New York-based Citigroup Inc., the nation's largest bank,
earned $4.1 billion, up 15%; City National Corp. in Beverly Hills
posted earnings up 16%, to $45.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   Many banks have cited a continuing tidal wave of money flowing
into basic savings accounts and money market deposit accounts, even
as average interest rates paid on those accounts have fallen below
2%. Some of that money has come from investors who have fled the
stock market, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis show that, from
May 2001 through June 2002, money in bank and S&amp;L savings accounts
rose from just over $2 trillion to more than $2.5 trillion--an
increase of more than $500 billion in a little over a year.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the money that has moved into short-term bank accounts has
come out of bank certificates of deposit.</TE>
<TE>   Executives at Newport Beach-based Downey Financial Corp. say many
of the thrift's savers decided the small additional interest to be
earned on, say, one-year CDs, wasn't worth tying up the funds for
that long a period.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd rather have the liquidity, so when rates start back up
they'll be able to move right back" into higher-paying CDs, said
Downey Chief Financial Officer Thomas E. Price.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, the amount in CDs of $100,000 or less fell from about
$1.05 trillion in May 2001 to $924 billion as of July 8, according to
the St. Louis Fed.</TE>
<TE>   Though rates on basic savings accounts and money market deposit
accounts might appear paltry, at many banks the returns are better
than the record-low 1.3% average yield on taxable money market mutual
funds.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, because bank savings and money market accounts are
federally insured and absolutely liquid, they have provided peace of
mind for many investors amid the stock market's plunge and fears of
new terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, on the lending side, rates on mortgages and other loans
also have fallen over the last year, but they haven't dropped as much
as rates on bank deposits, which are more sensitive to changes in the
Fed's short-term rate.</TE>
<TE>   At Downey, deposits in passbook and money market accounts more
than tripled, from $986 million on June 30, 2001, to $3.08 billion at
the end of last month. During that 12-month period, Downey's average
interest rate on such accounts fell a full percentage point, from
3.4% to 2.4%.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the average rate on 30-year conventional mortgages
nationwide fell less than a point, from 7.11% to 6.55%, in the same
period.</TE>
<TE>   Wells Fargo said its average interest rate "spread" in the second
quarter--the difference between its average cost of money and its
average loan rate--was 5.66 percentage points, up from 5.31 points a
year earlier. The bank's net interest income jumped 21% in the
quarter from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   At City National, net interest income rose 24% in the second
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   At Wells Fargo and other lenders, profits also have been bolstered
by heavy demand for consumer loans.</TE>
<TE>   Wells Fargo said commercial loan demand was essentially flat in
the second quarter compared with a year earlier. But demand for
consumer loans, including mortgages, grew by more than 20%.</TE>
<TE>   City National's total loans were up 21% in the quarter, with
strong growth in commercial and construction lending as well as
mortgages, the bank said.</TE>
<TE>   That reflects City National's emphasis on business lending and its
location in Southern California, which Chief Executive Russell
Goldsmith said remains one of the best-performing regional economies
in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   But even as banks revel in the current success, some analysts warn
that profits could face a squeeze soon.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Michael Mayo, who follows large banks for brokerage
Prudential Securities Inc. in New York, wrote recently that interest
rate spreads are no longer widening for many banks.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe banks have reaped nearly all of the benefits of the
low-interest-rate environment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If the economy continues to recover, and the Fed begins to raise
short-term rates later this year, worries about a bank profit squeeze
could accelerate.</TE>
<TE>   Investors in general seem more concerned. Bank stocks held up well
in April and May, even as the broad market declined. But since early
June many bank shares have fallen sharply along with the rest of the
market.</TE>
<TE>   An index of 24 major bank shares has tumbled 19% since May 31. The
blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index is down 20.6% in the same
period.</TE>
<TE>   Year to date the bank stock index is down 17%, and the S&amp;P 500 is
down 26.2%.</TE>

<LD>A new rule forcing corporate leaders to vouch personally for the
accuracy of their companies' financial statements has set off a legal
scramble, as worried executives search for ways to protect themselves
from potential civil or criminal liability.</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission rule requires chief
executives and chief financial officers of large companies to sign
sworn statements by mid-August declaring that recent financial
reports are accurate and complete.</LD>
<LD>   Though companies always have been required to provide accurate
data, the personal declarations could ratchet up executives' legal
liability if errors--honest or otherwise--turn up later.</LD>
<TE>   That has prompted CEOs to take such steps as rechecking accounting
procedures, boosting personal liability insurance and forcing
subordinates to sign similar statements under oath, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people are saying, 'Oh my Lord, what does this mean? What
should I do?' " said David Becker, a former SEC lawyer now at Cleary
Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton in New York. Some executives feel as if
they're "in the cross-hairs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The new rule could further roil the stock market in the next few
weeks. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and others have
predicted that some CEOs, as they review their books, will be forced
to restate past financial results.</TE>
<TE>   Executives' increased legal vulnerability also could have broader
implications longer term, some experts say.</TE>
<TE>   At an extreme, it could discourage qualified people from becoming
CEOs or CFOs.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point, you rack up the liability so high that you don't
get good people" to take these jobs, said Seth Taube, a securities
lawyer at McCarter &amp; English in Newark, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC enacted the rule June 28 following the wave of corporate
accounting scandals that began with Enron Corp.'s collapse in
December.</TE>
<TE>   CEOs and CFOs must sign an SEC-scripted statement in which they
declare "to the best of [their] knowledge" that their financial
reports are correct.</TE>
<TE>   Executives could avoid signing by telling the SEC why they can't
make such an assurance. But few CEOs are expected to take that route
because it would raise doubts about their company's accounting and
almost certainly crush their stock.</TE>
<TE>   The rule affects 947 publicly traded companies with annual revenue
exceeding $1.2 billion. The forms for many companies, though not all,
are due Aug. 14. The deadline depends on which fiscal periods a
company uses for its financial reporting.</TE>
<TE>   The sworn statements will apply to the 2001 annual reports that
each company already has filed, as well as to quarterly data released
so far this year. The SEC has proposed making the rule permanent.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC realizes that chiefs of huge companies can't verify the
accuracy of every financial detail, experts say. But regulators want
to force them to pay closer attention to the way their staffs compile
and report numbers.</TE>
<TE>   One goal of the SEC rule also is to prevent CEOs from using what
has recently been a common defense when companies' accounting has
been exposed as troubled or fraudulent: that the CEO relied on
subordinates and was unaware of the financial minutiae.</TE>
<TE>   Some executives say they welcome the new rule.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Delphi Corp., a Troy, Mich.-based auto-parts maker,
became the first company to file the certifications.</TE>
<TE>   J.T. Battenberg III, Delphi's CEO, said he stands behind his
company's financial statements and believes the SEC rule will allow
executives to send a clear message that most companies have used
proper accounting.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to do whatever we've got to do to protect our companies
and our people" amid the cloud of mistrust hanging over corporate
America, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Before filing the certifications, Battenberg held meetings with
the audit committee of Delphi's board of directors and with the
company's outside auditors to ensure the accuracy of the financial
reports, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Delphi also required the chiefs and CFOs of its seven divisions to
sign similar statements, Battenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   However, executives at some companies are unnerved by the unknown
legal ramifications of personally certifying the financial results,
experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "CEOs are nervous because they don't know what [will happen] if
someone three levels below them makes a mistake," Taube said.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts predict that many CEOs will do what Battenberg did
and require similar sworn statements from subordinates, figuring they
could be used as a defense if accounting problems are exposed later.</TE>
<TE>   Executives could face heightened legal exposure in two ways.
First, a signed declaration makes it easier for prosecutors to bring
criminal charges, especially for perjury.</TE>
<TE>   Also, CEOs could face an increased threat of civil litigation from
regulators or from aggrieved investors.</TE>
<TE>   Some executives have sought to limit their liability by asking for
permission to modify the wording of the certifications they file. The
SEC has balked at the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "We are dismayed that respected members of the bar seem to be
spending a great deal of effort in searching for a way to advise CEOs
and CFOs on how to weasel out of complying with the clear intent of
the order," said Martin P. Dunn, deputy director of the SEC's
corporation-finance division in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The agency said it will make the declarations public on its Web
site (www.sec.gov) soon after they're turned in. Companies that file
the statements according to the SEC's specifications will be grouped
in one category. Those that don't will be batched in a second
category where their lack of compliance would be readily apparent to
investors.</TE>
<TE>   CEOs normally are protected from personal legal liability by
so-called directors and officers insurance, which their companies buy
for them.</TE>
<TE>   The insurance pays executives' legal bills and any settlements or
judgments if they are shown to have been negligent. It does not cover
fraud, however.</TE>
<TE>   D&amp;O insurance coverage is likely to include the risks created by
the new certifications, some experts say.</TE>
<TE>   But if damages exceed the value of the policies, or if companies
go bankrupt, executives still could face personal liability.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, many companies have been trying to ramp up their
insurance coverage--one reason D&amp;O premiums have been rapidly
escalating.</TE>
<TE>   D&amp;O premiums for large companies have surged by 100% to 600% this
year over last year, said John Keogh, president of the D&amp;O unit of
giant insurer American International Group in New York, which
dominates the D&amp;O market.</TE>

<HD>Directors Taking Prudent Steps</HD>
<DH>Oversight: As scrutiny grows, boards at Amgen and other
companies work to stay scandal-free.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID STREITFELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The board of directors of Amgen Inc. will convene later this month in
the long shadow of WorldCom Inc. as well as a half-dozen other
once-admired companies, all of them now under investigation for
alleged fraud.</LD>
<LD>   By almost any measure, Amgen is a world apart from WorldCom. Its
13 directors are an accomplished group, including a retired Air Force
secretary, a Nobel laureate and a former Hollywood studio chief. The
company is a leader in biotechnology, not telecommunications. Its
headquarters in Thousand Oaks is 1,800 miles from WorldCom's
Mississippi offices. And most important, it hasn't been subject to a
whisper of the sort of accounting scandal that is leading to
WorldCom's meltdown.</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, that $3.9-billion hole in WorldCom's books means
this Amgen meeting won't be quite like any previous ones. Already the
board is beginning to change the way it does business.</LD>
<TE>   "There will be differences in mood and differences in practice,"
said board member Donald Rice, a former Air Force secretary turned
entrepreneur.</TE>
<TE>   Another director, former McKinsey &amp; Co. and Bechtel Group Inc.
executive Frederick W. Gluck, said there would be a wholesale review
to "make sure we don't have any situations that might lead to a
problem. It's just prudent."</TE>
<TE>   In an era when new corporate scandals surface every week, no board
can be too careful. They're under scrutiny and frequently under
attack. The stock exchanges are tightening board rules for their
listed companies, trying to eliminate cronyism and dabblers. Congress
is being swept by reform fever, while business critics see a
once-in-a-lifetime chance at real change.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, boards are beset by increased liability worries.
Traditionally, it has been very difficult to hold directors
personally responsible for corporate meltdowns. Regardless of whether
that's changing in reality, it's shifting in perception.</TE>
<TE>   "Your home, your assets, your business reputation" are at risk,
wrote Philip Crowley, assistant general counsel at Johnson &amp; Johnson,
in the National Assn. of Corporate Directors' monthly newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   All this means it's getting harder to find new directors.
Christian &amp; Timbers, the global executive search firm, said that
although turnover on boards has doubled, six out of 10 candidates are
turning down seats. A year ago, seven out of 10 accepted them.</TE>
<TE>   "A year ago, if you called someone up and asked him if he'd like
to be on the board of Enron, he would say yes because it was a great
company," said Christian &amp; Timbers Chief Executive Jeffrey Christian.
"There were many great companies then."</TE>
<TE>   A Changing Role</TE>
<TE>   As the ranks of those greats rapidly dwindle, the change is
bringing up fundamental questions about the role of boards. State
incorporation laws mandate their existence and oversight role but
give directors wide latitude with regard to performance, composition
and size.</TE>
<TE>   The modern corporate board traces its origins to Renaissance
England. The Virginia Co. of London and the Virginia Co. of Plymouth,
which pioneered the European settlement of the Atlantic Coast, were
run by outside councils responsible to the sovereign. Alexander
Hamilton and Ben Franklin started companies that had oversight
boards.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, boards looked after the interests of the owners. With
the rise of the professional manager and the modern corporation,
boards began to be more aligned with the new owners: stockholders.
But the distance between the directors and the stockholders,
particularly in times of prosperity, is vast.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, many investors probably would have been
hard-pressed to name the board members of their stock picks. The
chief executive got all the attention. Who cares about oversight when
everyone's making money?</TE>
<TE>   Now that the market's falling, measures being discussed by
reformers include making boards more independent by barring the
typical practice of making a company's chief executive its board
chairman as well; limiting the number of outside boards a chief
executive can serve on; and issuing regular report cards on board
members.</TE>
<TE>   If grades were being issued today, many of them would be of the
"failing" variety.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely and deservedly, boards are getting a bad press," said
Roger Raber, president of the National Assn. of Corporate Directors.</TE>
<TE>   He breaks down public-company board members into three main types:
the rubber stampers, who don't let anything delay getting to the golf
course; the oversight board members, who make an effort to examine
what is really going on but can still be bamboozled by crooked
executives; and the activists, who do their job well but number no
more than 10% of the total.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest obstacle to a good board is arrogance," Raber said.
"With some directors, there's a sense of entitlement. 'I'm a former
chief executive, I'm high profile, I'm here as long as I want to be.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Amgen's board is filled with high-profile names--in addition to
Gluck and Rice, it includes Caltech President and Nobel laureate
David Baltimore, former Universal Studios Chief Executive Frank
Biondi, former Allstate Corp. Chairman Jerry Choate and venture
capitalist Franklin Johnson Jr. But the company's chief executive,
Kevin Sharer, said they're anything but aloof or disengaged.</TE>
<TE>   In an e-mail to Amgen's 7,630 employees last winter, after the
crash of Enron Corp. thrust the issue of corporate wrongdoing to the
forefront, Sharer declared that the Amgen board members "pay
attention, ask tough questions and get the full and accurate picture
from management in a timely fashion. We have a more interactive,
lively and engaged board than any I have seen."</TE>
<TE>   Inability to Spot Fraud</TE>
<TE>   But it's another matter whether such a board could prevent
executives who were determined to use unsavory or illegal methods to
enrich themselves. Christian &amp; Timbers recently asked 225 executives
at top corporations if they thought their boards could recognize
"cooked" books. More than half said no.</TE>
<TE>   The Enron board, after all, was saluted in 1999 as one of the
nation's finest by Chief Executive magazine. Early this year, an
investigation commissioned by the Enron board concluded that the
directors should have demanded more information, probed more and
understood matters better.</TE>
<TE>   In essence, said New York investment banker and board watchdog
Gary Lutin, boards have been "not just outgunned but outsmarted."</TE>
<TE>   "Ten years ago, a clever executive could get away with stealing
maybe $10 million," Lutin said. "But in the late '90s, it was as if
we put a whole lot of money on the table and turned the lights out.
If you think that's not going to attract thieves, you're crazy."</TE>
<TE>   In practice, though, even the best boards have seen themselves
less like police and more like professors--pushing the good and
waving off the misguided ideas, counseling and encouraging, offering
the benefits of their superior experience.</TE>
<TE>   They also "make sure the management does its homework," Sharer
said.</TE>
<TE>   When a small acquisition was being discussed by the Amgen board a
few years ago, Gluck thought the price was too high.</TE>
<TE>   "Given what we've heard, this doesn't seem reasonable," he
remembered telling the other directors. Eventually, an offer was made
at a lower price.</TE>
<TE>   Several directors pushed for Amgen to increase its in-house
research and development and its access to outside innovation.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought the pipeline wasn't as rich as it should be, and
pushed for more licensing," said Gilbert Omenn, executive vice
president for medical affairs at the University of Michigan and an
Amgen director since 1987.</TE>
<TE>   During Amgen's acquisition this year of Seattle-based Immunex
Corp. in a $9.6-billion deal, the board encouraged Sharer to set up a
stand-alone integration committee--something he hadn't been planning
to do but realized would be useful.</TE>
<TE>   All of this sounds, and indeed was, more incremental than
earth-shaking.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes the board agrees where management is headed and
sometimes it doesn't, but you don't try to make a fight out of it,"
said Rice, who sits on five corporate boards and is chief executive
of a small private biotech company.</TE>
<TE>   A track record of disagreements, he noted, might serve as
ammunition for suits by dissident shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   But if too much of an adversarial position can be bad for a
company in the short run, too little can be disastrous over the long
term. The result is that boards are fumbling uncertainly toward a new
role.</TE>
<TE>   One thing the Amgen board is going to start doing immediately is
detailing exactly what it does.</TE>
<TE>   "The committee charters will get written with much more
specificity," Rice said. "They're probably going to be published, so
investors will know what kind of matters are under the purview of the
board and its committees."</TE>
<TE>   All this will take time, so he expects "more meetings and longer
meetings." Amgen's board meets six times a year, for which the
members are paid a $5,000 quarterly fee plus $1,250 for each board
meeting, as well as fees for serving on committees. Board members
also get an annual stock option grant of 16,000 shares. Since Amgen
shares are near a three-year low, this hasn't been too much of a
gift.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen shares Friday rose $1.54 to $35.46 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   With one crucial reform--the effort to make boards more
independent--Amgen already is doing well.</TE>
<TE>   A quarter of U.S. companies have boards that are not considered
independent. Before WorldCom's debacle, for instance, more than half
the directors were officers of the company or had some other direct
connection. But at Amgen only its chairman, Sharer, and former
Immunex Chief Executive Edward Fritzky have direct affiliations.</TE>
<TE>   The board is taking a more cautious stance with other reform
proposals, however. Take, for instance, splitting the roles of
chairman and chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   "If you were unhappy with the chief executive being chairman, you
might wonder how good a chief executive he is," Omenn said. He
pointed out that there are many companies where the roles were
divided and the chairman and chief came into disastrous conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's expensing stock options as they are granted, which
would have lowered Amgen's reported earnings by 17 cents a share last
year but, advocates said, would have provided a truer picture of its
financial health.</TE>
<TE>   "I still haven't made up my mind," Gluck said. "Common sense says
you have to be highly disciplined in the way you give away options.
But they've clearly proven to be highly motivational."</TE>
<TE>   And then there's officially restricting their own chief executive
to one outside board, as recommended by the National Assn. of
Corporate Directors. (Sharer now sits on two.)</TE>
<TE>   "Up to at least a couple of boards, the benefits for the chief
executive outweigh the losses," Rice said. "Yes, it takes some time
away from his company, but he's going to be better in the 95% of the
time he does spend there."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the Amgen board is in favor of reform, but only so
much.</TE>
<TE>   "The Enron and WorldCom debacles are being used as evidence that
all kinds of points of view are more credible now than they were in
the past," Sharer said. "We have to make sure we don't get swept away
in the heat of the moment."</TE>

<HD>Shift to Dollar Not a Cure-All</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Ecuador's adoption of the U.S. currency
slows rate of inflation, but there is a downside.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MANTA, Ecuador</DL>
<LD>Facing economic and political chaos two years ago, Ecuador replaced
its national currency, the sucre, with U.S. dollars. The move calmed
the country that suffered through an inflation rate of 30% a month,
was on its fourth president in three years and had even been the
scene of a brief coup attempt.</LD>
<LD>   Dollarization may have brought a much-needed stability, but it has
also produced a new problem: a widening trade deficit. That is a big
reason Ecuador is pressuring the United States to renew a law that
extends preferential trade status to Andean countries.</LD>
<LD>   Juan Carlos Calero, manager of the Isabel tuna cannery in this
Pacific port city, understands the double-edged nature--the benefits
and the drawbacks--of dollarization. His tuna sales have softened,
partly because dollarization makes him less competitive on global
markets. But the proposed Andean Trade Preference Act would eliminate
U.S. duties on canned Ecuadorean tuna and giving him a bit of a
competitive boost.</LD>
<TE>   "Up to now the U.S. market has been difficult because Thailand
produces tuna more cheaply than we do and U.S. consumers don't
differentiate high quality, which is what we offer," said Calero,
whose company has Spanish-Ecuadorean joint ownership. "But if the
ATPA passes, we should be able to ship more."</TE>
<TE>   After being stalled in Congress for months, there was renewed hope
last week that an omnibus trade bill that includes ATPA will come up
for a vote before the session recesses this month.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, inflation is down to 13% and bank deposits are on the
upswing.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had two years of recovery stabilization and increased
consumption. There is no going back from dollarization. Without it we
would be in shambles," said Raul Gangotena, a former government
minister and now executive director of the Quito Chamber of Commerce,
the most powerful business group in Ecuador.</TE>
<TE>   But there is a downside to dollarization: Ecuador's growing trade
deficit has some economists worrying that the scenario that played
out in Argentina before its meltdown earlier this year could be
repeated here.</TE>
<TE>   With dollars in their pockets, Ecuadoreans are on a spending
spree, snapping up imports that have never been so affordable.
Meanwhile, the stronger currency has made its exports more expensive
on global markets and less competitive. Tourism, which also generates
foreign exchange, has been hurt by weakened currencies or
devaluations in competing destinations such as Brazil and Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   "Tourists aren't coming now. It's cheaper in other places," said
Milton Ledesma, who operates a fleet of tourist buses.</TE>
<TE>   Maria de la Paz Vela, an economist at Multiplica researchers in
Quito, said Ecuador's balance of trade has dramatically worsened this
year, with exports declining 13% over the first four months while
imports were up 29%, creating a half-billion-dollar trade deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Trade deficits are dangerous because countries have to borrow to
finance them and Ecuador, as a poor credit risk, must pay high
interest rates on such loans.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an unsustainable situation and getting worse. We are
moving toward Argentina," Vela said. Rising deficits in Argentina
ultimately caused a crisis of confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Some in the government say the country's red ink in trade will
soon be lessened by a new 250-mile pipeline from Ecuador's rich oil
fields in the Amazon basin to Pacific ports. Due for completion in
mid-2003, the pipeline could double Ecuador's oil exports, which now
are maxed out at about 450,000 barrels of crude a day.</TE>
<TE>   But oil producers are said to be much less eager to spend the
capital to produce the oil to fill the pipeline since the government,
slapped a value added tax that will cost the companies some $250
million for the 17-month period ending this December. The government
imposed the tax because it was faced with a revenue shortfall that
would have put it at odds with International Monetary Fund targets.</TE>
<TE>   "We are reviewing our investment options very carefully," said an
executive with one U.S. oil firm in the capital of Quito.</TE>
<TE>   The uncertainty over oil is one reason top Ecuadorean officials
are eager for the U.S. Congress to renew the Andean Trade Preference
Act, which lapsed in May after more than 10 years in effect.
President Bush is a strong proponent of a renewal and expansion of
the bill to include duty-free status on products, including
Ecuadorean tuna.</TE>
<TE>   The original law was enacted in 1991 to give incentives to farmers
in Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia and Colombia to not produce or process the
raw materials of cocaine. It led to the birth of entire export
industries in Ecuador, including a $250-million flowers market, said
Heinz Moeller, Ecuador's foreign minister, in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that industry is suffering and that's too bad. Drug

<HD>FCC Official in Media Hot Seat</HD>
<DH>Profile: W. Kenneth Ferree, who will play key role in
shaping Internet and TV, built his career on nonconformity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The man who is helping to shape the future of television rarely
watches it.</LD>
<LD>   His decisions on high-speed Internet access will affect millions,
but he'd rather play classical piano than surf the Web and he has
never downloaded a tune.</LD>
<LD>   He's a top media industry watchdog but by no means a news junkie,
only scanning Washington newspapers and skipping CNN most days.</LD>
<TE>   Despite such seeming contradictions, W. Kenneth Ferree--chief of
the Federal Communications Commission's media bureau--could have more
to say about how Americans are entertained and informed in the coming
years than just about any other government official aside from his
boss, FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell.</TE>
<TE>   As head of the media bureau, Ferree's responsibilities include
overseeing the roll-out across the U.S. of high-speed Internet
service and digital television, the reshaping of media-ownership
rules that could spur more mergers among cable, broadcast and
newspaper companies, and the approval or rejection of giant media
deals, such as the proposed mergers between Comcast Corp. and AT&amp;T
Broadband and between EchoStar Communications Corp. and Hughes
Electronics Corp., which owns DirecTV.</TE>
<TE>   "He's like the fifth FCC commissioner," quipped one industry
official. Ferree, 41, dismisses such characterizations. "I'm just a
worker bee," he insisted.</TE>
<TE>   But Powell confirmed that Ferree--whom he met while they were both
students at Georgetown University law school in the early 1990s--has
become a powerful voice at the agency. "He's going to have a huge
stamp on some things that are on the way," the chairman said.</TE>
<TE>   By next year Powell has promised to release a sweeping review of
decades-old media rules, ranging from national limits on TV and cable
ownership to rules that prevent a company from owning newspaper and
broadcast TV outlets in the same city. (Tribune Co., owner of the Los
Angeles Times, is pushing to eliminate those rules.)</TE>
<TE>   Ferree declined to comment on issues pending before the
commission. But his past comments and writings indicate he shares
Powell's faith in free markets, deregulation and competition.</TE>
<TE>   He favors a hands-off approach to the Internet and is no fan of
cable-rate regulation. Before taking his post, Ferree suggested that
the FCC should eventually abandon oversight of cable, as satellite TV
and other alternative technologies provide greater competition. Such
views probably will weigh heavily on his decision--expected later
this year--on a rule prohibiting a cable company from reaching more
than 30% of the national pay-TV audience. A federal appeals court has
thrown out that cap.</TE>
<TE>   Another key issue for the FCC is whether media consolidation
reduces the diversity of programming on TV, but Ferree--who recently
started forcing himself to watch more TV--said he has been astounded
by the amount and variety of programming.</TE>
<TE>   "I never paid attention to cable until I got this job," he said.
"There's more good stuff out there than I thought there was. What I
remember of TV is 'Three's Company' and 'Hogan's Heroes.' "</TE>
<TE>   Forecasting what Ferree will decide, however, is risky. He has
built a career on nonconformity and unpredictability.</TE>
<TE>   A former football lineman at Dartmouth College who never made
academics a top priority, he surprised himself by acing law school
and graduating near the top of his class.</TE>
<TE>   He married an undercover police officer and is eager to be seen as
a tough enforcer, but Ferree once rushed to help the American Civil
Liberties Union free a Virginia motorist arrested for interfering
with a roadside sobriety checkpoint.</TE>
<TE>   He's a hulking, 6-foot-6 figure who hunts, shoots, flies airplanes
and rides a motorcycle to work every day, but he also dabbles in
poetry (he sometimes writes his e-mails in verse) and has been known
to sneak off during lunch to visit his kids.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a little Baby Huey sometimes," Powell said in an interview.
"Ken definitely has these eccentricities, which I think he enjoys
very much."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, Powell enjoys them too. When the son of Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell was named FCC chairman in early 2001, Ferree
was his first major appointment.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Ferree was a relatively unknown telecommunications
attorney, representing cable and satellite interests at a boutique
Washington law firm. But Ferree has quickly won over many in the
industry with his no-nonsense style and charisma.</TE>
<TE>   "He tells you what he's actually thinking," said Walt Disney Co.
lobbyist Preston Padden. "He's not in anybody's pocket."</TE>
<TE>   Ferree's law school ties with Powell have provided him with an
extra aura of power.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are interacting with Ken, you know he has the support of
the chairman," said Robert Sachs, head of the National Cable &amp;
Telecommunications Assn. "If Ken were to make a contrary
recommendation, it would be a high hurdle to overcome."</TE>
<TE>   At the stuffy government agency, Ferree has made a splash. He
favors wearing loud Jerry Garcia and Mickey Mouse ties, a habit he
picked up while working as a salesman and looking for ways to
distinguish himself.</TE>
<TE>   At the FCC's annual fund-raising fashion show, Ferree showed up in
full motorcycle leathers, which he sometimes dons for his daily
commute.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a free spirit," said attorney Henry Goldberg, his former
boss at Goldberg, Godles, Wiener &amp; Wright, who frequently had to
needle Ferree to change into a business suit before clients arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Impatient and intolerant of anything he considers to be "spin,"
Ferree frequently cuts off conversations with a curt "Get to the
point." On occasion, he has stormed out of meetings with industry
lobbyists.</TE>
<TE>   But he clearly encourages and relishes his reputation as the FCC's
"bad cop," a term he uses to describe himself.</TE>
<TE>   Role as Enforcer</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Powell unveiled a plan to encourage cable, broadcast and
electronics industries to roll out digital TV. Though the chairman
calls the plan "voluntary," Ferree left little doubt that he expected
the industries to adopt it, referring to himself as "the stick."</TE>
<TE>   It's a role reminiscent of his high school days, he said, when his
basketball coach sent the imposing young athlete onto the court to
"basically foul the other team and rough them up.... I was the
enforcer."</TE>
<TE>   But two FCC commissioners recently took a slap at Ferree's
tough-guy image, saying he was too soft in one of his first major
decisions involving satellite giant EchoStar.</TE>
<TE>   Ferree's bureau determined this spring that EchoStar's
controversial practice of requiring customers to install two dishes
to receive all local TV channels was a form of price discrimination
requiring consumers to spend their time waiting for a new dish to be
installed.</TE>
<TE>   FCC Commissioners Kevin Martin, a Republican, and Michael Copps, a
Democrat, criticized Ferree for allowing EchoStar to continue the
two-dish plan merely by providing better notice to customers.</TE>
<TE>   "Such a 'remedy' effectively eviscerates the finding that
EchoStar's current policy is unlawful," the commissioners wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling is under review. Ferree said he went as far as the law
permitted.</TE>
<TE>   Ferree hasn't lost any support from Powell.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very blunt, which I like," said Powell, who said he often
enjoys watching Ferree dress down lobbyists. "It can be brutal. He
picks [their argument] apart and throws the pieces back in their lap.
And they sit there not knowing what to say next."</TE>
<TE>   Despite an obvious mutual affinity, Powell and Ferree insist their
closeness has been exaggerated. Though they both attended Georgetown,
Ferree was a year ahead of Powell. They both clerked for federal
Judge Harry Edwards in Washington, though during different years.
Until they met through a mutual friend years after graduation, the
pair had barely spoken. Even now, though they speak frequently at
work, they rarely see each other outside of the office, and their
families don't socialize.</TE>
<TE>   Some call them intellectual soul mates. Because of their similar
interests, Powell and Ferree acknowledge they have a tendency to get
sidetracked into long-winded debates about law and policy.</TE>
<TE>   Career Sea Change</TE>
<TE>   A native of St. Louis, Ferree grew up in a middle-class family in
Northern California. After graduating from Dartmouth College, he
married his college sweetheart and tried his hand at importing
Mexican clothing. When that failed, he earned an MBA from San Jose
State University and then worked as a salesman.</TE>
<TE>   His interest in law began by accident. After his first wife got
into a car accident, Ferree noticed that her attorney in the case
"seemed to be helping people and drove a nice car, a Jag."</TE>
<TE>   He found he had a knack for law. He got straight A's during his
first year and graduated "second or third" in his class. During that
time, he divorced and met Laura, a former police officer who was
getting her law degree. Married in 1993, the couple live in Vienna,
Va., with their two children.</TE>
<TE>   As a law clerk for Edwards, Ferree became known as "the Lawnmower"
for his ability to plow through research like a machine and still
leave each night by 6 p.m. to get home to his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very tenacious on big projects that required a huge amount
of work," said Edwards, who officiated at Ferree's Quaker-style
wedding.</TE>
<TE>   It was during his stint with Edwards, an appellate judge who hears
many FCC-related cases, that Ferree got his first taste of
telecommunications law.</TE>
<TE>   A Republican, Ferree said he also has a strong libertarian bent.
In his first year as a lawyer, Ferree volunteered to defend a
Virginia motorist who was so outraged after encountering a roadside
sobriety checkpoint that he turned his car around and hung a crude
sign warning oncoming drivers. A police officer arrested the man for
alleged obstruction of justice.</TE>
<TE>   Ferree took the case for free.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think sobriety checkpoints are unconstitutional," Ferree
said. "Unfortunately, the Supreme Court doesn't agree with me."</TE>
<TE>   But Ferree won this particular case on constitutional grounds,
likening the motorist to a modern-day Paul Revere.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pure 1st Amendment. It was people telling each other what
their government was doing."</TE>
<TE>   The issues Ferree faces at the FCC are more complicated. But he
still vows to search for what he believes is the right answer, even
if the outcome is unpopular.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things I like about public service is you try to get
to the right answers and not necessarily advocate the particular
client's viewpoint," Ferree said.</TE>

<HD>A Grown-Up Barbie for Older Girls</HD>
<DH>Toys: Looking to draw 9- to 12-year-olds, Mattel will offer
product lines aimed at specific age groups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even as Mattel Inc. posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings
last week, the El Segundo-based toy maker conceded yet another
disappointing quarter for the aging Barbie brand, Mattel's biggest
product line with more than $1.5 billion in annual sales.</LD>
<LD>   This time, however, the company is quietly readying its boldest
efforts yet to help bring Barbie out of her slump.</LD>
<LD>   During a conference call last week with investors, Chief Executive
Robert Eckert mentioned My Scene as one of the product lines the
company hopes will lead it to a more positive second half of the
year.</LD>
<TE>   It was a public statement about a line the company has been
hesitant to discuss: a new group of teenage Barbies that Mattel is
setting apart from the rest of the Barbie line to try to recapture 9-
to 12-year-old girls, most of whom have long since tossed Barbie to
their little sisters.</TE>
<TE>   My Scene dolls, which Mattel said will be out in time for the
holiday season, sport trendier fashions, more modern-looking facial
features and an un-Barbie-like color scheme--think burgundy rather
than bubble gum pink--on everything from packaging to makeup.</TE>
<TE>   But grabbing an older girl's attention is a tough game, toy
industry experts said, and Mattel may be unable to win. Girls who
years ago played with Barbie dolls have moved on to music, computers
and other sophisticated playthings and may never return to Barbie's
world.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the biggest challenges facing the toy industry: How
do we continue to attract the 8- to 12-year-old girl?" said Michael
Glazer, chief executive of KB Toys Inc., a chain of 1,400 stores
across the country. "We don't have a problem attracting the boys
because you have action figures and then you have video games. The
tough one is the girl who at 8 years old says, 'I wouldn't be caught
dead with a Barbie.' What do we have in our stores that keeps her
coming in?"</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, girls as old as 12 played with Barbie and the doll's
friends, cars, homes and other accessories. But as 12-year-olds grew
more sophisticated, the dolls quickly moved down the age range,
settling to today's target Barbie audience of 3- to 5-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   That makes Mattel's task of trying to retain the attention of
older girls nearly impossible, because even 6- and 7-year-old girls
now think of the doll as babyish.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is a market for these types of products with girls
who aren't necessarily out of the toy phase of their lives," said
Chris Cox, an analyst with Goldman Sachs in New York. "But it's
tough. There are a lot of other influences competing for girls of
that age."</TE>
<TE>   Mattel's plan is to offer highly differentiated Barbie doll lines
for different-aged girls, analysts said. For the 5- to 7-year-old
girl, Mattel said it plans next year to introduce "Happy Family," a
line designed to appeal to that age group's desire for nurturing
play.</TE>
<TE>   Featuring a pregnant Midge, one of Barbie's longtime friends who
years ago married Allen, the doll line will have accessories such as
the baby, a crib and swing--and a magnetic extended stomach, so that
Midge can be "unpregnant" when the baby arrives.</TE>
<TE>   My Scene is targeted at the next age group up. Working models of
the dolls come in very un-Barbie-like packaging with muted tones and
downplayed references to the Barbie line. And rather than Barbie's
more wholesome fare, the Scene dolls wear the kind of edgy fashions
that many preteens would like to wear: furry jackets, platform shoes,
belly chains and imitation leather pants.</TE>
<TE>   The message is, one analyst said, that this is not your little
sister's Barbie.</TE>
<TE>   Although analysts said it's the company's best effort yet at
wooing an older audience, some added that it could be a reach.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be hard-pressed to see a 10-year-old girl playing with
Barbie," said Brian McGough, an analyst with Morgan Stanley in New
York. "By shooting that high, though, they might be able to get a 7-
or 8-year-old."</TE>
<TE>   Mattel has been able to retain some of the older girls with new
products such as the singing Diva Starz dolls, the more expensive,
historical American Girl doll line and the write-on-wipe-off What's
Her Face group of figures. But most can't make up for sales declines
in the incredibly lucrative Barbie line, which at 43 years old is an
almost pure profit center for its parent company.</TE>
<TE>   "They've done a great job of segmenting the line to compensate for
Barbie's weakness," said Jill Krutick, an analyst with Salomon Smith
Barney in New York. "But Barbie needs to see a recovery to compensate
for weakness that will inevitably occur in other parts of the line."</TE>
<TE>   That's left Mattel, under girls division President Adrienne
Fontanella, scrambling to find new relevancy for the Barbie brand,
including new licensed clothing and accessories.</TE>
<TE>   Mattel has made some attempts in recent years to preach the Barbie
gospel to older girls. Those efforts included Jewel Girl, with
stick-on faux gems for the girl and the doll; Generation Girl, with
an older look and cooler accessories, and this year's Mystery Squad,
which includes spy-like tools for Barbie and her friends as well as a
mystery--an older concept--for girls to act out and solve.</TE>
<TE>   But while some of the earlier dolls sold well, the older age group
has remained mostly out of reach.</TE>
<TE>   In the quarter ended June 30, sales for the $2.2-billion girls
division--Mattel's biggest--were flat worldwide, with newer Mattel
products such as American Girl and Polly Pockets dolls making up for
a much steeper slump in the Barbie brand.</TE>
<TE>   Domestically, Barbie declined 17% for the quarter, with global
sales off by 10%, contributing to a companywide sales decline of 4%
for the first half of the year. A large part of the slower sales,
Mattel said, was due to a change in the shipping schedule, which will
shift some product sales into the second half of the year. Also
hurting the brand was a steep decline in the collector's market,
which the company is trying to combat by shipping fewer--and
higher-quality--Holiday Barbie dolls.</TE>
<TE>   But those numbers come on top of a tough year for Barbie, with
sales in 2001 down 3% worldwide to $1.55 billion. The doll's domestic
popularity fell even further, with sales down 12% from the previous
year, well off Barbie's 1997 peak of $1.8 billion. "We hear at Toy
Fair every year from all the manufacturers that something is perfect
for the 8-to-12-year-old girl," said KB Toy's Glazer. "And there
hasn't been a lot of success."</TE>

<HD>Dockworkers' Talks Break Off</HD>
<DH>Labor: Union and shipping lines emerge pointing fingers
after both sides offer plans on coping with technology.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Negotiations over a new West Coast dockworkers contract broke off
late Sunday with longshore workers and shipping lines accusing each
other of ignoring good-faith offers and ruining what had appeared to
be a hopeful exchange of proposals.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at both the Pacific Maritime Assn. and the International
Longshore and Warehouse Union have been publicly upbeat about
negotiations--even as they conceded there was little progress since
their contract officially expired July 1.</LD>
<LD>   Talks over the weekend, they said, would foreshadow either a quick
conclusion or a protracted dispute over a deal that governs about
$260 billion worth of goods that move through 29 major ports from San
Diego to Seattle.</LD>
<TE>   Last week the union offered what it cast as a fair and reasonable
proposal to solve the tangled problem of introducing more-efficient
technology to the waterfront without making too many jobs obsolete.
Shipping lines countered Sunday afternoon, and the two sides emerged
pointing fingers.</TE>
<TE>   "They seem to almost reject my proposal out of hand, and it's a
bitter disappointment to me," Joseph Miniace, the association's chief
executive, said after Sunday's negotiations. "This was a melding of
both proposals and we've come a great distance since negotiations
began."</TE>
<TE>   A union spokesman responded that the association had hardly budged
from a preliminary offer of months ago--and that was galling because
the union had offered to accept job cuts for job security as
computers do more work on the docks.</TE>
<TE>   "We offered him everything he asked for. He gave us nothing. Zero,
zip, zilch," said Steve Stallone, a spokesman for the union which
represents 10,500 dockworkers. "It's a major disappointment, and it
shows that he's not really trying to negotiate."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides did approve another 24-hour contract extension, as they
have done since July 1. Union negotiators also will present the
association's latest proposal at a meeting of delegates from local
chapters that convenes this week in San Francisco, where the
negotiations are taking place.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't call it a breakdown yet," Miniace said. "I consider it
a significant event, but I wouldn't say it's a breakdown."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides have promised harmony on the docks. The union
downplayed initial murmurs of a strike, and shipping lines say they
won't lock out workers unless they determine there has been an
organized slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   With Pacific Rim trade projected to double in the next decade,
shipping lines complain that West Coast ports won't be able to keep
up unless they catch up with their more automated Asian peers.</TE>
<TE>   That made technology the focus of this contract.</TE>
<TE>   Early last week, the union pitched a proposal that Stallone said
would cost about 600 of the 2,100 longshore clerk jobs. The trade-off
was that the union would control new jobs generated from increased
efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   The association responded guardedly, saying the proposal wouldn't
cut costs at all. On Sunday, Miniace reiterated his promise that no
current longshore clerk would lose his job.</TE>
<TE>   "When you guarantee somebody that I am going to protect your job
as I modernize, that is a tremendous offer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He also said his proposal would give longshore workers a 17%
increase in compensation--wages, health benefits and pension--over
five years. He said the union had asked for a 57% increase in those
costs over three years. Overall, he said, the cost of the contract
would rise about $200 million to $1.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The union's response to the association's offer is expected to
emerge soon.</TE>
<TE>   About 80 rank-and-file longshore workers from along the coast are
set to meet this week in San Francisco. During negotiations in 1999,
that caucus offered a chance to debate a draft contract. This year,
it could become a forum for the union to brace for battle.</TE>
<TE>   Already, the union has scheduled a Wednesday demonstration outside
the association's San Francisco headquarters.</TE>

<LD>Arthur Andersen Business Consulting, the German consulting business
of Arthur Andersen, is merging with Deloitte Consulting, the German
unit of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu's management consulting business,
the German business newspaper Handelsblatt said, without citing a
source.</LD>
<LD>   A letter of intent has been signed, and the companies plan to make
the merger public next week, Handelsblatt said. The merger would
allow Andersen's German consulting unit to regain access to an
international network of consultants and let it scrap the Andersen
name, discredited through the company's role in the collapse of Enron
Corp., Handelsblatt said. Last week, Deloitte renamed its management
consulting arm Braxton.</LD>

<LD>Efforts by Congress and the Bush administration to ban corporate
loans could take away a tool frequently used by Silicon Valley
companies to attract top talent to one of the nation's most expensive
places to live.</LD>
<LD>   Half of the region's 150 largest companies have lent tens of
millions of dollars to top bosses to help them buy homes and stock,
according to the San Jose Mercury News' examination of compensation
packages disclosed in the latest proxy statements filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Corporate loans often are tailored at favorable terms unavailable
at banks or brokerages. Companies commonly charge no interest, ease
terms of the loans or simply forgive them; 40% of valley companies
that made loans later forgave them at least in part.</LD>
<TE>   The report indicates that Silicon Valley companies made most loans
for three reasons: for home buying (40% of the lending companies),
for the purchase of company stock (17%) and for tax bills (10%).</TE>

<LD>IBM Corp., taking aim at rival database giant Oracle Corp., plans to
unveil today a new version of its DB2 database software that it says
will make it easier for companies to manage large amounts of
information.</LD>
<LD>   IBM has been trying to beef up its software offerings in recent
years, as software products often sell at higher margins than its
hardware products, which are increasingly approaching commodity
status.</LD>
<LD>   Offering software along with IBM computers enables Big Blue to
sell customers entire systems. IBM Senior Vice President Steven
Mills, who is in charge of the Armonk, N.Y., company's $13-billion
software business, said IBM is not content with the gains it has made
against Oracle in the market for large, complex database systems.</LD>
<TE>   Oracle and IBM have been at loggerheads over databases for years,
since IBM decided in the 1990s that Oracle's market was one it wanted
to own.</TE>

<HD>U.K.'s 10 Top-Paid CEOs Earn $128 Million Total</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Britain's 10 highest-paid chief executives earned a combined $128
million in the latest financial year, according to a survey of pay
among FTSE-100 index companies. Jean-Pierre Garnier, head of
GlaxoSmithKline, earned the most--$31.95 million in base pay, bonus,
shares and options--followed by Chris Gent of Vodafone Group, Bart
Becht of Reckitt Benckiser and John Browne of BP, the survey by
Bloomberg News showed.</LD>
<LD>   CEOs were awarded similar levels of compensation the previous
year, even as share prices plunged. Shares declined at eight of 10
companies with the best-paid executives. The FTSE-100, which measures
the biggest publicly traded U.K. companies, has declined by a third
since the beginning of 2001, wiping $808.91 billion off the value of
the index's companies.</LD>
<TE>   "There doesn't seem to be any connection between performance and
reward," said Alastair Ross Goobey, chairman of the International
Corporate Governance Network, whose members control about $10
trillion of assets. British chief executives say their remuneration
is still below that of their U.S. counterparts. Jeffrey Immelt of
General Electric Co. was awarded $85 million last year, more than
Garnier, Gent, Becht and Browne combined. The average U.S. CEO earned
$7 million, according to a survey of 350 companies by Mercer Human
Resource Consulting. That contrasts with $2.7 million in base pay,
bonus, shares and options for FTSE-100 CEOs, according to Bloomberg
calculations.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rolls-Royce, the world's second-largest civil jet engine maker, said
Sunday that it expects to increase sales in its lucrative maintenance
and spare parts business to 50% of total sales.</LD>
<LD>   "We have 40% of our sales in the aftermarket, and I guess we can
get to 50%," Chairman Ralph Robins, who will retire later this year,
said. In the battle for new engine orders in the troubled commercial
airline industry, Robins said Rolls-Royce was confident of
maintaining more than 50% market share of its latest Trent series
engine for the Airbus A380, a 555-seat super-jumbo competing with
Boeing Co.'s 747 series. Rolls-Royce slashed 5,000 jobs in October
and warned investors it faced a difficult 2002 and 2003 as aircraft
makers scaled back output in response to the financial crisis in the
airline industry caused by a slump in demand for air travel.</LD>

plane maker, undecided how to press ahead with the plan, Business
Week said. Engineers are considering two designs for the plane that
include a conventional jetliner, which is more fuel-efficient and
cheaper to build than a 767. The other design includes a flying wing
shaped like the B-2 bomber, Business Week said.</LD>
<TE>   Boeing says it can make the conventional 250-seat jet up to 30%
more efficient to operate and cheaper to buy than today's airplanes,
which would be an advantage for cash-conscious airlines.</TE>

<LD>Consolidated Edison Inc. asked New York City residents and workers to
conserve power today after a fire at a transfer station knocked out
service to the west side of Lower Manhattan. The utility is "fairly
confident" there will be no power failures, Consolidated Edison
spokeswoman Martha Liipfert said.</LD>

<HD>Lawsuit Naming Firm's Employee Must Be Justified</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: After I left the company where I served as an on-site
project manager, a subcontractor sued the company, its owners and
five employees, including me, over an unpaid bill.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, I have hired a lawyer at $265 an hour. I earned
$33.60 an hour when I was with the company.</LD>
<LD>   Working for a small company with limited assets, where employees
are asked to sign contract agreements, vendor orders, etc., doesn't
seem to be worth it if you are subjected to this kind of nightmare.</LD>
<TE>   --M.B., Laguna Niguel</TE>
<TE>   Answer: There's no doubt that employees have to be very careful to
avoid personal liability in acting for the employer.</TE>
<TE>   If the contract you signed states that you are personally
guaranteeing the debt, then technically you may be responsible.</TE>
<TE>   The same thing applies if you sign payroll checks without doing
the proper calculations for withholding.</TE>
<TE>   You might be personally responsible if the company does not
eventually pay it.</TE>
<TE>   Employers have many reasons, however, to pay for your attorney's
fees in this situation. Certainly, they have a desire to maintain you
as a "friendly" witness to protect them from liability.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, according to California law, an employer is supposed
to indemnify all expenses of the employee.</TE>
<TE>   Your situation may fall within that classification.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the employer's responsibility, you may have been
included in the lawsuit without proper justification.</TE>
<TE>   Just because you signed the contract does not mean that you are
responsible if you are signing simply as your employer's agent.</TE>
<TE>   Call the plaintiff's attorneys and make them justify your
involvement in the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   You or your attorney could threaten them with "malicious
prosecution," for which they might be liable to you for not having an
adequate reason for suing you.</TE>

<TE>   Forfeiture of Unused Personal Days at Issue</TE>
<TE>   Q: At our company, which has offices throughout the world, we are
entitled to vacation days, personal days and sick days.</TE>
<TE>   I know that accrued vacation days can't be taken away at the end
of the year, but unused sick days can be forfeited. What about
personal days?</TE>
<TE>   Our employee handbook says that California employees accrue
personal days at the rate of 0.33 for every month of employment and
that the maximum we can accrue at any time is four. It says that
personal days have to be used in the calendar year they were accrued
and that any unused personal days will be paid upon termination.</TE>
<TE>   My human resources department says that any personal days not used
during the year will be forfeited at the end of that year.</TE>
<TE>   Is that legal in California?</TE>
<TE>   --J.M., Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   A: You are correct that California law forbids "use it or lose it"
vacation policies under which employees forfeit unused vacation pay
at the end of the year. You are also correct in that sick pay
ordinarily can be legally forfeited.</TE>
<TE>   Many years ago, California's labor commissioner, who enforces this
law, declared that "personal day" benefits are subject to the same
nonforfeiture rule if the employer's policy gives employees the right
to use the personal days for any purpose they might wish. The
commissioner also said an employer can legally cap the number of
personal days that an employee can accrue and carry over from year to
year, just as an employer can cap vacation accrual.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, there are no published court decisions addressing
the forfeit of personal days. If you have lost personal days as the
result of your company's forfeiture policy, your best bet may be to
file a complaint with the labor commissioner. The commissioner would
take action against your employer if he decided that your case has
merit.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc. introduced a digital picture service that
allows customers to use their mobile phones to take pictures and
instantly send them to any e-mail address. The Redmond, Wash.-based
company said it was the first U.S. wireless operator to offer the
service, which already is available in Europe.</LD>
<LD>   To access the service, called mMode Pix, customers must attach a
miniature digital camera accessory to the bottom of a Sony Ericsson
T68i phone.</LD>
<LD>   Once the camera is attached, the phone's screen becomes the view
finder and customers can take pictures by pushing a button. The
camera can store 14 to 200 pictures, depending on picture size.</LD>
<TE>   The Sony Ericsson phone retails for $199.99 and the digital camera
accessory costs $129.99. Customers also must subscribe to an AT&amp;T
Wireless voice calling plan, as well as its mMode mobile Web service.</TE>
<TE>   MMode Pix is available for no additional cost beyond standard
mMode usage fees.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T Wireless said customers also can subscribe to a premium
service that will allow them to post their pictures to online digital
photo albums.</TE>

<HD>Motorola to Build Customized Cell Phones</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Motorola Inc. will build customized mobile phones for wireless
operators, in a new strategy to boost market share quickly as it
tries to regain its dominance in cell phones. Schaumburg, Ill.-based
Motorola signed deals with four of the top U.S. wireless
operators--Verizon Wireless, Cingular Wireless, AT&amp;T Wireless
Services Inc. and VoiceStream Wireless--to make low-end phones that
would be exclusive to each company. In Europe, Vodafone Group, which
co-owns Verizon Wireless with Verizon Communications, signed on.</LD>
<LD>   The phones, due out in September, will have the same inside parts
and be similar in size but will have different shapes, colors and
finishes to fit in with each wireless company's brand image. Motorola
said it also is customizing the software inside the phones so they
will have different games, ring tones, icons and wake-up screens.</LD>
<LD>   All of the phones will come with software to surf the Web and will
be compatible with the advanced networks capable of high-speed
Internet connections. They will have removable face plates to allow
consumers to customize them.</LD>
<TE>   By keeping the skeletal parts the same, Motorola is able to offer
the tailored c330 line of mobile phones to customers at a cost in the
$100 range.</TE>

<DH>Network: System being set up at Case Western Reserve
University runs at 1 gigabit per second.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL SINGER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>If going online with your home computer is like turning on the tap
for a glass of water, getting on the Internet this fall at Case
Western Reserve University is going to be like opening a fire
hydrant.</LD>
<LD>   In all, 16,000 computers, including machines in every dorm room,
will be capable of being linked over the coming year to a fiber-optic
network that delivers data at up to 1 gigabit per second.</LD>
<LD>   That's about a thousand times faster than the typical home
broadband connection--so fast that the research university's computer
mavens still don't know exactly what they'll do with so much
bandwidth.</LD>
<TE>   And that's the point of this $27-million investment: Case will
look to develop applications that benefit from a supercharged
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   With the new system, "You can actually do full-screen,
full-motion, high-definition video with high-definition sound," said
the school's technology chief, Lev Gonick. "That's pretty amazing
when you think about research science."</TE>
<TE>   Medical students will be able to watch surgery in real time from a
remote location yet experience it as if they were in the room.</TE>
<TE>   A musician in Cleveland could study with a teacher in, say, New
York via an Internet audiovisual conference--provided the teacher had
an equally fast connection.</TE>
<TE>   "This is clearly one of the most aggressive if not the most
aggressive deployments" of computer technology in academia, said
Steve Corbato of Internet2, a national consortium of universities
working on the next-generation Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Corbato expects such so-called gigabit Ethernet technology to be
common on university campuses within about two years.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Case has got a leg up on such premier tech universities
as Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon and Caltech, which offer only
one-tenth of the speed at 100 megabits per second.</TE>
<TE>   "Many universities are looking into gigabit networking on campus,"
said Joel Smith, chief information officer at Carnegie Mellon. "They
just proceed more rapidly or less rapidly, depending on funding and
other concerns."</TE>
<TE>   Carnegie Mellon, like Case, was one of the first universities in
the 1970s to experiment with networked computers. It has some
gigabit-speed links between buildings and is constantly upgrading,
Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   And like many campuses, Carnegie Mellon offers wireless
connectivity so students and professors can log in from anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Rare is the university that can do this all at once," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   John Dundas, Caltech's director of information technology, said
competitive pressures will force other universities to follow suit
even though the technology at first will benefit a limited pool of
graduate-level researchers.</TE>
<TE>   "Until faculty are able to integrate these kind of technological
innovations into their teaching, it's not going to have a lot of
impact on the undergrads," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Case Western, a 9,600-student university, contracted with Sprint
and Cisco Systems for the upgrade. As part of the deal, Sprint can
test new technologies at the school. In return, Case gets discounts
on future technology upgrades.</TE>
<TE>   The Case system will take about a year to complete, but it is
already operating in several dorms.</TE>

<LD>For most of us, mention of The Great Communicator brings to mind the
folksy banter of Ronald Reagan.</LD>
<LD>   Soon, however, the term could describe a new breed of gadgets that
combine a cell phone with a two-way pager and Internet-connected
personal organizer.</LD>
<LD>   For sheer charisma, two of the latest entrants in the so-called
smartphone category--Handspring's Treo 270 ($499) and Nokia's 9290
($599)--won't rival Reagan. But these devices represent a big step in
bringing a personal communicator closer to something we'd actually
want in our pocket or purse. That is, if the quality of wireless
service in the U.S. could do them justice.</LD>
<TE>   The Treo 270 is a color version of the remarkable amalgam of
features we first saw combined in the Treo 180 early this year. It is
the best marriage of telephone, Palm operating system, wireless
messaging and Web access you'll find, especially considering its
5.4-ounce, fit-in-your-shirt-pocket convenience.</TE>
<TE>   Pop open the windowed flip lid and you've got a backlit
micro-keypad under the touchscreen display. This steel gray device
brims with scroll bars and buttons that are programmed to open the
address book, calendar, e-mail and text-messaging modules.</TE>
<TE>   A stylus nestles in the Treo's case--though anyone who learns the
keyboard shortcuts won't much need it. It took this Palm OS veteran
the better part of a month to get accustomed to no stylus.</TE>
<TE>   Design wise, the Nokia 9290 represents a whole different fork in
the road. There's no stylus. Nor is the crisp color display
touch-sensitive.</TE>
<TE>   The 9290 is the first U.S. iteration of a huge seller in Europe: a
cell phone that opens on a hinge that runs the length of its 6-inch
case, converting it into a Lilliputian laptop computer.</TE>
<TE>   The 9290 runs on the surprisingly agile Open Symbian operating
system, which unlike the Palm OS was designed from the ground up for
wireless devices.</TE>
<TE>   With this Symbian OS, not only can you dial from the address book
as you can on the Treo, you can also e-mail from it. With the Treo,
e-mailing and messaging isn't integrated as well.</TE>
<TE>   But the 9290's main virtue is also its vice. Its comfortable
keyboard and wide display make it a very attractive alternative to a
notebook computer for traveling executives. But its heft (8.6 ounces)
and length do not a pocket-stuffer make. It's fine in a briefcase but
too unwieldy for a belt clip.</TE>
<TE>   Stunningly, it also can't be used outside the United States or
upgraded for higher-speed networks.</TE>
<TE>   That said, this Nokia struts some fine features.</TE>
<TE>   Comparable to any Palm OS-based device, the Nokia synchronizes
with most personal information management software for PCs including
Microsoft's Outlook and Lotus' Organizer and Notes.</TE>
<TE>   It also converts Microsoft Word and Excel files for editing and
PowerPoint files for viewing. The Symbian OS will additionally let
you view common image files, has a voice recording function and can
play video and MP3s. None of this would be possible without ample
power and memory--56 megabytes, a 32-bit ARM9 RISC processor and Java
software support.</TE>
<TE>   The Nokia can send, receive and edit faxes. It accepts e-mail
attachments, has a speakerphone for hands-free chatter and permits
you to jump among different applications while you're speaking.</TE>
<TE>   For all its virtues, I found the Treo less versatile. Its keypad
is adequate for thumb-typing short missives, while the Nokia's
keyboard can handle serious typing.</TE>
<TE>   For connecting to PCs, both devices have infrared ports. The Treo
offers both USB and serial port connectors, the Nokia only serial.</TE>
<TE>   On the strength of its operating system alone, the Nokia would be
my clear choice. Yet the phone will not work outside the U.S. even
though it operates on the GSM standard that dominates Europe and much
of Asia. That means its owners will be stuck with
14.4-kilobit-per-second data transfer just as GSM carriers
(VoiceStream, Cingular and AT&amp;T Wireless) upgrade to nationwide GPRS,
which runs at least four times as fast.</TE>
<TE>   The Treo 270, by contrast, is upgradeable to GPRS. What's more,
while Handspring is planning a Treo 270 for the other major U.S.
wireless standard, CDMA (Verizon and Sprint), there are no such plans
for the 9290.</TE>

<HD>Bidding for a Change</HD>
<DH>EBay's chief is leading an audacious move toward fixed
prices</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EBay Inc., the hugely successful auction site that made bidding on
everything from comic books to cars a national pastime, is about to
embrace non-auction sales.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning this week, sellers will be able to choose a fixed-price
option that will allow them to offer items at set prices, no bidding
allowed.</LD>
<LD>   It's a possibly perilous step into conventionality for a company
that has thrived, in no small part, because of the loyalty of its
individual sellers, who are not shy about rising up in opposition to
new policies they feel might endanger their businesses.</LD>
<TE>   This group--which includes about 150,000 who say they make selling
on EBay their full-time jobs--has been especially sensitive to the
increasing number of corporate merchants on the site.</TE>
<TE>   EBay Chief Executive Meg Whitman has been given much of the credit
for the growth of the company, which started as AuctionWeb in an
apartment in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Is the fixed-price option a move away from what made
EBay EBay?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: We have always thought of ourselves as an online
marketplace. It happens that the first format was auctions, and
auctions have a lot of benefit. There is the thrill of the hunt and
the competitive aspect of it. It also creates efficient market
pricing because it's set by the market.</TE>
<TE>   But we've had a lot of requests for a more robust, fixed-price
offering because for certain occasions--whether an anniversary or a
holiday--buyers want the immediacy and convenience of a fixed price.
And then there is a whole segment of consumers who prefer knowing
exactly how much they are going to pay.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You call it an online marketplace, but in the public's mind,
EBay means person-to-person auctions. It's what set you apart from a
lot of e-commerce sites that are no longer around or struggling.</TE>
<TE>   A: True, but today 19% of our transactions are settled in a
fixed-price format through our "Buy It Now" option on auctions. (A
seller can choose to set a Buy It Now price. If a buyer elects to pay
it, bidding stops and the auction ends.)</TE>
<TE>   Q: There was a lot of opposition to Buy It Now among your regulars
when it began. And in some cases, opposition to new ventures has been
so negative you had to later retract them.</TE>
<TE>   A: We have discussed the fixed-price format in our Voices program
that brings customers to us every quarter to get previews of new
things. And we have talked about it on the site, so I think our
customers know it's coming.</TE>
<TE>   But it is true that you never actually know what the real reaction
will be until the day something launches.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What's to prevent a large company, like Disney, that has a
major presence on your site from operating like a regular merchant
with fixed prices and forgetting about auctions entirely?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think the sellers want to maximize their volume on EBay. What
I believe will happen is the sellers will decide what items are more
appropriate for sale in a fixed-price format and what would be better
to auction. It will probably vary by time of year. When we get into a
holiday season, you may see a switch to more fixed price.</TE>
<TE>   But I think the unique and rare items will always go to auctions.
I would be surprised if we saw much movement away from that.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've tested the new format?</TE>
<TE>   A: We already rolled it out in Europe on our sites there in March.
The reaction has been very good.</TE>
<TE>   Q: In Europe, EBay does not have that same absolute association
with auctions.</TE>
<TE>   A: True in France and Italy, not true in Germany and the U.K.,
where EBay has a presence that is almost consistent with the U.S. in
that it has become part of the pop culture, part of the mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Most of your revenue is from fees and commissions paid by
sellers on the site. Now that you have a devoted base of users, do
you see advertising as an increased source of revenue?</TE>
<TE>   A: No. In terms of percentage as well as absolute dollars, that
will likely continue to decline. Even during the heyday of e-commerce
when advertising dollars were coming in, we characterized advertising
as the icing on the cake. The cake is the transaction-based revenue
model.</TE>
<TE>   Q: In your recent conference call with analysts to discuss EBay's
earnings, you early on got in the phrase "transparency of our
business model" when talking about the firm. Was that in response to
the current fear over accounting scandals?</TE>
<TE>   A: We have used that terminology for well over a year. The reason
is that from our earliest days, analysts could statistically sample
the site for the number of items on sale, the average selling price
and the percentage of items that sell. A lot of these analysts'
models are nearly as good as our own internal model because they can,
in a statistically significant way, sample the site.</TE>
<TE>   This is why we call it transparent--you can largely figure out
what the transaction revenue is going to be.</TE>
<TE>   Q: EBay is so large now; do you fear in the current atmosphere
that there might be a corner of the company where something untoward
is going on?</TE>
<TE>   A: Don't think so. I have been with this company 4 1/2 years,
starting when there were 30 employees, so I know all the people who
work in virtually all of our business units. I know the finance staff
really well. This is not something that is going to happen at EBay.</TE>

<HD>More Firms on Brink?</HD>
<DH>Telecom: WorldCom's bankruptcy filing may drag down other
troubled companies, industry observers say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS and KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc.'s mammoth bankruptcy filing Sunday could prolong the
telecommunications industry's long and painful implosion by dragging
teetering companies over the brink with it.</LD>
<LD>   More than three dozen telecom firms have already landed in
Bankruptcy Court since a crippling combination of overcapacity and
sinking demand left the industry struggling to find a way to pay its
crushing debts. Though few companies are suspected of the kind of
alleged fraud that precipitated WorldCom's downfall, swirling
investigations into questionable telecom accounting practices are
contributing to an atmosphere of doom.</LD>
<LD>   Now, with the nation's No. 2 long-distance provider seeking
protection from its creditors, some observers fear that things could
get worse before they get better.</LD>
<TE>   "WorldCom is devastating, but that doesn't mean all the trouble is
over in telecom," said Jeff Kagan, an industry consultant in Atlanta.
"The next tier of players is really unstable.... I see more
bankruptcies and more acquisitions of assets for pennies on the
dollar."</TE>
<TE>   The first tremors from WorldCom's bankruptcy will be felt by
anemic equipment companies such as Lucent Technologies Inc. and
Nortel Networks Ltd., which supplied hundreds of millions of dollars
worth of networking gear on credit for the phone giant's huge and
diverse communications network.</TE>
<TE>   Now the equipment makers are near the top of WorldCom's lengthy
list of creditors, owed substantial sums of money that will never be
paid. They have already taken some write-downs on vendor financing
they no longer expect to recoup from smaller carriers, but they have
yet to make significant allowances for WorldCom. On top of that,
having one of their biggest customers in bankruptcy means their
prospects for making new sales are bleaker than ever.</TE>
<TE>   Though they may not be in immediate danger of following WorldCom
into bankruptcy, the gear makers' own chances for a long-awaited
financial recovery just got much worse, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The industry's remaining carriers, whose backbone networks
transmit voice calls, faxes, e-mail messages and other data around
the country, will also be hurt by WorldCom's descent.</TE>
<TE>   Spooked lenders and bondholders could force debt-laden
upstarts--an ever-shrinking club of companies--into bankruptcy by
demanding instant repayment if they default on just one of their
myriad loans.</TE>
<TE>   Giant rivals such as AT&amp;T Corp. and Sprint Corp. also could suffer
if they find themselves competing against an increasingly cutthroat
WorldCom that is desperate to keep customers. Already, WorldCom has
eased the terms of its existing contracts to make them more flexible
and generous. The situation will be exacerbated if WorldCom emerges
from bankruptcy with much of its debt washed away.</TE>
<TE>   Even phone companies overseas such as Deutsche Telekom of Germany
and France Telecom are likely to be touched by the financial
tentacles of WorldCom's historic bankruptcy filing, since it so
profoundly undermines the overall health of the industry.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a terrible mess, but it's probably the inevitable result of
the previous excesses," said Cliff Higgerson, general partner at
CommVentures, a venture capital firm focused on the
telecommunications industry.</TE>
<TE>   The company that bears the most striking resemblance to WorldCom
these days is Qwest Communications International Inc., the
fast-growing network operator that owns former Baby Bell U.S. West.
The Denver company's strength in local phone service has been
overshadowed by more than $21.4 billion in long-term debt and heavy
losses from its lagging long-distance operations.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent months, Qwest's financial troubles have been
overshadowed by questions about its accounting practices. The company
is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the Department of Justice for a variety of allegations involving
misleading bookkeeping.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts dismiss the notion that Qwest could fall into
bankruptcy, given its standing as the local phone provider in
Washington, Oregon, Utah, Arizona and 10 other states. But others are
not so sure, given the rapid-fire events at WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   "I think realistically you have to look at Qwest, with two SEC
investigations and the Department of Justice looking at them," said
Lisa Pierce, an analyst with Giga Information Group.</TE>
<TE>   The most vulnerable telecom firms, industry analysts say, are the
smaller network operators that loaded up on debt to lay their
fiber-optic cables and now don't have enough customers to fill their
costly pipes. Several of them have already filed for bankruptcy
protection, including Global Crossing Ltd., Williams Communications
Group Inc. and 360Networks Inc.</TE>
<TE>   They could be joined by firms such as Level 3 Communications Inc.,
Broadwing Inc. and the communications unit of Dynegy Inc., according
to Higgerson and others.</TE>
<TE>   "They are the big question mark because they just don't have the
revenues," Kagan said.</TE>
<TE>   That will change only when more businesses and consumers have
access to lucrative high-speed broadband connections. Kagan estimates
the demand for broadband services will have to multiply by at least a
factor of four. "The problem is, they can't hold their breath that
long," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Level 3 Communications got some breathing room earlier this month
with a $500-million investment from billionaire investor Warren
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and two other firms. But the
company still has more than $9 billion in debt, while some of its
competitors are poised to emerge from bankruptcy virtually debt-free.</TE>
<TE>   That means Level 3's biggest challenge will be to survive as a
low-cost provider despite cratering prices and stiff competition from
bigger players and newly restructured firms with far less debt,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "If Level 3 has to figure out how to pay back billions in debt and
Williams comes out of bankruptcy with little or no debt, Williams
will have a considerable cost advantage," Higgerson said.</TE>
<TE>   Though analysts have speculated about a Level 3 bankruptcy for
several months, company executives have insisted Level 3 has no
liquidity problems and no plans to file for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy Global Communications, a subsidiary of the troubled energy
trader, also seems to lack staying power, analysts said. Its losses
are mounting, its network is not attracting customers and its parent
company can ill afford the distraction and drag on earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Broadwing has strong income from its Cincinnati Bell local phone
business, but its financial stability has been undermined by its 1999
merger with IXC Communications Inc., an ailing long-distance and data
service provider. The company rejects concerns about its liquidity,
but its stock has plummeted 92% from its peak in October 2000 and
losses in its broadband unit have contributed to a debt load of
nearly $2.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Broadwing Chief Executive Rick Ellenberger has criticized Wall
Street analysts' ability to assess his company's financial risks and
says the company continues to have strong growth prospects.</TE>
<TE>   Many upstart local phone companies, already fighting an uphill
battle against the entrenched Baby Bells, will now find it tougher to
enlist skeptical customers and raise needed capital from a reticent
market. Companies such as Allegiance Telecom Inc. are already
financially strapped, and they also could be further strained by a
new crop of post-bankruptcy debt-free rivals.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's collapse will be felt as far away as Europe, where the
biggest names in telecommunications bet billions on advanced wireless
phone services that have yet to take hold with customers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing the same kind of shakeout over there," Kagan said.
"It doesn't stop at the borders."</TE>
<TE>   Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and others are struggling to
contain a near-revolt among shareholders. But they have something
crippled U.S. firms don't have: government backing.</TE>
<TE>   "The government still has ownership in those companies, so no
matter what, the government won't let them fail," Kagan said.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of this country's troubled telecom firms will stagger into
bankruptcy either. Some will benefit from pragmatic creditors and
bondholders willing to ease their burden to prevent larger losses in
bankruptcy. Other companies will be sold at fire-sale prices or shut
down altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "The silver lining is that the industry is not going to recover
until there is a restructuring," said Higgerson of CommVentures. "And
the sooner we get on with it, the sooner it will be finished."</TE>

<LD>In his public spanking of Wall Street, President Bush bemoaned the
"high-profile acts of deception" that have made "the business pages
of American newspapers ... read like a scandal sheet."</LD>
<LD>   In response, he unleashed a barrage of proposals--including a
financial crimes SWAT team, doubling the maximum prison terms for
financial fraud, freezing improper payments to corporate execs and a
10-point accountability plan for American business. Perfectly
appropriate and long overdue, but why stop there?</LD>
<LD>   It's all well and good to make corrupt executives pay steeper
fines and languish a little longer under mansion arrest or to bar
them from future jobs where they may again succumb to their penchant
for investor abuse. We'll keep the streets clean of malefacting
moguls and accounting acrobats--and hip, hip, hooray for all that.
But why not go a step further? Why not ask these self-servers to
serve not just time but also the country whose system they have taken
advantage of and their fellow citizens whom they have cheated and
defrauded?</LD>
<TE>   Kennedy had his Peace Corps; Clinton his AmeriCorps; Bush Sr. his
"thousand points of light"; and President George W. his USA Freedom
Corps. And while it's wonderful to ask law-abiding citizens to
volunteer, it's the lawbreakers who have the biggest debt to society
to repay.</TE>
<TE>   Let's call it CriminalCorps. Its slogan: From the Greedy to the
Needy.</TE>
<TE>   In New York City alone last year, about 65,000 ordinary offenders
were sentenced to community service: cleaning up graffiti, picking up
trash or planting bulbs in Central Park. Why shouldn't upper-crust
crooks be asked to make themselves useful as well?</TE>
<TE>   Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill says chief embezzlement officers
ought to be "strung up from the highest tree." Lynching rich
reprobates may placate restive voters concerned about cozy ties
between big business and the GOP, but rather than making swindlers
swing from trees, why not make them plant, prune and water them
instead?</TE>
<TE>   After all, this is a time of national crisis, when every citizen
has been called upon to do his or her part in protecting our
homeland. The fact that so many of these alleged abuses occurred in a
post-Sept. 11 landscape of national sacrifice and fiscal need makes
their offenses even more galling and the perpetrators' obligation to
make amends all the more apropos.</TE>
<TE>   Consider, for example, those ego-driven art collectors (and former
Tyco CEO Dennis Kozlowski will certainly prove not to be the only, or
even biggest, one) avoiding millions in sales taxes at a time when
New York never needed its revenues more. These Mr. Bigs collected not
just art but honors and accolades for their public displays of cheap
civic concern. So let's give these "patrons" a chance to truly
demonstrate their repentance and compassion by rolling up their
Saville Row sleeves and serving the hard-working taxpayers they have
hitherto bilked and bamboozled.</TE>
<TE>   Ten months ago, Bush rallied the nation to the war against
terrorism, asking all Americans to assume "new responsibilities." Why
not begin with those who have so flagrantly shirked them?</TE>
<TE>   After all, we are talking about individuals who--ethically
challenged though they might be--are for the most part extremely
talented and creative. Let's ask them to put some of that energy and
industriousness into the task of coming up with domestic and
international solutions to homeland security, or supporting our
servicemen and women overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Let's ask ImClone's Sam Waksal to put his biotech know-how to work
in coming up with bioterrorism vaccines. Let's ask Enron's Ken Lay to
work with petroleum engineers to develop new energy resources to
reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Let's ask WorldCom's Bernie
Ebbers to work with the Federal Communications Commission to fortify
our national communication network against terrorist attacks. Let's
ask Adelphia's John Rigas to work with the USO to organize
entertainment for our troops overseas.</TE>
<TE>   The aim is not to humiliate--or even rehabilitate--corporate
scoundrels, but if in rendering useful service they reform their
formerly rapacious ways, so much the better.</TE>
<TE>   Any journey to transformation, any 12-step program, requires
individuals not just to repent but to actually make amends. In so
doing, perhaps these former Masters of the Universe will recognize
that they are its servants and stewards as well.</TE>

<HD>Greater Clinical Trial Participation Is Crucial to Fight
Cancer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHERRY LANSING and NORMAN SCHWARZKOPF</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly 1.3 million fathers, mothers, sisters and friends are
diagnosed with cancer each year in the United States. In recognition
of this staggering statistic, the federal government has committed
unprecedented resources to finding a cure--more researchers, more
dollars and more opportunities for a breakthrough.</LD>
<LD>   Yet potential new therapies cannot be prescribed until researchers
have conducted extensive clinical trials. This necessary step is
being threatened because too few cancer patients--just 3%, according
to the National Cancer Institute--are participating in trials for
which they may be eligible. When research is halted, everyone
suffers.</LD>
<LD>   A recent UC Davis Cancer Center study found that such low rates of
participation can often prolong the period of trials, delay analysis
or even lead to the premature end of studies. UC Davis researchers
found that the barriers that kept patients from participating in
clinical trials include insufficient resources or coverage, health
insurance restrictions, confusion about the difference between
research and medical care, uncertainty about clinical trial
procedures and misunderstanding about the severity of their own
illness.</LD>
<TE>   The recent approval of the drug Gleevec is an example of how
vitally important clinical trials are to finding a cure. Developed by
the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis, Gleevec was originally
developed to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia. But the Boston-based
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute believed it could be used to treat a
gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Now, just two years after clinical
trials began in July 2000, the federal Food and Drug Administration
has approved Gleevec for use in treating these gastrointestinal
tumors--a cancer that until recently had few treatments.</TE>
<TE>   Gleevec, and other newly introduced cancer drugs, need not belong
to some exclusive club. Indeed, it is critical that we take steps now
to ensure that early clinical trials become a populist movement in
the cancer world. Such a movement is within our grasp if we follow
principles that have supported breakthrough scientific research in
other areas of medicine.</TE>
<TE>   We must better educate our physician and patient population
through lay and professional literature, the mainstream and specialty
media and the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   We must push for the innovative harnessing of capital. New
therapies can come to market only after lengthy and difficult testing
programs, of which early clinical trials are a cornerstone. We must
seek new ways to make private-public partnerships a reality,
extending the reach of researchers to every cancer center in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   We must work with insurance companies, HMOs and other health-care
providers to make certain that no patient is refused access to early
clinical trials for fear that coverage will be withheld.</TE>
<TE>   Effective clinical trials can find effective treatments for
cancer, treatments that do not now exist and whose nonexistence costs
hundreds of billions of dollars to insurance providers, the
health-care establishment and the U.S. economy. Rep. Deborah Pryce
(R-Ohio) has already begun work in this critical area by introducing
a bill that would require insurance providers to continue covering
patients who participate in approved trials.</TE>
<TE>   Real hope is at hand. The vast majority of researchers, research
institutions and sponsoring organizations recognize that a clinical
trial is not simply an experiment and an opportunity to gather
information but an attempt to save lives. Such institutions operate
under the most ethical standards possible.</TE>
<TE>   We are confident that, armed with valid and reliable information,
many more cancer patients will choose to participate in clinical
trials. Greater participation will mean better results. And better
results will lead to more effective treatment, to better prevention
strategies and, one day, to the elimination of cancer altogether.</TE>

<HD>United We Stand, but We'll Snoop Divided</HD>
<DH>Here's a TIP: Turning neighbors into spies is a bad idea.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT A. LEVY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thankfully, House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) is trying to
prevent the Terrorism Information and Prevention System, or TIPS
program, from being included in the homeland security bill.</LD>
<LD>   Armey has the right idea. TIPS is crafted to transform us into a
nation of meddlers and snoops.</LD>
<LD>   The administration plans to recruit a million volunteers by next
month to serve as government informants in 10 test cities. If the
plan works, the goal is to enroll 4% of Americans, or about 11
million domestic spies across the nation.</LD>
<TE>   Evidently, the focus would be on truck drivers, cable installers,
utility employees and others whose jobs regularly take them to a
variety of places. (Bush wanted letter carriers to participate, but
the Postal Service has declined.) According to reports, the
government recruits would be well-positioned to recognize suspect
activities. Never mind that your typical delivery driver or utility
worker possesses neither the experience nor the expertise to judge
what might be considered suspicious.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that, the new breed of federal informant would identify
potential mischief and potential mischief-makers, then report
directly to the Justice Department, where all that information would
be stored in a central database--yet another database containing
names of people who have not been charged with any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and his staff would, in turn, make the
database available to state and local authorities, for who knows what
purpose.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has been quick to disavow any intent to
deputize a pack of private moles. Homeland Security chief Tom Ridge
told reporters: "The last thing we want is Americans spying on
Americans. That's just not what the president is all about, and not
what the TIPS program is all about." And Justice Department
spokeswoman Barbara Comstock insisted that "none of the Operations
TIPS materials ... made reference to entry or access to the homes of
individuals; nor has it ever been the intention of the Department of
Justice, or any other agency, to set up such a program. Our interest
in establishing the Operation TIPS program is to allow American
workers to share information they receive in the regular course of
their jobs in public places and areas."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps. But if the administration merely seeks more and better
information from diligent citizens, then why not simply publish a
phone number where questionable behavior can be reported? That would
reach 285 million Americans, not just a paltry 11 million.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Justice Department would identify a special cohort of
citizens who are presumably able to perform investigative work that
the rest of us aren't positioned or equipped to perform.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's motives may indeed be pure. But the law of
unintended consequences would be apt to prevail. We would soon have
meter readers on our property supposedly doing what we expect them to
do; yet they might then rummage around our private residences and
file a report with the Justice Department on anything they deemed
questionable. If police officers wanted to do the same thing, they'd
have to convince a judge or magistrate that there was probable cause
to issue a search warrant.</TE>
<TE>   TIPS may not raise 4th Amendment concerns, but it comes pretty
close. What's worse, the program almost certainly wouldn't work. In
fact, it probably would be counterproductive. With limited resources
to battle terrorism, federal, state and local authorities definitely
don't need an avalanche of worthless tips to ferret through to find
maybe a nugget of useful information somewhere in the heap.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, that's not to say citizens should keep it to themselves
when they observe suspect behavior in plain view. But the answer
isn't a legion of federal emissaries serving essentially as
undercover agents.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorists are not stupid. They will not invite a utility worker
in to spot the latest weaponry. That means the meter readers and
cable installers would, for the most part, be observing ordinary
Americans doing ordinary things.</TE>
<TE>   The fear is that more zealous or malevolent informants would
somehow find a national security risk lurking behind everyday
conduct--an assessment that would occasionally be driven by outright
prejudice or personal vendetta.</TE>
<TE>   Every 20th century dictator appointed civilian armies to watch
over their neighbors. The Bush administration would do well not to
follow in those footsteps.</TE>

<LD>Like clockwork, the summer scandal season is upon us. Last year it
was the Chandra Levy-Gary Condit matter. This year it's corporate
fraud, abuse and excess of historical proportions. Except this time,
it's wreaking havoc in the stock market and now in our politics.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush has tried to get ahead of the current scandal by
jawboning the corporate community and Wall Street crowd. His efforts
have been met with mixed results because, one, he is fighting a
stereotype of the GOP as the "party of big business" and, two,
because of the revelations about his allegedly hypocritical behavior
when he was a director of Harken Energy Corp. a decade ago.</LD>
<LD>   Now members of Congress have gotten into the act, working to
deploy new laws and regulations to prevent corporate abuses, even
though it was they who helped foster the current situation with the
laws they passed with zeal in 1995.</LD>
<TE>   Partisan finger-pointing seems to rule the day. No surprise.</TE>
<TE>   What is strikingly absent from the current scandal is any
contrition or apologies from the likes of Enron, Global Crossing,
Arthur Andersen, WorldCom, etc. Nor has there been much condemnation
coming from credible leaders of the business community.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of outrage and anger from business leaders that
echo the sentiments of disenchanted investors, one must conclude that
it isn't, as the president said, just a few bad apples--it's the
barrel. Yet the current crisis of confidence in the business
community should not be viewed in a vacuum. It is but the latest in a
series of assaults on institutions whose health and public confidence
are critical to the nation's well-being.</TE>
<TE>   Lest we forget, the revelations this spring regarding the
intelligence failures of the FBI, the CIA and the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, the sins and orchestrated cover-up by the
Catholic Church and the steroids controversy in professional baseball
all combine to seriously undermine public confidence.</TE>
<TE>   At best, these institutions have an ethics problem. At worst, we
are in the throes of a moral crisis. Thus the White House and
Washington would be well advised to see the current crisis of
confidence in a broader context.</TE>
<TE>   Therein lies an opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   With his popularity strong, President Bush is in a unique
position. After all, he owes his election in large part to Bill
Clinton. In our amazing and enduring self-correcting democracy,
George W. Bush was the "repenter" who replaced the "sinner." Thus,
Bush's elevation to the presidency had moral undertones. So who
better to lead us out of our ethical-moral quagmire?</TE>
<TE>   Here is how:</TE>
<TE>   * Washington cannot restore confidence in the business community
and financial institutions that form the foundation for our economic
system. Only corporate America itself can fix that. The president
should be the catalyst for credible business leaders across the
country to convene a summit with the aim of self-policing. If stock
options need to be expensed to a company's bottom line, so be it. The
same captains of industry who advocate less government in their
affairs must take the responsibility to rebuild confidence;
structural integrity needs to be its cornerstone.</TE>
<TE>   * The homeland security plan is more fig leaf than serious
enterprise and is falling into a bureaucratic abyss. Bush should
shake up the bungling FBI, CIA and INS. The president should not
carry the sins of the federal bureaucracy on his shoulders,
regardless of how loyal he is. Fire a couple of chiefs to restore
public confidence.</TE>
<TE>   * Go to Notre Dame and give the definitive speech on the
ethical-moral crisis facing the nation. Here Bush can applaud the
pope and the cardinals for coming forward to deal with the problems
in their priesthood. Perhaps the business community will take note
how mea culpas  work.</TE>
<TE>   * George W. Bush once ran a major league baseball team. His
credentials to comment on the excesses and ethics of professional
sports are solid. In an era in which radio announcers broadcast the
"athlete arrest of the day," the president can find the opportunity
to speak about role models and the importance of maintaining
professionalism.</TE>
<TE>   The American people will not lose confidence in themselves even as
they lose confidence in their institutions, crumbling under the
weight of arrogance and excess. Equally important is that Americans
are forgiving as long as they are dealt with in a sincere and honest
fashion.</TE>
<TE>   The current crises of confidence in the nation's institutions
require the president to take command.</TE>
<TE>   He has the moral authority, the political capital, the skills to
do it. In fact, he can probably put his heart into it, something
Americans don't often see from their leader.</TE>

<LD>When Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn this month proposed a "new
partnership" of businesses, religious leaders, nonprofit groups and
government to improve learning and literacy in Los Angeles, he drew
applause--and skepticism. Appoint a task force to improve education?
In this town? Unlike New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who
recently wrested operating control over schools from the state
Legislature, Hahn has no direct authority over schools. But anyone
who concludes that civic leaders here can't influence education
defines learning, and leadership, too narrowly.</LD>
<LD>   Saying the mayor has no control over the school day ignores the
opportunity for learning outside of school. That nonschool time used
to be filled by extended families, stay-at-home moms and neighbors
who oversaw children's play, chores, homework and other after-school
activities.</LD>
<LD>   These days, recreation centers, sports teams, church groups,
private lessons, volunteer work and part-time jobs may fill that time
and provide adult guidance. Or, in too many neighborhoods, kids
choose between a TV inside a locked apartment and unsupervised time
on the street.</LD>
<TE>   City Council President Alex Padilla recently asked the city
Commission for Children, Youth and Families to survey just what
after-school programs, public and private, were out there. This
modest step is one that surprisingly few cities have taken. The
challenge for the mayor's new partnership is to determine which
programs best boost children's chances of academic and social
success. Then the coalition needs to foster programs in neighborhoods
that lack them.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is rich in residents with the passion and expertise to
help, from researchers at high-powered universities and think tanks
to leaders of nonprofit programs and advocacy groups such as New
Schools, Better Neighborhoods, which lobbies for schools to serve as
community centers.</TE>
<TE>   No, Hahn can't walk into John C. Fremont High School and, presto,
fix the nightmares described in a recent Times story. Two-thirds of
Fremont's students drop out before reaching their senior year. A
third of the school's 2,300 freshmen read no better than
third-graders.</TE>
<TE>   As badly as fixes are needed there, failure starts earlier in the
Los Angeles Unified School District. After-school programs, parks,
museums, churches, sports leagues, businesses and others can help
fill the gaps. Otherwise, Los Angeles will come up short not just on
skilled workers but on the shared values that knit isolated
individuals into a city. This is exactly the kind of crisis the mayor
should address.</TE>

<LD>A grand jury has indicted one police officer for assault and another
for filing a false report in the now-infamous videotaped beating of a
handcuffed 16-year-old. It's time for the Inglewood Police Department
to take a hard look not just at this incident but at itself.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for Jeremy J. Morse, the Inglewood police officer
charged with slamming Donovan Jackson onto a squad car and punching
him in the face, argue that a gas station surveillance tape, unlike
the widely broadcast videotape recorded by a witness, captured the
beginning of the fray and explains the use of force. It's hard to
imagine a justification for roughing up someone in handcuffs even if
he had resisted earlier, but that will be sorted out in court and in
a bevy of ongoing investigations, including Inglewood's own and one
by the Justice Department.</LD>
<LD>   What the Inglewood police chief, Ron Banks, must ask himself is,
which was the aberration--the rough treatment or the fact that it was
captured on camera?</LD>
<TE>   As reported in last Monday's Times, witness interviews, court
records and police documents revealed at least a dozen prior
complaints alleging that Inglewood officers had mistreated arrestees
in recent years. Yet over the last five years, Inglewood has not
referred a single case to the Los Angeles County district attorney's
office for potential prosecution, compared with more than 400 such
referrals from the L.A. Police Department and the L.A. County
Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, these are much larger departments than the cop shop that
polices Inglewood. But even Burbank, Pasadena, Beverly Hills and
other small cities have referred at least one case of excessive
force.</TE>
<TE>   Cops and others who have rallied to Morse's defense use
Inglewood's high crime rate to argue that the public doesn't
understand the dangers officers are up against. But that raises the
second question Inglewood needs to ask itself: How are Inglewood cops
trained to approach a scene so that things won't escalate, to
differentiate between a scary 16-year-old Crip and a scared teenager
who may be slow to process their commands?</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times last week, Inglewood parent Marie
Chavis spoke movingly of raising sons in a neighborhood so dangerous
that even getting from home to school and back is a challenge. Yes,
cops are needed, desperately, to protect residents from the thugs who
turn daily routine into a risk. But in addition to warning her boy to
stay clear of gangs and drugs, Chavis has to worry that he will be
approached by cops who assume he's a gangbanger or a drug dealer and
treat him accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always taught him that there were good cops and bad cops,"
she said. Inglewood needs to be sure its training produces the good
ones.</TE>

<HD>Shady Moves on Forest Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a clumsy stroke of doublespeak, the Bush administration has at
once embraced a landmark plan to protect the Sierra Nevada and
launched a study that could undermine that very plan. It is easy to
suspect that the results of the new study are ordained already.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 10 years of work preceded the Clinton administration's
adoption of the Sierra Nevada Framework, a management plan for 11.5
million acres of national forest designed to protect old-growth
timber and endangered wildlife and their habitats, to safeguard
watersheds and to provide fire control. The work was begun in the
early 1990s to protect the California spotted owl but grew into an
effort to safeguard common elements of the whole range, spanning 500
miles from the Tehachapi peaks on the south to the Modoc plateau on
the north--10 national forests, four national parks and the Lake
Tahoe basin.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps never has an entire range been studied in such detail. The
precursor of the framework was the Sierra Nevada Ecosystem Project,
ordered by Congress in 1993, which sent about 100 scientists to
catalog problems such as the loss of habitat and the speed of
development in the foothills. The widely hailed report was published
at UC Davis in 1996.</LD>
<TE>   When the Bush administration took office, the Agriculture
Department announced it would not overturn the framework, a backdoor
sort of approval that cheered environmentalists and angered
commercial timber interests because the framework cut back on some
kinds of logging.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, the U.S. Forest Service announced that the plan
would be subjected to a "broad review." And recently, Regional
Forester Jack Blackwell said up to six scientists would be hired to
look at the plan. "We think there is strong value in getting good
scientists together and answering policy questions for us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   What was wrong with the 100 scientists who spent three years
studying the Sierra, let alone the professionals of the Forest
Service who live and work in the range? The most logical answer,
unfortunately, is that the review will be political cover for
weakening the plan, to allow more logging of bigger trees in the
guise of fire protection.</TE>
<TE>   The framework has an entirely adequate fire control plan that
includes concessions to logging interests. It focuses on clearing
fire fuels around built-up areas, including trees of up to 30 inches
in diameter within a quarter-mile of homes and other development.
Furthermore, recent studies show that more logging does not
necessarily mean fewer fires.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has overturned a number of sound
environmental initiatives from the Clinton era on the excuse that
they were not based on "good science." When it comes to the science
of the Sierra framework, that's a tall mountain to climb.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Marital Bliss Just Pipe Dream" (July 18), concerning the new cities'
water supply in the event of secession, is inadequate in that it
merely echoes the Local Agency Formation Commission's decision that
the water supply is "community property" that can be divided just
like any other asset. It ignores the fact that the Valley and
Hollywood would be reneging on an agreement they made to annex to Los
Angeles to obtain water from the Owens Valley. LAFCO's assumption is
that this is no longer a valid legal agreement, and the new cities
would retain proportional rights to this water, as well as the L.A.
River water, after secession.</LD>
<LD>   In the event of a severe drought and a water shortage, Los Angeles
officials will have a first responsibility to their own citizens to
prevent rationing. It is at that point that the annulment of
annexation agreements and the question of who owns the water will
come into play. My guess is that Los Angeles will not wait for such a
crisis to occur and will litigate this matter immediately if the
areas were to secede. Under these circumstances, why would any
thinking person accept the risk of secession?</LD>

<TE>   The downtown elite loves to characterize the San Fernando Valley
leaders as middle-aged, middle-class white guys. What do we see
downtown? Middle-aged, off-the-scale rich white guys. Billionaire
businessman Eli Broad owns Malibu property and doesn't want to grant
public access to the beach. This is a man who is concerned about the
downtrodden? Sure, as long as they don't tread near him. Ted Stein is
a mega-millionaire real estate developer. Larry Levine, chairman of
One Los Angeles, is a political consultant who makes a king's ransom
representing downtown interests. And don't listen to the voodoo magic
coming out of the latest self-anointed leader who trades his name and
integrity for influence ("Invoking Magic Against Breakup," July 17).
Earvin "Magic" Johnson, an ex-jock on a business-expansion tear and
with political aspirations, does not represent the underclass. Get
smart, Los Angeles. Wake up, San Fernando Valley. Take back control
of your city. Show that the people are in charge on Nov. 5 and vote
for city reorganization.</TE>

<LD>For once I agree with the pro-immigration types ("Immigration
Crackdown Ineffective, Study Finds," July 17). A strengthened border
isn't making much of a difference. What remains is for Americans to
have the courage to search for and expel the countless illegal
immigrants already here.</LD>
<LD>   There is nothing sane about letting a man like Hesham Hadayet
remain in the U.S. after first working illegally on a visitor's visa,
and then while he appealed his rejection for political asylum--to
have him later commit his terrorism at LAX. The message to the
Hadayets of the world is that if you get past the border you can stay
here for life. Only when we aggressively expel illegals in residence
will there be true immigration control. Despite the spin that
open-border lovers try to put on it, immigration is not a class or
racial issue. It is, and always has been, a national security issue.</LD>

<LD>In his July 18 letter, James Buslepp states that because President
Bush has succeeded in getting U.S. troops exempted from prosecution
by the International Criminal Court they can now engage in genocide
or other crimes against humanity with impunity.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. troops are still covered by the Uniform Code of Military
Justice, which is stricter on crimes than most countries. Even so, it
is preferable to subject troops to this code rather than a court that
makes its own laws, prosecutes them, issues a judgment and decides
the punishment, all without being subject to appeal. I can't think of
anyone who would like being under the jurisdiction of such a court.</LD>

<LD>Re "War, the Mother of Inventions," July 17: Isn't the real "mother
of inventions" human creativity? War is the "mother" of a lot of
other things--fear, for example, and hysterical circumscription of
our freedoms, not to mention the loss of innocent lives.</LD>
<LD>   The inventions that are being promoted now in the guise of
"homeland security" are blatant exploitations of our current fears;
they may stimulate a fading economy temporarily but will not help the
American people in the long run. Nor will they save us from
"terrorism," which has causes and effects that go far beyond
surveillance devices and neighborhood informers. Will we ever address
the roots of those causes and effects? I am beginning to doubt it,
sad to say.</LD>

<LD>To date, the search for successor structures to the World Trade
Center and monuments to the victims of Sept. 11 has produced designs
that neither persuade the onlooker of their utility nor lift our
souls (July 17). They do not, in the familiar phrase, "make a
statement."</LD>
<LD>   Here is an alternative. Build two towers in place of the old ones,
functionally and in appearance identical to their predecessors but
with antiaircraft missile defenses on the roofs. That will make a
statement.</LD>

<HD>Issue of Police Abuse: Walk a Mile in Another's Shoes</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I would like to respond to the people who are defending the actions
of Inglewood Officer Jeremy Morse (letters, July 18). I'm going to
assume that most of these people have never been beaten or even
abused by police. I have been, and so have many of my friends and
relatives.</LD>
<LD>   I'm not suggesting that all cops are abusive that way, but I think
most of them feel that they have the right to mistreat us because
they wear a badge. If you still think that Morse's behavior was
"probably over the line" but not "brutality" then it sounds like you
are saying that they literally have to beat us to the ground for it
to be brutality.</LD>

<TE>   Quite possibly letter writer Ann Bein's uneventful contact with
the police regarding her registration had less to do with the fact
that she is white and more to do with her conduct when stopped. I am
sure she was polite, listened to the officer and complied with his
instructions. I am sure she did not argue, ignore his instructions or
bloody his ear.</TE>

<TE>   I was appalled to read your letters. First of all, it was a
miracle that the incident was caught on tape. How often, I wonder,
has this been happening but we don't see it? I also agree with Rep.
Maxine Waters; Crooks' offenses were minor. He stole from his mother.
To those who agreed with the officers' side: If Donovan Jackson were
your own son, would you consider the behavior of the policemen
correct?</TE>

<TE>   Re "Chill Wind Over Witnesses," editorial, July 16: In an
atmosphere of strong support for Crooks after his arrest, I am going
to go out on a limb on this one. As an African American, I am
overwhelmingly pleased that this brutality was captured on video and
very thankful to Crooks for his bravery. But the truth is, Crooks is
a crook and has committed crimes that he has failed to answer for. It
is called basic math: If you do the crime, you do the time.</TE>
<TE>   His song about retaliation was a poor rendition of "Cry Me a
River" and nothing more than a smoke screen to take the attention off
him. I wonder if these community activists, politicians and citizens
would be rallying and advocating for him had he not shot that video.
I don't think so.</TE>

<TE>   On July 13, the same day Waters protested the apparent beating of
a youth in Inglewood and sought $10,000 in donations to defend an
alleged felon who taped the incident, 300 protesters marched in the
Valley to protest gang violence. Days later and not very far away,
hundreds of FBI members, police officers and sheriff's deputies
hunted for a child murderer and sexual predator.</TE>
<TE>   With a week's worth of perspective, let's ask ourselves: What are
the real threats to the lives of Inglewood children? Gangs, sexual
predators or racist cops? Who is working most frantically right now
to protect those same children? Al Sharpton, Waters or the police? We
might want to think about that for a moment when we lock our doors
tonight and peek in on the kids.</TE>

<HD>Gray Davis' War Chest Provokes Calls to Battle</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Davis' Filing Reveals $32-Million War Chest," July 17: In the
last several months, while the state struggles to deal with a
multibillion-dollar budget deficit, Gov. Gray Davis has been bringing
in an average of $1,800 an hour in campaign donations, according to
the San Francisco Chronicle.</LD>
<LD>   If Davis governed with as much energy as he employs in
fund-raising, our state might not be in its current predicament. The
recent budget shortfall and energy crisis have exposed the governor's
ineffectiveness. When Californians go to the polls, they will show
Davis that voters, not donors, determine the results of our
elections.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Craig Hirshman</LD>
<TE>   San Diego</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Why is Davis so good at raising funds? There can be only one
reason: his reputation as a politician who takes care of his
contributors. That $32 million is a frightening measure of how many
people own a piece of our governor.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Houghton</TE>
<TE>   Encino</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It has frequently been written by political commentators around
California, including George Skelton in his July 18 column, that
Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon's campaign is lost and
ineffective. That may be true, for who am I to disagree with
professional political commentators.</TE>
<TE>   However, I do know that Davis' governing has been lost and
ineffective as well. California is now three weeks past its deadline
on a budget and Davis does not seem to be leading the Legislature to
a resolution of its budget disagreements.</TE>
<TE>   I care more about our government's budget problems than about who
is leading in the polls.</TE>

<TE>   The Times would do a better service to readers if it spent less
ink on how Simon saves on his personal taxes (July 16) and more on
why Davis spends so much of everyone's personal taxes.</TE>

<HD>John Gilbert, 88; Fought for Small Shareholders</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He was known as a professional corporate gadfly, but John J. Gilbert
preferred to call himself the "Prince of Proxies."</LD>
<LD>   Gilbert, a New York investor who died July 15 at his daughter's
home in Denver at age 88, spent more than 60 years fighting, along
with his older brother, Lewis, for the rights of small shareholders.</LD>
<LD>   The brothers, who at one time owned shares in about 1,500
companies, at their peak attended as many as 150 annual corporate
meetings a year.</LD>
<TE>   They fought for complete disclosure of company operations and for
cumulative voting, which allows investors to cast all of their votes
for a single director, thus increasing the chance of minority
shareholders to name board representatives.</TE>
<TE>   They demanded that annual meetings be held in convenient
locations, that there be ceilings on executive compensation and
limits on stock options.</TE>
<TE>   They also insisted that independent corporate auditors be elected
by stockholders, not appointed by management.</TE>
<TE>   And they weren't shy.</TE>
<TE>   John Gilbert, in particular, brought a sense of a showmanship to
corporate meetings.</TE>
<TE>   He wore a red clown's nose to an annual shareholder meeting of
Mattel in the '70s after the toy company acquired Ringling Bros. and
Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, and then passed noses out at other
stockholder meetings.</TE>
<TE>   After being kicked out of a Chock Full o' Nuts annual meeting one
year, he returned the next year with a pair of boxing gloves strung
around his neck.</TE>
<TE>   "His line was, hit them hard and leave them laughing," said Margot
Gilbert Frank, Gilbert's only child.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Gilbert needed attention-getting props to get his points
across, although he sometimes had to fight to be heard.</TE>
<TE>   He wrestled a contender for a microphone at one annual meeting.
And after his questions turned to shouts at a 1965 annual meeting of
Desilu Productions, he was ordered to leave the auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   During his struggle with a security guard to keep from being
ejected, Gilbert lost his glasses, and the two men scuffled briefly
in the aisle.</TE>
<TE>   Desilu President Lucille Ball, according to a Los Angeles Times
account, had "stared knives" at Gilbert throughout most of the
meeting, saying at one point, "I've read about him. He's all what
they say."</TE>
<TE>   A decade ago, Business Week dubbed Gilbert "the grandfather of
America's corporate gadflies." By his count, he had put forward more
than 2,000 shareholder proposals in 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert was the bane of corporate executives, but a hero to small
investors.</TE>
<TE>   "In light of what's happening today in the accounting profession
and with corporate reporting, John Gilbert was decades ahead of his
time in wanting to make sure that corporate management reported
results accurately," said Peter Firmin, director of development for
the School of Accountancy in the Daniels College of Business at the
University of Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Firmin said Gilbert wanted to ensure that corporations "fully
reported the results of activities to all shareholders, not only
major shareholders, that they increased the depth and breadth of
information included in annual reports. He wanted to make sure that
boards of directors were as independent as possible and were not
simply tools of management.</TE>
<TE>   "In other words, he was calling for accuracy and full disclosure
of accounting information long before it was popular to do so."</TE>
<TE>   John Jacob Gilbert was born in Manhattan in 1914. His father had
been part owner of a paper mill but had sold his share and lived off
investments.</TE>
<TE>   "I was born with a silver spoon and polished it," Gilbert liked to
say. He went to private school, graduated from Patrick Business
School in Manhattan and later lived off his investments.</TE>
<TE>   The Gilbert brothers' campaign for corporate responsibility and
shareholder rights began in 1932 when Lewis Gilbert attended an
annual meeting and wasn't allowed to ask a question.</TE>
<TE>   In 1946, the Gilberts challenged Transamerica Insurance Co. by
seeking to add several resolutions to the company's proxy statement.</TE>
<TE>   They asked that Transamerica move its annual meeting from
Delaware, the state of incorporation, to California, where its
operations were based. They also proposed that shareholders be able
to approve or reject management's choice of auditors, and that
minutes be provided to shareholders who could not attend the annual
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "Prior to 1946 a company could legally refuse anybody's resolution
in the proxy statement, so all you got if you were lucky was to vote
for the directors," John Gilbert's daughter said.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the Transamerica case, she said, the Securities and
Exchange Commission began requiring that all corporations include
relevant shareholder resolutions in proxy statements.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert called the ruling "the Magna Carta" for small
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   But that was just the beginning, said his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "Then they went fighting for independent auditors, which are now
an accepted practice. The highlight is probably that they've gotten
so many companies to pass cumulative voting."</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert's brother, Lewis, died in 1993. Gilbert stopped attending
annual meetings in 2000, after his wife of 53 years, Margaret, died.</TE>
<TE>   A longtime resident of Manhattan, Gilbert became ill last fall
while attending a reception honoring his endowment of a professorship
in accounting at the University of Denver. Suffering from multiple
myeloma, he remained in Denver with his daughter, who survives him
along with three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Gene Moss, 75; Children's TV Writer, Smokey Bear's Voice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gene Moss, who co-wrote the TV cartoon show "Roger Ramjet" and
co-wrote and hosted the satiric Los Angeles television children's
show "Shrimpenstein" in the mid-1960s during a varied career that
included a 10-year stint supplying the voice of Smokey Bear, has
died. He was 75.</LD>
<LD>   A Palm Desert resident since retiring from advertising and
voice-over work, he died of cancer July 15 at Eisenhower Medical
Center in Rancho Mirage.</LD>
<LD>   Moss and his writing partner in comedy and advertising, Jim
Thurman, co-wrote all 156 episodes of "Roger Ramjet," a 1965
syndicated cartoon show known for its puns, Hollywood in-jokes and
cultural references. Gary Owens supplied the voice of the show's
patriotic, "Proton Energy Pill"-popping superhero, with Moss
providing the voices of Doodle and Noodles Romanoff.</LD>
<TE>   But many Southern California baby boomers may know Moss best as
the host of "Shrimpenstein," a half-hour afternoon show on KHJ-TV
(Channel 9) in the late '60s.</TE>
<TE>   Shrimpenstein was a miniature Frankenstein's monster--a hand
puppet controlled by Moss, who appeared on camera as the mad
scientist Dr. Rudolph Von Schtick, whose laboratory was in a medieval
castle.</TE>
<TE>   Thurman provided the voice of Shrimpenstein and manipulated and
supplied the voices of the other ghoulish puppet cast members. They
included Claus (only the arm and hand of a big purple monster
appeared on camera), It (just a roaring and chomping sound effect of
a monster who would eat any visitors to the castle), Wilfred the Wolf
(just a gnarly hand poking out of a box) and the swinging Tijuana
Bats (hand puppets that did record parodies). Moss and Thurman
co-wrote the show.</TE>
<TE>   "Co-ad-libbed is probably more to the point," Thurman said from
his home in Sheffield, Mass. "We had a script the first two or three
shows. They were kind of dopey little kid things, and we kind of
ad-libbed around it, and [because of that] the show became hip and
wasn't for little kids anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the show began attracting nearly as many adults as
children. Rod Serling was a big fan of the show's irreverent humor,
Thurman said, as was actress Elizabeth Montgomery. And, he said, "the
Disney people loved the show."</TE>
<TE>   Although "Shrimpenstein" started out with Moss and Thurman
bantering between the two cartoons that aired during the half hour,
the in-studio comedy became so popular that the cartoons were
dropped.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time they were doing "Shrimpenstein," Moss and Thurman
briefly hosted a live one-hour talk show on KHJ, "The Moss and
Thurman or Thurman and Moss or Show."</TE>
<TE>   It was canceled after about eight weeks. And after about a year
and a half on the air, so was "Shrimpenstein." But it had made an
impression.</TE>
<TE>   "There are huge fans out there; it's amazing," said Moss' son,
Chuck Moshontz, a former newscaster for KLOS-FM in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Hosting the show was a natural for Moss, who a few years earlier
had written and sung the songs on a novelty album called "Dracula's
Greatest Hits." (Many of the songs were take-offs on Beatles tunes
such as "I Want to Bite Your Hand.")</TE>
<TE>   "He was a total ham, an absolute ham," Moshontz said of his
father.</TE>
<TE>   Born Eugene Harold Moshontz in 1926, Moss grew up in Cleveland. He
was in Army basic training when World War II ended and served in the
occupying forces in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   After his discharge, he moved to Los Angeles, where he married his
first wife, Ileen, and held a variety of jobs, including owning a
couple of used bookstores. Then he was editor of the Brentwood
Spectator, a weekly community newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   But he cut his journalistic career short in 1959 when he landed a
job writing liner notes at Capitol Records. In the early 1960s, he
turned to advertising, writing print ads and commercials.</TE>
<TE>   After "Shrimpenstein," Moss and Thurman became staff comedy
writers for Dean Martin, Carol Burnett and Bob Hope. At the same
time, they launched their own boutique agency, Moss and Thurman
Creative Advertising Stuff.</TE>
<TE>   In 1979, the U.S. Forest Service tapped Moss' hard-edged baritone
for a 10-year stint as Smokey.</TE>
<TE>   He retired to Palm Desert in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son, Moss is survived by his wife of 30 years,
Carolyn; two other children, Ron Moshontz of Wilmington, N.C., and
Linda Parks of Thousand Oaks; and six grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held at 6 p.m. Saturday at the
Sportsman's Lodge, 12833 Ventura Blvd., Studio City.</TE>

<HD>Mario Juruna, 58; Only Indian to Serve in Brazil's Congress</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mario Juruna, 58, a leader of the Xavante Indian tribe of central
Brazil and the only Indian to serve in Brazil's Congress, died
Tuesday in Brasilia of complications from diabetes.</LD>
<LD>   A critic of government policies, Juruna was elected to the Chamber
of Deputies as a member of the opposition Democratic Labor Party in
1982. He served four years representing Rio de Janeiro state but was
defeated in a reelection bid.</LD>
<LD>   Juruna initially ran for Congress after eight years of leading a
sometime violent struggle for land rights for the Xavantes, a tribe
that in the early 1980s numbered about 6,000.</LD>
<TE>   Raised in the interior of Mato Grosso, Juruna spoke tribal
dialects until age 17, when he learned Portuguese. He later recalled
that he hadn't seen a white man until he was 16. He worked for
several years as a ranch hand before returning to his tribe and
becoming an effective advocate in dealing with the government.</TE>
<TE>   Juruna dropped out of politics after his reelection defeat and
moved to Guara, a city near Brasilia, where he complained against
political corruption in Brazil.</TE>

Pianist</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nellie Monk, 80, the wife, supporter and muse of jazz pianist and
composer Thelonious Monk, died of a cerebral hemorrhage June 25 at
Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</LD>
<LD>   Born in St. Petersburg, Fla., she moved with her family to New
York City as a child, living first in Brooklyn and then in the San
Juan Hill section of Manhattan. She met Monk at a local basketball
court when she was 14 and he was 17. They were together from 1947
until his death in 1982.</LD>
<LD>   During the 1940s and '50s, she worked as a seamstress to
supplement the income he made as a jazz musician. And while not
officially his manager, Nellie Monk did handle many of the financial
burdens associated with the jazz life--paying musicians, arranging
air travel for band members and collecting money from promoters.</LD>
<TE>   Monk wrote the ballad "Crepuscule With Nellie" for her in 1957,
while she was facing surgery for a thyroid condition.</TE>

<LD>An autopsy conducted Sunday could not pinpoint the cause of death of
a 4-month-old baby who was left in a car, a coroner's spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   The infant, Christian Rodrigo of Hacienda Heights, was allegedly
left for seven to eight hours Wednesday by his mother. When Roxanne
Rodrigo returned to the car, the boy was dead, authorities said. But
the death went unreported until Saturday, when Rodrigo told her
father, who summoned police.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies arrested Rodrigo, 23, on
suspicion of murder. She is being held in lieu of $1-million bail.</LD>
<TE>   The county coroner's office will perform additional tests, said
coroner's Lt. Fred Corral.</TE>

<HD>An Unlikely Leader Steers Valley Secession</HD>
<DH>Politics: Jeff Brain owes thousands in taxes and his voter
registration was revoked. Yet he's credited with getting cityhood on
the ballot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't Jeff Brain's charisma that helped get San Fernando Valley
secession on the Nov. 5 ballot. Even he acknowledges that he tends to
appear stiff and trips over his words.</LD>
<LD>   The Valley VOTE president has made other stumbles as well,
embarrassing himself and sometimes clouding the message of his
campaign.</LD>
<LD>   He owes thousands of dollars in city, state and federal taxes,
debts that in some cases stretch back 12 years and continue to mount.
He cast ballots in several Los Angeles elections while living in the
city of Glendale and later registered to vote at a Sherman Oaks
business address, prompting county officials to revoke his
registration.</LD>
<TE>   And Brain says he had been unaware of his five-year membership in
the American Independent Party, best known as the 1960s vehicle of
onetime segregationist George C. Wallace. He says he registered with
the party by mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Brain's critics seem astounded that he could have played such a
major role in putting the historic secession initiative before
voters. But they and his supporters agree that the measure wouldn't
have happened without the 43-year-old's energy, single-minded
devotion and wonkish ability to wade through bureaucratic jargon and
procedure.</TE>
<TE>   "No person has worked harder at getting secession on the ballot
than Jeff Brain," said Richard Close, chairman of Valley VOTE. "The
odds of this getting on the ballot were a thousand to one."</TE>
<TE>   His tax and voting troubles aside, Brain has many typical
secessionist traits. The former high school wrestler is a longtime
Valley activist who disdains the downtown power structure. He tried
to make himself heard through neighborhood groups and by running for
the City Council in 1995 and the city charter commission two years
later, losing each time.</TE>
<TE>   He has a bigger audience now. His boyish face and Woody Woodpecker
hairstyle are a constant presence at hearings, forums and living room
gatherings around the Valley and throughout much of L.A. At every
opportunity, he spins his vision of a new Valley city, his demeanor
always calm, his focus never wavering.</TE>
<TE>   His quiet intensity makes Brain hard to really know, fellow
separatists say.</TE>
<TE>   "I've worked with Jeff for a while," said David Fleming, a
prominent secession backer, "but I can't say that I know him well
personally."</TE>
<TE>   Brain gives the impression that the secession campaign is the
whole of his existence. He holds no other regular job, and hasn't for
several years. The New York native bounces from residence to
residence, the latest a small apartment in Sherman Oaks. Twice
divorced and the father of four, he concedes that the long hours
spent on secession have cost him precious dad hours.</TE>
<TE>   "He eats and sleeps secession while others of us have a life,"
said Valley VOTE board member Bob Scott. "I'm sure he's had to make a
lot of personal sacrifices."</TE>
<TE>   That's true, said Brain. But he adds that he still finds time to
unwind with his sons and daughters, ages 6 to 17. Snapshots of them
decorate his Ventura Boulevard office in Sherman Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope they see that people do care about the community and they
do have a role in the community," Brain said of his children, as he
drove along Woodman Avenue in the northeast Valley. He pointed out
the litter and graffiti that he blamed on poor city services. "I hope
they see that people can make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   Early Interest</TE>
<TE>   Brain developed an interest in local government while growing up
in the Long Island town of Bayport, one of seven children. His mother
was active in the PTA. A community parade was a heralded event. Town
leaders could be called to account at the local diner.</TE>
<TE>   In 1971, Brain's world expanded when his father, an aerospace
manager, moved the family to Encino. Riding for the first time
through the Sepulveda Pass on the San Diego Freeway, Brain was
overcome by views of the sprawling Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll never forget it," he said, sitting at his desk in Valley
VOTE's peach-colored office, where an Enya CD was playing.</TE>
<TE>   Brain's family moved back to the East Coast, but he returned to
the Valley after his high school graduation. With $600 in his pocket,
he hopped on a bus for a four-day, nonstop trip to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   He worked at various jobs, as a Radio Shack salesman and a
bookkeeper at a Studio City dress shop. He earned accounting and
finance degrees from Cal State Northridge in 1983. Three years later,
Brain founded a real estate company in Sherman Oaks, which he ran for
a decade. He also twice served as president of the Sherman Oaks
Chamber of Commerce in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Brain started the annual Sherman Oaks Street Festival, which has
raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for schools since 1991. He
also helped Valley residents and businesses hurt by the 1994
Northridge earthquake secure federal money. And he uncovered an
accounting error in a City Council plan to revive Ventura Boulevard,
saving taxpayers millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The council district that Brain sought to represent included parts
of the southeast Valley and Westside. His campaign buttons featured
"Brain Man," a caped superhero with sagging muscles and a huge
exposed brain. Brain finished last in a field of four.</TE>
<TE>   Both that campaign and his 1997 bid for the charter commission, in
which he was third out of seven candidates, left him in debt.</TE>
<TE>   His civic successes, however, had gotten the attention of Valley
VOTE, and the group tapped him in 1996 to head the secession effort.
"The guy was willing to put his heart and soul into a project," Scott
said.</TE>
<TE>   The secession project has made Brain a target at times. City
officials and others take glee in pointing out that the mismanagement
of his own affairs clashes with his assertions that a Valley city
would provide more efficient and accountable government.</TE>
<TE>   Financial Troubles</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't want to count on [Brain] to be my financial advisor,"
said former U.S. Rep. Bobbi Fiedler, a secession enthusiast who broke
with the Valley VOTE leadership and now opposes the cityhood measure.</TE>
<TE>   Brain links his financial problems to his all-consuming commitment
to secession, even though his tax debts predate the breakup movement.
The delinquencies reached a total of $63,305, including taxes,
penalties, interest and related charges. Ten liens have been filed
against him by the state and federal governments, the most recent by
the State Franchise Tax Board in March.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Los Angeles also obtained a court judgment against him
for back taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the benefits I've contributed to society far outweigh
any financial difficulties," Brain said. "I'm not a wealthy person
because I sacrificed to help the community.... I will meet all of my
financial obligations."</TE>
<TE>   Brain said he has reduced his tax debts by almost a third,
although the most current public records available do not show this.</TE>
<TE>   As the only paid staff member at Valley VOTE, Brain and other
secessionists said, he receives a "nominal" salary, a sum they
refused to disclose.</TE>
<TE>   Brain said he has worked out his voting difficulties by moving
back to the Valley. He also changed his registration from the
American Independent Party to "decline to state."</TE>
<TE>   Last winter, the Los Angeles Times reported that Brain had voted
in three Los Angeles elections after moving from the city to Glendale
in 1999. He had registered at his old Sherman Oaks residence, records
show.</TE>
<TE>   "I did nothing wrong," Brain said. "It was a temporary move."</TE>
<TE>   But legal experts questioned Brain's definition of temporary.
Election officials acknowledged the law is loosely defined.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, Brain said, he moved to his brother's house in
Woodland Hills. He found the Sherman Oaks apartment last month.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Brain had registered to vote at Valley VOTE's
address. The county deemed that registration invalid, because voters
must use their home address.</TE>
<TE>   He again became eligible to vote when he registered using his
apartment address.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a mistake," he said. "I didn't know I couldn't use a
business address."</TE>
<TE>   Brain said his registration with the American Independent Party,
from September 1996 until September 2001, was also unintentional. He
said he meant to register as an "independent," but was confused by
the voter form. He said he never received election material from the
party.</TE>
<TE>   But election officials said voters usually receive sample ballots
for their party.</TE>
<TE>   Brain said he doesn't believe in the American Independent Party's
platform, which advocates repealing the U.S. Voting Rights Act and
expelling the children of illegal immigrants from public schools.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace, who served four terms as governor of Alabama, ran for
president as the American Independent Party candidate in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists say Brain's financial and voting problems are
irrelevant to the secession debate. They say The Times' reporting on
his troubles reflects an anti-secession bias.</TE>
<TE>   "When the L.A. Times attacked Jeff, it made him stronger within
the organization," Valley VOTE's Close said. "No one has taken more
criticism than Jeff Brain, and no one has worked harder."</TE>
<TE>   Brain boasted that he must be doing something right. After all, he
is in the middle of a campaign that will help shape the city's
future.</TE>
<TE>   "This is history," he said in his deadpan manner.</TE>

<HD>Computer 'ChessBrain' Is Learning Right Moves</HD>
<DH>Technology: Newbury Park man envisions a machine that will
recognize, and not repeat, its mistakes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Bugzilla and Venomous slug it out, an intense but soft-spoken
computer programmer watches from his apartment in Newbury Park.</LD>
<LD>   Carlos Justiniano has nine computers arrayed on a table in front
of his four-poster bed. Sleeping just four hours a night, he pours
himself into his fast-growing pet project--a globe-girdling network
of computers that he hopes will one day play killer chess.</LD>
<LD>   He says it will be the largest chess computer network ever. But
more than that, it will be a resource for universities, a playground
for researchers in artificial intelligence. Like IBM's storied Deep
Blue, it will take on the world's best chess players; unlike Deep
Blue, Justiniano says, it will learn from its mistakes.</LD>
<TE>   The task is daunting. The total of possible moves in a typical
chess game is the kind of glaze-inducing number ordinarily used to
describe distances between solar systems--10 followed by 43 zeros,
according to some mathematicians. In 1997, Deep Blue succeeded in
humbling chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov, but, despite a number of
efforts, no dedicated band of brainy volunteers has created a network
that can rival it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just huge," said Justiniano, 37. "The only way to do it is
to find the time."</TE>
<TE>   During the day, he works as chief software architect at a Moorpark
industrial controls firm called American MSI. At night he dines with
his wife, Karla, plays with 5-year-old daughter Kaitlyn and in the
wee hours fires up his computers for work on his burgeoning network,
ChessBrain (www.chessbrain.net).</TE>
<TE>   Via the Internet, more than 300 enthusiasts in 25 countries have
volunteered to help, each downloading a program that dedicates a tiny
fraction of their computing power to the cause. While the "node
operators" are sending e-mails to their friends or looking up recipes
on the Internet, a small subconscious piece of their computers
silently drifts to an Internet chess site, where it observes games in
progress.</TE>
<TE>   While Deep Blue was a single, blazing-fast computer, ChessBrain is
an example of "distributed computing"--a system that draws power from
a network of machines. It is being used in efforts as varied as
solving math puzzles and scanning the universe for signs of life.</TE>
<TE>   One recent day, the player who calls himself Bugzilla was wiping
out the one who goes by Venomous. Justiniano's network focused on
their game, analyzing moves smart and stupid, strategies grand and
pathetic. Like minuscule bits of brain food, some 1 million positions
are observed and ingested by ChessBrain in a typical day. Since the
project started a few months ago, more than 39 million positions have
been processed in a central computer.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes well, ChessBrain will itself start to play later this
year, taking on the likes of Bugzilla with the help of a
sophisticated chess program. Eventually, Justiniano envisions
researchers conducting experiments on the network and developing
programs capable of instantly scrutinizing their past mistakes.
Meanwhile, a virtual storehouse will hold all the moves from the
games ChessBrain will have played with both fallible humans and
clever machines.</TE>
<TE>   How well it plays isn't even the point, said Justiniano. As the
hundreds of ChessBrain computers grow into thousands of
ever-more-powerful machines, the play will improve. But more
importantly, he said, so will the network's ability to mull over its
losses and pull winning strategies from the wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   "Deep Blue had no idea what it was doing," he said. "It had an
immense volume of stored information. It was fed every game Kasparov
ever played in tournaments. It had grandmasters and chess consultants
saying: 'This is how you can beat Kasparov.' This is very different
from a machine that learns as it plays."</TE>
<TE>   Justiniano's goal is audacious, according to experts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful idea, but it poses some real technical
challenges," said Andy Prince, a spokesman for United Devices, an
Austin, Texas, company that harnesses distributed computing systems
for complex problems in fields like finance and drug research.</TE>
<TE>   Situations in chess are so complex that they may not be broken
down into parts simple enough for hundreds or thousands of computers
to handle efficiently, he said.</TE>
<TE>   And machine learning is still a relatively new field.</TE>
<TE>   "Deep Blue definitely didn't learn, but I'd be skeptical that his
[network] will be learning anything but some trivial things," said
Monty Newborn, a computer science professor at McGill University in
Montreal who organized the first match between Kasparov and Deep
Blue. "People have tried to get computers to learn, but with only
mediocre success."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Hyatt, creator of a program that twice won world computer
chess championships, agreed that getting a computer to learn the way
even the dullest student does--much less "an electronic Bobby
Fischer"--is a long way off. However, he said, a network like
ChessBrain, with its potentially formidable computing power, could be
a useful tool for researchers.</TE>
<TE>   "The field is wide open," said Hyatt, who teaches computer science
at the University of Alabama. "There could be a lot of simultaneous
experiments on it that deal with machine learning."</TE>
<TE>   That, Justiniano said, is exactly what he wants.</TE>
<TE>   So far he has poured more than $30,000 into the project--money
that could have been used toward a down payment on a family home. He
said he doesn't intend to make a dime on ChessBrain, but hopes it
will enhance his professional reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "I could get a house and do what normal people do," he said, "or
take an incredible risk. I'm shooting for something very large."</TE>
<TE>   Justiniano grew up in New York's crime-riddled South Bronx but
followed the path of math-minded kids everywhere. At 7, he became a
chess nut. As a teenager, he was fascinated by old films like "2001:
A Space Odyssey" and its all-knowing computer, the HAL 9000. Later,
he designed computer games and software, working both for start-ups
and companies like IBM.</TE>
<TE>   He also became involved in SETI@home--a worldwide effort to
analyze radio telescope data for extraterrestrial signals using the
computers of more than 3 million volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   But for all his technological passion, Justiniano can't figure out
the riddle he calls "the modern problem."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm wondering where HAL is," he said. "It's past 2001 and we
don't have what science promised us."</TE>

<LD>Two months before Inglewood Police Officer Jeremy Morse was indicted
in the videotaped beating of a 16-year-old boy, an officer in
neighboring Manhattan Beach was charged with assaulting a young
suspect.</LD>
<LD>   But unlike the incident in Inglewood, there were no videotapes, no
rallies demanding justice, no mayors calling for felony charges and
no allegations of racism. What spurred the criminal investigation in
Manhattan Beach was other officers, who told supervisors they
believed their colleague, Eric Eccles, had used excessive force. The
police chief reviewed their reports and called the district
attorney's office that day.</LD>
<LD>   The Manhattan Beach case, though it did not draw attention
comparable to the Inglewood incident, illustrates the responsibility
that officers have to watch one another--and to report to authorities
when they see apparent misconduct by their colleagues.</LD>
<TE>   "I did what I did because it's the right thing to do, even though
it's a very difficult thing to do," said Sgt. Rob Cochran, a 12-year
veteran who saw the incident and reported it. "But I have a
responsibility, and I take my responsibility wholeheartedly."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Grand Jury indicted Eccles, a three-year
Manhattan Beach police officer, in May on charges of assault by a
public officer and filing a false police report. He was one of six
law enforcement officers in the last two years to be indicted by the
grand jury in connection with an assault or shooting, according to
the district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Eccles, who has pleaded not guilty, could face three years and
eight months in state prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Eccles' attorney, Bill Seki, said his client is innocent on both
charges, maintaining that the police report is accurate and that
Daniel Chance resisted arrest. Seki cited grand jury testimony from
another officer, Sgt. Mark Mason, who saw the end of the incident and
described it as a struggle.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that when we go to trial, the full facts of the case
will come to light," he said. "It will become clear that what
occurred that night was not unlawful conduct on my client's behalf."</TE>
<TE>   Seki said he believes the other officers misperceived the incident
and that Eccles was the only one in a position to see exactly what
happened.</TE>
<TE>   Because of controls put in place after the 1991 Rodney G. King
beating and other high-profile shootings and beatings by officers
across the country, police experts say, officers now usually report
the use of force. In Inglewood, officers reported that the boy had
been punched, though they did not include the fact that he had been
slammed against a patrol car.</TE>
<TE>   But many police still aren't as willing to take the next step: to
say they believe the force used by colleagues was inappropriate or
excessive, experts say. That is changing, slowly, they add, because
of stricter policies, harsher discipline, tighter supervision and the
use of dashboard video monitors.</TE>
<TE>   Increasing ethnic and gender diversity in police forces has also
cut away at the solidarity and old boys networks that used to prevail
in many departments, experts add. And of course, there is the
lingering fear that any action may be videotaped or observed by a
neighbor, and that an officer may be targeted in a misconduct probe.</TE>
<TE>   "[Reporting] is becoming more common for many reasons, most
significantly because it's much harder to cover up," said William
Geller, a criminologist who worked for the U.S. Department of Justice
studying police use of deadly force. "Nobody knows when they might be
on candid camera.... Even if you don't have a video camera, you have
a public that has a heightened sensitivity."</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Capt. Gregory Meyer, who testified before the grand jury in
the Manhattan Beach case, said some officers are inspired to do the
right thing, while others just don't want to lose their jobs. "When
push comes to shove, people act in their self-interest," said Meyer,
who often serves as an expert witness on the use of police force.
"But they are also realizing that it is in their self-interest to
cooperate with investigators."</TE>
<TE>   Departments still have a long way to go, some say, before it
becomes business as usual for officers to report unreasonable use of
force.</TE>
<TE>   "The code of silence is real," said Assistant Head Deputy Dist.
Atty. John Gilligan, who presented the Eccles case to the grand jury.
"We've certainly seen people who have been retaliated against for
stepping forward."</TE>
<TE>   The Manhattan Beach incident occurred just after midnight Dec. 29,
when Eccles and another officer pulled over a car on Rosecrans
Avenue, according to testimony given to the grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   As the other officer gave the driver a ticket for fishtailing his
car while speeding, Chance took off running. He told grand jurors
that he was worried that he would lose his job as a heavy-equipment
operator trainee because he had been drinking and was under 21.
Eccles ran after Chance, saying: "When I find this guy, he is going
to do a tap dance," implying a use of force, according to a fellow
officer's grand jury testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Chance climbed over a fence and hid in a dark backyard, crouching
beneath a deck. When Eccles saw Chance's knee sticking up from under
a piece of plywood, he approached him but did not order him to stand
up or come out from under the deck, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, without warning, Eccles lifted the plywood and repeatedly
hit Chance with a heavy metal flashlight for about 15 seconds,
striking his legs, arms, head and back of the neck, according to
grand jury testimony from Chance and Eccles' fellow officers. Chance
did not have any weapons and did not try to resist arrest, officers
testified.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Joe Guzman, who saw the incident, testified that he
believed at the time that Eccles was "delivering these blows
unnecessarily." But he did not intervene until several seconds later,
according to his testimony. At one point, Sgt. Cochran yelled to
Guzman to get Eccles off the suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Only then did Eccles begin yelling to Chance, "Stop resisting.
Show me your hands," his fellow officers testified. Chance was
arrested and taken to a hospital and into police custody, but no
charges were filed against him.</TE>
<TE>   "Other than being stupid, [Chance] didn't do anything wrong that
night," Gilligan told grand jurors, adding that Chance had no
criminal record. "He ran from a police officer, and what he got was
some good old-fashioned street justice."</TE>
<TE>   In Eccles' report on the incident, he wrote that he had hit Chance
once with his flashlight in a reactive strike. His colleagues,
however, reported a different version to their supervisors that
morning. Guzman, Cochran and Sgt. Mason all wrote statements about
what occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason why I did it was because it's required," Mason said.
"I wear the stripes and I realize that's part of my duties."</TE>
<TE>   Mason, who has been in law enforcement for 15 years, said he could
have faced serious disciplinary action had he not reported the
incident. "There was really no decision-making on my part," he said.
"Things that were condoned years ago are no longer tolerated."</TE>
<TE>   By late that Saturday morning, Manhattan Beach Police Chief Ernest
M. Klevesahl Jr. had read the reports and met with the supervisor. A
few hours later, Klevesahl placed Eccles on administrative leave and
called the district attorney's office to tell them about the case and
schedule a meeting for that Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "It was something that needed immediate action, at least to get
the ball rolling," Klevesahl said.</TE>
<TE>   Gilligan said that getting involved early made a significant
difference in the quality of the criminal investigation because
prosecutors could get fresh statements and keep them separate from
the administrative investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Gilligan said prosecutors were ready to present the case to the
grand jury as early as February, but had scheduling conflicts with
the witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Klevesahl said he was able to respond quickly because the
department is small, with 64 sworn officers.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he said, the size of the department makes it
even more difficult for officers to report what they believe is
misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Like nearly all police departments, Manhattan Beach has policies
and training on the use of force, reporting and ethical
responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Klevesahl instructs officers to document any instance in which
they use force on a suspect and fellow officers to report what they
believe is inappropriate. Then he makes the final call.</TE>
<TE>   "That's part of the checks and balances of a department," he said.
"Not everybody is perfect, and we make mistakes, but I think we do a
pretty good job of policing ourselves. We have to."</TE>

<HD>The Blueprint for El Toro: How Great a Great Park?</HD>
<DH>Land use: Irvine and the Navy this week reveal how the
auction of the closed base will proceed. Activists worry about
housing density; the city has kept details secret.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fate of the closed El Toro Marine Corps Air Station should become
clearer Tuesday as officials with the Navy and Irvine gather at the
base to unveil plans for auctioning the land for development.</LD>
<LD>   The joint news conference also should reveal how far the city has
retreated from its promises of a vast public park at El Toro, which
helped sway voters to ground Orange County's plans for an
international airport.</LD>
<LD>   Fueled by a multimillion-dollar ad campaign, voters in March
approved Measure W, which rezoned the base for parkland, educational
uses and some low-level building. A day later, the Navy announced
that it would sell the property. Irvine took over planning for the
base in April, but the city isn't bound by the March vote.</LD>
<TE>   Dan Jung, Irvine's director of strategic planning, had little more
to offer last week about what ultimately might become of El Toro
other than what the city has said all along: Trust us.</TE>
<TE>   "We think [the land-use plan] is consistent with Measure W and the
Navy's desire to sell the base," he said. "I think [people] will be
pleased."</TE>
<TE>   Since April, the city has shared little about what might happen at
the 4,700-acre base located in the county's core. About 1,000 acres
will stay in federal hands as a wildlife sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   Discussions have been held behind closed doors. Representatives
from a coalition of South County cities that fought the airport
weren't invited, nor were county officials--even though the base
remains under county control.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tom Wilson, whose district encompasses South County,
said he asked for a preview of Irvine's plan but got nothing. "It's
disappointing they don't want to share with anyone," Wilson said.
"It's not for lack of asking. We'll have to give them the benefit of
the doubt that they're truly working in the spirit of Measure W."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine's public face for the last two years has been its Great
Park plan: an ambitious blueprint for sports fields, rolling hills,
vast meadows, a central lake and a western branch of the Smithsonian.
The city spent $8.5 million developing and promoting the Great Park,
according to city invoices--$5.7 million of which went to consultants
who sent maps and mailers to households across Orange County before
the vote.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear how much parkland will remain. Tuesday's announcement
will include proposed zoning for up to six parcels to be auctioned
through the General Services Agency, Jung said. He declined to say
what the zoning will be. Navy officials have repeatedly said that
they will not be giving any land to the city for parks.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime government activist Shirley Grindle of Orange, who
opposed the planned airport, said Irvine officials apparently decided
what can be built at the closed base even though the city hasn't
annexed the property or completed a required environmental review.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm wondering why the residents of Irvine aren't challenging this
process, which in the long run will determine land uses for a chunk
of property that will affect not only them but people in surrounding
communities," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we going to have to face the fact that Irvine may have pulled
a ruse on the public by making one deal with voters and another
behind closed doors with the Navy? Maybe people in Irvine will start
to care what happens [at El Toro] when they start getting all the
traffic. They may have won the battle but lost the war."</TE>
<TE>   Several other airport opponents shared the same worry but declined
to publicly criticize Irvine, noting that while a large urban park
may never be built, neither will the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine's current posture toward El Toro is rooted in the Navy's
unexpected sale announcement in March. That obliterated the city's
hopes of getting the base for free--as its many mailers had
suggested. The city began trying to salvage what it could of its
promise for public lands.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine intends to offer density bonuses if developers turn over
some land for parks and pay a share of building and maintenance
costs. Mayor Larry Agran described the city's efforts as "a
development plan with the idea of a Great Park."</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials said they are so confident in the city's plan that
they will offer El Toro land for sale even before Irvine annexes the
property, which currently is covered by the zoning restrictions in
Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   "We are heartened that the city's concepts have evolved in a
manner that will return higher values for the taxpayers," Navy
installations deputy Wayne Arny wrote to Irvine City Manager Allison
Hart this month.</TE>
<TE>   One possible wrinkle to a smooth sale is lingering soil
contamination that could be unearthed when bulldozers move in. The
federal government is responsible for any contamination found. But
the Navy has no plans to clean the base any more than it already did
for an airport.</TE>
<TE>   Possible contamination issues won't necessarily scare away
potential buyers, said Christine Diemer Iger, former executive
director of the Orange County chapter of the Building Industry Assn.
Bidders will want to know upfront, though, how much time and money
would have to be spent for cleanup before the land could be
developed.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a buzz in the industry [about El Toro], and it's not
about keeping it as open space," said Diemer Iger, now a land-use
attorney and lobbyist with Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips.</TE>
<TE>   "[Bidders] will be interested in what the development
opportunities will be. I think most developers and builders realize
that there will have to be some sort of open space. That's what
happens in the entitlement process: You work with the city so there's
quality of life."</TE>

<HD>School Funding Reform Stalled</HD>
<DH>Education: Effort to equalize allocations for California
students is mired in budget dispute. Backers fear the cost may be
prohibitive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State lawmakers could change the way California funds public schools,
and that has some districts perking up their ears.</LD>
<LD>   A measure under consideration in Sacramento would make basic
per-student funding more uniform among the state's nearly 1,000
school districts by adding $406 million into the equation next year.
It's called "equalization," and many districts have been clamoring
for it for decades.</LD>
<LD>   The way public schools now are funded "is the most serious
inequity that exists in the California education system," said James
A. Fleming, superintendent of the Capistrano Unified School District,
which gets about $50 less than the state average for each of its
47,000 students. Under the new proposal, the district could receive
an extra $86 per student.</LD>
<TE>   The giant 735,000-student Los Angeles Unified School District
could collect almost $29 million, or about $40 more per student. The
tiny La Grange Elementary School District in Stanislaus County, which
has seven students, could get an extra $120 per student.</TE>
<TE>   Basic per-student funding now varies widely from as low as $4,400
per student at Los Angeles County's Walnut Valley Unified District to
a high of $6,600 at Sierra Unified School District in Fresno County.</TE>
<TE>   Districts that already get more money--Sierra, Beverly Hills
Unified and about 160 others--would not get an increase. However,
none would get less than it does now.</TE>
<TE>   But nothing is simple when it comes to state budgets and school
funding. Although there is little opposition to equalizing basic
funding for California students in principle, Assembly Bill 3003 is
part of the overall budget package.</TE>
<TE>   And that is mired in the Assembly, with Republicans and Democrats
disputing how best to plug a predicted $23.6-billion state deficit
for this year.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have championed the equalization bill, but oppose a
plan by Democrats to raise nearly $4 billion in new taxes and
revenues to help balance the state's books.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats also support equalization, but they say it is the whole
package or no deal. Gov. Gray Davis then must agree to sign it.</TE>
<TE>   Annual education budgets are tied to how much money the state has
and how much schools received the previous year. And this year's
budget is a work in progress. Since AB 3003 wouldn't kick in until
the following fiscal year, it's also unclear what effect earmarking
so hefty a sum for equalizing school funding would have on other
programs, which could receive less money.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a fixed pot of money,'' said Teri Burns, deputy
superintendent of government affairs for the state Department of
Education. "If they take $406 million from something for
equalization, whatever that something is is the loser."</TE>
<TE>   Which has left some districts feeling lukewarm about the bill.</TE>
<TE>   "If equalization was out there alone, we would support this bill,"
said Joseph Zeronian, Los Angeles Unified's chief financial officer.
"But it is up against a number of other things."</TE>
<TE>   In general, students in affluent suburban communities tend to
benefit more from it than urban or poor districts, partly because the
latter receive more supplemental funding aimed at aiding
disadvantaged students.</TE>
<TE>   Equalization does not mean every student would get a universal
rate of funding from the state. On top of basic per-student funding,
districts also get subsidies for specific programs.</TE>
<TE>   Overcrowded districts, for example, benefit from money for
class-size reduction. Rural districts receive more funding for
transportation needs.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming and other equalization proponents say they don't begrudge
such subsidies, but they want a level playing field when it comes to
essential funding for materials and teachers' salaries.</TE>
<TE>   "We could get an extra $2.5 to $3 million" under AB 3003, said
Vernon Medeiros, chief financial officer of the Irvine Unified School
District, which this year was forced to cut arts and music programs
for lack of funds. "We could do a lot with that money."</TE>
<TE>   "The state has to make a policy decision that a child in Beverly
Hills is worth the same as a child in Capistrano, the same as a child
in Compton, the same as a child in Sacramento," Fleming said.</TE>
<TE>   The reason California's children are "worth" different amounts of
education dollars is the result of decades of court cases, measures
and legislation that have produced one of the most convoluted school
funding mechanisms in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   In 1971, the state Supreme Court concluded that funding schools
with local property taxes was unfair because it put poor communities
with lower property values at a disadvantage.</TE>
<TE>   The court did not mandate an equal amount of funding for every
student, but did force richer districts to share their wealth.</TE>
<TE>   Districts in affluent communities such as San Juan Capistrano and
Irvine must share part of their property tax wealth, but have little
or no ability to raise taxes because of Proposition 13, the 1978
voter-approved measure that virtually capped property taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "That is grossly unfair," Fleming said. "We are tied to property
revenue from almost 30 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   The state has funded some equalization in the past, including $40
million last year, and the same amount is likely to pass this year in
a measure separate from the reform bill. AB 3003 would bring all
districts within 92% of the highest paid district, the narrowest gap
yet.</TE>
<TE>   However, amid the squabbling over the state budget, even ardent
proponents worry that the timing isn't right. "As passionate as I
feel about this issue," Fleming said, "I certainly hope it doesn't
become a deal-breaker that upsets the entire budget. The equalization
battle we can fight anytime."</TE>

<HD>Prostitute With HIV Faces Felony</HD>
<DH>Court: Believing that the system has done too little to
get an infected woman off the street, a deputy district attorney
presses for a nine-year sentence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN L. MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Growing up in South-Central Los Angeles, Lori-Ann Jones never crossed
paths with Panchita Hall.</LD>
<LD>   Jones went to Washington High School and Loyola Marymount
University, picked up a law degree in Sacramento and became a Los
Angeles County deputy district attorney.</LD>
<LD>   Hall got as far as a diploma from Manual Arts High, then became a
fixture on Figueroa Street--a career prostitute with an addiction to
crack cocaine.</LD>
<TE>   Hall, 46, has a rap sheet that stretches back to 1984. She was
found to be HIV-positive after a court-ordered test in 1995, but
continued soliciting and was convicted of prostitution six more
times.</TE>
<TE>   After her most recent arrest April 28, Hall's thick file landed on
Jones' desk in the Compton courthouse. The prosecutor, furious at
Hall's disregard for public health and the system's inability to stop
her, considered filing an unheard-of attempted murder charge</TE>
<TE>   "She doesn't care," Jones, 40, remembers thinking. "It's like
she's someone walking around with a loaded gun on her hip,
indiscriminately shooting people. She knows when she goes and stands
on the corner she could pass on the AIDS virus."</TE>
<TE>   Jones knew that no judge would let her file so severe a charge.
But she was determined to make a statement out of this case. So
today, when Hall appears at a pretrial hearing in Compton Superior
Court, Jones will refuse to plea bargain and press for an enhanced
sentence of up to nine years in prison--a striking contrast to the
normal bargain that often frees prostitutes after a few months.</TE>
<TE>   Prostitution is usually tried as a misdemeanor. But in Hall's
case, Jones filed felony charges, using a 1988 state law that
requires prostitutes who are HIV-positive and who have been informed
of their blood test results to be charged with a felony upon their
second arrest. Conviction carries a maximum three-year sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said she will ask for three times that much because the
criminal justice system has failed to sufficiently punish Hall during
her string of arrests for soliciting while infected.</TE>
<TE>   The law was first invoked in Los Angeles County in 1990 against a
male prostitute who was sentenced to two years in state prison.</TE>
<TE>   Tens of thousands of prostitutes have been tested for HIV in the
county as a result of the law, but only 216 have been convicted on a
felony charge since 1995, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Rarely does felony prosecution lead to a long sentence, however.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually they are [pleaded] out in some way," said Stuart Glovin,
head deputy in the Compton public defender's office. "Most of these
people who have a lifelong history of prostitution are desperate
people with no place to turn. It's not an occupation of choice--it's
more desperation than anything else."</TE>
<TE>   Jones began her career as a prosecutor more than a dozen years
ago, specializing in hard-core gang cases. One grisly example was the
1991 case of two reputed gang members who were found guilty of
attempted murder in the drive-by shooting of an 11-year-old girl
who--with a bullet lodged in her heart--carried her 2-year-old
brother to safety.</TE>
<TE>   Jones grew up near Vermont Avenue and 109th Street, not far from
the Figueroa corridor, which has been plagued by prostitution for
decades. When she speaks of her youth, she talks of her father, a
retired school police officer who pastored a neighborhood church. He
was wounded while on the job.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a survivor," she said. "When I was little, my dad would say
to me and my friends we could stay out but we had to be home before
the lights came on. We knew what to stay away from."</TE>
<TE>   Today, the mother of a 4-year-old boy handles conventional
criminal cases, working more regular hours and having more
flexibility over whether to file charges.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you get a guy down on his luck, stealing a razor blade,
a loaf of bread and a package of hot dogs," she said. "It's obvious
the guy needed something to eat and some personal hygiene."</TE>
<TE>   Jones felt no such compassion toward Hall. The arrest that caused
the women's paths to cross was made by an undercover policeman on a
task force targeting Figueroa-area prostitutes.</TE>
<TE>   Standing outside a motel on Figueroa at 95th Street, Hall
allegedly waved at the officer as he drove into the parking area.
After agreeing on a $10 fee, she was arrested on suspicion of
prostitution and carrying drug paraphernalia, police say.</TE>
<TE>   Last August, after her most recent prostitution conviction, Hall
was put on probation for four years. Two days before her April
arrest, a judge issued a warrant to bring her in: She had failed to
show up for a progress report and left a drug rehabilitation program
without permission.</TE>
<TE>   "The defendant's behavior places the community at large at risk,"
a probation officer's report concluded. "She is either unable or
unwilling to live a law-abiding lifestyle." The report recommended
that she be sentenced to state prison.</TE>
<TE>   Hall's mother said she told her daughter that she was crazy,
wasting her life.</TE>
<TE>   "She stays a year in jail, maybe six months, she gets out and then
she's back in jail again," said Virginia Hall, who lives in South Los
Angeles. "She goes to rehab, and when she gets out she's back on the
street. I don't know what to do."</TE>
<TE>   She said she would like to see her daughter, who has twice been
convicted of drug use, in a rehabilitation program. She visited her
last week at the Twin Towers jail, where Panchita has been in custody
since her arrest. Virginia, 69, gave her daughter $50.</TE>
<TE>   "She said she has been praying and reading the Bible," Virginia
Hall said. "I said, 'You always do that when you get incarcerated.
You have to do that when you come home.' "</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Hall said she moved to Los Angeles from New York City in
1960, feeling she would make a better life for herself and her
children. She lost contact with one son, and another son died. She
said she raised her daughter's son until he was 18 and that she is
now raising the son of another daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame," she said. "Rock cocaine has destroyed millions of
families and children."</TE>
<TE>   Zita Lazzarini, director of the Division of Medical Humanities,
Health Law and Ethics at the University of Connecticut, who is
studying the impact of criminal laws on HIV risk behavior, questions
the effectiveness of stiffer penalties.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we really spending money in the right place?" she asked. "How
effective are these laws when compared to other forms of
intervention?"</TE>
<TE>   The money used to arrest and jail Panchita Hall could be spent
more productively on treatment "for addicted HIV-positive sex
workers," Lazzarini said.</TE>
<TE>   AIDS Health Foundation President Michael Weinstein is less
sympathetic.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone who is turning tricks is having a large number of
partners and is likely spreading the virus," he said. "I don't think
it's unreasonable to use punitive measures. Some drug treatments such
as education have failed. I think that the government's first
responsibility is to protect the public health."</TE>
<TE>   For Jones, the vicious cycle of prostitution and drugs makes
prosecution an easy choice.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine the devastation. Women get pregnant. Babies get HIV. It
makes me angry," she said. "It's a cycle that nobody seems to care
that much about. And it's spreading and spreading and spreading."</TE>

<HD>State's Brightest Lawmakers Shine in 'Minnie' Spotlight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's high summer, but the state Legislature is just now getting its
report cards.</LD>
<LD>   The "Minnies," awarded by the California Journal on rankings made
by numbers of aides, legislators, lobbyists, administrators and the
press, are named for Minerva, the goddess of wisdom whose likeness
graces the state's great seal--and considering that this is the
Legislature we're talking about, some have said the resemblance ends
there.</LD>
<LD>   A few lawmakers are singled out for being smart--that category
used to be called "intelligent" but now it's called "quick study"--as
well as for four other qualities, with awards in each category and a
passel of honorable mentions, which is where the same 20 or so names
keep turning up as the A-list of legislative talent.</LD>
<TE>   Like the Emmys or the Oscars, some legislators do tend to sweep
the awards categories time after time. Unlike the Emmys or Oscars,
there are no acceptance speeches, and no Roberto Benigni-like walking
over the desks in the Senate or the Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Legislator of the year: Fred Keeley, the Democratic Boulder Creek
assemblyman and speaker pro tem, who's been at legislative ground
zero on energy, insurance scandals, and the budget, a "pragmatic
liberal" of whom a lobbyist said in ranking Keeley, "He's here for
the right reasons. He won't cave on issues. He carries big bills and
gets them passed."</TE>
<TE>   He is also termed out.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie of the year is Northridge Republican Keith Richman, a
physician who has cut himself an off-the-radar piece of health-care
turf to focus on, the uninsured. As one lobbyist told the polltakers,
Richman "forced the Democrats and the governor to deal with that
issue, and that was courageous." He is also the only person to date
to file fund-raising papers to run for mayor of a San Fernando Valley
city that doesn't exist. So far.</TE>
<TE>   The tops in integrity: In the state Senate, Coronado Democrat Dede
Alpert, giving her back-to-back wins in this category (Sweep! Sweep!)
The integrity award in the Assembly goes to rookie of the year
emeritus Darrell Steinberg, a Sacramento Democrat, of whom one
insider said, "His integrity is annoyingly intact at every moment of
the day." In the category of best problem-solvers, the envelope
please: In the Senate, it's Republican Jim Brulte of Rancho
Cucamonga, in a three-peat! Brulte was praised for knowing when to
pick a fight and how to get things done without beating his
considerable chest. In the Assembly--wait, Darrell Steinberg wins
again! He was praised as a great mediator who knows how to stay the
course on an issue.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature's 24/7 hard-working crowd is topped by worker bees
Joe Dunn, a Democratic senator from Santa Ana, who "never seems to
slack off," and, once again, Fred Keeley, the energetic energy point
man who burns a lot of midnight oil--so much that one insider wrote,
"I think he's been cloned."</TE>
<TE>   For potential, look to Joe Dunn, again, and Santa Monica Democrat
Sheila Kuehl, a front-runner for Senate president pro tem.... And on
the other side of the Capitol, Long Beach's Jenny Oropeza, a rookie
who took the job as head of the budget committee and "identified the
end game right away."</TE>
<TE>   And as for that category formerly known as intelligence, the
third-time winner is Sheila Kuehl, given a back-handed compliment by
an apparent Republican as "a dangerous liberal because she's smart
and works the system." And the Assembly's quick study is--come back
on stage here--Fred Keeley.</TE>
<TE>   Good work, everyone, but it still won't get you into the Vanity
Fair Oscar party.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon Won't Run for Valley's Mayor</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar), who made the Journal's list
of legislators "seen as tarnished," has said he won't run for mayor
of a San Fernando Valley city, even if one does exist, and some
secessionists figured it was just a deal to keep anti-secession labor
unions on his side so he could try for another job.</TE>
<TE>   Could that other job be lieutenant governor, in four years' time?
In classic pol-speak, Alarcon did say people have, uh, approached
him, but he has not decided, and anyway there was no deal with unions
to skip the Valley job in exchange for a later-round draft at
something bigger and better.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Contreras of the County Federation of Labor said there was
no quid pro quo, but Alarcon "will get a lot of support from us,
whatever he does."</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon demurred. "I have not focused a lot of attention" on the
lieutenant governor's election four years away. Instead, Alarcon
said, he is concentrating on his own November reelection. How much
concentrating can it take? He's running unopposed.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Gives Ice Cream a Taste of Milk Campaign</TE>
<TE>   The big butter-and-egg men are at work in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   A bill Gov. Gray Davis signed last week extends that snappy
generic marketing campaign by the California Milk Advisory
Board--most famously the "It's the cheese" campaign that's giving
them sleepless nights in Wisconsin--to include ice cream made with
California milk. Bakersfield Republican Assemblyman Roy Ashburn's
bill also greenlights the milk board on offering coupons past the old
Jan. 1 cutoff date.</TE>
<TE>   We're talking ad hall of fame time here; California put into the
consumer lexicon such phrases as "A can a week is all we ask,"
created by the Almond Board of California, and the deathless, now
nationally renowned line, originated by the California Fluid Milk
Processors Board, "Got milk?"</TE>
<TE>   As for the eggs part:</TE>
<TE>   Assembly GOP leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks launched the third week
of the stuck-budget process by getting peeved with Gray Davis for
trying to peel off some GOP votes to get his spending plan approved,
rather than negotiating upfront with GOP leaders.</TE>
<TE>   David did the same thing last year to get a budget, prompting Cox
to remark that, like a farm dog, Davis had developed a bad habit:
"Once you allow a dog to get into the henhouse and suck the eggs, you
can't cure a dog from sucking eggs. So when in fact you do that once,
you believe that's the model for doing it again. That's what's
transpired here."</TE>
<TE>   Apropos of this lesson in the politics of animal husbandry, Davis
spokesman Steve Maviglio was asked whether the governor prefers brown
eggs or white: "He likes them done--like the budget."</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger Eyes the Governor's Seat</TE>
<TE>   It's four blessed years before the next governor's race, but the
name of good-guy movie brute Arnold Schwarzenegger has already been
bruited about as Republican governor material. At a breakfast meeting
of some 15 GOP state governors, he said he had thought about taking
on Gray Davis this year, but the movie work had gotten in the way.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something that I'm still interested in [for the future. It
gives me the greatest satisfaction--much more than going down another
red carpet to do a movie premiere: to go and create after-school
programs, help special Olympians, inspire kids to stay away from
drugs and gangs."</TE>
<TE>   He's now filming sequels to two films, reprising roles as a CIA
spy and an all-powerful cyborg, so it isn't much of a leap to imagine
himself as governor.</TE>
<TE>   Gray Davis, whose staff would point out that he served as a
captain in Vietnam, even if he didn't play one on TV, did list some
of his small-screen credits last week at a banquet speech in
Universal City, pointing out how California is indeed the land of
opportunities (and the pitfalls of typecasting): "I was too dull and
boring to be governor, but I worked hard. And I went on Jay Leno, not
once, but twice."</TE>
<TE>   CD Aims to Keep L.A. United Through Song</TE>
<TE>   As you read here, Los Angeles' Service Employees International
Union has assembled a CD of bring-us-together songs in opposition of
the San Fernando Valley secession ("Breaking Up is Hard to Do,"
"Stay"). An "Inside Politics" reader reminds us that 47 years ago,
Gogi Grant recorded a song called "Suddenly There's a Valley."</TE>
<TE>   For the Valley, which lists "Camelot" as an official ballot choice
of a name, should it secede, this sounds like the makings of an
official civic tune:</TE>
<TE>   When you think there's no bright tomorrow</TE>
<TE>   And you feel you can't try again</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly there's a valley</TE>
<TE>   Where love and hope begin.</TE>
<TE>   But there's another verse that makes it clear this is not about
the San Fernando Valley, except perhaps in history books:</TE>
<TE>   Touched only by the seasons</TE>
<TE>   Swept clean by the waving grain</TE>
<TE>   Surveyed by a happy bluebird</TE>
<TE>   And kissed by the falling rain.</TE>
<TE>   Not.</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * With his wife, Michelle, California GOP party chairman Shawn
Steel, one of the generals in the internal strife in the Golden
State's GOP, co-hosts a Saturday fund-raiser, "Women With Simon," an
event for that husband-and-wife team in the governor's race, Bill and
Cindy Simon. But no Carly Simon.</TE>
<TE>   * Former Republican Assembly speaker Curt Pringle of Garden Grove
won't be keeping his spot as First Corn Dog on the Orange County Fair
Board, but Gov. Gray Davis, whose grace-and-favor job this is, did
let him stay on through the end of the fair, until July 28.</TE>
<TE>   * Attorneys general from 11 states, including California, have
delivered a letter to President George Bush, criticizing him for not
adopting a comprehensive global warming policy and asking him to
reconsider what he'll do about climate change. They also ask the
president to put a cap on greenhouse gases.</TE>

<HD>Talking Up the Hidden Side of Chinatown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Teenage tour guide Gloria Chan stands on a street corner in this
city's bustling Chinatown and offers an unvarnished history of the
community her generation knows as "C-Town."</LD>
<LD>   She motions to a nearby grade school, explaining with a wince that
it was founded in the 1880s as the "Oriental School," back when many
San Franciscans didn't want their children associating with "Asians
and Mongolians," who were thought to be dirty disease carriers.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm sorry, but that upsets me," she says. "I'm Asian. And I'm
very clean. I have good hygiene. How could they get away with that?"</LD>
<TE>   Three times a week, the 17-year-old Chan leads a 90-minute walking
tour that's equal parts personal history and social commentary. Along
with a handful of fellow Chinese American teens, she offers tourists
and business groups the other history of Chinatown--reciting
transgressions and peccadilloes suffered by her ancestors who settled
in the area 150 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   With insights drawn from family stories and research, they stroll
the labyrinth of Chinatown, pointing out landmarks not discussed
elsewhere. And they dispel such stereotypes that area alleyways are
dangerous or that all Chinese people are martial arts experts. And
that Asians are a passive people afraid to fight for their rights in
America.</TE>
<TE>   At a cost of $8 a head, the Chinatown Alleyway Tours are part of a
program sponsored by a local nonprofit organization to raise money to
clean up area alleys. Through their tour-guide monologues, these
interns also learn something about themselves and their culture.</TE>
<TE>   In a city that's 30% Chinese--with one of the world's largest
populations of Chinese-speaking residents outside China--the teens
engage in a cultural tug of war.</TE>
<TE>   Many are the first generation of immigrant families to feel more
American than Chinese. Though their parents often don't speak
English, they live in a fast-paced world of pop culture, drugs and
social pressures.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many others, Diana Pang didn't have to travel to Europe or
Asia to investigate her family's cultural roots. All the Bayview-area
resident had to do was board a city bus to Chinatown.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm undergoing an identity crisis," says the 18-year-old.
"There's just this huge generation gap between me and my parents.
They don't understand me. I don't understand them. This is the way
I'm reaching out to them. By digging up their roots."</TE>
<TE>   Cultural Connection</TE>
<TE>   Started in 2001, the alleyway tours give many guides a renewed
cultural identity as Chinese Americans, coordinators say.</TE>
<TE>   "They see adults listening to what they have to say--their take on
some uncomfortable cultural moments," says Jane Kim, an organizer for
the Chinatown Community Development Center.</TE>
<TE>   None of the teens or their parents live in Chinatown anymore.
Although for generations many arriving immigrant families have first
landed there, most eventually relocate to more upscale communities,
returning only to visit relatives.</TE>
<TE>   But these eight teens ignored criticism--even from Asian American
friends--to return to the old neighborhood to volunteer to clean
streets, care for the elderly and lead the tours.</TE>
<TE>   "They've come back to embrace a community they've been taught to
be ashamed of," says Kim. "For many, Chinatown has a reputation of
being touristy and dirty, a place where people spit on the streets
and elderly old women push you around. Their friends say, 'That's
disgusting! Why would you want to walk through there?' "</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Wong was led back to Chinatown by omissions in her high
school American history books. "There's wasn't one word about the
social struggles faced by Asian Americans," says the 18-year-old.
"Just a few lines about how the Chinese came here to build the
railroad. That wasn't enough."</TE>
<TE>   City officials understand such anger. "Many historic sites are
important because they show the pain of the past," says San Francisco
Convention and Visitors Bureau spokeswoman Laurie Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   Added Rose Pak, a consultant for the Chinese Chamber of Commerce:
"These kids are telling uncomfortable truths. I've gone on the
commercial Chinatown tours and they're worse--all they talk about are
brothels and opium dens. They make me cringe."</TE>
<TE>   The alleyway tours feature a combination of polished oratory and
the "ums," "likes" and "you knows" you might expect from teenagers.
Meeting in Portsmouth Square, the brick and concrete public park
considered the social heart of Chinatown, the tours wander through
half a dozen alleyways, each of which has played a role in
neighborhood history.</TE>
<TE>   View From the Alley</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, the guides--each of whom has an alley or two of
expertise--cover the standard tourist fare: They explain how
residents have long used the alleys as shortcuts to avoid the
neighborhood's jampacked main drags and how each carries both an
English name and one of Chinese significance. They show the spots
where crowded fish markets once thrived and where women hung their
bok choy out to dry.</TE>
<TE>   Their allusions are also more modern. Pang tells how one alley
appeared on a recent album cover of the rock group Green Day.</TE>
<TE>   And guide Tim Ho explains why the street numbers are often
nonsequential: because residents have often changed them to suit
their feng shui, or Chinese spiritual chi. He shows off the nation's
first fortune cookie company and explains how Spofford Alley was a
popular backdrop for Hollywood movies a few generations back because
the shorter door frames made insecure actors look taller.</TE>
<TE>   The guides explain that Chinatown is America's most densely
populated place after New York's Manhattan. The area has a limit on
building heights to preserve the little sunlight that permeates the
narrow alleyways. And Portsmouth Square is always crowded with
elderly Chinese men and women, they say, because many live in cramped
single-room-occupancy apartments with little light, so the park for
many has become "Chinatown's living room."</TE>
<TE>   It's all part of Chinatown's often-unpretty back story--how past
exclusionary immigration laws kept Chinese women from immigrating to
America; only their husbands were wanted, to work as laborers.</TE>
<TE>   "The Chinese have always been made to feel like visitors in
Chinatown," Chan says. "We've been disconnected from the community at
large by stereotypes. This is our way of taking back the streets."</TE>
<TE>   But the fight has never been easy. Guides tell how wealthy
neighbors fought Chinatown's low-income housing, saying it would
lower property values. And how a hotel built a concrete pedestrian
bridge that casts a shadow over Portsmouth Square.</TE>
<TE>   "Chinatown didn't want this bridge," Wong says. "They say we can't
even use it to watch our annual parade. It's private property."</TE>
<TE>   The tour impressed customer Megan Ybarra: "This isn't any speeding
tour bus. These are young people with real roots to this
neighborhood. They're saying 'C'mon in. Welcome to our home.' "</TE>
<TE>   As she leads a group down an alley shaded by trees, Chan beams:
"That's cool, huh? We got some pretty wild stuff in Chinatown."</TE>
<TE>   Before they return home to the suburbs, the teenage tour guides
admit their exploits have even opened doors at home.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom would never say she's proud to my face--that's not the
Chinese way," Wong says. "But I can hear her on the phone, bragging
about her daughter the Chinatown tour guide."</TE>

<HD>Tree Boards Cut No Slack</HD>
<DH>Landscaping: Pruning restrictions result in stiff fines,
even for unwitting violators.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A month after moving into her new Calabasas home, Carolyn Scharg
stood before the city's tree board, facing as much as $40,000 in
mitigation fees. Her offense: cutting a few branches off an oak tree
without a permit.</LD>
<LD>   Scharg argued before the board that she was unaware of the city
ordinance that requires a permit to cut or remove any indigenous oak
in Calabasas. She said she never saw warning signs and cut the
branches only to protect the roof of her new home.</LD>
<LD>   She was fined $10,000 for the tree trimming, which she said has
also cost her many hours of lost sleep. The fine could balloon to
$40,000 if the tree does not survive.</LD>
<TE>   "It's nothing personal," said Kay Greeley, the city's arborist and
consultant for the tree board. "It's all about the oaks."</TE>
<TE>   The city's five-member tree board meets once a month to hear cases
of people who mistakenly cut the city- and state-protected scrub oaks
and other oak trees.</TE>
<TE>   Some people, such as construction crews and developers, pay a
permit fee and are ordered to plant new oaks. Others, like Scharg,
find themselves facing thousands of dollars in fines for their
actions.</TE>
<TE>   Calabasas is one of a growing number of Southern California cities
with citizen tree boards. Some boards, such as those in Calabasas,
Riverside and Claremont, have become a major part of city government,
advising city planners on beautification projects, amendments to city
ordinances and penalties for those who harm trees.</TE>
<TE>   Landscape attorney Randall Stamen calls it the "the greening of
California."</TE>
<TE>   "Trees are an asset to a city," said Stamen, a certified arborist
who recently left the tree board in Riverside. "It's a
quality-of-life issue.</TE>
<TE>   "Tree committees permit citizens to directly shape a city's policy
regarding the trees which grow in a city's parks and along its
streets," he said. "They also help prevent mayors and city council
people from being overwhelmed by tree issues."</TE>
<TE>   Stamen, who as a tree board member assisted urban planners in
making decisions on planting and protecting Riverside's 60,000 trees,
said he is delighted that more cities are taking an interest.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to see more citizens taking an active part in keeping
their cities beautiful," he said. "It doesn't just show that they
care about their city, but it shows that they care about the
environment."</TE>
<TE>   Eric Oldar, the state urban forestry coordinator for the
California Department of Forestry in Riverside, said that while he
has seen an increase in community volunteer programs, he also has
noticed decreases in city-run tree departments.</TE>
<TE>   Communities lacking tree boards often don't encourage community
input because they are limited by budgets or staffing from responding
to complaints or suggestions, he said.</TE>
<TE>   At least 128 California cities with some form of citizen advisory
board are classified as a "Tree City USA," according to a national
organization that tracks and commends arbor-friendly cities.</TE>
<TE>   To be so designated, a city must also have a tree-care ordinance,
a community forestry program with a minimum annual budget of $2 per
capita and observe Arbor Day, according to Tina Schweitzer,
coordinator of Tree City USA, a nonprofit affiliate of the National
Arbor Day Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The number of municipalities nationwide with the "Tree City USA"
designation has increased from 42 in 1976 to 2,776 last year, she
said, adding that the number is growing by about 150 a year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just the small, rural cities," Schweitzer said. "It's
cities with larger populations."</TE>
<TE>   Some cities, like San Diego, Huntington Beach and Diamond Bar,
just created a community advisory board within the last year or two,
she said, while others, like Burbank, Sacramento and Claremont, have
had tree advisory boards for more than 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a tree board before we had a city council," said Mark
Hodnick, Claremont's urban forest manager. "In 1887, we had a group
of citizens who would care for the trees in the area."</TE>
<TE>   While Claremont's seven-member community services commission is
involved in many civic activities, its main priority is ensuring that
the city's 23,000 street trees are not harmed.</TE>
<TE>   "The city plants the trees," Hodnick said about the 112 different
varieties of street trees. "The homeowner is just supposed to water
them. We have our trees on a database, so if any work is done, we'll
know.</TE>
<TE>   Hodnick said the fines "can be pretty pricey to trim one of the
city's trees and [they] get higher if the trimming continues.</TE>
<TE>   "We call it our three-limbs-and-you're-out law."</TE>
<TE>   In a case yet to be decided, a Claremont business owner faces a
$17,000 fine for cutting down city-owned tulip and carob trees, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   A citizen advisory board works closely with Burbank's parks and
recreation and forestry departments to determine what parts of the
city may need additional trees. In the spring, Civic Pride, another
volunteer organization, helps with tree planting.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Los Angeles city nor county has a tree board, but the city
formed a Community Forest Advisory Committee in 1993. The group makes
policy recommendations to the Board of Public Works concerning the
urban forest, specifically about tree selection, planting and care.</TE>
<TE>   The committee helps city agencies involved in tree maintenance to
analyze forestry programs and foster community support and
preservation of the more than 680,000 trees in Los Angeles, according
to city officials. In Calabasas, Scharg has pleaded before the city's
tree board, City Council, city attorney and city manager to reduce
her fine. "I don't think I should be defending myself like a
criminal," she said at a council meeting last month.</TE>
<TE>   Scharg said she and her husband, Scott, who moved to Calabasas
from Michigan, never heard of the tree ordinance. They never saw any
warning signs about the law and were never informed by their real
estate agent, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tree board members said the law is mentioned at city events and in
city newsletters and they have started an advertising campaign to
inform the public and new homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   "People who live here and are active in the community know about
the ordinance," said Councilman Michael Harrison, a founding member
of the tree board. "Others find out inadvertently by violating the
ordinance. Ignorance is no excuse."</TE>
<TE>   The city law covers three types of oaks--coast live oaks, valley
oaks and scrub oaks--because of their historic, aesthetic and
ecological values, Harrison said. The Calabasas tree board plans to
expand the law to include other indigenous trees.</TE>
<TE>   Other jurisdictions, including Los Angeles County, have similar
laws regarding oak trees and other species.</TE>
<TE>   The county's oak tree ordinance, in effect since September 1998 in
all unincorporated areas, states: "A person shall not cut, destroy,
remove, relocate, inflict damage or encroach into the protected zone
of any tree of the oak tree genus without first obtaining a permit."</TE>
<TE>   Calabasas tree board member Helene Regen, who helped write her
city's ordinance protecting oak trees, said the tough attitude is
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people do not care about ecology and the environment," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to educate the public that these trees are our community.
We have to protect them."</TE>

<CX>   Tree boards--A story in Monday's California section about community
tree boards did not make clear that the oak tree whose branches were
cut by Carolyn and Scott Scharg of Calabasas is on their neighbor's
property, not their own. Also, the article referred to "fines" paid
by individuals who cut or remove indigenous oak without permission.
The story should have made clear that those are mitigation fees that
go toward the cost of saving trees that have been damaged by
unauthorized cutting and vary depending on the cost. In the case
reported on, that cost could be between $10,000 and $40,000.</CX>

<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis has pocketed political money from some of the
biggest, baddest names in the corporate corruption scandals.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom $109,000. Adelphia $52,500. Enron $120,000. Global
Crossing execs $120,050. Arthur Andersen and its parent $54,000.</LD>
<TE>   Does anybody care?</TE>
<TE>   Republican rival Bill Simon Jr. has been hammered politically for
using offshore tax shelters that the Internal Revenue Service
contends may be illegal. Davis, it turns out, received $86,500 from
the accounting firm that recommended the shelters. The firm, KPMG
LLP, is being sued by the IRS.</TE>
<TE>   Other rich businessmen who used the shelters are major Davis
bankrollers. They include Maurice Marciano, CEO of clothier Guess?,
$125,000, and Richard J. Heckmann, former chairman of U.S. Filter
Corp., $40,000.</TE>
<TE>   Times reporter Dan Morain dug up this donor data and laid it on my
desk. Does it interest anybody? Should it?</TE>
<TE>   Simon's political sin, after all, has been refusing to release his
tax returns, thereby inviting the question: What else is he hiding?</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Davis isn't hiding anything, says Garry South, the
governor's political strategist. Davis released his tax returns. The
law requires him to report his campaign contributions. They're out
there, South notes, "for everyone to see and make whatever they want
to of them.... They're subject to a lot of interpretation."</TE>
<TE>   Yes they are.</TE>
<TE>   One question that Davis invites is why doesn't he return the money
given him by some of his more smelly donors, like WorldCom and Enron.
Many politicians have. When asked about keeping Enron's offerings,
Davis said the energy company was the bad actor; why reward it with
money.</TE>
<TE>   But the governor did return $25,000 that Oracle gave him days
after it signed a no-bid, overpriced, $95-million software contract
with his administration. That donation was too odorous, fueling the
perception that political money sways Davis policy.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Capitol lobbyists believe they must "pay to play."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a commonly accepted theory that with this administration,
the more you give the better you're treated," says one government
relations consultant.</TE>
<TE>   There are too many suspicious examples to flatly reject the
notion:</TE>
<TE>   * Davis signed legislation during the growing budget crisis to
give prison guards a 34%, $1-billion pay raise by 2006. He also
fulfilled their wish by proposing to close five private prisons.
Weeks later, the guards union gave him $251,000--on top of $411,000
they already had donated or raised for his campaign. In 1998, they
spent $2.3 million on his election.</TE>
<TE>   * The governor was in the Capitol discussing education policy with
leaders of the California Teachers Assn. when he suddenly blurted: "I
need $1 million from you guys." Nobody responded, but he apparently
was seeking a repeat of their 1998 generosity when they kicked in
$1.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   The list is long.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's going to accuse Davis of saying, 'Give me the money or I
won't do this,' " says political reformer Bob Stern, president of the
Center for Governmental Studies. "It's more the fear that if you
don't give him the money, no telling what he might do. And I'm sure
he cultivates that."</TE>
<TE>   Davis is an obsessive money grubber who says he's merely
protecting himself from super-rich, self-financed rivals. As of June
30, he had $31.6 million stashed.</TE>
<TE>   Do voters sniff a stench? Sure.</TE>
<TE>   A Field poll 18 months ago found that two-thirds of Californians
believed that Davis was influenced by campaign money. A recent Field
survey showed him with a negative job performance rating: 41%
approval, 49% disapproval.</TE>
<TE>   The two are linked. It was Davis' initial handling of the energy
crisis that caused his job rating to plummet. But it's the
"integrity" issue that keeps the rating negative.</TE>
<TE>   Is the stench strong enough to repel voters from Davis in
November? Enough to elect Simon? Probably not yet. (Davis leads by 7
points in the Field poll.)</TE>
<TE>   "The simple truth is that most voters think all of us in the
political process are corrupt. It's an eye-roller," says Democratic
consultant Darry Sragow. "My advice always is to take the money
because if you don't, you're broke."</TE>
<TE>   Simon strategist Sal Russo says the voters' "esteem" for Davis is
lowered by his incessant money soliciting. But its impact on their
voting, he adds, will hinge on the size and reaction of two groups:
angry "lovers scorned" who think he has taken corporate money and
sold out the liberal agenda, and mainstreamers who believe he's
preoccupied with fund-raising and has neglected his job.</TE>
<TE>   Ferocious fund-raising is Davis' biggest strength and it's also
his biggest weakness.</TE>
<TE>   He's got money to attack Simon on TV about tax returns and
business ventures. He knows that to win, this must be a Davis vs.
Simon race. If it's the good Davis vs. the bad Davis, Davis loses.</TE>

<HD>Programmer's 'ChessBrain' Is Learning All the Right Moves</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Bugzilla and Venomous slug it out, an intense but soft-spoken
computer programmer watches from his apartment in Newbury Park.</LD>
<LD>   Carlos Justiniano has nine computers arrayed on a table in front
of his four-poster bed. Sleeping just four hours a night, he pours
himself into his fast-growing pet project--a globe-girdling network
of computers that he hopes will one day play killer chess.</LD>
<LD>   He says it will be the largest chess computer network ever. But
more than that, it will be a resource for universities, a playground
for researchers in artificial intelligence. Like IBM's storied Deep
Blue, it will take on the world's best chess players; unlike Deep
Blue, Justiniano says, it will learn from its mistakes.</LD>
<TE>   The task is daunting. The total of possible moves in a typical
chess game is the kind of glaze-inducing number ordinarily used to
describe distances between solar systems--10 followed by 43 zeros,
according to some mathematicians. In 1997, Deep Blue succeeded in
humbling chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov, but, despite a number of
efforts, no dedicated band of brainy volunteers has created a network
that can rival it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just huge," said Justiniano, 37. "The only way to do it is
to find the time."</TE>
<TE>   During the day, he works as chief software architect at a Moorpark
industrial controls firm. At night he dines with his wife, Karla,
plays with 5-year-old daughter Kaitlyn and in the wee hours fires up
his computers for work on his burgeoning network, ChessBrain
(www.chessbrain.net).</TE>
<TE>   Via the Internet, more than 300 enthusiasts in 25 countries have
volunteered to help, each downloading a program that dedicates a tiny
fraction of their computing power to the cause. While the "node
operators" are sending e-mails to their friends or looking up recipes
on the Internet, a small subconscious piece of their computers
silently drifts to an Internet chess site, where it observes games in
progress.</TE>
<TE>   While Deep Blue was a single, blazing-fast computer, ChessBrain is
an example of "distributed computing"--a system that draws power from
a network of machines. It is being used in efforts as varied as
solving math puzzles and scanning the universe for signs of life.</TE>
<TE>   One recent day, the player who calls himself Bugzilla was wiping
out the one who goes by Venomous. Justiniano's network focused on
their game, analyzing moves smart and stupid, strategies grand and
pathetic. Like minuscule bits of brain food, some 1 million positions
are observed and ingested by ChessBrain in a typical day. Since the
project started a few months ago, more than 39 million positions have
been processed in a central computer.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes well, ChessBrain will itself start to play later this
year, taking on the likes of Bugzilla with the help of a
sophisticated chess program. Eventually, Justiniano envisions
researchers conducting experiments on the network and developing
programs capable of instantly scrutinizing their past mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a virtual storehouse will hold all the moves from the
games ChessBrain will have played with both fallible humans and
clever machines.</TE>
<TE>   How well it plays isn't even the point, said Justiniano. As the
hundreds of ChessBrain computers grow into thousands of
ever-more-powerful machines, the play will improve. But more
importantly, he said, so will the network's ability to mull over its
losses and pull winning strategies from the wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   "Deep Blue had no idea what it was doing," he said. "It had an
immense volume of stored information. It was fed every game Kasparov
ever played in tournaments. It had grandmasters and chess consultants
saying: 'This is how you can beat Kasparov.' This is very different
from a machine that learns as it plays."</TE>
<TE>   Justiniano's goal is audacious, according to experts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful idea, but it poses some real technical
challenges," said Andy Prince, a spokesman for United Devices, an
Austin, Texas, company that harnesses distributed computing systems
for complex problems in fields like finance and drug research.</TE>
<TE>   Situations in chess are so complex that they may not be broken
down into parts simple enough for hundreds or thousands of computers
to handle efficiently, he said.</TE>
<TE>   And machine learning is still a relatively new field.</TE>
<TE>   "Deep Blue definitely didn't learn, but I'd be skeptical that his
[network] will be learning anything but some trivial things," said
Monty Newborn, a computer science professor at McGill University in
Montreal who organized the first match between Kasparov and Deep
Blue.</TE>
<TE>   "People have tried to get computers to learn, but with only
mediocre success," Newborn said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Hyatt, creator of a program that twice won world computer
chess championships, agreed that getting a computer to learn the way
even the dullest student does--much less "an electronic Bobby
Fischer"--is a long way off. However, he said, a network like
ChessBrain, with its potentially formidable computing power, could be
a useful tool for researchers.</TE>
<TE>   "The field is wide open," said Hyatt, who teaches computer science
at the University of Alabama. "There could be a lot of simultaneous
experiments on it that deal with machine learning."</TE>
<TE>   That, Justiniano said, is exactly what he wants.</TE>
<TE>   So far he has poured more than $30,000 into the project--money
that could have been used toward a down payment on a family home. He
said he doesn't intend to make a dime on ChessBrain, but hopes it
will enhance his professional reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "I could get a house and do what normal people do," he said, "or
take an incredible risk. I'm shooting for something very large."</TE>

<HD>El Toro Plan: Park--or No Park?</HD>
<DH>Irvine and the Navy this week reveal how auction of the
closed base will proceed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fate of the closed El Toro Marine Corps Air Station should become
clearer Tuesday as officials with the Navy and Irvine gather at the
base to unveil plans to auction the land for development.</LD>
<LD>   The joint news conference also should reveal how far the city has
retreated from its promise of a vast public park at El Toro, which
helped sway voters to ground Orange County's plans for an
international airport.</LD>
<LD>   Fueled by a multimillion-dollar ad campaign, voters in March
approved Measure W, which rezoned the base for parkland, educational
uses and some low-level building. A day later, the Navy announced it
would sell the property. Irvine took over planning for the base in
April, but the city isn't bound by the March vote.</LD>
<TE>   Dan Jung, Irvine's director of strategic planning, had little more
to offer last week about what ultimately might become of El Toro
other than what the city has said all along: Trust us.</TE>
<TE>   "We think [the land-use plan] is consistent with Measure W and the
Navy's desire to sell the base," he said. "I think [people] will be
pleased."</TE>
<TE>   Since April, the city has shared little about what might happen at
the 4,700-acre base. About 1,000 acres will stay in federal hands as
a wildlife sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   Discussions have been held behind closed doors. Representatives
from a coalition of South County cities that fought the airport
weren't invited, nor were county officials--although the base remains
under county control.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tom Wilson, whose district encompasses South County,
said he asked for a preview of Irvine's plan but got nothing. "It's
disappointing they don't want to share with anyone," Wilson said.
"It's not for lack of asking. We'll have to give them the benefit of
the doubt that they're truly working in the spirit of Measure W."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine's public face for the last two years has been its Great
Park plan: an ambitious blueprint for sports fields, rolling hills,
vast meadows, a central lake and a western branch of the Smithsonian.
The city spent $8.5 million developing and promoting the Great Park,
according to city invoices--$5.7 million of which went to consultants
who sent maps and mailers to households across Orange County before
the vote.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear how much parkland will remain. Tuesday's announcement
will include proposed zoning for up to six parcels to be auctioned
through the General Services Agency, Jung said. He declined to say
what the zoning will be. Navy officials have repeatedly said that
they will not give any land to the city for parks.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime government activist Shirley Grindle of Orange, who
opposed the planned airport, said Irvine officials apparently decided
what can be built at the closed base although the city hasn't annexed
the property or completed a required environmental review.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm wondering why the residents of Irvine aren't challenging this
process, which in the long run will determine land uses for a chunk
of property that will affect not only them but people in surrounding
communities," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we going to have to face the fact that Irvine may have pulled
a ruse on the public by making one deal with voters and another
behind closed doors with the Navy? Maybe people in Irvine will start
to care what happens [at El Toro] when they start getting all the
traffic. They may have won the battle but lost the war."</TE>
<TE>   Several other airport opponents said that although a large urban
park may never be built, neither will the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine's current posture toward El Toro is rooted in the Navy's
unexpected sale announcement in March. That obliterated the city's
hopes of getting the base free of charge--as its many mailers had
suggested. The city began trying to salvage what it could of its
promise for public lands.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine now intends to offer density bonuses if developers turn
over some land for parks and pay a share of building and maintenance
costs.</TE>

<HD>Getting the Drop on Safety</HD>
<DH>County fair: From rides to first aid, organizers strive to
keep the public out of harm's way. Still, many thrill seekers can
overdo on corn dogs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jesse Kallus has an interesting job at the Orange County Fair: Every
morning he falls 13 stories into a net to assure ride operators that
the same trip is safe for customers.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a very scary experience," said Kallus, 22, an employee of
Total Throw Rider Inc., which operates the fair's Adrenaline Drop
ride. It offers thrill seekers an 85-foot free fall from the top of a
metal tower into the safety of a mesh net below.</LD>
<LD>   "I could probably do this a hundred times and it would still make
me scream and laugh hysterically," Kallus said. "You always think
something could go wrong--it wakes you up better than coffee."</LD>
<TE>   His daily test drop is part of the fair's focus on safety, an
effort fair officials say has resulted in an excellent safety record.
"We don't want to put our passengers somewhere we don't want them to
be," said Barry Schnaible, a private consultant hired to oversee ride
safety. "We don't want any of our guests leaving this place in an
ambulance."</TE>
<TE>   Toward that end, the fair--which runs through Sunday--has adopted
a number of measures designed to help ensure patrons' safety. For
starters, Schnaible inspects each ride as it enters the fairgrounds
on wheels and during its assembly before opening day. In addition, he
makes daily rounds to randomly reinspect and ensure compliance with
safety regulations.</TE>
<TE>   And Howard Hilliard, safety coordinator for Ray Commack Shows,
which provides the fair's rides and entertainment, requires each ride
operator to submit a daily report based on a morning inspection.
Additionally, he said, the company requires drug testing of all ride
attendants and offers them extra hours of training.</TE>
<TE>   "We take a proactive stance," Hilliard said of the company's
safety-promoting efforts.</TE>
<TE>   On the state regulatory end, all carnival rides are inspected and
certified annually. In addition, said Dean Fryer, a spokesman for
Cal/OSHA's Department of Industrial Relations, which oversees
amusement rides, state inspectors make random spot checks throughout
the year, including one during this year's setup at the Orange County
Fair.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, fair and state officials say, the Orange County Fair
has a stellar safety record. "I think it's very safe," Fryer said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, neither of the two fatalities at the fair that officials
can recall involved passengers on rides. Two years ago, a 63-year-old
man died of a heart attack while dancing at the fair's popular Blues
and Brews Club. And in 1992, a carnival worker was electrocuted while
attempting to repair a ride.</TE>
<TE>   Temporary venues like county fairs tend to be safer than permanent
amusement parks, Fryer said. "The people who set them up and take
them down are also looking at all the parts to make sure they aren't
worn," he said. "There are more frequent opportunities to review the
inner operations of a ride, and repairs can be made as they are
assembled or disassembled."</TE>
<TE>   Permanent amusement park rides, on the other hand, are generally
inspected only once a year by state regulators. And even that has
been required only since 2000 in the wake of several fatal accidents
at amusement parks, Fryer said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Orange County Fair is not free of accidents. Last year,
according to Judy Davison, an administrative services officer in
charge of the fair's first-aid station, 2,624 of the estimated
845,000 fairgoers required some sort of medical attention, including
611 who needed "more than a Band-Aid or a casual look at something."</TE>
<TE>   The most common complaints, Davison said, were headaches, blisters
and sunburns; the more serious cases generally involved pre-existing
conditions, including a diabetic who'd had too much to drink. As far
as the rides go, it's upset stomachs. "The most serious problem on
rides," she said, "is that they've eaten three corn dogs before
getting on and then they throw up."</TE>
<TE>   Kallus generally avoids eating corn dogs before making his morning
ascent to the top of the 135-foot tower from whence he hurls
screaming.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know anyone who's ever gotten used to this," he says.
"We've never had a bad thing happen, but I don't look forward to
it--not this early in the morning."</TE>
<TE>   And how does his family back in Lake Charles, La., view his choice
of employment?</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone thinks I'm crazy," Kallus admits.</TE>

<HD>Topanga Fire Plan Isn't Flying</HD>
<DH>Safety: Canyon residents want two 'Super Scoopers,' but
officials prefer other equipment and don't want the firefighting
aircraft--even for free.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZANTO PEABODY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fire question in brushy Topanga Canyon parrots the earthquake
question throughout Southern California: not whether the Big One will
come, but when. Moreover, what can be done about it?</LD>
<LD>   Some residents are offering an answer to the second part of the
question: They are seeking private funds to buy two $22-million
firefighting "Super Scooper" airplanes, which they would then donate
to the county.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles County Fire Department and Board of Supervisors
say they don't want the planes and that there are more effective ways
to fight fires in the Santa Monica Mountains. But residents are
unconvinced.</LD>
<TE>   Tony Morris, who founded the fledgling Aerial Fire Protection
Assn., has negotiated, pressed and all but begged the county and
state to buy the planes, which he believes could save Topanga
Canyon's melange of 5,000 woodsy bungalows and high-priced estates
from a fast-moving fire.</TE>
<TE>   A former documentary film writer, Morris hopes the money can be
raised by local entertainment industry professionals, who are scared
as all getout--but don't want to actually get out of the canyon.</TE>
<TE>   "This idea started with self-interest," Morris said. "I don't want
to burn to death."</TE>
<TE>   The association has not raised any money nor approached the
insurance companies, foundations and entertainment companies it
believes would be primary benefactors. Morris was reluctant to say
whom he would target but said that Steven Spielberg and Kate
Capshaw's recent donation of $12 million to keep some mountain
stables open to the public demonstrates the means and generosity of
some residents in the Santa Monicas.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy smoke damaged Morris' home in the 1993 Topanga Canyon fire,
which killed three people and destroyed more than 300 homes in
Calabasas, Malibu and Topanga and inspired the county to lease the
Super Scoopers. The fire stopped 150 feet short of Morris' house. His
neighbors and other Topangans rebuilt over the ashes of theirs.</TE>
<TE>   "A small percentage of people eventually decide the danger is too
much, but most of us stay because we love the area so much," Morris
said. "No matter why we live here, if the county allows people to
live here, it's got to protect us."</TE>
<TE>   The Aerial Fire Protection Assn. made a video last year vaunting
the high-capacity, Canadian-made planes and depicting the desperation
of residents who live amid the touchwood in the canyons. The group
also proposed a fire protection district to raise taxes for the Super
Scoopers.</TE>
<TE>   The county already leases two of the planes during the traditional
fire season, from mid-September to December.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Cavage, president of the Aerial Fire Protection Assn., said
that is not enough. The imminent big one is a "coming war," he said,
and the county should be prepared to outgun the conflagration.</TE>
<TE>   "In a warehouse building, you wouldn't turn the sprinklers on
three months and leave them off nine," Cavage said. "With 10 million
people in greater Los Angeles, wouldn't it be wise to deploy a full,
functional arsenal year-round?"</TE>
<TE>   The fixed-wing Canadair CL-415 Super Scooper fills its tank in as
few as 16 seconds by skimming across a body of water--in Southern
California, usually the ocean. It dumps 1,600 gallons at a time and
can circle back at 170 mph.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the leased Super Scoopers, the county has a stable
of two new $12.5-million Firehawk helicopters--a modified version of
the military's Black Hawk--and five smaller choppers. The county also
leases two 2,000-gallon-capacity Erickson Air-Crane helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   The Firehawks have proved their value but were a hard sell, even
in fatter times for the county, according to Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very skeptical about those until the fire chief convinced
me it was better to buy them than to lease or purchase any other
piece of equipment, including Super Scoopers," Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   While the Topanga group contends purchase price is the one thing
in the way of owning Super Scoopers, Yaroslavsky and fire officials
say other costs, such as maintenance and crew salaries, make the
association's proposal dubious.</TE>
<TE>   County Fire Chief P. Michael Freeman said that, cost aside, the
Super Scooper might not be the best choice for the county's widely
varying terrain. It can't be used at night and is not as precise as a
helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   The Super Scooper has other detractors. The California Department
of Forestry and Fire Protection, like other agencies, uses converted
Korean War-era military planes to fight fires.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Terrill, public information officer of the department, said
the state cannot justify buying the Canadian planes when the federal
government gives away the military planes. Converting a plane to
fight fires costs about $2.2 million. For about the cost of two Super
Scoopers, the department outfitted its entire fleet of 23 air
tankers.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman and Yaroslavsky insist they are not at odds with the
Aerial Fire Protection Assn., and say that handing them an
eight-figure check would not be enough to put Super Scoopers in the
budget.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had $50 million on the table and the objective was to fight
fires the very best we can, quickly and decisively from the air, my
experience tells me more heavy-capacity helicopters make more sense
than buying Super Scoopers," Freeman said.</TE>
<TE>   The two Super Scoopers the county does lease have a mixed record
of fighting fires in their seven years in Los Angeles County. They
doused a 1999 Thanksgiving Day blaze in Santa Monica in three drops.
They snuffed out a 1996 Westlake Village fire with Santa Ana winds
blowing but were not much help against higher winds in a Calabasas
fire a week earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Aerial Fire Protection Assn. contends the Super
Scoopers are needed.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to put a burden on the county, but we do need these
planes," Cavage said, pointing out that Super Scoopers are used in
Minnesota, Canada and France.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky is not buying it.</TE>
<TE>   "Minnesota's biggest mountain is a molehill," he said. "Europe is
not L.A. The county owning a plane that will sit for most of the year
is like a Nebraskan owning a boat."</TE>

<HD>120 New HIV Cases Recorded in Last 2 Months</HD>
<DH>Health: To better track the spread of the virus that causes
AIDS, county officials have shifted to a state-required method of
reporting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the two months since Ventura County began recording the number of
new HIV cases to better track the spread of the virus that causes
AIDS, 120 new cases have been reported.</LD>
<LD>   And county public health officials estimate there may actually be
as many as 1,200 cases locally.</LD>
<LD>   As of July 1, state public health officials are requiring doctors
and laboratories to report new cases of HIV as well as new cases of
AIDS. The county began monitoring new cases in May.</LD>
<TE>   Public health authorities hope to better understand how many new
cases of HIV are occurring and what groups are being affected and to
target their education and outreach efforts to those groups.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, we only reported the tip of the iceberg--people who
were already sick [with AIDS]," said Dr. Robert Levin, the county's
medical health director. The California Department of Health Services
has recorded 347 patients with AIDS in the county, but without
tracking the number of new HIV infections, public health officials
were unable to truly follow the spread of the virus, Levin said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new system, doctors and laboratories use an alphanumeric
code to report new HIV cases, instead of reporting the patient's
name. Patients tested at sites where they do not provide their names
are not included in the county's records of new cases.</TE>
<TE>   County public health officials say it is too soon to determine any
definite trends from data compiled from the first 81 reported cases
in the county. But they said the data fit existing patterns of HIV
infection and that the rising numbers indicate a growing need to
increase HIV and AIDS awareness in the community.</TE>
<TE>   The data show the majority of the patients were between the ages
of 20 and 40 and had contracted the virus through sexual contact.
Twice as many males as females were infected.</TE>
<TE>   Diana Goulet, project director for Ventura's HIV/AIDS Program,
said she has also seen an increase in the number of new HIV cases
among Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Data from the county showed that 30 of the first 81 patients were
Latino.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest increase we're seeing, given the limited data on HIV
disease, is in the Hispanic/Latino population," Goulet said. "We
certainly need to get the message out to that population that they
are at risk and what the risk behaviors are, and how to protect
themselves."</TE>
<TE>   But getting that message out is a challenge, said Bruce Bradley, a
spokesman for Ventura County Rainbow Alliance. The organization
promotes HIV and AIDS awareness among the gay and lesbian community,
even going so far as to have a "cyber-outreach" worker who enters
chat rooms to discuss safe sex.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley knows of six clients who have died of AIDS since February,
but with more people living longer with HIV, he said it's difficult
to get people to understand the severity of the virus and the need to
avoid risky behaviors.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're combining your message with people going to funerals,
it's pretty powerful," Bradley said. But now, "the message doesn't
have the same effect that it once did."</TE>
<TE>   Goulet added that media coverage of new HIV medications has led
some people to believe the virus is curable.</TE>
<TE>   But people need to realize that it isn't, and that no one is
immune, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "[HIV] continues to spread because there is a little bit of [an
attitude] of 'Just this once won't hurt' or 'It won't happen to me,'
" she said. "But everyone is at risk."</TE>

<HD>Memorial Overwhelms Family, Friends</HD>
<DH>Grief: So many people took gifts to the street where a girl
was abducted, the display had to be dismantled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It began as a gesture of hope--a tiny pile of gifts to welcome home a
missing and much-beloved little girl.</LD>
<LD>   Within hours, however, the modest assortment of Mylar balloons and
smiling stuffed animals became a somber memorial, and a symbol of a
parent's worst fears.</LD>
<LD>   In the days since authorities announced the death of Samantha
Runnion, the 5-year-old abducted from her Stanton condominium complex
last week, the memorial outside her home has become Orange County's
"ground zero."</LD>
<TE>   In a small, grassy courtyard just yards from where Samantha was
kidnapped, the site has continued to grow and attract a pilgrimage of
the sympathetic. Thousands of parents and children have come by, a
reverent silence part of their tribute.</TE>
<TE>   Flowers and cards have arrived from as far as New York and Las
Vegas, adding to the hundreds of candles, stuffed animals and toys
already there.</TE>
<TE>   The volume of offerings has been such that the Runnions and their
friends are running out of storage space. Friends who have tended to
the site are exhausted. And some neighbors, still shaken by the
abduction, sexual assault and murder of Samantha, are unnerved by the
unfamiliar faces showing up near their homes.</TE>
<TE>   For these reasons, Samantha's memorial was dismantled Sunday
evening.</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca Clifford, a neighbor and friend of Samantha's mother,
stood up and announced: "It's after 6 o'clock, and we need you to
go.... Thank you for coming."</TE>
<TE>   The visitors quietly filed out, a few with tears, leaving behind
the teddy bears, flowers and votive candles arranged to spell
"Samantha."</TE>
<TE>   About 20 youths from Calvary Chapel Beachside in Huntington Beach
gathered in a circle and prayed.</TE>
<TE>   Above, five planes wrote "WE ALL LOVE YOU SAMANTHA R." in the
bright blue sky.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, visitors said the memorial's imminent closing
prompted them to come.</TE>
<TE>   "We came from Santa Monica," said Kathy Leiva, 39. "I can't
imagine living without my daughter. When I saw the face of the mother
on TV and I saw how desperate she looked, it just really hit me."</TE>
<TE>   Like Leiva, many others brought their children, some using the
pilgrimage as an opportunity to drive home lessons about the dangers
of life and not trusting strangers.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha was grabbed while she and a friend played near a row of
garages at the complex July 15. Her nude body was discovered by a
hiker the following day in Cleveland National Forest. On Friday,
authorities arrested Alejandro Avila, 27, of Lake Elsinore, accusing
him of her kidnapping and death.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas announced
that he will consider whether to seek the death penalty and will
consult with Samantha's mother and Avila's defense attorney before
making his decision.</TE>
<TE>   Avila is scheduled to be arraigned today in a Santa Ana courtroom
on charges of abducting, sexually assaulting and strangling the girl.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very cruel wake-up call," said a tearful Hilda Nowak,
41, of Orange, one of hundreds who visited Samantha's memorial
Sunday. "I have girls and they're definitely afraid. They used to go
out and play in the neighborhood and now they're overly cautious."</TE>
<TE>   Nowak's 13-year-old daughter, Andrea, said she had helped wash
cars to raise money for the family.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad we came here," Andrea said. "It just shows that a lot of
people who never really knew Samantha still care."</TE>
<TE>   As tearful visitors walked past the memorial tables, Robin Jacobs,
30, removed wilted flowers from the display and her 13-year-old
daughter, Hannah, scraped candle wax from the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs, who lives in the same complex and helped set up the
display, said she and other residents have been awe-struck by the
turnout.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen anything like this," Jacobs said.</TE>
<TE>   While Samantha's family have secluded themselves since learning of
her death Tuesday, Samantha's mother has visited the memorial each
evening, reading notes and taking some offerings back to her
apartment, Jacobs said. Items not kept by the family will be donated
to children's hospitals and other charities, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors say maintenance of the memorial has been taxing.</TE>
<TE>   "People here are still scared, and there's so many strangers
coming here now," Jacobs said. "We're going to bed with this and
waking up with this. It's just physically and mentally exhausting."</TE>

<LD>A San Jose woman was sentenced to nine months in jail after being
convicted of a hate crime in which she attacked a man of Middle
Eastern descent while shouting slurs during a road rage incident.</LD>
<LD>   Angel Ann Coley, 28, also was ordered Friday to pay restitution to
Mohamed Aram, the 31-year-old man she kicked, bit and punched in
November after using her car to ram his limousine into an
intersection because he had not gotten out of her way at a red light.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses told police that Coley got out of her car and confronted
Aram. They said she bit his hand, kicked him in the groin and punched
him.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses also told police that during the attack, Coley shouted
ethnic slurs at Aram, who emigrated from Egypt six years ago.</TE>
<TE>   During her trial, Coley maintained that Aram's vehicle had hit her
car and he had refused to show identification.</TE>
<TE>   However, her story conflicted with evidence and with testimony
from witnesses.</TE>

$1.6-billion bond measure to revamp a water system that serves 2.4
million Bay Area residents.</LD>
<LD>   If the bond is approved by the board and by voters, water rates
for San Franciscans would triple by 2015 to pay for the city's share
of rebuilding the aging Hetch Hetchy water system.</LD>
<LD>   The board also is scheduled to decide today between two charter
amendments that would enable the city to buy electricity, build power
plants and allow the shutting down of a fossil-fuel burning power
plant that is owned by Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.</LD>

<HD>Decades-Old Rule Caps Senior Citizens' Stipend</HD>
<DH>Lifestyle: Change is sought in $20 personal spending
allotment for 6,000 retirement home residents in the state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All Esther Gold says she wants to do is to live out her life with
dignity.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd like to be able to go out for an occasional lunch. But I've
got to buy toothpaste, Kleenex, hearing-aid batteries. I haven't been
shopping for clothes in two years. I've been wearing the same shoes
for four years."</LD>
<LD>   Gold, a 98-year-old retirement home resident, is among 6,000
Californians caught up in a bureaucratic fight over cost-of-living
allowances for senior citizens.</LD>
<TE>   Under a decades-old formula that establishes the "poverty level"
for retirees, Gold and other low-income retirement home residents
receive $20 a month to spend on "personal items," such as their own
telephones, clothing, taxi rides, movie tickets and haircuts. Other
senior citizens are allocated $103 a month for such incidentals.</TE>
<TE>   The personal spending allowance is paid with federal Supplemental
Security Income funding administered through the state. But the
amount depends on which side of the poverty level line the recipient
is on. Currently the line is set at $939. Those whose monthly income
from Social Security or other sources is below that receive the full
$103 allocation. Those with higher incomes get $20.</TE>
<TE>   At the Los Angeles Jewish Home for the Aging in Reseda where Gold
and 100 others live, that means many seniors have come to view
periodic Social Security payment increases with dread.</TE>
<TE>   "My roommate will go over the $939 mark by a few dollars the next
time Social Security increases, and she will lose $83," said Norma
Linn, 81, who has already crossed the line and is among those
struggling to get by on $20 a month. "I've never felt so poor in my
life."</TE>
<TE>   Most of those living at the home never see their Social Security
money--it goes directly to offset the cost of their residential care.
But they are in tears when they find out that their monthly spending
money is being cut by 80%, said Molly Forrest, the home's chief
executive officer.</TE>
<TE>   Forrest said the home forwarded the full allotment to all
low-income residents until about two years ago, when state officials
told her such payments violated the law.</TE>
<TE>   State legislation in 1972 set the $20 limit. At the time, Forrest
said, that was considered a sufficient monthly personal spending
allowance for Medi-Cal recipients.</TE>
<TE>   These days, the withheld money goes to help pay recipients'
housing costs. Since the cash cutoff, the 70 Reseda retirees affected
by it have steadily lobbied Sacramento officials to update the
30-year-old stipend rule so it better reflects the current cost of
living.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a struggle living on $20 a month. I don't go out where I
have to spend a lot of money. My niece and nephew in Woodland Hills
are nice--they'll invite me over for a meal or a movie and I always
accept," said 90-year-old Jules Berlinsky, who has lived at the home
for seven years. "But there are people here in deep trouble who have
no family around to help them. They just sit here day after day."</TE>
<TE>   Resident Sivian Zaiden wrote state Assembly leaders last year to
argue for a larger stipend. She found she could not use a
prescription for $10.55 medicine because she paid her $13.21 phone
bill and had only $6.79 left for the month.</TE>
<TE>   "I watch my telephone bill like a hawk--I fought one time to get a
96-cent overcharge refunded," said Zaiden, who described herself as
"way over 65" and her monthly Social Security income from a career as
a bookkeeper as less than $1,000. "I'm spending my years now in
agony, counting my pennies. I worked hard all my life to increase my
Social Security benefits. I never expected this."</TE>
<TE>   Forrest tries to keep residents' spirits up and encourages them to
write lawmakers in Washington. In February, Sacramento legislators
approved an amendment to California's Medi-Cal rules that would allow
for $103 payments.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it's in Washington's hands," Forrest said. "I think we have a
50-50 chance at best. But having to choose between going to the
movies or getting a haircut is a very tragic choice to have to make."</TE>

<HD>County Uneasy Over Cuts in State Budget</HD>
<DH>Finance: Supervisors may sign a letter to the Assembly
asking for an end to the deadlock. Up to $26 million in funds may be
lost.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the state budget stalemate enters its fourth week, Ventura County
officials remain worried that last-minute cuts could affect services
from health care to law enforcement to tax collection.</LD>
<LD>   County Executive Officer Johnny Johnston is expected to ask the
Board of Supervisors on Tuesday to join other members of the Urban
Counties Caucus in signing a letter urging state Assembly members to
end the deadlock, so that counties know where their finances stand.</LD>
<LD>   "Counties may be at risk of bearing the brunt of this standoff
between Republicans who insist on 'no new taxes' and Democrats who
warn that failure to include increased revenue as part of the package
would jeopardize local government revenues and place numerous
programs at risk," Johnston wrote Friday in a memo to supervisors.</LD>
<TE>   The state Senate approved a $99-billion spending plan June 29, in
time for the new fiscal year, which began July 1.</TE>
<TE>   The Assembly has stalled on the issue, however, with Republicans
holding out over $4 billion in new taxes and fees that Democrats are
proposing to help close a $23.6-billion shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Because the state helps fund many local programs, the outcome of
the debate in Sacramento is sure to affect services in Ventura
County. Johnston and his staff have said the county stands to lose as
much as $26 million, at a time when the county has already made $17.6
million in cuts to balance its $1.2-billion budget.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Judy Mikels said she appreciates the desire shown by
fellow Republicans to keep taxes at bay, but thinks election-year
politics are obscuring a bleak financial reality.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is, this may not be the year for that battle," Mikels
said. "If this is a year we have to raise taxes to provide basic
human services, just get over it and do it. It's time to swallow the
fur balls and move on."</TE>
<TE>   The county's Health Care Agency, which relies heavily on state and
federal money, could be the hardest hit. The agency has anticipated
that state reductions, added to local cuts, could bring its shortfall
to as much as $19 million. That could mean scaled-back psychiatric
services and clinic closures.</TE>
<TE>   Health Care Agency Director Pierre Durand is expected to present
supervisors with a more detailed prediction of service cuts at
Tuesday's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to assess how we can soften this, and we're working on
that right now," Johnston said. "That will help determine whether
we're talking about closing this or that office or clinic or just
scaling back hours. It's hugely complicated. But we know there have
got to be some reductions."</TE>

<HD>Camp Offers Israeli Teens a Break From Strife at Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIN GRENNAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The teens at Camp Alonim in the hills just south of Simi Valley are
learning to scale a climbing wall, produce videos and dance to
Israeli folk music.</LD>
<LD>   But many of them gleaned a more important lesson while watching
and listening to 12 youths from Tel Aviv, where suicide bombings and
sniper attacks continue to be a part of daily life.</LD>
<LD>   They found that their peers can experience terror and suffering
but still maintain their strength and hope.</LD>
<TE>   "They're really, really strong people," said Annie Lascoe, a
sophomore at Calabasas High School. "They just persevere despite all
the horrible things that are happening to their people."</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis are attending the camp at the Brandeis-Bardin
Institute, a Jewish educational facility, through a new program
organized by the institute and the Jewish Federation's Tel Aviv-Los
Angeles Partnership.</TE>
<TE>   The institute and federation granted scholarships to cover most of
the $38,000 cost of the camp for the 12 Israelis, in hopes that the
experience would break through the isolation they may feel and foster
connections between the Israeli and American youths, said federation
spokeswoman Tzivia Schwartz Getzug.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli campers, who paid $200 each, were selected for their
scholastic achievement, knowledge of English and leadership
potential. The program, called Junior Counselors-In-Training, is open
to high school sophomores.</TE>
<TE>   The Tel Aviv teens said they have learned to live with the
violence between Israelis and Palestinians raging in their homeland.</TE>
<TE>   They still go to school, work at part-time jobs and meet their
friends at malls and restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   But they remain constantly on alert. They steer clear of crowds in
the street and keep an eye out for suspicious-looking people. They
stay home for a few days after attacks. And when they hear of an
explosion or shooting, they immediately begin dialing the phone
numbers of friends and family members.</TE>
<TE>   When 15-year-old Igor Belfor heard about a suicide bombing at a
bus station near school six months ago, he tried for two hours to
reach a friend before finding out he was alive.</TE>
<TE>   Gil Amir, 16, said he experienced the same panic when a
neighborhood coffee shop was bombed a few months ago and he couldn't
reach one of his pals.</TE>
<TE>   "It can happen to anyone," said Igor, who went to school with
seven of the 21 people killed last summer in a suicide bombing
outside a Tel Aviv disco. "It's scary, but I try not to be scared. I
try not to think about it all the time."</TE>
<TE>   The three-week camp session, which continues through July 28,
provides 300 Jewish youths ages 8 to 15 with activities ranging from
horseback riding to drama to traditional Shabbat services and
dinners.</TE>
<TE>   During a special forum and in informal evening gatherings, the
American teens asked many questions of the Israelis, from whether
they are afraid to how they feel about their mandatory military
service.</TE>
<TE>   "It kind of opened my mind to what [Israel is] like," said David
Grossman, a Moorpark High School sophomore. "I was really reluctant
to even go over there, but it seems like it is just home to them. I
am kind of curious to go over there now."</TE>
<TE>   While one-on-one conversations between the American and Israeli
teens sometimes turn to current events, they often keep to more
universal teen topics such as music and the opposite sex, Igor said.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole camp is like a small city," said Gil. "It's a
community, and I feel a part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Israeli teens burst into tears Tuesday morning after
Avi Omry, an adult coordinator who accompanied them from Tel Aviv,
announced that Palestinian gunmen dressed as Israeli soldiers had
just killed eight people during an ambush of an armored bus from a
Tel Aviv suburb as it neared the entrance to a Jewish settlement in
the West Bank. American campers hugged their Israeli friends.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel kind of bad I am not there, not part of the pain there,"
said 15-year-old Stephanie Moran of Tel Aviv later that morning.</TE>
<TE>   A few of the Israeli girls were still in tears when they arrived
for their art class later that day. Teacher Lidia Shaddow asked them
to hold hands and pray and then encouraged the Israeli girls to
express their feelings in pictures and words.</TE>
<TE>   One girl sketched a picture of an hourglass and wrote, "As time
goes, I run out of hope." Another drew clouds in a black sky and
wrote in Hebrew, "Life is the greatest gift that God has given us and
no one has the right to take it from us."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great healing place for them," Shaddow said.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis spent three days with the families of American
campers before the session began and will return to their host homes
for four days at the end. From there, some will visit relatives in
the United States, while others will go straight home.</TE>
<TE>   Although the camp provided a respite from the terror in Tel Aviv,
the Israeli teens are looking forward to going back.</TE>
<TE>   "I have something to come back to," Gil said. "I have home."</TE>

<HD>Angolans See Peace Pact as Last, Best Chance to End
Suffering</HD>
<DH>Africa: Re-integrating rebels and rebuilding after 27 years
of fighting are daunting challenges --but the people are ready.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KUITO, Angola</DL>
<LD>When the letter from his brother arrived in May, Jeremias Samalungo
knew that the country's long, cruel war was really over.</LD>
<LD>   Samalungo hadn't seen or heard from his brother since 1980, when
the 14-year-old was kidnapped by fighters with the UNITA rebel army
and forced to join their ranks.</LD>
<LD>   Two years after his brother was stolen from him, Samalungo joined
the government army and fought the guerrillas until 1992. He became a
civilian, married and had a family. Life was hard. The disappearance
of his brother tormented him. His mother died without ever learning
the fate of her lost son.</LD>
<TE>   Time and again, cease-fire agreements broke down, crushing
expectations that the war that had been ravaging this southwest
African nation since 1975 would ever come to an end.</TE>
<TE>   But when Samalungo was finally reunited with his brother last
month, nine weeks after Angola's latest cease-fire, the event
signaled a new beginning for Samalungo and his family, and better
times ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it means that finally all this suffering has come to an
end," said Samalungo, 38, a member of the support staff of an
international aid agency in the battle-scarred town of Kuito, 350
miles southeast of the capital, Luanda. His brother is now 36. "I
personally believe that peace has now come forever."</TE>
<TE>   The challenges are daunting: rebuilding a country that has been
ripped apart by conflict since it gained independence from Portugal
27 years ago, continued suspicion among members of the warring sides,
and the specter of renewed violence. All these cast doubt on
prospects for lasting peace in Angola.</TE>
<TE>   But many Angolans have been desperately clinging to hope since the
April 4 peace agreement was signed by the Angolan government and the
rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA,
its Portuguese acronym.</TE>
<TE>   Local political analysts, foreign diplomats and ordinary Angolans
herald the pact as the best-ever possibility for a cessation of
turmoil in this country.</TE>
<TE>   The expectation for sustainable peace is widely linked to the
death of hard-line UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, who was killed in a
battle with government forces in February. He was seen as a major
obstacle to previous peace efforts and blamed by many for prolonging
the war that claimed at least half a million lives and displaced 4
million people--a third of the population.</TE>
<TE>   But while the fighting has stopped and people and goods have
started to flow down roads and across provincial borders previously
under siege, the difficulties facing Angola's efforts to normalize
are so enormous that many fear the hardships may threaten prospects
for long-lasting stability.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are talking about fighting, then yes, the war is over,"
said Justino Pinto de Andrade, director of the faculty of economics
at Luanda's Catholic University of Angola. "But social and economic
peace have not yet come."</TE>
<TE>   More than 82,000 former rebel fighters have to be demobilized and,
along with more than 250,000 of their family members, re-integrated
into society.</TE>
<TE>   This will be a major feat in a country where unemployment tops
70%. The peace deal allows for the integration of just 5,500 UNITA
fighters into the government armed forces.</TE>
<TE>   Devastated Economy</TE>
<TE>   Angola's economy is in tatters, with the manufacturing industry
virtually at a standstill, and commercial agriculture almost
nonexistent. Land mines litter landscapes where crops once were
planted. For more than a quarter of a century, few children have had
access to proper schooling. Hospitals are dilapidated and lack basic
supplies. Only some sections of the capital have a consistent supply
of electricity--a luxury in other towns. Few in the provinces
remember what it was like to have regular running water.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these challenges--and the knowledge that previous
cease-fires have failed--most Angolans said they would rather fight
for a better quality of life than fight on the battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   People simply need to believe that this time, peace is here to
stay.</TE>
<TE>   "The country is really tired of war," said Gen. Geraldo Sachipengo
Nunda, deputy chief of the Angolan army. "The Angolan forces as well
as UNITA are just exhausted. But the biggest reason of all is the
Angolan people feel the country could never tolerate a new war."</TE>
<TE>   For the UNITA forces and their families who have moved into the
country's 34 "quartering areas," or demobilization camps, the new
fight is just making it through each day.</TE>
<TE>   Food and medicine here are in short supply. Relief workers say
malnutrition is widespread, because thousands have been living in
isolation for years without sufficient nourishment and shelter.</TE>
<TE>   The plight of the soldiers adds to an already desperate
humanitarian situation plaguing this oil- and diamond-rich nation
nearly twice the size of Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. World Food Program estimates that its food stocks will
run out by September. The response from international donors has so
far been tepid.</TE>
<TE>   Other relief agencies concur that tens of thousands of people
could face starvation if adequate assistance doesn't arrive soon.</TE>
<TE>   Broken bridges, land mines and derelict roads and airstrips have
exacerbated the logistical nightmare of transporting supplies.</TE>
<TE>   UNITA leaders say hundreds of their fighters and their relatives
have already died of hunger-related ailments and other diseases.</TE>
<TE>   At a demobilization camp near Gamba, a settlement 35 miles from
here, many ex-soldiers are too weak to do anything but perch on
stools outside neat rows of straw huts that they hurriedly erected in
April to shelter their families.</TE>
<TE>   The camp's 7,000-plus inhabitants only recently started receiving
food aid. While the former fighters complain that the donations of
vegetable oil, corn-soy blend, salt and sugar are too meager, they
concede that the rations are better than going hungry--as was the
case for many of them during the war.</TE>
<TE>   "Military life was never any good," said Santos Jamba, 41, a UNITA
fighter since 1978, who arrived at the Gamba camp in April with his
wife and two of their nine children. "There was no food, no blankets,
no medicine, nothing. Now my life is changing a little. It is from
here that we can begin a different life."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Jamba's belief that his lot is improving, concern is
growing that other, more desperate, former rebels might abandon the
demobilization camps and turn to crime if they don't see a speedy
transformation of their predicament. Several hundred former guerrilla
fighters have reportedly left the camps in search of food, and some
relief workers blame them for a recent spate of attacks on remote
villages.</TE>
<TE>   But senior UNITA officials say they're confident that the camp
conditions won't derail the cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe in this peace process," said Gen. Geraldo Abreu Muengo
Ukwachitembo Kamorteiro, UNITA's chief of staff. "All Angolans are
aware that at last we can have another way of fighting [for what we
want] besides war, which has not only destroyed the country, but the
soul of the nation."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to disarming the rebels, the peace accord legalizes
UNITA and transforms it into the country's main political opposition
to the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or MPLA,
led by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.</TE>
<TE>   But critics question the government's commitment to making the
former rebels a significant part of the country's political
patchwork.</TE>
<TE>   "The government is playing a dirty game," said Pinto de Andrade,
the university analyst. "What it wants is for UNITA people to be in
the quartering areas, so that it can avoid military fights. But as
soon as the government realizes there is no chance for UNITA to go
back to war, it will do everything it can to reduce UNITA's political
potential. This government will do everything it can to stay in
power."</TE>
<TE>   While politicians squabble, ordinary Angolans are trying to get
back to normal lives. The reopening of some roads has seen a cautious
revival of domestic trade and commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Peace has encouraged long-distance truck driver Carlos Manuel
Ferreira to get back on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "I can move more freely now," said Ferreira, 29, recalling how he
was ambushed in 1998 and his cargo pillaged by UNITA guerrillas. "I
leave Luanda at 8 p.m. I drive all night and arrive at my destination
by 6 a.m. the next morning. During the war, that was not possible. It
would take me four days for the same trip. I'm very happy."</TE>
<TE>   Psychological Toll</TE>
<TE>   The war, however, has taken a massive psychological toll.
Insomnia, nightmares, anxiety, depression and heart disease have
become the norm for many people here, said Carlinhos Zassala, a
leading Angolan psychologist.</TE>
<TE>   "Post-traumatic stress disorder is seen throughout the
population," Zassala said. "A small frustration can generate a big
frustration. For example, if a wife prepares lunch too late, a
husband could take a gun and shoot her. The situation doesn't justify
the reaction."</TE>
<TE>   And children haven't been spared.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, if you want to buy a toy for an Angolan child, they don't
want a bike or a car. They prefer a [toy] gun," Zassala said.</TE>
<TE>   For many, the psychological trauma is accompanied by physical
distress.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100,000 people have been mutilated, many of them by land
mines. Recently publicized Angolan government statistics estimate
that 4 million to 5 million land mines still pepper agricultural
fields and roads and surround military installations. They maim and
kill about 60 people each month.</TE>
<TE>   Relief workers said they expected an increase in the number of
land-mine victims as thousands of displaced people try to return to
their homesteads and resume farming.</TE>
<TE>   Still, hope for Angola's eventual recovery continues to be
strengthened by stories like that of the Samalungo brothers. The
tears of joy that flowed the day of their reunion have already helped
to wash away the agony of years of separation and provided a promise
that they can pick up where they left off.</TE>
<TE>   "He changed a lot," Jeremias Samalungo said of his brother, who is
now married with four children. "He is big. He has a beard. But he
still puts his head to one side when he talks, and his jawline,
that's still the same."</TE>

<HD>Chinese Farmers See Tax Burden Lighten</HD>
<DH>Revenue: Experimental program of cuts, slated to expand,
eliminates arbitrary levies and streamlines fees for government
services.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY KUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>XIBU TOWNSHIP, China</DL>
<LD>Despite widespread insolvency among local governments struggling to
provide basic services, Beijing will extend a bold program of rural
tax cuts to more than half of the country's provinces this year.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout China's history, extracting tax revenue from an
agriculture-based economy without igniting peasant rebellions has
been a crucial challenge in ruling the nation's vast hinterlands.</LD>
<LD>   Anhui province, which two decades ago pioneered the reforms that
brought an end to the nation's communes, started the experiment in
2000. It will be expanded to 19 provinces this year, officials say.</LD>
<TE>   The reforms appear to have scored some initial successes and
pleased farmers.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, we used to dodge our local officials. They only
showed up when they wanted money," farmer Sha Longfu said as he stood
in line to pay taxes at this township's new tax collection office.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers who willingly bring their taxes to the government are rare
in Chinese history.</TE>
<TE>   A sign on the wall of the tax office reminds people of how
officials used to extract taxes from recalcitrant households. Tax
officials, it says, may no longer "send police into farmers' houses
to seize grain, drag off farm animals, move away furniture or collect
agricultural taxes by force."</TE>
<TE>   Anhui farmers' per capita income averages $158 a year, and Beijing
has mandated that tax burdens must not exceed 5% of that.</TE>
<TE>   But many township and village levies are as high as three times
the legal tax rate.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these fees fund needed services such as education and
health care. Others subsidize official wining and dining and
infrastructure projects with little use aside from burnishing
officials' public images. Many levies bear fancy names that offer no
clue as to how farmers' money is being used.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with unbearable tax burdens, Anhui farmers have in the past
mounted violent resistance, committed suicide or moved to other
areas.</TE>
<TE>   Under the reforms, some of the local fees have been absorbed into
a higher but standardized agriculture tax, totaling $6 billion a
year. This will be paid to the central and provincial governments,
which will then reallocate $3 billion to townships and villages for
specific uses.</TE>
<TE>   Officials claim that since the reforms were launched, the average
annual tax burden on farmers is down about 30%, from $13 to $9 per
person, not counting the far greater illegal levies, which were
abolished.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they don't dare to impose arbitrary levies on us," said Sha,
the farmer, displaying an official notice that clearly lists the
taxes he has to pay this year. He can now refuse to pay any fee not
on the list.</TE>
<TE>   In another landmark step, next year Anhui will abolish the
burdensome requirement of unpaid labor--fixing roads, dikes and
bridges--that local governments for centuries have forced upon
peasants.</TE>
<TE>   The downside of the reforms is that local governments, which were
deep in debt before the changes, are hard-pressed to provide basic
services.</TE>
<TE>   According to Anhui officials, the reforms have cut provincial
revenue by $210 million. An additional $490 million in illegal local
education fees and $240 million in unnecessary infrastructure
projects were also scrapped. Central government subsidies of about
$210 million did little to cover township and village deficits.</TE>
<TE>   Anhui, with a population of 63 million, has roughly 30,000
villages. According to state media, each requires about $4,800 a year
to cover official payrolls and expenses. But the average village's
tax take in 2000 was only $3,600.</TE>
<TE>   Since the budget cuts, local officials "aren't getting by
comfortably," Anhui Deputy Gov. Zhang Ping said, but government
offices and schools are still able to function without increasing
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "With the budget shortfalls, local governments are operating at a
very low level of efficiency," acknowledged an Anhui official working
on the reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Zhang said that since the reforms cut its revenue, Anhui has had
to lay off about 30,000 civil servants and 110,000 "temporary" local
officials.</TE>
<TE>   The "temporary" officials are mostly farmers for whom friends and
relatives have arranged salaried posts in local government.</TE>
<TE>   The poorer the region, the more officials there are, because there
are no industries to absorb surplus farm labor.</TE>
<TE>   For centuries, China had no local government below the county
level. Local gentry and clan patriarchs governed the empire's myriad
villages.</TE>
<TE>   To extend their control down to society's grass roots, the
Communists set up village and township governments. But these had no
authority to collect taxes until 1979 and 1985, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   After that, local government payrolls ballooned, and China now has
more than 13 million officials at or below the county level whose
salaries must be paid by farmers' taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Many experts remain skeptical about the fate of the reforms. They
advocate abolishing agricultural taxes, because farming is too
unprofitable given China's scarce land per capita and inefficient
production methods.</TE>
<TE>   The experiment "is just the latest round of reforms similar to
those implemented by China countless times throughout its history,"
Qinghua University historian Qin Hui wrote in China Reform magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Qin argued that, although the reforms scored initial successes,
peasants have tended to forget which fees were replaced by the flat
tax, allowing officials to reimpose the levies under new names. Qin
added that to truly modernize its rural tax system, China must
establish a graduated tax rate based on income. For centuries, rural
taxes have been assessed according to population and farm acreage,
penalizing grain growers.</TE>
<TE>   More important, he wrote, farmers' tax obligations must be
balanced by more political rights.</TE>

<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Iraq and Iran on Sunday exchanged the remains of more than 1,700
soldiers who died in the two countries' prisons after being captured
in their 1980-88 war.</LD>
<LD>   The handover, which took place at the Iraqi border post of
Munthiriya, 110 miles east of Baghdad, involved the remains of 1,166
Iraqis and 570 Iranians.</LD>
<LD>   The exchange was part of efforts by the neighbors, branded by the
U.S. as belonging to an "axis of evil," to normalize relations.</LD>
<TE>   Fahmi Qaisi, head of the Iraqi war prisoners and missing in action
committee, told reporters that among the remains were those of 14
Iraqis captured by Iran during the 1991 Persian Gulf War, when a
U.S.-led coalition drove Baghdad's forces out of Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi officials would meet the Iranian side after the handover
ceremony to agree on repatriation of remaining corpses, Qaisi said.
He said new talks would be held on the handover of prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated total of 1 million Iranians and Iraqis were killed in
their nations' war.</TE>

<HD>Kazakh Media Live on the Edge When They Criticize
Government</HD>
<DH>Central Asia: Outlets are vandalized, even terrorized.
Situation poses dilemma for U.S., which values nation's military
cooperation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALMATY, Kazakhstan</DL>
<LD>Irina Petrushova was upset when she received an anonymous funeral
wreath on Women's Day. She was more anxious when a decapitated dog
was found hanging on the window of her office. And she became further
disturbed when someone left the dog's head in a package on her
doorstep.</LD>
<LD>   But the real blow came when at least three Molotov cocktails were
thrown into the offices of the newspaper she runs, Republic Business
Review, in the middle of the night in May--a professional arson job
that destroyed the meager resources of what had been Kazakhstan's
most prestigious financial journal.</LD>
<LD>   "These are truly KGB methods," said the 36-year-old editor, whose
reporting has irked supporters of Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan
A. Nazarbayev.</LD>
<TE>   Nevertheless, she said, "we plan to keep publishing."</TE>
<TE>   This month, police said they will charge the paper's publisher,
Muratbek Ketebayev, with the crime--saying he paid two unemployed men
$1,000 to carry out the deed. Ketebayev dismissed the allegation as
ridiculous.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no motive," he said. "The police ... mean to create a
negative image around the opposition mass media."</TE>
<TE>   As in much of the former Soviet Union, freedom of the press is an
iffy proposition in Kazakhstan, the large Central Asian republic run
by Nazarbayev, who is generally considered close to the United States
and getting closer since the launching of the war against terrorism
in Afghanistan to the south.</TE>
<TE>   On the same day that the arson accusations were leveled against
Ketebayev, the United States and Kazakhstan entered into an agreement
allowing U.S. military aircraft to land at this city's airport in an
emergency.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights activists say the need for military cooperation with
the Central Asian states since the war in Afghanistan began seems to
amount to tacit Western approval of the region's spotty human rights
record and autocratic rulers, most of whom have served since Soviet
times.</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, U.S. Ambassador Larry Napper has given moral support
to independent Kazakh journalists. After the newspaper offices were
set on fire May 22, Napper visited the charred remains and urged law
enforcement authorities to find those guilty. He also issued a
statement expressing deep concern.</TE>
<TE>   "This act of violence," he said, "raises serious questions about
the safety of the independent media in Kazakhstan."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the burning of the newspaper's offices, other media have
suffered acts of vandalism.</TE>
<TE>   Someone has repeatedly been cutting the feeder cable of TAN TV.
Two journalists from the weekly newspaper SolDat were badly beaten by
four men who invaded their offices May 21, and earlier in May there
was another arson attack, this one against the Ak Zhaiy publishing
house.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition leaders link the strong-arm tactics to the regime's
hypersensitivity since the disclosure in April that Nazarbayev had
shunted $1 billion in state oil revenue into a Swiss bank account.
(The government later explained it as a reserve fund to help
stabilize Kazakhstan's currency, but not everyone in the country of
16 million bought the explanation.)</TE>
<TE>   Another reason for the attacks may be that an organized opposition
is emerging. Two prominent politicians from the new group, Democratic
Choice for Kazakhstan, were taken into custody earlier this year,
including one who had sought refuge in the French Embassy. One of the
pair, a former energy minister, was sentenced Thursday to six years
in prison, and the other, an ex-governor, faces charges that could
lead to a sentence of 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the moves against them, opposition leaders felt confident
enough about their personal safety that they recently handed out
fliers and openly invited foreign journalists to a get-acquainted
forum and buffet at a business club in the center of Almaty.</TE>
<TE>   A senior U.S. diplomat said he sees a "mixed bag" in Kazakhstan's
human rights record. "A couple of arrests of opposition figures have
given us concern," he said. "At the same time, the authorities go
ahead and register an opposition party ... and it becomes a viable
political force.''</TE>
<TE>   For the West, the challenge is how to bring Kazakhstan into line
with international human rights standards without destabilizing a
country that functions as the anchor of Central Asia, a region of
increasing strategic importance to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Kazakhstan is a potentially important future economic
power whose oil and gas reserves are only now starting to be
exploited. Some experts believe that by 2015 it could be the
second-largest exporter of petroleum in the world.</TE>
<TE>   President Nazarbayev, 62, rose through the ranks of the Communist
Party hierarchy in his native Kazakhstan and was the republic's party
chieftain when he helped bring about the dissolution of the Soviet
Union in 1991. He then became independent Kazakhstan's first
president. Already running the republic for 14 years, he shows no
sign of stepping down, and his son-in-law and daughter have become
important political figures as well.</TE>
<TE>   But there have been frequent complaints among the aspiring new
business class that Nazarbayev's family monopolizes business
opportunities in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Editor Petrushova said such concerns naturally led her paper into
covering political topics, and eventually into conflict with
Nazarbayev's entourage.</TE>
<TE>   Republic Business Review is a small paper--circulation 18,000--and
never set out to be an opposition journal, she said. Rather, it meant
to serve as a source of objective information for business owners,
bankers and other professionals.</TE>
<TE>   But "when they started to persecute us, we had to become more
radical to defend ourselves," she said, speaking from a makeshift
office at an independent television station.</TE>
<TE>   "We also printed information that did not appear in other
sources--for example, the questions that parliament deputies asked
about Swiss bank accounts.... No other newspaper dared," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to violence and threats, independent newspapers and
television stations in Kazakhstan have been subjected to a variety of
regulatory penalties. Republic Business Review, for instance, has had
its license revoked; the reason given was that it had omitted
required information pertaining to its license in some of its issues.
Petrushova said the paper will still go forward, using another
license obtained by a friend.</TE>
<TE>   The regulatory issue also led to a three-week trial against
Petrushova for "illegal enterprising" that ended July 4. During the
trial, she said, she was warned by police that it would be better if
she left the country. In the end, she was convicted and sentenced to
18 months in prison but then immediately received amnesty. To her, it
was an attempt at intimidation that did not work. "I like my
business," she said. "They can't make me go, no matter how they try
to scare me."</TE>
<TE>   When questioned about the media problems, the government says it
is just applying Kazakh law and denies any role in the attacks or the
vandalism. "These are all fabrications, aimed at discrediting our
country's independent reputation," Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart
Tokayev said. But the opposition sees it differently.</TE>
<TE>   "A large-scale war is being waged against the opposition media,
their journalists and freedom of speech," said Vladimir Kozlov of
Democratic Choice for Kazakhstan.</TE>
<TE>   Petrushova is not even sure why those around Nazarbayev might feel
so threatened.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no revolutionary atmosphere," she said. "It is more a
case in which one part of the political elite is cornering the other
part and asking to be allowed to share in the business spoils."</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, government critics are simply frustrated by corruption and
dishonesty, she said. "A huge number of people would like to function
honestly," she said. "But after a while, they find that it is
impossible to conduct business honestly.... When people realize that,
they tend to join the opposition."</TE>

<DH>Mideast: State can't deport 21 for kinship with militants,
attorney general says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli officials, faced with an international outcry and a
definitive ruling by the attorney general, acknowledged Sunday that
they couldn't legally deport relatives of suicide bombers unless they
were directly linked to attacks. Meanwhile, a bomb exploded beneath a
passenger train in central Israel, injuring the driver.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, Israeli officials had said they were considering
deportation to the Gaza Strip for 21 people arrested in West Bank
raids who were relatives of suspects in attacks last week that killed
12 Israelis.</LD>
<LD>   The threat generated international condemnation and cries of
collective punishment from the Palestinians.</LD>
<TE>   Amnesty International and Palestinian and Israeli human rights
groups said the proposal was a violation of international law. U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said "self-defense cannot justify
measures that amount to collective punishments."</TE>
<TE>   Even Israel's closest ally, the United States, warned against
deporting anyone based solely on their family relations.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Atty. Gen. Elyakim Rubinstein's office issued a
statement saying deportation could be considered only for people
"directly involved" in attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The 21 militants' relatives arrested Friday were being
investigated to see if any fit Rubinstein's criterion.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the bomb planted on the railroad tracks in the central
town of Yavne that wounded the driver of a passing train was set off
by remote control and weighed about 10 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.</TE>

<HD>Accused Spy Said to Have Died in Russia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GETTER and JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Former CIA agent Edward Lee Howard, who fled to the Soviet Union in
the mid-1980s after he was suspected of selling secrets to the KGB,
reportedly has died after an accident at his residence outside
Moscow.</LD>
<LD>   Howard vanished from Santa Fe, N.M., in September 1985 before the
FBI charged him with espionage. He surfaced about a year later in
Moscow, where he was granted political asylum.</LD>
<LD>   Disclosures made by Howard reportedly dealt a powerful blow to
U.S. intelligence networks in the Soviet capital, and a Soviet
aviation expert said to have been turned in by Howard was executed
for spying.</LD>
<TE>   Richard Cote, ghostwriter of "Safe House," Howard's 1995 memoir,
said Sunday that he received an e-mail Friday about the death from a
friend who was "intimately involved with [Howard's] business dealings
around the world." Cote would not identify the man who sent him the
e-mail, which said Howard had died from a broken neck suffered in an
"accident" at his dacha. The friend added: "As far as I can tell, the
Russians are covering it up."</TE>
<TE>   The CIA said Sunday that it was unable to officially confirm the
death, which was first reported by the Washington Post, citing a
friend of Howard's. In Moscow, a U.S. Embassy spokesman who spoke on
condition of anonymity said the embassy had received reports of
Howard's death and was seeking to verify them with the Russian
government but had not received a response.</TE>
<TE>   Howard joined the CIA in 1981 and was being groomed for a Moscow
posting in 1983 when he failed a polygraph test and was fired. He got
a new job with the legislature in New Mexico, where he was born in
1951. In 1984, he allegedly met KGB agents in Austria and sold them
secrets for $6,000.</TE>
<TE>   As the FBI closed in on him, he eluded capture with an elaborate
ruse involving a dummy made to look like him and a tape recording of
his voice.</TE>
<TE>   Howard and his wife, Mary, went out to dinner. As they drove home,
he jumped out of the car as it rounded a corner and she propped up
the dummy in his place. Once his wife arrived home, she placed a
phone call using the recording. The FBI, which had the residence
under surveillance and was listening to calls from the home,
apparently believed that he was there.</TE>
<TE>   He left behind his wife and his toddler son, Lee.</TE>
<TE>   Cote spent 11 days with Howard in Russia in 1995 but has not kept
up with him since.</TE>
<TE>   "Ed was very candid with me, but having a professional spy be
candid with you doesn't mean a single word was true," Cote said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the dacha where Howard apparently died was owned by the
KGB, had been used as a safe house and is about 10 miles outside
Moscow. The two men grilled steaks there while Cote interviewed
Howard for the book.</TE>
<TE>   Howard also had an apartment in Moscow. Cote said both dwellings
would have been considered luxurious by Russian standards but
"decidedly lower middle class" by U.S. standards.</TE>
<TE>   He said Howard lived in "total isolation" for years, his only
contacts being KGB and Soviet officials. He was allowed visits with
his wife and son once a year.</TE>
<TE>   In infrequent public comments over the years, the defector claimed
that he loved the United States and denied giving the KGB vital
information that led to the arrest and execution of U.S. agents.</TE>

<HD>Palestinians' Slice of Paradise on the Frontline</HD>
<DH>Mideast: A water park provides relief from the heat and the
trials of Israeli occupation. But economic hard times are keeping
many away.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIT JALA, West Bank</DL>
<LD>It's only 32 miles from here to the Mediterranean, but residents of
the landlocked West Bank face daunting roadblocks and curfews to
reach the sea.</LD>
<LD>   So what do you do when it's 90 degrees in the shade, when the sun
has baked the streets into a parched desert and the roads leading out
of town are blocked by razor wire and Israeli tanks?</LD>
<LD>   Improbably enough, a sprawling water park with a swimming pool,
sparkling fountains, fanciful water wheel and a water slide is hidden
away in this Palestinian town next to Bethlehem.</LD>
<TE>   The cool expanse of turquoise is an oddity in what is functionally
a war zone--not to speak of a war zone where the large Muslim
population frowns on appearing in public in nothing but bathing
suits. But for Palestinians, it's about the closest thing they'll
find to a slice of paradise in this hot, hot summer.</TE>
<TE>   "I miss the sand on my feet," 13-year-old Amanda Arja said as she
relaxed on the park's grassy lawn with her girlfriends. "Everybody
wants to go to the beach, but we can't, so we're lucky to have this."</TE>
<TE>   The water park was the inspiration of a Palestinian American
businessman, 49-year-old Jadallah Zaidan. He had spent seven years in
Los Angeles, studying hotel management, working in construction and
saving money, hoping to invest in his homeland.</TE>
<TE>   Zaidan opened the $4-million Olive Tree Tourist Village in the
summer of 2000, hoping to cash in on the crush of tourists expected
in Bethlehem for the millennium year. He hired an Israeli artist to
paint murals of camels and desert scenes on the walls. Among his
first customers were members of a tour group from an Israeli kibbutz.</TE>
<TE>   "We were counting on peace," Zaidan said. "We thought there would
be millions of tourists coming to Bethlehem. We thought we would get
people from both sides, Israelis, Palestinians, too."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly nothing that Zaidan learned in hotel management school
prepared him for what would happen: The Palestinian intifada against
Israeli rule began two months after he opened. Beit Jala became
engulfed in heavy fighting as Palestinian militias traded fire with
Israeli troops in adjacent Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   In the early months, Zaidan recalls, one could sit by the pool and
watch the night sky light up with tracer fire and explosions.</TE>
<TE>   A lawless atmosphere pervaded the West Bank. Palestinian gunmen
would try to get into the water park without paying, wanting to swim,
or more often to gawk at the teenage girls in bikinis.</TE>
<TE>   Then there were problems with devout Muslims. They were displeased
not only with the scanty attire of the girls but also with the fact
that the water park served alcohol and had a discotheque and bingo
hall.</TE>
<TE>   "The [Muslim] women wanted to go into the water with their clothes
on, veils and everything. But it would clog the filter and dye the
water," said Zaidan, who is Christian.</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere in the West Bank is quieter these days, largely
because the Israelis have imposed a strict curfew that limits
business hours. But the Israelis tolerate the water park--who can
make trouble in a bathing suit?--and it is actually busiest during
the curfews.</TE>
<TE>   "People have nothing else to do. If they live nearby, they can
walk," Zaidan said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't be trapped all day in the house with your children.
That's the hardest thing," said Sadeer Suhel, a 30-year-old homemaker
who was picnicking on the lawn with her husband. "We need to have
fun. We need to swim."</TE>
<TE>   Still overcoming the culture shock of moving from California to
the West Bank, Zaidan has learned to make compromises to keep his
business going.</TE>
<TE>   He hired off-duty police officers from the Palestinian Authority
to stand guard and keep out the troublemaking Palestinian militiamen.
He instituted a "ladies' day" on Wednesdays so that Muslim women
would feel more comfortable. He now allows covered women to wade in
the water, though he still strictly enforces the rule: no bathing
suit, no swimming.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest problem for the Olive Tree Tourist Village is the
economic devastation wrought by the nearly 22-month-long uprising.</TE>
<TE>   "People have no money," Zaidan said. "Almost everybody is
unemployed."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the customers are from wealthy Christian families in Beit
Jala, but these are a tiny minority of the population.</TE>
<TE>   In these troubled times, most West Bankers can no more imagine
coughing up the 30 shekels ($6) for an adult ticket or 20 shekels
($4) for a child's admission to the water park than they can imagine
getting into a car and driving to the beach in Tel Aviv.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby at the Dahaisha refugee camp, many children--even
teenagers--have never seen the sea, and some have never been
swimming. The West Bank has no beaches--except along the dense, salty
Dead Sea, which is suitable only for floating.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Gaza Strip is blessed with a Mediterranean coast, it
was difficult even in the best of times for West Bankers to get
there.</TE>
<TE>   "All that the children know of the sea is what they've seen on
television," said Khalid Jamel, 31, a Dahaisha resident.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, hundreds of children from Dahaisha visited the Olive
Tree Tourist Village through a summer camp sponsored by a European
charity, but this year the money has dried up.</TE>
<TE>   Zaidan says he has thought about closing the water park and
leaving the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   "I have this ex-girlfriend in California. She's Jewish. She hears
things on the news and says it is too dangerous here and that I
should come back to California with my wife and kids," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Zaidan says he is still hoping to earn enough through the
water park to pay off his bank loans.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he said, "where would people go swimming? We want to make
life a little easier."</TE>

<HD>Filing Won't Leave Californians in the Lurch</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Even if MCI parent WorldCom failed, government
policies should protect consumers from an abrupt loss of service.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY and ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For years, the biggest challenge WorldCom Inc. and MCI faced was
persuading consumers to switch long-distance companies.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the toughest job may be persuading them to stay.</LD>
<LD>   The bankruptcy filing on Sunday by WorldCom and its MCI subsidiary
is sure to spook some customers, who number as many as 20 million.
But consumer advocates say the filing alone doesn't justify finding a
new long-distance company.</LD>
<TE>   For starters, WorldCom executives pledge that service will
continue without interruption, saying they have lined up lenders to
keep the business going while the company reorganizes under the
protection of U.S. Bankruptcy Court.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, just a few weeks ago WorldCom said it had enough money
to last through the year. Then the company's reserves evaporated as
suppliers demanded to be paid upfront, putting the company in a cash
crunch.</TE>
<TE>   Even if WorldCom failed, though, state and federal policies should
protect customers from an abrupt loss of phone service. The Federal
Communications Commission requires phone companies to give 30 days'
notice before they terminate service, and FCC Chairman Michael K.
Powell has said  he won't hesitate to stretch that period if needed.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, residential and small-business customers use WorldCom's
MCI service only for toll calls. Switching to one of the many
alternative long-distance carriers is a simple task that can be
accomplished with a single phone call or online session.</TE>
<TE>   About 600,000 customers have signed up for more extensive service
from MCI in the last three months, a new "neighborhood" package that
includes local service as well as long-distance calls. The
Californians in that group, at least, are protected by state policies
that call for a smooth transition to alternative carriers when a
local phone provider goes belly up, said Michael Shames, executive
director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network, an advocacy group
based in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers should be comfortable that if they sign up for MCI,
they're not going to be left in the lurch," Shames said.</TE>
<TE>   Potentially the riskiest WorldCom product for consumers, he said,
is prepaid calling cards. But if WorldCom couldn't honor those cards,
buyers might be able to collect refunds from the retailers that sold
them, Shames said.</TE>
<TE>   Several consumer advocates already have established Internet sites
to dispense advice and information to worried MCI customers. Rich
Sayers, known best for his extensive long-distance comparison charts,
set up an MCI-related Internet site for residential customers:
www.bye-bye-mci.com. The Telecommunications Research and Action
Center also posted tips for MCI customers on its Internet site,
www.trac.org.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's extensive network, which stretches across six
continents, provides the electronic thoroughfare for more than 20% of
the long-distance calls in the U.S. and half the world's e-mail. Its
lines carry more long-distance Internet traffic than those of any
other company, and its network supports the world's largest Internet
provider, America Online.</TE>
<TE>   The company's network also provides high-capacity local lines to
businesses in 84 metropolitan areas, including Southern California.
Those business customers would face the most difficult transition if
WorldCom's network shut down, because their phone and computer
systems would have to be connected physically to another company's
lines. Long- distance customers, by contrast, can switch to another
provider by sending instructions electronically to their local phone
network's switches.</TE>
<TE>   Still, WorldCom's network and services are duplicated around the
globe by competitors. That's one of the problems for long-distance
firms: Competition is so extensive and intense that their products
have become commodities.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's financial troubles haven't appeared to trigger an
exodus from MCI's service, Shames said. But one of the biggest
question marks for WorldCom customers will be whether customer
service deteriorates as the company slashes costs.</TE>
<TE>   Last month WorldCom started laying off 17,000 employees, or more
than 20% of its global work force, with the cuts coming from
divisions across the company.</TE>
<TE>   Said analyst Lisa Pierce of Giga Information Group, a technology
research firm: "With all the layoffs at WorldCom, there is real
concern about the potential degradation in network quality, getting
billing disputes resolved, service repairs. Those are quite
legitimate concerns."</TE>
<TE>   Company executives insist that they will be able to maintain the
quality of service, and they have extended more generous guarantees
to assure business customers. Consumers and small businesses receive
no such guarantees from MCI, however, and in California, Shames said,
his group receives more complaints about MCI's phone service than
that of any other company.</TE>
<TE>   Based on experience, those who drop their MCI service may have the
most trouble with the company. One of the most common complaints,
Shames said, is from former MCI customers who keep getting hit with
monthly line charges and fees after they switch long-distance
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Gene Kimmelman, senior director of the Washington office of
Consumers Union, another advocacy group, said WorldCom could survive
even if it lost a significant number of customers.</TE>
<TE>   The key, he said, is for WorldCom to hold on to its major business
and institutional customers, including the federal government.
Typically, such customers are tied to contracts of a year or more,
but an online survey by Infoworld magazine shows early signs of
restlessness.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 106 companies that submitted answers by Saturday, nearly
30% identified themselves as WorldCom customers. Of that group, more
than one-fourth said they were "looking for a new provider."</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Pascal Aguirre of Adventis, a Boston consulting firm, said
the financial turmoil would prompt businesses to "start very
precisely monitoring the service levels that they are getting from
WorldCom." If service deteriorated, he said, that would be "the major
trigger to start defecting."</TE>
<TE>   But Aguirre and other analysts say it is no trivial matter for
major businesses to switch telephone companies, even if their
provider's service degraded to the point of violating their contract.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've got a big network, moving your traffic to another
carrier is beyond nosebleed," said Pierce of Giga. "You would sell
off your children first to a slave trader, it's that bad."</TE>
<TE>   More than any other telecommunications company, MCI taught the
public what it means to find a new long-distance provider. Starting
in the 1960s, when many policymakers considered the telephone
business to be a natural monopoly, MCI battled before the FCC and in
the courts to get into the long-distance market and win equal access
to Ma Bell's customers.</TE>
<TE>   To overcome consumers' reluctance to change providers, MCI and
other upstarts waged a price war, offered cash and other bonuses,
launched massive advertising campaigns and promised discounts on
lengthy calls. Although a significant percentage of AT&amp;T's customers
stayed glued to expensive "basic rate" plans--there were about 30
million such customers as of mid-2000--most consumers found their way
to a new long-distance company.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom, which bought MCI in 1998, collected about 20% of U.S.
long-distance and toll revenue in 2001, according to the FCC's most
recent estimates of the long-distance market. The company ranked
second to AT&amp;T, which collected an estimated 35% of such revenue.</TE>

<HD>Investors Edgy Ahead of Markets' Opening</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Chairman of New York Stock Exchange issues a
plea for calm and patience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors worldwide are bracing for today's trading session amid
fears that Friday's massive stock sell-off will trigger an even
bigger plunge as markets reopen.</LD>
<LD>   The head of the New York Stock Exchange on Sunday pleaded for
calm, but the NYSE and other major U.S. markets said they had no need
for any contingency plans.</LD>
<LD>   In the Far East, stock markets opened sharply lower on worries of
what might be ahead for Wall Street. But some Asian markets quickly
pared their losses.</LD>
<TE>   The Japanese market fell 2% as it opened but recovered to close
off only 0.13%--virtually unchanged. Taiwan's index dropped 2.3% by
its close. The Australian market slid 1.8% at the opening but later
was off 1.1%.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's U.S. market dive, which pulled the Dow Jones industrial
average down 390.23 points to 8,019.26--the lowest level since
1998--was the worst day yet in nearly nine weeks of almost relentless
selling, as investors' collective mood has darkened. NYSE trading
volume set a record Friday, topping 3 billion shares.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the remaining market optimists continue to say an improving
economy and still-buoyant consumer sector should eventually lift the
market and could even spur a major rally today.</TE>
<TE>   But a wave of corporate accounting scandals has crushed many
investors' faith in stocks and helped fuel more selling, extending
the current bear market to 28 months, the longest since the 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts by President Bush and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan last week to focus investors on the positives--mainly, a
still-recovering economy--failed to halt the selling. The Dow sank
7.7% last week, and 4.6% on Friday alone.</TE>
<TE>   Many stocks are at their lowest prices in at least five years, and
the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index is down 44% from its record
high reached in March 2000. That already ranks as one of the biggest
declines of the last century.</TE>
<TE>   Yet analysts worry that many more investors will be tempted to
bail out, fearing that stocks are poised to go dramatically lower.</TE>
<TE>   NYSE Chairman Richard Grasso on Sunday said today could bring a
torrent of selling. "Mondays following Friday declines have always
been difficult, and I suspect tomorrow will be no different," he said
on NBC's "Meet the Press."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, many market pros still have vivid memories of Monday, Oct.
19, 1987, when the Dow plunged a record 22.6% after heavy losses the
previous week.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts noted that there is no way to predict how the market
will fare today. Although many investors may have placed "sell"
orders with their brokers over the weekend, they could rescind those
orders early today. What's more, there is no way to judge in advance
how much buying interest may develop once trading begins.</TE>
<TE>   Last Monday, the Dow fell 440 points in early trading, but
recouped nearly all of that loss by the closing bell.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the NYSE and the Nasdaq Stock Market said their systems
are capable of handling far more volume than has occurred recently,
so they needed no contingency plans for today.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday
declined to comment on whether the agency was taking any additional
steps to prepare for today's trading.</TE>
<TE>   "Circuit breakers" that have been in place for the last decade
would halt trading for one hour if the Dow falls 950 points (about
11.8%) before 2 p.m. EDT. Once the market reopened, if the Dow were
to decline 1,900 points in all (about 23.7%), trading either would
halt for two hours or, if the decline were late in the day, the
market would close for the session.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Sept. 17 of last year, when trading reopened after a
four-session halt in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, the Dow
tumbled 684.81 points, or 7.1%, to 8,920.70.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, NYSE Chairman Grasso urged investors to stay calm.
"Please be patient," he said. "Please don't do something that
emotionally feels good but in the long term will be a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the course of the last 10 years, the market, with all of the
aberrational downdrafts that we've seen, has gone up," Grasso said.
"And I believe over the next 10 years the same will be true."</TE>
<TE>   Abby Joseph Cohen, chief investment strategist at brokerage
Goldman Sachs and one of the market's best-known cheerleaders in the
boom years of the late 1990s, said investors may be losing sight of
the economic fundamentals.</TE>
<TE>   Appearing Sunday on CBS' "Face the Nation," Cohen described "an
economy which is growing, labor markets which are stabilizing, and
inflation which is under control.... I think the direction for stock
prices is higher, not lower."</TE>
<TE>   But for the last two years, small investors have repeatedly been
urged by financial advisors to keep their money in the market, even
as stocks' losses have deepened.</TE>
<TE>   The average U.S. stock mutual fund has plummeted 23% this year
after dropping 10.9% last year and 1.9% in 2000, according to fund
tracker Morningstar Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Decision Economics Inc. in
Boston, warned on "Face the Nation" that there was a significant risk
of "another 8% or 10%, possibly, down before we could bottom out."</TE>
<TE>   "The stock market collapse ... is going to do damage to
consumption and housing," Sinai said. "That will slow the economy
down more. It could create another recession. And that in turn is
going to disappoint everyone" on corporate profits, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, foreign investors remain a wild card: They are believed
to be substantial sellers of U.S. stocks this year, as the weak
dollar has exacerbated their losses.</TE>
<TE>   Sinai said that, because the Federal Reserve already has cut
short-term interest rates to 40-year lows, it isn't clear what more
policymakers could do to help the market--or the economy, if it
falters.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a lot we can do with policy to combat that if it
happens," he said.</TE>
<TE>   James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital
Management in Minneapolis, said he believes that a key element
weighing on stocks is "concern over Fed impotence.... We've had a
long time for rate cuts to take effect, and it just isn't working"
for the market. "There's no real surety the Fed has any bullets
left."</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Paulsen said, if the Fed opted to cut rates in the
face of a deeper market plunge, "it would escalate panic, because
people would go, 'My gosh, the Fed's even scared.' "</TE>
<TE>   Still, the severity of last week's stock losses, and the record
NYSE trading volume on Friday, bolstered the argument that the market
is nearing at least a short-term bottom, many analysts said.
Historically, stocks have reached their lows when investor sentiment
was at its gloomiest.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't recall so much pessimism about both the short-term and
long-term outlook for stocks," said Edward Yardeni, veteran market
strategist at Prudential Securities in New York.</TE>
<TE>   But peaks in pessimism are only evident in retrospect, experts
note. In other words, there is no way to know how much worse
investors might come to feel about stocks as the market bubble of the
late 1990s continues to deflate.</TE>
<TE>   Although principal measures of stock valuations, such as
price-to-earnings ratios, have come down with the collapse of share
prices, many stocks still "are not cheap" when judged historically,
said Chip Hanlon, editor of investing newsletter Unfundamentals.com
in Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   That's one reason he isn't convinced that the long bear market is
ending, even though he is confident that a short-term rally will
ensue soon. "Just as the bull market went to extremes, valuations on
the downside could get extreme, if history is a guide," Hanlon said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Josh Friedman, E. Scott Reckard and Peter
Gosselin contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom Files for Record Bankruptcy</HD>
<DH>Business: Massive debt and an accounting scandal bring down
the telecom giant. It ranks as the nation's biggest corporate failure
ever.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI and ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc., the nation's second-largest long-distance company,
crumpled into bankruptcy late Sunday, brought down by massive debt, a
shortage of cash and an accounting scandal that rocked investor
confidence.</LD>
<LD>   The Clinton, Miss.-based telecommunications giant listed $104
billion in assets in its filing for reorganization under federal
bankruptcy laws, making it the largest such case in history. It
dwarfs December's Chapter 11 filing by Houston energy trader Enron
Corp., which listed assets of $63.4 billion.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom built itself into a telecommunications giant through some
75 acquisitions but along the way amassed $32 billion in debt.</LD>
<TE>   The company's financial troubles stretch across the U.S. economy,
from about 20 million residential and corporate customers to the
large and small pension funds that put nearly $30 billion into
WorldCom bonds that now are almost worthless.</TE>
<TE>   Telephone and data service for customers of WorldCom and its MCI
subsidiary is not expected to be disrupted as the carrier tries to
restructure. WorldCom also carries half the traffic on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to assure the public that we do not believe this
bankruptcy filing will lead to an immediate disruption of service to
consumers or threaten the operation of WorldCom's Internet backbone
facilities," said Michael K. Powell, chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. Telecom Assn., a trade group whose largest members
are WorldCom creditors, warned that the company's filing could lead
to a "state of crisis" in the industry that could raise costs for
other telephone companies and their customers.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter Sunday to the FCC, the trade group asked the agency to
make sure that the bankruptcy filing "does not undermine the
financial stability of other carriers that provide services to it."</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom tops the long list of corporate scandals in the last year
that have helped to rattle investor confidence and shake stock
markets to their lowest points in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "The impact will be way more significant than anything that we
have seen before in telecommunications," said Roger Wery, a telecom
expert at consulting firm PRTM in San Francisco. "It will start with
the telecom industry, but it then has ramifications across real
estate and many other industries. In terms of scale and visibility,
this company can further destroy investor confidence and eventually
consumer confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Much of WorldCom's debt, consisting of $29.3 billion in bonds and
$2 billion in bank loans, will be erased in a proceeding that
protects the company from creditors while it reorganizes. Eventually,
a judge and the company's creditors must approve a reorganization
plan likely to repay creditors only cents on the dollar. Shareholders
also will be wiped out.</TE>
<TE>   Industry experts said that because of the decimated
telecommunications industry, the company's assets probably are worth
less than $15 billion, rather than the more than $100 billion
WorldCom listed in its filing.</TE>
<TE>   The losses stem from the massive investments in the
telecommunications industry that went to build fiber-optic networks
much faster than demand was growing for high-speed connections.</TE>
<TE>   The company's bankruptcy papers, which run about 1,000 pages, were
filed Sunday night in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom said it planned to work through the bankruptcy and emerge
in nine months to a year as a smaller but intact operation. It will
obtain $750 million in cash today as part of $2 billion in special
debtor financing as it pursues its plan to sell some noncore
assets--mainly its wireless, real estate and Brazilian and Mexican
operations.</TE>
<TE>   "Chapter 11 enables us to create the greatest possible value for
our creditors, preserve jobs for our employees, continue to deliver
top-quality service to our customers and maintain our role in
America's national security," John W. Sidgmore, the company's chief
executive, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman Brad Burns said the company would hire a restructuring
chief, who would report to Sidgmore, and add former Atty. Gen.
Nicholas Katzenbach and University of Georgia accounting professor
Dennis R. Beresford to the board. Burns denied widespread reports
that Sidgmore will be forced out, noting that creditors and vendors
had not broached that subject with the company.</TE>
<TE>   Many large corporate customers, which provide two-thirds of
WorldCom's revenue, are looking for other carriers. With WorldCom's
current program to lay off 20% of its work force, analysts figure
that any outages and glitches that occur in its network will take
longer to repair.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's demise had been expected after the company that
exploded onto the telecom scene in the last decade announced June 25
that it had uncovered internal accounting irregularities. Over 15
months, through March, the company overstated revenue by nearly $3.9
billion by converting expenses into capital expenditures--an
accounting sleight of hand that gave the company profits when it
should have recorded losses.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal brought condemnation from President Bush and helped
spur Congress to develop stricter accounting rules and civil and
criminal penalties. It also opened the company up to a slew of new
fraud claims, including a lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The company's aggressive accounting, high executive salaries and
$408 million in personal loans to founder and former CEO Bernard J.
Ebbers rival the improprieties attributed to Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, WorldCom's soaring stock valued the company at
$120 billion. By Friday, with its share price closing at 9 cents, the
company was worth only $281 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Chief executives are clearly going to be held much more
accountable, whether they're held criminally accountable by the
government or civilly accountable by stockholder suits," said Tom
Evslin, chairman of ITXC Corp., a Princeton, N.J., long-distance
carrier. "The result is still that there's going to be a lot of
pressure to tell the whole [quarterly financial] story in an
unadorned way."</TE>
<TE>   Sidgmore had insisted July 2 that WorldCom was too big to fail and
remains a "key component of our nation's economy and communications
infrastructure."</TE>
<TE>   A week later, though, company executives acknowledged that it was
getting harder to avoid a bankruptcy filing as anxious vendors,
mainly the Baby Bells that provide WorldCom access to their local
customers, began wiping out WorldCom's once-substantial cash position
by demanding payment upfront for service.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom has gone through $4 billion in cash and loans since the
end of March and was left with what it said was several hundred
million dollars by the time it filed for bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the company won commitments for $2 billion in loans to
operate under the auspices of the Bankruptcy Court. The special
financing, arranged with J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., Citigroup Inc. and
GE Capital, the financial services unit of General Electric Co.,
kicks in with WorldCom's bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom might not need to touch much of that money because the
bankruptcy filing allows it to halt interest payments and other debt
repayments, saving it hundreds of millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, industry analysts and experts already have been
assessing WorldCom's viability in Chapter 11, and they are not sure
they like what they see. The company is trying to sell operations in
Mexico and Brazil, but those units are not expected to bring in much
money.</TE>
<TE>   Its businesses are so tied together that it would have to tear off
big chunks, such as its UUNet Internet provider, its customer base or
its MCI brand, to get some of the billions it needs--and those sales
probably would destroy any overall value of the company.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom started out as small long-distance carrier in 1983 after
the court-ordered breakup of AT&amp;T Corp. opened up long-distance
competition and turned Ma Bell's local service over to regional Bell
operating companies, generally known as Baby Bells.</TE>
<TE>   The brash Ebbers, a Canadian who attended Mississippi College in
Clinton on a basketball scholarship, took over as chief executive in
1985 and put the company, then called Long-Distance Discount Service,
on an acquisition spree that eventually soaked up about 75 companies.
It went public in 1989 and by 1992 was the fourth-largest
long-distance provider in the country. Its name was changed to
WorldCom in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the 1998 acquisition of MCI Communications Corp. for a
record $40 billion in cash and stock that brought WorldCom widespread
attention and made it the nation's No. 2 long-distance carrier.
Before then, WorldCom was known primarily in corporate circles, where
it provides voice and data services to large companies.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, the company picked up a young accountant named
Scott D. Sullivan, who eventually became chief financial officer and
Ebbers' right-hand man.</TE>
<TE>   As WorldCom's financial woes mounted early this year and his loans
became known, Ebbers quit.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom fired Sullivan in June, blaming him for the accounting
scandal, which had previously escaped both internal auditors and the
company's accounting firm, Arthur Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Jube Shiver in Washington contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>Tough Times Force Cuts at 2-Year Colleges</HD>
<DH>Education: Applications increase as budgets shrivel.
Campuses are turning students away.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN and REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To cope with soaring enrollments and tightening budgets, many
community colleges in California and across the nation are cutting
classes and turning away students.</LD>
<LD>   The cutbacks are being made just as more students head to
community colleges in Los Angeles and elsewhere because of layoffs,
rising tuitions at public universities and a boom in the number of
college-age youths.</LD>
<LD>   "Making cuts at these colleges is like eating our seed corn," said
George Boggs, president of the nonprofit American Assn. of Community
Colleges, a Washington D.C.-based advocacy group for the two-year
colleges.</LD>
<TE>   "Education is crucial" to fighting unemployment and strengthening
the economy, Boggs said. "And we shouldn't be starving the solution."</TE>
<TE>   With so many states facing budget shortfalls this year, public
four-year institutions are struggling. Many have imposed or are
considering cutbacks such as tuition increases and enrollment caps.
But tough times hit especially hard at community colleges, which rely
more heavily on state funding than their four-year counterparts, and
with tighter budgets, have fewer options for cuts.</TE>
<TE>   So far, California's community college and public university
systems have not proposed higher fees for residents for the coming
year, despite a $23.6-billion gap in the state budget. But with more
and more students heading their way, community colleges say they must
try to limit enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   Educators say denying access to students is wrenching for these
schools, which are dedicated to providing higher education, at low
cost, to virtually all comers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of a moral imperative for us," said Mark Drummond,
chancellor of the Los Angeles Community College District, where
enrollment is growing about 10% a year. "We know that the future of
someone who doesn't attend college is not very good."</TE>
<TE>   The state's 108 community colleges enrolled an estimated 1.68
million students last year, the most ever and an increase of 6% from
the year before, according to the state chancellor's office.</TE>
<TE>   The budget pending before the Legislature includes enough for
enrollment growth of 3%. Administrators are not waiting for its
passage to make cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we're not going to get more," said California Community
Colleges Chancellor Thomas J. Nussbaum.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Drummond said, administrators decided in May to
eliminate about 5% of the planned summer school courses at the
district's nine campuses. He said further reductions of 5% to 10% are
in the works for the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer course offerings mean hardship for such students as Allen
Camilo, a former United Airlines reservations agent who was laid off
when the industry slumped after Sept. 11. Like many other laid-off
workers, Camilo, 32, went back to school, hoping more education might
protect him against future downturns.</TE>
<TE>   Camilo said he has made steady progress since enrolling at Los
Angeles City College, but was frustrated when he couldn't get into an
English composition course this summer. He took the class online,
reluctantly.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the same," Camilo said of the online class. "But 60
students signed up, and there were 20 of us who couldn't get in. We
didn't have this problem before."</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, community college enrollment is tough to gauge with
certainty; the schools' enrollment levels are more volatile than
those of four-year colleges, and national education figures often lag
by more than a year. The most recent numbers show that, in the fall
of 1999, 5.3 million students were enrolled at 1,151 accredited
two-year colleges, according to the National Center for Education
Statistics.</TE>
<TE>   But Boggs and many community college officials say accounts from
numerous campuses point to substantial enrollment increases since
then.</TE>
<TE>   Besides a weak job market that is prodding many adults to return
to school to expand their skills, the children of baby boomers now
are heading to college in great numbers, along with the children of
new immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, growing numbers of recent high school graduates
are choosing to start their studies at community colleges rather than
at more expensive four-year schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Community colleges are really in a double crunch--trying to deal
with booming demand just as the money goes down," said Patrick M.
Callan, president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher
Education in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   The effects are far-ranging. In Florida, for instance, the
community college system enrolled 10% more students last year than in
the year before, said David Armstrong, the system's executive
director.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong said the Florida system, one of the nation's largest,
managed to avoid budget reductions for the fall but had to raise
tuition by 2%.</TE>
<TE>   "If this continues--and we're projecting a 7% enrollment growth
for this year too--I don't know what we'll do," Armstrong said.</TE>
<TE>   In Illinois, at one of the nation's biggest community college
campuses, College of DuPage near Chicago, administrators are
"capping" classes for the fall--limiting class sections and cutting
those with lower head counts.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, enrollment is expected to rise to 35,000 this fall, up
about 10% in the last five years, said DuPage spokesman William
Troller.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, a state budget squeeze has prompted the school
to increase tuition $2 per unit--to $39--for the summer session, and
in the biggest single increase in the school's history, raise it
another $4 per unit for the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Still, residents of the DuPage district who attend school full
time will pay $2,064 in tuition and fees next year, far less than
they would at competing four-year schools.</TE>
<TE>   Tess Glancey, who graduated from high school in June, was
considering attending the University of Wisconsin at Madison.</TE>
<TE>   But Glancey, 17, said the university's higher cost--especially
after a recent 13% tuition increase for out-of-state students for
next year--has persuaded her to live at home and spend her first two
years at DuPage, where she has a full-tuition scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   In California, community colleges enrolled record numbers last
year, and exceeded enrollment caps by about 75,000 students
statewide, according to Nussbaum.</TE>
<TE>   "All over the state, people were being squeezed out of the work
force, and they were coming to community colleges," Nussbaum said.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, we had thousands of extra students and no money
from the state to pay for them."</TE>
<TE>   Urban districts such as Los Angeles--which had about 22,000 of
these "unfunded" students among its 135,000 total last year--were the
ones most severely affected, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Nussbaum and other community college leaders hope to persuade
legislators to fund more realistic levels of enrollment next year.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, they say, the state's most crowded campuses have
little choice but to reduce course offerings, effectively turning
students away.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we're not going to be able to serve all the students who
want to come here," said Darroch "Rocky" Young, president of Pierce
College in Woodland Hills, which is part of the Los Angeles district.
"It's hard to be an educator, and have people who want to be
educated, and have to turn them away. It's hard for my soul."</TE>
<TE>   Young said Pierce had 4,000 unfunded students last year, or 22% of
its student body.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Los Angeles City College had about 4,400 unfunded
students last year out of 18,000 in its total enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   President Mary Spangler said the school had been forced to cut its
summer class schedule and that it planned to reduce classes further
in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Other hard-hit colleges are hiring part-time instructors instead
of full-time faculty members, increasing class sizes and digging into
reserves. But longer-term solutions have to be found, Nussbaum said.</TE>
<TE>   "We can step up to the plate for one year, or maybe two years,"
the chancellor said. "But it's not a sustainable strategy or a
quality strategy for our system in the long term."</TE>

<HD>Big Fish Near Marine Reserves Called Weighty Evidence That
Bans Work</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Since the dawn of the Space Age, fishermen here have grown to accept
the 15-square-mile security zone that keeps boats out of the waters
surrounding rocket launching pads.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, clever fishermen long ago learned how to parlay a
forbidden zone into a bonanza: If an area is set off-limits, the
fishing on the perimeter can be extraordinary.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists more recently discovered the same thing, carefully
recording the remarkable abundance of fish in the protected waters
surrounding the Kennedy Space Center and the cluster of trophy fish
caught just outside the boundary.</LD>
<TE>   This case study of the "spillover effect" has surfaced as a prime
argument for establishing similar no-fishing zones off the California
coast. State officials are planning a network of no-take zones around
the Channel Islands, in addition to last week's emergency closing of
most bottom fishing along the continental shelf.</TE>
<TE>   Marine biologists have documented a resurgence of sea life in
closed areas in the Florida Keys and on New England's Georges Bank.
Other studies have found signs of similar recoveries in marine
reserves off New Zealand and South Africa, in the Philippines and the
Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   In a survey of 89 scientific papers, UC Santa Barbara researchers
found that 90% of marine reserves around the world had more fish, 84%
had much larger fish and shellfish and 59% had a far greater variety
of marine life than did adjacent waters. So far, the spillover effect
hasn't won many converts among anglers, who disdain it as "junk
science," and fear new limits on where they can fish.</TE>
<TE>   Yet fishermen flock to the peripheries of the off-limits areas,
their actions belying their skepticism.</TE>
<TE>   "The prime fishing areas have always been right up against the
NASA restricted area," said Frederick D. Mastin, who runs the Space
Coast Sportfishing Foundation. "Everybody knows that."</TE>
<TE>   Government officials who regulate fishing say they have little
choice but to set up the ocean equivalent of wilderness areas to
protect disappearing wildlife. Fish stocks have fallen too low.
Traditional measures, such as limiting catches or limiting the size
of fish taken, have failed to halt the slide.</TE>
<TE>   Without establishing safe havens for breeding stock, regulators
say, there will be little left for future generations to catch.</TE>
<TE>   This is considered particularly true for California's largely
sedentary, bottom-dwelling rockfish, which are slow to reproduce.
Federal officials stepped in July 1 to close 8,500 square miles of
California's continental shelf to fishing for rockfish and ling
cod--an emergency action to keep these species from edging toward
extinction.</TE>
<TE>   What's happening off California makes the abundance of big fish
around Cape Canaveral all the more remarkable. Near the space center,
anglers say, the fishing has never been better, although they don't
always agree on why.</TE>
<TE>   James Bohnsack, a research biologist with the National Marine
Fisheries Service in Miami, said these fully protected areas function
like natural hatcheries, spilling out offspring and adults to restock
surrounding areas.</TE>
<TE>   One study of which he was co-author shows that the marine reserve
around the Kennedy Space Center is teeming with two to 12 times as
many fish as the adjacent waters, depending on the species, and that
the fish are much older and larger.</TE>
<TE>   A follow-up study shows that the best anglers have learned to turn
this protected bounty to their advantage by working the edges. The
number of world record catches of redfish, black drum, spotted sea
trout and common snook are higher in the waters adjacent to Cape
Canaveral than anywhere else.</TE>
<TE>   "The data was collected by recreational fishermen themselves,"
said Bohnsack, who is weary of debates over marine reserves. "If I
collected it, they would say I'm biased and I made it up. Their own
data shows the benefits."</TE>
<TE>   Troy Perez has benefited more than most from the fertile waters
around Kennedy Space Center.</TE>
<TE>   A man of few words, Perez has a reputation for reeling in some of
the biggest fish ever caught on light tackle and then quietly sending
off the records to the International Game Fish Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Enormous fish, stuffed and mounted, line the walls of his den--all
caught in the waters near Cape Canaveral. Word of the records spread
and fishermen now flock to the Cape Canaveral area, lured by the
prospect of landing a big redfish, also known as red drum for their
booming grunt. Redfish were nearly wiped out elsewhere during the
"blackened redfish" dining craze of the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Like other locals, Perez, 39, has long accepted the closing of the
cape area, which was first imposed in 1962, before he was born. But
he is irked that the restricted zone has been expanded in recent
years to protect manatees--slow-moving, half-ton marine mammals--from
boat propellers and, more recently, to enlarge the security buffer
against possible terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledges that these waters, unlike most other places, have
remarkable fishing.</TE>
<TE>   Are the biologists right? Can this be attributed to closed areas?</TE>
<TE>   No way, he says. He attributes the return of the redfish to
Florida's 1995 ban on commercial gill nets and to the strict limits
that allow a recreational angler to take home just one fish between
18 inches and 27 inches long. He doesn't buy the idea that the
protected area has helped replenish the surrounding waters.</TE>
<TE>   So, if Perez were in charge, would he open the waters that have
been untouched for 40 years?</TE>
<TE>   "No."</TE>
<TE>   Why not?</TE>
<TE>   "Better to leave it the way it is."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Twyford understands such thinking, though he disagrees. As
executive director of the 1,400-member West Palm Beach Fishing Club,
he said recreational fishermen worry about being steam-rolled by
bureaucrats and environmentalists and losing what they love to do.</TE>
<TE>   Twyford broke ranks two years ago, writing an article in the
club's "Tight Lines Bulletin" urging support of the 180-square-mile
Tortugas Ecological Reserve in the Florida Keys, which was
established last July.</TE>
<TE>   He argued that there are simply too many fishermen chasing too few
fish. Many recreational fishermen argue that "I'm only one boat and I
don't have any impact," Twyford said. "We have millions of people
and, collectively, we have a significant impact." Government
officials say their experience in the Florida Keys and around Cape
Canaveral offers a model for what they are trying to do in the
Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary off Southern California.
State officials in December are to decide whether to set aside 25% of
the waters around the islands as no-take zones.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot get people to rally around this, particularly those
who are going to benefit the most," said Billy Causey, superintendent
of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Peer pressure, he
said, stifles public support from fish trappers, commercial trawlers
and recreational anglers.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, opposition wanes over time. It has been years
since he has been hanged in effigy. More encouraging is that
once-hostile fishermen now approach him in the supermarket to confide
their pleasure at the signs of fish renewal.</TE>
<TE>   "People who were previously in my face are now coming back to me
saying, 'They are working,' " Causey said, about marine reserves.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists know that some species rebound quickly, while others
take time. In New England, the collapse of the cod fishery prompted
sweeping closures in 1994 on the Georges Bank. Eight years later, cod
and other ground fish there continue to struggle. But the sea scallop
population showed a 14-fold increase in the first four years, and
individual animals were much larger.</TE>
<TE>   Size matters for fish. Both fish and shellfish produce far more
eggs as they grow older and larger.</TE>
<TE>   That's why scientists are so intrigued by creating safe harbors
for fish, so they have a chance to mature and repopulate.</TE>
<TE>   More than 160 prominent marine scientists threw their support last
year behind reserves to reduce the possibility of extinction for
marine life and to rebuild depleted fisheries. Not only are reserves
good for fish, scientists concluded, but they are good for fishermen
too.</TE>
<TE>   But the American Sportsfishing Assn., which has declared war on
the marine reserve movement, hired Robert Shipp, chairman of marine
sciences at the University of South Alabama, to do a different kind
of study.</TE>
<TE>   He concluded that marine reserves would not help 98% of 350
different types of fish he examined because they would simply swim
out of protected waters. .</TE>
<TE>   Other scientists agree that reserves will not conserve highly
migratory fish, such as tuna or salmon.</TE>
<TE>   That's one of the reasons that the waters inside Kennedy Space
Center's security zone have long intrigued scientists. Redfish, which
often swim long distances, have tended to stay put, apparently
because the surrounding barrier islands don't make it easy for them
to migrate into the open ocean.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until the space shuttle Challenger blew up in 1986 that
marine scientists got NASA's permission to take a peek. With the
space program on hold, biologists were permitted to do a fish census.</TE>
<TE>   They were astounded by what they found. "Nowhere else have I seen
that kind of density," Bohnsack said. "It's an incredible
concentration of fish."</TE>
<TE>   Bohnsack dismisses fishermen's theories that the trophy catches
result from the 1995 ban on gill nets or regulations that limit
anglers to one fish in a specific size range.</TE>
<TE>   "These fish don't grow overnight," he said, noting that redfish
live to be 35 years old and black drum to 70 years. "It takes them a
while to reach record size.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the world records since the [Florida-wide]
gill-net ban in 1995, 18 out of 20 came out of the Cape Canaveral
area," he said. "Why just there? Why not elsewhere? The fishermen
ignore the best, simplest and most logical explanation."</TE>

<HD>Pond May Be Poisoned to Kill Chinese Snakeheads</HD>

<LD>MARYLAND</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   A panel of scientists has recommended poisoning a Crofton pond
that has become home to a breed of carnivorous Chinese fish to make
sure the fish don't escape and spread through Maryland's waterways.</LD>
<TE>   The 12-member panel agreed the state needs to take action to
eradicate the northern snakehead, which grows to more than 3 feet
long and feeds voraciously on other fish. Not doing anything would
risk throwing the natural ecosystem out of kilter, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The panel considered several ways to get rid of the fish,
including removing them through trapping, netting and electroshock.
However, those options would not ensure that every fish is killed.</TE>
<TE>   The most effective measure, the group tentatively said, was to
treat the pond with rotenone, which enters the fish through the gills
and disrupts the flow of oxygen.</TE>

<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>An 87,000-acre wildfire burned along a mile-long front Sunday,
threatening about 60 homes, and the number of firefighters assigned
to the blaze was nearly doubled.</LD>
<LD>   A voluntary evacuation order was in effect for the threatened
homes near Summer Lake, and several homes in the Silver Lake area
also were in danger, said David Widmark, a spokesman at the Northwest
Interagency Coordination Center.</LD>
<LD>   Officials dispatched an additional 800 firefighters to the blaze
Sunday, bringing the total force to about 2,000.</LD>
<TE>   National Guard troops are expected to arrive today. The blaze was
about 15% contained, Widmark said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to high winds and temperatures, firefighters have
faced a threat of electrical arcs as dense smoke creates short
circuits between the ground and Bonneville Power Administration
high-voltage lines in the area. Blue bolts of electricity from the
power lines have killed several cows, and firefighters won't go near
the lines.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, about 25 major fires active Sunday in Oregon had
burned a total of 216,000 acres, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Investing in Hope, at $50 a Share</HD>
<DH>An anonymous donor asks Indiana church members to do good
with envelopes of cash. The experience changes the takers and the
givers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The money in the white envelopes bought one cancer patient a
beautiful ham. It bought nine disabled children an afternoon of golf
and giggles.</LD>
<LD>   True, some money may have been squandered on an addict's high. But
it did buy an exhausted mother a massage.</LD>
<LD>   In $50 increments, the money in the white envelopes spread hope.
And it left some folks thinking they could make a difference in the
world.</LD>
<TE>   It started one Sunday when Linda McCoy, pastor of a free-spirited
church here called The Garden, preached about kindness--or as she put
it, sowing seeds of love. Then she held up 50 envelopes. An anonymous
donor had filled each with a $50 bill.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone could take one, no strings attached. All the donor asked
was that the money be used for good.</TE>
<TE>   "We can make this world a better place," McCoy told her
congregation. "What a wonderful adventure."</TE>
<TE>   Many who picked up the envelopes spent weeks pondering how best to
spend the $50. Some wrote checks to established charities. But others
were stirred to reach out directly to the needy. Teachers and
plumbers, therapists and nurses found themselves driving the streets
of Indianapolis, studying the worn faces they passed, looking for a
need they could meet.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to make a difference in someone's life," said Loretta
Johnson, an insurance underwriter.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, the envelopes made as much difference to the
givers as to the takers. The middle-age, middle-class members of the
congregation found themselves listening to strangers' hard-luck
stories with empathy this time instead of skepticism. The donor had
trusted them to use the money wisely. They took that trust and passed
it on.</TE>
<TE>   "The older I get, the more cynical I've gotten. I see what goes on
in the world, and I'm disgusted. But this project helped me see
there's still hope," said Carol Meeks, a home economist who used the
money to grow a huge garden that will provide fresh produce for the
hungry.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, we're too focused on what's wrong with other people.
This project encouraged you to see the good in them," added Mary Jane
Mesmer, a business consultant. She gave the money to an Amish family
that a friend had met by chance in a hospital coffee shop. The
family, from rural Indiana, had come to the city for their son's
kidney transplant and seemed bewildered and afraid. Mesmer thought
they could use a stranger's kindness.</TE>
<TE>   Over and over throughout the project, such kindness proved
contagious.</TE>
<TE>   Many participants easily tripled or quadrupled the $50 as friends,
touched by the donor's generosity, opened their own wallets. Dee
Caldwell, a real estate agent, raised $325 to take 40 low-income kids
to play with the baby animals on her farm. Nurse Patty Fredenburgh
raised so much money for her Special Olympics golf tournament that
she's buying the children team T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   The phenomenon of one good turn sparking another is rooted in our
psychology.</TE>
<TE>   When we see someone do a good deed--such as an anonymous donor
filling 50 envelopes with cash--it elevates our view of human nature.
That elevation can produce physical changes: The proverbial lump in
the throat or tightness in the chest. It also triggers altruism. Once
elevated, people often feel inspired to do their own good deeds,
according to Jon Haidt, a psychology professor at the University of
Virginia who has spent years studying this reaction.</TE>
<TE>   Haidt calls The Garden's project a "brilliant" way to leverage
elevation by creating an ever-expanding chain of goodwill.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the most effective uses of $2,500 that I've ever
heard," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Not that elevation is always instant. Donna Hoffman, for instance,
thought seriously about keeping the $50. A single mom who drives a
school bus, cleans houses and is writing an inspirational novel about
angels, Hoffman figured she deserved the cash.</TE>
<TE>   She kept the envelope for several weeks. It didn't feel right.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept thinking, 'You know what? I'm rich,' " Hoffman said. "I'm
rich in my heart because I have an opportunity to do something with
this money." She gave it to a friend, Pam Burleson, who cares for a
brain-damaged son.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really, really touched," Burleson said. So was Hoffman, who
proudly reports that "the world now feels a little smaller, a little
less frightening."</TE>
<TE>   Other members of the congregation also struggled with the $50--not
because they were tempted to pocket the money, but because it was
hard for them to get past the mind-set that philanthropy meant
writing a check to a tax-exempt nonprofit group.</TE>
<TE>   After consulting with their two sons, Nancy and Peter Howe gave
the $50 (and a sizable contribution of their own) to a single mother
whose only child is battling leukemia--and who has difficulty finding
the cash to buy gas for her daily trips to visit him in the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think writing a check to the American Cancer Society is a
wonderful thing, but this ... had so much more meaning," said Nancy
Howe, a mental-health counselor. "We want to do more of it."</TE>
<TE>   Already, she has signed up her family to build Habitat for
Humanity homes. And Howe recently gave her son's old trumpet to a
child who could not afford one, instead of selling it for several
hundred dollars, as she had planned.</TE>
<TE>   Similar stories of epiphany have been buzzing through The Garden
in the three months since McCoy handed out the white envelopes.</TE>
<TE>   Church services at The Garden are often memorable, as McCoy spices
her sermons with video clips from "The Simpsons" or pop songs
performed live by the 12-piece Good Earth Band. The 800-member
congregation prays in a dinner theater in a residential neighborhood
in northwest Indianapolis. The Gardeners munch bagels as McCoy
preaches--and rush to set up tables for the Beef &amp; Board's Sunday
matinee after the last amen.</TE>
<TE>   Even by The Garden's standards, however, the "seeds of love"
campaign was extraordinary. After distributing the envelopes, McCoy
devoted her next four sermons to the subject of giving.</TE>
<TE>   She showed clips from the movie "Pay It Forward," in which a
12-year-old boy sets out to change the world by doing good deeds for
three people and asking them each to show kindness to three others in
turn. She also videotaped congregation members talking about how the
project affected them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been so interesting to see the little ways in which people
are now more aware of the needs and hurts around them," McCoy said.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Schroeder had his awakening when he took a moment to notice a
beaten-down beggar by the roadside. Schroeder, a real estate agent,
had always turned his face from such scenes, reasoning that he did
not want to give away money that would only be spent on drugs or
booze. This time, though, he did not hesitate.</TE>
<TE>   He rolled down his car window and handed the beggar the $50 bill.
"Just try to use it wisely," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The man looked at the bill.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoa!" he said. "That'll get me a bus ticket home."</TE>
<TE>   "I drove away with a pretty wide grin on my face," Schroeder said.
"I'll never know if he really used it for a bus ticket. But I
realized that the spirit of giving is just to give--not necessarily
to question how it's going to be spent. It's my duty to share."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Schroeder has given often to panhandlers. "If you
plant a seed," he explained, "maybe it will grow."</TE>
<TE>   The interest in one-on-one giving that surged among The Garden's
congregation reflects a national trend.</TE>
<TE>   Americans still donate billions to charities each year. But
instead of writing checks for nonprofits to use as they please, more
and more donors are dictating how the money must be spent--even if
they're giving only a little.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a questioning of charitable institutions," said Phyllis
Freedman, who advises nonprofit groups such as Easter Seals as an
executive vice president with the Epsilon consulting firm. "People
are more concerned about helping their neighbors. The boomer
generation, especially, wants to be directly engaged."</TE>
<TE>   The Internet makes such direct philanthropy easy. One Web site,
DonorsChoose, lists school projects that need funding, from art
supplies to field trips. Another site, ModestNeeds, takes requests
from families desperate for $300 to pay an overdue electric bill or
$30 to buy a college textbook. Donors answer scores of these pleas
each month. Sometimes they get a receipt to prove that their money is
going to a worthy cause. Other times, they just take it on faith.</TE>
<TE>   "It's empowering to be able to lift someone's spirits. It's an
incredible feeling," said Barbara Gates, who spreads the gospel of
good deeds through the Random Acts of Kindness Foundation, which
gives away booklets explaining how to make the world a better place.</TE>
<TE>   Far from feeling shame at needing charity, recipients are often
uplifted as well.</TE>
<TE>   One member of the congregation recalled the day, decades ago, when
she came home from work to find $100 tucked into her mailbox. At the
time, she had been scraping to raise three kids on her own. The
anonymous gift bought several weeks' worth of groceries. And it
buoyed her spirits to know that someone had noticed her need--and had
taken the time to help.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always more blessed to give than to receive," she said. "But
when you need and someone gives, it's really, really nice."</TE>
<TE>   The woman, who asked that her name not be used, paid that old
kindness forward by slipping her white envelope under the door of
another single mother.</TE>
<TE>   As The Garden's experiment in philanthropy draws to a close, the
donor who launched it is thrilled.</TE>
<TE>   A self-described "child of the Depression," accustomed to
scrimping, the donor said she found it hard to give away so much
money all at once. It was especially tough to hand it to
strangers--who, for all she knew, might blow it on a steak dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Yet she filled all 50 envelopes, hoping the jolt of such an
unusual gift would make folks look at the world a little differently.
She made the donation anonymously to keep the focus away from her.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too easy to write a check to the American Red Cross at
Christmas and feel self-righteous. It's too easy to feel good about
yourself without giving anything of yourself," the donor said. "I
wanted to make an effort to engage people, to show them that they
could go out and do God's work."</TE>
<TE>   The experiment succeeded beyond her dreams. Whether they were
taking a lonely Alzheimer's patient out to lunch or weeding the
tomatoes they had grown to feed the hungry, members of The Garden
became engaged.</TE>
<TE>   They opened their hearts. So did the donor.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned," she said, "to trust."</TE>

<KH>Ronald Brownstein WASHINGTON OUTLOOK</KH>
<HD>The Prescription Drug Plan That Is Eating Washington</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Helping more seniors afford prescription drugs is a worthwhile
national goal. But is it the only worthwhile goal?</LD>
<LD>   Senate Democrats this week are pushing for a vote on a proposal
that elevates prescription drugs for seniors over all other domestic
needs. The plan is so expensive that if it ever passed, it could
squeeze out the party's other priorities--such as education or health
coverage for the uninsured--for years. Compounding the problem, the
Senate Democrats haven't identified how they would pay for this big
new expense because they are still unwilling to challenge President
Bush's huge tax cut. More spending on the elderly, and less revenue
because of the tax cut--at a time when the war on terrorism is
already straining the federal budget--is a recipe for big new
deficits or for a debilitating shortfall in other domestic programs.
Or most likely, both.</LD>
<TE>   The Democratic prescription drug bill on the Senate floor is the
culmination of a political bidding war that began in 2000. In that
year's budget, President Clinton proposed to update Medicare by
adding a prescription drug benefit. Virtually everyone in both
parties now agrees that's a reasonable goal given the growing
importance of drugs in health care. The question is how many seniors
can Washington afford to help, and how much can it afford to help
them--especially when the number of elderly Americans will soar over
the next decade as baby boomers start to retire.</TE>
<TE>   Conscious of that approaching gray wave, and of the demand of
competing priorities, Clinton kept his ambitions realistic. In return
for a monthly premium (which would start at $24 and roughly double
over a decade), he said Washington would pay half the cost of
prescription drugs for seniors until each side spent $2,500 a year;
after that, the small percentage of seniors with greater drug costs
would be on their own. Deeper subsidies would be available for the
lowest-income seniors.</TE>
<TE>   Al Gore first raised the ante in his 2000 campaign. He kept the
basic Clinton structure but added a "catastrophic" benefit, insisting
that Washington pick up all the cost for drugs after any senior had
spent $4,000 a year. At times, Gore touted his prescription drug plan
so heavily that he sometimes seemed to be running for president of a
Century Village. But in the end, the bet came up empty: Gore carried
seniors by only four percentage points in 2000, a margin no greater
than Clinton's in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   From that performance, Democrats might have concluded that
prescription drugs weren't as potent a vote magnet as they believed.
Instead, one party policy expert notes, they decided they "had to
sweeten the benefit" to win over more seniors. Thus the bill from
Democratic Sens. Bob Graham of Florida, Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts and Zell Miller of Georgia that would shift much more
of the overall drug cost to government than would Clinton (or Gore):
$500 billion over the next seven years.</TE>
<TE>   That's daunting enough when Washington is already looking at big
deficits in its operating budget. But the near-term cost of all the
prescription drug plans is only the tip of the iceberg. As the baby
boom retires, the number of seniors will explode from 40 million to
70 million just from 2010 to 2030. Kenneth E. Thorpe, a former
Clinton health official, projects that any prescription drug plan
will cost nearly three times as much in its second decade as its
first.</TE>
<TE>   Keep in mind that even without a new prescription benefit, the
baby boom's retirement will force enormous increases in federal
spending on the elderly. And Washington will be confronting these
higher costs even as its revenue is shrinking under the full effect
of Bush's tax cut, whose costs also mushroom in its second decade.</TE>
<TE>   By ignoring these big facts, Congress is producing a fantasyland
debate. Neither the Senate Democrats--nor the House Republicans, who
passed a more modest plan earlier this year--will acknowledge the
obvious: Unless they retrench the tax cut, it will be virtually
impossible to fulfill the promises they are making to seniors without
raiding Social Security or increasing the national debt.</TE>
<TE>   The debate is also obscuring a second trade-off--one most
pertinent to Democrats as the party more committed to an activist
federal government. Do Democrats really want to devote so much of the
federal government's limited wallet to this one problem? Expanding
access to preschool, rebuilding crumbling schools and providing
health insurance for some of the roughly 40 million Americans without
it--should subsidizing prescription drugs for seniors crowd out those
other needs?</TE>
<TE>   Many seniors unquestionably need help in buying drugs. But
two-thirds of seniors now pay less than $1,000 from their own pockets
for prescription drugs; just 9% face costs of $3,000 or more
annually. And the percentage of seniors in poverty (10%) is still
much smaller than the share of children (16%). Yet no one is talking
about throwing half a trillion dollars at kids.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean Washington should ignore seniors in need. But it
does mean the government needs to emphasize cost-containment in any
plan it writes and target the aid precisely at those who need it
most, something the Democratic plan refuses to do by rejecting
greater cost-sharing for more affluent seniors. It also means that
the final plan, like the original Clinton proposal, shouldn't be so
generous that it precludes spending on other problems.</TE>
<TE>   Washington won't need to resolve these trade-offs any time soon.
It will be difficult for the Democratic plan to attract the 60 votes
it needs to overcome parliamentary objections in the Senate. And even
if it does, the Senate and House are unlikely to bridge their
differences on how to structure the benefit this year.</TE>
<TE>   That's probably for the best. Congress and the White House need
more time to consider whether the nation can afford such an expensive
promise when the number of seniors around to collect on it will soon
grow so rapidly. Dan Crippen, the outgoing director of the
Congressional Budget Office, brilliantly crystallized the question
that ought to guide this debate when he recently told the National
Journal: "Even if we can afford--and we probably can--a drug benefit
for our parents, the question is: Can our kids afford it for us?"</TE>

<HD>Land Battle Splits Shoshone Nation</HD>
<DH>Compensation: Most members want their share of $140 million
the U.S. may pay the tribe for its territory. Others want to keep
fighting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CRESCENT VALLEY, Nev.</DL>
<LD>Though weary from a 30-year struggle, sisters Carrie and Mary Dann
remain hopeful they can keep ancestral Western Shoshone lands in the
hands of the Indian nation. But far from their dusty ranch here, an
upcoming vote in Washington is expected to end their crusade.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate is considering disbursement of nearly $140 million to
the tribe for land the government says the Indians lost 130 years
ago. In the meantime, the Danns continue to run cattle and horses on
the disputed land without paying grazing fees--as other Indians have,
claiming the land is still theirs.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is about 24 million acres of historic Shoshone land, a
swath of desert and mountains from the Great Salt Lake, across most
of Nevada, and into California's Death Valley.</LD>
<TE>   The Danns and other traditional Shoshone Indians--as well as a
host of historians, attorneys and international human rights
commissions--note that the tribe never ceded its territory to the
U.S. government nor lost it to Western conquest.</TE>
<TE>   But a congressional commission summarily declared in 1959 that the
Shoshones had lost their land to encroaching pioneers in 1872. The
Danns and their allies say they were blindsided by a bureaucratic
ambush more contemptible than any act of violence.</TE>
<TE>   Carrie and Mary Dann, who won't give their ages but whose
deep-creased faces betray at least six decades of hard life running
cattle and horses, say distribution of the money will all but end any
hope they have of retaining the land. Their claim to the land has
been dismissed by the Supreme Court but is supported by human rights
commissions sponsored by the United Nations and the Organization of
American States.</TE>
<TE>   The sisters are mad that apparently most of their fellow Shoshone
Indians want the money, which would amount to about $20,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   "What's $20,000?" asks Carrie Dann, the younger of the two women.
"I'm looking at the future of our children. I'm looking at our
birthright, which is not for sale."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has sponsored a bill authorizing the
money's release. The Senate's Indian Affairs Committee will hear
debate on the bill Aug. 2. Since 1977, the $26 million set aside to
reimburse Shoshones for their land and lost mining revenue has
increased, with interest, to nearly $140 million.</TE>
<TE>   Reid, who sits on the committee, said he has sympathy for the
Danns and others who resist losing their land. "But this matter has
been through the court system, and the vast majority of the
Shoshones--whether you think it is unfair or fair--want their money."</TE>
<TE>   Felix Ike is one of those who wants the money. Ike, chairman of
the Te-Moak Tribe of Western Shoshones, the largest of the various
tribes and bands that constitute the Indian nation, said he doesn't
share the same passion for the land as do the Danns. "Yes, there's a
case to undo the wrongs done to the indigenous people," he said. "We
were shafted. But now we have to move on."</TE>
<TE>   Although three polls have indicated that a majority of the
estimated 6,000 Western Shoshone Nation members want their money,
others such as Mary Gibson, 45, say they are standing on principle.</TE>
<TE>   "The money is dirty money, money that the government wants to pass
off on us because it has a bad conscience," said Gibson, who works at
the Elko County Library. "But I don't want to sell myself out."</TE>
<TE>   Yet her own daughter, she said, wants the money to buy a car. She
said her daughter doesn't understand the issues, which are virtually
unprecedented in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   In 1863, Shoshone Indians signed the Treaty of Ruby Valley
promising peace and friendship to white settlers and travelers bound
for California. These newcomers could hunt, mine, cut timber, run
railroads, even establish towns. But nothing was said about Indians
giving up their land.</TE>
<TE>   In 1946, Congress established the Indian Claims Commission to
compensate Indians for lands taken during the westward march,
intending to correct century-old wrongs.</TE>
<TE>   In 1951 a Shoshone band made such a claim for the land under
dispute today, even though the government acknowledged that the band
did not speak for all Shoshones.</TE>
<TE>   The government in 1962 concluded that Shoshone land had been lost
to whites nine years after the Ruby Valley treaty was signed. Later,
the Indian Claims Commission authorized payment of 15 cents per
acre--the value of the land in 1872, just before gold and silver
mining exploded across Nevada, dramatically increasing the land's
value. The money was placed in a trust account in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Shoshone activists protested, and a U.S. District Court judge
sided with them, noting that there had been no act of Congress nor
treaty that transferred the land from the Shoshones to the federal
government. It was almost as if, some observers have noted, the
government had realized it had never acquired the Shoshone Indian
territory and was now belatedly trying to take it.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. Supreme Court in 1985, on appeal, ruled that because
the government had already put the land money in an Indian trust fund
for disbursement, their rights to the land had been extinguished.</TE>
<TE>   The court did not address the initial claims commission's actions,
but rather was responding to litigation over the Dann sisters'
refusal to pay livestock grazing fees to the government.</TE>
<TE>   The Danns were not alone. In May, the Bureau of Land Management
seized about 130 head of cattle from Raymond Yowell, chief of the
Western Shoshone National Council. It claims to represent all
Shoshone Indians but is not recognized by the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   "If the government can show me a piece of paper that shows that we
ceded or sold it to them, I'll change my argument," said Yowell, who
had been running cattle for 18 years near Elko and now faces about
$500,000 in grazing fees and penalties.</TE>
<TE>   To this day, the Dann sisters--living on 800 acres their parents
acquired through a combination of homesteading and purchase from the
railroad--continue to graze livestock on public land. The BLM
continues to threaten to impound their animals--as it did 10 years
ago--and has fined the sisters more than $2 million for past grazing
fees, penalties and interest. BLM officials say more seizures are
imminent, and the Danns still refuse to pay.</TE>
<TE>   "Why should we?" asks Carrie Dann. "The land is ours."</TE>
<TE>   The sisters feel comforted by the United Nations' Committee on the
Elimination of Racial Discrimination. In August, the committee
expressed "concern" that plans for expanded mining and nuclear waste
storage on Western Shoshone ancestral land (at Yucca Mountain) were
"affecting the rights of indigenous peoples."</TE>
<TE>   The Danns hope the attention being given to their situation will
persuade the government to rethink its position before the Senate
disburses the money.</TE>
<TE>   They know that realistically all the land cannot be returned to
the tribe, given the development of towns and cities and mining that
has made the land within view of their home the richest gold source
in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   But they say that some of the land can be returned for their
exclusive use, as was done for the Timbisha Shoshone Indians of Death
Valley, who after years of struggle were awarded 7,600 acres of
National Park Service land in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Danns also believe the tribe should be awarded a small royalty
for the gold and other metals and minerals mined from their
aboriginal territory, and that it should be allowed to graze animals
freely.</TE>
<TE>   "This land represents life for us and our future generations,"
Carrie Dann said. "It is our umbilical cord, our attachment, to Earth
Mother. We cannot separate ourselves from life."</TE>

<HD>Black Americans Making Gains in Equality, Urban League Says</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In areas ranging from jobs to homeownership to politics, blacks
continue to make gains, but equality with whites remains a far-off
goal, the National Urban League says in its annual report on the
state of black America.</LD>
<LD>   "When you look at the data, yes, we have made substantial headway,
but there are still--without a shadow of a doubt--substantial gaps in
every category, every vital sign," said Urban League President Hugh
Price.</LD>
<LD>   The report, a collection of essays written by experts in fields
such as labor and civil rights, is intended to capture a snapshot of
blacks in America. The first one was published in 1976.</LD>
<TE>   Among the authors' findings:</TE>
<TE>   * During the 1990s, black unemployment fell to its lowest level in
30 years. The rate of poverty among black families fell to 26%, the
lowest on record.</TE>
<TE>   * Blacks are about twice as likely to hold lower-paying service
jobs. About 20% of blacks hold professional or managerial jobs; more
than 30% of whites do.</TE>

<LD>   Question:  Do any of the products advertised on the Internet for
removing cellulite work?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Absolutely not, according to Quackwatch
(www.quackwatch.com).</LD>
<TE>   Cellulite is a made-up word to describe deposits of dimpled fat
found on the thighs and buttocks.</TE>
<TE>   Although this fat may be interspersed with strands of fibrous
tissue, it is really no different from fat anywhere else in the body.
No drugs or herbal products taken by mouth or applied to the skin
will reduce fat anywhere else in the body, so there is no reason to
think that they will specifically attack cellulite. The only way to
get rid of cellulite, as with fat elsewhere, is by diet and exercise.</TE>

<LD>   A mild winter and hot, dry weather since the spring have sped up
the maturation of some grasshopper species and allowed more of the
insects and their eggs to survive the cold. The drought also has cut
into the population of birds and rodents that prey on grasshoppers,

<LD>   Adding an extra version of a single gene makes mice grow big
brains--brains so large they have to fold up, much as human brains
do, to fit inside the skull, researchers said. It is not yet clear
whether the mice are smarter (they were all killed soon after birth),
but the scientists said they were surprised that one gene had such a
strong effect and said they would conduct further experiments.</LD>
<LD>   "I know the most interesting question was whether they learned to
play Mozart, but we don't know," said Dr. Christopher Walsh of
Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston,
who led the study.</LD>
<TE>   Walsh and Anjen Chenn started with a protein called beta-catenin,
which helps control cell division. Walsh and Chenn genetically
engineered mice, adding extra beta-catenin that would become
overactive specifically in brain tissue.</TE>
<TE>   To their surprise, they reported in Friday's issue of the journal
Science, the mice developed large, folded brains that looked like
human brains. Mouse brains normally have a smooth surface.</TE>

<HD>Shining Light on Monarchs' Migration</HD>
<DH>Some theorize the butterflies use the sun or the Earth's
magnetic field. Two scientists, using a tethering system, think they
know.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY SINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every fall, eastern monarch butterflies start an epic expedition,
flying up to 3,000 miles south to the mountains of Mexico. They will
spend the winter in suspended animation and six months later start
the journey north again.</LD>
<LD>   This unusual migration, whose extreme length and duration is more
characteristic of birds than insects, has been one of the tantalizing
mysteries of entomology.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers have long debated if monarchs use the sun, the Earth's
magnetic field or some other unknown phenomena as their guide. The
sun has been the primary candidate--an obvious but unreliable source
of directional information. How can the sun, with its daily trek
across the sky, be an efficient compass? And how can a sun compass
function on rainy days, a common occurrence during the butterfly's
fall migration?</LD>
<TE>   Two scientists from Canada and Germany believe they have found the
solution. Using a technique to tether butterflies in flight, the duo
has determined that monarchs navigate with the sun using a complex
system that compensates for time of day as the sun changes its
position.</TE>
<TE>   The study focused on the migration of monarch butterflies that
begin their journey in Canada, but the finding should apply to most
monarch populations. The method "captures the essence of migratory
behavior," said Barrie Frost, principal scientist on the study and a
professor of physiology at Queen's University in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln P. Brower, a leading monarch expert and professor at Sweet
Briar College in Virginia, said Frost's technique opens a new realm
of possibilities for studying butterfly behavior. Previously,
scientists studied monarch navigation by capturing them and then
observing their flight after release.</TE>
<TE>   There are "so many natural variables that can affect their
behavior," said Brower. "We tried everything under the sun--kept them
in coolers, poked them to fly." But when monarchs are provoked to
fly, they don't behave naturally, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Brower called Frost's tethering system "an innovative method to
get directionality of butterfly behavior under controlled
conditions."</TE>
<TE>   Monarchs begin their migration in the late summer and early fall,
when shorter days and cooler temperatures signal that it is time to
head south. During the journey, monarchs stop breeding and put on
weight. They build up fat by drinking nectar from flowers during
their journey.</TE>
<TE>   Monarchs west of the Rocky Mountains have a relatively short
migration, traveling to wintering sites along the California coast.</TE>
<TE>   The eastern monarchs studied by Frost fly 1,000 to 3,000 miles,
gathering at the same 14 high-mountain spots in the fir forests of
central Mexico. They spend the winter in "cold storage," said Brower,
waiting to mate and lay eggs the following spring.</TE>
<TE>   The same monarchs fly partway back north the next March, stopping
to lay eggs on new milkweeds, the plant that nourishes the young
caterpillars after hatching. Each successive spring generation moves
farther north, following the budding milkweed and living only for a
month or two.</TE>
<TE>   How does the sun help monarchs find their way back and forth
across the continent? Frost says there are different strategies for
using the sun as a compass.</TE>
<TE>   If you always kept the sun in front of you, you would make a
general arc, going east in the morning, then south, then west in the
afternoon, Frost said. The average direction is south, but, as Frost
points out, this is not a very efficient method.</TE>
<TE>   A more economical approach, Frost said, would be to change
direction relative to the sun and the time of day--a time-compensated
sun compass.</TE>
<TE>   To use this navigation strategy, the monarch must possess both an
internal clock and map. The butterfly would know that in the morning,
the sun is in the eastern part of the sky. To head south, the
butterfly would face the sun and turn right, Frost said.</TE>
<TE>   Frost and his collaborator, Henrik Mouritsen of the University of
Oldenburg in Germany, designed a unique contraption to figure out
which strategy the monarch is using.</TE>
<TE>   A wire stalk was glued to the back of the butterfly, while a
gentle stream of air was blown beneath it to encourage the insect to
flap its wings and fly. The insect is free to steer its movement but
is tethered in one location.</TE>
<TE>   A small sensor attached to the butterfly's wire keeps track of the
direction the insect is headed, allowing the scientists to re-create
the path of the monarch as if it were flying free.</TE>
<TE>   Frost and Mouritsen captured Canadian monarchs in the fall, during
the pre-migration period called "diapause." After being tethered and
placed outside, they immediately oriented toward the southwest--the
same direction they would go on their journey from Canada to Mexico.
The butterflies flew just 1 degree off from the course leading to
their Mexican wintering grounds.</TE>
<TE>   To test their time-compensated hypothesis, Frost and Mouritsen
gave the butterflies jet lag. Monarchs were kept indoors and exposed
to either an early schedule of light, 1 a.m. to 1 p.m., or a late
schedule, 1 p.m. to 1 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The duo hypothesized that when taken outdoors, the jet-lagged
monarchs would orient themselves in the opposite direction.
Butterflies on an early schedule headed northwest, just as expected
for an insect that mistook the afternoon sun for early morning.
Butterflies on the late schedule did just the opposite, flying
southeast.</TE>
<TE>   Frost said the beauty of their experiment is that it allowed them
to track the flight of the monarchs over a long period of time,
simulating an enormous distance.</TE>
<TE>   "Some have covered 30 miles. A few flew for four hours, covering
the equivalent of 100 miles," he said. "This is a much longer
distance than you could track outside, and you have a detailed record
of every turn."</TE>
<TE>   Monarch expert Brower hopes to use the contraption to test one of
his own theories that monarchs are in migratory mode throughout the
year.</TE>
<TE>   Brower points out that monarchs fly south every winter and then
six months later turn around and go north--a 180-degree change in
direction over 180 days. So he proposes that there is a "directional
clock" in the butterfly that advances the migratory direction 1
degree clockwise per day.</TE>
<TE>   "The clock ticks through every day during every stage;
caterpillar, pupae and butterfly," Brower said.</TE>
<TE>   Butterflies leaving Mexico in March would have a clock oriented
north. By late April, they arrive in Texas to breed. The directional
clock would tick over the next month so that the next generation
would leave in May headed northeast. By June the butterflies would be
oriented toward the east. By September, the clock would have ticked
360 degrees, pointing the butterflies south once again.</TE>
<TE>   "There is currently no direct evidence for the theory, but it fits
what we know about migration," Brower said. He hopes to test his
hypothesis using the tethering apparatus on butterflies captured at
different stages in their migration.</TE>
<TE>   The butterfly tether has helped scientists understand another
mystery of the monarch's epic journey south: If the monarch uses a
sun compass, how can it find its way on cloudy days?</TE>
<TE>   Some scientists thought the butterflies used the Earth's magnetic
field to guide them. Frost and Mouritsen's findings dispel this idea:
Monarchs placed into an artificial magnetic field did not orient in
any particular direction. Nor did they change direction as the
magnetic field was turned, Frost said.</TE>
<TE>   Frost thinks that insects can tell where the sun is by the pattern
of polarization in sunlight.</TE>
<TE>   The sun hits the atmosphere at different angles during the day,
resulting in characteristic patterns of scattered light. Unlike
humans, insects can see these polarization patterns, Frost said. They
are still visible on overcast days, so monarchs may use them for
navigation.</TE>
<TE>   To test the idea, Frost and colleagues put a polarizing filter
over their butterfly contraption. The monarchs still knew where to
go.</TE>
<TE>   Frost and Mouritsen have shown us how monarchs can make their way
to Mexico, but one big question remains.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Oberhauser, a professor at the University of Minnesota who
also studies monarch migration, said that monarchs go to the same
over-wintering spot--within about 328 feet--year after year.</TE>
<TE>   "We still don't understand the fine details of how they know where
they are and how they get to the same spot year after year. Monarchs
must be using some other cues because they need more than a compass
and a clock to get to them."</TE>

<LD>This is the kind of good news/bad news story I love because it not
only sheds light on scientific fraud, it touches on everything from
corporate book-cooking to the Homeland Security Act, the 1st
Amendment, the practice of astronomy and the everyday act of looking
out the window.</LD>
<LD>   First, the bad news: Last year, the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory had to retract its previously announced discovery of new
elements 116 and 118 when no research group (including the group that
originally made the discovery) was able to duplicate the results.
Now, the lab's internal investigations have concluded this was not
simply a mistake. It was fraud. Someone faked the data, and was
fired.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the good news: It's the same as the bad news. This is
precisely how science is supposed to work. Because it is transparent,
cheaters get caught. (For the record, the accused scientist has filed
a grievance against the lab for wrongful termination.)</LD>
<TE>   Why wasn't the fraud caught sooner? Because transparency is not a
simple matter.</TE>
<TE>   Take the clothes you're wearing. Are they transparent? You'd
probably say no, unless you came to the breakfast table wrapped in
cellophane. But while your PJs may be opaque to the prying eyes of
your neighbors, they are quite transparent to radio signals, cosmic
rays or neutrinos. (Even a light-year's worth of solid lead is
transparent to neutrinos.)</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, your kitchen window, although it appears
transparent, is, in fact, opaque to ultraviolet light, which is why
you can't get a suntan indoors.</TE>
<TE>   Even on a clear day, the air itself is transparent only to a
narrow range of light--visible wavelengths, radio, and a bit of
infrared and ultraviolet. To see the full range of electromagnetic
radiation, telescopes have to go into space, where they can "see"
gamma rays, X-rays and the rest.</TE>
<TE>   (It's a good thing the atmosphere's ozone layer is opaque to most
UV radiation: If it weren't, we'd all be fried.)</TE>
<TE>   Only gravity manages to see through everything in the universe.
Nothing can hide from it, which is why gravity wave telescopes hold
such great promise. Light can't escape from black holes, but gravity
waves can and do. Just as gravity reaches inside your clothes to pull
on your underwear, so its signals travel to us undisturbed from the
very beginning of time and can tell us what happened in some detail
even during the big bang.</TE>
<TE>   Transparency is tricky. It depends on how you're looking and what
you're looking through. The Berkeley scientists got fooled by the
same incorrect assumption that leads some people to think they can
get a suntan through the window: something they thought was
transparent actually wasn't. In this case, it was the workings of
their own group.</TE>
<TE>   "There was extreme reliance on one individual because he was
considered to be the world's greatest expert in this area," said
deputy lab director Pier Oddone. "He was the heart and soul of
putting the experiment together. [Fraud] was the last thing anyone
would have expected."</TE>
<TE>   There was more. The results were too "pretty" to ignore, said
Oddone. They fit expectations so beautifully that no one believed
this wasn't Mother Nature's own artistry at work. If some computer
makes a mistake, Oddone said, "you don't expect the Mona Lisa to jump
out at you." The results were too wonderful not to be true.</TE>
<TE>   The combination of beautiful results and trust in a colleague,
Oddone said, led the scientists to be "absolutely seduced."</TE>
<TE>   It's all been embarrassing for Berkeley. But in the end, the very
transparency of science--the fact that no result is accepted unless
and until it is checked (and rechecked) by someone else--is what
keeps the enterprise strong.</TE>
<TE>   Just so, democracies protect transparency through everything from
a free press to citizens with video cameras keeping an eye on cops to
a guarantee of legal aid for those accused of breaking the law.</TE>
<TE>   Which is why people are troubled that Bush's proposed Homeland
Security Department would be exempt from the Freedom of Information
Act and provisions of the federal whistle-blower protection. Which is
also why, despite the threat of terrorism, people are uneasy with
secret military tribunals and the erosion of civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, ordinary American investors, such as the
Berkeley scientists, allowed themselves to be seduced by wishful
thinking and wonderful results: a soaring stock market in a booming
economy. We wanted to believe that corporate profits were honestly
reported, and so we did. It never occurred to us that things could be
so crooked right in our own backyards.</TE>
<TE>   Naked truth isn't always pretty, and glass houses are
uncomfortable for everyone. Even so, when it comes to public
institutions, the price of strength is often just such transparency.
It's worth a lot more than meets the eye.</TE>

<LD>Want to know the key to Garret Anderson's vault into All-Star play
these last couple of years? He had to slow down and take it easy.</LD>
<LD>   Try not to laugh--even though Anderson himself can see the humor
in a player who has been criticized for not caring or trying hard
enough seeking better results through relaxation. What's next: a
snail seeking a massage?</LD>
<LD>   Just listen to the rationale.</LD>
<TE>   "When I was younger, I always felt like everything was rushing,
every [pitch] was getting on me quick," Anderson said. "Now I'm
letting the game slow down and come to me more, because I trust my
hands, I trust my abilities.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first came up, I watched a lot of veteran hitters. It
looked like they were always waiting on the ball as opposed to going
out and trying to get it, rush it. That's what I think I'm starting
to get to in my career now."</TE>
<TE>   Early on, Anderson showed he was capable of getting about 180 hits
a season. It only seemed as if none of those hits mattered. They got
him on base, but they didn't drive in runs--especially when it
mattered most.</TE>
<TE>   Well, Anderson has averaged 120 runs batted in the last two years,
and he's on pace to do it again in his eighth big league season. As
far as importance, they don't get much more significant than his
seventh-inning double that drove in the go-ahead run in a 7-5 victory
over Seattle on Sunday that gave the Angels a series sweep and moved
them within a game of the first-place Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have the same number of losses as the Mariners and the
Boston Red Sox, currently their top competitors for the wild-card
spot.</TE>
<TE>   Sit back and marinate on that and what Anderson's hit
accomplished.</TE>
<TE>   "He's turning into an incredible clutch hitter," Angel Manager
Mike Scioscia said. "He's driving the ball to all fields. He's the
guy we want to set the table for. And when we do, he gets it done."</TE>
<TE>   OK, so maybe he doesn't get it done with much charisma. When Darin
Erstad slid across home plate following Anderson's double, he popped
up, pumped his fist and sprinted toward the dugout. Anderson,
standing at second, nonchalantly stared down at the ground, not
bothering to look at Erstad, his fired-up teammates or the cheering
fans at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   "We hadn't won the game yet," Anderson said. "Inside, yeah, I was
happy I did that. But I never want to let that other team know
whether or not I'm happy or mad. I just want to keep it the same
where nothing fazes me, so when I get in those situations they think
nothing fazes me."</TE>
<TE>   Mariner shortstop Desi Relaford came over, said a few words and
got Anderson to crack a smile. "He just told me I was swinging the
bat well," Anderson said. "I said, 'Thanks.' "</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's demeanor isn't just a front for the opposing team.
That's just how he is. All those years of playing in the outfield
next to the fiery Erstad and not much has changed about him.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely go about things different," Erstad said.
"Everybody's different. [Scioscia] always told me, it takes all
kinds. You've got to have all kinds of players.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have that, it's just a good balance. Guys can look up to
him, they can look up to me. Everybody doesn't have to conform to one
style of play."</TE>
<TE>   Balance. That's exactly what the Angels have right now. Not too
wild a clubhouse, not dreadfully dull. A good mix of hustle and big
bats in the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's game was a good case. They Angels had four doubles and a
triple among their 11 hits. They also scored their sixth run without
hitting the ball out of the infield. On a day when their most
dependable pitcher, Jarrod Washburn, was roughed up for eight hits
and five earned runs, their patchwork bullpen was better than
Seattle's.</TE>
<TE>   As Scioscia said: "To be championship-caliber, it's a blend of
things. It's not just attitude, it's talent."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have both. So does Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   "Garret's probably the most consistent player, year to year, that
I've seen," Scioscia said. "I think that the one number that really
sticks out on Garret--other than the production numbers, the RBIs and
all that--is the games played [all but three over the last 2 1/2
seasons, including every game this year]. This guy just keeps coming.
He just comes to play and you know what level he's going to play at."</TE>
<TE>   He has 76 RBIs now, enough to keep him among the American League's
top five. He leads the league in doubles with 36, and is hitting .299
batting with a team-high 18 home runs.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion, he's our rock," Erstad said. "He's the constant.
Regardless of whether he's doing good or bad, he's always the same.
He's that consistency in our lineup that you just have to have.</TE>
<TE>   "He takes a lot of heat. People say, 'Oh he's laid back, he
doesn't try.' That's just so far from the truth. He's shown what he's
capable of doing."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, they do it in a different manner. After the game, Erstad set
down his beer and put on jeans and a T-shirt. Anderson put on pressed
pants and a shirt and picked up his kid.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels used to be all about Erstad and his style. If they're
going to win this division, a central focus will be Anderson and his
bat. They'll still look to Erstad for motivation.</TE>
<TE>   "I just be myself," Erstad said. "Whatever that entails. I'll kick
a butt every once in a while. You know who to do that to, who doesn't
need it."</TE>
<TE>   What about Anderson?</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't need anything."</TE>
<TE>   Just let him be, and maybe even take a cue from him: Relax.</TE>

<HD>A's Help Improve Rangers' Fortune</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bad luck has followed the Texas Rangers since Alex Rodriguez joined
them before last season.</LD>
<LD>   When a big dose of good fortune helped the Rangers end their
eight-game losing streak Sunday with a remarkable victory, Rodriguez
hoped it was the start of a bigger change.</LD>
<LD>   Ivan Rodriguez drove in the go-ahead run with a bases-loaded
single in the top of the 12th inning and the Rangers survived three
consecutive innings of peril before rallying for a 7-3 victory over
the Athletics at Oakland.</LD>
<TE>   Gabe Kapler had a two-run single and Alex Rodriguez hit a
run-scoring triple in a five-run rally in the 12th, helping the
Rangers escape the Coliseum with only their second victory since the
All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   The final score made it look easy, but the 16 runners left on base
by the A's--including eight in the last three innings--suggested
otherwise. On nearly every key play, the Rangers got the break.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt so good to sneak one out," said Alex Rodriguez, who went
three for five. "I think we've hit rock bottom. It was nice to come
up with a big win. Hopefully, we're on the way up now. This could
change a lot of things for us."</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's injuries, inconsistent hitting or combustible relief
pitching, the Rangers know all about bad luck and wasted
opportunities. This time, however, it was the streaking A's who
didn't take advantage of their chances.</TE>
<TE>   The A's stranded two runners in the ninth and left the bases
loaded in the 10th and 11th.</TE>
<TE>   "We finally got some big outs when we needed them," Texas Manager
Jerry Narron said. "When you do that, you win ballgames."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 13, Cleveland 12--Raul Ibanez hit a tying, two-run
homer in the ninth inning, then was hit by a pitch with the bases
loaded in the 10th to lift the Royals at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Ibanez drove in five runs, giving him 33 runs batted in in 22
games.</TE>
<TE>   Milton Bradley went five for six with a homer, three doubles and
five RBIs for the Indians. The Indians finished with a season-high 20
hits, including three doubles by Einar Diaz.</TE>
<TE>   The Royals, who trailed, 6-1, in the second, took a 10-9 lead in
the sixth on Carlos Beltran's second grand slam this season and
fourth of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Magruder and Omar Vizquel led off the game with consecutive
home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 7, Toronto 5--Jorge Sosa earned his first major league
victory and ended the Devil Rays' 13-game road losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay's road skid was the longest since Philadelphia dropped
14 in a row in 1997. The Devil Rays hadn't won away from Tropicana
Field since June 18 at San Francisco. The Devil Rays had lost seven
in a row and 15 of 16.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Hinske and Chris Woodward homered for the Blue Jays, who had
won four in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Sosa (1-2) gave up three runs and six hits in six innings. The
24-year-old converted outfielder, in his first season above Class A,
struck out five and walked two in his fifth start.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 8, Baltimore 7--The White Sox took advantage of three
ninth-inning errors, including two by Chris Singleton, to score two
unearned runs at Baltimore and end a four-game skid.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Durham, Jose Valentin and Tony Graffanino homered for Chicago,
but the decisive runs came courtesy of the Baltimore miscues.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Gibbons hit two of Baltimore's four home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 4, Detroit 2--David Ortiz homered for the fourth time in
three games and the Twins completed a three-game sweep at Comerica
Park.</TE>
<TE>   The AL Central-leading Twins won their fifth consecutive game.
Detroit lost its sixth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz hit a solo home run, his 11th, to tie the score, 2-2, in the
fourth. He is 13 for 35 with six home runs and nine RBIs since the
All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Milton (12-7) gave up two runs and seven hits in seven
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Guardado pitched a scoreless ninth for his 32nd save.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Bullpen helps Washburn extend streak as Angels
sweep Mariners, 7-5.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Seattle Mariners might have one of the best bullpens in the
American League, but the Angels proved over the weekend that their
relief corps is increasingly reliable.</LD>
<LD>   Even without its closer.</LD>
<LD>   For the second game in a row, the Angels got an outstanding relief
effort from Brendan Donnelly, Scott Schoeneweis and Ben Weber and
they completed a sweep of the first-place Mariners with a 7-5 victory
Sunday before 34,945 at Edison Field.</LD>
<TE>   Left-hander Jarrod Washburn pitched seven innings and extended his
major-league leading winning streak to 12 games as the Angels pulled
within a game of the AL West lead by sweeping a three-game series
from the Mariners for the first time since June 16-18, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   With Oakland losing to Texas, the Angels assumed sole possession
of second place in the division heading into a three-game series with
the Athletics starting Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "They are definitely a completely different looking team from the
beginning of the year when they were scuffling," said Mariner second
baseman Bret Boone, who helped Seattle sweep the Angels in a
four-game series at Edison Field in April. "They are playing real
well and they are going to be tough.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to be an easy race. It's going to be a little bit
different from last year."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels (58-39) scored 29 runs and had 41 hits during the
series and improved to 19 games over .500 for the first time since
1995.</TE>
<TE>   Catcher Jose Molina had a career-high three hits and drove in a
run Sunday, Garret Anderson had two doubles and an RBI and Adam
Kennedy had two hits and an RBI. Tim Salmon, Darin Erstad, Brad
Fullmer and David Eckstein also drove in runs.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed to prove that we could play with this team, especially
with what happened against them early in the season," said Eckstein,
the Angel shortstop who started a two-run rally in the seventh inning
when he was hit by a pitch for a major-leading 16th time. "This is
definitely big for us, but we still have a long season left."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' hopes are buoyed by a bullpen that is without closer
Troy Percival and left-hander Dennis Cook, who are the disabled list.
In addition, set-up man Al Levine came off the disabled list Saturday
after missing 19 games.</TE>
<TE>   The committee concept worked to perfection Saturday in a 7-6
victory and it worked again Sunday after the Angels overcame a 4-0
fourth-inning deficit to take a 6-5 lead in the seventh on a
sacrifice fly by Salmon and a run-scoring double by Anderson against
reliever Jeff Nelson.</TE>
<TE>   Donnelly, who struck out five in 2 1/3 innings on Saturday,
replaced Washburn to start the eighth and struck out No. 3-hitter
Boone and Edgar Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia then summoned left-hander Schoeneweis
to face John Olerud for the second night in a row. Olerud had given
the Mariners a 5-4 lead in the sixth with his 17th home run. But just
as he did the night before against Schoeneweis, Olerud hit a ground
ball to first baseman Scott Spiezio for an out.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels added a run in the eighth without hitting a ball out of
the infield. Spiezio got hit by a pitch, stole second, moved to third
on Molina's infield single and scored on Eckstein's ground ball.</TE>
<TE>   With the crowd chanting, "Sweep," Weber came on for the ninth. He
walked Ruben Sierra but got Mike Cameron to ground into a double
play. Weber walked pinch-hitter Carlos Guillen, then struck out Desi
Relaford for his fourth save.</TE>
<TE>   "When we get everybody back healthy and doing what they're
supposed to, it's only going to make the bullpen better," Schoeneweis
said. "In Percy's absence, guys are stepping up."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn continued a streak that began April 19, but did it
without an overpowering effort. He opened the game by striking out
Ichiro Suzuki on three pitches and retired nine of the first 10
batters. But he gave up four runs in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "After that, I'm just trying to do all I can to keep them there,"
said Washburn, who gave up five runs, eight hits and struck out four
in seven innings. "The way we've been playing, I thought we had a
good chance of coming back and scrapping our way back into the game.</TE>
<TE>   "You never deserve to win when you give up five runs but my
teammates picked me up big time."</TE>

<LD>Brendan Donnelly struck out Bret Boone and Edgar Martinez at the
start of the eighth inning in the Angels' 7-5, sweep-clinching
victory over the Seattle Mariners on Sunday night at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward, Donnelly started toward the dugout as if the inning was
over.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't, of course, but Donnelly knew his job was done.</LD>
<TE>   "I knew my job was to get the two guys, and after the last pitch I
was thinking, 'I'm out of here,' " Donnelly said. "I got ragged about
that. [Shortstop David] Eckstein came over and said, 'At least wait
for [Manager Mike] Scioscia to get out here.' "</TE>
<TE>   Donnelly also struck out five in 2 1/3 innings of scoreless relief
in Saturday night's 7-6 victory. The 31-year-old right-hander has
stepped up in the absence of closer Troy Percival and left-hander
Dennis Cook, who are on the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, with Percival and Cookie down, there are no roles,"
Donnelly said. "We take the ball and get people out. I'm just
fortunate to get the ball, period."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After drawing consecutive sellouts of more than 43,000 for the
first two games of the series against the Mariners, Sunday's game
drew 34,945.</TE>
<TE>   The total attendance for the series was 121,461.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been in the playoffs but it kind of felt like a
playoff atmosphere," said Angel left-hander Jarrod Washburn, who
extended his winning streak to 12 games Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The record for a three-game series at Edison Field is 130,341 set
June 28-30 against the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have seven sellouts this season, including five in the
last 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had 10 sellouts in 1998, the year the remodeled stadium
opened.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Angels had three sellouts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle right fielder Ichiro Suzuki, who leads the majors with a
.380 road batting average, was four for 12 with a double, two runs
and a stolen base in the series.</TE>
<TE>   In the fifth inning Sunday, Suzuki hit a ground ball toward the
mound that Washburn deflected with his leg. The ball rolled toward
first base, where Scott Spiezio fielded it while charging toward the
plate. Suzuki angled off the base line and reached for first base
with his left hand while diving to avoid Spiezio's swipe tag.</TE>
<TE>   Suzuki, however, could not elude second baseman Adam Kennedy's tag
when he got caught in a rundown between first and second after Jeff
Cirillo's strikeout.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel rookie John Lackey said there was nothing mysterious about
the control problems he suffered Friday in his shortest outing of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Lackey had pitched at least six innings in his first four starts.
He lasted only 3 2/3 against the Mariners and walked five.</TE>
<TE>   "It was nothing mechanical, I was just missing spots," said
Lackey, who threw only one strike in his first 10 pitches. "The first
couple of hitters, I wasn't real close. After that, when I missed I
was around the zone.</TE>
<TE>   "You're always going to have a stretch where you have to battle
through. It's how you do with those stretches that determines whether
you'll be successful."</TE>

<HD>Yankees' Rivera Will Undergo MRI Test</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York Yankee closer Mariano Rivera was sidelined Sunday, one day
after leaving a game against the Boston Red Sox because of tightness
in his right shoulder.</LD>
<LD>   Rivera was examined by team physician Stuart Hershon and was
scheduled to have a precautionary MRI test today. The Yankees will
then determine whether to put the four-time All-Star on the disabled
list.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think anything's going to show up. It's just soreness,
that's what it feels like," Rivera said. "It's not pain, that's what
I keep saying. It just doesn't loosen up right away."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yankee starter Orlando Hernandez dropped his appeal and began
serving a five-game suspension Sunday for hitting Toronto's Carlos
Delgado with a pitch last week.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez was suspended by the commissioner's office Friday, but
the Players Assn. appealed--allowing the right-hander to start
Saturday against the Boston Red Sox. He didn't have a decision in New
York's 9-8 victory in 11 innings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Texas pitcher Kenny Rogers was still considering whether to waive
his no-trade clause and accept a trade to the Cincinnati Reds, who
want to send a package of prospects to the Rangers for the
left-hander.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers said he plans to speak to his family and the Reds before
making his decision.</TE>

<TE>   Major league baseball umpires demanded that the company
manufacturing equipment used to evaluate them remove a reference
saying umpires support the system.</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone conference call, 45 major league umpires told the
officers of their union, the World Umpires Assn., to make the demand
to Questec Inc.</TE>
<TE>   A screen on the company's Web site says of umpires and the system:
"In general they support it!"</TE>
<TE>   The WUA filed a grievance against owners Friday over the system,
and union lawyer Larry Gibson said umpires believe it cannot properly
evaluate pitches, especially breaking balls.</TE>
<TE>   "The technology has never been adequately explained to umpires or
our legal and technical consultants," umpires John Hirschbeck, Joe
Brinkman and Tim Welke said in a letter to the company they released
Sunday.</TE>

<DL>GULLANE, Scotland</DL>
<LD>As soon as he left the clubhouse at Muirfield and walked toward his
car, Tiger Woods was surrounded by a crush of fans. He didn't stop
for fear of being trampled.</LD>
<LD>   It was his usual assortment of followers. One guy in the crowd
carried a homemade periscope constructed out of cardboard, complete
with a tiny stuffed tiger on top. Two others had painted their faces
in stripes. Someone else had given Tiger's mother, Kultida, a
handmade toy tiger.</LD>
<LD>   There must have been two dozen fans surrounding the car. As Woods
climbed inside, an arm jutted out of the crowd. It belonged to a man
holding a plate. On the plate were a half-dozen pieces of sushi.</LD>
<TE>   Uh, excuse me ... sushi? What did he want Tiger to do, autograph
it or eat it?</TE>
<TE>   The poor guy was probably crestfallen because Woods was looking
the other way and never saw the plate intended for him. Tiger roared
down the driveway and was gone, leaving only the sound of rubber on
asphalt and the sight of a full plate of sushi and no one to give it
to.</TE>
<TE>   It was a small scene played out in the shadow of the red stone,
red-roofed clubhouse of Muirfield, just another dose of the
unexpected and one more slice of disappointment so coldly served over
four days at the British Open.</TE>
<TE>   Woods felt better about his experience after closing with a 65
under bright sunshine Sunday. He brought his score back to even par
and tied for 28th. Par had become his goal after the worst round of
his pro career the day before, when he played in a gale and shot 81.</TE>
<TE>   His goal had been slightly more elevated before he got to
Scotland. The Grand Slam was possible, with victories at the Masters
and the U.S. Open already to his credit. Thirty years after Jack
Nicklaus was in exactly the same position and failed, Woods would get
the same chance.</TE>
<TE>   Now, after enduring the same result as the man he has patterned
his career after, Woods might have learned a hard truth from a
humbling game. There's a reason no one has won all four of golf's
professional majors in one year.</TE>
<TE>   It can't be done. The truth is, it's just not possible. Nicklaus
is the greatest player of all and he couldn't do it. At 26, Woods is
the greatest player of his generation and he's not going to be able
to do it either.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, Nicklaus was 32 and in his prime. After he lost to Lee
Trevino by one shot here at Muirfield, he went on to the PGA
Championship at Oakland Hills and watched Gary Player win. After
being so motivated by trying to win the Grand Slam and then keenly
disappointed by losing on Muirfield's links, Nicklaus tied for 13th.</TE>
<TE>   So there is some weighty history being tossed around here. Tiger's
chance for a Grand Slam, this one, came to an end one round sooner
than Nicklaus' in 1972, but the similarities are worth noting. And
it's going to be interesting to see how Woods responds in a month
when he tees it up in the last major of the year at Hazeltine
National Golf Club.</TE>
<TE>   It might be easier for Woods to shake off his Muirfield result
because of the freakish weather he endured Saturday. He admitted that
he considered his 81 to be "just one of those days." Tiger wasted no
time in ridding himself of the memory. He shrugged it off. It wasn't
life and death, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Such an attitude will help Woods, and so will his stance that he
has already won the Grand Slam--just not in a calendar year. Woods
held all four major titles at once, from the 2000 U.S. Open, British
Open and PGA Championship to the 2001 Masters.</TE>
<TE>   No one else has done that, which is going to have to be enough to
satisfy Woods. And everyone else, for that matter. Being able to
raise your game to a peak at four different times of the year, from
April to August, in all possible conditions, and outplaying the best
players in the world for 16 rounds is just too tough an assignment
for anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone agrees, of course, and it's a group that includes
Arnold Palmer, Nicklaus and Nick Faldo, a six-time major champion,
who informed everyone who would listen Sunday that the Grand Slam can
be done and if anybody's going to do it, it's Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Woods would disagree as well, but because he doesn't go by a
calendar in counting up majors he has won, there is no Grand Slam
debate as far as he's concerned. He has already done it, he says. And
that may be something he can use to his advantage. By the looks of
history, he's going to need it.</TE>

<LD>Jim Thorpe is a senior golfer who wins sometimes, but smiles nearly
all the time.</LD>
<LD>   Hale Irwin is a senior golfer who wins most of the time, but
almost never smiles.</LD>
<LD>   "Hale's a great player who has won more money than anyone who has
played the game, but he's one of those guys who is just not fan
friendly," Thorpe said. "We have a bunch of jerks out there."</LD>
<TE>   Thorpe said his fellow seniors have a ritual with Irwin, the
tour's leading money winner with $1.5 million this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We put cheese in his locker to go with his whining," Thorpe said.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the only player to play 1,000 games at both
first base and second base?</TE>
<TE>   The loner: Gary Sheffield credits off-season training with Barry
Bonds for his offensive output with the Atlanta Braves. Steve Hummer
of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution asks: "When they got together,
did Bonds practice for his regular-season routine by sitting alone on
the other side of the weight room from his partner?"</TE>
<TE>   Smart man: The late Bill Veeck, a maverick sports team owner, once
said the proof of baseball's greatness as a game is that it "survives
the fools who run it."</TE>
<TE>   Two views: From Jay Mohr of ESPN: "[Sammy] Sosa took losing [the
home run contest] well. Afterward, he fired his pharmacist, and then
he went back to the locker room and popped the zits on his back."</TE>
<TE>   Frightening: Reserve officer Shaquille O'Neal helped apprehend a
suspect while he was on a LAPD ride-a-long.</TE>
<TE>   According to CBS' Craig Kilborn, "The guy apparently dropped his
gun when Shaq yelled, 'Stop or I'll rap.' "</TE>
<TE>   The cutting edge: The motto of the U.S. Lawn Mower Racing Assn. is
"The mow the merrier."</TE>
<TE>   The high-speed mowers have all their cutting edges removed, so how
can they "mow" when they can't cut?</TE>
<TE>   No kidding: In case you wondered, NHRA top-fuel and funny-car
dragsters produce more than 6,000 horsepower, about 43 times that of
the average street car.</TE>
<TE>   Not good odds: The ABA is talking of putting a pro basketball team
in Pittsburgh, but Post-Gazette columnist Ron Cook says it's a bad
idea.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq, Kobe and Allen Iverson--presuming he's not in prison--could
play real basketball on a team here, and it wouldn't make it," Cook
said.</TE>
<TE>   Strike coming? What a difference a year makes. As Dave Kindred
noted in the Sporting News, "It was only last September that our
ballparks became cathedrals for mourning and resolve. This September
they may be warehouses, empty."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Rod Carew, in 19 years with Minnesota and the
Angels, played 1,184 games at first and 1,130 at second.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: When ballplayers discuss who is baseball's greatest
living player, former Chicago Cub second baseman Ryne Sandberg
nominates Pete Rose because of his 4,256 career hits. Sandberg, who
had 2,386 hits in 15 years, would have had to average 187 hits over
10 more seasons to tie Rose.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm totally impressed with that," Sandberg said. "When you get
4,000 hits, that's not too many 0-fers."</TE>

Muirfield, from elation to despair and, finally, to something
euphoric even he couldn't describe.</LD>
<LD>   Els had the silver Claret Jug from the 131st British Open firmly
in his hands with six holes to play, watched helplessly as his game
deserted him, then patched himself together and outlasted three other
players in a four-hole playoff and one hole of sudden death to win
what he called "the most rewarding" championship of his life.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm still a little bit in shock," Els said. "In a couple of
hours, I will be out of my skin, probably. It's just been an
unbelievable four days."</LD>
<TE>   A birdie on No. 12 put Els, known as the Big Easy, at eight-under
for the tournament and gave him a three-shot advantage. But after a
mental error two holes later and a shoulder-slumping double bogey at
the par-three 16th dropped him out of the lead, Els did all he could
to finish in a tie with Stuart Appleby, Steve Elkington and Thomas
Levet of France by the 18th hole.</TE>
<TE>   Those four completed the final round at six-under-par 278, under
blue sky and perfect playing conditions, weather as dramatically
different from Saturday's blistering rain and wind as Els' mood
swings were Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Els, who has won the U.S. Open twice, set a scoring record at
Riviera in the 1995 PGA Championship after three rounds but shot a 72
on the final day and missed getting in a playoff, which was won by
Elkington. The 32-year-old Els has been second in the Masters and
U.S. Open once each and second twice in the British Open.</TE>
<TE>   Els said he thought he had secured his third major championship
after a spectacular sand save at the 13th hole preserved a two-shot
lead.</TE>
<TE>   But on the par-four 14th, he used a two-iron instead of a safer
three-iron and bogeyed after hitting into the rough. And after he
lost the lead at 16, he was a vision of self-doubt, certain he had
thrown away the tournament, questioning whether he ever might win it.</TE>
<TE>   "Walking off 16, a lot of things went through my mind," he said.
"I was like, is this a way to lose another major; is this the way you
want to be remembered, by screwing up in an Open Championship? That
wasn't one of my finer moments....</TE>
<TE>   "People have lost here before, and some people never recover."</TE>
<TE>   Els stepped up to the 17th tee feeling like a beaten man. It's a
546-yard par five that had given up 42 birdies Sunday, the
second-easiest hole on the course.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, 17 is the most crucial hole of the
tournament.... I was under a lot of pressure there," he said. "I
never felt anything like it."</TE>
<TE>   But Els hit a good drive, birdied the hole to tie for the lead and
needed a birdie on 18, where there had been only four birdies all
day, to win the championship outright. His birdie putt was short,
forcing a playoff he had little confidence he could win.</TE>
<TE>   "I was down in the dumps, really," he said.</TE>
<TE>   While Els was struggling on the final holes, Elkington, Levet and
Appleby were working their way into contention.</TE>
<TE>   Elkington, who had to qualify for the Open and barely made the
cut, shot a 66; Levet eagled the 17th for a 66 and Appleby shot a
five-under 30 on the final nine to finish with a 65. Els came in at
70.</TE>
<TE>   The British Open uses a four-hole cumulative-score playoff to
determine its winner in case of a tie, and in the brief period before
the playoff, Els tried to get mentally ready to play the four holes:
1, 16, 17 and 18.</TE>
<TE>   He was paired with Appleby, following the Elkington-Levet twosome
as the playoff began.</TE>
<TE>   On the first extra hole, the 448-yard par-four first, Elkington
fell one behind the others with a bogey.</TE>
<TE>   Levet got the first birdie of the playoff with a 50-foot putt on
the second hole, the 186-yard par-three 16th. Elkington and Els
two-putted for par, but Appleby, who missed the green to the left,
not far from where Els had made double bogey to set the stage for the
playoff, couldn't get up and down for par and went to one over.</TE>
<TE>   On the 17th, Elkington birdied from 35 feet to get back to even,
and Appleby followed with an eight-foot birdie putt to square his
total. Els and Levet settled for pars.</TE>
<TE>   That meant Levet, a 33-year-old PGA European Tour player who
finished 18th in the U.S. Open in June, came to the 18th at
one-under, the other three at even par. A par could give him the
championship.</TE>
<TE>   But on the 449-yard par four, he drove into the rough and bogeyed
to fall back to even par. Appleby and Elkington also bogeyed, leaving
Levet and Els to settle the championship in sudden death.</TE>
<TE>   They returned to the 18th tee. Els split the fairway with a safe
two-iron; Levet drove into a fairway bunker and had to blast out to
the fairway.</TE>
<TE>   Els, given an opening, then hit his second shot, a five-iron, into
a greenside bunker, giving Levet new life.</TE>
<TE>   But then Els did just what he had on 13, hitting an improbable
bunker shot to five feet from the pin. After Levet bogeyed, all Els
needed to do was make that putt.</TE>
<TE>   He did.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fifth time the four-hole playoff has been used since
Mark Calcavecchia defeated Wayne Grady and Greg Norman in 1989 at
Royal Troon. Sunday's playoff was the first involving four players in
a major championship.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods made a belated charge Sunday with a six-under-par 65,
one of 36 scores in the 60s. But even with that round, his only
chance of overtaking the leaders was to bring on a storm even more
vicious than the one that had turned the leaders into 10-handicappers
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Woods finished at even-par 284, six shots behind the leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The tournament that began as Woods' historic opportunity to win
the third leg of the Grand Slam became a trial of Els' character.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a dream of winning this jug for a long, long time," Els
said. "To almost be a clear winner and almost be a clear loser in the
space of three or four holes, I had patience, and I guess I had
staying power this time."</TE>

<HD>Monty: Critics Are Full of It</HD>

<AU>THOMAS BONK and MIKE JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>GULLANE, Scotland</DL>
<LD>It's not easy being Colin Montgomerie. Not lately.</LD>
<LD>   He finished next-to-last Sunday, 82nd in an 83-player field, his
worst British Open in the 13 he has played. But it's just the latest
edition of Monty's woes.</LD>
<LD>   Remember.... In February, he said he might not play in the U.S.
again because of the heckling he was getting. In March, his sore back
acted up again. In April, he tied for 14th at the Masters. In June,
he missed the cut at the U.S. Open.</LD>
<TE>   Then came Muirfield and the Open Championship, where Scotland's
native son never seems to do well. Montgomerie shot a 64 Friday and
followed it with an 84 Saturday in the rain and wind. Montgomerie's
20-shot turnaround tied the British Open record for the biggest
change between two rounds, established in 1938.</TE>
<TE>   But after his four-over 75 Sunday, Montgomerie saved his worst for
last.</TE>
<TE>   The 39-year-old said he is so stung by criticism from the media
that he is curtailing his playing schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie said what really disturbed him is that several
newspapers reported he did not speak to reporters after Saturday's
round. He said he made himself available but no one wanted to talk to
him.</TE>
<TE>   "Tiger Woods was here and you were more interested in him,"
Montgomerie said. "I left five minutes after he had finished his
round. I was off after him. I left here and no one wanted to speak to
me. I didn't storm off. I didn't go off in a temper, OK?</TE>
<TE>   "I played in very difficult circumstances yesterday and I'm very
disappointed at the way you [media] keep on trying to believe that I
have a bad temper on the golf course. I haven't shown a sign of
temper on a golf course for five years. I'm very, very disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really hurt by it, I'm really hurt. I've pulled out of golf
tournaments the next two weeks. I can't handle it anymore."</TE>
<TE>   With that, he was gone.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie, who says he does not read the newspaper stories about
him, had a 7:25 a.m. tee time Sunday, so he must have been up early
not reading. Perhaps one of the stories he didn't read was by Bryan
Cooney, who wrote in the Sunday Mail that Montgomerie left the course
Saturday without saying a word.</TE>
<TE>   Cooney compared Montgomerie to how Woods handled himself with the
media Saturday: "[Woods] stood patiently ... while our man crept out
the back door. Class versus crass, wouldn't you say?"</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie finished at 13-over 297 and was 20 over par in the
three rounds that didn't include his 64.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gary Evans of England shot a 65 Sunday and for a while in the
afternoon held a share of the lead. He made two monumental saves on
the closing holes: a 35-foot par putt on 17 after losing a ball and
hitting into the grandstand, and a par on 18 that left his heart
pounding.</TE>
<TE>   He's an unassuming PGA European Tour player who found it difficult
even to breathe during his odyssey on 17 and 18.</TE>
<TE>   After his par-saving putt on 17, he clenched his fist like someone
on the verge of winning a major championship when he thought he had
no business being there. He turned to the camera and shouted, "That's
for you, Mom!"</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, he said, "I knew she would have been nearly in tears
with me walking back down the fairway. It just sprung to mind."</TE>
<TE>   Evans, who finished one behind the four co-leaders, said that only
once has he been more nervous than he was Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   He said it came the first time he picked up a club in a British
Open, as an amateur in 1989 at Royal Troon.</TE>
<TE>   "I walked on the first tee and I couldn't get my left hand on the
golf grip," Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was 19. Troon. That was the most nervous I've ever been.</TE>
<TE>   "And that was a practice round."</TE>
<TE>   Evans looks at himself as a golfer representing Everyman, a guy
with average skills in extraordinary circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "Every kid wants to play the British Open," he said. "It means so
much just to qualify. It's pretty tough for us more human golfers to
get in....</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, these top guys, the Faldos ... how these guys hit these
shots, I don't know. It's a different world to me. I'm just delighted
that it's over."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's 41 and counting for Phil Mickelson--how many majors he has
played without winning. Mickelson's 68-76-76-70 added up to a
six-over 290 and a tie for 66th, but he says Muirfield wasn't a bad
setup for him.</TE>
<TE>   "I really like how it was in front of the greens, the ball always
kicks straight, I thought the fairways were very generous. I just
didn't play well," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In 10 appearances at the British Open, Mickelson's best finish was
a tie for 11th at St. Andrews in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scott Hoch has never had the British Open high on his schedule; he
has played in only five of them. But Sunday, he shot a 66 and was
among the leaders late into the final round before finishing tied for
eighth, making him low American.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the tournament doesn't seem to have found a place in Hoch's
heart.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was playing pretty easy," he said of the course. "We
don't have any stupid pin placements like some of the other days.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I can go home and enjoy watching it on TV. I enjoy it more
watching on TV than I do playing."</TE>
<TE>   When will he return? Possibly when the Open returns to St. Andrews
in 2005?</TE>
<TE>   "You can forget it," he said. "Even if I had won here, I'm not
going to play it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's wild weather was still on the players' minds Sunday. It
helped produce Woods' worst tournament round as a professional, but
not his worst score in a non-tournament round.</TE>
<TE>   "At Royal County Down last year, it was worse," Woods said about a
day in Ireland before last year's British Open. "I was low round of
the group with an 83. It was brutal, blowing about 40, 50 miles an
hour, just a brutal day."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The biggest casualty among the first-round leaders was David Toms,
last year's PGA champion. Toms was one of three leaders after play
Thursday with a four-under 67, struggled to a 75 in the second round,
ballooned to an 81 during Saturday's gale, and wrapped things up with
a 75 while playing a speed round with Montgomerie Sunday morning.</TE>
<TE>   He finished at 14-over 298, last in the field.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland didn't mince words about how he
performed at Muirfield, letting the tournament get away Saturday,
when he shot a 77.</TE>
<TE>   "This tournament was probably my No. 1 priority at the start of
the year," he said. "I went out yesterday and swung the club
terrible. I was pathetic."</TE>
<TE>   Clarke shot a 69 Sunday and finished at one over.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The quote of the day is from Nick Faldo, a three-time British Open
champion who won at Muirfield in 1992, on his closing round of 71,
which tied him for 59th: "Not bad. I only plonked it in the hay a
couple of times."</TE>

<LD>   What: "Los Angeles Lakers 2001-2002 NBA Champions"</LD>
<TE>   Produced by: NBA Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Distributed by: USA Home Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $14.95 (VHS), $19.95 (DVD).</TE>
<TE>   The crowd and the Sacramento King players were going wild. Too
wild in the estimation of the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "We were upset," Laker guard Kobe Bryant says of the aftermath of
Game 5 of the Western Conference finals, "because they're out there
celebrating like we're done."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers weren't done, of course, rallying in the next two games
against the Kings, then sweeping the New Jersey Nets to win their
third consecutive NBA championship.</TE>
<TE>   It's the behind-the-scenes moments such as Bryant's reaction that
make this one-hour video well worth watching.</TE>
<TE>   After a five-minute recap of the regular season, the video
concentrates fully on the playoffs. And that's where the league's
camera becomes the star.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey Coach Byron Scott displays his first championship ring
to his players before the start of the Finals, telling them they will
win their own ring together.</TE>
<TE>   Late in Game 3, Laker Coach Phil Jackson delivers a strong message
to his team.</TE>
<TE>   "If they score, call a timeout," he says. "If they score. Don't
let that happen ... please."</TE>
<TE>   The real star of the video is Shaquille O'Neal, whose comedic and
emotional sides are on full display. One moment, he's singing about
the Kings' Vlade Divac on the team bus, the next he's tenderly
holding his baby daughter after the last game with the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD version includes extra features, including an interesting
look at O'Neal career before this season and Bryant's development in
comparison to Michael Jordan.</TE>

<HD>Goodwin Costs Dodgers Extra</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Giant outfielder, still on L.A. payroll for $3.5
million after his spring release, homers in ninth and beats former
team for second time in three days.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As if Tom Goodwin isn't costing the Dodgers enough this season, the
San Francisco reserve outfielder, who remains on the Dodger payroll
to the tune of about $3.5 million, made his former team pay dearly
again Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   The light-hitting Goodwin, starting for injured slugger Barry
Bonds, went from understudy to leading man, smashing a two-run home
run in the top of the ninth inning to lift the Giants to a 6-4
victory over the Dodgers, deflating a Dodger Stadium sellout crowd of
54,344 and laying waste to a stirring Dodger comeback in the sixth.</LD>
<LD>   It marked the second time in three days that Goodwin, whose hefty
contract was swallowed by the Dodgers after they released him coming
out of spring training, has sent the Dodgers to a crushing defeat.</LD>
<TE>   Goodwin lined an RBI single to left in the top of the 12th Friday
night for a 3-2 Giant victory, and he smashed reliever Giovanni
Carrara's first pitch over the right-field wall in the ninth Sunday
for his first home run of the season, a dagger that sealed the
Dodgers' 10th loss in 12 games and knocked them into third place in
the National League West.</TE>
<TE>   "The check's probably going to be a little late this week,"
Goodwin joked.</TE>
<TE>   Ouch. That thud you just heard was Dodger Chairman Bob Daly's fist
pounding the breakfast table.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers knew they were a better team without the
underachieving Goodwin, they knew they had to eat his contract and
clear room for Dave Roberts in the leadoff spot ... and Goodwin
shoves it back down their throats.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not paying him," Dodger first baseman Eric Karros said. "It
doesn't matter that Goody beat us. What matters is we lost. We lost
two games that we easily could have won."</TE>
<TE>   Carrara was in his third inning of relief, his pitch count passing
40, when he walked J.T. Snow with one out after starting Snow with
two strikes. Kirk Rueter pinch-ran, and Carrara then left a cut
fastball over the middle of the plate, and Goodwin pounced on it.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't tired," said Carrara, who threw 51 pitches. "I tried to
pitch around J.T. because I didn't think Goodwin would hurt me, and
he did."</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Jesse Orosco and right-hander Guillermo Mota were warm
in the bullpen, but Manager Jim Tracy made no change because he liked
a Carrara-Goodwin matchup over a potential Orosco-Shawon Dunston
showdown. Dunston would have likely pinch-hit for Goodwin had Orosco
been summoned.</TE>
<TE>   "[Reliever Paul] Quantrill pitched three innings in the last two
days, and with Mota, you're pushing the envelope a little quickly
with a younger guy," Tracy said. "I thought Gio could retire J.T.,
and I liked a Carrara-Goodwin match-up. We had the right guy on the
mound."</TE>
<TE>   So did the Giants in the bottom of the ninth, but the Dodgers
mounted a serious threat against closer Robb Nen when Dave Hansen
singled to right for his 107th pinch hit as a Dodger, snapping Manny
Mota's franchise record of 106, and Alex Cora doubled to left-center
with two out, moving Hansen to third.</TE>
<TE>   But Roberts, the hero of Saturday's 4-2 Dodger victory with three
runs batted in, struck out on a nasty split-fingered fastball, Nen
earned his 26th save, and the Dodgers completed a 2-9 homestand, the
most losses they've suffered on a homestand since going 4-9 from Aug.
14-26, 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "We're playing really bad right now," second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek said. "To be in the situation we're in now, only 1 1/2
games [behind first-place Arizona], we're very fortunate."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers trailed the Giants, 3-0, in the sixth inning when an
offense that has sputtered since the All-Star break came to life,
scoring four two-out runs to take a 4-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Cora opened the inning with a pinch-hit single, Roberts failed to
reach on a bunt attempt as Cora took second, and Paul Lo Duca flied
to center for the second out.</TE>
<TE>   Four Russ Ortiz pitches later, the score was tied, as Shawn Green
lined a first-pitch RBI single to center, Karros hit a first-pitch
single to right, Brian Jordan lobbed a first-pitch RBI single to
right-center, and Grudzielanek lined a first-pitch RBI single to
left-center to make it 3-3.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan scored the go-ahead run when Adrian Beltre hit a one-hopper
to the shortstop hole that Rich Aurilia knocked down but couldn't
make a play on.</TE>
<TE>   The lead didn't last long. Reggie Sanders, who homered off starter
Hideo Nomo to lead off the sixth, sent a Carrara pitch into the
right-field pavilion to start the eighth for his 14th homer of the
season, pulling the Giants even, 4-4.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds was taking practice swings in the Giants' clubhouse during
the eighth and ninth innings, preparing for a possible pinch-hitting
appearance, but his services were not needed.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Barry not to put his pants on--I told him I'd take care of
it," Goodwin said. "Getting back at the Dodgers ... there's no
vendetta. I didn't leave on bad terms."</TE>
<TE>   He did Sunday.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Karros Sets His Jaw, Stays in Lineup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His jaw was sore, he couldn't eat solid foods or close his mouth
completely, and he had 12 stitches on his chin to close a deep gash
caused by the Felix Rodriguez fastball that hit him in the face
Saturday. But that didn't prevent Dodger first baseman Eric Karros
from starting against the Giants Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not an eating contest out there or anything," Karros said,
"so I can play."</LD>
<LD>   Karros' jaw was not broken, and his sense of humor remained
intact, which was remarkable considering that a day earlier, he lay
face-down in the dirt, his feet kicking the ground and his hands
covering his face after getting beaned by a high-velocity Rodriguez
pitch that tailed up and in.</LD>
<TE>   "It was scary," Karros said. "I was on the ground trying to feel
my teeth, to make sure they weren't floating around. Blood was coming
out of my mouth.... Nothing even remotely close to that has happened
to me before.... I haven't seen a replay of it. I probably won't want
to for a while."</TE>
<TE>   Neither does Rodriguez, the San Francisco reliever who was a
teammate of Karros on the Dodgers in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "The more I see a replay of it, the worse I feel," said Rodriguez,
who sent a note of apology to Karros Sunday afternoon. "I'm just glad
he's OK."</TE>
<TE>   Any doubts about Karros were erased when he had three singles in
four at-bats Sunday night, which had to reinforce Manager Jim Tracy's
decision to start him.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you think about that," Tracy said, when asked if Karros
might have some trepidation about stepping back into the batter's
box, "but sometimes the best medicine in the world is to jump right
back in the saddle rather than sitting around and thinking about it
for a while."</TE>
<TE>   Karros had minor plastic surgery at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los
Angeles to close the cut Saturday, but showed no sign of having a
concussion or blurred vision.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm lucky the pitch wasn't higher," Karros said. "I'm as OK as
you can be for getting hit in the face."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Infielder Jeff Reboulet strained his lower back during a bunt
attempt Saturday and was placed on the 15-day disabled list. To
replace him, the Dodgers purchased the contract of utility player
Mike Kinkade, who was batting .341 with 11 homers and 50 runs batted
in for triple-A Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Brown is scheduled to throw off the Dodger Stadium bullpen
mound today, Wednesday and Friday, and Tracy said the right-hander
will use most of his pitches, an indication Brown is recovering
rapidly from his June 11 surgery for a herniated disk in his lower
back and could return sometime in August.</TE>

<KH>Chris Dufresne SECOND THOUGHTS</KH>
<HD>It's Not the Way to Put France in Driver's Seat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trying to figure out the French is like trying to eat their onion
soup with a fork.</LD>
<LD>   They excel at pastries, quiches and have fine wines named after
some of their regions, yet continue to think Jerry Lewis is funny and
that, in golf, a driver off the tee is a better play than a two-iron
at defining moments of major championships.</LD>
<LD>   News item: Ernie Els defeats Thomas Levet in playoff to win 131st
British Open.</LD>
<TE>   Second thought: As the French valley girls say, ohmondieu!
(Ohmygod!)</TE>
<TE>   You'd think Jean Van de Velde's final-hole meltdown at the 1999
British Open would have been a cautionary tale told in golf schools
from Nice to Normandy.</TE>
<TE>   Van de Velde, needing double bogey to win on the final hole at
Carnoustie, teed off with a driver instead of iron and ended up
navigating more brush and standing water than Steve Irwin in the
Australian outback.</TE>
<TE>   Van de Velde salvaged a triple-bogey save to force a playoff, then
lost.</TE>
<TE>   So there was Levet on Sunday, with all this history to cull,
hitting a driver on No. 18, on the fourth hole of the four-hole
playoff, when par would have secured the championship. He made bogey
to move on to a sudden-death shootout with Els, then used driver
again when they returned to No. 18. Levet whacked it left into a
bunker, made another bogey, and Els won with a par.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe they don't need a Q-school in France.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe they need an IQ school.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Colin Montgomerie follows second-round 64 at British
Open with third-round 84.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Sorry, nothing nasty to add here, as I'm still
wearing the "Be Nice to Monty" button Golf Digest handed out at last
month's U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Tiger Woods has third-round 81.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Looking very much forward to Golf Digest's "Be
Nice To Tiger" campaign.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Muirfield Golf Links does not allow female members.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Defenders of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh
Golfers note many of their men wear skirts (kilts).</TE>
<TE>   News item: Head of National Council of Women's Organizations
criticizes Tiger Woods for not speaking out against clubs that don't
have female members.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: In case you missed the memo, Woods' career role
model is Michael Jordan, not Arthur Ashe. Woods was schooled at Nike
headquarters, not a bus stop in Selma, Ala. He has too much to risk
in endorsements--Is there anything more Middle America than
Buick?--to jeopardize his financial empire.</TE>
<TE>   Like Jordan, Woods nary utters an interesting public word unless
it's rehearsed and practiced or handed to him by a Nike script
doctor. He is the prototype of today's superstar athlete: riveting
and robotic.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't think bad image hits you in the wallet, ask Barry
Bonds why it took so long to get a fried chicken commercial.</TE>
<TE>   Woods could take political stands and probably change golf's
discriminatory practices with a wave of his eight-iron. What if he
refused to play Augusta National unless it admitted women as members?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe someday Woods will take a firmer grip on social issues, but
right now we just don't see how it benefits his portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Vernon Forrest wins boxing rematch with Shane Mosley.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: After Forrest defeated Mosley in January, it was
written in this space: "I'm not sure Mosley would win twice if he
fought Forrest 10 times."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe now Mosley will get the message and move on to bigger and
better weight classes.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Allen Iverson's No. 3 Philadelphia 76er jersey is the
NBA's top seller.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: The pending criminal case against Iverson has
about as much chance of sticking as Derek Fisher did to Mike Bibby in
the playoffs, but the NBA is taking no chances in having Iverson
jerseys made sporting his most recent uniform number: 948473.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Two 76er fans cancel their season tickets in the wake
of Iverson's arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Wow, what outrage. Which guy gets to hold the
picket sign?</TE>
<TE>   News item: The new college football preview magazines are out!</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Good thing USC has history to fall back on and
UCLA those gorgeous powder-blue uniforms. Sporting News projects USC
to finish third in the Pacific 10 Conference this year and UCLA
sixth. Street &amp; Smith has USC at No .5 and UCLA at No. 6.</TE>
<TE>   USC checks in No. 2 in Athlon, which apparently thinks USC will be
in fine Pac-10 shape despite a nonconference schedule that includes
Auburn, Colorado, Kansas State and Notre Dame. Athlon has UCLA at No.
5.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine "Football Action" has USC and UCLA finishing third
and fourth.</TE>
<TE>   As they can tell you up north, UCLA hasn't won the Pac-10 title
since 1998 and USC hasn't won since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   New item: Colorado football program faces violations dating to the
Rick Neuheisel era.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Neuheisel, now coaching at Washington, plans to
sing his rebuttal to the NCAA on Aug. 9 while playing guitar. Sources
say he has titled his response, "Minor Violations in the Minor Key."</TE>
<TE>   News item: Former New York Yankee pitcher Don Larsen auctioning
baseball used to pitch World Series perfect game to pay for
grandchildren's college education.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: The educational news is rosier for Devean George's
future grandkids. The Laker reserve forward, who has yet to pitch a
perfect game, signed for $18.45 million over four years.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the three most
dangerous occupations are fishing, logging and airline pilot.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Topping next year's list will be anyone working at
ESPN Radio, assuming anyone's still working at ESPN Radio.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Former President Jimmy Carter offers to mediate
baseball dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Probably Carter's last best shot at winning the
Nobel Peace Prize. Frankly, if he thought getting Begin and Sadat
together was tough, wait until he gets a load of Selig and Fehr.</TE>
<TE>   News item: The XFL ranks No. 3 on TV Guide's list of 50 worst
shows of all-time.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: An outraged Jesse Ventura released a statement to
media "jackals" saying the XFL easily could have been No. 1 had NBC
only granted it a second season.</TE>

<HD>McRoy Rallies to Win at B.C.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Get ready Huntsville, Ala., the McRoys are going to have another
bell-ringing celebration and it should be the best one yet.</LD>
<LD>   Spike McRoy rallied from seven strokes behind Sunday to dart past
Shaun Micheel and win the B.C. Open at Endicott, N.Y., by one stroke
over Fred Funk.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first PGA Tour victory for McRoy, 34, who earned
$378,000 and a two-year exemption on the tour.</LD>
<TE>   His father, Robert McRoy Sr., has a pole in his backyard in
Alabama with a bell on top. After every tournament victory, an
engraved plaque is nailed on the pole and, with family and friends
present, the bell is rung to celebrate the achievement.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be really cool to see that one go up there," Spike
McRoy said. "I know he'll be very proud."</TE>
<TE>   There are other plaques on the pole marking the Alabama Open, the
two Hooters Tour tournaments and the two Buy.com Tour events McRoy
won.</TE>
<TE>   But nothing can match the PGA Tour title, nor the improbable way
McRoy won it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a funny game like that, you know?" McRoy said. "It's so
hard to put four solid rounds together, whether you're at Bethpage,
the hardest golf course I've ever played, or a very scoreable course
like this."</TE>
<TE>   McRoy closed with a seven-under-par 65 on the En-Joie Golf Club
course for a 19-under 269 total.</TE>
<TE>   Micheel, who also was seeking his first PGA Tour win, bogeyed the
last two holes to fall out of a tie with McRoy and into a five-way
tie for third place at 17-under.</TE>
<TE>   McRoy rolled in a twisting 31-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole to
tie Micheel, who started the day with a three-shot lead at 19-under.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Micheel was falling from 19-under to 18-under
when he dribbled a shot out of a greenside bunker on the par-three
14th and bogeyed.</TE>
<TE>   Needing a birdie to tie, Micheel hit his tee shot on the par-four
18th into the trees right of the fairway, lined his second shot into
rough left of the green, and could not get close with his chip for
birdie.</TE>
<TE>   He bogeyed to fall out of second place.</TE>
<TE>   Micheel's 74 followed rounds of 65, 65 and 67. He declined to be
interviewed afterward.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's Mi Hyun Kim came up big against Kelly Robbins in the
final round of the Giant Eagle LPGA Classic at Vienna, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Kim, who is listed as 5 feet 1, hit a seven wood to within four
feet on the 17th hole and made the birdie putt to beat Robbins by a
stroke.</TE>
<TE>   Kim finished with a three-under 69 for a 14-under 202, and earned
$150,000 for her fourth LPGA Tour victory. Robbins, who won the last
of her nine tour titles in 1999, closed with a 71.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you can finish second, you've hit a lot of shots well,"
Robbins said. "But I was licking my chops hoping for something
better."</TE>
<TE>   Kim, at a two-club disadvantage on nearly every approach shot as
she matched Robbins stroke for stroke, said she didn't enjoy what
turned out to be a match-play showdown.</TE>
<TE>   "No, because she's a very long player," Kim said. "Every time she
was playing a short iron, I'd have to hit a long iron or a fairway
wood."</TE>
<TE>   Two-time defending champion Dorothy Delasin and Grace Park closed
with 67s to tie for third place at 205.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bob Gilder won the SBC Senior Open at Chicago when Hale Irwin
struggled on the first playoff hole, nearly whiffing a shot in the
high grass and hitting another into the water.</TE>
<TE>   Gilder missed a final-hole putt that would have won the
tournament, then returned to the 18th and ended the playoff with a
short par putt to earn his first victory this season.</TE>
<TE>   Gilder closed with a one-under 71, and Irwin, a three-time winner
in the event, had a 66 for 12-under 204 totals.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Fleisher (66) finished third at 10-under.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin was playing four groups ahead of Gilder and had to wait to
see if he would win or go to a playoff. He watched from a golf cart,
went out to practice and returned to see Gilder miss his chance to

<HD>Hollywood Ends With Big Payoff</HD>

<LD>All the reasons not to bet Grammarian in the $250,000 Sunset Handicap
didn't matter. On the wire Sunday at Hollywood Park, the 4-year-old
gelding withstood a horde of pursuers, survived a stewards' inquiry
and paid $60, the biggest win payoff in the 61 editions of the stake.</LD>
<LD>   This was light years from Kentucky Downs, an obscure track once
known as the Dueling Grounds that runs only seven days a year. On one
of those days in September of last year, Grammarian ran for the first
time, beat maidens and gave his young trainer, Kellyn Gorder, the
first win of his career. Grammarian was a well-kept secret even then.
His win mutuel was $111.40.</LD>
<LD>   Grammarian came back lame from that win, suffering a hock injury,
and going into the Sunset he had run only twice more, finishing
second and fourth this year at Churchill Downs. The 1 1/2-mile
Sunset, the closing feature at the 65-day Hollywood meet, hardly
looked like the logical spot for a horse that had never run farther
than 1 1/16 miles.</LD>
<TE>   Grammarian found his way to Hollywood Park because his owner,
Lindsey Williams, is a dreamer. The Australian-born Williams, a Long
Beach resident and retired Mattel executive, has long dreamed of
winning the Melbourne Cup, run every November, and to make Grammarian
eligible the horse had to win or finish second in a graded race in
the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Brice Blanc, who had won only five races at the meet,
Grammarian overtook the pace-setting Slew The Red heading into the
stretch. Under Blanc's left-handed whipping, Grammarian drifted
toward the center of the track as the other horses tried to run him
down. At the end, with Continental Red second and favored Lord
Flasheart third, the first three were separated by a couple of heads,
and it was a half-length back to Kim Loves Bucky in fourth. Gary
Stevens, riding the fifth-place finisher, Adminniestrator, was forced
to steady his horse in the drive.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no question," said Pete Pedersen, one of the three
stewards, "that [Grammarian] drifted out in the final
strides--[Adminniestrator] steadied momentarily--and in our opinion
it did not cost him a position. As far as the winning jockey's
responsibility, he will review the films with the stewards
Wednesday."</TE>
<TE>   Adminniestrator was beaten by about two lengths.</TE>
<TE>   "It's up to the stewards," Stevens said. "It doesn't matter what I
say."</TE>
<TE>   One of the reasons Williams hired Blanc to ride Grammarian was the
stakes success the French-born jockey had had with Happyanunoit, the
filly that raced for John Amerman, once Williams' boss at Mattel.
Also, Blanc rides light, and was able to ride within two pounds of
the 110 that Grammarian was assigned.</TE>
<TE>   "My horse is a little green," Blanc said, "and when I hit him
left-handed, he drifted more with me that I expected him to. I don't
think I bothered anybody, because I didn't see anybody coming to me,
and never heard anybody scream. I should have corrected him a little
more, but he's a big, long-striding horse, and I was afraid if I
really tried to correct him, it would break my momentum."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The lone winning ticket on the pick six, bought at Connecticut
Off-Track Betting, was worth $928,127.40, a Hollywood Park record.
The old record was $774,014, on June 27, 1997.... Telephone betting,
which began in California during the Santa Anita meet, seemed to
account for an on-track drop in betting at Hollywood Park, even
though attendance was up almost 9%. Overall handle rose 3.5%, while
on-track betting was down 4.7%. Betting via phone and Internet
averaged about $350,000 a day, and peaked on Hollywood Gold Cup day,
when $693,505 was bet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pat Valenzuela, riding four winners, led the standings with 74
victories, wrapping up his first meet title in Southern California
since 1991.... Bobby Frankel led the trainers with 23 victories,
eight of them in stakes.... Black Ruby, the 10-year-old mule, won her
eighth in a row and 58th in 76 starts by beating Taz by 1 3/4 lengths
in a $10,000 race at the Solano County Fair in Vallejo.... Summer
Colony beat Your Out by a neck in the $600,000 Delaware Handicap at
Delaware Park, and Mananan McLir, trained by Wally Dollase, won the
$225,000 American Derby at Arlington Park.... War Emblem, 124 pounds,
and Came Home, 122, are the high weights for the $1-million Haskell
Handicap at Monmouth Park on Aug. 4.... Del Mar's 43-day meet starts
Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Players' Union Sets Sept. 16 Strike Date</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN and JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Major League Baseball Players Assn., pessimistic about the state
of labor talks and bracing for another protracted battle with owners,
has tentatively targeted Sept. 16 to begin the sport's ninth work
stoppage unless progress is made quickly in negotiations, baseball
sources said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The executive board of the union did not set a strike date during
an All-Star break meeting in Rosemont, Ill., but union officials,
concerned that owners may try to implement new work rules after the
World Series, apparently plan to instruct players to walk out with
two weeks remaining in the regular season. Don Fehr, executive
director of the union, has laid out the group's agenda during his
ongoing tour to meet with all 30 clubs. Attempts to contact Fehr on
Sunday were unsuccessful.</LD>
<LD>   Although there had been widespread speculation of an August strike
date, sources said financial and public-relations issues prompted the
union's choice of Sept. 16.</LD>
<TE>   Players, paid biweekly, would miss only their final regular-season
paycheck while hitting owners hard, wiping out the final two weeks of
attendance and potentially big crowds for teams in playoff
contention.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball was credited with helping the United States heal after
the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, and players are leery of shutting
down the game before that date because of the probable public
backlash. Walking out Sept. 16 would enable the union to avoid an
even bigger public-relations nightmare, and the season could be
extended a week, as it was after last year's traumatic events, if an
agreement could be reached shortly after a strike had begun.</TE>
<TE>   The union is expected to take the next step to increase heat on
owners, trying to spur lagging talks centered on increased revenue
sharing among the clubs and a luxury tax on teams with high payrolls.
Although core economic issues are finally on the table and the sides
have agreed on the concept of one worldwide draft, the union is
frustrated the process has not moved faster.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations have been especially slow on the major financial
issues. The high-revenue clubs transferred $167 million to the
lower-revenue clubs last year, and the owners are now seeking to
transfer about $298 million from the high-revenue teams. The union is
at $228 million.</TE>
<TE>   The sides differ on the method of distribution, but an agreement
on numbers might lead to an agreement on method, so a compromise
would seem possible on that front.</TE>
<TE>   There is also the issue of the owners' desire for a luxury tax on
high payrolls, which the union strongly opposes.</TE>

<LD>Michael Schumacher made a late pass to win the French Grand Prix at
Magny-Cours and take his place in Formula One history.</LD>
<LD>   Schumacher took the lead on the 68th lap Sunday, moving past Kimi
Raikkonen's McLaren-Mercedes when the Finnish driver's brakes locked
on a patch of oil, and held on to claim the victory and his
record-tying fifth championship.</LD>
<LD>   The German made the pass under a yellow flag, but McLaren-Mercedes
did not challenge the move.</LD>
<TE>   Schumacher, driving his backup Ferrari, finished in 1 hour 32
minutes 9.837 seconds and clinched the driver's championship with six
races remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The triumph gave Schumacher an unbeatable 96 points in the
standings and was his eighth victory in 11 races. No driver has won a
season championship so quickly.</TE>
<TE>   His fifth season title tied the record set by Argentina's Juan
Manuel Fangio, who won his fifth title in 1957.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher was humble when asked to compare himself to Fangio.</TE>
<TE>   "What Fangio has done is not comparable to what we do," Schumacher
said. "The effort he had to put in to his team was probably a lot
more than what we do today, so it's not really fair to compare us."</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher spent much of the race locked in second place, first
behind early leader Juan Pablo Montoya, then behind Raikkonen, who
took second.</TE>
<TE>   Raikkonen was followed by teammate David Coulthard, Montoya of
BMW-Williams, his teammate Ralf Schumacher and Jenson Button of
Renault.</TE>
<TE>   Montoya won three points Sunday, putting him in second place in
the standings with 34. Ralf Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello were
tied with 32, and Coultard had 30.</TE>

<TE>   Ward Burton, stuck in a slump since winning the Daytona 500,
overcame hazardous track conditions and a late caution to win the New
England 300 at Loudon, N.H.</TE>
<TE>   Burton, who had only two other top-10 finishes since winning the
season-opening race, passed Matt Kenseth for the lead with 10 laps to
go then held off Jeff Green by 3.230 seconds at New Hampshire
International Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers believed the track surface, which showed signs of coming
apart during Saturday's final practice session, began to split early
in the race.</TE>

<TE>   Darrell Russell raced to his second top fuel victory this season,
beating Cory McClenathan in the final of the NHRA's Mopar Parts
Mile-High Nationals at Morrison, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Russell had a quarter-mile run of 4.877 seconds at 301.07 mph, and
McClenathan finished in 4.898 at 295.53.</TE>

<TE>   Lindsay Davenport beat Tzipi Obziler, 2-6, 6-1, 7-6 (1), the only
time the Americans did not win in straight sets. In the series' final
match, Meghann Shaughnessy and Lisa Raymond, the world's No. 1-ranked
doubles player, beat Obziler and Hila Rosen, 6-3, 6-0.</TE>

<HD>Padres Finally Get Best of Johnson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Diego Padres broke out of their slump against Randy Johnson
with a bang.</LD>
<LD>   The Padres pounded the four-time Cy Young winner for eight runs
and beat him for the first time in 14 regular-season tries,
outlasting the Arizona Diamondbacks, 11-9, Sunday at San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   Phil Nevin had a three-run double and pitcher Jake Peavy had a
two-run double in a six-run second inning against Johnson.</LD>
<TE>   "I felt good, I felt like I made some good pitches," Johnson said.
"But when I had to throw a strike, they banged it pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson (13-4) gave up eight hits in five innings, his shortest
outing this season. Johnson had been 8-0 with a 1.57 earned-run
average against the Padres.</TE>
<TE>   "Johnson has absolutely dominated us," Nevin said. "Normally, he
is able to put his fastball [inside] and overmatch right-handed
hitters. It seemed like he didn't have that today."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson had trouble with his control, walking four batters in the
first two innings, including three in the second, all of whom scored.
Johnson finished with a season-high six walks.</TE>
<TE>   Peavy started the scoring in the second inning with a two-run
double, Nevin added a bases-loaded double and Ron Gant hit a
run-scoring double, all with two out.</TE>
<TE>   "That seemed to jump-start us," Manager Bruce Bochy said about
Peavy's hit. "It got contagious."</TE>
<TE>   Peavy (2-3) nearly gave away the lead when he gave up five runs in
the third inning. But the rookie managed to last five innings for his
second consecutive victory. He gave up five runs--four earned--and
four hits.</TE>
<TE>   Trevor Hoffman pitched the ninth for his 23rd save in 24 chances.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 8, Pittsburgh 4--Chuck Finley won his National League
debut by getting the offensive support he seldom got in Cleveland,
with Albert Pujols hitting a home run and driving in four runs at
Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Finley, who pitched 17 seasons in the American League, wasn't
dazzling. He squandered a three-run lead before leaving after giving
up four runs--three earned--in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Finley helped himself by producing one of the Cardinals' 14 hits
with a double against Josh Fogg (10-7) in the fourth. It was his
first hit in 27 career at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 2, Philadelphia 1--Kevin Millwood pitched eight strong
innings, Gary Sheffield homered and the Braves completed a three-game
sweep at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Millwood (9-6) didn't give up a hit until Marlon Anderson led off
the sixth with a single to right. He gave up four hits and one run
and struck out six to win his fifth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 9, New York 1--Barry Larkin and Brandon Larson hit solo
homers, and Kelly Stinnett drove in three runs as the Reds salvaged
the last game of a three-game series at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets had scored 76 runs in the previous 11 games, winning
eight of them, to move into a tie with Cincinnati for third place in
the NL wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 3, Houston 2--Mark Bellhorn and Fred McGriff homered, and
Alex Gonzalez drove in the go-ahead run with a double against Tim
Redding (3-6) at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Lance Berkman hit his NL-leading 30th homer for Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 6, Milwaukee 4--Larry Walker homered and scored twice,
and Brent Butler hit a solo homer to help the Rockies complete a
three-game sweep at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Walker went three for three with a run batted in and a walk to
raise his NL-leading batting average to .358.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Jennings (10-5) gave up three runs and six hits in 5 1/3
innings to become Colorado's first 10-game winner.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 4, Montreal 0--Josh Beckett (3-4) had a career-high 12
strikeouts in six innings at Miami and the Marlins completed a
three-game sweep.</TE>
<TE>   The Expos have lost eight of 11 since the All-Star break and have
been shut out in the last two games.</TE>

<LD>It was hardly made-for-television golf, but it could have been worse.</LD>
<LD>   They could have kept playing until Roger Twibell asked
someone--golfer, marshal, groupie, anybody--a tough question. In that
case, they would have had to drag the 131st British Open into today,
deciding the thing the way they occasionally do at the U.S. Open.</LD>
<LD>   They could have gone to penalty kicks, which would have given
France's Thomas Levet a decided advantage over Ernie Els (represents
South Africa--rugby country) and Stuart Appleby and Steve Elkington
(both represent Australia--boomerang country).</LD>
<TE>   Or they could have left Bud Selig in charge of the Claret Jug,
which would have kept the official engraver working overtime, but not
a single golfer. No playoff. No sudden death. Appleby, Elkington, Els
and Levet: 2002 British Open Quad-Champions.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the British Open officials at Muirfield took a look at
the four-way tie at the end of regulation--unprecedented at a major
golf championship--and scratched their heads a bit and came up with
something that involved coins, alphabetical order and luck of the
draw. But, and we should be thankful, no rock, paper and scissors.</TE>
<TE>   What to do with four players tied after the completion of 72
holes?</TE>
<TE>   Let them play four more holes.</TE>
<TE>   Sounds good so far. Round them up, send out the foursome, let's
get this thing rolling.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's commentary crew was rubbing hands in anticipation, until
Mike Tirico was given the official word.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe it's going to be two twos," Tirico said, sounding
slightly baffled. "Not one group of four."</TE>
<TE>   This was golfing history, with a worldwide television audience
still hanging in there, curious to see what happens at a major
championship when four players are tied atop the leader board Sunday
and Tiger Woods isn't one of them. Hmm, you mean they don't just
abandon the tournament?</TE>
<TE>   No, they play on, although not together, not all at once, not in
Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, they took a perfectly reasonable-sounding foursome and
decided to split them into two confounding groups of two, one pair
playing ahead of the second, one pair unaware of how the other pair
was faring.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's third round, subtitled "Monsoon at Muirfield," was easy
TV viewing by comparison. Sure, the live footage often appeared to
have been shot underwater through an infrared lens, with shivering
golfers rendered almost unrecognizable by their ski caps, rain parkas
and umbrellas. At least you could figure out who was ahead and who
was shooting a send-in-the-Coast-Guard round of 81.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday rained confusion on the British Open.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, confusion reigned.</TE>
<TE>   Looking as if they were making up the rules by the second, Open
officials gathered the playoff foursome together and had them draw
lots. This involved four numbered coins, placed face down on a tray
and scrambled around like a shell game. Each player was instructed to
select a coin, their draft positions determined by alphabetical
order.</TE>
<TE>   Appleby, therefore, picked first. But after that, there was only
more confusion. Els looked at Elkington. Elkington looked at Els.
Let's see, K comes before S, right?</TE>
<TE>   Evidently, golfers are much better with numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, officials had their pairings. Elkington and Levet were
grouped together and would tee off first, followed by Appleby and
Els.</TE>
<TE>   Tirico quickly asked the question that had to be raised.</TE>
<TE>   "You guys find it strange at all that it's not all four together
out here at once in the playoffs--that it's two and two?" he
wondered.</TE>
<TE>   Ian Baker-Finch said he was "really surprised."</TE>
<TE>   Curtis Strange said he would "rather have everybody together,
watch what's going on out there. Makes for great theater."</TE>
<TE>   Tirico called it "bizarre and different."</TE>
<TE>   Strange and Baker-Finch debated which group held an advantage
during the playoff. Baker-Finch opted for the second, reasoning they
would see the scores just posted by the first and could adjust their
strategy accordingly. Strange said the first group could dictate
pace, quipping that they "can slow the play of the second group,
throw 'em off."</TE>
<TE>   Along with television commentators and viewers.</TE>
<TE>   On their first hole, Levet made par and Elkington made bogey. Els
and Appleby then proceeded with their tee shots. ABC cut to
commercial, leaving Tirico to report, with all the accuracy available
at the moment, "I guess Levet's leading for now."</TE>
<TE>   Playoff golf is as dramatic as the sport gets, but Sunday, the
traditional brand of suspense--who's going to win?--was replaced by
something altogether different--who's leading and who's trailing? And
who just birdied that hole over there? Els and Appleby had to wonder
after Levet, well beyond their view, caused the crowd to roar ahead
of them.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe," Strange mused, "somebody will tell them."</TE>
<TE>   Just the way they used to do it at the 1902 British Open.</TE>
<TE>   Helpfully, Appleby and Elkington fell out of contention after the
fourth playoff hole, leaving Els and Levet on their own for sudden
death. That much, everyone could follow. Then Els finished a stroke
ahead of Levet on the next hole. Finally, a clear-cut result: Els,
alone at last, was the winner.</TE>
<TE>   Twosomes may have worked for Noah, back when the playing
conditions were nearly as wet as Saturday's. But Sunday, British Open
officials needed to heed the oldest links call of all, give or take
the proper spelling.</TE>

<DL>GULLANE, Scotland</DL>
<LD>There won't be any Grand Slam buzz, but the PGA Championship is going
to go on anyway.</LD>
<LD>   Next month's PGA at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minn.,
missed its chance to become one of the most memorable events in golf
when Tiger Woods was blown away Saturday at Muirfield and lost his
chance to win the British Open.</LD>
<LD>   Woods closed with a 65 Sunday and finished at even-par 284 for the
tournament--16 shots better than his third-round 81 that effectively
removed any Grand Slam suspense from the PGA Championship.</LD>
<TE>   The fourth and final major of the year, the PGA's status has long
suffered in comparison to its older, more established peers--the
Masters, the U.S. Open and the British Open. All that would have
changed if Woods had won at Muirfield and set up his chance to win
the Grand Slam at Hazeltine.</TE>
<TE>   Woods says his view of the PGA hasn't changed now that his shot at
a calendar-year Slam is out of the question.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a major championship," he said. "[I will] try and get ready
the best I possibly can."</TE>
<TE>   Tickets to the PGA did not sell out until after Woods won the U.S.
Open last month. While it is officially a sellout, not all of the 55
corporate hospitality tents have been sold. Tickets for the general
public are gone, all 40,000 a day, from the $250 to $350 weekly
tickets to the exclusive Wanamaker Club.</TE>
<TE>   David Toms, who beat Phil Mickelson by one shot at Atlanta
Athletic Club, is defending champion. Woods won in 1999 and 2000.</TE>

<HD>Top Price for Ferdinand</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The drawn-out battle over Rio Ferdinand reached its foregone
conclusion Sunday when Leeds United agreed to sell the England
national team player to Manchester United for $47 million, a deal
that will make Ferdinand the most expensive defender in soccer
history.</LD>
<LD>   The transfer fee is a British record for any player, surpassing
the $45 million that Manchester United paid Lazio for Argentina
national team midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron only a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   Leeds United was reluctant to let Ferdinand go, and twice turned
down lesser offers from Manchester United. In the end, though,
Ferdinand, 23, was determined to switch to a club that he believes
will give him a better chance of playing in top-level competition.</LD>
<TE>   "I just feel I need [European] Champions League football to help
my career," Ferdinand told England's Sun tabloid newspaper last week.
"A footballer has a short career, and you have to make the most of
your opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Leeds, which finished fifth in the English Premier
League last season and therefore failed to qualify for the Champions
League, could neither deny Ferdinand nor turn down the $47 million, a
figure 30% higher than Manchester United's initial offer.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not want to sell Rio Ferdinand, but he asked for a transfer
last week and when your captain says he does not want to play for
your club, there comes a time when you have to make a decision and
move on," Peter Ridsdale, Leeds United's chairman, told Sky Sports on
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel a mixture of disappointment and some elation that the deal
has been completed."</TE>
<TE>   The previous record-holder as the world's most expensive defender
was France national team player Lilian Thuram, who was bought by
Juventus from Parma last year for $35.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Leeds United made a $19-million profit on Ferdinand, who still had
four years remaining on his Leeds United contract. The club purchased
him from West Ham United for $28 million in November 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Rivaldo Released by Barcelona</TE>
<TE>   Rivaldo, whose five goals at Korea/Japan '02 helped Brazil win the
World Cup only three weeks ago, was given his unconditional release
by Barcelona, in essence a free transfer that allows him to join any
club in the world without that club having to pay Barcelona anything.</TE>
<TE>   Rivaldo, the FIFA world player of the year and European player of
the year as recently as 1999, was acquired by Barcelona from fellow
Spanish team Deportivo La Coruna for $26.7 million in 1997. He still
had one year remaining on his contract when he was released.</TE>
<TE>   "Both sides believe that this decision is in their best
interests," Barcelona said in a statement on the club's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Rivaldo, 30, helped Barcelona win two Spanish championships but
was ineffective last season and the return of Coach Luis Van Gaal,
who had had run-ins with the Brazilian during his first tenure as
coach of the Catalan club, signaled the end for Rivaldo.</TE>
<TE>   His departure became likely once Barcelona signed Argentine
playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme earlier in the month and certain once
Barcelona acquired Spanish midfielder Gaizka Mendieta on a one-year
loan from Lazio on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish newspapers speculated Sunday that Rivaldo, who earns $7.5
million a year, could join fellow Brazilian Roberto Carlos at Real
Madrid, although a move to Lazio also is possible.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Women Down Norway</TE>
<TE>   Cindy Parlow scored two goals, Tiffeny Milbrett had a goal and two
assists and Mia Hamm scored in the final minute as the U.S. women's
national team shut out Norway, 4-0, Sunday in a friendly match in
Blaine, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   The victory ended the Norwegians' four-game winning streak over
the U.S. Norway still holds an 18-14-2 edge in the all-time series
between the reigning world and Olympic champions.</TE>
<TE>   Maldini Confirms Retirement</TE>
<TE>   Paolo Maldini, Italy's national team captain and all-time
appearance leader, confirmed what he had said after the World Cup,
that he is retiring from international competition.</TE>
<TE>   Italy Coach Giovanni Trapattoni had tried to get Maldini to delay
his retirement until after the 2004 European Championship in
Portugal, but was rebuffed.</TE>
<TE>   "I have thought a lot about the national side, and my decision has
not changed," Maldini said. "Trapattoni and my teammates have tried
to change my mind, but the fundamental thing is that someone who is
34 years of age cannot think about playing in the European
Championship in 2004."</TE>

<HD>Peirsol Makes Most of Her Record Situation</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hayley Peirsol wasn't aiming for a meet record in the 1,500-meter
freestyle Sunday at the Janet Evans Invitational, not until she heard
her teammates rooting for her to stay on pace during the closing laps
at the McDonald's Swim Stadium at USC.</LD>
<LD>   So Peirsol, who will be senior this fall at Newport Harbor High,
put her head down and won in 16 minutes 27.78 seconds, bettering the
3-year-old meet record of 16:28.53, held by 2000 Olympic bronze
medalist Kaitlin Sandeno of Lake Forest.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't even know what the record was," said Peirsol, 16, whose
brother Aaron, is the world-record holder in the 200 backstroke.
"During the race I could tell something was going on, so I said to
myself, 'I better get it after all this.' "</LD>
<TE>   Three other meet records were set on the final day.</TE>
<TE>   Erik Vendt of USC set his third meet record of the four-day event,
winning the 1,500 freestyle in 15:06.70, the eighth-fastest time by
an American. Vendt, the NCAA men's swimmer of the year last spring,
also set meet records Saturday in the 200 breaststroke and 400
individual medley. Chris Thompson, the 2000 Olympic bronze medalist
and U.S.-record holder in the event, finished second in 15:15.90.</TE>
<TE>   Natalie Coughlin of California, the U.S.-record holder in the 100
backstroke, set a meet record of 1:00.52 in the event. Her time broke
B.J. Bedford's 4-year-old meet record by more than a second.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Phelps of Baltimore set a meet record in the 100
butterfly. Phelps, the world-record holder in the 200 butterfly,
finished in 53.44, breaking a 2-year-old record held by Mike Mintenko
of Palo Alto. Phelps missed another meet record by 0.06 of a second
in the 200 individual medley, winning in 2:02.60, his third victory
of the meet.</TE>
<TE>   Lenny Krayzelburg defeated Aaron Peirsol in the 100 backstroke,
making up for a close loss to Peirsol in the 200 backstroke Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Krayzelburg, a USC graduate and world-record holder in the event,
finished first in 55.00, followed by Peirsol in 55.18.</TE>

<HD>This Young Gun Ready to Make a Dent</HD>

<LD>He's 21, a professional athlete, lives with some of his buddies in
Huntington Beach and has a certain appeal among teenage girls.</LD>
<LD>   If this sounds like the description of someone who parties every
night, well, Taylor Dent would very politely disagree. There are no
fast times. He's no Jeff Spicoli. Actually, not even half a Spicoli.</LD>
<LD>   Really.</LD>
<TE>   And his new Australian tennis coach, Paul Kilderry, backs him up,
praising his work ethic and ability to maintain his focus off the
court.</TE>
<TE>   This is necessary information because it helps put Dent's recent
celebration after he won his first professional tournament into the
proper context. He beat James Blake in the final at Newport, R.I.,
July 14, joining his dad, Phil, in the record book--they became the
first father and son to win ATP titles in the Open era.</TE>
<TE>   "I never go out drinking, but I went out drinking and I got
hammered," Dent said, chuckling, as he recalled the night of
shooters. "Because my coach said that if you have a great career, you
are probably going to win 50 tournaments, so this is going to be one
of those 50. It doesn't happen often, he said, so I may as well enjoy
it while it lasts."</TE>
<TE>   Phil Dent, who won two ATP titles in the '70s and reached the 1974
Australian Open final, was the one who informed Taylor of the family
milestone.</TE>
<TE>   "I actually didn't even know afterward," Taylor said. "My dad
called me the next day as I was fighting my hangover and he told me,
'Hey, you put us in history yesterday.' I thought that was pretty
neat; not many people get to make history."</TE>
<TE>   Now his father, family and friends will get the chance to watch
him play close to home. Dent is in the Mercedes-Benz Cup, which
starts today at UCLA, and opens against Neville Godwin of South
Africa. He could face No. 7 Xavier Malisse of Belgium in the second
round. They are in the same half of the draw as No. 1 Tommy Haas of
Germany and No. 4 Andy Roddick.</TE>
<TE>   Dent joined Roddick, who has won two tournaments, as two young
Americans who have earned a title on the ATP tour in 2002. They,
along with Blake, were members of a roster of young male tennis
prospects The Times assembled in 2001 called "The Replacements," a
group that would be followed with periodic updates. (Twins Mike and
Bob Bryan count as one entry.)</TE>
<TE>   Success has varied wildly. Roddick reached the quarterfinals of
the U.S. Open later that summer and nearly defeated eventual champion
Lleyton Hewitt but has struggled in Grand Slam events since. Blake
has lost in two finals this year, to Roddick in Memphis, Tenn., and
Dent in Newport.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about potential replacements started after the storied
generation of American male players turned 30, with people wondering
about the next Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi or Michael Chang.</TE>
<TE>   It was Agassi who helped end Dent's hangover after his Newport
win.</TE>
<TE>   "I was back at it the next day--I had to be, I was hitting with
Andre," Dent said. "I had to be on my toes. I was too nervous to have
the celebration get in the way of my celebration."</TE>
<TE>   Kilderry has helped make a noticeable difference in Dent's
footwork. He seems lighter on his feet and his agility has improved,
particularly at the net. The work on his psyche has been even more
important.</TE>
<TE>   "He's definitely a player with a lot of potential, sort of like an
uncut diamond really," Kilderry said. "At times, he was trying to be
the best player in the world every day of the week. You just go out
there and get the job done, rather than going out there to try to set
the world on fire."</TE>
<TE>   Said Dent: "Paul has really helped me improve my attitude and I
think that's the biggest thing he has done for me. In previous years,
I didn't think the attitude was a big deal. I used to think that if
your shots are good enough that you are going to be there, but that's
definitely not the case."</TE>
<TE>   Replacements Update</TE>
<TE>   Roddick--Up: Will turn 20 during the U.S. Open and already has won
five titles, three in 2001 and two this year. Down: Stalled at Grand
Slam events with a second-round exit at Australian Open, first-round
loss at the French Open and third-round loss to Greg Rusedski at
Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   Blake--Up: Reached two finals this year and earned spot on U.S.
Davis Cup team in first two rounds. Down: Continued trend of losing
dramatic five-setters in the second round, at Australian Open, French
Open and Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   Robby Ginepri--Up: Second American teenager in the top 100 this
year, joining Roddick, and reached the semifinals at Newport. Down:
Played only one singles match at a Grand Slam event this year, losing
opener at French Open.</TE>
<TE>   Mardy Fish--Up: Won doubles point with Blake against Slovakia in
the first round of Davis Cup in February. Down: Seemed to have
disappeared until making the quarterfinals at Newport.</TE>
<TE>   Bob and Mike Bryan--Up: Won four doubles titles in 2002 at
Memphis, Acapulco, Scottsdale, Ariz., and Newport, and reached
semifinals at Wimbledon. Down: What do they have to do to get on the
Davis Cup team?</TE>
<TE>   Michael Russell--Up: Reached the third round at Queen's Club on
grass. Down: Has not been able to get out of the first round at a
Grand Slam event since holding match point against Gustavo Kuerten in
the fourth round of the 2001 French Open.</TE>
<TE>   Phillip King--Up: Won two matches in qualifying for the
Mercedes-Benz event at UCLA. Down: Lost in the final round of
qualifying to Jack Brasington, winning five games.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Baker/Rajeev Ram--Up: Reached the junior doubles final at
Wimbledon, losing, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, to the Romanian team of Florin
Mergea and Horia Tecau. Down: Haven't made an impact in junior
singles events at Grand Slam tournaments in 2002.</TE>

<DL>MONT VENTOUX, France</DL>
<LD>As he closes in on a fourth straight Tour de France title, Lance
Armstrong is hearing a familiar but unwelcome chant from fans lining
the route.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, after another strong performance in the mountains
extended his overall lead to almost 4 1/2 minutes, Armstrong had
heard enough.</LD>
<LD>   "If I had a dollar for every time somebody yelled, 'Doe-PAY!
Doe-PAY!' [French for 'Doped! Doped!'], I'd be a rich man," he said.
"It's disappointing."</LD>
<TE>   Thanks to a stunning sprint up formidable Mont Ventoux on Sunday,
Armstrong stretched his lead over Joseba Beloki in the standings to 4
minutes 21 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   The run wasn't enough for the Texan to win the stage, though.
Armstrong finished third, 2:20 behind winner Richard Virenque of
France, who led for the last 125 miles of the 137-mile 14th leg.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of fans turned out for the stage, but not all were on
Armstrong's side.</TE>
<TE>   "The people are not very sportsmanlike, some of them," the U.S.
Postal Service rider said. "A boo is a lot louder than a cheer. If
you have 10 people cheering and one person booing, all you hear is
the boo."</TE>
<TE>   Many fans waved the U.S. flag and banners with Armstrong's name.
But they were outnumbered by those supporting the French, Belgian,
Italian and German riders.</TE>
<TE>   Virenque is one of the riders who's most popular with French fans,
even though two years ago he confessed to taking drugs when competing
for the Festina team.</TE>
<TE>   That whole squad, including Virenque, was thrown out of the 1998
Tour when a stash of banned drugs was found in a team car.</TE>
<TE>   Since he started dominating the Tour in 1999, Armstrong has heard
accusations of drug use. He steadfastly denies using performance
enhancers and has never failed a drug test.</TE>
<TE>   He said he couldn't understand the behavior of fans who jeer him.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's an indication of their intelligence," he said. "I'm
not here to be friends with a bunch of people who stand at the side
of the road, who've had too much to drink, and want to yell.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an issue of class: Do you have class, or do you not have
class?"</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong said the gibes didn't affect him, though he looked
tense.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really care. Nor will I care in three or four years when
I'm sitting on the beach with my kids, having a cool beer," Armstrong
said.</TE>
<TE>   Virenque's win was the fifth stage victory of his Tour career but
the first since returning from a nine-month ban that prevented him
from riding in last year's competition.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Led by forwards Tangela Smith and La'Keshia Frett, the Sacramento
Monarchs held off the Orlando Miracle, 62-60, Sunday night before
7,564 at Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   The Miracle scored eight consecutive points to tie the score,
58-58, before Smith stepped past two defenders to bank in a shot from
close range with 1:02 remaining.</LD>
<LD>   Frett followed with two free throws for a 62-58 lead.</LD>
<TE>   After Orlando's Shannon Johnson made two free throws with 24
seconds left, Adrienne Johnson and Nykesha Sales each missed
perimeter shots in the final 12 seconds as the Miracle (10-11) lost
for the fifth time in six games.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who has benefited from the return of center Yolanda
Griffith to the Sacramento lineup the last five games, finished with
16 points and a career-high 13 rebounds. Frett added 15 points, and
Griffith had 13 points and 10 rebounds for the Monarchs (5-16).</TE>
<TE>   Johnson had 21 points for Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   Portland 87, Phoenix 75--Tamicha Jackson scored 17 of her 19
points in the second half to lead the Fire (14-9) past the Mercury
(8-14) before 8,694 at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   It was Portland's 10th victory in 11 games. Jackson, who made
seven of 12 shots, including four of six three-point shots, fueled a
second-half surge that gave Portland a 70-63 lead with 4:02 left.
Phoenix's Jennifer Gillom led all scorers with 26 points.</TE>

<HD>Ball Bounces Yankees' Way</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Williams' hit in the ninth goes past Boston's
Nixon to tie the score and New York wins it, 9-8, moments later on a
walk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>No matter what the New York Yankees do wrong, somehow everything
seems to go right--especially against the Boston Red Sox.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Giambi led off the bottom of the ninth inning with an
excuse-me single, right fielder Trot Nixon's error let the tying run
score and Jorge Posada drew a bases-loaded walk from Ugueth Urbina
that gave the Yankees a 9-8 victory over the Red Sox on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "It's unbelievable the magic that happens around here," Giambi
said.</LD>
<TE>   Yankee starter Jeff Weaver tied a team record by giving up five
home runs--two each to Nomar Garciaparra and Manny Ramirez--as the
Red Sox rallied to take an 8-7 lead.</TE>
<TE>   But Giambi began the ninth with a check-swing single toward third
base against an overshifted defense. Pinch-runner Enrique Wilson then
scored when Bernie Williams' ground single rolled right through
Nixon.</TE>
<TE>   "It took a funny hop," Nixon said. "Either way, I made the error.
People can say what they want, but that cost us the game."</TE>
<TE>   Williams reached third, and Robin Ventura and Raul Mondesi were
walked intentionally to load the bases. Manager Grady Little lifted
Nixon for Lou Merloni and played five infielders, with left fielder
Ramirez in shallow center.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't matter. With the sellout crowd of 55,581 on its feet,
Urbina (0-5) walked Posada, hitless in 13 at-bats, on a 3-and-2 pitch
to force in the winning run. It was Urbina's third blown save in 27
chances.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Stanton (4-1) pitched two scoreless innings for the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of the most exciting weekends I've ever spent in the
game of baseball," Little said. "I don't know if it's us being
snakebit or them having some Irish luck."</TE>
<TE>   After Pedro Martinez won, 4-2, in the series opener, the Red Sox
lost two games, each 9-8. Had they won both games, the Red Sox would
have moved into first place in the American League East by percentage
points ahead of the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   "To come back against them two days in a row--and they're a good
club--I hope we're in their heads, but I doubt it," Manager Joe Torre
said. "They're still beating us in the season series."</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox are 8-6 against the Yankees. The teams play five more
times, starting in late August.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver couldn't hold a 4-0 lead in his first pressure start since
being acquired from Detroit on July 5.</TE>
<TE>   "Five home runs is quite embarrassing to say the least," Weaver
said. "At the same time, guys around here have been good about
letting me know that there's an adjustment period, no matter who it
is."</TE>
<TE>   John Cumberland gave up five homers for the Yankees on May 24,
1970, at Cleveland. The major league record is six, by several
pitchers.</TE>

<HD>FDA Wants More Tests on Drug to Help Alcoholics</HD>
<DH>Addiction* Studies have found acamprosate free of serious
side effects, helpful in promoting abstinence. But the agency wants
another U.S. clinical trial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ahighly anticipated new drug to help recovering alcoholics remain
abstinent has been rejected by the Food and Drug Administration.</LD>
<LD>   The agency turned down the application to market acamprosate,
telling its manufacturer, Merck KGaA of Germany, that the company had
not adequately demonstrated the medication's safety and efficacy. The
FDA requested that Merck KGaA conduct at least one more U.S. clinical
trial.</LD>
<LD>   Previous studies on acamprosate, which has long been used in
Europe, showed it to be free of serious side effects and modestly
helpful in increasing the chances of abstinence in motivated
individuals.</LD>
<TE>   In February, the FDA agreed to expedite its review of acamprosate,
and in May an FDA advisory committee voted 8-2 to recommend approval
of the drug.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors and therapists are increasingly interested in using
multiple treatment methods--including drug therapy--to help
alcoholics, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Acamprosate, and an approved medication called naltrexone, in
particular, address the physiological aspects of addiction and
relapse.</TE>
<TE>   Acamprosate was designed to treat the excessive stimulation of
certain neurotransmitters in the brain that sometimes occurs after
alcohol withdrawal. The increase in these brain chemicals causes
insomnia, irritability and agitation in some recovering drinkers,
which can lead to relapse.</TE>
<TE>   Merck KGaA officials said they have requested a meeting with the
FDA to discuss the denial.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very surprised here on that decision because the FDA's
own advisory committee voted, in the weeks before, strongly in favor
of getting it to the market," said Hartmut Vennen, a spokesman for
Merck KGaA. "We don't have any information that efficacy and safety
could be a problem. So we are very curious to see what the [FDA's]
concerns are."</TE>
<TE>   Vennen said the company remains optimistic that it can bring the
medication to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that there is a high unmet need for such a drug," he
said. "It's doing well here in Europe, and we have a lot of
experience with it."</TE>
<TE>   Acamprosate would have been the first new medication for
alcoholism in seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Forest Laboratories holds the U.S. marketing and distribution
rights for acamprosate, should it eventually reach the U.S. market.</TE>

<HD>Beta-Blockers' Side Effects Relatively Rare, Study Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A class of highly effective heart drugs called beta-blockers have
developed a reputation for causing depression, impotence and fatigue.
But a new study has found that the drugs' reputed side effects have
been overblown.</LD>
<LD>   The study of 15 trials involving 35,000 patients was conducted by
researchers trying to understand why so many physicians are reluctant
to prescribe beta-blockers, even though they lower blood pressure;
improve heart function and survival in patients with heart failure;
and reduce deaths after heart attacks by 20%. By blocking the effects
of stress hormones on the heart, beta-blockers slow the heart rate
and the force of contraction, easing the heart's workload.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz, a cardiologist at the Yale University
School of Medicine, had found in a 1995 study that 50% of heart
attack patients who could benefit from beta-blockers weren't getting
them; he estimates that figure could be as high as 75% today.</LD>
<TE>   Krumholz and his colleagues figured that perhaps doctors were
being deterred by side effects long associated with beta-blockers
like Inderal (propranolol), Tenormin (atenolol) and Lopressor
(metoprolol). Although the FDA-approved package inserts prepared by
drug manufacturers warn about the side effects, Krumholz said, "most
of the conventional wisdom was anecdotal. There was no systematic
review of this association."</TE>
<TE>   So he and his colleagues decided to review published studies to
see whether study subjects actually suffered more of those side
effects than people not taking them.</TE>
<TE>   In findings published in last week's Journal of the American
Medical Assn., the researchers reported no increase in depression
among those taking the drugs compared with those taking a dummy pill.
About 1 in 5 people in either group had depressive symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Fatigue was more significant, affecting about 1 in 3 patients
taking the medications and just more than 30% of those getting a
placebo. That translates into one additional report of fatigue for
every 57 patients treated with beta-blockers for a year. (The authors
noted that older beta-blockers accounted for more fatigue than more
recently developed pills.)</TE>
<TE>   Sexual dysfunction--such as loss of desire and impotence--affected
more than 1 in 5 patients on beta-blockers and slightly fewer study
subjects on placebos. The drugs were associated with one extra report
of sexual dysfunction for every 199 patients taking them.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to beta-blockers, several other classes of medications
are used to lower blood pressure and treat heart failure. One of
them, the calcium channel blockers, relax blood vessels, increase the
amount of oxygen to the heart and reduce the heart's workload. Drugs
known as ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,
relax blood vessels and prevent retention of salt and water. The
newer angiotensin II receptor blockers also relax blood vessels.</TE>

<HD>Assisted Living's Hidden Fees</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marie Sinclair thought it was a perk of her residency at an
assisted-living center in Fairfax, Va., when she was offered a van
ride to her doctor's appointment. Then she got her monthly bill,
which showed a special transportation charge of $65.</LD>
<LD>   "I just couldn't believe it when I saw the bill," said Sinclair,
78. "I thought they were being nice by giving me a ride to the
doctor. Nobody told me they charge extra for something like this."</LD>
<LD>   Sinclair now asks friends or one of her bridge partners for a ride
when she needs to go to the grocery store or doctor. She can't afford
many extra charges on top of the hefty $3,680 per month she pays for
her apartment and three meals daily. "I love free things," she says,
"but there sure aren't many of them in here."</LD>
<TE>   Like many older Americans, Sinclair has learned one of the hard
lessons of the world of assisted living. Much like a fancy restaurant
that charges separately for the main course and every side dish, the
assisted-living industry is marked by a-la-carte services.</TE>
<TE>   It's important for older people and their families to understand
the potential financial pitfalls when mulling a move to an
assisted-living facility. The process of relocating Mom or Dad from a
well-loved home to unfamiliar surroundings is fraught with emotion,
and family members can be at their most vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   Assisted living is a catch-all term for housing units established
for people who aren't able to maintain themselves in their home or
apartment. But these individuals are relatively healthy and don't
need special, round-the-clock skilled medical care offered in a
nursing home. This increasingly popular form of housing goes by
dozens of names: extended care, adult-care residency and
board-and-care. In California, they are officially known as
"residential care facilities for the elderly," and are regulated by
the California Department of Social Services. Some high-end
facilities have glossy brochures showing elegant lobbies, fancy
furniture and often a photo of a sincere-looking admissions director.
Forget all that unless you have an unlimited budget. Concentrate on
the details of the contract, paying special attention to any "extra"
needs that the resident might require. The first rule is, if it's not
offered in the contract, you probably won't get it. Don't count on
vague statements by facility managers who promise to take care of all
your mother's needs if her health begins to deteriorate. You need to
know every specific service they can provide--and how much each task
will cost.</TE>
<TE>   Too often, consumers don't know what they are signing. A 1999
report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, said, "marketing material, contracts, and other written
material provided by the facilities are often incomplete and are
sometimes vague or misleading [and] only 25% of facilities routinely
provide their document to prospective residents before they decide to
apply for admission." Contract terms vary widely, and there are lots
of potential pitfalls. Security deposits and cleaning deposits are
not permitted under California state regulations, but some facilities
have been known to request them.</TE>
<TE>   Pre-admission charges, or screening fees, for new residents are
legal, but they are also a tip-off that consumers should be aware and
skeptical. Most facilities don't charge such fees, which can range
from hundreds to thousands of dollars. In fact, one study of
California facilities found that only 29% had such fees. They provide
nothing other than an additional source of revenue for the facility.</TE>
<TE>   California has 6,200 facilities with a total of 147,000 residents.
The basic fees at a typical facility in California range from $1,500
to $2,250 a month, according to a report by California Advocates for
Nursing Reform, a consumer group. Less expensive facilities charge
about $800 a month, and they are largely for people on Supplemental
Security Income, a federal program for the poor elderly. Fancier
assisted-living facilities may charge $4,000 a month or more for
basic room and board.</TE>
<TE>   For all facilities, regardless of size and amenities, prospective
consumers should ask lots of questions to minimize unexpected fees.
The Consumer Consortium on Assisted Living developed a guidebook with
Metropolitan Life Insurance that suggested some questions families
should ask:</TE>
<TE>   * Does housekeeping include only light dusting, and is there any
extra charge for cleaning bathrooms, floors and windows? Is there a
separate fee for doing personal laundry?</TE>
<TE>   * Do units have separate telephones and how is billing handled?</TE>
<TE>   * Are monthly residence and fees still charged if a person is away
in the hospital, or on an extended visit with relatives?</TE>
<TE>   The issue is especially important for the growing number of
residents who need more care than an occasional knock on their
apartment door or reminders to take their medications.</TE>
<TE>   Anita Parks, of Richmond, Calif., moved her mother, Deloris Parks,
into a facility in Oakland at a base cost of $1,390 a month. Deloris,
who suffers from arthritis and emphysema, uses an oxygen tank and
needs assistance bathing and getting dressed. Those services cost an
additional $250 a month under a complex system the facility uses to
rate the degree of assistance provided by its staff. Within a few
months, the extra charges jumped to $500 a month, when the rating
system was changed without advance notification, according to Anita.
Later, she was told her mother needed a higher level of assistance
that would cost more than $800 a month. She now needed help getting
in and out of bed each day, and that would drive up her rating.</TE>
<TE>   Anita was flabbergasted. "My mother said one of the aides helped
her in and out of bed for a few days when she wasn't feeling well,"
she recalled. "My mother thought he just volunteered to help her."</TE>
<TE>   Anita couldn't afford the higher fees and moved her mother to a
more affordable small group home in Cameron Park that didn't have as
many extra fees. The new location is a 210-mile round-trip from her
home in Richmond, which means she can visit her mother only every
week or 10 days. Anita Parks complained to California lawmakers and
testified recently at a legislative hearing. There is legislation
pending to require facilities to give 60-day notice--the current rule
is 30-day notice--before any increase in basic rates.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Parkses, most residents of assisted-living centers and
their families pay out of pocket. Medicare doesn't cover any of the
costs, and relatively few people have purchased long-term care
insurance to cover the exigencies of old age. Confusion among
consumers because of the extra and unexpected charges has been a
major problem, acknowledges the California Assisted Living Facilities
Assn., an industry group that has developed a consumer disclosure
statement.</TE>

<HD>A Visit With Dr. Deluxe</HD>
<DH>Red-carpet treatment can be had for a price. But is
'boutique' worth it?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENEDICT CAREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine a doctor who takes time to ask you about your family or chat
about a movie. Who guarantees that you won't have to wait long for an
appointment and even makes house calls. A doctor, in short, who
provides the same VIP service you'd receive flying first class.</LD>
<LD>   You'd have to pay first-class prices, of course.</LD>
<LD>   One of the latest signs of the continuing backlash against
managed-care medicine is so-called boutique doctors who promise
red-carpet service to patients for a fixed fee, usually from $1,000
to $4,000 a year. These doctors, working individually or in groups,
promise round-the-clock access, comprehensive annual exams and longer
appointments, as well as other niceties.</LD>
<TE>   For the doctors, these arrangements allow them to see fewer
patients while preserving--or enhancing--their incomes. While a
typical primary care doctor may have 2,000 to 3,000 patients under
his or her care, boutique doctors aim to trim their patient load to
fewer than 600.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the difference between night and day," said Dr. Bernard
Kaminetsky, who set up a boutique, or "retainer," practice in Florida
a year ago through a company called MDVIP . He used to see up to 35
patients a day; now he sees no more than 10. Patients tell him
they're happier, and so is Kaminetsky: He gets home in time to eat
dinner with his family.</TE>
<TE>   The concept, which originated in Seattle in the mid-1990s, has
since spread to Arizona, California, Massachusetts and Florida.
Consumer interest in such first-class service reflects widespread
frustration with the confusion and anonymity of modern medicine, in
which patients often are bounced among doctors and health plans,
straining the doctor-patient relationship. The "boutique" solution is
especially appealing to more affluent middle-age and older people who
have ongoing health concerns, and little patience for the hassles and
rules of managed care. The yearly premiums are not covered by
insurance, and many of the medical services, including office visits,
may be only partly covered, if at all.</TE>
<TE>   "We have business executives, professional people, older couples
who want more time with their doctor," said Amin Neghabat, director
of the Lewis and John Dare Center retainer program at Virginia Mason
Medical Center in Seattle. The Dare Center has more than 1,000
members, with an average age of 62, who each pay $3,000 a year for
the deluxe services.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, the number of doctors charging retainer fees is
small--probably no more than 200, according to Dr. F. Maxton Mauney,
who investigated the practices for the American Medical Assn.--and
it's still too early to say whether the practices will be a
cornerstone of medicine or a curiosity, he said. Nonetheless, they
already have captured the attention of some members of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "If every doctor started doing this, it'd be the end of Medicare,"
said U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), who recently introduced a bill
that would prevent Medicare and Medicaid from reimbursing doctors who
charge a retainer fee. "We believe it's wrong, and we're going to try
to stop it." In March, five Democratic congressmen signed a letter
calling on the Bush administration to review retainer practices to
make sure they don't already violate Medicare laws.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors themselves are divided on the ethics of retainer medicine.
Said Dr. Richard Roberts, chairman of the American Academy of Family
Physicians, "I feel I'm already available to my patients 24-7, and so
are most family physicians. We don't need to do a wallet check
first." The American Medical Assn. has no objection to retainer
contracts, however. A report delivered to the AMA board by Mauney
last month raised concerns about doctors dropping patients to go
boutique, but otherwise it found that the practices present no threat
to patient care. "Our position is that citizens have the right to
strike a contract with their doctor, just like they do with their
lawyer or any other professional," said Dr. Yank Coble, president of
the AMA.</TE>
<TE>   In California, health-care regulations do not specifically address
the arrangements. Any business that charges up front for medical
services is considered a health maintenance organization, and is
subject to licensing fees, financial disclosure and a host of other
regulations, said Daniel Zingale, director of the Department of
Managed Health Care, which regulates health plans. But it's an open
question whether doctors who charge retainer fees are in fact
providing medical care in return--or simply more time and better
service, he said. "It's very new, and we're still sorting through
it," Zingale said.</TE>
<TE>   If the practices are regarded as HMOs, the licensing fees and
other requirements could stop them before they get off the ground,
said Daniel Yakoubian, a California attorney who specializes in
representing medical groups and hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, some California doctors have been testing the
waters. Last month, Edward L. Smith of Laguna Niguel began enrolling
members at $1,500 a year, which includes comprehensive physical
exams, same-day appointments, and around-the-clock access, among
other things. He plans to limit the practice to 300 patients. Earlier
this month, a Mission Viejo-based outfit called Axis Medical opened
with one doctor, Dr. Joseph Nguyen, and plans to add half a dozen
more. The yearly fee of about $3,000 will include advice on disease
prevention, 24-7 access to doctors and coordination of specialist
visits, among other services, said Dr. James Keany, Axis' founder.
Interactive Wellness System, a highly exclusive two-doctor practice
in Menlo Park, is planning to add two more physicians.</TE>
<TE>   On a much larger scale, practices such as Palo Alto Medical
Foundation, a multispecialty group with more than 450 doctors, also
have investigated retainer services. The group would like to give
patients the option of paying for more access but may not be able to
because of a shortage of primary care doctors in the system. "We've
had to stop taking patients in primary care because of a shortage of
doctors," said Jill Antonides, a spokeswoman for the group. "We've
got to address our commitment to the community before trying any
premium service."</TE>
<TE>   The issues are different for doctors in solo practice. "You just
become a rat on a treadmill working in the HMO system, taking 30 to
35 patients a day," said Smith, who quit practicing for a year after
almost a decade working at a large group practice in Laguna Beach.
"In starting this service, all I wanted was to practice medicine
again, to return to an old-fashioned family practice where the
patients felt like family."</TE>
<TE>   The rewards of having a doctor on call are almost immediate, say
members. "Just the fact that you can pick up the phone and you'll be
talking to someone who knows who you are--that's worth a whole lot,"
said Bridget Skinner, 42, a mother of two living in Laguna Beach who
with her husband has joined Smith's practice. Skinner recently passed
her previous doctor at the mall and nodded to him. He stared back,
blankly. "Not a smile, not a nod, not even a look saying, 'Do I know
you from the gym?' " said Skinner. "Nothing. He hadn't the vaguest
idea of who I was. I'd much rather pay extra and have someone who
knows me."</TE>
<TE>   At its best, this kind of relationship with a doctor can mean the
difference between life and death. Bob Sage, 71, a retired TV
producer living in Seattle, has been paying $3,000 a year for two
years, to be a part of the Lewis and John Dare Center practice. One
night after joining the practice, Sage, who lives alone, had stomach
cramps so crippling that he called his doctor, Dr. John Kirkpatrick,
at home. From Sage's description, Kirkpatrick diagnosed a ruptured
gall bladder; then jumped in his car, picked up his patient at home
and drove to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "He helped me get through registration and all that baloney, and
two hours after the call, I was in surgery," said Sage. "Without that
kind of help, I don't know that I would have made it."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, said Sage, the VIP treatment ends once you get
to the specialist's office. "I picked out a very good arthritis
specialist I wanted to see, and I had to wait a month to get in," he
said. "When you go to the hospital or see another doctor, you're just
like any HMO patient."</TE>
<TE>   Cushy as it sounds, no one can say for certain whether this
red-carpet service actually makes a person healthier than an average
HMO plan.</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand, researchers find that simply having a regular
primary-care doctor is a strong predictor of long life; people with
regular access to a family doctor are less likely to die of a stroke,
for example, than those who don't have a physician readily available,
some studies find. A relaxed, 20-minute conversation with a doctor
certainly is far more soothing than a rushed, five-minute
one--several patient surveys have confirmed this common-sense
observation.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, it's not clear that spending more time with a
doctor measurably improves a person's health.</TE>
<TE>   "The more time spent around the doctor, the more medical tests are
likely to be done, and sometimes that makes patients anxious about
things they don't need to be worried about," said Roberts. "There's
the risk that this becomes a diversion, that you're medicalizing
their life too much.</TE>
<TE>   "Then the question is, 'Have you done them any good?' "</TE>
<TE>   The future of retainer medicine depends on how lawmakers treat the
issue, and just how exasperated consumers are with their current
health plans. As much as health-care costs have gone up, consumers
still are not accustomed to paying hundreds or thousands of dollars
to see a doctor. As long as the big doctor groups stay out of the
retainer market, it will be up to small and solo operators, like
Smith and Axis Medical, to sell the idea of membership fees. So far,
Smith has enrolled 15 people; Axis has only just launched.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a real limit to the number of people who can
afford this kind of service and would be willing to pay for it," said
the AMA's Coble. "I mean, we'd all like to be sitting in the box
seats. But most of us will just as soon take a decent seat if we're
not paying for it. We're seeing the same game, and it's cheaper."</TE>

<LD>Scientists have come close, but there's still no cure for the common
cold. The problem isn't just killing the virus--though that's an
important step--it's also subduing the chemicals the body unleashes
in response to the invasion.</LD>
<LD>   Knowing this, University of Virginia researchers tried another
strategy. They combined the antiviral drug interferon with two drugs
(chlorphentramine and ibuprofen) that counteract chemicals such as
histamines and prostaglandins, which cause the sneezing, runny nose,
sore throat and lethargy that lay us low. In a study comparing that
regimen with one consisting of the two pills and placebo drops and
another consisting of placebo pills and drops, the new cold-fighting
combo stopped the virus and reduced the symptoms by as much as 73%.</LD>
<LD>   The first three days of a cold are when the symptoms are most
severe. But when volunteers started their treatment 24 hours after
cold viruses were placed in their nose, their rising symptom scores
flattened and then declined. Those in the placebo groups continued to
climb to a peak before dropping, though there was more improvement in
those taking chlorphentramine and ibuprofen than the placebo drops
and pills group.</LD>
<TE>   "Overall [the combination] reduced the total symptom burden by
about 50%, but it varied according to the symptom. Sneezing was
reduced by about 80%, mucous production dropped 71% and sore throat
was reduced 44%, compared to the groups taking the placebo [drops and
pills]," says Jack M. Gwaltney Jr., a professor of internal medicine
at UVA School of Medicine in Charlottesville. He says it's not known
if the drugs have an additive effect or if one enhances the
effectiveness of the other.</TE>

<TE>   Rethinking Normal Blood Counts in Older Women</TE>
<TE>   Elderly women may have mild anemia to blame for their frailty,
according to a new study that casts doubt on what is considered a
normal level of hemoglobin for those older than 70.</TE>
<TE>   Anemia is a problem for up to a third of older women, contributing
to fatigue, chest pain, shortness of breath and dizziness. But it may
be even more pervasive than experts believe. According to the
findings, women with a low-normal hemoglobin level (12 grams per
deciliter) had 1 1/2 times the risk of mobility problems as those
with levels in the mid-normal range (13 to 14 grams per deciliter).
Hemoglobin is a substance in red blood cells that transports oxygen.</TE>
<TE>   One or two grams per deciliter makes a big difference in
hemoglobin levels, but Paulo Chaves, assistant professor of medicine
and epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, says
he was surprised that the corresponding difference in women's
physical function was so great.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first study to show that a hemoglobin level of 12
grams/deciliter may not be normal ... and that it is a modifiable
risk factor for physical disability," says Chaves, who is also an
assistant professor at Rio de Janeiro State University.</TE>
<TE>   Since red blood cells transport oxygen from the lungs to the
tissues, a diminished supply to the muscles can make it difficult for
the woman to keep up with the mobility tasks of daily life that
require exercise tolerance. Chaves says this leads to deconditioning
and disability.</TE>

<TE>   New Spinal Fusion Technique Uses Genetically Engineered Protein</TE>
<TE>   Surgery is usually the last resort for back pain. Now, after two
decades of research, the Food and Drug Administration has approved a
spinal fusion technique that uses a natural protein to stimulate bone
growth between vertebrae, welding them together and replacing the
degenerated disc.</TE>
<TE>   Since the protein can be mass-produced in the laboratory using
genetic engineering techniques, in many cases it may not be necessary
to retrieve bone from the patient's hip to fill the gap between the
vertebrae. The protein--called BMP-2, for bone morphoenetic
protein-2--is placed in a collagen-sponge that is inserted into a
tapered framework, or a cage, placed between the vertebrae. The
protein signals the person's own cells to begin forming bone.</TE>
<TE>   Because the technique, the Infuse Bone Graft, may not require bone
from a distant site, the pain, blood loss, operating time and the
risk of complications are reduced. And because about a million times
more BMP-2 can be placed between the vertebrae than is present in the
person's own bone, a successful fusion is more likely.</TE>
<TE>   A study comparing the two methods in nearly 300 patients found
that, at 24 months, fusion rates using Infuse alone were about 6%
higher than the traditional methods. There was greater than 50%
improvement in low-back pain relief in both groups.</TE>
<TE>   Drug Could Give Healthy Brains a Memory Boost</TE>
<TE>   A drug that's been used for years to help people with Alzheimer's
disease may be a memory booster for healthy people. Though larger
studies are needed before the drug, donepezil, might be prescribed to
help students taking finals or to improve a chess player's chances of
winning a match, researchers have found in a study of general
aviation pilots that their ability to retain complex training
instructions was significantly improved by a daily dose of the drug.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots are good guinea pigs for memory drugs because they use a
range of skills that tend to decline with age, and their ability to
perform can be objectively measured. They may also be among the first
takers, should the drug ever be used in healthy people. Now pilots
for commercial airlines must retire at age 60.</TE>
<TE>   In the Stanford University study, 18 pilots, whose average age was
52, were trained on a flight simulator to do difficult and unusual
tasks that required remembering and processing various types of
information and commands. After the initial training, half of the
pilots began taking donepezil. A month later, the pilots were put to
the test again.</TE>
<TE>   Overall the pilots who had taken the drug did just as well during
the second flights as during the training sessions, but those taking
the placebo did worse, especially in the emergency situations and
approaches to landings. These situations involve processing visual
information, such as data gleaned from scanning the instrument panel,
and making judgments based on the readings. Both involve the kind of
working memory that drugs like donepezil improve.</TE>

<HD>Routine Chemo for Breast Cancer Disputed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RECER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For post-menopausal women with estrogen-sensitive breast cancer,
chemotherapy may offer no benefit, and a five-year course after
surgery of tamoxifen, which blocks the hormone, may be the only
treatment needed, a study shows.</LD>
<LD>   The finding, appearing last week in the Journal of the National
Cancer Institute, could mean that some of the thousands of American
women diagnosed each year with breast cancer could avoid the
debilitating side effects of drugs that kill cancer cells and damage
other cells in the body.</LD>
<LD>   The study also found that for post-menopausal women whose breast
cancer was not affected by estrogen, chemotherapy followed by
tamoxifen offered the best hope of disease-free survival. Tamoxifen
works by blocking the action of estrogen, a hormone that can promote
the growth of cancer cells.</LD>
<TE>   "We're hoping this study will question the routine use of
chemotherapy in the ER-positive [estrogen-sensitive] group," said
Richard D. Gelber, a biostatistician at the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute in Boston and one of dozens of co-authors. "This is the
largest study ever concentrating on this population."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Andrew D. Seidman, a breast cancer specialist at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, said the study "will
reaffirm the way that many oncologists are now practicing" and should
help doctors base cancer therapies on the specific characteristics of
their patients.</TE>
<TE>   It shows that chemotherapy is appropriate for some women but not
others and that patients who need the therapy can be specifically
identified based on the estrogen sensitivity of their tumors and on
other factors, Seidman said.</TE>
<TE>   The study, compiled by researchers from nine countries, was
limited to breast cancer surgery patients who had completed menopause
and whose disease had not spread to the lymph nodes. About 43% of the
about 184,000 women in the United States diagnosed with breast cancer
each year fit this category.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers further divided the 1,669 patients in the study into
groups based on whether their cancers were affected or not affected
by estrogen.</TE>
<TE>   There were 382 in the study whose tumors were not affected by
estrogen, described in medical terms as being estrogen receptor
negative, or ER-negative. There were 1,217 who were ER-positive. For
the remaining 70 patients, the ER status was unknown.</TE>
<TE>   About half in each of these groups were treated with chemotherapy
followed by five years of tamoxifen. The other half of each group
received tamoxifen only.</TE>

<HD>Colorectal Cancer Screening a Must After 50</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All Americans over the age of 50 should be screened for colorectal
cancer, regardless of whether they are at high risk, according to new
federal recommendations that don't advocate any particular diagnostic
technique.</LD>
<LD>   People who have a family history or who suffer from diseases like
ulcerative colitis should be screened earlier for colorectal cancer,
the No. 2 cause of cancer death in this country (behind lung cancer)
and the fourth most common cancer.</LD>
<LD>   With the upgraded recommendations published in the July 16 Annals
of Internal Medicine, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found
"fair to good evidence" that an expanded array of screening methods
could reduce deaths from colorectal cancer. In 1996, the task force,
an independent panel that's part of the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality, recommended screening with an annual fecal
occult blood test, which looks for blood in the stool; or with
periodic sigmoidoscopy, which explores the lower half of the colon;
or with a combination of the two.</LD>
<TE>   With the new recommendations, the panel acknowledged the value of
two frequently performed screening procedures: colonoscopy, which
uses a flexible, lighted viewing instrument to examine the entire
colon and which doctors consider the gold standard for detecting
cancer and precancerous polyps; and barium enema, which uses X-rays
and dye to detect abnormalities. The panel said so-called virtual
colonoscopy using a CT scan hasn't been studied enough to show
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "Initial costs of colonoscopy are higher than the costs of other
tests," the panel wrote. "Estimates of cost-effectiveness, however,
suggest that, from a societal perspective, compared with no
screening, all methods of colorectal cancer screening are likely to
be as cost-effective as many other clinical preventive services--less
than $30,000 per additional year of life gained."</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, in my opinion, colonoscopy is the way to go," said Dr.
Donald David, director of gastroenterology at City of Hope Cancer
Center in Duarte, who noted that Medicare now pays for colonoscopies
every 10 years in those seniors with average risk and every two to
five years in those with elevated risk. David said the
recommendations tell Americans "any colon cancer screening would be
better than doing nothing. The bottom line is less than half of
Americans age 50 are being screened."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For some people, it's hard enough to eat properly when healthy. With
illness, they may lose the desire or ability to eat anything at all.</LD>
<LD>   But getting adequate nutrition during any prolonged illness, such
as AIDS or cancer, will obviously improve your chances of recovery
and help you fight off infection. The following tips will help you
maintain good nutrition while sick, even if you're suffering from a
relatively simple ailment, such as the flu, a sore throat or reaction
to a medication.</LD>
<LD>   If you have mouth sores or pain:</LD>
<TE>   * Eat foods at room temperature, not when they are very hot or
very cold.</TE>
<TE>   * Choose foods and beverages that are mild and nonirritating, such
as apple juice instead of orange juice or other acidic juices.</TE>
<TE>   * Limit spices and salt.</TE>
<TE>   * Dunk toast, crackers and cookies in a liquid, such as milk or
soup, to soften them.</TE>
<TE>   * Try eating soft foods, such as pudding, eggs, soft cheeses or
noodles.</TE>
<TE>   * If you have trouble getting enough calories, try a nutritionally
balanced liquid formula for a while.</TE>
<TE>   If you have difficulty swallowing:</TE>
<TE>   * Try single-texture foods such as mashed potatoes and oatmeal,
instead of mixed textures such as stews.</TE>
<TE>   * Avoid single-particle foods such as nuts, corn and rice that can
get stuck in your throat.</TE>
<TE>   * Avoid sticky foods (such as peanut butter), which can be hard to
swallow, and slippery foods (such as macaroni, gelatin, luncheon
meat), which can slide down too fast and cause you to choke.</TE>
<TE>   * Try drinking with a straw.</TE>
<TE>   * Try tilting your head back or moving it forward to make
swallowing easier.</TE>
<TE>   If your sense of taste seems dull or suddenly different:</TE>
<TE>   * Try a variety of flavors and textures to make your food more
enjoyable.</TE>
<TE>   * Choose foods that smell good to you.</TE>
<TE>   * Eat acidic foods to help thin out your saliva and make it easier
for you to chew.</TE>
<TE>   * Experiment with new herbs and spices.</TE>
<TE>   * Marinate foods, or add chopped onions, garlic, bacon bits or
cheese to add more flavor.</TE>
<TE>   * When your mouth is dry, try chewing ice chips, hard candy or
gum.</TE>
<TE>   If you have diarrhea:</TE>
<TE>   * Drink plenty of liquids, including water, diluted fruit juices
and flavored drink mixes.</TE>
<TE>   * Avoid caffeinated beverages, which act as diuretics.</TE>
<TE>   * Eat salty foods; they promote water retention.</TE>
<TE>   * Avoid foods, such as milk, that contain lactose.</TE>
<TE>   * Eat bananas, mangoes and diluted orange and nectar juices to
replace minerals you may have lost.</TE>
<TE>   * Avoid foods that are high in fat.</TE>
<TE>   * Eat low-fiber foods, such as white rice, white bread and cooked
fruits and vegetables without the skin.</TE>
<TE>   * If the diarrhea persists too long, be sure to contact your
doctor.</TE>
<TE>   If you have lost your appetite or just aren't interested in food:</TE>
<TE>   * Try eating in a pleasant, relaxing atmosphere; have a friend
join you.</TE>
<TE>   * Eat several small meals a day, and avoid high-calorie,
low-nutrient foods, such as candy.</TE>
<TE>   * Eat foods with only faint odors, and serve them at cool
temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   * Drink an instant breakfast shake or liquid formula between meals
to boost calories.</TE>
<TE>   * If you don't feel like eating meat, try tofu, beans, nuts, fish,
peanut butter or eggs.</TE>
<TE>   * Try adding grated cheese to sauces, vegetables and casseroles to
boost the protein level.</TE>
<TE>   * Keep ready-to-eat snacks on hand (cheese and peanut butter, ice
cream, canned fruit).</TE>
<TE>   If you are nauseated and vomiting:</TE>
<TE>   * Drink clear, cool beverages and soups; eat gelatin, particularly
between meals. Eat as slowly as possible.</TE>
<TE>   * Try ice cubes made from clear fruit juices.</TE>
<TE>   * Have small, frequent meals.</TE>
<TE>   * Choose low-fat, mildly flavored foods.</TE>
<TE>   * Eat salted foods, such as pretzels or crackers.</TE>
<TE>   * Try chilled foods, such as cottage cheese with fruit, tuna salad
or cold chicken.</TE>
<TE>   * Eat meals at least an hour before taking medication that is
known to cause nausea.</TE>
<TE>   * If the smell of cooking food bothers you, have somebody else do
it for you, and be sure the cooking area is well ventilated.</TE>
<TE>   Once you feel better and the symptoms have passed, work your way
back into a regular meal pattern.</TE>
<TE>   If your symptoms persist and you are unable to eat for more than a
few days, be sure to check in with your health-care provider.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When my mother's generation went to college, parents sent their sons
and daughters off knowing that strict dress codes, curfews and rules
of conduct were the order of the day. Universities operated under the
mandate of in loco parentis, "in place of a parent, with a parent's
duties and responsibilities."</LD>
<LD>   My generation, the baby boomers, triggered a radical change in the
relationship between students and university administrators. Co-ed
dorms became the norm, and college became the gateway to adulthood,
independence and freedom.</LD>
<LD>   Today, as the boomers' children set off for college, whispers of
in loco parentis again are being heard. Parents of this generation
have, for a multitude of reasons, been more involved in their
children's lives on a daily basis than parents in the past. This
involvement is changing relationships between families and
universities once again.</LD>
<TE>   Efforts to preserve students' independence can lead to parental
anger and legal action if something happens to a legally adult
student, with parents feeling that a college reneged on its unstated
"parental responsibilities." And, even if they may not have been
equipped to truly assist a troubled student or might even have
exacerbated his problems, many parents feel that they should be
notified by the college and involved in their adult children's
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, an 18-year-old student may not want Mom or Dad in the
picture.</TE>
<TE>   The issue becomes even more complex when patient privacy is at
stake. Prohibited by law from releasing medical information without
patient permission, a doctor faces an ethical dilemma when
potentially helpful family involvement is declined by a patient.
Notifying a parent about an illness of an adult child could lead to
disciplinary action or loss of license. Not involving a family,
however, may deny a troubled patient a critical resource for his or
her recovery ... and the result could be tragic.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors like me, who work on a daily basis with young college
students, are often faced with a difficult choice.</TE>
<TE>   "Penny" was an A student. Her intelligence, determination and
diligence had led to her acceptance and success at a top university.
Twenty years old, energetic and friendly, with just a hint of
shyness, she was well-liked by classmates, professors, roommates and
friends--roommates and friends who urged her to visit the
university's student health service.</TE>
<TE>   Expecting a routine physical, I wasn't surprised when all the
answers to my medical history questions came back normal. It was only
when I saw Penny in the exam room, her baggy sweatshirt and slacks
replaced by a thin paper gown that I realized why her friends had
been so concerned. Penny's bones prominently outlined her emaciated
body, her anorexia nervosa no longer hidden by her outfits.</TE>
<TE>   Patients with anorexia may in some cases get better with
medication and outpatient psychotherapy, but those with severe
illness generally need hospitalization in a specialized treatment
program. Getting severely ill patients to take that step is often
difficult. Some may be ashamed and unwilling to admit to their need
for care and treatment; others may be in denial, convinced they are
fine or even "fat."</TE>
<TE>   My medical evaluation showed that Penny's condition was serious
and that hospitalization was needed to prevent serious or fatal
complications. But, for Penny, hospitalization meant she'd have to
interrupt her studies, temporarily leave school and, worst of all,
involve her family, whose insurance would be needed to cover the
costs of her inpatient stay. Penny listened politely as I advised her
that without inpatient treatment, she risked getting worse or dying,
but she refused to consider going to the hospital or notifying her
parents of her condition. And Penny was over 18.</TE>
<TE>   Privacy laws ensuring patient-doctor confidentiality do allow for
exceptions when a patient is in danger of harming himself or others.
A patient who threatens suicide can be hospitalized against his will
for up to 72 hours in a psychiatric unit, allowing for necessary
treatment to prevent death. But, barring imminent patient suicide or
homicide, a doctor cannot release a patient's medical information
without his or her permission. Penny, who was articulate, lucid,
successful and, aside from her eating disorder, highly functional,
had the right to refuse my recommendations--and, legally, my hands
were tied. I couldn't contact her family and let them know that they
might be able to help Penny get better. As an adult, Penny could
choose to ignore my recommendations, leave my office and never
return. Would I run across Penny's name again on the honor roll or on
the critical list?</TE>
<TE>   Even though I believed Penny would benefit most from
hospitalization, my only choice at the time was to convince Penny to
consider initial outpatient treatment. With her consent, I arranged
for her to begin outpatient psychiatric and nutritional therapy at
school, and asked her to return to my office regularly, hoping that
with time she would become more open to discussing her anorexia with
her parents and enter the recommended inpatient program. Fortunately,
after a few weeks of counseling, Penny became more receptive to a
mediated communication with her family--she invited her parents to
meet with us, discuss her illness, and help her begin more intensive
steps to recovery.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome could have been different. Like many other adult
students at risk of anorexia, bulimia, alcohol abuse, drug addiction,
depression or other conditions, Penny might have refused further
care. Her anorexia might have continued to worsen, and her parents
might have had a harsher reality to face than Penny's anorexia--like
her death. Penny was fortunate that she made the decision to move
forward with the treatment she needed and involve her family. And, as
her physician, so was I.</TE>

<HD>Trans-Fatty Acid, Carcinogens: Want That With Fries?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA MARSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>French fries are one of America's favorite fast foods, and it's easy
to see why. When they're made correctly--flash fried to perfection,
not too crunchy, not too soggy, with a dash of salt and a dollop of
ketchup on the side--they're sheer heaven.</LD>
<LD>   Each year, in fact, the typical American consumes more than 57
pounds of frozen  potatoes (almost all of which are French fries),
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture; 90% of those fries
are bought at fast-food restaurants. This translates to, on average,
about four servings of fries a week. At 220 calories and 9 grams of
fat per 2 1/2-ounce serving, which is about the size of a computer
mouse, they can hardly be classified as a health food.</LD>
<LD>   Most people, of course, realize that something this sublimely
delicious can't be very nutritious. We've known for years that
soaking potatoes in hot oil can spike levels of artery-clogging
cholesterol--and all that salt isn't healthy either, especially for
those with high blood pressure. Now comes evidence that fries are
loaded with a chemical suspected of causing cancer--and the
increasing understanding of how calorie-laden carbs can pile on more
pounds, making people more prone to diabetes, high blood pressure and
heart disease.</LD>
<TE>   Potatoes are basically a starch, which the body converts into
sugar. Since starch is a complex carbohydrate, it'll take the edge
off your hunger longer than, say, a candy bar, which gives you a fast
sugar rush, because it is digested more slowly. But if you're
overweight already, "French fries will contribute to sugar overload
and the wear and tear on your pancreas," says Joan Carter, a
dietitian at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, the lowly potato, which is classified as a vegetable, is
a good source of fiber and contains about 25% of our minimum daily
requirement of potassium. It also has trace amounts of calcium,
vitamin C and other minerals. "But it isn't much of a nutritional
powerhouse otherwise, especially when you remove the peel," Carter
says.</TE>
<TE>   The real problem, though, is that virtually all fast-food fries
are made using hydrogenated vegetable oils, which contain trans-fatty
acids. A report released earlier this month by the National Academy
of Science's Institute of Medicine indicated that trans fats promote
heart disease by boosting levels of LDL, or bad, cholesterol, and
lowering HDL, or good, cholesterol. They concluded that the only safe
intake of trans fats was "zero"--which is considerably less than the
3.8 grams of trans fats contained in 3.5 ounce serving of French
fries.</TE>
<TE>   And in women, the risk of Type 2 diabetes rises by 39% when
caloric intake of trans-fatty acids swells by only 2%, according to a
2001 Harvard study. "Anything that contains hydrogenated fat is
really bad news," says Randi Konikoff, a dietitian at Tufts
University Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Though French fries satisfy our cravings for fat and salt--and
fast-food portions are getting bigger, so you feel like you're
getting a lot of bang for your buck--they're no bargain,
calorie-wise. A super-sized portion of fries, which is almost triple
the normal serving, contains 610 calories and 29 grams of fat, which
is about a third of the recommended daily intake of calories and fat
for an average adult female. "Serving sizes can be deceptive, so you
end up consuming many more calories than you realize," says Bettye
Nowlin, a dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Assn.
in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   If all this isn't bad enough, this past April, Swedish researchers
announced that cooking starchy foods such as potato chips and French
fries at high temperatures triggers the formation of acrylamide, a
suspected human carcinogen that causes cancer in animals. More recent
tests by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington,
D.C.-based consumer group, revealed that a small order of McDonald's
French fries contained 250 times the levels of acrylamide permitted
in an 8-ounce glass of water by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency. "We've estimated that acrylamides probably cause several
thousand cancers a year," says Michael F. Jacobson, executive
director of the CSPI.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the link between acrylamides and human cancers is unproved.
"Until we have more data, people shouldn't make major lifestyle
changes because of the acrylamide issue," says Dr. Dennis Bier,
director of the Children's Nutrition Research Center at Baylor
College of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, moderation is key. There's nothing inherently
wrong with French fries, Carter says. "But they should be an
occasional treat, not a dietary staple."</TE>

<HD>Drug Duo Beneficial After Heart Attacks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Combining aspirin with coumarin after a heart attack appears to work
better than either medicine taken alone in preventing future cardiac
troubles, according to two studies published last week.</LD>
<LD>   In Europe, it's common practice to give heart patients both drugs,
said Dr. Freek W.A. Verheugt, director of cardiology at the
Heartcenter of University Medical Center in the Netherlands.</LD>
<LD>   Many U.S. doctors prefer one or the other because the risk of
bleeding increases when aspirin and coumarin (trade name Coumadin)
are taken together. Verheugt was a researcher in both studies.</LD>
<TE>   However, the studies showed a clear benefit to taking both drugs
without an excessive risk of bleeding.</TE>
<TE>   In a study of 308 heart attack patients, the chance of arteries
reclosing was reduced by 45% in patients who received both drugs
compared with patients who took only aspirin. Recurrent heart attacks
often happen because the arteries re-occlude. That study was
published in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In the other study--of 999 people who had had a heart
attack--patients taking coumarin alone or coumarin and aspirin
together were less likely to have a heart attack or stroke compared
with people on aspirin alone.</TE>
<TE>   That study was published in the Lancet.</TE>

<HD>Don't Be So Fast to Knock Knee Surgery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a recent study found that a popular knee operation was only as
good as a placebo for arthritis, some sufferers misconstrued the
results, assuming that no surgery would help them.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors are now trying to reassure people this isn't the case.</LD>
<LD>   The research, published two weeks ago in the New England Journal
of Medicine, found that arthroscopic knee surgery, in which a surgeon
inserts small instruments into the knee to explore the damage and
make repairs, provided only mild relief at most for arthritis
sufferers. Patients undergoing the surgery, the study said, had the
same degree of pain relief as those who had a simulated procedure, in
which tiny incisions were made and nothing more was done. Two years
later, about 35% of study subjects thought they had improved; 65%
either felt worse or stayed the same.</LD>
<TE>   "Patients that have arthritis read this as saying any knee surgery
for arthritis doesn't work," said Dr. Larry Dorr, director of the
Arthritis Institute at Centinela Hospital in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Arthroscopy remains a good operation for those who have suffered
knee trauma and acute injury, such as an athlete with torn cartilage
or a weekend athlete who tears a meniscus or ligament, he said.</TE>
<TE>   For those with painful, stiff, arthritic knees who can't get
relief any other way, there are procedures to help.</TE>
<TE>   "Total knee replacement is a highly successful operation and it's
shown to be one of the most effective treatments in terms of
returning people to productivity." Although knee replacements are
painful and rehabilitation can take up to a year, he said, "as with
most things in life, God gives you something when he takes something
away. They last better" than less invasive operations.</TE>
<TE>   Many doctors began offering the simpler arthroscopy, Dorr said,
because patients were reluctant to endure the pain, cost and
prolonged recuperation of knee replacement. But, he said, "there was
no one overlooking it and saying, 'This isn't working and we should
stop.' "</TE>
<TE>   With arthritis, the procedure typically involves debridement, the
sanding down of rough or damaged cartilage lining the knee, and
lavage, which flushes cartilage fragments from lubricating joint
fluid.</TE>
<TE>   Up until the recent study, there hadn't been scientific
comparisons of arthritis patients who underwent the surgery with
those who got a dummy procedure. Two years after the procedures,
about 35% of all the subjects thought they had improved; 65% felt
worse or stayed the same. However, the improvements were generally in
perceived pain, not in any objective measure of whether they could
function better, said Dr. Nelda P. Wray, the study's senior
scientist.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 650,000 annual arthroscopies, orthopedic surgeons report
doing 35% to 50% of them for the wear-and-tear of arthritis, Wray
said. With 250,000 to 300,000 such procedures performed for arthritis
each year at a cost of $5,000 each, more than $1 billion is being
spent only to get a placebo effect, said Wray, a researcher and
internist at the Houston VA Medical Center and Baylor College of
Medicine in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "We probably should be taking all the time and resources and money
that we use to do this and be applying them in better, more effective
ways," said Dr. Bruce Moseley, the Baylor orthopedic surgeon who
performed the real and simulated surgeries for the study.</TE>
<TE>   He and other orthopedic surgeons said patients have several
options:</TE>
<TE>   Nonsurgical management: Patients adapt their movements to what
their knees will allow, while maintaining a healthy weight to
alleviate extra stress on the joint. They can use pain relievers,
such as acetominophen, or anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen, the
prescription COX-2 inhibitors like Celebrex and Vioxx, and cortisone
injections.</TE>
<TE>   Heat before activity and ice afterward can reduce pain and
swelling. Physical therapy and massage can help. Exercise can
strengthen the muscles around the joint, particularly the quadriceps
at the front of the thigh and the hamstrings at the back of the
thigh. The stronger the muscles, the more they can absorb the load
placed on the joint.</TE>
<TE>   Osteotomy: Popular before the advent of arthroscopies, it's
performed in a hospital on younger patients who want to reduce pain
while preserving their knee joints. Because most people with
arthritic knees become somewhat bow-legged or knock-kneed, doctors
cut into either the leg bone, called the tibia, or thigh bone, called
the femur, to realign the leg and knee and redistribute the load on
the joint. Patients may return to work in three months; complete
recuperation can take up to a year. About 4,000 are performed
annually.</TE>
<TE>   Knee replacement: The more common of two types is total knee
replacement, in which surgeons replace worn or missing cartilage in
all three knee compartments with a new lining consisting of metal on
one side and plastic on the other. Recuperation can take six to 12
months.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors performed 299,000 total knee replacements in 2000,
according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. A 1998
study in the British edition of the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery
found that after 10 years, 90% of these procedures are successful.
When only a single knee compartment is affected, doctors may perform
a unicompartmental knee replacement. Recuperation can take three to
six months. About 30,000 are done annually.</TE>
<TE>   Knee fusion: Also called arthrodesis, this rarely performed
operation is sometimes recommended when a knee replacement may fail.
It fuses the femur bone to the tibial bone, resulting in a completely
stiff knee.</TE>
<TE>   Discosupplementation: A relatively new therapy, involving
injections of lubricant to replace knee fluid that has become less
slippery because of arthritis. Although the injected hyaluronic acid
eventually breaks down, some patients report years of relief, Moseley
said.</TE>
<TE>   Unispacer: The most recently developed knee procedure, it involves
making a single incision and sliding a metal disk between the bones
of the leg. Although FDA-approved, the procedure has been performed
900 times to date by the 350 orthopedic surgeons who have undergone
training by the manufacturer. Said Dorr: "It may be the next easy
solution for arthritis in the knee, like arthroscopy was, but there's
no good data yet that say it's going to work."</TE>
<TE>   Looking ahead, Moseley said several treatments for a pre-arthritic
condition called chondromalacia may turn out to be appropriate for
osteoarthritis of the knee.</TE>
<TE>   These include transplanting cartilage from one area of the knee to
another, or in more complicated cases, harvesting a small amount of
cartilage, sending it to a lab where it can be grown, and then
re-implanting it into the knee.</TE>

<LD>OVERVIEW: Many of us eat a beige and white diet heavy on potatoes,
rice and flour. But Heber, director of the UCLA Center for Human
Nutrition, and Bowerman, a UCLA dietitian, say we could all be
healthier by following this simple rule: Eat foods from all the
colors of the rainbow.</LD>
<LD>   WHAT WORKS: This is a multipurpose book. Part I focuses on how to
eat better, providing menus, recipes, tips and explanations (for
example, the red-purple group, which includes berries, contains
powerful antioxidants that may inhibit clotting of blood in the
heart).</LD>
<LD>   Part II focuses on theory and education, such as explaining how
DNA damage leads to disease. Part III explains the biochemistry of
eating and getting fat, how eating has changed over the ages, and how
economics and politics drive what gets to our dinner tables.</LD>

<LD>Question: I've been lifting weights for many years, but recently I've
noticed that my shoulders get tight when I lift. Any idea what I
might be doing wrong?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: This type of pain could indicate that you're clenching
your fists or straining your neck when you lift the weight. Try
leaving your hands slightly open and relaxed, and consciously relax
the muscles in your neck and shoulders during each repetition. I'd
also suggest you stretch these muscles between sets and after you
work out. The stretching goes a long way to help increase
flexibility, relieve the tension in muscles and help prevent
injuries. If this pain persists, of course, have a doctor check it
out.</LD>

<HD>Rules, Not Emotional Abuse</HD>
<DH>Planned responses to misbehavior help keep discipline
appropriate and feelings spared</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN FIELDING and VALERIE ULENE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After warning her child to be careful with a glass of milk, a mother
screams at him and calls him an idiot when he spills it on the
kitchen floor. After asking his 7-year-old twin girls to quiet down
at bedtime, an angry father threatens to lock them in the garage for
the night when they continue to spat. After reviewing a teenager's
report card, her parents refuse to talk to her for days because she
got a C in math.</LD>
<LD>   Although these types of emotionally abusive behaviors leave no
physical scars on children, they can--if they are recurrent--be
damaging to both their physical and emotional health. Children who
experience this type of abuse regularly are at risk of growth delays,
even when provided with adequate nutrition; are more likely to suffer
depression, anxiety and low self-esteem; and are more prone to
aggressive behavior. The effects of emotional abuse can extend into
adulthood; several studies have found that men and women who were
emotionally abused as children report more physical problems than
those who were not.</LD>
<LD>   Because of the lack of physical evidence, many--if not most--cases
of emotional abuse go unrecognized. And, although illegal, they are
rarely prosecuted because they are usually difficult to prove.</LD>
<TE>   Sometimes, the boundary between discipline and abuse is not clear.
But child-abuse experts say parents (or other adults) cross the line
when they repeatedly act or threaten to act in a way that makes a
child feel worthless, flawed, unloved or endangered (for example,
threatening to abandon a child or to hurt the child physically--even
if they have no intention of carrying out the act).</TE>
<TE>   Other examples of emotional abuse include calling children names
or humiliating them in public, and isolating them with unreasonable
limitations. Simply failing to express caring for a child can also
constitute emotional abuse.</TE>
<TE>   So, how do you discipline a child without becoming abusive? The
first step is to think about the issue of discipline ahead of time,
planning how you will respond the next time your child misbehaves.
That makes it more likely that the discipline will be appropriate and
reduces the risk that anger will cause you to lose control and
respond excessively. Your child should also know what to expect ahead
of time. Tell the child which behaviors are troublesome and what will
happen if misbehavior recurs. Explain, also, why the behavior is
wrong, so your child knows how to act appropriately.</TE>
<TE>   As you plan your responses, the American Academy of Pediatrics
recommends, keep these elements of effective discipline in mind:
Misbehavior should result in negative consequences (to discourage a
repeat performance), and desirable behavior should be rewarded or
encouraged.</TE>
<TE>   A popular technique for discouraging undesirable
behavior--especially with younger children--is called "timeouts."
During a timeout, children are required to stay in their room or sit
quietly by themselves; interaction with others is not allowed.
Studies have shown that timeouts are effective when used correctly
and consistently, increasing compliance with parental expectations by
as much as 80%. Timeouts should not be too long (many experts suggest
about one minute for each year of the child's age); frequent,
prolonged timeouts could be construed as parental rejection by the
child.</TE>
<TE>   With older children, revoking privileges can help reduce
unacceptable behavior. A child who refuses to do homework, for
example, might lose the opportunity to watch television; a teenager
who comes home past curfew could be denied access to the car.
Revocation of privileges should not go to extremes. "Grounding"
teenagers for a weekend may be appropriate; prohibiting all contact
with friends could be counterproductive--even harmful to the child.</TE>
<TE>   The American Academy of Pediatrics also recommends against trying
to change too many behaviors at once. They advise parents to focus on
behaviors that create serious problems, especially those that place
the child or others in danger--a toddler who bites, or a teenager who
drives drunk. Attention should also be given to behaviors that are
out of line with what can reasonably be expected of the child, such
as a fourth-grader's constant disruption of a classroom.</TE>
<TE>   Effective discipline rewards desirable behaviors, especially if
they are chosen as alternatives to misbehavior. Some parents resist
doing this because it feels like they are bribing their children.
("Why reward a child for behaving the way they ought to in the first
place?" they ask.) What these parents fail to recognize is that most
desirable behavior is learned--not innate. Although behaviors such as
sharing, taking turns and good manners are second nature to most
adults, children must be taught these things, and rewards are great
motivators. Rewards do not need to be large or expensive. However,
they must be meaningful to the child. Special time with a parent is a
reward; even a few simple words of praise can work wonders.</TE>
<TE>   The stronger the relationship between parent and child, the more
likely it is that discipline will succeed. Children need warmth,
affection, time and attention from parents. When they get these
things, they feel loved and important, and are much more likely to
respond to discipline.</TE>
<TE>   Even the best-prepared and most well-intentioned parents won't get
discipline right every time. Parents must recognize this fact and,
when they feel they've made a mistake, should remember to apologize
to children. A simple explanation and apology can make everyone feel
better. It also sets a great example of desirable behavior for the
child to follow.</TE>

<HD>Pregnancy 'Bible' Has a New Look and Updated Advice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER HUGET</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One thing you can surely expect if you're expecting: Somewhere along
the line, you will buy, borrow or be given a copy of "What to Expect
When You're Expecting." The pregnancy bible's rebirth in an expanded,
updated third edition, which recently hit the shelves, makes that
outcome even likelier.</LD>
<LD>   The most popular of all pregnancy guidebooks, "What to Expect" has
sold more than 10 million copies in the United States since its
publication in 1984 and has spent more than 80 weeks on the New York
Times bestseller list; according to a poll conducted by USA Today,
it's used by 93% of women who consult a guidebook during pregnancy.</LD>
<LD>   The babies who were mere blips on the ultrasound when the book
first came out are now old enough to think about using the book
themselves. A glance at the new cover, though, signals that this
isn't your mother's "What to Expect." The now-iconic image of a
frumpy mom-to-be, a sourpuss in flour-sack dress and permed hair, has
been replaced by, well, another mousy gal.</LD>
<TE>   But this one's wearing a sweater set and slacks, career-girl hair
and the faintest hint of a smile. On the back cover, another sign of
change: A Q&amp;A sampler has dumped the once-topical query "Will the
X-ray I had before I knew I was pregnant hurt my baby?" in favor of
"Could talking on a cell phone have any effect on my baby?"</TE>
<TE>   While the first "What to Expect" was a concise affair, with plenty
of room for notes in the margins, the 2002 edition can barely shut up
after 479 densely packed pages. Which prompts the question: How much
can things have changed in 18 years?</TE>
<TE>   The short answer is--plenty. For example, the role of folic acid
in preventing birth defects such as spina bifida wasn't well known in
1984, so the vitamin was barely mentioned; now its importance is
hammered home in several places in the book.</TE>
<TE>   And while the first edition pays little or no attention to
pregnant working women, expectant dads, HMOs and alternative medical
treatments such as acupuncture, hypnosis and biofeedback, the new
book acknowledges their expanded places in the new health-care
universe.</TE>
<TE>   But before we take a closer look at how pregnancy care has
changed, a little history:</TE>
<TE>   The book was the brainchild of California resident Heidi Murkoff,
who discovered, while pregnant in 1983 with her first child, that
existing guidebooks lacked the fear-allaying information she craved.
Working with her mother, the late Arlene Eisenberg (a medical
writer), and her sister, Sandee Eisenberg Hathaway (a registered
nurse), Murkoff set out to create an easy-to-read, reassuring
resource for the modern mom-to-be.</TE>
<TE>   The first edition established the twin trademarks of the "Expect"
franchise: a question-and-answer format and month-by-month coverage
of the events of pregnancy. A new edition in 1991 incorporated many
piecemeal changes. For the newest version, Murkoff has revised the
old material wholesale and added the space to flesh out things she
only could briefly mention before.</TE>
<TE>   Some examples of what has changed in the way of medical practice
between the first "What to Expect" and the new edition:</TE>
<TE>   * Weight gain. Pregnant women in the '80s were told to gain
between 20 and 30 pounds; for the 21st-century woman, the recommended
spread is 25 to 35 pounds. (The slight shift recognizes that too
little weight can produce undersize babies, with greater health
risks.)</TE>
<TE>   * Episiotomies. According to the 1984 "Expect," episiotomies were
performed in as many as 90% of first births, and pre-delivery enemas
and pubic-hair shearing were common. Episiotomies are no longer
recommended, and the other procedures are nearly unheard of because
they don't prevent complications, as once thought, and could even
create complications of their own.</TE>
<TE>   * Doulas and birthing plans. Readers seeking information about a
doula (a woman trained as a childbirth companion) were out of luck in
1984; now that more women use doulas, they get a page-long box.</TE>
<TE>   * Multiples. The updated edition has greatly expanded its coverage
of multiples (including enlightening diagrams showing different
strategies for breast-feeding twins). "Multiple births are
multiplying," says the book, partly because more women are having
babies later in life, when erratic ovulation and doctor-assisted
fertilization means a greater chance of twins, triplets and more.</TE>
<TE>   * Postpartum depression. One of the biggest, and most reflective,
changes is in this section. In 1984, "What to Expect" noted that
about 50% of new mothers suffered from some form of baby blues or
depression, covering the issue in 2 1/2 pages. In 2002--the same year
Texas mother Andrea Yates was convicted of having killed her children
while suffering from postpartum depression--the book cites the number
of new mothers suffering from the condition as between 60% and 80%,
and the section has doubled in size.</TE>
<TE>   * Diet. Here, the discussion gets juicy.</TE>
<TE>   Straddling the line between medical advice and cultural awareness,
the infamous Best-Odds Diet of the first "What to Expect" counseled
mothers--some say heavy-handedly--to Make Every Bite Count: "Before
you close your mouth on a forkful of food, consider, 'Is this the
best I can give my baby?' If it will benefit your baby, chew away. If
it'll benefit only your sweet tooth or appease your appetite, put
your fork down."</TE>
<TE>   The authors outlined a diet in which every mouthful was to be
chock-full of nutrients, in which white flour and sugar were
contraband, and whole-wheat pretzels or toasted sunflower seeds were
offered as alternatives to potato chips. Need a pick-me-up? How about
some farina-banana pudding (with apple juice concentrate and wheat
germ)? Or some carob brownies?</TE>
<TE>   The Best-Odds Diet became a flash point for many women who
resented what they took to be a patronizing tone. Murkoff professed
initial bafflement at the negative response. After all, she says,
that's the way she eats. Now, though, she says she's made an effort
to sound less "whole wheatier than thou."</TE>
<TE>   "As you raise fork to mouth," the new advice reads, "consider: 'Is
this a bite that will benefit my baby?' If it is, chew away. If it
isn't, see if you can't find a bite more worthy. Though most bites
should count for good nutrition, some can--and should--count for pure
pleasure."</TE>
<TE>   How does the book play in today's medical community? Unevenly.</TE>
<TE>   Asking the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, or ACOG,
to comment on it is like asking a newborn's mother to crow over
someone else's baby. ACOG, after all, has published a doctor-written
pregnancy guide ("Planning Your Pregnancy and Birth," 2000). Charles
Lockwood, chair of ACOG's committee on obstetric practice, allows
that "a lot of my patients read ('What to Expect'), and ... for the
most part they get good, reasonable information."</TE>

<HD>Tracking Hunger Is Key to Healthy Weight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLY SQUIRES</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When you eat today, will it be out of hunger? Or will you reach for
food simply out of habit, stress, boredom, fatigue, feeling down or
because there just happens to be something tempting within sight?</LD>
<LD>   The ability to recognize true hunger--and to know when you're
eating for other reasons--is an important step toward achieving a
healthy weight.</LD>
<LD>   With food plentiful, cheap and accessible 24/7, it's easy to
overlook eating for hunger's sake and drift into nonstop, mindless
consumption. "A lot of us simply aren't paying attention," says
Barbara Rolls, professor of nutrition and biobehavior at Pennsylvania
State University. "And some of us simply ignore the signals" of
feeling full, she says.</LD>
<TE>   Getting back in touch with hunger--and with its opposite,
satiety--is a smart strategy to help hold the line in the waistline
wars. "It's a really good thing to ask yourself, 'Why am I eating
now?'" says Mark Friedman, associate director of the Monell Chemical
Senses Center in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   So what is hunger? Technically, "there is no independent
measurement for metabolic hunger," Friedman says. "Even measuring
blood sugar won't tell you that."</TE>
<TE>   But when Friedman studied healthy people who reported being
hungry, he found some common patterns. Leading indicators of hunger
were stomach growling and an achy stomach emptiness. Next most
commonly reported were headaches, dizziness, weakness, fatigue and
loss of concentration.</TE>
<TE>   So how do you know if that growling in your stomach is the real
thing? Here are some strategies that Rolls and her colleagues have
found helpful in reconnecting to the feelings of hunger and satiety.</TE>
<TE>   * Set a schedule for eating. No, you don't have to stick with it
forever. But by eating three regular meals, spaced at least three to
four hours apart for about 10 days, you'll start to find your
particular pattern of hunger and satiety. "Pay attention to how you
feel before and after the meal," Rolls advises. Note in a "hunger
journal" when you feel hungry again after a meal. See what patterns
of hunger and satiety you can detect.</TE>
<TE>   * Feeling a little hungry is a good thing. It signals that it may
be time for a meal or a healthful snack. Hunger should rise slightly
before eating and ought to decline after you've consumed a meal. If
you don't feel hungry at a mealtime, maybe it's not time to eat yet.
The trick is to space out eating so that you don't eat too soon or
feel too ravenous when you do eat.</TE>
<TE>   * Rate your hunger. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being "barely
hungry" and 10 being ready to eat anything in sight, where does your
hunger rank? Check before eating and pause throughout the meal to
take your hunger pulse.</TE>
<TE>   * Eat without distractions. If you're munching on chips while
driving, eating lunch at your desk or chowing down in front of the
TV, you're probably not tuning in to signals of fullness. Try eating
for a week without doing anything but consuming food at meals.</TE>

<LD>Tennis may have a lot more going for it than a brisk workout,
Wimbledon, and Venus and Serena Williams.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers in Baltimore have found another possible benefit for
the tennis set: a lower risk of heart disease. The findings come from
a study at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine that tracked the health
and physical activities of more than 1,000 medical students; some
were tracked for up to 48 years after graduation.</LD>
<LD>   Their findings: When compared with male athletes who participated
in team sports like football and basketball during college, tennis
players had a lower risk of heart disease later in life.</LD>
<TE>   The study, published last month in the American Journal of
Medicine, confirms something that health researchers have long
suspected: that young people who take up sports such as tennis or
swimming, which can be enjoyed throughout one's life, are more likely
to stay involved in those activities as they age.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers also found a link between one's tennis-playing
skills and later health benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The people who described themselves as quite proficient at tennis
had a 55% lower risk of heart disease later in life than those who
said they had no ability.</TE>
<TE>   Those who played tennis poorly had a 37% lower risk of
cardiovascular disease than those who had no skill.</TE>
<TE>   "Much of this protective effect was seen because tennis players
continued to play the sport well into middle age," says Dr. Michael
J. Klag, a professor of internal medicine at Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike tennis players, those who played team sports such as
basketball and football were far less likely to continue playing
those sports.</TE>
<TE>   When the researchers questioned the men (at an average age of 48)
about their activity years after graduation, 68% of them said they
worked up a sweat in some way at least once a week.</TE>
<TE>   The tennis players, though, were most likely to still be playing
their sport. About a third of the good tennis players had played
within the past week of the survey, and half had played within the
last year. Few, if any, of the team sport players were still at it.</TE>
<TE>   Good golfers, in contrast with those who played team sports, were
a little more likely to be active in their sport. About 20% of them
were still playing in middle age.</TE>
<TE>   However, golf doesn't have the same aerobic benefit as tennis, and
it was not associated with a lower risk of heart disease as the men
grew older.</TE>
<TE>   More than other popular sports, tennis seems to deliver a double
advantage: a good aerobic workout that is likely to be sustained in
middle age.</TE>
