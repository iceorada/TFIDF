<HD>Joy pervades lyrical account of nature's seasonal passages</HD>
<DH>The Rural Life: The Rural Life Verlyn Klinkenborg; Little,
Brown: 216 pp., $20</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Verlyn Klinkenborg looks at the Nativity a little differently than
most. "Fear is what the shepherds felt when the good news was
announced," he writes, and then he turns the moment on its head.</LD>
<LD>   "But in the eyes of their flock and in the eyes of the ox and ass
depicted in every Nativity, there's ... implacable mildness.... Their
repose is a sign of confidence, of safety, and it washes over the
person who gets to bring them their hay, which they accept, every
morning, as if every morning were Christmas."</LD>
<LD>   Such repose and steady confidence fill Klinkenborg's essays in
"The Rural Life," a collection of beautifully observed moments drawn
mostly from the seasons on his small farm in upstate New York and
arranged around the calendar year. In a voice reminiscent of E.B.
White -- another great translator of the rural life -- he paints a
picture of a fading world in colors that are solid and authentic. His
joy is evident throughout.</LD>
<TE>   An editorial writer for the New York Times, Klinkenborg writes
what he sees and feels and, in his reverie, provides continuity amid
often quite disparate subjects. "If deep cold made a sound," he
writes, "it would be the scissoring and gnashing of a skater's blades
against hard gray ice...." And later, "What I like is the visual
impairment snow brings with it, the way it obscures some things and
defines others, like the wind."</TE>
<TE>   With such lyricism woven throughout, it is not surprising to
encounter in these pages a love of Keats' odes, with autumn, for
instance, "fast asleep in a half-reap'd furrow." Yet beneath the
patina of language, Klinkenborg has set for himself a more difficult
task: a daily regimen of noting the world around us -- what is
striking, what is humble and what is merely mundane -- where the
"simultaneous expectation [is] that every word ... will live forever
and be blotted out instantly."</TE>
<TE>   It is the discipline of encountering the present -- that briefest
of periods between past and future -- that makes "The Rural Life"
unique. Klinkenborg takes us to a place where one can "count the
crows in the field every afternoon" and note that "from a distance
the woods in winter look monochromatic, gray with undertones of dull
red and olive, as if all the trees were a single species." It is a
place where you might record the passing observation that "[s]omehow
... it seems preferable to expire alone on the high prairie, as a
grasshopper will, than to die, as the ants do, in a hold among many
thousands of your kind" and then let it slip away.</TE>
<TE>   What strengthens his prose and gives texture to the images is his
willingness to question matters of birth, life and death. While
rejoicing in the "bleating of crickets and the hush of leaves" in
June, he still feels a sadness that permeates the passing of life in
fall and winter. This cyclic awareness presents itself in more subtle
observations: "A gardener anticipates the mortality of his vegetable
garden.... In autumn I stare at the demise of my spring plans and
realize that ... all those drawings and plottings come down to this,
a cornucopia of nettles and soon-to-be-frostbit tomatoes." Elsewhere
he describes "bleak" November, when "the leaves are gone, and the
trees seem frayed [and] the clouds have the texture of steel wool."</TE>
<TE>   The allusions to aging serve to breathe life into the images, so
that they are no longer meaningless snapshots but something richer:
the all-too-familiar reflections of our own transience. The withering
stem of a flower is mirrored in our own creasing skin, receding
hairlines and slumping postures. And yet, that is what is needed --
what is essential -- and Klinkenborg reminds us of this, gently but
with deathly certainty: "[In May] the field-crickets are already
ticking away the seconds of full summer.... Everyone reaches for
fullness in summer, but the fullness that most of us know best
belongs to the memory of childhood." Occasionally, with hints at
humor, he points it out theatrically: "After the sun burns out, some
5 billion years from now, [our] galaxy ... may collide with the
Andromeda Galaxy.... [It] is the kind of celestial happening that
belongs on everyone's worry list."</TE>
<TE>   As the modern-day drift from nature widens, it might be easy to
romanticize rural livelihoods.</TE>
<TE>   But rural existences are vanishing, and those who choose these
lifestyles often face harsh conditions that most would flee.</TE>
<TE>   Although Klinkenborg allows himself brief sermons on the
sterilization of "chain experiences" in America, "The Rural Life" is
without the preachy "angry environmentalist" that one might expect in
a collection of essays on nature. In the end, "The Rural Life" is
life stripped bare.</TE>
<TE>   What Klinkenborg sees is often decayed or dying, and what he feels
is often piercingly cold, especially when the wind-chill approaches
50 below. It is a picture of a life, both urgent and real, fearful
and calm, a picture that in the end is enough to make our stay in the
city -- cubicles, traffic jams and all -- perhaps more tolerable.</TE>

<HD>Second City getting serious about diversity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bennie M. Currie</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>CHICAGO -- For years, the Second City has helped funny people find
stardom, including Joan Rivers, George Wendt, John Belushi and Mike
Myers.</LD>
<LD>   Most have been white; the improvisational comedy troupe has been
short on actors of color.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Second City is on a mission to better reflect the cultural
diversity of Chicago, where the company has been operating from a
North Side theater since it was started in 1959 by a group of
improvisational performers that included filmmaker Mike Nichols.</LD>
<TE>   Plans are underway for a Second City training center on Chicago's
South Side.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to see more people in the African American community
doing this work," owner Andrew Alexander says. "We've been making the
effort for a while, but we wanted more consistency. We realized we
needed to be in the community on a more permanent basis."</TE>
<TE>   The new center would be in a once-thriving and mostly black area
known as Bronzeville. And it would be just a few blocks away from the
University of Chicago, where a group of politically active students
-- Nichols included -- formed a theater club in the late 1950s that
morphed into the Second City.</TE>
<TE>   The training center would teach the skills that give Second City
its edgy brand of satire, steeped in the arts of improvisation and
ensemble acting, and is driven by performers who write and present
their own material. It would be similar to Second City's other local
training center, in the mostly white Chicago suburb of Arlington
Heights, and its centers in Detroit, Toronto, Cleveland, Las Vegas,
New York and Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Only 15 black members have joined Second City Chicago since Bob
Curry in 1966, a time of political and social turbulence when the
company needed a black voice.</TE>
<TE>   "Blacks began to join in the '70s, but it was not until the '80s
that we took more aggressive efforts to become more inclusive,"
Alexander said.</TE>
<TE>   Second City Detroit, however, has been an incubator for black
performers, including Dionna Griffin, now a Second City producer in
Chicago, and actors Nyima Funk and Keegan-Michael Key.</TE>
<TE>   "Detroit is a prime example of what I'm talking about doing in
Bronzeville," Alexander said.</TE>
<TE>   Now in Chicago, Funk and Key take on an array of characters while
lampooning President Bush, the war on terrorism and other topics in
the Second City revue "Curious George Goes to War."</TE>
<TE>   The audience is usually mostly white, but Funk hopes that will
change as Second City finds more minority performers.</TE>
<TE>   The Bronzeville center will probably require about $1.4 million
for completion, Alexander said.</TE>

<HD>Leaves of splendor</HD>
<DH>The trees of Southern California and the stories they tell.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Curwen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chapter 1</LD>
<LD>   At 20,000 feet -- the altitude for most aerial photography -- Los
Angeles is a city of rooftops and parking lots. Sunlight and shadows
blur across a grid of streets. Look carefully, however, and trees
emerge like green cotton balls on a plywood sheet. They line roads,
shadow homes and pepper golf courses, parks and schools. Stand
beneath them on a summer day, and the air is cool. Walk beneath them
during a winter storm, and rainwater falls into pools and disappears
into the soil at their roots.</LD>
<LD>   Yet not until John Quigley took his place in early November in the
branches of an oak in Santa Clarita in an attempt to save the tree
from a road-widening project did we stop and think of Southern
California as a place of trees. Now we can't escape the thought. Far
from being a concrete jungle, the region brims with arboreal
splendor, and it doesn't take someone living in a tree to make it
apparent. When the U.S. Forest Service did a reconnaissance of the
trees of Los Angeles a couple of years ago, it determined that the
city's tree cover amounted to nearly 16%, the rest falling to
buildings, grass, soil and pavement. It is a proportion, according to
Greg McPherson, director of the study, comparable to Sacramento's and
Chicago's.</LD>
<TE>   "There's no question that trees are important to us. Look at them
carefully and they become a window upon people, culture and values,"
McPherson says. "They are a way to frame who we are, what we think
about nature and what we take for granted in our environment."</TE>
<TE>   Chapter 2</TE>
<TE>   They begin arriving in the early morning. They come with empty
laundry detergent boxes and pick their way among the fallen leaves, a
carpet of autumn gold. They are the Chinese herbalists, and their
quarry is the pungent seedpods of Ed Tessier's Ginkgo biloba, rumored
cure-all and palliative. Tessier's ginkgo, believed to have been
planted in 1927, is also a favored destination for quinceanera and
wedding photos. In the fall, the tree -- belonging to one of the
oldest species in the world (fossils of its leaves have been dated to
nearly 270 million years ago, well before the age of the dinosaurs)
-- is a beacon visible for at least four blocks in old town Pomona.
In sunlight, its leaves, turning from green to gold, seem to burnish
before your eyes.</TE>
<TE>   The tree gained attention courtesy of Donald R. Hodel. Eighteen
years ago, Hodel, a horticultural advisor for the UC Cooperative
Extension, drove 5,000 miles on an ambitious project to photograph
and record nearly 1,000 local trees for his 1988 book, "Exceptional
Trees of Los Angeles." The book is the bible of arboreal life in the
Southland, and Tessier's ginkgo is one of the 167 specimens that made
the final cut.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California is a remarkable place for trees, argues Hodel.
"We have perhaps the greatest diversity of trees of any urban city,"
he says. "It is our climate -- from frost-free zones on the coast to
arctic zones in some of the mountains -- and our enthusiasms that
have created a rich environment for trees."</TE>
<TE>   Enthusiasm or not, trees are easily taken for granted. Tessier
remembers the day he drove down the street and saw trimmers busy
pruning the tree. "Butchering was more like it," he says. " I saw
half the tree was standing and half of it was stacked on the lawn. It
was so upsetting to neighbors and residents that it triggered calls
for a tree preservation ordinance, which was just adopted two years
ago by the city of Pomona."</TE>
<TE>   So he bought the house and saved the tree.</TE>
<TE>   Chapter 3</TE>
<TE>   Trees have wrapped their roots into the Southern California psyche
in ways that we may not know, and although popular sentiment and
cinematic expression have placed the palm foremost in our
imaginations, it is really the citrus tree that put the region on the
map.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Murakami throttles back his leaf blower to a low idle. It is
nearly 7 a.m. and he has completed two hours of work. Gone are the
scraps of paper, the fallen leaves and grapefruit rinds that littered
Noguchi Plaza, a brick courtyard just off San Pedro Street in
downtown Los Angeles' Little Tokyo. Beneath the gaze of a plastic
owl, nearly hidden by pines on the street, stand a dozen
feather-leafed jacarandas, a cluster of red plum trees and a
grapefruit tree. A tuft of oily luminescent foliage, rising from a
dark striated trunk, burled and knotted from past trimmings, shades
an abundant crop of fruit, high overhead.</TE>
<TE>   Murakami, 72, grabs a branch trimmer from his Toyota pickup and
stands beneath the tree. He reaches up and cuts down two grapefruit.
The fruit is thin-skinned and tart. It's not often that you eat a
grapefruit from a 120-year-old tree, he says, lighting a cigarette.</TE>
<TE>   The tree is believed to have been planted by William Wolfskill in
the late 1800s. Wolfskill, a Kentucky-born trapper and trader,
created the city's first commercial grove, a 28-acre site close to
the center of Los Angeles, from seedlings he took from a citrus
orchard in San Gabriel. Whittled away as downtown grew, the grove
slowly disappeared, until one day 20 years ago the Southern
California Gardeners Federation was invited to save the sole survivor
of that era from a new development. "It was growing just over there,"
Murakami points to a five-story parking structure half a block away.</TE>
<TE>   Today it thrives in its transplanted location. On a weekday
afternoon, schoolchildren run around the plaza. They gather on the
steps beside the tree, and their teacher marches them out in single
file. Three homeless men descend on a trash container for remnants of
their lunch and recyclables.</TE>
<TE>   Chapter 4</TE>
<TE>   When naturalist Edward O. Wilson coined the word "biophilia" in
1979, he sought to describe humankind's innate connection to the
natural world. It is an awkward locution, somewhat clinical and
insufficient to explain how easily the world outside our windows can
get beneath our skin.</TE>
<TE>   Tears still come to the eyes of Dewitt Etheridge when he
thinks back on the last few years. Not only did he lose his wife, he
also was forced to cut down the tree that was once so important to
them. The Etheridges' tree in La Habra Heights was the original Hass
avocado, the genetic mother lode for the world's most popular variety
of the fruit.</TE>
<TE>   At its maturity, the tree was nearly 65 feet tall; its trunk 7
feet around. The numbers are hard to confirm: It is believed that
nearly 15 million trees were propagated and planted around the world
from this single one, which produced nearly 500 pounds of fruit a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Planted in 1926 along with a number of other seedlings by Rudolph
Hass, a mailman turned gentleman farmer, the tree nearly didn't make
it. The skin of its fruit was rather unsightly, leathery and rough,
and when it was time for Hass to thin the grove, a neighbor --
according to legend -- persuaded him to spare this oddball. Hass'
children believe it was an act of God, so loved is the fruit today
for its distinctive buttery, nutty flavor. In 1935, Hass agreed and
drew a patent on the tree. In 1975, the Etheridges became custodians.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, however, the old avocado grew ill. Some blame the
persea mite. After a leafless year, in spite of Etheridge's best
efforts, he cut the tree down. The date was Sept. 11, 2002. Now
Etheridge, 78, has the stump in his frontyard, a stack of newspaper
clippings citing the tree's august history and a few pictures taken
from that sorrowful day.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question trees have an emotional hold on us," says
Andy Lipkis, president of TreePeople, the Los Angeles environmental
group. "Yet we don't have the tools to talk about them. So many
things have left our current conversation that we don't realize that
trees are a part of our lives until they are gone."</TE>
<TE>   Chapter 5</TE>
<TE>   No one remembers who placed the small wooden sign with hand-carved
letters on the lemon-scented gum tree in South Pasadena, but who
needs memory when the legend is so rich?</TE>
<TE>   The Wynyate Estate is one of that city's more spectacular
properties. On a grassy knoll featuring views of the San Gabriel
Mountains, the Queen Anne-style home was built in 1887 by Donald M.
Graham, the first mayor of South Pasadena, and his wife, Margaret
Collier. Today the property is nearly obscured by pines, peppers and
eucalyptus trees. None is quite as famous as the lemon-scented gum,
believed to have been planted by John Muir, 1889.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that no one seems able to place Muir in Southern
California in 1889. There are times, especially when tracing the life
of an old tree, that the imagination is more powerful than memory. As
the story goes, the Grahams, who were riding a wave of personal
reinvention that was turning this quarter of Southern California into
a haven for artists and bohemians, had created something of a salon
at Wynyate. Muir was said to have been a frequent visitor, staying
once to plant the tree before heading off to the mountains with a
loaf of Boston brown bread and a bag of tea thrust into the pocket of
his Prince Albert coat.</TE>
<TE>   Today the gum tree is a shadow of its former self. All that
remains is a single willowy limb, stretching overhead. But the health
of the tree somehow pales next to the more urgent reality of this
particular property. If the state has its way, the extension of the
Long Beach Freeway will send its southbound breakdown lane less than
30 yards from the home's front door.</TE>
<TE>   Chapter 6</TE>
<TE>   Reading through "Exceptional Trees of Southern California," you
come to realize that the landmarks of Los Angeles are as much
horticultural as they are architectural. Visit the area's formal
gardens -- the Los Angeles County Arboretum in Arcadia, the
Huntington Botanical Gardens in San Marino, the Orcutt Ranch
Horticultural Center in West Hills or the Virginia Robinson Garden in
Beverly Hills, Descanso Gardens in La Canada Flintridge -- and you
will find yourself in the presence of well-tended trees. What's been
lost -- the Indian rubber tree in Whittier, for instance, nearly 100
years old and 70 feet tall, which the city razed to widen Whittier
Boulevard -- is as irreplaceable as, say, Irving Gill's Dodge House.
Trees on private property are the most vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   Gloria Zamudio climbs into the trunk of the Moreton Bay fig on the
grounds of Rancho Los Amigos in Downey and smiles like a little girl.
Its roots flare at her feet as broad as an infield, and its canopy of
green and gold rises above her like a hot-air balloon. The tree is
one of the largest in Southern California and is something of a
landmark. Zamudio, the contract administrator for landscaping at the
rehabilitation center, has a soft spot for this particular tree, even
if it no longer falls under her jurisdiction. Last year, in a
cost-cutting measure, the facility relinquished its south campus,
where the tree is situated, to the county. So when an enormous branch
broke off last spring, she was devastated.</TE>
<TE>   As the county Board of Supervisors debates closing Rancho Los
Amigos, Zamudio grows ever more nervous. "It is a running joke around
here," she says, "that if it takes one man in one tree to stop a
development, perhaps we should all climb into the trees around here
and save a few thousand lives."</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, a flight of sparrows circles in the top reaches of a bunya
bunya tree. Nearly 100 feet tall, this specimen is one of the more
notable trees in Southern California. Scraggly and narrow as a
pillar, it is both majestic and peculiar. Patients in wheelchairs
scatter on a basketball court, and an old man pedals a bicycle past a
stand of four pink cedar trees, native to the forests of Burma and
India.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day, Zamudio pulls a branch trimmer from her car. We
reach up into a white sapote, a Mexican apple tree, and knock two
apples to the ground. A native to the mountains of Mexico, the tree
is known as cochiztzapotl or "sleepy fruit" in Nahuatl. Its bark,
leaves and seeds contain a chemical that is not only curative but
also can induce a deep sleep. We slice the fruit. It tastes like
peach and banana.</TE>
<TE>   Chapter 7</TE>
<TE>   "It seems so basic," says Cheryl Kollin, director of the urban
forest center at the national conservation organization, American
Forests, "that trees provide tangible economic benefits to
communities whether controlling storm water runoff, minimizing air
pollution or cooling the city. We just need to change the mind-set,
that trees are assets not liabilities."</TE>
<TE>   Business is brisk at the Woodhill firewood lot in Irvine on a
Saturday afternoon. Monster pickups and modest sedans sink lower on
their springs as lengths of wood are heaved into their beds and
trunks. Stacks of split and curing logs -- mostly red eucalyptus and
almond -- tower above visitors like enormous cenotaphs. This is the
graveyard, the final resting ground of trees. Here -- if they don't
dissolve into a chipper for mulch -- trees wait for the crematorium
of a stranger's fireplace. Owner Tom Rogers is the undertaker, a man
not insensitive to the meaning of his job.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember once clearing oaks in the nearby foothills," he says.
"A developer wanted to put in a golf course and change the contour of
the land, and I'll never forget one tree in particular. It was bigger
than most, and when I looked at it, I thought about all the years it
had grown there. It didn't make too much sense to cut it down."</TE>

<HD>Our love of trees has primeval roots</HD>

<LD>Bob Sommer has studied people and trees for the last 16 years. A
professor of psychology at UC Davis, Sommer is by nature an
inquisitive man, and when the U.S. Forest Service approached him in
the mid 1980s to research the people's attitudes toward city trees,
he was sufficiently intrigued. "I originally thought of trees as
nothing more than street furniture, like lampposts and hydrants," he
said, "but when I asked about specific trees, I discovered that
people have very strong attitudes about them. They referred to them
as 'my tree' and 'our tree.' Or 'We moved to this block because of
the trees.' "</LD>
<LD>   As he delved deeper into the subject, he began to realize that the
usefulness and beauty of trees are insufficient explanations for such
obvious attachments to them. From lullabies ("rock-a-bye baby in the
tree top") to the fear of walking in woods after dark, to arboreal
allusions in politics and religion, trees are so rooted in our
psyches that Sommer began to wonder if there might be a biological
explanation.</LD>
<TE>   It was a question that opened up a cross-cultural study. "We
contacted people around the world," Sommer explained the work, "and
wherever we went, the acacia -- and oak-shaped trees -- were the
preferred trees. Tall pines were the least liked, even in place where
triangular shaped-trees were dominant, like Scandinavia. Everyone
thought that the most beautiful tree had a spreading shape."</TE>
<TE>   Sommer attributes this preference to the role trees once played
protecting early humans on the plains of Africa. "Simply put," he
explains, "the people who liked the right kind of trees -- like those
growing in savannas -- survived better than people who liked the
wrong kinds of trees, and over the millennia we grew conditioned to
prefer spreading trees."</TE>

<HD>Is Spielberg too big for small tales?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Manohla Dargis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Steven Spielberg ever decides to write an autobiography, he might
consider naming it after the title of his latest film, "Catch Me If
You Can." A frothy entertainment about a quick-change artist by the
most nimble quick-change artist in American movies, the film traces
the life and picaresque criminal times of a 1960s teenager who for a
few blissed-out years pretended to be an airline pilot, a
pediatrician and a lawyer. After going over to the dark side with
"Minority Report," Spielberg has returned to the sort of lost
paradise where he has always been most at ease as a storyteller,
never mind that these days even paradise can seem cramped for a
filmmaker of his ambitions.</LD>
<TE>   In 1964, Frank Abagnale (Leonardo DiCaprio) ran away from home to
join a circus of his own design. Torn up over the divorce of his
parents (Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye), the 16-year-old
hopped a train to New York City whereupon, after deducing that he
couldn't get along by legitimate means, he tried to cash a few bad
checks. Since bank tellers wouldn't fall for a con from someone who
looked like Dobie Gillis, Abagnale decided on another tack. Heeding
the adage that the suit makes the man, the teenager, whose premature
gray hair and thick build made him look a good 10 years older, donned
a Pan Am pilot's uniform that, along with a wallet stuffed with phony
identification, allowed him free range across the world.</TE>
<TE>   His path was ludicrously unencumbered. Always the fox, Abagnale
smooth-talked his way into Pan Am corporate headquarters where,
posing as a high-school reporter, he elicited information about pilot
credentials and protocol. Once outfitted, he paid for his new
lifestyle by soaking off Pan Am logos from airplane models and
applying the decals to checks that tellers and hotel clerks were all
too happy to cash.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when most of his peers were worrying about grades and
getting to first base, the teenager, who earned the tabloid-ready
nickname of the Skywayman, cut, forged and even printed one bad check
after another. A kid in a grown-up's candy store, he eventually
conned his way through $2.5 million in swank hotels, fast cars and
women before, just in time for adulthood, he was busted at age 21.</TE>
<TE>   As written by Jeff Nathanson, Abagnale's spree was defined by
despair over his father's failed business and his parents' divorce.
This is a brittle foundation on which to build a film -- much less
explain a life of crime -- but Walken, who's rarely called on to tap
into the vulnerability beneath his spooky otherworldliness, does his
part to put across this oedipal drama. A small-time businessman who
made himself bigger than life, Frank Sr. seduced his family with talk
of better, richer times that never materialized. When he dances his
wife across the family living room, the piercing look he shoots his
adoring son sums up the desperation of a man who can't stop the lies
for fear there will be nothing left if he does. The pathos of the
character was that he was right; the pathos of his son is that the
kid didn't know his father was running a con on his own family.</TE>
<TE>   Although he ran away, Abagnale never escaped his father or his
lies. According to the screenplay, Frank Jr. even found something of
a surrogate father in the FBI agent (Tom Hanks) who chased him across
the world. A lightweight heavy dressed in regulation suit and tie,
his doughy face wadded into a grimace, Hanks' G-Man looks like a
Blues Brother with no sense of fun, which makes him an ideal foil for
Abagnale's hi-jinks. Like Walken, Hanks gives the story emotional
heft and necessary ballast to DiCaprio. Having shed the weight he
carries in "Gangs of New York," DiCaprio easily persuades in the role
of a boy pretending to be a man and he slips through the beginning of
"Catch Me If You Can" like quicksilver. Where he and the film run
into trouble are the director and screenwriter's efforts to wring
deeper meaning out of Abagnale's exploits, which is when the
quicksilver turns to lead. Abagnale didn't bash any old ladies over
the head during his six-year spree. An amiable cheat, he led a
charmed life of victimless crime. Or so he has vigorously maintained
in the years since. If it's difficult to buy Abagnale's claims that
none of the clerks or tellers he gulled landed in trouble, it's even
harder to resist the fantasy of the guy who gets away with it with a
wink, a smile and no bloodshed. It's a fairy tale this country of
over-workers rarely tires of revisiting, whether "the art of the
steal" (the name of one of Abagnale's books) is worked by an escape
artist like perennial bank robber Willy Sutton or in effervescent
amusements like "Paper Moon" and "The Sting."</TE>
<TE>   You can see what attracted Spielberg to the story, especially in
the churning emotional wake of "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence" and
"Minority Report." Abagnale's appeal as a minor mythic figure lies in
his evanescence, the breezy un-complication of his character and the
gentleness of his grift. If the director had let him get away with
just being a rogue on an extended lark then "Catch Me If You Can"
would be as irresistible as one of its subject's wild scams. In its
detail and sweep, the production is immaculate -- the candy-colored
coordinates and the Googie flourishes embroidering this Playboy
Neverland are all melt-in-the mouth delectable, and the fluidity of
the filmmaking serves as another reminder that there isn't a more
technically skillful director working in American movies.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all his genre-hopping and shape-shifting Spielberg seems
to have become too big to tell small stories, which is one reason why
the film sputters on one too many false endings, as if the finale
needed to be important enough to justify the director's involvement.
However true, Abagnale's anguish winds up tediously overblown. . Lots
of kids endure their parents' bum marriage, but it's not every child
of divorce who lands on the most wanted list -- and has such a blast
in the bargain. It seems, though, that Spielberg has also become too
much a moralist to let anyone catch a free ride. Once the most
lighthearted of pop artists, he now persists in shepherding the
audience on the straight and narrow. The irony is that Abagnale has
said at 16 that all he wanted was the girls.</TE>

<HD>This 'River' is surging forward</HD>

<LD>The musical "Big River" is named after the mighty Mississippi, which
permeates the show's "Huckleberry Finn"-based script. And the journey
of L.A.'s new production of "Big River" is beginning to resemble the
Mississippi's path.</LD>
<LD>   The production began in a little northern spring -- the 90-seat
Deaf West Theatre in North Hollywood. The brook then flowed southeast
and merged with a major western tributary, the Mark Taper Forum. Now
it's gearing up to join forces with a tributary from the East -- that
is, somewhere in New York.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, L.A.'s "Big River" could find a home in the Big Apple. Deaf
West officials met last week with three New York producers.</LD>
<TE>   But the production has already come a long way. It's the first
show to be transferred from a small L.A. theater to the 750-seat
Taper, where it's playing through Jan. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the major changes in the show, said director Jeff Calhoun,
stemmed from the necessity to move from a tiny stage, in which the
audience and cast faced each other straight-on, to a much larger
stage that thrusts into the audience, creating more of a U-shaped
configuration.</TE>
<TE>   "The sight lines are drastically different with people sitting on
the sides," Calhoun said of the Taper. "Ninety-five percent of the
show plays from every seat," but "there is that inevitable 5%. The
seats on the side are the ones that lose out."</TE>
<TE>   This issue is more crucial in "Big River" than in most Taper
shows. The show's ample sign language must be clearly visible to deaf
theatergoers.</TE>
<TE>   Specially coded tickets made front and center seats available for
deaf and hearing-impaired theatergoers (and possibly hearing
companions) for $35 -- the same as the lowest regular ticket price,
normally used for side-section seating at less popular performances
times.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Marmo, a deaf theatergoer who saw the show for the first
time at the Taper, said he was seated in the middle section of the
upper level, and the signing was clear throughout. Herb Larson, a
Deaf West board member, saw the show at Deaf West and then twice at
the Taper. In the fourth row at the Taper, he said, "the signing was
much clearer and easier to follow" than it was in the 10th row, but
even in the seat farther back, "with a little more effort, I could
see pretty clearly."</TE>
<TE>   Another deaf theatergoer, John Koste, praised the signing except
for the finger-spelling of names by Scott Waara, the Taper's Mark
Twain.</TE>
<TE>   As of early December, 936 of the coded tickets had been sold, out
of a total of 41,699 tickets to the Taper production.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the need to make the signing clear, Calhoun also had to
expand the show without overproducing it. He and set designer Ray
Klausen tackled a model of the set "with a pair of scissors and
Scotch tape. We were like kids in art class."</TE>
<TE>   The set's main motif is the same as at Deaf West -- oversized
blow-ups of pages of the text of "Huckleberry Finn." But there are
more of them now, and they're bigger and move more. Some float
overhead, which, Calhoun says, not only "accentuates the vertical
luxury of the theater," but also "puts our own roof on the space and
brings down the ceiling."</TE>
<TE>   Illusions of Huck and Jim's raft and the Mississippi itself also
were expanded. The raft was only a foot from the riverbanks at Deaf
West; at the Taper, it's about three feet.</TE>
<TE>   Cast changes were made too. When the Ovation Award nominations
were announced last fall, two hearing actors in the Deaf West "Big
River," Bill O'Brien and James Black, received nods for playing Mark
Twain and the slave, Jim. Both were replaced for the Taper.</TE>
<TE>   Deaf West artistic director Ed Waterstreet felt O'Brien, who is
also the company's producing director, wouldn't have time to act and
serve as a producer of the show. So O'Brien chose to produce,
reasoning that an actor could more easily be replaced.</TE>
<TE>   That the actor now playing Mark Twain, Waara, is a Tony winner had
no bearing on the casting decision, Calhoun said.</TE>
<TE>   Black is understudying the Taper's Jim, Rufus Bonds Jr., a
Broadway veteran who played Mufasa in L.A.'s "The Lion King." Black
had appeared in only two plays before "Big River."</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little disappointed," Black said. "But just being there
is a great opportunity for me. I was enamored that it kept going. If
it goes further, I'd love to be a part of it." Black is better paid
as a Taper understudy than he was as a star at Deaf West.</TE>
<TE>   Another Tony winner, Phyllis Frelich, who is deaf, joined the cast
in a small role after another deaf actress left in order to do a TV
show.</TE>
<TE>   The Deaf West cast had nine deaf and nine hearing actors, while
the Taper cast has 10 hearing actors and eight deaf. Allen Neece, who
is deaf and played the Duke at Deaf West, is now the understudy for
Troy Kotsur, also deaf, who added the Duke to his existing duties as
Huck's Pap. One more hearing and singing actor was added to boost the
choral sound in the larger hall.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most noticeable piece of new staging at the Taper --
and one of the most praised -- is a moment when the sound suddenly
drops out of the cast's vigorous singing and signing of "Waiting for
the Light to Shine" -- but the signing continues, in total silence.
Calhoun said he added this scene during technical rehearsals, just a
couple days before previews began.</TE>
<TE>   It's an example of how much of the show's choreography, for which
Calhoun won one of his two Ovations (the other was for directing), is
actually based on signing. "I didn't think of it as choreography at
first," he said. "But so many people told me they liked the
choreography, I had to figure out what they were talking about. And
if you do equate sign language and dance, it's a ballet -- it never
stops."</TE>
<TE>   Calhoun hopes the production's ultimate home will be "a modest,
intimate Broadway house," with 900 to 1,100 seats. "You have to be
able to hear with your eyes," he said. Because most Broadway houses
are proscenium-style, he would have to adapt his staging again.</TE>
<TE>   If the production does move, Calhoun said, the 1985 musical's
original librettist, William Hauptman, has agreed to work on the
adaptation. "Which is great," Calhoun said, "because I don't fancy
myself a great writer. Up to now, all I had was my eraser."</TE>
<TE>   Reached at his Brooklyn home, Hauptman said he thought Deaf West
did "a tremendous job," judging from what he saw at the Taper on
opening night. "I can't say I think it surpasses the original, but
the signing adds poignancy. I myself didn't realize how many
references there are to someone being deaf in the original story."</TE>
<TE>   However, a few restorations of original "Big River" text might be
made, he said, in the interest of clarifying the story line.</TE>
<TE>   Rocco Landesman was among the New York producers who met with
Waterstreet and O'Brien. He also was the original "Big River"
producer and is now one of Broadway's major powers, as president of
the producing and theater-owning Jujamcyn Organization. Landesman
said several moments in the Deaf West script were not clear enough,
citing Huck's ruse in which his fellow townspeople believe he's dead
and a later scene in which Huck tears up a letter.</TE>
<TE>   "There are moments that are very moving," Landesman said, "without
being Broadway-ready. The musical values have to be bumped up" to
produce a bigger Broadway sound.</TE>
<TE>   Not that "Big River" would go directly to Broadway. Landesman said
it should go into a less costly nonprofit New York theater, with a
guaranteed group of subscribers and then transfer to Broadway if
reviews and sales warrant a move. Commercial off-Broadway venues "may
work artistically but not economically," Landesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens in the future, "Big River" is not as likely to
receive as glowing a review as one that came from Sheri Farinha
Mutti. She's a deaf woman who brought her 9-year-old daughter,
Alexandra, who can hear, to the Taper from their home near
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Mutti recalled that at one point in the show's second half, when a
slave woman's daughter is being sold to a distant owner, a tearful
Alexandra looked up at her mother and signed, "Mommy, can you hear
her voice? It's sooo powerful!" Mutti replied, "Is it? I can feel the
power in her sign language vibrating through the room."</TE>
<TE>   "We both held hands in that intense moment," Mutti said, "loving
and cherishing our bond."</TE>

<HD>For this role, he was willing to adapt</HD>
<DH>Chris Cooper broke from his usual screen persona --
laconic, hardened -- to portray the rogue, one-of-a-kind orchid
expert in 'Adaptation.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elaine Dutka</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a roll of the dice for director Spike Jonze, casting Chris
Cooper, an actor identified mostly with button-down roles, as the
skanky South Florida wild man John Laroche in his new film
"Adaptation." As portrayed on-screen, the freewheeling orchid expert
is part scientist, part con man -- and sexy, even though he's missing
his front teeth.</LD>
<LD>   "Laroche could have been played as a swaggering cartoon character
-- the cat that swallowed the canary," Jonze said. "But, because he
has so much going on inside, Chris brought a deep, broken quality
with a lot of humanity. And you trust him, as a person. It's the
Harrison Ford kind of thing."</LD>
<LD>   The gamble has paid off, given the critical acclaim that followed:
year-end awards, Oscar buzz and reviews that are hard to come by. The
movie revolves around a self-doubting writer (Nicolas Cage)
struggling to transfer "The Orchid Thief," a bestseller by New Yorker
journalist Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep) to the screen.</LD>
<TE>   Laroche poaches a rare "ghost orchid" from a state park in the
Everglades in an ill-fated attempt to clone the plant. Reading about
his arrest, Orlean tracks him down and, bored with the Manhattan
literary life, becomes enamored of his abandon and passion. In the
course of researching her story, he becomes her unlikely love
interest. (Like all the characters in the film, Laroche is based on a
real-life subject but filtered through screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's
active imagination.)</TE>
<TE>   Though the character is the opposite of his own introverted
demeanor, Cooper never doubted that he could play Laroche, a type he
says he knew from personal experience. Growing up in Kansas City,
Mo., he encountered similar folks from the Ozarks. Now living in
Massachusetts, Cooper says there are smart, funny lobstermen there
who, with the proper education, could have "ruled the world and gone
on to become CEOs."</TE>
<TE>   The initial challenge: convincing Jonze he was right for the part.
Watching a "name" actor leaving the audition, he realized the job
wasn't his for the asking.</TE>
<TE>   Because the character was so wide-ranging, Cooper went out on a
limb, delivering a variety of interpretations at the 2 1/2-hour
tryout -- and the shoot. In the scene where Laroche picked up Orlean
in his car, for instance, the actor played it both as "the smartest
guy in the world -- you're lucky to be in my presence" and as a "man
intimidated by a New Yorker journalist who probably regards him as a
piece of Florida trash." Not until viewing the final cut two months
ago did he know what choices Jonze made. (For that scene, Jonze went
with the arrogant approach.)</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Film Critics Assn. and the National Board of
Review have given Cooper their best supporting actor awards. Next
month, he'll also be competing for the Hollywood Foreign Press'
Golden Globe and a "Critics' Choice" award from the Broadcast Film
Critics. Whether the actor goes on to win the Big One, or not, his
freewheeling, almost raffish interpretation of Laroche has been
hailed as a clear-cut departure from his usual screen portrayals.</TE>
<TE>   Since appearing in John Sayles' "Matewan," (1987), Cooper has
inhabited a series of personas he calls "concealed": hardened Texas
sheriff ("Lone Star"), repressed military man ("American Beauty"),
stern father ("October Sky"), and humorless spymaster ("The Bourne
Identity"). Next time out, he returns to the "laconic" mode,
portraying a down-on-his-luck horse trainer who prefers animals to
people in Gary Ross' "Seabiscuit," due out from Universal Pictures
next summer. His normally sandy hair is cut close and dyed "old man
yellow," for the part.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if I chose those roles or they chose me," the
51-year-old actor said over dinner at his West Hollywood hotel. "It's
not a source of frustration. I'm thrilled with my body of work. But
it's only the young directors, the first-time directors, the foreign
directors who've taken a risk, refusing to accept me as just one
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Though Cooper didn't meet Laroche until the premiere, five hours
of videotape provided clues about attitude and body language. To
capture the man's frenetically lean, wiry physique, the actor took
off 20 pounds in three weeks, getting down to his high school weight.
In some areas, though, Laroche -- atypically reserved on the video --
needed to be punched up, Cooper was convinced: "Playing a mirror
image of him would have been a disservice. He was a starting point,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Known for immersing himself in "homework" and scrawling all over
his scripts, Cooper hung out at the Boston Flower Show for several
days and visited estates with greenhouses. Repeatedly reading
Orlean's book provided an additional "road map." That the
tooth-deprived, stringy-haired Laroche (a look achieved by "Halloween
teeth" inserted over his own and nine hours' worth of hair
extensions) is perceived as a sex symbol is an endless source of
amazement.</TE>
<TE>   "It scares me," maintained Cooper, casually attired in a black
sweatshirt and jeans. "If the female public says that, they befuddle
me, as they have all my life. I don't think Orlean would have fallen
for Laroche were it not for that fictitious drug she took."</TE>
<TE>   A serious sort who tends to "berate" himself, Cooper said he
learned a lot from Streep. "A couple of weeks into the shoot, things
weren't going well and I was mumbling to myself," the actor recalls
in a soft, measured voice suggesting his Midwestern roots.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard this little voice behind me -- 'stop whining!' It was
Meryl. Her attitude: 'You're lucky to have this part ... enjoy! It's
not reconstructive surgery.' She's also forgiving of herself. This
doesn't work? La di da -- try that! I've never had as much fun
working with an actor."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Cooper acknowledges, he was overwhelmed by the prospect of
the nude scene -- his first. "There was Meryl and there were more
than 30 new camera people, most of them women," he recalls with a
grin. "They were called in to make sure the scene was covered well.
Trying to make me feel more comfortable, they gave me a little,
flesh-colored sock. It was almost more embarrassing to wear it, but
out of respect for Meryl, I did."</TE>
<TE>   Shyness was an ongoing problem for Cooper, the son of a housewife
and a doctor-cattleman. While studying at the University of Missouri,
he vowed to get "unblocked." Taking dance classes at nearby Stephens
College, he was one of only three men amid a roomful of women.
Plieing across the floor everyday, he made a "complete fool" of
himself, he says -- helping to overcome his inhibitions. Acting was
another means of expression -- "theater, as therapy," he says.
Post-graduation, in 1976, he headed for New York where he studied
with Stella Adler and Wynn Handman. To pay the bills, he worked in
construction, served as a janitor and, as a chauffeur, drove
"well-to-do gentlemen to their cottages in Long Island."</TE>
<TE>   After 12 years of stage work, including seasons at the Actors
Theatre of Louisville and the Seattle Repertory, Cooper landed the
lead role of the pacifist union organizer in "Matewan," directed by
Sayles. (The director said he liked the actor's "haunted" quality,
the suggestion of a "past.") Following his 1991 portrayal of a
construction foreman in "City of Hope," another Sayles film, Cooper
played supporting roles in studio fare such as "Guilty by Suspicion"
and "This Boys' Life." Still, Hollywood didn't know what to do with
him.</TE>
<TE>   Sayles' "Lone Star" (1996), written with Cooper in mind, was a
breakthrough, of sorts, sending a flood of scripts his way. ("A face
made for honesty, a body made for sin," an Entertainment Weekly
critic said of his portrayal of a sheriff who suspects his
lawman-father had been up to no good.) Three years later, the
critically acclaimed coming-of-age drama "October Sky" was supposed
to reel in his first wide audience. That scenario was revised,
however, when the picture failed to take off.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper is open to leading-man roles, of course. But ensemble work
is still a strong draw. In May, he'll be seen as a university
professor in HBO's "My House in Umbria," the story of an eclectic
group of people thrown together after a terrorist attack. And when it
comes to raising his profile, living near Plymouth, Mass., rather
than in the film capital of the world certainly hasn't helped.</TE>
<TE>   "I suspect that a lot of studio executives still think of me as
'what's-his-name,' " he said. "And when Steven Spielberg came to the
'Seabiscuit' set, it was clear he wasn't aware of my work before
'American Beauty.' I didn't take that as a slight. I don't go to the
studios with producers and directors. I don't rub elbows with actors.
Even Elizabeth Pena, who I made love to in 'Lone Star,' didn't
realize I was in 'American Beauty,' until she saw the credits."</TE>
<TE>   Spending time with wife Marianne and 15-year-old Jesse has
provided instant perspective. Mentally astute, his son uses a
wheelchair because he has cerebral palsy. Jesse's "the best thing
that has happened to us," the actor says, speaking at length about
the family's victories: a successful battle to get Jesse
mainstreamed, a computer that helps him communicate, how well he's
doing in school.</TE>
<TE>   "Like many husbands, I was reluctant to have a child, but Jesse
has instilled in us what's really important," Cooper said, with the
same passion he brings to Laroche. "He seems so normal to us, now.
And what a great teacher: His patience is extraordinary and, because
he's so limited, he's very, very, focused. At the expense of sounding
ghoulish, Jesse has fueled the characters I've played. He's filled my
emotional life."</TE>
<TE>   Though the recognition for his work in "Adaptation" is sweet,
Cooper says, it's not the main course. That's what Oscar contenders
usually profess, but he's believable -- as ever.</TE>
<TE>   "These awards are a midlife adventure," the actor says. "But it's
always been a good ride. I just want to keep working. No more, no
less."</TE>

<LD>I can't believe my mom and dad, having a baby at their age, at this
time of the year.</LD>
<LD>   I mean, what's going on here?</LD>
<LD>   First they come home with this new baby boy, and then my dad's so
tired I have to write his stupid column for him while I'm home from
college.</LD>
<TE>   This is supposed to be my winter break and my family's chance to
make me the center of attention and here's this baby stealing the
spotlight. So much for silent nights.</TE>
<TE>   "Honey, can you grab your baby brother for me?" my mom keeps
asking.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom!"</TE>
<TE>   "Just for a few minutes," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "OK," I say, and hold him till he stops crying.</TE>
<TE>   Did you know babies require almost constant care? I mean,
constant. Just because I'm the oldest daughter do I have to do
everything? Sure, he's really cute and all, but give me a break. Life
isn't noisy and dirty enough without a baby?</TE>
<TE>   "What kind of midlife crisis is this?" I say to my dad. "Can't you
just get a Corvette and a toupee like other midlife guys?"</TE>
<TE>   And he says, "This is a toupee, sweetie."</TE>
<TE>   "Sorry," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't worry, it looks very real," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He's always making flip remarks, my dad. I think it's just this
generation of fathers that makes the flip remarks.</TE>
<TE>   "He think he's Sam Malone," my mom says.</TE>
<TE>   "Who?"</TE>
<TE>   "The bartender on 'Cheers,' " she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Great," I say. "Dad idolizes TV bartenders."</TE>
<TE>   This morning, my dad is on the couch with the baby, the two of
them laughing at each other like a comedy team. "I think this kid has
a very sophisticated sense of irony," my dad says, "for his age."</TE>
<TE>   "He's 2 weeks old, Dad," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh no, time for another diaper," he says and hands the baby to
me.</TE>
<TE>   If you ask me, there should be some sort of upper age limit for
having babies.</TE>
<TE>   Like what? Like when the dad drools more than the baby.</TE>
<TE>   Or when the brand-new baby has more hair than the dad.</TE>
<TE>   Or when they both wear diapers. I'm just joking about the diapers,
but it's not that far-fetched.</TE>
<TE>   My mom and dad, they're at the age where they need to be saving up
for my wedding or maybe a nice graduation gift, and instead, they're
preoccupied with this baby. I swear, this has to be the most twisted
Christmas ever.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of old people, my grandpa is here for Christmas too. You
can tell he's in town because when he snores, the windows rattle and
the Hollywood sign quivers a little.</TE>
<TE>   I say, "Grandpa, you're not having any more babies, are you?" and
he says, "No, we thought we'd wait."</TE>
<TE>   See? Twisted.</TE>
<TE>   Yesterday, my dad walks into the room, all cranky and stuff,
bellowing like the Ghost of Christmas Past. Legs creaking, his
stomach making all sorts of intestinal sounds. Like a symphony of
gases. If you have a dad, you probably know what I'm talking about.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, someone water the Christmas tree!" he yells. "Eighty bucks
and they treat it like a stick of gum."</TE>
<TE>   "Gum, Dad?" I say.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the best I could think of at the moment," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, I'll water the tree," says my teenage brother, and then hits
my dad up for snowboard money.</TE>
<TE>   I think this Christmas has been kind of rough on my dad. He's
pretty tired staying up with the baby and running around shopping. He
says that if he hears one more Karen Carpenter song, he's "going to
embrace Judaism."</TE>
<TE>   I think he's joking but you never know with my dad. Sometimes you
think "he's got to be kidding" and then you find out he's completely
serious. I guess that's a dad for you.</TE>
<TE>   He's always such a wise guy. Christmas is supposed to be about
wise men, not wise guys. If the Bible said, "And then three wise guys
spotted a bright star over Bethlehem ...," Christmas might be totally
different. Anyway, that's how our holiday is going.</TE>
<TE>   I have to go now on account of the baby is crying, and my mom is
yelling at my dad and my little sister is putting the Christmas
stockings on the dog. In other words, things are pretty normal around
here.</TE>
<TE>   I'll say one thing though. Christmas is no time to have a baby.</TE>

<HD>A New Yorker role that's maid to order</HD>
<DH>Playing J. Lo's feisty best friend could be Marissa
Matrone's big break.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Goodman</AU>
<BD>Newsday</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>"Maid in Manhattan" is a holiday trifle, a standard Cinderella story
made in New York in a New York minute that shot off the starting
blocks like a New York sprinter (No. 1 in its first week after
opening Dec. 13, with $18.7 million in sales). It's a nice little
vehicle for Jennifer Lopez, with Ralph Fiennes as her Prince Charming
and a supporting cast that includes Natasha Richardson, Stanley Tucci
and Bob Hoskins.</LD>
<LD>   And who plays J. Lo's best friend, the hotel maid who pushes her
to apply for management, who gets her to try on Richardson's fancy
clothes, who prompts her to go out with Fiennes, who nags and insists
and makes her fulfill her dream? Who, in fact, is the only major
character who seems to revel in being a New Yorker, not some
deracinated star who could have come from anywhere (although Lopez
does use a trace of her own local Latino lilt)? Marissa Matrone.</LD>
<LD>   Who?</LD>
<TE>   Marissa Matrone, 30, raised on Long Island, who learned the hotel
business from the inside during the many summers her family spent at
the Nevele Grand Resort in the Catskills, where her father, Joseph,
now a retired school administrator, ran the day camp. Her name is in
the credits somewhere, but it's outweighed by the other actors, some
of whom do a good bit less on screen but who have much heftier
resumes.</TE>
<TE>   This is, after all, Matrone's first movie. She auditioned on
Valentine's Day, got the part a month later and finished doing some
re-shooting in September. It comes on the heels of her first Broadway
roles -- a year and a half in "Sideman" as Patsy, the gutsy Bronx
barmaid to Edie Falco's Terry, and eventually succeeding Falco when
that Long Island actress left to shoot "The Sopranos." (Matrone also
has been on "The Sopranos," among several other minor television
appearances.) And that was her first professional role since earning
her MFA from the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   Matrone's rise has not exactly been meteoric -- she wasn't
discovered somewhere as a teenager. Nor has she gotten her start
because her parents were stars before her. But her progress has been
steady, since the days as a 3- and 4-year-old who loved to dress up
and run around the neighborhood, who got a kick out of putting on
little plays with her little friends and who loved to grab the mike
at weddings.</TE>
<TE>   Matrone was always involved in acting, although for most of her
school life, that competed with her love of athletics: soccer,
softball, diving. She finally made the decision to pursue the stage
when she enrolled at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst,
which has a major theater program.</TE>
<TE>   "As a woman, I realized there was no future in [athletics] for
me," she said over sausage and eggs at a coffee shop around the
corner from her Bank Street apartment in the West Village.</TE>
<TE>   But all that athleticism, that emphasis on the physical, appears
to have stood her in good stead. Seen in person, what connects
Matrone with movie maid Stephanie Kehoe are the triangular face and
almond eyes. Otherwise, this upright, petite, shapely young woman
with brown hair flowing below her shoulders bears no resemblance to
the thick-waisted, slouching, hard-bitten worker who clearly has seen
some of the dark corners of the world.</TE>
<TE>   Standing outside in a chilly playground nearby, she scrunched down
to show the difference in posture and carriage. "I was heavier,"
Matrone said. "I wore an unflattering bra, I took the sweat pads out
of the dress." Essentially, "I wanted to be the Ethel to [Lopez's]
Lucy."</TE>
<TE>   What was it like to work with the moment's hottest celebrity? "At
first, I found myself staring at her. She is so beautiful; she has an
intense presence. It was intimidating. But she's like a New York
girl. We connected. We have a similar sense of humor."</TE>
<TE>   All right then. A successful Broadway introduction, a successful
movie debut, a few minor television appearances -- where does life go
from here?</TE>
<TE>   "I've gone on some auditions," Matrone said. "People are calling.
I'm reading some scripts. People say, 'Yeah, we know her.' " But
Hollywood shuts down for the holidays, so she doesn't expect any real
movement until next month. One thing, though: "I don't want to be
typecast as a New Yorker. I can be British, I can be Spanish." (In
college, she was the only white person in an otherwise all-black
production of Shakespeare's "Richard III." "At the [movie] premiere,
I looked very feminine and classy. People didn't recognize me at
first."</TE>
<TE>   Indications are, from now on, that won't be much of a problem.</TE>

<HD>Museum sits out this hand</HD>
<DH>The Guggenheim Las Vegas is closing temporarily while it
seeks funding for future exhibitions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Haithman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Guggenheim Las Vegas, which opened 15 months ago at the Venetian
Resort Hotel Casino with a flashy exhibition of motor muscle titled
"Art of the Motorcycle," will close for at least four weeks beginning
Jan. 5 while the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum seeks funding for
future exhibitions.</LD>
<LD>   The Venetian's Guggenheim Hermitage Museum, which opened at the
same time and represents a collaboration between the Guggenheim and
the famed State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, will
remain open, Guggenheim officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   That gallery, which has exhibited works from the Guggenheim, the
Hermitage and Vienna's Kunsthistorisches, plans as its next
exhibition a collection of modern American art from the Guggenheim's
collection and is in negotiations for a Norman Rockwell show.</LD>
<TE>   "It's very simple. There are several exhibitions in advanced
stages of development to go into that space, and we're currently
seeking funding. It's nothing out of the ordinary," Guggenheim
official Betsy Ennis said of the Guggenheim Las Vegas, a
63,700-square-foot space informally dubbed the Big Box by its
architect, Rem Koolhaas.</TE>
<TE>   "We look forward to future cultural endeavors with the Guggenheim,
ones that will please and delight our patrons," said Kurt Ouchida,
director of communications for the Venetian. "We would like the
Guggenheim to take the necessary time to find the right programming;
we are looking for the right show with the right type of sponsorship.
It's an ambitious space."</TE>
<TE>   The Guggenheim's two spaces were estimated to cost about $30
million. Ouchida said they have collectively drawn close to a million
visitors since they opened in October 2001just after the terrorist
attacks which severely curtailed Las Vegas' tourism. He declined to
comment on whether the Venetian considered "Art of the Motorcycle" to
be a financial success for the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement of the temporary closure follows a wave of
financial woes for the Guggenheim.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, the Guggenheim's operating budget has been
reduced drastically. Staff has been cut from 339 full-time positions
in November 2001 to 181, and New York's Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum
has cut its operating hours.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, major benefactor Peter Lewis, an Ohio auto insurance
magnate, bailed out the troubled New York museum with a donation of
$12 million, but put its director, Thomas Krens, on notice that he
must operate on a more modest budget.</TE>
<TE>   Neil Cantor , director of finance for the Bellagio Gallery of Fine
Art, said that while all areas of the Las Vegas entertainment
industry were hit hard by the events of Sept. 11, the city's

<HD>Retrospective introduces obscure French success</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Johanna Kiamzon</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Vaguely warm expressions of elegant French upper-class men and women
contrast with the Middle Eastern scenes of people in flowing robes,
splashes of color defining their contours.</LD>
<LD>   The Metropolitan Museum of Art's retrospective, "Theodore
Chasseriau (1819-1856): The Unknown Romantic," introduces the works
of a talented French artist who achieved meteoric success and
controversy during his time yet whose works fell into obscurity
afterward.</LD>
<LD>   His only previous retrospective was in 1933 in Paris.</LD>
<TE>   Born in 1819 in Samana, Dominican Republic, to a French diplomat
father and the French-Creole daughter of planters, he moved with his
family to Paris when he was 2. At 12, he entered the studio of
Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, a master of Neo-Classicism.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later, his work was accepted by the annual Paris Salon.
Through his brother's government connections, he won state and church
commissions and painted and drew numerous portraits of members of the
elite circles in which he easily moved. Physically delicate, he died
at the age of 37 from fatigue.</TE>
<TE>   Critics during his time often unfavorably compared him to Ingres,
known for his strong lines, and to the romantic Eugene Delacroix -- a
proponent of strong emotion, imagination, freedom from classical
correctness.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Chasseriau's works were considered unoriginal and the
indecisive outcomes of these two influences.</TE>
<TE>   But these criticisms do not seem to matter when examining his
commanding portraits -- 126 works arranged chronologically and
thematically in the show.</TE>
<TE>   Facing the entrance to the exhibit is the "The Two Sisters" from
1843. It is "extraordinarily graceful with broad expanse of colors,"
says Gary Tinterow, curator of the exhibit, noting the deep red of
the identical huge shawls and the green wall behind the artist's
sisters, Adele and Aline.</TE>
<TE>   Another important work among his early portraits is the "Comtesse
de La Tour-Maubourg" (1841), a recent and important acquisition for
the Met. The painting has not been seen since the 1933 retrospective.</TE>
<TE>   According to Tinterow, Chasseriau beat out Ingres for the
commission to do the portrait of the wife of the French ambassador in
Rome. The pink folds of the subject's dress, along with "The Two
Sisters" shawls, approach the vividness of the hypnotic blue dress of
Ingres' "Princesse de Broglie" and the gold chair on which the
princess leans.</TE>
<TE>   There is a flatness to the Maubourg painting. A more vibrant,
warmer image is "Marie-Therese de Cabarus" (1848). The subject is
shown in pink gown and matching shawl and tiara of pink flowers; she
carries a bouquet of small blue flowers.</TE>
<TE>   As with most of Chasseriau's portrait drawings and paintings, the
subjects are delicate-looking, though their arms are fleshy, with
oval-shaped faces, very expressive, elongated eyes and rather gauzy
chins.</TE>
<TE>   Although he continued with traditional styles of painting,
Chasseriau also painted with the lush colors of the romantics.</TE>
<TE>   Chasseriau visited Algeria in 1846, influenced by Delacroix, who
set the trend for other painters by first going there. Later he
produced scenes of marketplaces, imagined harems and battles,
characterized by much energy, color and impressionistic lines.</TE>
<TE>   In "Moorish Dancers," from 1849, two women, one in a red and gold
dress and the other in blue, pace in the center of the painting,
holding fabric in each hand and surrounded by male and female
spectators. Lines only suggest facial contours, dress folds and
designs and rug patterns and shapes, but the effect is pleasing.</TE>
<TE>   The retrospective was organized by the Met, the Reunion des Musees
Nationaux, Paris, the Louvre Museum and the Museums of Strasbourg.
Accompanied by a thick catalog, the show remains on view through Jan.
5 and will not travel.</TE>

<LD>Has your mom ever said your bedroom is like a black hole? Is it so
messy that stuff goes in, never to return?</LD>
<LD>   Black holes are denser than anything else in the universe. They
are so dense and their gravity is so great, even light can't escape
them. That means anything that comes close to a black hole gets
pulled into it.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists believe there are at least two types of black holes.
Supermassive black holes have as much mass as 1 million to 100
million suns! Stellar-mass black holes have the mass of only one big
star, four to 15 times as big as our sun. When this type of star runs
out of fuel, its life ends in a supernova explosion. What's left can
collapse to become a black hole.</LD>
<TE>   Because no light energy is able to escape black holes, they can't
be seen like stars or planets. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
(LISA) will help scientists locate and learn about black holes. You
can learn more about LISA by visiting spaceplace
.nasa.gov/lisa_fact2.htm.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, if your bedroom were really a black hole, it would be
spotless! In fact, your mom would never see your room, because no
light would escape it. But you should still clean it every once in a
while.</TE>

<HD>Prestige, perspective for Kennedy honorees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chita Rivera confesses that it is taking time to "really settle in"
to being a recipient of a prestigious Kennedy Center Honor.</LD>
<LD>   But the Tony Award-winning musical-comedy veteran of such shows as
"West Side Story," "Bye Bye Birdie," "Chicago" and "Kiss of the
Spider Woman" says she was able to put the honor in perspective the
day after receiving the award. "I found myself walking down my
driveway taking the garbage out," says Rivera, who has a cameo in the
new movie version of "Chicago." "It was really very funny," she says.
"I should have worn my medal!"</LD>
<LD>   Joining Rivera as recipients this year are actor James Earl Jones,
conductor James Levine, singer-songwriter Paul Simon and actress
Elizabeth Taylor. CBS telecasts the two-hour special, "The 25th
Annual Kennedy Center Honors: A Celebration of the Performing Arts,"
on Friday.</LD>
<TE>   The star-studded, black-tie event was taped Dec. 8 at the Kennedy
Center's Opera House in the nation's capital, with President George
W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush in attendance. As is customary with
the honors, they were bestowed the night before at a State Department
dinner hosted by Secretary of State Colin Powell.</TE>
<TE>   Rivera, an ageless 69, says that Powell "was the hit of the State
Department dinner. He sang an entire chorus of 'America.' Everybody
just flipped. He's quite a funny man."</TE>
<TE>   Creator and executive producer George Stevens Jr. says the Kennedy
Center Honors have fulfilled all of his expectations. "I didn't see
all of the ramifications," he says. "But in 1978, there was no
national recognition for people in the performing arts. This was to
fill the gap, and I think it has in spades."</TE>
<TE>   A respectable ratings getter, the special is one of the classiest
shows to grace the small screen every year. Stevens praises CBS for
airing the show since its inception. "It's a wonderful partnership
because they believe in it," says Stevens. "They ask us to do the
show that the Kennedy Center wants as opposed to trying to bend it to
the times."</TE>
<TE>   Stevens admits that audiences' expectations for the Kennedy Center
Honors show are extremely high, making the show no easy task. "The
nightmare begins the day after each show," he says. "We have to find
ways to meet those expectations. The secret is that each year we have
five new lives to deal with and that is the inspiration."</TE>
<TE>   Each year, an artists committee of 100 people from all different
areas of the performing arts makes recommendations for the Kennedy
Center Honors. Stevens says that sometimes the public writes in with
recommendations. "Then the chairman of the Kennedy Center and the
president of the Kennedy Center and I work with those recommendations
and bring a slate of perhaps a dozen names to the executive committee
of the Kennedy Center, which is the governing group. They make the
final decisions."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in the Kennedy Center Honors' history, one of
the honorees this year, Paul McCartney, had to decline. "It was
totally unexpected," says Stevens. "After he enthusiastically
accepted, apparently his daughter decided to get married and set her
wedding date for that weekend. So he was very apologetic and asked to
be considered for next year."</TE>
<TE>   Waiting in the wings was another musical Paul -- Paul Simon.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul had been discussed and was destined for next year," says
Stevens. "So we were able to make this transition."</TE>
<TE>   Each honoree is kept in the dark regarding his or her tribute,
which typically includes some laudatory comments and a performance
celebrating the honoree's career. "Chicago" director Rob Marshall
staged Rivera's toe-tapping celebration.</TE>
<TE>   "It was amazing," says Rivera. "You are going to see
[singer-dancer] Charlotte D'Amboise. You are going to see my sweet
Brian Stokes Mitchell" -- Rivera and Mitchell appeared together in
"Kiss of the Spider Woman" -- "and so many dancers who danced with me
in my [one-woman] show. They did clips and then they did the whole
dance-at-the-gym number from 'West Side Story.' Then they got, I
think, 30 or 40 little dancers from various schools around the city
for the end of the number."</TE>
<TE>   Rivera cried throughout her presentation. "Rob taught the kids the
steps and he kept saying, 'When you do this, Chita will cry. When you
do that, Chita will cry.' Isn't that adorable? I have got loving,
wonderful friends. I am a very fortunate woman to have these friends,
and they just happen to be brilliant. Isn't that something?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To see it</TE>
<TE>   "The 25th Annual Kennedy Center Honors: A Celebration of the
Performing Arts," hosted by Walter Cronkite, can be seen at 9 p.m.
Friday on CBS.</TE>

<HD>Season's greetings from the whimsy family</HD>
<DH>The Spark Christmas cards reflect artistic expression and
their unique ideas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary McNamara</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many families send out holiday cards that are essentially family
portraits -- parents and children in various degrees of matching
velvets and plaids posed somewhere meant to invoke the season. If
collected over the years, such cards would chronicle the various
changes time grants, and inflicts, on people -- children multiply and
grow, adults experiment with hairstyles, colors and silhouettes.</LD>
<LD>   Nick Spark's family Christmas cards show all of these things, but
they go way beyond that. A collection of the Spark family cards, more
than 30 years' worth, captures not only what is clearly a shared, and
slightly odd, passion for artistic expression among the family, but
also the vagaries of American popular culture.</LD>
<LD>   Consider this year's model. The panoramic-sized card is covered
with images of people standing in a gallery -- on the back are words
that appear to be German. At first glance, this seems to be a wacky
announcement for a gallery opening somewhere in Germany. A closer
inspection reveals that the dozen figures in the gallery are actually
just two women and three men -- Nick, his parents, Marcia and Ron,
his sister Marie and her husband. Upon even closer inspection, the
pictures they are looking at turn out to be images of themselves, the
photographs that they sent out as Christmas cards in years past.</LD>
<TE>   The language on the back is not really German, it's just sort of
German-ized. "Derolidaycardenspeigel des Americanskava
Familiansprache Sparksenbragel", it begins.</TE>
<TE>   Happy Holidays from the Sparks.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to go with a German expressionism theme this year," says
Spark, a filmmaker and photographer who lives in Santa Monica. "It's
a 30-year retrospective of our Christmas cards."</TE>
<TE>   And not a snowman or tartan waistcoat in sight. There are
Victorian costumes and cowboy get-ups; there are color themes -- red,
white and blue; black and white checks -- there's the
waiters-at-the-Last Supper image; several quilt-heavy hippie shots
from the early years; a rocket ship; an electric plant; there's even
a staged garage sale that includes the members of  Marie's wedding
party. The pictures unconsciously mirror many trends in American
culture -- down to Y2K paranoia -- but if you're looking for the
Claus clan, you'll have to consult a different family.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all very visual people," says Marcia Spark, who lives with
her husband, Ron, in Tucson. "And a little eccentric. But now there
are a lot of people who collect the cards, who wait to see what the
next year will be."</TE>
<TE>   At one point, she said, they were sending out 500 cards a year.
"We had to pare down a little; we didn't even know some of these
people. They just got on our list because they wanted the cards."</TE>
<TE>   Appropriately enough, this shared family obsession began with
Sigmund Freud. In 1967, newlyweds Marcia and Ron were strolling
through the Society Hill open market in Philadelphia when they saw an
indigent photographer, armed with a Polaroid and a few props, turn a
local psychiatrist into Freud. The Sparks donned a bonnet and a hat
and haven't bought commercial cards since.</TE>
<TE>   As the family reputation grew, so did the pressure. "We plan for
months in advance," says Nick. "The black-and-white check image, it
took like nine months to collect all the stuff."</TE>
<TE>   The kids loved it when they were little, hated it when they were
adolescents and love it again now that they're adults. They ran into
a little trouble when Marie married her high school sweetheart, Mohan
Vemulapalli. In his debut card -- the garage sale scene -- he looks a
tad nonplused, perhaps because they staged the photo the morning
after the wedding. And although Vemulapalli had received plenty of
cards from the Sparks, he wasn't quite prepared to take part in the
staging of strange scenes in public places.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting the cards," says Nick, "is very different from being in
them."</TE>
<TE>   One recent card included several shots in front of Seattle
landmarks, and as the Sparks were taking their picture, a tour bus
stopped and started taking pictures of them. "Mohan just lost it,"
says Nick. "It was really touch and go, but now he's down with it."</TE>
<TE>   For years now, the process of conceptualizing has been a
democratic one, so it doesn't always go smoothly. "Sometimes, if
people don't agree, it can get down to the wire," says Nick. Meaning
that the possibility of store-bought cards loomed in the middle
distance? "Yeah," he says, gulping audibly, "some years it's been
really, really scary."</TE>
<TE>   This year's image was Nick's idea and it was a hard sell. All the
previous cards had been done by simply staging a scene and getting a
family friend to shoot it. This year's was the first done digitally
-- Nick shot a gallery space and the old cards, and a friend shot the
family posing looking at nothing. "When he told us about it, none of
us could see it," says Marcia. "But we just trusted Nick, and really,
we are very excited about it."</TE>
<TE>   Nick, whose non-Christmas-card work focuses on popular culture, is
also excited about going digital.</TE>
<TE>   "Now," he says, "we can do pretty much anything."</TE>

<HD>Irish ballad is world's favorite</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Irish republican rallying cry, "A Nation Once Again," has been
named the world's favorite song ever, after a global poll by the BBC.</LD>
<LD>   The ballad, performed by the group the Wolfe Tones, was among a
minority of Western songs in the top 10 list and only narrowly
triumphed over Indian patriotic song, "Vande Mataram," the BBC said.</LD>
<LD>   Wolfe Tones leader Brian Warfield said from Dublin: "The song was
written to give the Irish people back a bit of spirit and support the
fight to overturn [British rule], so I am very happy to see it is
still giving us spirit the world over."</LD>
<TE>   The poll of BBC World Service listeners attracted 150,000 votes
from 153 countries and revealed the diversity of the world's musical
tastes.</TE>
<TE>   Also finishing in the top 10 were a Bollywood movie song, a love
song from Nepal, a Tamil Tiger film song and the pop song "Believe"
from singer/actress Cher.</TE>
<TE>   The BBC said some artists suffered in the voting stakes because so
many of their songs were nominated, splitting the vote. The Beatles
had 55 songs nominated and Iranian artist Googoosh had 40. Reggae
legend Bob Marley had 29 songs nominated; "No Woman No Cry" finished
highest among them.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC's "Meet the Press" host Tim Russert has agreed to terms with
Miramax Books for a memoir about fathers and sons, ending an intense
bidding war.</LD>
<LD>   The memoir, not yet titled, is scheduled to come in time for
Father's Day 2004.</LD>
<LD>   "The book will share the lessons, anecdotes and advice given to
Russert by his dad while growing up in Buffalo, N.Y.; about family,
faith, patriotism, sports, politics, school, work, cars,
relationships and more," a Miramax statement said.</LD>
<TE>   Russert's representative, Washington attorney Bob Barnett, said
that about 10 publishers competed for the book. Financial terms were
not disclosed, but a source close to the negotiations said the deal
was worth about $3 million.</TE>

<LD>French movies won more viewers abroad in the first 11 months of this
year -- 40.2 million -- than in all of 2001, according to Unifrance,
the promoter of French films overseas.</LD>
<LD>   The new numbers mean 2002 will be a record year, eclipsing the
record of 37.4 million set last year, the group said.</LD>
<LD>   The last two years "have been the best that French films have had
for at least 10 years" in foreign theaters, the group said.</LD>
<TE>   The average number of viewers over the last decade has been around
17 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Europe is still France's main market. Unifrance said Western
Europe made up 53% of tickets sold for French films in the first 11
months of 2002. Eastern and central Europe made up 13%, while 18% of
tickets were sold in America.</TE>

<HD>Aztecs captivate London</HD>
<DH>The rich, brutal, short-lived civilization of ancient
Mexico is captured in an exhibit that its director calls 'a minor
miracle.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Stobart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>LONDON -- During a grim and rainy season, a virtual trip into a world
of sun worshipers, animal gods and human sacrifice is pulling in
crowds here and provoking horror and fascination.</LD>
<LD>   "The Aztecs" exhibition at London's Royal Academy of Arts looks at
the flourishing Mexican civilization that fell under the onslaught of
the 16th century Spanish conquistadors. With an extraordinary
collection of sculpted gods and animals as well as relics, artifacts
and manuscripts -- some on display for the first time -- the show is
as complete a view as can be seen of this lost world. Norman
Rosenthal, the exhibition director, calls it "a minor miracle."</LD>
<LD>   Felipe Solis Olguin, director of the National Museum of
Anthropology, and Eduardo Matos Moctezuma, curator of the National
Institute of Anthropology and History, first offered the Mexico City
museum's Aztec collection to the Royal Academy for an exhibition
seven years ago, under sponsorship from the Mexican government.</LD>
<TE>   The academy curators and their Mexican colleagues then worked
tirelessly to persuade European and American museums and collectors
to contribute priceless pieces, producing what Solis Olguin calls "an
acknowledgment of the boundless creativity of the Aztec
civilization."</TE>
<TE>   The "miracle" happened and, as Rosenthal says, barring a few
pieces too difficult to transport, "you have everything there is to
see of the Aztecs. There is virtually nothing left to show."</TE>
<TE>   A migrant population that spoke the Nahuatl tongue of
pre-Colombian tribes in the Mesoamerican basin, the Aztecs had a
short but intense life span as a civilization. In three centuries,
they adopted and developed the religions and mores of their
precursors in the region, founded Tenochtitlan -- today's Mexico City
-- and created a vast and complex empire.</TE>
<TE>   A view of Tenochtitlan as it appeared in the 14th century opens
the exhibition. It shows a marvel of urban planning in the swamps
around Lake Texcoco, with an intricate system of causeways and
canals, massive pyramids and temples, all centered on the focal place
of worship and sacrifice: the Templo Mayor or Great Temple.</TE>
<TE>   The Aztecs paid bloodcurdling homage to their gods and never
discovered the wheel. Yet they worked out a sophisticated calendar,
invented a script and became master craftsmen and builders.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't have the same kind of lure as the Incas or the Mayas,"
said Adrian Locke, curator of the exhibition. "But they happened at
that magic moment in history when two cultures collided."</TE>
<TE>   In the early 16th century, Aztec ruler Montezuma amazed Spanish
explorer Hernan Cortes and his army with sumptuous feasts and gifts
of finely worked gold and silver. He also horrified them with
religious rites of idol worship and human sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition follows the evolution of the Aztecs' religion,
complex social hierarchy and uncompromising reverence for the natural
world. Visitors are shown carefully carved deifications of the animal
world: sculptures of jaguars, dogs, monkeys, insects and reptiles.</TE>
<TE>   In the belief that gods sacrificed themselves to keep up the cycle
of light and life, and to ensure that the sun rose, the seasons
turned and seeds bore fruit, the Aztecs gave sacrifices. On display
are some of the carved stone altars on which animals and humans were
offered to the myriad deities to whom they were in constant debt:
virtually every natural phenomena, including gods of rain, wind, sun,
life, death, fertility and growth.</TE>
<TE>   "They strike open the wretched Indian's chest with flint knives
and hastily tear out the palpitating heart," wrote Bernal Diaz del
Castillo, a survivor and chronicler of Cortes' expeditions.</TE>
<TE>   Recent excavations of the Templo Mayor have produced unique
exhibits, such as the magnificent terra cotta eagle man with winged
arms, clawed legs and vestiges of feathers thought to be none other
than the god of the rising sun.</TE>
<TE>   They also brought to light Mictlantecuhtli, god of the dead. This
extraordinary terra cotta figure stands open-mouthed with raised claw
hands in vigilant expectation. His rib cage is open and his liver,
the organ believed to house the human spirit, hangs out.</TE>
<TE>   Important too was Xipetotec, god of goldsmiths, worshiped at the
start of the seed-germinating season. He is shown in various
postures, squatting or standing, often wearing a bubbled cloak -- the
human skin of flayed sacrificial victims, turned inside out.</TE>
<TE>   But Aztecs were not merely barbaric performers of grotesque
sacrificial rituals. "People tend to condemn them as an alien
culture," said Locke, who believes instead that they were a
principled people of strong beliefs and fear of the unknown.</TE>
<TE>   "I think their work is incredibly refined and captures a sense of
feeling of the insignificant nature of men compared to gods,
particularly in their representation of animals and anthropomorphism
of gods," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Cortes condemned their idolatry -- anathema to 16th century Roman
Catholic Spain -- but admired their artists.</TE>
<TE>   "All things of which Montezuma has ever heard, both on land and in
the sea, they have modeled, very realistically, either in gold or
silver or in jewels or feather and with such perfection that they
seem almost real," he wrote in 1519.</TE>
<TE>   Gold and silver ornaments made up much of the loot taken back to
Spain by Cortes, often to be melted down. Some surviving pieces,
which were worn by the aristocracy of the class-conscious Aztec
society, are in the exhibit. Most are perfectly formed animals, birds
and frogs, worked into pendants, earrings or lip ornaments.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the 16th century, the Aztec civilization was largely
destroyed by disease and Spanish armies, but traces remained. Final
exhibits show the collision of Aztec and Christian cultures. One
feathered mosaic Christian icon is a carved stone cross bearing not
the whole crucified Jesus but body parts as Aztec emblems of
sacrifice and regeneration, carved in relief: Christ's head and
wounded hands, a sacrificial knife and drops of blood.</TE>
<TE>   Feathers also adorn an ornate chalice of rock crystal and gold
from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   The codices, or manuscripts, on show are unique written records of
Spanish incursions into the New World. Original Aztec and other
pre-Hispanic writings in native hieroglyphics portray legends and
calendars in colorful vegetable dyes on animal hides and tree bark.
Other writings are Spanish translations of Aztec accounts of their
own history, done by missionaries in their efforts to understand the
culture they were trying to convert.</TE>
<TE>   They are the crowning touch to the show, written testament to a
people whose whole tangible history can be contained in a few rooms
of an art gallery but can still amaze today's virtual explorers.</TE>

<HD>Learning About Nature: How to Make a Snow Cave</HD>

<LD>Maria and Alfonso were taking a winter nature walk with Uncle Ruben
in the snowy landscape of the San Bernardino Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   Uncle Ruben led them on a trail that went by a stone acorn
grinder. He pointed to it, saying, "That was left by the Indians who
once lived in these mountains."</LD>
<LD>   Alfonso began to look around at the snowy landscape, peering under
the black oaks and pines.</LD>
<TE>   "How did the Indians stay warm out here in the woods?" asked
Alfonso, shivering.</TE>
<TE>   "The people lived in homes made from poles and covered them with
thick layers of leaves," said Uncle Ruben. "But if someone got stuck
out in the snow, they'd build a simple snow cave to stay warm."</TE>
<TE>   "Can we make one?" both children asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure," said Uncle Ruben, motioning the children toward a thick
snowdrift near a rock outcrop.</TE>
<TE>   "Put on your gloves," he instructed them. Uncle Ruben pulled three
metal pie tins out of his pack.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll use these as shovels. First we burrow a tunnel into this
drift, then hollow it out," explained Uncle Ruben.</TE>
<TE>   Once he showed the children what to do, they excitedly scooped out
a tunnel, and, within 45 minutes, had shoveled out a cavity in the
snow big enough for the three of them.</TE>
<TE>   "Now," instructed Uncle Ruben, "let's cover the bottom with a
thick layer of pine needles. That will keep us warm."</TE>
<TE>   "OK," yelled the children, as they quickly gathered pine needles
and dragged them into the cave. Finally, all three got inside.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, I like it in here," said Alfonso.</TE>
<TE>   "Me too," said Maria. "I'm glad we made this. But I'd rather spend
the night at the lodge."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone laughed as they walked back.</TE>

<HD>Despite the music, 'Merry Widow' barely survives its update</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Pasles</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Francisco Opera general manager Lotfi Mansouri created an opulent
production of Franz Lehar's "The Merry Widow" as his swan song last
year when he ended his 13-year tenure at the company. He commissioned
new English dialogue by playwright Wendy Wasserstein ("The Heidi
Chronicles") and new English lyrics by a team of writers and directed
the staging himself.</LD>
<LD>   PBS was on hand to tape a performance in the War Memorial Opera
House, which will be broadcast tonight (9 p.m. KCET).</LD>
<LD>   Critics were unimpressed with Wasserstein's updated dialogue, even
less impressed by the lyrics by Christopher Hassall and Ted and Deena
Puffer and exasperated with Mansouri's emphasis on silliness and
shtick.</LD>
<TE>   And as the production makes the transition to television, things
don't get better. Gary Halvorson's direction for the small screen in
particular adds problems of its own. The camera work is often busy
and restless, shifting from disorienting close-ups to wide-angle
shots and cutaways, particularly when the stage is full. The dance
sequences suffer the most, with legs and arms amputated and dancers
flying in and out of the frame.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Amanda McKerrow and John Gardener, the central couple,
manage to remain elegant.</TE>
<TE>   The camera also captures the singers' strenuous efforts to project
in a big house, immortalizing their shouting lines, such as "At last,
we are alone." Their English, already marred by put-on accents to
reflect the characters' various national origins, on occasion is
obscure.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is Lehar's triumphant music. Yvonne Kenny as Anna,
the heroine of the piece, sings "Vilja" with melting lyricism. Bo
Skovhus, as the hero Danilo, breaks hearts with his version of the
song of the two royal children who loved but parted.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory Turay may not have the most glorious tenor, but he sings
Camille's love songs with persuasive ardor. Angelika Kirchschlager is
always vocally gorgeous as Valencienne. The waltzes, even under
conductor Erich Kunzel's bland hand, remain irresistible.</TE>
<TE>   But it's a long haul to get to these highlights.</TE>

<HD>'Survivor' makes it an easy win for CBS</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's no longer a phenomenon, but "Survivor" has turned into a very
dependable performer for CBS.</LD>
<LD>   The finale of "Survivor: Thailand," the game's fifth edition, drew
24 million viewers Thursday. The one-hour reunion that followed had
20 million people watching, making both shows the most popular of the
week, according to Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   That was less than half the 51 million people who saw Richard
Hatch win the first $1 million prize in August 2000. Judging from the
blistering comments by fellow contestants during the final tribal
council, used car salesman and sometime soft-core porn actor Brian
Heidik may be the show's most villainous champion since Hatch. The
final episode led CBS to an easy ratings win among all viewers and,
for the first time this season with the 18-to-49-old viewers most
advertisers seek.</LD>
<TE>   In all, CBS had the top four shows of the week, and seven of the
top 10, although the network mostly offered original episodes against
repeats on the other networks.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's "Providence," which may have aired its last original episode
last week, just missed the top 10 with 13.3 million viewers. NBC has
canceled the show, but its executives have admitted to
second-guessing that decision.</TE>
<TE>   A repeat "Friends" was NBC's most popular show, underscoring the
importance of the surprise deal last weekend to bring the show back
for 18 episodes next season. It finished in sixth position.</TE>
<TE>   The "Monday Night Football" contest between the New England
Patriots and Tennessee Titans was ABC's top-rated show of the week,
in fifth place.</TE>
<TE>   Among the special holiday-themed programs, CBS' repeat of the TV
Movie "A Town Without Christmas" fared best, ending up in 26th place.
ABC's "Wonderful World of Disney" movie "I'll Be Home for Christmas"
finished in 35th place.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, CBS averaged 12.7 million viewers (8.2 rating, 14
share). NBC had 9.2 million viewers (6.2, 10), ABC had 9.1 million
(5.9, 10), Fox had 6.4 million (4.0, 7), UPN had 3.8 million (2.3,
4), the WB had 3.4 million (2.1, 3) and Pax TV had 1.4 million (0.9,
2).</TE>
<TE>   "NBC Nightly News" won the evening news race, averaging 10.9
million viewers (7.6 rating, 15 share). ABC's "World News Tonight"
had 10.2 million viewers (7.1, 14) and "The CBS Evening News"
averaged 8.6 million (6.1, 12).</TE>
<TE>   A ratings point represents 1,067,000 households, or 1% of the
nation's estimated 106.7 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.</TE>

<HD>New Cadillac designs steer clear of the retro look</HD>
<DH>While paying homage to its heritage, the GM luxury brand is
looking deliberately ahead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rick Popely</AU>
<BD>Chicago Tribune</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cadillac celebrated its 100th birthday this year but is following a
design philosophy that focuses on the road ahead with only an
occasional glance in the rearview mirror.</LD>
<LD>   Starting with the 1999 Evoq concept, the luxury division of
General Motors Corp. adopted a bolder look highlighted by sharp edges
and creases.</LD>
<LD>   Those touches carry over to the CTS sedan and the SRX, a sport
utility vehicle that Cadillac plans to unveil next month at the North
American International Auto Show in Detroit.</LD>
<TE>   All three share design features from Cadillac's past, such as an
egg-crate grille and vertical taillights, but designer John "Kip"
Wasenko with General Motors describes such cues as "heritage, not
retro."</TE>
<TE>   Contemporary cars such as Volkswagen's New Beetle and Ford Motor
Co.'s Thunderbird often are labeled retro because they rely heavily
on their original designs.</TE>
<TE>   Wasenko says Cadillac rejected retro design as a short-term trend
and one that doesn't fit with plans to expand sales outside the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Europeans say this fascination with retro design seems to be an
American thing. Mercedes-Benz and BMW pay a lot of attention to their
heritage, but they are always advancing their design," he said.
"There's a fine line between retro and heritage, and heritage is more
looking toward the future. Heritage is where you've come from, your
lineage. Retro is a very literal interpretation of your past.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be respected for what we do in the future, not just
remembered for what we did in the past."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Hirshberg, retired head of Nissan Design International in La
Jolla, praises Cadillac for its refreshing look, but he doubts
whether most consumers will connect subtle styling touches to past
Cadillacs best known for size and fins.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a healthy change for Cadillac. But if you had shown [the
Evoq] to a group of people, would they have said, 'Oh, that's a
Cadillac' because of the grille and taillights?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure it's arousing anyone else. A lot of people don't get
excited about grille texture," Hirshberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Wasenko led the team that designed the Evoq, which launched
styling that Cadillac dubbed "art and science" and that he calls
"contemporary industrial design," an edgy look seen on the CTS and
other Cadillacs in the pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to establish a bold design statement that's more
recognizable -- establish more continuity in our lineup," Wasenko
said while in Chicago for a recent meeting of the Midwest Automotive
Media Assn. "All [of the new models] have their individual
personality, but they have a consistent theme we think is essential."</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, in the past we didn't have that," he added, citing
the Cadillac Catera. The car, sold from 1997 to 2001, was based on
the European Opel Omega and looked like an adopted member of the
Cadillac family.</TE>
<TE>   Wasenko, design director of GM's new performance division, said
the 2004 XLR roadster and the 2005 STS sedan, which has not been
shown to the public, would carry a design theme similar to those of
the CTS and SRX.</TE>
<TE>   "It will not be the same," he said, "but you'll see a further
evolution and refinement of the current design philosophy."</TE>

<HD>Big-city ambitions for little electric cars</HD>
<DH>Low-speed vehicles meant for running neighborhood errands
could find a place in the urban market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The major automakers may have abandoned the full-service,
battery-powered electric vehicle as they pursue development of
hydrogen-powered cars with fuel cells to produce electricity for
power. But battery power isn't completely gone.</LD>
<LD>   It's just that the full-service car or truck designed to carry
four or five people and move at freeway speeds for 80 to 100 miles or
more between charges has been replaced -- for now -- by the so-called
neighborhood electric vehicle, or NEV.</LD>
<LD>   By definition, an NEV is a low-speed electric vehicle that usually
looks like a slightly oversize golf cart and is limited to a top
speed of 25 mph.</LD>
<TE>   NEVs have two or four seats and are legal only on roads with
posted speed limits of 35 mph or less. They are legal in most states,
including California.</TE>
<TE>   Prices can run from $6,000 to $14,000.</TE>
<TE>   The vehicles seem to be creating an industry in which small
players can compete with giants such as General Motors Corp. and
DaimlerChrysler.</TE>
<TE>   At least that's what entrepreneurs such as Ian Clifford are
banking on. Clifford is founder and president of a Toronto-based
company, Feel Good Cars Inc., that has launched a line of
full-bodied, low-speed NEVs under the ZENN brand name. In this case,
"full-bodied" means they are vehicles with complete bodies, like
regular cars, with roofs and doors and power windows.</TE>
<TE>   Clifford has big plans for Feel Good and ZENN (it stands for Zero
Emission No Noise), including a city car capable of speeds of 40 mph
that would be fully certified under U.S. and Canadian automotive
crash safety standards. (NEVs don't have to meet those standards.)</TE>
<TE>   But back to the ZENN neighborhood car.</TE>
<TE>   Clifford figures that Feel Good can compete with GM and Chrysler
because they are selling cart-like vehicles, but the ZENN, at least
visually, is a small version of a regular car. Its composite body, in
fact, has been used in Europe for 15 years on so-called micro-cars
that use small motorcycle engines.</TE>
<TE>   Feel Good has not formally set pricing, but Clifford said it would
be about $14,000.</TE>
<TE>   The ZENN neighborhood electric also has locking doors, power
windows, air conditioning, a heater, a rear window defroster, a radio
with cassette and CD players and a rear cargo area accessible through
a van-like door. There's even remote keyless entry. The seats have
padded head restraints and a three-point safety belt system, and all
four wheels have disc brakes.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to look at what the others are marketing, and you can
see that there's a place for us," Clifford said this month at the
Electric Drive Transportation Assn. annual trade show in Hollywood,
Fla.</TE>
<TE>   "Our car is a car for the urban market," he said. "I've been
driving one in downtown Toronto for the past eight months, and we've
found that the average speed during business hours is 17 mph. The car
isn't at a disadvantage in that kind of slow traffic, and it is
small, agile and easy to park."</TE>
<TE>   Range on the ZENN neighborhood car is 30 to 40 miles, and its
lead-acid batteries recharge fully in six hours on regular 110-volt
household current.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Clifford said, he has not found Southern California to be
a receptive market. He figures that the car will win more acceptance
in urban centers such as Toronto, Chicago and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Feel Good, he said, can build as many as 10,000 cars a year.</TE>
<TE>   "For GM, that's a failure, but for us it's a $150-million
business, and a success," Clifford said.</TE>
<TE>   He expects to begin retail sales in March with 30 dealerships in
the U.S., mainly in the Sunbelt, although, he said, "our first signed
deal is with a car dealer on the outskirts of Detroit."</TE>
<TE>   Feel Good wasn't the only new NEV builder to show its wares at the
electric vehicle trade show: Rivals included ZAP, the Northern
California EV and electric scooter firm hoping for a post-Chapter 11
comeback; BigMan E.V. out of Edmond, Okla.; and Dynasty Electric Car
Corp. of Vancouver, Canada, which has reorganized after a round of
financial troubles.</TE>
<TE>   Of the Big Three, the only one to take NEVs to the Flori- da trade
show was DaimlerChrysler, which owns a company in North Dakota called
Global Electric Motorcars, or GEM, and is the only major automaker to
insist that there is a real market out there for the cars.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors, which canceled its full-size EV program last year
and has criticized NEVs as unsafe and unmarketable, does have a
contract with a Georgia golf cart maker, Club Car Corp., to supply it
with cart-like NEVs.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Motor Co. was building NEVs through its Think Mobility unit
but canceled the program in the summer, saying it could not find a
viable market. Ford had a big presence at the trade show but was
touting its forthcoming Escape gasoline-electric hybrid sport utility
vehicle and its research into fuel-cell vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   GM is getting around the issue of marketability by giving away its
NEVs to public and private entities through a one-year test program.</TE>
<TE>   GEM has a donation program as well but also sells its NEVs. In the
last year, in a program that since has ended, the company moved
several thousand models at steeply discounted prices -- the $5,995
two-seater went for $3,995 -- at Costco stores.</TE>
<TE>   GEM also has become the NEV supplier in several master-planned
communities and is developing a program to encourage people to use
them instead of gasoline-powered cars and trucks for short trips.</TE>
<TE>   NEVs are sold in California -- or given away -- in large part
because of the state's Zero Emission Vehicle, or ZEV, mandate, which
requires the biggest automakers to provide a certain number of
emission-free cars and trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Because of special provisions to encourage early introduction of
zero-emission vehicles before the mandate officially kicks in, the
NEVs introduced in the last year or so have earned multiple credits
as full-sized battery electrics. The result is that several of the
major automakers have been relieved of the need to build any other
ZEVs until 2007 or so.</TE>

<TE>   Look for a major beverage distribution company to start testing
all-electric intra-city delivery trucks in the Los Angeles area next
year.</TE>
<TE>   A big, red electric-powered tractor on display at the Elec- tric
Drive Transportation Assn. show in Florida was put together for the
unidentified company -- believed to be Coca-Cola Co. or
Anheuser-Busch Cos. -- by Advanced Vehicle Systems of Chattanooga,
Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   The tractor uses a drive system put together by Torrance-based
Enova Systems Inc. A 60-kilowatt turbine generator by Capstone
Turbine Corp. of Chatsworth provides juice for the electric motor.</TE>
<TE>   Because the turbine burns liquid natural gas, it is not an
emission-free vehicle, but Advanced Vehicle Systems says it is
cleaner than the new 2007 federal standards for diesel fuel -- which
is what such trucks usually run on.</TE>
<TE>   Besides having lower emissions, Enova President Carl Perry said,
the electric delivery truck is virtually silent, eliminating that
diesel clatter that reverberates through so many city streets.</TE>

<HD>Mazda rolls a 7 with the 6</HD>
<DH>The stylish new sports sedan leaves its predecessor, the
aged 626, in the dust</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While fans eagerly await the introduction of the rotary-engine RX-8
four-door sports car, Mazda Motor Corp. has introduced, with way too
little fanfare, a sports sedan that replaces its aged and creaky 626
with one of the best cars the Japanese automaker has ever made.</LD>
<LD>   It is called, simply, the Mazda 6, and it is, simply, a family
sedan for the enthusiast driver who feels no need to stop having fun
while hauling the brood to grandma's for Sunday dinner.</LD>
<LD>   Prices start at $19,050 for the base four-cylinder Mazda 6i and
$21,620 for the V-6-powered 6s. Loaded, the 220-horsepower V-6 model
tops out about $25,000.</LD>
<TE>   There are sport models in both versions that provide special
exterior trim, all-black interiors, 17-inch alloy wheels and a unique
instrument cluster.</TE>
<TE>   The sedan is the initial offering, but Mazda promises a wagon
version and a five-door hatchback next year.</TE>
<TE>   Though slightly smaller than the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and
Nissan Altima with which it will compete, the Mazda 6 is big enough
for four adults or a pair of grown-ups with three smaller folks
squeezed into the back seat. A redesigned rear suspension opens up
space in the trunk, which is bigger than the Accord's but smaller
than the Camry's.</TE>
<TE>   What little the new Mazda lacks in size it more than makes up for
in performance -- not just speed but handling, balance, steering,
braking and ride quality as well.</TE>
<TE>   Honda and Toyota are celebrated for reliability, and Nissan has
made a grab at being the import brand with more muscle per pound than
anyone else, so Mazda looked at sagging sales and thought, gee, we
were once good at making sporty, fun-to-drive cars -- maybe we should
go back to that.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of copying their rivals, Mazda engineers looked at cars
such as the Volkswagen Passat, BMW 3-Series and Audi A4 when they
started work on the 6.</TE>
<TE>   Mazda's predecessor 626 was nice looking with somewhat generic
Japanese sedan styling, but it suffered from too little power, mushy
suspension, too few amenities and uncomfortable seating.</TE>
<TE>   The new 6 drops a couple of digits from the name but adds
everything the 626 lacks.</TE>
<TE>   There are a few things to complain about: The manual shifter uses
a cable linkage rather than mechanical rods, and it seems to hesitate
for just a fraction of a second as you shift gears; the bright finish
on the plastic in the interior could be toned down; the
clunky-looking spoiler on the sport model ought to be an option; and
if the car were about 2 inches wider, the rear seats probably would
be big enough to warrant the three safety belts that are provided.</TE>
<TE>   But even the entry-level model is nicely furnished with goodies
that include 16-inch wheels; front bucket seats; split, folding rear
seats; air conditioning; rear heater ducts; illuminated vanity
mirrors; cruise control; tilting, telescoping steering column; power
door locks, windows and exterior mirrors; and a six-speaker stereo
with in-dash CD player and auxiliary controls on the steering wheel.</TE>
<TE>   A few words about those rear seats and the trunk: There's a lever
in the trunk that allows you to flip down the rear seats from back
there -- a feature every car with fold-down rear seats ought to
offer; and the trunk, even in the base model, is nicely lined with
hydraulic hinges that don't intrude into the cargo area. (You won't
find those features on Honda's base Accord model.)</TE>
<TE>   Power for the basic 6i comes from a 2.3-liter four-banger rated at
160 horsepower and 155 pound-feet of torque, the pulling power that
helps accelerate a vehicle's mass. The 6s with its V-6 engine is
rated at 220 horsepower and 192 pound-feet, enough to snap your head
back if you pound the accelerator to the floorboards. The engine is
tuned so that 90% of the torque is available at 1,750 rpm.</TE>
<TE>   A five-speed manual transmission is standard in both models, with
the 6i offering a four-speed automatic as an option and the 6s an
optional five-speed "automanual" that works in fully automatic mode
or as a clutch-less manual.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually no one achieves federal mileage standards, especially in
a car meant to be pushed hard. Still, the Environmental Protection
Agency's fuel economy estimates are worth noting: 25 miles per gallon
in city driving and 32 mpg on the highway for the 6i and 20 city, 27
highway, for the 6s. (You can subtract 1 mpg for the optional
automatic transmissions.)</TE>
<TE>   Both models have firm suspension tuning -- Mazda engineer Reuben
Archilla says the setup in U.S. models is identical to that on models
sold in Europe and Japan. The sport models provide bigger tires for a
better grip on the asphalt.</TE>
<TE>   The sport trim includes a body styling treatment with flared
lower-body skirts, a multi-scooped front fascia, fog lamps integrated
into the long, narrow headlamp array (apparently because it was
cheaper to make just one style of array, the regular models look as
if they have fog lamps, but the housing is empty) and a rear fascia
that adds to the ground-hugging look.</TE>
<TE>   On the road and on an autocross course set up by Mazda during the
media introduction this fall in Ventura, the 6 fulfilled every
promise made by the automaker's marketers.</TE>
<TE>   The car sticks to the road on the curves without tossing driver
and passengers all over the inside, accelerates powerfully on the
straights (especially with the throaty V-6 howling away) and stops
better than anything else in its class. Steering is firm and quick.
If the manual transmission were smoother, there would be almost
nothing to gripe about.</TE>
<TE>   Final words: At last, here's a real sports sedan for those who
don't have $40,000.</TE>

<HD>Staying on track with belt changes</HD>
<DH>Replacing timing belts at manufacturers' recommended
periods can prevent major engine damage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Vartabedian</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I have a 1997 Toyota Avalon with only 27,000 miles on it. I
took it to a dealer recently for the six-month oil change, and he
said I should have the timing belt replaced. He said the belt should
be changed every four years, as they wear out. I had it changed on
his advice but was wondering if what he said was true or meant to
drum up business?</LD>
<LD>   -- A.B.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Though what the dealer told you is not the policy
recommended by Toyota Motor Corp., it was generally good advice about
the importance of timing belts. Still, almost nobody recommends
changing them that often.</LD>
<TE>   Timing belts transfer power from the engine crankshaft to the
overhead camshaft, which opens and closes the cylinder valves. It's
important that a belt not slip, because that would throw off the
valve timing.</TE>
<TE>   If a timing belt slips or breaks, that can allow a valve to open
at the wrong time or stick in the open position. When that happens on
certain engines, including the 3.0-liter V-6 in your Avalon, the
piston can hit the valve at the top of the engine stroke. The impact
can damage or even destroy the piston, requiring a major engine
overhaul.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota recommends replacing the timing belt on your Avalon every
60,000 miles without respect to how many months the belt has been in
use, according to guidance provided by automotive publisher Alldata.</TE>
<TE>   For models produced from 1999 onward, Toyota advises replacing the
belts every 90,000 miles or 72 months. Toyota has never had a
recommendation to change belts on the 48-month cycle your dealer
suggested.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, it is possible to inspect a timing belt to determine
whether it should be replaced before the recommended time. The
procedure includes looking for general wear, cracked teeth, nicks on
the pulleys and improper pulley alignment.</TE>
<TE>   But your mechanic may charge nearly as much labor to do such an
inspection as to replace the belt outright.</TE>
<TE>   With your Avalon, the belt itself costs $43.85 and the recommended
labor is 2.7 hours, according to the Alldata rate book. At typical
labor rates of $60 to $100 an hour, you might as well have a new belt
put on if you face paying for even one hour of labor.</TE>
<TE>   In general, I think timing belts are poorly designed, though they
are cheap to produce. Few consumers will consider a timing belt
design in deciding whether to buy a car, so manufacturers don't
encounter much resistance in using them.</TE>
<TE>   Many engines use timing chains that do not need replacement and
seldom break. A few models even have gear-driven camshafts with
pushrods, a design generally considered an anachronism but remarkably
reliable.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why haven't automakers come up with a way to gauge whether a
battery is about to go dead? Is there any way to have a warning light
in the car?</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't seem right that something as small as a battery can
leave you stranded. Why don't owner manuals at least give you a time
frame for when a battery needs replacement? The manual of my 1997
Chevy Malibu is silent on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   -- D.E.</TE>
<TE>   A: Batteries die for many reasons -- such as overheating, sediment
in the cells, freezing and sulfation -- and building in sensors to
measure all of them would be impractical.</TE>
<TE>   Many batteries contain a view cell with a built-in hydrometer that
changes color from green to red or black when the battery is on its
last legs. But that only checks one of the six cells in a 12-volt
battery.</TE>
<TE>   A mechanic can perform several tests, such as measuring whether
the battery has a fully charged voltage of 12.66 volts and putting a
load on the battery to see how quickly the voltage bounces back
afterward.</TE>
<TE>   You can sometimes get a sense of when a battery is going out by
how well it cranks the engine on startup, though that's far from
reliable.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest cause of failure is sedimentation at the bottom of a
cell that creates an electrical bridge between two plates, shorting
out a cell, according to Interstate Batteries.</TE>
<TE>   As a general rule, batteries last about three years, though some
may function twice as long as that.</TE>
<TE>   A sure way to damage a battery is to allow it to go dead, as when
you leave your lights on, or let it sit uncharged for a long period.
If that happens, it is best to have it put on a battery recharger
rather than allow the car's charging to restore it.</TE>
<TE>   Batteries are not very expensive, and you can take the safe route
by just replacing it every three years.</TE>

<LD>In the Tuscan countryside, every farmhouse used to make a little vin
santo to offer guests. The "holy wine" is painstakingly derived from
Trebbiano and sometimes Malvasia grapes, dried on straw mats until
they are like raisins, then pressed and aged in small casks. The best
vin santos -- such as this one, from one of the top Chianti Classico
producers -- are among the greatest of Italy's dessert wines. Pour it
into a small glass: The amber wine clings to the sides like honey.
The scent is of hazelnuts and prunes. It is absolutely stunning.</LD>
<LD>   Drink it on its own after dinner, or with the classic
accompaniment, a plate of biscotti, but please don't dip -- this vin
santo is too fine for that. It comes in a 500-milliliter bottle
(two-thirds of a normal bottle), enough to pour a small glass for
everyone at the holiday table.</LD>

<HD>Champagne's little secret</HD>
<DH>This New Year's Eve, forget the big names. France's small
producers offer more bubble for the buck.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rod Smith</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>YOU can't go wrong with the big names in Champagne. The likes of
Veuve Clicquot or Pierrier-Jouet are what they are: expensive and
consistent. But, if like lots of wine drinkers in California, you're
not afraid of a little adventure and enjoy trying to identify a
terrific wine that nobody in the neighborhood has ever heard of, then
there's something you ought to know.</LD>
<LD>   Right there in France's Champagne region but worlds away from the
big producers are scores of family vintners whose Champagnes have
individual personality, representing their own villages rather than
the region as a whole. While Champagnes from famous large houses are
typically blended from a range of vineyards, these are made from
grapes from a single region, and sometimes, even a single vineyard.</LD>
<LD>   What's more, the wines tend to be better values. A good
grower-produced Brut costs $25 to $40 a bottle, around $25 less than
comparable wine from its better-known cousins. And while a tete de
cuvee from a large house can be $100 more than its next most
expensive wine, a grower's top bottling will generally cost only $10
or $15 more.</LD>
<TE>   The modest size of most growers' holdings, and the requirement
that 95% of their fruit come from their own vineyards or vines they
farm under lease, means that a typical grower's production is rarely
more than 100,000 bottles a year. By contrast, Perrier-Jouet produces
2.5 million. Moet &amp; Chandon, the largest Champagne company, produces
about 25 million bottles annually.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the front-rank grower-producers are in the charmed pendant
of Chardonnay-growing villages known as the Cote des Blancs. One of
the foremost is Pierre Gimonnet &amp; Fils.</TE>
<TE>   The Gimonnet family has been growing grapes in Champagne since
1750. They farm about 65 acres of vines in the villages of Cuisse,
Cramant and Chouilly. The current winemaker, Didier Gimonnet,
produces a minuscule 85,000 bottles a year. Among them is the
intensely limestone-inflected Fleuron, a prestige cuvee that competes
with more expensive bottlings in quality.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the Larmandier-Bernier family. It illustrates the
complexities of family ties and land ownership in Champagne: Pierre
Larmandier is Didier Gimonnet's cousin; the adjacent blocks of
80-year-old Chardonnay vines they each own in Cramant were originally
part of the same block owned by Phillipe Larmandier, Pierre's
grandfather. "Every year the vines split," says Pierre's wife,
Sophie, with a smile. She brought her own 18 ares (a bit less than
half an acre) of Chardonnay in Oger to their marriage. Their vines
are divided among five villages: Vertus, Cramant, Chouilly, Avize and
Oger.</TE>
<TE>   Among the eight Larmande-Vernier cuvees I tasted recently, I was
struck by the depth and intensity of the Ne d'une Terre de Vertus (a
French pun that loosely means "not a typical Vertus"), a Vertus
Chardonnay without added sugar. I also liked the high-toned
Chardonnay impressions of the Vielles Vignes de Cramant, Extra Brut.</TE>
<TE>   Henri-Pol Milan represents the fourth generation of his family to
grow Chardonnay and make wine in the terroir of Oger, the third
village from the top of the Cote des Blancs. Oger is tucked into the
lee of a promontory that shoulders much bad weather aside while also
creating a marginally warmer, more tranquil environment than that
enjoyed by vines to the north and south.</TE>
<TE>   The Milan family has about 15 acres of vines in numerous parcels
throughout Oger. Surrounding their house and winery are about three
acres of 40-year-old vines with the historical name Terre de Noel.
Wine from Terre de Noel is bottled separately in certain years, but
Henri-Pol Milan told me that they aren't necessarily the biggest and
most powerful vintages. "The purpose of a separate bottling is to
show something special in the terroir," he said. "So it wouldn't make
sense to have two vintages that are similar." The current vintage,
'95, is a beauty, so charming I described the first sip as "gently
coercive." It's lush without being soft -- there's steel behind all
that charm.</TE>
<TE>   Pierre Peters owns some 100 separate parcels totaling about 45
acres; most of his vines are in the Cote des Blanc, and most of those
are in the village of Mesnil. His wines come from the same grapes as
Milan's, grown much the same way, in virtually the same soils, but
they give practically the opposite impression: The Pierre Peters
Cuvee de Reserve Blanc de Blancs strikes, then gentles, as if looking
back at some glorious memory.</TE>
<TE>   A grape's throw from the Cote des Blancs, in Chigny-les-Roses, J.
Lassalle occupies a typical grower-producer complex incorporating a
family residence, a press-house and winery building and a cellar, all
around and beneath a walled courtyard. All of the family's 23 1/2
acres of vines are under four miles of the winery on Premier Cru
slopes of the Montagne de Reims. The house was founded by Jules
Lassalle and his wife in 1942; their daughter, Chantal
Decelle-Lassalle, has run the business since 1982.</TE>
<TE>   The J. Lassalle wines are remarkable: fresh, elegant and
high-toned in style, with hidden depths and complexities in exquisite
harmony. The J. Lassalle Imperial Preference Brut is typically one of
the finest Champagnes of any vintage, in flavor and style the very
essence of France -- and a great value at around $40, or $70 for a
festive magnum.</TE>
<TE>   A surprisingly short distance away from Champagne's Chardonnay
belt are sun-traps where Pinot Noir flourishes. The region's wine has
been valued for a long time, as one is reminded by such sights as the
seal of Francoise I (1515-47) carved into the wall of a cellar now
owned by the house of Gosset beneath the streets of Ay.</TE>
<TE>   That legacy survives most potently in the sensual Ay-grown wines
of Gosset-Brabant. The house produces about 40,000 bottles per year
of five Pinot Noir-based cuvees, and its Brut is a fine example of
Ay, sumptuous yet precisely etched and luscious through a long
finish. The '92 Cuvee Gabriel is a gracious odalisque on the palate,
with a treat in the finish: a radiance of cherry-candy Pinot Noir
that lingers like a kiss.</TE>
<TE>   The former shore of a Jurassic-era lake provides Champagne's most
dramatic Pinot Noir-based cuvees. The first words I wrote after
tasting the Egly-Ouriet Blanc de Noirs were, "savor of chalk." It
certainly wasn't the mineral intensity I've come to expect in
Chardonnay from Mesnil or Avize but more like a fine, dry undertone
to the Pinot Noir fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Bara is another outstanding producer in the Pinot Noir belt.
He has about 27 acres, all in Bouzy except for half a hectare in
Ambonnay. His father, Auguste, was one of the first growers to begin
making Champagne during the crisis of 1929, but his grandfather had
been making and selling Bouzy Rouge (a non-sparkling Pinot Noir) for
years before that. Young Paul took over from Auguste in 1952.</TE>
<TE>   The Paul Bara Brut Reserve is expressive. It's mostly Pinot Noir
but also has a significant portion of sumptuous Bouzy Chardonnay. "In
my view the Chardonnay isn't there to make good wine by itself," he
says. "The Pinot Noir brings structure, ripeness and flesh. On the
contrary, the Chardonnay is there to bring finesse, youth, an edge."</TE>
<TE>   In Champagne, it's all a matter of viewpoint. The big houses take
in the entire region, while the growers reveal its many
personalities.</TE>

<KH>THE CALIFORNIA COOK</KH>
<HD>Fabulous as always</HD>
<DH>Jeremiah Tower still has a thing or two to say about living
and eating well.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Russ Parsons</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeremiah Tower is back. Break out the Champagne and caviar
(preferably vintage Krug from the mid-'50s and only osetra or sevruga
-- but don't serve them together, the only thing to drink with caviar
is iced vodka and it must be served on blini made with so much butter
that the excess runs down your arm).</LD>
<LD>   Tower, one of the seminal chefs in the birth of modern California
cooking, has always been a man of flamboyant but precise tastes.
Sometimes they have gotten the best of him, but that has never made
him less interesting or entertaining.</LD>
<LD>   One of the founding chefs at Chez Panisse in the early '70s, Tower
went on to start Stars, his own blazingly popular San Francisco
restaurant, which at one point had expanded into a whole family of
places, including bakeries and fancy takeout as well as restaurants
in Singapore, Palo Alto and Oakville.</LD>
<TE>   His fall from grace was so dramatic as to border on parody. Done
in by a combination of bad economy, bad partnerships and bad habits,
two years ago this founding father -- a one-time James Beard
Foundation chef of the year, once the subject of glossy "Dewars
Profile" Scotch advertisements -- could be found running a
restaurant/disco in the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   Now he is living in New York, traveling and writing an occasional
food column for the tabloid San Francisco Examiner. And he has a new
cookbook out, "Jeremiah Tower Cooks," subtitled with typical modesty:
"250 Recipes From an American Master."</TE>
<TE>   For those who might have missed him the first time around, it is a
chance to get acquainted with one of the more remarkable characters
in American cooking.</TE>
<TE>   Though Tower was instrumental in establishing the Bay Area as one
of the world's premier food capitals, in a way he never really seemed
to fit in there. In an area where fine dining always seemed to come
weighed down with political earnestness, Tower's party flew only the
hedonist banner. Amid the stolid earth shoes of Berkeley, he was a
Victorian dandy in a velvet smoking jacket and tuxedo slippers.</TE>
<TE>   While everyone else was searching out the perfect organic lettuce,
he was putting together all-Sauternes menus and telling anyone who
would listen that the only wine to serve with roast beef was Chateau
d'Yquem. If he came up short on the social responsibility scale, the
party always seemed to be better at his place.</TE>
<TE>   In that way, perhaps he might have fit in better in Los Angeles,
where our most important chefs of the period -- Wolfgang Puck,
Michael McCarty, Michael Roberts, Michel Richard -- never seemed to
lose sight of the fact that good food is a celebration, not an
obligation, and that serious cooking doesn't necessarily mean serious
dining.</TE>
<TE>   Tower's new book is full of his trademark opinions and
provocations. Among the latter, those most sure to raise comment are
his claims to have been the American pioneer of everything from
mesclun salad to gourmet pizza. Maybe so. But even if not literally
true, it would be a shame if the occasional bit of hyperbole obscured
the book's deeper virtues.</TE>
<TE>   Primary among these is an acute, if prickly, common sense, whether
he's extolling the virtues of pressed caviar ("Its 'jammy' texture
and concentrated flavors cry out for potatoes, crumpets, or English
muffins") and canned sardines ("Eat them with horseradish, hot sauce
... or mayonnaise, but always with freshly grated onion") or weighing
in with delicious little epigrams:</TE>
<TE>   "Food should be beautiful, but it should look like food all the
same -- and taste the way it looks."</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it seems ... 'organic produce' just means that the
vegetables are unwashed and unrefrigerated. Like 'fresh,' the use of
the word 'organic' is fraught with the peril of rushing to embrace a
good concept without taking into consideration the result it is meant
to produce."</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, there are Tower's trademark tales of culinary
fabulousness: wild strawberries soaked in old Burgundy, a white
truffle feast at Harry's Bar in Venice, sea urchin souffles that he
says James Beard proclaimed "the best thing I have ever tasted."</TE>
<TE>   It must be pointed out that some of "Jeremiah Tower Cooks" will be
familiar to those who read his first book, "Jeremiah Tower's New
American Classics," published in 1986 and long out of print. A few of
the stories and several recipes are repeated. Still, it would be
ungenerous to fault him too much for this, any more than we'd
criticize an old friend for repeating himself from time to time --
especially when the stories (and the food) were so good to begin
with.</TE>
<TE>   And, in truth, the recipe selection in that first book was a
little more balanced. "Cooks" leans pretty hard on luxury ingredients
and multi-step restaurant preparations. But as long as you don't feel
too bound by the garnishes, that's not insurmountable. This velvety
parsnip soup, for example, was supposed to be finished with shaved
white truffles. Not on a Wednesday night at my house. Instead, I
simply used a swirl of sour cream and it was delicious. It would also
be great -- and a little dressier -- if you deep-fried some of the
parsnip scrapings and floated those on top.</TE>
<TE>   Was it Auntie Mame who said, "Life is a banquet and most poor
suckers are starving to death"?</TE>
<TE>   Not around Jeremiah Tower, they're not.</TE>

<TE>   Cream of parsnip soup</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 4</TE>
<TE>   Note: In Tower's original recipe, he finishes the soup with shaved
white truffles. Use them if you have them, but this variation with
sour cream is delicious, too. Adapted from "Jeremiah Tower Cooks"
(Stewart Tabori &amp; Chang, $35).</TE>
<TE>   1 pound parsnips</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon butter</TE>
<TE>   1 onion, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 boiling potato, peeled and diced</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   3 cups water or vegetable stock, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 sprig tarragon</TE>
<TE>   1 sprig parsley</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup sour cream</TE>
<TE>   1. Working lightly, peel the parsnips and cut off the bottoms and
tops. Continuing to use the vegetable peeler, cut away and save the
rest of the parsnip down to its woody core, catching the thin slices
in a wide soup pot. The color of the vegetable will change from
creamy white to ivory when you get to the core. Discard the cores.</TE>
<TE>   2. Add the butter, onion, potato and salt to the parsnip in the
soup pot along with one-third to one-half cup of the water. Place the
pot over low to medium-low heat, cover it tightly and cook slowly,
"sweating" the vegetables until they begin to become tender, about 20
to 25 minutes. Stir from time to time to keep the vegetables from
sticking and scorching.</TE>
<TE>   3. Add the tarragon and parsley and continue to sweat the
vegetables another 5 minutes. Add the remainder of the water,
increase the heat to medium and cook uncovered until the vegetables
are completely tender, about 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   4. Remove the tarragon and parsley sprigs and, using a slotted
spoon, transfer as much as you can of the solids from the soup pot
into a blender. With the lid of the blender removed (cover the top
with a paper towel), pulse the blender to chop the vegetables. If
necessary, add a little water or cooking broth. After the vegetables
are chopped, turn the blender on the lowest speed and gradually work
your way up to the highest. When you start pureeing the vegetables,
they'll jump up the sides but then they'll subside and remain at much
the same level no matter the speed of the blender. With the motor
running, add the rest of the liquid and any vegetables left over and
puree until completely smooth.</TE>
<TE>   5. Wipe out the pot to remove any bits of vegetable and then pour
the pureed soup back into it. Heat through over low heat and taste
and correct the salt.</TE>
<TE>   6. Beat the sour cream with a spoon to soften it. Divide the soup
among 4 warmed soup bowls and dribble in a bit of sour cream in a
decorative pattern.</TE>

<HD>Straight up, with a dash of vitamin B</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Valli Herman-Cohen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>THE art of mixing cocktails is looking a little more like science --
weird science. The young, trendy and health-attuned have quietly
started blending energy drinks into their martinis and more.</LD>
<LD>   At fashionable parties and clubs in Los Angeles and New York,
liquor companies have joined hands with makers of fortified beverages
to further lift the spirits of the spirits business. Their
inspiration: the runaway success of the high-caffeine drink Red Bull
as a cocktail mixer over the past few years among the late-night set.</LD>
<LD>   Now cocktail menus are featuring drinks that combine the numbing
effects of alcohol with the revitalizing properties of typical
sports-drink ingredients such as taurine, vitamins and yerba mate.
Among the 20 exotic martinis served at Mirabelle in West Hollywood is
the Dragonfruit Vitaminwater Martini -- a concoction of vodka,
pineapple juice and the lightly fruity water made by Glaceau and
fortified with taurine, an amino acid. In Los Feliz, the bar at
Vermont restaurant keeps a supply of Rescue Green Tea Vitaminwater
handy for the Rescue Martini, a blend of vodka and the water's B
vitamins, rosehips, chamomile and hibiscus.</LD>
<TE>   Though Vitaminwater founder J. Darius Bikoff has personally placed
samples of his nutrient-enhanced waters in the hands of bar owners,
hoping to jump-start the trend, as often, the "energy cocktails" have
emerged on their own as a kind of cult item among fashion
trendsetters.</TE>
<TE>   After spotting the peach flavor called Endurance in a corner
grocery, Melissa Lemer, a partner with Cabana, a public relations
firm, became "a hard-core Vitaminwater drinker." Now she stocks the
nutrient drinks at her company's functions, such as the recent
"Beauty Buffet," a daylong promotion in which new products are
introduced to L.A.'s fashion insiders. Without prompting, Lemer said,
guests began mixing "Vitamin Vodkas" -- essentially, spiking their
Vitaminwater.</TE>
<TE>   "People who wanted to stay sober could drink them straight and
people who wanted a cocktail could mix it," Lemer said. "They even
put some in champagne."</TE>
<TE>   Though Vitaminwater comes in such formulas as Energy Tropical
Citrus and Endurance Peach, Bikoff said he's not promoting the drinks
as either nutritional supplements or as cocktail mixers, but as
low-calorie, nutrient-enhanced beverages.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't make any health claims," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the case, he's clearly on to something: This month, an
Idaho distiller introduced a potato vodka enhanced with sports drink
ingredients. It's called Zygo, and it's jazzed up with peach,
mandarin orange and vanilla, as well as the amino acid taurine,
d-ribose (a sugar) and two stimulants: guarana and yerba mate.</TE>
<TE>   Centro-Fly, a New York bar, is already mixing a Zygo Fly (with
Cointreau, grapefruit juice and soda) and a Zygo to Heaven (with
orange juice). The vodka itself has a syrupy, peachy flavor with a
distinctly medicinal background, not unlike a chewable children's
vitamin. Luis Barajas, founder of the avant-garde fashion magazine
Flaunt, likened it to "an energy drink mixed with vodka."</TE>
<TE>   The vodka's supplements have more often been used to help athletes
finish marathons, but now, they've become handy caffeine replacements
for nights, very late nights, of marathon partying.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about being able to sustain your evening," said Ron Zier of
Zygo Distillers. "It's about being able to make the after-after
party."</TE>
<TE>   Ads for Zygo call the enhanced vodka a "morning vodka." To the
dance-until-dawn drinkers, "morning" means after midnight, not
sunrise.</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining party stamina is tough in California, where
cigarettes, and their nerve-jangling nicotine blast, are relics of
the bar scene. In New York City, where bars stay open until 4 a.m.,
the party goes on that much longer.</TE>
<TE>   "People are trying to figure out a way to keep themselves up at
night without going any farther," Barajas said. "So energy drinks are
what they are doing."</TE>
<TE>   Barajas recently served Zygo vodka at a New York party for Robert
Downey Jr. The party, perhaps predictably, went late.</TE>
<TE>   Barajas noticed that party-goers drank more and longer, exactly as
the creators had hoped. The tagline on Zygo's trade brochures reads,
"Wake up and smell the profits."</TE>
<TE>   Just because the drinks contain "healthy" ingredients doesn't make
them healthier. For example, Susan Bowerman, assistant director for
the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition, said she worried that the
stimulants could mask the effects of the alcohol and delay the cue to
stop drinking.</TE>
<TE>   As far as the other added ingredients, "the amount of vitamins in
these drinks is negligible," she said. "They might make people think
that they are doing themselves some good by replacing some of the
vitamins that are needed to metabolize the alcohol -- B vitamins in
particular. But, since these waters provide such a small percentage
of the RDA, and since B vitamins are quite widespread in the food
supply, there is no nutritional advantage."</TE>
<TE>   Sports drinks often have a relatively low sugar content, which can
raise the rate the stomach empties and fluids are absorbed. In other
words, you might just soak up that alcohol faster and get drunk
easier with a sports tonic in your cocktail.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's why the combination is so alluring. In fact, in the
not so distant past, Gator Drivers were the intoxicating beverage of
choice for the hearty, especially skiers. They'd load up the trunk
with partially emptied Gatorade bottles, add vodka, and let the
bottles freeze to slush on the way to local ski resorts.</TE>
<TE>   In the morning, recalled one Gator Driver fan, "We skied pretty
good." Or perhaps, they just thought they did.</TE>

<KH>COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: JAPAN AND KOREA</KH>
<HD>Where East meets East: a hot fusion at your table</HD>
<DH>At Jin Sang, shabu-shabu is the specialty, and the watched
pot always boils.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Hansen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jin Sang is a serene room, all in minimalist shades of black and
gray. Never mind that a caldron will soon boil vigorously in the
center of your table.</LD>
<LD>   The caldron is for shabu-shabu: meat or seafood dropped with
vegetables into boiling liquid, then drained and dipped in sauces.
The sumptuous broth remaining in the caldron is the climax of the
meal.</LD>
<LD>   Shabu-shabu is the specialty at Jin Sang, part of a Korean chain
with several branches in Seoul, one in Japan and one in La Jolla.
Though much of the food is Japanese -- and some is Western-influenced
-- the restaurant has a strong Korean accent. (Koreans are so fond of
Japanese cuisine that sushi bars have found their way into barbecue
restaurants.)</LD>
<TE>   But instead of grilled meats or raw fish, shabu-shabu is the hit
here. And to confuse the issue a bit more, the hot pot -- although
popular in Japan -- originated with the Mongol warrior Genghis Khan
in the 13th century (or so the menu says).</TE>
<TE>   A waitress starts the pot boiling over a burner set into the
table. She adds ingredients and fishes them out when done. You can do
this yourself, but it's nice to be pampered.</TE>
<TE>   For beef shabu-shabu you can specify Choice, Prime or Kobe. The
famous Japanese Kobe beef is three times as expensive as choice. (Is
it worth it? To my mind, only if you can distinguish between grades
of wrinkly boiled meat.) The seafood shabu-shabu choices include
squid, salmon, shrimp and scallops.</TE>
<TE>   The vegetables are ssukkat (chrysanthemum greens), bok choy, nappa
cabbage, green onions and mushrooms. Tofu and a dumpling or two may
go into the pot. When everything has been cooked, the waitress mixes
kimchi, hot chile and garlic with the liquid to create a broth for
wonderfully chewy noodles and rice cakes.</TE>
<TE>   Even sukiyaki (a Japanese beef and vegetable hot pot) has a Korean
twist. Cooked at the table, it ends Korean-style with a thick
porridge of rice mixed with the broth left in the pot and gently
enhanced with egg, seaweed, green onion, sesame and garlic. Sangchu
ssam shabu, sliced beef to be boiled and wrapped in lettuce, is
served along with a hot sauce and rice and shredded egg pancake.</TE>
<TE>   Side dishes hold pickles and a tiny wad of kimchi, which Koreans
demand even with Japanese food. All kimchi is spicy, but Jin Sang's
stands out for bold flavor that brings horseradish to mind. Jin Sang
has an intriguing menu of appetizers. They include a predictable
smoked salmon platter, but the Sicilian special salmon salad is a
shock: lettuce tossed with smoked salmon, stuffed olives, capers and
onions in Italian dressing, surrounded by guess what? Doritos nacho
cheese chips!</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific fajita is fusion-style Korean kujolpan: crumbled beef,
shredded kelp, onion and carrots, eaten with small pancakes along
with a sauce that resembles salad dressing. Jin Sang's "carpaccio
(tataki)" is paper-thin slices of Prime beef, lightly browned at the
edges but very rare in the middle, topped with a slice of fried
garlic and a speck of horseradish. Kimchi ball is shrimp, tuna,
vegetables and kimchi wrapped in a pickled nappa cabbage leaf.</TE>
<TE>   With this attention to appetizers, it's no surprise the restaurant
has a weekday-afternoon happy hour. The bar list tops out at $250 for
a bottle of Johnny Walker Blue Label, but my drink of choice would be
the lemon sour made with soju, a Korean alcoholic beverage distilled
from sweet potatoes; tonic; and lemon juice in an iced mug. It's as
refreshing and cool as this stylish restaurant.</TE>

<HD>Saucy little party tidbit</HD>
<DH>A fresh oyster, a dash of lemon-flavored vodka -- no guest
will be able to stop at just one shooter. Best of all, the flavorful
hors d'oeuvres are quite simple to prepare.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Every party needs that one dish that adds the spark, that draws the
"oohs and aahs" the minute it's set on the table. These oyster
shooters are that dish.</LD>
<LD>   And -- guess what? They're easy to prepare, not to mention hugely
festive.</LD>
<LD>   Set amid ice in a silver bucket, the individual shooters
practically glow. They'll pull in guests like a magnet, since it
seems everybody is always up for a shooter of some kind.</LD>
<TE>   On the front side, of course, you'll be happy too, especially if
you buy oysters that are already shucked. No need to mess with
shells. (Fresh are wonderful too.)</TE>
<TE>   The sauce is quite simple to prepare -- just a little mincing of a
shallot, some chives and cilantro. By soaking the shallot in the
vinegar, the shooters will lose any sharp oniony edge.</TE>
<TE>   Since vodka and oysters go well together, we took a step further
and opted for a lemon-flavored vodka. Even those who might be
oyster-shy won't refuse one of these; the flavor of vodka and the
sauce really stand out.</TE>
<TE>   Either bring the shooters out with a little fanfare mid-party, or
get them on the table as guests arrive; they won't upstage your other
offerings, but only make the table more exciting. Fun, festive, easy?
What more could you want?</TE>

<HD>Let's get real</HD>
<DH>The party pros have filled bookshelves with glossy
impossibility. Don't buy into it. Here's how to have your party and
enjoy it too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Regina Schrambling</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SOMEWHERE along the line, book publishers apparently decided that
entertaining is like sex. It needs a manual.</LD>
<LD>   This season, they have produced quite a few, each more
fantasy-filled than the next. And while even the most experienced
drink mixer and canape maker can always use a new technique, these
new soft-focus entertaining books actually seem designed to dampen
any desire to ever give a party.</LD>
<LD>   Do you really need a bar stocked with every proof, color and
flavor of alcohol, let alone six styles of glassware and 14
garnishes? Does the menu have to include such hors d'oeuvres as
chawan-mushi eggs (Japanese custard served in a shell sliced off with
a special "egg topper")? Can you really not decorate a table without
using more candles than St. Peter's?</LD>
<TE>   I know my way around the punch bowl, but in planning my New Year's
party, I was seriously intimidated after flipping through such slick
books as "Cocktail Parties With a Twist" and "Dinner After Dark" and
even the seemingly inviting "At Home With Friends." Each is filled
with page after page of either too-gorgeous-to-be-real food or
too-happy-to-be-normal skinny people brandishing drinks and forks and
having the camera-loving kind of fun you never see at real parties.
These books set the limbo bar pretty high.</TE>
<TE>   So, after poring over all the latest advice from the pros, I have
happily gone back to a game plan developed over many amateur hours on
New Year's. It's worked for as few as 12 guests and as many as 125.
It's worked when I was caged in a life-consuming job and when I was
footloose and pension-free, freelancing with all the time in the
world to plan and shop and cook. And mostly it's worked because I've
done what felt right for me. None of the professional hosts in the
glossy books ever lets on that you can have a fine time with wine
only, or with one designated drink, like the Swedish glogg that my
consort and I have appropriated as our liquid welcome to the new
year. Or that you can dazzle guests with really simple food, whether
an artisanal ham or a big bowl of black-eyed peas, as long as there
is meaning behind it.</TE>
<TE>   Even the books that repeat "keep it simple" like a mantra
contradict themselves with photos and recipes and lists -- like the
one for "what every home bar should have" that insists on a muddler
to bruise the mint for mojitos. The only acquisitions you should have
to make should be dish-specific: a tall stockpot to simmer the glogg,
say, or heavy-duty foil for covering that ham as it heats.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, while book hosts all insist that you plan ahead, their
recipes inevitably end with the same instruction: "Serve
immediately." What host can stand facing the stove all through the
party, shuffling sheet pans in and out of the oven?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Not me.</TE>
<TE>   From my very first serious New Year's party, in 1984, I have been
convinced that the last line in the very best recipes is: "store up
to three days." Any cooking done in advance is like reassurance in
the bank.</TE>
<TE>   I used to spend a week assembling only appetizers to avoid having
to deal with silverware. Everything was chosen because it could be
made in party quantities with minimal effort and would hold up until
the doorbell rang. Life got simpler once I developed more of a
three-course menu: a few finger foods to get things going, a big
centerpiece such as ham with some side salads, and one or two
sliceable desserts such as cake or pie along with several plates of
cookies. Bars are best: One big pan yields 36.</TE>
<TE>   I've always given my New Year's party on the day, not the eve.
(For some reason, guests seem to remember afternoon parties better,
plus it leaves me free to see the fireworks at midnight.) But the
menu would fit either time slot. Anyone who comes intending to stick
around until the ball drops will go away satisfied without a sit-down
dinner, and anyone stopping by an open house the next afternoon could
fill up on a plate of food or just a few cookies on the way to the
movies.</TE>
<TE>   Because alcohol rears its potent head no matter what time of day
it is between Dec. 31 and Jan. 2, I always think rich. The New Year's
Eve menu outlined in one new book might be over the top -- caviar,
lobster bisque, salmon, cheesy spinach dumplings with cream sauce,
strawberry cheesecake and, apparently, gout -- but this is not an
occasion for light eating.</TE>
<TE>   You could just set out a big cheese tray, but I think that's
cheating. Cheddar should be transformed, not just sliced. Mix it into
a dough with jalapenos and pimentos and you can make crisp little
wafers that are like cheese straws without the breakage. Melt it with
equal parts mayonnaise and chopped Vidalia onion and you get a
sensational hot dip for chips.</TE>
<TE>   For all my aversion to store-bought party food, I have taken to
investing in a seriously great ham to hold down the buffet table,
partly because it buys me time to concentrate on the other dishes but
mostly because no one but our vegan friends can resist it. For them,
there are other choices alongside the offending meat, usually salads
or oversize savory tarts cut into squares or a meaty-tasting bean
salad. Ham is also good because people will eat it any way they can:
standing up or sitting down, by the slice with their fingers, on
bread with mustard or just in little chunks off toothpicks. (Gravlax
or a side of smoked salmon is almost as good.)</TE>
<TE>   However, my favorite food is anything you can eat with no forks,
which is why I'm also partial to such two-bite ideas as red pepper
wedges baked under a chunky garlicky blend of capers, olives and
anchovies, or slivers of a classic Spanish tortilla, thick with
potatoes and onions and rich with olive oil.</TE>
<TE>   And because the theme of my party is always good luck for the New
Year, I make anything I can with black-eyed peas: salad, or a bean
spread with pancetta and artichokes or, especially, Texas "caviar,"
with the peas marinated with chiles, cilantro and scallions. The
chiles are usually jalapenos, but chipotles add more heat along with
a smokier flavor. The longer the black-eyed peas sit in the
refrigerator and the seasonings, the better they get. You can eat
them daintily with a fork or messily like a salsa, on rounded corn
chips.</TE>
<TE>   We set out most of this food on our dining room table but scatter
things like the Cheddar wafers around the living room and in the
kitchen near the stove with the glogg to keep people moving and
eating. My usual aim is to have it all waiting, rather than wasting
the first hour of the party sweating over a hot sheet pan. Parties
are always more fun if I get to attend.</TE>
<TE>   Next Wednesday, the food is going on paper plates, with our best
plastic flatware. (I will happily spend a week cooking but not more
than a couple of hours cleaning.) The glogg will be ladled into Greek
diner-style "We Are Happy to Serve You" paper mugs from a restaurant
supply house (the ultimate combination of disposability and
conversation piece). The lighting will be by nature, the music by
whoever hits the CD player first.</TE>
<TE>   And while there will be a photographer, he's the host and will be
focusing only on the drinks.</TE>

up.</TE>
<TE>   2. Stir together the olives, garlic, parsley, anchovies, capers,
tomatoes and pepper flakes in a small bowl. Season with pepper to
taste. Add more of any ingredient to taste; if mixture is too dry,
add a bit more chopped tomato.</TE>
<TE>   3. Spoon a little of the mixture into each pepper wedge. Drizzle

<TE>   Total time: 30 minutes, plus 8 hours marinating</TE>
<TE>   Servings: About 12</TE>
<TE>   Note: This works best with frozen black-eyed peas rather than
canned or dried. It's also free-form: Add more or less of any
ingredient. Serve with corn chips.</TE>

<TE>   2. Whisk together the oil, lime juice and vinegar in a small bowl.
Pour over the peas and toss to coat. Chop the chiles and add them to
the peas with their sauce to taste. Season with salt and pepper.
Cover and marinate overnight or up to three days before serving. Stir
peas as they marinate, and stir before serving.</TE>

<TE>   Jalapeno-Cheddar wafers</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 30</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, at room temperature</TE>
<TE>   2 cups finely grated extra-sharp Cheddar cheese, at room

<TE>   1 cup flour, plus extra for dusting fork</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   2. Cream the butter and cheese together in a mixing bowl with a
wooden spoon until thoroughly blended. Blend in the jalapenos,
pimento, mustard, salt and Worcestershire sauce. Mix well. Add the
flour and stir to make a stiff dough.</TE>
<TE>   3. Roll into 2 (15-inch) logs. Cut into 1-inch pieces for a total
of 30. (This step ensures the wafers will all be about the same
size.) Roll each piece into a smooth ball. Arrange on baking sheets
and flatten in a crisscross pattern with a fork dipped in flour. Bake
until lightly browned, 20 minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature.</TE>

<TE>   Tortilla de papas</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 hour, 10 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 12-16</TE>
<TE>   Note: This recipe is adapted from "The Art of South American
Cooking" by Felipe Rojas-Lombardi (HarperCollins, 1991). Tightly
covered, the tortilla will keep for up to a week in the refrigerator.</TE>
<TE>   3 1/2pounds Yukon Gold or Russet potatoes, peeled</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon Spanish extra-virgin olive oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon coarse sea salt</TE>
<TE>   1 large onion, very thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   8 eggs</TE>
<TE>   1. Cut the potatoes into quarters, then into thin slices. Heat 1/2
cup of the oil in a very large skillet (about 14 inches) over medium
heat. Add the potatoes and cook, covered, turning with a spatula
occasionally until they are half-done, stirring occasionally, 10 to
15 minutes. Add the salt and onion and continue cooking, uncovered,
until the onion slices are wilted and the potatoes are tender but not
collapsing, stirring occasionally, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the
skillet from the heat and transfer the mixture to a large bowl to
cool slightly. Some of the vegetables may stick to the pan; do not
scrape them off.</TE>
<TE>   2. In a second bowl, beat the eggs. Pour over the potatoes and
thoroughly fold in. Heat the oven to 375 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   3. Heat a 10-inch nonstick oven-safe skillet briefly over high
heat. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil and continue to heat,
almost to the point of smoking. Carefully swirl the pan to coat the
bottom and sides with oil. Pour the potato mixture in, smoothing out
the top, and leave over high heat for 1 to 2 minutes to sear the
bottom. Lower the heat as much as possible and let cook, uncovered,
until the potato mixture has set fairly well but the center is still
wet, about 10 to 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   4. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the center of
the tortilla is completely set and feels firm to the touch, 10 to 15
minutes longer. Carefully slide out of the skillet onto a plate, then
invert onto a second serving plate so that the crusty bottom is on
top. Serve hot or at room temperature, in skinny slices.</TE>

<DH>Peppery-sweet, the hardy nasturtium is a beauty to behold
too.</DH>

<LD>THE nasturtium isn't native to California, but it has adapted so
well, it's time we took out adoption papers. It has the poppy's
quirky mix of toughness and grace. It's got a bewitching fragrance
and a "Wizard of Oz" color scheme. The flowers run from cream to
scarlet, the leaves from emerald green to lime to variegated. Some
flop, others climb, but all are somehow touchingly comical. Best of
all, it's delicious.</LD>
<LD>   Ah, and indecently vigorous. Nasturtiums only look delicate. They
will grow faster than you and the slugs eat them. They appear after
winter rains in even the most marginal soils. The shield-like leaves
that give them their botanical name, Tropaeolum majus, make them
superb ground cover and help conserve water. But underneath the soil
line, they do not sprout fierce root systems.</LD>
<LD>   In Southern California's temperate zones, they bloom from late
winter until early summer, after which they burn off only to reappear
after the first winter rains. If you planted nasturtiums in the past,
you've probably got some seedlings appearing right now. They are good
self-seeders. If you didn't, now is the time to invest in a packet of
seeds. Few flowers are easier to grow, no flower is more gratifying.
Just push the caper-sized seeds an inch under the soil, and let it
rain. Easier than a Chia Pet.</LD>
<TE>   Books say that they tend to attract aphids, so evidently some
kitchen gardeners use them as insect bait near their vegetable
patches. To my mind, they look loveliest planted at the base of
larger shrubs, along garden paths. By early spring, they will be
spilling over walkways like something out of a Monet painting.</TE>
<TE>   Pleasing to the senses</TE>
<TE>   For all their beauty, their most profound charm is scent. As dew
burns off in midmorning sun, they smell like honey and spice. If the
family dog gets in the nasturtiums, you'll know. It will come back
smelling like a meadow. But as the realization dawns that your
smiling beast has been trampling the flower bed, don't worry. The
next day the nasturtiums will have recovered and the flowers lining
the path will be frilly, voluptuous and again emitting that smell.</TE>
<TE>   What's behind it? Much the same thing behind the flavor, it seems.
Nasturtium leaves have alkaloids similar to those found in mustard,
arugula or watercress. The leaves are also edible, and when young and
tender so good that one of their alternate names is "Indian cress."</TE>
<TE>   The nasturtium's dominant alkaloid is called benzyl
isothiocyanate, a compound with strong medicinal properties. Because
of that, says Robert J. Griesbach, a research geneticist in the
Beltsville offices of the U.S. National Arboretum, you shouldn't eat
loads of them. Remember, they're a garnish and not a salad leaf.
Griesbach also warns against eating flowers bought from garden
centers or florists, which will probably have been treated with
pesticides.</TE>
<TE>   James Duke, a botanist employed for many years by the Agricultural
Research Service, studied the plant for the U.S. government as a
potential cancer medicine. He is now continuing the study at his
Green Farmacy Garden in Fulton, Maryland. This positive oracle can
give you the name in dozens of languages (The Dutch name is
"Oost-Indische Kers" and Spanish one "Taco de Reina.") Ask its
chemical content, and he'll respond with a list of more than 70
compounds, from antheraxanthin to water.</TE>
<TE>   But what about that honeyed smell on the dog?</TE>
<TE>   "It's the nectar," says Warren Roberts, director of the UC Davis
Arboretum. "It's in the flowers, but not the leaves. Nasturtium
flowers are pollinated by hummingbirds. There is nectar in the spurs.
So if you eat the flower, you get some nectar as well as the
spiciness of the petals."</TE>
<TE>   Nasturtium flowers, Roberts explains, are still peppery, but
milder-tasting than the leaves, nature's version of the perfect
honey-mustard dressing. Roberts once lived in the Andes, where
nasturtiums are native. There he's seen them climb up cornstalks in
mountain fields and thick tubered varieties sold as vegetables in
food markets.</TE>
<TE>   But here, outside batty food fads in which flowers are suddenly
fried, candied, brined and tossed into everything from the cocktail
to the sorbet, all for one dizzyingly floral meal, we don't eat
garden flowers much. In the case of the nasturtium, Roberts guesses
that this is because it came to us, via Europe, as an ornamental. The
fact that the pretty flower was also a food got lost in translation.</TE>
<TE>   The fresher, the better</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the nasturtium, it was also never commercialized as
a food because it is so perishable. The best way to eat the flowers
is straight from one's garden, so you know no pesticides have been
used and the flower is fresh and fragrant. Washing will damage them.
Just pick high, bright, clean specimens. It's hard to beat tossing
them in a salad for bright peppery-sweet notes. They can function
wherever arugula or watercress would, except more brightly. They're
great garnishes for cream cheese, meat or pasta, provided people can
bring themselves to give them the coup de grace. Rosalind Creasy, the
Bay Area garden writer, dices them like a herb and uses them like,
say, chopped chives.</TE>
<TE>   One of the nicest ways Roberts has seen nasturtium flowers served
was in England, in a watercress-style sandwich. This is a
particularly English good idea, involving perfect white bread, cut in
triangles with the crust trimmed, and the bread itself generously
spread with salty butter, then the flower sandwiched between two
pieces. Of course, it demands a perfect cup of tea.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson from Roberts: A plant's beauty isn't necessarily how it
looks -- it's how it tastes. We'd eat nasturtiums more often here, he
thinks, "if our tongues had eyes."</TE>

<KH>MATTERS OF TASTE / DAVID SHAW</KH>
<HD>Why indulge? It's our pleasure</HD>
<DH>Good food, wine and cigars deserve a full afternoon's
attention -- at the very least.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Shaw</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IT began almost a decade ago, as a lark. Well, not a lark exactly --
more a collective thumbing of our noses at what I think of as the
"pleasure police." Diet nazis. Tobacco tyrants. Neo-Prohibitionists.
Neo-Puritans. The kind of killjoys Mencken had in mind when he spoke
of those burdened with "the haunting fear that someone, somewhere,
may be happy."</LD>
<LD>   For any number of reasons -- from religious training to toilet
training, overbearing parents to an overweaning social conscience --
these folks are incapable of having any fun themselves so they resent
anyone else having any fun, of any kind.</LD>
<LD>   To protest both this mind-set and the work, work, work, rush,
rush, rush mentality that I felt taking hold everywhere, I began
inviting a small group of friends to meet every three or four months
at one of the better restaurants in town to spend an entire Friday
afternoon in sybaritic self-indulgence. The group would vary slightly
from lunch to lunch but the format was constant: Noon start. A dozen
bottles of wine, all from either the same year or the same grape. A
six-course menu created for us by the chef and ending with his
richest, most cholesterol-laden cheeses and desserts. Then, cigars
and talk until 6 o'clock or so.</LD>
<TE>   We had great fun, great food, great wine and great Cuban cigars.
But over time, the pleasure police struck anew, and it became
virtually impossible (indeed, illegal) to smoke cigars in
restaurants. Around the same time, various members of my group --
myself included, to my embarrassment -- found it increasingly
difficult to take three or four afternoons a year off work. The
lunches gradually disappeared. Except for one.</TE>
<TE>   I refused to give up my annual Barolo/white truffle/cigar lunch.</TE>
<TE>   After red Burgundy, Barolo is my favorite wine. White truffles
offer the greatest aroma -- and one of the greatest tastes -- on
Earth. The combination of Barolo and white truffles is as
indescribable as it is unbeatable. And, fortunately, the site for
that particular lunch has always been Valentino restaurant in Santa
Monica, which has a small outdoor patio, to which we can happily (and
legally!) repair with our post-prandial Havanas.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't hurt that Piero Selvaggio, the proprietor, is both a
friend and a great host, willing to tolerate our arriving at the
start of his Friday lunch and our staying until after his first
dinner customers have been seated.</TE>
<TE>   For the recent ninth annual lunch, one friend flew in from Napa,
another from D.C. and a third from the state of Washington. Because I
like drinking wine, not just tasting it, I've always tried to keep
the group at eight or nine so each of us can have a generous pour of
each wine, not merely a couple of token sips. But my D.C. friend was
a last-minute addition, so we were 10 in all -- and a pretty diverse
group at that: a college professor, a movie producer, a general
contractor, a business executive and a jewelry designer, as well as
two journalists and three people from the food and wine world.</TE>
<TE>   Because I don't like all-male gatherings; I try to include women
at these lunches. I've never managed to entice more than three at a
time, and only two made it to this lunch. But they were, as always, a
civilizing influence. Not that we were all that civilized, come to
think of it. Our conversation was lively and varied, and when my
businessman friend said he'd voted for Bill Simon over Gov. Gray
Davis because "Davis is a prostitute," two other friends -- one of
whom had voted for Davis as "the lesser of two weevils" -- leaped to
defend the honor of prostitutes.</TE>
<TE>   As usual at our lunches, political correctness and the predatory
nature of the pleasure police came in for a pounding, and midway
between the first course (filet of red mullet in a sauce made with
aged scamorza) and the second (a cream of chestnuts and cauliflower
topped with white truffles), my journalistic colleague suddenly began
grumbling about having been asked to stop smoking once while he was
based in Nairobi for The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd just come from covering genocide in Rwanda," he said, "and
here were these people from Santa Monica asking me to put out my
cigarette." He shook his head. "I can't tell you how much pleasure I
got from saying, 'No, I won't put it out. You're part of the reason I
moved away from California.' "</TE>
<TE>   As the wine flowed, so did the non sequiturs. At one point, the
movie executive, talking about the premiere of "Analyze That," told
us that the movie's predecessor, "Analyze This," "did very well in
Australia because so many Greeks live there."</TE>
<TE>   Huh?</TE>
<TE>   The few, the hearty</TE>
<TE>   Much as everyone in our group loves food and wine, ours is not a
collection of foodies or wine geeks, so there was no babbling about
"a nose of tar and roses" on this or that Barolo, and no one dropped
the name of the last famous chef he'd chatted with over dessert. But
we sure did appreciate what we were eating and drinking.</TE>
<TE>   The Barolos came from the four most recent available vintages
(1995, '96, '97 and '98) and from three great, older vintages (1982,
'89 and '90). They came from several of the most distinguished houses
in Piemonte -- Giacosa, Clerico, Seghesio and both Conternos (Aldo
and Giacomo) -- and from my personal favorite, Giuseppe Mascarello.</TE>
<TE>   One wine -- a '96 Bricco Bussia Vigna Colonnello -- was corked, so
we substituted two others, from Seghesio and Aldo Conterno, to make
up for it. We also drank three bottles of white wine -- Giacosa's
Arneis.</TE>
<TE>   The '82 Barolo Monfortino from Giacomo Conterno -- which we drank
with some aged Parmigiano-Reggiano, just before dessert -- was the
consensus best wine. But chef Angelo Auriana's food was the real star
of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Raw, hand-cut beef topped with a quail egg. A timbale of cardoons
with toasted almonds and white truffles. A tortellone of fonduta
topped with white truffles. Gnocchi infused with porcini mushrooms
and topped with white truffles. Saddle of wild hare, roasted with a
sauce of Barolo and juniper berries.</TE>
<TE>   The flavors built on each other and complemented each other in an
extraordinary fashion, and there was no consensus favorite, though to
me, the hare -- with its rich, gamy taste -- seemed the perfect
accompaniment to the ideal-for-drinking-now '89 and '90 Barolos.</TE>
<TE>   We were all feeling quite pleased with ourselves by then anyway,
but our self-induced reverie was briefly interrupted when one guest
said he had to leave early -- before the cigars came out! -- to
attend a business meeting. This violates the spirit of the event --
our individual and collective desire to escape for an afternoon from
the world of commerce, conference and convention -- and several of us
subsequently discussed whether this breach should eliminate him from
next year's lunch. After all, we have many other friends who'd
happily abandon work for several hours to share our Barolo, white
truffles and cigars.</TE>
<TE>   On second thought, maybe we'll just insist that, as both penance
for this year and admission for next year, he bring a bottle of Aldo
Conterno's '71 Barolo Gran Bussia riserva. In magnum.</TE>

<LD>Now it's possible to have spirits with spirit. Bars around the
Southland -- hoping to cash in on that holiday feeling -- have been
serving up martinis with holiday names. Belly on up and order a
Mistletoe, Silent Night, Sex in the Snow, Tannenbaum, Rudolph or
Holitini.</LD>
<LD>   "People just eat it up like cake," says bartender Court Earp of
the Chocolate Candy Cane martini at the Avalon Hotel in Beverly
Hills. It's a virtual dessert in a glass rimmed with white chocolate
(colored red for the holidays) and topped with whipped cream.</LD>
<LD>   At Britta's Cafe in Irvine, there's a playful S'more martini
garnished with a flaming marshmallow. "We know, it's completely over
the top," says general manager Marcy Miller.</LD>
<TE>   The Silent Night at Lola's in West Hollywood consists of
cinnamon-infused vodka, orange zest and cardamom, according to one of
the bartenders, and is garnished with a cinnamon stick and an orange
twist. Then there's the Golden Mistletoe martini -- a concoction of
vodka, peach schnapps, amaretto and juices topped off with a sprig of
mint.</TE>
<TE>   The Whiskey Bar at the W Hotel spent weeks developing its holiday
martini. Management decided on ingredients and color; a mixologist
team created martinis for a final tasting. This year's winner was the
Holitini, made with Godiva chocolate liqueur, vodka and mint.</TE>
<TE>   Even new restaurants aren't immune to the spirit. Sona, recently
opened on La Cienega Boulevard, has been serving a refined, creamless
eggnog martini made from vodka. It's infused with cinnamon sticks,
vermouth, cloves, nutmeg and orange bitters.</TE>
<TE>   "People go nuts over these drinks," says Ric Oriol, bar manager at
Fenix at the Argyle, which serves a martini of Midori and cranberry
juice called the Tannenbaum. "They're really fun and really festive."</TE>

<TE>   Suzanne Goin and Caroline Styne of Lucques have finally opened
their second restaurant, A.O.C. They're serving artisanal cheeses, 50
unusual wines by the glass and family-style dishes such as Spanish
black rice with squid and saffron aioli or clams and chorizo with
garbanzos.</TE>
<TE>   A.O.C., 8022 W. 3rd St., West Hollywood, (323) 653-6359.</TE>
<TE>   Firefly restaurant in Studio City has hired a new chef, Gary T.
Menes, whose resume includes Patina, Aubergine, the Ritz-Carlton
dining room in San Francisco and the French Laundry in Napa Valley.
Among the French-American dishes he'll be cooking is a crisp fried
pike served with pommes Lyonnaise and a shallot wine emulsion.</TE>

<HD>Campanile: It's still a love story</HD>
<DH>Thirteen years ago, L.A. fell for this innovative bistro on
La Brea. Today, the relationship is as strong as ever.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BACK in 1989, when I was visiting Los Angeles, friends brought me to
a new restaurant called Campanile.</LD>
<LD>   We sat at one of the small tables with a view of the kitchen and
the young brigade outfitted in eccentric flat caps instead of chef's
toques. With its gray walls and medieval arches, the restaurant felt
more like Siena than L.A. The air smelled of woodsmoke and garlic and
sizzling meat. And when a waiter brought out a basket of inch-thick
slices of rustic bread with a dark chewy crust, I could have stopped
right there. That's all I wanted, that bread, sweet butter and a
plate of olives.</LD>
<LD>   Then the waiter handed me the wine list, an astonishing compendium
of handpicked gems from, at that time, relatively unknown
appellations and winemakers who have since become superstars. It was
the most avant-garde wine list I'd ever seen, and choosing a couple
of bottles from it was a distinct pleasure.</LD>
<TE>   We ate a pretty little Bibb lettuce salad showered with herbs, and
a plate of handmade ravioli. I remember staring at the platter of
gorgeous vegetables that came with the main courses. It looked like
something Soutine would have painted. My friend urged me to have the
grilled prime rib steak with cannellini beans, a brilliant California
take on the famous bistecca alla fiorentina served with bitter
greens.</TE>
<TE>   Dessert was a plate of crumbly cream biscuits with huckleberry
compote and a mound of softly whipped cream. Heaven. Who wouldn't
fall in love?</TE>
<TE>   A lot has happened in 13 years. The small bakery opened next door
to provide bread for the restaurant was spun off into a separate
business, baking loaves by the thousands and selling them across the
country. Last year La Brea Bakery was bought for $56 million by an
Irish conglomerate.</TE>
<TE>   It's a safe bet that Campanile founders Mark Peel and Nancy
Silverton don't have to work anymore. Yet Peel is behind the stoves
most nights and cooks a chef's tasting menu on Wednesday nights.
Silverton oversees the pastries, writes a cookbook a year, and on
Thursday nights, mans the panini press, turning out what may now well
be the world's most expensive -- and delicious -- grilled cheese
sandwiches.</TE>
<TE>   High energy</TE>
<TE>   In a city as dynamic and changeable as L.A., only a handful of
restaurants have made it to the ripe old age of 13, and some that
have are barely creaking along. Campanile, though, is as vibrant as
ever. That grilled cheese night and a Monday night family-style menu
have brought in a younger crowd. Weekend brunch is swamped. And the
bar is still a great place to meet for a drink, or to grab a quick
bite on your own.</TE>
<TE>   Campanile's kitchen has been a training ground for a number of
chefs who have gone on to open their own places, including Suzanne
Tracht, who recently opened Jar with Mark Peel, and Suzanne Goin, the
chef and owner of Lucques and the new A.O.C. The current chef de
cuisine is Chris Kidder. Kimberly Boyce, a young Spago Hollywood
alum, is pastry chef.</TE>
<TE>   Since the beginning Campanile has had an unwavering commitment to
the product. A lot of chefs talk the talk and claim to shop the
farmers market, but every Wednesday one of the two, Peel or
Silverton, loads up at the Santa Monica Farmers Market. In the early
hours of the morning, Peel buys fish at the Japanese fish market
downtown alongside L.A.'s best sushi chefs.</TE>
<TE>   His ceviche of kanpachi and live scallops in a juicy lime-drenched
dressing with a confetti of red and green peppers is remarkable. He
roasts the Mediterranean fish daurade whole under a blanket of coarse
sea salt, and serves it head on. Cooked this way it has a pure taste
of the sea. Parts of the flesh are dark and almost custardy. It's
delicious with a handful of shell beans or leeks cooked so long
they're almost caramelized.</TE>
<TE>   Campanile's menu pledges allegiance to the seasonal. And if shad
roe or Persian mulberries are in season, or Copper River salmon or
white nectarines, you can be sure the chefs will be making something
with them. Salads, of course, reflect the seasons. Recently there was
a grilled squid salad with a gorgeous green goddess dressing. The
mildly smoky squid, grassy taste of the herbs, red-skinned potato and
feathery greens and a shell pea succotash made a wonderful appetizer.
Another favorite is Silverton's arugula, Medjool date and Parmesan
salad drizzled with intensely peppery Tuscan olive oil. Or you might
find grilled marinated eggplant, vinegary and sweet, or a delightful
salad of young dandelion greens with fava beans and Manchego cheese.</TE>
<TE>   Campanile is such an original that none of these sound like dishes
anywhere else. Clam chowder, swirled with cram and chervil, is filled
with succulent tender clams, diced potatoes and carrots and corn cut
right off the cob, fresh as this morning. A coral-colored bisque
floats the deep sweet taste she-crab.</TE>
<TE>   Not everything is wonderful all the time. The restaurant has had
its slumps. They're never very severe, more a leveling of intensity,
when somehow the dish that enchanted a few weeks before tastes, well,
ordinary. But the kitchen seems to always regain its footing, and the
next time, the food is as good as you remember it.</TE>
<TE>   Risotto is the one exception. After all these years the kitchen
never quite gets right. It's too saucy, too rich, too French, though
the combination of flavors -- lemon, leeks and pistachio, or green
beans, morels and marrow -- are enticing. What I like are the ricotta
gnocchi that show up on the menu from time to time. Oval in shape, a
yellowed ivory in color, they might be served with fragrant matsutake
mushrooms. Pasta tends toward the California model, loaded with
ingredients, slightly over-sauced, but I still have a soft spot in my
heart for trenne with beef Bolognese sauce or the spaghetti alla
chitarra (cut on a box strung with wires like a guitar) with a loose
tomato sauce.</TE>
<TE>   The wine list is no longer quite the dazzling assemblage of
cutting-edge and short-allocation wines it once was. Maybe it's the
economy, or a new-found emphasis on the bottom line, but the
restaurant doesn't seem to be buying with the same verve and
intensity as before. Wine service, like the service in general, is
consistently excellent, never pretentious, always informative.</TE>
<TE>   Campanile, in fact, is one of the more comfortable serious
restaurants around. And fun. It's always been a restaurant for people
who like to eat, not just contemplate their plates. And the plates
here have a lovely, unfussy aesthetic. Dishes look appetizing, a
concept that seems to have gone out of fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Peel was born to grill and roast. That prime rib steak grilled
over olive and almond wood is his signature dish. There's almost
always fabulous lamb, either rosemary-charred baby leg of lamb or
tender little chops, or roasted squab, dark-fleshed and moist. Pork
chops, brined to hold in their moisture, may show up with homemade
apple sauce and baby Brussels sprouts straight off the stalk. How
good is that?</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't stop there. The restaurant has a smart cheese program
with five or six cheeses listed on a menu that describes their
characteristics. It's much more effective than an unwieldy cart,
because you have the chance to learn something about the more unusual
ones. Like Mt. Tam, a cow's milk cheese from Cowgirl Creamery in
Point Reyes, or a Swiss alpage cow's milk cheese, produced only in
the summer months.</TE>
<TE>   Sweet and superlative</TE>
<TE>   Desserts are stellar. Silverton may be the best American pastry
chef in the country, and Boyce is not far behind. There's that Meyer
lemon tart topped with a hard meringue the color of cafe au lait and
paired with a sharp sweet vinegary sauce. "Broken" napoleon is shards
of fragile pastry leaves heaped with luscious mascarpone and
sweet-fleshed yellow and white nectarines. In season, you might find
a Montmorency cherry pie scented with almond and served with a
ravishing mascarpone ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   Campanile's sourdough chocolate cake with "iced cream" and a
bitter espresso sauce has walls so fragile they barely hold in the
glorious sludge of dark, dark chocolate. I'm still hoping I'll see
Boyce's peach fritters listed again, the dough perfumed with orange
flower water and dotted with sliced peaches. Fried to a pale gold and
rolled in sugar, they were served with fat boysenberries and a
boysenberry ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   Now I have friends from out of town who never want to go anywhere
else. They know we'll have fun, we'll eat until we're stuffed.
Campanile is still a food lovers' restaurant.</TE>

<HD>A crust that's easier than pie</HD>

<LD>Dear SOS: Pumpkin pies always seem to be just pumpkin pies. This
year, however, we got a pie with a delicious shortbread crust from
Euro Pane Bakery in Pasadena. I was wondering if the bakery would
share the recipe.</LD>
<LD>   Candice Doi</LD>
<LD>   La Crescenta</LD>
<TE>   Dear Candice: Sumi Chang, owner of Euro Pane, said she created
this recipe quite by accident. With plenty of pumpkin pie filling but
no pie crust dough on hand, she decided to use shortbread for a crust
and make pumpkin bars. They're very popular and make a great dessert.
You also could use other fillings, such as lemon or chocolate
custard.</TE>
<TE>   Pumpkin bars</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 hour, 15 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 24</TE>
<TE>   Note: At the bakery, the bars have a crust at least one-half-inch
thick. In our testing, we found that a thinner crust produced a more
delicate bar and one that is not overpoweringly sweet, since the
shortbread crust is so rich.</TE>
<TE>   Pumpkin filling</TE>
<TE>   3 eggs</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup brown sugar, packed</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup light corn syrup</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups pumpkin puree</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon cinnamon (optional)</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon dark rum</TE>
<TE>   (optional)</TE>
<TE>   1. Lightly whisk the eggs in a mixing bowl. Fold in the brown
sugar, then the corn syrup, cream, pumpkin, cinnamon and rum.</TE>
<TE>   Shortbread crust</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups pastry flour</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup powdered sugar</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) cold butter, cubed</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 325 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   2. Combine the flour and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Using your
fingers or a pastry blender, cut in the butter until it is the size
of peas. Lightly knead the dough until it comes together in a ball.
If the dough becomes too soft, place it in the freezer for 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   3. Place the dough in a 13-by-9-inch baking pan. Lightly flour
your hands and press the dough across the bottom and 1 inch up the
sides of the pan. If the dough softens too much again, place the pan
in the freezer for a couple of minutes.</TE>
<TE>   4. Bake the crust until lightly browned, 20 minutes. Remove to a
rack; cool.</TE>
<TE>   5. Pour the pumpkin filling into the crust. Bake until the filling
is set but still slightly jiggly in the center, 25 minutes. Let cool
on a rack, then cut into 24 bars.</TE>
<TE>   Each bar: 155 calories; 115 mg. sodium; 48 mg. cholesterol; 8
grams fat; 5 grams saturated fat; 19 grams carbohydrates; 2 grams

<LD>What hostess wouldn't faint for fudge, especially when packed in a
velvet jewel box? Fudge Fatale is one of those handy little hostess
gifts to have on hand. The recipe was created by Hollywood
cinematographer Alexander Black more than 30 years ago. After
receiving rave reviews and applause from friends over the years, he
began selling his handmade fudge. The pure chocolate flavor makes it
addictive.</LD>
<LD>   Fudge Fatale eight-piece box, $10.99, and four-piece box, $5.99,
at Bristol Farms and Sur la Table. Or call (888) 923-8343.</LD>

<LD>Here's a different cheese for New Year's entertaining -- a white
Stilton flecked with bits of lemon zest. In fact, it's called --
Lemon Zest. This English large-curd cheese is best at room
temperature, when it is almost spreadable, accompanied with wheat
meal crackers. Or offer it with nuts and a dry Sherry or Port for
dessert.</LD>

<LD>OK, we know this is crazy expensive, but it is just so cute. For this
centennial of Perrier-Jouet's signature "Fleur de Champagne" bottle,
Beverly Hills purse designer Kathrine Baumann redefined the idea of
sparkling wine with a mini-golden version of the champagne's Belle
Epoch icon. At $2,437, it's a luxurious addition to her minaudiere
menu, which includes Swarovski crystal-covered -- and calorie-free --
hot dogs, caviar and McDonald's fries.</LD>
<LD>   Perrier-Jouet bottle bag, in gold or green with 14-karat covered
crystals, available by special order at David Orgell, 320 N. Rodeo
Drive, Beverly Hills, (310) 273-6660, or by calling Kathrine Baumann
at (877) 228-6266. A champagne cork pillbox is $325.</LD>

<HD>Final OK on Allergan Drug Boosts Shares</HD>
<DH>FDA approval means pharmaceutical firm can begin marketing
the first prescription medication to treat dry-eye disease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jesus Sanchez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Allergan Inc., the pharmaceutical company best known for selling the
wrinkle-banishing agent Botox, said Tuesday that it received
long-awaited regulatory approval to market the first prescription
treatment for dry-eye disease, a condition that affects an estimated
1 million Americans.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Allergan, which have been depressed for two years,
jumped more than 10% on Tuesday, up $5.43, to close at $58.17 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   Although not viewed as a blockbuster drug, Allergan's new
eyedrops, called Restasis, eventually could generate as much as $500
million in sales annually, the company said. Analysts said the
medication would help the Irvine-based firm solidify its position as
an industry leader in eye-care pharmaceuticals. Among its other top
medications is Alphagan, which is used to treat glaucoma.</LD>
<TE>   Allergan has stated that Restasis, which helps battle dry-eye
disease by stimulating tear production, is more effective than
currently available eyedrops and ointments sold over the counter. The
company said it would begin selling the drops during the second
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a big a deal for them," said Donald B. Ellis, an analyst
who follows the specialty drug industry for Thomas Weisel Partners, a
San Francisco-based merchant bank. Allergan is not expected to reap
immediate benefits from the drug because of large marketing and other
expenses to introduce the eyedrops, Ellis said, but the profit should
start flowing in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Allergan will share some of the royalties generated by Restasis
with Durham, N.C.-based Inspire Pharmaceuticals Inc. as part of a
development and marketing agreement.</TE>
<TE>   In the first nine months of this year, Allergan's earnings before
one-time charges were up 24% on a 19% rise in sales. Last year,
Allergan reported sales of $1.7 billion, with eye-care
pharmaceuticals accounting for about 43%. Its Botox sales in 2001
were $309.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Allergan has been waiting for the final regulatory go-ahead on
Restasis since 1999, when the Food and Drug Administration gave it
conditional approval. The agency overruled an advisory panel that
rejected the drug as not being much more effective than
over-the-counter medications. Monday's final approval came after the
FDA reviewed additional tests, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Lester J. Kaplan, the company's president of research and
development, said the approval of Restasis is the culmination of
pioneering work in the field.</TE>
<TE>   Dry-eye disease is characterized by chronic irritation and
inflammation, caused by a decrease in natural tear production.
Incidence of the disease, which in extreme cases can result in
serious damage to the surface of the eye, increases markedly with age
and after menopause in women.</TE>
<TE>   The company has said Restasis is stronger and provides
longer-lasting relief than over-the-counter drugs and also helps
decrease inflammation associated with dry-eye disease.</TE>
<TE>   Restasis includes the drug cyclosporine, which has until now been
used mostly to help treat some cases of rheumatoid arthritis and to
minimize the rejection of organs in transplant patients.</TE>
<TE>   Clinical tests have shown that the most common adverse side effect
of the drug is a burning sensation in the eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Tuesday's run-up in Allergan's share price, its stock
still is down 20% for the year.</TE>

<HD>Judge Dismisses Amgen's Lawsuit Against Medicare</HD>
<DH>Biotech company is expected to appeal the ruling, which
makes its anemia drug more expensive than its rival's.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Denise Gellene</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge Tuesday dismissed Amgen Inc.'s lawsuit against
Medicare that sought to stop the federal agency from lowering
reimbursement for the company's anemia drug Aranesp. The ruling could
shift about $100 million a year in drug sales to Amgen archrival
Johnson &amp; Johnson.</LD>
<LD>   Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, had no immediate comment on the
ruling by U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan in Washington. The
world's largest biotechnology company is expected to appeal the
decision, which makes Aranesp more expensive for hospital outpatient
treatment than J&amp;J's anemia drug Procrit.</LD>
<LD>   Amgen sued the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the
Department of Health and Human Services last month after Medicare cut
Aranesp's reimbursement rate by half.</LD>
<TE>   At stake is a portion of the Medicare market for anemia drugs
worth nearly $1 billion annually. In its suit, Amgen said that it
could lose as much as $119 million in 2003 sales if the reimbursement
cuts take effect Jan. 1 as scheduled. The hospital outpatient
business covered by Medicare accounted for 10% of Aranesp sales in
2002.</TE>
<TE>   However, Merrill Lynch analyst Eric Ende said he expected Amgen to
retain most of its patients by offering hospital discounts.</TE>
<TE>   Aranesp and Procrit, which produce red blood cells, are used to
treat anemia in patients suffering from kidney disease and for cancer
patients undergoing chemotherapy. Amgen considers Aranesp, launched
just a year ago, its most important drug and the key to regaining
business it long ago ceded to J&amp;J.</TE>
<TE>   Procrit is J&amp;J's brand of EPO, the red blood cell drug invented by
Amgen. J&amp;J has an exclusive license from Amgen to sell Procrit
outside the kidney dialysis market, in which Amgen sells its own EPO
brand.</TE>
<TE>   Aranesp is a modified version that Amgen claims is more potent
than its original red blood cell drug and does not have to be taken
as often. Aranesp is not covered by Amgen's 17-year-old licensing
deal with J&amp;J.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen's dispute with Medicare centers on an arcane pricing
mechanism that assigns higher reimbursement rates to new drugs.
Medicare tentatively proposed covering Aranesp at the higher rate,
making it a more economical drug choice for hospitals than J&amp;J's
Procrit.</TE>
<TE>   But J&amp;J argued that Procrit and Aranesp are "functionally
equivalent" drugs and they should be reimbursed at the same rate.
After reviewing 40 scientific studies, Medicare agreed with J&amp;J.</TE>
<TE>   A representative for J&amp;J had no comment Tuesday and a Medicare
spokesman couldn't be reached.</TE>
<TE>   Before Congress recessed for the holidays, Amgen lobbied lawmakers
for legislation that would overturn Medicare's action. Sen. Charles
E. Grassley (R-Iowa), incoming chairman of the Finance Committee,
issued a statement saying that Congress may have to examine the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen shares fell 19 cents to $51.45 Tuesday on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Skechers to Countersue Spears on Endorsement</HD>
<DH>Manhattan Beach footwear maker, target of suit by singer's
company Monday, says she breached contract.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Skechers U.S.A. Inc., a Manhattan Beach maker of shoes for teenagers
and young adults, said Tuesday that it would file a countersuit
against a company owned by pop singer Britney Spears, which sued
Skechers over an endorsement contract.</LD>
<LD>   Britney Brands Inc.'s suit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in
Los Angeles, claims that Skechers ran ads for Spears' brand of skates
only when the skates she endorses -- and receives royalties for --
weren't for sale, causing consumers to buy Skechers' skates instead.</LD>
<LD>   Skechers said Spears is the one who breached the contract by
failing to approve designs and manufacturers for skating clothing and
other accessories.</LD>
<TE>   The company claims the singer caused it to miss the fall season
for the apparel, costing it millions of dollars in sales.</TE>
<TE>   "She torpedoed the agreement," said Daniel Petrocelli, a lawyer
for Skechers. He said that Britney Brands was aware that Skechers
intended to sue the singer and raced to the courthouse first in "a
publicity stunt."</TE>
<TE>   Britney Brands in Kentwood, La., couldn't be reached Tuesday. Her
publicist in Los Angeles and her lawyer also couldn't be reached.</TE>
<TE>   Skechers hired Spears in September 2000. In January, the company
expanded the agreement to include a line of roller skates and
accessories that would have Spears' autographs, photos and logos.</TE>
<TE>   The three-year agreement was valued at $5 million, Britney Brands
said.</TE>
<TE>   Spears' suit seeks at least a $500,000 royalty payment she claims
is due Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   She also wants the court to order Skechers to continue to
advertise and promote her skating accessories when they are ready for
sale.</TE>
<TE>   Skechers shares rose 8 cents to $7.88 on the New York Stock
Exchange. This month, the footwear maker said it will have a
fourth-quarter loss instead of a profit as competition from Nike Inc.
and Reebok International Ltd. hurt sales.</TE>

<HD>State Law Requiring Warning on Credit Cards Is Overturned</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citigroup Inc. and other credit card issuers don't have to follow a
California law that requires them to warn customers about the
consequences of making only minimum monthly payments, a federal judge
said.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Frank Damrell said in a ruling made public
Tuesday that California couldn't impose its laws on banks, which are
generally governed by federal law. The consumer protection law was to
take effect last July.</LD>
<LD>   The American Bankers Assn. and five major credit card issuers sued
the state last year, claiming that it would cost the industry
millions of dollars to implement the policy.</LD>
<TE>   The state argued that the law would protect California consumers,
who are accumulating historic amounts of debt.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a good California consumer law," said Hallye Jordan, a
spokeswoman for Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer. "It makes sense to educate
and inform consumers about the debt they can rack up if they simply
make minimum payments."</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer is considering an appeal, Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>   The law is "constitutionally inapplicable in its entirety to
federally chartered credit card issuers," Damrell wrote.</TE>
<TE>   A call to the American Bankers Assn. wasn't immediately returned.</TE>
<TE>   The credit card companies that joined the suit are Citigroup's
Citibank, J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.'s Chase Manhattan Bank, MBNA
Corp.'s MBNA America Bank, Bank One Corp.'s First USA Bank and
Household International Inc.'s Household Bank.</TE>

<HD>A Doctor Envisions Better Eye Care for the Poor</HD>

<LD>When Dr. Richard Casey went to Harvard Medical School 22 years ago,
he had no idea that glaucoma and other causes of blindness were six
times more common among African Americans than among whites. Nobody
did.</LD>
<LD>   But since that time, research studies and the clinical experiences
of Casey and other eye doctors have provided powerful evidence that
race and ethnicity are important factors when it comes to vision
problems.</LD>
<LD>   Poverty only compounds the trouble. The key to treating eye
disease is early detection -- something that is woefully absent in
many urban neighborhoods.</LD>
<TE>   "Children need screening, and the schools really don't have the
facilities or the funds" to provide it, says Casey, head of
ophthalmology at Martin Luther King/Drew Medical Center and a leading
specialist at the Jules Stein Eye Institute at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   So, three years ago, Casey and five other African American doctors
founded the Los Angeles Eye Institute with the idea of reaching out
to Compton, South-Central Los Angeles and nearby areas in which
access to health care is lacking for a great number of residents.</TE>
<TE>   The story of how Casey and his colleagues launched L.A. Eye is a
testament to the tremendous power that can be deployed when private
citizens, government and business all pull together to take on a
problem.</TE>
<TE>   The institute's mission began with helping kids. In the last two
years, L.A. Eye has furnished the doctors and technicians necessary
to check 16,000 youngsters around the city. Meanwhile, the
LensCrafters Foundation -- the charitable arm of giant eyeglass chain
LensCrafters Inc. -- has contributed the use of its mobile unit for
eye examinations and 6,000 pairs of glasses.</TE>
<TE>   The LensCrafters Foundation was recruited by Shea Hamilton, L.A.
Eye's director of community outreach.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw kids had problems in school because they couldn't see,"
says Hamilton, former staff assistant to Rep. Juanita
Millender-McDonald (D-Carson).</TE>
<TE>   Beginning next month, the institute will visit schoolyards in the
Los Angeles Unified School District using a bus of its own, bought
with a grant from the Department of Health and Human Services.
LensCrafters will continue to provide spectacles, as well as lens
makers and other equipment for the new bus.</TE>
<TE>   And surely children will continue to pen thank-you notes such as
the one from Seylin Ramos, who was convinced that she could not see
from her right eye -- until she was examined and given glasses.</TE>
<TE>   "First, I couldn't believe it," she wrote to the institute and the
"LensCrafter people." "I closed my left eye and still I could see."</TE>
<TE>   For the adult community, L.A. Eye has worked out of the King/Drew
Medical Center in Compton, where crowding is intense. It takes nine
months to get an appointment there and a four-hour wait when the
scheduled day finally arrives, institute officials say.</TE>
<TE>   But next month the institute is moving into its own clinic in
Lynwood with the help of a $1-million grant from the California
Endowment. The endowment, a statewide health foundation with $3
billion in assets, has given out about $1 billion to community-based
organizations such as L.A. Eye.</TE>
<TE>   At the Lynwood center, L.A. Eye also will have the help of</TE>
<TE>   Allergan Inc. The Irvine-based pharmaceutical company specializes
in remedies for eye diseases, including glaucoma, an affliction
caused by pressure within the eye. If untreated, glaucoma over time
can damage the optic nerve and lead to tunnel vision and possibly
blindness.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Kerry Cox, medical director of L.A. Eye, encountered Allergan
executives at a medical conference, where they were talking about the
company's need for testing sites.</TE>
<TE>   He told them about the institute, and Allergan is now contributing
state-of-the-art equipment to the Lynwood clinic. "They want to do
testing nationwide," Cox says, "but there are no other organizations
doing what we do here."</TE>
<TE>   The Lynwood facility is designed to be temporary. In a few years,
L.A. Eye hopes to open a major clinic adjacent to King/Drew to bring
expanded ophthalmic care to the South-Central community.</TE>
<TE>   To build that center, which will cost about $20 million,</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Eye will need federal money as well as private donations from
supporters similar to the companies that back its work now.</TE>
<TE>   Among these firms are Alcon Laboratories, a pharmaceutical
division of Nestle Inc. specializing in eye care; Northrop-Grumman
Corp; and United Parcel Service Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Cox fully expects that the funding will come together, in large
part because the link</TE>
<TE>   between eye disease and ethnicity is finally being recognized.</TE>
<TE>   "African ancestry" is listed on Allergan's Web site as a risk
factor for glaucoma. And other ethnic groups represented in
South-Central Los Angeles, including Latinos and Asians, may share a
predisposition to eye trouble, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Two decades ago, nobody had measured the prevalence of eye disease
among African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "I took an elective course in medical statistics at Harvard,"
recalls Casey, and the pattern began to emerge. Intrigued, he
followed up with clinical work and then returned to Harvard, where he
further pinned down the connection.</TE>
<TE>   The other driving force behind L.A. Eye -- that poor people have
precious little health coverage and access to good medical care -- is
hardly something that Casey needed to be educated on. He knew about
those trends simply from growing up in Willowbrook, just north of
Compton.</TE>
<TE>   Casey attended Occidental College and then went on to medical
school in Cambridge, Mass., where he says his professors gave him his
marching orders: "Do something that will have an impact in the
greater community."</TE>
<TE>   That's a good thought for all of us during this season, and the
spirit behind The Times Holiday Campaign.</TE>

<HD>ICN Obtains Court Order Restricting Ribapharm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald D. White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., escalating its battle with a rebel spinoff
company, said Tuesday that it obtained a court order preventing
Ribapharm Inc. from making any major business decisions while ICN
seeks to shake up Ribapharm's board.</LD>
<LD>   ICN, which owns 80% of Ribapharm, said it obtained the temporary
restraining order from a Delaware Chancery Court. Under the order,
Ribapharm cannot issue new shares, take on debt or acquire or sell
businesses without giving 10 days' written notice, according to ICN.</LD>
<LD>   Both companies are based in Costa Mesa.</LD>
<TE>   In April, ICN spun off about 20% of Ribapharm in an initial public
offering, under pressure from shareholders who said a separate
company would unleash greater potential for ICN's hepatitis C drug,
known as ribavirin. Since then, Ribapharm executives had been
pressuring ICN to complete the spinoff of the company to ICN
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   ICN's chief executive, Robert W. O'Leary, said his company had not
decided whether to proceed with a full spinoff of Ribapharm. In the
third quarter, ICN's royalties from ribavirin more than doubled from
a year earlier to $63.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, ICN announced that it was removing five of the six
members of Ribapharm's board, including its chief executive, Dr.
Johnson Y. N. Lau. ICN alleged that Ribapharm's board acted
inappropriately in awarding significant cash bonuses and stock
options to senior management just seven months after Ribapharm's
initial public offering and before the company's 2002 results were
final.</TE>
<TE>   Ribapharm executives could not be reached for comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of ICN fell 25 cents to $11.03 and Ribapharm rose 6 cents
to $5.82. Both trade on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Deal Reached for Muppets Creator</HD>
<DH>EM.TV plans to sell a 49.9% stake in Henson to a group led
by media entrepreneur Dean Valentine. Disney decides not to bid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mickey and Miss Piggy won't be an item after all.</LD>
<LD>   Walt Disney Co. has ended its flirtation with the struggling Jim
Henson Co., creator of the Muppets. Instead, a group headed by media
entrepreneur Dean Valentine has signed a letter of intent to buy
49.9% of Henson Co. from EM.TV.</LD>
<LD>   The German children's programming company will retain the
controlling interest in Henson while raising much-needed cash to pay
impatient creditors.</LD>
<TE>   "Everybody in the world knows who Kermit and Miss Piggy are,"
Valentine said Tuesday. "The fact that the company has obviously been
the subject of corporate turmoil over the years and the characters
have not had the kind of exposure that they will have now, doesn't
mean it's a frayed or decaying brand. It's just a little bit asleep."</TE>
<TE>   EM.TV announced the planned sale Tuesday but declined to specify
the value of the deal, which is expected to close next month.</TE>
<TE>   Valentine, former chief executive of Viacom Inc.'s United
Paramount Network, also would not discuss the details of his offer,
noting that the deal had yet to close. Valentine's partner is
Europlay Capital Advisors, an Encino-based private equity firm.</TE>
<TE>   Their bid was among several that emerged in recent months,
including one from billionaire Haim Saban. Those offers -- some of
them for the entire company -- were in the $100-million to
$140-million range, said a source familiar with the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Disney also was weighing whether to enter the competition.</TE>
<TE>   The Burbank company has long had an interest in acquiring the
characters to expand its portfolio of family entertainment. More than
a decade ago, Disney had agreed to buy Henson Co. for $150 million.
But the deal unraveled after the Muppets creator died in May 1990.</TE>
<TE>   This time, however, the two sides couldn't agree on a price.
Disney Chief Executive Michael Eisner was reluctant to invest the
kind of money needed to turn around Henson Co., a Disney source said.
These days, Disney is looking to slim down as a way to shore up its
bottom line, squeezed by the falloff in tourism and travel and
earlier problems at its ABC television unit.</TE>
<TE>   It is widely acknowledged that EM.TV was unable to restore the
magic to the Muppets franchise, which was hugely popular on
television in the late 1970s and early '80s.</TE>
<TE>   In the ensuing years, the characters were not successfully updated
or marketed for a new generation of viewers hooked on characters such
as Arthur, SpongeBob SquarePants and the Rugrats.</TE>
<TE>   To help revive the Muppets, Valentine has tapped a new management
team that includes Mort Marcus, the former chairman of Miramax
Television &amp; Video, and Nick Van Dyk, a former executive vice
president of Artisan Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Valentine once headed Disney's Touchstone TV and animation unit,
where he oversaw the creation of the shows "Home Improvement" and
"Ellen." He also established Disney's lucrative direct-to-video
animation business.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing on his background at Disney and UPN, Valentine hopes to
give the Muppets exposure across multiple outlets, including stage
shows, movies, cable and broadcast television and direct-to-video
releases. The strategy would include, for example, television movies
such as the recent Muppets Christmas special on NBC, which drew
surprisingly strong ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Munich-based EM.TV, which had been searching for a buyer for more
than a year, was under pressure from its lenders to quickly close a
deal. EM.TV paid $680 million for Henson Co. in March 2000, one in a
series of media acquisitions that left the company with hefty debts
of more than $900 million.</TE>
<TE>   The sale doesn't include some of the Muppets' most recognizable
names from the children's show "Sesame Street," such as Big Bird and
Bert and Ernie. The rights to the characters belong to Sesame
Workshop.</TE>

<HD>As Prices of Flat TVs Tumble, Thin Is In Among Consumers</HD>
<DH>High-tech sets move from specialty stores into the mass
market. Makers scramble to meet soaring demand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In addition to giant tubs of mayonnaise and mega-packs of toilet
paper, thousands of Costco shoppers are finding room in their carts
for a more high-end product: plasma TV sets.</LD>
<LD>   Sharp price cuts have brought plasma sets and other thin, flat
televisions out of high-end electronics boutiques and into thousands
of mass-market outlets such as Costco, a wholesale buying club best
known for offering members bulk items and big discounts.</LD>
<LD>   The least expensive plasma sets still cost a hefty $3,000 or more,
yet sales are growing so rapidly that many manufacturers are racing
to boost production.</LD>
<TE>   "Everyone has been surprised by the quantities that have moved,"
said Tim Farmer, a vice president at Issaquah, Wash.-based Costco
Wholesale Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The burgeoning popularity of thin-screen TVs has prompted more
manufacturers, including some based in California, to jump into the
fray. In all, more than two dozen companies now market some version
of the product.</TE>
<TE>   That increase, combined with expanding production capacity and
improved technology, could push the price of plasma sets down by
one-third next year, according to analyst Richard Doherty of
Envisioneering Group, a technology research firm in Seaford, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   "There is strong consumer demand but not enough to stop the free
fall," Doherty said.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers already are selling the core component of a plasma
set -- the glass panel -- at or near a loss in their hunger for a
share of the growing market, some industry analysts and executives
say. But they're not just competing with one another; they're also
trying to fend off challenges from competing thin-screen
technologies, such as liquid crystal displays, or LCDs.</TE>
<TE>   It's too early to write an obituary for bulky picture tubes, which
will remain the most affordable TV sets for years to come. Still,
analysts and industry executives insist that thin screens have
started their transformation from a niche product into the dominant
format for TV sets in the digital era.</TE>
<TE>   It may take another decade, but thin will win.</TE>
<TE>   The demand for thin screens is fueled in part by the advent of
DVDs and digital TV broadcasts, which offer more detailed pictures
and more lifelike colors than conventional analog TV signals. To see
the difference, consumers need a set that can pack more information
onto the screen than their current TVs can.</TE>
<TE>   This sharpness is most vivid on screens that are 40 inches
diagonal or larger. At that size, however, traditional direct-view
and projection TVs are so bulky that many consumers have trouble
finding a place for them at home.</TE>
<TE>   Hence the interest in thin screens -- models svelte and light
enough to hang on a wall.</TE>
<TE>   The glass panels at the heart of plasma and LCD sets come mainly
from about a dozen companies with factories in Japan, Korea and,
increasingly, China. About 800,000 plasma panels will be shipped this
year around the world, said Mark McConnaughey, senior vice president
of the advanced technology group at Viewsonic Corp. of Walnut.</TE>
<TE>   That's minuscule compared with the overall market for TVs, which
is about 140 million sets this year. Still, McConnaughey said 2003
would be a "breakout year" for plasma because shipments should
double.</TE>
<TE>   Helping drive the growth are new or expanded manufacturing
facilities. For example, Japanese electronics giant NEC Corp. doubled
the capacity of its factory in Japan this year, reaching 300,000 to
400,000 plasma panels. And it plans to double it again in 2003,
executives said.</TE>
<TE>   Pioneer Corp. is converting an optical-disc factory in Japan into
a plasma production line and boosting production from 180,000 panels
a year to 300,000. Matsushita Electric Corp., which sells TVs under
the Panasonic brand, is opening a factory in China that should raise
its annual output from 300,000 units to 500,000.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, plants are becoming far more efficient, slashing the
cost per unit. The average factory had to scrap or rework 85% of the
panels produced three years ago, but now it rejects only 10%, said
Tom Edwards, senior analyst at NPD Techworld, a research firm.</TE>
<TE>   As competition has heated up during the last four years, prices
have fallen more than 50%. According to NPD Techworld, the average
price of a plasma display sold in the U.S. dropped from $12,700 in
January 1999 to $6,100 in October this year.</TE>
<TE>   Prices will have to drop significantly more, however, to attract
masses of buyers, said Tamaryn Pratt, an analyst at Quixel Research
in New York. A Quixel survey found that more than 70% of consumers
interviewed want screens larger than 40 inches, but they quickly lose
interest in sets that cost more than $2,000.</TE>
<TE>   The lowest prices today are for sets from Sampo Corp., a Taiwanese
company with its U.S. sales effort run out of City of Industry. Like
a number of other new competitors, Sampo offers an entry-level
42-inch plasma set that can't display high-definition TV, the most
richly detailed form of digital broadcasting. Instead, the resolution
is capped at about twice the quality of a DVD played on an analog TV
set.</TE>
<TE>   "We focus more on selling in quantity," with profit margins in the
10%-to-15% range, said Robin Hung, a consultant for the company. "If
we can sell more than our competitors, that's what we're aiming for."</TE>
<TE>   The company, which does not make its own panels, expects to sell
about 20,000 plasma sets annually, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby in City of Industry is BenQ Inc., formerly known as Acer
Communications &amp; Multimedia America Inc. BenQ makes its own plasma
and LCD panels at factories in Taiwan and China. But like Sampo, BenQ
is trying to grab market share in part by lowering prices, although
it also is focusing on making panels that last longer, said Jeff
Chen, vice president of the digital display division.</TE>
<TE>   The best markets for plasma screens have been in Asia, and about
half of the sets have gone to businesses instead of homes. Total U.S.
sales could reach 115,000 units this year, said Ed Wolff, vice
president of Panasonic's display group. That's a tiny percentage of
the 25 million sets sold annually in the U.S., but more than double
the amount that Quixel Research estimates were sold nationally in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Plasma is still a very small market sector in the total
display-unit business, but in dollars it's beginning to grow
dramatically," said Craig McManis, marketing vice president for the
home entertainment division of Long Beach-based Pioneer Electronics
(USA) Inc., a subsidiary of Pioneer. "And the area it's impacting the
most is projection televisions." McManis said the company is
generating more revenue from plasma sets than from projection TVs.</TE>
<TE>   Like plasma sets, LCD TVs carry a premium price -- they can be 10
times as expensive as a comparable tube-driven television -- that
knocks them out of most buyers' budgets.</TE>
<TE>   By Pratt's estimates, 250,000 to 300,000 will be sold in the U.S.
this year. But LCD panels are quickly taking over the market for
computer monitors, and the tens of millions of panels being produced
for that segment will help push down prices for LCD TVs, McConnaughey
of Viewsonic predicted.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge for LCD TV makers is to build screens larger than 20
inches that aren't prohibitively expensive. Chen said he doesn't
foresee LCD TVs competing effectively with plasma screens larger than
40 inches. But McConnaughey disagreed, saying that large volumes and
the steadily improving microchips that power LCD screens would narrow
the price gap.</TE>
<TE>   Sharp Electronics Corp., for one, is betting heavily on LCDs, a
gamble that it expects will pay off first in Japan. Its chairman,
Toshiaki Urushisako, has predicted that Sharp would switch completely
from conventional tube sets to LCD TVs in Japan by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Pratt estimated that LCD TV sales would grow rapidly in the U.S.
too, starting at just under half a million in 2003 and rising above
3.2 million in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Scaglione, a marketing vice president at Sharp, said he
expected prices to drop 15% to 20% annually on LCD TVs, thanks partly
to burgeoning capacity and more efficient production lines. The
company plans to open a large-scale factory for LCD panels in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Prices have dropped even more dramatically on sets using Texas
Instruments Inc.'s digital-light-processing technology, a slim
approach to projection TVs that nonetheless can't be mounted on the
wall.</TE>
<TE>   The least expensive set is a 43-inch model due soon from Samsung
that will sell for about $3,700 -- not cheap, but far below the
$12,000 to $15,000 price tags on earlier generations, said John
Reder, manager of the tabletop television business unit at Texas
Instruments.</TE>
<TE>   Two years from now, he added, the company's goal is to make
digital-light-processing sets as inexpensive to produce as
conventional projection sets.</TE>
<TE>   Even with prices as high as they are today, manufacturers of
thin-screen sets say they can hardly keep up with the demand. The
main selling point, it seems, is simple: They're a lot more
attractive than sets with tubes.</TE>
<TE>   "Most consumers, when they go to buy a new television set, want a
screen size bigger than the last TV set," Reder said. Moving above 32
inches or 36 inches has meant buying a projection TV that came in a
large, obtrusive box, and "anybody interested in how their home
looked had some problems with that technology."</TE>

<HD>Entravision to Acquire 3 Stations From Rival Broadcaster</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Leeds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Entravision Communications Corp., one of the nation's biggest
Spanish-language broadcasters, agreed to buy three Los Angeles radio
stations for an estimated $137 million in cash and stock, the company
said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Monica-based firm expects to purchase KLYY-FM, KVYY-FM
and KSYY-FM from Big City Radio Inc., pending regulatory approval.
Big City, based in Hawthorne, N.Y., said last month that it planned
to auction the stations to pay debt and other liabilities.</LD>
<LD>   The move solidifies Entravision's position in the country's top
Spanish-language media market at a time when advertisers have put a
premium on Latinos. If the deal is approved, the company would
control six FM stations in the market.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts called the purchase a daring step, given regulators'
focus on consolidation in Spanish-language media. Justice Department
officials have been reviewing a plan by Univision Communications Inc.
-- which owns a 31% stake in Entravision -- to buy the nation's
biggest Spanish radio chain, Hispanic Broadcasting Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The government has been trying to determine whether Univision has
taken the reins at Entravision, which is the biggest owner of
Univision TV affiliates. To try to assuage regulators, two senior
Univision executives resigned in August from Entravision's board.</TE>
<TE>   But regulators also are expected to force Univision to divest
radio stations in markets where Entravision competes with Hispanic
Broadcasting, including Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Entravision Chairman Walter Ulloa said buying the
Big City stations would let his company expand distribution of its
"Super Estrella" pop-music format. Ulloa added: "We also expect to
benefit from Big City's exit from the Los Angeles market."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Entravision fell 35 cents to $10 Tuesday in New York
Stock Exchange trading.</TE>

<KH>HOLIDAY SHOPPING 2002</KH>
<HD>Closings, Filings May Be in Store</HD>
<DH>Third disappointing retail year in a row may set stage for
a 2003 filled with restructurings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Hirsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Santa Claus pointed his sled back to the North Pole on Tuesday
night, he left a trail of road kill on the retail highway.</LD>
<LD>   Barring a surprise post-Christmas buying surge, the 2002 shopping
season is expected to be lackluster at best -- the third
disappointing year in a row for retailers. And that, analysts say,
could set the stage for a 2003 filled with store closings,
restructurings and possibly bankruptcy filings among the parent firms
of the 450,000 chain-store outlets competing for Americans' dollars.</LD>
<LD>   "Every mall is the same and every store within each mall seems the
same," said Marshal Cohen, retail analyst for NPD Group.</LD>
<TE>   "Look at how many malls there are along the 405 Freeway," he
added. "Would it really make a difference to anyone if one or two of
them weren't there?"</TE>
<TE>   Already, some stores are talking about retrenchment. On Monday,
the owner of the 139-year-old FAO Schwarz toy chain said it planned
to close as many as 70 locations.</TE>
<TE>   "For one of the oldest and most famous toy retailers to be
cratering at Christmas is amazing," said Burt Flickinger III, who
heads Strategic Resource Group, a New York retail and marketing
consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, there's always some churn among the nation's chain
stores. What may be different in 2003 is that there could be more
closures and fewer store openings.</TE>
<TE>   Flickinger estimates that retail chains will announce 1,200 to
1,500 closings during the first half of 2003, about double the rate
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the closures will come from Kmart Corp., which Flickinger
expects to shutter nearly 600 of its 1,800 stores nationwide,
including 40 in Southern California. The Troy, Mich.-based
discounter, which is operating under Bankruptcy Court protection,
said Tuesday that it will disclose details about its planned closures
next month.</TE>
<TE>   Other chains also are having holiday pains. Sales at Target Corp.
and Barnes &amp; Noble Inc. have fallen short of forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   Even stalwart Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's biggest retailer,
said its sales will come in at the low end of its estimate of a 3% to
5% gain.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Lehman Bros. analyst Alan Rifkin told Reuters that
Best Buy Co. probably would shut as many as 150 mall-based music
stores in its Sam Goody chain next month because of poor performance.</TE>
<TE>   Flickinger and other retail consultants expect the store-closure
epidemic to include such names as Gap Inc., Borders Group Inc., Good
Guys Inc., Sports Authority Inc., Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co., Tower
Records, May Department Stores Co., Saks Inc.  and Blockbuster Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "All of these chains overexpanded during the 1990s, and now they
are going to have to close a number of stores and some will even take
large write-downs to get out of leases," Flickinger said.</TE>
<TE>   Gap, which operates 4,100 stores under the Gap, Banana Republic
and Old Navy names, said last month that it expected to close more
stores next year than its usual 70 to 80.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the sluggish economy is part of the problem. But
another factor seems to be the worn-out consumer, who is spending
with less ardor after a shopping binge in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Some economists already are forecasting that holiday sales at
stores open at least a year will rise 1.5%, the lowest since 1970
when the data were first tracked.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, many Americans may be thinking more about saving than
shopping. The U.S. personal savings rate was at 4.3% in November,
having climbed from a record low of below 2% in late 1999 and early
2000, according to the Commerce Department.</TE>
<TE>   One reason why shopping is holding less appeal, according to
Cohen, is that there are too many stores selling merchandise that is
too similar.</TE>
<TE>   He estimates that there are about 29 square feet of retail space
for each person in the United States, about double from a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen and others believe that the saturation has crimped
retailers' ability to raise prices, and stores have to sell
ever-greater numbers of goods just to stay even.</TE>
<TE>   According to Michael Niemira, an economist with Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi, apparel prices have fallen 2% from a year ago;
radio and television prices have dipped 10%; and housewares are down
2%.</TE>
<TE>   This trend can be especially damaging to retailers, which need
dollar volume to offset their large investment in real estate and
store leases.</TE>
<TE>   In a deflationary environment, retailers "need to sell more to
make the same bottom line," said Carol Sanger, spokeswoman for
Cincinnati-based Federated Department Stores Inc., which owns Macy's
and Bloomingdale's.</TE>
<TE>   Today, department store prices are down about 3% from a year ago,
according to Commerce Department figures. So to achieve a 3% increase
in revenue, a store must boost its volume by 6%, noted Carl
Steidtmann, chief economist of Deloitte Research in New York.</TE>
<TE>   James Sinegal, chief executive of Issaquah, Wash.-based Costco
Wholesale Corp., said that where the deflation exists in the
retailing supply chain is what matters most.</TE>
<TE>   As it has grown, Costco's buying clout has improved, Sinegal
explained, reducing its wholesale cost for many products. Passing
those savings to consumers makes little difference as long as Costco
maintains its profit margin.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for many retailers, the deflation is taking place in their
aisles, rather than at the supplier level.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Southern California department stores found
themselves in an increasingly heated discounting war this Christmas,
flooding the market with bigger and bigger discount coupons and other
markdowns as the holiday approached.</TE>
<TE>   "When you put all these forces together, it is a disaster," Cohen
said.</TE>
<TE>   Steidtmann, however, does not think it's necessarily so bad in the
end.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you will see some bankruptcies and closures in retailing,
and it will be healthy for the industry," he said. "It is going to
make life a lot easier for the survivors."</TE>

<HD>Exec Leaving Clear Channel Entertainment Unit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Leeds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The second in command at Clear Channel Communications Inc.'s ailing
entertainment unit is leaving his post amid a cost-cutting drive,
according to people familiar with the matter.</LD>
<LD>   The departure of Steve Smith, Los Angeles-based chief operating
officer of the entertainment division, comes after a sluggish year in
the live-event business. Smith is expected to remain with the
company, possibly running a philanthropic project, sources said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Smith, a radio promotion veteran, is credited with championing a
push to cross-promote Clear Channel's live events on its radio
stations. But insiders say the entertainment division's regional
bosses resisted reporting to him instead of to Clear Channel
Entertainment Chief Executive Brian Becker.</LD>
<TE>   Neither the executives nor representatives of the company or the
unit could be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   According to Clear Channel's public filings, entertainment
division revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30 fell about 7.5%
from the year-earlier period to $1.9 billion. But the division posted
operating profit of $100.4 million for the nine months, up from a
loss of $42.4 million a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the return to profitability, San Antonio-based Clear
Channel's senior executives have been dissatisfied with the unit's
performance.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel has faced particular trouble in the concert
industry, where this year it suffered from poorly performing tours by
such acts as Guns N' Roses, Peter Gabriel and Lenny Kravitz.</TE>
<TE>   In an earlier shake-up, Clear Channel fired the entertainment
division's top marketing executive and briefly shifted the
operation's box-seat sales force to the conglomerate's radio
division, irking some insiders, people familiar with the situation
said.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel shares fell $1.12 to $38.34 on Tuesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Durable Goods Orders Decline</HD>
<DH>The numbers for most categories are down for November and
are much weaker than Wall Street expected, giving analysts 'no good
news.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Ahmann</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orders for costly, long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods fell last
month, a report Tuesday showed, pouring cold water on hopes that a
long slump in business spending was beginning to ease.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. durable goods orders slid 1.4% in November after a downwardly
revised 1.7% gain a month earlier, the Commerce Department said. A
2.4% rise in orders had been reported for October.</LD>
<LD>   Orders for most categories of durable goods fell in November and
were much weaker than Wall Street expected; analysts were looking for
a 0.7% rise.</LD>
<TE>   "These numbers are weak across the board," said Drew Matus, senior
financial economist at Lehman Bros. "Usually you can find something
upbeat in these figures, but this time there's no good news at all."</TE>
<TE>   Capital goods orders excluding defense and aircraft, viewed as a
proxy for business capital spending plans, fell 2.2% after a strong
5.9% October advance that had raised hopes that business capital
spending was picking up.</TE>
<TE>   A collapse in spending by businesses on plants and equipment,
which had boomed in the 1990s, led the economy into recession and a
turnaround in this area is seen as crucial for a sustained recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Economists said the uncertainties surrounding the possible
economic effect of a U.S. war with Iraq has made businesses reluctant
to increase their spending.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an underlying need for capital investment, but in this
atmosphere of uncertainty companies don't mind falling behind a
little bit and just waiting till things clear up," said Stephen
Stanley, RBS Greenwich Capital Markets economist.</TE>
<TE>   The report showed sharp drops in demand for civilian aircraft and
autos that pulled orders for transportation equipment down by 1.6% in
November. But even excluding that decline, overall durable goods
orders were off 1.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Orders for primary metals fell 4.6%, the largest drop since
October 2000, and demand for fabricated metal products dropped 1.8%.
Machinery orders fell 3.2% and orders for electrical equipment were
down 0.6%.</TE>
<TE>   The computers and electronic products sector was the only major
durable goods category to post a gain last month, with a 0.3% rise
that built on a 3.5% October increase.</TE>
<TE>   Within that category, computer orders fell 3.7% and communications
equipment orders rose 1.4%.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy is not cascading lower, but I think any recovery is
going to be very gradual," said Dana Johnson, the head of research at
Banc One Capital Markets.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks stumbled through a quiet pre-holiday session Tuesday, with
most key indexes ending with modest losses.</LD>
<LD>   In commodities markets, oil and gold prices continued their recent
rallies. In currency trading, the dollar slid to a new three-year low
against the euro.</LD>
<LD>   Trading volume was very light as the New York Stock Exchange and
other equity markets closed three hours early, at 10 a.m. PST.
Markets will be closed today in observance of Christmas. They will
reopen Thursday with regular hours.</LD>
<TE>   Sellers dominated what action there was Tuesday: The Dow
industrials fell 45.18 points, or 0.5%, to 8,448.11, while the Nasdaq
composite slipped 9.22 points, or 0.7%, to 1,372.47.</TE>
<TE>   Losers outnumbered winners by 16 to 15 on the NYSE and by 17 to 13
on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The latest economic news wasn't encouraging, as the government
reported that orders to factories for big-ticket goods fell 1.4% in
November.</TE>
<TE>   With many retailers reporting weak holiday sales, the decline in
durable goods orders raised more questions about the economy's pace
heading into 2003. If activity is slowing, expected corporate
earnings gains may not materialize.</TE>
<TE>   Those concerns have left the stock market stalled since
mid-November, after rallying from five-year lows in October.</TE>
<TE>   Many investors had been hoping for a year-end rally to pare their
losses. The Dow still is down 15.7% this year; the Nasdaq index is
down 29.6%.</TE>
<TE>   Worries about the economy drove some investors into Treasury
securities Tuesday. The yield on the 10-year T-note fell to 3.94%
from 3.97% Monday. The yield has dropped from 4.21% at the end of
November.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, some currency traders are continuing to dump dollars in
favor of other currencies. In part, that reflects fears that a war
between the United States and Iraq could spur jittery foreign
investors to sell U.S. assets, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The euro rose to $1.03 on Tuesday in New York, up from $1.026
Monday and the highest closing level in three years.</TE>
<TE>   The Swiss franc hit a four-year high against the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   "Hawkish [U.S.] rhetoric about North Korea gives investors even
more excuses to avoid U.S. assets," Monica Fan, a currency strategist
at RBC Capital Markets, told Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was an attack on North Korea, business confidence would
be very shaken," hurting the economy, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Gold, the traditional safe-haven investment, has benefited in
recent weeks at the dollar's expense. On Tuesday near-term gold
futures in New York added $1.70 to $346.80 an ounce, the highest
since May 1997. Gold began the year at $279.</TE>
<TE>   In energy markets, oil prices rose for the ninth time in the last
12 trading sessions, lifting February futures in New York to $31.97 a
barrel, up 22 cents. The price now is the highest in almost two
years.</TE>
<TE>   The oil market was riled Tuesday by speculation that U.S. refiners
have dipped into their reserves to compensate for missing barrels
from Venezuela, Bloomberg News reported.</TE>
<TE>   A 4-week-old national strike has kept that nation's refineries
shut. Venezuela is the world's fifth-largest oil exporter and a key
U.S. supplier.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't look like this situation is going to be resolved
anytime soon," said Justin Fohsz, a broker at Starsupply Petroleum
Inc. in Englewood, N.J.</TE>

<HD>High-Tech Displays Vying for Best Picture</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A host of new technologies is competing to make tube-driven
televisions obsolete. Here are three leading candidates:</LD>
<LD>   * Plasma. These panels consist of two glass sheets sandwiching an
array of tiny electrodes and phosphors, which emit colored light when
ignited by current passing through the electrodes. The sets are thin
(less than 4 inches deep) and light enough to hang on a wall,
although they must be wired to a separate receiver to tune in TV
signals.</LD>
<LD>   Screen sizes range from 34 inches to 63 inches diagonally, and
screen resolution ranges from high-definition TV, with 720 horizontal
lines displayed on screen, to something closer to DVD quality, at 480
lines. Even with HDTV-capable plasma panels, the resolution
frequently is less than the best tube-driven sets. Prices start at
$3,000 for a 42-inch screen.</LD>
<TE>   * Liquid crystal. These displays use a semisolid substance encased
in glass to filter beams of light into thousands of tiny points of
color. They're thinner and lighter than plasma displays, and they
tend to last three times as long. But they are smaller and may have
some lingering performance problems, including poor picture quality
when viewed from a sharp angle and less clarity on fast-moving
pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Most units have screen sizes from 15 inches to 22 inches, with
screen resolution in the same range as plasma. Some units have
built-in analog TV receivers. Prices start at $650 for a 17-inch
unit.</TE>
<TE>   * Digital light processing. These sets bounce beams of light off
of microscopic, electronically powered mirrors. Thicker and heavier
than LCDs or plasma displays, DLP sets can't hang on a wall, but they
can be slimmer than competing projection TVs.</TE>
<TE>   Most come equipped with an analog TV receiver. Screen sizes run
from 43 inches to 65 inches, typically with high-definition
resolutions (720 lines). Prices start at about $3,700 for a 43-inch
unit.</TE>

<LD>WorldCom Inc.'s former chief financial officer, Scott D. Sullivan,
once the highest-paid CFO in the U.S., can afford to defend himself
against fraud charges in New York, prosecutors said in urging a judge
not to transfer the case to Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Sullivan has claimed that a Manhattan trial would impose a
financial hardship on him and his family. Sullivan also argued that
Washington was "the only proper venue" because the Securities and

<LD>Electronic Data Systems Corp. won a five-year, $1.3-billion contract

<LD>   The agreement comes 12 days after EDS, the world's second-biggest

from Bank of America Corp. The new contracts eased concern among some
investors that EDS may be unable to vie for big orders.</LD>

Amro fell 9 cents to 15.71, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>

<DH>How we choose to treat animals in our care speaks volumes
about our humanity.</DH>

<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's to the dog. And the cat. And the pig and the caribou and the
iguana and yellowtail tuna and the squabbling neighborhood crows that
will wake me up this morning, as they always do. I'll even include
the horse. My friend Van has remarked, "Nothing that big should be
that stupid."</LD>
<LD>   But today is a day of goodwill, and mine goes to animals this
year, horses too.</LD>
<LD>   I am by no means original in advancing the belief that our regard
for animals is a measure of our humanity.</LD>
<TE>   Milan Kundera, the Czech writer, put it this way: "Mankind's true
moral test, its fundamental test (which lies deeply buried from
view), consists of its attitude toward those who are at its mercy:
animals."</TE>
<TE>   So cheers, creatures. Times are good for animals. But we travel a
two-hearted river. Times are bad too.</TE>
<TE>   In his famous and subversive book "Animal Farm," George Orwell
wrote: "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than
others." Never were his words so pertinent.</TE>
<TE>   On one hand, civilization is becoming decidedly more civilized.
Some cultures have advanced the proposition that animals have rights
in their dealings with us, beginning with the right to have their
suffering recognized and eased. I think it's safe to say that animals
have never had so many eager defenders as they do now.</TE>
<TE>   Germany this year granted animals a constitutional right to
respect. Compare that with just over a century ago, when German
philosopher Friedrich Nietzche proposed: "Animals know nothing of
themselves, and they also know nothing of the world."</TE>
<TE>   Almost every member of the U.S. Congress now has a staffer
responsible for animal issues. A decade ago you would have seldom
heard of such a thing.</TE>
<TE>   With the rise of the anti-hunting movement, we have finally seen
the birth of an introspective ethical hunting movement. Five of six
pro-animal ballot measures succeeded last month in state elections.
Cities across the U.S. are being asked to rewrite municipal codes to
strike the word "owner" and replace it with pet "guardian."</TE>
<TE>   "We have moved from ridicule to serious discussion," says Wayne
Pacelle, the Humane Society executive who is one of the nation's
foremost voices for animals.</TE>
<TE>   And why should it be different? Animals have always given us more
than they've taken. In being, animals prove their being-ness.</TE>
<TE>   As mysterious as the heavens is the bond that formed long ago
between human and dog. The truest friend that some people will have
this Christmas is snoozing underfoot. And more curious still are
these two cats, Nick and Nora, who share my home for reasons neither
they nor I can fully comprehend.</TE>
<TE>   "From the oyster to the eagle, from the swine to the tiger, all
animals are to be found in men and each of them exists in some man,
sometimes several at a time. Animals are nothing but the portrayal of
our virtues and vices made manifest to our eyes, the visible
reflections of our souls," said Victor Hugo. He was mistaken, of
course, but we've all entertained such thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   When I lived in Africa, I could see myself, my family, friends and
colleagues in every passing troop of bickering, bellyaching, joyous
baboons. If we allow, animals will keep us humble.</TE>
<TE>   The other part of the story about animals, the ignominy of it, we
continue to turn our heads from. Even as it gets worse. There are no
meaningful rights, no joy, no pity and no hope in the cramped, dark
barnyards of industrial ranching. Oh please, you say, not today, not
this day. OK. I know what you mean. I'll go easy.</TE>
<TE>   But I want to make note of a book I just read. It's called
"Dominion," and the author is Matthew Scully, who also is a
speechwriter for President Bush. It is the bill of particulars and
the indictment of our society for the needless and often thoughtless
cruelty that we inflict on animals for our food, sport and otherwise.
It's powerful evidence of what happens when people in surprising
places start believing in their campaign promises about conservatism
with heart.</TE>
<TE>   Animal welfare "is not just a moral problem to be solved in
statutes, but a moral opportunity to fill our own lives with acts of
compassion," Scully writes.</TE>
<TE>   In 50 years, we will look back with shame at what "Dominion"
catalogs. I say that because the big hamburger chains have set the
first marketplace standards to restore some sanity to livestock and
poultry agriculture. The corner has been turned, even if there are
many miles to go.</TE>
<TE>   So happy holiday to all the beasts, us too. Let's recall the words
of Albert Schweitzer, who wrote a prayer: "for animals that are
overworked, underfed and cruelly treated; for all wistful creatures
in captivity that beat their wings against bars; for any that are
hunted or lost or deserted or frightened or hungry; for all that must
be put to death ... and for those who deal with them we ask a heart
of compassion and gentle hands and kindly words."</TE>

<HD>A Hard Line in the Sand With N. Korea</HD>
<DH>Force the North to make decisions about its future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael O'Hanlon</AU>
<BD>Michael O'Hanlon is a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The United States, together with its key regional allies South Korea
and Japan, needs a new North Korea policy. And we need it fast, well
before completing what is now a probable war against Saddam Hussein
in Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   When entering office, the Bush team was right to want to revise
the Clinton administration approach, which had its early successes
but allowed North Korea to become too prone to demand large sums of
money for not doing things like missile development that it should
not have been doing anyway.</LD>
<LD>   But the Bush policy has been too unthinkingly hard line from the
start, and now the U.S. is in a dilemma.</LD>
<TE>   Refusing to deal with the Kim Jong Il regime until it comes clean
on all nuclear activities appears to be a failing strategy. Having
just removed monitors and seals from its stock of waste fuel
primarily produced before 1994, North Korea is now in a position to
add to its arsenal of one or two bombs by quickly producing perhaps
half a dozen more. A preemptive military strike, such as the one the
Clinton team threatened against a related facility in 1994, is
probably not feasible against the spent fuel because it would release
large amounts of radioactivity.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is right that a hard-line policy is
needed. But it is wrong to think that being hard line precludes
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and its allies need the kind of tough, unflinching
diplomatic strategy that Ronald Reagan used with the Soviet Union in
the 1980s. That is the way to regain the upper hand with North Korea
without simply encouraging a vicious cycle of additional extortionate
demands from Pyongyang.</TE>
<TE>   What should the tough U.S. demands involve? The Bush
administration was onto something when it stated, early in 2001, that
North Korea would need to reduce its threatening conventional force
posture if it wished more aid and diplomatic relations with the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Although its nuclear and missile programs constitute the more
immediate threat, North Korea's conventional forces are unacceptably
large and dangerous. They could produce tens of thousands of
casualties in Seoul through artillery attack alone. They gobble up to
25% of North Korea's feeble gross domestic product, meaning that any
policy leaving them intact would preclude any hope for gradual
economic reform.</TE>
<TE>   As such, Seoul, Tokyo and Washington should propose a grand
bargain: Pyongyang would come clean on its nuclear programs, shutting
down and allowing on-site inspections of its uranium enrichment
facilities and resealing unprocessed plutonium immediately. It would
stop selling missiles abroad and ban all flight testing of
longer-range missiles as well. It would let all Japanese kidnap
victims and their families leave North Korea. And it would make large
cuts in conventional forces as well as reductions in its
forward-deployed military capabilities near the demilitarized zone.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, South Korea, Japan and the U.S. would provide
substantial economic aid; for now, they would also keep food as well
as fuel oil flowing on humanitarian grounds and as a show of good
faith. Japan is eventually expected to provide up to $10 billion as a
form of compensation for its colonization of North Korea, so much of
the funding could come from Tokyo. We would sign a peace treaty, open
up diplomatic relations and provide technical aid to accompany the
economic aid. South Korea could make at least small conventional
force cuts of its own.</TE>
<TE>   But this offer would be hard line -- Reaganesque -- in an
important way: It would essentially be all or nothing. North Korea
could not get half the aid by making good only on nuclear and missile
programs, for example, because such an approach would reaffirm its
policy of blackmail. By adding conventional forces to the equation,
we would be setting much of the agenda and forcing North Korea to
make fundamental choices about the future nature of the regime and
about economic reform.</TE>
<TE>   This type of policy could work. But the North Koreans are far too
ornery, obstinate and unimaginative to think of it on their own. And
incoming South Korean President Roh Moo Hyun has other things to
think about. That means Washington must act. Now.</TE>

<HD>Holidays Are a Nexus to the Axis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kurt Pitzer</AU>
<BD>Kurt Pitzer is a freelance journalist who covers the
Mideast.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Season's greetings from the "axis of evil." It's snowing lightly, and
in the outskirts of Tehran the cedar trees are dusted with the fine,
white powder that evokes a holiday spirit in many parts of the world.</LD>
<LD>   Here the festivities ended a while ago. City workers have removed
most of the colored lights and other festive decorations from
Tehran's buildings, and since Ramadan culminated with the feast of
Eid on Dec. 6, Tehranis slowly have gotten back to business in
earnest. Most of which is not particularly evil.</LD>
<LD>   The newspapers report the trade talks between Iran and the
European Union, which the government hopes will lead to an end run
around U.S. economic pressure on the Islamic Republic. The Tehran
Times reports that if a war in Iraq triggers oil shortages, Iran will
be able to cash in by boosting oil production by half a million
barrels a day. Readers are assured that Iraqi opposition groups will
not be allowed to use Iranian soil to launch attacks against Saddam
Hussein's forces.</LD>
<TE>   But people are wary of unfolding events. With the threat of war
next door and the U.S. accusing the government of building secret
nuclear facilities, some here fear that Iran could be next in line
after Iraq. So a U.S. citizen here is an interesting, and unusual,
specimen. Intelligence types are certainly curious. They've already
confiscated my cassette recorder and two notebooks, which they are
still poring over, apparently to ensure that I am neither involved in
espionage nor doing advance work for a new James Bond film.</TE>
<TE>   At a pro-reform student demonstration, several mirthless
plainclothes officers closely examined the insoles of my shoes, as
well as my wallet and the strange American bank card with the
horse-and-carriage picture on it. They did not take my fingerprint,
which the government has threatened in retaliation for the U.S. doing
so to visiting Iranians. They videotaped me repeating my name and
confirming that I am from the United States of America. They did not
find it as funny as I did that their cell phone ringer played "Oh
Susanna."</TE>
<TE>   Upon learning that I'm a U.S. citizen, many Iranians ask
unsettling questions: Why has my country never owned up to toppling
their popular leader, Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh, in 1953? Or
apologized for the shooting down of an Iran Air flight over the
Persian Gulf in 1988 that killed 290 people? Why is the
democracy-touting U.S. so uncompromisingly against dialogue with
Iran, which is far more democratic than some U.S. allies in the
region?</TE>
<TE>   Yet these questions usually come over a cup of tea and in a
genuinely conciliatory atmosphere. I have already received several
personal apologies for the embassy hostage crisis nearly a quarter of
a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the spirit of reconciliation goes embarrassingly wrong.
Last week, my new translator, perhaps trying too hard to ingratiate
himself, let out a loud diatribe against the Iranian regime as we
walked along the busy Revolution Square.</TE>
<TE>   "Iran is completely backward," he said, pointing at a group of
women wearing headscarves. "There is no freedom here, for men or for
women!"</TE>
<TE>   With passersby stopping to listen, I felt oddly compelled to
defend the country's merits. "It's true that there are still
inequalities, but Iran holds more elections than the U.S. or any
European country," I ventured, "and more than 50% of Iran's
university students are women. Democracy is beginning from scratch
here."</TE>
<TE>   The translator vigorously disagreed, and the argument continued.</TE>
<TE>   It was an odd role reversal. I peered around anxiously to see if
we were being followed. To my dismay, two uniformed police officers
appeared from out of the crowd. Their first question in Persian was:
"Where are you from?" I didn't lie. "America?" they asked. "Show us
your papers."</TE>
<TE>   Worried, I produced my passport. The taller officer asked in
English: "How do you like Iran?" Fine, I said, it's a lovely country.</TE>
<TE>   "Please, tell your people something," he said, brushing a flake of
snow from my passport as he handed it back. "We welcome you here, any
time."</TE>
<TE>   I thanked him and turned to go, but he grabbed my shoulder to stop
me.</TE>
<TE>   "One more thing," he said, smiling broadly. "Have a happy
Christmas."</TE>

<HD>Tin Pan Alley's Gift</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jody Rosen</AU>
<BD>Jody Rosen is a music critic and author of "White
Christmas: The Story of an American Song" (Scribner, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sixty years ago, American soldiers facing their first holiday season
overseas adopted an unlikely pop song as their wartime anthem.</LD>
<LD>   In the months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. Office of
War Information pestered Tin Pan Alley to produce appropriately
stirring tunes. Under strict government orders, radio stations
bludgeoned Frank Loesser's "Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition"
into popular favor, filling the airwaves dozens of times daily with
its lusty major chords and gung-ho oaths. But the song that captured
the imagination of American GIs -- and knocked Loesser's tune off the
charts -- was a dulcet ballad whose lyrics sketched a Currier and
Ives scene of Christmas on the home front.</LD>
<LD>   Bing Crosby's recording of Irving Berlin's "White Christmas" was a
"Why We Fight" anthem that never mentioned the fight, inciting
patriotism in its most visceral form: homesickness.</LD>
<TE>   Today, "White Christmas" remains a towering fixture of popular
music -- not just the world's biggest Christmas hit, but arguably the
biggest hit, period.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates of total "White Christmas" record sales range from 125
million to 400 million copies. No song has sold more or been more
frequently recorded.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, "White Christmas" is so ubiquitous that we may have
closed our ears to its many surprises and paradoxes. The "White
Christmas" that returns each December as a kind of hymn -- a
sacrosanct icon of the American Christmas -- began its life as
something more impish: a novelty number.</TE>
<TE>   Berlin first conceived the song as a send-up of Hollywood's New
York expatriates, stranded at Christmastime among the swaying palms
of Beverly Hills, a joke that survives in the song's little-known
introductory verse: The sun is shining / The grass is green / The
orange and palm trees sway. / I've never seen such a day / In Beverly
Hills L.A. / But it's December the 24th / And I am longing to be up
North.</TE>
<TE>   Berlin himself spent several winters in Los Angeles working on
movie musicals, and his Christmas song was a variation on a classic
New York sport: a potshot fired at ditzy, sun-dazzled Tinsel Town.
But when Crosby's chorus-only recording turned "White Christmas" into
a monster hit, Berlin ordered the Beverly Hills verse stricken from
its sheet music.</TE>
<TE>   Still, in 1942, Berlin's holiday tune was a novelty. We can
scarcely imagine a time when Christmas songs were not a pop staple,
but before "White Christmas," Americans had looked to previous
centuries for their yuletide music. An original Christmas song had
never before penetrated the Hit Parade.</TE>
<TE>   After "White Christmas," the snowstorm. In the ensuing decade,
songwriters created a new canon of holiday tunes -- "Have Yourself a
Merry Little Christmas," "Silver Bells," "Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer" and many others -- that quickly gained the cultural stature
of Handel's "Messiah" and 19th century carols.</TE>
<TE>   These songs continue to shape our sense of the "traditional
Christmas," arousing fantasies of a yesteryear when the yuletide was
untainted by commerce and jingling bells resounded across
snow-blanketed hillsides.</TE>
<TE>   Few Americans seem to realize that these musical bastions of
old-time holiday spirit were churned out by Tin Pan Alley's hit
factories in the mid-20th century. The song that most elegantly
collapsed Christmas mythology into 32 bars was the creation of the
ultimate song huckster, Irving Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   Here we arrive at another irony: The creator of the Great American
Christmas Carol was neither American-born nor Christian, but a
Russian Jewish immigrant, the son of an orthodox cantor. "White
Christmas" thus stands not just as a symbol of the ad hoc invention
of Christmas "tradition," but of the assimilationist striving behind
the Golden Age of Popular Song, that remarkable era when Jewish
songwriters from Berlin to Kern to Gershwin made a tuneful conquest
of mainstream imagination.</TE>
<TE>   The most surprising aspect of Berlin's song is its melancholy --
the plaintive ache for long-gone Christmases "just like the ones I
used to know" that marks "White Christmas" as the bluest tune ever to
masquerade as a Christmas carol. It is perhaps this more than
anything that accounts for the song's enduring appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Song after chipper song insists that Christmas is a time of
unmitigated merriment, but we know better. Although TV commercials
and sprightly carols promise a return to the hearth-fire glow of the
perfect past, we find ourselves marooned in the present, battling
feelings of disappointment. Who hasn't had the holiday blues?</TE>
<TE>   That seasonal melancholy is captured in "White Christmas": in
Berlin's lyrics, in the mournful tug of its melody, in the spooky
conclusion of Crosby's recording, which does not arrive a valedictory
cadence so much as trail off into the murky gloom.</TE>
<TE>   Deep down we know the gentle sadness of "White Christmas" is
closer to our real holiday experience than the cheer we hear in a
hundred blither, lesser songs.</TE>

<LD>May a scary Christmas ghost visit the National Park Service, for its
ungenerous treatment of David A. Mihalic.</LD>
<LD>   Mihalic is at the peak of his career in the Park Service, the
custodian of the nation's natural and historic treasures. Even so,
he's retiring at 56 to go trout fishing in Montana and to preserve
his personal integrity. It's a courageous move by Mihalic, but
ominous for the integrity of the Park Service. Mihalic is retiring
rather than accept a forced move from his post as superintendent of
Yosemite National Park the last three years to the top job at Great
Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee.</LD>
<LD>   The hitch was that Mihalic's political bosses in Washington wanted
him to work a controversial land exchange in the Smokies and push
through a trans-park highway that had long been opposed by the
National Park Service for its certain environmental damage. The road
plan, shelved in the 1960s, is strongly supported by prominent
Republicans in both states.</LD>
<TE>   What did Mihalic, a veteran of 33 years in federal service, do to
deserve this shove from Washington? He had been picked by a
Democratic administration to do a specific job, to finally put in
place a long-term plan to reduce traffic congestion and pollution in
Yosemite Valley. He succeeded admirably, balancing commercial
activity in the valley with restoration of meadows and other areas
damaged by years of overuse.</TE>
<TE>   The management plan is backed by some, but not all, environmental
groups. It is opposed by surrounding local governments and
tourist-related businesses fearing that fewer day visitors to the
valley would mean empty motel beds and restaurant tables for them. In
fact, it's quite likely to generate more business, with more visitors
staying outside the park.</TE>
<TE>   But the Bush administration has paid special heed to commerce in
park regions, most notably in rolling back a ban on snowmobiles in
Yellowstone National Park because of clamor from snowmobile-related
businesses. A Republican congressional source said of the Mihalic
move, "The director of the National Park Service wants to make sure
the folks in the field are responsive to the central office."</TE>
<TE>   This is a dead-wrong way to manage the parks. The knowledge of
what's good for the parks rests with the David Mihalics of the Park
Service, created to preserve the nation's natural wonders while
allowing them to be enjoyed by the people in a way that leaves them
"unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations."</TE>
<TE>   When Mihalic took over at Yosemite, he told The Times that
Yosemite Valley "is a sacred place and what we do here, we have to do
for the common good." Mihalic fulfilled his mission in that spirit,
the true spirit of the 1916 Park Service act. Thank you for a job
well done, David Mihalic. Happy holidays and good fishing.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles may be known worldwide for its anorexic actors and
fitness junkies. But this infamously contradictory place also has the
state's greatest share of fat and out-of-shape children.</LD>
<LD>   More than one-quarter of California's public schoolchildren are
overweight and nearly 40% are not physically fit, according to a new
study by the nonpartisan California Center for Public Health
Advocacy. Eight of the nine state Assembly districts with the worst
findings are in Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   Kids, like adults, are getting fatter because they're gulping down
super-sized junk food and spending more time sitting in front of TV
and computer screens. Parents need to get their kids to eat less and
move more -- and to set an example by doing so themselves.</LD>
<TE>   But this rapid a rise in the prevalence of overweight children is
also due to larger changes that require more than individual
willpower to fix. Kids today don't play outside after school the way
many of their parents did, for example, because their parks and
neighborhoods aren't safe. (One more reason for Los Angeles Mayor
James K. Hahn and Police Chief William J. Bratton to target the
criminal street gangs that hold these neighborhoods under siege.)</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the state cut physical education requirements in
schools two decades ago -- about the time childhood weight problems
started rising -- after Proposition 13 slashed school funding. Some
schools skimped even more on P.E., boosting class sizes to as high as
80 students. They sought new money in vending machine sales -- of
sugar-loaded soft drinks and junk foods. Many high school cafeterias
came to resemble the local mall's fast-food court.</TE>
<TE>   Nascent movements are underway to reverse these trends. Beginning
in January 2004, the Los Angeles Unified School District will ban
soda sales in schools. The Los Angeles City Council has initiated an
urban park trust with an ambitious goal of creating pocket parks
within walking distance of all city residents. State legislators are
pushing bills to require more nutritional school lunches and to
increase or simply enforce P.E. requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Being overweight and out of shape contribute to diabetes, heart
disease and other illnesses. The costs include steep medical bills,
missed days of work and lives dictated by pills and insulin shots --
if not cut short. Imagine how that toll will rise now that high
cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes are showing up at age
10 or 15, not just at 40 or 50. To prevent this public health
calamity, society will need to develop a dieter's long-term resolve.</TE>

<HD>Unwrapping Memories</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>No doubt the first thing you did today was turn here expecting a
daily dose of dread. Not here. Not today. The holiday season in
general and Christmas in particular are unique moments in our annual
cycle of seasons. Year-end holidays share a common thread: family,
introspection, celebration at completing another year, resolutions
for the next and sharing of the past. The memories of these times
will differ naturally over years, but the happy holiday context
remains constant like an emotional girder.</LD>
<LD>   Can you recall the pure joy of childhood Christmas? Bright lights
everywhere. Intense anticipation. The magic visit with Santa Claus
and its silent rehearsals. The eve's exquisite waiting. The
excitement conjured in the bedroom dark, waiting, maybe sleeping, and
finally the incalculable joy come the hour of dawn -- or possibly the
one before -- at the full-blown, color-lit realization that the red
flannel suit had come. And the same warm family faces were present
again to share.</LD>
<TE>   It's hard sometimes years later to recall the fragrance of such
memories but worth trying. Adults allow so many distractions to
encroach nowayears. The stumbling economy. The "Sale" signs. The
zero-interest, zero-down car deals. They're very nice. But is
something going on we don't know about? There's Washington's
infernal, eternal bickering. The same feuds erupt privately
everywhere, except it's always safer to criticize others from afar
than face our own shortcomings up close. There's talk of smallpox,
which seems anything but small. War is possible, disconcerting,
frightening. Is it our imagination or has "I'll Be Home for
Christmas" played more this year?</TE>
<TE>   Newspaper pages carry regular tales of those who pray and prey. We
witness car chases and drug deals, murders and baby abandonments,
embezzlements and robberies. We hear of inventions and discoveries,
of selfishness and selflessness. And there are since 9/11 more
obvious worries, a greater readiness in public and private to ponder
once-outrageous what-ifs. It's understandable but still distracting.</TE>
<TE>   We were so busy yesterday preparing for today and so tired last
night that we had no energy for excitement, just a need to sleep and
perhaps remember.</TE>
<TE>   Once there was a father and son who, soon after the festivities,
dragged their live Christmas tree to the frontyard. There, with pick
and shovel and tinsel traces still dressing needles, they set the
little tree free to grow. Now, almost 50 holidays later, that retired
Christmas tree towers twice as tall as the house. The father is gone.
So is the tinsel. But not the tree. Nor all those once-new memories
made indoors in front of it on a happy holiday morning not really so
long ago.</TE>
<TE>   It took some effort to excavate that old memory. But that's what
holiday mornings should be for.</TE>

<HD>Death Toll Hits 13 in Bombing in Philippines</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COTABATO, Philippines</DL>
<LD>The death toll rose to 13 from a bomb that exploded Tuesday outside
the home of a small town's mayor, who was among the victims. Twelve
other people were wounded.</LD>
<LD>   The military said it suspected a Muslim separatist group, but the
organization denied that it was involved.</LD>
<LD>   Datu Piang Mayor Saudie Ampatuan died of injuries to his head and
abdomen. A town councilor, the treasurer and a bodyguard also were
among those killed, said an army spokesman, Maj. Julieto Ando.</LD>
<TE>   Ando said suspicion fell on the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, a
rebel group fighting for self-rule. The Philippines is predominantly
Christian, but it has a large Muslim minority, mostly in the
impoverished, isolated south.</TE>
<TE>   Ando said a witness reported seeing a follower of the Islamic
group planting the bomb, which was apparently a remote-controlled
mortar.</TE>
<TE>   But rebel spokesman Eid Kabalu denied involvement, saying the
mayor had many personal and political enemies.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no reason for us to do that, because the mayor is not
our enemy," Kabalu said. "In fact, many of those injured are my
relatives."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the victims were Muslims.</TE>

<LD>   His birth "is a sign of hope for the whole human family; a sign of
peace for those suffering from conflicts of every kind; a sign of
freedom for the poor and oppressed; a sign of mercy for those caught
up in the vicious circle of sin; a sign of love and consolation for
those who feel lonely and abandoned," the pope told a crowd gathered

<LD>High winds are driving a massive oil slick from the sunken tanker
Prestige toward French waters, meaning France and Spain may soon have
to fight together against the ecological disaster, Spanish officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   Spanish media have estimated the cluster of oil slicks as covering
an area the size of New York City. Fuel oil continued to wash ashore
in Spain while cleanup vessels suctioned oil off the ocean surface.</LD>
<LD>   The tanker's split hull continues to leak, even though a mini-sub
has plugged some of the cracks.</LD>

<HD>Disgraced Cadre Wants His Good Name Back</HD>
<DH>Zhou Wei has sued five Chinese media outlets for impugning
efforts to root out corruption that he undertook in the spirit of Mao
Tse-tung.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Chu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Zhou Wei has the rare distinction of having been excommunicated by
the Communist Party twice.</LD>
<LD>   The first time, he was a model cadre who became a target of Mao
Tse-tung's 1957 "anti-rightist campaign," a ruthless crackdown on
suspected counterrevolutionaries. Then only 26, Zhou suddenly found
himself stripped of his party membership and banished to the
countryside for more than two decades.</LD>
<LD>   His lot changed in 1979, when victims of the campaign were
rehabilitated under Deng Xiaoping. Welcomed back into the party fold,
Zhou went on to an exemplary career as a cadre at a factory in
northeastern China, where he worked hard to realize Deng's dream of
"socialism with Chinese characteristics."</LD>
<TE>   But chances for a happy ending evaporated four years ago. By then,
the fiery Zhou had become a thorn in the side of local authorities
for doing exactly what the central government says ought to be done:
rooting out official sleaze.</TE>
<TE>   Through protests, petitions and trips to Beijing, Zhou and other
party stalwarts in the rust-belt city of Shenyang demanded better
treatment for retirees, farmers and workers and helped unearth a
massive scam that has so far resulted in the imprisonment of the
mayor and the execution of his deputy.</TE>
<TE>   For his zeal as an anti-corruption crusader, an idealist still
committed to the principles of his youth, Zhou was kicked out of the
party a second time, locked up in a labor camp and painted in the
media as a self-aggrandizing, unscrupulous demagogue.</TE>
<TE>   Now out of custody, Zhou, 71, wants his good name back -- and he's
gone to court to get it.</TE>
<TE>   "A lie is a lie," he said emphatically before hearings on his
libel and defamation suit opened here this month. "Chinese law
protects a person's privacy and reputation, so we want to use the law
as a weapon to fight back."</TE>
<TE>   His legal battle with five media outlets is the latest twist in a
remarkable story that highlights how much things have turned upside
down in the world's last communist giant.</TE>
<TE>   Once, veterans of the revolution like Zhou were hailed as the
country's saviors, and hard-working cadres were considered China's
lifeblood. Once, peasants and workers were the masters of an
egalitarian utopia in the making.</TE>
<TE>   But now, yesterday's heroes are personae non gratae, and former
"class enemies," such as entrepreneurs, are the darlings of society
as today's Chinese ditch notions of equality in favor of oceans of
wealth.</TE>
<TE>   Few have enriched themselves as diligently, and as dishonestly, as
the scads of local officials willing to use their positions to make a
buck or two -- or much, much more -- through bribery, graft and
fraud. Corruption scandals across China are legion.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the scams in Shenyang, a provincial capital and one of
China's largest cities, have raised eyebrows both for their scope and
for an investigation that has so far netted scores of top officials,
including a dozen municipal department heads.</TE>
<TE>   The various illegal schemes included a land grab that dispossessed
hundreds of peasant farmers and a local bank that collapsed, wiping
out nearly $1 billion in depositors' savings.</TE>
<TE>   Zhou and others were outraged as they watched officials buy fancy
cars, cavort with karaoke club hostesses and betray the ideals -- and
downtrodden people -- the old-timers had fought for. Weaned on
concepts of social justice and public morality, hundreds of
Shenyang's 20,000 retired Communist Party cadres began gathering once
a week in a park to air their grievances and plan marches on City
Hall.</TE>
<TE>   At first, in 1995, their demands focused on their own concerns --
retirement benefits such as pensions and health care promised by the
state but increasingly curtailed.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, however, their modest successes inspired others to come
looking for them -- and especially Zhou, who became the group's
ringleader. Sundays in the park with Zhou turned into political
meetings where all sorts of complaints about official malfeasance
surfaced -- and where these grizzled veterans of the revolution
decided to take up causes besides their own, on behalf of others left
behind by the changes sweeping society.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a question of one's outlook on life. We were trained
under 'Mao Tse-tung Thought.' We may have been kids when we joined
the revolution, but we did it to rescue the Chinese nation and to
save the Chinese people from suffering more calamity," said Zhou, who
enlisted in the People's Liberation Army as a 16-year-old in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   "Our philosophy was: 'First help others. Then help ourselves.'
Now, in this society, if we see people suffering, can we just stand
by?"</TE>
<TE>   The local authorities did not appreciate the irony in Zhou's
invocation of old communist ideals as a call to action against the
new batch of cadres.</TE>
<TE>   The police began bugging Zhou's telephone and even followed him on
his journeys to Beijing, where he frequently went to present
petitions. After returning to Shenyang from one such trip in spring
1998, he was detained by the local public security bureau for 15
days. Later that year, the party he had joined half a century earlier
booted him.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of the harassment, Zhou and the other old stalwarts
soldiered on.</TE>
<TE>   Exasperated, the local government finally had Zhou arrested in May
1999 and threw him into a nearby labor camp, where he remained for
two years.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a political prisoner, but they put me together with common
criminals," he said.</TE>
<TE>   While in custody, Inmate No. 297 refused to cooperate. Zhou would
not admit to any wrongdoing. He continued to write protest letters,
along with a report on the horrendous conditions in the camp, which
had no bathing facilities and gave the prisoners deer feed to eat.</TE>
<TE>   On the outside, his cronies agitated for Zhou's release.</TE>
<TE>   "We asked for permission for 1,000 old cadres to protest," said
Yuan Chongzhi, 71. "They refused. There's a law allowing freedom of
demonstration and association, but it's a lie."</TE>
<TE>   Even as Zhou sat in prison, government inspectors were vindicating
his cause. In October 1999, Shenyang Vice Mayor Ma Xiangdong was
arrested on suspicion of corruption. His boss, Mayor Mu Suixin, was
arrested in June 2001. Both men were subsequently convicted and
ordered put to death. Mu's execution was suspended, but Ma's sentence
was quickly carried out.</TE>
<TE>   In all, more than 80 officials have been caught in the dragnet.
According to Zhou, many more remain unpunished and in positions of
power awarded to them by their disgraced superiors.</TE>
<TE>   Zhou was released from the labor camp in April 2001, a few weeks
before his sentence was up. But, feisty to the last, he refused to
leave unless the authorities acknowledged that he had been wrongfully
incarcerated.</TE>
<TE>   They declined. Eight officers had to drag Zhou out.</TE>
<TE>   "I was put in prison by the police," he said, "and I was taken out
of prison by the police."</TE>
<TE>   To add insult to injury, a Shenyang newspaper then published a
scathing article about him on its Web site and encouraged other media
to do the same. China's top two Internet portals followed suit, as
did one of Beijing's most popular dailies, which accused Zhou of
inciting unrest, making inflated claims about his role as a
whistle-blower and even fathering a child out of wedlock when he was
a young man.</TE>
<TE>   Those outlets are among the five media organizations Zhou has sued
for libel.</TE>
<TE>   Zhou harbors no hope of recovering the research files and personal
belongings that police took from him. He is also doubtful whether his
retirement benefits will be honored, even though health care is all
the more urgent for him now that he has stomach cancer.</TE>
<TE>   But the man hailed by some Chinese newspapers as an
"anti-corruption hero" is optimistic about having his reputation
restored by Beijing's courts, far from Shenyang.</TE>
<TE>   And not only that: Zhou wants his membership in the Communist
Party reinstated.</TE>
<TE>   For all he's been through, Zhou remains loyal to the organization
that expelled him twice, that has embraced its former enemies and
that has turned its back on many of those who helped bring it to
power in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   A few very rotten apples, Zhou says, don't represent the orchard.</TE>
<TE>   "I still believe in communism," he said in an interview in the
tiny Beijing dormitory room where he was staying.</TE>
<TE>   There, his friends say, police from Shenyang would be less likely
to find him.</TE>

<HD>Cause of Crash in Iran Unclear</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TEHRAN</DL>
<LD>Iranian aviation officials Tuesday blamed pilot error for a plane
crash that killed European scientists traveling to Iran, then
retracted the statement after Ukraine's government protested.</LD>
<LD>   The Ukrainian-built Antonov-140 aircraft flew into a mountainside
while preparing to land Monday at an airport near the city of
Esfahan, about 220 miles south of Tehran, killing everyone aboard.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the estimated 46 people killed were Russian and Ukrainian
aerospace scientists and executives flying to Iran to watch the first
flight of a new plane developed in a joint Ukrainian-Iranian program.</LD>
<TE>   The control tower blamed the crash on pilot error, state-run
Tehran radio reported Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The pilot's carelessness caused the plane to hit a mountain and
crash near Ardestan," the report said, referring to a town near
Esfahan.</TE>
<TE>   But aviation officials later backpedaled, telling Iranian media
outlets that it was too early to blame pilot error.</TE>
<TE>   "The definite cause of the crash will be announced after experts
study" data recordings, Iranian television said.</TE>
<TE>   No reason was given for the retraction, which was issued a few
hours after Ukraine's government denounced the initial version of
events.</TE>
<TE>   An official at Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industries said the
test flight would go ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Ukrainian President Leonid D. Kuchma offered his condolences to
the victims' families.</TE>

<DL>GARDEZ, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>When a huge U.S.-led attack sent the Taliban packing, tractor driver
Gullajan hoped that peace and prosperity would follow even in his
remote and unsettled corner of this war-ravaged nation.</LD>
<LD>   He is still waiting.</LD>
<LD>   "The Americans are here for the good of us, but they have done
nothing yet," said Gullajan, a 22-year-old laborer who, like many
Afghans, goes by one name. "It's just the same, only less safe. The
roads are still totally ruined, and I am afraid that someone will
come and steal my tractor out from under me."</LD>
<TE>   Gardez, a former Taliban stronghold about 60 miles south of the
capital, Kabul, is an especially apt place to gauge how the United
States is viewed from Afghanistan. People are glad the Taliban are
gone and generally see U.S. intentions as positive.</TE>
<TE>   But there is growing disillusionment over America's failure to
make a difference in people's daily lives. New schools, roads and
clinics haven't materialized, nor have the economic good times many
hoped for from the U.S.-backed regime of President Hamid Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   This city of about 200,000 lies in the center of Paktia province
in eastern Afghanistan, a region the U.S admits is still far from
pacified. It sits astride the escape route that many Taliban and Al
Qaeda members used to leave Kabul for the Pakistani border. One of
the most important Al Qaeda redoubts was the Shahi Kot valley, just
25 miles southeast of here.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the region was heavily bombed in late 2001 and during
the Anaconda offensive in March. At least five times, U.S. pilots
mistakenly bombed civilians, causing dozens of deaths and much
anti-Americanism.</TE>
<TE>   Remnants of the Taliban and Al Qaeda who fled east to the
mountains continue to make mischief with rocket attacks and ambushes.
So do warlords who came with the victorious U.S.-backed Northern
Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   Highway bandits in the guise of toll takers are so common that
taxi drivers have refused to pay the government license fees until
security is improved.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans are here for a good reason. But they have been here a
year, and what have they done? They have brought people to power who
have always been thieves," said Dr. Dad Mohammed, an internist.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the dangers, humanitarian agencies are reluctant to set
up operations, so relief and reconstruction have been slower than in
other parts of Afghanistan. The U.N. closed its doors after two
grenades were thrown into its compound Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Many blame the Americans for doing nothing to alleviate the lack
of security. Walid, a merchant who wanted neither his last name nor
his business identified, said disillusionment is setting in just as
it did under various Afghan governments and during the Russian
occupation.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the patient who takes a tablet but doesn't recover,
another tablet and doesn't recover, and at the end you hate all kinds
of medicine," Walid said.</TE>
<TE>   Many contrast Gardez's lawlessness with Taliban times, when there
was public order, even though it was oppressive. And there is
lingering resentment about the bombing errors.</TE>
<TE>   "The bombings caused a lot of ill feelings, to the point that
everything bad in the town is ascribed by some people to the
Americans," said Khaled Ahmad, a video store owner and repairman who
is back in business after five years during which the Taliban forbade
TV and videos. "But for people to come in here and say the Americans
want to conquer our country is not right. I hope they do a true
rehabilitation. They have already built one school, and they will do
much more."</TE>
<TE>   Raz Mohammed Dalili, appointed governor of Paktia in July by
Karzai, says the U.S. military, which maintains a special-forces base
outside town, has made amends for the bombings with apologies and
payments to victims' families.</TE>
<TE>   "People will really begin to be very cooperative once they see
reconstruction take place," Dalili said, adding that nine rebuilding
projects are planned.</TE>
<TE>   A visit by coalition commander Lt. Gen. Dan K. McNeill to speak to
Gardez's tribal council also helped soothe passions. The U.S. now
shares information with the council and a separate military council
in an effort to avoid mistakes, Dalili said.</TE>
<TE>   At Karzai's urging, the U.S. Army selected Gardez as the first
site for a reconstruction program to begin this month. It's designed
to create jobs and get projects rolling quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Col. Phil Maughan, commanding officer of the Army's civil
assistance brigade, said Gardez was chosen because of aid groups'
reluctance to work here and elsewhere in eastern Afghanistan. The
program will involve up to 70 soldiers: 50 reconstruction personnel
and 20 combat troops to protect them.</TE>
<TE>   Maughan can attest to the region's insecurity. His staff's motor
convoy was attacked by a remote-controlled bomb last month. There
have also been "continual" rocket attacks on the U.S. base near
Gardez, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people don't want us to be there. There is a lot of
Afghan-on-Afghan, between-the-warlords fighting going on. We'll ...
try to make it an area where small aid agencies will want to start
doing stuff in Gardez and expand out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But winning hearts and minds will take time in this city.
Recently, the entire populace seemed to know that five cars had been
stolen this month, something that they said never would have happened
under the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Col. Abdul Samed, a local military leader, emphasized the need for
schools and improvements to the water supply in the wake of a
four-year drought.</TE>
<TE>   "What good does it do us to have new bridges and new highways if
we don't have anything to eat?" he asked. "And what good does it do
us to have new books and magazines when we can't read?"</TE>
<TE>   Said Dad Mohammed: "Americans are our last hope for reconstructing
the country. But so far that hope has given no results."</TE>

<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Loitering in the incense-scented shadows of the Church of the
Nativity, the pale, bearded young Palestinian was no ordinary tourist
or pilgrim.</LD>
<LD>   A fugitive from Israeli authorities, he was visiting the
fortress-like basilica for the first time since spring, when,
together with dozens of Palestinian militants, clerics and peace
activists, he spent 39 days holed up inside the ancient church, built
on the spot where tradition says Jesus was born.</LD>
<LD>   On Christmas Eve, as muted holiday celebrations began in
Bethlehem, the 26-year-old gunman, a Christian born and raised in
this West Bank town just south of Jerusalem, felt safe enough to come
back for a second -- if wary -- look.</LD>
<TE>   Between clandestine meetings with friends, family and associates,
he was spending most of his brief visit inside the church, where he
said he felt secure, despite all that had happened there.</TE>
<TE>   "This place was part of my childhood, my growing up -- I was
baptized here," said the gunman, who would allow only his first name,
George, to be used for publication. "Not for a single moment did I
feel I was not entitled to shelter here."</TE>
<TE>   What made it possible for him to slip back into Bethlehem for
Christmas was the fact that Israel, in deference to the holiday and
under international pressure, had pulled its troops back to positions
at the edge of town and declared that worshipers were free to enter.</TE>
<TE>   But Palestinian Christians, in protest of the continuing military
hold on their city -- and the fact that they expected the army to
again impose tight curfews on Bethlehem's 28,000 Palestinians as soon
as the holiday is over -- pointedly refrained from any actions that
would appear overtly celebratory.</TE>
<TE>   The giant Christmas tree that normally adorns Manger Square was
missing. The usual parade did not take place. Displays of Christmas
lights and decorations on Palestinian homes were discouraged.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just a short respite for us," said the Rev. Mitri Raheb,
the Palestinian pastor of Bethlehem's Lutheran Christmas Church,
nodding toward the shoppers in the crowded central market who were
buying spices and vegetables. "Soon we will be prisoners in our homes
again."</TE>
<TE>   In public, only the strictly religious elements of the holiday
were observed. The Latin patriarch, the highest-ranking Roman
Catholic cleric in the Holy Land, led a traditional procession of
churchmen and seminarians into Bethlehem and through the low door
that leads into the basilica.</TE>
<TE>   Later, the patriarch presided over the traditional Christmas Eve
Midnight Mass, with far fewer dignitaries in attendance than in past
years. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, banned from Bethlehem for a
second straight year by the Israelis, sent a delegation led by his
chief negotiator, Saeb Erekat. Arafat, who has been confined for
months to his battered compound in the West Bank city of Ramallah, 12
miles away, bitterly protested his exclusion.</TE>
<TE>   The latest Israeli incursion into Bethlehem, the third since the
siege of the Church of the Nativity in April and May, followed a bus
bombing in Jerusalem that was carried out by a suicide attacker from
Bethlehem. Eleven Israelis were killed, and dozens were hurt.</TE>
<TE>   In a pattern that has been in force throughout the West Bank for
months, a Palestinian city, town or refugee camp from which a serious
attack against Israelis originates is likely to feel the
repercussions for many weeks to come.</TE>
<TE>   Israel says the continuing encirclement of Bethlehem by troops and
tanks is due to intelligence information pointing to the threat of
more terror attacks, and it insists that the town remains a
stronghold of Palestinian militant groups.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians familiar with the events of the church siege said
George was among the gunmen who were there the entire time.</TE>
<TE>   George openly acknowledged his membership in the Al Aqsa Martyrs
Brigade, a militia linked to Arafat's Fatah faction that has been a
driving force behind the nearly 27-month-old intifada, or uprising.
The group has been responsible for many attacks on Israelis,
including shootings and suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   Like many other young Palestinian men in Bethlehem, Christians as
well as Muslims, George took up arms against the Israelis during a
sweeping offensive throughout the West Bank in April that was brought
on by a wave of suicide attacks. He was one of a group of gunmen who
ran into the church compound when Israeli troops and armored vehicles
approached Manger Square, in the heart of the city.</TE>
<TE>   The siege trapped nearly 200 people inside the church, including
the gunmen, plus monks, priests and, later, peace activists who
pushed their way inside.</TE>
<TE>   George, who is from a well-known Bethlehem family, spoke of the
cold, hunger and fear that plagued them all, but also of the comfort
he drew from the familiar surroundings -- the Grotto of the Nativity,
the cave-like enclosure beneath the thick foundation stones; the
candlelit basilica; the courtyards and corridors of adjoining
monasteries.</TE>
<TE>   He pointed out the cistern-like enclosure where those trapped
inside elected to store the decomposing bodies of two dead gunmen
before priests were finally allowed to carry them outside, and the
spot where a fellow gunman was shot in front of him by an Israeli
sniper.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to die," George recalled his comrade telling him as
he bled to death. In all, eight people were killed in and around the
church during the standoff.</TE>
<TE>   As he spoke, a young monk brushed past and recognized him with a
start, a wanted man in broad daylight. "Be careful!" the monk
whispered.</TE>
<TE>   George was not among those who were sent into exile overseas or to
the Gaza Strip as part of the settlement that ended the siege, but he
said the Israelis warned him at the time that he was a marked man,
subject to arrest or worse if they found him. The Israeli military
refuses to discuss the status of Palestinian militants it is hunting.</TE>
<TE>   The basilica and its surrounding compound, filthy and
stench-ridden by the siege's end on May 10, now look much as before,
save for pockmarks left by bullets.</TE>
<TE>   Before the start of Midnight Mass, clerics said they hoped the
first celebration of Christmas since the siege would help put
memories of it to rest.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though there are no displays of joy this Christmas, we are
privileged to celebrate it once again inside these walls," said
Father Giovanni Batticelli, the regional superior of the Franciscan
order.</TE>
<TE>   George had a holiday reunion with his wife and child, but he
wondered how long he could sustain himself in hiding elsewhere in the
West Bank. He planned to slip out of Bethlehem as soon as there was
any sign that Israelis were preparing to move back into the city
center.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, he said, an officer of Israel's Shin Bet, the
domestic intelligence agency, obtained his mobile phone number and
called to tell him to give himself up or prepare to die.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll find you -- I'll catch you," he said the Israeli officer
promised him. "You're like a dead person already. How long can you
run?"</TE>

<HD>A Game of Risk With North Korea</HD>
<DH>A new, uncompromising U.S. stand as the regime moves to
restart its nuclear program could prove catastrophic, critics say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Richter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In years of confrontations with North Korea, it was almost always the
Americans who blinked.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. leaders believed that a regime that would starve its people,
assassinate foreign leaders and risk war through military
provocations could not be rational and had to be placated with
concessions.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the Bush administration faces a deepening crisis with a new
attitude: Pyongyang's leaders are sane and, under pressure, will
realize that they must give up their nuclear program and illicit arms
trade if they want their government to survive.</LD>
<TE>   This view marks a revolution in official U.S. thinking about a
regime that some people consider the most dangerous in the world.</TE>
<TE>   And it explains why the White House has been able to look on with
seeming serenity in recent days as North Korea has taken step after
step toward restarting a nuclear program that was halted in 1994 by a
U.S.-brokered aid deal.</TE>
<TE>   "They've turned the old philosophy on its head," said L. Gordon
Flake, executive director of the Mansfield Center for Pacific
Affairs, a research organization in Washington. Administration
officials believe that North Korean leaders "are rational to the
point that they wouldn't do anything that would risk suicide ... and
we can ratchet the pressure up as much as we want."</TE>
<TE>   However, he added, if the administration's analysis is incorrect,
the results could be catastrophic.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're wrong, they're going to be incredibly wrong," Flake
said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the clearest example of the traditional U.S. view is the
1994 Agreed Framework, an international energy aid package that was
worked out when the Clinton administration confronted circumstances
very much like those in place today.</TE>
<TE>   Amid signs that Pyongyang was forging ahead with a nuclear
program, the Clinton administration considered putting various kinds
of pressure on North Korea. President Clinton even thought seriously
about a military strike on the country's nuclear facilities.</TE>
<TE>   But officials feared that if backed into a corner, North Korea's
Stalinist regime could respond by unleashing an artillery attack on
Seoul -- the South Korean capital, only about 35 miles from the
border with the North -- that could conceivably kill hundreds of
thousands of people in the first few hours. Although the United
States knew it could eventually win any war on the Korean peninsula,
it could not accept the losses that were likely in the opening stages
of such a conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "The tolerance of risk was always much lower on our side," Flake
said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the 1994 deal, the North Koreans were promised supplies of
fuel oil and construction of two civilian light-water reactors to
produce energy if they suspended work on reactors and a reprocessing
plant that were suspected of being part of a covert nuclear weapons
program. They weren't required to provide proof that they had
dismantled the program, thus keeping alive the option of restarting
it at a later date.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the impoverished country continued to receive
supplies of food from international donors, including the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   But President Bush, who in his most recent State of the Union
address described North Korea as one of three members of an "axis of
evil," made it clear that he was offended by this approach. From the
earliest days of his administration, U.S. officials have described
North Korea's efforts as intolerable "blackmail diplomacy."</TE>
<TE>   When North Korea revealed two months ago that it was pursuing a
nuclear program in violation of the 1994 deal, U.S. officials said
they were prepared to offer Pyongyang no new incentives to halt the
program again, and they insisted that any new negotiations must come
on U.S. terms.</TE>
<TE>   This week, as North Korea removed U.N. surveillance cameras from
its nuclear complex and took steps to resume production of nuclear
materials, U.S. officials renewed their denunciations of North Korean
"blackmail" attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld warned the North Koreans on
Monday that the United States could win any war on the Korean
peninsula, even if U.S. forces were fighting Iraq at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, monitors at the International Atomic Energy Agency in
Vienna reported that the North Koreans were continuing their efforts
to restart the program by beginning to try to repair a nuclear
research reactor and completing their efforts to unseal a facility
used to reprocess spent nuclear fuel rods.</TE>
<TE>   State-controlled media quoted defense official Kim Il Chol as
saying that the U.S. was putting the peninsula on the "brink of a
nuclear war" and that its policy toward the North could result in "an
uncontrollable catastrophe."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have made it clear that, united with key Asian
countries, they can apply powerful economic and diplomatic pressure
to make Pyongyang give in. North Korea badly needs trade, and
one-third of its population may die this year without international
food aid, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Although analysts do not believe that a nuclear-armed North Korea
would necessarily lead to war in the short term, it could set off a
spiraling arms race in an already heavily armed region and increase
the spread of weapons technologies around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say that so far, the U.S. efforts to build a diplomatic
wall around North Korea have been successful -- in large part because
North Korea's moves have frightened neighbors, who have stampeded
into the U.S. camp.</TE>
<TE>   In the new environment, Japan's talk of paying war reparations to
North Korea has disappeared, said Flake, of the research group.</TE>
<TE>   Flake said that most South Koreans want their government to be
cautious in its approach to North Korea, even though the election
this month of human rights lawyer Roh Moo Hyun as president was
widely taken as a sign of public desire for continued contacts with
the North.</TE>
<TE>   China and Russia have expressed displeasure with North Korea's
actions concerning its nuclear program and appear willing to take
part in U.S. efforts to cut off the North's illicit trade in
missiles, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, they've been remarkably on board," Flake said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAHORE, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>A Pakistani court issued an order Tuesday blocking the extradition of
three Al Qaeda suspects arrested in a joint raid by local authorities
and the FBI.</LD>
<LD>   The court also ordered prosecutors to explain the charges.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling by the Lahore High Court came in response to a motion
filed by lawyers for two naturalized Americans and one Canadian
arrested with six relatives in a raid Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Although no extradition warrant had been issued for the men,
Pakistan has extradited other terrorism suspects to the U.S. in the
last year. Last week's raid sparked a series of protests in Lahore
against the involvement of FBI agents.</TE>
<TE>   The two Americans, identified as Umer Karar Khawaja and Khyzer Ali
Khawaja, and the Canadian, Usman Khawaja, were being questioned about
suspected links to the Al Qaeda terrorist network, a prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   The presiding judge set a hearing for Friday for prosecutors to
detail the charges against the relatives still in custody. They
included Dr. Javed Ahmad, a U.S. citizen and prominent physician in
Pakistan.</TE>

<HD>Ferocious Guatemalan Prison Riot Leaves 18 Inmates Dead</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GUATEMALA CITY</DL>
<LD>Rioting inmates at a jail outside Guatemala's capital decapitated a
fellow prisoner and burned 14 others to death, authorities said. In
all, 18 inmates died during two days of unrest.</LD>
<LD>   At least 30 others were seriously injured when hundreds of inmates
began rioting to demand more visiting rights and the dismissal of
guards, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Maximum-security prisoners first staged a small uprising late
Monday, seizing part of the 1,228-inmate Pavoncito prison. One
prisoner was killed.</LD>
<TE>   A group of prisoners later captured Julio Beteta, an inmate who
police say controlled drug and weapons distribution within the
prison. Inmates used makeshift knives and machetes to decapitate
Beteta, said Emilio Najera, a fire department spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The decapitation touched off a bloody battle between several
inmate factions, and prisoners began using machetes to seize control
of different parts of the prison.</TE>
<TE>   Members of one gang rounded up 14 prisoners from another gang who
were injured, doused them with gasoline and set them on fire, Najera
said. All 14 died.</TE>
<TE>   Police in riot gear then stormed the prison and restored order
early Tuesday. Police Director Raul Manchame said no prisoners
escaped during the uprising.</TE>
<TE>   Two inmates injured during clashes with police died at a hospital
after authorities ended the riot.</TE>

if fair, would expose American "lies" and prove that Iraq is free of
weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   In a Christmas Eve message read on state television, he also said
that an "American-Zionist campaign" was being launched and that the
threat of a large-scale military campaign was growing.</LD>
<LD>   He questioned whether a U.N. Security Council resolution to disarm
Iraq would proceed as intended.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile Tuesday, weapons inspectors in Baghdad interviewed a
senior nuclear scientist, who told them that Iraq has nothing to
hide. They also checked at least seven suspect sites, going farther
south from the capital than at any time since they resumed
inspections Nov. 27.</TE>
<TE>   Hiro Ueki, spokesman for the inspectors, said the team interviewed
a scientist at Baghdad's Technological University at length in a
private office chosen at random.</TE>
<TE>   The scientist, Sabah Abdul Nour, said the inspectors had agreed to
let an Iraqi monitoring official attend.</TE>
<TE>   "The discussions were very friendly, and questions were mainly
about what has been done or any progress which has been achieved in
Iraq after 1998 till now," he told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "I explained to them all I know, and we have in fact nothing to
hide."</TE>
<TE>   In his broadcast message, Hussein said, "We are confident that the
outcome of the inspections will be a great shock to the United States
and will expose its lies, if things remain on a technical and
professional course with no hidden agendas."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "The world will then discover its false allegations and
will see the bad intentions of its officials. But will things proceed
in a manner that will ensure the achievement of the Security
Council's declared objectives?"</TE>
<TE>   Hussein said the Christian festive season this year was marked by
special circumstances "created by the powers of evil and darkness to
spread chaos and create states of destabilization and tension" in
many parts of the world.</TE>
<TE>   Christians in Iraq number about 1.5 million out of a population of
about 23 million, the vast majority of whom are Muslims.</TE>

<HD>Heavy Cargo Sailing to Gulf</HD>
<DH>U.S. deployment of two ships full of combat helicopters and
other materiel will give major boost to forces within striking
distance of Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Esther Schrader</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Two massive, fast-moving Navy cargo ships carrying combat helicopters
and supplies critical for any military move against Iraq left U.S.
shores this week en route to a Southwest Asian port, defense
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The Yano sailed from Charleston, S.C., with little fanfare at noon
Tuesday, carrying a Black Hawk helicopter and three OH-58 combat
helicopters in its holds.</LD>
<LD>   A day earlier, the Pililaau left Beaumont, Texas, loaded with
combat support equipment, including trucks and Humvees, that filled
almost 200,000 square feet of cargo space.</LD>
<TE>   The ships are the latest in the Pentagon's "surge fleet" --
designed to deliver equipment rapidly in a crisis -- to leave U.S.
shores loaded with gear to support the buildup of U.S. air, land and
sea forces in the Persian Gulf region. Their deployment significantly
boosts the amount of military hardware the Pentagon is positioning
within striking distance of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of the continuing, steady, slow movement of equipment
that we've been engaging in to build up the pressure on Saddam
Hussein," said Marge Holtz, a spokeswoman for the Navy's Military
Sealift Command, which moved the bulk of the materiel used during the
1991 Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld told reporters
that to supplement  the U.S. forces long positioned in the Gulf
region, the military has, in recent months, been engaging in a
"deliberate force flow" to bases and ports near Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Yano and the Pililaau, three other military
cargo ships berthed in the U.S. have been activated since late
October: the Bob Hope, the Fisher and the Bellatrix. Two ships based
in the Indian Ocean, the Watkins and the Watson, also have embarked
for the Gulf region in recent months. They are part of a fleet of
ships positioned near the British-controlled island of Diego Garcia
and loaded with military equipment and supplies to support Army
fighting units.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. official said Tuesday that there are plans to activate a
hospital ship for duty in the Gulf, but Holtz said the Sealift
Command had not been ordered to prepare either of the two hospital
ships in its inventory: the Comfort, in Baltimore, or the Mercy, in
San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Either of those ships leaving U.S. shores would be a strong
indication of imminent military action. It would take either ship
four weeks to get to the Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   The Yano, normally berthed in Baltimore, and the Pililaau, from
New Orleans, are part of a fleet of 19 ships acquired and refitted by
the military during the last decade at a cost of $6 billion to
improve the way the Pentagon equips U.S. troops abroad.</TE>
<TE>   The ships have huge ramps to allow massive artillery pieces,
Humvees and trucks to roll on and off. The design allows them to be
unloaded much more rapidly than the cargo ships that were used to
equip troops during the Gulf War. Those ships required giant cranes
to painstakingly lift tanks and other heavy gear out of their holds.
With the new ships, the ramps come down and the vehicles are driven
ashore.</TE>
<TE>   More than 900 feet long and 100 feet wide, each of the ships has a
hold capacity of 380,000 square feet -- equivalent to more than six
football fields. The Yano is carrying 180,000 square feet of materiel
on this voyage and the Pililaau slightly more. The ships can move at
speeds up to 28 mph. Though the fastest route to their destinations
would take the ships through the Suez Canal, a military official said
the Yano and the Pililaau are under orders to take a slower route
around Africa's Cape of Good Hope. The voyage to the Gulf region is
expected to take 21 to 25 days.</TE>

<HD>Oil Strike Has Taken Its Toll, Venezuelan Says</HD>
<DH>Petroleum chief admits walkout hurt nation, but says
government has restarted production. 'The worst is over' for Chavez,
an analyst says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela A</DL>
<LD>CARACAS, Venezuela -- In his first extensive remarks to U.S.
reporters since a nationwide strike crippled oil production, the
president of Venezuela's state petroleum company acknowledged Tuesday
that the work stoppage had racked the nation's economy.</LD>
<LD>   But Ali Rodriguez, president of Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA,
said in an interview that the government had managed to restart
production, and he predicted that oil shipments from the country,
which supplies 15% of U.S. imports, would return to normal by next
month.</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez's comments, combined with recent oil tanker departures
and gasoline deliveries, were the first concrete signs that President
Hugo Chavez's government has succeeded in beating back the immediate
threat of economic or political collapse.</LD>
<TE>   "The strike is being defeated," Rodriguez said. He estimated that
the 23-day-old strike had resulted in a loss of $1.3 billion to the
oil industry, which accounts for half the government's budget and a
third of its $124-billion gross domestic product.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez said Venezuela would ship less than 2 million barrels of
oil for December as a result of the strike, which shut down wells,
refineries and transport. Normally, it exports about 2.7 million
barrels a day.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a damage of great proportions," Rodriguez said. "There's
been damage done to the nation."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the former president of the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries said striking oil workers -- some of
whom he said would be arrested for their participation in the walkout
-- had failed to destabilize the government.</TE>
<TE>   Striking oil workers said Tuesday that Rodriguez had fired 90
managers. He acknowledged that some people had been fired, but he
declined to provide details.</TE>
<TE>   "They have created difficulties, but we have been overcoming them.
We have had problems with distribution, but at the end of this week,
the country will be totally supplied with gasoline," Rodriguez said.
Gas lines continued to snake for miles Tuesday, with many motorists
spending the night in their cars.</TE>
<TE>   "In the month of January, we will have completely normalized the
flow. I'm talking about the exports of crude," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Political opponents and oil analysts were skeptical of Rodriguez's
remarks. They said that even if all oil workers returned to their
jobs, it would take at least a month to get the paralyzed production
chain operating again at full speed. However, they acknowledged that
the government had turned a corner, at least for the time being.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst is over" for the government, said Ramon Espinasa, a
consultant for the Inter-American Development Bank and former chief
economist for PDVSA, who opposes Chavez. "However, the government
will face long-term problems down the road."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, a fiery leftist, has launched an ill-defined "revolution"
to rescue the country's poor. The scattered opposition, which enjoys
broad support among the labor and business sectors and rival
politicians, seeks to oust him. Chavez was briefly felled in a coup
in April, but he returned to power two days later, aided by loyal
military units.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition now is demanding that Chavez resign and hold new
elections by early next year. Chavez has said a referendum on his
rule is not allowed by the constitution until August.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations between the two sides have been going on since
November. But with Chavez still in control of the military and able
to maintain at least minimum operating levels in the oil industry,
there are worries that the protest could drag on for weeks, if not
months.</TE>
<TE>   That, in turn, could complicate a possible U.S. invasion of Iraq.
The strike in Venezuela has already sent oil prices to more than $30
a barrel, and a war in the Middle East would push prices even higher.</TE>
<TE>   "One side thinks the strike is using up the last drops of oil. The
other side thinks it's reactivating the industry. I don't know how
long the stalemate can go on," said a source close to the talks,
which will be resumed Thursday after a two-day suspension.</TE>
<TE>   A former communist guerrilla, Rodriguez appeared remarkably at
ease for a man who has spent the last month performing CPR on the
heart of the nation's economy.</TE>
<TE>   He talked at length about the measures PDVSA had taken to beat
back the strike, which opposition members say is being heeded by as
many as 35,000 of the 60,000 PDVSA workers, the majority in
administrative and executive positions.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Rodriguez spoke in a wood-paneled penthouse suite filled
with sculptures and oil paintings, a hard-core band of Chavez
supporters on the street below continued to ring the headquarters
building to protect it from opposition marchers.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez said PDVSA has supplied information to the attorney
general's office to help it carry out both civil and criminal trials
against oil executives, who he said had engaged in a deliberate plot
to cripple the industry.</TE>
<TE>   He also said PDVSA was preparing to purchase gasoline from abroad
and import foreign workers, including experts from Europe and the
U.S., to provide advice about a restructuring that would mean fewer
workers and affiliated companies.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged that production was still frozen at the largest
refinery in the Western Hemisphere, the Paraguana Refinery Center,
which normally produces nearly a million barrels a day. But two
smaller refineries, most of whose production is dedicated to
fulfilling Venezuela's internal needs, were operating at partial
capacity with the help of nonstriking workers and the rehiring of
workers who had retired or had been fired from their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez's success was visible Monday on Lake Maracaibo, the
historical heart of the country's oil industry. There, sitting in the
shallow waters just offshore from a refinery, the oil tanker Pilin
Leon was unloading gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   The Pilin Leon had become a symbol for the opposition after the
ship's crew joined the strike. It sat on the lake for 19 days until
the government arrested the captain and installed a replacement crew
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   By Monday, PDVSA workers and gas truck drivers had managed to
unload nearly all of the tanker's 11 million gallons of gasoline,
enough to supply Maracaibo, Venezuela's second-largest city, for up
to 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   As the day progressed, drivers could be seen around the city,
tailing bright-orange delivery trucks as they pulled up to service
stations to refill underground tanks.</TE>
<TE>   Danilo Garcia, western director for the Ministry of Mines and
Energy, said a work force reduced by 50% because of the strike had
managed the feat by working around the clock.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a titanic job. But we've done it," Garcia said.</TE>

<HD>China Frees a Leading Activist</HD>
<DH>The release into U.S. exile of Xu Wenli, a key dissident in
the 1970s democracy movement, highlights Beijing's desire for stable
ties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anthony Kuhn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>After years of lobbying by the U.S. and other governments, Chinese
authorities freed one of the nation's most famous dissidents from
prison Tuesday and sent the democracy activist into de facto exile in
the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The release of Xu Wenli highlights Beijing's desire for stable
ties with Washington and the growing influence of Chinese diplomats
who see such paroles as instrumental in achieving that goal, analysts
said.</LD>
<LD>   Xu, once known to his jailers as Special Prisoner No. 1, spent 16
of the last 21 years in prison. One of the key activists in the
late-1970s democracy movement in China, he was convicted in 1982 of
being a counterrevolutionary and was sentenced to 12 years. He was
returned to prison in 1998 after being convicted of subversion and
sentenced to 13 years for trying to set up an opposition political
party.</LD>
<TE>   Xu was freed Tuesday and joined his wife at Beijing's airport,
where they were escorted by a U.S. diplomat onto a United Airlines
flight to Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Hours later, at O'Hare International Airport, the couple were
reunited with their daughter, Xu Jin, a high school teacher in Rhode
Island.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just beautiful. It was just one of the most emotional
moments you've ever seen. They just enfolded each other," Mickey
Spiegel of Human Rights Watch told Associated Press. Xu Wenli
declined to be interviewed at the airport.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long journey.... " Xu Jin said before her parents'
arrival. "I just hope my dad's health will hold up."</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Xu Wenli was found to have hepatitis B.</TE>
<TE>   Xu's release came a week after U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Lorne Craner held talks in Beijing on human rights issues. Craner
told reporters then that he had appealed for Xu's release.</TE>
<TE>   "We are pleased that China released him from prison on medical
parole," the State Department said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Xu is the fourth person to be released by China from a list of 13
political prisoners and jailed U.S. residents and citizens that was
delivered to Chinese officials during President Bush's visit to
Beijing in February.</TE>
<TE>   Bei Ling, a dissident freed by China in 2000 and sent to the U.S.,
described Xu in a Times article last year as "the most important
Chinese dissident leader of the last 20 years" and the longest-held
prisoner of the 1979 Democracy Wall movement, the first outpouring of
political protests after the death of Mao Tse-tung in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Since Beijing struck the crime of "counterrevolution" from its
books in 1997, authorities have arrested about 3,500 people on
charges of subversion, now known as "endangering state security."
More than 90% of those arrested have been convicted and jailed. Xu's
is the first known parole among such cases.</TE>
<TE>   John Kamm, a San Francisco-based human rights campaigner who
worked on Xu's case for many years, said Xu's release established a
precedent. "It is no longer out of the question for people convicted
of endangering state security to be released early," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Human Rights Watch also hailed Xu's release but urged China to
free more dissidents.</TE>
<TE>   "We are thrilled that Xu Wenli is free. But no one should mistake
his release as a sign of improvement in China's human rights record,"
said Brad Adams, executive director of the group's Asia division.
"This was a token gesture to the Bush administration and a cynical
move by Beijing to head off international criticism."</TE>
<TE>   Chinese officials had informed the U.S. ahead of an Oct. 25 summit
between Bush and Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Texas that Xu would
be released by year's end, Kamm said. Details of the release were
finalized Dec. 16-17, when Craner visited Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   "There were some misgivings and reluctance among elements of the
Chinese government, and it took a couple of months to get a
consensus" on Xu's release, Kamm said. Chinese officials "said it was
important for our future cooperation that a consensus be won," he
added.</TE>
<TE>   Although Xu's release was seen as a positive step, it continues
Beijing's policy of trying to minimize freed dissidents' political
effectiveness by sending them overseas. In recent years, dissidents
such as Wei Jingsheng and student leader Wang Dan have been sent into
de facto exile in the U.S. Exiled dissidents are on a list of people
denied reentry into China.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone should have to choose to be exiled, and he
won't be free until he can go back to China freely and openly," Xu
Jin said of her father.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Xu Jin called for the release of Wang Youcai and
Qin Yongmin, who with Xu Wenli tried to establish the China Democracy
Party in 1998. The two, sentenced the same week as Xu, are serving 11
and 12 years on the same charges.</TE>
<TE>   Xu Jin and her parents later arrived in New York, where, she said,
they would head to Chinatown for dinner. "First I'm getting some food
for them, because my dad doesn't have much teeth left, so he can only
eat soft food," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Xu Wenli, born in 1943, was one of the most prominent activists in
China's Democracy Wall movement, advocating electoral reforms,
independent trade unions and the release of political prisoners. He
was a founder of an underground journal, the April Fifth Forum, which
commemorated the April 1976 protests that brought hundreds of
thousands of people into the streets of Beijing to demonstrate
against the Gang of Four, the radical clique that carried out Mao's
orders at the time.</TE>
<TE>   For his activities, Xu was convicted of counterrevolution and
sentenced to 15 years in prison. He was interrogated about 200 times
and kept in solitary confinement for 11 years, sometimes in a small,
windowless cell, according to "My Defense Statement," Xu's account of
his experience, which he had smuggled out of prison in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Xu's incarceration left him frail but unrepentant. In 1993,
authorities paroled Xu as then-President Clinton debated extending
preferential trading status to China. Determined to stay politically
active, Xu rejected official offers to leave China.</TE>
<TE>   Xu joined other activists who tried to capitalize on the brief
political thaw around the time of Clinton's June 1998 state visit to
China. Xu worked to set up the Beijing branch of the China Democracy
Party, but authorities quickly quashed the group and meted out stiff
prison sentences to its organizers. Except for Xu, they remain in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Known among Chinese dissidents as a skilled organizer, Xu has
described himself as a moderate Marxist and "a small electrician who
puts out fires."</TE>
<TE>   "I think that China's political reform should be a gradual
process," he wrote in 1998. "In modern Chinese history, there have
been many radical, revolutionary storms inflicting much pain on
people but achieving little in terms of people's political rights."</TE>

<LD>Vickie Odding tells us that "Santa Claus Is a Lie We Can Safely Tell
Our Kids" (Voices, Dec. 21). Is this the same Santa who does not call
on "needy" families, necessitating the work of Toys for Tots she
mentioned? Is it possible that Santa's discrimination against the
needy influences some children to grow up to be legislators who can
comfortably ignore the needs of the poor? Or executives who can
exploit them without a thought? Or those in government who would
serve only the rich? Perhaps Santa needs rethinking.</LD>

<HD>Lott's Swift Ouster Puts Frist First</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've never been a big fan of Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.). But the way
the GOP sliced him up and humiliated him caused even me to shrink at
the sight. Why the butcher job on Lott by the White House et al?
Well, to have to wait some three weeks for the meeting to vote for
the Senate leader and have all this public discussion during all that
time about the GOP's Southern strategy was not a good thing for Bush.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, Lott's successor as Senate majority leader was
unveiled. Sen. Bill Frist, a Southern white politician (from
Tennessee). Is Frist a strong proponent for the minorities and the
poor? Not at all. He's much more conservative than Lott, but
hopefully will not be caught on tape favoring segregation. Look at
his record: an opponent of expanded hate crimes protection; against
greater funding for minority-owned businesses; against efforts to end
job discrimination based on sexual orientation; opponent to
affirmative action in federal hiring. Frist is a poster boy for the
American Conservative Union. Hopefully for the GOP he won't publicly
advertise his despicable right-wing feelings. But his record and that
of the White House are there for all to see.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Well, thanks to the mainstream media, Lott is out and Frist is in
as Senate majority leader. This manufactured controversy is a prime
example of the media's perpetual drive to create the news rather than
simply report it. Media outlets, in an absolutely blatant attempt at
juicing up an otherwise uneventful birthday celebration, embellished
their stories with highly subjective interpretations of Lott's
comments. No critics of Lott's speech were reported until after
grossly opinionated media stories went public. Are journalists just a
bunch of frustrated fiction writers?</TE>

<TE>   I was feeling just a little bit of empathy for Lott until hearing
that he blamed his downfall on people who dislike Christians (Dec.
23). So he's doing like others from the past, looking for a scapegoat
to blame for his own ignorance. Now I really believe he got what he
deserved. Good riddance to bad rubbish.</TE>

<LD>It may not feel like the season to be jolly if all your Christmas
cards speak of cancer, strokes, Alzheimer's, hospice and death, and
if your children are scattered over four states and there's going to
be three of you for Christmas dinner. Or if you're worried that
you'll last longer than your money or that American children are
going to die in some God-forsaken desert far away.</LD>
<LD>   You're blessed if, at 82 and 85, you and your spouse of 60 years
are reasonably OK and your children are healthy and loving. And if
you have lots of younger friends, and your church is full of good
folks and beautiful music, and you can still drive the freeways
during daylight, if it's not raining, and enjoy an occasional game of
golf or bridge or a book or movie or TV. We've found small ways to
help our local Boys &amp; Girls Club and admire all the mentors and
tutors in the schools. Reach out to someone ill or friendless to make
Christmas more meaningful for you both, and maybe the season will
seem more jolly.</LD>

<TE>   I took my puppy outside and my new neighbor with her daughter were
standing in front of their house. She said she had just come back
from another neighbor's house, after seeing their Christmas tree. It
was so beautiful, perfectly color coordinated, each ornament placed
in a strategic manner -- and as she was telling me this, you could
hear the sadness. I asked her if she wanted to see mine. Mine also
was pretty, and she told me she felt bad about her tree not looking
as nice as ours.</TE>
<TE>   Her tree was decorated by her children's school projects, homemade
decorations, gingerbread cookies missing an arm or leg, and the
regular bulbs placed where the children could reach, whether they
matched or not. After listening to her, I said, "You have a family
tree." I realized how I missed my family tree.</TE>
<TE>   The joy of decorating a family tree is one of the best parts of
Christmas. As I took out those ornaments from the box I would take an
extra moment with each one. The plastic gingerbread man with my son's
face, age 6 at that time. My daughter's young face glued on a
Christmas prayer sealed in clear plastic, the toy truck made from
clay in first grade and so on. I would gently place each one on my
family tree and my kids would look for their special gifts of years
gone by.</TE>
<TE>   I think next year I, too, will have my family tree back. I miss
that joy. By the way, my neighbor left with a smile on her face,
saying, "Yes, we have a family tree."</TE>

<TE>   Reading together the call to worship at my sister Rachel's
Christmas pageant, we proclaimed, "How beautiful upon the mountains
are the feet of those who bring good news! It is God who calls us to
proclaim peace."</TE>
<TE>   God is bigger than President Bush and his plans for war. God is
bigger than U.S. nationalism. God's divine plan may ultimately call
for justice and equity for all the people of the planet. People who
are terrorists cannot be Muslims, for Islam means peace. People who
call for war are not followers of Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   Peacemakers are not passive, and their activism has historically
been threatening to the powerful. Jesus was crucified because he
spoke truth to power. Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr. and
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin were all assassinated. These
were stronger men than the warmongers because they had the guts to
tap into something more significant and enduring than human frailty.
Bush is weak, and so are the plans to solve problems with violence.</TE>
<TE>   Christina Rossetti wrote a poem called "Love Came Down at
Christmas." I'm thankful for the Christmas reminder that God injects
love into history. We need it right now.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Here's a Vast Conspiracy for You: to Kill Interest in
Public Affairs," Steve Lopez's Dec. 22 column challenging us to
respond to President Bush's war plan: I believe there is no one
listening to the dissent. Many have marched at the local bank lot
each week. We've written to our senators and representatives; signed
petitions; called the White House, Senate and House comment lines;
sent numerous e-mails; and had weekly prayers for peace at our
church. True, we have gone shopping because we want to celebrate with
our families in this season of hope. But we know violence begets
violence and there is a potential for nuclear disaster in the
presidential plan. So how do we register our dissent and have someone
listen?</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Court Weighs Barring Judges From Scouting," Dec. 21: Like other
citizens, judges are permitted to participate in religious
organizations and nonprofit youth organizations like the Boy Scouts.
Religious beliefs are protected by the constitutional right to
freedom of religion. Membership in the Scouts is protected by the
constitutional rights to freedom of association and freedom of
speech.</LD>
<LD>   The politicized bar associations of Los Angeles, San Francisco and
Santa Clara suggest that judges should be required to forgo these
constitutional rights as a condition of judicial office. In support
of their position, they cite a report that found that half of gay and
lesbian litigants felt they had not been treated fairly by the
courts. Of course this also means that half of gay and lesbian
litigants felt they had been treated fairly.</LD>
<LD>   In other words, the report reaches the entirely unremarkable
conclusion that gays and lesbians are the same as any other
litigants. Half of all litigants lose their cases and are
disappointed. It is outrageous to suggest that this truism justifies
abrogating the Constitution.</LD>

<LD>Re "Mother of 'Dr. Laura' Found Dead," Dec. 21: "Dr. Laura"
Schlessinger has spent years admonishing people on morality and
family values. She regularly dispenses a harsh and intolerant brand
of advice while using the snide tag line, "I am my children's
mother." Now we learn that she so ostracized her own mother that when
the poor woman was apparently murdered and had lain dead for "as long
as two months," no one, least of all the good "doctor," even noticed.
Obviously, Dr. Laura wasn't her mother's daughter, just another
right-wing phony now revealed.</LD>

<LD>Re "Medical Groups Criticize Bush's Smallpox Vaccine Plan," Dec. 20:
Are we so benumbed and terrified by the warmongering of this
president that we are willing to submit to his guidance even in
matters of public health? Before we abdicate our reason entirely,
wouldn't it be more appropriate that someone with perhaps a little
more medical expertise than President Bush -- oh, say, the surgeon
general -- might inspire a bit more confidence in this matter?</LD>
<LD>   It is Bush's own saber-rattling that, in no small way, continues
to put us at risk in the first place. In his relentless quest to
slash health benefits, trash the environment and cut heat subsidies
for the poor, this president has demonstrated reckless disregard for
the interests of the people. And now we are to look to him for
guidance in this public health crisis? And what was the name of that
medical school from which he graduated? Or is that a secret too? I am
thankful that the medical community is finally weighing in on this
potentially grave national health issue.</LD>

<LD>While the state government contemplates raising the sales tax, income
tax and imposing a movie-ticket tax to cover the budget shortfall
(Dec. 20), I notice that no one in Sacramento has the courage to
propose the single best solution for the state: dramatically raising
the tax on automobile gasoline. Use one-half of such gas-tax revenue
to pay for improved mass transit and one-half to help cover the
deficit. Benefits include reducing smog, improving the environment,
reducing traffic, decreasing sprawl, reducing illness from pollution
and lessening our dependence on foreign oil. And as an added bonus,
those people driving absurdly giant SUVs will bear the brunt of the
tax.</LD>

<HD>Charles Longenecker, 93; TV Film Pioneer, Talent Agent and
Radio Producer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1940, he went to see a movie, "Flight Command," and decided he
wanted to marry the leading lady. Two years later, he did.</LD>
<LD>   Charles Robert "Bob" Longenecker, who forged a career as radio
producer, talent agent and pioneer in moving television from live
production to film while maintaining a 60-year marriage to actress
Ruth Hussey, died of unspecified causes Dec. 10 in Thousand Oaks. He
was 93.</LD>
<LD>   At the time he picked his bride from the screen, Longenecker had
already completed a couple of years in radio production at Los
Angeles' CBS radio affiliate KNX, and was working for the talent
agency Myron Selznick &amp; Co.</LD>
<TE>   Named head of the Selznick radio department, Longenecker helped
choose radio scripts for top actors, including Joan Bennett, Olivia
de Havilland, Paulette Goddard, Myrna Loy, Loretta Young, Claire
Trevor, William Powell, Norma Shearer, Pat O'Brien and Fredric March.</TE>
<TE>   In that kind of company, he was able to meet Hussey. The couple
meshed their careers successfully from Hollywood to Broadway and back
for several decades.</TE>
<TE>   Longenecker formed a company he called Telepak Inc. to package
filmed shows for television beginning in the late 1940s and early
'50s, when most programs were telecast live.</TE>
<TE>   "I am trying to fight the battle for television films. I believe
that economically they have a future," he told The Times in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   "The cost of live shows is constantly rising, whereas film costs
may be maintained at a certain definite level, and furthermore video
pictures have a wider distribution."</TE>
<TE>   One of his greatest successes was with the military. An Army
lieutenant during World War II, Longenecker in 1950 began providing
filmed recordings of top television shows by Milton Berle, Arthur
Godfrey, Pinky Lee and others for use around the world from front
lines to training camps, hospitals, ships and submarines.</TE>
<TE>   He offered video programs on both 16-millimeter and 35-millimeter
film for use "wherever there happens to be a film projector and a
white bed sheet."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Longenecker's film concept was ahead of its time for
mainstream television stations. So he formed the Robert Longenecker
Agency, and spent much of his remaining career as a talent agent,
specializing in booking his 130 or so clients for television
commercials.</TE>
<TE>   For a couple of years in the early 1950s, Longenecker also stepped
in front of the camera on late-night CBS affiliate KNXT to host a
movie and celebrity interview show.</TE>
<TE>   He established a theme remembered for years by opening and closing
the program with a lighted candle and a recording of Perry Como's
"Light One Little Candle."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Lititz, Pa., Longenecker attended Moravian College in
Bethlehem, Pa., and graduated from Pennsylvania State University,
playing basketball for both schools.</TE>
<TE>   During the Depression years, he worked for his car dealer father,
sold radios and refrigerators, played semipro baseball, waited tables
and drove a bread delivery truck.</TE>
<TE>   He began working in radio in New York, but moved to Los Angeles in
1937. In his early days at KNX, he worked with such radio luminaries
as Lum and Amber, Edward Robinson and Kate Smith.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Longenecker is survived by a daughter,
Mary Hendrix of Thousand Oaks; two sons, John of Beverly Hills and
Rob of Houston; a sister, Sylvia Longenecker; and four grandchildren.</TE>

<KH>IN THE CLASSROOM</KH>
<HD>Art School Palette Adds Video Games</HD>
<DH>A network with Southland campuses now offers a bachelor's
degree in game design.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Pierson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Travis Castillo was interested in only one type of gift when Christmas or
his birthday rolled around: video games.</LD>
<LD>   Over time, the 22-year-old has accumulated 14 gaming systems and
has hundreds of cartridges and compact discs to go with them.</LD>
<LD>   But while some parents may complain that all that gaming is a
mind-numbing waste of time, Castillo has decided to put it to use for
what he hopes will be a lucrative career. All his countless hours of
Mario Brothers and Tenchu ninja swordplay are being put to an unusual
challenge: a college degree in computer gaming.</LD>
<TE>   A network of trade and career schools known as the Art Institutes
is offering what's believed to be the only bachelor's degree in video
game art and design in the country, industry experts say. The school
chain, which specializes in fashion, design, culinary arts and media
arts, has 27 sites. Ten of those offer the video gaming program,
including four of its five California schools: Santa Monica, Santa
Ana, San Diego and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The program, launched in 1999 at the Art Institutes'
Phoenix campus, was cited in the January issue of Electronic Gaming
Monthly as one of the top five game degrees being offered in the world.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Monica, Castillo has enrolled in the three-year, $60,000
program in hopes of quickly entering the booming video game industry
as a game designer.</TE>
<TE>   While movie sales were registered at $8.4 billion last year, the
video game industry made $9.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   That potential persuaded the 40-year-old school to offer the
gaming studies, said David Pauldine, president of the Art Institutes,
which has its headquarters in Pittsburgh. "The visual impact of the
game has increased drastically. The games people play are more
realistic, and that's going to require competent game art designers,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software
Assn. in Washington, D.C., said the establishment of gaming degrees
was inevitable because of the increasing scope and popularity of the
industry. But he said students should look carefully at the
qualifications of instructors because the field is still relatively
new.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a natural evolution in the education setting," Lowenstein
said. "Not just for commercial reasons, but from an artistic and
creative standpoint."</TE>
<TE>   A handful of schools offer a master's degree related to computer
gaming, including USC, Georgia Institute of Technology and Rochester
Institute of Technology. In addition, there are dozens of courses at
universities that explore aspects of video gaming.</TE>
<TE>   The Art Institutes' program is not for computer programmers but
creative designers. Think of the degree in terms of a movie.</TE>
<TE>   Graduates intend to be the equivalent of the screenwriter,
director, and costume and set designer rolled into one.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like being God of a virtual universe," Castillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Students spend weeks honing their skills with pen and paper to
practice drawing three-dimensional figures. One of the most important
lessons is anatomy. By understanding how muscles and bones work,
artists add realism to their renderings. Later, students can make
clay models to refine their characters.</TE>
<TE>   Another required course is story development, a crucial part of
role-playing games that place more emphasis on plot than "shoot 'em
up" action. As video games continue to resemble feature films more,
story lines have become important selling points for all genres. So
students are taught how to concoct variations on classic themes such
as the fatal flaw, the feuding brothers and the star-crossed love
affair.</TE>
<TE>   "With technology getting better," said Josh Leyshock, a 19-year-old
student, "computer games have one place to go: up."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Megis, a veteran game designer who also teaches at the
institute's year-old program in Santa Monica, said that because of
their tight budgets, video game companies are not likely to train
employees. So he believes his graduating students will have an edge
over other job candidates. (Some salaries in the field start around
$30,000, but a top designer or programmer can make more than
$100,000).</TE>
<TE>   "Having some kind of formalized talent pool can only help," Megis
said.</TE>
<TE>   However, the instructor has warned his charges that the classroom
is a far cry from the competitive professional world. He tells them
about the rigors of the career -- for example, getting as little as
four hours' sleep a night for months because of a deadline to produce
a new game. Relationships were ruined because of the jobs.</TE>
<TE>   But for some of the 111 students in the Santa Monica
program, things still are fun and games. They keep up on new games the way
film students prowl movie premieres.</TE>
<TE>   One student got hold of a yet-to-be-released and much-anticipated
Dune III. The space fantasy game always draws a crowd but is so
visually demanding on hardware that it slows down the entire computer
network at the school. Administrators have to look for students
playing it and order them to stop.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a fantasy for these students," said Vi Ly, academic
department director for the school. Being a game designer "is like
getting paid to play," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Some students say it's ironic that they're studying video gaming
because it was blamed for compromising so much schoolwork when they
were younger. Many, including Castillo, had to spend months
convincing their parents it was a viable form of study before
enrolling at the institute.</TE>
<TE>   Through contacts at school, Castillo landed an internship at one
of the nation's largest video game distribution companies,
Activision, conveniently located in Santa Monica. There, in the
underground "dungeon," Castillo samples the firm's works in progress
during his free time.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be playing a game and then the creator will walk in and talk
about issues making it," he said. "I'm finding it really helpful
seeing how they think."</TE>
<TE>   Recent releases of such games as "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City" and
"Battlefield 1942" have shown that games can be an addictive world
where social codes can be ignored or history rewritten. The
potential, he says, is huge.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure in 10 to 20 years people will say video games are a
legitimate art form," said Castillo. "I can see it push further than
movies because you can immerse people in it."</TE>

<HD>Poison Fumes Send 10 to Hospital</HD>
<DH>Oxnard family is treated after inhaling carbon monoxide in
converted rooms in their home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten members of an Oxnard family, including a 3-day-old boy, were
stricken by carbon monoxide fumes in their home early Tuesday, but
they apparently escaped serious injury.</LD>
<LD>   All were doing well after receiving pure oxygen in the hyperbaric
chamber at St. John's Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo, said a
hospital spokeswoman. They were to be released later in the day.</LD>
<LD>   Fire officials said the family apparently had improperly converted
the attic and an attached garage of their Bogota Court home into
sleeping quarters. They blamed a poorly connected water heater in the
garage and a blocked forced-air heating vent in the attic for pumping
colorless, odorless carbon monoxide throughout the house.</LD>
<TE>   Oxnard Fire Capt. Kevin Schroepfer called the family "extremely
lucky," saying their close call illustrates how things can go
dramatically wrong when home modifications are made without permits.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a lesson," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Schroepfer said family members, who could not be reached for
comment, will be allowed to return home but cannot sleep in the attic
or garage without approval from city code enforcement officials.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in a tidy neighborhood of homes that sell in the
mid-$300,000s, the three-bedroom house was decorated with snowflakes
and Christmas lights in the outline of reindeer. Fire and hospital
officials declined to release the victims' names.</TE>
<TE>   At St. John's Pleasant Valley, Dr. Thomas Millington said this was
the third year in a row that he and his staff have treated carbon
monoxide victims during the holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   "It happens as soon as it gets cold and someone turns the furnace
on," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it happens when it starts to rain and people put tarps
over heating outlets on the roof."</TE>
<TE>   Also used for treating burn victims and divers with the bends, the
hospital's hyperbaric chamber is big enough for an adult and a child.
By inhaling oxygen in a pressurized environment, patients have toxins
washed from their cells more quickly than in standard oxygen
treatments.</TE>
<TE>   The first two patients from the Bogota Court home Tuesday were a
teenage mother and her 3-day-old son.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to pop them in as soon as possible," Millington said.
"He napped and nursed and was looking great."</TE>
<TE>   The family evidently had been breathing the fumes for about 12
hours. They woke about 5 a.m. with severe headaches and a carbon
monoxide alarm in the house going off, Millington said.</TE>
<TE>   Three or four hopped into a car and drove to St. John's Regional
Medical Center in Oxnard. The remainder were initially treated at the
house and taken to the Camarillo facility by Oxnard firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   Millington said the hyperbaric treatments take two hours, with
patients usually watching TV to pass the time.</TE>
<TE>   He told family members he wanted them to return for follow-up
sessions in the chamber today.</TE>
<TE>   Carbon monoxide poisoning causes about 5,000 deaths and 20,000
injuries annually in the United States. It is the leading cause of
accidental poisoning fatalities, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.</TE>

<KH>REFLECTIONS ON 2002: POLITICS</KH>
<HD>GOP, Secessionists Got Shut Out</HD>
<DH>Davis led Democrats to a sweep of statewide elections.
Hahn gave L.A. a new police chief.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Matea Gold</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The political events that defined 2002 in some cases were those that
did not happen: Los Angeles did not split apart, Gov. Gray Davis did
not lose reelection and the Democrats' stronghold on California did
not falter.</LD>
<LD>   Within the workings of government, there were important shifts:
Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn dumped one police chief and picked
another, William J. Bratton, a veteran of the New York and Boston
police departments, who arrived in Los Angeles just in time to
confront a string of alarming violent crimes. And in Sacramento, the
Democratic leadership that voters chose in November was quickly faced
with a budget deficit that threatened to scuttle plans and force
major rollbacks.</LD>
<LD>   If those developments altered the government agenda, however, the
elections did little to shuffle the players who will address it.</LD>
<TE>   "I think the election was remarkable for how little it changed
things," said Bruce Cain, director of UC Berkeley's Institute for
Governmental Studies. "There were no major propositions and no major
transformations."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike previous years, when measures to ban benefits for illegal
immigrants and end affirmative action divided the electorate, voters
in 2002 tackled less contentious notions. Statewide, they approved
measures to expand after-school programs and repair run-down school
buildings. In Santa Monica, they rejected a proposal to give workers
in beachside businesses a raise, while in Los Angeles County, they
overwhelmingly supported a parcel tax increase to pay for trauma
centers.</TE>
<TE>   Disaffected Electorate</TE>
<TE>   Across California, more than half of the electorate stayed home,
unhappy with its choices and disgusted by the negative politicking
that dominated the governor's race.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a disconnect between voters and politics, probably
larger than we've seen in some time," said Jaime Regalado, executive
director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at Cal State
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   When the year began, defining contests across the state appeared
to be too close to call. Richard Riordan was touted as a threat to
Davis, advocates of breaking up Los Angeles were on the move and
observers of the Los Angeles Police Department wondered whether
change at the top was in store.</TE>
<TE>   At the Police Department, long at the center of local and even
national political attention, the year opened with Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks in pursuit of a second term, and many observers
expected Hahn to give it to him.</TE>
<TE>   But the expected didn't happen.</TE>
<TE>   In February, Hahn startled and angered many of his African
American allies when he announced his opposition to granting Parks
another five years. The chief struggled to hold on to his job, but
the Police Commission, whose members were nominated by Hahn, sided
with the mayor and turned down Parks.</TE>
<TE>   With an interim chief in place, the city launched a nationwide
search for Parks' replacement. The final list came down to three
candidates: Bratton, former Philadelphia Police Commissioner John
Timoney and Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn chose Bratton, the brash former New York police commissioner,
who immediately set to work reorganizing the Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's moves at the LAPD helped strengthen his standing with the
public -- and at a time when that was politically significant.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of the year, secession efforts in Hollywood and
the San Fernando Valley appeared to have momentum. The campaigns
qualified for the ballot after a state agency concluded that the
communities could survive financially on their own (a third secession
campaign, in the harbor area, was denied a place on the same ballot).
Supporters in the Valley and Hollywood predicted that breakup was
imminent.</TE>
<TE>   Within weeks, however, the efforts began to lose steam, as Hahn
began organizing against the breakaway movements. The mayor brought
in former rivals -- including Riordan, Antonio Villaraigosa and labor
leader Miguel Contreras -- to his L.A. United campaign, which soon
pulled in hefty donations.</TE>
<TE>   Secession Faltered</TE>
<TE>   Secession proponents, on the other hand, failed to put together a
competitive campaign. Internal disagreements and a lack of resources
left their efforts sputtering, and the strategy of running the two
secession efforts simultaneously did not appear to help either
effort, particularly as overwhelming opposition to Hollywood
secession emerged citywide and within Hollywood. In the end,
secession won by a thin margin in the Valley, but lost solidly
citywide -- killing the movements, at least for the time being, and
handing Hahn a major victory.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Courageous' and 'bold' are not terms you usually associate with
Mayor Hahn, but by picking Chief Bratton and marshaling the forces
against secession, he showed himself to be both," said Los Angeles
campaign consultant Harvey Englander.</TE>
<TE>   On the state front, the Bush administration's efforts to topple
Davis by running a moderate Republican against him failed.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's candidacy fell apart in the Republican primary, under
fire from television commercials funded by Davis that questioned the
former mayor's stance on abortion and the death penalty. Riordan
stumbled time and again as he tried to answer those ads and
articulate a rationale for his candidacy. His campaign steadily lost
ground, particularly as conservative Republican voters abandoned him
in droves.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's move, criticized by many as a manipulation of the
elections, helped secure him the challenger he wanted: investment
manager and political neophyte Bill Simon Jr.</TE>
<TE>   "It stands out as historic in the sense that it was an unusual
move to intervene in a primary and do it successfully, and because
it's one of few cases where [the White House]'s attempts to rearrange
the landscape this year didn't work," Cain said.</TE>
<TE>   In the general election, Simon followed Riordan's lead in
misfiring politically. He issued contradictory statements about his
position on gay rights and equivocated about whether and when to
release his tax returns. Controversy about his role in the collapse
of a savings and loan, and a false accusation that Davis had engaged
in illegal campaign fund-raising clouded the campaign's final months.</TE>
<TE>   Outgunned by Davis' huge fund-raising advantage and distracted by
his own campaign's missteps, the Republican nominee never found a way
to capitalize on the relative weakness of the incumbent, who led
throughout despite polls showing that more voters disapproved of his
performance than supported it.</TE>
<TE>   Davis beat Simon, but by a mere 5 points, with 61% of voters
saying they had an unfavorable impression of the governor.</TE>
<TE>   Stark Defeat for GOP</TE>
<TE>   The state GOP didn't lose only the governor's office. In a year
when Republicans captured key seats nationwide, California remained
firmly in the Democratic column: Democrats won all seven statewide
seats, the first such sweep since 1882.</TE>
<TE>   But as the year ended, Davis froze the state's nonessential
spending, and proposed billions of dollars worth of cuts to cope with
the budget shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   "The defining California story next year is going to be dealing
with the fiscal crisis," said Steve Erie, a professor of political
science at UC San Diego. "The big story is going to be about the pain
of the cuts -- and it's going to be severe."</TE>

<HD>Helen Grace, 88; With Husband, Built Chocolate Empire
Bearing Her Name</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Anton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Helen Grace, who along with her husband built a multimillion-dollar
Southern California candy empire that bears her name, has died. She
was 88.</LD>
<LD>   Grace died Saturday of natural causes in her Huntington Beach
home.</LD>
<LD>   "They were smart people. Hard-working people," said her son, Jim,
who took over the company in the 1970s and ran Helen Grace Chocolates
until it was sold 1 1/2 years ago. "It's the American Dream. They
started with nothing."</LD>
<TE>   Bill and Helen Grace opened their first chocolate shop in San
Pedro in 1944, on her 30th birthday. The story goes that Helen Grace
was expecting a box of chocolates as a present and was surprised to
be given a whole store instead.</TE>
<TE>   Helen Grace worked the counter, selling candy to customers, while
her husband, a shipyard worker by day, made chocolate at night.</TE>
<TE>   "They did very well," their son said. "They sold everything that
he could make."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, they opened a chain of stores and began selling candy
to schools for fund-raising campaigns that would raise more than $200
million over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Helen Grace was born Jan. 10, 1914, in Washington state. She moved
to San Francisco, where she met Bill at a dance.</TE>
<TE>   She retired from day-to-day participation in their business in
1963 and the couple eventually moved to Northern California, where
they operated farms and cattle ranches.</TE>
<TE>   They later developed avocado and lemon groves in Ventura County.
The couple divorced in the mid-1980s.</TE>
<TE>   But Grace never lost her love for the family's candy business.
Until just a few years ago, she would occasionally stop by a retail
store to see how it was being run.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a celebrity," her son said. "She enjoyed that. But she
was always very gracious about it."</TE>
<TE>   It was all part of her lifelong love affair with chocolate.</TE>
<TE>   "Our whole family loves chocolate," Jim Grace said. "I'd go to her
house and she'd have a box of chocolate on the table while she
watched TV. She was always nibbling."</TE>
<TE>   Grace is survived by two sons, five grandchildren and 14
great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Murder Case Grips Bakersfield</HD>
<DH>Man accused of killing a top prosecutor has people
wondering what 'secrets' he knows about D.A.'s office and what a
trial might reveal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Johnson and Mark Arax</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>BAKERSFIELD</DL>
<LD>Years before he was accused of killing a top prosecutor,
then-district attorney investigator Christopher Hillis won a $50,000
stress retirement that was five to 10 times the usual award in
tightfisted Kern County.</LD>
<LD>   When the decorated ex-cop was asked how he had pulled it off,
Hillis told former colleague Kyle Beckman that he knew some "secrets"
about the district attorney's office: " 'I know where the skeletons
are buried.' "</LD>
<LD>   "He apparently wasn't joking," said Beckman, who is still fighting
the county on his own mental stress claim.</LD>
<TE>   Now, as Hillis sits in jail on charges of stabbing to death
Assistant Dist. Atty. Stephen M. Tauzer, former co-workers and others
in the legal community wonder what Hillis knows and how much of it
might come out if the case goes to trial. He has pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of nervous people," said Gene Lorenz, a local
defense attorney and courthouse observer. "A lot of things are going
to come out when this goes to trial."</TE>
<TE>   Even the local paper, the Californian, has editorialized about "a
cloud building over the Kern County district attorney's office" since
Tauzer's murder.</TE>
<TE>   Saying the "fairness of Kern County's legal system" has been
called into question by Tauzer's involvement with Hillis'
drug-addicted son, the paper has called on Dist. Atty. Edward R.
Jagels to provide a full disclosure of Tauzer's actions.</TE>
<TE>   Hillis' attorney, Kyle Humphrey, declines to detail what, if any,
special knowledge his client possesses about his days in the district
attorney's office. But he said he is operating on the theory that
Tauzer was leading a double life.</TE>
<TE>   On one hand, Humphrey said, Tauzer was a hard-working prosecutor
trusted by Jagels to run the office. On the other, Tauzer, 57, was
living with Hillis' 22-year-old son, Lance, and crossing ethical
lines to keep the young drug addict out of jail.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris is going to get the best possible defense," Humphrey said.
"If in the process powerful people are embarrassed, so be it. If it
requires delving into secrets people don't want out, so be it."</TE>
<TE>   Tauzer, who friends say was gay, let Lance Hillis stay at his
house and gave him money, a credit card and a clerking job in the
district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Although Christopher Hillis hoped his son would get a stiff jail
sentence that might help break his addiction, Tauzer kept placing
Lance in drug treatment programs, including one in El Dorado County.
That is where Lance was killed in a car crash in early August, five
weeks before Tauzer's death.</TE>
<TE>   Humphrey said he is considering a defense that centers on the
notion that Christopher Hillis and Tauzer were engaged in a tug of
war over Lance. If Tauzer used his position -- and the threat of jail
-- to pressure Lance into a gay relationship, it could have fueled
the father's rage.</TE>
<TE>   "If a parent discovers that his child is being taken advantage of
in a predatory homosexual relationship, that parent would naturally
be enraged," Humphrey said.</TE>
<TE>   Humphrey is also looking into the possibility that Tauzer may have
been killed by someone he knew only briefly. He says the murder bears
a "striking resemblance" to past cases involving prominent
Bakersfield men who were living secret gay lives and were killed by
young hustlers.</TE>
<TE>   One such case that went to trial, the 1981 murder of county
administrator Edwin Buck, included testimony alleging that Buck and a
Kern County political consultant were having sex with teenage boys
who lived in a group home.</TE>
<TE>   If Humphrey wants to turn Hillis' defense into a referendum on the
district attorney's office, he could raise questions about a number
of public controversies over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Jagels' office was criticized by the state attorney general for
the way it handled ritual child-abuse prosecutions in the 1980s.
Those were some of the earliest cases in the wave of investigations
that swept the nation -- such as the McMartin Pre-School case in Los
Angeles -- that some legal experts compared to the Salem witch
trials. Most of those convicted in Kern County were later freed due
to prosecutorial errors or misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   The office was also taken to task in the book, "Mean Justice,"
which accused prosecutors of a pattern of questionable conduct in
their zeal to send people to prison.</TE>
<TE>   "How many D.A.'s offices in the country have best-selling books
written about them?" said attorney Lorenz. "When the appellate courts
keep issuing reversals and rebuking the D.A.'s office for hiding
evidence, these are serious problems."</TE>
<TE>   In the days after his top deputy's murder, Jagels said he didn't
see anything wrong with Tauzer's intervention on behalf of Lance
Hillis. But he has repeatedly declined to comment since and has
instructed prosecutors in his office to keep silent as well.</TE>
<TE>   Jagels referred a call for this story to the office of state Atty.
Gen. Bill Lockyer, which will be prosecuting the case to avoid any
appearance of a conflict of interest, since both Hillis and Tauzer
were employed by the district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Atty. Gen. David Druliner said it would be "inappropriate
to comment" on the case, or on what the defense may or may not do.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear if Tauzer had a sexual relationship with Lance
Hillis. What is clear is that Tauzer's affection for the young meth
addict led the prosecutor into increasingly bizarre behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Hillis, who went back to school to become a drug
counselor after leaving the prosecutor's office, believed his son
needed to bottom out in prison before he could get clean. But Tauzer
kept getting involved. The prosecutor went to court with Lance Hillis
and pleaded with judges to give him one more chance.</TE>
<TE>   Besides infuriating Christopher Hillis, Tauzer's treatment of
Lance Hillis upset local defense attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a county where if you catch a kid with drugs who has no
connections, they send him to prison for umpteen million years,"
Lorenz said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet here was Lance Hillis walking around free. Not only walking
around, but driving Tauzer's Ford Explorer, living in Tauzer's house
and spending Tauzer's money.</TE>
<TE>   Then in August, Lance Hillis died in a car crash 300 miles to the
north in El Dorado County. He was at the wheel of a car he had stolen
after running away from the drug treatment program in Placerville.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 12, five weeks after Lance Hillis' death, Tauzer confided
to friends that he was afraid Christopher Hillis would hold him
responsible for the death and try to kill him. Three days later, the
prosecutor was found dead in his garage.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzer had been bludgeoned and stabbed numerous times. A knife had
been thrust into his head.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Hillis was arrested a month later. Investigators said
they made a DNA match between Hillis and a knife found near Tauzer's
body.</TE>
<TE>   At one time, the accused and the victim were bound by the same
oath and counted each other as close friends.</TE>
<TE>   Hillis, a former Bakersfield Police Officer of the Year, was
recruited by Jagels in 1985. He rose quickly to lieutenant in the
D.A.'s office. Some of the men under him recall Hillis as smart,
personable and hard-working, to the point that he dusted off two old
murder cases and found the hidden evidence to solve them.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris Hillis was a very talented investigator -- witty, friendly
and very intelligent," said Kevin Clerico, a former district attorney
investigator who worked beside Hillis in the late 1980s and early
'90s. "Jagels and Tauzer treated him as one of the favored guys."</TE>
<TE>   Hillis was one of the regulars at Jagels' spacious Fairway Drive
home for barbecues and political fund-raisers, co-workers said.</TE>
<TE>   Things were going so well that Hillis told friends he had been
promised the job of chief investigator by Tauzer and Jagels.</TE>
<TE>   But Hillis never got the job. He and the chief investigator didn't
get along. According to Hillis' disability records, he believed his
boss had singled him out for unfair treatment, and in 1993 he went to
Jagels for help. But his old friend rebuffed him.</TE>
<TE>   After that, records show, Hillis developed a rash, suffered from
insomnia and a mental breakdown. He told doctors that the pressures
inside the office had gotten so bad that he was having thoughts about
killing the chief of the unit.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict with his boss, now retired, centered on Hillis' role
as chief of the undercover narcotics unit. At the time, it was also
part of Hillis' job to head up the district attorney's asset
forfeiture program. Seizing cars, boats and cash from drug dealers --
all of which the agency could keep under state law -- had become a
source of cash at a time when the state's economy was strapped.</TE>
<TE>   Hillis' unit was so adept at tracking drug dealers that Kern
County became one of the most successful in the state in the value of
assets seized, former investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   The forfeiture money, which totaled $3 million for 1992-93, was
used in part to pay the salaries of the district attorney's
investigators. At least once, former investigators said, Tauzer
threatened to fire them if they didn't continue seizing large assets.</TE>
<TE>   "If they were not successful, they would be eliminated out of the
budget," S.A. Manohara, a psychiatrist, wrote in a report on Hillis,
a declaration confirmed by two of Hillis' co-workers.</TE>
<TE>   In late 1993, Hillis left work and brought a disability claim
against the county. In September 1995, the county settled, agreeing
to pay him a lump sum of $49,362, in addition to giving him his
$30,000 annual early retirement. At the time, the county was settling
similar claims for lump sums of $3,000 to $4,000 and exceeding
$10,000 in only a handful of cases, workers' compensation records
show.</TE>
<TE>   Clark Schliabach, the county counsel's claims manager,
characterized the settlement as "very rare."</TE>
<TE>   Co-workers recall both Jagels and Tauzer signing off on the
settlement.</TE>

<HD>Neighborhood Aglow With Tradition</HD>
<DH>Every Christmas Eve, residents in part of Casitas Springs
light luminarias -- humble candles in paper bags -- in front of their
homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Ragland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been 26 years, but June Howie still gets tickled seeing her
Casitas Springs neighborhood light up on Christmas Eve with a warm,
flickering glow.</LD>
<LD>   Every Dec. 24 as dusk falls, thousands of luminarias -- candles
twinkling in paper bags weighted with sand -- overtake her street and
two others in the small community just off California 33, south of
Ojai.</LD>
<LD>   And people come from all over -- a few more each year -- to view
the low-tech light show.</LD>
<TE>   Howie brought the tradition to her neighborhood from Albuquerque,
where she lived for eight years and became enchanted with the "little
lights," or farolitos, that edge many walkways, churches, gardens and
neighborhoods during the Christmas season.</TE>
<TE>   When she and her husband, Don, moved back to Ventura County in
1984, they conspired with their three adult children, who lived on
the same street, to set out the little glowing bags the night before
Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Their neighbors liked what they saw and soon followed suit.</TE>
<TE>   Now, two decades later, the luminarias gang is 53 families strong.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just something everyone picked up on," says Howie, a retired
Ventura print shop owner, "and they don't want to let it loose."</TE>
<TE>   The tradition is quite popular in New Mexico and throughout the
Southwest, but it is less prevalent here. The lights can be seen in a
few isolated neighborhoods around Ventura County, as well as at the
Santa Barbara Mission and throughout the Santa Ynez Valley town of
Los Olivos.</TE>
<TE>   In Casitas Springs, the excitement starts to build from about
noon, when residents begin collecting the sand -- trucked in and
dumped on one neighbor's driveway -- they need for the 3,000
luminarias that soon adorn their streets, yards and entryways.</TE>
<TE>   John Dickenson, 44, stood in his driveway on Ranch Road, shoveling
sand from a wheelbarrow into paper bags. He said he really enjoys
being a part of the annual tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "It's cool living in a neighborhood that does this sort of thing,"
Dickenson said. "It gives me something to look forward to."</TE>
<TE>   After all the candles are lighted, residents mill about the
neighborhood, chatting, sharing eggnog and cocoa, and sometimes
engaging in Christmas sing-alongs around small outdoor fires.</TE>
<TE>   "It really is amazing," Howie said. "I ask different people how it
can keep going on, and they just say this is characteristic of our
neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   The idea was a concern at first to firefighters and police, Howie
said, but the luminarias have never caused a problem in Casitas
Springs. The sand keeps the brown paper lunch bags from blowing over
while the short candles burn through the night.</TE>
<TE>   The tradition evolved from bonfires that, centuries ago, were
lighted in Spanish and Mexican villages during Christmas Eve
celebrations.</TE>
<TE>   Later, smaller fires made from crisscrossed pinon sticks were
built in front of each home, meant to light the way for the holy
family.</TE>
<TE>   During the same season, Indians of the Southwest lighted pinon
fires to pay their respects to the spirits.</TE>
<TE>   But how the bonfires ended up in paper bags is less clear. Some
say the custom evolved from the delicate paper lanterns that came to
Mexico via China.</TE>
<TE>   Others prefer a fictional story written by New Mexico novelist
Rudolfo Anaya, which tells of a New Mexico girl who devises the
paper-bag lanterns to keep the tradition alive for her family during
World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Bobbie Lupold, a 13-year Casitas Springs resident, said it's
fitting that luminaria history is somewhat foggy.</TE>
<TE>   "Some things should remain a mystery," she said, adding jokingly,
"like how old I am."</TE>
<TE>   Lupold took over as chief organizer of the event a couple of years
ago when Howie "retired."</TE>
<TE>   It's no easy task. She must take orders months in advance, scour
the Internet for deals on candles and paper bags -- they get up to
3,400 of each -- and then deliver the supplies to 53 homes.</TE>
<TE>   But the finished product, a magical display of pretty little
lights, is well worth it, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We live there because we like a simpler way of life," Lupold
said. "I think this little tradition represents who we are as a
community."</TE>

to the annual tradition and often returns to participate in the
event.</CP>

<LD>If ever there was a doubt that Southern Californians have too much
time on their hands, today I'd like to introduce the winners of the
"We Three Kings" songwriting contest.</LD>
<LD>   Humor. Compassion. Anger. Pathos. In dozens of entries, a little
bit of everything came in over the transom, and what better time to
open this package of love than Christmas Day?</LD>
<LD>   In case you missed it, I wrote a column early this month pointing
out that Angelenos are going to end up on their knees at the Pearly
Gates.</LD>
<TE>   Compared to other cities, we don't exactly wear halos when it
comes to charitable giving.</TE>
<TE>   I challenged readers to address this shortcoming by making a
donation to the L.A. Times Holiday Campaign, and by writing a few
verses to lampoon all the deadbeats out there.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sorry to have to report that not everyone is capable of
following simple instructions. West L.A.'s Michael Allen, for
instance, blew off "We Three Kings" and inexplicably wrote to the
tune of "If You're Happy and You Know It, Clap Your Hands."</TE>
<TE>   What would you expect from a TV scribe who tells me he wrote for
"Beavis and Butt-Head"? I wouldn't even mention him except his ditty
was nothing short of brilliant.</TE>
<TE>   OK, everybody clap along.</TE>
<TE>   If we cannot find Osama, bomb Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   If the markets hurt your mama, bomb Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   If the terrorists are Saudi</TE>
<TE>   And the bank takes back your Audi</TE>
<TE>   And the TV shows are bawdy,</TE>
<TE>   Bomb Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   No enchilada for Mr. Allen, but we might have to go with "Clap
Your Hands" as next year's tune.</TE>
<TE>   Another contestant, Larry Nathenson of West L.A., got the "We
Three Kings" tune right in a satire of the secession movement.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Hahn, he won't let us go,</TE>
<TE>   Says he'll give more services for our dough.</TE>
<TE>   He'll fix our streets,</TE>
<TE>   He'll hire more police.</TE>
<TE>   A better city we'll never know.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, Oh,</TE>
<TE>   Valley city that might have been.</TE>
<TE>   Valley city next time we'll win.</TE>
<TE>   We'll keep our cash,</TE>
<TE>   Collect our own trash</TE>
<TE>   And we'll be free of Mayor Jim.</TE>
<TE>   Darlene Kinsey of Anaheim Hills won big points for including me in
the chorus.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, oh,</TE>
<TE>   Find some nickels, find some dimes.</TE>
<TE>   Send them to the L.A. Times.</TE>
<TE>   Help the colder,</TE>
<TE>   Poorer, older</TE>
<TE>   And thank Steve for all these rhymes.</TE>
<TE>   In a fair world, JoAnne Anderson of Oak Park would be a winner
because her entry included a Post-it note saying: "I'd donate more,
but I'm unemployed."</TE>
<TE>   But enough with the honorable mentions. After the painful task of
thinning the herd, our panel of judges came up with three finalists.</TE>
<TE>   When I asked my editor which of the three finalists to go with, he
suggested declaring all of them winners in honor of the Three Kings.
(This is the kind of thoughtful deliberation that goes on every day
here at the office.)</TE>
<TE>   So who gets free dinner under the vibrant tapestry of velvet
paintings at Los Tacos, located in a West Hollywood mini-mall between
a 7-Eleven and a carwash (and free parking to boot)?</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Langfit of Encino.</TE>
<TE>   Guy and Vivienne O'Brien of Echo Park.</TE>
<TE>   And Janet Bergamo of Piru.</TE>
<TE>   We don't have space to run each entry in full, but without further
ado, here are the highlights:</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Langfit:</TE>
<TE>   Age is something I won't admit.</TE>
<TE>   Nips and tucks to make me look fit.</TE>
<TE>   Botox was chosen,</TE>
<TE>   My face is frozen.</TE>
<TE>   Wrinkles I won't permit.</TE>
<TE>   CHORUS</TE>
<TE>   Oh!</TE>
<TE>   Star of Sony, see the plight</TE>
<TE>   Of the others in your sight.</TE>
<TE>   As you care</TE>
<TE>   And as you share</TE>
<TE>   You can help to make it right.</TE>
<TE>   Guy and Vivienne O'Brien:</TE>
<TE>   FIRST VERSE</TE>
<TE>   These are the things I need in my car:</TE>
<TE>   Four-wheel drive in particular.</TE>
<TE>   ABS action, anti-slip traction.</TE>
<TE>   GPS, maybe Northstar.</TE>
<TE>   SECOND VERSE</TE>
<TE>   Eight mpg sounds fine to me.</TE>
<TE>   Good for Texas and the Big Three.</TE>
<TE>   I suspect the greenhouse effect</TE>
<TE>   Is just a poor wimp's plea.</TE>
<TE>   THIRD VERSE</TE>
<TE>   Call me a glutton, call me a schmuck,</TE>
<TE>   Dufus in a glorified truck.</TE>
<TE>   All you peons in your Neons</TE>
<TE>   Hit me you're out of luck.</TE>
<TE>   CHORUS</TE>
<TE>   Oh, oh,</TE>
<TE>   Exhaust of thunder, torque of might.</TE>
<TE>   SUV with beauty bright.</TE>
<TE>   Never yielding, always wielding.</TE>
<TE>   Horsepower that's out of sight.</TE>
<TE>   Janet Bergamo:</TE>
<TE>   Here, two kings with eyes on Iraq:</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Cheney</TE>
<TE>   Poised for attack.</TE>
<TE>   Nukes abound in North Korea</TE>
<TE>   And yet they receive no flak.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, oh,</TE>
<TE>   Why make war where we can't see</TE>
<TE>   Weapons or activity?</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has oil 'neath its soil.</TE>
<TE>   Korea just has kimchi.</TE>

<HD>'Exhibit A for the Power of Prayer'</HD>
<DH>Pat Boone asked the world to intercede with God in his
grandson's recovery. For those who believe, healing is the result.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Among the estimated 500,000 people in the United States who struggle
each year to recover from brain injuries, Ryan Corbin might be the
most famous.</LD>
<LD>   Eighteen months ago, the eldest grandson of singer Pat Boone
accidentally crashed through his Brentwood apartment building's
skylight and plunged 40 feet to the concrete floor. He fractured his
skull, broke his jaw, and ruptured his spleen. As paramedics arrived,
Corbin, then 25, stopped breathing.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, his slow but steady healing has been called miraculous
-- in Christian magazines and supermarket tabloids, from church
pulpits, on Web sites and on four "Larry King Live" shows on CNN,
including a Christmas special that airs today.</LD>
<TE>   "He's Exhibit A for the power of prayer," said Boone, a crooner
and movie star who became popular in the 1960s for his baby-faced
looks, white shoes and gospel songs. "You can only attribute his
recovery, in light of the medical prognosis, to God."</TE>
<TE>   The fascination with Corbin's recovery goes beyond his minor link
to celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   For those who believe, Corbin's healing illustrates the efficacy
of prayer and serves as a testament to the tens of thousands of
messages spiritually transmitted throughout the world to God for the
26-year-old's healing.</TE>
<TE>   And today marks another milestone in Corbin's story: his first
Christmas at home since the accident.</TE>
<TE>   "This is certainly the best Christmas I've ever had," said Lindy
Michaelis, Ryan's mother and the daughter of Pat Boone, sitting in
her Coto de Caza home in south Orange County. "He's living with us,
he knows who we are, he knows his life has purpose. Seeing him, it's
easy to point to a loving God."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, giving God credit for what some consider to be a
miraculous healing leaves open the question that has nagged the
faithful for ages: What about those who don't get healed, despite the
prayers of many?</TE>
<TE>   "If we knew why everything happens the way it does, then we'd be
as smart as God," said Rick Warren, Corbin's pastor and founder of
Saddleback Church in Lake Forest.</TE>
<TE>   "But we're not God, so we have a limited capacity for
understanding the big picture."</TE>
<TE>   Within days of Corbin's accident, family members asked Christians
through churches and on the Internet to pray for his recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan's father Doug Corbin set up a hotline with daily recordings
so people could pray for his specific needs. And Boone went on "Larry
King Live" to ask viewers around the world to pray for his grandson.</TE>
<TE>   "We got prayers by the millions from all over the world," Boone
said.</TE>
<TE>   After the first King appearance, Boone said he wondered: "What do
you think the apostle Paul or Peter would give for the opportunity
that we just got: to go into 220 nations and have 50 million people
watching?"</TE>
<TE>   Family members said doctors informed them that Ryan would mostly
likely remain in a vegetative state the rest of his life.</TE>
<TE>   Boone remembers one day when a neurologist showed him a CAT scan
of Corbin's brain. He asked the doctor about the large black pattern
that covered most of its brain's surface.</TE>
<TE>   "The doctor said, 'That's atrophy,' " Boone recalled. " 'And
that's permanent.' "</TE>
<TE>   Family members did get doctors to concede that brain injuries are
notoriously fickle, and the brain can bypass permanent damage by
rewiring itself. But Boone said the physicians always warned them,
"Don't get your hopes up."</TE>
<TE>   Today Corbin is just beginning to talk in whispers, a few words at
a time, after an 18-month medical ordeal that included six hospitals,
four operations, 36 units of blood, doctors who asked family members
to consider when they wanted to shut down his life support system,
five months in a coma, and hundreds of hours in rehabilitation
therapy.</TE>
<TE>   A 6-foot-4 former basketball star at Irvine High School who was
president of his Pepperdine University fraternity, Corbin remains in
a wheelchair, his left arm curled tight against his body.</TE>
<TE>   He's not paralyzed, but the signals from his brain have been
jumbled enough that connections have been lost and need to be
reestablished.</TE>
<TE>   These days his progress is measured in tiny increments. On Monday,
for instance, he started biting his nails again.</TE>
<TE>   "You broke that habit; let's not start that again," Michaelis
teasingly tells Ryan, bringing a smile to his face.</TE>
<TE>   "He laughs and jokes now," said Mark Desmond, director of
Tustin-based High Hopes, a head-injury program that Corbin attends
twice a week. "He's a miracle. Can you attribute that to God? Yes. To
great family support? Yes. And to his faith and people who have been
praying for him all over the world."</TE>
<TE>   Academic research over the last decade that tried to determine the
efficacy of prayer in healing has produced mixed results and wide
debate within the medical community.</TE>
<TE>   A 1998 double-blind study at the California Pacific Medical Center
in San Francisco showed that AIDS patients did better when strangers
prayed for their health. Studies at the Mid America Heart Institute
in Kansas City, Mo., and at Duke University showed that cardiac
patients who were prayed for experienced fewer serious health
problems.</TE>
<TE>   But critics point to research at the Mayo Clinic and at Columbia
University that found no connection between healing and prayer.</TE>
<TE>   They also criticize the research methods of many of the studies
and doubt that the effect of prayer, even if it were real, could be
scientifically measured.</TE>
<TE>   For Corbin's family, the studies don't matter. As part of his
speech therapy, Michaelis has him recite with her the words of Jesus
in the Gospel of Matthew: "With God, all things are possible."</TE>
<TE>   To them, prayer has brought him this far. Boone even sees God's
hand in the speed of his grandson's recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "God could do it instantly, but it's quite clear it's going
slowly," said Boone, believing that the long recovery has allowed
thousands to witness the healing.</TE>
<TE>   "Everywhere I go, people ask, 'How's Ryan? How's he doing?' People
have just taken a universal, personal interest in him," and are
seeing through him the "simple goodness and grace of God."</TE>
<TE>   What the public doesn't see is the earthly toil involved in
Corbin's rehabilitation: the spoon-fed meals. The mixing of a
"cognitive drug cocktail" that is poured through a stomach tube. The
building of ramps and remodeling that allowed Ryan to move back home.
His groans in the middle of the night when he needs to turn over. The
mother singing to her 26-year-old son who mouths the words as a
toddler would. The understanding of his brother and sister who now
get less attention from their parents. The neighbors and church
members who volunteer to make meals or run errands.</TE>
<TE>   "When people ask the question, 'Where is God in this tragedy?' I
tell them to look around at all the Christians helping, praying,
supporting, caring, and loving the family -- that's where God is,"
said Pastor Warren. "He's in the hearts of his people, using their
hands, their feet, and their abilities to show God's love in
practical ways."</TE>
<TE>   Before the accident, Ryan was a devout Christian. An aspiring
writer, he wrote an unsold screenplay called "Threesixteen," a modern
version of the story of Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   And his evangelical zeal was a major factor in the conversion of
his stepfather -- a self-proclaimed "hardheaded agnostic" -- to
Christianity two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Both his mother and grandfather recalled conversations shortly
before the accident in which Corbin told them he felt God was about
to use him "in a big way."</TE>
<TE>   Now, as Corbin recovers amid worldwide attention, they both wonder
whether this was part of God's plan.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't look at [the publicity] as a great thing at first,"
Michaelis said. "No way I wanted to go on television and bear my
pain.</TE>
<TE>   "But what an opportunity we have to show God at work."</TE>

worldwide prayer chain was started, and Corbin is home for his first
Christmas since the accident.</CP>

<HD>Martha Nelson, 63; Children's Therapist, Day-Care
Consultant</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martha Streiff Nelson, a children's therapist and nationally
recognized advisor on mental health consulting for day-care centers,
has died. She was 63.</LD>
<LD>   Nelson died Sunday at her Pasadena home after a two-year struggle
with ovarian cancer, said her husband, Bryce Nelson, a professor of
journalism at USC's Annenberg School.</LD>
<LD>   Martha Nelson had spent most of the last decade providing child
development counseling to day-care centers in the Redondo Beach
school district and in San Bernardino. She worked under a program
created by the Cleveland-based Hanna Perkins Center for Child
Development and funded by TRW Inc.</LD>
<TE>   In 2001, the psychoanalytically oriented therapist described her
efforts in a book chapter, "Mental Health Consultations in the
Preschool Day-Care Center."</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Streeter, associate director of the Perkins Center
extension division, said Nelson's work "was integral to the success
of this unique day-care consulting project.... She has uniquely
helped develop the preschool effort in Southern California and the
nation."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Lewiston, Idaho, the former Martha Streiff married Nelson
there in 1961. She was educated at Harvard University, the University
of Munich in Germany, the University of Oxford in England, the
Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis, the Baltimore-D.C. Institute
for Psychoanalysis and the Graduate Center for Child Development and
Psychotherapy in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Prior to becoming a psychotherapist, she taught German and English
at inner-city schools in Washington, D.C., and at the University of
Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson is survived by her husband, a former reporter for the Los
Angeles Times, New York Times and Washington Post; her mother, Elinor
Streiff; two children, Kristin and Matt; three siblings, Julia Evans
and Katrina and Fritz Streiff; and a granddaughter.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is planned Jan. 18 at All Saints Church in
Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that memorial contributions be sent to that
church at 132 N. Euclid Ave., Pasadena, CA 91101; the Graduate Center
for Child Development, 6464 Wilshire Blvd., Room 999, Los Angeles, CA
90048; or the Hanna Perkins Center, 2084 Cornell Road, Cleveland,
Ohio 44106.</TE>

<HD>Daughter of Beverly Hills Found a New Life at Tijuana
Prison</HD>
<DH>Mary Brenner opted in her 50s to discard luxuries and
become a nun. She's a source of light in one of Mexico's darkest
places.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TIJUANA</DL>
<LD>There's one thing Sister Antonia did not leave behind when she
swapped her upscale Southern California life for a nun's habit and a
tiny cell in one of Mexico's most notorious prisons.</LD>
<LD>   Her giggle.</LD>
<LD>   In between visits of succor and support to a seemingly endless
number of prisoners and guards, the 76-year-old, who stands 5 feet 2,
erupts in peals of laughter from dawn till dark.</LD>
<TE>   With a mischievous chuckle, she confirms that prisoners have
tossed their guns away when she has marched into the middle of their
deadly riots. They don't want the woman they call "Mama" to see them
fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Another chuckle accompanies her explanation of the way she trained
for life in a cell surrounded by 4,500 murderers, thieves and drug
dealers: "I'm the mother of seven children," she said. "I'm prepared
for everything."</TE>
<TE>   A quarter-century ago, after her children were grown and divorce
had filled her heart with sadness, Mary Clarke Brenner gave away her
evening clothes, shut the door on her beach house in Ventura and
moved to a cell in Tijuana's La Mesa State Penitentiary. Until it was
cleaned up last summer, it was one of Latin America's most lawless,
violent prisons.</TE>
<TE>   For years, this daughter of Beverly Hills did her work here alone.
But starting this fall, she began spending much of her time with a
French nun from the order of St. John Eudes, working to form a new
association to help other women in midlife who want to make the same
radical change.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many Catholic orders that do not encourage older women to
join, the order founded by Sister Antonia, the Servants of the 11th
Hour, is designed for those who, if not quite in their 11th hour, are
at least in the second half of their lives. Requests for information
have flooded in from women as far away as Brazil and Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   Sister Antonia says seven have joined, most of them former career
women and widows. She has ways of knowing whether someone is right
for the job, she says: Those who ask when dinner time is, or where
they'll be sleeping, may not be.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'A Message of Peace'</TE>
<TE>   When she first came to the prison, some guessed the nun had
committed a heinous crime. Now she is known as the "prison angel."
Warden Sergio Ortiz Lara calls her "a great woman," with "a message
of peace, love, a spiritual message."</TE>
<TE>   As Sister Antonia strode through the prison yard on a recent
Friday, her black-and-white habit flashing and her smile gleaming, a
man rushed up to kiss her. Heads whipped around. Words of love and
praise were called out through the bars. "Mama, look, my teeth are
fixed," cried one prisoner.</TE>
<TE>   A line of men had formed outside her cell, awaiting her counsel.
On the other side of the prison gates, mothers, wives and girlfriends
say they thank God the sister is there for their loved ones.</TE>
<TE>   Raxcon Cruz, 21, an American prisoner who credits Sister Antonia
with changing his life, is among a small army of convicts who spend
their days helping her. Cruz, who once lived in Los Angeles, arrived
at La Mesa last spring to serve a yearlong sentence for drug
trafficking. "I wasn't close to God," he said. "Life was like a
game."</TE>
<TE>   Sister Antonia came to him on his first, terrifying day behind
bars and helped him get food and a blanket. When he gets out next
year, he said, he plans to seek a job in which he can keep helping
her, although he wryly noted that the money won't be nearly as good
as it was in his former line of work.</TE>
<TE>   Clothing and medicine are hard to come by at La Mesa, and Sister
Antonia spends hours trying to patch together basic goods and
services, from bedding to dental care to medicine. She also helps
with bail, using money raised at the soda concession she runs in the
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Her spare cell holds few possessions. A hard single bed occupies
one corner, a mountain of toilet-paper rolls for prisoners the other.</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Villalobos sat on a chair under the barred windows in the
nun's cell, his head bowed. Sister Antonia perched beside him on the
edge of her bed and took his hand.</TE>
<TE>   His voice low, he told her his wife and child were suffering
because he could not provide for them. She touched his face, and
tears formed in his eyes. She hugged him, and two tiny rivers slid
down his cheeks.</TE>
<TE>   She wrote down Villalobos' name and promised to get back to him.
Visibly calmer, he left her cell. "There is no one else to help me
but Mother Antonia," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sister Antonia smiled and looked around the sparse room. "I
wouldn't trade this cell for anywhere in the world," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her love for the prisoners does not mean she condones their acts.
"There isn't anyone who hasn't heard my lecture on victims," she
said. "They have to accept that they're wrong. They have to see the
consequences. They have to feel the agony .... But I do love them
dearly."</TE>
<TE>   Those who have worked with her know that's true, even if they
sometimes have trouble comprehending it. "From Beverly Hills to a
Tijuana prison," said Father Joe Carroll, a San Diego priest who runs
homeless shelters and has given the nun supplies from his St. Vincent
de Paul thrift store over the years -- sometimes, he jokes, against
his will.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time my staff sees her, a truckload goes out [of] my
warehouse," he said. "If I told her she couldn't have it, she'd just
be smiling and giggling at me and putting it into her car and
leaving.</TE>
<TE>   "You walk in her presence and you know you're in a different
world. Rhyme, reason -- you can't rationalize why she did it,"
Carroll said of Sister Antonia's decision to change her life. "She
has that one-on-one relationship with God."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills Childhood</TE>
<TE>   Sister Antonia, on most topics an ebullient conversationalist,
full of whimsical riffs on everything from Nathaniel Hawthorne to the
glorious attributes of German shepherds, is loath to talk about
herself. She is particularly reticent about what she terms the
"glamorous part" of her life.</TE>
<TE>   Her father ran an office supply business in Beverly Hills and
hobnobbed with Hollywood figures. Cary Grant was a neighbor. The nun
still remembers his smile, and the patient kindness he showed to
teenagers charmed like she once was.</TE>
<TE>   Her staunchly Irish Catholic family emphasized charity work. She
jokes that this Irish heritage, as much as the family's Catholicism,
explains her affinity for the dispossessed (she also cites the 1932
movie "I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang").</TE>
<TE>   She married after high school, then raised her brood in Granada
Hills. Volunteer work was always part of her life. In the mid-1950s,
her nephew died at City of Hope hospital in Duarte, and Sister
Antonia, then known as Mary Brenner, began throwing Christmas parties
for patients there.</TE>
<TE>   "I never would have Christmas for my children until we had
Christmas for City of Hope," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Soon she was organizing shipments of medical supplies from
Southern California to Africa and India. Later came a stint helping
the United Farm Workers and making visits with priests to prisons.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't step from my home into a cell," she said. "It was a
series of many steps" -- including an instance of what some might
call coincidence, but Sister Antonia is sure was providence.</TE>
<TE>   Three decades ago, she and a priest crossed the border to deliver
supplies to Tijuana's city jail. They got lost, and wound up at the
state prison.</TE>
<TE>   Sister Antonia was drawn to the need she saw there and soon fell
in love with Mexican culture. Within a few years, she had permission
from the bishop of San Diego to become a nun without joining an
order. She moved to the prison in 1977, several years after she and
her husband had parted.</TE>
<TE>   That subject drops a cloud over her normally smiling face. "I'm
divorced," she said. "That's very painful to say." She will say
nothing more.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Heart Problems</TE>
<TE>   Her home is La Mesa. Except for visits with her children, public
lectures on her work and periods of illness, she has not left the
prison. Nor has the pace of her work slowed, which worries those who
love her.</TE>
<TE>   Plagued by heart problems and shortness of breath, she has an
oxygen tank in her cell. But she insists on answering every knock at
her door. "She never stops," said Joanie Kenesie, 63, a San Diego
widow who helps Sister Antonia, often sleeping in her cell on a cot.
"They call her the Eveready battery."</TE>
<TE>   Sister Antonia hopes her new order will become a lasting
institution, one that continues her work after she is gone. Those who
have joined so far include Sisters Carmen Hendrix and Olivia Fregoso.
They came to her after careers spent at the Rockwell Electronics
plant in Anaheim. "I didn't want to go to Vegas" in retirement,
Hendrix said. But it wasn't until she heard the nun lecture about her
work that she knew what she wanted to do: live on her pension in a
trailer park in San Ysidro, coordinating delivery of supplies across
the border.</TE>
<TE>   Many women feel the way she does, Hendrix said: "They want to
retire and give the best to God." The most difficult part, in many
cases, is making their children understand that, though they will
still be available, their allegiance now goes to God.</TE>
<TE>   The Servants of the 11th Hour have a house near the prison, a
clean, rambling refuge where some sisters live with an ever-changing
cast of former prostitutes, cancer victims and lost children, along
with birds in cages and the cats that peer at them. Beans and
tortillas stay warm all day, ready for indigents who pop in for a
bite.</TE>
<TE>   Another house is under construction nearby; both are funded partly
by parishes in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "We're on our way," Sister Antonia said. "The longest journey
starts with the first step.... It's a wonderful journey that God
brought me on. I always felt for people in prison.... Where I live, I
can do something about it."</TE>

<HD>Burbank Manager Seeking CRA Post</HD>
<DH>Robert 'Bud' Ovrom, credited for revitalizing his city, has
met with L.A. agency's board.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karima A. Haynes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Burbank City Manager Robert "Bud" Ovrom, who is widely praised for
strengthening and diversifying the city's economy with downtown
revitalization projects, has announced that he wants to head the Los
Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency.</LD>
<LD>   Ovrom, 57, is seeking to replace agency Executive Director Jerry
Scharlin, who is expected to step down in January. A search firm has
been hired to locate possible successors.</LD>
<LD>   The veteran city manager, who met with the redevelopment agency
board last week to discuss the position, told his staff in an e-mail
Monday that he is considering the post at a time when Burbank is
politically and economically sound.</LD>
<TE>   "In my heart, I know that it would be easy for me to stay here for
several more years," Ovrom said in his message. "However, in my head
I also know that it would be rejuvenating for me and for the
organization if I moved on."</TE>
<TE>   With a $342-million budget, the redevelopment agency uses property
tax money to provide incentives for development in blighted areas,
including purchasing land and selling it at a discount to builders.</TE>
<TE>   Scharlin was appointed in 1999 by former Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan to head the troubled agency, which was facing serious
financial and political problems. He has been credited with helping
restructure the agency, clarifying its budget and developing a
strategic plan.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank leaders said Tuesday they understand Ovrom's desire to
move on after 17 years as city manager but are saddened by his
possible departure.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an incredible community today in part because of his
consistent guidance and direction over the years," said Susan Bowers,
chief executive and executive director of the Burbank Chamber of
Commerce. "He has a balanced vision for the city that calls for
retail success as well as maintaining the quality of life for
residents."</TE>
<TE>   Before Ovrom took over as city manager in 1985, comedian Johnny
Carson laughingly referred to the city's down-on-its-heels center as
"beautiful downtown Burbank," a commercially barren area with no sign
of today's upscale coffeehouses, bookstores, restaurants, department
stores and movie theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the city's 104,200 residents depended on factory jobs at
Lockheed Corp. When the aerospace giant pulled out in 1996, the
company left behind 20,000 workers and 5 million square feet of
space.</TE>
<TE>   Ovrom is credited with luring entertainment and retail businesses
to shore up the city's faltering economy. "When Lockheed left, we saw
those jobs replaced in relatively quick fashion with well-paying
entertainment jobs," City Councilman David Golonski said.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor David Laurell said the city manager is equally adept at
interpersonal relationships.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a decent, moral person who cares about the people who work
for him," he said. "It may sound over-the-top, but Bud can look out
over the city from his house in the hills and say, 'I've done a good
job,' "</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Ovrom told his staff it's still too early to start
packing. "There are still lots of steps to go through before they
decide if they want me," he said. "There is absolutely no way right
now to know how things might turn out."</TE>

<HD>Christmas Is Move-In Day for a Family Many Are Glad to Help</HD>

<LD>When they blessed the house 11 days ago, the tears started falling.
The work had been so hard and swift and the cause so uplifting that
when the dozens of workers formed a circle around the house to
celebrate a job well done, the emotions were too much and so the
tears came.</LD>
<LD>   To the Fuentes family, it was the miracle house, built in seven
days by a coalition of caring people just so Mauricio and Iris and
their five delightful daughters could move in by Christmas Day.</LD>
<LD>   They made it. On Tuesday, the Fuentes family got the keys to their
four-bedroom, 1,200 square-foot home on the corner of Bristol Street
and Borchard Avenue in Santa Ana.</LD>
<TE>   "I can tell you, we were blessed," Iris Fuentes is saying on
Christmas Eve afternoon, flanked by three daughters and reliving the
whirlwind dream that will have them in their home today or soon
thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   Lots of Heroes</TE>
<TE>   Heroes abound in this tale -- too many, in fact, to cite
adequately.</TE>
<TE>   The home was built through a partnership of the Lennar Homes
company, Habitat for Humanity and, for the first time on an Orange
County project, the local chapter of Special Olympics, which provided
about 30 of its mentally or physically impaired athletes.</TE>
<TE>   For 12 years, the Fuentes family had lived in a one-bedroom
apartment in Westminster. In recent months, they'd moved in with
Iris's sister and her two children in her small Westminster home. A
couple of years ago, Iris heard through her daughters about Habitat
for Humanity, which builds homes for poor people, and she applied.</TE>
<TE>   Now 37, Iris contracted polio in her native Guatemala when she was
3, and the condition in her right leg has been worsening. She limps,
and someday might need a wheelchair. The new home has special
accommodations for her.</TE>
<TE>   But this story isn't about floor plans or paint jobs. It's about
dozens of anonymous volunteers and a family that -- please take my
word for this -- is immensely grateful.</TE>
<TE>   "You see us smiling and laughing now," Iris says, adding that life
has cast some dark shadows, as well. The five girls have shared a
bedroom over the years. Mauricio is a machinist, but the family
hasn't been able to qualify for a home loan and hasn't been able to
afford a multi-bedroom apartment.</TE>
<TE>   This Christmas, you can see the buoyancy in Iris's face and in her
daughters, who said they had a wild living room celebration in early
August when a Habitat official carrying flowers knocked on the door
and told them: "You're going to have a house."</TE>
<TE>   The job was finished Dec. 14, except for some follow-up work that
delayed moving day. "It's amazing for everyone," Iris says. "It
started from flat cement, and it rose like a flower."</TE>
<TE>   An hourlong visit gave me a glimpse of the Fuentes family that,
according to people associated with the project, made it all the more
rewarding.</TE>
<TE>   A Special Family</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was in tears, because the family is a very special
family," says Tanya Hebert-Scott, a Habitat volunteer and the liaison
with the Fuentes family.</TE>
<TE>   "They lived in a one-bedroom apartment for 12 years. They're such
humble people. They're just nice. And so deserving," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt really good to do something for someone who showed
genuine gratitude for everyone involved."</TE>
<TE>   For the Special Olympians, who handled various chores, the job let
them return some community favors.</TE>
<TE>   "We're so often the recipient of giving and philanthropy," says
Special Olympics official Charlene Ferris, "that this is our chance
to give back and let people interact with our athletes."</TE>
<TE>   The disabled workers, who have various levels of mental
retardation, knew what their efforts meant.</TE>
<TE>   "What came across," Ferris says, " was they knew they were
building a home for someone and that the people would have it by
Christmas. They could understand, here was a family who needed a
chance, and they felt they were making a difference for them. They
have a strong sense of home and family and they saw they were
allowing these people to have a better family life."</TE>
<TE>   Expressing Gratitude</TE>
<TE>   Iris wanted to hug each worker. She hoped her English wouldn't
fail her when she wanted to convey her family's gratitude to the
volunteer workforce. Reflecting on the tears that flowed on Dec. 14
when a minister blessed the house with a prayer and people encircled
it, she says, "It was because of the significance it brought to our
family. The people who worked there, they made it special.</TE>
<TE>   "I call them my angels."</TE>
<TE>   It's a safe bet none of the homebuilders need any thanks. Their
kindness comes with its own reward.</TE>
<TE>   It's just too bad, though, they couldn't have been there the day
before Christmas when the family got the keys to the house and heard
Iris's reaction: "It's the best present of my life."</TE>

<HD>New Rule Runs Pedicabs Off the Streets</HD>
<DH>Santa Barbara passes ordinance requiring operators to
obtain license and insurance, which forces them to stop the free
service.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Johnson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>Every Christmas season needs a Scrooge.</LD>
<LD>   This year, people here are nominating the leadership of this sunny
postcard municipality for the role. Their offense? Shutting down the
fleet of bicycle taxis that added color and energy to the town's
night life.</LD>
<LD>   The pedicabs, as they are called, had for five years ferried
tourists around town and made sure that drunks spilling out of the
bars on downtown's State Street got home safely.</LD>
<TE>   "They'd tell us, 'I don't have any money, can you get me somewhere
safe?' " said Seth Tuton, 28. "We'd give them free rides."</TE>
<TE>   Tuton may be biased in favor of the oddball vehicles, which,
gilded with fake flowers and palm fronds, resembled small Mardi Gras
floats. He operated one of the two pedicab businesses, North American
Rickshaw Co. But other State Street denizens lamented the demise of
the cabs, which ran afoul of new city rules requiring insurance and a
business license.</TE>
<TE>   "People loved the pedicabs," said Katie Watrous, 20-year-old
assistant manager of the Hot Spots coffee shop, where many of the
riders relaxed after work. "They were good guys. It shouldn't have
happened, at least right before Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   Even Mayor Marty Blum professed fondness for the pedicab fleet,
which on busy nights ranged up to 20 pedal-driven vehicles, and the
distinctly unbusinesslike businessmen who operated them. Her husband
plays beach volleyball with Tuton, a long-faced young man with dark,
curly hair who prefers sandals and a Hawaiian shirt to a suit and
tie. He drives, and lives in, a 1971 Volkswagen van decorated with
images of cresting waves.</TE>
<TE>   "We love our pedicabs," Blum said.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was they weren't licensed with the city, nor were they
insured against accidents. Not long ago, the brakes failed on one and
it ran into a stopped car, jarring two pregnant women who had to be
checked out at the hospital. (Both were fine.)</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the problem of public safety, said Lt. Mike Aspland
of the Santa Barbara Police Department. He said one driver was
arrested for allegedly prowling outside the home of two women whom he
had just given a ride. The district attorney declined to file the
case.</TE>
<TE>   Based on these and other incidents, the City Council passed a set
of regulations that took effect this month requiring the pedicab
operators to pay a $55 city license fee and obtain insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "We are requiring them to go through the same process as everybody
else" operating a business, Aspland said.</TE>
<TE>   To him, it's no big deal. To Tuton, it's a very big problem. He
said insurance would cost him $1,200 for each cab, a figure Aspland
disputes.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have that kind of money," Tuton said. Particularly
because he made a practice of not charging for the rides. People who
wanted to give tips did so. Once he got $100 for taking actor Richard
Gere and a date just down the road to Montecito. But that was a
rarity.</TE>
<TE>   There was a good reason to work only for tips. The old city rules
exempted from business license requirements those businesses that
didn't charge for their services. But Tuton said he wouldn't charge
customers even if he could. The pedicab business changed his life.</TE>
<TE>   Tuton was in the Navy before hitching his bicycle to a dream.</TE>
<TE>   He was accustomed to the hardness of military life and military
thinking.</TE>
<TE>   "Being in the Navy, people yelled at me all the time," he said. "I
came out here and people loved me."</TE>
<TE>   He started with "zero money and one pedicab." He now has 15 stored
away at a cost of $300 a month while he beds down in the back of his
van. What Tuton misses most is the people: the locals who had drunk
their wallets dry but thanked him for getting them home safely, the
foreign visitors who took pictures of him.</TE>
<TE>   He even met his girlfriend while sitting on his bike. She walked
up and gave him a rose.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand they're concerned about safety," he said of the
city. "But we really haven't had any problems. Why doesn't the city
try to help someone who is trying to do good?"</TE>
<TE>   Aspland isn't buying the poor mouth routine. He believes the
operators can afford the fees and insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "They average $200 to $300 a night," he said, a figure Tuton
disputes.</TE>
<TE>   The city modeled its ordinance on pedicab regulations already in
use in San Diego and San Francisco, Aspland said. The companies in
those cities seem to be doing OK.</TE>
<TE>   That hasn't silenced the critics. A national TV film crew came
through a while back and stopped to see Mayor Blum. The interviewer,
she recalled, asked her if she was running a totalitarian state.</TE>
<TE>   She joshed back that she wouldn't run for mayor in a totalitarian
state. Then the reporter called the council members busybodies.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I am a busybody," Blum said.</TE>
<TE>   But there may yet be a solution to the pedicab pedagogy. Tuton and
the other operator, who has since left town, stopped in to see the
mayor recently.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides came away feeling some progress was made. In the
meantime, it looks like the State Street drunks are going to have to
fend for themselves this New Year's Eve.</TE>

<HD>Anaheim to Settle Profiling Lawsuit</HD>
<DH>A Korean man who says he was arrested in a CHP officer's
killing because of his race will get $50,000. City officials deny any
wrongdoing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Seema Mehta</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anaheim has agreed to pay $50,000 to a Korean man who claimed that
racial profiling by officers caused him to be wrongly detained for
two days on suspicion of killing a California Highway Patrol officer.</LD>
<LD>   Anaheim officials said they settled the long-running case as a
matter of expediency and insisted Tuesday that police officers did
nothing improper.</LD>
<LD>   "There is absolutely no wrongdoing on the part of the city of
Anaheim or the Anaheim Police Department. The settlement has nothing
to do with officers doing something wrong," said Mark Gordon, deputy
city attorney. "You litigate a case for six years, you put in a lot
of time and money. There comes a time when you just want closure."</LD>
<TE>   Yong Ho Choi was arrested in 1996 on suspicion of killing CHP
Officer Don Burt Jr. After he was released, a Vietnamese gang member
was arrested and later convicted in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Choi was taken into custody at gunpoint on an Anaheim street
corner shortly after a gunman shot CHP rookie Burt seven times in
Fullerton and fled in the officer's car. The car was abandoned in
Anaheim, and Choi was found waiting for a bus nearby. Several
eyewitnesses identified him as the man Burt pulled over.</TE>
<TE>   He was released after police said evidence, such as fingerprints
and gunpowder tests, failed to link him to the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Hung Thanh Mai, 25, of Anaheim was later convicted and sentenced
to death.</TE>
<TE>   Choi sued Anaheim as well as Fullerton, whose police led the
investigation. He said he was the victim of racial profiling, noting
that officers arrested him after a general description of an Asian
man was broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to reach Choi or his attorney, Stephen Yagman, were
unsuccessful.</TE>

<HD>Anaheim OKs Settlement in Profiling Case</HD>
<DH>A Korean man who says he was arrested in a CHP officer's
killing because of his race will get $50,000. City officials deny any
wrongdoing.</DH>

<LD>Anaheim has agreed to pay $50,000 to a Korean man who claimed that
racial profiling by officers caused him to be detained for two days
on suspicion of killing a California Highway Patrol officer.</LD>
<LD>   Anaheim officials said they settled the long-running case as a
matter of expediency and insisted Tuesday that police officers did
nothing improper.</LD>
<LD>   "There is absolutely no wrongdoing on the part of the city of
Anaheim or the Anaheim Police Department. The settlement has nothing
to do with officers doing something wrong," said Mark Gordon, deputy
city attorney.</LD>
<TE>   "You litigate a case for six years, you put in a lot of time and
money. There comes a time when you just want closure."</TE>
<TE>   Yong Ho Choi was arrested in 1996 on suspicion of killing CHP
Officer Don Burt Jr.</TE>
<TE>   After he was released, a Vietnamese gang member was arrested and
later convicted in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Choi was taken into custody at gunpoint on an Anaheim street
corner shortly after a gunman shot CHP rookie Burt seven times in
Fullerton and fled in the officer's car.</TE>
<TE>   The car was abandoned in Anaheim, and Choi was found waiting for a
bus nearby. Several eyewitnesses identified him as the man Burt
pulled over.</TE>
<TE>   He was released after police said evidence, such as fingerprints
and gunpowder tests, failed to link him to the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Hung Thanh Mai, 25, of Anaheim was later convicted and sentenced
to death.</TE>
<TE>   Choi sued Anaheim as well as Fullerton, whose police led the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was the victim of racial profiling, noting that
officers arrested him after a general description of an Asian man was
broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   Choi received a $35,000 settlement from Fullerton in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit against Anaheim was initially thrown out by a Superior
Court judge. But in 2000, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
ordered a trial in the case. The justices noted that police detained
Choi even though the description of the gunman was of a younger and
taller Vietnamese man.</TE>
<TE>   The justices said they "expect more" from officers patrolling a
racially diverse area.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to reach Choi and his attorney, Stephen Yagman, were
unsuccessful.Gordon, the Anaheim attorney, said that while it was
unfortunate that an innocent man was taken into custody, he defended
the officers' actions. Police acted appropriately, he said, given
that Choi was found near the patrol car and was identified by
eyewitnesses.</TE>
<TE>   "It followed basic procedure," he said. "I think it's good police
work. I don't know what else officers were expected to do under the
circumstances. They did exactly what they should have done."</TE>

<DH>They were childhood sweethearts, but war and fate

<LD>When Edward Jones finally asked Arlene Decker to marry him, she
agreed without hesitation. "And I would have more than 50 years
ago,'' said Decker, "if you'd asked."</LD>
<LD>   Decker and Jones, both 78, have known each other since childhood,
growing up on neighboring farms in Alden, Okla. They were high school
sweethearts. He wanted to be a journalist. She wanted to teach.</LD>
<LD>   World War II derailed their dreams. Jones enlisted in the Army Air
Force. Decker dropped out of college and went to visit a sister in
Sierra Madre.</LD>
<TE>   Before she left, she sat at the square oak table in her family's
farmhouse and wrote her sweetheart a letter. She had no fancy
stationery; she used ordinary lined paper. She told him of her plans
to travel, saying he could write to her in care of her mother.</TE>
<TE>   In closing, she wrote what, until that moment, she had lacked the
courage to say: "Edward Jones, I love you."</TE>
<TE>   She mailed the letter to Jones' mother, asking her to pass it
along as soon as she got an address for her son. A forgetful woman,
Jones' mother placed the letter on a shelf.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a child, Arlene Walter lived in a two-bedroom farmhouse with
her parents, her grandmother and her older brother and sister. Her
mother made their clothes. The farm had no electricity or plumbing.
At 15, Walter and her best friend, Norma Dean Barton, worked in the
cook shack during summer vacation, making stew, cobbler and biscuits
for a seven-man threshing crew that went from farm to farm harvesting
wheat and oats.</TE>
<TE>   When Jones, who had joined the threshing crew, strode in and sat
on a stool, Walter caught her breath. She'd had a crush on him all
year.</TE>
<TE>   He had a slender, athletic build and his dark hair had a hint of
red. He wore overalls, a blue cotton shirt, a straw cowboy hat and
work shoes. He was quiet and respectful. He paused before speaking.
He never swore. She always made sure his ice tea glass was filled.</TE>
<TE>   "He was real cute," she recalled.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't long before the rest of the crew was teasing Jones about
the young woman who rolled her long dark brown hair into a pompadour
and served him enough ice tea for three men.</TE>
<TE>   That summer, they began dating.</TE>
<TE>   Jones would borrow his father's La Salle with its whitewall tires,
fetch Walter, and they'd go off to the movies in Carnegie, a town 15
miles away. The La Salle was long and flashy, and everybody could see
it coming. Walter's brother would provide a running commentary on
Jones' approach as he drove to their house.</TE>
<TE>   Jones was a hard worker, her father thought. Of all the young men
in the neighborhood, her father liked Jones best. The teenager played
football, baseball and basketball -- and played them well. Jones'
mother and Walter's mother had known each other for years.</TE>
<TE>   Walter went out with other young men, but if she had a date with
someone and Jones asked her out, she'd cancel her plans to be with
him. She'd laugh and scold that he was too sure of her feelings for
him.</TE>
<TE>   After Jones joined the Army, Walter began dating one of his
rivals, a fellow named Jack Rife, who played baseball on an opposing
high school team. She was 18. When she told her mother she and Rife
were engaged, her mother laughed. Angry, Arlene Walter pointed out
that her mother had cried when her sister became engaged.</TE>
<TE>   "That's because your sister was serious," her mother replied.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after that, Walter began wearing Rife's ring. Jones, who
hadn't yet shipped out, asked her out on a Saturday night. Walter
accepted, canceling her date with Rife. That evening, Jones paid no
attention to the ring on her finger. But when Rife spotted the couple
sitting in a car, he demanded his ring back. She gave it to him.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, Rife asked her to reconsider.</TE>
<TE>   Arlene Walter refused.</TE>
<TE>   "I always knew Edward was the one. He was the only one I ever
thought of," she said. "It was just something about whenever I'd see
him. Chemistry. I have no idea. I thought he was the best thing ever,
and he must have thought the same about me because he was constantly
coming to visit."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'She Was My Honey'</TE>
<TE>   Jones lived on a farm three miles from the Walters place. His
father was stern, no-nonsense. He believed the measure of a man was
in how hard he worked. Before school, Edward Jones milked the cows,
fed the hogs and calves, fed and harnessed the horses, and turned the
crank on the separator that divided the cream from the milk. After
school, chores kept him busy until supper.</TE>
<TE>   He was allowed to play sports only when he wasn't needed on the
farm. He often missed practices and games. His father usually would
let him borrow the La Salle if he agreed to take along his two
younger sisters. Was anything more embarrassing than having the girls
tag along?</TE>
<TE>   Jones didn't notice Walter until he joined the harvest crew. Her
attention to him was flattering. Plenty of fellows wanted to ask her
out. She stood 5-feet-2. Her hair reached well below her shoulders.
Her laugh was infectious and comforting.</TE>
<TE>   For his senior class party, Jones asked his father if he could
borrow the car. Sure, his father said, if you take your sister along.
But Edward Jones had another companion in mind. He asked Arlene
Walter, and she picked him up in her family's car.</TE>
<TE>   "She was my honey," Jones recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Then came World War II. If he'd stayed in Oklahoma, Jones figured
he would have asked Walter to marry him. But he had friends who had
married before shipping overseas, and he didn't think it made sense.</TE>
<TE>   He was posted to Italy. He manned the nose gun on a B-24
Liberator. He always believed he'd come back home. He was not much of
a letter writer. In the three years he was in the military, he rarely
wrote to his mother.</TE>
<TE>   He never wrote to Arlene Walter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Agonizing Months</TE>
<TE>   Every night, Arlene Walter prayed for Edward Jones. Their hometown
was so tiny that word spread fast when a young man was killed or
injured. She knew he was alive. As the months went by, she figured
he'd gotten involved with another woman. Or the equally painful
possibility that he no longer wanted her.</TE>
<TE>   Three days after Arlene Walter's arrival in Sierra Madre, her
sister left to be with her husband, who was being shipped overseas.
Walter knew no one in town. Although she'd only planned on visiting
her sister, she decided to stay. She worked in a bakery and fell in
love with the baker's son. When he proposed, she accepted. She became
Arlene Decker, and the couple had two children.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Jones returned from the war and called on Walter's parents.
Her father told him she had married. Two years later, Jones fell in
love and married. He and his wife also had two children.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   They Meet Again</TE>
<TE>   Arlene Decker and Edward Jones wouldn't meet again until 1993, at
the 50th anniversary of their high school graduation back in
Oklahoma. The high school itself no longer existed. She had come
without her husband, who had suffered a stroke years earlier. She sat
next to Norma Dean Barton and the old friends caught up on each
other's lives. Barton, who was facing the door, kept interrupting to
tell Decker which classmate had just walked in.</TE>
<TE>   There's Edward, Barton suddenly announced. Decker quickly turned
to look. Jones hadn't changed at all, she thought. He hadn't gained
weight. He looked the same, except that on this night, he wore a
suit. She'd seen him in a suit only once before, at high school
graduation.</TE>
<TE>   "I still knew I had feelings for him, but nothing was going to
happen," she recalled. "I knew I really liked him, but I was
married."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cold Shoulder</TE>
<TE>   Jones arrived at the reunion without his wife, who was visiting
family. Almost immediately, he was miffed. The 12 classmates on hand
had greeted him warmly. The women hugged and kissed him. Except for
Arlene Decker.</TE>
<TE>   That, he thought, was cold, downright snobbish. She had snubbed
him decades ago, he thought, and now she'd done it again.</TE>
<TE>   He sat across from her at the long dinner table. Banter was an
easy distraction.</TE>
<TE>   One classmate, always such a runt, had grown into a huge, tall
fellow, a millionaire living in a mansion in Denver. Jones enjoyed
their company, even more as adults than when they were kids.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the evening, the group milled about, saying goodbye.
Everyone promised to meet again. They'd hold their own reunion every
two years, they vowed.</TE>
<TE>   Then Edward Jones felt his anger well up. He looked over at Arlene
Decker and finally unburdened himself. "Arlene is a heartbreaker," he
blurted out.</TE>
<TE>   Her face grew hot. How dare he? she thought.</TE>
<TE>   Then she tore into him. "You have no one to blame but yourself,"
she said. "You didn't write to me. You never answered my letter."</TE>
<TE>   He was baffled. What letter? What on Earth was she talking about?</TE>
<TE>   She was making it up, he thought.</TE>
<TE>   On a hunch, he went home and dug through his mother's belongings.
She had died many years earlier. In a metal box, he came across an
unopened envelope. The handwriting was familiar.</TE>
<TE>   It was Arlene Walter's. She wrote of her love and offered to wait
for him. Unless, of course, his feelings for her had changed. Jones
showed the letter to his wife. It was, he thought, one of those
twists of fate.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly Alone</TE>
<TE>   Jones and Decker saw each other at two more class reunions.</TE>
<TE>   In September 1997, Jones' wife, a diabetic, slipped into a coma.
After 49 years of marriage, she died.</TE>
<TE>   Several months later, he ran into a cousin of Decker's in Oklahoma
and told her, "If Arlene is ever single, I'm going to marry her."</TE>
<TE>   In March 1998, after 54 years of marriage, Decker's husband died.
Jones called her in Sierra Madre to offer his condolences. He called
two more times to chat. Then he called again in early June.</TE>
<TE>   She was standing in her dining room. It was midmorning. After
asking how she was doing, he said, I've got a question for you.</TE>
<TE>   "Would you marry me?"</TE>
<TE>   Three months later, on Aug. 22, 1998, Arlene Decker and Edward
Jones were wed. They now live happily in Decker's house and visit
Oklahoma twice a year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Six fishermen are losing up to $3,000 a week because their boats are
trapped inside Santa Cruz harbor by a storm-whipped sandbar.</LD>
<LD>   The boats are unlikely to go to sea again until about the second
week in January, when a dredging crew hopes to have the mouth of the
harbor cleared.</LD>
<LD>   About 60,000 cubic yards of sand washed into the channel over the
last 10 days, leaving an opening so shallow that none of the 1,000
boats that call the harbor home can get in or out.</LD>

<HD>Woman Faces Charges of Fake Nuptials</HD>
<DH>She is accused of brokering dozens of marriages for men
from the Middle East and Africa. Authorities are seeking terrorism

<LD>Los Angeles authorities have charged a 45-year-old San Fernando
Valley woman with brokering dozens of sham marriages for men from the
Middle East and North Africa seeking U.S. citizenship.</LD>
<LD>   While neither the LAPD nor the FBI has raised suspicions that
Sharon Whiteside of Winnetka was involved in anything other than a
phony-document ring, they have taken an interest in the case because
similar scams have been linked to suspected terrorists establishing
residence in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   "We have no indications that any of these people have terrorist
connections," said LAPD Lt. Adam Bercovici. "But it is an area we are
looking at because we know other people, with similar operations,
have been linked to terrorism."</LD>
<TE>   Citing the ongoing investigation, Los Angeles FBI spokesman
Matthew McLaughlin declined to comment. He did say the FBI is
concerned about foreign nationals gaining U.S. citizenship by any
phony means, including sham marriages, particularly "if there is even
a possibility they are doing it to forward a terrorist effort."</TE>
<TE>   During a brief appearance in Van Nuys Superior Court on Monday,
Whiteside was arraigned on three counts of filing a false document
and held on $100,000 bail after pleading not guilty. At the same
time, $100,000 bench warrants were issued for three men -- two from
Tunisia and one from India -- who allegedly took part in the phony
marriages.</TE>
<TE>   Whiteside, who is scheduled to appear in court again Jan. 6, was
arrested without incident last Thursday at her home by LAPD
detectives and FBI agents assigned to a Joint Terrorism Task Force.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest, authorities said, culminated a months-long
investigation of Whiteside for allegedly arranging phony marriages
between low-income women in the U.S. and foreign men, almost all of
them from the Middle East and North Africa. Over the course of
several years, according to Bercovici, the alleged scam may have
involved as many as 200 phony marriages, sometimes three or four in
the same day.</TE>
<TE>   Bercovici said women would sign statements indicating that they
had been living with the men as wives, even in cases in which they
had only met hours before.</TE>
<TE>   The fee for arranging the bogus marriages ranged from $4,000 to
$10,000, with the women also receiving as much as $1,000 a month
while the men waited for a year to pass before they could end the
marriage and still keep their citizenship, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like she was doing a pretty lucrative business,"
Bercovici said. "Based on what I have seen so far, it seems as if it
was a profit-driven operation ... but there are other things we are
looking at," he said, refusing to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Although sham marriages have long been used as a vehicle for
illegally gaining citizenship, they have received more attention
since the terrorist attacks Sept. 11, 2001, in New York City and the
Washington, D.C., area. Specifically, authorities have zeroed in on
the ability of foreign nationals -- some of them with extremist links
-- to enter the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Lebanese-born Mohammed Hammoud was convicted in North
Carolina of funneling funds to a suspected terrorist group. During
the trial he never disputed prosecution claims that he married three
women in the U.S. at the same time in an effort to gain citizenship.</TE>

<HD>Heavy Snow Daunts Even Hardy Town</HD>
<DH>Truckee is used to the white stuff. But 10 feet in a short
span -- plus days in the dark without power -- was more than
residents bargained for.</DH>

<DL>TRUCKEE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Perched high near Lake Tahoe and notorious for its fierce winter
storms, this is a town whose residents are not easily impressed by
foul weather.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the last 11 days here have earned the attention of even the
hardiest of citizens, as a series of storms dumped more than 10 feet
of snow at higher elevations and knocked the power out to more than
2,000 homes. Nearly all the customers had their electricity restored
by Tuesday, but many spent most of last week living in the dark.</LD>
<LD>   The hardships for Truckee and other mountain communities provided
some good news, however, for the rest of the state. The drifts are
building the critical Sierra snowpack in a state that has been
struggling its way out of a drought.</LD>
<TE>   The storms boosted a meager Sierra snowpack to 147% of normal in
the central Sierra and 149% of normal in the southern part of the
range, according to the California Department of Water Resources.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Diamond, an engineer with the agency, pointed out, however,
that last winter also started with heavy snows then largely fizzled
after Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a matter of whether it will continue to snow at an
above-average pace," Diamond said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that more runoff than usual will be soaked up by the
ground because the dry spell has left the water table so low in many
places.</TE>
<TE>   The heavy snow has also been a boon to holiday skiers.</TE>
<TE>   But many Truckee residents had a hard time in recent days
appreciating those benefits. Many lost water and phone service.
Schools were forced to shut down early for the holiday break. And the
weather was often too lousy to ski at any of the area's seven
resorts.</TE>
<TE>   Even getting around was dicey: Interstate 80, the white-knuckler
of a road that links the region to the outside world, was opened and
closed several times last week because of low visibility and frequent
wrecks.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lived in the area since the 1970s, and I've never seen
anything like that, with the power outage," said Jerry Lander, the
supervisor of local California Department of Transportation crews
responsible for clearing Interstate 80. "But that's part of the deal
of living in Truckee."</TE>
<TE>   Life for most residents was finally getting back to normal early
this week, as thousands of families descended on the region Monday
for the biggest ski week of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Town and resort officials expressed relief, having feared that the
area's economy would take a hit if Bay Area skiers stayed home
because of the outage or poor weather.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of people here, and we have a lot of powder," said
Katharine Lange, spokeswoman for Homewood Mountain Resort at Lake
Tahoe. "It's so cool."</TE>
<TE>   There may be even more powder soon. There is a 60% chance of snow
tonight, and a larger storm is expected to slam into the area this
weekend, possibly bringing 12 more inches of snow and more high
winds, the National Weather Service said.</TE>
<TE>   The Truckee area already looks as it usually does at the end of
winter.</TE>
<TE>   The town of 15,000 sits a few miles east of Donner Pass, directly
in the path of storms that sweep off the Pacific and run headlong
into the High Sierra. The monster of all winters was in 1931-32, when
819 inches of snow fell in the area, with the runner-up 1981-82, when
796 inches were recorded.</TE>
<TE>   It was just outside town that the Donner Party became bogged down
in early autumn snows in 1846. In the end, 41 pioneers died of cold
and hunger, and a few survivors resorted to cannibalism.</TE>
<TE>   That tragedy set local expectations for winters that can be an
endurance test.</TE>
<TE>   The latest round kicked in the weekend of Dec. 14-15, when
unusually warm weather gave way to rain, followed quickly by a heavy
and wet snow.</TE>
<TE>   That's when the winds hit. One gust reached 134 mph over the
mountain ridges, and sustained gusts of 80 mph to 100 mph were
measured in Truckee. An unknown number of trees toppled under the
weight of the snow, taking with them many of the power lines that run
directly into homes.</TE>
<TE>   The Truckee Donner Public Utility District, joined by crews from
as far as the Central Valley, had to go from home to home to reattach
the lines. When the onslaught began, the district's line crews worked
28 hours straight, took an eight-hour break and then went back for an
18-hour shift.</TE>
<TE>   "And we've been working 16-hour days ever since," said Jim Wilson,
the district's electric utility superintendent. "I'm sorry I'm kind
of stuttering a little bit, but I'm kind of gooney myself right now."</TE>
<TE>   The outage could have been worse. Most full-time residents had
either wood-burning stoves or furnaces hooked up to propane gas in
their homes, allowing them to stay somewhat warm. Refrigerators were
packed with snow to keep food fresh.</TE>
<TE>   "That first night was fun. We had candles and kerosene lamps, and
we played cards," said Pam Gardner, a 25-year resident who went five
days without power. "But that second night it got old fast and, at
that point, it just became survival."</TE>
<TE>   Although crowds appeared to be huge Monday at almost all the
resorts near Truckee, that wasn't the case last week, when high winds
and snow made being on the slopes an endurance test. At Alpine
Meadows Ski Resort, a few of the chairlifts on the higher runs were
buried by the snow.</TE>
<TE>   Even the town's Tahoe Forest Hospital, which sometimes sees dozens
of broken bones a day during ski season, had a quiet week because so
few people were skiing.</TE>
<TE>   But hospital spokeswoman Teri Smith said the high number of
shut-ins this week could lead to a boom in the maternity ward this
summer.</TE>
<TE>   A few miles away at Donner Lake, Pat McQuary, a lineman for the
utility district, helped put up lines on one of the last streets
without power Monday. A few residents drove by and waved, no one
seeming too upset about the long outage.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been working every day from 6:30 a.m. until 8:30 p.m., and
when I get home, I don't even feel like eating. I just go to bed," he
said. "I'll tell you who one of those new fathers isn't going to be
next August: me."</TE>

<HD>Zine Targets Strip Club for Cleanup</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spurred by complaints from neighboring businesses and residents, Los
Angeles City Councilman Dennis Zine has confronted the owners of a
Tarzana strip club as being a nuisance in need of a cleanup.</LD>
<LD>   Zine, a reserve police officer who conducted a search of the
Frisky Kitty in October, said he has received numerous complaints
about unsavory characters hanging around and used condoms littering
an adjacent parking lot.</LD>
<LD>   "We've had problems with this place for a long time," he said.
"The community is up in arms and they've asked me to take aggressive
action."</LD>
<TE>   A week after his initial visit to the Oxnard Street club, Zine
drove Police Chief William J. Bratton by the premises for a
first-hand look. They cruised through the parking lot and surrounding
area.</TE>
<TE>   The club's owner has denied any criminal activity in his
establishment and recently filed a $100-million lawsuit against Zine,
charging harassment. He contends that business plummeted because of
Zine's actions.</TE>
<TE>   In the lawsuit, Zine is accused of barging into the club in
uniform and conducting an impromptu raid aimed at putting it out of
business. Zine said the "five-minute" inspection was part of a
routine bar check for illicit activity.</TE>
<TE>   "We have put the city of Los Angeles on notice that we may be a
little club, but we are not going to be pushed around," said Max
Amadi, spokesman for club owner Jamal Haddad.</TE>

Amadi, spokesman for club owner Jamal Haddad."We are a very
restricted, highly watched business," Amadi said. "There has been no
prostitution, no drugs sold. The last place you want to do something
illegal is a strip club because all eyes are watching you."</TE>
<TE>   During his October visit, Zine allegedly entered the club about 10
p.m. and began searching for alcohol, which is prohibited in
establishments with nude entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   "They went behind the [juice] bar, they went in the back. It was
an absolutely illegal search," Amadi said.</TE>
<TE>   Zine said his inspection was nothing out of the ordinary.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been curious about this place for a long time. I didn't want
to go in as a councilman, so I went in in uniform" as part of a
routine check, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a legal right to do that," he said. No citations were
issued.</TE>
<TE>   The councilman called the $100 million in damages sought by the
club's owner "outrageous" and questioned the motive.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they wanted to frighten me and intimidate me. We [in law
enforcement] don't get intimidated," Zine said.</TE>
<TE>   Amadi said the principle at stake is more important to the owner
than the damages.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a right to freedom of expression and equal protection
under the Constitution," said Amadi. "We are an unpopular business,
it is true. But we need protection from vigilantes."</TE>

<HD>3 Groups Sue Over Arrests of Arab Men</HD>
<DH>They seek an injunction to prevent widespread government
detentions of people showing up to register with the INS, as happened
last week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Rosenzweig</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three organizations representing Arab and Iranian immigrants sued the
government Tuesday, seeking curbs on a program that requires men and
boys, mostly from Middle Eastern countries, to register with
immigration authorities.</LD>
<LD>   A Justice Department spokesman said Tuesday that about 400 people
who showed up to register at Southern California Immigration and
Naturalization Service offices last week were detained because of
visa problems.</LD>
<LD>   Justice officials earlier had put the number at just over 200.
About 20 people remain in custody, the spokesman said, pending more
detailed security checks.</LD>
<TE>   The suit by the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, the
Alliance of Iranian Americans and the Council on American Islamic
Relations was filed in federal court in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   It seeks an injunction to prevent the government from carrying out
widespread detentions of people who come to Immigration and
Naturalization Service offices during the next set of registrations
set for Jan. 10. Several hundred men and boys were detained in Los
Angeles in the first round of registrations last week.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those detained have since been released, but the lawsuit
denounces the detentions that did take place as unlawful.</TE>
<TE>   The three groups are seeking a court order preventing the INS from
detaining anyone without first obtaining an arrest warrant. It also
seeks to bar the deportation of anyone who is qualified to legalize
his status, and to guarantee those persons bail hearings if they are
detained.</TE>
<TE>   "Although the special registration policy has been presented as a
national security measure designed to counter potential terrorist
threats, the INS has been using the registration process to not only
enforce immigration law but to arrest and deport people who have
complied with the law at every stage and are on the road to becoming
permanent residents," the three organizations said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's registration deadline applied to men in the United
States with temporary resident status who are natives of Iran, Iraq,
Libya, Sudan and Syria.</TE>
<TE>   INS officials have said the agency was not prepared to process the
large number of people who showed up, particularly in Southern
California, which has the nation's largest population of Iranian
immigrants.</TE>

<HD>Christmas Also Means Tamale Season in the Southland</HD>
<DH>For Celia Gomez of Santa Ana and other tamaleras, holidays
boost demand. Despite officials' concern, the home businesses thrive.</DH>

<LD>Before sunup on Tuesday, Celia Gomez's fingers were already cramped
as she kneaded pounds and pounds of masa.</LD>
<LD>   Then she packed cheese, green sauce, pineapples and even coconuts
into the dough and rolled the mix into corn husks. Gomez fired up the
stove top, put the creations in industrial-sized steamers and
monitored them for two hours.</LD>
<LD>   This is a daily routine during the holidays for the Southland's
hundreds, perhaps thousands of tamaleras -- part-time tamale makers
whose business soars during Christmas, with demand coming from both
Latino and non-Latino customers.</LD>
<TE>   While county health departments frown on the underground trade,
these home-based businesses thrive all the same.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez, who works in her Santa Ana kitchen, woke early every day in
the weeks before Christmas. She'll earn about $1,700 in two weeks
selling 2,000 tamales.</TE>
<TE>   "I like making them, and I like making my own money," said Gomez,
a 46-year-old mother of four. She sells tamales all year -- about 200
a week -- to 30 regular customers who are friends from church or from
her native Jalisco, Mexico. She has a few non-Latino customers too.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep coming back because they are just plain good," said
Guadalupe Chavez, 55. She bought four dozen tamales Tuesday, two
weeks after purchasing seven dozen for the Virgin of Guadalupe's
feast day.</TE>
<TE>   With Christmas, however, Gomez's business increases dramatically.
Tamales have become as much a staple in the Christmas meal as turkey.</TE>
<TE>   "Christmas is the one time that is recognizable for non-Mexicans
or Latinos who don't know tamales to get a taste," says Fresno poet
Gary Soto, author of "Too Many Tamales," a children's story.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez began selling tamales to make extra money.</TE>
<TE>   She wanted a job that would allow her to take care of her son, who
has Down's syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   Women like Gomez abound in Latino neighborhoods, even though their
sales are illegal. Under county regulations, food prepared in a
private home cannot be sold.</TE>
<TE>   But health officials say it's difficult to crack down on the
practice since vendors do not operate out of stores.</TE>
<TE>   In the Riverside County city of Romoland, a woman was cited last
week after a health inspector saw fliers advertising her tamales, the
Riverside Press-Enterprise reported. Wendy Taylor has a disabled
daughter and an injured husband who is not working, and thought this
was a way to earn money.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez is aware that her operation is illegal. But one of her New
Year's resolutions is to seek a permit from the city.</TE>

Tamales have become as much a staple in the Christmas meal as turkey.</TE>
<TE>   "Christmas is the one time that is recognizable for non-Mexicans
or Latinos who don't know tamales to get a taste," says Fresno poet
Gary Soto, author of "Too Many Tamales," a children's story. "This is
the season for it."</TE>
<TE>   For Mexicans and Mexican Americans, preparation is a big part of
the tradition, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when you can get all the chisme [gossip]," Soto said.</TE>
<TE>   The key to making good tamales, Gomez says, is to knead the dough
until the pain sets in.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what makes the dough spongy. If you don't put in the time,
you get a dry tamale. That's the worst," Gomez said.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez began selling tamales to make extra money. In her hometown
Ocotlan, she owned a beauty shop and sold clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "I like being a businesswoman. I like having my own money to buy
clothes or what I want," said Gomez, whose husband works in the
automotive industry. In the United States, tamale sales seemed a
natural.</TE>
<TE>   She made them frequently for parties and church fundraisers,
always drawing compliments. She wanted a job that would allow her to
take care of her son, who has Down's syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   Women like Gomez abound in Latino neighborhoods, even though their
sales are illegal. Under county regulations, food prepared in a
private home cannot be sold. But health officials say it's difficult
to crack down on the practice since vendors do not operate out of
stores.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Sutter, a spokesman for the Orange County Health Care
Agency, said the office takes action against people selling homemade
foods when it receives a complaint. "We don't have people roaming the
streets looking for folks," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There is an occasional bust. On Dec. 18, the agency received a
call from a tamale consumer complaining of cramps, diarrhea and
nausea. That led to an investigation of the Santa Ana vendor, who
voluntarily destroyed 15 pounds of tamales and two gallons of hot
chocolate.</TE>
<TE>   In the Riverside County city of Romoland, a woman was cited last
week after a health inspector saw fliers advertising her tamales, the
Riverside Press-Enterprise reported. Wendy Taylor has a disabled
daughter and an injured husband who is not working, and thought this
was a way to earn money.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez is aware that her operation is illegal. But one of her New
Year's resolution's is to seek a permit from the city. She would like
to expand her business.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, she's busy cooking holiday meals for her family.
But she will be having tostadas, a roast, potatoes and a salad for
Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't eat tamales anymore. And neither can anyone in my family.
We've eaten too many," she said.</TE>

<HD>Trucker Held in Threat on White House</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Glendale truck driver arrested in Ohio this week on suspicion of
threatening to blow up the White House could face up to 15 years in
prison, authorities said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Norayr Avetisyan, 27, was arrested in Dayton on Monday after he
was allegedly overheard telling a fellow trucker over a citizen's
band radio that he was carrying explosives and was headed to the
White House. Another trucker listening in on the conversation called
911.</LD>
<LD>   State police alerted officers in the surrounding area. A truck
weigh station was opened in Preble County, Ohio, near the state line
so Avetisyan would have to stop. Members of the FBI task force on
terrorism and U.S. Secret Service agents participated in the arrest.
No explosives were found and Avetisyan was turned over to U.S.
Marshalls on Tuesday, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Reached at his Glendale apartment, a woman who said she was
Avetisyan's sister said Tuesday that her brother's comments were not
serious.</TE>
<TE>   "He was in an argument with another person and that person wanted
to get back at him, so he called the police," said the woman, who
declined to give her name. "My brother is not like that at all. It's
all ridiculous."</TE>

<HD>Toys for Tots Mostly Rescued From Shortage</HD>
<DH>Appeal brought enough donations to close unexpected gap.
But no need to stop now.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Reyes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When organizers of Toys for Tots opened one of their storage
warehouses at the former El Toro Marine base, they expected to find
it half full. Instead, it was empty, and the unexpected shortage made
them fret that a lot of needy children would go without Christmas
presents, especially in Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   But an appeal to the public in recent days has helped fill the
gap, and the group has about 80% of the toys needed, said Scott
Mather, a toy organizer with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to a shortfall in donations, the number of toys needed
has increased from 215,000 a year ago to more than 300,000.</LD>
<TE>   Toys are still accepted at fire stations. After Christmas, the
toys are given to organizations that help children throughout the
year.</TE>
<TE>   "If a child goes into foster care, toys are often provided," said
Maria Sabol, a spokeswoman for the Anaheim Fire Department. "Don't
worry. Anything provided on Christmas Day will end up in the hands of
a child in need of a toy."</TE>
<TE>   The program involves several organizations, including the Marine
Corps, fire departments, Spark of Love and Operation Santa Claus.</TE>
<TE>   Eligible young recipients are screened through St. Vincent de
Paul. It provides a list to firefighters, who deliver the toys on
Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Toys of all shapes and sizes are needed, Mather said. Of the items
collected, he has seen classic toys such as Barbie, Tonka trucks and
remote-controlled cars. Other examples include basketballs and board
games.</TE>
<TE>   "We ask the public to try and bring a toy with a $10 value,"
Mather said. "And don't worry if you bring a gift [today]. They won't
go to waste, believe me. We do this every year and we can reserve
them for next year."</TE>

<HD>Tree-Sitter to End His Lofty Protest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Wendy Thermos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tree-sitter John Quigley, whose crusade to save an old oak near Santa
Clarita has made him an environmental celebrity, said Tuesday that he
will leave his perch in January to return to his teaching job but
vowed that "others are waiting to take my place."</LD>
<LD>   Quigley, 42, of Pacific Palisades has been sitting in the branches
of the towering oak along Pico Canyon Road since Nov. 1, with only an
occasional break.</LD>
<LD>   The veteran tree activist was recruited by Santa Clarita
environmentalists to try to protect the oak from a road-widening
project.</LD>
<TE>   But Quigley, who has battled rainstorms, winds and freezing
temperatures during his two-month campaign, said he plans to descend
from his perch soon to return to his teaching job with the Malibu
Foundation for Environmental Education.</TE>
<TE>   He did not give an exact date when he would step down.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley said he had hoped that a tree preservation plan would be
worked out by Christmas, but that local environmentalists remain
committed to the cause.</TE>
<TE>   He said they already have plans to replace him when he leaves, and
the campaign will go on.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of their strategy was to try to wait me out, but they can't
do that if we have a crew of people" willing to sit in the tree,
Quigley said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're preparing to go for the long haul. I've had calls from all
over the U.S. from people wanting to be in the tree."</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Plambeck, president of the Santa Clarita Organization for
Planning and the Environment, said she is not worried about Quigley's
departure. "If John needs to leave, there are a whole bunch of people
who want to go up and sit in that tree."</TE>
<TE>   In a campaign that has drawn national attention, Quigley and his
supporters have managed to rally Santa Clarita suburbanites and even
actress Rene Russo to their cause.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, they presented Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike
Antonovich, whose district includes the northwest region, with 4,000
signatures of people who would like to see the tree remain where it
is.</TE>
<TE>   But activists have been less successful in coming up with an
acceptable solution to the tree dilemma.</TE>
<TE>   John Laing Homes, the developer of a nearby subdivision, is
required to move the old oak as a condition of its building permit.</TE>
<TE>   Antonovich's office has maintained that moving the tree and
replanting it at a nearby park remains the best solution. The move
would cost more than $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   But Quigley and his supporters believe moving the tree will kill
it.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the company that initially agreed to do the job
backed away last week, citing the "circus atmosphere and bad
publicity" that had sprung up around the plan.</TE>
<TE>   A Valencia-based engineer, sympathetic to the activists, recently
stepped forward with a proposal to split the widened Pico Canyon
Road, so that it would swing around the tree, leaving a narrow pocket
in the middle for the oak.</TE>
<TE>   But that plan also has been nixed. Tony Bell, a spokesman for
Antonovich, said Friday that county public works engineers have
rejected the proposals as unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   He said the county engineers concluded that a curved roadway did
not meet county standards for speed and visibility.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley disagreed with the finding, saying that the activists'
engineer had used the county's own statistics and surveyor
measurements.</TE>
<TE>   "We're sorry to learn of this lump of coal being given to the
people of Los Angeles," Quigley said. "They seem to be saying, 'Let's
just bulldoze our way through any opposition.' "</TE>

<HD>Officials Join Fight for Center</HD>
<DH>Parents fear the closure of Oxnard Boys &amp; Girls Club for
renovation will become permanent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandra Murillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a last-ditch effort to save their neighborhood Boys &amp; Girls Club,
a handful of Oxnard parents and two local officials met Tuesday to
discuss how they could persuade board members not to close the
facility Jan. 3.</LD>
<LD>   County Supervisor John K. Flynn promised to back the parents in
their pleas to the Boys &amp; Girls Club board of directors. "We'll do
everything we can to help keep this place open," Flynn told parents
Tuesday at a meeting at his office in south Oxnard. "If the club is
in need of repairs it's one thing, but to close it down entirely is
another."</LD>
<LD>   Flynn, who said the parents had asked to meet with him, hopes to
meet with the board of directors and Oxnard city officials early next
week.</LD>
<TE>   Oxnard Planning Commissioner Morey Navarro, who also is supporting
the parents in their efforts, said several local attorneys have come
forward to offer their assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "If we let it close, it will be so much harder to ever get it
reopened," parent Keith Bakker said.</TE>
<TE>   Parents and children have been upset since club officials
announced last week that the staff at the 7th Street facility would
be terminated while the building was being renovated. Staffers
include Ruben Herrera, 53, who's coached there for 33 years.</TE>
<TE>   Herrera's brother was at the meeting Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the employees are welcome to reapply for their jobs
when the club reopens late next year. They say the building's age,
many leaks and old restrooms make it unsafe. They will conduct a
study to determine the improvements needed.</TE>
<TE>   But parents say the restrooms and leaks have always been a problem
and that they don't understand why club officials are acting as if
there is suddenly a health and safety emergency.</TE>
<TE>   "In a nutshell, there was no reason to dismiss those people," said
Navarro. "It just doesn't make any sense."</TE>
<TE>   They note that the building has never been cited for health-code
violations and don't see why it must close during a feasibility study
or renovations. In any case, they doubt club officials can raise the
estimated $1 million they might need to renovate the building by late
next year and suspect that the club will remain closed indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears as if there's some bigger plan that doesn't involve
the Boys &amp; Girls Club at all," said parent Claudio Sandoval.</TE>
<TE>   Boys &amp; Girls Club officials were not available for comment
Tuesday, but have said they want to begin making improvements to the
club. Other than saying that it was a difficult decision, they have
not commented on the staff's dismissal.</TE>

<HD>By Their Suits You Shall Know Them</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On New Year's Day, Tony Jacoy watches the Rose Parade on television,
looking for the color.</LD>
<LD>   He's not interested in flowers, but in the clothes of the
organizers. The suits vary from cream to off-white to -- there it is!
-- that glorious, pure-as-snow white that makes him stand up and say:</LD>
<LD>   "That's one of mine!"</LD>
<TE>   All 935 Tournament of Roses volunteers wear a white suit Jan. 1.
It is their uniform, a long-standing tradition of the country's
most-watched parade and a challenging niche business for Jacoy's San
Marino menswear store.</TE>
<TE>   America's other major market for white suits (sorry, you cruise
directors and "Saturday Night Fever" fetishists don't quite provide
the volume) is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. All
members dress in white when they enter a temple. There, the matching
white suits represent purity, unity and the equality of all members.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Parade uses the white suits for strikingly similar
reasons. The white suit is, in fact, a rare populist flourish for a
rigidly hierarchical organization that can wear its elitism on its
sleeve.</TE>
<TE>   The Tournament of Roses adopted the white suit as its uniform in
1932 as a blow to Eastern tradition, which dictated that white never
be worn after Labor Day or before Easter, according to a history
compiled for the parade's centennial.</TE>
<TE>   The distinctive color made Tournament of Roses volunteers readily
identifiable to parade-goers and Rose Bowl fans who needed
directions. It also reinforced a message: that Tournament volunteers
should be in the background. If you want color, keep your eyes on the
floats.</TE>
<TE>   The suits have been preserved, parade officials say, out of a
sense of history and a desire to make all members feel important. In
the 2003 parade, Tournament President Gary Thomas, the one volunteer
who wears a red coat instead of white, will break with tradition and
don a white suit as he rides down Colorado Boulevard with his family.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make a statement that we value all our volunteers,"
Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   For Tournament members, buying a white suit often takes them to
one of two family-owned Southern California clothiers, who can go as
far as Georgia and New York in their search for a fabric white enough
for the parade. (A few parade volunteers, in a pinch, have bought
suits at shops affiliated with the Mormon church.) Fifty suits is a
big sales year, and there is little profit and plenty of aggravation
in the endeavor.</TE>
<TE>   "They are hard to get. A lot of manufacturers don't want to make
them," said Peter Kaplan, whose family has owned Academy Award
Clothes in downtown Los Angeles for 53 years. "In a factory, you have
pieces of thread, other things flying around in the air. It's easy to
damage white. You have to keep a factory perfectly clean."</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan's store and Jacoy's P.M. Jacoy are competitive.</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan says he is larger than Jacoy and can keep more in stock.
Jacoy says that his white suits are better-made, with more lining.
Each has sought, unsuccessfully, the Holy Grail of the white suit
biz, a pure white wool that could be used for suits.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to every mill I could. There's no such animal," Jacoy
said.</TE>
<TE>   Frosty Foster, a retired Tournament staffer, encouraged Jacoy to
provide the white suits after C&amp;R Clothiers declared bankruptcy more
than a decade ago. The supplier before that, a Colorado Boulevard
clothing store owned by a Tournament president, went out of business.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a tailor and a seamstress who ran a business in
Highland Park, Jacoy studied political science at UCLA and worked in
the defense industry before beginning to sell high-end suits out of
the back of his car. In 1985, he opened his own store on Mission
Street.</TE>
<TE>   When the Tournament called, he began his search for a pure white
fabric. He looked first for wool but couldn't find it. Cotton suits
wrinkle too easily, and linen suits are a little bit creamy, not the
pure white desired by parade volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   After more than a month, he found a New York supplier who offered
him snow white polyester gabardine material on the condition that he
buy it in 100-yard rolls, enough for 25 suits. The supplier wanted
assurance that he was serious about buying such an unusual color.</TE>
<TE>   He arranged to have the rolls stocked, and the suits were made for
a time in the City of Commerce. In recent years, the New York
material has been turned into suits by a company in Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Jacoy stocks the suits in men's sizes ranging from 36 short to 60
extra long, and women's sizes from "0 to I'd rather not say." He
encourages members to order several weeks ahead of time. His trusted
tailor, Viem Hoang, spends his holidays making last-minute
alterations, often taking work home to get it done by Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been some improvements in white suits over the years,"
said Mike Riffey, a Jacoy customer who will be Tournament president
in 2004. "The suits today come with linings in the pants, with more
thickness, so you don't feel nearly as cold at night as we once did."</TE>
<TE>   One of Jacoy's unofficial duties is to help members comply with
the Tournament rules on white suits, which fill an eight-page
booklet. The suit must be worn with white bucks, white dress shirt,
white belt and a red tie. There are dozens of "don'ts." Don't use
boots or tennis shoes. Don't wear dark suspenders. Throw out older,
yellowing suits.</TE>
<TE>   Even when people ask, Jacoy refuses to make double-breasted suits
because the Tournament frowns on it.</TE>
<TE>   "Cuffs are OK, but that's about it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Jacoy raised the price of the suit from $265 to $285.
He doesn't make much money on them, he said, but likes the business
"because of the flood of people who come in the door."</TE>
<TE>   "I've made a lot of good clients through the Tournament," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, some volunteers wait until the last minute to pick
suits up. If they miss the shop's operating hours, Jacoy has been
known to leave the suits to be picked up from the gas station
attendant across the street.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, knowing his clientele, customers will ask him for
parade gossip. "But my information isn't that good," he said. "I'm
the tailor, not the barber."</TE>

<LD>Nearly a month after a car accident in West Hollywood left her
seriously injured, the Old Hollywood fixture Zsa Zsa Gabor is rapidly
recovering and will celebrate Christmas today with her husband,
complete with a special dinner and her many pet dogs, at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   Gabor is in fair condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. Her
husband, the German prince and duke Frederic von Anhalt, said Gabor
has been in good spirits since starting physical therapy, and might
return to their Bel-Air home within 10 days.</LD>
<LD>   "I must say she is recovering very quickly," he said. "At the
beginning she was very moody; she wanted to give up. Now she wants to
go home fast. She wants to recover and to ride her horses."</LD>
<TE>   Gabor, 85, was in the passenger seat of a car that jumped a curb
at Sunset Boulevard and Sweetzer Avenue and slammed into a light pole
the afternoon of Nov. 28. The actress, who was not wearing a safety
belt at the time, suffered broken bones and cuts. A sheriff's traffic
deputy said Tuesday that the accident is still under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Von Anhalt said he has decorated Gabor's room for the holidays.
"We're going to celebrate and have a nice Christmas dinner ... with
Christmas cookies," he said.</TE>

<HD>Charges Filed Against Man in Family Slaying Case</HD>
<DH>Missing Portland, Ore., resident is suspected of killing
his pregnant wife and three children. Border authorities are told to
be on lookout.</DH>

<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Murder charges have been filed against a missing Portland man whose
pregnant wife and three young children were found slain in the snowy
woods.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities continued to search Tuesday for Edward Morris, who is
suspected of killing his family in rural Tillamook County on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The arrest warrant was issued late Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said they consider Morris, 37, to be armed and
dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, the FBI filed a federal arrest warrant that charges
Morris with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. Such warrants are
issued when officials believe a suspect has crossed state lines or
international borders to avoid authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Officers kept watch on his Portland home in case Morris tried to
return, and border authorities in Canada and Mexico were asked to
watch for him.</TE>
<TE>   The bodies of 31-year-old Renee Morris, 10-year-old Bryant,
8-year-old Alexis and 4-year-old Jonathan were found Saturday in
Tillamook State Forest.</TE>
<TE>   Autopsies completed Monday showed the victims died of "homicidal
violence," Tillamook County Sheriff Todd Anderson said. He would not
elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Aggravated murder can be punishable by death, but prosecutors did
not say whether they would seek the death penalty. Investigators have
not disclosed a motive in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Before the charges were issued late Monday, authorities stressed
that Morris could also have been a victim.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives and neighbors described the Morrises as devoutly
religious and dedicated to their children.</TE>
<TE>   But they said Edward Morris had trouble holding a job and started
several roofing and landscaping businesses over the last years.</TE>
<TE>   The Morrises filed for bankruptcy in 1993 for one of those
businesses, according to court records.</TE>

<LD>A U.S. district court judge has upheld the Environmental Protection
Agency's cleanup efforts in the asbestos-tainted town of Libby but
said a trial is needed to determine how much of the $55.6-million
bill W.R. Grace &amp; Co. must pay.</LD>
<LD>   The decision rejected claims by the company, which operated a
vermiculite mine linked to contamination blamed for illness and
deaths in the community in northwestern Montana.</LD>

<HD>Bush Takes Time to Salute the Military for Sacrifices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edwin Chen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush took a short break from a family holiday gathering
Tuesday to call nine members of the U.S. military around the world to
thank them for their service "in defense of freedom."</LD>
<LD>   On Christmas Eve, Bush and his family attended a candlelight
service in the chapel at Camp David, the presidential retreat in
Maryland's Catoctin Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   The president has been at Camp David since Saturday. He is
scheduled to depart Thursday for his ranch near Crawford, Texas,
where he plans to stay until early January.</LD>
<TE>   White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said Bush began his day with
an indoor workout and then made the calls.</TE>
<TE>   "The president called them to thank them for their sacrifices and
to let them know the thoughts and prayers of the American people are
with them -- to express his appreciation and that of the American
people for the sacrifices they are making in the defense of freedom,"
Stanzel said.</TE>
<TE>   The recipients of the presidential phone calls represented all
branches of the services and were stationed at posts in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Afghanistan and South Korea, as well as aboard
vessels at sea, Stanzel said.</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with family tradition, the Bushes planned to have a
Christmas Eve dinner of tamales and enchiladas, a taste acquired
during their years in Midland, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Their Christmas Day menu is beef tenderloin, potatoes Anna and
creamed spinach.</TE>
<TE>   Joining the president and First Lady Laura Bush at Camp David were
their twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna; his parents, former
President Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush; his sister,
Dorothy Koch, and her family; his brothers Neil and Marvin and their
families; and Laura Bush's mother, Jenna Welch.</TE>
<TE>   The first lady recently confessed that a number of Bush family
traditions have fallen by the wayside now that they live in the White
House and their daughters are grown.</TE>
<TE>   Their Christmas trees are trimmed by others, and the hot chocolate
that used to follow that tradition has been reset for Christmas
morning to accompany the opening of presents.</TE>
<TE>   Another change is that the girls no longer wake up their parents
on Christmas morning.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Mrs. Bush said, "we make the hot chocolate and wake them up.
By that time, the president and I have already eaten our cereal."</TE>

<LD>   The Treasury Department said the government could hit the current
debt limit in late February, because of the slow economy and
increased spending after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The request, which came in a letter to key members on the
traditionally low-key day before Christmas, could become politically
charged when Congress resumes next year. Ultimately, however,
lawmakers likely will approve it.</LD>
<TE>   Even so, many Republicans pride themselves on fiscal conservatism
and do not like being asked to vote to raise the debt ceiling. And
House Democrats were nearly unanimous in voting against a boost last
summer, saying President Bush should first reconsider parts of his
tax-cutting plan. That increase was approved nonetheless, raising the
borrowing limit by $450 billion, to the current $6.4 trillion.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure they would have preferred to do this at midnight on
Christmas," said Henry Aaron, an economist at the nonpartisan
Brookings Institution here, referring to the administration's
request.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter to lawmakers, Deputy Treasury Secretary Kenneth Dam
wrote that "the ongoing response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist
attack and the economic slowdown" were behind the need to raise the
debt ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   The government is spending more on defense and security, while the
economic slowdown -- along with a fall in stock values -- has meant
lower tax receipts.</TE>
<TE>   "This action is necessary to ensure success in our efforts to
combat terrorism, continue the economic recovery and create jobs, and
maintain the soundness of federal government securities," Dam wrote.</TE>
<TE>   He did not request a specific figure for the new limit. A Treasury
Department spokeswoman said that would be worked out with Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Several economists said there was little that Bush could have done
to avoid asking for a higher debt ceiling, because the economic
turndown is largely beyond his control.</TE>
<TE>   But they also said the request shows why, in their opinion, the
Bush administration has been wrong to pursue long-term tax cuts,
which they say will only add to the debt.</TE>
<TE>   "It's embarrassing," Aaron said. "It underscores the total
budgetary debacle that has occurred under President Bush's watch.</TE>
<TE>   "We have moved from projected multitrillion-dollar budget
surpluses over 10 years to ... multitrillion-dollar deficits."</TE>
<TE>   Harry Zeeve, national field director for the Arlington, Va.-based
Concord Coalition, an anti-deficit group, said the request for a
higher debt limit "was yet another symptom of a disease: the loss of
budget discipline."</TE>
<TE>   He said Congress should postpone tax cuts until the economic
outlook improves, and that any prescription drug benefit for senior
citizens should be tied to cost savings in the Medicare program.</TE>
<TE>   The federal budget fell from a surplus of $237 billion in 2000 and
$127 billion in 2001 to a deficit of $157 billion in the fiscal year
that ended in September. The Congressional Budget Office foresees
deficits at least until 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Some say deficits will continue beyond that, however. The budget
office projections are based on tax laws as they are currently
written, and many economists believe those laws will change.</TE>
<TE>   The president, for example, is expected to push for new tax cuts.
He also wants to make permanent the $1.35 trillion in tax cuts that
Congress approved last year. Under current law, those tax cuts will
expire after 2010.</TE>
<TE>   If the debt limit is not raised, the Treasury Department has
several mechanisms available to stave off default on government
bonds. The department already used some of those tools this year,
such as borrowing from government retirement funds.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats in Congress said the request for more borrowing
authority showed that Bush was mismanaging the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "This administration is in a state of deep economic denial," said
Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, criticizing tax
cuts approved last year.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to get serious and get a new economic plan now."</TE>

<HD>Australia Gives Florida Man Asylum</HD>
<DH>Hit with a contempt charge, ex-lawmaker fled in 1993. He
said he faced persecution here.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>A former state lawmaker and Miami-Dade County commissioner was
granted refugee status in Australia, ending the possibility of
deportation to face a civil contempt charge in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Joe Gersten, 53, fled to Australia in 1993 after losing a
reelection campaign amid a sex and drug scandal. He had sought
refugee status ever since, and several Australian courts had rejected
him.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel as though a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders,"
Gersten told the Sun Herald of Sydney, Australia. "I can get up in
the mornings now without having a gut-wrenching feeling in my stomach
about when they're going to deport me."</LD>
<TE>   The Australian immigration minister who granted the visa, Philip
Ruddock, could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Gersten, a Democrat, served in the Florida House of
Representatives during the 1970s and in the state Senate in the 1980s
before winning a county commission seat.</TE>
<TE>   He lost a 1992 reelection bid after he filed a disputed police
report, claiming his car was stolen from outside his home. Drug
addicts and prostitutes told officers the car was stolen from outside
a crack house.</TE>
<TE>   A judge held Gersten in contempt for refusing to testify about the
theft, and he fled the country.</TE>
<TE>   Gersten has claimed he would suffer persecution if deported
because he had accused onetime political enemies -- including former
Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, then the state attorney for Miami-Dade County
-- of corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Griffith, a spokesman for the current Miami-Dade County state
attorney, Katherine Fernandez Rundle, said Gersten's predictions of
persecution were unfounded.</TE>

<HD>GAO Report Details Homeland Security Efforts</HD>
<DH>Agencies have made big gains to guard against terrorist
attacks, such as a greater emphasis on sharing information, federal
auditors say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Since last year's terrorist attacks, federal agencies have taken big
steps to prevent similar assaults and to respond if they should
occur. But more needs to be done, particularly to help state and
local authorities, a report by congressional auditors said.</LD>
<LD>   The report released Tuesday by the General Accounting Office
recommended that the new Department of Homeland Security assess the
nation's greatest risks and vulnerabilities to determine what its
priorities should be.</LD>
<LD>   The GAO examination of what federal agencies have done to
strengthen homeland security was requested by Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.), chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee. The review included agencies that will be part of the new
homeland security agency, such as the Coast Guard, and others that
will have important roles from outside the department, such as the
FBI.</LD>
<TE>   White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said the administration is
"pleased with the progress that has been made in protecting the
homeland."</TE>
<TE>   "We know there is much more work to be done, and we are hopeful
that Congress will act quickly on the president's request to double
funding for homeland security."</TE>
<TE>   The GAO cited signs that agencies have been boosting homeland
security efforts. The Energy Department has strengthened security at
nuclear weapon complexes; the Defense Department created a Northern
Command to defend U.S. territory; the FBI added more than 500 agents
to counter terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Federal agencies have placed a greater emphasis on sharing
information, the GAO said. A recent congressional investigation into
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks found that intelligence agencies were
not providing information about terrorism suspects to outside
agencies such as the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</TE>
<TE>   Some agencies have not been included in homeland defense plans
that should have been, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the General Services Administration, which oversees
federal office buildings, was not contacted by the Homeland Security
Office about protecting facilities along the border, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The new department will begin operations next year. It will draw
from 22 current agencies and have 170,000 employees.</TE>

<HD>Homeless Say Thanks With a $3,000 Gift</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A police officer got a Christmas gift of $3,000 from homeless people
who wanted to thank him for standing up for them.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Eduardo Delacruz was suspended for 30 days without pay
last month after he refused a sergeant's order to arrest a homeless
man found sleeping in a garage.</LD>
<LD>   In gratitude, organizations for the homeless put together the fund
for the 37-year-old officer, his wife and their five children.
Homeless people also contributed change scrounged from passersby,
money earned from recycling cans and bottles, even a portion of their
welfare checks.</LD>
<TE>   "We just wanted to thank him by contributing however we could,"
said Joe Bostic, one of 30 former and current homeless men and women
who announced the gift. "And a lot of us gave quarters, nickels and
dimes."</TE>
<TE>   According to police, Delacruz told his superiors in the
department's Homeless Outreach Unit that he would not arrest a
homeless man Nov. 22 because the man had nowhere else to go. The
officer was suspended for refusing to comply with an order.</TE>
<TE>   Delacruz's attorney, Norman Siegel, said the officer was back on
the job Tuesday and was "very moved" by the response.</TE>
<TE>   The officer and his family "specifically asked me to say, 'God
bless everyone, especially the homeless,' " Siegel said.</TE>

<HD>Only Preacher Around Makes Usual Rounds</HD>
<DH>He travels by boat, golf cart to the 3 Methodist churches
on an island with a vanishing future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lyndsey Layton</AU>
<BD>The Washington Post</BD>
<DL>SMITH ISLAND, Md.</DL>
<LD>The Rev. Rick Edmund delivered his Christmas message to the
congregants, pushed open the heavy door of the wooden church and
headed outside into the salty breeze. He shook a few hands but
couldn't linger. One down; two to go.</LD>
<LD>   Smith Island, a speck in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay, has
three Methodist churches but one preacher. Following a long tradition
of Methodist circuit ministers, Edmund travels from church to church
to church, riding a boat and a golf cart to reach the remote
congregations.</LD>
<LD>   This week he urged the men and women, most of them over 50 with
skin leathered by sun and wind, to follow Mary's example and have
faith in God even in difficult circumstances. It's a message that
resonates in winter, when the crabbing that pays the bills is
suspended and islanders bide their time until the work boats shove
off again in spring.</LD>
<TE>   But it has even greater meaning at this moment on this island,
which is really just a dozen square miles of spongy marsh
criss-crossed by channels and creeks. Smith Island is dying.</TE>
<TE>   "There not any children being born and the old people's dying
off," said Lester Tyler, 72, who still works on the water, scraping
for soft-shell crabs.</TE>
<TE>   At its height before World War I, island population peaked at 850.
By the 2000 Census, that number slipped to 364. Overfishing, disease
and government regulation have dimmed the crabbing and oyster
industry, while erosion and rising sea levels are eating away at the
island and turning firm ground to marsh.</TE>
<TE>   Most young residents leave for jobs at the prison or the hospital
or schools on the mainland of Maryland's Eastern Shore. Even older
islanders are moving away. The last remaining school has 31 students.</TE>
<TE>   The pews grow emptier with each year, but the churches continue to
function in the island's three villages -- Ewell, Rhodes Point and
Tylerton. Since the island's founding by English farmers in 1657, the
Methodist Church has been the focal point of community life.</TE>
<TE>   With no local government, no movie theaters and little retail
beyond some small groceries, the churches fill the void -- even
paying the electric bills for the few street lights on the island.
Disputes are resolved at meetings in the church basements. Pastor
Rick, as the islanders call Edmund, is the de facto mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pretty awesome responsibility," said Edmund, who likes to
drive his white golf cart with the "Smile: Jesus Loves You" bumper
sticker to a point on the flat island. From there, he can see the
lights of all three villages when the sun sets. "I feel blessed to be
here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly everyone on the island is Methodist, having descended from
three original families: Tyler, Evans and Bradshaw. Many islanders
share a certain resemblance -- green or blue eyes, brown hair, small
features set in round faces. They know each other's business and
lives: who fell down and hurt a leg, who's having trouble making
payments on a boat, whose daughter is moving off the island.</TE>
<TE>   Although satellite dishes and the Internet have helped connect
Smith Island to the rest of the world, the island is so remote --
reached by a 45-minute boat ride across the choppy Tangier Sound from
the mainland -- that natives maintain a distinct dialect that mixes a
Southern drawl with a British cockney accent. The word "brown" for
instance, sounds like "brine."</TE>
<TE>   Every Sunday, Edmund presides over the service at Ewell, then
either rides in a scow provided by the church or hitches a ride in a
work boat for the next service in Tylerton, before climbing back in
the boat and riding to Rhodes Point for the final service. He gives
the same sermon three times.</TE>
<TE>   He rubs his hands with sanitizing lotion on each leg of his
circuit. "With all the handshaking, it helps to keep me from getting
sick," said Edmund, 54, who lives in the gray parsonage next to the
church in Ewell, the biggest village.</TE>
<TE>   During the week, he'll drive his golf cart or 1974 Volkswagen bug
to events at the Rhodes Point church and take his 14-foot scow, the
Methodist, to church events in Tylerton.</TE>
<TE>   The three churches have always shared a minister, said Jennings
Evans, 72, a retired waterman who acts as the local historian.
Merging them has never been discussed, partly because Tylerton is
reachable only by boat and it would be difficult for elderly
residents to clamber in and out of boats every time they go to
church.</TE>
<TE>   And they go to church a lot -- not just on Sunday mornings but for
prayer meetings during the week and Saturday night dinners in winter
cooked by the men that feature Smith Island cake, a 12-layer
confection baked by the women.</TE>
<TE>   But beyond logistics, each village wants its own church as
physical evidence of community.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people give to the church whether they go or not," Evans
said. "The smallest congregation is in Rhodes Point, connected by two
miles of paved road and bridge to the largest town, Ewell.</TE>
<TE>   Of the three villages, Rhodes Point is the most depressed. In the
last few years, it lost its restaurant, all its stores and its post
office. Empty houses decay along its only road, which runs parallel
to its channel. One out of five island residents lives below the
poverty line. No one holds a graduate or professional degree; just 7%
graduated from college.</TE>
<TE>   On the Sunday before Christmas, 12 people, mostly elderly women,
were praying inside the church in Rhodes Point. The pulpit, organ and
front of the church were flooded with red poinsettias donated by
church members honoring loved ones who have passed away.</TE>
<TE>   It would be logical to merge the Rhodes Point church with the
Ewell church, because they're so close together and connected by a
paved road. But the congregants at the smaller church cling to it
like a lifeboat in the bay.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our community and the people who built this church, they
mean a lot to us," said Marlene Marsh, a 60-year-old widow who lives
in a trailer a few doors down from the church. The church survives by
throwing a homecoming celebration in the fall, where it collects
thousands of dollars from people who once lived in Rhodes Point.</TE>
<TE>   For those who stay on Smith Island, faith is essential, said
Ronnie Corbin, 45, the ruddy-faced son and grandson of watermen who
dropped out of school after eighth grade to work on the water.
"Everybody has faith in God, that he'll provide crabs and oysters
that we depend on so much. That's what's really holding Smith Island
together now. The faith."</TE>

<HD>Maine Drug Discount Program Illegal, Court Rules</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Maine</DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court Tuesday struck down a Maine state program
that provides prescription drug discounts to more than 110,000 low-
and moderate-income residents.</LD>
<LD>   The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the
Healthy Maine Prescriptions program, like a similar measure struck
down in Vermont, illegally expanded the Medicaid program.</LD>
<LD>   The program, which began in June 2001, forces drug makers to
provide prescriptions at Medicaid prices to Maine residents who earn
up to three times the federal poverty level.</LD>
<TE>   The drug industry had challenged the program.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling "is a victory for Medicaid patients in Maine and
everywhere because their access to needed medicines won't be limited
by bureaucrats putting budget needs over patient care," said Bruce
Lott of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.</TE>
<TE>   About 111,000 people are enrolled in the program, and 225,000 are
eligible. Members receive discounts of about 25% on name-brand
medications, and more for generic drugs. The program saves
participants an estimated $12 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court labeled the program illegal because its costs
are borne entirely by drug makers and not the federal or state
government.</TE>
<TE>   After the Vermont program was struck down, Maine had agreed to pay
about 2% of the drug costs. But the court said the late change was
not specifically approved by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary
Tommy G. Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Concannon, state human services commissioner, said Thompson
has supported the Maine program and will probably approve it in its
revised form.</TE>
<TE>   The Healthy Maine program is separate from the Maine Rx program,
which seeks to lower prescription drug costs for about 325,000
residents by threatening price controls. Maine Rx is on hold while it
is being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>

<HD>Welcome to Barbie's Dollhouse Revoked</HD>
<DH>Her old friend Midge is pregnant, and some parents say it
sends the wrong message to kids.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>She's Barbie's oldest friend, happily married and visibly pregnant --
which, some parents complain, makes her unfit as a children's toy.</LD>
<LD>   The pregnant version of Midge, which pops out a curled-up baby
when her belly, attached by a magnet, is opened -- has been pulled
from Wal-Mart shelves across the country after customer complaints, a
Wal-Mart spokeswoman said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "It was just that customers had a concern about having a pregnant
doll," Wal-Mart spokeswoman Cynthia Illick said.</LD>
<TE>   Illick said the retailer would no longer sell the Happy Family
set, which included pregnant Midge, her husband and their 3-year-old
son.</TE>
<TE>   Illick said the decision was made in the last couple of weeks.
"What we try to do is listen to what our customers want," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Messages seeking comment left for representatives of Mattel Inc.,
the toy's maker, were not returned Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Midge was introduced in 1963, the first of a slew of friends and
family members for Barbie, who appeared four years earlier and has
been one of the world's top-selling dolls ever since.</TE>
<TE>   The pregnant Midge wears a wedding ring and comes with doll-size
crib, cradle, changing table, baby toys and a baby monitor. The
husband and son are sold separately.</TE>
<TE>   Mattel posted an article on its Barbie Web site by USC psychology
professor Jo Ann Farver praising the doll as a "wonderful prop,"
particularly for families expecting a new sibling.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Bill Boehmer of the KB Toys store in Philadelphia's
Roosevelt Mall said he had heard only positive responses from
customers.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had people laugh, but I haven't had anyone say this was
ridiculous or, 'What are we trying to tell these kids?' or anything
like that," Boehmer said.</TE>
<TE>   But at another KB Toys in downtown Philadelphia, customer reaction
Tuesday was uniformly negative.</TE>
<TE>   "It promotes teenage pregnancy. What would an 8-year-old or
12-year-old get out of that doll baby?" asked Sabrina Fagan, 29, who
has a 9-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   "Most girls want to be like Barbie" or her friends, said Kenya
Williams, 29, who has two daughters, ages 9 and 7. "Maybe if they
would have put them all together as a family, it might be a little
different, but alone it sends out the wrong message."</TE>

<HD>3 Admit Guilt in Moon Rock Theft Plot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Three student employees at the Johnson Space Center in Houston have
pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to steal moon rocks collected
by Apollo astronauts.</LD>
<LD>   Tiffany Fowler, Thad Roberts and Shae Saur pleaded guilty in
federal court in Orlando last week to conspiracy to commit theft and
interstate transportation of stolen property.</LD>
<LD>   Undercover FBI agents arrested Roberts, 25, Fowler, 22, and a
fourth defendant, Gordon McWhorter, 26, in Orlando in July. Saur, 19,
was arrested in Houston the same day. The student workers were fired
after the arrests.</LD>
<TE>   McWhorter, a college friend of Roberts, is scheduled for trial in
February.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators say the group placed an ad in May on the Web site of
the Mineralogy Club of Antwerp, Belgium, offering to sell "priceless
moon rocks" collected by Apollo astronauts in 1969 and the early
1970s for $1,000 to $5,000 a gram.</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, a safe containing moon rocks from every Apollo
mission was discovered missing from the center. Officials said the
inventory offered by the suspects came from the safe.</TE>

<HD>Pardons Help 3 Men Get Right With the World</HD>
<DH>They long ago paid their debts to society for minor
offenses, but legal obstacles remained. Then the president answered
their pleas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ken Ellingwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Be it known that the list of who's naughty no longer includes one
Kenneth F. Copley, who many years ago tried raising pocket money by
cooking bootleg whiskey in the Tennessee woods.</LD>
<LD>   Also forgiven is Olgen Williams, a former postal clerk in
Indianapolis who filched $10.90 from the mail in the 1970s to support
a heroin habit. Cleared too is Harlan Dobas, who 40 years ago scooped
excess grain from the Portland, Ore., docks where he worked and sold
it without paying taxes.</LD>
<LD>   "I did wrong," Dobas said Tuesday. "It's a bad thing. It's
followed me all my life."</LD>
<TE>   All three men long ago paid their debts to society for misdeeds
that, in retrospect, seem almost quaint. Yet there are times when a
man can settle his account, hew to the straight and narrow and still
not be 100% right with the world.</TE>
<TE>   Copley made such a discovery when he was turned down for a handgun
license in Lyles, Tenn., four years ago. The reason: He was a felon.
Dobas was told he had risen as far as he was going to in the Oregon
state militia until he got his old offense scrubbed for good.
Williams, who left the drugs far in his past and now is a respected
community leader and close friend of the Indianapolis police chief,
sought one final step in his redemption.</TE>
<TE>   In all three cases, there was but one place to turn: the president
of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   And on Monday, the White House answered their pleas, announcing
that seven people nationwide -- including Copley, Dobas and Williams
-- had been granted pardons by President Bush, the first of his
administration. With a swipe of his pen, the president made clean the
criminal records of a group of ordinary people who for the most part
now look back on their transgressions as spasms of youthful
foolishness.</TE>
<TE>   "What all these cases have in common is that each pardon recipient
committed a relatively minor offense many years ago, completed his
prison sentence or probation and paid any fine, and has gone on to
live an exemplary life and to be a positive force in his community,"
said a White House spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Among those pardoned was a Mississippi man who got three years'
probation and paid a $500 fine in 1993 for altering an odometer. (He
declined comment.) Another recipient -- an Iowa resident fined
$15,000 in 1989 for making a false statement to the Social Security
Administration about his employment -- called the pardon a "nice
Christmas present."</TE>
<TE>   The pardons served needs that were practical and deeply personal.</TE>
<TE>   "God has forgiven me. My family loves me. My community supports
me. I felt it was something I wanted personally," said Williams, 54,
who spent six months in federal prison after his 1972 theft
conviction and now runs a community services center in a
working-class section of Indianapolis. "I wanted the whole gamut --
from God's forgiveness all the way to the people who incarcerated
me."</TE>
<TE>   Williams helps ex-convicts find jobs and tries to steer teens
clear of trouble. His unhappy brush with the law came after he
returned from the Vietnam War, "disillusioned, full of hatred." He
clambered up the ladder of intoxicants, from marijuana to LSD and
heroin, and soon noticed that people were stupid enough to send cash
in the mail. When he finally got caught stealing, it was during a
sting set up by postal inspectors who had been tipped off.</TE>
<TE>   His marriage dissolved, but Williams married again and now has 10
children. He is devoutly religious and a "law-and-order man,"
Williams said by telephone. "I did wrong 30 years ago. I was the
villain, not the police."</TE>
<TE>   Williams filled out an 18-page pardon application three years ago,
but assumed he'd been rejected until the call came from a Justice
Department lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   The pardon will enable Copley, a 61-year-old crane operator, to
vote once again and go hunting for wild turkey in the countryside
around his central Tennessee home after he retires next spring.</TE>
<TE>   Copley said he had voted until 1998, when he discovered the liquor
conviction was still on his record as a felony. Felons are ineligible
to vote or to carry weapons. He decided to seek a pardon in 1998 and
hired a lawyer to help.</TE>
<TE>   The bootlegging offense seemed minor, and it surprised Copley that
it continued to follow him so long after the 1962 incident, for which
he served two years' probation. Copley was 21 at the time. He and a
friend were tending a backwoods still for the owner when federal
agents surprised them. Jobs were scarce and lots of people resorted
to making whiskey. Copley, with a ninth-grade education, had no job
and dim prospects.</TE>
<TE>   "Life was rough at that time," he said. "If I could have done
anything else, I wouldn't have done that."</TE>
<TE>   Dobas is hoping that, now pardoned, he can reach the rank of
lieutenant colonel in the Oregon State Defense Force. He is 77 years
old now. The three months spent in a federal prison after his
conspiracy conviction in 1966 seem part of some other person's life.</TE>
<TE>   He broke the law while working as a supervisor for a grain
company. The product would spill off the rail boxcars or pile up
inside the walls and some of the workers, including Dobas, scooped it
up and sold it, he said. Over a four-year period, he should have paid
$12,000 in taxes on the earnings, but did not. He lost his job and
had to sell his house to pay the government what he owed.</TE>
<TE>   "The lesson is, pay your taxes," Dobas said.</TE>
<TE>   Dobas still has not received the official pardon document. But
once it is in his hands, he said, he will feel like a college student
grasping a sheepskin.</TE>
<TE>   "Then," he said, "it'll sink in."</TE>

<HD>TV's 'Most Wanted' to Aid in Smart Kidnap Case</HD>
<DH>John Walsh says focus is on a man who worked for family.
Girl's father is surprised by remarks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>John Walsh, host of the high-profile "America's Most Wanted"
television program, says he is helping Elizabeth Smart's family look
for a man who once worked for them who they believe had something to
do with Elizabeth's abduction.</LD>
<LD>   On CNN's "Larry King Live" show Monday night, Walsh said that a
future "America's Most Wanted" will profile a roofer he said was "a
young homeless guy who lived at a homeless shelter" who may have used
an alias when he worked for the Smarts.</LD>
<LD>   Walsh also said Mary Katherine, Elizabeth's younger sister, says
it wasn't former handyman and career criminal Richard Albert Ricci
who came into the girls' bedroom in the middle of the night and took
Elizabeth away at gunpoint. She remains missing.</LD>
<TE>   Ricci, 48, on Aug. 27 suffered a cerebral hemorrhage in his Utah
State Prison cell, where he was being held on a parole violation. His
family took him off life support three days later.</TE>
<TE>   He had been under scrutiny for possible involvement in the
14-year-old girl's disappearance on June 5. He always maintained his
innocence.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh made his "America's Most Wanted" plans with Elizabeth's
parents, Ed and Lois Smart, in New York last week, after taping a
segment for "The John Walsh Show," a daytime talk show on NBC.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Smart said Monday night he wasn't ready to go public with
information on the roofer. "I didn't know [Walsh] was going to do
that," Smart said. "I'm surprised he said what he said. We're working
with the police."</TE>
<TE>   Smart said investigators have long known about the roofer and are
looking for him but don't know where he is. And though he confirmed
Walsh's claims about the upcoming episode, he was cautious about what
the television host said.</TE>
<TE>   "That room was very dark at night," Smart said. "What Mary
Katherine saw and what she didn't see is really hard to know. She's
told her story and I hope at some point soon to basically say exactly
what she said."</TE>
<TE>   Mary Katherine, then 9, was the sole witness to her sister's
abduction. At investigators' request, her parents haven't questioned
their younger daughter on what she told police.In a November
interview, the Smarts told Associated Press that their understanding
was that while Mary Katherine feigned sleep, Elizabeth stubbed her
toe, and her kidnapper said either "if you don't scream, I won't hurt
you," or "be quiet or I'll hurt you."</TE>
<TE>   Mary Katherine got out of bed to follow them.</TE>
<TE>   But when she stood in her doorway and saw them looking into her
brothers' room, she went back to bed, her parents said.</TE>

<HD>Storm Paints a Pretty Scene That Belies Its Fierce Nature</HD>
<DH>The severe weather has given much of the U.S. a white
Christmas, but it is blamed for at least 12 deaths and has slowed
holiday travel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>A heavy Christmas Eve snowstorm swept from the Texas Panhandle
through the Great Plains and up into New England, delighting kids but
delaying holiday travelers -- and coating roads across the region
with treacherous slicks that caused several fatal accidents.</LD>
<LD>   The severe weather has been blamed for at least 12 deaths since
Monday, five of them in Missouri. As it moved northeast, the storm
slowed air and road travel across a broad sweep of the country.</LD>
<LD>   On the bright side, 11-year-old Michelle Scott got to spend the
day pelting her little brothers with snowballs and careening down her
backyard hill in suburban Ballwin, Mo.</LD>
<TE>   "It was awesome!" she said, stepping inside to warm up before a
second round.</TE>
<TE>   Not content with such pedestrian wintertime pursuits, Pat
Huckaby's grandson invented a game of snow basketball in Amarillo,
Texas, where drifts 6 inches deep buried his driveway. "I think it
was just a good excuse to fall down a lot and roll around in it,"
Huckaby said.</TE>
<TE>   The storm gave some parts of the country, especially in Oklahoma
and Kansas, their first white Christmas in years. In places, it was
hard to see the holiday lights through the falling flakes as snow
draped every tree limb and roofline.</TE>
<TE>   "It's beautiful," sighed Bob Westfall, owner of the Bradford Inn
in Branson, Mo. "You should be here."</TE>
<TE>   Only the bravest of drivers could take his advice, however. His
parking lot, he said, was 9 inches under. "It's pretty well got
everyone slowed down to nothing, I'd say."</TE>
<TE>   Accumulation totals around the country ranged from 6 inches in
Tulsa, Okla., to 11 inches in Springfield, Mo. Here in St. Louis,
where the snow came down heavily for eight hours, then tapered into
flurries, forecasters predicted up to 9 inches would settle on the
ground by this morning.</TE>
<TE>   The storm system that created the winter wonderland kicked off its
cross-country tour by pelting Southern California with heavy rains.
Picking up strength as it moved northeast, it dropped 10 inches of
snow in Clovis, N.M., on Monday -- although most of that was melting
away in Tuesday's sun.</TE>
<TE>   At least enough of it melted to get procrastinating Santas back on
the road. "We're packed," reported Michelle Chavez, a Wal-Mart clerk
in Clovis. "Lots of last-minute shoppers."</TE>
<TE>   The storm is expected to move off the New England coast later
today, but not before it hits upstate New York with a wallop, said
meteorologist Jeremy Nelson of Weather Central Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Albany International Airport in upstate New York
lined up cots in the concourse as snow began to fall Tuesday
afternoon, anticipating accumulation of up to 20 inches by Christmas
Day.</TE>
<TE>   Those in the storm's white wake, meanwhile, spent Tuesday trying
to figure how to handle the shoveling and still enjoy a laid-back
holiday. Gaye Brown, a Tulsa real estate agent, came up with the
perfect plot: She planned to give her nephew the blue-and-yellow
skateboard of his dreams -- then point out that he couldn't take it
for a test spin until he cleared the snow off the driveway.</TE>
<TE>   Driving through a light snowfall with drifts up to 9 inches high
on either side of the road, Brown chuckled.</TE>
<TE>   "This sure is fun," she said.</TE>

<HD>INS Allows Couple to Stay While Son Treated for Leukemia</HD>
<DH>Denver-area residents are raising money for the transplant
needed by Oscar Hernandez, 5.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>A Mexican couple living illegally in the United States received an
early holiday gift from immigration officials: permission to stay
while their 5-year-old son is treated for leukemia.</LD>
<LD>   "A dream," Susana Nieto said in Spanish. "This is going to be a
very special Christmas for everything that has happened."</LD>
<LD>   Nieto's son Oscar Hernandez has had leukemia for a year and is
receiving chemotherapy. Doctors say a bone marrow transplant is the
best hope to save his life, and his 7-year-old brother, Jonathan, is
a match.</LD>
<TE>   Besides the couple, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
also granted humanitarian parole to two of their children who are in
the country without permission. Another child, like Oscar, was born
in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The parole was granted for six months and may be extended, said
INS acting District Director Michael Comfort.</TE>
<TE>   Although the family has no health insurance to pay for the
procedure, which Children's Hospital says will cost $314,000, the
Denver area rallied around the family this month as news of its
plight spread.</TE>
<TE>   Children emptied piggy banks. Students took up collections at
schools. One woman donated a fur coat, and another gave a diamond
ring. So far, the efforts have brought in $287,000.</TE>
<TE>   Among those helping to raise money is Rep. Thomas G. Tancredo, an
outspoken opponent of illegal immigration who had sought deportation
of another Mexican family in the fall after reading about one son who
couldn't afford college because federal law bans financial aid for
illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not playing politics here," Tancredo spokeswoman Lara
Kennedy said last week. "The bottom line: A child's life was at
hand."</TE>
<TE>   Leukemia, a cancer of the bone marrow and blood, is the most
common childhood cancer. About 2,700 U.S. children under 15 will be
diagnosed this year, according to the American Cancer Society.</TE>
<TE>   Oscar spent more than a week at the hospital for an infection but
is home now, so the family will be together for Christmas. On
Thursday, however, Oscar will return to the hospital for more
chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   Surgery can't happen until Oscar reaches remission and the
hospital has the money for the procedure, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Some health-care experts allege that Children's is overcharging
the family, saying the hospital's quoted price is significantly
higher than what Oscar's family would pay if it had insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "The real cost for treating him is probably $200,000," said J.D.
Kleinke, a health-care economist and author of "Oxymorons: The Myth
of a U.S. Healthcare System."</TE>
<TE>   The hospital denied it is asking for too much money.</TE>
<TE>   "We are doing everything we can for this family," said Len Dryer,
chief financial officer for Children's.</TE>
<TE>   Nieto and her husband, Pedro Hernandez, said they are overwhelmed
by the help they've received. "We never thought we'd get this kind of
response from the community," Nieto said. "It gives us hope."</TE>

<HD>Even a Little Fish May Cut Stroke Risk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Eating fish just once a month is enough to reduce the risk of strokes
in men, according to a study of more than 43,000 health
professionals.</LD>
<LD>   While numerous studies have touted the cardiovascular benefits of
eating fish several times a week, the new research found a similar
benefit from just occasional meals of seafood.</LD>
<LD>   Men who ate about 3 to 5 ounces of fish one to three times a month
were 43% less likely to have a stroke during 12 years of follow-up.
Men who ate fish more often did not reduce their risk any further,
suggesting that a small amount works just as well as a larger one,
said co-writer Dr. Ka He of Harvard's School of Public Health and
colleagues.</LD>
<TE>   Their findings appear in today's Journal of the American Medical
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   A study in the journal last year found that women who ate about 4
ounces of fish two to four times a week cut their stroke risk by 48%.
The study found lower risk reductions in women who ate fish once a
week or less.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the new results would apply to women was not known.</TE>
<TE>   The American Heart Assn.'s dietary recommendations include two
servings of fish a week.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers in the Harvard study said the reasons for their
findings were unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Omega-3 fatty acids, found in most fish, have been shown to lower
levels of blood fats linked to cardiovascular disease and to help
keep blood from clotting.</TE>
<TE>   The study involved risk reductions for ischemic, or clot-related
strokes, the most common kind.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers noted that native Alaskans eat a lot of fish and
have a high incidence of hemorrhagic, or bleeding, strokes.</TE>
<TE>   That has raised concerns that while the anti-clotting effects of
fish can decrease the risk of clot-related strokes, they can have the
opposite effect on bleeding strokes.</TE>
<TE>   The Harvard study found no significant link between fish
consumption and bleeding strokes, but only 106 of the 608 strokes
that occurred were the bleeding type.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers said more study is needed.</TE>
<TE>   The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health.</TE>

<HD>Spirit of Giving Aids City in Need</HD>
<DH>York, Pa., frayed by a racially charged murder trial, now
faces a hefty budget deficit. But its neighbors are helping, $3.32 at
a time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephen Braun</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>YORK, Pa.</DL>
<LD>YORK, Pa. -- When the mail came Monday morning to the weather-beaten
limestone City Hall in this troubled Pennsylvania town, secretaries
and city workers peeked into the office of Mayor John Brenner and
gaped in awe.</LD>
<LD>   Stacked atop a copier were three bulging mounds of letters that
stretched U.S. Postal Service rubber bands to the breaking point. The
letters contained checks totaling roughly $10,000, many sent by
suburban residents heeding the mayor's desperate plea for a
financially strapped city facing a bleak Christmas.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of checks have been flooding in, earmarked for the "332
Fund," a bank account hastily set up by city officials last week
after Brenner urged York County officials to help the city stave off
layoffs and make up for a $1-million budget shortfall -- the
equivalent of one $3.32 McDonald's Chicken McNuggets meal for each of
the county's 302,000 adult residents.</LD>
<TE>   "That would buy a lot of chicken, but we've got better things in
mind," said Brenner, astonished at the city's windfall.</TE>
<TE>   The spate of donations will not single-handedly lift York out of
the budgetary chaos that is plaguing cities across the nation this
winter. Brenner's immediate target of $700,000 in extra funds would
not be enough to prevent the looming Dec. 31 layoffs of nine police
officers and six firefighters. But the outpouring of aid represents a
start in stemming further layoffs in this county seat, whose heritage
stretches back to the post-Revolutionary War era. And the wave of
goodwill has cemented bonds across urban borders at a time of the
year when many of the city's 40,000 residents were expecting the
worst.</TE>
<TE>   York's burst of civic-minded charity also comes as no small sign
of reassurance after a hard year of torment. Brenner's predecessor,
Charlie Robertson, was tried for murder in the fall along with two
other men in the slaying of Lillie Belle Allen, a black woman gunned
down during the city's devastating 1969 race riots. Although the
others were convicted in October, Robertson was acquitted -- but only
after he was assailed as a bigot and York's police department was
publicly embarrassed by its failure to prevent Allen's death and
properly investigate the case.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson's trial had no effect on the city's financial troubles,
because the costs were borne by county prosecutors and police. But
Brenner and other city officials say the city's financial plight was
worsened by a series of ill-conceived expenditures and personnel
moves that Robertson made during his long term as mayor.</TE>
<TE>   The bitterness of the Robertson era lingered as late as last week,
when the two remaining defendants in the Allen case were finally
sentenced. But by then, many York residents were already turning
their attention to the city's financial woes. The first checks were
trickling in, growing to a tide that reached $25,000 by Christmas
Eve.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to have some good news for a change," Brenner said.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, suburban families who have cocooned themselves off from
York's blighted core for years have suddenly been showing up at City
Hall's massive oak doors, dropping off $3.32 in cash and checks as
happily as if they were tossing coins into a Salvation Army kettle.</TE>
<TE>   "We just felt we had to give something back, because we come down
here so much," said Mike Weiler, 36, a computer designer who braved
stiff winds with his wife and two children to drop off their
donation.</TE>
<TE>   Weiler said he was giving a $6.64 check because his son, Mitchell,
13, and daughter, Kassia, 11, often use a city library and lunch at
an old city marketplace downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Weiler's wife, Deborah, 40, who waits tables at a Pizza Hut,
brought $5 from her tip jar. "I think the city could use it more than
I could," she said.</TE>
<TE>   That became gloomily evident this month, after Brenner and York
financial officials had spent months trying to devise a strategy to
ward off the same nightmarish budget woes that have afflicted
thousands of American cities pinched by the sluggish economy.</TE>
<TE>   Flailing to avoid imposing a 40% hike in the city's property tax
rate, York officials concluded that they would have to lay off up to
18 police officers and 14 firefighters. After several grim internal
meetings, Brenner decided that there was a third option -- asking for
charity.</TE>
<TE>   Brenner, elected this year, was in a bind. "We didn't want the
city to get an image of begging for help," he said. "But we had to be
realistic. We needed help."</TE>
<TE>   City officials began meeting with dozens of tax-exempt religious
groups and social agencies, asking them to donate half of what their
typical tax burden would be if they did not have exempt status.
Brenner said their aid could provide as much as $350,000.</TE>
<TE>   But the city needs $720,000 to keep the layoffs at current levels
-- and $1.2 million to stave off the layoffs altogether. So Brenner
again pleaded for help, asking York County to make up the city's
shortfall. Grasping for a way to grab the attention of county
officials, Brenner picked up on a comment he remembered from an
in-house meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew there were about 300,000 people in the county and we
wanted to make the case that if each of them contributed the same
amount, it would give us the $1 million we needed. And someone said:
'Hey, that's the price of a McNuggets meal.' "</TE>
<TE>   The line fell flat with York County's commissioners, who rejected
the idea. Within weeks, city employees began receiving layoff
notices: They would be gone Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   But a movement was quietly gathering. Local newspaper columnists
and talk show hosts picked up the drumbeat. By last weekend, the
movement was in full swing. Insurance executives and bank presidents
were calling Brenner at home, promising $3.32 contributions on behalf
of their employees.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the checks flooding into City Hall came with notes
attached. Some explained they were written on behalf of spouses,
children and pets, or for companies that have business in York.</TE>
<TE>   "Here is our $3.32," read one letter. "I would hate to see someone
laid off at this time of year." Another donor dreamily recalled
tearoom lunches and bags of peanuts bought from city vendors: "I
appreciate what the city has to offer."</TE>
<TE>   Not all York County residents are so magnanimous. While York is
the county seat, the two jurisdictions have separate budgets. York's
tax base is weak and "flat-lined," Brenner admits, while York
County's tax base has been growing steadily with new housing and
commercial development. As York's population has declined for years,
many affluent families have fled to York County to ward off the
perils of city life.</TE>
<TE>   York Council President Joseph Musso was stunned when one suburban
acquaintance sneered that city officials " 'Should go out with
buckets like those homeless guys.' That's the kind of attitude we're
up against."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Hodges, a transient holding a milk jug for donations to the
homeless near the York County Courthouse, said he could handle the
competition from the city.</TE>
<TE>   "The city should have seen this coming," Hodges said. "But hey, if
they need it, they need it."</TE>
<TE>   He shook his milk jug, rattling his donations until a passing
businessman tossed several coins inside. "A city's like any man, you
know? Both got to have money to survive. And this is the season to
keep it coming."</TE>

<LD>It was New Year's Day 1956, and at the Rose Bowl, 30 or so rows up on
about the 35-yard line, Alvin Kajzerkowski, his parents, two sisters,
a brother-in-law and a nephew got to their feet, as did more than
100,000 other fans, to get a better view of the final play of the
game, a field-goal attempt.</LD>
<LD>   The score was 14-14, seven seconds remained, ball on the UCLA 31,
Michigan State in possession.</LD>
<LD>   The long trip west from their home in Alpena, Mich., had been a
dream come true for Adam and Gertrude Kajzerkowski. Their youngest
child, Dave, was a sophomore and the starting right end for Michigan
State, and they had seen all of his games, home and away, since he'd
started at the Pee Wee level.</LD>
<TE>   The official program, however, listed no "Kajzerkowski" on the
Spartans' roster, and that was just one of the confusing little
things about this particular Rose Bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   Dave's three brothers had all been outstanding athletes. The two
oldest, Stan and Gerald, had been baseball players, and Al, like
Dave, had been a four-year football letterman at Alpena High. The
sportswriters in Dave's hometown had tired of spelling out
"Kajzerkowski" in their stories and had shortened the name to
"Kaiser." So that was the name he played under.</TE>
<TE>   With the game down to its final seconds and the fans going crazy,
as Michigan State went back into its huddle, Spartan quarterback Earl
Morrall said to Kaiser, "We need a field goal, Dave. You kick it."</TE>
<TE>   In today's football, quarterbacks don't call plays and
specialists, not position players, do the kicking. But in '56, when
the Michigan State offense took the field, Morrall was pretty much in
charge. And Kaiser was one of two placekickers.</TE>
<TE>   "The coaches gave us the opening sequence of plays in our games,
but after that, Earl called them all," recalled Kaiser.</TE>
<TE>   That's also how the late Duffy Daugherty, the coach, remembered it
in "The Spartans, A History of Michigan State Football," written by
the late Fred Stabley, Michigan State's longtime sports information
director.</TE>
<TE>   "Earl called practically every play in every game," Daugherty told
Stabley, adding that he sent in maybe three or four every game. "The
rest of the time he was on his own."</TE>
<TE>   At the Rose Bowl, Daugherty made a minor exception to his
play-calling rule but, as it turned out, both quarterback and coach
were of the same mind.</TE>
<TE>   "Rudy Gaddini came in holding a kicking tee," remembered Kaiser.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Duffy wants Dave to kick a field goal," Kaiser recalled the
substitute halfback shouting to make himself heard over the crowd's
roar.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, another kicker, fullback Jerry Planutis, had kicked two
extra points and had tried -- and missed -- two field-goal attempts.
Planutis was on the field too, so there was confusion in the stands
and even in the press box about who would be making the deciding
field-goal attempt for the Spartans. Most assumed it would be
Planutis.</TE>
<TE>   The late Stabley, in his book, wrote, "Even the official
play-by-play report distributed in the press box named Planutis as
the kicker."</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser said the probable cause for the confusion was Michigan
State's offense hurrying to get a play going.</TE>
<TE>   State had been penalized the previous play for delay of game and
did not want another penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Even Kaiser's own father didn't realize his son was the kicker.</TE>
<TE>   To this day, both Dave and his brother Al insist that NBC
sportscaster Mel Allen, who was doing the telecast, "was the only guy
who got it right."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The road to Michigan State had not been a direct one for Kaiser.
The school had actually been his second choice. He'd gone to Notre
Dame as a freshman.</TE>
<TE>   At 6 feet 1 and 195 pounds, Kaiser had been an outstanding high
school running back at Alpena High, all-state his junior and senior
seasons, prep All-America as a senior.</TE>
<TE>   Alpena, a town of about 10,000 on Lake Huron's Thunder Bay, was
best known in the early '50s for its chinook fishing -- it still is
-- and its outstanding high school football teams.</TE>
<TE>   The prime reasons for the latter were Kaiser and the school's
highly successful coach, Bob Devaney.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser finally chose Notre Dame, rather than joining his brother
Al at Michigan State.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to play for Frank Leahy and my parents were Catholic,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   When Leahy resigned for health reasons after the 1953 season, and
Terry Brennan was named his successor, Kaiser began thinking of
transferring to Michigan State, where Devaney, his old high school
coach, was now an assistant.</TE>
<TE>   He made the switch in the fall of 1954, then asked to move from
running back to end. The coaching staff readily agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Out of uniform, Kaiser, who wore heavy, plastic-rim glasses,
looked more like a graduate assistant than a football player. He
sometimes wore contact lenses but they were the old-style cup type
that irritated his eyes and Kaiser said he never wore them in games.</TE>
<TE>   "I never had any trouble following the ball," he said. "I held the
school record for yards per completion for years until Kirk Gibson
broke it."</TE>
<TE>   He was known for wearing contacts, though, and that also led to
some Rose Bowl confusion.</TE>
<TE>   The 1956 Rose Bowl would be a rematch of the 1954 game, in which
Michigan State had beaten UCLA, 28-20. There was one significant
change. Daugherty had taken over as the Spartans' coach when Biggie
Munn moved up to the athletic director's job. Each team had a 9-1
record and each was ranked high in the Associated Press poll,
Michigan State second, UCLA fourth.</TE>
<TE>   In Pasadena, the Rose Bowl press corps quickly found the merry
Daugherty a welcome change from the grumpy Woody Hayes and Ohio
State's closed-practice policy the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Much to the consternation of his assistants, at a press open
house, Daugherty ran the Spartans through dummy plays and explained
them to the 3,500 in attendance, saying, "By this time, UCLA should
know our plays pretty well so what's the harm in showing the press
our stuff?"</TE>
<TE>   One of the plays Daugherty showcased, though, was a new one, which
in the game went for a touchdown. Early in the fourth quarter,
Morrall took the snap and lateraled to halfback Clarence Peaks, who
then passed to end John "Big Thunder" Lewis. Lewis caught the pass at
midfield and went the rest of the way, the scoring play covering 67
yards. Planutis' extra point made it 14-7, Michigan State.</TE>
<TE>   But UCLA came right back when Doug Peters went over center for a
touchdown, and after the extra point it was 14-14 with 8:53 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State took the kickoff and moved the ball to the UCLA 24.
On fourth and 12, Planutis missed a field-goal attempt, as he had
earlier, and it looked as if the game would end in a 14-14 tie.</TE>
<TE>   But an intentional grounding call late in the game left the Bruins
with fourth down at their own one.</TE>
<TE>   Ronnie Knox punted to the UCLA 40, but UCLA's captain, Hardiman
Cureton, was called for interfering with the State receiver and the
Spartans got the ball at the Bruin 19.</TE>
<TE>   With time running out, an MSU holding penalty moved the ball back
to the 30, after which a pass completion put the ball on the 19.
State then was called for the delay penalty, moving the ball back to
the UCLA 24 and setting up the Spartans' 41-yard field-goal attempt.</TE>
<TE>   And Dave Kaiser would be trying it.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser had started the season as one of three Spartan kickers.
Morrall did the punting, Planutis extra points and short field goals,
and Kaiser handled kickoffs and long three-point attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Before suffering an early-season leg injury against Michigan,
Kaiser had missed two long field-goal attempts. Each time, the ball
had tailed off to the left of the upright.</TE>
<TE>   When Kaiser was hurt, Morrall added kickoffs to his punting chores
and Planutis kicked all field goals.</TE>
<TE>   By Rose Bowl time, however, Kaiser's leg was healed and he was
kicking well in practice, so Morrall and Daugherty had confidence in
him.</TE>
<TE>   There was a glitch, though.</TE>
<TE>   In three seasons as the Spartans' center, Joe Badaczewski had made
all his snaps flawlessly on extra points, punts and field-goal
attempts. The streak ended in the '56 Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser was in the middle of a practice kick when Badaczewski,
apparently confused, snapped the ball to Morrall, the holder. Kaiser,
a straight-ahead kicker, as was customary at the time, instinctively
stepped back, swung through again, and made solid contact with the
ball.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was going to be good as soon as my foot made contact
with the ball," he remembered.</TE>
<TE>   But with the kick about three-quarters of the way toward the goal,
and starting to veer left, Kaiser swung around to watch the referee.
It made for a memorable end-zone camera shot, every face but one
watching the flight of the ball, the kicker standing with his back to
the action.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser didn't see the ball go over the crossbar and through the
uprights, but he did see the referee's arms go straight up. The kick
was good. Michigan State had won, 17-14.</TE>
<TE>   As the crowd started toward the exits, Alvin Kaiser said, "Well,
Dad, should we go down to the dressing room and congratulate the
kicker?"</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I don't think so, Al. I'm sure Jerry Planutis will have
plenty of his family there to congratulate him."</TE>
<TE>   "But, Dad," replied Al, "it was Dave who kicked it."</TE>
<TE>   And some of that confusion remains today. In Rose Bowl game
programs, in the capsule summaries of games past, there is this line
about Kaiser's winning kick in 1956: "To add to the excitement,
Kaiser had lost one of his contact lenses and couldn't see the
goalposts clearly."</TE>
<TE>   None of that changes the score, though, or the fact that Dave
Kaiser had, surprisingly, kicked Michigan State to victory.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 31, 1999, he was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame,
the first and only Michigan State Spartan to be so honored.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1952, at 37, hopes of becoming a college football coach were
fading fast for Dave Kaiser's high school coach in Alpena, Mich.,
Robert S. Devaney.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Saginaw, Mich., Bob Devaney had worked three years in a
foundry to earn tuition to tiny, nearby Alma College, where he'd
captained the football team, graduating in 1939.</LD>
<LD>   Then there were high school coaching jobs at Big Beaver, Keego
Harbor and Saginaw, before Alpena.</LD>
<TE>   By then, Devaney was giving serious thought to becoming a high
school administrator.</TE>
<TE>   But 10 years later, Devaney would be hired as coach at Nebraska to
turn around a football program that had suffered 17 losing seasons in
the previous 21.</TE>
<TE>   No one knew it at the time, but the Cornhusker dynasty was
beginning.</TE>
<TE>   Sandwiched between Alpena and Lincoln were four years as an
assistant at Michigan State and five as head coach at Wyoming, where
his teams were 35-10-5.</TE>
<TE>   Devaney's first year at Nebraska, the Cornhuskers went 9-2 and
beat Miami in the Gotham Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   He was described as "a fiery bulldog who had the persona to affect
and inspire everyone around him. And to win."</TE>
<TE>   In 11 years as Nebraska's coach, his teams went 101-20-2, won
eight Big Eight titles and national championships in 1970 and 1971,
when he was named college football's coach of the year.</TE>
<TE>   His overall winning percentage of .806 on a record of 136-30-11 is
10th best in the history of NCAA Division I football</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, Devaney was inducted into the College Football Hall of
Fame.</TE>
<TE>   "Bob was probably the most important coach ever at Nebraska," said
his handpicked successor, Tom Osborne, the school's winningest coach
and now a congressman from the state's third district.</TE>

<HD>Yankees Splurge, Obtain Contreras</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Yankees' need to cut payroll ends at the U.S. border.</LD>
<LD>   For the second time in less than a week, baseball's biggest
spenders broke their budget for a big international acquisition,
reaching a preliminary agreement Tuesday on a four-year, $32-million
contract with Cuban defector Jose Contreras.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, the Yankees agreed to a three-year, $21-million deal
with outfielder Hideki Matsui, Japan's leading slugger. The agreement
with Contreras means the Yankees will have eight starting pitchers on
the roster as soon as their deal to re-sign Roger Clemens is
completed.</LD>
<TE>   "We couldn't, the right word is we wouldn't, sacrifice the
opportunity to sign these talents on the basis of reducing payroll
first," Yankee General Manager Brian Cashman said.</TE>
<TE>   Contreras, a right-hander who said he is 31, got the largest deal
ever for a Cuban defector, topping the four-year, $14.5-million deal
Cleveland gave pitcher Danys Baez three years ago. Contreras throws
in the mid-90s, and the Yankees envision him as part of their
rotation.</TE>
<TE>   Contreras pitched for Cuba's national team for seven years. He was
117-50 with a 2.82 ERA in the Cuban League, according to the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Red Sox signed reliever Chad Fox and finalized Mike
Timlin's one-year, $1.85-million contract.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, 32, had only six appearances in Milwaukee and double-A
Huntsville last season after going 5-2 with a 1.89 earned-run average
and two saves in 65 appearances for Milwaukee in 2001. Timlin, 36,
went 4-6 with a 2.97 ERA in 72 games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pitchers Jose Rijo and Pete Harnisch agreed to minor league
contracts with the Cincinnati Reds, giving them a chance to prolong
careers interrupted by elbow operations. The Reds also signed
infielder Wilton Guerrero to a minor league deal. All three were
invited to spring training.... Former Toronto Blue Jay manager Tim
Johnson became the manager of the Lincoln Saltdogs of the Northern
League. Johnson was fired by Toronto in 1999 after lying about his
military service in Vietnam.... Right-handed reliever Jay Witasick
rejoined the San Diego Padres, agreeing to a two-year, $2.75-million
contract.</TE>

<HD>Big Ten Wants Davis Suspended</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Big Ten asked Indiana to suspend Coach Mike Davis for his
outburst at the end of Saturday's game against Kentucky.</LD>
<LD>   The university said it will respond to the request Friday, the
deadline set by the conference.</LD>
<LD>   The Big Ten notified Indiana by letter Monday that it expected the
school to impose sanctions. Interim Athletic Director Terry Clapacs
said it was implied that if Indiana did not penalize Davis the
conference would.</LD>
<TE>   The Big Ten would not confirm the length of a possible suspension
or the nature of a reprimand.</TE>
<TE>   Clapacs said Tuesday he has spoken with Davis and will do so again
before making a decision. Indiana's next game is Saturday at Temple.</TE>
<TE>   "What I did was wrong, and I'll support Terry Clapacs and our
administration with whatever they think is right," Davis told the
Indianapolis Star.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' tirade came near the end of Indiana's 70-64 loss to
Kentucky in Louisville on Saturday. With 2.6 seconds left and Indiana
trailing, 65-64, Hoosier guard Bracy Wright drove for a layup and the
ball hit the side of the backboard. Davis wanted a foul but none was
called.</TE>
<TE>   Davis ran on the court in protest, waving his arms at official
Bert Smith. He drew two technical fouls and was ejected before Keith
Bogans made five of six free throws to seal the win.</TE>
<TE>   During his postgame news conference, Davis was apologetic, saying
his actions cost his team the game. He also apologized to his players
and the fans.</TE>
<TE>   Clapacs was supportive of Davis afterward, and he again spoke
highly of him Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a terrific coach and a terrific man, and the Kentucky game
means a lot to him," Clapacs said. "Clearly, he coaches with
passion."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina will report a secondary recruiting violation to the
NCAA after an assistant basketball coach spoke to a high school
player this month.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina Coach Matt Doherty said his staff would be careful
not to repeat the mistake, one that is not likely to result in a
serious penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Fred Quartlebaum spoke briefly to Justin Bohlander of
Winston-Salem Reynolds after the recruit's Dec. 14 game. The
conversation came during a period in which contact with players is
not allowed.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Randy Hill of Foxsports.com on CBS football commentator Deion
Sanders' interest in coming out of retirement to play for the Oakland
Raiders:</LD>
<LD>   "In his prime, it was presumed that Sanders had the ability to
prevent a 7-Eleven from being open. Even on fumes, his presence could
do, well, something, for a crippled Oakland secondary.</LD>
<LD>   "However, Raider [executive] Bruce Allen is questioning Deion's
sources. 'We're not interested in hiring Deion,' Allen said, 'because
we don't have our own studio show.'</LD>
<TE>   "Allen's statement seems to contradict the Raiders' Commitment to
Excavation, a policy that embraces potential contributions from
fossilized superstars."</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders won't get a chance to sign Sanders, who was claimed
off waivers by five teams Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What school has won the most Las Vegas Bowl games?</TE>
<TE>   No pain, no gain: The Denver Post's Jim Armstrong says he feels
the pain of the NBA's young guns: "NBA superstar Tracy McGrady has a
chronic bad back, and he's in his mid-20s. Hey, I can relate, bro. I
had to pop a couple of ibuprofens to make it through this column."</TE>
<TE>   Closed-door policy: Chicago Blackhawk owner Bill Wirtz blames NHL
players for driving up ticket prices and causing fans to stay home.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in the family entertainment business, and a lot of families
can't afford to go to a hockey game anymore," he told the Chicago
Tribune. "Not only in Chicago, throughout the league.</TE>
<TE>   "But we don't charge what we charge because we want to. We charge
what we have to. The players keep wanting more and more. Pretty soon
they'll want the key to my door. Well, God bless 'em. I love them
all. But I love my door even more."</TE>
<TE>   Add Wirtz: Wirtz, hinting at the likelihood of a work stoppage
when the NHL collective bargaining agreement expires in 2004, somehow
managed to take a shot at former Bull coach Phil Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "Read Phil Jackson's autobiography. What a colossal ego," Wirtz
said. "The coach and players should get everything, and nobody else
gets anything. That's bull. Got to stop."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this date on 1971, Garo Yepremian's 37-yard field
goal in the second overtime gave the Miami Dolphins a 27-24 victory
over the Kansas City Chiefs in the first round of the AFC playoffs.
At 82 minutes 40 seconds, it's the longest game in NFL history.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back again: On this date in 1999, Hawaii beat Oregon,
23-17, in the Oahu Bowl to mark the greatest single-season turnaround
in NCAA history. The Rainbow Warriors went from 0-12 in 1998 to 9-4.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Nevada Las Vegas and Utah have each won twice. The
Rebels beat Central Michigan, 52-24, in 1994 and Arkansas, 31-14, in
2000; the Utes beat Fresno State, 17-16, in 1999 and USC, 10-6, in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: The NFL Scrooged the Jacksonville Jaguars this year.
According to the Orlando Sentinel, the league nixed the team's
tradition of painting a Santa Claus hat on the Jaguar head on the
50-yard line at Alltel Stadium. Bah humbug.</TE>

<LD>It now appears the Clippers will get not one but two small forwards
back by the weekend. Corey Maggette and Lamar Odom could be sound by
the time the team plays Saturday against the Golden State Warriors at
Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   "It appears that way," Coach Alvin Gentry said after Tuesday's
practice at L.A. Southwest College.</LD>
<LD>   Gentry has suffered in relative silence while watching one key
player after another fall to various injuries. Every member of the
starting five has been sidelined for at least one game this season.</LD>
<TE>   Maggette underwent arthroscopic surgery to remove damaged
cartilage from his right knee Nov. 29 and was expected to be
sidelined at least one month. The team's medical staff will monitor
Maggette after Thursday's workout and decide after the Friday morning
shoot-around whether he is fit to play either that night against the
Suns at Phoenix or Saturday against the Warriors.</TE>
<TE>   Odom, sidelined for 11 months by wrist and ankle injuries, is
scheduled to play Saturday against the Warriors.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry cautioned against expecting too much from either player,
however.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to get everybody back and playing together," he said.
"It's going to take a little time. Lamar hasn't played in almost a
year and it's been a month since Corey last played."</TE>
<TE>   Maggette had been filling in for Odom as the Clippers' starting
small forward since Odom was put on the injured list Jan. 24. Gentry
has used rookie point guard Marko Jaric at that spot and, more
recently, second-year forward Tremaine Fowlkes. The team is 6-5 since
Maggette had surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "Corey is an energy guy," Gentry said. "There are going to be
nights when he gets it going for a period of time. He has the ability
to take over a game. Plus, he's been our best defender on the
perimeter the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   "You could tell he wasn't right [earlier this season] because of
his knee. Hopefully, we'll get him back to the defensive form he's
had the last couple of years."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The status of Elton Brand (calf), Andre Miller (ankle), Eric
Piatkowski (abdominal strain) and Quentin Richardson (ankle) for the
weekend games remained uncertain Tuesday. Gentry hoped a few days
without practices or games would give those injured players a solid
rest and recovery period.</TE>
<TE>   Of the possibility of getting them sound enough to play against
the Suns, Gentry said, "We won't know until Friday comes and we march
out for the shoot-around and we see how those guys feel."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry has been particularly concerned about Miller, who sprained
his left ankle in a collision with Sacramento's Bobby Jackson on Nov.
29. Miller sat out one game, Dec. 1 against Indiana, but has limped
through the last few games.</TE>
<TE>   "You guys could see how he's struggled," Gentry said, nodding
toward a couple of reporters. "It will be good to sit him over there
[on the sideline during practice] and get him a little rest."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There's no telling what the Clippers will do to make room for
Maggette and Odom on their 12-player roster.</TE>
<TE>   It would appear Fowlkes has earned a spot on the roster for the
rest of the season, after scoring a career-best 16 points in
Saturday's victory over the Denver Nuggets and playing sound defense
against such standouts as Kevin Garnett of the Minnesota
Timberwolves.</TE>

<HD>'Prime Time' Rerun Gets Canceled</HD>
<DH>Raider efforts to add Sanders dashed when five teams claim
him. Chargers get him, put him on reserve-retired.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Memo to Deion Sanders: Don't quit your day job.</LD>
<LD>   Concerned the Oakland Raiders would land the former All-Pro
cornerback, five AFC teams -- Indianapolis, Kansas City, Pittsburgh,
San Diego and Tennessee -- stepped in Tuesday and derailed the deal
by putting in waiver claims for Sanders.</LD>
<LD>   He was awarded to San Diego (8-7), the team lowest in the
standings, although he almost certainly will never wear a Charger
uniform. He was simply transferred from Washington's reserve-retired
list to San Diego's. The Chiefs have the same record as the Chargers,
but San Diego has priority in waiver picks because it has a weaker
schedule.</LD>
<TE>   According to a league source, several other teams were waiting in
line to claim him if those teams had not.</TE>
<TE>   Sanders, a studio analyst for CBS, has not played since the 2000
season. He made seven Pro Bowl appearances, won Super Bowls with the
49ers and Cowboys, and is widely considered one of the best defensive
players in NFL history.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from several teams were troubled, angered even, by the
willingness of Redskin owner Daniel Snyder to essentially offer
Sanders to the Raiders, who are one victory away from becoming the
AFC's top-seeded team in the playoffs despite an injury-riddled
secondary.</TE>
<TE>   The Redskins released Sanders on Monday, and Snyder told ESPN.com:
"I have no problems with him playing for the Oakland Raiders. We
don't care. If it were the Eagles or Giants, it wouldn't happen. All
[Raider executive] Bruce Allen has to do is call me direct and it
will happen. I love Bruce Allen and I love Al Davis, and I think it
would be really exciting."</TE>
<TE>   A little too exciting, apparently, for the teams who could wind up
facing the Raiders in the playoffs.</TE>

<HD>Bylsma Gets Big Assist Off the Ice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks' Dan Bylsma does what he can, on the ice and off.</LD>
<LD>   As a player, he is an effective fourth-line forward who excels as
a penalty killer, with bruises from blocked shots as medals.</LD>
<LD>   As a parent, he does even more for the game of hockey.</LD>
<TE>   Bylsma founded a program to build accountability and sportsmanship
among parents, coaches and players. His IT PAYS program has become
popular in Southern California and his home state of Michigan, and is
catching on in other areas.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks and Kings help sponsor the program; the NHL and players'
union help out too.</TE>
<TE>   The idea, Bylsma, said is nothing new, just absent sometimes.</TE>
<TE>   "What's important to me is what lessons my son learns from playing
the game," said Bylsma, whose son, Bryan, is 3. "Whether he's good at
it, that's not my responsibility. I'm responsible to see that the
atmosphere where he gets to do things, like playing sports, is a
healthy one."</TE>
<TE>   Bylsma and his father, Jay Bylsma, have collaborated writing books
about youth sports, and got involved a year ago when hockey parent
Thomas Junta was on trial for involuntary manslaughter for beating to
death a fellow parent.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, Bylsma, who corresponds with hockey parents
and coaches, received a letter from a youth coach that alarmed him.</TE>
<TE>   "The letter started out saying what a good weekend he and his team
had at a tournament," Bylsma said. "He said they lost their first
game, 8-0, and the parents from the other team were mocking his
players and the other team was bullying them. Their last game, they
won, 5-1, and there were incidents after the game. He was cornered by
parents and backed up against the wall. He commented that he narrowly
avoided a physical confrontation. He said this was a good weekend."</TE>
<TE>   Bylsma discussed it with his father and the two came up with a
list of sportsmanship criteria to distribute to youth coaches and
parents. The response was positive, which led to a Web site,
www.hockeyitpays.com.</TE>
<TE>   The program includes an online reporting system, which grades and
tracks the behavior of teams, players and coaches. After a game, a
representative from each team and the on-ice officials file a report
that is available to other coaches and parents.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to have a tournament or are making a schedule, you
can screen the teams you want to play," Bylsma said. "There is a
paper trail for their behavior."</TE>
<TE>   There are 29 associations involved, mostly in Southern California.
Other areas include Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't necessarily think I was the person to do this or that I
had the time," Bylsma said. "But if not me, who? If not now, when?"</TE>

<LD>For the Kings, three is the key.</LD>
<LD>   When they've scored at least three goals this season, they're
14-0-1-1. When they haven't, they're 1-12-3-2, their only victory by
2-0 over the Dallas Stars.</LD>
<LD>   "We think that with our goaltending and our defense, if we score
three goals, we'll win all the time," Coach Andy Murray said. "We've
talked about that as a team. We think we've got a chance to win if we
score one because we can shut teams out, or if we get two, we've got
a chance.</LD>
<TE>   "But if we get three, it's pretty well guaranteed we're going to
win because we play pretty good defense. That's the way we look at
it.</TE>
<TE>   "Our magic number is three."</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen times in 34 games, however, they've failed to reach it.</TE>
<TE>   They've waited more than a year for consistent so-called secondary
scoring to develop in support of their top line of Jason Allison,
Ziggy Palffy and Adam Deadmarsh and a prolific defense corps led by
Mathieu Schneider and Jaroslav Modry. But Murray said he is not
particular about who scores.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it matters where it comes from," he said. "It's
good for how players feel about themselves when they notch a goal or
two. They have a bit of a better stride at practice the next day.</TE>
<TE>   "But we don't really care where the goals come from."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings average 2.71 goals a game, up from last season's 2.61.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, 12-12-4-3 since a 3-0 start, are only four points ahead
of their pace from last season, when they were 13-14-5-2 after 34
games, good for 11th place in the Western Conference. They're 10th in
the West this morning.... Because of injuries, the No. 1 line of
Allison, Palffy and Deadmarsh has been intact for only eight games,
but they've made the most of them, notching 13 goals and 19 assists.</TE>

<KH>SACRAMENTO AT LAKERS TONIGHT, 5:30, CH. 7</KH>
<HD>Package Arrives Minus Some Parts</HD>
<DH>After coming so close to the NBA Finals last season, the
energized Kings (22-8) are ready to take the upper hand in their
heated rivalry with Lakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not these pests again.</LD>
<LD>   It's how it is. There's always someone who can't deal with your
success. So no matter how far past them you go, they still think
they're on your level. So you just have to show them, even if it
means giving up your Christmas.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, when you're doing as well as the Kings, every day's a
holiday and you can give one up.</LD>
<TE>   And when you're doing as badly as the Lakers, you welcome the
opportunity to show you're as good as the big guys.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, we've seen some changes in the Laker-King rivalry, or,
according to this season's standings, where the Lakers trail by 10
1/2 games, the King-Laker rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   Forget the years of abject submission that culminated in the
Kings' heartbreaking loss in last spring's Western Conference finals
-- as they're still trying to do. It's another day.</TE>
<TE>   "The approach I have taken was, that was last year," says Coach
Rick Adelman. "That's one of the few things I agree with Shaq on,
that was last year and it's a new year."</TE>
<TE>   And so far, it doesn't look like any we have seen, either.</TE>
<TE>   Like, now, this is actually a rivalry. Once, it was only in the
heads of the downtrodden Kings and their alternative-challenged fans,
but last spring's epic series got through to the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's real. Or maybe it was a coincidence that Shaquille O'Neal
called them "Queens" before the season, and Rick Fox tangled with
Doug Christie in an exhibition game, then jumped him again on the way
to the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   Christie had admitted to lumping it on the shot he air-balled in
last spring's Game 7. Fox thought Christie was out to show he was
over it in a manly way, persuading Fox he had to respond in like
manner. Christie thought Fox was trying to intimidate him. Of such
misunderstandings are rivalries made.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the Kings were upset by the catcalling, but before the
season, quiet man Mike Bibby predicted they'd win 70 games.</TE>
<TE>   Someone must have told him that had only been done once in NBA
history. In any case, Bibby broke a bone in his right foot, sat out
the first seven weeks and now watches what he says.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I'm just trying to hype us up," he said recently. "I
mean, we don't have to win 70 games to be successful. Just as long as
we win 50-60 games, we'll be all right."</TE>
<TE>   Like, three-time defending champions or not, the Lakers don't own
the Kings anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the Kings' ambitions widened in recent years, they were
never on the Lakers' level, hoping only for one of those
David-and-Goliath upsets.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, however, the former bumpkins beat the city slickers
for the division title. Then came their collector's-item West finals,
when the Lakers had to come from 24 points down in Game 4 and drop in
a three-pointer at the buzzer to avoid going down, 3-1 ... and get 27
free throws in the fourth quarter of Game 6 to avoid elimination ...
and win a tense Game 7 in overtime in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   All of which the Lakers did, of course.</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, it was terrible," says the Kings'
long-serving-and-suffering personnel director, Jerry Reynolds.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not over it yet. It's one of those things where for two
weeks, I just pouted like a child. And then, about the time I got
over it, I realized how much money it had cost me.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think it's one of those things you never get over, 'cause
we felt like we should have won the series. No disrespect to them. I
don't want to get into all that because, I mean, they're the Lakers,
they're a great team. They've proven that before. But we felt we were
in a position to win and should have won and didn't."</TE>
<TE>   When the Kings dried their eyes, they went back to work, adding
overlooked free agent Keon Clark to what was already the NBA's
deepest roster.</TE>
<TE>   So when injuries hit both teams, only one suffered dramatically.
Without O'Neal, the Lakers started 3-9 and haven't dug their way out
of that hole yet. The Kings actually lost more games to injury. When
O'Neal returned, even counting Fox's six-game suspension, the Lakers'
top eight players had missed 22 games, whereas Sacramento's top eight
had missed 30.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, people have long known that the Lakers' greatness is
built on two superstars and, for what it was worth, the Kings owned
the edge in depth.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the Lakers were never stretched quite this thin
before, nor have the Kings ever looked as deep.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone Knows</TE>
<TE>   the Trouble They Seen</TE>
<TE>   Not that losing is ever fun for anyone involved on any level but
there are bad losses, worse ones and unforgettable ones.</TE>
<TE>   Of the Lakers' nine titles in Los Angeles, six would follow their
most ignominious moment, the '84 NBA Finals against the Boston
Celtics, who had always owned them and made it 7-0 with that one,
after the Lakers had led each of the first four games going into the
last minute of play.</TE>
<TE>   That was the series when Gerald Henderson intercepted James
Worthy's pass in the backcourt, when Magic Johnson dribbled out the
24-second clock with a game on the line, when Kevin McHale pulled
Kurt Rambis down and turned the series into a gang fight, which the
Lakers lost, wilting in a sweltering Game 7 in Boston Garden.</TE>
<TE>   For the Kings, or at least for their fans, last spring was that
bad ... or worse.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles and Boston are both big cities with no particular
resentments vis-a-vis each other, unless one of their teams is
playing the other's.</TE>
<TE>   For Sacramento, however, Los Angeles is another world, which the
Sacramento crowd may admire or even envy, but certainly dislikes.</TE>
<TE>   Bigger cities mean big concentrations of media that never seem to
tire of pumping themselves up, often at the expense of someplace
smaller. If you want to know what people in Sacramento think when
they hear "Los Angeles," it's like what Angelenos think when they
hear "New York."</TE>
<TE>   Thus, Phil Jackson's barbarian jibes resonated like a bass line in
O'Neal's Escalade SUV, even if Jackson was joking, sort of. In reply,
King fans started the cowbell movement, ringing everything short of
the Liberty Bell in Jackson's ears, which was also a joke, an attempt
to deafen him, or both.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' distaste for Sacramento was at least matched by the
Kings' distaste for playing here, whether at Staples Center or the
Forum. They could have played outdoors at Venice Beach and it would
have been the same.</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds, who also took his lumps as general manager, coach and
assistant, said he could feel the disdain from the moment they got
off the bus, from the Lakers, their fans, the ushers and the
concessionaires. Reynolds once said he hated the entire metropolitan
area so much, he even disliked flying over it.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were usually in the midst of one dynasty or another.
The Kings were usually rebuilding, although for many years, nothing
ever seemed to work, as when they hired former Celtic great Bill
Russell, whose name was said to be "synonymous with winning," as
coach. He lasted 58 games, of which he lost 41.</TE>
<TE>   The most memorable game was at the Forum, where Russell had played
his last game, the Celtics' Game 7 upset in the '69 NBA Finals, when
Jack Kent Cooke penned those balloons up in the ceiling. On this
night as Kings' coach, Russell let the Lakers score 23 consecutive
points, refusing to call a timeout.</TE>
<TE>   "We kept saying, 'We need a timeout, we need a timeout,' " says
Reynolds, who was one of Russell's assistants. "Bill wouldn't do
it.... Then afterward, he said, 'I felt if I had called a timeout, it
would have helped the Lakers more than it would have us.'</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, we were figuring, now, 23 straight, I don't know what
we were risking here.</TE>
<TE>   "Willis [Reed, the other assistant] and I were kinda stunned. It's
not like we were gonna win the ballgame. I mean, they were a better
team than us. I think Russ, probably like any of us trying to put a
spin on it -- I mean, I think he just really got mad at the players
and that was the end of it."</TE>
<TE>   Barbarians</TE>
<TE>   at Staples Gates</TE>
<TE>   For many years, it was almost that bad.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings were better in the '90s, even making the playoffs twice,
even if that didn't seem to change their image, externally or within.
Once, when they sought financial help, a well-intentioned Mitch
Richmond told the city council, "If we lose the Kings, the city goes
back to what it's always been, a dead city."</TE>
<TE>   The '90s ended with a thud with the team diving, Richmond
demanding a trade, and attendance, which had run at 100% of capacity
since they'd moved into Arco Arena, falling 33% in a season, starting
yet another rebuilding program ... which worked.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, General Manager Geoff Petrie signed Vlade Divac, traded
Richmond for Chris Webber and drafted Jason Williams.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Petrie signed Bobby Jackson and, with the 16th pick in a
weak draft, selected Hedo Turkoglu.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Petrie traded the thorny Williams for Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   In 2002, when little help seemed available and other teams dumped
players ahead of the luxury tax, Petrie was allowed to give Clark
$4.5 million, running their payroll to $69.8 million -- $6.2 million
higher than the Lakers'.</TE>
<TE>   With Williams, Divac and Webber, all slick passers, they were a
highlight reel. Last season, with Bibby breaking out, going from 14
points a game during the season to 20 in the playoffs, they had the
cool-handed leader they needed to take the last step.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they tripped, or were tripped.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings fought the Lakers on even terms in the West finals,
dominating Games 2, 3 and 4. The Lakers stole Game 4 back, eked out
wins in Games 6 and 7 and left laughing, while the Kings' dreams
turned to ashes, as usual.</TE>
<TE>   Can you spell l-o-n-g o-f-f s-e-a-s-o-n?</TE>
<TE>   Now, they meet again, but it's a new season with new realities,
like the rise of the Dallas Mavericks, and four months left before
the playoffs for more surprises, of which the Lakers have already had
enough.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's anything our team has learned through our start this
year," Adelman says, "it's that every year is going to be
different....</TE>
<TE>   "I keep telling 'em, 'Forget about the Lakers.' I mean, really.
We'll play 'em four times. If we get that opportunity again in the
playoffs, then it's going to crank it up a whole lot. But until that
happens, we've got to get ourselves in a position to be there.</TE>
<TE>   "I've said all along, the Lakers, that's the bar you measure all
the teams by, at least before the season started and before Shaq's
injury. But there are the Dallases and the San Antonios and teams
like that who are going to be there too. I didn't want us to be all
concerned with [the Lakers]....</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of those things that amazes me when I keep hearing
people talk about us, [saying] we're whining about that series.... I
haven't said anything about that series since the week after it was
over, and I was pretty emotional then. But since then, I haven't said
anything. It's just been stuff that's kinda been rewritten,
rewritten, rewritten.</TE>
<TE>   "And, of course, people are going to ask them about it, ask us
about it. But [the Lakers] are finding out, it's a different season
this year too. Until we get there, I think our guys are taking the
approach, we want to be there again."</TE>
<TE>   So the Kings aren't concerned. Of course, everyone else in
Sacramento is extremely concerned.</TE>
<TE>   Webber said people were making plans to gather around their TVs to
watch this one as if it were the Super Bowl. And, as long as they're
together, they can celebrate that holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Monday, the Sacramento Bee ran a picture of a fan named Barbara
Rust, who was wearing a Santa cap and holding up a sign that said,
"All We Want for Christmas is to Beat L.A."</TE>
<TE>   They've been disappointed before, actually about 100% of the time.
It's just that it may not be "before" anymore.</TE>

<LD>It seemed like a bigger deal two months ago, back when the Lakers
accepted the rings they'd won at the expense of the Sacramento Kings,
when Shaquille O'Neal called them Queens, when Rick Fox and Doug
Christie had it out in front of everybody and ABC all but fainted at
its beginner's luck.</LD>
<LD>   Well, it is Christmas Day, just as promised, and the Kings will
play the Lakers at Staples Center on national television.</LD>
<LD>   They are still the Western Conference finalists, the Kings and
Lakers, still the glamour teams, still Shaq and Kobe and Phil and
all.</LD>
<TE>   But, well, you know.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven and 18. Sagging shoulders. Chins on chests.
Twenty-five-point losses and overtime wins.</TE>
<TE>   The finger-pointing, teammate-dogging, defense-dissin', and,
somewhere in there, three-time defending champion Lakers against the
Kings, quiet, dignified and 22-8, just where they thought they'd be,
atop the Pacific Division and rolling along toward the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   So, who are the Queens now?</TE>
<TE>   "So what?" Shaquille O'Neal said Tuesday afternoon while teammates
lugged paper bags lumpy with gifts away from the practice gym. "Right
now, yes, they are one of the best teams in the West. Yeah, I did a
lot of talking. I stand by what I say.... I said some things, but so
what?"</TE>
<TE>   He drove off in his Christmas-red Hummer. He said he'd spend today
doing, "Nothing. Being a daddy. Then, come to work." The Lakers have
so much to do. If they started winning today, and did not lose, they
wouldn't be a .500 team until Jan. 10. To match the Kings' 22 wins,
they'd have to win every game until Jan. 20. Of course, by then, the
Kings would be gone.</TE>
<TE>   From here, the schedule gets airy and the travel lightens, leaving
the Lakers with just their game to think about, their jump shots and
their transition defense and their effort, and burning through the
complacency Robert Horry talks about.</TE>
<TE>   They passed concern a while back, landed hard at
can-you-believe-this-stuff. They've tried more practices and team
meetings and awkward stabs at leadership, and none of it changed the
fact that this morning, the one thing that won't be under any of
their trees is a clear conscience. They've all had their moments of
poor play or poor choice, so they arrive two months into their
season, neither coming nor going.</TE>
<TE>   "Treading water," Laker Coach Phil Jackson called it this weekend,
and so far allowing the undertow to carry them.</TE>
<TE>   Every start has been a false one. The easy win against the
Clippers in the third game of the season. O'Neal's return in the 13th
game. The 30-point comeback against Dallas in the 21st. And, nothing.
They're trying to win a fourth consecutive championship on three or
four quarters a week. On the next guy's defense. On somebody else's
hustle.</TE>
<TE>   Along come the Kings, and the Lakers still have no answers.</TE>
<TE>   "I look forward to the day my team gets on track," O'Neal said. "I
think it's more mental than physical. If the guys think about it
tonight, guys know what they have to do. They have to go out and do
it."</TE>
<TE>   It was going to be the biggest regular-season game of the year.
Huge audience. Laker girls in red velvet. Christie and Fox, together
again. June 2, Game 7, overtime, Arco Arena, replayed, for an idea of
who's bolder and who's slipped and can the Lakers be stopped.</TE>
<TE>   And, yet, for the Lakers, it's become so much bigger. While O'Neal
said he didn't doubt the Lakers' ability to rise to the challenge of
good teams, they are 4-13 against teams with winning records.</TE>
<TE>   "Every game is crucial," guard Kobe Bryant said, "for trying to
get out of this hole. It doesn't matter who we're playing."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings might as well be the Clippers. Of course, for 20 years,
they were. Now, they must suspect it is their time, given their
experience of the last postseason -- taking the Lakers to seven games
and then losing, in their opinion, on a series of referees' calls
that went against them -- and the clear vulnerability of the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "Our focus has turned away from one game changing the momentum of
the season," Fox said. "Right now we need to win a lot of games. So,
it's going to take more than one game to turn it around."</TE>
<TE>   So, they'll play the game, even if it's not the one everyone
expected.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot more at stake than they do," Horry said.
"Hopefully, that'll get us out of our funk.</TE>
<TE>   "If this doesn't spark us, then something's wrong."</TE>

<HD>Team to Break Out White Uniforms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers will wear white uniforms today and continue the look on
every home Sunday game for the rest of the season.</LD>
<LD>   The uniform was born in the Laker front office three years ago,
died briefly when the NBA insisted the Lakers drop their home gold
uniforms permanently, and was revived recently when the league
relented. The stipulation is that the team must wear the special
uniforms at least 12 times during the season.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been planning a white Christmas," said Tim Harris, the
organization's senior vice president, business operations. "We think
the fans will love it. It's a very clean look."</LD>
<TE>   The process of adding a white uniform to the Lakers' signature
home yellow and road purple began with conversations between owner
Jerry Buss and former vice president Jerry West. The club liked last
year's response to its light blue uniforms, worn to honor the
Minneapolis Laker teams.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very conservative," executive vice president Jeanie Buss
said Tuesday. "We talked about it for a long time before the decision
was made. This is all about the fans. If there's a rebellion and the
fans don't like it, we'll rethink it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A big holiday season for Shaquille O'Neal: He'll be married
Thursday at a secret Los Angeles-area site.... Devean George, who sat
out Sunday's game at Toronto because of a sprained right ankle,
practiced Tuesday. Phil Jackson said he expected him to play
today.... Among those spotted amid the Oct. 25 fracas between
Sacramento's Doug Christie and the Lakers' Rick Fox was Christie's
wife, Jackie. Fox said he has since armed his own wife, Vanessa
Williams. "I bought her a big, big, big Roots purse for Christmas.
Just in case," he said, laughing.... Kobe Bryant said his various
ailments -- knee, elbow, etc. -- are better, but there's no stopping
the daily grind on his body. "Once the season kicks off," he said,
"it's downhill from there."</TE>

Kings' injured list. Mike Bibby, who missed the first 27 games
because of surgery on his right foot, is not. He returned Dec. 19 and
has averaged 16.3 points and 5.7 assists in 28.3 minutes. In 26 games
as a starter, in place of Bibby, Bobby Jackson averaged 20.2 points.
He had a career-high 31 points a month ago against the Clippers.</TE>

<HD>It's Still Yankees' World After All</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We should have known.</LD>
<LD>   We should have known that when George Steinbrenner threatened to
sue baseball over the financial burden the new collective bargaining
agreement put on his New York Yankees, it didn't mean he was sealing
the door to his Bronx vault.</LD>
<LD>   We should have known that when General Manager Brian Cashman
insisted at the GM meetings that the screw had been turned and he was
being forced to dump payroll, it didn't mean the Yankees were truly
withdrawing from the market -- domestic or otherwise.</LD>
<TE>   We should have known that when it came time to sign the premier
international players, the Yankees, with their unrivaled resources,
would continue their domination of that sphere and leave the
accounting for later.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of us simply can't shop where the Yankees shop," Ned
Colletti, the assistant general manager of the San Francisco Giants,
said Tuesday, referring to a holiday spree during which the Yankees
first signed Japanese outfielder Hideki Matsui for $21 million over
three years, then blew out the Boston Red Sox on Christmas Eve by
signing pitcher Jose Contreras, the Cuban defector, for $32 million
over four years.</TE>
<TE>   "The Yankees," Colletti continued, "shop on Rodeo Drive. Most all
the rest of us shop in a strip mall.</TE>
<TE>   "They simply have more resources than anyone and continue to
stockpile talent -- domestically and internationally. They've changed
the way we all scout and develop."</TE>
<TE>   Colletti meant that the Yankees had expanded the scouting
frontiers.</TE>
<TE>   It's just that few clubs have the resources to outbid the Yankees
for the premier talent.</TE>
<TE>   Nor do many have the Yankees' reputation.</TE>
<TE>   In shattering the record for a Cuban defector -- set by Danys Baez
with his four-year, $14.5-million signing by the Cleveland Indians in
1999 -- Contreras actually said he sacrificed money to join the
acclaimed Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   "Jose Contreras is most certainly the premier amateur pitcher in
the world and may be the best ever in amateur play," said Gordon
Blakely, the Yankees' international scouting director.</TE>
<TE>   "He has an exceptional fastball and breaking ball, plus a
championship makeup."</TE>
<TE>   At an alleged 31, Contreras' age may be open to debate, but few in
the industry question his credentials. The Yankees claim he had a
117-50 record in seven years with the Cuban national team before
defecting in Mexico City on Oct. 1. He recently established residence
in Nicaragua so that he could be pursued as a free agent, rather than
subjected to the June draft as a resident of the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein traveled to Managua in an
effort to outbid the Yankees, and the Dodgers dispatched scouts Rene
Francisco and Don Welke, but more in the capacity of spectators.</TE>
<TE>   "We were merely in the country, not in the middle of the bidding,"
General Manager Dan Evans said. "We were very aware of Contreras and
think he can be an exceptional major league pitcher, but we never
made an offer, once we heard they were talking about four years and
$7 or $8 million a year. The Yankees got their own gig to run, and
I'm not going to talk about that, but [the Yankee offer to Contreras]
would have put us over the [payroll tax threshold] and there's no way
we're going there."</TE>
<TE>   In the Yankees' gig, Contreras isn't the end of it. They are close
to re-signing Roger Clemens, who would become their eighth starting
pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   Colletti said, "Maybe they're planning to start a different
pitcher each day of the week."</TE>
<TE>   Clemens and Contreras will join starting pitchers Mike Mussina,
Andy Pettitte, David Wells, Jeff Weaver, Orlando Hernandez and
Sterling Hitchcock.</TE>
<TE>   Presumably, they are no longer in the market for Bartolo Colon,
but can we be sure?</TE>
<TE>   Since the end of the season, they have allowed relievers Mike
Stanton and Ramiro Mendoza to leave and re-signed third baseman Robin
Ventura at a $2.5-million cut in salary, but all the talk about a
major payroll reduction under the new labor agreement has translated
to a lot of lip service.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't, the right word is, we wouldn't sacrifice the
opportunities to sign these talents on the basis of reducing payroll
first," Cashman said, referring to the signings of Matsui and
Contreras. "The mind-set is still for me to reduce payroll. We just
need time to shake things out between now and spring training. Time
will tell. We certainly have an abundance of depth, and I would call
it quality depth. That's a position of strength."</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees have been trying to move Hitchcock and outfielders
Rondell White and Raul Mondesi, but there have been no takers.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, add Contreras and Matsui to the list of foreign-born
players the Yankees have signed, which also includes Alfonso Soriano,
Orlando Hernandez, Hideki Irabu, Jackson Melian, Ricardo Aramboles,
Andy Morales, Adrian Hernandez and Wily Mo Pena. Some worked out,
some failed, some were used in beneficial trades. All were expensive
signings, underscoring the image that the Yankees are hard to compete
with on the international scene.</TE>
<TE>   There is still the possibility that a worldwide draft will level
that playing field some. Still, a draft committee that was expected
to pursue the concept when there wasn't time to work out details
before the signing of the labor agreement remains inactive, long past
Oct. 15, when management and the union had agreed to begin
discussions.</TE>
<TE>   So, the Yankees, with all their riches, have only their own
payroll conscience to restrict them, and we see again with Hideki
Matsui and Jose Contreras what that's worth.</TE>
<TE>   We should have known.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Arms Buildup</TE>
<TE>   With the signing of pitcher Jose Contreras on Tuesday (four years
at $32 million), the New York Yankees have seven starting pitchers
under contract. And they anticipate that by the Jan. 8 deadline they
will re-sign Roger Clemens to a one-year contract worth $8 million to
$10 million. A look at the 2002 salaries of the other six starters:</TE>
<TE>   Orlando Hernandez...$3.2 million</TE>
<TE>   Sterling Hitchcock...$4.9 million</TE>
<TE>   Mike Mussina...$11 million</TE>
<TE>   Andy Pettitte...$9.5 million</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>European Ryder Cup officials will seek $1.6 million from the PGA of
America to help offset the cost of increased security at the event.</LD>
<LD>   The request comes because of the higher cost of staging the Ryder
Cup at the Belfry in September, The Scotsman newspaper reported
Tuesday from Edinburgh. The matches were postponed one year because
of the 2001 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The Europeans spent $4.4 million on security, substantially more
than the anticipated $800,000.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, Europe's anticipated profit from the showcase event,
won by the Europeans, 15 1/2-12 1/2, will be lower than expected. The
final total has not been released.</TE>
<TE>   The Europeans raised the idea of financial assistance at the
Masters this year and are expected to discuss the issue during the
international golf trade show in Florida next month, according to The
Scotsman.</TE>

<TE>   Colorado running back Chris Brown, the nation's third-leading
rusher despite sitting out the final two games of the regular season
because of a bruised sternum, will play in Saturday's Alamo Bowl at
San Antonio against Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   Brown has been limited to non-contract drills since returning to
practice on Thursday. He's expected to participate in full drills
later this week, Coach Gary Barnett said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, the Big 12 Conference's offensive player of the year,
rushed for 1,744 yards and 18 touchdowns this season. He finished
third in the nation in both rushing yardage and average yards per
game with 158.6, although he sat out Colorado's win over Nebraska on
Nov. 29 and the Big 12 championship game against Oklahoma on Dec. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Brown's return is especially significant because backup tailback
Bobby Purify will miss the Alamo Bowl because of a high ankle sprain.
Purify, who rushed for 739 yards and three touchdowns this season,
was injured during Colorado's win at Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   Two Colorado football players were arrested early Tuesday for
public intoxication in San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Senior linebacker Drew Wahlroos, an honorable mention All-Big 12
selection, and freshman defensive tackle Will Down were both charged,
the magistrate's office said. Down, 18, also was charged with failure
to identify himself to police.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett said he has not decided whether to take disciplinary
action.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed that our guys didn't show more self-control and
more discipline," Barnett said after the Buffaloes' practice session.
"Things like this -- these matters -- are generally best handled
internally, and this one will be handled that way."</TE>
<TE>   Wahlroos, 22, is third on the team in tackles with 85. Down did
not play for Colorado during the regular season and is inactive for
the Alamo Bowl because of a back injury.</TE>
<TE>   Both players were ordered to appear in court Jan. 7. The
magistrate's office would not say where the men were arrested. The
team is staying in a downtown San Antonio hotel.</TE>

<TE>   The New York Knicks will retire Patrick Ewing's jersey on Feb. 28,
making him the ninth person in franchise history to receive the
honor.</TE>
<TE>   Ewing's No. 33 will be raised to the Madison Square Garden rafters
alongside the jersey numbers of Walt Frazier (10), Dick Barnett (12),
Earl Monroe  and Dick McGuire (both 15), Willis Reed (19), Dave
DeBusschere (22) and Bill Bradley (24). Red Holzman also has a
retired number -- 613, for his victory total as the Knicks' coach.</TE>
<TE>   Ewing, the team's career leader in scoring and rebounding, retired
as a player in September and became an assistant coach for the
Washington Wizards.</TE>
<TE>   Ewing, the No. 1 overall pick in the 1985 draft, was an 11-time
All-Star who was named one of the NBA's 50 greatest players in 1996.
The 7-foot center led the Knicks to the NBA Finals in 1994, but never
won a championship during a 17-year career that ended with one-year
stints in Seattle and Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   Ewing averaged 21 points, 9.8 rebounds and 2.45 blocks in his
career and finished with 24,815 points and 11,607 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   The Atlanta Hawks signed guard Mike Wilks, who has been playing
with Huntsville of the National Basketball Development League, to
fill the roster spot left by Emanual Davis, who went on the injured
list Monday because of a torn right Achilles' tendon.</TE>
<TE>   Pro Hockey</TE>
<TE>   Dallas Star center Mike Modano, who sat out three games after
sustaining a concussion on a hit by Philadelphia's Jeremy Roenick,
will return for Thursday's game against Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   The team said the 32-year-old Modano, who leads the Stars in
scoring with 13 goals and 22 assists, was cleared by doctors six days
after he suffered his fourth concussion in nine seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Roenick was suspended two games by the league for hitting Modano
from behind.</TE>

<TE>   Richie Regan, who spent nearly half a century at Seton Hall as a
basketball player, coach, athletic director and fund-raiser, died
Tuesday. He was 72. Regan died in Neptune, N.J., where he had been
hospitalized since Dec. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Regan played at Seton Hall and was a first-round NBA draft pick
who had a three-year career with the Rochester and Cincinnati Royals.
He began a 10-season tenure as coach at Seton Hall in 1960 and was
the school's athletic director from 1971-85.</TE>

<HD>Chargers May Get Trigger Date Delay</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A task force assigned by City Hall to find ways to keep the Chargers
from leaving San Diego is recommending that the city council approve
the team's request to delay the "trigger" date for renegotiating the
Qualcomm Stadium lease.</LD>
<LD>   The council is set to discuss the issue in early January.</LD>
<LD>   The Chargers have asked that the trigger date be shifted from Dec.
1 to March 1. Members of the Citizens Task Force on Chargers Issues
voted, 14-1, Monday night to back the request because it will allow
the task force to finish its work.</LD>
<TE>   Under the Chargers' lease, the trigger -- which the team hasn't
activated yet -- opens a 60-day period when the team can notify the
city that it has met certain salary conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Once that occurs, the city has 90 days to renegotiate. If no
settlement is reached, the team then has 18 months to field offers
from other cities, although the city retains the right to match any
offer.</TE>
<TE>   Amid controversy about a ticket-guarantee plan that has cost
taxpayers more than $20 million, relations between the Chargers and
City Hall have soured. The council voted, 5-4, to reject a Charger
request for discussions about the team's future.</TE>

<TE>   Oakland Raider cornerback Charles Woodson had surgery Tuesday to
repair his fractured right fibula and will miss the regular-season
finale against Kansas City. Woodson also could sit out the first two
weeks of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Raider kicker Sebastian Janikowski pleaded no contest to a
misdemeanor charge of drunken driving. Janikowski will be put on
three years' probation. He also was fined $1,292 and ordered to
perform community service and enroll in a driving under the influence
school.</TE>

<TE>   Two days after sustaining the fifth concussion of his career,
Chicago quarterback Chris Chandler took most of the snaps at
practice. But Coach Dick Jauron said he still plans to wait until
later in the week to decide whether Chandler will start Sunday
night's season finale against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.... Tampa Bay
Coach Jon Gruden said he hasn't decided who will start at quarterback
in the Buccaneers' regular-season finale if Brad Johnson is unable to
play because of a severe lower back bruise. Shaun King struggled in
Monday night's 17-7 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers and was replaced
in the second half by Rob Johnson.... Minnesota Coach Mike Tice will
return to the Vikings next year, although the team missed the
playoffs this season. Owner Red McCombs told the Minneapolis Star
Tribune that Tice would return for the second year of his three-year
contract.... The New England Patriots put tight end Daniel Graham,
their first-round draft pick, on injured reserve because of injured
ribs.</TE>

<DH>Jake Porter touched hearts nationwide when he scored in a
high school game in Ohio</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Dwyre</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In many ways, it has been just another football season.</LD>
<LD>   There have been good plays and bad, good teams and bad. There have
been moments to cheer. Then there was the moment when a pro player
took a pen out of his sock and signed a football in the end zone.</LD>
<LD>   The game is designed to trigger our emotions, and it seldom fails.</LD>
<TE>   That's why the Jake Porter moment made such an impression. If we
have ever seen one like it, it has been buried, long since, under a
pileup of cynicism.</TE>
<TE>   What happened to Porter was a Hallmark moment. He didn't win the
Heisman but he won our hearts.</TE>
<TE>   What happened that Friday evening, Oct. 18, in a small town in
southern Ohio continues today, an emotional, inspirational snowball,
rolling downhill with no bottom in sight.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, Toledo will play Boston College in the Motor City Bowl
at Detroit. ESPN will televise the game. At halftime, the public
address announcer will call attention to a group of young men on the
field, high school football teams from McDermott and Waverly, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Leading them will be their coaches, Dave Frantz of McDermott
Northwest and Derek DeWitt of Waverly. Just before they are asked to
step forward for a presentation, along with a wiry 17-year-old, a
film clip will be shown on the stadium's big screen. In it, the wiry
17-year-old, Jake Porter, will run for the most important touchdown
of the season.</TE>
<TE>   To some, it will be a familiar story. For many more, the story
will be new. Old or new, though, it deserves to be told, and retold.
The Jake Porter story, after all, is a perfect gift in a season of
giving.</TE>
<TE>   The Master Plan</TE>
<TE>   Dave Frantz, in the ninth week of a losing season, was remembering
something he had done for one of his players two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Jake Porter is developmentally delayed, suffering from a form of
mental retardation called fragile X syndrome. Jake, though, had come
to every practice and suited up for every game since his freshman
year. His disability hadn't stopped him from becoming a favorite at
little Northwest High, enrollment 575. His freshman year, the senior
homecoming queen had picked him as her escort.</TE>
<TE>   But Jake, a senior, had played only once in a real game, two years
earlier, against Waverly, the team Northwest was about to play. That
time, Frantz had gone to Ed Bolin, Waverly's coach at the time, and
Bolin had agreed to let Jake take a handoff and kneel down late in
the game, when the outcome was determined. That way, the young man
would get to play, even carry the ball, but would not be in danger of
injury.</TE>
<TE>   Frantz knew his team didn't stand much of a chance against
Waverly, which was headed for Ohio's Division 4 playoffs. What he
didn't know was how Waverly's new coach, a large and intimidating
former college player named Derek DeWitt, would react to the idea of
letting Jake take a knee.</TE>
<TE>   Frantz and DeWitt met Saturday, Oct. 12, to exchange game films.
Frantz liked DeWitt immediately and felt comfortable enough to broach
the question.</TE>
<TE>   DeWitt was not unsympathetic, but it occurred to him that this
might be some sort of psychological ploy. This was a new area to him,
new people, new places, possibly new ways. At 32, he was a big-city
guy from Los Angeles, a former star defensive lineman and 1988
graduate of Pomona Ganesha High. He had played a year for Eddie
Robinson at Grambling and was a starter at Ohio University when
doctors discovered, in checking a neck injury, that he had a serious
narrowing of the spine, which, had he kept playing, could have
resulted in paralysis.</TE>
<TE>   His wife's family is from southern Ohio, so DeWitt eventually took
the Waverly job and was well into making his mark on the area
football scene when Frantz made his proposal. At the time, it made
little dent on DeWitt's consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   "I went back and studied the film and never gave it another
thought," DeWitt said.</TE>
<TE>   Waverly team's arrived earlier than normal before the game against
Northwest, the last home game for seniors such as Porter. That gave
DeWitt a chance to seek out Frantz for last-minute game details. In
the midst of the conversation, Jake Porter, the player Frantz calls
"my shadow," walked up, still in street clothes. DeWitt was
introduced, and talked to Porter for a while.</TE>
<TE>   When Porter left, DeWitt looked at Frantz and said, "Now I see."</TE>
<TE>   At halftime, Waverly led Northwest, 28-0. On the way to the locker
rooms, the coaches walked together and Frantz reminded DeWitt of his
wishes for Jake to take a knee.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's get it done," DeWitt responded.</TE>
<TE>   The Midfield Meeting</TE>
<TE>   There were five seconds left and Northwest had the ball
on Waverly's 49-yard line when Frantz called a timeout. His team
trailed, 42-0, on its way to completing a 3-7 season. But for
achieving what he wanted for Jake Porter, the situation was perfect.</TE>
<TE>   The referee, Bernie Hensley, had been clued in and the Northwest
team had practiced for Jake to take a knee, but it was still a touchy
situation. Frantz and Hensley met in the middle of the field and
DeWitt joined them. Hensley said his officials were ready. Frantz had
reminded his players of what they had practiced, DeWitt had told his
to just kind of lay off, that a kid on the other team would take a
knee.</TE>
<TE>   The timeout ended and the coaches headed to their sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Halfway there, DeWitt was hit by something he later described as a
"bolt out of nowhere."</TE>
<TE>   "God used me as a tool," he says now.</TE>
<TE>   DeWitt turned to Hensley, called another timeout and motioned for
Frantz to rejoin them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not good enough," he told Hensley and Frantz. "Just having
him touch the ball, that's not good enough."</TE>
<TE>   In the stands, people were wondering what was going on. From a
distance, it looked as if a fight might break out between the
coaches.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Frantz said no.</TE>
<TE>   "I was dumbfounded," he said. "I wondered about the integrity
of the game, if this was the right thing to do, so I said, 'Let's just
go with him taking the knee.' "</TE>
<TE>   To which DeWitt responded, loudly, "No, no. no. That's not
enough."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Hensley stepped in and nudged Frantz.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to let him score, Coach," he said. "Let's let him."</TE>
<TE>   So it was decided that Jake Porter would make a little history.</TE>
<TE>   Frantz told his disbelieving team that Jake was not simply
going to take a knee, but would run with the ball. No, they wouldn't have
to block for him. No, the other team wouldn't hit him. "Just trust
me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   DeWitt was direct with his team.</TE>
<TE>   "If any one of you even touches him, I'll kill you," he said,
explaining later, "By that time, there were a bunch of jayvees in the
game and half of them were looking off somewhere else while I was
talking and the other half were just dying to get in one good hit to
impress me. I needed to get their attention."</TE>
<TE>   The Play</TE>
<TE>   Liz Porter, the divorced mother of Jake and Seth, 13, was
working at the concession stand when she saw the coaches at midfield,
appearing to argue, and then watched her son go into the game. She
knew the plan was for Jake to just kneel down, but she got chills
anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Along the Waverly sideline, linesman Chuck Delawder was confused.
He had been told the Northwest player would be allowed to score, but
it didn't smell right. So he drifted among the Waverly players just
before the snap and whispered to them to be careful, to protect
themselves from unexpected hits.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a former defensive coordinator," Delawder said. "I was having
trouble with the concept of a coach giving up a shutout. Now, after
all that's happened, I'm ashamed I thought that way."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the ball was snapped to the quarterback, who handed it to
Jake Porter, who had practiced kneeling down all week and started to
do just that. But it turned out to be kind of a curtsy, as his
teammates, and the Waverly players, encouraged him to run.</TE>
<TE>   From his officiating vantage, Delawder saw the handoff and saw
Porter take the ball and kind of wipe his hand on his jersey while he
was deciding whether to take the knee or run.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of those things special kids do," Delawder said. "I
used to teach special education. When I saw that, then I understood."</TE>
<TE>   Emboldened by the encouragement of the 21 other players on the
field, Jake Porter started his touchdown jaunt. His mother watched in
horror.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he had screwed up the play," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Waverly team parted like the Red Sea, and Jake headed toward
the goal line. As he made his way into the Waverly secondary, both
teams started to follow, clapping. In the stands, where it all
started to make sense, parents and students clapped and cried. Liz
Porter sobbed.</TE>
<TE>   "I still cry today, every time I think about it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   From his position as back judge, Andy Compliment watched
everything roll toward him. It was his fourth game as a high school
official and he had made the officiating team that night only because
his brother, Tony, had been called in to work. But rookie or not, all
those times when officials get together and discuss "mechanics" had
not been wasted on him.</TE>
<TE>   Compliment sprinted to the goal line, so that the moment Jake
Porter, No. 45 for Northwest, crossed the line, Compliment was there
to throw his hands in the air, signaling touchdown. If there were any
questions whether this was real, it ended when Compliment's arms
lifted skyward.</TE>
<TE>   Once Liz Porter learned how all this had happened, she sought out
DeWitt.</TE>
<TE>   "I walked up to him and he is just this huge man and I was a
little afraid," she said, "but I told him I was Jake Porter's mom and
thanked him and he laughed a little bit and said I shouldn't be
thanking him, that he should be thanking us for letting him be part
of this.</TE>
<TE>   "I cried a little bit more and I think he did too."</TE>
<TE>   The Cub Reporter</TE>
<TE>   The local paper reported Jake Porter's touchdown as if it had been
a normal play in a normal game by a normal teenager: "Senior Jake
Porter scored on the final play of the game on a 49-yard run...."</TE>
<TE>   It was not until late the next week that the Huntington (W.Va.)
Herald-Dispatch, daily circulation 36,000 with a sports staff of six,
told the world about Jake's touchdown, under James Walker's byline.</TE>
<TE>   Walker, a 2001 graduate of Temple University's journalism school,
had interned at Atlanta and Philadelphia, but the job market for big
papers was tough. The Herald-Dispatch had hired him to cover area
high school sports.</TE>
<TE>   Walker hadn't covered the Northwest-Waverly game, though. Another
staff writer told him about Jake Porter. And even though McDermott,
Ohio, isn't in the Herald-Dispatch's prime circulation area, Walker
correctly decided that this story had no boundaries. So, a few phone
calls and interviews later, the news, although belated, was out.</TE>
<TE>   "I eventually went to McDermott and met all the people and
they were very special," said Walker, who described Porter as being "full
of energy."</TE>
<TE>   Quickly, the story moved, to major papers, to Internet sites, to
local television, to the networks, to the consciousness of many
sports fans.</TE>
<TE>   Walker said it was his most important story ever -- "ever" meaning
about a year -- and Liz Porter said that she was amazed when she met
Walker because he didn't look much older than Jake.</TE>
<TE>   The Aftermath</TE>
<TE>   There have been interviews, from Katie Couric to Jim Rome.</TE>
<TE>   Jake Porter, who will turn 18 Jan. 30, has become, in the words of
his mother, "more confident now, less hesitant to do things."</TE>
<TE>   Jake has also seen so many tape recorders and microphones in the
last two months that he asked for both for Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   There have even been calls from Hollywood, and Liz Porter, whose
other son, Seth, also has fragile X syndrome, has sought and received
help from the National Fragile X Foundation in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 8, Jake, Liz and Dave Frantz were invited to the Waverly
football banquet, where the team gave out its awards. One special one
went to Jake Porter of Northwest, who received a Waverly T-shirt,
signed by all the members of Waverly's team. On the back: PORTER 45.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody from Waverly wanted to talk to Jake," Liz said. "It was
like family."</TE>
<TE>   There was another awards event recently in Cleveland, and when a
woman named Sheila Friedman heard the Jake Porter story, she called
her friend Ken Hoffman, the executive director of the Motor City Bowl
in Detroit, and insisted that a story so close to this bowl should be
told at halftime. Hoffman scrambled to find a sponsor to pay for the
trip, and the joint Waverly-Northwest family will be together again,
a convoy of four busloads, heading north.</TE>
<TE>   Life, of course, goes on.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Frantz can have fun with the story and not offend
anybody. Seth Porter will be on the Northwest team next year. Frantz said
he may have Seth emulate his brother's taking a knee, "but this time
I'll do it when I'm only five points behind."</TE>
<TE>   In early December, Bolin, the coach who preceded DeWitt at Waverly
and was the first to let Jake take a knee as a sophomore, died. About
the same time, a Northwest girl, a 15-year-old volleyball and
basketball player, died in a car crash on one of the nearby country
roads. Just as the school had celebrated Jake, it mourned her loss.</TE>
<TE>   "Those things are hard on Jake," Liz Porter said. "He sees
everybody so sad, and his nature is to just take care of everybody,
make them all feel better."</TE>
<TE>   All along, there have been detractors, people writing to Walker's
newspaper or calling Rome's radio show to complain that the Jake
Porter story was much ado about nothing, and that in doing what he
did, the integrity of the game suffered.</TE>
<TE>   To that, DeWitt seemed to have the best answer, and Walker quoted
him in the Huntington newspaper Nov. 10:</TE>
<TE>   "No one will remember the score 10-20 years from now, but they
will remember what Jake Porter did."</TE>

<HD>Arena Picks 27 Players</HD>

<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman, defenders Danny Califf and Sasha
Victorine, and midfielder Pete Vagenas were among 27 players called
into camp by U.S. Coach Bruce Arena for the Americans' first game of
2003 -- against Canada on Jan. 18 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. roster features only Major League Soccer players and the
camp will be held in Bradenton, Fla., starting Jan. 4.</LD>
<LD>   The group features 15 players with three or fewer international
games on their resumes, including four who have never played for the
United States at full national team level: San Jose Earthquake
goalkeeper Joe Cannon, Columbus Crew defender Brian Dunseth, Kansas
City Wizard defender Nick Garcia and Dallas Burn defender Ryan
Suarez.</LD>
<TE>   In other early season games, the U.S. plays Argentina in Miami on
Feb. 8; Jamaica in Kingston, Jamaica, on Feb. 12 and Japan in Seattle
on March 29.</TE>
<TE>   Arena wants to use the camp to build fitness and form for those
matches.</TE>
<TE>   "Since most of these players have experienced a long layoff," he
said, "we will focus on improving their conditioning while continuing
to evaluate their potential to compete at the international level."</TE>
<TE>   The full roster:</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeepers: Cannon, Hartman, Tim Howard and Nick Rimando.</TE>
<TE>   Defenders: Califf, Victorine, Dunseth, Garcia, Suarez, Wade
Barrett, Carlos Bocanegra, Chad McCarty and Eddie Pope.</TE>
<TE>   Midfielders: Vagenas, DaMarcus Beasley, Bobby Convey, Chris Klein,
Kyle Martino, Pablo Mastroeni, Clint Mathis, Richard Mulrooney, Ben
Olsen and Steve Ralston.</TE>
<TE>   Forwards: Jeff Cunningham, Landon Donovan, Brian McBride and
Taylor Twellman.</TE>
<TE>   MLS Trade</TE>
<TE>   In a trade spurred as much by salary cap considerations as
anything else, D.C. United and the New York/New Jersey MetroStars
have significantly shuffled the MLS deck.</TE>
<TE>   Three-time champion D.C. United sent international veterans Jaime
Moreno, Pope and Richie Williams to the MetroStars in exchange for
defender Mike Petke, a first-round pick in the Jan. 17 draft and a
future player allocation.</TE>
<TE>   Moreno and Pope have spent their seven-year MLS careers with D.C.
United, while Williams was there for all but one of those years.</TE>
<TE>   The trio helped the team win the title in 1996, 1997 and 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "I think in some ways it marks the end of an era," said United
Coach Ray Hudson. "In some ways it's a sad day for the club, but
major changes needed to be implemented."</TE>

<KH>LAS VEGAS BOWL UCLA vs.  New Mexico</KH>
<HD>A Tale of Two Absent Coaches</HD>
<DH>When Bruins play in Las Vegas today, the recently fired
Toledo and recently hired Dorrell will watch from afar and with great
interest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>With apologies to Dickens, the Las Vegas Bowl will swirl with UCLA
spirits past, present and future.</LD>
<LD>   A victory would be a hearty welcome for a new boss and a gift of
holiday cheer to a despondent former one.</LD>
<LD>   Win or lose, a new chapter in UCLA football will be born and the
remnants of a bygone era will be buried.</LD>
<TE>   UCLA (7-5) and New Mexico (7-6) expect to draw only 18,000 at Sam
Boyd Stadium, but the presence of two television viewers who
represent yesterday and tomorrow will be felt.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Toledo, the coach for seven seasons before getting fired Dec.
9, will watch from his home in Westlake Village. The Bruins will be
coached by his staff and they will run his offense.</TE>
<TE>   His former team can pay him tribute by winning.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to do that for him," senior linebacker Marcus Reese
said. "He recruited all of us and coached us well."</TE>
<TE>   Karl Dorrell, hired Dec. 18 to lift UCLA to more prestigious
postseason games than this, will watch from his home in Englewood,
Colo. The Bruins belong to him beginning Thursday, and he will bring
in his own staff, and his own offense.</TE>
<TE>   His future team can pay him homage by winning.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows he will be watching," tailback Tyler Ebell said.
"One game doesn't dictate your career, but it would give all of us a
positive way to start off with the new coach."</TE>
<TE>   Along with the first impressions, there will be last hurrahs. It's
the final UCLA game for 13 seniors and probably the last for eight
assistant coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "We're waking up on Christmas Day and playing football," senior
tight end Mike Seidman said. "To me, that's fun. That should be a
celebration."</TE>
<TE>   Playing the unlikely role of Scrooge could be Rocky Long, the
plain-speaking, personable New Mexico coach of five seasons. His
Lobos are capable of an upset.</TE>
<TE>   The former UCLA defensive coordinator and close friend of Toledo
employs an unusual defense using five backs who line up 10 yards
behind the line of scrimmage until the quarterback begins calling
signals. Just before the snap one or more of the backs blitz or step
up and stuff the run.</TE>
<TE>   New Mexico's defense was among the top 20 in the nation in 2001
and 2000. This season, the Lobos have 120 tackles for loss.</TE>
<TE>   Long's offense is equally bizarre, though less effective. The
Lobos run everything from the fly series -- where a receiver goes in
motion and becomes a tailback -- to the archaic single wing. The
quarterback draw is a big part of the arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   So is a formation called the Daffy Duck -- the tackles and ends
split wide to each side and a flanker lines up behind them.
Quarterback Casey Kelly counts the defensive players who remain in
their normal positions and determines the play at the line of
scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   If defenders leave their posts and follow the tackles and ends, a
running play is called. If defenders stay put, Kelly throws to one of
the flankers.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason they do so much is to keep the defense on the drawing
board in the first quarter," Reese said. "But we've prepared for
every one of their formations."</TE>
<TE>   Although it's been a month since the Lobos last played and they
rank No. 100 in offense, Long claims no new tricks were added for
today.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we used the whole bag," he said. "We were having so much
trouble early in the season we brought out a million things just to
score a touchdown."</TE>
<TE>   New Mexico, undersized and barely over .500, is familiar with
getting no respect. But five victories in their last seven games gave
the Lobos second place in the Mountain West Conference.</TE>
<TE>   The Lobos have inspiration as well as momentum. Long regaled them
with the tale of Mountain West cohort Utah defeating USC in last
year's Las Vegas Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   So they believe they can win, despite making only their second
bowl appearance in 41 years. They played in the Insight.com bowl in
1997. They lost to Arizona, but just getting there was an achievement
of such magnitude that it launched Coach Dennis Franchione to three
lucrative jobs in the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   New Mexico's last postseason victory came in 1961 against Western
Michigan in the short-lived Aviation Bowl in a Dayton, Ohio,
snowstorm with 4,000 people in the stands.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's bowl tradition of late isn't much more impressive. The
Bruins spurned the Humanitarian Bowl last season, lost in the Sun
Bowl in 2000 and lost in the Rose Bowl in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   A victory today wouldn't exactly qualify as a return to glory, but
it would provide a springboard into the Dorrell era.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a win really sets up the off-season program," interim
Coach Ed Kezirian said. "It builds momentum and creates enthusiasm."</TE>
<TE>   Kezirian knows zeal. A former Bruin player and assistant who has
been an academic advisor the last 10 years, he is best known for
waving a white towel above his head during games to get players and
fans fired up.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll leave the towel in the locker room," he said. "I'll wear a
headset and manage the game."</TE>
<TE>   Offensive coordinator Kelly Skipper, who always deferred to Toledo
in the past, will call plays. Phil Snow, as usual, is in charge of
the defense.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Olson will play the first quarter at quarterback and Matt
Moore will play the second. Kezirian and quarterbacks coach John
Pearce will decide at halftime which of the two freshmen to go with
in the third quarter; the other will play the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "They are so even, they both deserve a chance to compete," Pearce
said. "They have bright futures here."</TE>
<TE>   So do the rest of the large number of freshmen, sophomores and
juniors who made a strong contribution this season. The game for them
is a bridge between eras, and when it is over their future lies with
Dorrell.</TE>
<TE>   The motivation is different for the seniors and assistant coaches.
Their UCLA careers end today, and their futures lie elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "We will approach the game like we did all season," Kezirian said.
"We're here for fun, but the fun is in winning. Then it's fun for all
of us."</TE>

<LD>LAS VEGAS BOWL</LD>
<LD>   UCLA (7-5) vs. New Mexico (7-6)</LD>
<LD>   Today, 1:30 p.m., Sam Boyd Stadium</LD>
<TE>   TV -- ESPN</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KXTA (1150), XTRA (690).</TE>
<TE>   WHEN UCLA HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins will try to establish the run against the Lobos' 3-3-5
defense with bruising Manuel White and elusive Tyler Ebell getting
the bulk of the carries. Expect tight end Mike Seidman to be put in
motion to create mismatches. Quarterbacks Drew Olson and Matt Moore,
who will share playing time equally, must recognize blitzes and
deliver passes quickly. The Bruins have been more effective in the
red zone since the freshman quarterbacks took over for the injured
Cory Paus, scoring on all 16 trips inside the 20-yard line the last
five games.</TE>
<TE>   WHEN NEW MEXICO HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Freshman tailback DonTrell Moore, who has rushed for 1,117 yards
and 13 touchdowns, is the centerpiece of the offense. Quarterback
Casey Kelly will carry the ball on draws and options, and his backup,
Justin Millea, is even more dangerous as a runner out of the single
wing formation. The Lobos employ a short, safe passing game. Kelly
has thrown for only 1,667 yards but has had only six passes
intercepted. Receivers Joe Manning, Dwight Counter and Adrian Boyd
each have about 30 catches and average about 11 yards a catch. UCLA
must be prepared for a variety of trick plays.</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO UCLA VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   1. Play with passion: Bob Toledo was fired as coach two days after
the last regular-season game. The uncertainty and turmoil cannot be
used as an excuse for a lackadaisical performance. From seniors
playing their last game to freshmen wanting to impress new Coach Karl
Dorrell, the Bruins must play as if this is the most important game
of the season.</TE>
<TE>   2. Take an early lead: UCLA has fallen behind in most of its
games, a trend that is not advisable today. Run-oriented New Mexico
is not equipped to come from behind but could be effective protecting
a second-half advantage.</TE>
<TE>   3. Recognize and adjust: New Mexico will try to compensate for a
size and speed disadvantage by employing blitz packages on defense
and trick plays and surprise formations on offense. The Bruins must
avoid confusion and play under control.</TE>

<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>New Mexico kicker Katie Hnida not only is the only woman playing
Division I-A football, she also is the lone Lobo with bowl
experience.</LD>
<LD>   Hnida was on the Colorado roster in 1999 when the Buffaloes played
in the Insight.com Bowl against Boston College. She didn't play in
that game and doesn't figure to play today either.</LD>
<LD>   But simply participating is good enough for now.</LD>
<TE>   "Sometimes I forget that I'm the only woman playing college
football right now," she said. "Just being out here, this is what I
do."</TE>
<TE>   Hnida (pronounced NY-duh) sat out the last two seasons, then sent
highlight tapes of her high school kicking to New Mexico and was
invited as a walk-on.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tyler Ebell is the most productive freshman tailback ever at UCLA.
But his numbers take a backseat to those of Lobo freshman DonTrell
Moore, who won the starting job after senior Quincy Wright was lost
to a season-ending knee injury in the fourth game.</TE>
<TE>   Moore has rushed for 1,117 yards and 13 touchdowns -- all in the
last 10 games. His four 100-yard performances have come in the last
six games.</TE>
<TE>   It's no surprise that Moore is effective. He was recruited by
Notre Dame, Oklahoma, Nebraska and Colorado, but chose to stay close
to his hometown of Roswell, N.M.</TE>
<TE>   He canceled an official visit to Notre Dame because of a snowstorm
in Albuquerque and never rescheduled.</TE>
<TE>   "I got snowed in and I thought it was a sign," he said. "I wanted
to stay closer to home and closer to my mom."</TE>
<TE>   Ebell does have an edge over Moore in one department -- fumbles.
The Bruin back has fumbled only once. Moore had seven fumbles
recovered by the opposition in a six-game span.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive end Dave Ball, who leads the Bruins with 10.5 sacks, is
questionable because of an infection in his leg. Ball needs three
sacks to break the school record of 13 set by Carnell Lake in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Harrison, a freshman running back and kick returner, is out
because of a knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unlike some schools, UCLA has always counted statistics from bowl
games in its record book. This year, the NCAA is doing so as well.</TE>
<TE>   Several Bruins can climb higher into the UCLA record book.</TE>
<TE>   * Ebell could vault to No. 3 in season all-purpose yards with a
strong performance. Ebell has 1,305 yards -- 924 rushing, 72
receiving, 266 on punt returns and 43 on kick returns.</TE>
<TE>   Ebell also can become the third freshman in Pacific 10 Conference
history to rush for 1,000 yards.</TE>
<TE>   * Junior receiver Tab Perry (1,279) is also ascending the
all-purpose yard list. He needs 23 kick return yards to break his own
school record of 598, set two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   * Sophomore receiver Craig Bragg has cracked top-10 lists with 51
catches and 851 yards receiving. He is eight catches and 138 yards
from ranking sixth in each category.</TE>
<TE>   * Senior cornerback Ricky Manning needs one interception to enter
a fourth-place tie on the career list at 14 with Eric Turner
(1987-90), Marcus Turner (1985-88) and Don Rogers (1980-83).</TE>
<TE>   * Linebacker Spencer Havner ranks third in tackles by a freshman
with 90. He should pass Kenny Easley (93) but cannot reach leader
James Washington, who had 119 tackles in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   * Senior Mike Seidman needs four receptions to eclipse the
single-season record for tight ends of 44 set by Paul Bergmann in
1983.</TE>
<TE>   * Senior punter Nate Fikse's career average of 42.71 ranks No. 2
behind Kirk Wilson (44.60) and ahead of Zenon Andrusyshyn (42.63).
Fikse holds career records of 259 punts and 11,061 yards, passing
Chris Sailer in both categories.</TE>

<KH>USC REPORT</KH>
<HD>Chow Declines Kentucky Offer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC received an early holiday gift on Tuesday when offensive
coordinator Norm Chow turned down an offer to become head coach at
Kentucky.</LD>
<LD>   Chow told Kentucky Athletic Director Mitch Barnhart that he would
remain at USC, where he helped Coach Pete Carroll revive the program
and tutored Carson Palmer to the Heisman Trophy.</LD>
<LD>   "It was flattering, and the people at Kentucky handled everything
in a first-class manner, but my family and I decided that USC was
where we wanted to be," Chow said by phone from his home in Provo,
Utah. "I want to keep working with Pete Carroll and help us win a
national championship."</LD>
<TE>   Chow, 56, was courted by Kentucky after Guy Morriss left to become
coach at Baylor. Kentucky finished 7-5 this season but was not
bowl-eligible because of NCAA sanctions. The Wildcats will be on
probation for two more seasons with scholarship reductions.</TE>
<TE>   Barnhart and other Kentucky representatives met with Chow in Los
Angeles on Dec. 15 and stayed in contact by phone over the last week.
Barnhart, who could not be reached for comment, had said that he
wanted to have a coach in place by today.</TE>
<TE>   Central Florida Coach Mike Kruczek, former Georgia coach Jim
Donnan and South Carolina defensive coordinator Charlie Strong
reportedly are the remaining candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll, who spoke to Barnhart on Chow's behalf, said he was
pleased that Chow decided to stay.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an excellent decision for us -- it keeps the continuity
going," Carroll said. "It's a substantial statement about our program
and Norm's role in it."</TE>
<TE>   Chow was an assistant at Brigham Young for 27 seasons and at North
Carolina State for one before he joined Carroll's new staff before
the 2001 season. Chow, who reportedly earns about $300,000, said USC
representatives had not spoken to him about upgrading his contract.
Carroll, however, indicated throughout the process that USC would
take steps to keep Chow happy.</TE>
<TE>   Chow was pursued by Utah, his alma mater, this month, but the
school hired Urban Meyer, who coached at Bowling Green and came at a
cheaper price.</TE>
<TE>   Chow said he still has the desire to be a head coach but is happy
to turn his undivided attention to preparing USC for its Jan. 2
Orange Bowl game against Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said the Trojans would benefit from the timing of Chow's
decision.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little boost going into the week because otherwise it
would have been a lot of distractions," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll, however, said he expects other schools to come calling on
Chow in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "He's qualified and prepared to be a head coach," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Oscar Lua had knee surgery to repair a torn anterior
cruciate ligament. He is not expected to be ready for spring
practice.... The Sporting News named Palmer its player of the
year.... The Trojans are off today and will leave for Miami on
Thursday.</TE>

<LD>With conference play starting this week there are questions,
questions ...</LD>
<LD>   Is the Pac-10 more competitive this season?</LD>
<LD>   Yes. Well, maybe. Eight of the 10 teams have winning or .500
nonconference records, Oregon and Washington State being the
exceptions. Thanks to beefed-up scheduling, the Pac-10 sits no worse
than sixth in the various power rankings.</LD>
<TE>   But the conference collectively is 5-12 against top-25 teams. USC,
playing the hardest schedule of any Pac-10 school, has four of those
losses.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not the teams have been toughened by these early
confrontations remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   Can Stanford run the table again without Nicole Powell?</TE>
<TE>   Definitely not. And it would be difficult even if Powell were
playing, instead of trying to recover from a bulging disk in her
lower back.</TE>
<TE>   But a third consecutive regular-season championship -- and 12th in
17 years -- is well within the range of the fifth-ranked Cardinal
(6-1), whose only loss is to Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   The starting sophomore quartet of Sebnem Kimyacioglu, Azella
Perryman, Kelley Suminski and T'Nae Thiel is averaging 45.2 points
and 24.6 rebounds, which makes up 66.9% of Stanford's scoring output
and 60.1% of the rebounding. Former Brea High standout Chelsa Trotter
is back after missing last season with knee problems, and gives Coach
Tara VanDerveer a solid post player off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Can Stanford win the postseason conference tournament this time?</TE>
<TE>   Yes. But so can Washington, Arizona, last year's winner Arizona
State, Oregon State and perhaps USC.</TE>
<TE>   Does that mean the Arizona schools are for real?</TE>
<TE>   Yes -- a guarded yes.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona (6-2) has a burgeoning force in 6-5 center Shawntinice
Polk. The redshirt freshman is averaging 19.5 points, 13.6 rebounds,
2.62 blocks and is shooting 59.6%. Polk's abilities are making
Dee-Dee Wheeler (14.1 points) and Krista Warren (13.3) that much more
dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   The Sun Devils were afterthoughts following season-ending injuries
to Betsy Boardman, their top returning scorer, and Alexis Tate. But a
not-that-taxing schedule has Arizona State a surprising 8-1. The only
defeat was by 12th-ranked Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Charli Turner Thorne is getting better than expected
production from freshmen Jill Noe (14.9), Kristen Kovesdy (11.6) and
Amy Denson (11.6).</TE>
<TE>   But there will be a better read on both Arizona schools after
their weekend visit to Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Where do USC and UCLA fit into the mix?</TE>
<TE>   Good question. If her first two games are an indication, Duke
transfer Rometra Craig could be the consistent scoring threat
alongside Ebony Hoffman the Trojans thought Aisha Hollans or Rachel
Woodward might be. If not, USC will struggle from game to game, as it
did in nonconference games.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA will be severely affected by Julia Pitts' season-ending knee
injury. The freshman was the team's best rebounder. The more teams
can keep the run-and-gun Bruins from turning games into
helter-skelter affairs, the easier it will be to control the talented
Michelle Greco (19.1).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sherri Murrell and Tammy Holder both knew they weren't stepping
into the best situations when they took the coaching jobs at
Washington State and Cal State Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   But that isn't making their first seasons any easier to take.</TE>
<TE>   Murrell had a 68-46 record in four seasons at Pacific. But the
Cougars are 0-8, and only one of the losses has been by fewer than 14
points.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a challenge, but [my staff and I] knew that coming in,"
Murrell said. "Sure, we wish some things were different; we've
struggled with some injuries. But we're not playing pushover teams,
and I do feel there has been progress, if not wins.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew the program would not be built in a day. Winning is a
habit and so is losing."</TE>
<TE>   Holder, who has been an assistant at Richmond and South Carolina
and a head coach in the defunct ABL and Division II South
Carolina-Spartanburg, has watched the Matadors limp out of the gate
0-9. And, like Washington State, Northridge is losing by lopsided
margins.</TE>
<TE>   Holder remains upbeat.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a great opportunity at Northridge," she said. "A good
opportunity because of the conference that it is in [the Big West],
but also because I like the fact that everyone I talked to on this
campus was positive and believed in this program and the potential
that it has."</TE>
