<HD>Trying Too Hard Is One Facet of 'Human Nature'</HD>

<LD>Titles like "Human Nature"--or "Happiness" or "Pleasantville" or even
"Parenthood"--are more or less guilty pleas in advance that what
you're going to get is Irony with a capital I, the name being merely
a mask for the unfettered, unadorned Truth that will be revealed once
the credits start to roll. It isn't exactly false advertising--we're
in on the joke from the start; we know about the malignant story
behind the benign title. What might be bogus is the claim that these
movies are comedies.</LD>
<LD>   "Human Nature" is not exactly "Being John Malkovich," the previous
film scripted by Charlie Kaufman and one whose concept was so
delightfully farfetched you hardly noticed there was so little going
on. "Human Nature" offers no such distractions. The point that humans
are, by their very nature, fonts of self-interest has been a basic
tenet of law, history and art since law, history and art began. And,
in most cases, has been a lot funnier than "Human Nature."</LD>
<LD>   One line contains the sum of the movie's message. It is spoken by
research scientist Nathan Bronfman (Tim Robbins), who is trying to
facilitate the assimilation of ape man Puff (Rhys Ifans) into the
modern world: "When in doubt, don't ever do what you really want to
do." It's funny, it's biting, it's wise. And it's a nugget of wisdom
we hardly needed "Human Nature" to impart.</LD>
<TE>   "Human Nature" is a goofball movie, in the way "Malkovich" was,
but it tries too hard. Director Michel Gondry, a well-respected
commercial director (most celebrated for several Levi's ads), seems
convinced that Kaufman is onto something, but his own directorial
choices are far more amusing than Kaufman's script. Having the
follicularly challenged Lila Jute (Patricia Arquette) photographed in
the faux-antique Kodachrome colors of an old Disney documentary while
crooning about the glories of being a hairy nature girl certainly
makes the scene. The iris-y flashbacks to Nathan's childhood, in
which his parents (Robert Forster and Mary Kay Place) lecture him
about the evils of natural life ("Never wallow in the filth of
instinct") are funny in and of themselves.</TE>
<TE>   But "Human Nature" is a rather sophomoric exercise in cynicism
written by a very successful writer of screenplays. How capital
I-ronic is that?</TE>

<HD>Casting Dark Shadows on His All-American Image</HD>
<DH>Movies* Bill Paxton sheds his regular-guy persona in the
thriller 'Frailty,' which the actor also directed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLEN BASKIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his various film roles, Bill Paxton often seems to be in over his
head, whether battling nature (and estranged wife Helen Hunt) in
"Twister" (1996), trying to untangle the complications of "A Simple
Plan" (1998) or bottoming out as a doomed submarine captain in 2000's
"U-571."</LD>
<LD>   Paxton is often cast as the average guy caught up in
larger-than-life circumstances beyond his control, and in "Frailty,"
which opens today, he ups the ante: In addition to starring in the
psychological thriller, Paxton directed the film. He's been making
short films since his high school days in Fort Worth, Texas, but
"Frailty" is Paxton's first time at the helm of a feature, and it's a
daunting project, a grisly Southern Gothic tale of murder, faith and
family ties.</LD>
<LD>   The story opens in the present, when Fenton Meiks (Matthew
McConaughey) shows up at FBI headquarters and announces that he can
identify an elusive serial killer. The story unfolds in flashbacks to
1979, when young Fenton (Matt O'Leary) and his brother Adam (Jeremy
Sumpter) are being raised by their widowed father (Paxton). One night
he announces to his sons that an angel has appeared to him with the
news that it is his holy mission to destroy "demons" who are walking
the earth as ordinary men and women. The three Meiks men must find
the "demons" and kill them.</LD>
<TE>   When he first read the script, Paxton says, "it really scared me.
I also thought it could be another great character role for me, but I
was a little afraid that whoever was going to direct this movie might
want to make it sensational and shocking. The movie is disturbing,
it's intense, and I decided I didn't want to let somebody else direct
me in it."</TE>
<TE>   Since making his screen debut in 1975 with one line in "Crazy
Mama," Paxton, 46, has appeared in more than 50 films. He's worked
with some of Hollywood's most acclaimed directors, including this
year's Oscar winner, Ron Howard (Paxton co-starred in 1995's "Apollo
13"). And he's been in four of James Cameron's films, including box
office behemoth "Titanic" (1997), in which he played the skipper of
the search vessel that unearthed artifacts from the sunken ocean
liner. Of his close ties to Cameron, Paxton jokes, "I'm part of his
Mercury Players," referring to Orson Welles' legendary radio and film
troupe. "I've always seen Jim as kind of my big brother, even though
we're exactly the same age."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before "Frailty" was to begin filming, Paxton saw Cameron
and asked for his advice. "He put it as a question," Paxton recalls.
"'What's the most important thing for a film director to do?' Jim
asked. 'Make it happen.'" Paxton made it happen for "Frailty" in late
2000, shooting on an $11-million budget with suburban Southern
California locations standing in for rural east Texas. Terrible
things happen during the story, but much of the violence occurs just
off-screen. "I thought the only way to make this movie would be to do
it the way someone like Hitchcock would have done it, back in the day
where you didn't show" violence, Paxton says. "It was always the
sleight of the hand, the trick of the eye. You thought you saw
something, but you really didn't, which I thought would be more
powerful."</TE>
<TE>   In discussing "Frailty," Paxton repeatedly peppers his talk with
film references, noting the noir classics of the 1940s and 1950s and
the horror films he enjoyed as a child. When asked about exposing the
children cast in his film to the deadly goings-on, Paxton quotes
Lillian Gish from "The Night of the Hunter" (1955): "It's a hard
world for little things."</TE>
<TE>   On the set, Paxton took great care that his young actors were
never overwhelmed by the gruesome events they were being called on to
witness in character. "That was a little uncomfortable," admits
Paxton, who has two young children of his own. "But to me, the
innocence of these boys was the nitroglycerin of the script, what
gave it its power punch." Paxton deliberately kept things light when
the camera wasn't rolling. And, he believes, "kids are much farther
down the road than [adults] are. They have a clear way of seeing
what's real and what's not."</TE>
<TE>   Paxton spoke at length with the parents of the two boys who play
pivotal roles in the flashback sequences.</TE>
<TE>   "He called my mom, and she was a little concerned about how the
film would affect me," relates Matt O'Leary, whose haunting
performance as the adolescent Fenton Meiks lies at the emotional core
of "Frailty." "My mom and my dad got together with Bill, and they all
came to the conclusion that I'm mature enough--and I know it's just a
movie."</TE>
<TE>   The 14-year-old, who will appear next in "Spy Kids 2,"
thoughtfully observes of his work as the troubled Fenton that "when
you're an adult, you have a lot more experiences and emotions to pull
from. But when you're a kid, you have an open mind to mimic that
emotion."</TE>
<TE>   When it came to offering guidance to O'Leary and the actor playing
the younger brother, Jeremy Sumpter, Paxton says he "was more
concerned about the kids going through the Hollywood machine" than
the perils of being exposed to the violent acts in "Frailty." "At the
beginning of the film he pulled me into his trailer and gave me a
little pep talk," O'Leary remembers. "He said that a lot of Hollywood
stuff was going to come my way, but a lot of it was fake and I
shouldn't fall into it. This was my first film ['Domestic
Disturbance,' in which he played John Travolta's son, was released
last year but was shot after 'Frailty'], and no one had said any of
this to me."</TE>
<TE>   Next up for Paxton is a change of pace: He's the romantic lead in
"Resistance," a World War II drama based on Anita Shreve's novel,
which he recently completed filming in Europe. Paxton plays a pilot
who is wounded when his plane goes down in occupied Belgium. He's
taken care of (in more ways than one) by Julia Ormond, whose
Resistance-fighter husband is conveniently absent.</TE>
<TE>   He's hoping to direct another film, but right now Paxton is, if
not exactly waiting for the next thing to happen, awaiting public
response to "Frailty," which he hopes will expand the film industry's
perception of him. "[People] seem to think of me as an affable,
all-American kind of guy, which equals boring," he reflects. "One of
the reasons I directed this movie is because I wanted the [industry]
to take another look at what I have to offer."</TE>

<HD>Digital's Early Transmissions</HD>
<DH>The National Assn. of Broadcasters convention buzzes with
news of coming tests of the technology, L.A. included.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Either it's playing music or talking all day, or it's giving you
static. And you feel like it's not living up to its potential. Is
your radio acting like a troublesome teenager?</LD>
<LD>   Well, after 80 years, commercial radio may be growing up and doing
more for you. Later this year, in Los Angeles and five other test
markets, broadcasters will begin transmitting their signals
digitally, a conversion they promise will not only improve sound
quality but also enable them to offer text messages, continuous
traffic or weather information, maps, pictures, song and artist
information and other perks, all while simultaneously playing the
station's programming.</LD>
<LD>   "It represents the first major technical advance in FM
broadcasting in probably 40 years, since the advent of stereo," said
Steve Herbert, chief engineer at KCRW-FM (89.9) in Santa Monica.</LD>
<TE>   Others say it will breathe new life into the AM band as well,
returning music to those staticky frequencies now populated almost
exclusively by news, talk and sports.</TE>
<TE>   "The first major benefit will be the sound quality--FM will sound
like a CD and AM will sound like today's good FM stations," said Bob
Law, vice president at Kenwood Corp., the home and car stereo
manufacturer based in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The digital signal will be less susceptible to interference than
the analog radio waves and can carry more information--thus making
possible AM stereo and wireless data services.</TE>
<TE>   The technology, called In-Band/On-Channel, or IBOC (often
pronounced "eye-bock"), has been in the works for a decade but was
officially introduced this week at the National Assn. of Broadcasters
convention in Las Vegas. There, vendors began offering the equipment
that radio stations will need to start transmitting digitally, and
the National Radio Systems Committee endorsed the system for AM use.
That committee, jointly sponsored by the National Assn. of
Broadcasters and the Consumer Electronics Assn., advises the Federal
Communications Commission and already endorsed IBOC digital for FM in
November.</TE>
<TE>   Those endorsements virtually ensure FCC approval some time this
summer, and radio stations will begin adding digital streams to their
analog broadcasts later this year. Listeners will be able to buy new
digital-compatible equipment after that, around the time of the
annual Consumer Electronics Show in January, said Dave Salemi, vice
president of marketing for Ibiquity Digital, the Columbia, Md.,
company that developed the IBOC technology.</TE>
<TE>   "It opens up whole new opportunities," he said. "It's time for
radio to come into the digital world."</TE>
<TE>   Satellite radio broadcasters already transmit digitally and tout
their CD-quality sound. Following broadcast and cable television,
Salemi said, terrestrial radio is the last communications industry to
take advantage of the promise of digital.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen of the nation's largest broadcasting companies have
invested in Ibiquity, including giants such as Clear Channel
Communications, Infinity Broadcasting Corp. and ABC. The company also
has support from interested heavyweights such as Ford Motor Co. and
retailers including Crutchfield and Good Guys.</TE>
<TE>   Ibiquity officials hope that the critical mass of stakeholders
behind it will guarantee IBOC's acceptance in the marketplace and
separate it from orphan technologies touted as the "next big thing"
but adopted by only a few, such as Digital Audio Tape to replace CDs
or the failed first stab at AM stereo in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   The difference between the current analog broadcasting and digital
is roughly the same as the difference between vinyl albums and
compact discs. Radio stations transmit continuous electromagnetic
waves that fly through the air until they're picked up by receivers
tuned to that frequency, which then convert the waves to sound. But
the waves are very vulnerable to interference. Digital broadcasters
send their signals not as continuous waves but in short bursts, which
are reassembled and decoded by radio receivers. Those signals can be
compressed, allowing for a much higher volume of information to be
sent out--such as pictures and text data, in addition to just the
music--and the information can be stored in the receivers. That
prevents interruptions, the way portable CD players avoid skips by
delaying playback for a few seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Digital radio proponents tout that feature, saying it will keep
listeners from losing their signals when they drive into a tunnel or
behind a tall building.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is enchanted by the new technology, however. For
instance, supporters of Low-Power FM--a service designed to allow
church or civic groups on the airwaves with tiny stations that can
transmit only a few miles--say the digital signals will interfere
with their broadcasts and eventually squelch the fledgling service
altogether. Other critics say the digital signals that will accompany
each station's analog transmission for a while create static for
stations next to it on the dial.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying there's no interference," Salemi said. "It's in
the fringe areas, where you wouldn't get the signal anyway."</TE>
<TE>   And the conversion to digital will be expensive--broadcasters will
have to upgrade their equipment and license the technology from
Ibiquity, the only company in the game right now. Herbert said KCRW
officials are still deciding how soon they'll jump on the bandwidth
wagon. "Traditionally, public radio stations have been the early
adopters of new technology. But some of the conversion costs range
upwards of $250,000," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And like other manufacturers of consumer electronics, Law said,
Kenwood will begin offering digital converters for its existing
receivers by next year, ranging from $300 to $400. More advanced
receivers, with view screens and other add-ons capable of taking
advantage of whatever new services broadcasters may dream up, will
start showing up in 2004 or 2005, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some stations already employ a more primitive technology that lets
specially equipped radios display simple text information, such as a
station's call letters or the name of the program being broadcast.
Herbert said KCRW has been using the Radio Broadcast Data System
about six years, but its offerings are limited and the service hasn't
really caught on.</TE>
<TE>   The digital conversion won't make current radios obsolete for many
years. Neither broadcasters nor government regulators want to strand
consumers, who have an average of about six radios per household,
Salemi said.</TE>
<TE>   Stations will stream the digital signals alongside their current
analog signals and may not convert completely for anywhere from five
to 50 years, he said, probably depending on how many listeners in a
given market have made the switch.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to L.A., the first test markets will be San Francisco,
Seattle, Chicago, Miami and New York, with Atlanta, Boston, Dallas,
Denver and Detroit following next year.</TE>

<HD>Why Do We Have to Work?</HD>
<DH>Movies* Director Laurent Cantet says his radical notion,
explored in 'Time Out,' has resonated with audiences at festivals
around the world.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CLARK</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Radicalism comes in many forms. It doesn't have to have wild hair,
weird clothes or a confrontational manner. It can be balding, dressed
in a conservative suit, inoffensive. It can be, in short, Vincent
(Aurelien Recoing), the soft-spoken, middle-aged financial consultant
in Laurent Cantet's "Time Out."</LD>
<LD>   Vincent, who has a wife, three kids and a nice house, is
unemployed and might seem at first glance to be merely unwilling to
confront this fact. He talks on his cell phone, scours want ads and
infrequently returns home, claiming he's been working a lot. He
sleeps in his car and dines at truck stops.</LD>
<LD>   This isn't just a world-class case of denial or shame at being
fired. As Cantet, who is French, puts it in his secondhand English
during a recent visit here, "I think it is more radical than that. It
says that work is not the only way to exist and that you can find
people for whom work is just slavery, and those people try to escape
it. People should be able to define themselves like a man and not
like a man with working. I think this sort of religion of work is
something in every nation.</LD>
<TE>   "I have a lot of friends in France who earned a lot of money," he
continues. "They were having a very easy life, and at 40 they
realized, 'What does that bring me? Just money. I don't have time. I
don't have any way of improving myself in my job.' Some of them are
now quitting just to try to make something else. It's something that
is more and more common in France and maybe here too."</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's common here, it hasn't been common in the movies, at
least not recently. Themes of work and identity are redolent of an
earlier, perhaps more questioning time in such movies as "The Man in
the Gray Flannel Suit" and the memorable scene in "The Graduate" when
an associate of the hero's father sidles up to him and offers one
word of advice, "plastics," as if that's the meaning of life.</TE>
<TE>   Cantet has screened the film in festivals around the world, and
most audiences respond to the point he's making, proving "how
powerful the idea is that the job is the most important thing in
life." However, in some cultures the centrality of work is so
important that the film can't even be shown. Two such places are
Japan and South Korea. Distributors representing those countries told
Cantet they wouldn't pick up the film because "questioning the
necessity of working is too subversive and they prefer not to show
it."</TE>
<TE>   Cantet says Vincent is "trying to live the way he wants to live,
to find this place that is not the place he's been sent to, but the
place where he would like to recognize himself." To this end, Vincent
fabricates a new job at the United Nations, a fiction that impresses
his demanding father and that he works very hard at maintaining.</TE>
<TE>   He diligently studies technical literature and discourses
learnedly on it, much as if he actually worked at the U.N. To finance
his unemployment, he lures friends into investing in a fraudulent
get-rich-quick scheme. When this becomes insupportable, he hooks up
with a con man who traffics in knockoffs. Vincent's wife is not
unaware that there's something wrong here, but she dutifully supports
him, even to the point of lying for him.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, all of Vincent's deceptions are in the service of
doing something meaningful with his life. Because, like most people,
he isn't actually doing that, he is prepared to do nearly anything in
order to appear as if he is. This may sound adolescent or even
pathological, and certainly the film plays on the idea that as the
real world closes in on Vincent's make-believe world, he could resort
to violence, either to himself or to his family.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the film was inspired by the true story of Jean-Claude
Romand, who dropped out of medical school, but convinced his family
that he'd finished his studies and landed a job at the World Health
Organization. When he was exposed in 1993, after 18 years of
deception, he murdered his wife, children and parents and tried to
kill himself. He is now in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Cantet lifted certain elements of that story--for example, the
fact that Romand claimed to be working in Geneva and that he financed
his double life by running scams. But that's as far as it goes.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want the film to be the report of the true story because
it finished in a way that didn't correspond to what I wanted to say
in the film," Cantet says. "My character is not psychotic, he's not a
killer, he's someone maybe like you and me."</TE>
<TE>   Cantet, who co-wrote the script with Robin Campillo, is nothing
like Vincent. He is clearly invested in his work. "Time Out" is his
second film. His first, "Human Resources," was set in a factory,
which, together with "Time Out," has prompted the New York Times to
call him "France's foremost cinematic poet of the workplace." He
lives in Paris and has two children, who appear in "Time Out" as
Vincent's younger children.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, these kids are a part of Cantet's working life, not
estranged from it, as is the case with most parents--and certainly
with Vincent, who tells one son, "Nothing changed for you, nothing
changed between us; why don't you let me live the life I would like
to live?"</TE>
<TE>   Cantet is the first to admit that questioning the value of work is
something only the affluent can afford. Many if not most people in
the world live hand to mouth and are concerned about food, shelter,
medical care and a stable society, not whether their job--if they
have one--nourishes their soul.</TE>
<TE>   It can also be argued that Vincent has fallen into a trap of his
own making. He has started a family and must provide for it. Running
away from that responsibility, no matter how stultifying it is, is
not exactly heroic (though, to be fair, Cantet is not saying it is).
Ironically, the only thing that gives his life any meaning is killing
him.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to imagine that the film says it's a shame that you can't
choose," Cantet says. "This sort of trap is something so cruel that
it should be possible to live in another way."</TE>

in France and maybe here too," Cantet says.</CP>

<HD>'Homebody/Kabul' to Open Taper's Season</HD>
<DH>Theater* Tony Kushner's play begins Sept. 19; also
scheduled is a version of Deaf West Theatre's Huck Finn musical, 'Big
River.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Kushner's timely new play about Afghanistan, "Homebody/Kabul,"
and a new play by August Wilson will bookend the Mark Taper Forum's
2002-03 season. The season also will consist of the West Coast
premiere of Jon Robin Baitz's "Ten Unknowns"; a version of "Big
River" that includes deaf actors; a new play about L.A. nannies by
Lisa Loomer; and a new Culture Clash production, "Chavez Ravine,"
about a neighborhood just a few blocks from the Taper.</LD>
<LD>   Running Sept. 19-Oct. 27, Kushner's "Homebody/Kabul" will launch
the season. Focusing on a British woman who disappears in Afghanistan
in 1998, the play's New York production in December drew favorable
comment not only for its own merits but also for Kushner's
prescience--it was written before the events of Sept. 11 made
Afghanistan the center of worldwide attention.</LD>
<LD>   Some critics found the play's almost four-hour length too long,
but Taper artistic director Gordon Davidson said Kushner "sharpened
it, connecting the mother's story with the daughter's better" for
subsequent productions in Berkeley and Providence--and is still open
to the possibility of further revisions. Kushner is best known for
the former Taper-bred hit "Angels in America." The first part of the
play, "Angels in America: Millennium Approaches," went on to win the
1993 Pulitzer Prize.</LD>
<TE>   As previously reported, the Taper will present Deaf West Theatre's
production of "Big River," the Huckleberry Finn musical by Roger
Miller and William Hauptman, Nov. 14-Dec. 29. Davidson said director
Jeff Calhoun has no inhibitions about moving the show from Deaf
West's smaller space in North Hollywood to the larger and differently
configured Taper. The show's potential audience, Davidson said, is
much bigger than the audiences who already saw the Deaf West
production.</TE>
<TE>   "A certain scale of musical has a place in the Taper," Davidson
said, "and this one seems very right in terms of our ongoing interest
in how signing connects with storytelling."</TE>
<TE>   The different but parallel worlds of nannies from East L.A. and
the Westside homes where they work is the subject of Lisa Loomer's
"Living Out," slated for Jan. 30-March 9. The new play was
commissioned and developed by the Taper. Loomer wrote two earlier
Taper productions, "The Waiting Room" and "Expecting Isabel."</TE>
<TE>   Baitz's "Ten Unknowns" (March 27-May 4, 2003) examines an American
artist who's been rediscovered after nearly 30 years of self-imposed
obscurity in Mexico. It premiered at New York's Lincoln Center
Theater a year ago. Baitz wrote three previous Taper shows: "Dutch
Landscape," "The Substance of Fire" and "Three Hotels."</TE>
<TE>   The premiere of Culture Clash's "Chavez Ravine" (May 29-July 6,
2003) will look into the history of the site of Dodger Stadium, going
back to the communities razed to make room for a failed housing
project, and continuing forward to the day when Fernando Valenzuela
became a starting pitcher for the Dodgers in 1981. The comedy group's
three members--Richard Montoya, Ric Salinas and Herbert
Siguenza--will be joined by an actress and directed by Lisa Peterson.
The play was commissioned and developed by the Taper.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson's "Gem of the Ocean" (July 31-Sept. 7, 2003) will be the
ninth play in his cycle of scripts that are set in different decades
of African American life during the last century. This one is set in
1904. Directed by Marion McClinton, it will premiere at Chicago's
Goodman Theatre in June 2003 before coming to the Taper.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the Taper wants to produce this year's Pulitzer
Prize-winning "Topdog/Underdog," Davidson said he offered a slot in
the coming season to the play's producers, but they decided to move
it to Broadway, where it opened Sunday. The play is written by
Suzan-Lori Parks, who heads the A.S.K. Theater Projects Writing for
Performance Program at CalArts in Valencia. "Now that it's a
commercial production, they'll wait and see what to do with it next,"
Davidson said.</TE>

<HD>Her Only Reality Is Behind the Footlights</HD>
<DH>The rigorous but rewarding 'Esther Kahn' illuminates a
talented and intelligent young woman's interior life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The exquisite yet demanding "Esther Kahn" is one of the most unusual
and persuasive explorations of the flowering of an actor. It unfolds
in a low-key manner in the mind of its title character, for whom life
does not become real until she discovers the theater. It is also a
superbly evoked period piece set in London at the turn of the 20th
century, where Esther (Summer Phoenix) grows up in grim, industrial
East End as one of four children of a poor Jewish immigrant tailor
(Laszlo Szabo).</LD>
<LD>   From earliest childhood Esther feels detached from her family,
whose home is also its sweatshop. While the rest of the family lives
a hard-working everyday existence, she seems as if she is
sleepwalking, going through the motions and feeling nothing. Yet as
she matures into a dark-haired beauty, she ponders such philosophical
questions as "If I am dreaming, how can I know the world exists?"
Will she ever experience "real life"? she wonders.</LD>
<TE>   Paradoxically, she receives her answer when she attends her first
play, a florid Yiddish production staged in a quaintly baroque
theater. At last, life seems real to her, but at the same time she
realizes the play's leading actress is terrible. In a flash, she
analyzes all that's wrong with her performance and suddenly senses
she could do it herself and do it right. It's not long before Esther,
now a factory worker, has won her first chance to act. Her supreme
self-confidence and sure intuition guarantee a swift rise in the
theater.</TE>
<TE>   What makes "Esther Kahn" so demanding is that it progresses in
such a low-key manner that it risks monotony. But it's worth the
concentration because all the while, writer-director Arnaud
Desplechin and his co-writer, Emmanuel Bourdieu, in adapting an
Arthur Symons short story, are building to a grand climax.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix meets the challenge of making so reticent and affectless a
woman as Esther alive and involving with her beauty and intelligence,
and the glimpses we have of Esther acting on stage are also
impressive. Desplechin has said he was inspired by Truffaut's "The
Wild Child" in the way he views Esther and her coming of age amid
such strong feelings of alienation from her family and environment.</TE>
<TE>   Esther may be self-absorbed in her art, but she takes everything
in, especially from Fabrice Desplechin's Phillip as a suave,
sophisticated drama critic who becomes her mentor and coach. Esther
is appreciative of Phillip, but the more captivated she becomes by
all that he teaches her, the less attention she pays to him as a
lover. Ian Holm has the crucial role of a kindly veteran actor in the
"Hedda Gabler" production who warns her that she "can't refuse life."</TE>
<TE>   "Esther Kahn" begins as a shadowy film that progresses from dark
to increasing light. It has been stunningly photographed by Eric
Gautier and has a wonderfully expressive score composed by Howard
Shore.</TE>
<TE>   As an engaging portrait of an actress and life in the theater,
"Esther Kahn" recalls William Wyler's masterful, underrated "Carrie,"
with Jennifer Jones and Laurence Olivier, and John Turturro's 1999
"Illuminata," a rhapsodic celebration of love and life in theater,
set in 1905 Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   But in its understated tone and concern for a performer's interior
life and imagination "Esther Kahn" is closer in spirit to Stanley
Kwan's "Actress," about the life of a Shanghai film star of the '20s
and '30s, Ruan Ling-yu, and also Kon Ichikawa's "Actress," about the
great Japanese screen star Kinuyo Tanaka, famed for her
collaborations with master director Kenji Mizoguchi. "Esther Kahn" is
arguably more venturesome and insightful than any of them.</TE>

<HD>A Powerful Depiction of Human 'Frailty'</HD>
<DH>Though it ultimately out-tricks itself, this spooky
angels-of-death story provides Bill Paxton a rich directing debut.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Frailty" comes to us complete with testimonials to its ability to
thrill from authorities like Sam Raimi, James Cameron and Stephen
King. Could experts like this ever be wrong? Of course they could,
but in this case, they're not.</LD>
<LD>   The scary directing debut of star Bill Paxton, "Frailty" is a
well-crafted, disturbing Texas gothic thriller, a completely spooky
piece of business that gets under your skin and, some plot blips
aside, stays there for the duration.</LD>
<LD>   Paxton didn't get those tributes just by being proficient; he's
acted both for Raimi ("A Simple Plan") and Cameron ("Titanic,"
"Aliens"). But he wanted more respect than Hollywood performers
usually get, and directing seemed the best means toward that end. The
actor shrewdly chose a script by new writer Brent Hanley for his
first assignment. Though it's finally too tricky for its own good,
Hanley's persuasive, well-written screenplay provides a strong role
for Paxton the actor and a showcase for the talents of Paxton the
director.</LD>
<TE>   For no matter what you think of the film's twists, it's the
insidious creep-show atmosphere of "Frailty" that is its greatest
lure. Collaborating with veteran cinematographer Bill Butler ("Jaws,"
"Grease"), production designer Nelson Coates and composer Brian
Tyler, "Frailty" expertly depicts the potential for horror lurking
behind the everydayness of a small West Texas town, albeit one shot
in West Covina and Sylmar.</TE>
<TE>   "Frailty" is also that rare actor-directed film that does not
indulge its characters. Quite the opposite. Paxton gets considerable
benefits from his deliberate, restrained narrative style. Making a
film about someone who hacks people up with an ax is a lot more
effective if the actual hacking is done off screen.</TE>
<TE>   "Frailty" isn't in a hurry to get to that hacking, either. It
starts in the present day, on a (what else but?) dark and stormy
Dallas night. FBI man Wesley Doyle (the reliable Powers Boothe), the
agent in charge of investigating the grisly God's Hand murders, has
come into the office to talk to a man about the case.</TE>
<TE>   That would be Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey), a haunted,
indefinably weird individual who tells an increasingly strange tale.
He says his younger brother Adam is behind the God's Hand slaughters,
a series of murders that grew out of the fertile soil of the boys'
bizarre upbringing. The FBI man is dubious, but, Fenton says
pointedly, "sometimes the truth defies reason."</TE>
<TE>   With McConaughey providing an insidious, insinuating voice-over,
the film spends much of its time in extended flashback, showing the
decidedly peculiar upbringing of young Fenton (Matthew O'Leary) and
even younger Adam (Jeremy Sumpter). At first, the boys' life with
their widower auto mechanic dad (Paxton), a guy who seems to mean it
when he says, "Love you guys," couldn't be more normal. But that all
changes when Dad comes into their bedroom one night and announces
that he's just received a vision from the almighty about "God's
special plan for our family."</TE>
<TE>   It turns out that, in preparation for the final Judgment Day
battle, demons in human form have been released on Earth, even in
West Texas. These Meiks may not inherit the Earth, but they have been
chosen by God to destroy those monsters with special weapons the Lord
will provide. Young Adam takes on this task immediately; "we're a
family of superheroes," he exults.</TE>
<TE>   His brother Fenton, however, understandably thinks this is more
than a bit much. He feels even worse when Dad starts bringing home
average-looking folks and insisting they're rotten to the core and
ready for the ax. (One of the more intriguing ways to look at
"Frailty" is as a parable about the dangers of religious fanaticism.)</TE>
<TE>   What makes "Frailty" the nightmare it is: That we can see what a
horror show the situation was not only for the victims but also for
the boys who couldn't escape it. What do you do when your dad, who
continues to treat you with genuine consideration, seems to have gone
over the edge in a town unlikely to believe your crazy story?</TE>
<TE>   Though McConaughey is strong as the teller of the tale, it is
Paxton's work as the unnerving dad that holds "Frailty" together and
gives it its discomforting tone. He talks about the bloody work he
has to do in God's name in a completely normal tone of voice, as if
it were the most plausible, reasonable thing in the world. "If I
could spare you this," he says in a classic this-hurts-me-more
manner, "I would." But "God has willed this, and we must obey God."</TE>
<TE>   As a director, Paxton has been equally reasonable and also managed
to get everyone in the film on his particular wavelength. Though a
potential splatter movie that rations its blood drop by precious drop
may not make you happy to be alive, it's certainly something worth
paying attention to.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for violence and some language. Times guidelines:
intensely disturbing subject matter, including several ax murders
that are upsetting even though shown with a minimum of blood.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Experiencing the performance of alto saxophonist Frank Morgan with
pianist George Cables' trio at the Jazz Bakery Tuesday night was a
bit like hearing a chamber ensemble perform a Mozart string quartet.
Not that there was any similarity in the content, but in the sense
that both represent the high-level presentation of a classical form
of music.</LD>
<LD>   The bebop period in jazz, like the classical era in concert music,
was a time when musicians agreed upon a general schematic framework
within which to express their creativity. Morgan and Cables are
straight-ahead bebop players who are masters of this classic form--a
demanding yet extraordinarily rich approach to improvisation.</LD>
<LD>   As with a Mozart quartet performance, there were no surprises in
terms of what was played. The program consisted of what can best be
described as bebop standards--"A Night In Tunisia," "'Round
Midnight," "I'll Remember April," the sort of fundamental material
from which beboppers crafted their flights of fancy.</LD>
<TE>   The fact that the music was positioned within a familiar framework
did not in any way diminish the quality of the invention that took
place or the musical imagination from which it flowed. And one of the
most appealing aspects of that imagination was the capacity of Morgan
and Cables, along with bassist Jeff Littleton and drummer Fritz Wise,
to extract something fundamentally appealing from the music's
virtuosic qualities: attractive, on-the-spot melodies.</TE>
<TE>   On "I'll Remember April," for example, Cables flowed irresistibly
across the keyboard in sweeping phrases. When he dug into a closing
blues, his phrasing reached up from the music's primal roots into a
richly swinging interaction with Littleton and Wise.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan's warm sound and emotion-tinged phrasing were at their best
in his set of choruses on "Tunisia." Maneuvering through the song's
familiar breaks without electing to follow in the classic Charlie
Parker pattern, he ventured into his own path, juxtaposing fleet runs
and bop-style riffs against high-note shouts and wails.</TE>
<TE>   No surprises, true. But plenty of adventurous improvising within a
familiar setting--classic, mid-20th century jazz at its best.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Morgan with the George Cables Trio at the Jazz Bakery, 3233
Helms Ave., Culver City. Tonight through Sunday at 8 and 9:30 p.m.
$25. (310) 271-9039.</TE>

<HD>Church Sex-Abuse Controversy, and Exorcising a Vision of
Scandals Past</HD>

<LD>Even the nastiest headlines ultimately resurface on TV as
entertainment. So as sure as movies about Catholics tilt toward
miracles, saints and exorcisms of demons, you can bet that teleplays
are now being written about the nationwide child-abuse cases
blackening the Catholic Church.</LD>
<LD>   Best-case scenario, they'll be thoughtful, sensitive and
perceptive, having this scandal bode ominously not only for the
church and its credibility--How much did top guys know and when did
they know it?--but also for the tainted priests who may be innocent.
Oh ... them.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the accused clergy are clearly guilty, and most appear
guilty or at least morally culpable. But what if some are not? What
if the cases against them are no more plausible than statues that cry
tears of blood? What if there are cracks in the monolith of evil
reported by media day after day?</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the presumption of guilt is now so strong in much
of the TV coverage, the net so wide, that one can't help recalling
media's role in the witch-hunt frenzies behind sex-abuse allegations
that closed the McMartin day-care center in Manhattan Beach and
Little Rascals preschool in Edenton, N.C., in the 1980s and 1990s,
respectively. The first case yielded no convictions, the second two
that were overturned. All of the defendants were stigmatized
indelibly.</TE>
<TE>   Although not strictly analogous to the present scandal, the same
rule of fairness applies today that should have applied then. And a
token "allegedly" hardly cuts it when the crushing tonnage of
reporting is mostly accusatory.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to entertainment, meanwhile, prime time has a spotty
record in depicting priests who don't coincide with benign cliches.</TE>
<TE>   Lasting only two episodes in 1998 was the CBS series "Four
Corners," whose Mexican American priest lusted after a curvy redhead
before ending his crisis of faith by informing her he loved God best.
"Four Corners" was defrocked just two weeks before the finale of the
more controversial short-lived ABC series "Nothing Sacred," whose
provocative Father Ray irritated many Bible thumpers by nearly
lapsing with an old flame and generally defying conventional
doctrine.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do people ask priests for help on their marriages?" he
wondered at one point. "Who ... could know less about marriage than
priests?"</TE>
<TE>   And know more about controversy these days? Check out this TV
picture:</TE>
<TE>   A cherubic altar boy is molested repeatedly by a parish priest in
whom his devoutly Catholic family has complete trust. Yes, you're
getting the drift.</TE>
<TE>   When the lad reluctantly indicates to his parents he was fondled
by the seemingly gentle and caring priest, they're initially
skeptical. Particularly the boy's father. What is it with this kid?
This is the church, after all. Their church.</TE>
<TE>   Finally they're persuaded, their son's rectal bleeding and altered
behavior now making sense. When seeking comfort and justice from a
cold, intimidating monsignor, however, they receive no satisfaction
and leave outraged. After hiring an aggressive lawyer who confronts
the church, the anguished couple is offered a financial settlement,
but one not including an admission of the priest's guilt or a promise
that he will be reported to police or even removed from the parish.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, you are getting the drift. This is not cuddly Barry
Fitzgerald and mellow Bing Crosby in "Going My Way." Or even
rebellious Father Ray questioning the existence of God.</TE>
<TE>   It turns out that eight other altar boys are being molested by the
offending priest, and this is not the first such complaint against
him. For years the church had been transferring him from parish to
parish in response to charges that he sexually abused young boys in
his care. It's obvious that the film's stonewalling church hierarchy
is not only cowardly, but cares more about image than about the
well-being of children being emotionally scarred for life by a
predatory priest.</TE>
<TE>   Sound hauntingly familiar, as the Catholic Church is rocked in
2002 by sexual-abuse and cover-up scandals that have touched dioceses
in Los Angeles and Orange counties and kept Cardinal Roger M. Mahony
sizzling on a hot seat?</TE>
<TE>   Based on an actual case in Louisiana, what you've just read is the
plot of an HBO movie titled "Judgment." Good cast, ugly and painful
topic, perfect timing.</TE>
<TE>   Original airdate: 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about being ahead of one's time. Given recent revelations,
the film that Tom Topor wrote and directed is even more relevant
today than a dozen years ago, when breaching the inner sanctum of
church secrecy was almost as jolting as the act of sexual abuse
itself.</TE>
<TE>   "Judgment" last aired in 2000, on one of HBO's multiplex channels,
and the pay-cable giant says it has no plans to rerun it. HBO's claim
that it no longer owns rights to "Judgment" is disputed by the film's
executive producer, Steve Tisch, who believes now is the ideal time
to show it again.</TE>
<TE>   It originally arrived at HBO, he says, after being rejected by the
commercial broadcast networks, who felt at the time "it was much too
controversial, and that sponsorship would be a huge issue." This
year's news surely renders that moot.</TE>
<TE>   "Judgment" is no great movie. Although treating its subject
candidly and with restraint--thanks largely to strong work by Blythe
Danner and Keith Carradine as the parents, David Strathairn as the
priest and Michael Faustino as the molested boy--its
movie-of-the-week thinness falls short of HBO's present standards.</TE>
<TE>   Because it's uncannily on point, however, Tisch is right about it
meriting another shot in 2002, the TV-rights issue being for others
to work out.</TE>
<TE>   The verdict arrived long ago regarding the priest on which
Strathairn's Father Aubert is based. Viewers are told in a printed
message on the screen that he was convicted and sentenced to 20 years
at hard labor without possibility of parole.</TE>
<TE>   Whether "Judgment" rises again remains to be seen. It may need a
miracle.</TE>

<KH>All That Jazz</KH>
<HD>From the Archives, New Entries in the Ellington Songbook</HD>
<DH>Containing the first recordings of songs from an unproduced
musical, a new CD has a few gems but no real revelations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Great American Songbook, that de facto assortment of memorable
tunes--often referred to as "standards"--encompasses material written
during an astonishingly brief period of time. It's probably
stretching the span, in fact, to say that most of the numbers were
written in about three decades, from 1920 to 1950. Yet the products
of this brilliant burst of creativity continue to be essential to the
soundtrack of American life.</LD>
<LD>   The writers considered the primary contributors to the songbook
include the Gershwins, Rodgers &amp; Hart (and Hammerstein), Irving
Berlin, Jerome Kern, Cole Porter, Harold Arlen and Jimmy McHugh.
Rarely included in this grouping, despite his significant body of
work, is Duke Ellington.</LD>
<LD>   Most music fans, even serious jazz fans, are quick to acknowledge
the fact that Ellington (often in collaboration with Billy Strayhorn)
created some certified pop classics. Think "I Got It Bad (And That
Ain't Good)," "Sophisticated Lady," "Solitude," "In a Sentimental
Mood," etc.</LD>
<TE>   The list could go on, yet Ellington's obvious status as a
bandleader, pianist and composer of some of the most vital and
adventurous music of the 20th century has tended to eclipse his
equally vibrant accomplishments as a songwriter.</TE>
<TE>   Had he ever stopped touring and recording long enough to do what
most of the songbook composers did--work in the musical
theater--Ellington's identification as a master songwriter would
undoubtedly have been more secure. But, had he done so, we might not
have been the fortunate beneficiaries of his (and Strayhorn's) vast
catalog of works for the Ellington ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Ellington did make a few stops in the musical theater
along the way. Although he never managed to have a hit show, he did
produce a few scores that deserved better treatment than they got:
"Jump for Joy" (which ran from July through September 1941 at the
Mayan Theatre in Los Angeles), "Beggar's Holiday" (which had 111
performances at New York City's Broadway Theatre in 1946-47), and the
poorly received "Pousse-Cafe" in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   It turns out that in 1958 Ellington and Strayhorn wrote the songs
for yet another musical, "Saturday Laughter." Twenty-two numbers were
composed to lyrics written by Herb Martin for a musical based on
"Mine Boy," Peter Abrahams' novel about apartheid in South Africa.
The production never found adequate financing, and the songs--until
now--have remained in Ellington archives.</TE>
<TE>   But a new CD, "Secret Ellington" (True Life Entertainment), offers
the world premiere recording of 12 of the songs from "Saturday
Laughter," performed by varying ensembles and singers. Among the
participants: vocalists Ian Shaw, Freddy Cole, Jeffery Smith, Judi
Silvano and Karen Oberlin, and instrumentalists Grover Washington
Jr., Joe Lovano, George Mraz and Joe Beck. (The first concert
performance of the songs took place at St. Peter's Church in
Manhattan on April 15, 2000.)</TE>
<TE>   There are no astounding revelations in the 14 tracks (two of the
tunes are presented in alternate versions), primarily because
Martin's lyrics are simply not in a class with Ellington/Strayhorn
melodies and harmonies. Nor, on the recording, do the many differing
instrumental combinations completely capture the Ellington musical
mystique.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, there are a few tunes in which Martin and Ellington
clicked, and each deserves further hearings and further
interpretations. "They Say," which was performed by Brock Peters at
Ellington's funeral in 1974, is a poignantly uplifting combination of
words and music, performed on the album by Cole with a lovely soprano
saxophone accompaniment from Washington (in one of his final
recordings). "Only Yesterday" is a ballad with a line that arches
through typically colorful Ellingtonian harmonies.</TE>
<TE>   But in other tunes--"You Are Beautiful" and "You Walk in My
Dreams," for example--appealing melodies are overwhelmed by the banal
simplicity of the lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   How did Ellington manage to team up with a lyricist who was so far
out of his league? Good question, no real answer. But the more
pertinent query may be why good theater writers weren't climbing over
each other's backs in an effort to team up with a composer so
obviously capable of creating timeless musical works of art.</TE>
<TE>   Don't Buy This Record: It's called "Verve Remixed," and it may be
the worst travesty ever perpetrated upon unsuspecting jazz artists
(half of whom aren't around to complain about it).</TE>
<TE>   Here's the deal: Verve has taken recordings by Carmen McRae, Nina
Simone, Shirley Horn, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday
and others, and turned them over to remix masters (who shall be
mercifully left nameless). What they have done to lovely performances
such as McRae's "How Long Has This Been Going On?" and Vaughan's
"Summertime" represents a pathetic example of their lack of creative
imagination. What they have done to Holiday's "Don't Explain" and
"Strange Fruit" is criminal.</TE>
<TE>   Verve, of course, is probably delighted at the free publicity ride
the album will receive when journalists respond to its sheer
offensiveness--it's the old PR premise of "say whatever you want, but
spell my name right." At least one executive has suggested that the
album might actually attract young listeners who might otherwise have
no interest in jazz. But that's a bit like killing the unicorn to
show everyone how beautiful it was. So, I repeat and expand my
opening comment: Don't waste your money on an album that contradicts
everything that jazz stands for.</TE>
<TE>   Change of Plan: The Backstreet Galleries' Gerald Wiggins
Performance Room was to be the site of an appearance by "Wig" himself
Saturday night. The veteran pianist, his trio, special guest vocalist
Pat Hodges and various friends were planning a celebration titled
"Shades of the Cotton Club: Ella &amp; Duke." But Wiggins, just out of
the hospital after a surgical procedure, will not be able to make the
gig. In a remarkable leap of generations, Wiggins, who will be 80 in
May, will be replaced by the gifted young teenage pianist Gerald
Clayton.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Backstreet Galleries, 11618 W. Exposition Blvd., L.A., (310)
479-6262. The performance is 9-11 p.m., and a $25 donation is
requested.</TE>
<TE>   Hockey Puck Jazz: An ESPN focus group study recently came up with
some interesting responses to the cable network's sports programming.
Among the most intriguing: a participant who reportedly said, "Try
hockey with the sound off--but put on up-tempo jazz. It's great."
Definitely worth a try.</TE>

<HD>MSNBC Changes Its Brand to 'America's NewsChannel'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>MSNBC, the third-rated cable news network, is re-branding itself
"America's NewsChannel" in an attempt to simultaneously tap into the
country's newfound sense of patriotism and present the image of an
independent-thinking channel whose politics cover the spectrum of
viewpoints.</LD>
<LD>   The new slogan, which as of Thursday began periodically framing
the channel's on-screen headlines, will be accompanied by a reworked
logo with an American flag-colored NBC peacock, smaller than the
large waving American flag that rival Fox News Channel features. The
brand campaign replaces MSNBC's most recent tag line, "The Best News
on Cable," which was preceded by "MSNBC: The Whole Picture."</LD>
<LD>   The new brand is the channel's latest step in its attempt to catch
up with cable news leader Fox and second-place CNN. MSNBC has also
hired liberal Phil Donahue and conservative Alan Keyes to start and
end the evening talk-show lineup, and it won an internal battle with
sister channel CNBC to gain exclusive use of "Hardball" host Chris
Matthews.</LD>
<TE>   In a memo to staff, MSNBC President Erik Sorenson said the new
brand reflects MSNBC's across-the-gamut politics, writing, "Since our
launch in 1996, we have taken a populist approach--offering a rainbow
of ideas and a solid variety of voices."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Sorenson said, "We needed to stake out some
territory in the aftermath of Sept. 11." The new brand, he added,
isn't meant to be jingoistic, but to convey that "it's
quintessentially American to have spirited, ongoing debate and
discussion about the issues of the day."</TE>
<TE>   Sorenson's memo took a veiled swipe at Fox's sloganeering ("We
Report; You Decide" and "Fair and Balanced"): "Some news channels
seem partisan, favoring one side over another (regardless of slogans
or protestations to the contrary)." Alluding to CNN, which uses the
slogans "You can depend on CNN" and the above-the-fray "This ... is
CNN," the memo said, "Some cut deals with foreign governments or
foreign broadcasters so as to provide coverage on an international
basis to foreign viewers."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, MSNBC, he wrote, "is not partisan and has no agenda,
other than to serve the American people--serve our viewers--[and]
give them in-depth coverage and thorough analysis."</TE>
<TE>   A CNN spokesman called the move "laughable." A Fox spokesman said,
"MSNBC is irrelevant."</TE>

<HD>Silly Antics Get the 'Sweetest' Venue for Offbeat Love Story</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cameron Diaz doesn't have to do much for her $15 million in "The
Sweetest Thing" besides be Cameron Diaz. The movie is, for all intents
and purposes, about being Cameron Diaz. Luckily, there is someone named
Cameron Diaz who was not only available but does the job quite well.</LD>
<LD>   And with the able-bodied (you can't miss it) assistance of Christina
Applegate and Selma Blair, Diaz makes what might have been a
cookie-cutter comedy into one of the fresher releases this year, a movie
with a real anarchic flair. No, she's not Groucho Marx.</LD>
<LD>   No, it isn't really a movie, as such--more a Farrelly brothers-style
arrangement of stand-up routines. And yes, too many of those jokes fall
back on the old reliable "Something About Mary"-esque festival of body
fluids and strategic equipment (although one sequence involving Blair's
Jane trying to get a Clintonized dress dry-cleaned is among the funnier
set pieces anyone's come up with in years).</LD>
<TE>   Still, there's a willingness to take chances and a frankness about the
emotional and other byproducts of sex that's refreshing, as well as a
smartly vulgar script by Nancy Pimental (a former co-host of 'Win Ben
Stein's Money').</TE>
<TE>   And the three actresses accomplish that old canard, making it seem as
if making the movie was the best time they've ever had. It might have
been hell. But it feels like fun.</TE>
<TE>   This is particularly true of Applegate, erstwhile "Married ... With
Children" lumber-camp toy (the studio's phrase, not mine) who as the
wiser, earthier Courtney is the best sidekick Diaz is ever going to find.
Think Eve Arden with breast implants. During the movie's centerpiece trip
by Courtney and Christina (Diaz) to find a wedding at which they will
find Christina's new love bunny, Peter (Thomas Jane), they break into an
impromptu, apropos-of-nothing movie montage, during which Applegate's
impersonation of Julia Roberts in "Pretty Woman" is so catty you can
smell the litter box.</TE>
<TE>   Story? What story? Christina, Courtney and Jane are tired of the
singles scene, sad that their "hearts have been stomped on" so many times
(although they're all clearly the stomper, rather than stompee, type) and
crave true romance. The trick is getting from a conclusion made five
minutes into a movie to an ending 90 minutes away. It can be a scary
prospect. In "The Sweetest Thing" it is mostly a hoot.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong sexual content and language.</TE>

<HD>Lives in Collision</HD>
<DH>A car accident mushrooms into a nightmare of revenge in a
maddening yet watchable 'Changing Lanes.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Compelling yet off-putting, quietly realistic as well as completely
contrived, shameless in the name of social responsibility, "Changing
Lanes" is a frustrating yet deeply watchable melodrama that makes you
think it's a tougher picture than it is.</LD>
<LD>   "Changing Lanes" stars Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson as a pair
of Manhattan motorists who have a bump-and-run collision on FDR Drive
and then take road rage to apocalyptic heights as they systematically
attempt to ruin each other's lives.</LD>
<LD>   Adeptly written by Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin and impressively
directed by Roger Michell, "Changing Lanes" is especially good at
bringing an urban nightmare to the screen. As its two protagonists
live through the worst day in either of their lives, as they
discover, as Affleck's character puts it, that "the world is a
sewer," they increasingly disregard not only consideration and
civility but also morality and even legality in their heedlessly
self-centered zeal for one-upmanship and revenge.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, "Changing Lanes" is almost too successful in its ability
to create a disturbing paranoid fantasy about all the ways determined
enemies can hurt us in the modern world. So many dreadful events are
visited on the protagonists that the question becomes not how
plausible is this but rather, plausible or not, what's in it for
anyone to watch these people suffer the modern equivalent of the woes
of Job?</TE>
<TE>   There are other difficulties as well. For all its initial
provocativeness, its dystopian look at how quickly and decisively
modern society can disintegrate, "Changing Lanes" is ultimately
timid. Like a Disneyland ride, it gives us a glimpse of a contrived
abyss and then carefully pulls back from the edge.</TE>
<TE>   With all these problems, the film's undeniable pull on us is a
tribute not only to the cleverness of the script and the passion of
the actors but also to the surprising deftness director Michell shows
with this kind of pulp fiction. Surprising because this is more than
the British Michell's American debut; it's a film that couldn't be
more different from his earlier successes.</TE>
<TE>   Best known in this country for the irresistible "Notting Hill,"
Michell also directed what might be the best of the 1990s spate of
Jane Austen adaptations, "Persuasion." Michell's gift for the
plausible, his determination to keep things low-key and his ability
with actors, especially those in subsidiary roles, have made this
story of everything going wrong, wrong, wrong much more convincing
than it otherwise would be. One need only to compare "Changing Lanes"
to the dreadful Michael Douglas-starring "Falling Down" of a few
years back to see how badly this film could have gone astray.</TE>
<TE>   Though they're both New Yorkers, given the gap in their social
statuses, the only way Gavin Banek (Affleck) and Doyle Gipson
(Jackson) are likely ever to meet is through something like a traffic
accident. Before that happens, "Changing Lanes" takes pains to show
us why both men were especially keyed up on that particular morning.</TE>
<TE>   Banek is a well-connected, successful New York attorney who has
just helped his partners, including father-in-law Andrew Delano
(Sydney Pollack), gain control of a foundation set up by a recently
deceased philanthropist. The philanthropist's granddaughter is angry
at this, but Banek feels he did nothing wrong. Still, he has to be in
court at the appointed time to file the necessary documents or get
into serious trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Gipson is up against some very different, very personal dilemmas.
He's a recovering alcoholic (William Hurt has a cameo as his sponsor)
whose wife is trying to get custody of their two children so she can
take them out of state. Gipson, who is buying a house to help stop
this, must be in court at the appointed time if he has a prayer of
sharing custody.</TE>
<TE>   When these men's cars collide, their cultures do as well. Gipson,
trying to reconstruct his life, says it's important for him to do
things the right way, to be clean in all his actions. Banek, in a
Masters of the Universe rush, has no such scruples. He hands Gipson a
blank check and tears off, which turns out to be a big mistake.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, he's left Gipson, whose car is disabled, without a
ride, meaning the critical custody hearing is over by the time he
gets there. For another, once Banek's in court, he discovers that
he's given the crucial papers, papers he must recover by the end of
the day or risk going to jail (don't ask), to a man who now considers
himself a sworn enemy.</TE>
<TE>   As this conflict escalates, both men do expert jobs with their
performances, with Affleck, who's been callow before ("Boiler Room,"
"Bounce"), having the more familiar role. Jackson's much more
sympathetic Doyle Gipson, however, is a fascinating departure for the
actor. His character is withdrawn, almost docile until aroused, a man
of considerable gravity and the quietest possible authority.</TE>
<TE>   It's a credit to director Michell and casting agents Ellen Lewis
and Marcia De Bonis that "Changing Lanes'" smaller roles are as well
done as the two leads. Almost every performance, from major
supporters like Pollack, Toni Collette (as Banek's colleague) and Kim
Staunton (as Valerie Gipson, Doyle's wife) to the smallest speaking
parts, is touched by truth. It's a measure of this kind of skill that
Amanda Peet, usually found in comic roles, gives a cool, focused,
unexpected turn as Banek's calculating wife, Cynthia.</TE>
<TE>   "Changing Lanes" does contain some truth about the heedlessness of
modern society and the possibilities for redemption, but it's finally
too content to tell us what we already know. Still, like any
well-told story, no matter how familiar, you're going to want to
watch this one through to the end.</TE>

<HD>Roll the Credits (Out the Door)</HD>
<DH>TV* Hoping to keep viewers from channel- surfing, Discovery
looks to delete or reduce the crawl of names after shows. Some
producers are upset.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having already endured being crunched, sped up and shoved to the side
of the screen, the next indignity for television credits could be
near-elimination.</LD>
<LD>   That's the plan, at least, being proposed by the Discovery
Networks, which is pursuing a "credit initiative" that seeks to
delete or significantly reduce credits at the end of programs,
limiting a producer to a five-second card identifying the production
company and other mandatory credits.</LD>
<LD>   Several producers of documentary and nonfiction programming are
upset about the proposal as well as worried that the practice will
spread to other cable channels. Unlike the major networks, which in
some instances are obligated to run credits under guild contracts,
most cable channels are not signatories to those agreements, although
some of their program suppliers are.</LD>
<TE>   Discovery has been discussing the proposal at a series of meetings
with producers in recent weeks, citing proprietary research that
indicates that viewers see credits as an invitation to begin
channel-surfing. Producers attending those events were asked to sign
nondisclosure agreements, fueling anxiety among them that openly
criticizing the plan would risk alienating Discovery, which, with its
various channels, is a major purchaser of nonfiction programs.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the flagship Discovery Channel, holdings of the
company based in Bethesda, Md., include Animal Planet, TLC and the
Travel Channel.</TE>
<TE>   John Ford, president of the content group for Discovery Networks
U.S., stressed that the initiative is a work in progress and that
feedback from producers is being taken into account. He added,
however, that "a solid majority" of producers recognizes the logic
behind the shift, citing a test of the truncated credits on Discovery
in the fall in which viewer retention from program to program
improved by 30%.</TE>
<TE>   "Viewers do not clamor for credits," Ford said, noting that they
are, rather, "leaving in droves" during the time credits are rolling.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the proposal is the assumption that, other than those who
work within the TV industry, viewers don't care about credits,
especially for so-called "below-the-line" jobs in technical areas
such as sound or editing. Discovery has told producers it would make
full credits available on its Web site and link to the producers'
sites.</TE>
<TE>   "What is the value to the production company of a viewer in Kansas
knowing the head writer of the show is Jim Smith?" Ford asked,
adding, "If the show gets [higher ratings], there's more money, we'll
make more of them, and everybody wins."</TE>
<TE>   Discovery nevertheless appears concerned that a shift will fray
relations with some in the production community. Because of that,
channel representatives volunteered to provide The Times names of
producers working for the channel who don't object to the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Dave Bell, a veteran producer who does not have any shows
on Discovery, said people deserve to be credited for their work.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be like a newspaper saying, 'No more bylines,'" he said.
"People want to know who's responsible."</TE>
<TE>   As it is, the major networks have already adopted strategies that
include squeezing credits and making them share the screen with
program content, as NBC does with its "Must-See TV" sitcoms, in an
effort to prevent viewers from clicking away at the close of shows.</TE>
<TE>   Credits have also been accelerated, Ford pointed out, to the point
that they are difficult to read on screen. Other networks, including
ESPN and the cable news channels, do not provide credits at the
conclusion of certain programs.</TE>
<TE>   Cheryl Rhoden, assistant director of the Writers Guild of America,
said the obligation to run credits on programs produced under guild
contracts is tied to the license, meaning the producers' obligation
flows to the network buying it. Failing to run credits on fare
subject to those agreements could result in arbitration or legal
action by the guild. The guilds have no jurisdiction over nonunion
programming.</TE>
<TE>   "Credits are a very important part of the rights of creators,"
Rhoden said. "It's also an economic right, since they help in
[securing] work in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Ford said Discovery had no intention of violating any of its
existing contracts but would seek to revise its agreements in future
negotiations. Various schemes are still being considered, he noted,
among them featuring some credits coming into and out of commercial
breaks. Discovery has not set a firm deadline on formalizing the
policy and is scheduled to meet later this month with officials at
Britain's BBC--a major supplier of documentaries to Discovery--at an
international TV festival in Cannes, France.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to say what has always been for the last 50 years
doesn't have to be going forward," Ford said.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Schotz, whose LMNO Productions is responsible for several
series on Discovery-owned networks as well as such prime-time
programs as Fox's "Boot Camp," acknowledged that the policy would
bruise egos but said he understands the impetus behind it in terms of
attempting to retain viewers.</TE>
<TE>   ''Hollywood hates change, but it's part of the world we live in,"
he said. "On a practical level, you have to get over it."</TE>
<TE>   Critics acknowledge that there is little recourse if they object,
though some have discussed raising the issue with the Academy of
Television Arts &amp; Sciences, which presents the Emmy Awards.</TE>
<TE>   Some producers have joked that the obscure names affixed to many
production companies might be replaced by actual names, as in "John
Smith Productions," if the credit-elimination drive takes hold.
Schotz said that he has no plans to change the logo for his company,
whose initials--chosen more than a decade ago--stand for Leave My
Name Off.</TE>

<HD>A Mystery Cleverly Revisited</HD>
<DH>In 'The Cat's Meow,' Peter Bogdanovich looks at the strange
death of film pioneer Thomas Ince.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the enduring legends of Hollywood has it that William Randolph
Hearst mistakenly shot producer, director and studio founder Thomas
Ince aboard the newspaper tycoon's yacht when his intended target was
Charlie Chaplin, whom he believed was having an affair with his
mistress, film star Marion Davies. Rumor has always further had it
that gossip columnist Louella Parsons witnessed the shooting and was
rewarded a lifetime contract in return for her silence.</LD>
<LD>   Although the late George Eels, one of the best Hollywood
biographers and a tireless researcher, concluded in his entertaining
"Hedda and Louella" that Ince really did die as a result of acute
indigestion, as was widely reported, and persuasively argued that in
November 1924, when the incident occurred off the California coast,
Parsons, then a fledgling Hearst reporter, had yet to set foot in
California.</LD>
<TE>   In "The Cat's Meow," Peter Bogdanovich, who knows his Hollywood
history probably better than any other American director, works from
Steven Peros' amusing yet poignant script to tell the popular version
of the legend in clever and entertaining fashion, loaded with
authentic and convincing details. The vintage expression that gives
the movie its title is uttered by Ince (Cary Elwes) when he
contemplates the revels Hearst (Edward Herrmann) has planned for the
producer's birthday celebration aboard the mogul's splendiferous
yacht, the Oneida.</TE>
<TE>   At what is now Culver Studios, Ince had pioneered the modern
studio layout and system of moviemaking, and was a major director,
today sadly neglected. But by 1924 his career was on the skids, and
he was determined to try to save it by persuading Hearst to take him
on as a partner in Hearst's Cosmopolitan Pictures, supervising
production and at the same time keeping an eye on Davies (Kirsten
Dunst), the Ziegfeld Follies beauty Hearst worshipped and turned into
a big star.</TE>
<TE>   Countless people who knew Davies attest to her generosity and the
steadfast mutual devotion between her and the much older Hearst. It
is completely credible that Chaplin (Eddie Izzard), well known as a
womanizer, would be attracted to the radiant, unpretentious and
talented Davies--and would also be headstrong enough to risk Hearst's
jealous rage. In Bogdanovich's account, Chaplin, also a guest,
attempts to seduce Marion at every opportunity, but she fends him off
with as much humor and candor as she can muster, even though the
attraction is mutual.</TE>
<TE>   Also among the guests is Ince's mistress, aspiring actress
Margaret Livingston (Claudia Harrison), who strives to keep Ince
focused on her despite his urgent need to concentrate on lassoing
Hearst. Parsons (Jennifer Tilly) comes on gauche and gushy to the
point of caricature, but in time reveals the shrewd, confident woman
underneath. There are an assortment of other guests and staff,
including a couple of razzmatazz flappers, and none other than a
popular British writer of a certain age and aristocratic status,
Elinor Glyn (Joanna Lumley), whose racy novels were fodder for
Hollywood movies. She is best remembered for having declared that
Clara Bow possessed "it," which Madame Glyn was none too specific in
defining but which everyone understood to mean sex appeal of the
first magnitude. Glyn is the film's knowing observer, and "The Cat's
Meow" unfolds from her point of view.</TE>
<TE>   Bogdanovich is terrific at evoking the desperate gaiety of the
Roaring '20s, which hit Hollywood just as it was experiencing the
full impact of its worldwide power and influence. Hearst, whom
look-alike Herrmann portrays as a smart but childish man, and his
guests are depicted as tremendously vulnerable in their risky pursuit
of fame and fortune.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst, a great one for leading a Charleston, limits his guests to
one glass of illicit champagne at dinner, but once out of W.R.'s
sight, the bootleg booze flows (this was during Prohibition), as it
reputedly did at San Simeon behind closed doors. The atmosphere
aboard the Oneida is heady and reckless, and it's easy to believe
just about anything could happen.</TE>
<TE>   Not every actor resembles his real-life counterpart as well as
Herrmann, but Bogdanovich's people are so alive with personality and
dimension it doesn't matter. Izzard in fact looks far more like one
of Bogdanovich's heroes, Orson Welles, yet he suggests the brilliance
Chaplin surely had and a self-awareness as well. Dunst's Davies is
lovely, endearing and wise beyond her years. Not even on her best day
did the strong-jawed Glyn look as stunning as Lumley, but the actual
Madame Glyn was most likely as acute an observer of Hollywood follies
and foibles as Lumley portrays her. Elwes, Harrison and the various
other players are spot-on, right down the line.</TE>
<TE>   By and large, "The Cat's Meow" is relatively accurate as a period
piece, looks great and boasts a bevy of vintage numbers, some
original recordings and others performed in an authentic manner by
Ian Whitcomb and His Bungalow Boys.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to buy into Bogdanovich's version of what happened
aboard that yacht more than 77 years ago, but there is one catch:
Lita Grey Chaplin, continually referred to in the film but never
seen, always said that one of the most devastating moments of her
life occurred when she caught her husband, Charlie, in bed with
Davies, the one person in Hollywood who had reached out in friendship
to the teenage bride of a shotgun marriage.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for sexuality, a scene of violence and brief
drug use. Times guidelines: mature themes and situations.</TE>

around with his finished movies, even years after they've gone out
and made their billions. Spielberg is single-handedly screwing up the
concept of "director's cut."</LD>
<LD>   The successful rejiggering/reediting/re-release of "E.T. The
Extra-Terrestrial" has only encouraged him. If he's done "E.T." and
"Close Encounters of the Third Kind," can a toothier "Jaws," a more
scientifically correct "Jurassic Park" or an even longer "Schindler's
List" be far behind?</LD>
<LD>   Sure, you could lose Liam Neeson's Oscar-bait "I could have done
more" scene from "Schindler," maybe make the maudlin finale of
"Saving Private Ryan" less so.</LD>
<TE>   But Steve, Steve, Steve, why not go back and fix the broken films
in your back catalog? Remember those? You haven't always worn the
mantle "America's Greatest Living Filmmaker." Take a trip down Humble
Lane and recall all those movies critics and peers pummeled you over.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some suggestions, in order of urgency:</TE>
<TE>   "Amistad" (1997)--Edit in a better actor than Matthew McConaughey,
one who can hold his own with Anthony Hopkins and Morgan Freeman, one
who can manage a New England accent and one who doesn't look
ridiculous in granny glasses.</TE>
<TE>   "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" (1984)--Edit in some heart,
cut some violence and delete the shrieking blond. I don't care if
Kate Capshaw did become your wife. If you put her in "Indiana Jones
4," as is rumored, there's more deleting in your future, pal.</TE>
<TE>   "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" (1989)--Sean Connery is
supposed to replace the ancient knight guarding the Holy Grail at the
end. It's much more emotional that way. Fix that.</TE>
<TE>   "Empire of the Sun" (1987)--A tiny bit of cutting, maybe toning
down the saccharine and tightening up the narrative would help this
film, a child's view of World War II seen from a Japanese prison camp
in China. A lovely, underrated movie and very faithful to J.G.
Ballard's autobiographical novel.</TE>
<TE>   "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" (2001)--Stanley Kubrick would never
have made a movie this emotional, which is to your credit. But this
techno-humanist "Pinocchio" about the robot that wants to be a boy is
obscenely long, with an epilogue that seems to never end. Shorten the
Thunderdome scene of robot destruction, hack the ending, add more
Jude Law.</TE>
<TE>   "The Color Purple" (1985)--This movie seemed wrong-headed at the
time, but the 1983 Alice Walker novel was still considered sacrosanct
when the film came out. Shorten it, reemphasize the shots you
"borrowed" from John Ford's westerns, maybe try to mimic Walker's
style of narration. See how it plays now that Walker's novel has
settled on a lower rung on the literary pantheon.</TE>
<TE>   "Always" (1989)--Who convinced you that remaking the 1940s weeper
"A Guy Named Joe" was a good idea? Swap out that awful actor who
plays Holly Hunter's love interest, Brad Johnson, the one the ghost
of Richard Dreyfuss keeps trying to save as he fights forest fires.
Heck, cut everything in this bomb except for the Audrey
Hepburn-as-an-angel scene.</TE>
<TE>   "1941" (1979)--This comic account of California panic after Pearl
Harbor always struck me as salvageable. You shot miles of footage,
included lots of hilarious stuff, but lost your way in the cutting
room. Revisit it; remember that wonderful, jaunty John Williams
score. Forget the ordeal it was to make it, forget all the (alleged)
cocaine excesses of some of the cast. Rescue John Belushi's "Wild
Bill" Kelso from himself. And for God's sake, shorten it. The current
"director's cut" is two hours and 26 minutes long.</TE>

<LD>   'Star Wars' Mania Strikes Fans, Knowles</LD>
<LD>   About 70 die-hard "Star Wars" fans--organized by the Web site
LiningUp.net--have pitched camp near Hollywood's landmark Grauman's
Chinese Theatre, more than a month before the May 16 premiere of
"Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones."</LD>
<TE>   The ritual began in 1999 when fans, some from as far as Australia,
banded together to form a ticket line six weeks before the last film
in the sci-fi series opened, said event organizer Peter Genovese.</TE>
<TE>   Those camping out won't be the first to see the movie, however.
Harry Knowles, the online movie critic, recently published a review
of an unfinished print that, he claims, he saw last month.</TE>
<TE>   Someone passed a note to him at an event promoting his new book,
inviting him to a hotel room to watch it, he says. He went, convinced
that agents of Lucasfilm, the production company of director George
Lucas, would "knock down the door." They didn't, and his rave review
of the movie ran on his Web site, aint-it-cool-news.com.</TE>
<TE>   After reading the piece, one chat room surfer jokingly commented:
"Breaking News: Lucas has 500 employees arrested, along with Harry
Knowles. All are tortured, locked in a room with 50 stinky unwashed
flannel shirts, until someone cracks and reveals who smuggled the
film out."</TE>
<TE>   Another was more skeptical: "You naive idiots, Lucas ... ARRANGED
for Harry to see the rough cut. It's a masterful PR ploy on their
part...."</TE>
<TE>   Lucasfilm declined to comment.</TE>

<TE>   Israeli Consul Delivers Plea for Solidarity</TE>
<TE>   In a fervent appeal to Hollywood's creative talent to stand with
Israel in its hour of need, Israeli Consul General Yuval Rotem urged
directors and actors to show their faces in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking Wednesday evening at the opening gala of the 18th annual
Israel Film Festival, held at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences, Rotem asked the audience, "Where have you been?</TE>
<TE>   "We need to see you with us when times are hard. You don't know
how much your presence would mean to us to raise our morale and help
us re-embrace life once again."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 900 members of the American and Israeli film industry
attended the event, which will continue through April 25 with
screenings of 31 feature films, documentaries and TV specials at
Laemmle's Music Hall in Beverly Hills and Laemmle's Town Center 5 in
Encino.</TE>

<TE>   Columbia Sued for Digital Alteration</TE>
<TE>   The owners of several Times Square buildings have filed a lawsuit
against the makers of the upcoming "Spider-Man" movie for digitally
altering a sign appearing in the motion picture. The sign was an
advertisement for Samsung, a competitor of Sony, the owner of
Columbia Pictures, which is distributing the movie.</TE>
<TE>   In a lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court, the owners allege
that Columbia digitally replaced the Samsung ad on the side of the
building with one for USA Today. The sign appears three times in the
film, according to court papers.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's inappropriate to substitute your own image for the
one that exists," Anthony Costantini, a lawyer for the building
owners, told the New York Daily News.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Columbia Pictures in Los Angeles declined to
comment. The movie, starring Tobey Maguire as the superhero, opens
May 3.</TE>

<TE>   Montreal Symphony Conductor Resigns</TE>
<TE>   Charles Dutoit, the celebrated artistic director who made the
Montreal Symphony Orchestra a world-class band, has resigned.</TE>
<TE>   After 25 years on the job, he said in a statement, he reached his
decision after the president of the Quebec Musicians' Guild accused
him of a pattern of abusive and arbitrary behavior on the conducting
podium. There was also concern about his dismissal of two musicians.</TE>
<TE>   "Sadly, the reality of life in the MSO for most players is ...
unrelenting harassment, condescension and humiliation by a man whose
autocratic behavior has become intolerable," union president Emile
Subirana said in an open letter to the media, adding that "the vast
majority" of the MSO's 100 musicians had voiced dissatisfaction over
Dutoit for excessive criticism of their work.</TE>
<TE>   The fracas came after the announcement of the 2002-03 season that
was to celebrate Dutoit's quarter-century at the podium. Relations
between him and the orchestra had been frosty since the 1998
musicians' strike that led to touring and recording contractual
provisions with which the conductor was unhappy.</TE>

<LD>National Public Radio announced an overhaul of its cultural
programming Thursday, saying it wants to strengthen its West Coast
presence, diversify its reporting, and make the network's arts and
entertainment shows more appealing to stations and listeners.</LD>
<LD>   NPR now has only one cultural reporter outside Washington, in New
York, but the organization plans to put at least two in its new Los
Angeles production center when that opens in September, said Ken
Stern, NPR executive vice president.</LD>
<LD>   The network is also streamlining its cultural staff, a move Stern
said will bring more arts reporting to NPR's newsmagazines and not
restrict it to the network's culture shows.</LD>
<TE>   In the reorganization, NPR is eliminating 15 jobs but said it will
try to move those people to other positions before the changes take
effect in August.</TE>
<TE>   NPR is changing "Performance Today" (which airs locally weekdays
at 11 a.m. on KCSN-FM [88.5]) to focus mainly on performances and
concerts.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Light overtakes form in Michael Norton's paintings, the same way it
does in the exquisite skies of British landscape painter J.M.W.
Turner. In fact, Norton's paintings evoke not only the appearance of
that quasi-abstract space, but the sensation of entering it and
immersing oneself in its radiance. Free of context, external subject
or narrative framework, what's experienced is color and pure,
rapturous light.</LD>
<LD>   Hints of trees and water emerge in Norton's engrossing new
paintings at ACME, but less often than in his work from several years
ago. The palette too feels bolder, more assertive. These are intimate
portraits of atmospheres, luminous temperaments ranging from foggy
whispers to fiery pulsations. Painting all along the rounded edges of
the panels reinforces the sense that these are extractions from vast,
continuous fields.</LD>
<LD>   A bright luminescence at the core of each field acts as a summons,
beckoning the eye into deep, amorphous space. Darker or simply more
opaque colors (mostly blue, slate, green or gray) loosely frame the
intense light.</LD>
<TE>   Norton conjures distance and movement brilliantly, in one
painting, by pairing the electric complementary colors of blue and
orange, and, throughout all of the works, by the consistent finesse
of his brushwork in egg tempera. Crisp, concentrated edges bring
diluted passages to a close; shadows accrete into palpable densities.</TE>
<TE>   The passage of the paint mimics organic processes of
sedimentation, condensation and evaporation. In places it seems fluid
as a veil; in others, like a fine-grain crust. Every surface is a
performance of echoes and breaths.</TE>
<TE>   These paintings, untitled and unanchored as they are, evoke the
immersive effects of installations by James Turrell or Robert Irwin.
They embrace fully, even on their relatively small scale (tondos
barely more than 1 foot in diameter, rectangles under 2 feet per
side).</TE>
<TE>   Light, space and personal encounter define Norton's work, which is
essentially experiential. While the paintings can be read as
depictions of clouds or mists, the more interesting dynamic is that
between surface and image, revelation and obfuscation. They
demand--and well reward--a long, close study.</TE>

<TE>   Dealing With Gravity</TE>
<TE>   in All Its Meanings</TE>
<TE>   What does physical gravity, the tug of the Earth's core, have to
do with emotional gravity, a seriousness of import? And what about
gravity's opposite--levity? Does lightness in weight equate to
frivolity of purpose?</TE>
<TE>   In her thoroughly absorbing new work at Angles Gallery, Kelly
McLane mixes and matches meanings and their visual referents. As
disjunctive as they are, the scenes in her drawings and paintings,
together with their titles, have a dark, punning logic when parsed.
In their curious mix of the banal, the comic and the disastrous, they
blur the line between nature and our incursions into it.</TE>
<TE>   They provoke us into asking whether anything we do can be
considered unnatural, if we ourselves are natural beings. In the
stunning triptych "The Nature of Gravity," gravity works both ways,
pulling a plane down from the sky to utterly grave consequence. Like
all of McLane's work here, whether painted or drawn, these three
paintings are so light of touch that one cannot read them in their
entirety from a distance.</TE>
<TE>   The canvases must be considered one at a time, from close
proximity, which causes their impact to unfurl gradually, as if we
are witnessing a cataclysm in the unreal time of slow motion. All
three panels are predominantly white, with a low horizon marked by
trees. Working in small, linear strokes, and often leaving large
areas unarticulated, McLane exercises meticulous control over the
variable intensity within her images.</TE>
<TE>   Selectively heightening detail and adding washes of pale color,
she guides the eye through each scene with directorial cunning. In
the left painting of the triptych, an airplane noses out of the pale,
clouded sky. In the right, the fuselage rests with eerie calm on a
nest of broken tree trunks, its gray seats spilling out like so many
decayed teeth. The plane downed in rural Pennsylvania on Sept. 11
immediately comes to mind, adding credibility to the work's chilling,
elegiac beauty.</TE>
<TE>   Leisure and terror--the light and the heavy--mix again and again
in McLane's hushed, haunting images. Striped circus tents and spunky
carnival booths promise escapist entertainment. A duck flies south
with an arrow piercing its breast. Balloons and blimps hover
overhead. Every being seems to seek escape of some sort, either from
the physical or the psychic gravity of life on earth.</TE>
<TE>   McLane's work affirms, though, that there is ultimately a quirky
continuity to it all, and no real possibility for escape. We might
try to defy nature, but all we do, in the end, remains part of it.</TE>

<TE>   A Photographer Who Embraces Transparency</TE>
<TE>   Transparency seems an unlikely, even impossible, notion to build
an artistic sensibility around, but that is exactly how Nobuyoshi
Araki describes his intent. One of Japan's most celebrated
photographers--a cult figure, in fact--Araki shoots with the
regularity and seeming effortlessness of breathing, or better yet,
blinking. He photographs incessantly, diaristically, sometimes
papering gallery and museum walls with his images in a continuous,
floor-to-ceiling grid. "Sometimes I feel like a parasite on life," he
has said, "draining it with my camera."</TE>
<TE>   Araki's passion for the act of recording comes through in the
quantity of images he makes, but not always very clearly in the
character of the images themselves. In his show of Polaroids at Low
Gallery, the pictures (more than 350 of them) fall within just a few
thematic categories--mostly flowers and women--but resist any
unifying interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   The flowers are all cut, in arrangements. Some are fresh, some
tired, browning around the edges. Araki photographs them with a
casual disregard for composition. Sometimes a smudgy shadow hovers
behind the flowers, sometimes the edge of the frame cuts them off.</TE>
<TE>   Araki is similarly matter-of-fact in his pictures of women, even
when they appear in anything but mundane ways. Nearly all appear nude
or partially so, and most adopt sexually explicit poses--legs spread,
on hands and knees, and the like. Some, including a pregnant woman,
are bound in rope.</TE>
<TE>   To an American audience, these pictures smack of amateurish
pornography. Even in Japan, Araki has been charged multiple times
with obscenity, although the public landscape there allows a far
broader range of erotic imagery. In this body of work, just as many
aesthetic as sexual taboos are broken, even if not for the first
time.</TE>
<TE>   The Tokyo-based Araki has been exhibiting and publishing
prolifically since the 1960s, and his work and life suggest one
all-embracing conceptual project, somewhere between John Baldessari
and Andy Warhol. He is said to use sentiment as a structural
device--and certainly he does in other bodies of work, especially the
extended portrait of his late wife. But his real operating principle
here is banality.</TE>
<TE>   The profoundly visual quality of contemporary urban life both
stimulates and numbs, sensationalizes and trivializes. Araki's work
mirrors this process and the bland democracy of images that results.
His so-called transparency is most interesting as a cultural
phenomenon, a byproduct of photography's ubiquity. For him, it's a
workable philosophy: "Ultimately, my idea about shooting is, what the
hell? Move, touch, talk, sweat and embarrass myself. Expose myself
and act like a fool."</TE>

<TE>   Landscape Imagery Reduced to Kitsch</TE>
<TE>   Tom Allen's recent paintings at Richard Telles Fine Art would be
funny if they weren't so maddening. Intentionally wrong in all the
"right" ways, they forsake emotion for strategy and authenticity for
kitsch. They are relentlessly hip, eliciting that knowing smile and
nod that are supposed to compensate for the artist's failure to offer
something more substantive.</TE>
<TE>   Allen, a recent Art Center graduate living in Pasadena, has
assembled in these six paintings a mini-glossary of the romantic
landscape: tempestuous sea, brooding sky, nostalgic ruins, ominous
crows and a lighthouse, as a beacon of hope. Painters from Caspar
David Friedrich to Albert Pinkham Ryder have transformed this
standard set of ingredients into sublime delicacies, meditations of
the soul and spirit.</TE>
<TE>   Allen dishes them out as fast-food parody. His painting is clumsy,
whether purposefully or not, and his palette lurid.</TE>
<TE>   In the largest painting, "This Sea Ignoble," clouds of black,
purple and crimson generate excessive streaks of lightning, jagged
spidery veins in lavender and pink. Rays of pale peach light course
through the mottled sky, turning a distant patch of sea flamingo
pink. The painting's a gaudy mess.</TE>
<TE>   The other, smaller works here--of birds resting on a craggy
branch, a hollowed-out tree stump, an ice-encrusted windmill--are
equally garish but register fewer decibels. All extenuate the real
landscape past the point of convention into the realm of caricature
and cliche. Allen's efforts are theatrical, but it's a form of
theater that entails little risk. Making fun of beauty (or real
feeling or meaning) is, after all, safer than giving in to it.</TE>

<HD>Innovative Russian Lyricism in 'Romeo and Juliet'</HD>
<DH>The Perm State Ballet's performance trades familiar plot
for plenty of dancing and emotion.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most ballets set to Prokofiev's "Romeo and Juliet" retell the events
of Shakespeare's play in a literal, ponderous style based on the
narrative conventions of such full-evening 19th century classics as
"Giselle" and "Swan Lake." Not the audacious Nikolai Boyarchikov
version danced by the Perm State Ballet (Russia's third-largest
ballet company) at the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Like the score, Boyarchikov's 1972 choreography belongs wholly to
the 20th century, and in its best moments it might be called
"Star-Crossed Variations," for it spends less time working through
the familiar plot than using it to launch extended classical
meditations on the characters' emotions.</LD>
<LD>   The result is a shock: no pseudo-operatic verismo or scenic
clutter. No dancing whores in the marketplace scene. No balcony in
the balcony scene, no bed in the bedroom scene, no tomb in the tomb
scene. Instead, designer Alla Kozhenkova frames the action with gauzy
Renaissance arches and uses different central panels to suggest
specific locales. The stage stays wide open for dancing.</LD>
<TE>   At the beginning, end and at every major juncture of the love
story, Boyarchikov deploys five couples in gleaming
white--embodiments of love's young dream, perhaps, and certainly of
sublime Russian lyricism. You have never seen longer limbs or necks
in your life and their purity of style as they circle the lovers and
embroider their dancing is one of Boyarchikov's most successful
achievements.</TE>
<TE>   In what's usually a mime-dominated scene in which Juliet gets a
sleeping potion from Friar Laurence, the narrative becomes suspended
for a bold, feverish and very Russian fantasia involving Juliet's
visions of Romeo, Lord Capulet, Paris, Tybalt and Mercutio along with
flowers that become major symbols of life and death. You have to like
dancing to accept Boyarchikov's innovations; he's always working to
get inside the story choreographically.</TE>
<TE>   There are also plenty of lapses: an overload of happy peasants in
poster colors, occasional descents into conventional balletic
melodrama, inconsistencies in how characters die. Mercutio (the
touchingly boyish Nikolai Vyuzhanin), for instance, simply walks away
from life, while a few moments later, Tybalt (the impressively
forceful Radiy Miniakhmetov) collapses and plays dead.</TE>
<TE>   The house program inflicts abundant injuries on Shakespeare
("Friar Laureate") but is especially remiss in not telling the
audience who's cast in the key roles. Natalia Moiseeva of the perfect
placement, spectacular jump and impossibly high, easy extension
hardly deserves to remain anonymous as Juliet.</TE>
<TE>   Although she does not explore character growth so much as exude a
fragile sweetness that becomes shattered long before the final scene,
Moiseeva dances up to the highest international standard in the role.</TE>
<TE>   As Romeo, Vitaly Poleschuk partners her ardently but brings
nothing special to the role technically or dramatically. Roman Geer
makes a stronger impression as Paris, and the Capulet parents (Igor
Shesterikov and Irina Kozyntseva) are very strongly cast.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody dances in this "Romeo and Juliet," including the
Montagues and, unfortunately, the Nurse (Elena Morozova), a different
kind of caricature than usual but a caricature nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to choreograph Shakespearean abstractions inevitably
depend on what you throw away as much as what you invent. Boyarchikov
was still in his 30s when he created this rebuke to Socialist Realism
and he arguably threw away too little. But the quality of his
invention makes it superior to the better known Yuri Grigorovich
abstract "Romeo and Juliet" for the Bolshoi seven years later.</TE>
<TE>   Apart from unreliable brass, the playing of the company orchestra
under Valery Platonov sustains urgency through every formalist foray
into Shakespearean dance-poetry. In its second visit to the
Southland, the Perm State Ballet has brought us something truly
original and surprising.</TE>

<HD>With a 'New Best Friend' Like This ...</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes there are very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed
in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely. "New Best Friend"
wrapped production three years ago, and no one until now has thought
it prudent to release its disorienting contents upon the
unsuspecting--and largely undeserving--rabble. Why now seems to be
any better time than, say, last August, to let impressionable
post-adolescents see what a lethal bacchanalia campus life can be in
the 21st century is beyond any rational explanation.</LD>
<LD>   So is much of what passes for a narrative in this roughhousing
suds machine, in which the soft-spoken, callow sheriff (Taye Diggs)
of a Southern college town is asked to "discreetly, delicately" find
out why Alicia Glazer (Mia Kirshner), a student on financial aid, is
comatose and near death from a drug overdose.</LD>
<LD>   Her distraught mother puts most of the blame on the "rich kids"
with whom Alicia suddenly cast her lot.</LD>
<TE>   Three especially snooty--and sexy--sorority sisters are singled
out for interrogation: Sidney (Dominique Swain), Julianne (Rachel
True) and Hadley (Meredith Monroe). (Think of "Josie and the
Pussycats" as Satan's spawn, and you get the idea.) Of the three,
it's the sultry, irrepressibly blond Hadley who piques the sheriff's
interest, because it was she who, for reasons actually related to
schoolwork, brought the previously shy, retiring, working-class drone
Alicia into their inner circle, where she mutated into a glamorously
attired, drug-gorging, backstabbing barracuda. In short, one of them.</TE>
<TE>   The movie struggles awkwardly to bring a twist or two to its hoary
class-conscious story line, aiming for a subtlety in character
development that's smothered by excessive kitsch and kink. In the
end, you don't know what to think of Alicia or her chic-trash fellow
travelers.</TE>
<TE>   You'd like to think that such confusion is deliberate, veering
away from "easy" conclusions. But "New Best Friend" doesn't seem
smart enough for that.</TE>
<TE>   At any rate, it's nice to see Diggs in a film that doesn't require
him take his shirt off and even suggest a new way for a black man to
be a crime solver in a movie.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, if you want to see young people struggling with the
vagaries of status buffoonery, "Heathers" (1986) remains the movie to
beat.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong sexuality, language and drug use.</TE>

<HD>From Canada, 'In on It' Plays Electrifying Games With
Narrative</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some of the most stimulating theater in L.A. in 2002 has been
imported from Canada as part of the UCLA Live series.</LD>
<LD>   This week offers a brief opportunity to see "In on It," from
Toronto-based da da kamera. It's almost as much a must-see event for
theater lovers as Robert Lepage's "the far side of the moon," also
presented at the Freud Playhouse, was earlier this year.</LD>
<LD>   "In on It" is much shorter and less adorned than its Canadian
predecessor. There is no set to speak of, but the lighting and sound
designs are elaborate.</LD>
<TE>   Two men--writer-director Daniel MacIvor and Darren O'Donnell--make
up the cast, but they play many characters.</TE>
<TE>   In one narrative strand, a man is given an unsettling diagnosis by
his doctor, an equally harsh sentence by his wife, a self-absorbed
reaction from his son and assorted other reactions from his wife's
lover's family members. Both actors take turns playing the central
character, depending on which other characters appear in the same
scene, but the passing of the sick man's jacket helps delineate who's
who.</TE>
<TE>   That story is interrupted to show us a director and an actor
rehearsing a play based on it. We also go back to an enactment of the
original meeting between the director and the actor and their
subsequent, now-ended romance, in which the above-mentioned jacket
again plays an important symbolic role.</TE>
<TE>   The three levels of narrative intersect and intertwine. But the
script has been constructed so ingeniously and the performances are
so precise that seldom do more than a few seconds pass before you
comprehend which level you're on.</TE>
<TE>   "In on It" may sound stagy and artificial, and MacIvor never wants
us to forget we're in a theater. But "stagy" should not be construed
as "over-emotive." The production is replete with sly
understatement--and with a few strokes of laugh-out-loud comedy.</TE>
<TE>   Let's just say that you will never again hear Lesley Gore's
"Sunshine, Lollipops" without thinking of the goofy dance routine
that accompanies it in this play.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the artifice, the show's thematic concerns are very real.
Among them, established from the beginning of the script, is the idea
that some events are planned and others unplanned.</TE>
<TE>   The unplanned side of the ledger includes, in this case, the idea
that a suicidal someone might take a stranger down with him. "In on
It" played in New York last fall, just a few weeks after Sept. 11,
which must have made it seem downright eerie.</TE>
<TE>   The play is also about attempts to control the uncontrollable,
particularly as manifested in theater. "In on It" was developed for
years and reflects rigorous polishing, but by nature of the way the
script is constructed, it also retains the appearance of spontaneity.
This mix of qualities creates an enviable sense of electricity
flowing between the actors and between the cast and the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Four performances of "In on It" in L.A. are not enough. Let's hope
that the audiences include someone who is in a position to bring it
back for a longer run.</TE>
<TE>   "In on It," Freud Playhouse, northeast corner of the UCLA campus,
near Sunset Boulevard and Hilgard Avenue. Today and Saturday, 8 p.m.
$30. (310) 825-2101. Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes.</TE>

<HD>'Refrigerators' Retails a Strained Take on the Mixed-Up
'60s</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Three women, each seeking to buy the same kind of refrigerator,
converge on a store in 1964, only to discover that model is out of
stock. While a novice salesman (Tony Lee) attempts to locate the
coveted appliance, the women chat. Soon we're watching episodic
reenactments of the events that led each to the store.</LD>
<LD>   So goes Judy Soo Hoo's "Refrigerators." Produced by Lodestone
Theatre Ensemble at East Los Angeles College, it's an intriguing but
ultimately strained reflection on the mixed-up, half-feminist,
half-retro zeitgeist of that era.</LD>
<LD>   Apple (Kelly Miyashiro) is a would-be traditional housewife--apple
pie and all. But her husband (Tim Lounibos), who caused a terrible
accident, doesn't quite measure up to Ward Cleaver.</LD>
<TE>   Crystal (Elaine Kao) is an impatient divorcee whose husband was
stolen by her sister (May Wang). When they're not at each other's
throats, they're investigating family secrets about their parents'
past in an internment camp for Japanese Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Although mousy Grace (Rachel Morihiro) still lives with her brassy
mother (Jeanne Sakata, who doesn't look nearly as old as advertised),
she's beginning to fall in love with a woman (Melody Butiu) who
coincidentally is hired as her mother's massage therapist.</TE>
<TE>   Staged breezily by Jennifer J. Yun, the three stories give the
play a plot-heavy yet sketchy feeling. The attempt to bring them
together in the scenes at the store feels about as airtight as a
refrigerator with the door left ajar.</TE>
<TE>   Don Shirley</TE>
<TE>   "Refrigerators," East Los Angeles College, 1301 Avenida Cesar
Chavez, Monterey Park. Fridays-Saturdays, 8:30 p.m.; Saturdays, 2:30
p.m.; Sundays, 7:30 p.m. $13. (323) 993-7245. Running time: 2 hours,
5 minutes.</TE>

<TE>   Infidelity Proves to Be More Than 'Just Sex'</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight's theme is honesty," declares the hostess at the outset
of a truth-telling game that will ultimately lead her guests to a
spouse-swapping experiment. Despite some dubious sitcom contrivance
in setting up his premise, writer-director Jeff Gould finds his way
to emotional authenticity with his engaging new serious comedy "It's
Just Sex," at the Whitefire Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   In updating "Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice" for a more jaded and
conservative era, Gould skillfully plays to his principal draws--a
racy theme, an attractive cast and breezy if sometimes glib
one-liners. But having locked in the attention of his audience, Gould
uses the opportunity for some provocative reflections on the
consequences of consensual infidelity.</TE>
<TE>   The first act is spent building up the circumstances that would
allow three couples to turn one of their regular unadventurous
get-togethers into an orgy. Each marriage has its stress points: a
stuck-up programmer (Craig Woolson) and a controlling lawyer (Daintry
Jensen) in a sexual dry spell; a hedonistic writer (Bruce Nozick) and
a masseuse (Summer Mahoney) unable to focus on deeper issues; and the
hostess (Kristin Carey) who has just caught her husband (Stephen
Meadows) with a hooker (Amanda Swisten).</TE>
<TE>   In setting up these characters and their problems, Gould resorts
to clunky, sometimes artificial scripting. The series of establishing
scenes for each couple is particularly labored--everything we need to
know about their tensions could be suggested more naturally at the
start of the gathering.</TE>
<TE>   Some heavy-handedness undermines believability--Carey's digs at
Meadows telegraph her cold fury so obviously that it would be
impossible for her guests to relax and ignore it, let alone follow
her lead into territory full of emotional landmines. Yet Carey also
turns in the most affecting performance (Nozick and Jensen are the
other standouts). Gould could improve his play with more trust in his
capable actors and the power of subtle suggestion.</TE>
<TE>   The piece hits its stride in the second act, where the characters
are unable to compartmentalize the escapade as a meaningless
indulgence, and are forced to deal with the fallout in sharply
focused confrontations. In addition to his insightful dialogue, Gould
refrains from facile moralizing.</TE>
<TE>   Frankly acknowledging the impossibility of separating sexuality
from issues of loyalty and respect for a partner's feelings, he
nevertheless refuses to pass judgment on the couples' experiment. For
some of them, it turns out to be a good thing, for others, a
catastrophe--but in no case is it innocuous. It's never just sex.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Brandes</TE>
<TE>   "It's Just Sex," Whitefire Theatre, 13500 Ventura Blvd., Sherman
Oaks. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. (dark this
Sunday). Ends May 19. $20. (818) 487-7391. Running time: 2 hours, 5
minutes.</TE>

<TE>   Vaudeville-Style Revue Celebrates Diversity</TE>
<TE>   Vaudeville returns in a revamped form in "The Rainbow Revue,"
which salutes American freedom and individual accomplishment as it
spotlights talent from the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender
communities.</TE>
<TE>   Sincere intention and hard work are much in evidence, and
diversity is a watchword. These two dozen singers, dancers and
stand-up comics are a rainbow coalition in a multicultural as well as
a gay-pride sense.</TE>
<TE>   But while these performers would do themselves proud at a local
amateur night, they don't add up to the Broadway-level entertainment
that creator-producer Matt Gatson, director Kevin Vavasseur and the
rest of the show's creators would like to think they've assembled at
the New Ivar Theatre in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   And as the show tries to be something it isn't, it ends up
undermining its performers.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, dance routines are layered onto most of the singers'
performances. Choreographed by Bart Doerfler and executed by five
hard-bodied dancers--four male, one female--these routines add
sizzle, yet they upstage the vocalists every time. When a singer
named Sire closes the first act with a '70s funk reworking of the
Cole Porter classic "Love for Sale," he's mere sonic wallpaper for a
sexy bowler-hat-and-chairs dance routine lifted from the Bob Fosse
canon.</TE>
<TE>   Sound levels also are a problem: Once again, the
singers--including Jackie Moreno performing "Paraiso," David McNutt
belting "You Don't Know Me" and Charley Geary singing "Lluvia
Sensual"--are the losers, as they are overpowered by the versatile
and otherwise wonderful house band: eight instrumentalists on horns,
electric guitars and bass, drums and keyboard.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, some nice surprises shine through: an a cappella,
close-harmony, doo-wop rendition of the Gershwin standard "I Got
Rhythm," by Ronn Jones, Marss Ramos and Ryan San Diego; a sultry
rendition of the Peggy Lee hit "Fever," in which Jennifer Moore
alternates between vocals and trumpet; and stand-up routines peppered
with sharp-tongued observations about lesbian and gay life by Carmela
Nudo and David Pavao.</TE>
<TE>   But in many ways, the best act is the simplest: The grandfatherly
Dick Post delivers a brief but poignant overview of lesbian and gay
history, as woven into the nation's emergence, then sings a little
ditty that urges: "Don't despair/hang in there/and be gay." He caps
this off by unfurling an American flag.</TE>

<LD>   And boy, oh boy, it's a howler, a textbook example of how the
tagline "based on a true story" can be a come-on for the most
artificial artistic impulses.</LD>
<LD>   The directing debut of Brigham Young University grad Mitch Davis,
"The Other Side of Heaven" is an unabashed Mormon propaganda piece
disguised as an adventure film.</LD>
<TE>   The film recounts the spiritual initiation of John Groberg
(Christopher Gorham), an Idaho native who leaves behind an adoring
girlfriend (Anne Hathaway) and his beloved alma mater in the 1950s to
cut his teeth as a missionary in the South Seas kingdom of Tonga.</TE>
<TE>   The young Groberg (who today serves as an elder of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) instantly captivates the natives
with his congenial air, his abiding faith and his funny-adorable bag
of malapropisms.</TE>
<TE>   Facing down a never-ending litany of challenges with only a Bible
and his seat-of-the-pants gumption, Groberg faith-heals an ostensibly
deceased young native boy back to life and steers hard-drinking
island rowdies from the ways of Satan.</TE>
<TE>   The apex of thrillingly awful moments occurs when Groberg presides
over the lagoon-water baptism of a Tongan teenage girl, saving her
soul in the nick of time while just offshore, a bevy of misguided
island lasses is deflowered by a boatload of rum-running seamen.</TE>
<TE>   "The Other Side of Heaven" is the most unambiguous in a recent
spate of broad-market films about the other love that dare not speak
its name in Hollywood, the worship of God. Not since English
missionary Ingrid Bergman saved the Chinese from their basest
instincts in "Inn of the Sixth Happiness" can we recall such a
narcissistic screen spectacle of white Christian chauvinism versus
the dark-skinned heathen.</TE>
<TE>   Only more grotesque than the film's clueless air of
self-congratulation is the screenplay's square-as-"Father Knows Best"
sense of humor, which the director has ostensibly incorporated from
Groberg's memoirs. The whole trippy experience is like being held at
gunpoint by a Jehovah's Witness at the front door while George Gobel
holds forth in the living room on Nickelodeon.</TE>

<HD>'The Piano Teacher' Hits a Risky Emotional Key</HD>
<DH>Powerful performances from Isabelle Huppert and Benoit
Magimel sketch a dark portrait of repression and potential
redemption.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before the opening credits are over for "The Piano Teacher," director
Michael Haneke has captured the dynamics of the relationship between
Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) and her mother (Annie Girardot). Three
hours have passed since Erika gave her last piano lesson at Vienna's
conservatory, and her mother, with whom she shares an apartment in an
old building, hasn't heard from her.</LD>
<LD>   When Erika arrives home, her mother is both frantic and enraged;
the two strike out at each other, exchange harsh words, but
eventually the daughter crumples into tears. Even though Erika, drab
and 40ish, has her own room, she and her mother sleep next to each
other in twin beds in the master bedroom. Erika's father, we soon
learn, has some time ago descended into madness and is
institutionalized.</LD>
<TE>   In adapting Elfriede Jelinek's 1983 novel, Haneke takes us and
Erika on a harrowing journey in this taut, stark, sometimes bleakly
funny and altogether dazzling film. Erika's mother could scarcely be
more dominating or possessive, and she still dreams of triumphs for
her daughter on the concert stage. At the conservatory, Erika is the
severest, most exacting of instructors and has a profound
intellectual grasp of music, with Schumann and Schubert her favorite
composers. Yet because of her consummate skill and knowledge, Erika,
who puts her hair in a bun, goes without makeup and wears the
plainest of clothes, is much in demand.</TE>
<TE>   Although Erika makes a remark that suggests she feels she could be
losing her mind, there is no reason to suspect that her repressed
existence won't continue in the same rigid pattern. Then along comes
Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel), a handsome engineering student who
happens to be a talented pianist. Walter can see that Erika is a
beauty despite her dull appearance, and he is bright and
sophisticated enough to parry with Erika intellectually. Her icy
aloofness challenges Walter, who auditions successfully at the
conservatory so that he can study with her.</TE>
<TE>   His confident charm, obvious brains and talent, good looks and
ardor are not lost on Erika, but she is such an emotional cripple
that her attraction to Walter unleashes an avalanche of sexual
aberrations that express the terrible distortions of her upbringing.
Haneke explores these aberrations exhaustively but not
exploitatively, and Erika's twisted psyche gives way to the sad
larger truth that music does not seem to thrill her or give her
pleasure. For her, teaching piano is a means of obsessively pursuing
perfection to fill up an empty, emotionally starved existence. Erika
realizes that from early childhood she has been expected to sacrifice
her life for music, but there is a real question about whether she
can deal with the love Walter offers her.</TE>
<TE>   It took more than 15 years for Haneke, best known for his 1997
shocker "Funny Games" and a master at delineating alienated,
emotionally frigid individuals, to to make "The Piano Teacher." He
refused to make it without Huppert and cited her remarkable range
that allows her to travel easily and swiftly from the pathetically
vulnerable to the formidably intellectual. It is surely one of her
most challenging roles.</TE>
<TE>   Huppert won the best actress prize at Cannes last year, and
Magimel, who can match Huppert at every turn, took the best actor
award; the film itself won the grand jury prize. Despite these prizes
and more, "The Piano Teacher" will surely be too strong for some
audiences and is best left to those who like films that take big
risks and get away with them.</TE>

language, adult themes and situations.</TE>

<HD>Thriller 'Outta Time' Unwinds at a Hectic Pace</HD>
<DH>A collegian who agrees to run serum across the border is
pursued in a Hitchcock-style story from the makers of 'Eastside.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years ago producer Mark Roberts, director Lorena David and actor
Mario Lopez teamed up for a well-made melodrama, "Eastside," in which
Lopez played a young man caught working in a chop shop who uses a
two-year stretch in Folsom to study the stock market.</LD>
<LD>   Roberts, David and the charismatic Lopez, perhaps best known for
starring in the Greg Louganis TV bio and the TV show "Saved by the
Bell," now have re-teamed for "Outta Time," a modest but entertaining
Hitchcock-style thriller.</LD>
<LD>   Unafraid of improbability and coincidence, writers Ned Kerwin &amp;
Scott Duncan pile on nonstop action that keeps up a furious pace
without giving the viewer time to ponder its credibility.</LD>
<TE>   Lopez's likable David Morales is a soccer whiz who has made it out
of a Tijuana slum into an American state university on an athletic
scholarship. His attractive widowed mother, Gloriana (Dyana Ortelli),
works days as a receptionist in a Tijuana clinic and nights as a bar
waitress to help out her son and to maintain a neat, modest home, to
which he returns on frequent visits. Despite a breakup with his
girlfriend (Tava Smiley), David is definitely on the right track when
he's derailed by a knee injury that costs him his scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   Just as he is assimilating this disastrous turn of events, David
crosses paths with Jonas Darabont, a former professor at the
university who explains that he owns a local biotech lab and needs
someone to transport some serum across the border so it can be tested
on animals outside the range of California's vigilant animal rights
activists.</TE>
<TE>   Played by the always estimable John Saxon, Darabont is most
convincing. Yes, what he's asking David to do is illegal, but think
of the lives that could be saved through this research. What's more,
in the unlikely event that David, who is friendly with the border
guards and is never stopped, is caught, the worst that could happen
to him is a fine.</TE>
<TE>   Best of all, of course, is that the generous pay for these
deliveries will mean David can afford to stay in school.</TE>
<TE>   After agreeing to the plan, David quickly becomes a man on the
run, with a bad knee to boot. All the while, various people are in
pursuit, corpses are piling up, and there's a potential romance with
a gorgeous runaway (Ali Landry) from a rich family.</TE>
<TE>   The filmmakers have done a nifty job in all respects, and Lopez,
who manages a relaxed charm and an easy sense of humor in the midst
of frantic events, gives further evidence that he's more than ready
for bigger films. Landry is lovely and witty, and Nancy O'Dell makes
the most amusingly ruthless doctor Harvard's medical school ever
produced. Carlos Mencia is warmly endearing as David's staunch best
friend. Richard Lynch, who played the good guy in "Eastside," returns
here as a ferocious villain.</TE>
<TE>   "Outta Time" benefits strongly from Lisa Wiegand's dynamic camera
work.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language and violence. Times guidelines: some
intense scenes.</TE>

<HD>Hi, Honey. How Was Your Day?</HD>
<DH>In France's haunting 'Time Out,' an unemployed, daring man
lies to his family about having a meaningful job, but his
exhilaration unravels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Time Out" is not just an especially subtle and thoughtful
psychological drama, it's a provocative, even an unnerving one as
well. It's the story of a daring impostor named Vincent, a
world-class dissembler who goes to extraordinary lengths to carry out
an increasingly elaborate deception. What does Vincent take all these
pains to pretend to be? A man with a job.</LD>
<LD>   At one time, of course, Vincent had the kind of well-paying,
white-collar employment that enabled him to buy a home and support a
wife and three children. But after he's let go, his reluctance to
tell his family what has happened leads him down an increasingly
risky and surreal path that starts to double back on itself in
unforeseen ways.</LD>
<LD>   Though its trajectory is different, "Time Out" (L'Emploi du Temps)
was partly suggested by the real-life story of Jean-Claude Romand,
who resorted to violence when his 18 years of pretending to work for
the World Health Organization were uncovered. French director Laurent
Cantet, who co-wrote "Time Out" with Robin Campillo, was
understandably attracted to this situation. Almost alone among
contemporary filmmakers, his pictures, like his previous "Human
Resources," are about the centrality of work, about work as the
definer of who we are. "When we are out of work," he's said in
interviews, "we are nothing."</LD>
<TE>   Cantet was especially fortunate in persuading Aurelien Recoing, a
top French stage actor who's never before had a leading role on film,
to star as Vincent. It's a quite demanding part because this soft,
harmless-looking individual is in many ways a cipher, someone who's
largely unknowable to his co-workers, his wife, maybe even to
himself.</TE>
<TE>   Pudgy, balding, his face a pliant mask, Vincent is the man who
always blends in, the man who's interchangeable with the rest of the
herd. Which is what makes his deceptions so difficult to detect and
so discomforting to observe as they unfold.</TE>
<TE>   "Time Out" begins with Vincent, asleep in his car in a school
parking lot, roused by a cell phone call from his wife Muriel (Karin
Viard). Before he's even fully awake, he's telling the first of the
endless lies that mark his day, talking about clients that don't
exist, meetings that will never take place, the grueling nature of a
travel-intensive job that is no longer there. Once he's off the phone
he's freed, at least initially, from the working world's cares.</TE>
<TE>   When Vincent returns home, the deceptions get increasingly
difficult to manage as his wife and his parents pressure him for
details about his work. When his lies threaten to trip him up, he
escapes by telling bigger ones, taking greater and greater risks as
he tip-toes on the verge of being unmasked.</TE>
<TE>   It is one of the pleasures of Recoing's performance that it
enables us to sense how initially exhilarating all this is for
Vincent. He's fascinated, even energized by his gift for deception,
turned on by how willing others are to accept his claims. And when he
concocts a job for himself as a Geneva-based consultant for the U.N.,
he clearly gets satisfaction out of finally doing meaningful work
even though that work is mostly in his head.</TE>
<TE>   It's not entirely in his head because, in one of the film's
killing paradoxes, maintaining the illusion of having a job becomes a
time-consuming occupation in and of itself, though one that Vincent
finds much more to his liking.</TE>
<TE>   So we see Vincent sneaking into his make-believe office in a
Geneva building, clandestinely reading documents and preparing to
talk knowledgably back home about his new position. Now that he has
no source of income, he's forced to involve old school friends, even
his parents, in increasingly complex and frantic scams that prey on
gullibility and trust and involve Vincent in the kinds of dilemmas he
never imagined.</TE>
<TE>   Though you wouldn't necessarily guess it, except for Recoing as
Vincent and Cesar-winning actress Viard as his wife, the performers
in "Time Out" are not professionals. Director Cantet enabled the cast
to have input into their dialogue, a process that adds to the film's
uncanny naturalness. "Time Out's" reality level is one of the many
things making this look at living a lie truly haunting. Does Vincent
lose track of who he is through this complex deception, or get
tantalizingly closer to his actual core being? It's not as easy a
question to answer as you might think.</TE>

<HD>'Quo Vadis': A Straightforward, Old-School Epic From Poland</HD>
<DH>The elaborate production celebrates a favorite author and a
venerable director. Its narrative clarity is an advantage, because
many of its subtitles are illegible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Polish filmmakers recently have been making new versions of their
country's beloved 19th century novels, none more cherished than those
by Henryk Sienkiewicz.</LD>
<LD>   The veteran Jerzy Kawalerowicz, who turns 80 this year, has
completed an elaborate version of Sienkiewicz's most famous work,
"Quo Vadis," said to be Poland's biggest movie ever.</LD>
<LD>   A splendid-looking film with elaborate sets and a cast of
thousands, it is a straightforward, traditional screen narrative of
considerable clarity, which is a big plus because too many of the
literate English subtitles are washed out, thanks to white lettering
on light backgrounds.</LD>
<TE>   If memory serves, Mervyn LeRoy's 1951 version hasn't the nuances
and shadings in its characterizations as Kawalerowicz's rendering of
the novel, but it is surely more entertaining. Michal Bajor's Nero,
for example, is more complex than Peter Ustinov's, but it isn't as
much fun.</TE>
<TE>   The problem that besets any adaptor of "Quo Vadis" is that its
story is slow getting underway, despite its essential simplicity.
Marcus Vinicius (Pawel Delag), high-ranking Roman military officer,
falls for Lygia (Magdalena Mielcarz), the daughter of the king.</TE>
<TE>   She has been taken hostage by Nero's forces but enjoys the
protection of Marcus' uncle, Petronius (Boguslaw Linda), who
represents the epitome of Roman civility and erudition--he is the
author of "The Satyricon"--and is skillful enough to be the one man
trusted by the increasingly deranged and capricious Nero.</TE>
<TE>   Marcus makes the mistake of demanding Lygia as a concubine, for
despite their mutual attraction, she cannot accept him on those
terms. She manages to escape his clutches momentarily, and by the
time Marcus catches up with her, he has seen the light and converts
to her Christian religion.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, about then the crazed Nero has ordered Rome burned,
only to discover its citizens are in understandably sufficient uproar
to need a scapegoat. What to do but blame the Christians for setting
the city on fire and feed them to the lions in the Colosseum?</TE>
<TE>   Kawalerowicz directs with briskness and vigor but cannot keep the
first half of his film from slipping into tedium. His "Quo Vadis" has
the look, feel and morality of a Cecil B. DeMille epic--how did
DeMille happen not to make a version?--but without the sustaining
energy.</TE>
<TE>   The film gradually becomes more involving, powerful and ultimately
spiritual. Yet it is essentially old-fashioned in conception and
seems remote in comparison with "Gladiator," which made the events in
antiquity seem to be happening in the present.</TE>
<TE>   As in LeRoy's film, Petronius is the most fully realized
character, and Linda, a stalwart of the Polish cinema, gives a subtle
performance of a reflective, urbane and ultimately courageous man
that recalls that of Leo Genn in the earlier version, who may well
have been for youthful viewers in 1951 the first intellectual on the
screen.</TE>
<TE>   Marcus and Lygia are pretty much stock hero and heroine parts, but
both Delag and Mielcarz impress. Bajor shows us a Nero in constant
torment and conflict, his fleeting decent impulses short-circuited by
megalomania and paranoia. Franciszek Pieczka is commanding and
persuasive as the Apostle Peter.</TE>
<TE>   To watch this new "Quo Vadis" is to suspect that there's a good
chance that either of the two major Italian silent versions--one made
in 1912, the other in 1924 with Emil Jannings as Nero--is ultimately
more successful than either LeRoy's or Kawalerowicz's films or
several other versions, for that matter. That's because the silent
film, with its inherent stylization, may well be the most effective
medium for such florid, emphatically 19th century material.</TE>

<HD>A Strangely American 'Celebration'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the weeks and months after John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln,
would anyone in the United States have fathomed that a national
audience would someday settle in for a gala called "An American
Celebration at Ford's Theatre"?</LD>
<LD>   Such an incongruous extravaganza is no longer new--tonight's
special on ABC at 9 marks the 22nd telecast of an event from Ford's
since it reopened in 1968, 103 years after Lincoln's assassination
there. And indeed, to see Stevie Wonder rev through "Superstition"
with the swift precision of a Formula One driver is reason enough to
hail American culture without reservation.</LD>
<LD>   But however much one moves forward, it is difficult reconciling
what is essentially a national talent show (Mandy Moore sings! David
Copperfield does tricks!) with the site of one of America's greatest
tragedies--mere months after the country's most recent tragedy.</LD>
<TE>   We're not talking about a moment of silence before "the show must
go on." "An American Celebration" goads us into remembering just as
we're forgetting and forgetting just as we're remembering.</TE>
<TE>   Tony winner Kristen Chenoweth belts out a stylish Broadway-style
showcase number. She bows, and John Spencer of "The West Wing" enters
with gravitas to remind us, as Lincoln said, "freedom is the last,
best hope on Earth." A commercial break, and then it's back to good
ol' entertainment with a pop tune from country group Shedaisy.</TE>
<TE>   Fine performances all, but altogether kind of unsettling. Perhaps
the best argument for "An American Celebration," in all its
contradictions, is as a post-Sept. 11 time capsule, evidence of an
America in transition, an America sometimes artfully, sometimes
awkwardly continuing the pursuit of happiness while trying to respect
those who no longer can.</TE>

<LD>Photographers Ida Wyman and Larry Silver were barely out of high
school when they shot some of their most memorable work, images that
offer a glimpse of American life--specifically in Los Angeles and New
York--in the 1940s and '50s. Fifty photos from that era are the
subject of Apex Fine Art's exhibit "America at Mid-Century: Two
Views," which opens tonight at the La Brea Avenue gallery and runs
through May 18. On the eve of the show, the photographers spoke by
phone from New York about the power of their images in retrospect.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a glimpse into another world in terms of manners, dress and
occupations," says Wyman, 76. "Looking back at the photos, they show
a lot of details about what people looked like ... beyond hairstyle
and clothes. There's a less guarded look. Even a certain dignity."</LD>
<LD>   In the early 1940s, Wyman explored her own Bronx neighborhood and
the streets of New York, capturing "ordinary people doing ordinary,
everyday things." Her favorite images include a group of young boys
playing with dolls, an iceman carting ice off his wagon and a view of
the bustling crowd from the steps of the New York Public Library.</LD>
<TE>   Wyman was 22 in 1948 when Life magazine sent her to its Los
Angeles bureau. There she worked on movie sets capturing publicity
shots of James Cagney and Bonzo the chimpanzee, among others. She
also followed then-U.S. senatorial candidate Richard Nixon on the
campaign trail. "I used to love to walk up and down the streets
talking to people," she says. "I've always been very curious.
Photography was a way to get closer to people and satisfy that
curiosity."</TE>
<TE>   Around the same time, a teenage Larry Silver was trawling the
streets of New York for images. He recalled the day he took "Penn
Station, NYC," a shadowy photo of several dark figures shot from
above. The figures were children, not much older than Silver, playing
in a hallway. He was so struck by the delicate lighting that he
started snapping pictures. When his subjects spotted him, "they got
in this sort of real arrogant pose, with a cigarette. I think [the
photo] really depicts a sort of attitude of the 1950s," Silver says.</TE>
<TE>   Silver came to Los Angeles to attend the Art Center School in
1953. Soon he was drawn to Santa Monica's Muscle Beach, which
reminded him of Coney Island in New York. One of his best-known shots
is titled "Contestants" and features a crowd of bare-chested,
muscle-flexing young men posing for a bodybuilding contest on the
beach in 1954. "What I wanted to do in the Muscle Beach series was
sort of depict the flavor and the feeling of all the activities that
were going on around it," he says. "Not knowing it, I was depicting a
form of Americana that 50 years later ... L.A. would be very proud
of."</TE>
<TE>   Not Your Typical</TE>
<TE>   Cell Phone</TE>
<TE>   For the price of a small family car, buyers can now get a
platinum- and jewel-encrusted cell phone. Vertu, a subsidiary of
Nokia specializing in luxury mobile phones, will unveil "the world's
most exclusive communication instrument" this spring in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The line of luxury "instruments," ranging in price from $4,900 to
$19,450, was announced in Paris during Couture Week, but the phones
will get their West Coast debut May 1 with a showing at the new Ace
Gallery space in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to make a cell phone the equivalent of a fine watch or
a piece of jewelry that is owned for a lifetime, said James Kloiber,
director of marketing for Vertu.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same type of a person who would acquire a Patek Philippe
or a Bentley," Kloiber said. He added that the company has gotten a
lot of response from the entertainment industry. "This," he said,
offering the requisite spin, "is a product popular with Hollywood
insiders."</TE>
<TE>   The handcrafted phones will have more than 400 mechanical parts
and 18 jeweled bearings and will be available in casings of platinum,
18-karat white gold, 18-karat yellow gold or stainless steel.</TE>
<TE>   Customers also get a "concierge" function.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the sexiest feature of the phone--that's what people get
excited about," said Kloiber. "One-button access to your own personal
concierge ... whether you need to find the best hotel, or what's the
hot new restaurant in Paris, and get me a table there....It's a
one-button personal assistant."</TE>
<TE>   Don't expect to find them at the local strip mall. The phones will
only be available through Vertu "galleries" (stores) and by personal
appointment at Vertu Private Client Suites--spaces that have a
"simple, beautiful, gallery-type feel," where customers will be
served refreshments and the phones will be showcased next to pieces
of contemporary art, said Kloiber.</TE>
<TE>   The actual connection that would turn this bauble into a working
phone is, of course, extra.</TE>

<LD>PAPERBOY</LD>
<LD>   Confessions of a Future Engineer</LD>
<LD>   By Henry Petroski</LD>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf</TE>
<TE>   368 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   In 1954, on Henry Petroski's 12th birthday, he and his family
moved from Brooklyn to Cambria Heights, Queens, in the suburbs. The
same day, he received as a birthday present the object of his desire,
a Schwinn bicycle.</TE>
<TE>   Working fast, lest his clumsy father awkwardly try to help and
damage the bike, Petroski got it out of its box and put it together.
The bike opened to the boy a teenage career as a paperboy for the
afternoon daily Long Island Press and, though he didn't recognize it
yet, a grown-up career as an engineer.</TE>
<TE>   A professor of civil engineering and history at Duke University,
Petroski is the author of noted books about engineering, including
"The Pencil" and "To Engineer Is Human." In his joyous and finely
calibrated "Paperboy," he takes the reader into the mind of a boy
who, already at 12, thinks like an engineer though he doesn't know it
yet.</TE>
<TE>   Having figured out how to fold the paper, balance 60 papers in his
bike basket, flip them neatly onto the porch and where his densely
clustered customers lived, "I was," he writes, "more interested in
numbers than names, in things than ideas, in newspapers than books.
What mattered most to me were the day-to-day practicalities of
delivering the Long Island Press. I was an engineer long before I
understood all the connotations of the word."</TE>
<TE>   In 1957, when Petroski was nearly 16 and giving up his paper route
after four years, the Russians inaugurated the Space Age by sending
up Sputnik. Were the Reds going to beat us? Congress passed the
Defense Education Act to fund students in math and science, and the
race was on. As naturally as Petroski had been riding his bike, he
flowed into the production line of science and technology education.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, he learned to articulate the lessons he had been
learning since he opened that Schwinn box. "Engineering," I would
learn," is neither math nor science, though it uses them as
fundamental knowledge and as tools. In its most basic form,
engineering is the synthesis of things, as a working computer comes
out of the idea of a computer and its parts, or as a
three-dimensional bicycle comes out of a flat box of its parts.
Things did come simply of the math and science with which they were
understood. Rather, things came of engineering....</TE>
<TE>   "Being an engineer is a lot like being a paperboy.... How many
papers a paperboy had to draw was math; how he delivered them was
engineering ... how the papers were supposed to be flipped was
science; how the papers were flipped was engineering.... How many
raindrops danced on the head of a paperboy was math and science; how
he avoided half of them on his speeding bike was engineering. And as
simple as the theory might be, it was never that easy in practice."</TE>
<TE>   Petroski went on a madcap teenage bike ride with two friends and
ended up in a bicycle wreck that sent him to Jamaica Hospital.
Before, he had approached literature in his classes through Classics
Illustrated; after, he read Joseph Conrad. He also looked out of the
hospital window at the Van Wyck Expressway and the pedestrians and
the elevated train platforms.</TE>
<TE>   "Though the people and the cars they drove were free to go in all
sorts of directions, they followed very predictable patterns through
the day and night. There was an overarching order.... What I was
watching was technology in motion, and what made it happen was the
engineering of the machines and the transportation systems within
which they moved.... I was becoming equally attracted to the real
world of things on the street and the imaginary world of ideas in
books."</TE>
<TE>   Petroski was growing up.</TE>
<TE>   Petroski writes "Paperboy" with the observant eye of an engineer
and the imaginative heart of a novelist. Anyone who has had any
acquaintance with the experience of being young in those years, the
years of Eisenhower, and of that milieu, a big Eastern city with its
huge populations of the children and grandchildren of immigrants,
will recognize and smile at Petroski's portrait of his loving family
in a seemingly stable nation on the verge of upheaving change. Those
too young to know that time can be assured that that is the way it
was.</TE>

<DH>California's casual lifestyle is a reliable source for
fashion trends.</DH>

<LD>California fashion has always been more cowboy than couture, more
blue jeans than Beau Brummel. Style here filters up from the streets
and beaches and out from the big screen, instead of down from the
runways as it does in New York, Paris and Milan.</LD>
<LD>   This is, after all, the birthplace of Levi's, the modern fashion
swimsuit, the poodle skirt, pedal-pushers, the Haight Ashbury hippie
look and the surf short. And for decades, movies and TV have inspired
global dressing more than any single European designer--even Yves
Saint Laurent.</LD>
<LD>   The allure of Hollywood has sent women running to buy sexy sarongs
like Dorothy Lamour's and man-tailored pants like Katharine
Hepburn's, just as it has sent men to stores for white T-shirts and
leather motorcycle jackets like Marlon Brando's.</LD>
<TE>   "More people dress in styles rooted in California than styles born
almost anywhere else," writes Marian Hall in her gem of a book,
"California Fashion," due from Harry Abrams in June.</TE>
<TE>   The fashion industry in California has succeeded not in spite of
its outsider status, but because of it. In the 1930s and 1940s, East
Coast designers were still doggedly knocking-off trends from Europe.
But the heavy fabrics and formal styles didn't make sense for
easygoing California.</TE>
<TE>   So, one of the first American designers of sportswear separates,
Lou Van Roy, broke out of the mold. Working for an L.A. company
called Lou Kornhandler, she showed women that a skirt and jacket
purchased together could be worn together, or with other items from
the wardrobe, creating the foundation for modern, mix n' match
dressing in the early 1930s even, according to Hall, before New
York's Claire McCardell.</TE>
<TE>   The same casual lifestyle that inspired sportswear gave rise to
surfwear in the 1950s. In 1959, just after the foam surfboard was
developed, Duke Boyd and seamstress Doris Moore created a pair of
wide-leg canvas shorts and founded Hang Ten. Lightweight nylon trunks
followed, making the company millions and spawning an industry that
now includes brands such as Quiksilver and Body Glove, based in
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco in the 1960s, the rock 'n' roll generation
defined itself by rejecting consumer society and dressing in ripped
jeans and handcrafted, Old World clothing and accessories. The hippie
aesthetic inspired Saint Laurent's peasant look, and continues to
cycle through designer collections, including those in stores now.</TE>
<TE>   Runway shows have come and gone in California. In 1937, L.A.-based
publications California Stylist and California Apparel News began
organizing "fashion fiestas" in Palm Springs, Hall writes.</TE>
<TE>   Swimwear designer Fred Cole, whose daughter Anne continues his
business, was innovative in getting press here, she said. "Editors
and buyers came out [from the East Coast] and had a mini-vacation.
They had entree to all kinds of people's houses and the movie
studios. They did it up and that was the allure," she said.</TE>
<TE>   After World War II, movie studios began cross-promotions with
designers, providing personal appearances by stars such as Cary Grant
and Rosalind Russell, who would meet and greet editors at events as
elaborate as a privately chartered train trip to the Grand Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood has always been an important vehicle for California
style.</TE>
<TE>   Working within the studio system, costume designers Travis Banton,
Edith Head and Gilbert Adrian were able to influence wardrobes
worldwide with their designs. In the 1940s, when Adrian created the
broad-shouldered jacket for Joan Crawford to draw attention away from
her thick waist and wide hips, the shape swept the nation. His
bias-cut gowns for Jean Harlow were also copied at all price points,
writes Hall, a former fashion model, apparel manufacturer and curator
of L.A.'s Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising.</TE>
<TE>   The golden age of California design was the late 1950s, when
masters such as James Galanos, Don Loper, William Travilla, Michael
Novarese and Rudi Gernreich offered an avant-garde alternative to
Adrian's sharp silhouette and to sportswear.</TE>
<TE>   Galanos' artfully draped gowns were on par with French couture. He
designed both of Nancy Reagan's inaugural gowns.</TE>
<TE>   Gernreich was a futurist. He embraced California's independent,
frontier spirit, designing unstructured bathing suits that liberated
women's bodies, including the famed topless suit.</TE>
<TE>   Today, California style is both democratic and elitist, Hall
writes. This is the place that supplies the world with the clothes
people actually wear. At the same time, it is home to the red carpet,
the most famous fashion runway anywhere.</TE>

<KH>L.A. Fashion Week</KH>
<HD>Amid the Chaos, Fresh Ideas</HD>
<DH>What L.A. lacks in organization it makes up for in
creativity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Elaborate runway shows may be the engine for promoting and selling
fashion in New York and Europe, but in L.A., they've played a more
sporadic role. Even so, there are designers who still crave the
legitimacy they believe runway shows can bring. So more than 30
designers will show their fall collections in L.A.'s scaled-down
version of fashion week, which began Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Not everyone thinks the shows are necessary. The clothes that will
be seen on runways, after all, represent only a fraction of the $30
billion California garment industry. And with such magazines as Lucky
and In Style eager to feature the newest labels, especially if
there's a celebrity tie-in, California clothing is already getting
more exposure than ever.</LD>
<LD>   Companies such as Juicy Couture, Frankie B, Seven jeans, Mon Petit
Oiseau and Trina Turk create modern interpretations of California
staples such as the baby tee, the low-riding jean and the
resort-style palazzo pant. They sell plenty of clothes, and they do
it without runway shows.</LD>
<TE>   "You can have a successful business without having to participate
in a fashion week," said Turk, who has never had a runway show.
"There's a lot of that kind of business done in California."</TE>
<TE>   L.A.'s fashion shows are not nearly as extravagant as those in
other cities, nor as organized. This season, guests will travel from
a Culver City warehouse to the Star Shoes bar on Hollywood Boulevard
for fashion shows-cum-mixers.</TE>
<TE>   The calendar is in such disarray that several events overlap. And
the public relations firm SPR, which created a six-designer group
show last season that was considered the most cohesive event in
recent memory, was unable to secure funding to bring it back.</TE>
<TE>   In short, things are a mess.</TE>
<TE>   And yet there's more interest in L.A. than ever because California
still represents what it always has in the fashion world: new ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is brand new in L.A.," said Toby Tucker, a fashion
editor at In Style magazine, who plans to attend the shows here this
week. "If you are big enough to come to New York, I've probably
already heard of you. But if you are small and celebs are going crazy
over you, I want to know about it."</TE>
<TE>   Another part of the attraction is California's distance and
difference from Seventh Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   "Designers in L.A. seem to have a more casual attitude. They are
more free to explore their own ideas, rather than feeling like they
have to follow a trend. You can really tell the difference," said
Gina Maher, fashion news editor for Lucky magazine, who also plans to
attend the shows.</TE>
<TE>   Saks Fifth Avenue buyer Abbey Samet is also coming out from New
York. "We typically go out to L.A. four or five times a year and
focus on the showrooms at the CaliforniaMart," she said. "But this
season, we are doing the shows because the importance of the talent
is increasing, and it's a way to differentiate our merchandise."</TE>
<TE>   Veteran L.A. retailer Shauna Stein typically buys for her shop, On
Beverly Boulevard, in New York and in Europe. This season, though,
she plans to check out her hometown offerings for the first time. "I
saw a few too many trends in Europe,'' she said. "In L.A., I'm going
out in search of the edge."</TE>
<TE>   L.A. fashion week is even pulling in a few designer-participants
from out of town. "It's good timing for my company, and there are
celebrities out here," explained Anthony Castro, a New York designer
who will show his collection of sexy 1960s inspired separates
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the organizational chaos, L.A. fashion week keeps on
chugging. And IMG, the sports and entertainment marketing giant that
produces New York's fashion week and several others around the world,
is looking seriously at getting involved in L.A. fashion. IMG
Marketing Director David Caruso is coming to town for a second
consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   Some have suggested that fashion week could be pegged to the
Academy Awards, which already draws designers and fashion press from
all over the world for up to a week before the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   A little star power couldn't hurt. Unfortunately, the past few
seasons of L.A. fashion week have been celebrity-light. As syndicated
fashion columnist Marylou Luther said, "If Halle Berry, Nicole
Kidman, Britney Spears or someone of their ilk could be enticed to
participate in some way, the week would be made."</TE>

<LD>It's 1849, and your family is counting on you for support. So you and
a friend board a ship in New York City and sail all the way around
South America's Cape Horn to San Francisco. You are going to
California for the promise of gold. After a four-month sail, you
reach the port. But before you leave the pier, you meet a man who
introduces you to a ship captain, a merchant and a miner. He asks you
to decide which one you would like to be.</LD>
<LD>   At the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park, you can
talk to these characters and make that decision. Other programs for
kids include afternoon and overnight stays to learn about life aboard
a sailing ship or a World War II-era submarine. You can learn
old-time sailor songs, take a tour of the Maritime Museum and use a
special computerized map to see, hear and even chart the movements of
boats at work in the bay.</LD>

<HD>Bigger Was Indeed Better for Pulitzers This Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sept. 11 and its aftermath dominated this year's Pulitzer Prize
competition, as they have nearly every aspect of American life over
the past seven months.</LD>
<LD>   Of the 14 Pulitzers awarded this week for journalism, eight went
for coverage connected to the terrorist atrocities. While that seems
natural enough, other concentrations in this year's awards have
attracted a good deal of uneasy attention. Only one of the
prizes--the Christian Science Monitor's award for editorial
cartooning--went to a newspaper not numbered among the nation's 10
largest. Twelve of the Pulitzers went to just four papers--the New
York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Wall Street Journal and the
Washington Post. The New York Times won a record seven.</LD>
<LD>   To some, this accumulation signifies a new dominance by America's
largest--and wealthiest--papers and a growing gap between their
journalism and that of other newspapers. And indeed, something
fundamental was at work this year: Over the past decade, four of the
winning papers have been among the handful of American newspapers and
broadcast outlets that have maintained strong national and
international reporting staffs and resisted mindless cost-cutting in
pursuit of unsustainable profit margins.</LD>
<TE>   When the United States confronted its greatest physical challenge
since Pearl Harbor, those papers had the resources and experience to
cover the story. "At the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, Wall
Street Journal and Washington Post, there has been a continuing
commitment to the sophisticated national and international reporting
that readers do, in fact, want," said former Times Editor Michael
Parks, who directs the journalism school at USC's Annenberg School of
Communications.</TE>
<TE>   According to Parks, who won the Pulitzer Prize for international
reporting in 1987, every credible study done over the past decade
"has shown a continuing strong appetite among readers and viewers for
coverage of international events. Those editors and publishers who
argue otherwise simply are rationalizing decisions made largely on
account of cost and the pursuit of profits."</TE>
<TE>   Orville Schell, dean of UC Berkeley's Graduate School of
Journalism and a veteran foreign reporter, sees "a truth hidden
behind the performance of these larger papers, and that is that all
but one of them have stock arrangements where the voting shares are
owned by a single family. This has protected them against the
cyclical massacres of newsroom staffs that the [newspaper] chains
have carried out over the past 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   The exception--the Los Angeles Times, which is owned by Tribune
Co.--"came of age as a great newspaper under family ownership,"
Schell said, "and it has the memory of wanting to be great imprinted
on its genetic code."</TE>

<TE>   Charles Frazier's second novel, which currently exists only as a
one-page proposal, may someday make good reading. The sums Frazier
will receive for publishing and film rights to the still-untitled
book already are making for good buzz.</TE>
<TE>   According to sources who participated in the sealed-bid auction
for the publishing rights, Random House will pay Frazier--whose
best-selling first novel, "Cold Mountain," won a National Book
Award--more than $8 million for the hardcover and paperback rights.
Scott Rudin, who produces movies for Paramount, has acquired the film
rights for $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   The runner-up in the publishing auction, according to
participants, was an unusual joint bid of $5 million by Morgan
Entrekin, whose independent Grove Atlantic published "Cold Mountain,"
and Sonny Mehta, who runs Knopf and Vintage.</TE>
<TE>   Variety put the price Rudin paid for the film option "among the
highest ever for a work of literary fiction." Similarly, Random
House's advance is thought to be among the richest deals ever struck
for a single serious novel.</TE>
<TE>   Several people who have read the proposal say it seems rich with
possibility.</TE>
<TE>   "Charles intends to fictionally re-create an actual historical
person and series of events he uncovered while researching 'Cold
Mountain,'" said one reader, who asked not to be named. "It involves
a white man who was adopted and raised by the Cherokees, represented
them in Washington as a lawyer and raised and led an all-Cherokee
unit in the Confederate Army. He ended his life as a 100-year-old
patient in an asylum, where he was thought to be mad because he spoke
only Cherokee. It's a story that's got everything--the Trail of
Tears, the Civil War and a compelling human drama. Sure the prices
were high, but 'Cold Mountain' was the best-selling literary first
novel in publishing history (2 million copies), and Frazier has a
demonstrated ability to handle just this sort of material."</TE>
<TE>   Rudin said he thinks the book, which is tentatively scheduled for
publication in 2005, "has the potential to be a John Ford/Howard
Hawks type of movie." Rudin is one of Hollywood's most voracious
purchasers of serious books. He paid $2 million for Jonathan
Franzen's "The Corrections," a Pulitzer Prize finalist for fiction
this year, and a substantial sum for a previous prizewinner, Michael
Cunningham's "The Hours," which will be released later this year and
stars Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf. His previous films include
John Bayley's "Iris: A Memoir of Iris Murdoch," Michael Chabon's
"Wonder Boys" and Frank McCourt's "Angela's Ashes."</TE>
<TE>   Works in Progress</TE>
<TE>   T. Coraghessan Boyle, author of numerous novels and collections of
short stories, also maintains a Web page, www.tcboyle.com: "I've just
finished a novel set in 1970 in California and Alaska, dealing with
the back-to-the-earth movement of that period (read: hippies). It's
called 'Drop City,' and my longtime publisher, Viking Penguin (which
keeps all my 14 previous titles in print, praise the Lord), will
release it in February.</TE>
<TE>   "In the meantime, I am writing new short stories for the
collection that will follow last fall's 'After the Plague.' The first
of these new stories--'Swept Away'--appeared in the New Yorker in
January; the others are currently sitting on my agent's desk awaiting
their final destination. I've got six new pieces now, which
constitute the first half of the next collection, which will follow
the just-now-awakening idea for the next novel, which I hope to begin
researching in a month or so.</TE>
<TE>   "Aside from that, as readers of this month's GQ will know, I keep
the house nice and neat for my wife."</TE>

<HD>Some Fancy Footwork for Summer</HD>
<DH>The foot tube, the toe topper and the Moroccan foot thong
keep blisters at bay during sandal and mule season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The "foot tube" may appear to be one of those completely useless
inventions like crystal deodorant and the Inside-the-Shell electric
egg scrambler. But the simple band of stretch fabric designed to be
worn around the arch of the foot, and its cousin the "toe topper" are
helping the hosiery business, especially during the summer months.</LD>
<LD>   "Women have stopped wearing socks in the summer," said Mimi
Merkin, the designer for Hue Legwear. "We had to make something to
wear with sandals, open-back sneakers and mules."</LD>
<LD>   Introduced last spring, the "foot tube" was followed by the
"toe-topper," a mini-sock that just covers the toes. "They make shoes
more comfortable and they prevent blistering," Merkin said of the two
designs, some of which have nonskid bottoms to help keep the foot in
the shoe. "And they are multi-functional; In the winter foot tubes
can be used to fasten ponytails."</LD>
<TE>   The company's newest design is the Moroccan foot thong, a
crocheted wisp of fabric meant to be a sexy accent for the bare foot.
Merkin said, "We are always trying to stay one step ahead." So to
speak.</TE>
<TE>   Collage Vest Is a Case</TE>
<TE>   of Designer Deja Vu</TE>
<TE>   The work of late Kaisik Wong, a little-known San Francisco
designer, is being newly appreciated. One of his designs has been
copied by none other than Nicolas Ghesquiere of Balenciaga, one of
today's hottest designers.</TE>
<TE>   The similarity of a collage vest designed by Wong, who died of
leukemia in 1990, and one in Ghesquiere's spring collection was first
noted March 27 in the weekly Chic Happens column on Hintmag.com. An
intern at the Web site spotted a picture of Wong's work in a 1974
book, "Native Funk &amp; Flash; an Emerging Folk Art," by Alexandra
Jacopetti.</TE>
<TE>   The designer, when contacted by Cathy Horyn of the New York Times,
admitted he had copied the vest, which came to his attention from a
photocopy of the page from "Native Funk &amp; Flash."</TE>
<TE>   Copying is common and lucrative in fashion, so the discovery
hasn't created much buzz. Still, if imitation is the ultimate
flattery, then Ghesquiere's discovery of Wong speaks to the late
designer's talent.</TE>
<TE>   Major Appliances Get</TE>
<TE>   Nicole Miller Touch</TE>
<TE>   What's new in Nicole Miller's design portfolio? Refrigerators. The
designer has dressed the front panel of a line of Jenn-Air's new
Luxury Series Built-In Refrigerators. Her mosaic front uses a stained
glass technique to give an impression of a flower through a window.</TE>
<TE>   Miller is the latest clothing designer to expand into home
products. "More and more designers are turning to home design, and as
the kitchen is the center of the home, it's becoming the hottest new
room to focus on," she said. "The size and shape of the blank
refrigerator panel reminded me of a window. What nicer thing to be
able to see from your kitchen than a beautiful floral display?"</TE>
<TE>   The original Miller-designed refrigerator will be auctioned later
this year to an anti-poverty organization.</TE>
<TE>   Salvation Army Show</TE>
<TE>   to Benefit AIDS Facility</TE>
<TE>   Fashion designers have milked the concept of Salvation Army chic
for so long, it's about time the organization got something for it.
For an April 27 fund-raiser, L.A. designers Richard Tyler, Jared
Gold, Eduardo Lucero, Estevan Ramos, Petro Zillia and others will
reshape vintage garments from Salvation Army stores for a fashion
show and sale.</TE>
<TE>   The event includes a shopping boutique filled with clothing and
accessories selected and re-styled by the designers, as well as a
runway show. Proceeds will benefit Alegria, an AIDS treatment
facility in Silver Lake funded by the Salvation Army and other
partners. Information: (213) 553-3268.</TE>

<KH>Jeannine Stein FASHION POLICE</KH>
<HD>Security Tag Has This Shopper Seeing Red</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: I just bought a new red dress. When I got home
from the store I noticed that the security tag--the kind with
exploding ink--was still attached. The store is far away, and I
didn't have time to drive back, so I tried to remove the tag myself,
and the ink splattered all over the dress. What should I do?</LD>
<LD>   --RUINED</LD>
<LD>   Dear Ruined: Here's the first thing you should do: Promise that
you'll never be such a bonehead again and try to remove an exploding
ink security tag. Why do you think they call them exploding ink
security tags? This is one instance where you don't get points for
being enterprising. Sorry.</LD>
<TE>   Sorry also to tell you that your dress is beyond repair. We're not
sure what kind of tag you encountered, but most of the inks used in
those are permanent, nonwashable and non-dry cleanable, according to
Stuart Seidel, president of Unisen, a Boca Raton, Fla.-based
manufacturer of electronic surveillance products designed for retail
stores.</TE>
<TE>   "And actually," he added, "the ink doesn't really explode; it kind
of dribbles out when the pin is forced and the glass ampuls [which
hold the ink] break. It's meant as a deterrent.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually there are warning labels telling you not to tamper with
it."</TE>
<TE>   Seidel said before trashing the dress you should call the store,
explain what happened and see if they'll refund your money or
exchange the dress for a new one.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: I have a major dilemma. I live in New
Zealand, and my girlfriend from school who now lives in Los Angeles
is getting married in November. She wants me to come to the wedding.
But she is ultra-gorgeous and trendy, and I am not! I do not want to
stick out like a country bumpkin from Down Under, but I don't have
any idea what to wear. How do I find out what the fashion there is
going to be for fall and winter? Please help!</TE>
<TE>   --WORRIED KIWI</TE>
<TE>   Dear Worried: Don't freak out; L.A. isn't just the land of
trendoids. Despite its reputation for being a bastion of hipness, the
city does allow residents and visitors who don't have tattoos,
pierced tongues or drive cool cars. In fact, there are L.A. people
who are positively nerdy.</TE>
<TE>   We hope that eases your fears a bit. Remember this, too: Your
friend has asked you to come thousands of miles to celebrate a
special event, not to participate in a fashion show. We doubt every
single one of her friends is on the cutting edge of style, and
chances are no one will give you the old up-and-down glance or make
snide comments about your appearance. Besides, your being a New
Zealander will make you very exotic and cool.</TE>
<TE>   While you'll be heading into spring weather where you are, L.A.'s
autumn will be in full swing, with cool temperatures most likely.
General trends for fall include pared-down, refined clothes--slim
sweaters, bias-cut skirts, simple jackets. On the flip side, collage
is making a splash, with pieced items, such as jackets and coats,
that are a jumble of color and texture.</TE>
<TE>   Be careful not to overdo the glitz for evening, although daytime
accessories tend to be bold and chunky. Turquoise jewelry is big with
the Western/prairie look that's popular this spring and will likely
be around for fall. Full skirts, suede jackets, cowboy boots and
peasant blouses are all part of the trend.</TE>
<TE>   Before you start shopping we recommend you find out the time of
the wedding, where it will take place and the level of formality.
Those factors will make it easier for you to select an appropriate
outfit. It won't do you any good to buy into that prairie princess
look if it's a formal evening wedding. If you're still not sure which
way to skew your outfit, just keep it simple and elegant. And don't
forget tissues, in case you get a little teary.</TE>
<TE>   From the Fashion Police Blotter: Summer is tote bag season. Hefty,
durable totes are necessary accessories for schlepping beach stuff,
fruits and vegetables from farmers markets, picnic paraphernalia,
etc. We've always liked those basic canvas Boat and Tote bags from
L.L. Bean, but now, in celebration of the company's 90th anniversary,
the company is offering design-your-own bags. Starting with an
off-white, open top canvas body in sizes small to extra-large,
customers can choose from eight solid colors and four patterns for
the bottom of the bag and the handles. Choose from standard length or
shoulder-length handles and several monogram styles. A personalized
label can also be sewn inside. Prices range from $27 to $40
(monogramming is extra). For more information, call (800) 221-4221.</TE>

<LD>Barry chuckled as he put together the dish he was certain would solve
Ral's problem. When he went into the living room with it his friends
gathered around.</LD>
<LD>   "Taste it," he invited Ral.</LD>
<LD>   Ral stuck one end of it into his mouth and took a big, crunchy
bite. His sideways mouth chewed. "Very good," he said at last. "And
the best part is, I don't have to tilt my head to eat it. None of the
ingredients fall out. What did you say this is called?"</LD>
<TE>   "It's a taco," Barry cried. "It can go the same way as your
mouth!"</TE>
<TE>   "This is it," Ral said enthusiastically. "This is the dish I've
been searching for. I'm sure the head chef will promote me when he
sees and tastes this taco." From somewhere inside his silver suit he
pulled out a metal pad about the size of his palm. "This," he said,
"is the official Thousand Galaxies Cookbook. You'll find a lot of
wonderful recipes in here." Without saying another word, he handed
the cookbook to Barry and walked out the door, still holding the taco
in his hand.</TE>
<TE>   "Good luck," the kids called as they chased after him. When they
got to the front door they were surprised that he was gone.</TE>
<TE>   As he walked back into the house with his friends, Barry studied
the cookbook. He accidentally touched one corner, and a hologram of
something that looked like a pile of peanut shells and other
ingredients appeared. A wonderful aroma rose from the book. Slowly
Barry reached out to touch the shells, and immediately an unusual
taste filled his mouth. It was unlike anything he'd ever tasted
before, but it was definitely wonderful.</TE>
<TE>   "I think," he told his friends, "that there are enough new recipes
in here to keep me busy until I'm in college."</TE>
<TE>   "Good for us!" chimed Kyle and Alexis.</TE>
<TE>   Mel Gilden likes to cook even though he still makes crumbs when he
eats. His books and stories always contain food jokes. This story
will be on The Times' Web site at www.latimes.comkids.</TE>

<HD>Many Languages, a Common Passion</HD>
<DH>An unusual collaboration at UC Irvine aims to elevate the
art of literary translation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High-rolling Las Vegas casino executives, Nobel Prize-winning fiction
writers and bad-boy French literary theorists don't always have a lot
to say to each other. Which may account for why a new collaboration
at UC Irvine involving, among others, Glenn Schaeffer, the president
and chief financial officer of Mandalay Resort Group, Wole Soyinka,
the Nigerian playwright and poet, and Jacques Derrida, founding
godfather of deconstructionist criticism and a UCI philosophy
professor, isn't easy to put into words.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, the question of how things get put into words, and how
words from one language get put into another language, is the raison
d'etre behind the university's new International Center for Writing
and Translation. Officially established last July and formally
inaugurated last week, the center is being funded by a major
financial contribution from Schaeffer, a UCI alumnus and bibliophile
who attended the prestigious Iowa Writers' Workshop and wrote his
master's thesis on literary theory.</LD>
<LD>   Acknowledging that literary criticism "is not the usual background
of casino executives," Schaeffer said that his support for the center
marks a return to one of "my earlier passions. I wanted a stake in
the literary game."</LD>
<TE>   In Las Vegas literary circles, Schaeffer already is a well-known
player, having founded the International Institute of Modern Letters
in Las Vegas, a partner to Irvine's new center. Other Irvine partners
are the Iowa Writers' Workshop; the University of Nevada at Las
Vegas; Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand; and the
International Parliament of Writers in Paris, an organization formed
to assist writers after death threats were issued against author
Salman Rushdie.</TE>
<TE>   University officials said the center's purpose is to foster
writing, translation and criticism in a variety of languages by
funding fellowships and residencies and sponsoring readings,
performances, lectures and international conferences. University
officials believe the center may be the first of its kind anywhere in
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   But behind these formal academic goals lies a more far-reaching,
even global, ambition: to gain attention and find publishing outlets
for new literary voices. Schaeffer said that he hopes to target
writers and translators who are laboring under authoritarian regimes
and may be dealing with severe censorship and political restrictions,
in places such as Eastern Europe, Latin America, Indochina and
various Islamic countries. Writers in "minority languages" and
languages threatened with extinction also will receive attention.
"One thing is clear: We won't run out of political oppression or
censorship anytime soon," Schaeffer said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's inaugural activities at Irvine drew Schaeffer together
with literary lions Soyinka and Derrida and the dissident Chinese
poet and editor Bei Ling, all of whom are on the center's executive
board. Soyinka, the 1986 Nobel Prize winner for literature, is a
member of the Yoruba people of Nigeria, but writes in English.
Intellectually, he said, he was weaned on Yoruba literature and the
many great works he read in translation, such as the Bhagavad Gita
and ancient Greek tragedies. As a citizen of an "ex-colonial
society," and later a student at the University of Leeds in England,
he said, he was exposed to a wide variety of world literature. Even
today, he dreams in Yoruba and English.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, Soyinka finds the United States to be "one of the
most insular, mono-linguistic communities I've ever encountered in my
life." The translation center, he said, could help expose American
scholars and the portion of the public that "at least regards
literature as also a consumer product, like corn flakes or whatever,
to different brands of literary corn flakes. And this for me will be
a very good thing for this society."</TE>
<TE>   Bei, founder and editor of the literary journal "Tendency,"
stressed that good translations can help popularize Western writers
to audiences in countries such as China. "I do lots of work trying to
introduce different writers, their intellectual work," Bei said,
citing Vaclav Havel, Soyinka, Nadine Gordimer and Seamus Heaney.</TE>
<TE>   In a panel discussion, Bei also addressed the problem of
"self-censorship" among writers with cause to fear political
reprisal. He was arrested in August 2000 for "illegally publishing"
his journal in China, and was later deported after briefly serving
time in a Beijing jail. He now lives in Boston, where he is a
research associate at Harvard University's Fairbank Center for East
Asian Research.</TE>
<TE>   Bei noted the shortage of good academic translators in the United
States. "In America, most intellectual scholars" don't do
translation, he said. "They publish their own research, they want to
write some papers. So they don't want to do translation. Translation
is difficult [and] tough."</TE>
<TE>   Karen Lawrence, dean of UCI's School of Humanities, said that
investigating the theory, practice, aesthetics and politics of
translation would constitute the center's broader mandate. "We're
considering translation not merely as a practice of crossing language
borders, but considering what it means, what do you lose, what do you
gain, when a piece of writing travels, in a new language," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence said that she and Schaeffer first began discussing the
idea of a center two years ago. It's a natural fit, she said, given
the university's existing scholarship and its diverse, polyglot
student body.</TE>
<TE>   Schaeffer said that he regards literature as a form of social
capital, and believes that translated works are "a very underserved
market of literature."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a believer that literature has a purpose in life, it's not
only about aesthetics," he said. "History proves that wherever you
have literary dissent you tended to have progress in society."
Schaeffer's gift is the largest the School of Humanities ever has
received from an alumnus, Lawrence said, though neither she nor
Schaeffer would disclose the exact amount.</TE>
<TE>   Soyinka and Bei emphasized practical issues of translation--how to
get more books published by non-American and non-European authors,
how to redress the balance of what Soyinka called the current
"lopsided" global cultural exchange. Derrida, 71, a UCI faculty
member since 1986 and author of more than 50 books on literature,
Marxism, psychoanalysis and other subjects, elaborated some of his
philosophical concerns with converting one language into another.</TE>
<TE>   These stem from his influential theories about language in
general, about the ultimate indeterminacy of what words mean. Of the
hundreds of thousands of words he has written, Derrida's most famous
undoubtedly are contained in his assertion that "there is nothing
outside the text." That is, the words, and hence the meaning, of any
given text--a book, a poem, a recipe, a computer manual--are, in a
sense, self-contained and hermetically sealed. They can only be
properly said to refer to themselves, not to the "things" in the
outside world they supposedly refer to.</TE>
<TE>   Translation, like any form of literary interpretation, is subject
in Derrida's view to manipulation and "contamination" by foreign
values and biases, whether by intention or subconsciously. Vladimir
Nabokov memorably satirized this sometimes comically convoluted
process in his novel "Pale Fire," in which a fawningly envious
foreign-born editor willfully misconstrues a famous American poet's
work. At the same time, Derrida has said, the only people who truly
"know how to read and write are translators."</TE>
<TE>   Looking natty in a gray pinstriped suit, Derrida spoke about
translation at a free public gathering last week on campus. He was
joined by his foremost translator, Peggy Kamuf, a professor at USC.
"My English hasn't improved since" he came to the United States,
Derrida joked to the crowd, "so I apologize for not being able to
translate myself."</TE>
<TE>   The paradox of translation, Derrida said, is that the translator
must strive to be as faithful as possible to the original author's
style and intent, while at the same time recognizing that it's
impossible to reconstitute the unique meaning of the original words.
The alchemy of translation, he said, occurs precisely at that point
where an essentially new work is created. "A translator is a creative
writer," Derrida said. "You have to find the best way to be untrue to
the original, to perjure in the best way. This is the double bind."</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in a Jewish family in French colonial Algeria, Derrida
said, he always "had the vague feeling" that even his own native
tongue, French, was a foreign language. "Even the native speaker
can't appropriate his own language," he said. "It is always the
language of the Other."</TE>
<TE>   Schaeffer said that the center "in some ways will operate like a
professional research firm: scouring distant countries for new
voices; supporting writers and translators with grants; helping bring
translated works to the attention of commercial publishing houses and
academic presses; and helping to secure shelf space for works in
translation in major bookstore chains.</TE>
<TE>   Of the approximately 140,000 books published in the U.S. last
year, Schaeffer said, only about 200 were works translated from
languages other than English. One reason for this low figure is that
the writer and the translator must be paid, raising the cost of
producing a book. "Where we intend to insert ourselves is in that
gap," Schaeffer said. "Where in some cases we know a writer can and
should be published by a top-flight publisher in America or an
academic publisher, we will pay the translator."</TE>
<TE>   As an example of the need for good translation in the modern,
high-speed world, several people mentioned the videotape that was
released last fall by Osama Bin Laden, sending Western news
organizations, politicians and military strategists scrambling to
obtain reliable versions in their languages.</TE>
<TE>   Soyinka envisioned a less dramatic demonstration of translation's
potential to shape lives. "I'm looking forward to the day when one
will enter an American hotel room and will see not just the Bible
but, say, the Bible, the Koran, the Bhagavad Gita, the Ifa [a
religious book of the Yoruba people], the "Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam,"
Khalil Gibran," he said. "And at least we'll have a choice."</TE>

<HD>Grads Seek a Refuge to Sit Out the Recession</HD>
<DH>With jobs hard to find, many have turned to law school,
where applications have soared more than 22%. Impact of Sept. 11 is
cited.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>College graduates hoping to ride out the recession and postpone the
inevitable job search have applied to law schools in droves this
year, stiffening competition for limited spots.</LD>
<LD>   Across the country, applications have risen more than 22.6% to
80,795 by late March--the biggest annual increase in more than a
decade, according to the nonprofit Law School Admissions Council.</LD>
<LD>   Many law schools are still tallying their totals, with deadlines
stretching into June at some campuses. But if the number of people
taking the Law School Admissions Test is any indication, the
application rates could continue to rise. The total number of test
takers this year was 133,800, up 22.7% over last year.</LD>
<TE>   Admissions officials attribute much of the increase in
applications to the downturn in the economy, including fallout from
the dot-com collapse and the September terrorist attacks. Many
students are enrolling in law school to bide their time during the
job market slump and to improve their chances for getting a job when
the economy improves, admissions officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Applicants' Entrance Essays Focus on Sept. 11</TE>
<TE>   "Before 9/11 and the collapse of the economy, there were a lot of
consulting firms and companies that were snatching the top students
and offering them jobs in accounting and marketing," said Edward G.
Tom, director of admissions at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of
Law. "That's not happening now with the current graduating class."</TE>
<TE>   The terrorist attacks also renewed interest in and respect for the
legal profession, said Joyce Curll, assistant dean for admission and
financial aid at Harvard Law School. About 50 applicants wrote essays
saying Sept. 11 encouraged them to pursue careers as lawyers, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people who see the law as a way to make sense of the
confusion and to make a difference," Curll said.</TE>
<TE>   Alison Betts, 28, said Sept. 11 influenced her decision, but in a
different way.</TE>
<TE>   "It made me realize that life is not eternal," she said. "If I
wanted to achieve this goal, now would be the time to jump on it."</TE>
<TE>   Betts, who spent the last several years modeling and acting in Los
Angeles, said she had always thought about law school. The recent
decline in entertainment jobs has put a strain on her career and
prompted her to consider the legal profession more seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Betts said she is eager for the challenge of law school, as well
as the stable paycheck she expects a job as a lawyer would bring.</TE>
<TE>   Increases have been seen in private, public, small and large
schools. Harvard Law School applications rose by 19% over last year,
with 6,945 applications received by March 15 for 550 spots.
Berkeley's law school has received 6,892 applications for 270 spaces,
an increase of 22% over last year. Southwestern, in Los Angeles, has
received 2,300 applications for 400 spaces, more than 40% more than
last year. Pepperdine, meanwhile, received 2,800 applications by late
March for 215 spaces, an increase of 22%.</TE>
<TE>   Other types of graduate programs also had increases in
applications, said Peter Syverson, vice president for research at the
Council of Graduate Schools, which tracks enrollment nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   The last time there was such an increase in graduate enrollment
was in the mid-1980s, when the U.S. economy slowed and unemployment
rates rose, according to Syverson. That was about the same time that
the television show "L.A. Law" was popular and lured young people to
the legal profession.</TE>
<TE>   Many applicants to law school are straight out of college. Others
are older and have been laid off from their jobs or are seeking a
career change.</TE>
<TE>   Dan McCall, 22, who majored in Asian studies at Georgetown
University, said he realized that he couldn't rely on his college
degree and needed a graduate education to get a good, high-paying
job.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely didn't see an abundance of job opportunity," said
McCall, who has been working as a paralegal in Washington since
graduating in May 2001. "Choices seem to be a little more restricted
now. You can't just leave college and hitch your wagon to one of
those dot-coms."</TE>
<TE>   Though he's not sure he wants to be a lawyer, McCall said he
believes a law degree will help him in whatever career he chooses.
McCall has been accepted to Georgetown Law School and is awaiting a
letter from one more school.</TE>
<TE>   Admissions Offices Being More Selective</TE>
<TE>   The boom in applications doesn't necessarily mean good news for
prospective students. Competition is tougher and most campuses aren't
expanding their class size to meet the higher demand. Instead,
admissions officers are taking the opportunity to be more selective
and improve the quality of their entering class.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives us a wider variety and range of candidates from which to
select," said Tom, of Boalt Hall School of Law.</TE>
<TE>   Competition was already tough. Though 77,200 people applied to
bar-approved law schools nationwide last year, only 45,100 ended up
enrolling, according to the Law School Admissions Council, which
includes 185 law schools approved by the American Bar Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Like other law school admissions directors, Tom said he has been
overwhelmed by the upsurge in applications. At many campuses, the
mail bins are full, the phones ring constantly and admissions
officers are working extra hours to read through the packets.</TE>
<TE>   Admissions directors said they are trying to distinguish between
students who are just looking for something to bide their time and
those who are truly committed to the law.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Hooper, 23, said that after getting a regular paycheck since
graduating from Dartmouth College last year, she doesn't see law
school as a place to hide out for three years.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that I am going to be without an income for three years
scares me more than it reassures me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The renewed interest in graduate school has also meant a boom for
companies that offer test preparation courses.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as things started crashing, we started getting phone
calls," said Shawn Domzalki, managing director of course services at
the Princeton Review of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was wondering, 'What am I going to do? Better go to law
school or business school.'"</TE>

<LD>Panavision Inc., a movie camera maker controlled by billionaire
Ronald Perelman, canceled a $200-million bond sale because it
couldn't find enough buyers for the debt. The Woodland Hills-based
company also said it put off a plan to replace its existing
bank-credit agreement.</LD>
<LD>   Panavision had planned to use proceeds from the note sale and
funds from the new bank line to pay off existing bank debt and its
9.63% notes maturing in 2006. The company faces bank fees and a cash
interest payment on its subordinated notes in August, said Christina

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Hollywood super-agent Michael Ovitz has suffered another round
of setbacks in his bid to vault to the ranks of top talent management
as several sports stars and comedian Robin Williams defected from
Ovitz's management company in recent days.</LD>
<LD>   Williams made the jump Wednesday, leaving Ovitz's Beverly
Hills-based Artists Management Group and headed only a few blocks
away to Creative Artists Agency Inc., the agency Ovitz co-founded but
which now is a rival.</LD>
<LD>   An AMG spokesman was not immediately available for comment, but
Williams' departure deals a blow to Ovitz, who formed AMG in late
1998 after being pushed out as president of Walt Disney Co.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to Williams' departure, last week Jill Smoller, who
handles the careers of tennis stars Pete Sampras and Serena Williams,
Los Angeles Lakers basketball player Rick Fox and Olympic gold medal
swimmer Summer Sanders, left AMG and took her clients to William
Morris Agency.</TE>
<TE>   AMG continues to represent Cameron Diaz and Leonardo DiCaprio, and
the filmmaking division, Artists Production Group, continues to
develop movies.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An economist testifying for nine states seeking tough antitrust
sanctions against Microsoft Corp. balked at supporting the states'
key demand for a stripped-down version of the Windows operating
system.</LD>
<LD>   Carl Shapiro, a former Justice Department official, backed tough
measures to protect competition in technologies that have emerged
since the trial began, but declined to endorse parts of the states'
proposal.</LD>
<LD>   Remedies should restore competition by preventing Microsoft from
dominating new technologies that threaten the Windows monopoly it was
found to have illegally protected, Shapiro said.</LD>
<TE>   He was the 15th witness called by the states.</TE>

<HD>Americans Overpay Taxes by $945 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans are overpaying their taxes by $945 million a year because
they don't claim all the deductions they should, a government report
said.</LD>
<LD>   The General Accounting Office report said as many as 2.2million
tax filers overpaid by an average of $438 in 1998 because they failed
to claim deductible mortgage interest, expenses and fees, state and
local taxes, and charitable contributions. Instead, they claimed a
lower standard deduction, which doesn't require record-keeping or
receipts.</LD>
<LD>   About half of the estimated 2.2million people who overpaid their
taxes had their tax returns prepared by third parties, including
accountants and firms that prepare returns for a fee.</LD>
<TE>   Those who've overpaid can file an amended tax return and claim a
refund, provided they have records to prove they have the deductible
expenses.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News; Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prices of goods imported into the U.S. in March rose at the fastest
pace in 11/2 years, led by a surge in oil costs that may restrain
consumer spending and economic growth.</LD>
<LD>   The 1.1% increase in the import price index, reflecting the
biggest gain in energy costs since April 1999, followed a 0.1% drop
in February, the Labor Department said.</LD>
<LD>   In a separate report, the department said initial jobless benefit
claims fell by 55,000 to 438,000 in the week ended Saturday. The
four-week moving average, a more reliable measure of employment
conditions because it irons out weekly gyrations, rose to 433,750,
the highest level since December, from 424,000 the previous week.</LD>

<LD>Target Corp., the second- largest U.S. discount retailer, said fiscal
first-quarter profit would rise more than forecast as consumers buy

ending May 4 on the strength of sales at Target stores, spokeswoman
Cathy Wright said. The company didn't give a specific forecast. The
average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call

<LD>* Visx Inc., a maker of lasers used to correct vision, said
first-quarter profit fell 48% as royalties from doctors using its
devices decreased when the company cut prices. Net income dropped to
$6.5 million, or 12 cents a share, from $12.6 million, or 21 cents, a
year earlier. Sales fell 28% to $36.6 million.</LD>
<LD>   * Ross Stores Inc. said first-quarter profit would exceed
estimates on higher sales. The discount retailer expects earnings to
increase to 58 cents a share from 43 cents a year earlier. Analysts
expected the 465-store chain to earn 52 cents in the quarter.</LD>
<LD>   * Gymboree Corp. said first-quarter profit would be higher than it
expected as sales of traditional, colorful clothing rose. Profit will
be 14 cents to 16 cents a share, up from its previous forecast of 7
cents to 9 cents. Gymboree had a loss of 1 cent a year earlier.</LD>

<LD>A top Hewlett-Packard Co. executive said he feels violated by the
release of a voicemail to him from Chief Executive Carly Fiorina but
pledged that "our honor will be restored" in the upcoming trial over
the Compaq Computer Corp. acquisition.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Wayman, HP's chief financial officer, was responding to the
disclosure that in a message two nights before the March 19
shareholder vote on the Compaq deal, Fiorina told him "we may have to
do something extraordinary" for two large investors to win their
support.</LD>
<LD>   In a memo to HP employees that was filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Wayman said the leaked voicemail refers merely
to the slew of in-depth, in-person presentations to investors that HP
executives made in the days before the shareholder vote.</LD>
<TE>   "Neither Carly nor I would ever act improperly in any business
matter--much less use business assets to secure votes," Wayman wrote.
"The only good news about participating in a trial is that the facts
will come out, the truth will be heard and our honor will be
restored."</TE>

<HD>Genentech Stock Hit After Drug Study</HD>
<DH>Biotech: Shares fall 12% as unauthorized release of
findings for promising cancer treatment Avastin point to side
effects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANGELA ZIMM</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Genentech Inc. shares fell 12% on Thursday after a study raised
concerns about the safety of its experimental Avastin cancer drug and
prospects for U.S. approval.</LD>
<LD>   The study's findings, which analysts said point to side effects
such as bleeding and high blood pressure, were supposed to remain
under wraps until the American Society for Clinical Oncology's
meeting next month. The society said it is investigating how some
investors may have gained access to an abstract of the findings.</LD>
<LD>   Avastin has the biggest sales potential among Genentech's drugs in
late-stage development, analysts said. The drug, the most advanced of
a class of cancer medications designed to work by strangling a
tumor's blood supply, was being tested in breast, lung and colon
cancer.</LD>
<TE>   "As expected, there were some side effects that we were not overly
concerned about," said Merrill Lynch analyst Eric Hecht in a note to
clients. "We would note that the more important efficacy data is not
expected to be available until summer."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp; Co. said that Genentech
may need additional studies of Avastin in breast-cancer patients,
which may delay a filing for U.S. regulatory approval.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech shares Thursday fell $5.37 to $37.75 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   It's not uncommon for shares of companies to move when abstracts
for a medical meeting become available, even though most medical
organizations, including ASCO, try to limit discussion of the
research before a meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The Genentech data haven't been released by ASCO in any form. All
of the abstracts being presented at the meeting are slated for
release to ASCO's 18,000 members sometime next week and are being
stored on a separate server from the one that runs the group's Web
site, ASCO officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting calls [from people] saying they have seen the
abstracts but they won't provide a copy or tell me where they came
from," said Michelle Kirkwood, a spokeswoman for ASCO. "We are going
the other route now, checking our servers and making sure our
security hasn't been breached."</TE>
<TE>   Genentech said it has been contacted by several people who say
they have seen the ASCO abstracts. The company hasn't discussed or
distributed any information about its presentation, according to
Genentech spokesman Neil Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen wouldn't give any details about what the company would
present, citing ASCO's policy of removing an abstract from the
program if a company discusses its contents before the meeting.</TE>

<HD>Tax Avoiders Cost About $70 Billion, Senators Are Told</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tax cheats cost the U.S. government as much as $70 billion a year, a
Senate panel was told Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Tax evaders and government officials testified before the Senate
Finance Committee as the panel's top two senators, Max Baucus
(D-Mont.) and Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), introduced legislation
intended to stem a tide of U.S. companies moving their legal
headquarters to Bermuda to escape taxes.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got a problem," said Baucus, who pointed out that the vast
majority of individual taxpayers will do their duty by Monday's
income tax filing deadline. "Everyone should help pull the wagon....
Otherwise, we'll reach the point where honest taxpayers will feel
like chumps."</LD>
<TE>   The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, found
that for the 2000 tax year the IRS so far has detected about $5
billion in improper tax avoidance by 740,000 individuals. GAO
estimated that another $20 billion to $40billion had not been
identified.</TE>
<TE>   Baucus cited an unofficial estimate of $70 billion in losses each
year. IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti said the secretive nature of
tax evasion makes concrete estimates difficult but conceded it was in
the "tens of billions" of dollars every year.</TE>
<TE>   These schemes take many forms, from bogus "slavery reparation" tax
refunds marketed to African Americans to claims that income tax is
unconstitutional to complex, multilayered foreign trusts that enable
high-income people to hide assets.</TE>
<TE>   One scheme that is beginning to unravel involves credit cards
issued by offshore banks that are used by people to live very well
while hiding their income behind foreign bank secrecy laws. The IRS
is gaining access to these credit card records through court summons
and checking them against tax returns. With corporate tax shelters
also on the rise, Baucus and Grassley became the most powerful
lawmakers to introduce legislation that would remove the tax
advantages for U.S. companies that relocate headquarters to Bermuda.</TE>
<TE>   The Baucus-Grassley bill, dubbed the "REPO Act," would deem the
new foreign-based parent as a domestic corporation for U.S. tax
purposes in some cases and enhance IRS scrutiny of tax transactions
in other cases.</TE>

<HD>New Rules for Trade Disclosures Approved</HD>
<DH>Reform: SEC OKs earlier deadlines to report insider stock
transactions and key company financial data.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday took the first
major steps toward reform of corporate disclosure practices,
approving proposed rules to speed reporting of insider stock
transactions and key company financial data.</LD>
<LD>   The agency's commissioners unanimously OKd a proposed rule to make
companies disclose executive stock trades in as little as two days,
to give investors early clues about the faith that corporate leaders
may have in their firms.</LD>
<LD>   A second proposal approved Thursday would shorten by one-third the
deadlines for firms to file annual and quarterly reports.</LD>
<TE>   Both of the rule changes were spurred by Enron Corp.'s collapse,
which was preceded by heavy sales of stock by some insiders. Many
experts argued that the energy trader's hidden financial woes might
have become apparent to investors earlier if disclosure rules were
tightened.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC's proposed changes would require companies to disclose
sales and purchases of stock by corporate insiders on the SEC's 8-K
or "current report" format, which companies now file to report
important news. Transactions or loans totaling more than $100,000
would need to be filed within two business days, with longer
deadlines for smaller transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, corporate insiders are responsible for disclosing their
stock transactions, not the companies. For some kinds of
transactions, such as sales back to the company, executives have
until 45 days after the end of a firm's fiscal year before they must
report.</TE>
<TE>   The second rule change would require companies to file annual
reports within 60 days instead of 90 days after the end of a fiscal
year. Quarterly financial filings would be required within 30 days
instead of 45 days.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed rule on trade disclosures will be open for public
comment for 60 days before the SEC votes on whether to make the
proposal permanent. The proposal on accelerated filing of quarterly
and annual reports will be open for public comment for 30 days.</TE>
<TE>   JetBlue Airways Raises</TE>
<TE>   $158.5 Million in IPO</TE>
<TE>   JetBlue Airways Corp., the 2-year-old discount airline, raised
$158.5 million in its initial public offering Thursday after twice
boosting the sale to meet demand from investors.</TE>
<TE>   New York-based JetBlue sold more shares at a price higher than it
was seeking. The airline sold 5.87million shares at $27 each, up from
the 5.5 million shares at $25 to $26 it had expected to offer.</TE>
<TE>   The airline, which operates from Long Beach Airport and Ontario
Airport in the Southland, is run by businessman David Neeleman and is
backed by investors such as George Soros and JP Morgan Partners. It
has lured customers with new planes, leather seats, reliable service
and inexpensive coast-to-coast fares starting at $114 each way. It
enticed investors with promises of increasing earnings and steady
expansion.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to be a winner," said John Hammerschmidt, an aviation
analyst at money manager Turner Investment Inc. "They seem to have
gone into a market niche that makes it hard for competitors to catch
up."</TE>
<TE>   The IPO marks the first time since Netscreen Technologies Inc.
went public in December that a company has found enough demand to
twice boost its offering, according to Dealogic, which tracks IPOs.
When JetBlue first filed terms of its sale in March the company was
seeking a share price of $22 to $24.</TE>
<TE>   The stock will begin trading today on Nasdaq under the ticker
symbol JBLU.</TE>

<HD>SEC Complaint Alleges Fraud at Xerox</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Record fine of $10 million is approved. Regulators
say top executives inflated revenue to meet targets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Xerox Corp.'s top executives led a four-year scheme to inflate
revenue by $3 billion to meet Wall Street's growth targets, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said Thursday in approving a
record $10-million fine against the company.</LD>
<LD>   The size of the penalty, the largest against a public company for
financial fraud, reflects the magnitude of Xerox's deception and its
failure to cooperate with the SEC investigation, SEC Associate
Enforcement Director Paul R. Berger said. Xerox previously had said
it agreed to a preliminary settlement.</LD>
<LD>   The accounting manipulations by Xerox, one of the best-known U.S.
companies, had "enormous impact" on the company's reported financial
performance, the SEC said.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC complaint, filed in Manhattan federal court, alleged that
Xerox's senior executives quashed objections to the flawed figures
from subordinates and from the company's auditor, KPMG.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the executives were making tens of millions of
dollars in bonuses and sales of personal stock at the inflated prices
that resulted from the fraud, the suit charged.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said its inquiry of Xerox's abuses is continuing. Former
Chairman and Chief Executive Paul Allaire and former Chief Financial
Officer Barry Romeril are among the executives under investigation, a
person knowledgeable about the probe said.</TE>
<TE>   KPMG also said it is still under SEC investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Stamford, Conn.-based Xerox, which neither admitted nor denied
wrongdoing, has almost 90 days to restate results for 1997 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Its shares fell 24 cents to $9.70 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Insurance to Cover Enron Executives' Legal Bills</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A federal judge Thursday cleared the way for Enron Corp. executives
and directors to start collecting insurance payments to cover their
legal bills arising from the nation's biggest business failure.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents had argued it would be improper for payouts to go to
people who might have helped destroy Enron. But Judge Arthur J.
Gonzalez in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan said the officials are
entitled to legal coverage under the company-purchased insurance
policies.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of current and former Enron executives and directors,
including former Chairman Kenneth L. Lay, former Chief Executive
Jeffrey K. Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S.
Fastow, have been named in lawsuits and investigations stemming from
the energy trading firm's collapse. Lawyers for some of them said
delays in obtaining the payouts could jeopardize their defense.</LD>
<TE>   Jeff Boyd, deputy attorney general for Texas, had asked the court
to require Enron officials to put up collateral for any insurance
funds they receive so that the money can be recovered if they are
later found to have engaged in wrongdoing and therefore are
ineligible for coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez declined to set any such conditions, but neither did he
issue what Boyd called a "get-out-of-jail-free card" that would have
exempted Aegis, the lead insurance company, from liability if it
makes payments to executives who are later found ineligible.</TE>

<HD>Mattel Alters Severance Policy After Barad Payment
Criticism</HD>
<DH>Toys: Firm won't grant benefits 'significantly' exceeding
requirements, as in case of former CEO.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Mattel Inc. revised its policy on severance awards after shareholder
criticism of a $50-million send-off that the toy company gave to
former top officer Jill Barad.</LD>
<LD>   Under the new rules, Mattel in most cases won't grant a departing
executive severance benefits that "significantly exceed" the
requirements of the officer's employment contract, according to a
proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In
setting severance, the committee also will consider the effect of the
exit package on the morale of other employees.</LD>
<LD>   When Barad stepped down in February 2000 as chairwoman and chief
executive of the El Segundo-based company, institutional investors
were angered by the payments she received.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to $26.4 million in cash required under her employment
contract, Barad's awards included a $1.2-million annual pension for
10 years and forgiveness of a company loan.</TE>
<TE>   These awards came even though Mattel's stock declined more than
50%--to about $11 from $28--in the three years she ran the company.</TE>
<TE>   Mattel's financial performance suffered in part from Barad's
decision to acquire the money-losing software business Learning Co.,
creator of Carmen Sandiego games, for nearly $3.6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Mattel didn't give a reason for the changes in the proxy statement
and a spokeswoman didn't return a telephone call seeking comment. One
factor might have been the inclusion of director Ralph Whitworth as a
member of the compensation committee.</TE>
<TE>   Whitworth is a former president of the United Shareholders Assn.,
a shareholder rights group that pushed the SEC to change its
compensation disclosure rules. Whitworth, who has pushed for change
at other companies, did not return a telephone call seeking comment.</TE>

<HD>Brokerage Probe Gains Momentum</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Investigation of potential conflicts of interest
by analysts widens, raising question of industry reform.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN and E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York state attorney general's investigation of brokerage
analysts' potential conflicts of interest is stoking a new firestorm
of debate over Wall Street practices and how best to reform them.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer, in a legal action Monday, alleged that
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s Internet-research department routinely made
stock touts driven largely by the firm's desire to snare lucrative
investment banking work from the recommended companies.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Spitzer is taking the inquiry industrywide: According to
sources, six other major brokerages--Credit Suisse First Boston
Corp., Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., Citicorp Inc.'s
Salomon Smith Barney unit, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and UBS PaineWebber
Inc.--have received subpoenas, some of them in the last two weeks,
and more are likely to be handed out as the probe unfolds.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for the attorney general's office confirmed only that
several other firms have been subpoenaed as investigators seek to
preserve records, but declined to name the firms.</TE>
<TE>   "This investigation could be the tip of the iceberg," spokesman
Daren Dopp said. "Based upon the e-mail correspondence at Merrill
Lynch, it's clear that Merrill analysts were fearful of competitors
wooing many of the same investment banking clients."</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's affidavit filed Monday detailed findings from a 10-month
probe of Merrill's Internet-research group formerly headed by
high-profile analyst Henry Blodget. Spitzer's report, based on a
review of 30,000 documents, including thousands of e-mails, alleges
the analysts often publicly recommended stocks that they privately
believed were "junk."</TE>
<TE>   A stock featured prominently in the attorney general's inquiry is
GoTo.com, now Overture Services. The report alleges that Merrill
tried to win banking business from the Pasadena-based firm in 2000
and 2001 by twisting its recommendations on the stock to please the
firm's management.</TE>
<TE>   Overture officials did not return a call for comment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's legal filing Monday asked a state Supreme Court judge to
force Merrill to immediately add new disclosures in its research
reports, pending the outcome of his investigation. The disclosures
would involve Merrill's relationships or potential relationships with
firms it may recommend.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Merrill won a delay until April 19 to comply with
Spitzer's disclosure request.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's report roiled an industry already struggling with
credibility problems and parallel investigations by federal
regulators, industry self-regulatory groups and the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Industry sources said most if not all major securities firms had
been working with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
National Assn. of Securities Dealers and the New York Stock Exchange
to develop new research-disclosure rules similar to, and in some
cases stronger than, those Spitzer asked the judge to impose on
Merrill.</TE>
<TE>   "The SEC is furious because they've been working on this with the
investment banks," said one source at a major bank, speaking on
condition of anonymity. "It's like the situation with the tobacco
litigation--unmanageable with the feds and the state thing going on
at once."</TE>
<TE>   At Merrill, which on Monday rejected Spitzer's charges as "just
plain wrong," officials tried to portray the firm as a leader in
ensuring that disclosures are complete and that analysts operate
without conflicts of interest with investment banking.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike some firms, Merrill never allowed analysts to purchase
pre-initial public offering shares of companies in their coverage
areas, and last summer it prohibited analysts from acquiring any more
shares in companies in their industries, spokesman Bill Halldin said.</TE>
<TE>   Some brokerages said they were not aware of whether Spitzer is
investigating them. Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. said
they had received nothing indicating they are targets.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, investment banking sources said Spitzer's report
appears to present huge new legal and credibility problems for
Merrill and probably the entire industry.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's investigation may have enough momentum, and evidence, to
force major reforms in the industry to restore analysts' credibility,
some say.</TE>
<TE>   Although Wall Street firms have been scurrying to unveil changes
to their stock rating systems, the overwhelmingly positive bias among
analysts appears to be shifting only gradually.</TE>
<TE>   As of April 1, 2.6% of brokerage stock recommendations were
negative, according to data tracker Thomson Financial/First Call, up
slightly from 1.4% a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the analysts' recommendations were either "buy" or
"hold" suggestions.</TE>
<TE>   But experts are divided on how far industry reform can and should
go. Some investor advocates, such as Nell Minow, Washington-based
editor of the Corporate Library, believe brokerage investment banking
and research units should become separate firms--a step Spitzer has
tried to negotiate with Merrill.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that analysts' credibility has been so thoroughly undermined,
what's the point in having them? They are a throwback to the days
when information was received by ticker tape," Minow said. "The only
way this can work is if you separate investment banking and research
completely."</TE>
<TE>   Others say separation may be an unrealistic goal.</TE>
<TE>   "Is there a workable device for enforcing monastic neutrality
between research providers and investment bankers? I doubt it," said
Roy Smith, a finance professor at New York University.</TE>
<TE>   Meaningful reform may have to come voluntarily from within the
industry, many say.</TE>
<TE>   "Wall Street is going to have to do whatever it takes to regain
its credibility within the investor base," Smith said. "If the
industry fails to regain credibility, it has a much more serious
problem than Eliot Spitzer."</TE>

<HD>Justice Dept. and Andersen Continue Talks</HD>
<DH>Probe: The two sides are at odds over a guilty plea. The
accounting firm resumes negotiations with the SEC.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH and WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Justice Department is in active plea negotiations with Andersen
over the accounting firm's indictment on an obstruction of justice
charge, sources said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The talks follow a significant advance in the government's case
Tuesday when Andersen's former top auditor handling Enron Corp.
pleaded guilty to a similar charge for destroying documents sought in
a federal probe of Enron's accounting practices.</LD>
<LD>   Justice Department officials, however, refused to speculate on the
future status of the closely watched case.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Andersen has resumed negotiations in the last few days
with the Securities and Exchange Commission about settling civil
charges stemming from Enron's collapse, a source said. Critical
issues remain outstanding, including how much, if any, money Andersen
would pay in a fine, the source said. However, another person
predicted that the talks would move forward quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the SEC sought to fine Andersen as much as $500
million. But Andersen's deteriorating financial condition means any
payment now is likely to be significantly less than half that amount,
a source said.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement sources said the Justice Department wants Andersen
to acknowledge responsibility for its conduct, cooperate in the Enron
probe and enact meaningful reforms.</TE>
<TE>   But "nothing has changed" in the status of those negotiations
since lawyers for the two sides first met last Friday, an official
said.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton confirmed that negotiations were
continuing but he declined to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen, which is trying to reinvent itself as a smaller,
audit-oriented accounting firm through a plan devised by former
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker, has sought to get the
government to dismiss or suspend its one-count indictment.</TE>
<TE>   The firm wants to avoid admitting guilt because such a pleading
would make it difficult to continue auditing public companies.
Generally, a person or company that pleads guilty or is convicted of
a felony is prohibited from practicing before the SEC and would be
barred from conducting public company audits. They can only be
reinstated by the commission after a special hearing. Andersen's
trial is scheduled to start May 6.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts have speculated that any deal in the criminal case
could resemble an agreement reached between the government and
Prudential Securities in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Prudential admitted criminal wrongdoing in the sale of energy
partnerships. It paid $330 million into a restitution fund to
reimburse investors, but averted criminal indictment. The government
agreed not to prosecute Prudential as long as it enacted reforms and
did not engage in more criminal acts.</TE>
<TE>   In such a "deferred prosecution," a defendant typically
acknowledges wrongdoing and agrees to certain conditions, such as
making financial restitution to victims. If the conditions are
satisfied, the government either dismisses a charge or doesn't file a
charge.</TE>
<TE>   Deferred prosecutions are rare, especially for corporations. For
individuals, they are normally applied only to first-time offenders
and those who have committed less serious crimes.</TE>
<TE>   However, its possible use in the Andersen case could be a way for
the Justice Department to crack down on what it views as egregious
wrongdoing without automatically putting the firm out of business,
said Gary Lincenberg, a partner at Bird, Marella, Boxer &amp; Wolpert in
Century City.</TE>
<TE>   "The Justice Department could [be thinking], 'This conduct is
serious and we cannot just ignore it. We need to prosecute,'"
Lincenberg said. "'At the same time, it's not our goal to bring down
a Big 5 accounting firm.'"</TE>
<TE>   Such a strategy looks to be one of the few courses left to
Andersen after the guilty plea by its top Enron auditor, David B.
Duncan, and his cooperation with the government, said Charlie Parker,
an attorney who represents investors in lawsuits against Andersen and
Enron's senior management.</TE>
<TE>   Parker said it's unlikely there will be any significant movement
in settlement talks for the civil litigation in the immediate future.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no way at this point that Andersen can come up with
enough money where the plaintiffs would be willing to do a
settlement," Parker said.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has lost more than 150 major clients and hundreds of
millions in revenue since Enron's bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   The firm is trying to sell its tax business and if it survives it
probably will be half the company that collected $4.3 billion in U.S.
revenue last year.</TE>
<TE>   It has offered $300 million to settle the civil litigation.
Attorneys for Enron investors want to wait to see if they can force
investment banks that were added to the class-action lawsuit Monday
to the negotiating table, Parker said.</TE>
<TE>   But Parker said that won't happen until after a judge rules on
their expected motions asking to be dismissed from the case.</TE>

<HD>Florida Puts Squeeze on Calif. Growers</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Tax on citrus juice from other states could
lead to a push for retaliatory measures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A move by Florida to tax orange juice from California and other
states is threatening to touch off a citrus war.</LD>
<LD>   Florida lawmakers recently voted to institute a tax on juice from
other citrus-producing states after importers of frozen orange juice
from Brazil and elsewhere complained that Florida's 32-year-old
"equalization tax" was discriminatory by taxing only foreign
producers, a violation of the Commerce Clause.</LD>
<LD>   Florida lawmakers recently resolved the dispute by voting to tax
all out-of-state producers as well as imports.</LD>
<TE>   Florida is far and away the leading U.S. orange-juice-producing
state; most California oranges are produced for consumption as fresh
fruit.</TE>
<TE>   About 6 million gallons of frozen concentrate from California,
Arizona, Texas and elsewhere is used each year by Florida processors
to improve their juice's color and give it the tart, tangy flavor
that consumers have come to expect.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a huge business for California producers--and much
smaller than the 32 million gallons shipped in from foreign
producers--but it provides Southern California's struggling Valencia
orange growers a second market for their product, and a home for
navel oranges that fail to pass muster for the supermarket produce
aisle, said Scott Mabs, director of grower relations for California
Citrus Mutual, a trade association.</TE>
<TE>   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is expected to sign the bill, which has been
approved by both houses of the Legislature. It would take affect this
summer.</TE>
<TE>   California citrus processors say the tax is both punishing and
unfair, given that most of the $3 million to $4 million in revenue
from the tax is used to market "100% Florida orange juice."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it's that point that originally touched off the trade war
with foreign producers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just going to depress the value of our products and that
will affect what we can pay growers," said Bill Borgers of Ventura
Coastal Corp., which ships concentrate to Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Executives at Sherman Oaks-based Sunkist Growers say it could cost
its 6,000 growers in California and Arizona up to $1 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Some industry officials are even hinting at a retaliatory tax on
Florida juice moving into California plants--a move that could hurt
Florida more, industry officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "They have five times the juice headed this way," said Sunkist
spokesman Mike Wootton.</TE>
<TE>   A California tax, if adopted, would raise money for
marketing--aiding California growers and processors--but it also
could lead to slightly higher prices.</TE>
<TE>   But it could be considered discriminatory as well, Florida
officials say, unless the state's own producers are taxed.</TE>
<TE>   California citrus industry officials have not met with California
lawmakers to discuss this idea.</TE>
<TE>   Florida Department of Citrus officials tried to head off this kind
of action by making a trip to California this week.</TE>
<TE>   Sunkist officials said they did not talk about a repeal of the
tax, but rather ways that both states could benefit from the funds.</TE>
<TE>   The five importers that sued Florida are now seeking an injunction
to block future collection of the tax, now that a Polk County Circuit
Court judge has found it unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   The importers also are seeking a refund of the $10 million in tax
they paid over the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   "Eighty-five percent of what my clients paid in equalization taxes
is used to promote their competitor's products," said Kristen Gunter,
a Florida attorney representing the import firms.</TE>
<TE>   These firms also are pursuing a 1st Amendment challenge to the tax
on this basis.</TE>
<TE>   A ruling is expected in the next week on the injunction request,
and the refund may be decided in July.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Brazil--the world's largest orange grower and juice-
concentrate maker--has taken a complaint over these funds to the
World Trade Organization.</TE>
<TE>   Florida citrus officials insist that they are only trying to level
the playing field for producers--because Florida growers are taxed on
their oranges by the box. They say they are not trying to gain an
edge over their out-of-state and foreign competitors.</TE>
<TE>   With its advertising, said Mia McKown, general counsel for the
Florida Department of Citrus, "our mission is just to increase
consumption of orange juice."</TE>

<HD>Clinton to Serve as Advisor to Burkle</HD>
<DH>Financial services: The ex-president will work for the
political patron's private equity firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former President Clinton has been hired to help advise his magnate
friend and political patron Ron Burkle on investments.</LD>
<LD>   Clinton was hired as a senior advisor to Yucaipa Cos., Burkle's
Los Angeles-based private equity firm. Clinton's services will
include advising a Yucaipa investment fund aimed at buoying
underserved urban and rural markets, an effort that parallels a
policy initiative the former president launched from the White House.</LD>
<LD>   Clinton won't have an office or keep regular hours at Yucaipa,
company spokesman Ari Swiller said Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   But the former president will attend meetings and conferences and
promote a pair of funds, including the Yucaipa Corporate Initiatives
Fund.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Yucaipa Corporate Initiatives won the opportunity to
invest $200 million in California Public Employees' Retirement System
funds in low-income communities in an effort aimed at spurring
economic development.</TE>
<TE>   As president, Clinton touted such socially responsible investing
through his New Markets Initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "He will be able to articulate and visualize for people how best
to make this work," Swiller said. "We're excited both to use his mind
and to use the opportunity for him to help us bring people together."</TE>
<TE>   Clinton's New York office issued a statement, saying he agreed to
the position because of the company's commitment to invest in
untapped domestic markets.</TE>
<TE>   Yucaipa won't say what the former president will earn in his new
role.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton, who operates out of a publicly funded office in Harlem,
left office facing $3.9 million in legal fees related to his
impeachment hearings and other probes.</TE>
<TE>   He is under contract to write his memoirs for a reported $10
million and is believed to earn $125,000 to $250,000 for each
appearance and speech he makes around the world. He also receives a
presidential pension of $161,200 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Landing the former leader of the free world was a marketing and
public relations coup for Burkle, a former supermarket magnate who
co-hosted the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles and
teamed with star agent Michael Ovitz in a bid to bring a professional
football franchise to the city.</TE>
<TE>   While president, Clinton frequently visited Burkle during trips to
Southern California. Burkle has contributed to both parties.</TE>
<TE>   "His association certainly would help draw attention to the
Yucaipa Cos.," said Jim Mitchell of Mitchell Partners, an investment
partnership based in Costa Mesa. "Right now, they are not
particularly well-known in the investment community, so there could
be an immediate plus."</TE>
<TE>   Yucaipa was the vehicle that Burkle used to acquire grocery chains
Food4Less and Ralphs, which he later sold.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, former Vice President Al Gore joined another Los
Angeles-based private investment firm as vice chairman, a role in
which he was expected to open doors and drum up investors.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Clinton's value is in his list of contacts and his
virtually unlimited entree in political and business circles, said
Jeffrey Christian, founder of Christian &amp; Timbers, a Cleveland-based
executive recruiting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, at 55, Clinton has plenty of steam, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a guy who can be incredibly effective," Christian said.
"He is someone who oozes confidence and is kind of fun to be around.
He is somebody people are going to enjoy doing business with."</TE>
<TE>   But University of Virginia political science professor Larry J.
Sabato bemoaned Clinton's foray into the business world as the latest
example of modern-day presidents trading the cachet of the Oval
Office for lucrative book deals, speeches and other moneymaking
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "All the presidents get enormous speaking fees for a set, pat
speech," Sabato said. "I've told my students we shouldn't pay
presidents. They should pay us for the privi- lege of serving in
office because everyone enriches himself after office."</TE>
<TE>   Because of his youthful exit from public life, Clinton faces a
greater opportunity to make money than other former presidents,
Sabato said.</TE>
<TE>   "Clinton's shooting for great wealth, and he's likely to get it,"
he said. "I wouldn't be surprised if he were worth tens of millions
in 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   Sabato also said he found it odd that Clinton would land a role in
an investment company given his involvement in the scandal-plagued
Whitewater real estate investment deal.</TE>
<TE>   Yucaipa's Swiller accused Sabato of having a selective memory.</TE>
<TE>   "Professor Sabato forgets that Clinton was president for eight
years during a record economic boom," he said.</TE>

<HD>TV Codes Disclosure Alleged</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A cadre of engineers employed by a subsidiary of News Corp. Inc.
cracked the security codes of a rival's satellite TV descrambler,
leading to their dissemination on the Internet by a man described as
well-known hacker, according to new court documents.</LD>
<LD>   The documents were filed in connection with a lawsuit brought
against News Corp subsidiary NDS Group by Vivendi Universal's Canal
Plus Group, which alleges that disclosure of the codes undermined the
company's sale of "smart cards." Canal is seeking more than $1
billion in damages.</LD>
<LD>   In a sworn declaration, a consultant for security software
manufacturer NDS said the codes were put into a document circulated
among company employees. Consultant Oliver Kommerling said it was
then agreed that the codes should be provided to NDS employee Chris
Tarnovsky for publication on the Web. In its litigation, Canal Plus
has identified Tarnovsky as "a well-known pirate within the hacker
community."</LD>
<TE>   NDS has denied the allegations against Tarnovsky and other company
employees, calling the Canal lawsuit "outrageous and baseless." A
spokesman for the parent firm, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., said the
company does not comment on pending litigation.</TE>
<TE>   The warring companies, controlled by two of the world's biggest
entertainment conglomerates, make "conditional access software" that
is used to prevent people from watching pay-per-view and other
premium programming for free.</TE>
<TE>   After the code was published on a Web site allegedly frequented by
counterfeiters in March 1999, the market was flooded with phony smart
cards, Canal alleges, describing the breach as part of an illegal
conspiracy to undercut a competitor.</TE>
<TE>   The Kommerling declaration was one of half a dozen Canal filed
this month to expedite the discovery process in the case, which is
being heard in federal court in San Jose. Canal is anxious to speed
the suit because the company is introducing a new generation of smart
cards and wants to protect their security.</TE>
<TE>   In another declaration, Canal security executive Gilles Kaehlin
said that man who allegedly placed the codes on the Web, Tarnovsky,
admitted to him in a meeting in London last summer that "NDS was
responsible for the 'dump' and publication of the Canal Plus Rom code
on the DR7 Web site.''</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge will hold a hearing on Canal's motion for
expedited discovery Thursday.</TE>

<LD>The Alameda Corridor, which opens today, has secured Southern
California's position as the leading U.S. center of international
trade.</LD>
<LD>   Now it's time to deal with other challenges facing this region's
trade economy.</LD>
<LD>   The corridor is only one of many investments this state and region
must make to remain competitive in global trade. The region must
invest in additional rail corridors to help relieve congestion and
accommodate the certain growth of cargo volumes. The port facilities
must continue to be modernized to cope with increasing demands of
shippers and competition from ports elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   Also, the region must decide on a new cargo airport as a companion
to Los Angeles International. That is key not only to air cargo but
also to the region's future in manu- facturing.</TE>
<TE>   Much is at stake. The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach now are
the world's third-busiest ports, after Hong Kong and Singapore. LAX
is the second-busiest cargo airport--after Memphis, headquarters of
FedEx Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Leadership in trade is valuable. The flow of more than $200
billion in imports and exports through this region results directly
in almost half a million jobs, ranging from bankers to stevedores to
software engineers to warehouse handlers.</TE>
<TE>   It takes money to sustain this leadership. The reason for spending
$2.4 billion to build the Alameda Corridor was to prevent ships from
being backed up in the ports. The 20-mile corridor rail trench runs
from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to rail yards near
downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "The corridor allows the ports to process the enormous increase in
goods coming from Asia, particularly China," says James Hankla, head
of the Alameda Corridor Authority.</TE>
<TE>   But the Alameda Corridor is not enough. An additional $1.25
billion is being spent to complete two companion "corridors" to move
cargo trains out through the San Gabriel Valley and north Orange
County to San Bernardino and Colton, where the Union Pacific and
Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroads dispatch shipments to Chicago,
Texas and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Work on Alameda East, a $900-million project to construct railroad
grade crossings in the San Gabriel Valley, is not far along. The
$350-million Placentia Corridor in Orange County has completed
planning and started construction.</TE>
<TE>   And those proposed rail corridors don't even deal with a
tremendous local problem. Half of the goods shipped through the ports
stay here, but the trucks used to deliver this cargo locally are
clogging highways to such destinations as Ontario and the Inland
Empire, says John Husing, a San Bernardino-based economist. It will
take new thinking and new money to ease that congestion.</TE>
<TE>   Past investments to deepen and modernize the harbors gave Los
Angeles and Long Beach an unbeatable edge over Oakland, San
Francisco, Seattle-Tacoma and other West Coast ports. But global
trade is becoming more sophisticated and shippers more demanding as
cargo volumes expand.</TE>
<TE>   Already, shippers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are avoiding
Southern California and sending some goods in smaller ships through
the Panama Canal to Charleston, S.C., and Norfolk, Va., which are
closer to Eastern population centers.</TE>
<TE>   Cargo volumes are going to get larger. China is building up the
port of Shanghai with the most modern equipment. The port of Hong
Kong, which moves cargo from southern China, can process containers
faster than any port on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   All of which has meaning for upcoming labor negotiations at the
ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. A major issue will be attempts
by shippers to introduce automated gates that can read bar codes on
containers and thus move them through faster. The International
Longshore Workers union is opposing introduction of such equipment.
If there is labor strife or the ports fail to increase productivity,
shippers will find alternatives, experts in the logistics industry
say.</TE>
<TE>   Air cargo, a vital part of this region's industry, may be
overlooked in today's celebrations of the Alameda Corridor. But the
growth of trade makes it imperative that Southern California get
serious about establishing another cargo airport as a companion to
LAX. The products that this region specializes in, such as biomedical
instruments and electronic parts, are high-value items that normally
ship by air.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's refusal to build a new airport and San Diego's
growing need for one only reinforce the need for a new air cargo
facility, probably in the Inland Empire.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, trade is no longer a simple two-way street. Goods now
move from one country to another and then on to another.</TE>
<TE>   In this region, many electronic parts go back and forth, with
facilities in Asia and Latin America doing part of the work and
factories here doing other parts. That's the way MTC Worldwide in
City of Industry manages to circulate computer hard drives among
customers in Taiwan, Japan, China and the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Thus international trade, which has expanded employment in the
logistics industry, also contributes to this region's wealth of
manufacturing jobs. More than 605,000 Southern Californians are
employed in manufacturing, according to the Los Angeles County
Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The opening of the Alameda Corridor today underscores the
emergence of Southern California as a major center in the continually
developing colossus of trade that is the Pacific Rim. It is part of a
historic process that demands an expansion of vision to see that this
entertainment capital and center of aerospace and defense work
maintains its place also as a great international port region.</TE>

<HD>GE Dives on Flat Revenue</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Sales news sends company's shares down 9% and
helps spark a market sell-off.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Electric Co.'s stock tumbled 9% on Thursday after the
conglomerate, under fire to disclose more detailed financial data,
reported a problem that's plain as day: Its sales aren't growing.</LD>
<LD>   GE disappointed investors--and helped drag down the entire stock
market--by reporting first-quarter revenue that was nearly unchanged
from a year earlier at $30.5 billion, further indicating that the
U.S. economic rebound has a long way to go. The company is considered
a bellwether of the economy because its segments include appliances,
energy power systems, medical equipment, financial services and the
NBC television network.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, GE's report came on top of a gloomy outlook posted
earlier this week by technology giant IBM Corp., also known for its
historically steady growth. IBM said its first-quarter revenue and
profit would fall well short of forecasts.</LD>
<TE>   "The business environment is still very tough," Keith Sherin, GE's
chief financial officer, said during the company's first-ever
earnings conference call available to the public.</TE>
<TE>   GE held the call, and provided more detail in its financial
statements, to assuage critics who complained that GE hasn't been
forthcoming enough about its results. In the aftermath of the Enron
Corp. and Andersen accounting scandals, even GE--despite its long
history of strong earnings and revenue growth under former Chief
Executive Jack Welch Jr.--has been criticized for lacking financial
disclosure.</TE>
<TE>   So GE's quarterly results under new CEO Jeffrey Immelt, while
always newsworthy, turned into a mini-event Thursday. But the
show-stopper was the subsequent drop in GE's stock, one of the most
widely held issues. GE fell $3.45 to $33.75 a share on the New York
Stock Exchange, and 79 million shares changed hands. The decline
wiped out $33 billion of investors' wealth, but GE's total market
value is still the nation's highest at $332 billion.</TE>
<TE>   GE's profit--the normal focus of the company's quarterly
results--was about as expected although the Fairfield, Conn.-based
behemoth did post a rare earnings decline, its first in seven years.
GE said profit dipped 3% from a year earlier after it adapted to
required changes in financial-reporting standards, which resulted in
more than $1 billion in noncash charges against earnings. Excluding
those changes and other one-time items, GE's net income rose 17% to
$3.52billion, or 35 cents a share, from a year earlier--matching
forecasts of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   With its renowned attention to cost controls, innovation and
acquisitions, GE managed the profit despite having no revenue
increase. And "it's the revenue side that people are spooked about,"
said Adam Friedman, manager of the Armada Large Cap Value fund.</TE>
<TE>   GE's situation would have been even worse except for its
power-systems group, which has been thriving with record demand from
the energy industry for GE's power-generation turbines. But that
business is slowing, too, putting pressure on GE's other groups to
pick up the slack.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to make double-digit earnings growth tougher to come
by in the next couple years," said William Fiala, analyst at the
brokerage firm Edward Jones &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   GE's huge financial-services arm, GE Capital, also reported a 6%
drop in revenue, in good part because of lower market interest rates.
GE Capital, in fact, has been the main target of critics such as Bill
Gross, who runs the nation's largest bond fund at Newport Beach-based
Pacific Investment Management Co.</TE>
<TE>   Gross complained last month that GE was carrying too much
short-term debt and wasn't disclosing enough details about that debt
and other financial matters.</TE>
<TE>   Gross told Bloomberg TV that while he did not listen to the
conference call, his staff did and their comments suggest GE is
"making progress" in its disclosure. But he said the push for more
information "isn't a GE thing, it's a corporate America thing," and
he "would continue to urge that all corporations issue forth more
disclosure."</TE>

<HD>Global Crossing Offers Bonus Plan</HD>
<DH>Bankruptcy: Firm seeks court approval to pay up to
$15million to key execs this year. Layoffs are still in the works.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd. sought court approval Thursday for a plan that
would pay key executives a total of up to $15 million in bonuses this
year, while noting that it still will cut 16% of its remaining work
force as it refocuses its communications business on existing
customers.</LD>
<LD>   The so-called retention plan, worked out with banking creditors
and the unsecured-creditors committee, would pay nine executive vice
presidents bonuses of up to half of their annual salaries and 295
other high-level executives up to 27.5% of their pay.</LD>
<LD>   Creditors and other parties in the nation's fourth-largest
bankruptcy case have until May 3 to file objections. But the leader
of a shareholders' bid to take over the company pointed out that
everyone is essentially forced to accept the deal.</LD>
<TE>   "Because they're in Chapter 11, they can't hold the company
together" without a bonus plan, said Kennon A. Brennon, who heads a
New York City investment firm proposing a shareholder takeover. "This
is just throwing good money after bad," he said. "It's taking care of
elite executives, and they've been well taken care of already."</TE>
<TE>   The Bermuda-based operator of a worldwide fiber-optic cable
network is revising its business strategy to focus on serving
existing customers rather than on growing the company. In March,
Global said it would fire more than 1,600 employees. So far, it has
reduced its work force to about 5,000 and it soon will shed 813 more
workers.</TE>
<TE>   The company said in its filing that the dismissals and its
financial failure are adversely affecting its ability to keep key
employees, particularly managers and corporate executives. The
company said it "cannot afford to lose the special knowledge,
experience and skills" of those employees.</TE>
<TE>   Under the retention plan, executives already deemed to be key to
the company's business and restructuring effort would share
$10million in bonuses, to be paid in four installments--three this
year and the fourth whenever a reorganization plan is filed or, if it
happens earlier, when the company's assets are sold. The latter may
occur this year as well.</TE>
<TE>   A $5-million pool would be created to retain employees who are or
become essential to the reorganization effort, a determination to be
made by the company's chief executive, John Legere, who will not
participate in the retention or bonus plans.</TE>
<TE>   A company spokeswoman said the creditors committee also approved a
reworked pay package for Legere of up to $10.9 million in salary,
possible bonus and other benefits this year.</TE>

<HD>Key Herbalife Investor Supports Sale</HD>
<DH>Health: Member of investment company Steel Partners II
backs $685-million bid by two private equity firms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An investor who lobbied for the sale of Herbalife International said
Thursday that he supported the $685-million offer for the supplement
maker.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's great," said Warren Lichtenstein, managing member of
Steel Partners II of New York.</LD>
<LD>   Steel Partners II and another investor, Jana Partners of San
Francisco, last year called for the sale of the Los Angeles-based
company after the death of Herbalife founder Mark Hughes. The two
investment firms own 4% of Herbalife shares.</LD>
<TE>   Lichtenstein wouldn't say whether his firm had a role in
negotiations that led to the sale, which was announced Wednesday. But
his support indicates that a possible stumbling block to the deal has
been removed. A representative of Jana Partners couldn't be reached.</TE>
<TE>   Herbalife is being acquired by two private equity firms for about
$685 million, or $19.50 a share. Herbalife's management, including
Chief Executive Frank Tirelli, also is participating in the deal.</TE>
<TE>   When the transaction is completed, probably by midsummer, the
company's management and distributors will own an undetermined
percentage of the company, Tirelli said.</TE>
<TE>   Tirelli said the deal came about because the family trust that
holds Hughes' stock needed to sell its 57% stake in Herbalife to
diversify its assets. He said the Herbalife board reviewed several
offers, which Tirelli declined to identify.</TE>
<TE>   Tirelli said he did not participate in the review.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the offer from Whitney &amp; Co. of Stamford, Conn., and
Golden Gate Capital of San Francisco was the highest bid, Tirelli
said he did not know. But he added that the board probably recognized
the fact that it is an all-cash deal of $19.50 a share, a premium to
Herbalife's close Wednesday. The company's Class A shares closed at
$15.39 and the Class B shares closed at $14.40 before the deal was
announced.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday in Nasdaq trading, Class A shares rose $3.73 to $19.12
and Class B gained $4.65 to $19.05.</TE>
<TE>   Tirelli said Herbalife will take on $300 million in debt to pay
for the deal. It must be approved by regulators and Class A
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes, 44, died two years ago in his $25-million beachfront home
of an accidental overdose of alcohol and sleeping pills. By last
summer, investors pressed for a sale, concerned that the company was
adrift without its charismatic founder.</TE>
<TE>   Herbalife had sales of $1.7 billion in 2001, with about 43% coming
from its dietary supplements.</TE>
<TE>   The supplements have prompted two wrongful death suits against the
company because they contain the herb ephedra. The Food and Drug
Administration has linked the herb to hundreds of adverse reactions
and dozens of deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Herbalife said in its latest annual report that its
product-liability insurance premium soared from $400,000 in 2000 to
$2.5 million last year, even as its deductible increased tenfold to
$5 million, and its coverage limit fell by $10 million to $40
million.</TE>

<HD>A Spate of Bad News Sends Stocks Reeling</HD>
<DH>Markets: Dow falls 2% amid weak GE results. IBM rebounds
after-hours as SEC dispels inquiry fears.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks were hammered Thursday by a barrage of bad news that ranged
from earnings disappointments to a report that yet another big
company could be under investigation for accounting irregularities.</LD>
<LD>   "We are in a skittish time of the year anyway, and the reports
that came out sure didn't bolster anyone's confidence," said David
Brady, senior portfolio manager for the Stein Roe Young Investors
fund.</LD>
<LD>   Dow component General Electric and Internet bellwether Yahoo
slumped after both posted disappointing results. Closely watched and
widely held GE slid $3.45 to $33.75 after it said first-quarter
revenue was nearly unchanged from a year earlier, fresh evidence that
the U.S. economy may not be rebounding as strongly as expected.</LD>
<TE>   Yahoo, considered by many the brightest hope for achieving solid
profits in cyberspace, lost $2.99 to $15.45 after the company posted
its sixth consecutive quarterly loss late Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, IBM, another important Dow stock, dropped more than
5%--losing $4.82 to $84.19--after a Minnesota-based newsletter
reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission was conducting
an investigation of the firm.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC, which normally does not comment on pending
investigations, announced after the market closed that it had ended a
brief, unspecified inquiry into IBM without taking any action. That
sparked an after-hours rally in IBM shares, which rose to $87.27 in
the evening session.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day down 205.65 points,
or 2.0%, at 10,176.08, while the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index
was off 26.78 points, or 2.4%, at 1,103.69. It was the worst one-day
drop for both indexes since Feb. 4.</TE>
<TE>   The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index fell 41.83 points, or 2.4%,
to 1,725.24. Nasdaq, now down 11.5% year to date, is approaching its
low for 2002 of 1,716.24.</TE>
<TE>   Losers outnumbered winners by about 2 to 1 on both Nasdaq and the
New York Stock Exchange. Trading volume was the heaviest it has been
in several weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The raft of unsettling news cast a pall over the market's
near-term prospects. Although leading indicators point to a
continuing recovery, accounting scandals have made investors skittish
about earnings and the veracity of corporate reports. That's making
it difficult for the market to climb out of its two-year slump,
market analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "The market is particularly sensitive to profit shortfalls and
concerns about earnings restatements right now," said Stuart Freeman,
chief equities strategist at AG Edwards in St. Louis. "Investors are
in a 'show-me' mood. I think the volatility we are seeing is going to
continue to drive the environment until the earnings comparisons
start looking strong again."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, though housing and consumer spending remain relatively
strong, companies aren't rushing to rehire workers or boost capital
spending, said Bob Bacarella, president of mutual fund company
Monetta Financial Services Inc. That may have affected how seriously
investors view this recovery--as was demonstrated by the reaction to
GE's lackluster results.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point, the market will turn. But near term, I'm not that
optimistic," he said. "We need to see some signs that growth is
picking up and I'm not seeing enough of that right now."</TE>
<TE>   Investors were unimpressed with Thursday's reports on weekly
jobless-benefits claims. Reports on the March wholesale inflation
index, retail sales and consumer sentiment will offer more clues on
the economy's health today.</TE>
<TE>   First-time jobless claims fell by 55,000 to a seasonally adjusted
438,000 for the week ended April 6, the Labor Department said. But
while these claims decreased last week, the level remained well above
Wall Street's expectations and reflected a pickup over the last few
weeks in applications for extended unemployment benefits.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news Thursday:</TE>
<TE>   * Oil prices plunged $1.14 to $24.99 a barrel in New York
trading--their biggest decline in almost three months--after
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez called for talks to end a strike
that has disrupted shipments from one of the U.S.'s biggest oil
suppliers. Oil shares followed crude lower. ChevronTexaco lost $1.15
to $86.45 while Phillips Petroleum fell 65 cents to $59.70.</TE>
<TE>   * Brokerage shares fell. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. will have until April
19 to make broad disclosure of its investment banking relationships
in stock research reports under an agreement reached with New York
state's attorney general. Its stock sank $4.02, or 8%, to $46.90. The
Amex brokerage index fell 4%.</TE>
<TE>   * AT&amp;T lost $1.15, or 8%, to $13.27 the day after it announced a
1-for-5 reverse stock split to bulk up a stock price that has fallen
30% in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Other telecom stocks fell after a recent slew of financial
warnings in the sector. Sprint PCS fell $1.39, or 13%, to $9.23.
Rival Nextel fell 42 cents, or 9%, to $4.34 after Moody's Investors
Service warned it may cut the firm's credit ratings.</TE>

<HD>Upscale Retail Customers Open Their Wallets Wider in March</HD>
<DH>Economy: Many luxury merchants and discounters post sales
gains. Growth in menswear also is seen.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wealthy consumers stepped up their buying in March, resulting in
better-than-expected sales for some high-end sellers and offering new
hope for an overall economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   Menswear, another long-suffering part of the retail business, also
saw a bit of a pickup, retailers said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to gains reported earlier by some key large jewelry
store chains and apparel manufacturers--and continued strong results
from discount retailers--Tuesday's reports seemed to offer new
evidence of a steady improvement for retailers, a key indicator for
the broader economy.</LD>
<TE>   "These are parts of the retail business that went into recession
first," said Todd Slater, a retail analyst with Lazard in New York.
"We're in the early stages of a recovery and the consumer is hanging
in there."</TE>
<TE>   Saks Inc. on Thursday reported a 2.4% gain in stores open at least
a year, well above predictions of a mid-single digit decline in
sales. Saks also reported that its New York flagship store was
recording better sales than the chain's average--another positive
sign for luxury retailers because it is an indication of a revived
tourist trade in New York City, an important source of revenue for
many high-end sellers.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, luxury seller Neiman Marcus Group Inc. also reported a
2.4% gain.</TE>
<TE>   "The luxury retailers have not lost their customer; what's
happened is that their core customers have been buying less--buying
one rather than two cashmere sweaters at $400 a pop," said Stacy
Turnof, an analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York. "Now it's a matter
of customers increasing their transactions."</TE>
<TE>   Nordstrom Inc., which on Wednesday reported an overall sales loss
of 1.1%, said that high-end designer goods were one of its better
categories, beating out more moderate items.</TE>
<TE>   An increase in sales of men's clothing, Slater said, comes as men
are replenishing their wardrobes after a roughly two-year period when
many bought little, if any, clothing. Slater noted growth in men's
business at Gap Inc.'s Banana Republic, American Eagle Outfitters
Inc. and Men's Express, a division of Limited Inc. that used to be
called Structure.</TE>
<TE>   Sales comparisons for March benefited in part from what is known
as the "Easter shift"--a calendar quirk that is likely to negatively
impact April same-store sales numbers.</TE>
<TE>   March sales this year benefit from the early Easter, when holiday
promotions tend to boost sales. Same-store sales numbers for March
also may appear bigger than they would otherwise because the figures
are compared with those from the same month a year ago, when Easter
fell in April.</TE>
<TE>   Same-store sales, or sales from stores open at least a year, are
considered an important measure of a company's overall health because
the figure excludes new and closed stores.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many analysts noted that a cold snap in the Midwest was a
drag on sales, which otherwise might have been even stronger.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, retail sales gained 6.2% in March when compared with a
year ago, according to Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York. The
March gain is the strongest since April 2000, according to that
tally.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman Sachs said its index of retail sales gained 5.6%.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, discount stores led the sector, with Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. reporting a 9.5% gain in same-store sales as compared with a
year ago, Target Corp. reporting a 9.4% comparable-store gain in its
discount stores and Costco Wholesale Corp. posting a 7% rise in
stores open at least a year. Kohl's Corp. reported a 9.1% gain.</TE>
<TE>   Department stores, meanwhile, mostly suffered, with May Department
Stores Co. posting a 6.9% sales decline, Target's Mervyn's California
reporting a 2% decline and its Marshall Fields stores posting a 6.7%
sales loss. Federated Department Stores Inc., which posted a 2% sales
decline, still came in better than expected.</TE>
<TE>   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. on Wednesday reported a 4.7% sales decline.</TE>
<TE>   And while luxury sellers have fared better, especially compared
with some of the laggards in the retail sector, analysts have said a
full-scale turnaround for high-end merchandise is likely to be
gradual.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like Groundhog Day--the wealthier people are raising
their heads out of the hole after hunkering down for a while," said
C. Britt Beemer, chairman of the Charleston, S.C.-based America's
Research Group.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't widespread by any means, but even my car dealer clients
say that more and more shoppers are coming in and looking at the
luxury cars," Beemer said.</TE>

<HD>British American Tobacco Admits Destroying Files; Cancer
Victim Wins Damages</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A unit of giant British American Tobacco has admitted destroying
thousands of internal documents, leading an Australian court to award
damages to a lung cancer victim on grounds she was prevented from
getting a fair trial.</LD>
<LD>   The verdict Thursday, involving the biggest case of document
destruction acknowledged by a tobacco company, is likely to trigger a
surge in smoker lawsuits in Australia, along with deeper scrutiny of
cigarette makers' document retention policies worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   The jury in Melbourne awarded $374,000 to Rolah Ann McCabe, 51,
who is gravely ill with lung cancer, after Justice Geoffrey Eames
barred British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd. from offering
a defense to McCabe's claims. In a 133-page ruling, Eames said he was
entering the default judgment against British American because it had
improperly destroyed about 30,000 documents in 1998, along with "an
untold number" in previous years.</LD>
<TE>   Although modest by U.S. standards, the damage award was the first
in Australia in a smoker injury case and one of the first outside the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Tradigo, a British American spokeswoman, said the destruction
of documents was permitted under the firm's record retention policy.
She said the company will appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The tobacco industry's legal woes are due almost entirely to
disclosure of incriminating papers--beginning with the theft and
leaking of documents from a law firm for Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco
Corp., British American's U.S. subsidiary, in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the industry documents show that tobacco executives knew
about the hazards of smoking as long as 40 years ago, but disputed
the evidence for decades.</TE>
<TE>   The Australian case focused on the destruction of CD-ROMs
containing research studies, reports, memos and other documents.
After lawyers for McCabe, who were aware of the database, repeatedly
tried to obtain it, defense attorneys were forced to admit that the
documents had been destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   It's normal for firms to have record retention policies that allow
the elimination of records as a housekeeping measure. But it's
improper to dispose of records that might be sought in litigation
that is pending or anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents, British American's Australian unit
crafted its records policy in 1985--at the same time company lawyers
in England and the U.S. were grappling with how to keep documents
away from plaintiffs. In what critics say were euphemisms, a 1986
memo by top British American lawyers urged a "spring clean" of "loose
papers."</TE>
<TE>   Through much of the 1990s, a "hold order" was placed on further
document destruction because of lawsuits pending against the company.
But according to the judge, the company began destroying documents in
1998 "as a matter of urgency" during a brief time when no suits were
pending. According to the rationale explained by company lawyers,
there was no pending litigation, nor were additional suits expected.</TE>
<TE>   But British American knew better, Eames declared.</TE>
<TE>   "There has never been a period when it did not have legal advisors
engaged on legal work connected with the defense of actual or
potential litigation," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only does that continuous activity emphasize the absurdity of
claims that the company ... did not anticipate further litigation,"
he said. "It also reflects the very substantial extent to which it
was lawyers who drove the company's strategy with respect to ...
document destruction."</TE>

<HD>You Can't Set the Peace Table Without Arafat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAWAZ A. GERGES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While President Bush finally has laid out clear markers for all
parties in the Middle East crisis, his pronounced disregard for
Yasser Arafat could cripple the efforts of Secretary of State Colin
Powell to reach a cease-fire and start a substantive political
dialogue.</LD>
<LD>   The combination of the president's ambiguous signals about
Arafat's eligibility to represent the Palestinians, his open distrust
of Arafat and his hope that other Palestinian leaders will step up
and negotiate with the U.S. is a recipe for failure.</LD>
<LD>   Pro-U.S. Arab leaders have impressed on Powell the need not to
discredit Arafat before his people and have urged Powell to not seek
other political figures with whom to build ties.</LD>
<TE>   The pulse of the Palestinian street and the internal balance of
power indicate that no credible Palestinian would dare to step
forward and offer an alternative vision to that of Arafat's, let
alone deal directly with the Israelis and Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Time is running out for constructive engagement and decisive
action.</TE>
<TE>   The most urgent task is to stop the bloodshed and break the
current deadlock.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his shortcomings, Arafat remains the most equipped
Palestinian leader to enforce a cease-fire, negotiate a viable
settlement with Israel and sell that agreement to skeptics and
critics. Far from rendering him irrelevant, Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon's attack on him and his people has resurrected Arafat's
sagging leadership at home and in the Arab world and made him the
indisputable symbol of Palestinian national resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Notwithstanding the poor quality of his leadership at home, Arafat
is seen by most Palestinians as their legitimate representative and
the symbol of their national aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   By design and default, Arafat embodies the Palestinians' ceaseless
quest for nationhood, a homeland and freedom.</TE>
<TE>   While many Israelis view Arafat as the enemy and want him expelled
or killed, such a move would deepen the Palestinians' sense of
victimization and humiliation, thus undermining the prospects for
reconciliation and coexistence between the two peoples.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Sharon ultimately succeeds in getting rid of Arafat, it is
doubtful that new Palestinian leadership would be more tractable or
inclined to stop the armed intifada or make further concessions for
peace.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, there is no potential leader waiting in the wings. Under
Arafat's rule, the security apparatus--particularly the
intelligence-gathering unit--is deeply entrenched; any future
succession will revolve around three or four senior security chiefs
and a few civilian members of Arafat's inner circle. None has an
independent power base with which to challenge Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Discrediting or ousting Arafat likely would unleash political
upheaval among the Palestinians and lead to an intensification of
suicide bombings on an even wider scale.</TE>
<TE>   Given the absence of entrenched and effective institutions,
Arafat's dismissal, coupled with the destruction of his governing
Palestinian Authority, would further weaken the only centralized
power that possesses the means to maintain law and order.</TE>
<TE>   Neutralizing Arafat would intensify, not arrest, the armed
struggle. Far from advancing the cause of peace, the Bush
administration's effort to sideline and bypass Arafat will backfire
and undermine Powell's current mission and the administration's
promising new initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the Muslim lands, die-hard, sworn enemies of Arafat
have heaped praise on him for refusing to buckle under pressure.</TE>
<TE>   More than ever, he is indispensable to reaching a peace agreement
with the Jewish state and making it stick.</TE>
<TE>   No one else has the political weight to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike previous junctures, it is in Arafat's and the Palestinians'
interests to respond positively to the new U.S. political initiative.
Palestinian militants would think twice before challenging a
comprehensive, legitimate settlement signed by Arafat, lest they
antagonize public opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Now is the time for the United States to actively engage the
Palestinian leadership.</TE>

<HD>Does the World Prefer It When Jews Are Victims?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>YOSSI KLEIN HALEVI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>We Israelis watch the growing outrage against us and wonder whether
the world has gone mad. How is it possible, we ask each other, that
after suffering an unprecedented terrorist campaign, we're portrayed
as bullies for finally trying to uproot the threat? Why does so much
of the world seem to get indignant not when Israelis are being
massacred and turned into a nation of terrorized shut-ins but when we
hit back?</LD>
<LD>   Tragically, the anti-terrorist offensive has caused great
suffering and dislocation among innocent Palestinians. Any war that
is televised produces horrific images. But the crucial moral
difference between the Israeli government and Yasser Arafat's regime
is that Israel doesn't deliberately target civilians. In fact, rather
than use Israel's mighty air power to attack terrorist enclaves, the
army has sent infantry into the narrow alleyways of West Bank towns.</LD>
<LD>   There is no fully surgical way to fight the war of survival that
has been forced on Israel. Indeed, no national movement has ever
fought a dirtier and less justified war than the Palestinians, who
could have ended the occupation had they accepted President Clinton's
plan and who have since violated every civilized norm--from hiding
gunmen behind priests in a holy place to smuggling suicide bombers in
ambulances.</LD>
<TE>   There is no solution to be had with Arafat, who responded to
Israel's unprecedented offer to share sovereignty over its capital
with 18 months of terrorism, including the murder of entire families.
Does the international community really expect us to negotiate a deal
with Arafat that will bring him and his terrorist militias into
Jerusalem?</TE>
<TE>   For years my press colleagues have debated whether Arafat can
control the violence. Now we know that the very question was absurd.
The last few weeks have produced two smoking guns directly linking
Arafat to terrorism. Yet most of the media chose to bury those
stories.</TE>
<TE>   The first was the Israeli army's discovery of documents in
Arafat's Ramallah compound that authorize transfer of funds from the
Palestinian Authority to terrorists, who planned the machine-gun
attack on a bat-mitzvah party in the northern town of Hadera in
January. The authorizations were personally signed by Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   That revelation was coupled with an interview with Arafat on Al
Jazeera TV, in which the Palestinian leader invoked the suicide
bomber who murdered 27 Israelis at a March 27 Passover Seder. "Oh
God," said Arafat, "give me martyrdom like this." Here was the
"legitimate leader of the Palestinian people," as the world's
statesmen refer to him, affirming a mass murderer as his role model.</TE>
<TE>   But rather than earn him instant membership in the Bin Laden club
of pariahs, Arafat's self-incrimination went virtually unnoticed.
Instead, three of the five members of the Nobel Peace Prize committee
say they now regret having awarded the prize to Israeli Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres. Apparently, they have no regrets about giving
it to Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has sarcastically asked whether
the whole world can be wrong and only Israel right. The same question
could have been asked in 1981, when Israel bombed the Iraqi nuclear
reactor at Osirak. Then, too, the "whole world" condemned Israel as
an outlaw. But who today isn't quietly grateful to Israel for having
prevented Saddam Hussein from acquiring the bomb?</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army is performing a similar service for humanity
today by establishing the principle that terrorism won't be indulged.
Perhaps one day that too will be acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, almost everyone I know here is near despair. Getting
through the day without yielding to hysteria or rage is a constant
act of will. Now we're not just reeling from terrorism but
international isolation, judged by a standard that no other nation
would be held to in our place.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, perhaps, the diplomatic siege against the Jewish
state is being accompanied in Europe by the worst outbreak of violent
anti-Semitism since the Holocaust, with Jews being beaten in Berlin
and synagogues burned in France.</TE>
<TE>   Most Israelis have given up on the Europeans, who are seen here as
incurable appeasers. But don't we have the right to expect more of
Americans, especially at this fateful time?</TE>

<LD>The president, never shy about playing the increasingly dogeared
national security card for political gain, is now using the growing
crisis in the Middle East to justify his renewed call for drilling in
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</LD>
<LD>   Adding fuel to the fire was Saddam Hussein's decision to cut off
Iraqi oil exports for up to 30 days--an economic scud missile that
prompted the president to declare that the oil from ANWR "is needed
more than ever."</LD>
<LD>   For his part, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said he planned to
respond to this crisis by meeting with officials of the American
Automobile Assn. to talk about ways drivers might cut down on oil
consumption--things like not leaving the engine of your SUV idling
while waiting to pick up your Big Mac in the drive-thru lane. I can
already hear the new Happy Meal jingle: "Hold the pickles, hold the
lettuce, Saddam's threats don't upset us."</LD>
<TE>   Helpful hints like that are all well and good, but if Abraham
really wants to make America less vulnerable to the oily schemes of
someone like Hussein, he should put his AAA plans in neutral and
shift into high gear on something that we all know will work: raising
mileage standards.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of supporting last month's modest effort by Sens. John
Kerry (D-Mass.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) to gradually increase fuel
standards over the next 13 years, the White House helped kill the
plan, which would have saved about 2.5 billion barrels of oil a day,
roughly the amount we currently import from the Middle East.
Apparently, the first casualties of this new crisis have been the
administration's short-term memory and truth-telling skills.</TE>
<TE>   So much for leading a charge to help us thumb our noses at Persian
Gulf potentates.</TE>
<TE>   The White House would much rather pursue its obsession with
drilling in ANWR--a fixation that reached new heights this week with
the Great Caribou Study Flip-Flop, a brazen example of manipulation
of the media and political damage control.</TE>
<TE>   After the U.S. Geological Survey, a fact-finding agency within the
Interior Department, released a report maintaining that drilling in
ANWR would pose a serious hazard to wildlife, a dismayed Interior
Secretary Gale Norton prodded the scientists to reevaluate their
conclusions and report back within 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   The initial USGS study had been 12 years in the making. But
Norton-quality science is obviously much speedier--the amended
analysis was delivered in seven days, just in time for this week's
Senate debate on the energy bill. And, in two pages as opposed to the
original's 78, the revised report conveniently concluded that Bush's
drilling proposal would have little or no impact on wildlife,
particularly the thousands of Porcupine caribou that populate the
Arctic refuge.</TE>
<TE>   But the highly expedient revision was never about the actual
effect of drilling on caribou calving rates. It was all about
headlines--and on that front the White House got exactly what it
wanted. One was "Limited Arctic Drilling Won't Harm Caribou,
Scientists Say" after the dubious do-over. Just what the spin doctor
ordered.</TE>
<TE>   If the president is truly sincere about freeing us from our
dependence on foreign oil, he would forget about the negligible
amounts of oil in ANWR and get serious about conservation and the
promotion of alternative sources of energy.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, all you really need to know about where the administration
stands on the subject can be found in documents recently unearthed by
a court order. It turns out the White House dipped into the
Department of Energy's already meager funds for renewables and energy
conservation--budgets Team Bush plans to slash by half--to come up
with more than $135,000 for the printing of 10,000 copies of its
industry-friendly energy plan.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer called Hussein's crude ploy "a
reminder about the need for America to have an energy policy that is
independent of such threats."</TE>
<TE>   But what we need even more urgently is an energy policy
independent of the wishes, goals and manipulations of the oil
industry and its slick friends in the White House.</TE>

<HD>There's Nothing 'Anti-Life' About Medical Cloning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CONNIE MACK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Political advertising on "therapeutic cloning" already has started,
and it appears the U.S. Senate debate on this issue is going to be
clouded by emotional appeals rather than sound science.</LD>
<LD>   That's a shame because therapeutic cloning, which scientists call
"somatic cell nuclear transfer," is vitally important and complex. It
should be decided by carefully weighing the facts and the moral
choices.</LD>
<LD>   As a cancer survivor and one who is pro-life, I have struggled
with the issue and am convinced that Congress should not ban this
important research.</LD>
<TE>   Most Americans agree that attempting to produce children by
cloning human embryos is wrong. Yet it is essential to keep in mind
the critical differences between cloning human beings and somatic
cell transfers.</TE>
<TE>   Cell transfers involve removing the nucleus of a donated egg cell
and replacing it with the material from the nucleus of a somatic
cell--such as a skin cell--from the patient being treated. Then the
cell is stimulated to begin dividing.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting collection of dividing cells never leaves the lab.
It is never transplanted into a womb, and sperm never fertilizes it.</TE>
<TE>   Once the cells begin dividing, stem cells can be derived about six
days later, just as they can be extracted from embryos created
through in vitro fertilization. When combined with stem cell
research, somatic cell transfers could be used to develop innovative
treatments that allow cells to function again and restore hope to
millions of families.</TE>
<TE>   The added benefit of somatic cell research is that the stem cells
produced would not be rejected when transplanted back into the
patient who donated the somatic cells.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the technology would allow a patient's own cells
to treat or cure that patient's disease.</TE>
<TE>   Although some believe that stem cell research could proceed
without somatic cell transfers, the overwhelming majority of
scientists believe somatic cell transfers are essential in turning
research into treatments that actually help patients.</TE>
<TE>   The National Institutes of Health recently released a report that
makes the link between somatic cell transfers and stem cell research,
noting the benefits in countering transplant rejection. The
prestigious National Academy of Sciences has concluded that
reproductive cloning is unsafe but that somatic cell transfers have
"considerable potential" and should be permitted.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists are joined by a wide range of patient advocacy groups
that regard this research as a matter of life and death. They agree
that reproductive cloning should be illegal but somatic cell research
must move forward.</TE>
<TE>   When listening to what some opponents say, I'm reminded that we've
been down this road before. Recombinant DNA is one of the most
important recent advances in medical research.</TE>
<TE>   Yet when the technology was developed in the 1970s, it was
bitterly opposed by some of the same people who today oppose somatic
cell transfers.</TE>
<TE>   They even used the same images now being invoked--Frankenstein's
monster, the hatcheries of "Brave New World" and eugenics. They
proposed banning the research.</TE>
<TE>   Recombinant DNA research is responsible for human insulin for
diabetes; Herceptin for patients with breast cancer; Epogen for
patients with kidney disease; Enbrel to help patients with rheumatoid
arthritis; and Pulmozyme, which has prevented childhood deaths from
cystic fibrosis.</TE>
<TE>   A victory by the opponents of controversial research 30 years ago
would have been anti-life: It would have meant many more deaths and
untold human suffering.</TE>
<TE>   I've lived the terrible ordeal of watching a loved one die from a
disease without a cure. I don't want people to go through the same
thing a decade from now because we banned this latest research. When
the Senate votes on the issue, it should support this life-saving
effort.</TE>

<LD>The Alameda Corridor, a 20-mile-long rail expressway designed to
speed cargo from the ports at Long Beach and San Pedro to the
transcontinental rail yards south of downtown Los Angeles, opens
today to fanfare from politicians--and a big shrug from most Southern
Californians. The government agency that built the thing should take
that shrug as a compliment.</LD>
<LD>   The projects that the public tends to know best are those that are
synonymous with trouble. After streets collapsed, deadlines slipped
and budgets soared during construction of Los Angeles' Metro Red
Line, fed-up voters passed an initiative that effectively bans any
more subways.</LD>
<TE>   The Alameda Corridor, named for the street it parallels, was not
problem-free. Machines the size of dinosaurs dug a trench 30 feet
deep so that the railway could run below ground level along half its
route. Nearby residents and businesses had to endure noise, dust,
congestion and, in some cases, lost customers. But the authority
established by the ports and the cities to build the railway still
managed to bring in this $2.4-billion project on time and under
budget. Repaved streets and newly planted trees helped ease the pain
of disruption, as did training local residents for construction jobs.
As for future payoff, the 30 bridges that span the trench eliminate
long waits at train crossings. The new high-speed railway will
largely replace the slow-moving freight trains that snarled streets
on four routes.</TE>
<TE>   The payoff for the region overall is even greater. The Los Angeles
and Long Beach ports, the nation's two busiest, handled $200 billion
in cargo in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to take the smooth delivery of everything from shoes to
computers for granted, as well as the one in 15 jobs in the
five-county region that is directly connected to international trade.
But there are good reasons not to.</TE>
<TE>   The Alameda Corridor is a reminder that we need to look at the
movement of freight as well as people if we want to solve our
notorious traffic congestion--and to look at ways other than freeways
to move both.</TE>
<TE>   It is also an example of what can be accomplished when a
government creates an agency to carry out a single mission, without
distractions or conflicts. The Alameda Corridor Transportation
Authority is a model that could apply to any major project, be it
building a subway or 85 desperately needed new schools.</TE>

<LD>Yasser Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organization cannot be
legislated out of existence, as some members of Congress seem to be
hoping. The congressional efforts, aside from being futile, could
significantly harm U.S. efforts to end the bloodshed in the Mideast.</LD>
<LD>   It's one thing to issue an expression of support for Israel, as in
a resolution being circulated by Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), the
ranking Democrat on the House International Relations Committee and a
Holocaust survivor. But Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Mitch
McConnell (R-Ky.) contemplate something reckless. Feinstein indicates
that if Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's current mission fails
(and who and what defines failure?), she will introduce joint
legislation with McConnell that legally and financially targets
Arafat and the PLO.</LD>
<LD>   Last fall, Feinstein and McConnell announced they would offer an
amendment to the foreign aid appropriations bill that would have
required the president to impose sanctions on the PLO and its
governing arm, the Palestinian Authority, if it did not repudiate
violence and terrorism. Powell talked them out of it, but the measure
didn't really die.</LD>
<TE>   Now, with the region aflame, the senators are working on a new
version that would, according to published reports, name the PLO a
terrorist organization, end all U.S. aid that is not strictly
humanitarian and deny U.S. visas to Palestinian officials, including
Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein and McConnell are playing to natural U.S. sympathies and
bonds with Israel. But this is not the moment for political
gesturing. Powell, who is trying against the odds to broker a truce,
would be undermined by even proposed legislation that further deepens
Arab mistrust of U.S. intentions. If the legislation omits
presidential authority to override the sanctions, as its previous
version did, President Bush's hands would be tied.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, the Palestinians haven't lived up to the promises they
made in the 1993 Oslo agreement, and no one should attempt to excuse
Arafat's encouragement of suicide bombings. But treating the PLO as
the outright enemy of the United States would only spur more
bloodshed and dim Powell's chances.</TE>

<HD>Police Union's Heavy Hand</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles police union is like an overly critical partner who
never has anything good to say. The Police Protective League doesn't
like Chief Bernard C. Parks. It wants a divorce; Mayor James K. Hahn
delivers. The union demands a three-day workweek of 12-hour days; the
mayor makes sure some officers get it, over the opposition of the
chief and common sense. So far during Hahn's mayoral tenure what the
police union wants, it gets.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn must not allow the league to pick the next police chief or
run the Los Angeles Police Department. He also shouldn't allow the
union to stand in the way of reform.</LD>
<LD>   LAPD discipline may be the next big test. The union criticizes the
system that Parks put into place as excessively focused on minor
infractions, too tough on patrol officers and too easy on
higher-ranking officers or well-connected cops. But the next chief
can't allow a return to the racism, rampant rudeness, lax discipline
and kid-glove punishment documented a decade ago by the Christopher
Commission during a time when cops could--in some cases, perhaps
literally--get away with murder.</LD>
<TE>   Hahn wants full implementation of the consent decree that, as city
attorney, he negotiated with the U.S. Justice Department to avoid a
federal civil rights lawsuit against the department. The union isn't
likely to take kindly to that. But Hahn can't let it dictate policy
in exchange for political support.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Hahn--and every sensible resident of Los Angeles--wants
the department, which is down more than 1,000 officers, to operate at
full strength. Is the union responding to this crisis by aggressively
recruiting in television advertisements as it should? Or is it still
petulantly helping the LAPD's finest find new jobs in other cities'
forces through job postings in its newsletter? Such pettiness only
further undermines the department's ever more dangerously slow
response time.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has said that the slowing response times, low morale, the
growing crime rate and the reluctance in embracing community policing
factored into his decision to oppose Chief Parks' reappointment.
While the league shares some of these concerns, its vehement
opposition to Parks was suspicious because he was the second black
police chief who became a target for the union. Unions are often at
war with the boss, but is that all that was going on in the Parks
battle? It's a question that hangs uncomfortably in the civic air.</TE>
<TE>   For the sake of the city, Hahn needs to show clearly now that his
true loyalty is not to the union but to public safety. The mayor must
demonstrate his independence from the Police Protective League.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Your coverage of Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard Parks' resolve to
seek another term in office despite official opposition (April 10)
presented a compelling portrait of a man of high character and
uncompromising integrity.</LD>
<LD>   In the face of controversy from all quarters, he undeniably has
the strength and courage to stand alone and work toward his vision of
better law enforcement. And that is what we hired him to do. The
ordeal of change is often painful, and it takes a remarkable
individual to make it happen. A more accommodating officer might not
achieve the goals we have in mind. Chief Parks is obviously our man,
and he is a proud reflection of the best our city has to offer. He
has earned our support and merits another term.</LD>

<TE>   The only winner in the decision of the Police Commission to deny
Parks another five-year term was the Police Protective League. The
citizens of Los Angeles were the clear losers. It has now been
undeniably demonstrated that the Police Protective League is in
control of the city. Mitzi Grasso and cabal are clearly calling the
shots in the mayor's office, the City Council and on the Police
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Why not just make her police chief? While we're at it, let's
anoint her as mayor, City Council and Police Commission too. She must
get tired pulling the strings of all those puppets. Give her a rest.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Roberson</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In responding to his ousting, Parks said the "process has become
much too politicized." This is a ridiculous statement. The selection
and reappointment of a chief of police was very political when he was
appointed five years ago and it continues to be. The political nature
of the position did not change during his term. Having served in the
LAPD's upper echelon during former Chief Willie Williams' tenure, he
should have known what to expect.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the Daryl Gates era, the voters approved the current
five-year terms for the chief of police. When that happened it closed
the door to Civil Service entitlements and opened the door for these
types of power shifts. We saw it five years ago and we're seeing it
now. So, here we are again, dragging the city through the mud and
dividing its citizens. Does the saying "Be careful what you ask for"
sound familiar? See you in five years. I'm disgusted.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Comorre</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chief Parks, it is inappropriate and counterproductive for any
non-elected government official to attempt to force his employer to
retain him when he is no longer wanted. The mayor and the Police
Commission have stated publicly that they want someone else for this
job. Don't become another Gates. Do the right thing for yourself and
for Los Angeles and step aside gracefully.</TE>

<LD>Re "Mexico Leaves Castro's Cuba Behind," Commentary, April 9: Latin
America deserves a credible and active regional leader; the United
States could use a reliable partner in the region's affairs. That's
why Mexico's brave and calculated move to redefine its relationship
with Cuba deserves greater applause and support.</LD>
<LD>   Mexico's abandonment of its pro-Cuba stance marks our southern
neighbor's often unappreciated entry into modern democratic politics.
It wasn't too long ago that Mexico, like Cuba, was an oddity in Latin
America. As a nation ruled by an authoritarian party, Mexico's
politicos regularly paid tribute to Cuba to prevent international
scrutiny of shared domestic abuses: human rights violations, rigged
elections, corruption.</LD>
<LD>   Today, Mexico increasingly ties its political future to
international considerations. And as it does, its capacity to lead in
the region expands.</LD>

<HD>Mideast: Apply Pressure to Stop the Violence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In your April 9 editorial, you say that "Arab nations should pressure
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat to stop the Palestinian
violence." Of course they should. But President Bush hasn't succeeded
in doing so despite his many statements urging Arafat to stop the
terrorists' attacks and to turn over those responsible for the
assassination of an Israeli Cabinet member to Israeli authorities.
What signs have you read to indicate that the Arab nations will
pressure Arafat? Has there been any good-faith action on Arafat's
part? Show it to me, please. Then I will write Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon, posthaste, condemning him for not responding in good faith.</LD>
<LD>   Bush had it right before his speech on April 4. He should not have
sent Secretary of State Colin Powell to the Middle East on a
fruitless mission. He should have stayed the course with Sharon and
encouraged him to clean out the terrorists--just as we have attempted
to do in Afghanistan. Afterward, negotiations can take place.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arafat should leave his bunker and, like Gandhi before him, he
should march singly, followed no doubt by many, to Jerusalem. As
Gandhi made salt from the sea, Arafat needs to make clear the
legitimacy for debate of the right of return for Palestinians.
Americans don't understand that he is holding out for the right of
his people who lost their homes and land; that the term "refugees"
has meaning.</TE>
<TE>   He is willing to be a martyr, so the time is right for him to get
in the gun sights of the Israeli tanks and let them either take their
best shot or yield. Let Powell catch up with him in Jerusalem, the
Palestinian capital.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Let us speak truth to power: The so-called generous offer of a
"Palestinian state" that Arafat refused was either a cruel joke or a
trap. Look at the map of the proposed territories: none were
contiguous; a network of Israeli roads crisscrossed the Palestinian
lands, making the inhabitants prisoners of a continuous virtual
occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Let us also remember how the present intifada started: Sharon
"visited" the Palestinians' sacred site with armed soldiers. The
Palestinians' first violence, stones thrown at the occupier, was met
with bullets, resulting in deaths. Who has suffered most?</TE>

<TE>   Robert Scheer may be an expert in many areas, and he is certainly
entitled to his opinion about Sharon, Arafat or the dynamics of the
Arab-Israeli conflict (Commentary, April 9).</TE>
<TE>   What he clearly lacks is better insight into the deep and, yes,
all-consuming anti-Semitism that dominates the hearts and minds of
the majority of Muslims in the world. His assertion "What irony that
many Jews now comfortably vacation in Germany but insist that Arab
anti-Semitism is an immutable aspect of Muslim culture" would be
poignant if it weren't so ill-informed.</TE>
<TE>   Take it from a Jew--not an Israeli--who was born and raised in a
Muslim nation. Anti-Semitism is indeed an immutable aspect of daily
life in Muslim--not just Arab--culture. It has been so for a thousand
years--long before the inception of the state of Israel or the
invention of tanks and other tools of modern warfare.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I hope that I am part of a silent majority of Jews worldwide who
are shocked and gravely disturbed by Israel's ongoing military
actions. The shameful and humiliating treatment and killing of
innocent Palestinians is just as disturbing as the ruthless murder of
innocent Israelis by suicide bombers. Both Arafat and Sharon should
be condemned for their egotistic, vicious policies fueling this
madness. Immediate withdrawal and an end to suicide bombings can only
begin the process that everyone wants: peace.</TE>

<HD>More Freeways Equal More Oil Dependency</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "The Pressure Is On to Play the Oil Card," Commentary, April 10
and "Will More Freeways Bring More Traffic?" April 10: It should be
increasingly clear by now that America's dependence on oil,
particularly foreign oil, is the Achilles' heel of our nation's
security. We have placed the fate of our economy in the hands of the
OPEC nations. Southern California's addiction to the automobile only
exacerbates the problem and creates not only gridlock here but also
has profound environmental and political consequences. As a nation,
we must begin to consider energy efficiency, particularly in
transportation, as a top priority of our new homeland security
agenda. Spending hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars on new
freeway construction only takes us farther down the wrong road.</LD>
<LD>   In terms of energy used per passenger-mile, a single person in an
SUV is about the most inefficient mode of transportation in human
history, while the most efficient is a person on a bicycle. Trains
might be a good compromise. It is high time to devote a large portion
of transportation funds and our new homeland security budget to the
creation of a system of high-speed rail, both for commuters and for
travel between cities. We will be helping the environment, relieving
gridlock and bolstering our security at the same time. Another good
feature of trains--they are difficult to hijack.</LD>

<LD>In "4 Local Agencies Claim DWP Overcharges of $200 Million" (April
2), the DWP's Chief Operating Officer Frank Salas claims that "all
our rates are fair and equitable . . . we are not overcharging
anybody." Amazing. My home in the Hollywood Hills was destroyed on
June 24, 2001, by a 99-year-old, broken DWP water main. It sent
thousands of gallons of water and sewage pouring through my home,
rendering it unlivable within an hour. I moved out that day and have
not yet been able to return due to the extent of the damage. The
power was shut off the day of the flood. Yet the DWP continues to
send me regular bills, and they are within $10 of what I was paying
for service when I was living there.</LD>
<LD>   When I called to inquire about this suspicious situation, I was
told that a field representative would conduct an investigation. Ten
days later, I received a form letter explaining that my bill was
correct and that water and electrical usage vary during different
seasons of the year. The audacity of the DWP to bill me regularly for
service is adding insult to injury. "Fair and equitable"?</LD>
<LD>   Shame on the Department of Water and Power.</LD>

<LD>Christa M. Gaehde, 79, a leading American expert on the conservation
of prints and drawings, died April 3 in Arlington, Mass., after being
hit by a car, according to her husband, Joachim Gaehde.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Dresden, Germany, she studied chemistry at the University
of Innsbruck in Austria. Gaehde and her husband moved to the United
States in 1949.</LD>
<LD>   Gaehde acquired an encyclopedic knowledge of old papers and inks,
and devised many new ways of removing marks and stains without
damaging the stability of the basic materials. She also used old
paper to patch and repair torn and damaged artworks.</LD>
<TE>   Jonathan Rendell, an old print expert at Christie's in New York
City, called her a "miracle worker who inspired a whole movement."</TE>
<TE>   A freelance specialist, Gaehde worked for many American museums,
including the Guggenheim and the Museum of Modern Art in New York,
and the Library of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   In 1965, she published "A Guide to the Collecting and Care of
Original Prints," written with Carl Zigrosser.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Harmsen, 89, who with his wife started the Jolly Rancher Candy
Co., died of prostate cancer Wednesday in Wheat Ridge, Colo.</LD>
<LD>   Jolly Ranchers, the hard candies in flavors such as cinnamon and
watermelon that are sold around the world, were created by Harmsen
and his wife, Dorothy, on the family farm in Golden, Colo.</LD>
<LD>   Harmsen was a retired Continental Airlines pilot when he opened an
ice cream shop in Golden in 1949 and concocted the candy to keep
money coming in during the winter months.</LD>
<TE>   The candy factory, housed in a deep-red barn, became a popular
tourist attraction, drawing 2 million visitors a year.</TE>
<TE>   The company was sold to Beatrice Foods Co. in 1967, and Harmsen
stayed on as president until 1977.</TE>
<TE>   The company is now owned by Hershey Foods Corp., which bought it

<HD>Ivy Olson, 60; Charity Founder Inspired Pilot of 'Touched
by an Angel'</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ivy Olson, 60, the founder of a Hawaii charity whose story inspired
the pilot of the television series "Touched by an Angel," died of
intestinal cancer Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   In 1989, Olson founded Angel Network Charities, which became a
$700,000-a-year nonprofit serving more than 100 homeless families in
Hawaii. The organization helps its clients gain the means to live
independently through housing, health care, transportation and job
training assistance.</LD>
<LD>   Olson was chosen as one of President George H.W. Bush's "Thousand
Points of Light" in 1992.</LD>
<TE>   She launched the charity after an experience many years ago when
she was a single divorced mother of two. She had taken her sons to a
park for a Thanksgiving dinner of three hot dogs, but they were still
hungry. As they approached their apartment, a woman emerged saying,
"Oh, honey? I've been waiting for you.'" The woman invited them in
for a generous meal and sent them home with leftovers.</TE>
<TE>   When Olson tried to return the plastic containers that had held
the leftovers, she found an empty apartment. The manager told her no
one had lived there in months. Olson decided that she had been helped
by an angel.</TE>
<TE>   Writers from "Touched by an Angel" wrote her story into the pilot
of the CBS series in 1994.</TE>

<HD>Lady Sala Shabazz, 50; Created Black History Books for Kids</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lady Sala S. Shabazz, who created children's books and founded the
mobile miniature International Black Inventions Museum to teach
youngsters about black history, has died. She was 50.</LD>
<LD>   Shabazz died March 28 of liver and kidney failure at Century City
Hospital, said a friend, Dr. Patricia E. Bath.</LD>
<LD>   Born Valerie Robinson in Harlem, Shabazz grew up reading--and
unhappy with the way books depicted African Americans.</LD>
<TE>   She moved to Los Angeles and became a legal secretary, but was
determined to do something to teach blacks about their own past
achievements.</TE>
<TE>   In 1977, the young woman officially changed her name to Lady Sala
(which means "gentle and caring" in Swahili) Shabazz (meaning "from
the people of the tribe who preserve").</TE>
<TE>   "Now that my name has special meaning," she once told an
interviewer, "I think I have to live up to it."</TE>
<TE>   Shabazz established an independent book publishing company, Sala
Enterprises, and began designing and illustrating educational
coloring books for children. "The Kwanzaa Coloring Book," "The Cinco
de Mayo Coloring Book," "Flags of the African People," "Kwanzaa--An
African Celebration" and "The Best of Little Known Black History
Facts" rolled off her presses.</TE>
<TE>   The little fact book has been featured during Black History Month
in recent years on the nationally syndicated Tom Joyner radio show.
McDonald's Corp. also financed publication of parts of the book in a
nationally distributed brochure.</TE>
<TE>   About 15 years ago, Shabazz also decided to focus on the historic
scientific and consumer inventions by blacks over the past two
centuries. Billing her newest creation the International Black
Inventions Museum, she started with a handful of objects, which she
displayed for a Yorba Linda children's group.</TE>
<TE>   After receiving a sizable donation from rap star Ice Cube in 1992,
Shabazz began building her collection, adding scale models of
inventions, biographical sketches of inventors and copies of patent
documents verified with the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   She took the show on the road, and by the time of her death had
displayed selections from her 3,000 items more than 1,000 times
before 12 million people in some 180 cities, 38 states and a few
other countries. She also established a permanent display in Ghana.</TE>
<TE>   Shabazz's itinerant museum, particularly popular during Black
History Month each February, helped teach children about the blacks
who invented such familiar items as the rotary lawnmower, traffic
signal, refrigerator, fire extinguisher, roller coaster and gas mask.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt there was a need to create a display that would raise the
self-esteem of young black children," Shabazz told the Allentown,
Pa., Morning Call last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Making the museum a mobile traveling exhibition makes it more
available to more people," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She said several children who saw the exhibit told her it inspired
them to become inventors.</TE>
<TE>   No information was available on survivors.</TE>
<TE>   Shabazz will be honored May 4 in a program at the Tom Bradley
International Center on the UCLA campus.</TE>

<HD>Pat Flaherty, 76; Southland Native Won '56 Indy 500</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pat Flaherty, who won the 1956 Indianapolis 500 wearing slacks, a
T-shirt and a helmet emblazoned with a green shamrock, died Tuesday
at his home in Oxnard after several years battling emphysema. He was
76.</LD>
<LD>   Flaherty, a colorful redhead, defied all racing superstitions when
he showed up with green on his helmet. At that time, anything green
was considered likely to bring the worst kind of luck.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Glendale, Flaherty spent most of his adult life in
Chicago before returning to Southern California in October with his
wife, Marilyn, to be near their children.</LD>
<TE>   In the accident-marred race May 30, 1956, Flaherty drove to
victory in a pink and white car built by his longtime friend A.J.
Watson, leading in 127 of the 200 laps. The car, owned by John Zink,
was the first of the famous "Watson roadsters." It was built for Bob
Sweikert, who won the race the year before, but Flaherty got the ride
when Sweikert quit the team over a contract dispute. In qualifying,
Flaherty set records of 146.056 mph for one lap and 145.590 mph for
four laps.</TE>
<TE>   Indy 500 historian Donald Davidson recalls the run:</TE>
<TE>   "Flaherty thrilled the crowds with some of the most spectacular
driving ever seen at the old Speedway. He barreled into the turns so
hard that the front left wheel would lift right off the ground as if
it were a midget on quarter-mile track. He would slide out of the
turn at a fantastic angle with the wheel still dangling in the air,
then tromp back on the throttle upon entering the stretch and charge
for the next turn in order to perform the feat again."</TE>
<TE>   Flaherty averaged 128.59 mph for the 500-mile race. Shortly after
he crossed the finish line, the throttle linkage broke.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, he won a 100-mile race in Milwaukee and was
leading the U.S. Auto Club national championship points race when he
suffered a serious arm injury on a dirt track in Springfield, Ill. He
was sidelined for two years from the injury.</TE>
<TE>   When Flaherty made his comeback, on Aug. 21, 1958, in a USAC stock
car race in Milwaukee, he scored an emotional win. After that, he
raced only occasionally and made his final championship start in 1963
at a 150-mile race in Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Once he ran his last race, he seldom went to races or old-timers'
gatherings. Speedway officials said they believed that his last visit
to the 500 was in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Flaherty appeared in six Indianapolis 500s, once as a relief
driver, between 1950 and 1959. He finished 10th in 1950 and 1955, hit
the wall while running fourth in 1953 and led for 11 laps in 1959
before spinning out while running fourth late in the race.</TE>
<TE>   Flaherty began his career in 1946 in Southern California, racing
against hot-rodders such as Troy Ruttman, Dick and Jim Rathmann, Jack
McGrath, Manny Ayulo, Don Freeland, Jimmy Davies and Andy Linden.</TE>
<TE>   In 1948, he moved to Chicago and became part of Andy Granatelli's
Hurricane Hot Rod Assn., racing mostly at Soldier Field. Granatelli
took Flaherty to Indy for the first time in 1949, but his qualifying
speed was not sufficient to make the race.</TE>
<TE>   Flaherty first attracted national attention in 1955 after his
10th-place finish at Indy, his third-place finish in the June
100-mile race in Milwaukee and his victory in a 250-mile race on the
same track in August.</TE>
<TE>   In 1956, in addition to winning in Indianapolis and Milwaukee in
an Indy car, he showed his versatility by winning a USAC sprint car
race in Williams Grove, Pa., and a stock car race in Hinsdale, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Besides his wife of 47 years, Flaherty is survived by sons James
of Fresno and John of La Crescenta; a daughter, Colleen of Oxnard;
and numerous nieces and nephews.</TE>
<TE>   Visitation is today at James A. Reardon Mortuary in Oxnard, with
burial Saturday at Santa Clara Catholic Cemetery in Oxnard. Memorial
donations may be made to the Livingstone Memorial Visiting Nurse
Assn., 1996 Eastman Ave., Suite 101, Ventura, CA 93003.</TE>

<HD>Girl, 12, Kept Out of School as Servant in Irvine, Police
Say</HD>
<DH>Crime: Man is arrested after the Egyptian child is found
living in his garage. His attorney says she was treated as family.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD and DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Irvine family living in an expensive gated community kept a
12-year-old Egyptian girl as a servant for 18 months, having her
sleep on a filthy mattress in the garage and requiring her to work
days as a maid instead of going to school, police said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities removed the girl from the home Tuesday and arrested
Abdelnaser Ibrahim on suspicion of child endangerment and infringing
upon the girl's liberty, both felonies. Police said the girl worked
as a maid for Ibrahim, his wife and their five children, cleaning
floors, hosing down patio furniture and serving meals.</LD>
<LD>   When detectives found her, she appeared in good health and did not
appear to be physically abused.</LD>
<TE>   The girl was living in a 12-by-8-foot converted area of the Irvine
home's garage, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Her bedroom contained a mattress on box springs and a floor lamp
that did not work.</TE>
<TE>   The room, which stank of urine, lacked ventilation and heating,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing is unacceptable," said Irvine Police Lt. Sam
Allevato.</TE>
<TE>   "She was in substandard living conditions while the rest of the
family enjoyed very nice surroundings."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors are reviewing whether to file criminal charges, said a
spokeswoman for the Orange County district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors are also reviewing the case for possible
civil-rights violations, said Thom Mrozek, a U.S. attorney's office
spokesman. The 41-year-old Ibrahim, who owns a steel export business
and a small hotel, posted $150,000 bond Wednesday and returned to his
home.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney, Allan Stokke, insisted that the girl was treated as
a family member and was expected only to do small chores about the
home. In return, she was given board, food and clothing.</TE>
<TE>   Stokke said Ibrahim regularly sends money to the girl's
impoverished parents, who have 10 other children and live in a small
Egyptian village. "Basically, Ibrahim felt sorry for her. But he also
felt she should help around the house," Stokke said. "She was very
well cared for, for a relatively small amount of work she had to do."</TE>
<TE>   But according to police accounts, the girl had few of the comforts
enjoyed by the rest of the Ibrahim household.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the girl began working for Ibrahim's family as a maid
in Egypt when she was 8. Eighteen months ago, she arrived in Irvine,
joining the family, which includes three girls, 11, 14 and 17; and
twin boys, 7.</TE>
<TE>   Although the boys were regularly seen whizzing around the
neighborhood on bicycles, neighbors said they rarely caught a glimpse
of the 12-year-old girl.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Ibrahim's children, the girl did not attend school and did
not speak English. Those neighbors who occasionally saw her told
authorities they saw her through windows hosing down patio furniture
or dusting inside the home.</TE>
<TE>   "Her main purpose was just to help around the house," Allevato
said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said they first heard about the girl when social
workers received an anonymous tip Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Teaming up with police, social workers and investigators went to
the family's $660,000 home in the exclusive Northpark section, which
is adorned with statuettes and paintings in ornate frames.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the garage, police said they found starkly different living
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   About a third of the garage had been converted without city
permission into the girl's bedroom, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Police acknowledged that the girl was not restrained from leaving
the house.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, her bedroom door could be locked only from the inside and
she could have left through the garage at any time.</TE>
<TE>   But police said that as a youngster who could not speak English,
she had little chance of leaving the family.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like she was chained," Allevato said. "She could have
left, but she's only 12 years old. How much can a 12-year-old in a
foreign country really do to leave?"</TE>
<TE>   Ibrahim's attorney said the girl never had any intention of
leaving and enjoyed her life in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "The child wants to continue living here," Stokke said. "She's
much better off here."</TE>
<TE>   Stokke said the girl slept in the garage only because there was no
room in the house.</TE>
<TE>   And he said Ibrahim's support of her and her family is part of a
well-established Egyptian practice of the well-to-do helping children
from poor families.</TE>
<TE>   Khaled Abou El Fadl, a professor of Islamic and Middle Eastern Law
at UCLA's School of Law, said that although the practice is common in
Egypt, it's a violation of that country's laws and has come under

<HD>A Smooth Ride for Freight Railway</HD>
<DH>Transportation: The $2.4-billion, 20-mile Alameda Corridor
project linking local ports with train hub is completed on time and
within budget.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As large-scale public works projects go, the $2.4-billion Alameda
Corridor is a rare achievement.</LD>
<LD>   The 20-mile rail cargo expressway linking the nation's busiest
harbor complex to train yards near downtown Los Angeles opens today
on budget, on schedule and free--relatively--of the problems that
usually accompany giant projects.</LD>
<LD>   A monument of stealth architecture two decades in the making, its
centerpiece is a 10-mile, below-ground rail line that will hardly be
noticed in the six cities it courses through.</LD>
<TE>   Yet the Alameda Corridor's economic benefits will ripple across
the nation from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to the vast
warehouse distribution centers of the Inland Empire and on to East
Coast markets.</TE>
<TE>   "The Alameda Corridor is a point of personal pride for Southern
California," said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles
County Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "It went smoothly," he said, "because everyone involved knew in
their heart of hearts that it would help keep this region at the
forefront of being able to attract new jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Initially, few would have predicted such an outcome.</TE>
<TE>   It took four years of often acrimonious negotiations just to
decide how to construct the railway. And many merchants complained of
lost business once work commenced.</TE>
<TE>   The Alameda Corridor was designed to boost Southern California's
status in global trade as a beachhead for a third of the waterborne
commerce coming into the United States, much of it directly from Asia
and Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach already handle more than
$200 billion worth of goods a year.</TE>
<TE>   Within 25 years, state transportation officials say, that volume
could nearly quadruple to the equivalent of more than 36 million
containers--half of them bound for points outside California via the
Alameda Corridor.</TE>
<TE>   Locally, officials say, the state's largest public works project
will provide a range of long-term environmental and economic benefits
in some of the Southland's most heavily industrialized cityscapes.</TE>
<TE>   By consolidating 90 miles of branch rail lines into one route, the
corridor will eliminate conflicts between trains and street traffic
at 209 rail crossings from downtown to the harbor.</TE>
<TE>   Planners predict significant reductions of noxious emissions from
idling cars and trucks waiting for 20 to 35 trains a day to creep
past--at 8 to 15 mph--in Los Angeles, Vernon, Compton, Lynwood,
Huntington Park, South Gate and Carson.</TE>
<TE>   Now, those trains will haul $100 billion a year in imports at 40
mph through a 33-foot-deep, 50-foot-wide trench largely paralleling
Alameda Street.</TE>
<TE>   Building that steel and concrete canyon required 150 million
pounds of rebar, 1 million cubic yards of concrete, the removal of 4
million tons of dirt and the relocation of 1,700 lines for sewers,
gas, electricity and fiber optic service.</TE>
<TE>   Digging below the water table also called for disposal of millions
of gallons of sludge tainted with heavy metals and other pollutants.</TE>
<TE>   Standing on a flatbed train car in the trench during a recent
tour, Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority Chief Executive
Officer James C. Hankla said, "This was a big, complicated project
with a lot of moving parts.</TE>
<TE>   "But I had the best engineers in the world, and we never lost
sight of our goal," he said. "It's an example of what can be
accomplished when governmental agencies join together to work in
cooperation with the private sector."</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, the Alameda Corridor, which runs through nine
political jurisdictions marked by conflicting interests and is
operated by rival ports and railroad companies, is a testament to the
perseverance of an assortment of disparate parties.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Century Freeway--one of the most expensive in the
nation's history--and the Metro Rail Red Line subway, both of which
came in late, over budget and racked with controversy, "this project
is being looked at very closely across the nation because it arrived
as planned and avoided potentially serious political skirmishes,"
said Long Beach City Councilman Frank Colonna, a member of the
authority.</TE>
<TE>   Not to say it escaped controversy. The city of Huntington Park,
for example, was among six cities that fought hard and successfully
to have the railway run below ground level as it passed through their
territory.</TE>
<TE>   "Having four rail crossings within a mile-long stretch of Alameda
meant our whole city was blocked off several times a day by trains
that were more than a mile long," recalled city engineer Pat Fu.</TE>
<TE>   "Drivers couldn't even detour. People were going other places to
shop," Fu said.</TE>
<TE>   The project was eventually built by the joint-powers authority,
which managed to forge consensus on the most vexing issues and tap an
innovative mix of public and private funding sources.</TE>
<TE>   The two ports were the chief financiers, providing $394 million.
The corridor authority issued $1.2 billion in revenue bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Additional funding includes a $400-million loan from the U.S.
Department of Transportation, $347 million allocated by the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority and $154 million from other
state and federal sources.</TE>
<TE>   User fees paid by the fiercely competitive Burlington Northern and
Santa Fe Railway and Union Pacific Railroad will generate revenue to
pay off the bond debt and federal loan.</TE>
<TE>   "The Alameda Corridor works to both our advantages," said Richard
A. Russack, vice president of corporate relations for Burlington
Northern.</TE>
<TE>   "We can get from the ports to the Hobart rail hub in [Los Angeles,
Vernon and the City of Commerce] in 30 minutes instead of three to
four hours," he said.</TE>
<TE>   What the Alameda Corridor won't do, despite earlier rosy
predictions otherwise, is absorb much of the truck traffic clogging
the aging and overburdened Long Beach Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Half of the 34,000 trucks that visit the ports each day rely on
that freeway, which has the highest truck accident rate in the state.
By 2020, the number of daily truck trips could exceed 92,000,
according to state transportation officials.</TE>
<TE>   Such dismal predictions, coupled with the construction of the
Alameda Corridor, have sparked intense interest in proposals for
improving transportation systems throughout Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The big question now: Which portion of the system should get fixed
first?</TE>
<TE>   Colonna of the corridor authority said, "With the completion of
the Alameda Corridor, the next step must be reconstruction of the 710
Freeway--a job that will require at least $3 billion and a decade to
complete."</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Betty Karnette (D-Long Beach), who chairs the
California State Blue-Ribbon Commission on Transportation, agreed, up
to a point.</TE>
<TE>   She worries that that the corridor's efficiency and speed will
lead to logjams of freight unless similar improvements are made along
connecting rail lines in the San Gabriel Valley and in Orange,
Riverside and San Bernardino counties--and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   "Completion of the Alameda Corridor is only the first chapter in
the epic challenge to goods movement in California and the nation,"
Karnette said at a downtown hearing Thursday on transportation
issues. "Remedial action is needed now."</TE>
<TE>   Similar warnings were expressed in the 1970s, when increases in
cargo crossing local docks first prompted port officials to consider
possible rail improvements while minimizing harm to residents and
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Construction of the Alameda Corridor began in April 1997 with work
on a three-track bridge over the Los Angeles River, replacing a
single-track bridge built in 1905. It ended with the cleanup of a
dozen acres between Long Beach and Wilmington that were home to
junkyards, prostitutes, crack dens and cockfighting rings.</TE>
<TE>   Today, with a flip of a switch turning red signals green, the
corridor is to be launched during dedication festivities led by U.S.
Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta, Gov. Gray Davis and Los
Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   All that was the furthest thing from the minds of most of the
people who work in the collection of grubby foundries,
body-and-fender shops, and scrap metal businesses fronting the
corridor's trench along Compton's portion of Alameda Street.</TE>
<TE>   They were more interested in the change in scenery since
construction began.</TE>
<TE>   Where railroad crossings once produced traffic jams in a
forbidding industrial landscape, cars and trucks were rolling over
the corridor trench on bridges installed with new traffic lights and
decorated with trees and flowers.</TE>
<TE>   As work crews added final touches, including mounting surveillance
cameras not far from Peter Noonan's ironworks business, he smiled
approvingly and said, "The Alameda Corridor is a great deal.</TE>
<TE>   "That railroad system used to be above ground on dirt berms
covered with broken glass and garbage--and trains belching smoke and
rattling along forever," he said. "All gone. My customers say they
feel more comfortable coming around now, and property values have
increased up to 12%."</TE>
<TE>   At nearby Active Security Training School, owner Lori Fitzpatrick
sighed with relief that the construction--and frequently diverted
traffic--had finally come to an end.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting back in a swivel chair in a cluttered, dimly lighted
office, she said, "Work in the trench raised a real stench; it
smelled like a sewer around here for two years."</TE>
<TE>   "It'll be interesting to see what happens next," she said. "We're
just hoping the Alameda Corridor does what it's supposed to."</TE>

<LD>A 10-year-old boy died Thursday after he was hit by gunfire in a
gang-related shooting in a park south of downtown, police said. A
40-year-old man was injured.</LD>
<LD>   The attack outside the Trinity Recreation Center on East 25th
Street was reported about 7:40 p.m., said LAPD Sgt. Terry Barclay.</LD>
<LD>   An argument between two gangs led members to return to the park
and open fire on rivals.</LD>
<TE>   The gunmen missed their targets, who fled, but struck the boy in
the park and the older man as he stood near his home across the
street. The boy was shot in the upper body; the man in the arm.</TE>

<HD>Dry Winter Sparks Early Fire Season</HD>
<DH>Environment: Rainfall is near a record low, raising the
risk for 3.4 million acres in Southland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The official fire season in much of Southern California will start a
month earlier than usual this year because of one of the driest
winters on record.</LD>
<LD>   The start of this year's season has been moved up to Monday in
several counties, and fire officials warn that the danger of brush
fires probably will remain high until the expected return of seasonal
rains shortly before Christmas.</LD>
<LD>   The 3.4 million acres of Southern California land patrolled by
state firefighters are drier than at any point since 1976, when
records were first kept, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "There is huge, thick brush, and it's dying off," Ventura County
Fire Department spokeswoman Sandi Wells said. "This fire season has
the potential to be the most dangerous in years. It could be
devastating."</TE>
<TE>   Taking a cue from the state Department of Forestry, Orange,
Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties will begin their
fire seasons in three days. This heightened alert calls for extra
staffing, increased public education and more equipment to stop
wildfires before they spread.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Fire Department has not extended its season
yet, but officials said it probably will begin before mid-May, the
traditional starting time.</TE>
<TE>   "'It's done to increase public awareness, to let people know that
the stuff out there is ready to burn," said Los Angeles County Fire
Inspector Kurt Schaefer.</TE>
<TE>   To prevent flare-ups, several controlled burns are scheduled in
the next four weeks across Ventura County. Fire departments in other
counties are calling up seasonal hand crews early to ensure adequate
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County is monitoring homes adjacent to rural brush areas,
Wells said. More than 17,000 weed-abatement notices will be sent out
April 20 to remind owners to clear brush within 100 feet of their
homes or risk having a $635 fine added to their tax bill, plus the
cost for county cleanup crews.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say the lack of rain, combined with overgrown brush,
makes areas throughout Southern California--including the Conejo
Valley, the foothill areas of Angeles National Forest, the Santa
Monica Mountains and others--ripe for a return of the sort of
devastating firestorms that occurred in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   At least 450 homes and 70,000 acres of brush and timberland went
up in flames when wildfires hit portions of Ventura, Los Angeles,
Orange, Riverside and San Diego counties that October.</TE>
<TE>   "We are as dry as a bone," Deputy Chief Bob Green of the state
forestry department said Thursday. "You have the ingredients for
fires to spread faster and with more intensity. This is not a normal
occurrence."</TE>
<TE>   Forecasters say this could be the driest rainfall season on
record.</TE>
<TE>   Only 4.27 inches of rain have fallen in downtown Los Angeles since
the beginning of the season, which runs from July 1 to June 31. The
driest season on record was 1960-1961, with 4.85 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana has collected just under 3 inches of rain so far. Last
year, the city had 14.04 inches of rain by April 10.</TE>
<TE>   The season's rainfall total for Ventura County is 6.78 inches,
compared with nearly 24 inches at this time in 2001. In Riverside,
San Bernardino and San Diego counties, rainfall levels are nearly 5
inches below 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Forecasters say an incipient El Nino meteorological condition
could bring heaver-than-usual rains later this year, but they
probably won't start until shortly before Christmas. Southern
California's fire season usually runs from May 15 through November,
with the most extensive blazes in late summer and early fall.</TE>
<TE>   Green said fires have scorched more than 6,000 acres from San Luis
Obispo to the Mexican border since January. Normally, he said, no
more than 700 acres burn during that period.</TE>
<TE>   "All the staff I have talked to have not recalled having this
intensity of fires," Green said.</TE>
<TE>   He said a brush fire Tuesday in the city of Riverside could be a
warning of larger fires to come. The blaze in the northwest corner of
the city burned more than 200 acres of dry brush-covered river
bottom.</TE>

<HD>Welcome to Camelot: A New City With the Same Old Freeway
Jams</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE LOPEZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Any day now, I expect to get a flier on my doorstep announcing a
campaign for Silver Lake to secede from Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   All of a sudden, secession has become trendy. The San Fernando
Valley wants out. San Pedro and Wilmington want out. Hollywood wants
out, but won't surrender the sign to L.A. A citywide brawl has
erupted, and before it's over, we may see flag-carrying secessionists
scaling the Westside hills to take the Getty.</LD>
<LD>   Growing up in Northern California, I often heard people say they
wanted no part of Los Angeles. But roughly half of Los Angeles now
wants no part of Los Angeles. Clearly, the electric personality of
Mayor Jim Hahn has not been a unifying force, and it's starting to
get embarrassing.</LD>
<TE>   You don't hear that Brooklyn wants out of New York City, do you?
Or that the South Side wants out of Chicago?</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to find out what's going on, I attended last week's
meeting to pick a name for the new Valley city that would be created
by secession. It was held just east of the 405, above the truck and
SUV showroom at Galpin Ford, which might make a nifty City Hall, and
drew 100 people who voted on names by placing blue and pink stickers
onto posters.</TE>
<TE>   It was quite a charming scene in many ways, as local folk made
impassioned pleas for their name of choice. But this isn't Mayberry
they're forming. It would be the sixth-largest city in America. And
after watching a process that resembled a kindergarten art project
sponsored by the local car dealer, I wondered if the leaders of this
mutiny might be in over their heads.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about community," said Bill Powers, a Valley VOTE board
member who made a nice speech about wanting more of a distinctive
sense of place, more services and more accountability from elected
representatives.</TE>
<TE>   All very commendable. Unfortunately, you don't get quaint
accountability in a sprawling city of 1.35 million people. You get a
whole new set of boondoggles, hacks and unavailable bureaucrats.</TE>
<TE>   That's if the city gets anything new at all. For a while, if not
forever, it'll be renting the same L.A. cops and firefighters,
drinking the same water, sending children to the same schools and
sitting in the same traffic jams.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean I'm against secession any more than I'm for it.
If you're aware of a compelling argument either way, please notify me
immediately. But it seems to me that if you broke Los Angeles into a
thousand Angelenostans, you'd still have the same major problems,
including bottlenecks, iffy schools and astronomical housing prices.</TE>
<TE>   And yet at the medicine show I went to in North Hills, people were
being sold a balm of daffodils and sunshine. Camelot, in fact, was
one of the five finalists, and Valley VOTE President Jeff Brain told
me he voted for it for a very good reason.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't have to accept things as they are," Brain said.
"Things can be better" in Camelot.</TE>
<TE>   Let me tell you a little story about Camelot.</TE>
<TE>   I spent 13 years in Philadelphia, which is roughly the size the
new Valley city would be. The entire time I was there, no one, in any
neighborhood, ever thought they were getting their fair share. And
unless you had a fixer, a mob connection, or an envelope stuffed with
cash, you didn't get within half a block of anybody who could make
sure your trash was picked up.</TE>
<TE>   So the Valley city isn't going to be a neat and manageable Walden
Pond. You are not going to walk down Ventura Boulevard, bump into Ed
the city manager at Aunt Bea's soda fountain, and have him send
someone out to trim your trees. Besides, to the extent that the gripe
is taxation without representation, what happens when the West Valley
starts carping about its tax dollars getting sucked across the plain
to the East Valley? I see another secession down the road. East
Camelot and West Camelot.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles philanthropist Eli Broad has called the breakup of Los
Angeles preposterous, and a good chunk of his money is going to go
into the campaign to keep it whole. Maybe some sections of the city
deserve better services, he said, but "putting a fence around San
Pedro and the Valley" isn't the answer.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to be the laughingstock of the nation," he told me.
"You cannot point to any city in world history that balkanized itself
and succeeded."</TE>
<TE>   When I told Broad I met someone at Galpin Ford who complained that
all the great cultural landmarks are south of Mulholland, not
counting the pornography industry, his heart did not bleed for the
guy.</TE>
<TE>   "You can only have one great symphony, one great opera. Why do
people go to Manhattan from all the other boroughs, Westchester and
New Jersey? Because it's the center where people of all backgrounds
meet to enjoy sports, culture, and entertainment. Every city has to
come together in one center."</TE>
<TE>   Yeah. And maybe it'll even happen in L.A. one day.</TE>
<TE>   At least Broad's got a vision for this place. When I asked Jeff
Brain if he had one for the new Valley city, he said it's a work in
progress.</TE>
<TE>   "We've not yet laid out a vision for people," he said of the
movement that began in 1996. "But that will come."</TE>
<TE>   I promise I shall worry not</TE>
<TE>   Let L.A. wither; let her rot</TE>
<TE>   I'll meet you by the 405</TE>
<TE>   In Camelot, in Camelot.</TE>

<HD>Deputies Interview 100 in Probe of Azusa Priest</HD>
<DH>Scandal: The cleric, who was removed from his church, has
denied the allegations of molestation made in a call to a hotline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER and RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is wrapping up an
investigation of Father David Granadino, a Catholic priest accused of
molesting boys at his church in Azusa, law enforcement officials said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's investigators said they have interviewed nearly 100
altar boys, students and other youths at St. Francis of Rome Catholic
Church over the last two weeks. They expect to complete the
investigation in the next few days.</LD>
<LD>   Granadino could not be reached for comment Thursday. An e-mail
exchange among officials of the Los Angeles Archdiocese said the
priest has "denied forcefully any misconduct." Granadino offered to
provide authorities with a list of altar boys at the church,
according to the e-mails, which were leaked to the media earlier this
month.</LD>
<TE>   Granadino, who also served as a Sheriff's Department chaplain, was
removed by the archdiocese as head of St. Francis when the
investigation began. The Sheriff's Department inquiry was triggered
by an anonymous call on March 22 to the archdiocese's hotline, which
was created to field sexual-abuse allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese officials provided sheriff's detectives with a tape of
the telephone call. The hotline is providing scores of tips,
including many false leads, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony was cleared by authorities
of an abuse allegation made by a Fresno woman.</TE>
<TE>   In the Azusa case, Sheriff's Capt. Patti Minutello said 15
investigators are interviewing boys, girls and parents, as well as
gathering evidence and following up on new allegations.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department did not reveal the name of the priest to
The Times, but law enforcement sources confirmed that Granadino is
being investigated.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are conferring with the Los Angeles County district
attorney's office, advising prosecutors about what they've learned,
said Sheriff's Department Sgt. Dan Scott.</TE>
<TE>   Granadino, who had worked as a chaplain at the department's
station in Industry, has not been interviewed by sheriff's
detectives.</TE>
<TE>   The parish secretary at St. Francis of Rome said Granadino is at a
retreat and could not be reached for comment. He resides at an abbey
in the Antelope Valley.</TE>
<TE>   He was described in an e-mail from Msgr. Craig Cox to Cardinal
Mahony as reluctant to leave the parish after the accusation,
especially in the week before Easter. That correspondence was among
the archdiocese e-mails obtained last week by KFI radio.</TE>
<TE>   Some St. Francis parishioners describe Granadino as outgoing.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a very dynamic personality. He endears himself to
everyone," said Joe Rocha, an Azusa city councilman and longtime
parishioner. "Father David is very active in the community. When
people need help, he is always there for them."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every day brings new accusations against priests on the
archdiocese hotline, law enforcement officials said. The tips are
referred to police.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Det. Dale Barraclough, who supervises the
sexually exploited child unit, said he speaks "every other day or so"
to Sister Judith Ann Murphy, an attorney for the archdiocese, .</TE>
<TE>   "She calls reporting new people all the time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD has assigned six detectives to investigate the
allegations. The team has its own phone line--(213) 485-2883--"to
report sexual abuse by a religious leader," according to the taped
message. Barraclough said the detectives specialize in abuse by those
in positions of trust and authority.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD also is reviewing some older cases, he said, to determine
whether there are grounds to pursue new allegations against priests
convicted of past crimes.</TE>
<TE>   At the request of the archdiocese, the Police Department is acting
as a liaison between the church and other law enforcement agencies,
said LAPD Cmdr. Gary Brennan. The department will pass on tips to
police agencies outside Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Archdiocese covers Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa
Barbara counties.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese is among a number of Catholic ministries around
the country enmeshed in the widening clerical sex-abuse scandal.
Accusations, some recent and some decades old, first surfaced in
Boston earlier this year.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Officer Obeys a Personal Call to Service</HD>
<DH>People: USC film student Amotz Zakai will hit the Cannes
Film Festival, then rejoin the Israel Defense Forces.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM HOLLANDER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amotz Zakai is working out a lot these days, running, lifting
weights, practicing martial arts.</LD>
<LD>   Zakai is a 28-year-old filmmaker completing his master of fine
arts degree at the Peter Stark Producing Program at USC while working
as a development executive at a movie production company a block from
Venice Beach.</LD>
<LD>   He is also a lieutenant in the Israel Defense Forces, seven years
removed from active duty.</LD>
<TE>   In a few weeks, he will return to Jerusalem to don his uniform and
rejoin his artillery unit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting back in top physical shape," he says. "I want to be
at my peak condition."</TE>
<TE>   Like many among the tens of thousands of Israelis living in
Southern California, says Zakai, the developments of the past several
months in Israel and the occupied territories have been gnawing at
him.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel obliged because of what Israel is going through," says
Zakai, a smallish man whose soft looks and demeanor belie his
military accomplishments. "I feel guilty that I'm not contributing my
share, that other people are doing it and I'm not there."</TE>
<TE>   Zakai notes that reserve duty is required of Israelis living at
home but not for those living abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of my friends and classmates have been drafted into
service," he says. "It's important for me to go back and give support
to them, and my country."</TE>
<TE>   Living comfortably in America when so much is happening back in
Israel has become increasingly difficult, he adds.</TE>
<TE>   "I got this from my mother; she's very patriotic toward Israel,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately, he notes an irony: His mother is from Miami Beach and
moved to Israel in the 1960s after becoming disillusioned with
America's involvement in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   In Israel, she met and married a paratrooper who had been born and
raised on a kibbutz on the Mediterranean coast between Tel Aviv and
Haifa.</TE>
<TE>   "In essence," he adds, "if the Vietnam War didn't happen, I
wouldn't be here today."</TE>
<TE>   As a child in a more peaceful era, Zakai and his family liked to
go into East Jerusalem and eat at the Arab restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of the most fun things we used to do," Zakai says.</TE>
<TE>   He recalls that his father regularly frequented several
restaurants and stores in the Old City and that when the rest of the
family accompanied him, the Palestinian proprietors would welcome
them.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to make school trips into the Old City too," he says. "It
was great. We'd wander around; it was sort of like kids in America
going to a mall."</TE>
<TE>   While attending high school in Jerusalem, Zakai used to
participate in soccer games with a nearby Palestinian school, he
says.</TE>
<TE>   But the athletic events and other attempts to bring the two
schools together were often canceled, he recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Like all Israeli men and women, Zakai began his military service
right out of high school in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   After boot camp, he joined an artillery battalion and was selected
for officers' training.</TE>
<TE>   During the next four years, he spent nearly half that time serving
in Lebanon and the occupied territories.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, he was riding in a jeep near the West Bank town of
Jenin--the scene of the worst casualties in the current fighting.</TE>
<TE>   An explosion rocked the vehicle, and his head went through the
windshield. He was hospitalized with a severe concussion.</TE>
<TE>   After his military service, Zakai came to America in 1995. He
accompanied his father, a professor of early American history at
Hebrew University, who was on a yearlong sabbatical at the Center of
Theological Inquiry in Princeton, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   After managing a restaurant in Princeton for a year, Zakai
enrolled in the filmmaking program at the Rochester Institute of
Technology in New York. Two years ago he came to Los Angeles to
attend USC's graduate film school.</TE>
<TE>   Seven years of living in America and being a decade older have
given him a different perspective on military life, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "There are things I did back then that I wouldn't do now," Zakai
says. "Back when I was 20, I never thought I was going to die. I
didn't think anything could harm me. But being in America has allowed
me to see a more global perspective and see where we are in the
scheme of things, because in Israel, it's your entire world."</TE>
<TE>   For instance, one of his best friends in America is an Egyptian.
And he has met and discussed "the situation" with many Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, he says, it concerns him that young soldiers, given
the "exuberance of youth" and the authority associated with having a
gun in their hands, often get carried away with power. The occupation
"becomes a culture of one people having power over another," he says.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, he adds, he supports Israel's military actions as
necessary for the nation's self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   While on duty once in the Gaza Strip, Zakai recounts, he "had to
burst into a house at 2 in the morning looking for terrorists. I felt
bad--I knew it was humiliating for these people. But it wasn't our
policy. That wasn't the objective."</TE>
<TE>   Now, in addition to shooting his thesis film, Zakai works full
time in development at Echo Lake Productions, a Venice-based
production company that most recently produced Allison Anders'
"Things Behind the Sun." He is also producing a documentary about
legendary actress Nina Foch.</TE>
<TE>   For Zakai, the world of real and fantasy will collide in a few
weeks at the Cannes Film Festival.</TE>
<TE>   He will fly from southern France directly to Israel, put on his
uniform and quite possibly be sent right into a war zone.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could do it backward," Zakai says. "It would be nice if
I could get the danger out of the way first, then go have some fun.</TE>
<TE>   "But that's what's so weird. Here you'll have this film festival,
and all these parties, and naked women on the beach. And across the
sea, you have a horrible war and people killing each other."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm terrified," he says, admitting self-doubt. "I haven't led
soldiers in a while. I wonder if I'm the right person. I haven't been
there in a long time."</TE>
<TE>   "But I swore an oath to protect the country, and I feel that
obligation to go back."</TE>

<HD>Big Campuses Harm Morale, Survey Finds</HD>
<DH>Education: New study says class size is a less important
factor in middle and high school students' lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of students in a class does not influence their behavior,
but the size of a middle or high school has serious effects on young
people's lives, according to a national survey released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers at the University of Minnesota found that very big
campuses--particularly ones that have more than 1,200 students, as
commonly found throughout Southern California--foster more
alienation, drug use and risky behavior. Students often feel less
attached to those campuses and less comfortable around peers and
school staff.</LD>
<LD>   Those findings came as little surprise at the 4,100-student Los
Angeles High School near Koreatown.</LD>
<TE>   "The amount of people we have may make some [students] feel like
we are not as important," said senior Ismael Cueva, 17. "Sometimes
you get lost in the numbers."</TE>
<TE>   Many Los Angeles High students on the Olympic Boulevard campus
don't even know who the administrators are, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Administrators, however, said they try their best to make the
sprawling campus feel more personal by reaching out to parents and
students.</TE>
<TE>   "We can only do it one person at a time, but we chip away at it
and do the best we can," said Carol Wilmington, an assistant
principal.</TE>
<TE>   The University of Minnesota survey is the latest research
suggesting that students who attend smaller schools are less likely
to drop out, be depressed and engage in risky behavior such as drug
and alcohol use, violence or unprotected sex.</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota researchers said the ideal size for a middle or high
school is 600 to 1,200 students, with smaller ones lacking academic
resources and bigger ones triggering social problems.</TE>
<TE>   More than 90,000 students at 132 schools across the country were
surveyed between 1994 and 1995. Students were asked about
self-esteem, friendships, classwork, health and expectations about
their future.</TE>
<TE>   "Beyond families, it's clear that school is the central
socializing force in the lives of young people," said Dr. Robert
William Blum, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for
Adolescent Health and Development.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not talking about tearing down school buildings," he said.
"What we are suggesting is that how teachers teach and how they and
administrators manage the school environment has an important
impact."</TE>
<TE>   Schools throughout California and the nation have been under
pressure to decrease class size and hire more qualified teachers to
improve academic achievement among students. The new study, which did
not examine academic achievement, says the number of youngsters in a
class is not as important to behavior as the teacher's ability to
manage well.</TE>
<TE>   That rang true for Jennifer Gonzalez, 16, a junior at Los Angeles
High.</TE>
<TE>   "A class doesn't have to be small for you to feel like you're a
part of it," she said. "It depends on the warmth of the teacher
because if you feel like your teacher appreciates that you're doing
good work, it motivates you."</TE>
<TE>   Interest in smaller schools' links to student behavior increased
after school shootings, such as the 1999 massacre by two students at
Columbine High School, a 1,965-student suburban school in Jefferson
County, Colo. The issue has attracted attention from organizations
such as the Seattle-based Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is
funding smaller schools throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   Paul D. Houston, executive director of the American Assn. of
School Administrators, said Thursday that big schools should not be
destroyed but that districts must improve their environment and
consider building smaller schools in the future. Schools must
acknowledge volunteerism, good citizenship and attendance, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Houston said schools are so pressured to boost test scores that
social issues have been de-emphasized.</TE>
<TE>   "They are, in essence, abandoning a lot of the very practices
that, historically, this study says are probably good and ought to be
done," he said. "This is a wake-up call to remind people that
[academics] are only part of the equation."</TE>
<TE>   The survey also found that extracurricular activities make
students feel more attached and comfortable. But many schools'
year-round calendars make participation in clubs and sports
problematic.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A San Diego-area dentist was acquitted Thursday of involuntary
manslaughter in the party drug death of a woman who fell from a Long
Beach hotel balcony.</LD>
<LD>   The Long Beach Superior Court jury also acquitted Kami Hoss, 35,
of a charge that he gave Sandra Rodriguez, 26, of Ontario, the
illegal, mood-altering drug Ecstasy.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors accused Hoss of giving Ecstasy to Rodriguez and two
other women that the dentist and his wife met at a bar in Long Beach.
Authorities alleged that Rodriguez had an adverse reaction to the
drug after returning to Hoss' hotel room for a drink. Hoss allegedly
dragged Rodriguez out of the room when she became ill and left her in
the hall. Her body was found in a flower bed outside the hotel.</LD>
<TE>   Hoss' lawyer said someone else gave Rodriguez the drug.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors deliberated for less than a day before returning their
verdict.</TE>

<HD>Parks Get Priority in Budget</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Hahn plans to renovate 50 facilities, add
children's programs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn said Thursday that despite a gloomy
fiscal prognosis, the city should be able to expand after-school
programs and refurbish 50 parks next year with money from federal
grants and a local bond measure.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn would not, however, release the full details of his proposed
2002-03 city budget, which will be submitted next week to the City
Council for its review. The council has until June 1 to study the
document and act on it.</LD>
<LD>   The budget that Hahn submits is expected to address a shortfall of
as much as $250 million, a gap that has many city department heads
and others worried about coming cuts. On Thursday, Hahn would not
specify what will have to go, although he said he will not propose
raising taxes or curtailing city services that directly affect
residents. By law, the budget that the mayor submits must be
balanced.</LD>
<TE>   "What we tried to do was scour the budget for monies that were not
being used," Hahn said. "This budget is about squeezing everything we
can out of every last dollar we're getting from the public, because
we know how precious those hard-earned tax dollars are."</TE>
<TE>   The tight financial situation limits flexibility in next year's
spending plan just as Hahn and other city leaders are attempting to
persuade residents not to pursue a breakup of Los Angeles.
Demonstrating improvement in city services is at the heart of Hahn's
campaign to persuade voters to reject secession by the San Fernando
Valley, Hollywood and possibly the harbor area.</TE>
<TE>   "The key to making Los Angeles a united city is to make people
realize that government is doing a better job," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, the mayor did not focus on the likelihood of cuts
during his visit Thursday to a Panorama City park, where he rolled
out the first of his budget priorities for the next fiscal year,
which begins in July.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn proposed spending $4.1 million on improvements at city parks,
including the hiring of staff members to maintain swimming pools and
child-care centers. In some cases, the city also is buying new
equipment and building new facilities; those costs will be covered by
federal grants, money from Proposition K--a city bond issue passed in
1996--and other sources, according to Hahn's staff.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor also said he has set aside $1 million to continue the
expansion of the popular LA's BEST after-school program to 23 more
campuses scattered across the city. One will host the first
mainstream special education program, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's announcement drew praise from parks officials, even though
they don't yet know the full budget picture.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Roos, president of the Recreation and Parks Commission, said
the mayor should be called "Harry Houdini Hahn" for finding money to
rehabilitate parks as he being forced to cut other programs.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to commend him for, in this very, very difficult time,
continuing to make the commitment to children, to youth and to
safety," Roos said.</TE>
<TE>   Ellen Oppenheim, general manager of the Department of Recreation
and Parks, said she was relieved to learn the agency will get money
to make physical improvements to parks and keep up their maintenance.
But she said she still does not know how much money her department
will be allowed to spend next year.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't and won't have the full picture on it until we get the
mayor's budget," Oppenheim said. "So I'm not able to fully analyze
it. I'm certainly encouraged by the news he shared this morning."</TE>
<TE>   By emphasizing parks as one of his major budget priorities, Hahn
picks up on a theme started by his predecessor, former Mayor Richard
Riordan, who ended his administration with a campaign to fix up Los
Angeles' green spaces.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan refurbished 37 parks during his last year in office, and
provided funding for another 10 parks to be rehabilitated this year.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he wants to continue funding Riordan's program, which
involves adding staff members and youth programs at the park sites.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor also said he will keep the city's summer youth jobs
program, which employs 17,000 teenagers, and will maintain support
for after-school programs at middle schools that are intended to keep
students out of gangs.</TE>

<HD>South Gate Official Posts $500,000 Bond, Is Released</HD>
<DH>Court: City Treasurer Albert Robles denies murderous
threats against public officials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The same day that a judge called him a serious threat to the
community, South Gate Treasurer Albert Robles posted an unusually
high $500,000 bail Thursday and returned to his tense city.</LD>
<LD>   Robles was charged with making murderous threats against public
officials, and ordered to keep at least 100 feet away from witnesses
or victims. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</LD>
<LD>   In a stern warning, Superior Court Judge Dennis A. Aichroth
ordered Robles to depart immediately if chance brings him together
with anyone involved in the case, including two state legislators.
"If the defendant has half a brain, and I'm sure he does, he'll
leave," Aichroth said.</LD>
<TE>   Then, focusing on Robles, he added, "Because otherwise someone is
going to make an accusation, sir, that you have harassed them and the
next thing you know, you will be in here and the bail will be $1.5
million."</TE>
<TE>   While preparing for the return of the volatile politician, the
city learned Thursday, in a separate development, that the FBI has
opened a political corruption investigation in South Gate.</TE>
<TE>   Subpoenaed late Wednesday, the city clerk was ordered to turn over
all documents involving professional service contracts, which include
attorney and consultant agreements.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear if the FBI probe is related to Robles. But news of
the investigation, combined with the Robles case, seemed to push
tensions to the boiling point. After a City Council meeting
Wednesday, two councilmen had to be separated by police after a
heated shouting match.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a tremendous desire to move the city in a
positive direction, but it can't as long as this stuff is going on,"
said the Rev. Charles N. Brady, who has held weekly prayer vigils
outside City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Robles' release came after a contentious hearing in which a judge
sided with a prosecutor's unusual request that bail be set at
$500,000--double the usual amount for such cases.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Chasworth, assistant head deputy of the district attorney's
public integrity unit, argued that people "are in fear, and continue
to be in fear."</TE>
<TE>   When it appeared that Robles would raise the bail--family members
offered to help--Chasworth asked the judge to determine if the funds
came from legitimate sources.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors alleged that Robles might possibly divert money from
the city treasury or his political action committees to raise bail
money. The judge concluded that the bond came from a reputable bail
bond agency and ordered Robles' release.</TE>
<TE>   When Robles explained that he recently had been at a fund-raiser
also attended by one of his alleged victims, state Sen. Martha
Escutia (D-Whittier), Aichroth warned him to avoid such functions and
leave promptly if he encountered someone involved in the case.</TE>
<TE>   South Gate police would not comment on whether special security
precautions would be taken. But authorities in similar situations
typically increase patrols around witnesses' homes.</TE>
<TE>   Robles has been charged with threatening four people, including
Escutia, Assemblyman Marco Antonio Firebaugh (D-Los Angeles) and a
police officer. He also is charged with possessing two illegal
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Robles threatened to rape Escutia and kill
her husband, Leo Briones. They also allege that Robles threatened to
"blow the brains out" of Firebaugh.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted on the nine counts, Robles faces a potential
eight-year prison term.</TE>
<TE>   During the hearing, Robles--attired in a black business suit, his
hands handcuffed behind him--largely kept silent, except to answer
questions.</TE>
<TE>   Released late Thursday, he was not available for comment, but his
attorney, Tom Brown, denied that he posed a danger. He said Robles
would resume his normal duties as treasurer.</TE>
<TE>   "If Albert was a serious threat, then the [district attorney's
office] two years ago would have arrested him, when the alleged
threats were actually made," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Robles' release generated mixed reactions in the courtroom, packed
mostly with Robles' enemies, but also some of his family members.
Robles' opponents were dejected when he was able to post bail. "He is
a threat to the community ... Albert has been threatening people for
the last five or six years," said Joe Ruiz, a harsh critic.</TE>
<TE>   Robles says he is the victim of a politically motivated case in
retaliation for standing up to his political enemies. Over the years,
Robles has been at odds with Escutia and Firebaugh on numerous
issues. He admits using harsh language, but said it merely reflects
strongly held views.</TE>

<LD>Talk about a case of mistaken identity! The Laguna News-Post reported
that "a resident called to say that a mother dog and her pups were
wandering out of a building and into traffic. Animal control was sent
to the location, and the dogs turned out to be ducks.''</LD>
<LD>   What's that old saying: If it jaywalks like a duck and talks like
a duck....</LD>
<LD>   Quack alert: And, no, I'm not sure if this was the same reckless
quacker who held up traffic in West L.A. Monday morning, while a
California Highway Patrol officer and a tow-truck driver ushered her
family across several lanes of the San Diego Freeway.</LD>
<TE>   Sci-fi material: On a hiking trail in Pacific Palisades, Joe
Garrett spotted a scary "actual size'' warning (see photo). "A couple
of times hikers have asked me if the ticks are really that big
there,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   Quake displacement? On a trip overseas, Bonnie Chapman of Santa
Barbara picked up a travel brochure and discovered that her neighbor
to the south was now her distant neighbor to the north (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   And I'll bet L.A. City Hall didn't notify anyone in the San
Fernando Valley, either.</TE>
<TE>   History on trial: Paige Gold was waiting in probate court when she
heard a young L.A. County deputy sheriff, seated behind the counter,
ask a young lawyer: "Who was president after Eisenhower?'' The lawyer
said, "Carter.''</TE>
<TE>   The deputy responded: "I don't think so. Eisenhower was much
earlier than that.''</TE>
<TE>   Another lawyer, passing by, overheard the conversation and said,
"Kennedy.''</TE>
<TE>   The deputy looked down at his crossword puzzle and said, "Nope,
that has too many letters.''</TE>
<TE>   Before I hear from those of you who know the tricky ways of such
puzzles, I'll point out that both Carter and Kennedy were possible
answers, since the question didn't ask who was the NEXT president
after Ike.</TE>
<TE>   Long night: Elaine Ziskind of Tarzana came upon a restaurant sign
that was put up by someone who sleeps in really late (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Sour note: Ross Amspoker of Palmdale said the minutes of a concert
organization in Antelope Valley reported that a soprano who was to
appear in Lancaster had previously sung at "Carnage'' Hall in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Marquee madness (cont.): I didn't win the Pulitzer this year
because my submission of quirky movie combos was small. With more
titles coming in now, I'm darn confident about my chances next year.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Ann Doskow of Claremont wrote that the most gruesome
twosome she ever saw advertised was in the early 1960s: JACK THE
RIPPER ALL IN A NIGHT'S WORK.</TE>
<TE>   Plus this added attraction: Richard Bauman recalled a 1970s
marquee on a La Mirada theater: BLAZING SADDLES WHERE DOES IT HURT?</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Today's "Duh!'' award winner was submitted by Steve
Katz of Rancho Palos Verdes, who noticed that the package containing
his Jack in the Box antenna ball warned: "Not for use with
retractable antenna.''</TE>

<HD>Knoblauch Provides Edge the Royals Need</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chuck Knoblauch's winning style is rubbing off on the Kansas City
Royals.</LD>
<LD>   Knoblauch, a member of three New York Yankee championship teams,
doubled in the go-ahead run as Kansas City scored four times in the
ninth inning and defeated the Boston Red Sox, 8-5, Thursday night at
Boston.</LD>
<LD>   The win evened the Royals' record at 4-4 and ended a streak of 267
games in which they were below .500, the longest the majors.</LD>
<TE>   "The thing that I learned with the Yankees that I'd like to pass
onto these guys is we came with the same attitude every day,"
Knoblauch said. "Let's win today."</TE>
<TE>   The Royals had losing records the last seven seasons and weren't
expected to do much this season. Knoblauch, however, remembers 1991
when he was a rookie with Minnesota, which vastly exceeded
expectations by winning the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   The Royals stayed confident Thursday despite trailing 4-1 after
two innings and 5-4 after a triple by former Kansas City player
Johnny Damon in the eighth scored Rey Sanchez, who went three for
four.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City won its fourth consecutive series at Fenway Park,
winning the last two games each time after dropping the opener.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of going in and hoping we can do things, now I think
[players] are starting to believe that we can go into somebody's
house and win," said Jason Grimsley (1-0), another former Yankee.</TE>
<TE>   The ninth-inning double capped an outstanding series for
Knoblauch. He hit a grand slam in the opening game, Boston's 8-4
victory Tuesday. On Wednesday, he matched his career high with three
stolen bases in a 6-2 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "This loss was more frustrating than last night because we took
back the lead," Boston catcher Jason Varitek said.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 8, Minnesota 4--Omar Vizquel hit a three-run homer and
the Indians won their eighth in a row in completing a four-game sweep
against the Twins at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Former Twin Matt Lawton made two sensational catches in right
field for the Indians, who are 9-1 and off to their best start since
opening 10-0 in 1966. Cleveland completed its first four-game sweep
of the Twins since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Bartolo Colon (3-0) gave up four runs and seven hits in 51/3
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 15, Tampa Bay 6--Geronimo Gil and Mike Bordick homered
in a 12-run sixth inning at Baltimore as the Orioles ended a losing
streak at six.</TE>
<TE>   Held to six runs during the losing streak, Baltimore ended the
drought in record fashion. The Orioles set team marks for runs (12)
and hits (11) in an inning.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 11, New York 3--Roger Clemens struggled on short rest as a
fill-in for Orlando Hernandez, giving up six runs in five innings as
the Yankees lost to the Blue Jays at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez missed his start with a sore neck. Clemens (1-2),
originally scheduled to start today in Boston, offered to pitch on
three days' rest.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 7, Oakland 0--Doug Davis pitched a two-hitter for his first
career shutout and rookie Kevin Mench hit his first homer and had
four RBIs to lead the Rangers at Arlington, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Davis (2-0), making his 45th career start, struck out six and
walked one. He allowed only one runner past first base in his third
complete game.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Team Identifies Its Meekness</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The season was only eight games old but it already felt like an
out-of-the-pennant-race September in the Angel clubhouse Thursday
afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Getting pounded on the field while going down meekly at the plate
tends to create such an environment, especially following what team
officials considered a positive spring training. So Angel hitting
coach Mickey Hatcher called a hitters' meeting in an attempt to ease
the players' minds after their sluggish start.</LD>
<LD>   "I just told them that they're going to be fine," Hatcher said.
"They've got to dig in there and compete. We're coming off a good
spring training and I can see their frustration. There's no time to
be frustrated; it's time to compete."</LD>
<TE>   Through eight games, the Angels were batting .212 as a team and
the only Angel to have hit a home run was third baseman Troy Glaus,
who had three.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, five of the Angels' starters Thursday night were batting
below .195.</TE>
<TE>   Hatcher said the Angels have been taking too many first-pitch
fastballs for strikes and he could tell by their body language in the
batter's box if they were going to take a pitch or swing away.</TE>
<TE>   "I shouldn't be able to tell that," Hatcher said. "To a pitcher,
that's a free pitch."</TE>
<TE>   But the meeting wasn't all about mechanics. "Guys need to loosen
up and have fun," Hatcher said. "I want these guys to swing
themselves out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Said Manager Mike Scioscia: "Some guys are battling some ghosts of
September that we thought we [exorcised] in spring training. But all
in all it's early."</TE>
<TE>   Angel closer Troy Percival, on the 15-day disabled list since
April 3 with a strained muscle in his rib cage, played catch
Wednesday and will throw a bullpen session today.</TE>
<TE>   Mariner right-hander James Baldwin, who was not offered a contract
by the Dodgers after being traded to them last summer, said he's
found a home in Seattle and that he harbors no grudge toward the
Dodgers, who he hoped would sign him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a business," said Baldwin, who signed a one-year contract
with an option in Seattle. "In this game, you expect a lot, but you
have to be realistic.</TE>
<TE>   "But here, they make you feel at home.... These guys don't just
hope to win; they expect to win."</TE>

<HD>Angels Meet Their Match Again, 8-4</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The pregame meeting called by hitting coach Mickey Hatcher on
Thursday had two purposes--to remind the Angels how to hit, and to
have more fun.</LD>
<LD>   But while the Angels ended up with more hits than Seattle did
Thursday night, it was the Mariners who had more fun.</LD>
<LD>   Seattle's 8-4 win in front of 18,806 at Edison Field completed a
four-game sweep of the Angels, who were reduced to holding another
closed-door meeting following the loss.</LD>
<TE>   And while there were a number of points for the Angels to
ponder--ranging from the fact that the Mariners have beaten them 12
straight times in Anaheim and 19 of the last 23 meetings overall to
the cold realization that they are 1-6 at home to open a season for
the first time since 1971--Angel Manager Mike Scioscia insisted that
the skull session was all about stressing the positives.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys are upbeat," Scioscia said. "They've just got to relax
and ... not try too hard.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a good ballclub in that room and we're going to show it
over the course of the season. Tonight we made some good strides.
It's a loss, but I saw some good signs tonight."</TE>
<TE>   One of those was the Angels, whose .212 team batting average
entering the game was the second-lowest in the American League,
outhitting the Mariners, 10-8, with David Eckstein and Adam Kennedy
getting three hits apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Seattle starter Freddy Garcia (1-2) picked up his
first win of the season, going 61/3 innings and giving up four runs,
three earned, and nine hits. Garcia had three strikeouts and did not
walk a batter.</TE>
<TE>   Angel starter Scott Schoeneweis (1-1) took the loss, giving up
eight runs and six hits in 52/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   The left-hander's earned-run average ballooned from 1.08 to 5.79
after he walked four batters (one intentionally), hit two and struck
out three against the Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners jumped to a 2-0 lead in the fourth inning.</TE>
<TE>   With one out, Schoeneweis hit Edgar Martinez with a pitch. One
batter later, Mike Cameron drove a 3-and-1 Schoeneweis pitch the
other way, clearing the wall in right-center for his second home run
of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels tied it an inning later.</TE>
<TE>   A one-out Eckstein single to right field drove in Scott Spiezio,
who had also singled to right to lead off the inning, for Anaheim's
first run.</TE>
<TE>   Darin Erstad reached first to load the bases on an error by
Garcia, who missed the bag covering on a hard grounder to Seattle
first baseman Jeff Cirillo.</TE>
<TE>   Then Garret Anderson jumped on the first pitch he saw, a 93-mph
fastball from Garcia, and drove it to deep center field. It had the
distance to clear the wall for a grand slam, but Cameron timed his
leap perfectly and pulled the ball back in, turning the drive into a
comparatively harmless sacrifice fly.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Adam Kennedy was able to tag up from third and tie the
score, 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   But it would not matter.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners sent 10 batters to the plate in the sixth inning,
scored six runs and chased Schoeneweis.</TE>
<TE>   The big hit was a two-out, three-run double by Cirillo off Angel
reliever Donne Wall.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't really put my finger on it," Schoeneweis said of his
sixth-inning troubles. "I think in a tight game, I was pressing a bit
and trying to throw a perfect pitch but missed by a hair.</TE>
<TE>   "When you lose three games in a row, you want to be the guy that
stops the bleeding."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it was the Mariners who couldn't be stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "Next thing you know," Schoeneweis said, "it's 8-2."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels scored two runs in the seventh and were threatening for
more, but on Mariner reliever Shigetoshi Hasegawa's first pitch,
Anderson grounded into an inning-ending double play.</TE>
<TE>   On a night when Seattle Manager Lou Piniella did not start
regulars John Olerud, Mark McLemore and Ichiro Suzuki, the Mariners'
designated hitter, Edgar Martinez, went down in the ninth running out
a ground ball. He was diagnosed with a pulled left hamstring and will
undergo an MRI test today.</TE>
<TE>   With the Angels in the midst of 19 games against AL West rivals,
and the pitching-rich Oakland Athletics in town for a three-game
series beginning tonight, Anaheim's early-season morale will be
tested as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Some guys are pressing a little bit," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   "But it absolutely is not a situation of here we go again."</TE>

<HD>Injury Sidelines Rangers' Gonzalez</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Juan Gonzalez was put on the 15-day disabled list Thursday with a
torn muscle in his right hand, the latest injury blow for the Texas
Rangers.</LD>
<LD>   Gonzalez was injured when he was jammed on a swing in Oakland a
week ago. He played the next two games but--after a two-day break
because of a rainout and a scheduled day off--pulled himself out of
Tuesday night's game against the Athletics after his first at-bat.</LD>
<LD>   "It's surprising because it's the first time in my career that my
right hand has bothered me," said Gonzalez, a two-time AL MVP. "It's
part of the game, and I'm not going to put my head down. I've had a
lot of injuries before and come back and put up good numbers."</LD>
<TE>   An X-ray Tuesday night found nothing. But Gonzalez had an MRI and
saw a hand specialist Wednesday, and the tear was found in fiber
between his thumb and index finger.</TE>
<TE>   The move is retroactive to Wednesday. The Rangers recalled
infielder Mike Lamb, a former Bishop Amat High and Cal State
Fullerton standout, from triple-A Oklahoma to fill Gonzalez's spot on
the roster.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez joined No. 1 starter Chan Ho Park (right hamstring) and
closer Jeff Zimmerman (tendinitis right elbow) on the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland Athletic starter Mark Mulder left Thursday's game against
Texas after four innings because of tightness in his left forearm.</TE>
<TE>   "It just got real tight on me," Mulder said after the Athletics'
7-0 loss. "I didn't have command."</TE>
<TE>   Mulder (2-1), a 21-game winner last year, gave up four runs and
six hits in four innings against the Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   Florida Manager Jeff Torborg was suspended two games and fined an
undisclosed amount for excessive arguing during the Marlins' home
opener.</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Kevin Olsen also was suspended three games and fined
for intentionally throwing at and hitting Philadelphia's Marlon
Anderson last Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Harrington, a second-round pick of the San Diego Padres last
year, signed with the Long Beach Breakers of the independent Western
League. Harrington, who was drafted No. 7 overall but never signed
with the Colorado Rockies after graduating from Palmdale High in
2000, pitched for the St. Paul Saints of the Northern League last
season.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati Red reliever Luis Pineda was suspended for three games
for hitting Todd Hundley of the Cubs with a pitch last week.... The
Reds put catcher Kelly Stinnett on the 15-day disabled list with a
sore right elbow.</TE>

<LD>Between Townsend Bell's junior and senior years at UC Santa Barbara,

<LD>   "I'd heard a lot of men, when they were in their 40s or so, say,
'I wish I'd given golf a shot,' or, 'I might have been a good driver
if I'd only tried; now it's too late,'" the San Luis Obispo driver
said. "I decided I didn't want to talk like that when I got older, so
I enrolled in the Skip Barber Racing School to see if I had what it
took."</LD>
<LD>   It was Bell's third stab at racing. His first, as a 13-year-old
karter, ended when he was hit by a trailer in a non-racing accident
and it took him a year to recover and rehabilitate. At 16 he tried
again, but when his parents divorced, his budget disappeared and so
did his focus.</LD>
<TE>   At 21 he was back. He will be 27 on April 19.</TE>
<TE>   "Failure is in not making a stab at it," he said. "But looking
back, I had a blind, somewhat naive attitude. I went straight to
driving school, did some amateur racing and after each race I seemed
more encouraged to keep on.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, my idea of racing was to jump into a Barber Dodge and
stand on it for 45 minutes and see if something good might happen.
Looking back, I am amazed at how little I knew about racing, and how
I got this far."</TE>
<TE>   Bell also uncovered another secret to racing--corporate
sponsorship.</TE>
<TE>   "I put together a package for part of the 1998 Barber Dodge
season, but that really put the pressure on me because after my sales
talk, my sponsors expected me to win, or be up front, or the money
would disappear."</TE>
<TE>   The next year, Bell finished third in that series and had enough
high finishes to move up to Indy Lights with Dorricott Racing in
2000. He finished second to Scott Dixon of New Zealand, then last
year became the first American champion in that series since Bryan
Herta in 1993 with six victories and a record eight poles in 12
races.</TE>
<TE>   Team owner Pat Patrick, one of the founders of CART, had drivers
Jimmy Vasser and Roberto Moreno, but when Vasser announced he was
switching to Bobby Rahal's team in 2002, Patrick began looking for a
replacement. He was impressed by Bell's having won Lights races on
oval, road, street and superspeedway courses. CART races on all of
those.</TE>
<TE>   As a test, Patrick invited Bell to run in CART's two European
races as a third driver.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty hectic," Bell said. "I landed on Sept. 11, which
was traumatic itself, and then qualifying got rained out in Germany
so I had to start in the rear because I had no points [for the
season]. It rained again in England, but in both races I did a lot of
passing and felt pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   He finished 13th in Germany and 12th in England after starting
27th each time.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, in the 28th Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach, he will be
making his fourth CART start in Patrick's No. 20 Reynard-Toyota--but
his first in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   In the season opener at Monterrey, Mexico, he didn't last the
first lap.</TE>
<TE>   "We had half a lap of glory," he said. "I started off ninth and,
going into about Turn 5, I ran out of room trying to pass Kenny
Brack. It was slippery and it just didn't pan out."</TE>
<TE>   The ensuing accident also took out Vasser, who was right behind
Bell.</TE>
<TE>   Prospects have come and gone in recent years as young American
drivers have sought success in CART. Bell is the latest and, at the
moment, the only one.</TE>
<TE>   The only other Americans in the 20-car field when practice starts
today will be Michael Andretti, 39, and Vasser, 36.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really glad to be back racing in Southern California, where
I've lived most of my life," Bell said. "It's also a home event for
Toyota, which makes it extra important. And I'll have lots of friends
and family attending. I just hope I can show them something, the way
I did last year when I won the Indy Lights race."</TE>

<KH>MORNING BRIEFING</KH>
<HD>It Would Be a Stretch for Daly to Wear Jacket</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before the Masters tournament started Thursday, Shaun Powell of
Newsday was rooting for John Daly: "The man has suffered enough. And
Tiger Woods has won enough. Come Sunday, in fact, there's only two
ways this tournament can have a special ending: If Tiger's wearing a
green jacket or Daly's squeezing into one. Since Jack Nicklaus isn't
playing, no other scenario really comes close.</LD>
<LD>   "No, please let it be Daly. Let us suckers for a comeback story
get our wish. Let him reach the greens with one mighty grip and a
rip. And if he can't win, let the Masters give him another excuse to
live responsibly so the game can appreciate his gift once again."</LD>
<LD>   For Powell to get his wish, Daly will have to play better than he
did in the first round, when he shot a two-over-par 74, leaving him
seven strokes behind leader Davis Love III.</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the record for consecutive top-10 finishes
in the Masters?</TE>
<TE>   Wily veteran: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle on
45-year-old Dodger reliever Jesse Orosco, who has had some success
against Barry Bonds:</TE>
<TE>   "Orosco is so old, he remembers pitching against Bobby Bonds. He
pitched against Willie McCovey, for God's sake.</TE>
<TE>   "He's so old that he still honors, pretty much, baseball's ancient
rule against fraternizing with the enemy. Orosco says he has chatted
a bit with Bonds over the years, but for the most part keeps his
distance.</TE>
<TE>   "'It's not that I'm trying to be unfriendly,' Orosco said, 'but
I've got a job to do.'"</TE>
<TE>   Easy decision: Forbes magazine has reported that major league
baseball teams had an operating profit of $75 million rather than the
$232-million operating loss that Commissioner Bud Selig complained
about to Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at baseball's history in this area," says Norman Chad
on America Online, "let's just say if I had to choose between putting
my trust with the Gambino crime family or a group of MLB team owners,
I'd be eating fagiole every night of the week."</TE>
<TE>   Why, of course: While erecting the equestrian site for the 2004
Olympics, workers in Greece unearthed the ruins of an ancient
brothel. Archeologist Michalis Sklavos says the bordello was part of
the temple devoted to the love goddess Aphrodite.</TE>
<TE>   "The priestesses offered extra love to the visitors," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Comment from Dwight Perry of the Seattle Times: "Which, if
tradition holds, included the IOC bid committee."</TE>
<TE>   Sophisticated kid: Joe Glass, director of media relations for the
Orlando Magic, told the Orlando Sentinel he took his 4-year-old son
to his first Little League practice. On the way, Max Glass asked his
dad, "Will there be media there?"</TE>
<TE>   Outraged: Bill Scheft in ESPN the Magazine: "Steve Spurrier is
furious. He saw the Redskins' schedule--no Vanderbilt."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Ben Hogan with 14.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Longtime Milwaukee Brewer broadcaster Bob Uecker is
still in love with the game. In an interview with Ron Rapoport of the
Chicago Sun-Times, he said: "Sometimes I sit in the booth when I'm
not working and just watch what's going on in the stands. It becomes
a part of your life. When the season starts, that's where you should
be. At the ballpark."</TE>

<LD>The Pepperdine men's volleyball team can clinch the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation title by defeating either Pacific tonight or
Stanford on Saturday. Both matches are at Firestone Fieldhouse at
Pepperdine, starting at 7 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Pacific handed Pepperdine (23-4 overall, 18-2 in league) its last
defeat, on Feb. 21. The Tigers (10-16, 8-12) are battling with Long
Beach State and Cal State Northridge for the final two positions in
the eight-team MPSF tournament. Stanford needs a victory to secure a
first-round home match.</LD>
<LD>   In other weekend events:</LD>
<TE>   Track and Field</TE>
<TE>   * Cal State Northridge and Brigham Young at UCLA, Drake Stadium,
11 a.m. (field events), 12:30 p.m. (running events), Saturday: The
Bruin women are ranked third in the nation behind defending NCAA
champion USC and Louisiana State, according to the Trackwire Online
poll. BYU is tied for sixth with Kansas State. Senior Tracy O'Hara
tied her season best in the pole vault with a mark of 14-11/4 at the
California-Arizona Challenge on Saturday. Sophomore Charles Ryan ran
a wind-aided time of 13.67 seconds to take the 110-meter high
hurdles. Ryan automatically qualified for the NCAA championships with
the time.</TE>
<TE>   Softball</TE>
<TE>   * Stanford at UCLA, 2 p.m., today; California at UCLA, 2 p.m.,
Saturday; California at UCLA, 1 p.m., Sunday: The second-ranked
Bruins, whose three-game losing streak knocked them from the top of
the national rankings, start a seven-game homestand against Pacific
10 Conference foes. No. 3 Stanford is led by outfielder Jessica
Mendoza and first baseman Sarah Beeson. No. 6 Cal is led by pitcher
Jocelyn Forest. Stacey Nuveman is batting .543 with 11 home runs and
42 runs batted in for the Bruins and teammate Natasha Watley is
batting .521 with 28 RBIs and 29 stolen bases.</TE>
<TE>   Women's Tennis</TE>
<TE>   * UC Irvine at Long Beach State, 11 a.m., Saturday: These teams
will meet for the Big West Conference regular-season title. Long
Beach (18-1, 6-0) is approaching its school record of 22 victories
set last season. The 49ers have won 16 in a row while Irvine (14-6,
6-0) has won 10 in a row. Irvine has won five in a row in the series,
including 4-3 last year at home.</TE>

<LD>Cal State Northridge opens a three-game home series against Cal Poly
San Luis Obispo today after playing 21 of its last 24 games on the
road.</LD>
<LD>   The Matadors won 15 of those road games, and their three-game
sweep at UC Riverside put them in a tie for second with Cal State
Fullerton in the Big West Conference.</LD>
<LD>   Northridge (24-11) and Fullerton (21-11) both are 5-1 in
conference, one game behind Long Beach State (21-9, 6-0).</LD>
<TE>   "We've played pretty well on the road," said Northridge Coach Mike
Batesole, whose team has won five in a row. "That's usually the sign
of a veteran club that knows how to stay together as a team."</TE>
<TE>   Northridge has gotten a big boost from sophomore third baseman
Ryan Haag at the top of its batting order. Haag not only has provided
the discipline Batesole wanted, but he has 12 hits in his last 19
at-bats. Haag hit a school-record four doubles Sunday in a 17-5 rout
of Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Bill Murphy is the ace of Northridge's pitching staff.
Murphy, a junior, is 7-1 with a 2.43 earned-run average. He has 90
strikeouts, which leads the Big West and is 26 more than UC Irvine's
Sean Tracey and Riverside's Chris Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy has gone at least seven innings in his last five starts,
including two complete games. Last Friday at Riverside, the Arlington
High graduate returned home to strike out 10 in nine innings and
defeat the Highlanders, 4-2.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden this year his stuff is better and it's more
refined," Batesole said. "He's got a nasty curveball but now he can
throw it for a strike."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC (19-14, 5-1) has won seven of eight heading into a key
three-game Pacific 10 Conference series at No. 2 Stanford beginning
tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford (22-7, 2-1) swept USC in a three-game series at Dedeaux
Field last month that didn't count in the Pac-10 standings. "If we
fancy ourselves a legitimate contender for a conference championship,
we have to play well," USC Coach Mike Gillespie said.</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Anthony Reyes (1-0, 1.38 ERA) will start for USC
tonight against Jeremy Guthrie (6-0, 3.08 ERA). Reyes, a preseason
All-American, is finally healthy after starting the season with a bad
right elbow. In his last start, Saturday against Oregon State, he
threw 87 pitches in five shutout innings.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting him to a point where we don't have to hawk every
pitch," Gillespie said. "He now knows that he's healthy and we know
that he's healthy."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans have been forced to overcome several injuries to
pitchers. Left-hander Fraser Dizard has a sore elbow and may not
return this season. Right-hander Brian Bannister, who might be ready
in two weeks, hasn't pitched at all after undergoing surgery on his
throwing elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Forced into the spotlight, freshmen Matt Chico (4-3, 5.24 ERA) and
J.P. Howell (3-3, 4.46 ERA) have been inconsistent. "You'd prefer not
to push a freshman into such a prominent role early but, for the most
part, they've done well," Gillespie said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pitching has powered Long Beach State (21-9, 6-0) into the Big
West lead. The 49ers rank fourth in the nation with a staff ERA of
2.87.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore left-hander Abe Alvarez (7-1, 2.22 ERA), along with
Northridge's Murphy and Fullerton's Wes Littleton, is making a case
for Big West pitcher of the year honors. Just as dominant has been
the Long Beach relief corps.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Chris Demaria has not allowed an earned run in 211/3
innings. Junior Carlos Muniz has given up only one run in 11 outings.
Freshman Neil Jamison has a 2.92 ERA in 10 appearances. Senior Josh
Alliston has the staff's highest ERA (4.50), but has two wins and
four saves.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers, who have won 14 of 17, play host to UC Santa Barbara
(15-19, 2-4) in a three-game conference series beginning today.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine and Loyola Marymount start a three-game West Coast
Conference series today. All three games are at LMU's Page Stadium.
Pepperdine (18-18, 7-3), which has won seven of nine, leads the Coast
Division by 11/2 games over Santa Clara.</TE>
<TE>   LMU (14-20, 7-4) leads San Diego by percentage points in the West
Division.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Murphy and Alvarez lead the Big West with seven victories. Alvarez
is second in ERA and Murphy is third.... Riverside (19-16, 0-6)
begins a three-game series at Sacramento State with both teams trying
to escape the cellar. The Highlanders are coming off an 8-0 loss to
San Diego State on Tuesday.... UCLA (14-20, 1-2) plays host to No. 23
Arizona State for three games this weekend. Bruin senior Adam Berry
leads the Pac-10 in home runs with 14 and is fourth in RBIs with
37.... Fullerton starts a three-game series tonight at Pacific....
Mike Weathers won his 300th game as a head coach in Long Beach's 5-3
win over Loyola on Tuesday. He's in his first year with the 49ers
after nine as an assistant to former Long Beach coach Dave Snow, but
he spent two years at Utah and nine at Chapman College.</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers flew from San Francisco to San Diego after beating the
Giants on Thursday, 4-3, but unlike most trips in the last decade or
two, there were no players' wives or immediate family on the flight.</LD>
<LD>   Concerned that the Dodgers' large traveling parties were becoming
a distraction, General Manager Dan Evans, with the blessing of
several veteran players, has ended a long-standing team policy that
allowed wives, fiancees and immediate family members over 14 to
travel on team flights.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers have designated three family trips this season, one
each in May, June and August.</LD>
<TE>   "I had a meeting with several players in spring training, and we
talked about how we could be as focused as possible with the fewest
distractions," Evans said. "I don't know if this will translate into
wins, but it will help the team focus better. I heard a couple of
rumblings [about the decision], but it wasn't that much of an issue."</TE>
<TE>   Few teams allow relatives on charter flights, but the Dodgers, in
a tradition started under former owner Peter O'Malley, have been more
family-oriented than most.</TE>
<TE>   But traveling parties surged past 80 last September--they're
normally around 55--with the team in the midst of a heated division
race, and one charter was so full of luggage there wasn't room for
the team's equipment, which had to be shipped later.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like, 'Come see America with the Dodgers,'" first baseman
Eric Karros said. "It wasn't that [privileges] were abused, but we
got into a situation with new owners, new management, where liberties
were extended. The bottom line is to focus on the field, and we want
to provide an environment everyone is comfortable with."</TE>
<TE>   Reserve catcher Chad Krueter said the change "was a little bit
disappointing," but he didn't object to it. "You respect it because
that's their policy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   New left fielder Brian Jordan, who spent the last three seasons in
Atlanta--which didn't allow relatives on any flights--strongly
endorsed the move.</TE>
<TE>   "You wonder why the Braves win so much, and I think some of it
comes from chemistry, that togetherness they build over the year,"
Jordan said. "Come September, you should just focus on baseball.
Apparently, it wasn't that way here. It was the family-and-friends
program. I'm not against your family meeting you on the road, but the
team plane should be the team plane. You shouldn't have to worry
about having to watch what you say."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, who has been part of the intense Brave-Met rivalry, got a
taste of the Dodger-Giant rivalry Thursday. It had the distinct
flavor of barley and hops.</TE>
<TE>   When Jordan went to the warning track to field Jeff Kent's
sacrifice fly in the third inning, a fan in the left-field bleachers
doused him with beer.</TE>
<TE>   "And it was the whole cup," Jordan said. "He wasted a, what, $6
cup of beer? I'm hoping security is bopping him on the head right
now. But, hey, it's a great rivalry, Dodgers against the Giants. Fans
enjoy throwing beer on you. You respect fans who get on you, but
throwing beer, that's not the family game of baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Then again ...</TE>
<TE>   "I hope they douse the other team when we go to L.A.," Jordan
said.</TE>

in his first Grapefruit League start before struggling the rest of
the spring, so it's important for him to maintain his momentum with a
solid effort tonight. The Padres are coming off a three-game sweep of
Arizona in which they held the Diamondbacks to three runs and one hit
in 20 at-bats with runners in scoring position. San Diego first
baseman Phil Nevin, a former Angel, is off to a good start, batting
.387 with two homers and six RBIs.</TE>

<HD>Gagne Clearly Close-Minded</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Right-hander successfully navigates ninth-inning
crisis as Dodgers defeat Giants, 4-3.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>While Manager Jim Tracy continues to cling to the notion that the
Dodgers are employing a closer by committee, right-hander Eric Gagne
clearly cemented his role as the team's last-inning stopper Thursday
afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Facing his toughest relief test yet, Gagne struck out Jeff Kent
and retired Reggie Sanders on a fly ball to center field with runners
on first and third in the ninth inning to close out a dramatic, 4-3
come-from-behind victory over the San Francisco Giants before 40,934
in Pacific Bell Park.</LD>
<LD>   "I was looking for a little bit of an answer; I felt I was going
to find something out in game nine of the season today," Tracy said
of his decision to both use Gagne and let him face Barry Bonds with
the tying run on base. "I wanted to see how he responded. It was a
one-run game, there were men on base, and he had to make pitches. I'd
say he responded very nicely."</LD>
<TE>   Mark Grudzielanek and goat-turned-hero Hiram Bocachica hit
back-to-back home runs to key a three-run rally in the top of the
eighth, and the Giants pulled to within 4-3 on Benito Santiago's RBI
double off reliever Paul Quantrill in the bottom of the eighth,
setting up an intriguing ninth inning of decisions for Tracy.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne retired Tsuyoshi Shinjo on a leadoff grounder to third, but
David Bell lined a single to left. Up stepped Bonds, the National
League's reigning most valuable player who already has five home runs
and 12 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger left-hander Jesse Orosco, who has held Bonds to a .130
average and got him to ground out in a key eighth-inning at-bat
Tuesday night, was warm in the bullpen, but as Tracy strolled to the
mound for a visit, he decided to stick with Gagne, who has held Bonds
to a .154 average and Kent, the Giants' cleanup batter, to a .176
average.</TE>
<TE>   Catcher Paul Lo Duca couldn't handle Gagne's first two pitches to
Bonds, a low changeup and a high-and-away fastball, and Lo Duca's two
passed balls allowed Bell to take third. Tracy ordered Gagne to
intentionally walk Bonds and pitch to Kent, the 2000 NL MVP.</TE>
<TE>   Kent swung and missed at a changeup and a curve, fouled off a
96-mph fastball and swung through an 88-mph changeup for strike
three. Sanders, who hit 33 home runs for Arizona last season, hit
Gagne's next pitch to deep center field, but Marquis Grissom, who
knocked in the eventual winning run with an RBI single in the eighth
and doubled and scored on Shawn Green's single in the sixth, made the
catch near the warning track, giving Gagne his third save.</TE>
<TE>   "He showed some heart today; he showed he wants to be the closer,"
Dodger left fielder Brian Jordan said of Gagne. "He could have easily
gotten nervous and thrown bad pitches, but he went right after those
guys like nothing was bothering him."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne, who was converted from a starter to reliever in the final
two weeks of spring training, relished the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to face Barry Bonds, that's what you play baseball for,
to be in this kind of game," Gagne said. "It's a big adrenaline rush.
It's one inning, it's all up to you, you're facing two MVPs in Bonds
and Kent. It's a big learning process for me, but I felt relaxed on
the mound. I didn't panic. This is big for me, it's big for the team.
It's a huge confidence boost."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne has always thrown hard, but he has better location and has
complemented his fastball with two improved off-speed pitches, a
changeup and a curve. He also seems to have the mental makeup, a
have-no-fear approach that is a prerequisite for the closing role.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's pretty well cut out for that job," Bell said. "I've
faced him as a starter and a closer. He throws real hard with good
movement. Those are the things you want in a closer."</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca described Gagne's stuff as "devastating." Andy Ashby, who
allowed two runs and four hits in five innings Thursday, said Gagne's
repertoire is "nasty, some of the best stuff I've ever seen." Orosco
said Gagne "is going to be our closer ... he's the right guy for the
job."</TE>
<TE>   It's clear to just about everyone in the Dodger clubhouse that
Gagne is their ninth-inning hammer ... except to Tracy.</TE>
<TE>   "Until I decide to name a closer definitively, I reserve the right
to use who I want in that role," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   So, what does Gagne have to do to convince Tracy he's the Dodger
closer?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," Tracy said. "I'll sleep on that."</TE>
<TE>   Very soundly.</TE>

<HD>Quick Redemption for Bocachica</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: One day after baserunning blunder, he has a key
pinch-hit homer--his first hit of the season--in victory over the
Giants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Dodger infielder Hiram Bocachica said he spent a sleepless night
replaying his "stupid mistake that cost us a game," punishing himself
for a baserunning gaffe against the San Francisco Giants.</LD>
<LD>   Noticing that Bocachica needed a boost, Manager Jim Tracy put his
arm around the dejected young player during batting practice Thursday
and told him it was time to move forward.</LD>
<LD>   "Wednesday night had come and gone, and we couldn't do a thing
about it, so let's just move on," Tracy said. "I think he moved on."</LD>
<TE>   Bocachica rebounded quickly, hitting a key pinch-hit home run in a
three-run eighth inning as the Dodgers rallied for a 4-3 victory
Thursday, taking two of three from the Giants at Pacific Bell Park.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Grudzielanek homered to start the eighth against Giant
starter Kirk Rueter and Bocachica, batting for reliever Omar Daal,
followed with a shot to left on a 3-and-1 count. The seldom-used
player chased Rueter with his first hit of the season, energizing his
teammates less than 24 hours after failing to score from second on a
double to center in the seventh inning of a 2-1 loss.</TE>
<TE>   On returning to the dugout, Bocachica was greeted with
congratulatory slaps on the back and high-fives that were even more
effusive than usual for this newly close-knit bunch. Redemption came
fast for Bocachica, though it seemed like an eternity to him.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a long, long night," he said. "You just sit there and you
keep thinking about the situation, about costing the team a game we
should have won, and it's real hard. But that's the way the game is.
One day you make a mistake, and the next thing you know you're in a
situation where you can help the team.</TE>
<TE>   "Trace came up to me today and really made me feel better, just
saying how it was in the past and he still had confidence in me. He
told me something good was going to happen and I believed him. I'm
just glad it happened so soon after what happened the other night."</TE>
<TE>   With one out Wednesday and the Dodgers trailing, 1-0, in the
seventh, Tracy replaced Eric Karros, who doubled to open the inning,
with Bocachica. Tracy figured the speedy Bocachica had a better
chance than Karros of scoring on a hit.</TE>
<TE>   Adrian Beltre blasted a double off the center-field wall, but
Bocachica inexplicably went back to tag up although it was clear
center fielder Tsuyoshi Shinjo, sprinting with his back to the field,
had no chance of catching the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Shinjo made a textbook play on the carom and throw to hold
Bocachica at third. He was stranded there and the Dodgers had wasted
another of many opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "I was ... I don't know what I was thinking," Bocachica said.
"It's very tough because I'm a young player, this is only my second
year in the big leagues, so I always have to do the right thing when
I get a chance. Any time a manager tells you not to worry about a
mistake like that it helps you out. You're thinking that maybe they
don't trust you, so it was a relief.</TE>
<TE>   "This team this season is ... we all stick together. It doesn't
matter if you make a mistake; we're always here for each other.
That's what happened [Wednesday] night. I made a mistake, but
everybody just tried to pick me up. That means a lot to know you've
got that type of support behind you."</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek also has leaned on his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   He expressed frustration in spring training about having been
dropped from second to eighth in the batting order, and is still
struggling with the change. However, he said he's determined to move
forward.</TE>
<TE>   "You try to perform as best you can as a professional," said
Grudzielanek, whose homer ignited the first multiple-run inning
against the Giants this season. "You don't necessarily have to agree
with what the manager does all the time; it's just one of those
things where you go out and you do your best.</TE>
<TE>   "There's 24 other guys on the team who battle for you and are
there for you through thick and thin. That's what it's all about.
Wherever I'm at in the lineup, I have to try keep my head on straight
and do what I can for the team. Look at what Boca did. Something
happened the other day that probably shouldn't have happened, but he
kept his head. That's outstanding."</TE>

<LD>Like every other team, the Mighty Ducks were thinking playoffs at the
beginning of the season. But after a lackluster start in which they
won only 13 of 45 games, Coach Bryan Murray set a new goal, revising
expectations as a market analyst would for a downtrodden stock.</LD>
<LD>   On the day of the Ducks' Jan. 11 game at Minnesota, Murray met
with the team after the morning skate.</LD>
<LD>   "We were having a bit of a struggle," he said. "I looked at the
schedule and said as heavy as the schedule is [with high-caliber
teams] at the end of the year, that we could play at a .500 level
down the stretch."</LD>
<TE>   The turnaround didn't exactly start that night: The Ducks tied the
Wild, 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   But including that game, they have met Murray's revised
expectations, going 16-16-3.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hoping obviously we'd make a nice run [but] I knew we had
to have a realistic objective," he said. "There's no sense in saying
we had to play .750 over the balance of the schedule. You had to be
realistic over what the team could reach at that point.</TE>
<TE>   "From mid-January, I started to sense these guys started to
believe in themselves a little bit. In our training camp next year,
we'll talk about the difference in the year, the first and second
half."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks (29-40-8-3) are on a 2-0-1 run, with games remaining
against Colorado tonight and the Kings on Sunday. The Ducks are 0-2-1
against Colorado and 0-3-1 against the Kings.</TE>

<HD>Sellers and Oxley Try to Land a 1-2 Punch</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LEXINGTON, Ky.</DL>
<LD>The boys, sixth-graders at the Bryant School in Tulsa, Okla., walked
to school together every day. One of them was Johnny Sellers, who was
a year old when his father, struggling to support a family in the
aftermath of the Depression, moved the family from Los Angeles to
Oklahoma. The other boy was John Oxley, whose father owned polo
ponies.</LD>
<LD>   By the time Sellers and Oxley were juniors at Will Rogers High,
Oxley was thinking about studying geology at the University of
Oklahoma, the better to get into the family oil business.</LD>
<LD>   With the permission of his parents, who insisted that he get his
high school diploma, the 16-year-old Sellers left Tulsa for Kentucky,
where he hoped to become a jockey.</LD>
<TE>   Sellers became more than just a jockey. He rode the winners of
2,787 races, among them 1961 Kentucky Derby winner Carry Back.</TE>
<TE>   Oxley got his geology degree, then became president of Oxley
Petroleum.</TE>
<TE>   More than 40 years later, they met again at Gulfstream Park.
Oxley, a few years away from winning the 2001 Derby with Monarchos,
assumed--incorrectly--that Shane Sellers, a leading jockey, was
Johnny Sellers' son, and they got a big laugh out of that. Sellers,
who had become a bloodstock agent--first in Southern California, more
recently in Florida--suggested that he might one day sell Oxley a
good horse.</TE>
<TE>   That day came last December. A smallish but intriguing colt had
won all but one of his five starts, and Sellers learned the colt was
for sale. Sellers had seen the horse, Booklet, win by 41/2 lengths in
a two-turn race at Calder Race Course in Miami. He called Booklet's
trainer, Steve Klesaris, who also owned a piece of the horse, with a
preliminary inquiry. Then Sellers faxed Oxley: "I have a colt that
might be your next Derby horse."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, they talked.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Jack that the colt didn't have tremendous size, but he had
a lot of stamina and could get a distance," Sellers said.</TE>
<TE>   Oxley, who had bought an unraced 2-year-old Monarchos for
$170,000, inspected the pedigree on Booklet. Represented in the
bloodlines were some Hall of Fame horses, among them Triple Crown
winners War Admiral and Count Fleet.</TE>
<TE>   On New Year's Day, Oxley wrote a check for $1 million and Booklet
was his. The son of Notebook and Crafty Bobbie could give his owner a
rare second consecutive Derby victory, but first the colt must get
past the $750,000 Toyota Blue Grass on Saturday at Keeneland, where
his rivalry with Harlan's Holiday continues. Only four other
horses--Azillion, Bob's Image, Ocean Sound and Straight Gin--are
entered in the 11/8-mile race.</TE>
<TE>   Booklet and Harlan's Holiday have raced three times this year at
Gulfstream. Booklet won two stakes at shorter distances before
Harlan's Holiday won the 11/8-mile Florida Derby. Booklet, caught in
an early speed duel, finished fourth.</TE>
<TE>   The Harlan's Holiday-Booklet rivalry is reminiscent of another
series, between Jack Price's Carry Back and Fred Hooper's Crozier,
which bubbled over at the 1961 Kentucky Derby. Crozier and Braulio
Baeza led Carry Back by 41/2 lengths with an eighth of a mile left,
but Sellers' cheaply bred colt rallied past his nemesis for a
three-quarter-length victory.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the greatest race of my life," Sellers said.</TE>
<TE>   John Oxley, watching on TV, was excited for his schoolboy friend.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just a dreamer when it came to the Kentucky Derby then,"
said Oxley, who bought his first horse 11 years later.</TE>
<TE>   His father, Thomas Oxley, had given Sellers a job at the polo
stable, which was the future jockey's introduction to horses. Sellers
also won the Preakness with Carry Back, but they finished seventh in
the Belmont and missed the Triple Crown.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Price, who bred, owned and trained Carry Back, used Sellers
25 times on his colt and they won 13 of those races.</TE>
<TE>   Sellers and that earlier Jack in his life, Oxley, were a team
before Booklet. In Tulsa, Sellers remembered, they were featured in a
school play.</TE>
<TE>   "I sang a song," Sellers said. "I was terrible. But Jack--he was
very intelligent, always very articulate--he read a poem and he was
very good."</TE>
<TE>   Oxley was flattered that Sellers remembered. "Yes, it was a poem,"
Oxley said. "I ... think it was called 'I Am Old Glory.'"</TE>
<TE>   The walk to school, however, is a bone of contention.</TE>
<TE>   "Jack's younger sister, Mary Jane, walked with us," Sellers said.
"I guess it was about a mile."</TE>
<TE>   Oxley thought for a moment.</TE>
<TE>   "More like two miles is the way I remember it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Derby, of course, is a mile and a quarter. Should Booklet win
May 4 in Louisville, there'll be complete agreement over that
distance.</TE>

<HD>Potvin Plays 70th Game in Goal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>VANCOUVER, Canada</DL>
<LD>King Coach Andy Murray was true to his word when he said goaltender
Felix Potvin would be a workhorse.</LD>
<LD>   Potvin made his 70th appearance of the season in Thursday night's
5-2 loss to the Vancouver Canucks, matching Rogie Vachon's
24-year-old club record for games played by a goaltender.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought he would play a lot because I'm a guy that believes you
play your No. 1 guy," Murray said before the game. "Ultimately, I
think you're a better team when everybody knows who the No. 1 guy is.</LD>
<TE>   "The bottom line is, our players expect Felix to be in there and
when you're trying to tell your team, 'We're doing everything we can
to win the game,' and you don't have your No. 1 goalie in there,
you're sending false messages."</TE>
<TE>   Murray said he is not worried about overworking Potvin.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been an interesting year because of the Olympic break;
10 days to get re-energized, refocused," the coach said. "He hasn't
had a problem with [the workload]. I think it's all a matter of the
coach and the goalie communicating and knowing how the goalie is
feeling.</TE>
<TE>   "And he feels great. He wants to be in there playing."</TE>
<TE>   Potvin, who played in all 23 games last season after being traded
from the Canucks, has sat out only 10 this season. Thursday's start
was his 20th in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "I always said that's what I was used to earlier in my career and
that's how I like it," said the goaltender, who played in a
career-high 74 games for the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1996-97
season.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Smolinski's goal Monday night, scored into an empty net, was
his first since Jan. 17, when he scored into an empty net against the
Buffalo Sabres.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a goal; I'll take it," he said. "I don't care how it came."</TE>
<TE>   Right wing Steve Heinze, benched for four consecutive games and
without a goal in his last 26, was back in the lineup, replacing Ken
Belanger.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel he gives us another dimension ... maybe a little more
balance offensively," Murray said. "We have a feeling he'll be real
hungry to play. I think he's tired of playing defense in practice as
the extra forward. Our feeling is he'll give us a strong game. He's a
veteran. His experience should be valuable for us."</TE>

<HD>Kings Can't Master Trick</HD>
<DH>Hockey: L.A. fails to secure a playoff berth as Naslund
scores three goals in Vancouver's 5-2 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VANCOUVER, Canada</DL>
<LD>Thursday was a lost cause for the Kings.</LD>
<LD>   They lost to the Vancouver Canucks, 5-2, in front of a sellout
crowd of 18,422 in General Motors Place, giving up four goals in the
last 24 minutes, three by Canuck captain Markus Naslund for his third
hat trick of the season.</LD>
<LD>   They lost a chance to clinch a Western Conference playoff berth.</LD>
<TE>   They lost all hope of winning the Pacific Division championship,
the San Jose Sharks wrapping up their first division title while
flying home from St. Louis after losing to the Blues, 4-1, and giving
the Kings an opening.</TE>
<TE>   They lost their winning streak, which ended after three games.</TE>
<TE>   What was not lost was their road winless streak, which reached
five games. They're 0-4-1 outside Staples Center since March 18.</TE>
<TE>   Also not lost, however, was the Kings' ability to control their
own fate. They'll still qualify for the playoffs if they earn a point
in either of their final two games, Saturday at San Jose or Sunday
against the Mighty Ducks at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Or, failing that, they'll make it in if the Edmonton Oilers lose
or tie in either of their last two games, tonight against the Calgary
Flames at Edmonton, Canada, and Sunday against the Minnesota Wild at
St. Paul, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   The second option, however, holds little appeal to the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "If we back into the playoffs, we're not going to do any good when
we get there," defenseman Aaron Miller said after the Kings had lost
for the second time in three games against the Canucks over the last
18 days, the other ending in a tie. "We've got to play better, and
we've got two more games to do it."</TE>
<TE>   A tie or overtime loss would have been enough to nail down a
playoff berth for the Kings, but they wanted to defeat the Canucks.</TE>
<TE>   "Any game that we're in and it's the latter stages of the game,
you want to keep your guard up and be smart," Coach Andy Murray said
before the game. "But if you sit back, that's usually when bad things
happen, so we could never go in with the mind-set that we're playing
for a tie. We play for the win all the way."</TE>
<TE>   The surging Canucks, meanwhile, had no other choice.</TE>
<TE>   Unbeaten in their last eight games, the Canucks may be the hottest
team in the league with a 12-2-1 record since March 10, but the only
way they could guarantee themselves a playoff spot was to win
Thursday night and again Saturday night against the Flames.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, they'd probably need outside help and, as the Kings
could have told them, you can't always count on the kindness of
strangers.</TE>
<TE>   After defeating the Dallas Stars, 3-0, on Monday night at Staples
Center, the Kings could have clinched a playoff spot without playing
another game but the Canucks and Oilers kept within striking distance
of the Kings by winning their games Tuesday and Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday night, the Kings' deficit was only 2-1 with less than
eight minutes to play, but the Canucks broke the game open after a
neutral-zone pass by King defenseman Mathieu Schneider caromed off a
door jam along the boards and bounced right onto Naslund's stick.</TE>
<TE>   The Canuck scoring leader carried the puck into the King zone and
wristed a shot past goaltender Felix Potvin with 7:37 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Naslund scored his 38th goal with 3:11 to play, making the score
4-1 and then, after Adam Deadmarsh scored for the Kings with 2:31
remaining, added an empty-net goal with 17 seconds left, the
appreciative crowd littering the ice with hats.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a great player," Murray said of Naslund, "but you don't give
him the opportunities we gave him. We laid a couple right on his
stick."</TE>
<TE>   Artem Chubarov brought the crowd to its feet with 9:14 to play in
the first period, scoring his fifth goal of the season to give the
Canucks a 1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Less than 21/2 minutes into the second, Mikko Eloranta pulled the
Kings even, intercepting a clearing attempt and scoring his ninth
goal unassisted on a shot from the top of the slot.</TE>
<TE>   But after Todd Bertuzzi scored his 36th goal on a shot from the
left faceoff circle with 3:53 to play in the period, the Canucks led
for good.</TE>

<HD>This Laker Win Looks Different</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Uniforms are special, so are O'Neal and
Bryant in 96-83 victory over Timberwolves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By next weekend, when the real defense of their two NBA titles
starts, the Lakers will have played their final five regular-season
games against Western Conference playoff teams, maybe enough to get
them in the mood.</LD>
<LD>   While they ultimately will not quite have found the momentum they
wished for, they might at least have convinced themselves that it's
close enough.</LD>
<LD>   Lindsey Hunter thought it over before the Lakers defeated the
Minnesota Timberwolves, 96-83, Thursday night at Staples Center, and
drew only one conclusion: "The better Shaq feels, the better we'll
be."</LD>
<TE>   On a night the Lakers honored their past, they moved a bit closer
to their immediate future. With legendary center George Mikan sitting
nearby, Shaquille O'Neal scored 32 points and took nine rebounds,
Kobe Bryant scored 28 points, and the Lakers held their eighth
consecutive opponent under 100 points.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you get wins it makes things feel a whole lot better,"
said Derek Fisher, who scored 12 of his 14 points in the second half.
"We're not playing perfect basketball, but we're improved in a lot of
areas."</TE>
<TE>   A Laker loss or a Sacramento win in the next five days will mean
the inevitable, that the Lakers would not have home-court advantage
for the Western Conference finals against the Kings, if it comes to
that.</TE>
<TE>   There are other things at stake. As it stands, the Lakers would
play the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round and then, perhaps,
the Dallas-Seattle winner in the second. The Lakers have 23 losses
and Mavericks have 24, the latest Thursday night to the Houston
Rockets by blowing a 20-point lead. San Antonio also has 24 losses.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers own the head-to-head tiebreaker against Dallas and San
Antonio, with three games left--at Portland and at home against
Seattle and Sacramento. The Spurs own the tiebreaker against the
Mavericks.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want to win the games," Bryant said, "and maintain our
three seed."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers won their 56th game, as many as they had last season,
and their 13th in a row at home. They won primarily with defense--the
Timberwolves missed two-thirds of their shots, more than a few
without hands in their faces--particularly critical when the Lakers
didn't make a shot for nearly seven minutes to start the fourth
quarter. Minnesota, however, came no closer than seven points, though
it forced O'Neal off the bench for six unplanned minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "The simplicity of the game is coming back to where it was last
year," Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers wore the old Minneapolis Laker road uniforms, light
blue with gold trim and MPLS. on the front, an abbreviation you'd
figure to find on your luggage tag.</TE>
<TE>   In a photo shoot before the game, Mikan suggested to O'Neal that
45 points would be good. "Forty-five?," O'Neal said. "OK.
Forty-five."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, bothered by his arthritic toe, limped out of the arena but
smiled at Mikan's request.</TE>
<TE>   "I should have had 45," he said. "They didn't send me to the line
enough."</TE>
<TE>   In the spirit of something different, a handful of Lakers wore
gold headbands. Samaki Walker donned one. Fisher, of course. And
Bryant, pulled down over his jaunty afro, around his ears, a look
maybe never seen before.</TE>
<TE>   "The head band, I don't know," he said afterward. "I'll have to
see what it looks like."</TE>
<TE>   In the locker room, an hour before the game, Bryant modeled his
Carolina-ish blues and said, "I love it. I love it. I love it. I like
the cut. Brings out my buffness."</TE>
<TE>   He laughed and drew up a bulge in his right biceps.</TE>
<TE>   Like that, in two short ceremonies--before the game and at the
half--the Lakers added five NBA championships.</TE>
<TE>   "A franchise," public address announcer Lawrence Tanter called
before the Laker introductions, "with 13 NBA titles ..." and the
place hummed its approval.</TE>
<TE>   They wore it well, particularly on defense.</TE>
<TE>   After giving up 120 and 112 points in consecutive games in wintry
Minneapolis, the Lakers moved around a little more and defended the
Minnesota jump shooters. Kevin Garnett missed eight of 11 field-goal
attempts in the first half, when the Timberwolves shot 31% (13 for
42) overall, and finished with 18 points.</TE>

<HD>Love Those Changes</HD>
<DH>Golf: Davis Love leads by a shot with 67, but only six
players break 70 on a day with perfect scoring conditions at Augusta.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AUGUSTA, Ga.</DL>
<LD>It was only one day, one round, 18 holes, but if you wanted to
project a winner at the Masters, feel free to start right now. The
course won. That would be the beefed-up Augusta National and it's
exactly the result officials hoped for once they fired up the
chainsaws and bulldozers to start the makeover last June.</LD>
<LD>   At the end of a long, gray opening day Thursday, Davis Love III
stood at the front of the class with a five-under-par 67, worth a
one-shot lead over Sergio Garcia and Angel Cabrera. But there were
only three other scores in the 60s--Phil Mickelson, Retief Goosen and
Padraig Harrington had 69s.</LD>
<LD>   We should be looking at it this way: It counts as an upset when
you have a total of six rounds in the 60s on a day with no wind and
greens softer than a down pillow. By comparison, there were 14 on
Thursday last year.</LD>
<TE>   How Love managed to work his way to the top is at least halfway
surprising because he has missed the cut his last two times out. The
leader has a slightly different spin on it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not shocked the way I played today," he said. "I'm shocked at
the way I've played the last four weeks, because I've really been
swinging much better."</TE>
<TE>   Love had five birdies and not a single bogey, although he came
close at the 18th when he hit his drive into the trees. From there,
Love smacked a high draw, carried the front bunker and landed the
ball on the green.</TE>
<TE>   He made par and gave thanks to Augusta National for an acute sense
of good timing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to catch it on a calm day and a damp day," he said. "I
don't know if they will get it back to what they had Sunday and
Monday, which may be good for all of us that they don't get it back
to that."</TE>
<TE>   At least for one day, the prediction that long-ball hitters would
dominate turned out to be true. Nearly every player at par or better
is a bomber with the exception of Brad Faxon and Justin Leonard, and
they both have great short games and can putt.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods leads a group of 11 at two-under 70 that also includes
Ernie Els, Jose Maria Olazabal, Darren Clarke, Vijay Singh, Nick
Price, Miguel Jimenez, Scott Verplank, Jesper Parnevik, Chris DiMarco
and Leonard.</TE>
<TE>   Woods spent a busy day wringing his 70 out of the place and felt
that was about all he could have hoped for.</TE>
<TE>   "I just kind of grinded my way around the golf course, made a
couple of mistakes here and there, but just hung in there and stayed
very patient," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He was three under after five holes, but didn't get another birdie
until the par-five 15th when he hit a four-iron second shot just over
the green. He also birdied the 17th and saved par at the 18th after
his three-wood off the tee went left into some trees.</TE>
<TE>   Anything at par or a little better would have been fine, he said,
so he was far from disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "The first round of a major championship, you don't want to put
yourself out of the tournament," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Love has been in the driver's seat before, only not that often. It
was the third time in his 17-year career that he has led the first
round of a major. The other times were the 1997 PGA Championship at
Winged Foot (when he co-led with John Daly and went on to his only
major title) and the 1999 Masters (when he co-led with Price, Scott
McCarron and Brandel Chamblee).</TE>
<TE>   No one could argue that the big hitters had the biggest days in
the first round. For instance, Cabrera led the European Tour in
driving last year. And Garcia was No. 1 on the PGA Tour in total
driving last year. Garcia dropped out of a share for the lead when he
made a bogey at the 18th, but that's going to happen sometimes, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   What he would rather talk about is how far the ball goes when it's
on the tee--and whether that's a good thing. The answer: Of course.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, the longer you hit it, the better," he said. "But
you've still got to hit it straight. You don't want to be coming up
to these greens from the trees.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, if you hit it long, of course it's an advantage."</TE>
<TE>   The average score Thursday was 74.118, or basically two over. Last
year, the average first-round score was 73.161, led by DiMarco's 65.
There were 32 under-par scores in the first round a year ago, 21 on
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The ninth hole, which at 460 yards is 30 yards longer, was the
hardest hole Thursday, averaging 4.352. Last year, it was the only
10th hardest. The other big change was at 18, where it played 60
yards longer at 460. Last year, it was 13th hardest in the first
round at 4.014 and this year it was fifth, at 4.261.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, at one under was Greg Norman. The 47-year-old Shark,
who got into the tournament with a special invitation, three-putted
the last hole for a bogey. Like Woods, Norman wanted to shoot
something around par and stay close to the leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "The back nine is not giving up as many birdies as it used to give
up," said Norman, who has had his share of close calls at the
Masters.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know whether there is any such fact as something owes you
something. There's a lot way to go yet. There's a lot of water to go
over the dam between now and Sunday night."</TE>

<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AUGUSTA, Ga.</DL>
<LD>Arnold Palmer, 72, said he will play his last round at the Masters
today. Palmer, a four-time champion, shot an 89 in the first round
Thursday in his 48th consecutive Masters.</LD>
<LD>   Palmer last made the cut at the Masters in 1984, when he tied for
36th.</LD>
<LD>   "Tomorrow will be it," Palmer said. "That's it. I don't want to
get a letter."</LD>
<TE>   Palmer was referring to the letters sent to Billy Casper, Doug
Ford and Gay Brewer by Augusta National Chairman Hootie Johnson,
advising them their playing days at the Masters had ended.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer last played the U.S. Open in 1994 at Oakmont and played his
last British Open in 1995 at St. Andrews. He also played his last PGA
Championship in 1994 at Southern Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, who was on the edge of the first green in two and then
four-putted, realized his game is no longer competitive.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer said he will limit his playing schedule to possible Senior
PGA Tour events and a selected few others.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer also threw his support to putting a limit on the technology
of golf balls.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to really think about slowing the golf ball down," he
said. "I don't think you can stop much technology on golf clubs."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer said he would enjoy it if the players in the Masters used a
golf ball like the one he used when he won in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   Said Palmer: "Then see what would happen, because the technology
that has been put into the golf ball is fantastic."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods was asked if he could imagine himself playing the
Masters at Palmer's age of 72.</TE>
<TE>   Said Woods: "I hope I'm on this side of the grass at 72."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Charles Howell shot a two-over 74, but may have made more of a
splash with his stylish slacks--white with a green stripe. What did
he look like? All Howell needed was a French horn.</TE>
<TE>   "I love these pants," Howell said. "These pants fit my personality
and I can take the grief for it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sam Snead, 89, participating in his 62nd consecutive Masters, hit
the first ball in the usual ceremony, but it didn't go quite where he
aimed. The ball traveled about 100 yards and to the right, where it
struck a spectator in the face and broke his glasses.</TE>
<TE>   The fan, who was not identified, was treated for a cut on his
nose.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scott Hoch was not happy, which isn't all that unusual. Hoch, who
bogeyed the last two holes and shot 76, said his problems had nothing
to do with the changes to the golf course.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the mud on the ball," Hoch said. "It cost me at least five
shots."</TE>
<TE>   Hoch also had another complaint: "I don't know why they played the
tees all the way back [and] into the wind."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former winners Tommie Aaron, 65, and Charles Coody, 64, were the
first group off the tee, right after honorary starter Snead hit the
first ball and the first spectator. Aaron had a 79 and Coody an 82
and both had adventurous rounds.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron bogeyed seven of the first nine holes, then double bogeyed
the 10th, but he played the last seven holes in two under. Coody
bogeyed five of the last six.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Craig Perks, had one of those days in his debut at the Masters--a
nine-over 81. Perks, who had a dramatic victory at the Players
Championship, said it was a long day.</TE>
<TE>   "It got worse and worse," Perks said. "It's Augusta. At this
level, you can't play poorly. I'll forget it. I'll learn from it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hal Sutton withdrew because of a pulled muscle on his right side.</TE>

<LD>What is the Indy Racing League's most popular driver of 2001 doing
this weekend at a CART race in Long Beach?</LD>
<LD>   For one thing, Sarah Fisher is driving in the Toyota pro-celebrity
race Saturday. For another, she is looking for a ride.</LD>
<LD>   Fisher, who raced the last two years as a contract driver for
Derrick Walker in the IRL, was released from her contract last week
and is now hoping she can continue her career with another team.
Chances are slim, however, as the sponsorship market has shrunk.</LD>
<TE>   Not only is Fisher, a second-place finisher at Homestead, Fla.,
and a front-row starter at Richmond last year, out of an IRL ride, so
is Greg Ray, the 1999 IRL champion and 2000 Indy 500 pole winner. The
CART picture is nearly as bleak, with Roberto Moreno, a winner last
year at Vancouver, on the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher, 20, is one of three professional drivers who'll compete in
the 10-lap race against a variety of entertainment celebrities. The
others are Tommy Kendall, a former Trans-Am champion who won the pro
category in 1997, and Danica Patrick, a Formula Ford driver .</TE>
<TE>   Among the celebs is actor Patrick Stewart, Captain Picard of "Star
Trek: The Next Generation," who recognized Fisher at a practice
session.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really excited that Patrick Stewart knew who I was," she
said . "He kept complimenting my driving abilities throughout the
weekend we spent practicing at Willow Springs. My mom, who is a
Trekkie at heart, was even more excited when I phoned her about my
new friend."</TE>
<TE>   Fisher was left unemployed when a potential sponsor backed out at
the last minute and Walker was unable to continue funding the team
out of his pocket. Fisher, to whom school is as important as
racing--she was an A-student at Teays High in Commercial Point,
Ohio--had planned on attending Butler University in Indianapolis
while running her IRL schedule, but Walker convinced her that driving
an Indy car was a full-time job.</TE>
<TE>   "I understood what Derrick wanted, but it was terribly
disappointing when I had no sponsor, and learned about it too late to
enroll at Butler," she said. "I would like to get a degree in
engineering. I admire Gil de Ferran [the 2001 CART champion driving
this season in the IRL] for having one. I'm sure it has made him a
better driver.</TE>
<TE>   "Doing both [school and racing] would be nothing new for me. I
used to run about 60 races a year when I was in high school and still
kept up with my studies. I enrolled in an on-line college program but
I miss being in the classroom."</TE>
<TE>   Fisher also worked on her own cars while growing up. Last month,
she helped the crew for Silver Crown driver Brian Tyler at
Indianapolis Raceway Park.</TE>
<TE>   "I helped change tires, had fun getting my hands dirty again," she
said. "I hate this sitting around, waiting and hoping for a ride. I
want to be doing something around cars, or else get back to school."</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach will be a novelty for Fisher. A veteran of Grand
National karting, U.S. Auto Club midgets and outlaw sprint cars, she
has never driven in a race with right turns.</TE>
<TE>   "Not on purpose, at least," she said, flashing that smile that
helped earn her the IRL's most-popular- driver award in a poll of
fellow drivers, crewmen and fans.</TE>
<TE>   Traction Control</TE>
<TE>   As in Formula One, CART officials found rules forbidding traction
control--a system using computers to avoid wheel spin and maximize
grip on the road--too difficult to enforce so they legalized it. All
three of CART's engine suppliers, Honda, Toyota and Ford, have
incorporated it into their packages.</TE>
<TE>   In the season opener at Monterrey, Mexico, driver reaction was
mixed. Some felt the system controlled the car too much, taking away
the "feel" of the car.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, as Jimmy Vasser said, "Obviously, it's a driver
aid, and what we used to do with our foot, based on our own senses,
we now have the engine doing the work for us. There's not just a
switch where you turn it on and off, but there's a lot you can do
with it and we're still learning about it every day."</TE>
<TE>   The 1.97-mile Long Beach circuit--drivers get their first look
today during practice and qualifying--offers more problems than its
11 turns. The surface of the street course changes several times a
lap from asphalt to concrete.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a situation where, as you come off the asphalt and onto
the concrete, the grip is much lower and traditionally the wheels
spin a lot more," explained Bruce Wood, Cosworth-Ford's CART program
director. "Traction control will attempt to reel that in and that's
something the drivers might not like the feel of. So we think that's
going to be one of the biggest factors for the Long Beach race."</TE>
<TE>   "It'll be a factor, but I don't know how big a factor," said
Vasser, who has seven top-10 finishes in 10 races at Long Beach,
including a win in 1996. "It's all speculation and I'm not one to sit
and talk about the 'what ifs.' Again, I think Cosworth has a good
grip on traction control and I'm expecting that it's going to work
well and we'll be able to tune it to our liking. How big a factor is
it going to be? Your guess is as good as mine."</TE>
<TE>   This has been a busy week for Vasser. On Tuesday, the Canoga Park
native was testing one of Bobby Rahal's Dallara-Chevrolets for the
Indy 500. His speed of 224.664 mph was second fastest of the test
day.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Cheever, in an Infiniti-powered Dallara, was fastest at
225.386 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Before Tuesday's running at the Speedway, Vasser logged more than
700 miles at California Speedway in an IRL car. He drove in the last
two Indy 500s for Chip Ganassi, finishing fourth last year. Rahal,
who finished second four times at Long Beach as a driver, is hoping
Vasser brings him a win as a car owner.</TE>
<TE>   Drag Racing</TE>
<TE>   John Force is getting most of the attention as he continues his
quest for his 100th funny car victory, but how about Larry Dixon? In
Don Prudhomme's top-fuel dragster, the second-generation hot rodder
has won 15 of 16 rounds in National Hot Rod Assn. competition this
year, and three of four events.</TE>
<TE>   His only loss was in the final round at Phoenix, where Tony
Schumacher won. In final rounds, he beat Kenny Bernstein at Pomona
and Gainesville, Fla., and Cory McClenathan last Sunday at Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "I think all the hard work that [crew chief] Dick LaHaie and the
team put in over the winter is paying off for us now," said Dixon,
whose father, Larry, won the Pomona Winternationals in 1970. "We had
to adapt to new rules, tires, motor and clutch changes.</TE>
<TE>   "We are only one round from a perfect start and in my view that is
well beyond a great start. Things really flow well for our team and
everyone is firing on all cylinders."</TE>
<TE>   The NHRA will be at Houston this week with Force still chasing 100
and Dixon looking for more victories.</TE>
<TE>   Last Laps</TE>
<TE>   The Sprint Car Racing Assn. will return to action after two weeks
off, sharing a Saturday night doubleheader with the new U.S. Auto
Club Ford Focus series midgets at Perris Auto Speedway. Defending
SCRA champion Cory Kruseman, after a slow start, has pulled to within
23 points of leader Tony Jones, 358-335. Ford Focus midgets are
powered by two-liter Ford ZX3 engines that run on methanol. South
Pasadena's Josh Lakatos, who won the silver medal in pistol shooting
at the 1996 Olympics, won the series opener at Bakersfield.</TE>

<HD>Johnson Is Shaky, but Still Effective</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For most of the long first inning, Randy Johnson looked beatable.
Then he quickly put a stop to such thinking.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson settled down after a shaky start, and the Arizona
Diamondbacks ended a three-game losing streak by defeating the
Colorado Rockies, 8-4, Thursday night at Denver.</LD>
<LD>   The Diamondbacks improved to 5-0 in games started by Johnson and
Curt Schilling. When the World Series co-MVPs do not pitch, Arizona
is 0-5.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson (3-0) survived a rocky first inning in which he gave up
two runs and only one hit and threw 37 pitches. He then limited
Colorado to two hits over the next six innings, striking out nine.</TE>
<TE>   The four-time Cy Young winner became the first NL pitcher to win
three games this season.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's first inning was so rough that the Diamondbacks had
Miguel Batista warming up.</TE>
<TE>   "Randy had trouble getting loose in the bullpen," Manager Bob
Brenly said. "His velocity was way down in the first inning. As his
pitch count climbed into the 30s, we became concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "As the game went on, he loosened up and got the velocity back.
For my money, that's one of the best games he's pitched. With the way
he started, for him to regroup and come after a good hitting team the
way he did was tremendous."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said his shoulder has felt tired since his last start,
calling it "dead arm."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to kid anybody," he said. "If I don't have an
overpowering fastball and slider, I am as vulnerable as anybody out
there. I minimized the damage in the first inning. As the game went
on, I hit my spots better."</TE>
<TE>   New York 3, Chicago 2--Pedro Astacio took a shutout into the
eighth inning and Scott Strickland's quick reaction started a double
play to preserve the lead as the Mets won at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Astacio (2-0) gave up five hits and struck out nine, losing his
shutout when Sammy Sosa hit his fourth homer with one out in the
eighth.</TE>
<TE>   After Sosa's homer made it 3-1, the Cubs loaded the bases with one
out. Strickland relieved and made the play of the game, snaring
pinch-hitter Mario Encarnacion's liner through the middle and then
throwing to third to double off Fred McGriff.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 6, Milwaukee 5--Tino Martinez, mired in an early slump,
drew a bases-loaded walk in the eighth inning as the Cardinals
completed a sweep with their third consecutive victory by the same
score at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, who signed a $21 million, three-year deal to replace the
retired Mark McGwire at first base, has been pressing and is batting
.138 with four runs batted in. But he got the job done against Mike
DeJean with the bat on his shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Veres (2-0) pitched 11/3 innings for the victory, leaving
with two men on in the ninth. Steve Kline came on and got two
strikeouts for his first save.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 6, Philadelphia 2--Tom Glavine pitched seven shutout
innings and Vinny Castilla homered and drove in three runs to lead
the Braves at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Glavine (2-0) gave up three hits and lowered his earned-run
average to 0.89. He won his seventh consecutive decision, dating to
last season.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 7, Montreal 5--Julian Tavarez did just enough--with his
arm, his bat and his legs--to help the Marlins end a three-game
losing streak in front of a franchise-low 4,466 fans.</TE>
<TE>   Tavarez (1-1) gave up six hits and four runs in 52/3 innings at
Miami. He had a two-out, two-strike drag-bunt single that tied the
game in the fourth and kept the inning alive for the Marlins to go
ahead for good.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 3, Pittsburgh 2--Juan Encarnacion, who moved up in the
order as Red Manager Bob Boone again juggled his lineup, homered and
drove in all three runs against the Pirates at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Haynes (1-1) limited the Pirates to six hits over 61/3
innings.</TE>

<HD>Baffert Back in Derby Business</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL>LEXINGTON, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Not expected to have a Kentucky Derby starter for the first time in
seven years, trainer Bob Baffert will return to Churchill Downs on
May 4 with War Emblem. The horse has been purchased by Prince Ahmed
Salman, one of Baffert's major clients, after his victory last
Saturday in the Illinois Derby.</LD>
<LD>   War Emblem, vanned Sunday from Chicago to Keeneland, where trainer
Bobby Springer had planned to skip the Derby and ready him for the
Preakness on May 18, was instead examined Wednesday by Baffert and
Richard Mulhall, general manager for Salman's Thoroughbred Corp. The
deal was put together Thursday. The purchase price, not disclosed, is
believed to be in excess of $1 million.</LD>
<LD>   Baffert, running his first horses in the Derby in 1996, struck
quickly by winning the race with Silver Charm in '97 and Real Quiet
in '98. Last year, Baffert saddled Salman's Point Given, the Derby
favorite, but he finished fifth in his only loss of the year.</LD>
<TE>   None of Baffert's many Derby hopefuls panned out this year.
Officer, one of the most talented, was a bust around two turns and is
now scheduled to run in the Derby Trial the Saturday before the
Derby. Danthebluegrassman, supposedly Baffert's last hope, finished
last in the Santa Anita Derby Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   A $20,000 yearling, War Emblem won the Illinois Derby by 61/4
lengths for his 84-year-old owner, Russell Reineman, as Repent, the
1-2 favorite, apparently injured his ankle and finished second. War
Emblem has won four of seven starts.</TE>

<HD>There's Nothing Fishy About This Tradition</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles Pitts once cut short a business trip to Paris to get home in
time for the Eastern Sierra trout opener.</LD>
<LD>   It was 16 years ago and the retired executive from Irvine recalls
that he, his two sons and a son-in-law enjoyed their best fishing on
Gull Lake, one of four sparkling gems on the scenic June Lake Loop.
They caught and released so many trout that Pitts is embarrassed to
reveal the number.</LD>
<LD>   Not that you could believe him anyway, given that fish stories
tend to get better over time.</LD>
<TE>   For instance, Pitts' daughter, Debra Harkness, remembers her
father taking the Concord from Paris to ensure a timely arrival.</TE>
<TE>   Pitts, however, recalls it as "just an ordinary airplane."</TE>
<TE>   Pitts, 66, is among thousands of Southland anglers who, two weeks
from today, will be making their annual pilgrimage north on U.S. 395
to celebrate the beginning of a new trout-fishing season.</TE>
<TE>   The April 27 opener will be his 40th in succession and again it
will be spent at Gull, the smallest of the four lakes, nestled
beautifully beneath the towering, snow-covered Sierra slopes.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always fished at either June or Gull, but Gull is probably
my favorite because it's so serene when you're out there on the
water," he says. "At times all you hear are the waterfalls."</TE>
<TE>   The number in his group once reached 30, but now the opener has
become mostly a family affair involving himself, his two sons,
Charles Jr. and Kevin, son-in-law Scott Harkness and grandsons Devin
Pitts and Kyle Harkness.</TE>
<TE>   The memories are beginning to blend together, Pitts says. There
have been sunny days and snowy days, and days when they were pelted
by sleet and surrounded by shifting ice.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest trout Pitts has landed weighed only 3.78 pounds, but
Charles Jr. once weighed in a 7-pound 15-ounce rainbow.</TE>
<TE>   "And his brother and brother-in-law didn't speak to him the rest
of the day because he put his line in the water as I was still
positioning the boat, and because we had a cash pot for the first,
biggest and most fish, and they felt it was unfair," Pitts said.</TE>
<TE>   There was the time one of them accidentally used potato mix to
make the morning pancakes. Some other times, the food was only
half-cooked.</TE>
<TE>   "But it tasted good anyhow," Pitts says. "We've always found
opening day to be a lot of fun, but it's also a bonding experience
and I feel it has had a positive influence on my sons and grandsons."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there was also the time two of them fell into the water
while trying to get out of the boat--after drinking too much brandy.</TE>
<TE>   A little sipping, Pitts confesses, is also part of the tradition.</TE>
<TE>   If a little sipping is a tradition within the tradition, so is
enjoying some hot pozole--a spicy Mexican soup--at Bishop Creek
Lodge. Chef Adolfo Castillo poured his first bowl 14 years ago and
since then it has become, for those spending their openers high in
Bishop Creek Canyon, a belly-warming capper to what is often a frigid
first day of fishing.</TE>
<TE>   "It has gained a notoriety of the people who come into the
canyon," lodge owner Gary Olson says.</TE>
<TE>   If the current weather pattern holds, the demand for pozole might
be at a minimum this year. Olson's lodge is at 8,500 feet and on
Monday evening he barbecued outside, wearing shorts and a T-shirt.
The nice weather is troubling, however.</TE>
<TE>   The lakes that feed the various forks of Bishop Creek are popular
ice-fishing holes and the ice is getting more precarious by the day.
In fact, officials in Inyo and Mono counties are strongly advising
against ice fishing.</TE>
<TE>   On the bright side, the warm spell has enabled the clearing of the
road to both South Lake and Lake Sabrina, and it's likely that North
Lake also will be accessible by car by opening day.</TE>
<TE>   Fishing is generally good throughout the Eastern Sierra on opening
weekend, and the Department of Fish and Game deserves much of the
credit. Between now and April 27, its trucks will be stocking 94,000
pounds of rainbow trout, or about 188,000 fish.</TE>
<TE>   The fish will supplement the planting late last season of 30,000
pounds of brood-stock rainbows weighing three to eight pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Crowley Lake's pre-opener stocking is done toward the end of each
fishing season.</TE>
<TE>   Last September, the reservoir received its usual allotment of half
a million fish of various strains.</TE>
<TE>   The breakdown: 183,970 sub-catchable Coleman-strain rainbows,
164,350 sub-catchable Eagle Lake rainbows, 92,243 sub-catchable
Kamloop rainbows, 65,232 sub-catchable and 22,950 fingerling brown
trout; and 25,000 sub-catchable and 35,125 fingerling cutthroat
trout.</TE>
<TE>   Twin Lakes Resort in Bridgeport is sponsoring its inaugural "Guns
and Hoses" derby May 3-5, open only to active or retired law
enforcement or fire department personnel. Prizes will be awarded in
several categories and a special trophy will be awarded to the
department with the most participation.</TE>
<TE>   Cost is $35 and proceeds will benefit the local Cops for Kids and
Firemen's Bike Charity programs. Details: (877) 932-7751.</TE>
<TE>   News and Notes</TE>
<TE>   * Local freshwater: Ventura's Randy Crabtree on Tuesday caught a
191/2-pound largemouth bass while fishing with a 12-inch Castaic Soft
Bait in the Deep Cat area of Casitas Lake. It was the largest bass
caught in the United States this year but fell well short of the
22-pound 4-ounce all-tackle world record set in 1932 at Montgomery
Lake in Georgia. The Casitas record is a 21-3 largemouth bass caught
in March 1980.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little surprised at this one," concession manager Randy
King said. "I didn't think there were that many close to 20 pounds
still in the lake."</TE>
<TE>   This is prime time for bass fishermen throughout Southern
California as the bigger fish are spawning in the shallows.</TE>
<TE>   * Local saltwater: By this time last year, white seabass were
coming over the rails by the dozens aboard both island and coastal
boats. Maybe they learned then that this is not a good place to be
because they remain elusive and catches have been spotty.</TE>
<TE>   On time, however, are barracuda.</TE>
<TE>   They showed this week off the Long Beach Breakwater--the
enterprise out of Marina Sportfishing on Thursday reported 10-fish
limits for everybody by 9 a.m.--and the only problem so far is that a
lot of sub-legal fish--shorter than 28 inches--are mixed in with the
"stovepipes."</TE>
<TE>   As for the absence of seabass, the most reasonable explanation is
that the water temperature remains about three degrees colder than
normal.</TE>
<TE>   * Santa Barbara salmon: Capt. David Bacon of WaveWalker Charters
reports excellent fishing for those aboard boats small enough to
effectively troll, with fish coming in three size classes: 10-15
pounds, 17-20 pounds and 25 to 30-plus pounds. An effective rig is a
Hotspot flasher blade trailed by a Rotary Salmon Killer, which is a
hood fitted over an anchovy or sardine. Bacon can be reached at (805)
964-2046.</TE>
<TE>   * Baja bite: While the Southern California bite is late in coming,
it's early in southern Baja and resort operators are crediting El
Nino conditions. At remote Las Arenas Resort, Linda Glassman-Davis
labeled the inshore fishing for roosterfish and jack crevalle, along
with the offshore fishing for yellowfin tuna as "the best I have ever
had in over 20 years in April." Details: www.lasarenas.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Revillagigedo Island update: The remote Mexican archipelago
remains off-limits to San Diego's long-range fleet. Bob Fletcher,
president of the Sportfishing Assn. of California, said he hopes to
resolve the recent revocation of permits through legal channels but
has also enlisted the support of Rep. Randall "Duke" Cunningham
(R-Escondido), who helped SAC secure permits to fish the islands in
1995 and hopes to schedule meetings with officials in Mexico. The
closure was announced unexpectedly two weeks ago, in the middle of a
season for which the fleet had already purchased permits.</TE>
<TE>   * Shooting sports: The California Waterfowl Assn.'s annual Shoot
and Barbecue is April 20 beginning at 7:30 a.m. at Triple-B Clays in
South El Monte. Cost is $75 per shooter, which includes 50 rounds of
sporting clays and 50 rounds of five-stand competition. Details:
(714) 893-2082.</TE>
<TE>   * Showtime: The Fred Hall Tri-County Sports Show, focusing
primarily on boating and fishing, is in progress through Sunday at
Seaside Park in Ventura. Admission is $7 for adults and free for
children 15 and younger. Hours are 2-8:30 p.m. today, 10 a.m.-9 p.m.
Saturday and 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Sunday.</TE>

<HD>The Course Is So Long, so Palmer Says So Long</HD>

<DL>AUGUSTA, Ga.</DL>
<LD>The dignified champion had just hit what he thought was a dignified
tee shot.</LD>
<LD>   But the fairway was longer than last year. And he was older than
last year.</LD>
<LD>   Looking at the gaping distance required for his second effort on
the Masters' renovated 14th hole Thursday, Arnold Palmer gasped, then
trudged to the gallery in search of a shoulder.</LD>
<TE>   "Why don't we just retire right now?" he said to friend Russ
Meyer.</TE>
<TE>   "It will get better," Meyer said.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope so," Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   They both looked away, because they both knew it wouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   The dignified champion understands what that means.</TE>
<TE>   With tears filling his lined eyes, Palmer later announced that
today would be the last round he plays at the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's over," he said. "It's done."</TE>
<TE>   Done, after a record 48 consecutive years here.</TE>
<TE>   Done, after four green jackets.</TE>
<TE>   Done, when his age finally equaled a Masters par--72--that he can
no longer break.</TE>
<TE>   Done, after a day in which the dignified champion was the worst
golfer.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer is in last place in the field of 88, a guy with a scorecard
that reads 89, a guy for whom Tiger Woods said, "The golf course has
just gotten a little bit too big for him."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the course--but not this tournament, never this tournament.</TE>
<TE>   This is where he won his first Masters in 1958 after surviving a
rules controversy on the 12th hole.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember it like it was yesterday," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There is where he lost it in 1961 after making a double bogey on
the 18th.</TE>
<TE>   "The saddest situation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This is where he needed only seven years to win his four
tournaments, the greatest time of his life because this was the only
tournament that mattered.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1955, when I came here to play in my first Masters as a
contestant ... that's when it really dawned on me that this is the
tournament of all tournaments that I want to win," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This is where he has been embraced even though he hasn't won in 38
years because he is the one always doing the hugging.</TE>
<TE>   This is what made him different from Jack Nicklaus or Gary Player,
the other more aloof champions of his era.</TE>
<TE>   He may have led an army, but Arnie did not behave like a general.
He led the pack, but he was one of the pack, nudging and grinning and
letting us in on his secret.</TE>
<TE>   So it was again Thursday, when, amid scuffed tee shots and lousy
putts, Palmer comforted his fans and acted as the perfect host for
the first of his two-day farewell party.</TE>
<TE>   "You know it's time to retire when you either know the first names
of everyone in the gallery or they're relatives," Palmer told a buddy
during one of his many gallery conversations during the round.</TE>
<TE>   After a bad tee shot on the 15th hole landed him in pine needles
under a tree, Palmer walked up to the large gathering with a wink.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe all my friends would let this happen to me," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He laughed, so they laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody better move back," he said. "If I hit it here, hell
knows where I'm hitting it next."</TE>
<TE>   He smiled, so they smiled.</TE>
<TE>   He blasted the ball back to the fairway, then disappeared over a
ridge, leaving the fans to embrace his touch and mourn the time.</TE>
<TE>   "I love Arnie," said Ed Richitelli, an old friend. "But I don't
want to remember him as the Arnie who shot an 85 at the Masters. I
want to remember him as the Arnie who won the thing."</TE>
<TE>   The dignified champion knows this, and so he is leaving before the
questions, before the criticism, before anyone grows tired of a guy
who will have missed the cut for 19 consecutive years.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to get a letter," Palmer said with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   He was referring to the controversial letter of dismissal recently
sent by Masters officials to veterans Gay Brewer, Billy Casper and
Doug Ford.</TE>
<TE>   But Palmer would never have received such a letter, and he knew
it.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't about looking in a mailbox. This was about looking in
a mirror.</TE>
<TE>   That is what a dignified champion does, taking control of his
future, making the hard decisions before others do it for him.</TE>
<TE>   "My golf has been pretty lousy as of late and it doesn't warrant
being here playing," Palmer said. "That is enough of a push to push
me over the edge and just say, hey, enough is enough."</TE>
<TE>   While he said he made the call earlier this winter, it was
finalized on the first hole, when he hit a three-wood to the edge of
the green for his second shot on the par four.</TE>
<TE>   Then he putted completely off the green on the other side. Then
putted to within 10 feet. Then putted in for a double-bogey six.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I knew what kind of writing was on the wall," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the round confirmed it, what with the bigger hitters
dwarfing him on the bigger holes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I hit the hell out of it, and I look up and they are 100
yards in front of me," he said. "That's a pretty good message right
there."</TE>
<TE>   If there was a message here Thursday, it had nothing to do with
golf. It was a message of honor, of grace, of traits sadly lacking
among today's not-so-dignified champions.</TE>
<TE>   It was about the worst golfer in the Masters being the most
perfect golfer in the Masters, still, after all these years, and if
only somehow we could make him stay.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer was asked how he would envision the most perfect final shot
today.</TE>
<TE>   He thought for a moment, then said, maybe, a hole in one on the
12th. Or, he said, perhaps a putt on the 18th.</TE>
<TE>   Then he sighed, and shrugged, as if, how do you shrink 48 years
into one shot?</TE>
<TE>   "I think, just the round," he said, a farewell address as fine as
any other. "Just being here."</TE>

<HD>Officers Sickened, Police Post Closed</HD>
<DH>Health: Mold had been found in the crowded, aging Long
Beach facility, and experts will seek to determine whether it's to
blame. Police chief wants new building soon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long Beach police officers and other employees were removed from the
North Patrol substation Thursday, and the facility was closed, after
several officers became seriously ill, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The closure of the substation at Scherer Park comes after the
discovery of mold in several parts of the facility, said Long Beach
Assistant City Manager Gerald Miller. The more than 100 officers and
other police employees will be temporarily moved to the West Patrol
Substation at 1835 Santa Fe Ave.</LD>
<LD>   A city safety officer found the mold Tuesday and a company tested
the air quality of the facility after reports of 17 officers becoming
ill in the past month, acting Police Chief John Bretza said.</LD>
<TE>   Mold was found in modular buildings that house bathrooms and
locker rooms. The substation, composed of a small building and
several trailers, is about 20 years old.</TE>
<TE>   City and police officials stressed on Thursday that the mold may
not be responsible for the illnesses. However, it will be two weeks
before tests reveal whether there are harmful spores, bacteria or
fungi in the substation.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not sure whether there's a relationship between the
illnesses and the building," Miller said. "But we want to make every
effort, if we do have a problem, to address it. We want to err on the
side of caution."</TE>
<TE>   Bretza said he believes conditions at the substation have played a
role in the illnesses. In the past month, four officers have
contracted pneumonia, three bronchitis and 10 others a variety of
upper respiratory illnesses, Bretza said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the building's floor crumbles and there is often flooding
because of the plumbing or leaky roof. Stagnant water under modular
units has caused noxious odors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's also extremely overcrowded. There's over 100 people in a
very confined space," Bretza said.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said an environmental impact report issued about two years
ago confirmed problems at the substation.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions at the substation, at Del Amo Boulevard and Atlantic
Avenue, were noted as a reason for moving officers to a new facility,
Miller said. The Long Beach Police Department will probably begin
construction of a large police station at Scherer Park this summer.
In the meantime, construction of a smaller substation to temporarily
house officers at the closed substation could begin in the next few
months, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   He said that even if tests do not show that the building sickened
the officers, several changes will be made to the old substation.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very worried about my officers," Bretza said. "I really have
to commend our officers for working in such deplorable conditions for
so long. I'm hoping the new building gets built as soon as possible."</TE>

<HD>Officers Sickened, Police Post Shut in Long Beach</HD>
<DH>Health: Mold was found in the crowded, aging facility, and
tests will address whether it's to blame. Police chief wants a new
building soon.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Long Beach police officers and other employees were removed from the
North Patrol substation Thursday, and the facility was closed, after
several officers became seriously ill, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The closure of the substation in Scherer Park comes after the
discovery of mold in several parts of the facility, said Long Beach
Assistant City Manager Gerald Miller. The more than 100 officers and
other police employees will be temporarily moved to the West Patrol
Substation at 1835 Santa Fe Ave.</LD>
<LD>   A city safety officer found the mold Tuesday and a company tested
the air quality of the facility after reports of 17 officers becoming
ill in the past month, acting Police Chief John Bretza said.</LD>
<TE>   Mold was found in modular buildings that house bathrooms and
locker rooms. The substation, composed of a small building and
several trailers, is about 20 years old.</TE>
<TE>   City and police officials stressed on Thursday that the mold may
not responsible for the illnesses. However, it will be two weeks
before tests reveal whether there are harmful spores, bacteria or
fungi in the substation.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not sure whether there's a relationship between the
illnesses and the building," Miller said. "But we want to make every
effort, if we do have a problem, to address it. We want to err on the
side of caution."</TE>
<TE>   Bretza said he believes conditions at the substation have played a
role in the illnesses. In the past month, four officers have
contracted pneumonia, three bronchitis and 10 others a variety of
upper respiratory illnesses, Bretza said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the building's floor crumbles and there is often flooding
because of the plumbing or leaky roof. Stagnant water under modular
units has caused noxious odors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's also extremely overcrowded. There's over 100 people in a
very confined space," Bretza said.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said an environmental impact report issued about two years
ago confirmed problems at the substation.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions at the substation, at Del Amo Boulevard and Atlantic
Avenue, were noted as a reason for moving officers to a new facility,
Miller said. The Long Beach Police Department will probably begin
construction of a large police station at Scherer Park this summer.
In the meantime, construction of a smaller substation to temporarily
house officers at the closed substation could begin in the next few
months, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   He said that even if tests do not show that the building sickened
the officers, several changes will be made to the old substation.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very worried about my officers," Bretza said. "I really have
to commend our officers for working in such deplorable conditions for
so long. I'm hoping the new building gets built as soon as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Many neighborhood residents have long opposed any police station
at the park, seeing it as an encroachment on parkland.</TE>
<TE>   However, a member of the Stop Taking Our Parks said she was aware
of problems at the old substation.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not surprised at all," said Gigi Fast Elk Bannister. She said
reading the environmental impact report and visiting the substation
made it clear the buildings were troubled.</TE>

<LD>More than 200 pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian demonstrators engaged
in a yelling match outside UCLA's Kerckhoff Hall on Thursday in yet
another campus confrontation arising from the Middle East conflict.</LD>
<LD>   While each side struggled to drown out the other, the arguments
did not lead to violence.</LD>
<LD>   Students have been protesting at college campuses around the
country as hostilities have intensified on the West Bank. Earlier
this week, hundreds of pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian students held
simultaneous demonstrations at UC Berkeley. Seventy-nine students
were cited after pro-Palestinian protesters occupied Wheeler Hall.</LD>
<TE>   UCLA's pro-Palestinian demonstration, organized by the Peace and
Justice Committee, was originally scheduled for Tuesday, but the
student group postponed it to Thursday to avoid interfering with a
Holocaust remembrance ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's pro-Palestinian rally lasted nearly two hours and
featured several speakers who denounced what they described as
atrocities in refugee camps by the U.S.-sponsored Israeli military.
In response, Jewish activists carried signs denouncing Palestinian
suicide bombings that have killed Israeli civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Iroshi Perera, a sophomore studying neuroscience, stood in the
middle of the pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian groups and tried to
listen to the colliding viewpoints.</TE>
<TE>   ''I'm confused,'' she said. ''I don't know what to believe. It's
completely opposite views. They both seem adamant that they are
right.''</TE>
<TE>   ''I don't think it accomplished anything because nobody wants to
hear each other," said Neda Sargordan, a junior majoring in political
science.</TE>
<TE>   But she too was ultimately drawn into a debate with a pro-Israeli
demonstrator--one that grew so heated that a university administrator
stepped in to mediate.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Officials for USA Water Polo Inc. and the Southern Section announced
Wednesday the settlement of a lawsuit between the parties. The USAWP
had brought the suit against the section last year in an effort to
end the section's "association rule," which limits contact between
high school coaches and their players outside the sports season.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement calls for a limited waiver of the rule to allow
USAWP to select a reasonable number of coaches to be involved in its
pipeline programs, including the national youth and junior teams.
This includes the selection process, training and competition for
those teams.</LD>

<LD>Delmon Young was standing near the Camarillo High batting cage when
three baseball players from Ventura High approached.</LD>
<LD>   "Can I have your autograph?" one said.</LD>
<LD>   He was serious.</LD>
<TE>   Young, a 16-year-old junior, doesn't sing in a rock band, doesn't
star in a television series and has never appeared on MTV.</TE>
<TE>   But teenagers--even ones from opposing baseball teams--flock to
him for autographs.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of feel weird about it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Young is a major leaguer in waiting, and everyone knows it.</TE>
<TE>   If he were eligible for this year's amateur draft, he might be the
first player taken. Next year, he'll surely be No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   He's 6 feet 3, weighs 195 pounds, and swings a bat with such speed
that it's scary how fast the ball accelerates when he makes solid
contact--which is most of the time.</TE>
<TE>   "He has amazing tools," Camarillo Coach Scott Cline said.</TE>
<TE>   Young, a center fielder, is batting .652 with 12 home runs and 44
runs batted in. In a Pacific View League game against Hueneme, he hit
a three-run home run, a grand slam, walked with the bases loaded and
hit a run-scoring single to complete a nine-RBI day.</TE>
<TE>   "I told [my pitcher], 'When Delmon Young is in the major leagues,
you can tell your grandchildren he hit a home run off you,'" Hueneme
Coach Reg Welker said.</TE>
<TE>   Young already has broken Camarillo's single-season home run record
of 11 set in 1985 by Cline and equaled by former Stanford
All-American Joe Borchard, who is now a top prospect in the Chicago
White Sox system.</TE>
<TE>   In his last 24 at-bats, Young has 18 hits--eight of them home
runs.</TE>
<TE>   "The kid can be an everyday big-league player," said Nez Balelo,
who scouts for the Atlanta Braves, owns the West Coast Baseball
School and has given hitting lessons to Young. "He knows when he does
something right and something wrong and makes the adjustment."</TE>
<TE>   As if Young's batting wasn't impressive enough, he can astonish
onlookers by the power of his right arm. He has been clocked throwing
96 mph. Against Hueneme, he threw out a runner at home plate trying
to score from third on a fly ball. Welker confronted his third-base
coach as to why he would send the runner.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to see him throw," he replied.</TE>
<TE>   Said Welker: "He throws peas from the outfield. You don't find a
lot of high school players with the complete package. The kid can hit
with power to all fields. He hits mistakes and good pitches."</TE>
<TE>   Young, whose brother, Dmitri, plays for the Detroit Tigers, burst
onto the high school scene in the summer of 1999 when he was invited
to play in the Area Code tournament as a 13-year-old incoming
freshman.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents were outraged that someone so young could take a spot
usually reserved for seniors-to-be in a tournament designed to
preview potential professional prospects.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of hard," Young said. "If you did bad, they'd say,
'Oh, he didn't belong.' If you did good, everyone was happy."</TE>
<TE>   He performed well enough to vindicate tournament organizers who
went out on the limb in selecting him.</TE>
<TE>   "It built up [my confidence] that I could handle high school
pitching," Young said.</TE>
<TE>   He batted .460 as a freshman and .468 with eight home runs as a
sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the credit for his development must go to his father,
Larry, who used to fly F-14 Tomcats in the Navy. Larry didn't play
baseball but read books, studied videos and passed along his tips to
Delmon, who made the decision to devote total concentration to
baseball when he was 12.</TE>
<TE>   Larry, who picked cotton as a youngster in Vicksburg, Miss., used
his determination and drive to become a fighter pilot. He has tried
to instill the same work ethic in Delmon.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to get him to appreciate the mental part," Larry said.
"Have a purpose with what you do on the field. I don't want him to
rely just on athletic ability."</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, Delmon's success is similar to that of Dmitri, who
was the fourth player taken overall in the 1991 draft by the St.
Louis Cardinals. A shortstop at Oxnard Rio Mesa High, Dmitri had 156
career hits, 29 home runs and 127 RBIs. He was so good at a young age
that he had to carry around a birth certificate to prove his age.</TE>
<TE>   Delmon's steady, unflappable demeanor helps separate him from his
peers. There are games in which Young has gone hitless. But rarely
does he leave a game feeling down. He stays positive by always
looking for something he did right to take his mind off any failures.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't do anything about it afterward," he said. "You'll have
another game, another at-bat. It's not like I'm going to retire after
my next at-bat."</TE>
<TE>   Cline is feeling like the luckiest high school coach in America.
He tutored Borchard, a first-round draft choice out of Stanford two
years ago. Now he gets to pitch batting practice to Young, who makes
the farthest fences look close.</TE>
<TE>   "There are times you throw a pitch and watch him hit and all of a
sudden he takes you over the wall," Cline said. "You go, 'Man!' He
has a great swing and a great mind for the game."</TE>
<TE>   Having an older brother in the major leagues has presented Young
with opportunities to observe up-close how major leaguers prepare for
games. He was a bat boy when Dmitri played for the Cincinnati Reds
and received advice from several of his brother's teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to think there was a lot of pressure," he said. "You watch
them on TV and they look tense, but they're so relaxed you don't know
a game is going on."</TE>
<TE>   When Young is hanging out with major leaguers, the autograph
seekers ignore him.</TE>
<TE>   "They want the big boys," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It seems only a matter of time before Young becomes one of them.</TE>

<LD>ESPN will televise Sunday's game between the Dodgers and the San
Diego Padres, although the Dodger team Joe Morgan has seen so far
sounds better suited for ESPN Classic.</LD>
<LD>   "They're going to have to have good pitching, because I don't
think their offense is going to do a lot," said Morgan, the network's
lead baseball analyst. "Their pitching looks pretty good right now.
After the first series with the Giants, when the Giants beat them up
a little bit, they won four in a row with their pitching--their
starting pitching [didn't give up] a run in [30] innings.</LD>
<LD>   "So their starting pitching is looking good. But the thing is, how
many runs are they going to be able to manufacture and score? They
have some speed at the top of the lineup, which I like.... But the
problem is, I just don't know how many runs they're going to score.
They only have [six] home runs, which is not very many home runs in
this day and age."</LD>
<TE>   Good pitching, good baserunning, little power, lots of low-scoring
games.</TE>
<TE>   Sounds like a scouting report of the 1966 Dodgers ... minus, of
course, Wes Parker, Maury Wills, Willie Davis and John Roseboro.</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 Dodger defense is adequate, Morgan says, but not nearly
strong enough to carry a limited batting order past San Francisco and
Arizona in the National League West.</TE>
<TE>   "Their defense is not the best," he said. "If your defense is not
great, it will hurt your pitching over the course of a long, 162-game
season."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan also questions the Gary Sheffield trade, which he believes
has stranded Shawn Green in the middle of the Dodger batting order.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's going to be very difficult for Shawn Green this
year," he said. "He doesn't have Gary Sheffield behind him. Gary,
they can say whatever they want, but Green was able to do a lot of
the things that he did because Gary Sheffield was coming up next.
When they got behind, 2-and-0 or 3-and-1, they threw him a fastball
because they didn't want Gary to hit a two-run homer if they walked
[Green]. This year, they're not doing that. They don't care if they
walk him.</TE>
<TE>   "That's nothing against Brian Jordan, who's a very fine player.
But, let's face it, Gary Sheffield is one of the top power players in
the whole game. I've already seen the difference. I've watched how
they pitch to Shawn Green as opposed to the way they pitched him last
year. I think it's going to be very difficult for him to hit 40-plus
home runs this year."</TE>
<TE>   Did the Dodgers make a mistake trading Sheffield?</TE>
<TE>   "It depends on why you got rid of him," Morgan said. "If you got
rid of him because you thought Brian Jordan and Odalis Perez were
better for your team, then that's fine. But if you got rid of him
because he had complained about a few things, then I don't think
that's right.</TE>
<TE>   "I think in this day and age, players have a right to speak up
when they think something is wrong, as long as they produce on the
field. And he definitely produced on the field for the Dodgers. And
he made the guys around him better....</TE>
<TE>   "I guess my point is, I wouldn't have traded him. But I'm not in
charge."</TE>
<TE>   More Masters</TE>
<TE>   Finally, golf fans will be able to watch all 18 holes of Sunday's
final round of the Masters. And for that, they can thank the weather.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, rain delayed the third round of the Masters long
enough that the leaders did not tee off until CBS came on the air.
CBS was able to cover the leaders on every hole until darkness
suspended play at the 15th hole. Public response to the coverage was
enough to persuade Masters officials to allow the network to televise
an extra 90 minutes of the final round this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the reason the club feels comfortable now with the
18-hole coverage was because the coverage that Saturday was so
positive," CBS Sports President Sean McManus said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of its customary 1 p.m. West Coast start time, CBS will
begin Sunday's telecast at 11:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Host Jim Nantz believes the so-called "Tiger-proofing" of the
course is a misnomer, the changes instead making defending champion
Tiger Woods, one of longest hitters on the tour, even more difficult
to beat.</TE>
<TE>   "The course has been lengthened by almost 300 yards," Nantz noted.
"There's been a lot of speculation--is this something to try to
'Tiger-proof' Augusta, to make it harder for him to win?</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is, if anybody plays golf on a serious basis, they
would know that ... the longer you make a course, it will only play
into Tiger's hands. It should favor Tiger, if anything.</TE>
<TE>   "My biggest concern for him, if I'm a Tiger Woods fan and wanting
to see him win this weekend, is his putting. He has not been putting
this year leading up to the Masters like the Tiger we know."</TE>
<TE>   Putting has also been a problem for Phil Mickelson, continuing his
long-running quest to finally win a major championship.</TE>
<TE>   "Mickelson has had a four-putt and a five-putt in his last two
tournaments," Nantz said. "This guy, who has tremendous length [and]
a reputation for being one of the great short-game artists in the
game today, really has some issues with his putting. I think his
putting is overrated."</TE>
<TE>   That said, Nantz offered this prediction before the tournament
began:</TE>
<TE>   "[Mickelson] is going to win a green jacket one day. I saw him at
the Final Four on Monday night, at the championship game. In our
exchange there, we made a tentative agreement to see one another at 7
o'clock on Sunday at the Butler Cabin.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a strong chance, what I'm saying, that Mickelson
might find a way to put it all together."</TE>
<TE>   Shaq Logic</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal appeared on HBO's "On the Record With Bob Costas"
Thursday night, tackling such topics as the new NBA rules (and their
effect in cramping his style), his foul shooting, how the current
Lakers would match up against the Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls and
his relationship with Phil Jackson. Some highlights:</TE>
<TE>   Bob Costas: "Who plays you tough but fair?"</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal: "No one. According to the new rules they set, no one plays
me tough but fair."</TE>
<TE>   Costas: "If they call the game the way you think it should be
called, what would you average?"</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal: "Forty-five. The reason why I say I average 45 is I shoot
nothing but high-percentage shots.... If I concentrated and hit my
free throws, I'd probably average 50."</TE>
<TE>   Costas: "What do you think these Lakers would have done against
Michael Jordan's Bulls of the mid-'90s?"</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal: "We would have beat them. We'd match up with them very
well and we'd overpower them at the big-man spot."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal is better-versed in the intricacies of the NBA than the
U.S. government, as evidenced by his take on his relationship with
Jackson:</TE>
<TE>   "He's President Bush and I'm Dick Cheney. We may have some heated
arguments about what should go on, but he's the boss and I'm the vice
president. He runs the Senate. I run the Army."</TE>
<TE>   Costas: "What's Kobe [Bryant], the secretary of state?"</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal: "Exactly. He's next in line."</TE>
<TE>   The show will be re-broadcast tonight at midnight.</TE>

<LD>The kids asked actor Tom Arnold how to make it in the film business,
and with sobering honesty the comedian said: Stay away from drugs and
alcohol, follow your dreams, and don't become famous by marrying
someone who was famous first.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, that was only Arnold's opinion. The students at
Birmingham High School in Van Nuys on Thursday morning heard myriad
viewpoints from a variety of celebrities, including Billy Baldwin and
Sean Astin.</LD>
<LD>   The actors and industry people were there as part of the second
annual "Stand Up for Class" mentoring day, in which entertainers
encouraged students to enrich their academic lives.</LD>
<TE>   The program was organized by the Creative Coalition, a group of
entertainment industry advocates who have lobbied in Washington for
campaign finance reform and pushed for the arts in public schools.
Birmingham was chosen because it offers a communications magnet and
theater academy.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to a class of 70 drama students, Arnold and fellow actor
David Paymer described the contrasting paths they took to Hollywood.
Paymer grew up on Long Island in New York and took part in high
school productions of "Fiddler on the Roof" and "Once Upon a
Mattress." Arnold grew up in Iowa and worked at a meatpacking plant.</TE>
<TE>   "I followed my dream [of being an actor] by setting short-term
goals that were reachable," said Paymer, who has been in the films
"Mr. Saturday Night" and "City Slickers."</TE>
<TE>   Arnold, who hosts Fox Sports Net's "Best Damn Sports Show Period,"
told the class that the entertainment industry was difficult to
succeed in and fraught with disappointment and long periods without
work.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought if I was on TV, everyone would like me," said Arnold,
who was cheered after a student recounted his memorable bathroom
scene in the film "Austin Powers." "Turns out, that's not necessarily
true.... You have to learn to enjoy the struggle. Even the big stars
like Jennifer Lopez and Tom Cruise deal with rejection."</TE>
<TE>   Handling rejection and maintaining ambition was a central theme of
the entertainers' messages.</TE>
<TE>   For the students, there was also the excitement of having movie
and TV stars on campus. Shouts of "You're hot!" rang out from girls
when Baldwin spoke. One student asked "Extra" host Leeza Gibbons who
did her hair.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to the students in the auditorium, Baldwin was asked to
explain why he was at the school. "We want to share with you what's
going on and what your future holds for you because we've been down
that path," he said. "We want to inspire you."</TE>

<TE>   "If you choose the arts as a career, you will fail a lot more than
you will succeed. So you better get used to it," said actor Stephen
Collins, who stars in the television show "7th Heaven."</TE>
<TE>   The discussion gave senior Rachel Young second thoughts about
pursuing a career in acting.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems so hard," said the 18-year-old drama student. "I don't
think I'd be able to do it. It's too scary."</TE>
<TE>   Another senior drama student, Wayne Smith, said he was more
encouraged than discouraged.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they gave me hope," Smith said. "I'd want to be a
director."</TE>
<TE>   For the students, there was also the excitement of having movie
and TV stars on campus. Shouts of "You're hot!" rang out in the
auditorium from girls when Baldwin spoke.</TE>
<TE>   One student asked Leeza Gibbons, host of the syndicated show
"Extra," who did her hair. And when Sean Astin spoke, chants of
"Rudy, Rudy" broke out, in reference to his role as an inspirational
Notre Dame football player in the film "Rudy."</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to know Tom Arnold is as funny in real life as he is on
screen," said freshman Chris Kopitzke.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to the students in the auditorium, Baldwin was asked to
explain why he was at the school.</TE>

<HD>Use of Styrofoam Statues Offends Easter Islanders</HD>
<DH>Media: They point to an upcoming 'Laverne &amp; Shirley' show,
saying it demeans their culture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Why do Hollywood knuckleheads keep calling Easter Island's famous
stone statues "tiki heads"?</LD>
<LD>   That question had representatives of the remote Pacific outpost
scratching their heads Thursday as they protested what they say is
the latest Tinseltown tiki production--an upcoming "Laverne &amp;
Shirley" television special.</LD>
<LD>   The prime-time one-hour show "Entertainment Tonight Presents:
Laverne &amp; Shirley Together Again" will air on ABC on May 7.</LD>
<TE>   Four 18-foot Styrofoam replicas of the Easter Island
statues--called moais by natives--were used as backdrops during the
taping of the show. And that's offensive to the island's 4,000
residents, members of the Rapa-Nui Chilean Assn.'s California chapter
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to think this is the result of ignorance and
stupidity," Easter Island native Miguel Angel Morales said as he and
two others stood vigil with protest signs outside Paramount Studios,
where the show was produced.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an invasion of native culture by Paramount Pictures.
Shame on them. When they make movies about exotic locations they
don't care about the culture."</TE>
<TE>   Morales, 49, a researcher for the state of California who lives in
Riverside, said his 200-member group and the mayor of Easter Island,
Pedro Paoa, are demanding that Paramount and other film studios
"cease immediately to use moais--incorrectly named 'tiki heads' by
Hollywood studios at large"--in movies, TV shows and commercials.</TE>
<TE>   He said protests are also being lodged with the United Nations
over the trampling of Easter Island's cultural and religious heritage
by filmmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Morales alleged that actor-producer Kevin Costner commissioned the
fake Easter Island statues for his 1994 movie "Rapa Nui." He also
complained that Costner tried to hire female Easter Islanders to
appear topless in the film for $36 per scene.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, according to Morales, the statue replicas were turned
over to a Hollywood prop shop for rental use.</TE>
<TE>   They later appeared in a triple-X movie, "Making Love Hawaiian
Style," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the recruiting of extras, Morales asked: "What would Kevin
Costner say if someone went to his door and asked his wife to pose
topless?"</TE>
<TE>   Costner could not be reached for comment Thursday. But film critic
Roger Ebert, while panning "Rapa Nui," took special note in a 1994
review of the "dozens, if not hundreds of wonderful bare breasts" in
the film.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Entertainment Tonight declined to comment on the
protest but noted that the "Laverne &amp; Shirley" show is still being
edited and it is not certain the tiki head skit will be included.
Stars Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams likewise could not be reached
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   But the protest was supported by one expert on the Easter Island
statues. Jo Anne Van Tilburg, a UCLA archeologist who has spent years
studying the island's 887 statues, said the islanders need to take
action now to prevent their sacred culture from being commercialized
like ancient Hawaiian and Tahitian tikis have been over the last 50
years.</TE>
<TE>   The four Styrofoam statues, meantime, were standing Thursday
outside a prop shop a few blocks from the Paramount lot.</TE>
<TE>   Shop manager John Chai said he was unfamiliar with the history of
the mock statues. But he said the figures, called "Easter tiki
heads," are available for $390 each a week.</TE>
<TE>   And heads up, Easter Islanders: The fake statues are becoming
increasingly popular for music videos and parties, Chai said.</TE>

<HD>Baylor, Olowokandi Plan to Meet Today</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor is expected to meet with center
Michael Olowokandi and his agent, Bill Duffy, today at an undisclosed
Southland location.</LD>
<LD>   Baylor is expecting to hear Olowokandi apologize for last week's
remarks about his lack of a contract for next season and its impact
on the team's recent play.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Olowokandi and Duffy are expected to ask Baylor for a
reduction in the $50,000 fine imposed on Olowokandi for his comments
following the Clippers' loss April 3 against the Utah Jazz.</LD>
<TE>   "We didn't play well together," Olowokandi said after missing 13
of 15 shots in the loss to the Jazz, which effectively knocked the
Clippers from playoff contention. "Whenever you have a group of guys
that are very uncertain of their futures on the team that will always
happen. Whenever you have that situation, you will never have a
basketball team. Not this year, not next year, not 10 years from now.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are very uncertain with the future of this team. It's
starting to affect the way we play the game."</TE>
<TE>   Baylor fined Olowokandi, eligible to become a restricted free
agent this summer, two days later. They spoke for a few minutes in
the locker room after the Clippers' 22-point victory Sunday over the
Denver Nuggets.</TE>
<TE>   Baylor has indicated that he would like to re-sign Olowokandi,
calling him an important part of the franchise's future. Olowokandi
has said he would like to remain a Clipper. Formal negotiations can
begin July 1, with the signing period starting July 16.</TE>

<HD>Felix Is Fast Changing Ways in Sprints</HD>

<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Were it not for an above-average start in the L.A. Invitational
indoor track and field meet in February, junior Allyson Felix of
North Hills L.A. Baptist High might be running in the girls' 400
meters rather than the 100 and 200 on Saturday night in the Arcadia
Invitational at Arcadia High.</LD>
<LD>   Felix won the 100 in the state championships at Hughes Stadium in
Sacramento last June and is the defending Arcadia champion in that
event and the 200. But she wasn't known for having a quick start.</LD>
<LD>   That and the fact that her long legs make her ideally suited to
running the 400 had Felix and L.A. Baptist sprint coach Jonathan
Patton contemplating a switch to the one-lap race this season.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not like she has a horrible start," Patton said. "But she's
never going to have a great start. She's not that tall, but she has
long legs and that will prevent her from getting out of the blocks as
quickly as some sprinters."</TE>
<TE>   So when Felix settled into the blocks for the start of the girls'
50 in the L.A. Invitational at the Sports Arena on Feb. 23, she
figured she'd have to chase down competitors such as Shalonda Solomon
of Long Beach Poly in the final 10 meters of the race to win.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Felix, whose brother Wes is a freshman sprinter at USC, got off to
one of the best starts of her career and ran 6.43 seconds to win
easily and move into a four-way tie for sixth on the all-time
national performer list.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when it all clicked," said the mild-mannered Felix. "We
were thinking about moving up to the 400, but when everything came
together in that race, we decided to continue running the 100."</TE>
<TE>   It was a wise move.</TE>
<TE>   Felix won the 60 and placed second in the 200 in the National
Scholastic Indoor Championships at the Armory Track &amp; Field Center in
New York City in early March and posted yearly state-leading outdoor
times of 11.56 in the 100 and 23.62 in the 200 in the Pasadena Games
at Pasadena City College on March 30.</TE>
<TE>   "All that time she spent in the weight room [since the end of her
freshman season] is paying off," Patton said. "Her improved body
mechanics and strength are allowing her to start well."</TE>
<TE>   This doesn't mean the 5-foot-7 Felix has forgotten the 400.</TE>
<TE>   She won the event in a career-best 55.01 in the Oakland Relays at
UC Berkeley on Saturday and followed that with a scorching 52.9 split
in the 1,600 relay.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked at the [open 400] as a good workout," Felix said about
her performance that moved her to third on the yearly state list.
"The relay felt a whole lot better. There were some teams ahead of me
so I was able to go out hard and try to catch them."</TE>
<TE>   Catching people has never been a problem for Felix.</TE>
<TE>   She displayed superb top-end speed while clocking 12.19 in the 100
and 23.90 in the 200 during her first season of competitive track as
an L.A. Baptist freshman.</TE>
<TE>   She was even faster last year as her bests of 11.53 in the 100 and
23.31 in the 200 moved her to seventh and ninth, respectively, on the
all-time Southern Section lists.</TE>
<TE>   Her victory in the 100 and second-place finish to Angel Perkins of
Cerritos Gahr in the 200 at the state championships single-handedly
helped L.A. Baptist tie for fifth in the team standings. But running
in the semifinals of the women's 200 in the USA Track &amp; Field
Championships in Eugene, Ore., in late June and winning the 100 in
the World Youth (age 17 and under) championships in Debrecen,
Hungary, in mid-July did wonders for her confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "Running in those meets helped make me more well-rounded," Felix
said. "Being out there with athletes of that caliber will make it
feel a lot more normal the next time it happens. I'll be a lot more
comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Feeling comfortable around Felix isn't difficult.</TE>
<TE>   She has an easy-going, unassuming demeanor and is quick to smile.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a great ambassador for the sport, the school and the
[sprints]," Patton said. "She's approachable, she's dignified and
she's respectful of others."</TE>
<TE>   Which is pleasing to her father.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never really seen her get excited about things," said Paul
Felix, a professor in the New Testament department of The Master's
Seminary in Sun Valley. "I know she's pleased when she runs well, but
she's not one to throw up her arms or pump her fists."</TE>

<LD>A couple of months ago, Miss Guts looked like a filly who may never
win a race.</LD>
<LD>   Now, it seems like the 3-year-old daughter of American Chance
might never lose again.</LD>
<LD>   A nine-time loser against maidens, including four defeats as the
favorite, Miss Guts has blossomed in the last five weeks.</LD>
<TE>   After finally earning her maiden victory by a length at 5-2 on
March 6, she has beaten $40,000 claimers by 11 lengths, then
switching to the turf, she re-rallied to win by three-quarters by a
length over perfect tripper Anima Mundi as the 2-1 second choice.</TE>
<TE>   She has three victories in a span of 23 days and she'll try to
keep the streak going today as she takes on seven other 3-year-old
fillies at about 61/2 furlongs on the turf. The race is the second
leg of a pick six that has a massive carryover of $462,042.78.</TE>
<TE>   Since her last race, Miss Guts has had a change of address. She
was purchased privately from Barry Abrams by owner Lloyd DeBruycker
and is now in the John Sadler barn.</TE>
<TE>   Her main opposition in the $53,000 race figures to come from
Carinae, who disappointed as the favorite in the La Habra Stakes last
month, but who fits off her first start in this country.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: California shippers Thady Quill and Touch Of The
Blues are part of a classy field in the $200,000 Maker's Mark Mile at
Keeneland.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: California shippers. Horses based in the state won
three races at Keeneland under jockey Kent Desormeaux (Beefeater
Baby, Tates Creek and Sharbayan) and the Ian Jory-trained Explicit
won the $150,000 Count Fleet Sprint Handicap at Oaklawn Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: John Quiles and Scott Everett. The two trainers, who
compete in New York, are a combined 0 for 43 in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Test The Waters, Mabel
Kent and Con Spirito in the seventh, Missionairess, Seream and
Emerald Monique in the eighth and Greeley Creek and Love Factor in
the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet Total: 4/215. Money: Previous day/meet
Total: $23.20/$1,250.20. Total money bet: $1,322.</TE>

<LD>Shaquille O'Neal was fined for missing Wednesday morning's practice,
despite claiming that he stayed home because of a migraine headache
and stomach ailment.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Phil Jackson, who issues nominal fines in such
circumstances, believed instead that O'Neal was still angry about his
ejection the night before, when he was called for a second technical
foul after tangling with Utah center Jarron Collins.</LD>
<LD>   That O'Neal attended an affair for Burger King in Las Vegas on
Wednesday night would appear to support Jackson's theory of
emotional, rather than physical, distress.</LD>
<TE>   "I take my punishment like a man," O'Neal said before Thursday
night's game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. "I got nothing to
say."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson did not seem particularly upset by O'Neal's absence. In
fact, he said he and his center spoke Wednesday and again Thursday,
in part discussing the defensive tactics that caused O'Neal to slam
his elbow into Collins.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't get into it with him about the physical health," Jackson
said. "He missed practice without an excuse."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal left Staples Center early Wednesday night, as or before his
teammates left the floor, and well before reporters were allowed into
the locker room. While Jackson would have preferred O'Neal to have
stayed for any postgame instructions, the practice was the greater
issue and the cause of the fine.</TE>
<TE>   "The nature of the ejection was something he didn't want to talk
about, because he ... didn't feel comfortable with what he'd have to
say," Jackson said. "It was obviously something that gets under your
skin when players are up underneath you all the time and then you get
called for something as incidental as the contact that happened after
a foul. I'm sure he would have said some things that would have
created difficult things."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he was satisfied that the day off--excused or
not--had cleared O'Neal's head.</TE>
<TE>   "We discussed it [Wednesday]," he said. "We had an opportunity
today to talk a little about it and I think he's in a good mind-set
now."</TE>
<TE>   The last time O'Neal was fined for skipping a practice--that time
for the birth of his daughter--he blasted Jackson. "That fine?" he
had said. "That [expletive] knows what he can do with that fine."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Devean George, who was born and raised in Minneapolis, said he was
in high school before he learned the Los Angeles Lakers once played
in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a little before my time," said George, born 17 years
after the Lakers moved away. "The Minnesota team was the
Timberwolves. Pooh Richardson and those guys."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal will host a fund-raiser tonight at the new Palm Restaurant
in downtown Los Angeles to benefit Kidz Educational Experience, The
Odessa Chambliss Foundation and the Staples Center Foundation.

<LD>Owner-trainer Laura Lukas will be busy during the latter portion of
the 10-race program tonight at Los Alamitos.</LD>
<LD>   Lukas, wife of Wayne Lukas, who is also her co-owner, is scheduled
to run five horses in the three trials for the $155,400 El Primero

Bob.</LD>
<TE>   The better of the 3-year-olds is Bobcat Bob, who will be making
his first start since he was second Nov. 30. First or second in six
of his 10 races, the Chicks Beduino gelding will be ridden by Jacky
Martin.</TE>
<TE>   In the eighth, the Lukases' duo of Check Him Out and Hot As Hell
is the 4-5 favorite. Check Him Out won four of nine as a 2-year-old,
including a victory at 8-1 in the Ed Burke Futurity last summer.</TE>
<TE>   The other entrant for the Lukas barn is Bucky Bounce, a 20-1 shot
in the third and final trial, a race headed by 9-5 favorite Chicks
Rapidash and Dont Dink With Me.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Ponderosa Ruby. 2. Onlyinyourdreams. 3. Suzy Cartel.
4. Calldownthelaw. 5. Ribbons Of Darkness. 6. Corwyn Duchess. 7.

<HD>A Banner Night for All the Lakers</HD>
<DH>Basketball: Minneapolis Lakers are recognized at halftime
ceremony. Says Magic: 'It's about time.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 8:51 Thursday night, a separation that stretched across half a
continent, four decades and eight championships finally ended.</LD>
<LD>   Surrounded by family, friends and fans, the Lakers--the original
Lakers, the Minneapolis Lakers--took their place on the Staples
Center wall, their accomplishments trumpeted alongside those of the
Los Angeles Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   Owner Jerry Buss, taking a step  avoided by previous owners Bob
Short and Jack Kent Cooke, had two banners unveiled at halftime, one
for the five championships won by the Lakers over a six-season span
from the 1948-49 season to 1953-54. The other banner honors the five
Hall of Famers who played on those teams--George Mikan, Slater
Martin, Jim Pollard, Vern Mikkelsen and Clyde Lovellette--and their
Hall of Fame coach, John Kundla.</LD>
<TE>   The five living honorees were all on hand. Pollard, who died in
1993, was represented by his widow, Arlee.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about time," said Magic Johnson, who took part in the
ceremony. "I wanted to thank them for what they started. We are all
together now. We are all Lakers. It's long overdue."</TE>
<TE>   No argument from Buss.</TE>
<TE>   "This puts it all together," he said. "I like the completeness of
it all. It should have been done before, but I didn't recognize the
necessity. Now I really feel the continuity of the organization."</TE>
<TE>   Mikkelsen, 73, was shaking his head Thursday at his reaction when
he first heard the Lakers were moving west.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think they would get to Sioux Falls, much less L.A.,"
Mikkelsen said. "That's why I decided not to come here."</TE>
<TE>   Mikkelsen called Thursday's festivities " a total treasure for us
and the greatest time for me."</TE>
<TE>   Kundla, 85, admitted he didn't even want to be a part of the old
Lakers at first.</TE>
<TE>   "They couldn't get a coach," he said. "I turned them down three
times. I didn't think pro ball would make it in Minneapolis because
of the University of Minnesota."</TE>
<TE>   And what changed his mind?</TE>
<TE>   "They doubled my salary," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kundla had been making $3,000 a year coaching at the collegiate
level at St. Thomas in Minneapolis. The Lakers gave him a three-year
deal worth $18,000.</TE>
<TE>   The salary of Mikan, the game's first superstar, peaked at double
what his coach was making, $12,000 per year.</TE>
<TE>   In a ceremony orchestrated by team officials Jeanie Buss and Linda
Rambis, each of the honorees received a championship ring--a
nonexistent item in their era--presented by a latter-day counterpart.
Kundla received his ring from Bill Sharman, Pollard's widow from
Mitch Kupchak, Martin from Jerry West, Mikkelsen from James Worthy,
Lovellette from Johnson and Mikan from Elgin Baylor.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day," Johnson said, "in terms of money, they
did not have a lot to show for it. We should be taking care of them,
honoring them. They paved the way for all of us who followed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the greatest days in Laker history. We say the
Lakers are family. Now we are showing it."</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Memphis Coach Sidney Lowe has relied on his reserves in the fourth
quarter recently in hopes of getting them experience.</LD>
<LD>   Thursday night, Pau Gasol scored 23 points, but it was a pair of
three-point baskets by key reserve Antonis Fotsis in the last 2:16
that helped the Memphis Grizzlies hold on to defeat the Portland
Trail Blazers, 102-99, at Memphis, Tenn.</LD>
<LD>   Fotsis' long-range shot from the left baseline with 44.2 left gave
Memphis a 99-97 lead. Gasol and Will Solomon, another reserve,
combined to make three of four free throws in the last 19 seconds.</LD>
<TE>   "I stuck with those guys to give them experience in a big-game
situation, and they pulled it out," Lowe said. "We played pretty good
defensively all night. Fotsis hit two big shots in the corner, Pau
made some big shots down the stretch.... It was a great win, and it
was good to see those guys pull it out."</TE>
<TE>   Gasol made nine of 15 shots from the field and grabbed eight
rebounds as six Grizzlies finished in double figures. Stromile Swift
scored 17, and Shane Battier and Solomon finished with 12 each.
Lorenzen Wright scored 11 points and grabbed 10 rebounds as the
Grizzlies won their third consecutive home game.</TE>
<TE>   Portland has lost three in a row and six of eight.</TE>
<TE>   "We came out in the beginning with intensity," Portland Coach
Maurice Cheeks said. "Our intensity slipped a little, and they made
shots, especially down the stretch."</TE>
<TE>   Five Trail Blazers finished in double figures, led by Rasheed
Wallace's 22 points and 19 by Derek Anderson, who made six of 10 from
the floor. Bonzi Wells scored 18 points, and Ruben Patterson finished
with 15.</TE>
<TE>   Portland forward Scottie Pippen served a one-game suspension for
taking a swing at Maverick guard Nick Van Exel in the Trail Blazers'
108-96 loss to Dallas on Tuesday. Pippen also was fined $7,500.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 97, Phoenix 96--Three weeks past his 40th birthday, John
Stockton made all eight shots he took from the field, scored 18
points and handed out 11 assists as the Jazz ended a three-game
losing streak with a victory at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA's oldest active player scored nine in the fourth quarter
on four driving layups. The last one was a three-point play that put
Utah up, 97-88, with 1:34 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Stockton had three steals and no turnovers in 37 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Suns scored the last eight points, the first five by Stephon
Marbury, and cut it to 97-96 on a three-pointer by another NBA
old-timer, Dan Majerle, with 30 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Majerle, retiring at the end of the season, missed an open
three-pointer at the buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 104, New York 101--Tyson Chandler's dunk with 1:39
remaining in overtime, and two free throws by fellow rookie Eddy
Curry with 12 seconds left provided the winning margin for the Bulls
at New York.</TE>
<TE>   The Knicks took their only lead of overtime, 101-100, on Mark
Jackson's three-pointer with 1:51 left.</TE>
<TE>   It was the 15th consecutive game the Knicks have lost when giving
up at least 100 points.</TE>
<TE>   Chandler led the Bulls' seven double-digit scorers with 16 points.
He also had a career-high 15 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "This win means a lot to us," said Chandler, a former Compton
Dominguez High standout. "To be on the floor of Madison Square
Garden, you feel proud to be wearing a jersey playing against the
Knicks."</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 101, Orlando 99--Ken- yon Martin had 26 points, a
season-high seven assists and a game-saving block in overtime at
Orlando, Fla., and the Nets defeated the Magic..</TE>
<TE>   Keith Van Horn had 19 points and 14 rebounds, and Jason Kidd had a
career-high with 16 rebounds to go with 13 points and seven assists.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets, winners of four of five, reduced their magic number to
clinch the Eastern Conference to one.</TE>
<TE>   "It was probably one of our biggest wins of the year," Van Horn
said. "You can't ask for a better scenario, going into the playoffs
at a high level."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy McGrady had 39 points, 16 rebounds and seven assists for the
Magic, which had its five-game home winning streak ended.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 98, Dallas 95--Steve Francis hit a long jumper to break a
tie with 1:35 left in overtime at Dallas, then set up a three-pointer
by Eddie Griffin as the Rockets overcame a 20-point deficit to defeat
the Mavericks.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Van Exel got his team back within three with a layup, but the
Mavericks missed two chances to tie it in the closing seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Francis had 14 of his 20 points after the third quarter as Houston
ended a four-game losing streak and won for the third time in 14
games.</TE>
<TE>   "They played harder than we did in the second half," Van Exel
said. "They wanted it more. They came at us first with their
pick-and-roll game, then with their isolation game and kicked us
around."</TE>

<DL>VANCOUVER, Canada</DL>
<LD>Hours before the start of Thursday night's showdown with the
Vancouver Canucks, King Coach Andy Murray said, "It's crunch time for
our team and your best players have to be your best players."</LD>
<LD>   Murray couldn't have been more of a prophet.</LD>
<LD>   Vancouver's leading goal scorer, Markus Naslund, stepped up with
three goals in the third period, while the Kings' top goal scorer,
Ziggy Palffy, had none in the Canucks' 5-2 victory in front of a
sellout crowd of 18,422 at General Motors Place.</LD>
<TE>   It wouldn't be fair to say that Palffy's inability to score is the
reason why the Kings are still one point away from clinching a
Western Conference playoff berth. That's because he wasn't the only
King not to play his best Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "They just played harder than we did," King goaltender Felix
Potvin said. "They were ready to play and took the game to us....
[Naslund and Todd Bertuzzi] have played really good all year and they
continued to play like the hottest line in hockey tonight."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings' top players also came into the game on a bit of a
streak. With 16 of his team-high 31 goals in his previous 24 games,
Palffy began Thursday's game as one of the hottest scorers in the
league, and leading scorer Jason Allison rode a five-game scoring
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Allison finished with an assist on a late third period goal by
Adam Deadmarsh, but other than that, the Kings' big guns came up
empty.</TE>
<TE>   "We were playing a little scared where we were not taking the play
to them," Allison said. "We had more confidence the last time we
played them. We came out too worried about not getting scored on or
too afraid to make a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   When things go wrong for the Kings, it's usually Palffy who takes
most of the heat because of his superb offensive skills.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a dominating player when he wants to be," said King left
wing Craig Johnson, who skated on a line with Palffy against the
Canucks. "I've never seen anyone move laterally as well as he
does.... He's by far one of the elite players in the league."</TE>
<TE>   But it had been more than Palffy's scoring that has impressed the
Kings lately. Generously listed at 5 feet 10, 180 pounds, Palffy is
not known for throwing his weight around. But since Los Angeles began
its drive for the playoffs, Palffy has not been shy to mix it up.</TE>
<TE>   "The early part of the season, he was playing injured," King
General Manager Dave Taylor said about Palffy, who sat out 19 games
over the first three months of the season. "He was injured coming out
of training camp with a shoulder injury and then he missed about a
month with a rib injury. But since the Olympic break, he's played
really well.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been very conscious to play within the team system.
Obviously, he is known for his offensive ability with his goal
scoring and playmaking skills."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Palffy was a marked man. Every time Palffy took the
ice, Vancouver defenseman Ed Jovanovski shadowed him.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Kings had a great deal of success skating Palffy on a
line with Allison and Adam Deadmarsh for the couple of weeks after
the Olympics, Murray has had Palffy work with Bryan Smolinski and
Johnson lately.</TE>
<TE>   "It's gives our team more balance," Murray said. "You can't put
your strongest defense pair against both Allison and Palffy. We think
Cliff Ronning [who skated with Allison and Deadmarsh] is a real good
player."</TE>
<TE>   Against the Canucks, Palffy had a difficult time getting loose.
With Jovanovski hounding him, Palffy threw a no-hitter in the first
period. He was on the ice for 6 minutes 21 seconds and did not record
a shot or a hit.</TE>
<TE>   In the second period it was more of the same.</TE>
<TE>   With the Kings limited to only three shots on goal in the period,
Murray tried to get more opportunities for Palffy by double-shifting
him.</TE>
<TE>   But the results did not change much. Palffy recorded his first
shot on goal along with a turnover.</TE>
<TE>   For the Kings to be a factor in the playoffs, Palffy has to be a
force on a regular basis.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been playing hard physically," Murray said. "He has laid
body on some people.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been blocking shots and backchecking, but we need to see
that every game. You are only as good as your next game, not your
last game."</TE>

<HD>9 Seized in INS Sweep at San Diego Airport</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Nine workers with access to restricted areas at Lindbergh Field, the
city's international airport, were arrested this week by the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service on a variety of immigration
charges as part of a national enforcement effort prompted by the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Four of the nine were illegal immigrants. The other five were
foreign nationals with criminal records for drugs, domestic violence
or theft. The criminal convictions, which were not disclosed on
employment applications, could result in deportation, the INS said.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of workers at airports across the country have been
arrested in recent weeks under an INS crackdown called Operation
Tarmac.</LD>
<TE>   The nine Lindbergh Field workers were employed by private firms
hired by the airport. None were employees of the Unified Port
District of San Diego, the public agency that owns and controls the
airport on the edge of downtown San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no indication that any of the nine has any ties to
terrorist groups," said INS spokeswoman Lauren Mack.</TE>
<TE>   INS agents reviewed employment records of 1,568 employees from 87
companies that provide services at the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Under a 1986 federal law, employers who knowingly hire illegal
immigrants face fines and possible criminal prosecution. But
employers complain that their ability to detect fraudulent
applications is limited.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Shultz, spokesman for the port district, said all airport
workers are screened by the agency. "Because we are not a federal
agency, we don't have the same power to dig as deeply into people's
backgrounds as the INS," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The nine worked for companies providing food delivery, janitorial
service and cargo assistance. Of the nine, three have been charged
with immigration offenses; the others face probable deportation.</TE>
<TE>   Lindbergh Field had one of the smallest number of workers
apprehended of any of the airports targeted by the INS. At Logan
International Airport in Boston, where terrorists hijacked two planes
used in the Sept. 11 attacks, 20 workers were apprehended two weeks
ago on immigration violations.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the federal takeover of airport security, a retired
Marine general has been selected to head security at Lindbergh Field.</TE>

<HD>Van Dam Suspect Raised Suspicions Early in Case</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Documents filed Thursday in the case against David Westerfield reveal
that a police lie-detector specialist interviewed him two days after
7-year-old Danielle van Dam disappeared and concluded he was lying
when he denied being involved.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Redden, who has administered polygraph tests for two decades,
was "convinced the defendant was deceptive when he stated he was not
in any way responsible for Danielle's disappearance," according to
the documents.</LD>
<LD>   Police have said DNA evidence links Westerfield to the crime but
have declined to say publicly whether he was given a lie-detector
test.</LD>
<TE>   Key words and sections in the documents filed by prosecutors are
blacked out, so that it is impossible to tell conclusively from the
papers whether Westerfield took a polygraph test.</TE>
<TE>   But they also indicate he signed a consent form before his
interview with Redden and that the interview was tape-recorded, both
standard procedures during polygraph tests but not during routine
police interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Though lie-detector tests are not admissible in court, police
often use them to pressure or rule out suspects. Danielle van Dam's
mother and father took and passed lie-detector tests, police have
said.</TE>
<TE>   First interviewed on Feb. 4, Westerfield, 50, a self-employed
engineer and a neighbor of the Van Dams, was arrested Feb. 22.
Danielle's nude body was found in a rural area of the county Feb. 27.
Westerfield is charged with kidnapping and murder.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours of Redden's interview, police got a warrant to search
Westerfield's home more thoroughly than they had in a preliminary
search.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to show police where he had spent the two days after
Danielle disappeared, Westerfield took them on a 14-hour journey from
his home in San Diego to a desert camping area of Imperial County and
to a parking lot at Silver Strand beach near Coronado.</TE>
<TE>   The new information about the Redden interview came in documents
filed by prosecutors in opposition to motions filed by Westerfield's
attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   The defense attorneys want Superior Court Judge William Mudd to
order prosecutors to disclose the personnel files of 13 officers
involved in the investigation, particularly any allegations that they
have been untruthful, used coercive or brutal tactics in other cases,
or violated the rights of suspects during interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield's attorneys claim their client was coerced by repeated
questioning and false statements by police into making false but
incriminating statements. Mudd has set a hearing for next month on
the motions.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield lived two houses from the Van Dam family in the Sabre
Springs neighborhood. His home has since been deeded to his attorneys
and put up for sale.</TE>

<HD>Extension of Power Price Caps Urged</HD>
<DH>Energy: California officials tell a U.S. Senate panel that
the state's economic stability depends on keeping to limits imposed
by FERC.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>California could again experience blackouts and runaway power costs
unless federal regulators extend temporary price limits on
electricity imposed throughout the West last year, state officials
warned Congress Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis initially had given a cool reception to the
flexible price limits set by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, saying that they fell short of his call for direct
price-setting.</LD>
<LD>   But California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch
and California Power Authority Chairman S. David Freeman told the
Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee that the price
limits have proven effective and that the state's economic stability
depends on extending them beyond their Sept. 30 expiration date.</LD>
<TE>   "If the price caps come off, it will endanger the health of the
utilities," Lynch said. "Enron and its followers will roar back with
a vengeance Oct. 1," leading to blackouts and price increases.</TE>
<TE>   "It is impossible for California alone to control how power plants
throughout the West operate," said Freeman, a top energy advisor to
Davis. "These controls have worked reasonably well. There is no basis
to stop them on Sept. 30."</TE>
<TE>   Lynch and Freeman testified at a hearing on the role played by
Enron Corp. in the California energy crisis. Several witnesses said
the now-bankrupt energy trading giant did have the means, motive and
ability to manipulate the California market. However, they conceded a
lack of conclusive evidence to blame the state's woes on the
company's actions.</TE>
<TE>   No Enron representatives were invited to the hearing. The company
has denied any manipulation, saying that California's experience was
due to the structure of the market, not Enron's influence.</TE>
<TE>   The federal price limits represent a rare example of appointees of
President Bush setting aside free-market rhetoric to wield the
government's regulatory clout. Though FERC has the power to set
prices for wholesale electricity, the agency remained aloof from
California's troubles last year. But under pressure from both
Republicans and Democrats in Congress, it finally limited price
spikes and required power generators to sell upon demand.</TE>
<TE>   Extending the price limits "is something we have to home in on,"
said Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who requested Thursday's hearing.
"If they don't preserve these, we could be back in deep trouble."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Rep. Doug Ose (R-Sacramento) said Republican
members of the state's congressional delegation would support an
extension of the price limits. Ose was one of several lawmakers who
urged FERC to act last summer.</TE>
<TE>   What FERC will do this fall, however, remains unclear. Agency head
Patrick H. Wood III has publicly said that he would like to see a
deregulated market restored in California, but the threat of a
political backlash in the West during the congressional midterm
elections may force FERC to maintain the basic framework now in
place.</TE>
<TE>   Establishing Enron's part in the California energy crisis remains
an elusive goal. Investigators would have to establish that the
actions of traders were part of a strategy led by top corporate
officers.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) told the committee that Enron
has impeded the efforts of the California Legislature to gain access
to internal documents that could answer some questions.</TE>
<TE>   "Do we know whether Enron exercised its market power in an attempt
to increase prices during the market crisis that occurred between May
2000 and July 2001?" asked energy consultant Robert McCullough, a
critic of the company. "No."</TE>
<TE>   What is known so far raises concerns, Lynch said. The company had
aggressively pushed for deregulation of California's market under
terms that would give power marketers maximum flexibility. Once
prices began soaring, Enron used its clout in Washington to argue
against federal intervention.</TE>
<TE>   In late 2000, Enron accounted for about 30% of sales and purchases
at major California power trading hubs. That stake certainly gave the
company the ability to influence markets, McCullough said.</TE>
<TE>   Around that time, Lynch said, five Enron subsidiaries bought and
sold nearly 12 million megawatt-hours of electricity from each other,
artificially driving up the price with each sale. Since Enron also
operated an online system used by most energy sellers, the
transactions among affiliates probably helped drive the broader
market higher.</TE>
<TE>   "They used us as a cash cow to keep that company afloat so that
insiders could sell their stock," Boxer said.</TE>
<TE>   But other members of the panel remained skeptical. "I haven't seen
much in the way of evidence that [Enron] derived much in the way of
earnings from trading energy," said Sen. Peter Fitzgerald (R-Ill.),
an Enron critic. "Most of it seems to come from [accounting]
Ponzi-scheme operations."</TE>

<HD>Defense Says Man Who Later Died of Overdose Killed Ventura
Clerk</HD>
<DH>Courts: Lawyer contends wrong man was charged in the fatal
shooting at a store. He says client is a drug dealer and thief, but
not a killer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A defense lawyer told jurors Thursday that prosecutors charged the
wrong man with murder in the fatal shooting of a Ventura grocery
clerk last spring.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Geise is a small-time drug dealer and a petty thief, but
not a killer, attorney Willard Wiksell told the jury. He blamed the
crime instead on a man who died of a drug overdose several months
ago.</LD>
<LD>   Geise, a 32-year-old former Ojai resident, is charged with one
count of murder, two counts of attempted murder and several other
charges stemming from the April 6, 2001, shooting at Central Market
on Ventura Avenue.</LD>
<TE>   Store employee Alejandro Alvarez, 35, was killed and two
co-workers were injured after a pair of gunmen wearing gas masks
demanded money during a midday robbery attempt and began shooting. No
money was taken.</TE>
<TE>   Police linked the crime to Geise and his cousin, Alfonso Delgado,
after seizing weapons and ammunition similar to those used in the
shooting from a Ventura hotel room where Geise was living.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Don Glynn told jurors in his opening
statement Thursday that a firearm expert will testify that a shell
casing found at the market "absolutely matched" a .40-caliber gun
found in Geise's hotel room.</TE>
<TE>   The expert will further testify that the casing, as well as
ammunition seized at the hotel and at Geise's former Ojai residence,
all bore the same manufacturer's stamp, Glynn said.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the physical evidence, Geise's girlfriend is expected to
testify that one month before the shooting she saw the defendant tuck
a gun into the waistband of his pants.</TE>
<TE>   She is also expected to testify that Geise left the hotel shortly
before the botched robbery, telling her: "I'm going out to make some
money."</TE>
<TE>   But Wiksell told jurors the case is not as obvious as it may seem.</TE>
<TE>   "The prosecution has it half right," Wiksell said, telling jurors
that Delgado, who was killed by police during a May shootout, was one
of the masked gunmen who stormed the market.</TE>
<TE>   Wiksell identified the second gunman as Sam Patterson, a friend of
Delgado's, who he said went to Geise's hotel room with Delgado after
the shooting. Patterson died of a drug overdose a few months later.</TE>
<TE>   The defense intends to show that Delgado and Patterson were seen
together in the Ventura Avenue area prior to the shooting, while
Geise was across town meeting with his ex-wife about child custody
issues.</TE>
<TE>   Wiksell told jurors he intends to call the ex-wife as a witness,
and a heroin user who he said bought drugs from Geise within an hour
of the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The defense contends the drug deal explains Geise's remark to his
girlfriend about making some money that day.</TE>
<TE>   Wiksell said Geise would also take the stand.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony got underway Thursday as the prosecution called its
first witnesses, including the two injured co-workers who were
staffing the cash register at Central Market the day of the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The trial in Ventura County Superior Court is expected to last
several weeks.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Reports of Anti-Arab Bias Up in '01</HD>
<DH>9/11: The increase pushed total complaints filed by people
of Middle Eastern heritage to 69, compared to eight in 2000. It was
the most since the Gulf War.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County authorities recorded a surge in reports of harassment
filed by people of Middle Eastern heritage in the wake of the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks, according to a Human Relations Commission
report released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Sixty-nine people said they were the targets of some form of
anti-Arab bigotry last year, compared to eight a year earlier. The
cases ranged from a woman who said she received a harassing phone
call, to a man who was severely beaten outside a bar.</LD>
<LD>   Not since 1991, at the height of the Persian Gulf War, has the
commission found such a large number of reported incidents against
Muslims. Dramatic events can result in more hate crimes, and they can
prompt more people to report such incidents.</LD>
<TE>   Then, as now, people are riding "an emotional wave," sometimes
letting their emotions drive their behavior, said Rusty Kennedy, the
commission's executive director, adding that the number of incidents
dropped off significantly after September.</TE>
<TE>   There were 179 cases of alleged bigotry listed in the report on
2001, up from 122 in 2000, but not all were classified as "hate
crimes" by prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-eight cases were referred to the district attorney's office
for prosecution. Charges were filed in eight of the incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Other incidents went unreported but still rattled nerves.</TE>
<TE>   Ramanand Jaa, a Fullerton engineer from India, said he was
shopping at a market specializing in Middle Eastern food soon after
Sept. 11 when a motorist yelled, "Go back home!"</TE>
<TE>   Jaa, who did not report the incident, said, "I knew the feelings
involved and I just went on my way." Indians and East Indians also
reported being blamed for the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The number of reported hate incidents aimed at Latinos doubled
from the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy said he suspected that Latinos may have been swept up in
anti-Arab feelings by people who misidentified them as being from the
Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   One of the more severe incidents reported to the commission
occurred when an East Indian family attending a birthday celebration
Oct. 21 was attacked after they left an Anaheim karaoke club.</TE>
<TE>   A group of youths taunted the family with racist remarks, then
attacked them. Several family members suffered injuries, including a
broken jaw and other broken bones, according to the commission
report.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Mike Fell said the public doesn't often understand the
evidence needed to file a hate-crimes charge.</TE>
<TE>   If someone yells a racial epithet without threatening harm, the
act is protected under the 1st Amendment and is not a crime, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors consider it a hate crime if the action interferes, by
force or violence, with someone's constitutional rights, Fell said.</TE>
<TE>   To address any unease, the commission has started a series of
living-room dialogues in which residents of different cultures get
together for evening talks.</TE>

<HD>Priest's Rape Case Expected to Go to Deliberations Today</HD>
<DH>Crime: The cleric, charged with sexually abusing a teenage
girl in 1977, could face eight years in prison.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA ROSA</DL>
<LD>A Roman Catholic priest on trial for allegedly raping one teenage
girl and molesting another more than two decades ago used "his
priestly collar" and youth counseling position to criminally abuse
his victims, a prosecutor charged Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   But in closing arguments, a defense lawyer for Father Donald
Kimball, 58, countered that the women "embellished and exaggerated"
their claims in an effort that two years ago yielded a $1.6-million
civil settlement with the local diocese.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, one of Kimball's accusers said outside court that she
mostly wants an apology from the former youth pastor and will accept
whatever verdict is delivered by the jury, which is expected to begin
deliberations today.</LD>
<TE>   "All my life I've lived with this," said the 38-year-old woman,
who alleges she was raped behind the altar of a Santa Rosa church in
1977 at age 14 by Kimball, who then arranged an abortion for her. "It
doesn't matter what the verdict is. I'm letting go."</TE>
<TE>   The case is among the first in the nation to go to trial since
widespread revelations began surfacing earlier this year of sexual
misconduct by Catholic priests throughout the U.S. In many cases, the
molestations took place decades ago. In the Santa Rosa diocese alone,
six priests have been accused of sexual misconduct over the last
decade, including Kimball.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted of the rape and two separate charges of molesting a
13-year-old girl in 1981 during his tenure as a priest, Kimball could
face more than eight years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Medvigy argued Thursday that Kimball used
his priestly collar, status as a counselor and reputation as the
"rock 'n' roll pastor" who understood youth to attract a flock of
admirers he then exploited.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor said Kimball had displayed a pattern of abuse. In
all, eight women stepped forward during the trial to testify that
Kimball had sexually molested them during private counseling sessions
that often took place in his bedroom. Charges were brought in only
two of the cases.</TE>
<TE>   "He took advantage of these kids so he could satisfy his own
prurient interests," Medvigy concluded, adding that Kimball's victims
"had this tortured story locked inside all these years."</TE>
<TE>   After abusing for a decade, Medvigy said, Kimball resigned in 1981
after a pattern of lies unraveled and he finally admitted the
indiscretions to a bishop.</TE>
<TE>   Young parishioners trusted Kimball, who ran a popular radio
program called "God Talk" and mixed rock music with religion in his
youth programs. But he took advantage when they came for counseling,
Medvigy said.</TE>
<TE>   Hugs would lead to massages and finally molestation, the
prosecutor said. The girls largely kept it to themselves, confused
and ashamed.</TE>
<TE>   To the teens, "Don Kimball was on a higher plane," Medvigy said.
"He was nearer to God.... He was someone who in their eyes could do
no wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Chris Andrian tried to shoot holes in the
testimony delivered by Kimball's chief accusers and called into
question their motives.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, Kimball's alleged victims seemed to recall with
startling clarity the tiniest details, but in several instances
claimed to have forgotten key sequences in an effort to "shade it a
little worse than it is," Andrian said in conducting a point-by-point
dissection of testimony offered in the trial, which began in
mid-February.</TE>
<TE>   Andrian focused on the woman who has accused Kimball of rape. He
painted the picture of a victim on a mission to glean a big
settlement from the diocese, and said the woman amended her stories
if caught with conflicting events.</TE>
<TE>   "How do we know today where the truth began and where it ended?"
Andrian said to the jury. He said the woman gave a "litany of
excuses" for lost memories, but suggested that she had been "willing
to make it up as she goes along."</TE>
<TE>   He also questioned the likelihood that Kimball would choose the
church altar as a spot to forcibly rape a young parishioner. Earlier,
Medvigy had said the church doors were locked at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Andrian said the other accuser "had issues with the church" from
an early age as well as a perception that a variety of men were being
sexually inappropriate in their behavior to her as a young teen,
raising a possibility that she could have misconstrued Kimball's
actions.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge in Miami said Thursday that the daughters of the late
President Nixon have a duty to settle a legal dispute over how $20
million donated to his presidential library in Yorba Linda is spent.</LD>
<LD>   Charles "Bebe" Rebozo, Nixon's longtime friend, left the money to
the library foundation when he died in 1998. But Rebozo set up a
committee made up of the two sisters--Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie
Nixon Eisenhower--and another longtime Nixon associate to determine
how the bequest would be used. Since then, the sisters have been at
odds over how the money should be spent. In January, the foundation
filed lawsuits in Florida and California in an attempt to gain
control of the $20 million.</LD>
<LD>   Any court decisions on the Florida suit would be binding only if
Cox and Eisenhower participate in the lawsuit, probate Judge Maria
Korvick said Thursday.</LD>

arrested at his Santa Ana home.</LD>
<LD>   A 12-year-old boy came forward last month with a complaint and
another player followed two weeks ago, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Vaughn was charged with three counts of child molestation. He is
being held on $100,000 bail.</LD>

<LD>A San Diego-area dentist was acquitted Thursday of involuntary
manslaughter in the party drug death of a woman who fell from a Long
Beach hotel balcony.</LD>
<LD>   The Long Beach Superior Court jury also acquitted Kami Hoss, 35,
of a charge that he gave Sandra Rodriguez, 26, of Ontario, the
illegal, mood-altering drug Ecstasy.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors accused Hoss of giving Ecstasy to Rodriguez and two
other women that the dentist and his wife met at a bar in Long Beach.
Authorities alleged that Rodriguez had an adverse reaction to the
drug after returning to Hoss' hotel room for a drink. Hoss allegedly
dragged Rodriguez out of the room when she became ill and left her in
the hall. Her body was found in a flower bed outside the hotel.</LD>

<HD>Assembly Passes County Land Bill</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State legislation allowing Ventura County voters to decide whether to
create an open-space district is on its way to Gov. Gray Davis' desk.</LD>
<LD>   The Assembly on Wednesday passed AB 1145, sponsored by Hannah-Beth
Jackson (D-Santa Barbara), on a vote of 65 to 5. Passed by the Senate
earlier this week, the bill is expected to be signed by Davis in the
next few days.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County supervisors support the bill, which enables them to
place measures creating an open-space district and its funding
mechanism on the same ballot. Current law requires those decisions be
made in separate elections.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm confident the governor will sign. It has broad bipartisan
support and it follows a tradition taken by other counties," Jackson
said. "We are the 10th county that has chosen to pursue an open-space
district."</TE>
<TE>   The district would buy crop land and other undeveloped swaths in
Ventura County for permanent conservation. But voters must agree to
tax themselves to pay for the purchases.</TE>
<TE>   A 41-member advisory committee began meeting Wednesday to hash out
what type of tax should be presented to voters. It will also make
recommendations to the Board of Supervisors next year on how the
district should be governed, and what properties should be targeted
for purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Officials hope to place the measure on the March 2004 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pleased it's moving forward and I look forward to the
governor signing it," said Thousand Oaks-based Supervisor Frank
Schillo, an early supporter of the district.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Steve Bennett said an open-space district is needed to
make sure Ventura County does not lose its semi-rural feel. "It's
Step 2 in the overall game plan of trying to make Ventura County
different from other counties in Southern California." Bennett said.
"It's a county that has been able to effectively keep greenbelt
buffers between the cities and this would ensure that continues."</TE>

<HD>Banning Soda Machines on Campuses Won't Solve This Weighty
Problem</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I visited my high school a few years ago in good ol' Omaha and was
dismayed to see they'd torn out the old lockers, reconfigured the
classrooms and, in short, remodeled the whole dadgum place. I prefer
that things stay the same, even at the scene of my most tortured
teenage moments.</LD>
<LD>   As jarring as those changes were, the biggest shocker was the
vending machines in the student commons area. Soda pop machines on
campus? Inside the school?</LD>
<LD>   During my high school days in the mid-1960s, vending machines on
campus would have been about as likely as slot machines. Drink a Coke
at school? Uh, yeah; how about a little Jack Daniel's to go with it?</LD>
<TE>   The whole point is, I'm really old. Soda vending machines have
been fixtures on high school campuses for many years, sort of like
the teachers. You probably can't find an Orange County high school
that doesn't have them.</TE>
<TE>   Some state legislators, however, want to turn back the clock to
Nebraska 1967. While their intentions may be honorable, they're
sounding as dated as I.</TE>
<TE>   That is, it may be a bit late to put the Coke back in the can.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that teenagers drink pop," Los Alamitos High
School Principal Dan Brooks says, "and if they can't get it on
campus, they will be bringing it on campus anyway. Not having vending
machines is not going to stop them from drinking pop on campus."</TE>
<TE>   I called Los Alamitos on purpose. It's hard to make the argument
that soda pop is corrupting its young, since the school long has been
considered top-drawer academically, athletically and in after-school
offerings.</TE>
<TE>   No one attributes that to drinking Coke (with which the district
has an exclusive contract for the high school campus), but apparently
drinking Coke isn't undermining whatever it is they do over there,
either.</TE>
<TE>   The serious note to strike is that the several Coke machines
around the 2,800-student campus generate revenue for various
academic, athletic and extracurricular teams. Brooks estimates that
the machines pour out more than $15,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   That's only part of the reason Brooks isn't a fan of the proposed
legislation, which would increase the tax on sodas and other
sweetened drinks and give most of the money to schools to defray
their vending-machine losses. The bill's supporters argue that too
many California kids are overweight, and they say the availability of
pop and junk food on campus is part of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   I may be wrong, but I don't get the impression Brooks is out to
undermine the health of his student body.</TE>
<TE>   "We've tried healthy foods," he says. "Our cafeteria staff is very
supportive in offering more nutritious foods, and they stock it, and
the kids won't buy it. It sits there and rots and we lose money."</TE>
<TE>   Teens apparently dislike fruits and yogurt as much as pop quizzes
and Saturday detentions. What they do like, Brooks says, are pizza,
hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, tacos and burritos. And Coke.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks' other argument is that teens who want a tasty carbo after
a day in the salt mines (he didn't say it quite that way) will leave
campus to get it, then return. With so many students staying until 4
or 5 o'clock for practices or rehearsals, he says it's ultimately
safer and saner to let students buy sodas on campus than off.</TE>
<TE>   As a lifetime soda freak who's not getting better with age, I'd
love to counsel the students on the perils of Pepsi. I'll defer,
however, to their parents. That's what the Legislature should do,
too, after a Senate committee's advancement of the bill on a 7-3
vote.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, it would be nice if California kids drank more milk, but
until the Legislature makes that mandatory, it probably won't happen.</TE>
<TE>   The bill's supporters want to portray the schools as enablers of
the students' soft-drink habit, and maybe they are. But only banning
sodas on campus would solve the problem, and legislators aren't
considering that--are they?</TE>
<TE>   With lots to worry about, soda pop isn't one of Brooks' biggies.
"I tend to think kids are going to do what they're going to do," he
says, "and you can't legislate that away."</TE>

<HD>Senate OKs Power Plant Inspections</HD>
<DH>Electricity: Bill would widen state authority over
generators. It goes to Davis, who last year backed stronger version.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- A bill that would give state agents powerful new
authority to inspect wholesale power plants and enforce prohibitions
against price gouging and market manipulation was passed Thursday by
the state Senate and sent to Gov. Gray Davis for his signature.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters suggested that if the industry-opposed legislation had
been law last year, it would have softened the crunch of the energy
crisis that pounded consumers with price increases and rolling
blackouts.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Republicans, who voted against the measure, disagreed. They
attacked it as a foolish attempt by government to meddle in affairs
best left to the marketplace, and blamed the PUC for the energy
crisis.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of extra regulations, "we need a little more freedom,"
argued Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks).</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who supported a stronger version of the bill last year,
favors the thrust of the current legislation, but is unaware of its
details, said spokesman Steve Maviglio.</TE>
<TE>   The bill (SB 39), heavily amended in the Assembly to weaken some
consumer protections, is aimed at giving inspectors of the state
Public Utilities Commission clear legal authority to examine
generating plants of wholesale electricity producers to ensure that
they comply with maintenance and operating standards.</TE>
<TE>   Even without the bill becoming law, PUC inspectors were dispatched
during the energy crisis to visit generating plants. However, the
generators insisted that their operations were exempt from state
regulation, and sued to halt the inspections. The state Supreme Court
refused to hear the case.</TE>
<TE>   During the worst of the energy crisis last year, some wholesale
energy operators cut back on production or temporarily shut down
their plants to perform urgent or unscheduled maintenance. Critics
alleged that the real reason was to create artificial shortages that
drove up the price of electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Generators denied the charges.</TE>
<TE>   PUC President Loretta Lynch, who lobbied for the bill, praised its
passage as establishing a cornerstone in the state's efforts to avoid
blackouts by bringing big players in the wholesale generation
business under PUC regulation.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be a critical tool," she said, "in trying to
stop the gaming of the physical withholding of power that we saw in
2000 and 2001."</TE>
<TE>   Lynch noted that the PUC has fought since December 2000 to get at
generators' records to determine whether power plant production was
manipulated. She said the bill would give the PUC legal access to
such documents.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC has regulatory jurisdiction over private utility companies
but not over the wholesalers who sell power to them. The state's
biggest private utilities--Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric--are fighting to stay alive and
are heavily dependent on obtaining power from outside sources,
including the state.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would apply to nonutility wholesalers, including
California-based companies such as Calpine, as well as out-of-state
generators such as Duke, Dynegy, Mirant and Reliant. The bill would
not apply to a class of wholesalers known as "qualified facilities."
These produce renewable energy from such sources as wind, solar and
biomass.</TE>
<TE>   Carried by Senate leader John L. Burton (D-San Francisco) and
introduced by Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough), the bill was sent
to Davis on a party line 23-13 vote. Democrats cast all the favorable
votes and Republicans voted no.</TE>
<TE>   The bill that emerged from the Legislature was significantly
amended from the legislation as originally written, with some
consumer protection provisions eliminated in the final draft.</TE>
<TE>   Energy wholesalers, represented by the Independent Energy
Producers Assn., lobbied against approval, arguing that the plan
would create an unnecessary new level of bureaucratic regulation.
They also said the PUC had conducted more than 800 inspections of
generating plants but failed to produce "any finding that the plants
are being run in a manner inconsistent with prudent utility
practices."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats countered, however, that new controls were needed to
prevent a repeat of last year's electricity shortages and price
spikes.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the independent producers
organization, said it was uncertain whether his association would sue
to block the legislation if Davis signs it.</TE>
<TE>   "It all depends on how it is implemented. If the PUC becomes
overly intrusive, then individual operators may take them to task,"
he said. "If the standards are not intrusive and allow operators [to
generate power]," then legal action probably would not be taken.</TE>

<HD>San Juan Residents Protest Plan to Close Youth Center</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Money woes doom local Boys &amp; Girls Club.
Parents are upset their kids will have to go to one across town.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dozens of parents and community activists gathered Thursday morning
to protest the impending closure of a Boys &amp; Girls Club in a
predominantly Latino neighborhood of San Juan Capistrano.</LD>
<LD>   The Boys &amp; Girls Club of Capistrano Valley board announced last
month that a $200,000 budget shortfall was forcing the closure of its
El Camino site, which they say is in disrepair and too small to
handle the community's needs.</LD>
<LD>   Parents, who say the club provides needed after-school care,
expressed anger that their children would be bused to another Boys &amp;
Girls Club on the south side of town. The El Camino facility, which
is set to close May 3, sits between an elementary school and the
Capistrano Villas, a dense residential area.</LD>
<TE>   Erica Araiza, a sophomore at Capistrano Valley High School, was
one of more than 100 children who spent Thursday afternoon at the
dilapidated, five-room facility that was once part of the old
Capistrano Union High School. Erica said she will take a bus to the
other club, about two miles away, but worries that others won't leave
their familiar surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's ridiculous that they are closing this place," Araiza
said. "I don't think it's fair to send these kids to the other side
of town. Some of them live next door. We don't ask for much, and we
don't complain. We just want somewhere to go."</TE>
<TE>   Boys &amp; Girls Club officials say they made their decision for
financial reasons. The newer facility is only 2 years old and is in a
city-owned building provided to the club at no charge. The facility
is next to Marco Forster Middle School and serves about 300 children
from three schools.</TE>
<TE>   The El Camino site is a quarter the size and is rented for $850 a
month from the Capistrano Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to raise money to erase the club's shortfall have been
unsuccessful, said Erik Friess, a club board member.</TE>
<TE>   "It's shockingly difficult to raise money," he said. "We thought
we might be able to financially pull off handling two facilities. But
because we don't have a long-term lease at El Camino, we can't make
any capital improvements even if we had the money."</TE>
<TE>   Community leaders presented a plan to the board Thursday to keep
both facilities open. The plan called for community leaders and board
members to work together to raise money and seek corporate sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   "Their proposal back to us was, 'Come up with a plan to raise
$200,000,' " said Nativo Lopez, a Santa Ana school board member and
executive director of Hermandad Mexicana Nacional, an immigrant
rights group.</TE>
<TE>   "The Latino community came forward to support the board and to
tackle the challenge together, not to assume the challenge on its
own," Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said his group hopes to meet with school district officials
in order to get a longer-term lease and the San Juan Capistrano City
Council to request financial assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Friess said the board is considering a proposal that would keep
the El Camino site open until June 3.</TE>
<TE>   But Andy Pedraza, who for six years has been walking to the club a
few blocks from the city's historic mission, wants a long-term
solution.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids that don't go to other places will have nothing to do,"
said Andy, 14. "That'll just put them back on the streets where they
can get into a lot of trouble."</TE>

<HD>Regulators Broke Law, Suit Claims</HD>
<DH>Courts: A consumer group takes on PUC over settlement with
Edison, PG&amp;E plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- A consumer group asked the California Supreme Court
on Thursday to declare that state regulators violated the law when
they entered into a settlement with Southern California Edison and
proposed a reorganization plan for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.</LD>
<LD>   The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights of Santa Monica
alleged that the Public Utilities Commission is a "renegade state
agency" that is illegally committing ratepayers of the two
financially troubled utilities to pay at least $10 billion--or about
$1,150 each--in violation of the 1996 deregulation law that froze
retail electricity rates.</LD>
<LD>   "The PUC is out of control ... wheeling and dealing in secret,"
Harvey Rosenfield, president of the group, said at a news conference
here. "It has been behaving like Enron."</LD>
<TE>   After secret negotiations, the commission in October settled a
federal lawsuit filed by Edison that would permit the utility to
collect more than $3 billion from its customers for power purchases
during the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The commission now is working on its own plan for the
reorganization of PG&amp;E, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection from creditors a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Edison settlement, the PUC plan would cost ratepayers
billions of dollars by artificially extending record rate increases
approved by the commission last year.</TE>
<TE>   PUC General Counsel Gary Cohen said the commission's actions not
only were legal under laws passed during the energy crisis, but also
share the pain of the "deregulation fiasco" among utility
shareholders and ratepayers.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation's lawsuit asks the Supreme Court to declare the
PUC's actions illegal and to force the agency to heed a state
constitutional provision that requires state agencies to obey state
laws.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit does not specifically attempt to prevent the
commission from filing its PG&amp;E reorganization plan as scheduled by
Monday. But it asks the high court to declare the PUC's plan
unlawful, and that could effectively block the agency from sponsoring
a reorganization plan, said attorney Michael Strumwasser, who filed
the suit. He said the high court could hear the suit, reject it or
send it to a state appellate court.</TE>

<HD>Nixon Daughters Urged to Settle Library Dispute</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge in Miami said Thursday that the daughters of the late
President Richard M. Nixon have a duty to settle a legal dispute over
how $20 million donated to Nixon's presidential library in Yorba
Linda is spent.</LD>
<LD>   Charles "Bebe" Rebozo, Nixon's longtime friend, left the money to
the library foundation when he died in 1998. But Rebozo set up a
committee made up of the two sisters and another longtime Nixon
associate to determine exactly how the money is spent. Since then,
the sisters have been at odds on how the money should be controlled.</LD>
<LD>   In January, the library foundation filed lawsuits in Florida and
California in an attempt to gain control of the $20 million.</LD>
<TE>   Any court decisions on the Florida suit would be binding only if
Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower participate in the
lawsuit, Probate Judge Maria Korvick said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Korvick suggested that she could let a California judge decide how
the bequest should be spent.</TE>

<HD>14-Year-Old Girl Charged With Robbing Two Banks</HD>
<DH>Crime: Authorities in San Bernardino County say the suspect
is a crack addict. A man was arrested as alleged accomplice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 14-year-old girl allegedly addicted to crack cocaine has been
charged with robbing two banks, and may be the youngest person
accused of bank robbery in San Bernardino County, authorities said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "Nobody knows of anyone younger in their years of enforcing the
law," said Sheriff's Department spokesman Chip Patterson. "This is
unusual."</LD>
<LD>   The teenager, not identified because of her age, is accused of
holding up a Bank of America branch in a Chino Hills supermarket in
November and robbing a bank in Redlands later that day. She pretended
to have a handgun under her sweater, Patterson said.</LD>
<TE>   The girl was arrested and placed in San Bernardino County Juvenile
Hall on Dec. 8 for allegedly assaulting her mother in Ontario. She
faces two counts of armed robbery.</TE>
<TE>   A 32-year-old man who may have encouraged her to commit the heists
also was arrested. Both suspects are heavy drug users who were
homeless for some periods, authorities said. The pair are not
related. His identity was not released.</TE>
<TE>   During the Chino Hills robbery Nov. 29, the man waited in a
getaway car, Patterson said. As they drove away, a dye pack "exploded
and ruined the money," he added. "They tossed it out the window and
we recovered it."</TE>
<TE>   That night, the pair allegedly robbed the Redlands bank. In that
case, both robbers entered the bank and pretended to have guns. They
escaped with an undisclosed amount, Patterson said.</TE>
<TE>   The man, who was arrested about two months ago, is a suspect in
six bank robberies in and around San Bernardino County. He also could
face charges of unlawful sex with a minor, Patterson said.</TE>
<TE>   On April 9, authorities discovered that fingerprints taken when
the girl was booked for the assault matched prints taken from a
threatening note passed to a bank teller in Chino Hills, Patterson
said.</TE>
<TE>   A teller eventually identified her from a series of lineups.</TE>
<TE>   "If it hadn't been for that one contact with [the] Ontario [Police
Department], who knows what would have happened," Patterson said.</TE>

<DH>Crime: Jury listens to confession of Ramiro Salgado,
accused in the slaying of a Ventura teenager. Defense says police
manipulated him.</DH>

<LD>A Ventura jury on Thursday heard a 22-year-old man admit in a taped
interview with detectives that he took part in the fatal beating of
Ventura Theatre stagehand William Zara.</LD>
<LD>   In a recording made just before his arrest two years ago, Ramiro
Salgado nervously confessed to being among the 10 or so assailants
who stabbed Zara, beat him, bludgeoned him with a shovel and slammed
him with a baseball bat on the night of Sept. 25, 1999, in Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   The assailants mistakenly thought Zara, 18, had complained to
police about a loud party they were having. Charged with taking part
in a gang-related murder, Salgado faces the possibility of life in
prison.</LD>
<TE>   Four others--Benny Lopez, Terry Paul Schell, Frank Olvera and
Rosana Olvera--have been convicted in the attack and are serving life
terms.</TE>
<TE>   Salgado said he kicked Zara in the back twice as he was kneeling
on the ground and trying to shield his face from the angry crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "I stomped him," he told Ventura police detectives Dennis
Fitzgerald and Pat Stevens. "I'll take the blame for that."</TE>
<TE>   Salgado's attorney contends that the detectives tricked his
client, manipulating him into confessing acts he did not commit.
Questioning Stevens in court Thursday, Richard Loftus suggested that
the investigators lied to Salgado when they told him that other
suspects had implicated him.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens denied being deceptive.</TE>
<TE>   In the two-hour interview at Ventura's police headquarters,
Salgado initially denied any involvement in the attack. But as the
detectives questioned him, he admitted he might have boasted to
others about things he hadn't done. Finally, he said he had kicked
Zara.</TE>
<TE>   However, Salgado emphatically denied stabbing the youth, despite
the officers' claims that witnesses heard him bragging about it.</TE>
<TE>   "If I said that, it was a lie," Salgado told the detectives. "I
wouldn't stick him. I wouldn't kill nobody--that's not my style."</TE>
<TE>   A minute later, Salgado shifted again, volunteering to confess to
a stabbing he said he didn't commit rather than point police to the
person who did it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll take the blame for it," he said. "I won't rat on nobody."</TE>
<TE>   The former fast-food worker was sweating heavily during the taping
and said he had been using heroin for about six months. He asked the
officers whether he would be given medication in jail to ease his
withdrawal symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   As they slipped handcuffs on him, Salgado said he felt betrayed.</TE>
<TE>   We're just doing our jobs, Stevens told him, saying they were
under orders from their boss.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just worker bees here," said the 27-year police veteran.
"I'm a peon. I wear a suit, but I'm still a peon."</TE>
<TE>   Salgado's trial is expected to last two weeks.</TE>

<HD>Student May Have Lived 2 Days After Attack</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Medical expert testifies shooting wound in woman's
abdomen was not instantly fatal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Slain Moorpark College student Megan Barroso could have survived for
up to two days after being shot in the abdomen with an AK-47 assault
rifle last summer, an expert pathologist testified Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Based on an autopsy report and his work with war wounds in
Vietnam, Dr. Richard Mason suggested that Barroso may not have died
instantly because the bullet that hit her missed her spine and vital
organs.</LD>
<LD>   "Somebody could survive a gut wound for hours to days," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The pathologist took the stand late Thursday during a preliminary
hearing in Ventura County Superior Court for murder suspect Vincent
Sanchez, 31, who is accused of gunning down Barroso, 20, during a
kidnap and rape attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Mason is one of three experts expected to testify during the
hearing about how long Barroso could have lived after being shot--a
central and much-disputed issue in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Barroso's bullet-riddled car was found abandoned under a freeway
overpass in the early morning hours of July 5 with the engine
running. Her remains were recovered a month later in a canyon near
Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   A green jacket belonging to the Moorpark woman was seized from
Sanchez's Simi Valley residence, and authorities later matched a
piece of an AK-47 assault rifle found near her disabled car to a
weapon also confiscated from the defendant's home.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors theorize that Sanchez pulled Barroso from the car and
sexually assaulted her before she died. But defense attorneys contend
that Barroso died almost immediately after being shot, and therefore
could not have been raped.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is key because Sanchez faces two special-circumstance
allegations that he killed Barroso during a kidnap and rape attempt.
Those allegations make Sanchez eligible for the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez has pleaded guilty to raping seven other women, but he has
pleaded not guilty to the murder charge and related allegations.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Lela Henke-Dobroth attempted
to show through Mason's testimony that there was a large window of
time in which the defendant could have sexually assaulted a wounded
Barroso.</TE>
<TE>   Mason, a medical examiner in Northern California for the last 30
years, testified that the bullet was slowed considerably when it tore
through the driver's side door and hit Barroso's left side.</TE>
<TE>   Although the body was badly decomposed, autopsy results show the
bullet missed Barroso's spine, and most likely missed her aorta and
kidneys, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mason said Barroso could have lived for as little as 15 minutes or
as long as two days. A defense expert is expected to testify next
week that the bullet wound likely caused instant death.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the degree of decomposition, all the experts agree that
there is no way to determine whether Barroso was sexually assaulted
before she died.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Deputy Public Defender Neil Quinn began his
cross-examination late Thursday, challenging Mason's conclusions, and
is expected to continue questioning the pathologist this morning.</TE>

<HD>Germ Source Elusive at Closed Huntington Beach Shoreline</HD>
<DH>Health: Restroom sewer pipes are tested as possible
culprits in a mystery that has parallels to a two-month shutdown in
summer 1999.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investigators seeking the cause of bacteria spikes that closed nearly
half a mile of Huntington State Beach's shoreline ruled out a public
restroom Thursday. It was one of three beach bathrooms suspected of
leaking human waste into the surf.</LD>
<LD>   "All those [sewer] lines check out" at the one restroom, said Don
Ito, Orange County's state parks superintendent. He expects word soon
after tests on the two other restrooms.</LD>
<LD>   Inexplicably high bacteria counts in the water in recent weeks
prompted the Orange County Health Care Agency to indefinitely close
2,000 feet of shoreline around Magnolia Street on Tuesday. Warning
tape and signs are still up, though bacteria levels have declined. If
levels remain low, access to the surf could be allowed starting next
week, said Monica Mazur, the agency's spokeswoman.</LD>
<TE>   The shutdown is the first time health officials have closed the
beach without knowing of a specific sewage spill since the closure
during summer 1999, when miles of Huntington Beach shoreline were
off-limits for two months. The cause has not been discovered.</TE>
<TE>   At that time also, officials first zeroed in on beach restrooms.
Though a few leaks were found, they ultimately were ruled out as the
cause.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, however, engineers investigating high bacteria counts at
Bolsa Chica State Beach found 40 small cracks and separations in the
sewer lines that proved the source of the problem, leading to a
$700,000 upgrade, Ito said.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, workers testing for leaks plugged pipes at a restroom
southeast of Magnolia Street, filled them with water and watched to
see if the water seeped out, Ito said. He awaits results on the two
other possible sources being tested Thursday and today: sewer pipes
at lifeguard headquarters and a public restroom northwest of the
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Mazur said, "It's so difficult with these things, with everything
being underground.... This could be totally wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Officials suspected the bathrooms once they compared bacteria
spikes with use of the restroom and showers at lifeguard
headquarters. However, Ito noted that during a two-week lifeguard
training course in early March, bacteria levels continued to rise and
drop. The heavy use of the headquarters during that time would be
expected to keep the levels high, if it were the source of
contamination. And Mazur noted that some of the bacteria spikes
correlated with very low tides, which will occur again April 21.</TE>

<LD>A gunman who allegedly broke into a dental laboratory early Thursday
in an attempt to steal money and gold fillings was shot and killed
with his own weapon during a scuffle with an employee who was working
late.</LD>
<LD>   Hector Garcia Laureles, 41, of Anaheim was pronounced dead from a
bullet wound to the head shortly after the break-in at Analia's
Dental Lab on Ball Road in an unincorporated area within Anaheim,
according to Orange County sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino.</LD>
<LD>   The identity of the worker, possibly the owner of the lab, who
struggled with Garcia Laureles was not released. The worker was shot
in the leg during the confrontation and was being treated at a
hospital.</LD>
<TE>   Garcia Laureles, who has a long criminal record of drug and
robbery charges, entered the lab through an open door shortly before
1 a.m., demanding money and dental gold, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia Laureles pulled out a .38-caliber pistol and shot the
worker in the leg, then fired two more shots that missed, Amormino
said. During the struggle, a female worker called 911, screaming
about the gunman.</TE>
<TE>   The gun went off a fourth time as the two wrestled. "They were
fighting for control of the weapon and the weapon went off," Amormino
said.</TE>

<LD>Responding to parent complaints, the Conejo Valley Unified School
District is cutting down on homework.</LD>
<LD>   The school board tentatively approved a new policy this week in
response to parent complaints that students were getting too many
assignments every night and had little time for sports, church or
family. The board will vote for final approval May 14.</LD>
<LD>   The new policy sets time limits for homework: students in
kindergarten through second grade, up to 20 minutes; third through
fifth grades, 30 to 50 minutes; middle school students, 60 to 90
minutes; and high school students, 90 to 120 minutes.</LD>

team napped. "But they're handling it so well."</LD>
<LD>   The two-day competition began with written essay, literature and
art tests in the morning, followed by speeches and interviews in the
afternoon. Despite some minor glitches, Jones said that team members
felt good about their performances.</LD>
<TE>   "The kids felt like they rolled with everything really well," he
said. "They didn't let anything throw them."</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark is hoping to reclaim the national title won by the school

<HD>Powell Arrives in Israel Facing Major Hurdles</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Secretary of State's strategy calls for putting any truce
on a parallel track with political talks. The goal is to bring Arab
nations into the peace process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell arrived in Jerusalem late
Thursday to launch the critical phase of his long-shot Middle East peace
mission--and test a new strategy to try to overcome the dangerous
hostilities and deep rage between Israelis and Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   Powell, past master of military strategy and current maestro of U.S.
foreign policy, will need to tap both skills to pull off anything that
leads to either a lasting cease-fire or an agreement from Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon and Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat to face
each other across a negotiating table.</LD>
<LD>   But the landscape Powell wakes up to today is forbidding: On Thursday,
Israeli authorities carried out targeted raids and reported two thwarted
plots by suspected suicide bombers, and Palestinians counted their dead
in the 2-week-old Israeli offensive in the West Bank. Sharon pledged that
he wouldn't retreat until the last Palestinian extremist had surrendered.</LD>
<TE>   Even U.S. officials acknowledge that the deck is stacked against
Powell. "Getting those two back into a real peace process makes getting
Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait look comparatively straightforward," said a
Bush administration official, referring to the 1991 Persian Gulf War,
when Powell served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</TE>
<TE>   Powell's new strategy calls for a new timetable that eliminates what
is known as sequence--a cease-fire followed by political talks--thus
addressing the demands of all parties to the conflict at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   The central problem is that the Israeli government doesn't want to
talk peace until suicide bombings cease and the security situation is
stabilized. And the Palestinian Authority has been unwilling to rein in
the violence without guarantees of a political process that will lead to
an independent state in a reasonable time frame.</TE>
<TE>   The most important shift in U.S. tactics over the past week, Arab
leaders say, is Washington's recognition that it must accelerate the
political process and not leave it until the end, as Israel has
stipulated. Arab leaders, whose role is critical in the effort to
convince Arafat to cooperate, are backing the Palestinian demand.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not going to lift a finger to pressure Arafat until we are
convinced there is a political process on the way--a mechanism that
translates the principle of a two-state solution into action," said an
Arab foreign minister who talked to Powell this week. "And we're not
talking 30 years away--or even two years away. We have to go all the way,
and soon."</TE>
<TE>   After talks Thursday evening between Powell and King Abdullah II in
Amman, Jordan's capital, Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher said the Arab
world now expects Powell to put forward a plan for the political end
game. It should include a road map with "milestones" that cover "all
parameters of a solution--so that we truly present a credible alternative
to the violence that is going on today," he said at a news conference
with Powell.</TE>
<TE>   The new U.S. approach to the Mideast crisis includes a tough-love
stance with Israel, its closest ally in the volatile region, that
involves both carrots and sticks. Days after President Bush demanded that
Israel withdraw "without delay," White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said
Thursday that Bush considers Sharon "a man of peace."</TE>
<TE>   The withdrawal is "perhaps not as fast as some might like," Powell
acknowledged. The president wants to see more progress, he added, noting
that the withdrawal schedule will be part of a "very long conversation"
when he meets Sharon this morning.</TE>
<TE>   But Powell, who talked to Sharon by telephone Thursday, also issued a
blunt warning about the dangers of Israeli intransigence.</TE>
<TE>   "However effective Israeli defense forces will be right now in routing
out terrorism . . . there may still be people who are willing to resort
to violence and terror, people who are willing to use suicide bombs and
other kinds of bombs," Powell said at a news conference in Madrid, where
he met with Russian officials earlier Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "After those incursions, the violence and that anger and frustration
will still be there unless we find a negotiating process that both sides
have confidence in, a negotiating process that will lead to what the
Palestinian people want," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell also intends to play tough with Arafat when they meet Saturday
at the Palestinian leader's besieged headquarters in the West Bank city
of Ramallah, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Over the past four days, the administration has backed away from the
idea of cultivating contacts with possible alternative Palestinian
leaders. Saudi, Moroccan, Egyptian, Jordanian and other Arab officials
have convinced Powell that no other Palestinian can either claim
legitimate leadership or rein in the violence.</TE>
<TE>   But Powell does plan to make clear that the United States will do
nothing to accelerate the process of a Palestinian state or support the
reconstruction of heavily damaged Palestinian areas and institutions
unless Arafat moves--decisively and quickly--to do all he can to end the
wave of suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   Although Powell has received wide backing for the broad outlines of
his strategy on the road leading to Jerusalem, both sides are expected to
play hardball with him.</TE>
<TE>   The standoff boils down to a chicken-and-egg conundrum of what happens
first--or who takes the first step. Trust is almost nonexistent, U.S.
officials acknowledge.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the former general's charisma, global stature and clout as the
world's most powerful diplomat, a State Department official lamented
Thursday, "Even Mother Teresa would have a problem dealing with these
guys," referring to the stubborn septuagenarian Israeli and Palestinian
leaders, whose battles are now personal as well as political.</TE>
<TE>   Powell admitted candidly before leaving Madrid earlier Thursday that
"everything happening now is an impediment to getting to the end point."</TE>
<TE>   But he also tried to be upbeat about the challenge. "I don't like
wallowing with pessimists," he said when asked if he is taking on a
"mission impossible" in trying to defuse the Mideast crisis. "I am proud
to be going. . . . My mission is still on. I'm not concerned about it."</TE>

<DH>S. America: President negotiates the terms of his resignation after
deadly street protests, army says.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela
</DL>
<LD>Venezuela's top generals declared themselves in rebellion against
President Hugo Chavez and tanks rolled through the streets of this
capital Thursday after a day of protests against the government that left
at least 10 people dead.</LD>
<LD>   Early today, Gen. Efrain Vasquez, head of the army, announced that
Chavez was negotiating the terms of his resignation with military
officials.</LD>
<LD>   Late Thursday, National Guard Gen. Alberto Camacho Kairuz said that
Chavez had "abandoned" his office and that the military was in control of
the country. But the head of Venezuela's National Assembly said Chavez
was still in power and was meeting with his ministers.</LD>
<TE>   Military leaders said they had asked Chavez to resign and call new
elections, and Globovision TV later reported that the president, who was
elected in 1998, had quit, but there was no immediate confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   The political upheaval came as more than 200,000 Venezuelans marched
here on the third day of a general strike against Chavez's government and
as about 40 military officers called for his resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez accused the media of fomenting the unrest and forced five
privately owned television stations off the air. Hours later, National
Guard troops rebelled against Chavez and surrounded the
government-operated station, forcing it off the air. A crowd of civilians
celebrated outside.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the country is under the control of the national armed
forces," Camacho said. "The government has abandoned its functions."</TE>
<TE>   Local media earlier reported that Chavez's family had been flown out
of the country, but those reports could not be confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   The dramatic developments followed hours of street battles and
bloodshed in central Caracas. Some witnesses said snipers positioned on
rooftops had fired on the anti-Chavez protesters.</TE>
<TE>   The demonstrations were set off by Chavez's decision earlier this year
to replace top executives at the government oil monopoly, Petroleos de
Venezuela. The appointments, seen by many here as politically motivated,
became a symbol of what many believe is Chavez's heavy-handed and
sometimes arbitrary rule.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of protesting employees brought most of Venezuela's oil
industry to a halt. They were joined this week by thousands more workers
when the nation's largest labor confederation called for a general
strike.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela is the third-largest supplier of oil to the United States.
Some analysts believe that a prolonged disruption of the supply would
cause prices in the U.S. to spike.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the general strike said earlier Wednesday that they would
continue protesting in the streets indefinitely, even if Chavez decreed a
state of emergency and deployed soldiers to quash the demonstrations.</TE>
<TE>   "We would rebel against any decision of that nature," said Carlos
Ortega, head of the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers, the country's
largest and most powerful labor union.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday afternoon, with tear gas wafting toward the presidential
palace, Chavez took to the airwaves to say he would not step down. In a
long and rambling address, he called those marching against him
subversives.</TE>
<TE>   The president, a maverick populist whose nationalist policies have
often run afoul of the United States, asked for his supporters to take to
the streets to confront the demonstrators. Thousands joined a pro-Chavez
rally near the presidential palace, and some fought with the anti-Chavez
marchers.</TE>
<TE>   But Chavez's fate seemed sealed after Vasquez, one of Chavez's key
supporters, broke with the president Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   "The military has been used for political purposes," the general said
in a radio address. "Tonight, we ask for the forgiveness of the
Venezuelan people. The armed forces are not for fighting the people."</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez ordered all troops to remain in their barracks, saying they
should not participate in any actions to quell the growing popular
protests.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a coup, it is not an act of insubordination," the general
said. "It is a position in solidarity with the people of Venezuela."</TE>
<TE>   Protesters advanced toward the Miraflores presidential palace and
threw rocks at National Guard troops sent to disperse them. In addition
to those killed, more than 80 people were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, more than 150 armed men, some in uniform and others dressed
as civilians, surrounded the offices of CMT television. Other stations
evacuated their facilities, fearing attacks by Chavez supporters, known
here as "Bolivarian circles."</TE>
<TE>   The violence and the decision to censor the media appeared to have
quickly eroded Chavez's remaining support in the military.</TE>
<TE>   "From this moment, this government should end," Camacho, surrounded by
30 fellow officers, told a news conference at National Guard
headquarters. He said he was resigning as vice minister for security.</TE>
<TE>   Camacho called for the formation of a provisional government junta and
appealed for support from other branches of the armed forces and the
Roman Catholic Church.</TE>
<TE>   He and other National Guard officers blamed Chavez and his government
for Thursday's killings, most of which occurred when unidentified gunmen
opened fire near the presidential palace.</TE>
<TE>   "They were massacred from the rooftops," Camacho said.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate recorded statement, another group of at least 10
officers from different branches of the armed forces also called for
Chavez and his government to step down.</TE>
<TE>   "We, generals and admirals of the army, navy, air force and National
Guard . . . we have decided to address the Venezuelan people to reject
the current government, the authority of Hugo Chavez Frias and the
military high command," an unidentified officer said.</TE>
<TE>   With Chavez's whereabouts unclear late Thursday, air force Col. Marcos
Salas said that forces opposed to the president were in control of key
air bases and airports around the capital, aiming to prevent Chavez's
flight from the country.</TE>
<TE>   But Salas said he was "taking precautions" because some units remained
loyal to the president.</TE>
<TE>   William Lara, president of the National Assembly, and retired Gen.
Guaicaipuro Lameda said Chavez was at the presidential palace with
loyalist troops.</TE>

<HD>Pressure Is on Cardinal to Resign</HD>
<DH>Crisis: Boston's Law faces mounting calls, even from loyalists, to
quit over the priest pedophile scandal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>With outrage mounting among his followers, Boston's Cardinal
Bernard Law came under increasing pressure to resign Thursday over
disclosures that he had protected pedophile priests at the expense of his
parishioners.</LD>
<LD>   Around the country and the world, e-mails were flying among church
officials about the future of America's highest-ranking prelate. Boston's
two daily newspapers have called on Law to step down. The city's
boisterous talk radio was buzzing with little beyond demands for the
cardinal to quit. Two candidates for governor of Massachusetts--a
Catholic and a Jew--have added their voices to the chorus.</LD>
<LD>   But as Law has dug in his heels--remaining entrenched Thursday in his
mansion here--even his closest advisors, the titans of Boston's
close-knit business community, began falling away.</LD>
<TE>   "It's time," said former Lt. Gov. Thomas P. O'Neill III, a business
consultant and the grandson of the late speaker of the House. "The
healing has got to begin. His staying in place puts all that off."</TE>
<TE>   Law's reluctance to become the first U.S. cardinal to
resign--worldwide, only a handful of cardinals has stepped down in recent
memory--comes at a time when the church is under fire for failing to act
as scores of pedophile priests apparently operated freely for decades. In
Boston, Law now is widely viewed as a shepherd who did not protect his
flock.</TE>
<TE>   The sexual abuse scandal exploded in January, when the Boston Globe
obtained documents proving that the Boston archdiocese knew for years
that Father John Geoghan was molesting children. (He is now in prison.)
Soon parishes worldwide were reeling amid reports of abuses long covered
up that had come into the open.</TE>
<TE>   The coup de grace for the Boston archdiocese and its besieged cardinal
came Monday, when evidence surfaced that Law had approved the transfer of
a pedophile priest, Father Paul Shanley, from Boston to California.</TE>
<TE>   The Shanley documents prompted state Atty. Gen. Tom Reilly to announce
this week that he may bring criminal charges against church
supervisors--possibly including Law--who oversaw priests who molested
minors. Reilly also said he is looking into filing civil rights suits
against church leaders.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the Geoghan case, the Boston archdiocese already has
turned over the names of more than 80 priests suspected of abusing
children over four decades. Late last month, the archdiocese reached a
settlement of close to $30 million with 84 Geoghan victims. To pay off
the burgeoning sexual abuse claims, Law has sold diocesan assets,
including treasury stocks, bonds and real estate.</TE>
<TE>   Charitable giving is down, and some wealthy Catholics have said they
will not donate another dime if the money goes to sexual abuse
settlements.</TE>
<TE>   But the sordid details of the Shanley case have done the most to make
Law loyalists recoil. More than 800 pages of previously secret church
documents revealed that Shanley's superiors knew he advocated "man-boy"
relationships, and argued that children themselves often instigated sex
with adults. Shanley was sent to San Bernardino in 1990 with assurances
from Law that he was "a priest in good standing" in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   One of his alleged victims, 55-year-old Arthur Austin, took aim at Law
for sheltering a predator without "a crumb of compassion" for those who
were injured. "You are a liar," Austin said. "Your own documents condemn
you."</TE>
<TE>   At the archdiocese here, spokeswoman Donna M. Morrissey did not
respond to a request for an interview with Law.</TE>
<TE>Law Said to Have Lost His Moral Authority</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal, said Eugene Kennedy--a former priest and professor
emeritus at Chicago's Loyola University who has studied pedophilia in the
priesthood--once was "the most influential person in the American
Catholic Church." But now, Kennedy said, "he has lost his moral
authority."</TE>
<TE>   The 70-year-old Law was born in Torreon, Mexico, the child of a U.S.
Army colonel. Ordained in 1961, he plunged into civil rights work in
Mississippi so wholeheartedly that his name showed up on a hit list
issued by local segregationists.</TE>
<TE>   His social progressivism continued as he took over in 1973 as bishop
in the diocese of Springfield-Cape Girardeau, Mo. He opened soup
kitchens, welcomed refugee priests from Vietnam, reached out to other
denominations--and began a methodical ascent in Roman Catholic hierarchy.</TE>
<TE>   "I have known him for years," Kennedy said. "He was always highly
regarded. But everyone knew he was ambitious. He made no secrets in
pursuing his goals. He became powerful because he understood that in
order to do so, he had to accede to the pope in every way."</TE>
<TE>   In Catholic circles, said Tom Roberts, editor of the National Catholic
Reporter--an independent news weekly in Kansas City, Mo.--"Law is what
would be considered a kingmaker. . . . He really has carried an enormous
amount of water for Rome."</TE>
<TE>   Law took over in Boston in 1984 with a mandate to enforce a tough,
conservative Vatican party line. He was elevated to cardinal in 1985, and
established himself as a major force in a city where Catholics dominate
the top ranks of business and politics.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers, financiers and tycoons from real estate and construction
frequented Law's mansion near Boston College for private dinners, where
such social issues as affordable housing or community policing often were
topics of the hour. Many of those who came to form Law's inner circle
were drawn by the cardinal's forceful opposition to abortion and birth
control and by his crackdown on "cafeteria Catholics"--those who shop
around for morsels of doctrine they find acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   Savvy, mediagenic and progressive in his support of the region's black
and Latino communities, Law became a powerful player in Boston--a
convener, catalyst and moral leader.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent weeks, support from Law's inner circle began to falter.
Last month, advertising czar Jack Connors informed the cardinal via a
quote in the Globe that he would no longer offer his advice. The cardinal
called Connors into his office at the chancery to rebuke him.</TE>
<TE>   On March 13, the Boston Herald called for Law's resignation in an
editorial. The Globe followed suit on Tuesday--the day after the Shanley
revelations. Over the last three months, the Globe wrote, "the community
had hoped that Law could lead the church through this crisis. But now he
is trapped." The editorial concluded: "Cardinal Law should resign."</TE>
<TE>   Day by day, more of Law's backers have defected. Democratic state Sen.
Warren Tolman, a candidate for governor, on Tuesday declared: "As a
churchgoing Catholic and father of three, I reluctantly conclude that
Cardinal Law should not continue to lead the archdiocese of Boston."</TE>
<TE>   Former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, another Democratic
gubernatorial aspirant, also pressed for Law's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   "As the father of two sons, who wants nothing more in the world than
to protect them from harm, I've come to the conclusion that this scandal
goes beyond church matters," said Reich, who is Jewish. "If the abuse
occurred at a day-care center, or an elementary school . . . the person
in charge who covered it up would have been fired and punished. This
isn't about religion--it's about a leader and an administrator who
fundamentally failed in his duties."</TE>
<TE>Yearly Spring Garden Party Is Canceled</TE>
<TE>   In a poll released Thursday by Quinnipiac University, 60% of
Massachusetts' Catholics surveyed said Law should resign.</TE>
<TE>   Under Law's watch, the archdiocese's coffers ballooned. In December,
he set a goal of $300 million for the 2002 cardinal's fund drive.</TE>
<TE>   But this week, wealthy Catholics here realized the extent of Law's
problems when the archdiocese abruptly canceled the cardinal's annual
spring garden party. The event was an institution, last year raising $1.4
million for local charities.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese on Thursday also informed members of a committee on
child protection that Law had appointed in the wake of the Geoghan case
that its first scheduled meeting on Saturday would not be held, as
planned, at the cardinal's residence.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Law made a point of apologizing for the abuses committed
by Geoghan. But in recent weeks, he has portrayed himself as something of
a victim.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally have these past weeks experienced closeness to Jesus on
the cross that I never have before in my life," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The test of faith in Boston by no means has been limited to the
cardinal.</TE>
<TE>   "Ordinary Catholics in Boston know that there is a terrible crisis,"
Kennedy said. "But they know that this is not a crisis in the church they
believe in. They retain their faith in that. . . . This is a crisis in
the organizational church, and they have lost their belief in that. They
have kept their faith, but lost their confidence."</TE>

<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A nearly unanimous Senate approved a landmark $3.5-billion bill
Thursday that would require states to upgrade flawed and often-antiquated
voting systems in response to the 2000 election debacle.</LD>
<LD>   The 99 to 1 vote, providing a bipartisan coda to the bitter partisan
conflict, appeared to ensure that some form of the legislation would
become law before the next presidential election.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate bill would authorize the $3.5 billion over five years to
help state and local agencies meet new standards for voting systems,
replace outdated ballot-counting machinery, improve access to polling
places for the disabled and take other steps to bolster voter
participation and prevent fraud.</LD>
<TE>   The House passed its own voting reform bill in December, authorizing
$2.65 billion in federal aid over three years. Sponsors from both parties
are optimistic the two versions can be quickly reconciled.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, who emerged victorious from the 2000 Florida recount
that spotlighted many of the problems the legislation aims to fix, is
encouraging lawmakers to reach agreement. His budget recommends $1.2
billion for voting reform over the next three years.</TE>
<TE>   "I commend the Senate for passing an election reform bill and bringing
us a step closer to enacting legislation this year," Bush said in a
statement. He also urged lawmakers to "respect the primacy of state and
local governments" as they craft a compromise.</TE>
<TE>   A key difference between the two chambers is that the House bill gives
states leeway to craft their own improvements in the election process,
while the Senate version requires certain changes.</TE>
<TE>   But the margin of passage in the Senate and the positive reactions of
several House members to the action made clear that consensus on election
reform is rapidly developing.</TE>
<TE>   Describing the legislation's magnitude, some senators compared it to a
1993 law that sought to expand voter participation by allowing
registration at state motor vehicle offices and to a 1965 law protecting
the voting rights of minorities.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the bill would make "our election
systems more accurate, more accessible and more honest."</TE>
<TE>   Others said the bill's proposed federal funding was unprecedented.
"This is the first time that I know of that we've actually stepped up and
written a check" to help states fix voting problems, said Sen.
Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.).</TE>
<TE>   Still, the measure would not necessarily repair every flaw, real or
perceived, in an election system largely under control of a patchwork of
50 state and thousands of local agencies. Some experts say that even if
the larger Senate funding figure becomes law, more money will be needed
to replace poorly functioning machines. Others warn it is impossible to
correct every weakness in a system that depends on voters following
instructions.</TE>
<TE>   Also, many of the bill's proposed requirements are already the norm in
various states.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, California is among roughly 20 states that allow
would-be voters to cast a "provisional" ballot, subject to later
verification, even if their names are not listed at a polling station.
The bill would require all states to offer such protections by the 2004
elections.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Conrad R. Burns (R-Mont.) cast the sole vote against the bill,
objecting to what he termed its "one-size-fits-all" approach. Rural
states such as his own--where many still vote the old-fashioned way, with
pen and paper--won't necessarily benefit from the bill, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The American Civil Liberties Union criticized provisions it said would
undermine voting rights, especially an anti-fraud provision to require
many voters to prove their identity before they cast a ballot for the
first time.</TE>
<TE>   Reps. Carrie P. Meek (D-Fla.) and Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas),
members of the Congressional Black Caucus, stood behind senators Thursday
to praise their bill. Johnson, who heads the caucus, said she did not
believe the identification requirements in the Senate bill would block
participation by black or Latino voters. Instead, she praised the bill as
a step forward for minimum standards for voting systems.</TE>
<TE>   Had its provisions been in effect before the 2000 election, Johnson
asserted tersely, "the voters would have gotten the president they
elected."</TE>
<TE>   But while some Democrats remain resentful about the controversial
outcome of the contest between Bush and former Vice President Al Gore,
most lawmakers said they hoped enactment of a new law would assuage some
of the bitterness.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, bipartisan calls for change emerged even during the 36-day
recount that made "hanging chads" and "butterfly ballots" famous.
Afterward, former Presidents Ford and Carter headed a commission that
recommended reforms embraced by Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Senate bill, states would have to meet several minimum
standards. Among them:</TE>
<TE>   * Voting systems, such as the heavily criticized punch-card ballot
machines, would be required to meet a minimal rate of acceptable error.
(California is already replacing punch cards.)</TE>
<TE>   * All voters would be able to verify their votes before casting a
ballot and make changes or obtain a replacement ballot to fix any errors.</TE>
<TE>   * Voters, with some exceptions, would be required to be notified if
they chose more than one candidate for an office.</TE>
<TE>   To combat fraud, states also would be required to develop a
computerized statewide registration list.</TE>
<TE>   Election officials would be required to check the identity of
first-time voters who register by mail. Acceptable identification would
include a driver's license, utility bill, bank statement or government
document.</TE>
<TE>   In a concession to states such as Washington, Oregon and California,
which rely heavily on vote-by-mail programs, the bill would also allow
state officials to verify identity by checking a voter's Social Security
number.</TE>
<TE>   The provisions of the bill would take effect in phases over the next
several years. Some steps would be required before the 2004 elections;
others would go into motion starting in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate estimate of how much money California could
receive under the Senate bill. House sponsors have said the state could
receive about $345 million under their bill.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the House bill, the Senate version provides no specific funding
to replace the punch-card machines that gained notoriety in Florida.
States would, however, be able to use grant money under the Senate bill
to replace or improve voting machinery.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill also provides states with more general guidelines to
combat fraud. For instance, it would simply require states to devise a
system to maintain accurate voter registration lists, rather then develop
a computerized system.</TE>
<TE>   The scope of the problems plaguing the nation's election system was
detailed in a recent study by Caltech and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. The study estimated that 6 million votes nationwide are lost
each presidential election to machines that don't properly record voter
markings, systems that mistakenly omit registered voters from rolls and
ballots so confusing that voters accidentally support the wrong
candidate.</TE>

<HD>Pressure Is on Cardinal to Resign</HD>
<DH>Crisis: Boston's Law faces mounting calls, even from close allies,
to quit over the priest pedophile scandal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>With outrage mounting among his followers, Boston's Cardinal
Bernard Law came under increasing pressure to resign Thursday over
disclosures that he had protected pedophile priests at the expense of his
parishioners.</LD>
<LD>   Around the country and the world, e-mails were flying among church
officials about the future of America's highest-ranking prelate. Boston's
two daily newspapers have called on Law to step down. The city's
boisterous talk radio was buzzing with little beyond demands for the
cardinal to quit. Two candidates for governor of Massachusetts--a
Catholic and a Jew--have added their voices to the chorus.</LD>
<LD>   But as Law has dug his heels in--remaining entrenched Thursday in his
mansion here--even his closest advisors, the titans of Boston's
close-knit business community, began falling away.</LD>
<TE>   "It's time," said former Lt. Gov. Thomas P. O'Neill III, a business
consultant and the grandson of the late speaker of the House. "The
healing has got to begin. His staying in place puts all that off."</TE>
<TE>   Law's reluctance to become the first U.S. cardinal ever to
resign--worldwide, only a handful of cardinals has stepped down in recent
memory--comes at a time when the church is under fire for failing to act
as scores of pedophile priests apparently operated freely for decades. In
Boston, Law now is widely viewed as a shepherd who did not protect his
flock.</TE>
<TE>   The sexual abuse scandal exploded in January, when the Boston Globe
obtained documents proving that the Boston archdiocese knew for years
that Father John Geoghan was molesting children. (He is now in prison.)
Soon parishes worldwide were reeling amid reports of abuses long covered
up that had come into the open.</TE>
<TE>   The coup de grace for the Boston archdiocese and its besieged cardinal
came Monday, when evidence surfaced that Law had approved the transfer of
a pedophile priest, Father Paul Shanley, from Boston to California.</TE>
<TE>   One of his alleged victims, 55-year-old Arthur Austin, took aim at Law
for sheltering a predator without "a crumb of compassion" for those who
were injured. "You are a liar," Austin said. "Your own documents condemn
you."</TE>
<TE>   At the archdiocese here, spokeswoman Donna M. Morrissey did not
respond to a request for an interview with Law.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal, said Eugene Kennedy--a former priest and professor
emeritus at Chicago's Loyola University who has studied pedophilia in the
priesthood--once was "the most influential person in the American
Catholic Church." But now, Kennedy said, "he has lost his moral
authority."</TE>
<TE>   The 70-year-old Law was born in Torreon, Mexico, the child of a U.S.
Army colonel. Ordained in 1961, he plunged into civil rights work in
Mississippi so wholeheartedly that his name showed up on a hit list
issued by local segregationists.</TE>
<TE>   His social progressivism continued as he took over in 1973 as bishop
in the diocese of Springfield-Cape Girardeau, Mo. He opened soup
kitchens, welcomed refugee priests from Vietnam, reached out to other
denominations--and began a methodical ascent in Catholic hierarchy.</TE>
<TE>   "I have known him for years," Kennedy said. "He was always highly
regarded. But everyone knew he was ambitious. He made no secrets in
pursuing his goals. He became powerful because he understood that in
order to do so, he had to accede to the pope in every way."</TE>
<TE>   In Catholic circles, said Tom Roberts, editor of the National Catholic
Reporter--an independent news weekly in Kansas City, Mo.--"Law is what
would be considered a kingmaker. . . . He really has carried an enormous
amount of water for Rome."</TE>
<TE>   Law took over in Boston in 1984 with a mandate to enforce a tough,
conservative Vatican party line. He was elevated to cardinal in 1985, and
established himself as a major force in a city where Catholics dominate
the top ranks of business and politics.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers, financiers and tycoons from real estate and construction
frequented Law's mansion near Boston College for private dinners, where
such social issues as affordable housing or community policing often were
topics of the hour. Many of those who came to form Law's inner circle
were drawn by the cardinal's forceful opposition to abortion and birth
control and by his crackdown on "cafeteria Catholics"--those who shop
around for morsels of doctrine they find acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   Savvy, mediagenic and progressive in his support of the region's black
and Latino communities, Law became a powerful player in Boston--a
convener, catalyst and moral leader.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent weeks, support from Law's inner circle began to falter.
Last month, advertising czar Jack Connors informed the cardinal via a
quote in the Globe that he would no longer offer his advice. The cardinal
called Connors into his office at the chancery to rebuke him.</TE>
<TE>   On March 13, the Boston Herald called for Law's resignation in an
editorial. The Globe followed suit on Tuesday--the day after the Shanley
revelations. Over the last three months, the Globe wrote, "the community
had hoped that Law could lead the church through this crisis. But now he
is trapped." The editorial concluded: "Cardinal Law should resign."</TE>
<TE>   Day by day, more of Law's backers have defected. Democratic state Sen.
Warren Tolman, a candidate for governor, on Tuesday declared: "As a
churchgoing Catholic and father of three, I reluctantly conclude that
Cardinal Law should not continue to lead the archdiocese of Boston."</TE>
<TE>   Former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, another Democratic
gubernatorial aspirant, also pressed for Law's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   "As the father of two sons, who wants nothing more in the world than
to protect them from harm, I've come to the conclusion that this scandal
goes beyond church matters," said Reich, who is Jewish. "If the abuse
occurred at a day-care center, or an elementary school . . . the person
in charge who covered it up would have been fired and punished. This
isn't about religion--it's about a leader and an administrator who
fundamentally failed in his duties."</TE>
<TE>   In a poll released Thursday by Quinnipiac University, 60% of
Massachusetts' Catholics surveyed said Law should resign.</TE>
<TE>   Under Law's watch, the archdiocese's coffers ballooned. In December,
he set a goal of $300 million for the 2002 cardinal's fund drive.</TE>
<TE>   But this week, wealthy Catholics here realized the extent of Law's
problems when the archdiocese abruptly canceled the cardinal's annual
spring garden party. The event was an institution, last year raising $1.4
million for local charities.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese on Thursday also informed members of a committee on
child protection that Law had appointed in the wake of the Geoghan case
that its first scheduled meeting on Saturday would not be held, as
planned, at the cardinal's residence.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Law made a point of apologizing for the abuses committed
by Geoghan. But in recent weeks, he has portrayed himself as something of
a victim.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally have these past weeks experienced closeness to Jesus on
the cross that I never have before in my life," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The test of faith in Boston by no means has been limited to the
cardinal.</TE>
<TE>   "Ordinary Catholics in Boston know that there is a terrible crisis,"
Kennedy said. "But they know that this is not a crisis in the church they
believe in. They retain their faith in that. . . . This is a crisis in
the organizational church, and they have lost their belief in that. They
have kept their faith, but lost their confidence."</TE>

<HD>Police Clear Mahony of Alleged 1970 Molestation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK ARAX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FRESNO
</DL>
<LD>A Fresno police investigation has cleared Cardinal Roger M. Mahony
of allegations that he sexually abused a female student at a Catholic
high school 32 years ago, the department's chief of criminal
investigations said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Lt. Dwayne Johnson said the three-week investigation uncovered no
evidence of a crime and that no further action would be taken. He said
Mahony was interviewed in person about the alleged incident, which he
denied had taken place, and that he cooperated fully with detectives.</LD>
<LD>   The accuser, a 51-year-old Fresno woman, has a history of mental
illness.</LD>
<TE>   "We couldn't find a single thing to substantiate the allegations,"
Johnson said. "We even went back to students and staff at the high school
at the time and they couldn't remember any event like this occurring."</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal's office said in a statement that he "welcomes the
confirmation by the Fresno Police Department this afternoon of his
previous denial of this allegation." The statement also said Mahony was
grateful to the department "for conducting a professional and thorough
investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony's accuser said he had molested her on campus grounds during
school hours while she was a student at San Joaquin Memorial High School
in 1970. She said she was knocked out during a fight outside the band
room. She said that when she awoke, the bottom half of her clothes had
been removed and that she saw Mahony's face hovering over her. She said
she passed out again. (Although the woman said her name could be
published, The Times generally does not use the names of those who say
they have been sexually abused.)</TE>
<TE>   Even as the woman insisted that her account was true, she conceded to
reporters that it lacked details and sounded farfetched. She told The
Times last week that she was diagnosed with schizophrenia in the 1970s
and was still taking medication to ease the symptoms. She said she was
motivated to press forward with her allegations, in part, because the
state is cutting her disability payments and she needs a cash settlement
from the church.</TE>
<TE>   She also said that nearly everyone she has encountered in her
life--from her parents to her high school classmates to her former
co-workers--had either molested, abused or emotionally mistreated her.</TE>
<TE>Woman's Case Quickly Unraveled</TE>
<TE>   The allegations against Mahony, which surfaced last week, quickly made
headlines across the country in the midst of what has become a nationwide
child-abuse scandal in the Catholic Church.</TE>
<TE>   The Fresno woman said the climate of suspicion and heightened
awareness encouraged her to come forward last month and talk to a priest
at St John's Church. The priest took her claim to police.</TE>
<TE>   But almost as soon as the woman appeared in front of local TV cameras
last week, it was evident that the allegations were sketchy and that she
had trouble talking in a coherent manner. She said her mental problems,
despite taking the drug Risperdal for schizophrenia, had grown worse in
recent weeks as people have knocked on her apartment window and
threatened her.</TE>
<TE>Fresno Diocese Interviewed Woman</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Johnson said the woman's psychiatric history made the
investigation more complicated. Any impulse to dismiss her claims
outright because she suffers from schizophrenia, an illness characterized
by delusions, was outweighed by the fact that victims often suffer
emotionally and mentally from sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "These are always difficult investigations, and we never comment on
the mental state of the alleged victims. But we do look at their
credibility and the credibility of the accused," he said.</TE>
<TE>   E-mails from Mahony and his staff, which were obtained last week by
the media, indicated that the Fresno diocese had tape-recorded a two-hour
interview with the woman. The e-mails showed that Mahony and his staff
were confident that the accusations would not stand up under scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "Good work!" Mahony e-mailed his attorney and media relations director
March 28. "It will be key to get the [woman's] transcript in the hands of
both the Fresno PD and the LAPD. They should then interview her
themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Larry Stammer contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Chimps May Have Something to Tell Us</HD>
<DH>Human and the ape species' genomes are 99% identical. Pinpointing
the differences could shed light on AIDS, aging and other mysteries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Their brains are smaller, they can't talk, they are covered with
hair and they walk on their knuckles. They are also so very, very much
like us that even 300 years ago, the anatomist who first dissected a
chimpanzee concluded that they were neither monkey nor man, but something
in between.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the chimpanzee and human genomes are nearly 99% identical.
The chimp's lesser-known sister species, the bonobo, is similarly close
to us. Figuring out precisely which genes differ, and how, is a project
of enormous complexity--but one that eventually could provide clues
toward treating diseases ranging from AIDS to malaria and shed light on
the reasons we age.</LD>
<LD>   And it is the passion of a small but growing number of scientists.</LD>
<TE>   Today, some of them will report a major advance: After analyzing
nearly 18,000 genes in humans, chimpanzees, rhesus macaques and
orangutans, they have been able to specify substantial differences in the
way genes in the human brain are turned on and off compared with genes in
the brains of the other three species.</TE>
<TE>   The findings underscore how much more needs to be done to locate all
the genetic dissimilarities between chimps and humans and learn which
ones are biologically important.</TE>
<TE>   "We are really just opening the door," said Wolfgang Enard, one of the
study's lead authors and a scientist at the Max Planck Institute for
Evolutionary Biology in Leipzig, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Some scientists study the genetics of chimpanzees or bonobos because
comparing us with our nearest living relatives will deepen the
understanding of who we are and where we came from.</TE>
<TE>   Some, like Oliver Ryder, geneticist at the Center for Reproduction of
Endangered Species at the San Diego Zoo, are especially interested in
what science could do for the welfare of the chimp. Better genetic
information, Ryder says, would help avoid inbreeding in zoos and provide
a better understanding of how the animals migrate in the wild.</TE>
<TE>   Evolutionary biologists hope that a chimp genome project will provide
molecular data about how the human lineage evolved.</TE>
<TE>   And scientists with a medical bent point to the biological differences
between chimps and humans: Chimps don't get AIDS. They don't get malaria.
They seem to have lower rates of cancers common in humans, such as those
of the colon, stomach, breast and prostate.</TE>
<TE>   Understanding the genetic reasons for such differences might
potentially lead to therapies, says Dr. Ajit Varki, a UC San Diego
professor and one of the coauthors of the study published today.</TE>
<TE>   To advance understanding of the chimpanzee's genetic code, Varki and
many of his colleagues are urging the U.S. government to make deciphering
the chimp genome the nation's next big genetic project.</TE>
<TE>   They face competition, however, from advocates of other genetic
projects: the bee, platypus, pig, cow, dog, cat, macaque. The National
Human Genome Research Institute is considering proposals and will
announce its priority decisions in May.</TE>
<TE>   Even chimp enthusiasts agree the animal is in many ways impractical to
study.</TE>
<TE>   It is endangered. And because the animal is so human-like--it's been
compared in demeanor and intelligence to a 2 1/2-year-old
child--scientists balk at experimenting on it. Indeed, there is even a
campaign afoot to grant legal welfare rights to chimps and other great
apes.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the slow life cycle of chimps makes them unlikely
candidates for breeding or mutant experiments, which are common
strategies for learning about the function of genes.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, for ethical reasons, as well as practical ones, chimps cannot be
manipulated like a fruit fly or mouse.</TE>
<TE>   "I would not do anything to a chimp that I would not do to a human,"
Varki said.</TE>
<TE>   Pressing the work ahead is a challenge, said Joseph Hacia, a USC
scientist whose office is festooned with primate decor: monkey calendars,
fuzzy toy orangutans, a chimp sitting on a pile of books pondering a
human skull. "On the one hand, you are doing really cutting-edge
research--but then you reach the roadblocks."</TE>
<TE>   Yet there is information to be gleaned--and high-tech machines like
the ones in Hacia's research lab are providing a lot of the push.</TE>
<TE>   Such machines, for instance, can be used to scan little glass chips
covered with tiny dots of DNA representing many thousands of human genes.</TE>
<TE>   The chips are bathed in an extract of cells taken from chimp or human
tissue. If a gene is switched on in that tissue--manufacturing strands of
RNA that can later be made into protein--the dots corresponding to that
gene will fluoresce. The glow will be bright if the gene is very active,
dimmer if the gene is less active. There will be no glow if the gene is
turned off.</TE>
<TE>   The authors of today's report, published in the journal Science, used
this kind of approach to examine blood, liver and brain tissue samples
from animals that died of natural causes.</TE>
<TE>Humans' Brains Stand Distinct From Chimps'</TE>
<TE>   In the case of blood and liver, the patterns of chimp and human gene
activity were more similar to each other than to the patterns found in
rhesus macaques and orangutans.</TE>
<TE>   When it came to the brain, however, chimps were more similar to the
macaques and orangutans than to people--even though humans are actually
chimps' closer kin. Humans stood out as distinct--as if the human brain
had been the site of especially busy change during the course of our
evolution.</TE>
<TE>   Such gene regulation differences are hugely important in biology: A
brain cell and a skin cell both contain a full set of genes. They differ
because only some of those genes are active in each type of cell.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, scientists suspect that many chimp-human differences will
be caused by slightly different control of genes that both species share.
Certain genes may be cranked up higher in one species than in the other
or turned on earlier, later or in a different part of the body.</TE>
<TE>   But there are other genetic alterations that might be important. A
gene may be totally inactivated in one species. Or a gene may mutate so
that the protein it encodes has brand-new functions.</TE>
<TE>   Each of these kinds of changes might have profound consequences for
development: perhaps causing embryonic brain cells to divide more times
as an individual grows, thus creating a larger brain; or maybe creating
subtle alterations in bone growth that help make walking upright easier.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, scientists also recognize that much of the 1% to 2%
difference between chimp and human genomes will have little or no
consequence.</TE>
<TE>   As they seek to find the changes that are important, some scientists
have decided to examine genes one by one rather than scan thousands at a
time.</TE>
<TE>   Varki and his UC San Diego colleague Pascal Gagneux, for instance,
have been studying a gene that is involved in creating a certain type of
sugar. The sugar decorates the surfaces of cells in many species--dogs,
cats, mice and chimps--but not the cells of humans.</TE>
<TE>   Varki and Gagneux discovered the apparent reason: Several million
years ago, after the lineages of chimps and humans diverged, a key human
gene was inactivated.</TE>
<TE>   It's possible (though still highly speculative) that the inaction of

<TE>Seeking Clues for Differences in Aging</TE>
<TE>   Other scientists are exploring chimp-human differences in aging and
diet.</TE>
<TE>   We live longer than chimps: In the wild they live 40 to 45 years, and
even in zoos they only live to about 55 to 60 years. Humans, under the
best of conditions, can live decades longer than that. Evolutionary
biologists speculate that we evolved a longer life span because our
culture is so complex and our young require long periods of rearing and
learning in order to reach full productivity.</TE>
<TE>   If human aging is slower than chimp aging, one might be able to
discover the genetic reasons why, said Caleb Finch, director of USC's
Alzheimer's Disease Research Center.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems plausible that we may be able to discover genes that modify
human aging and that could be new targets of intervention in disease," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Finch believes that a gene called ApoE may be involved in this aging
difference. Chimps and humans have the gene. But the gene exists in more
than one form. All chimps examined so far have a version of the gene
that--when it is present in humans--is known to increase the risk of
Alzheimer's, a disease associated with aging. Most human beings have a
form of the gene that confers a lower risk.</TE>
<TE>   Finch suspects that as humans evolved, the low-risk version of the
gene became more prevalent in human populations because those carrying
the lower-risk gene would be more likely to live longer.</TE>
<TE>   The ApoE gene may also be involved in another difference between the
two species--one involving diet. Humans eat a lot more meat than chimps,
and not surprisingly, chimps are less adept at dealing with all the fat
that such greasy fare provides.</TE>
<TE>   "The same amount of fat that will do nothing to us will triple the
chimp's blood cholesterol," says chimp expert Craig Stanford, head of
USC's anthropology department, who is collaborating with Finch.
"Something happened in our ancestry--a genetic change happened, a
mutation--that allowed us to deal with eating meat."</TE>
<TE>Seeking Answers to Ourselves</TE>
<TE>   The version of the ApoE gene that all chimps carry is associated with
a higher risk for heart disease and a lowered ability to manage a
high-fat diet. The ApoE gene that most humans have, by contrast, is
better at handling high fat.</TE>
<TE>   A better understanding of such health-related differences may well
have the potential to help people. Still, many researchers say that is
only one reason--and not necessarily the strongest one--for studying the
chimpanzee.</TE>
<TE>   For many, the main reason is the inherent fascination with
understanding a creature that is so like us, but so different.</TE>
<TE>   "I think," says Ryder, "it's as natural for us to want to understand
that as to ask why the stars are up there."</TE>

<HD>Israeli Army Accused of Atrocities</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Residents of Jenin say soldiers targeted civilians and
gunmen alike.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JENIN, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Khadra Samara, her family and closest neighbors lived in three
adjacent cinder-block houses on Rwabe Street, a relatively quiet corner
of the Palestinian refugee camp here.</LD>
<LD>   For 17 terrifying hours this week, she says, the 30 unarmed neighbors
fled on hands and knees from one three-story home to the next, huddling
together as Israeli helicopter gunships, tanks and bulldozers reduced the
buildings to rubble in methodical succession.</LD>
<LD>   Israel's fiercest assault of its 2-week-old West Bank operation dealt
systematic destruction and random death to civilians as well as fighters
in this militant Palestinian stronghold, according to displaced residents
of the camp and relief workers in Jenin. The battle was all but over
Thursday with the surrender of dozens of Palestinians, the last holdouts
among an estimated 200 fighters.</LD>
<TE>   According to the accounts, which couldn't be independently verified,
the Israelis fired on unarmed civilians, used them as human shields and
obstructed medical workers trying to save the wounded. One camp resident,
Ali Ramile, a 40-year-old truck driver, said he watched Israeli soldiers
kill seven or eight disarmed Palestinian fighters execution-style and
dump several loads of bodies in a mass grave within 100 yards of his
home.</TE>
<TE>   Brig. Gen. Eyal Shline, commander of the division that invaded Jenin,
dismissed Palestinian allegations of atrocities during the fighting. The
army denied that it had buried or removed Palestinian bodies, saying it
feared that they might be booby-trapped.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no massacre," Shline said. "We could have taken the camp in
one day. But we didn't use planes or artillery" in order to spare
civilians. "But someone who has decided to give up his village and use
his children and elderly for terror is going to get hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Early today, the army estimated that hundreds of Palestinians were
killed in fighting in Jenin. Palestinian estimates ranged up to 500. Dr.
Hussam Sherkawi, Palestinian director of emergency services in the West
Bank, said the death toll was at least 140 but cautioned that it was
impossible to verify because rescue services hadn't been permitted to
enter Jenin.</TE>
<TE>   Israel said its West Bank offensive was aimed at rooting out suicide
bombers and other armed militants who inflicted heavy civilian casualties
in Israel last month.</TE>
<TE>   But interviews with more than a dozen Palestinians from the Jenin camp
indicated a heavy loss of civilian life there. Nearly everyone
interviewed said they had watched neighbors die from Israeli shelling or
sniper fire, or at least seen bodies in the street.</TE>
<TE>   And Palestinian human rights organizations, citing reports that they
said came from camp residents and witnesses, have accused Israeli troops
of executing prisoners and digging graves in the camp. There was no
independent confirmation of the reports because Israel denies access to
the area.</TE>
<TE>   Jenin's Al Razi hospital was struggling to cope with the West Bank's
worst bloodshed since the 1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten days ago, we hoped someone could do something to save the refugee
camp, but now the camp is gone," said Dr. Ziad Ayaseh, the hospital's
director.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli missiles took out several water tanks on the roof, threatening
the hospital's water supply, he said. The army siege blocked fuel
supplies that power the hospital's generator--the only source of electric
power. The staff pharmacologist and urologist were slightly wounded by
apparently stray army gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   A 16-year-old boy was shot dead Thursday on a street in Jenin, half an
hour after the army had lifted a curfew to allow the city's residents to
move about for the first time in five days, hospital officials say. A
52-year-old woman wounded Monday inside her home in the refugee camp bled
to death before relatives could get her to the hospital Thursday, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sameh Abazeineh, an aide to Jenin's mayor, said his 70-year-old
neighbor died waving his arms in the air in a futile effort to stop an
Israeli bulldozer from destroying his home in the camp.</TE>
<TE>   Other residents reported seeing a tank round kill a neighbor who was
recharging his cellular phone with his car battery and finding the body
of a mentally disabled neighbor who had been shot and run over by a tank.</TE>
<TE>   Riad Ghaleb, a 28-year-old produce merchant, said the Israelis
targeted his entire camp neighborhood, Damaj, after three soldiers died
there in an ambush. Helicopter gunships fired on rows of densely packed
homes, killing two young boys in their home, he charged.</TE>
<TE>   "After that, I saw five bulldozers and three tanks come in," said
Ghaleb, who walked out of the camp into central Jenin on Thursday. "Now
there are no more houses in my neighborhood. It's all a big highway now."</TE>
<TE>   The extent of destruction in the camp was unclear.</TE>
<TE>   News agency reporters Thursday managed to tour a small corner of the
camp, which had been off limits to journalists during eight days of
combat. They saw widespread devastation--homes flattened by bulldozers,
walls blackened by fire and the streets chewed up by armored vehicles.
They saw no bodies in the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Roughly one-third of Jenin's 40,000 people lived in cinder-block
houses on the refugee camp's narrow streets. The army used bulldozers to
knock down homes and clear the way for its tanks to corner the militants
in a smaller and smaller perimeter in the camp.</TE>
<TE>   One bulldozer also wreaked destruction in the center of Jenin as it
moved behind a tank along Old Castle Street toward the refugee camp. Just
before Ahmed and Bassam Fashafsheh's stone home, the street narrowed and
the tank couldn't squeeze by.</TE>
<TE>   Issam Fashafsheh, a relative, said he watched early this week as the
tank fired a missile into the house, backed up and moved aside so the
bulldozer could advance. The bulldozer knocked in the wall of the living
room, killing the middle-aged couple and their 9-year-old son, Samira.</TE>
<TE>   Their bodies were recovered and buried only Thursday, and a stench
remained in the ruins of the home--a mound of rubble topped by a fallen
television antenna and snaking electrical wires.</TE>
<TE>   When Israeli troops entered the camp on foot to search homes for armed
militants, they sent captive Palestinian men ahead of them at gunpoint to
knock on the doors or break through the walls. The army has acknowledged
the practice, saying it discourages armed resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Ali Mustafa Sireh, 42, said he was working as such a door-to-door
human shield in the refugee camp when, at the 10th house, he was shot in
the knee by Israeli snipers who apparently did not see his captors. At
that point, he said, the Israelis abandoned him, and it took four days
for relatives to get him to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   But few experiences capture the terror of the assault like that told
by Khadra Samara, 33, whose husband, Hisham, 40, is the Al Razi
hospital's cook.</TE>
<TE>   She first noticed a tank outside her home at 11 p.m. Sunday, she said.
At 11:30, it knocked down the front gate. "We screamed and lighted
candles to make the Israelis aware that people were in the house," she
said, but the tank kept coming. It fired a missile into the second and
third floors, she said, causing a bright flash, shattering the windows
and sending all 15 people in the home to the ground floor.</TE>
<TE>   The demolition halted until 5 a.m., when the household was awakened by
the sound of a bulldozer outside. It slammed into the front of the house,
crashing into a large bedroom in which the family had been sleeping, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Houses in the camp abut each other, so Samara and her relatives
hammered a hole in a side wall and broke in next door, where her
sister-in-law's family lives.</TE>
<TE>   Less than an hour later, she said, that house came under attack, and
30 people crawled through to the next house in line, which had been
abandoned. That refuge stood up until 3 p.m. Monday, when it fell after a
three-hour bulldozer assault, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We moved from the bedroom to the bathroom to the kitchen--wherever we
thought was safest," Samara said. "The children started vomiting. I
phoned the hospital. My husband said to leave the camp immediately. I
demanded an ambulance. He said the Israelis won't let one through."</TE>
<TE>   It took them five more hours to talk their way through Israeli
checkpoints and reach the hospital, waving white prayer scarves and
dodging stun grenades from helicopters that followed them.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so furious," Samara said. "I felt like committing a suicide
bombing against the Israelis."</TE>
<TE>   At one point, she said, she went to the kitchen of her collapsing home
and picked up a cooking gas cylinder to use as a bomb. But she changed
her mind after her 12-year-old daughter begged her not to do it.</TE>

<HD>Law Prompts Suicide Bid by Serb Indictee</HD>
<DH>Yugoslavia: Ex-official at risk of extradition on war crimes
charges is near death after shooting himself at the parliament.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia
</DL>
<LD>A former Serbian government official accused of crimes against
humanity shot himself on the steps of Yugoslavia's parliament Thursday,
just hours after the passage of a controversial law easing the transfer
of war crimes suspects to an international tribunal in the Netherlands.</LD>
<LD>   The incident set off a political maelstrom and almost certainly will
undermine the status of the reform government in Belgrade, which has been
trying to comply with international mandates in bringing war criminals to
justice.</LD>
<LD>   Vlajko Stojiljkovic, a former Serbian interior minister and one of
several figures indicted with former Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic for alleged war crimes, went to the parliament building in
Belgrade, handed a letter to an ultranationalist legislator, then fired a
shot into his own head. Late Thursday evening he was near death in a
Belgrade hospital.</LD>
<TE>   In the letter, he blamed Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica and
Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, among others, for his decision to
kill himself, and accused them of collaborating with Western countries
that aided the breakup of the Yugoslav federation. He accused the
government leaders of being "marionettes of the greatest enemy of our
people, Javier Solana [and of] carrying out a policy of treason and
capitulation." Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief, was
NATO's secretary-general at the time of the alliance's 1999 air campaign
against Yugoslavia.</TE>
<TE>   The leaders of Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic, in effect set the
country's policy. Djindjic was the key architect of Milosevic's arrest
and extradition last year, which was carried out despite resistance from
political rivals. Milosevic is now on trial in The Hague for his alleged
role in atrocities committed by his troops in Kosovo, a Serbian province,
and in Bosnia-Herzego-vina and Croatia.</TE>
<TE>   The text of Stojiljkovic's suicide letter was released by a member of
the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party and was widely broadcast on
television and radio.</TE>
<TE>   It had been expected that Stojiljkovic, 64, would be turned over to
the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The
Hague shortly after the law's passage. Two other indictees expected to be
transferred are Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic, a former army chief of staff, and
Nikola Sainovic, a former deputy prime minister and now a member of the
Yugoslav parliament.</TE>
<TE>   In his position as interior minister of Serbia, Stojiljkovic
controlled the secret police and other law enforcement agencies and was
believed to have been present at strategy meetings for military
operations in Kosovo, whose population is predominantly ethnic Albanian.</TE>
<TE>   During 1998 and 1999, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians were
expelled from their homes and forced to flee the province for the
neighboring countries of Macedonia and Albania. About 10,000 Kosovo
Albanians were killed in 1998 and 1999. Yugoslav and Serbian forces left
the province only after weeks of bombing by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.</TE>
<TE>   Liberals in Serbia, who want the government to cooperate with the
Hague court and face the dark history of the last decade, fear that the
suicide attempt will undermine efforts both to apprehend war crimes
suspects and to keep a reform government in power.</TE>
<TE>   "This event will be used by individuals and the political parties that
have advocated openly against cooperation with The Hague," said Sonja
Biserko, director of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia.</TE>
<TE>   "As it was, the law that was passed was a compromise. . . . This
indicates how deeply our society was involved in support for Milosevic,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Several political analysts said the suicide attempt was shocking, even
though Stojiljkovic had told family, friends and political associates
that he would never go to The Hague alive. Still, the long-term political
implications were worrisome for reformers.</TE>
<TE>   "Such a tragic event of course will have impact on the Serbian
political scene," said Bratislav Grubacic, a political analyst in
Belgrade, the Serbian and Yugoslav capital. "It leaves a sort of bitter
taste in people's mouths and further decreases the popularity of the
Serbian government."</TE>
<TE>   The extradition law, which applies to about 20 suspects thought to be
in Yugoslavia, was approved by an 80-39 vote in the 138-seat lower house.
The 40-seat upper house approved the law Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Justice and police officials have said that they expect those war
crimes suspects who are still in Serbia to be handed over to The Hague in
the next couple of weeks. However, two of the most notorious
indictees--Gen. Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb political leader
Radovan Karadzic--were not expected to be among them.</TE>
<TE>   Mladic, who at one time was thought to be in Belgrade, either has left
Yugoslavia or is keeping a very low profile. And Karadzic, who is charged
in such atrocities as the killing of more than 7,000 Muslim boys and men
in Srebrenica, is believed to be in Bosnia and therefore beyond the
purview of Yugoslav authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The law was passed only after extensive negotiation among Yugoslav
politicians and under heavy pressure from the international community.
Strongly opposed by Milosevic supporters, it allows a judge to issue
arrest warrants and order police to detain suspects. A suspect's transfer
to the tribunal would occur within a week, allowing time for appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Congress had set a March 31 deadline for financially strained
Yugoslavia to cooperate with the tribunal or lose about $40 million in
annual assistance as well as American support for loans from
organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</TE>

<HD>Swiss Give Their Berlin Envoy the Boot</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: The ouster of Thomas Borer and his equally flamboyant
wife follows his alleged affair with a model.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN
</DL>
<LD>It was front-page news in all the best-read German dailies
Thursday--not the state visit of the Chinese president or the frightful
violence in the Middle East, but the unceremonious ouster of Berlin's
most flamboyant diplomatic couple.</LD>
<LD>   Swiss Ambassador Thomas Borer and his Texas beauty queen wife, Shawne
Fielding, have been recalled to his Alpine homeland in the wake of a
tabloid expose on an affair he claims he never had with a model
photographed leaving the embassy last month at nearly 3 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   Borer's protestations of innocence fell on deaf ears in Bern, the
Swiss capital, which has ordered him out of the Berlin posting by month's
end.</LD>
<TE>   "The private lives of my colleagues don't interest me, as long as it
doesn't hinder the carrying out of their duties," Swiss Foreign Minister
Joseph Deiss told reporters. "I have come to the conclusion that under
the given circumstances, Borer is no longer effective or in possession of
the dignity and necessary composure and credibility to fulfill his
mission."</TE>
<TE>   German media, which have made the flashy couple fixtures on gossip and
society pages throughout their three-year reign here as the ultimate
party pair, jumped to the defense of their diplomatic darlings.</TE>
<TE>   "Ambassador Toppled by Nude Model: Sex Affair or Smear Campaign?" the
country's largest-circulation daily, Bild, demanded in its lead story. It
featured an unusually staid photo of the couple alongside the headlined
umbrage.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest in a string of scandals surrounding Borer and his wife,
the ambassador is alleged to have repeatedly entertained a German model
in the embassy after hours. The Swiss tabloid Sonntags Blick ran an
incriminating series of photos showing a woman entering and leaving the
embassy in the wee hours of March 21. The glossy Bunte magazine followed
with an interview with the 34-year-old model and beautician, Djamila
Rowe, in which she claims to have had sex with Borer, including on the
embassy's state conference table.</TE>
<TE>   Fielding, a dozen years Borer's junior and the more frequent source of
his professional troubles, provoked warnings from the Swiss Foreign
Ministry less than a year ago when she appeared in a titillating photo
spread in the German magazine Max. Fielding, a former Miss Dallas and
Mrs. Texas America, was told to restrain her modeling pursuits.</TE>
<TE>   Borer has made headlines for arriving at a 1999 Halloween party
dressed only in a leotard affixed with leaves--he was impersonating
autumn--and for brushing off his wife's propensity for snuggling with
other men in public as something she does only with homosexuals. One
heterosexual pop star begged to differ by threatening a defamation suit.</TE>
<TE>   Although German media have previously participated in the frenzy of
scandal-mongering and speculation, even mainstream dailies such as Die
Welt and Berliner Morgenpost presented the couple's deposing as an
unfathomable injustice.</TE>
<TE>   "Berlin without Shawne is like a cake without frosting," Juergen
Schau, Columbia TriStar's chief in Germany, lamented to Morgenpost.
Society figure Countess Isa von Hardenberg called the couple's diplomatic
deportation "a loss for Berlin." Even Berlin Mayor Klaus Wowereit--a
regular on the capital's party circuit--issued a statement of praise for
Borer.</TE>
<TE>   In a front-page commentary, however, the newspaper Berliner Zeitung
suggested that Borer had pushed the circumspect Swiss too far.</TE>
<TE>   "In Berlin, Borer wanted to represent a modern Switzerland, but he
lost the balance between politician and party-goer," the newspaper said,
surmising that the ambassador erred in letting himself get trapped by
sensation-seeking tabloids.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Borer nor Fielding, who were vacationing in Mauritius when
they received news of their recall, could be reached for comment. An
embassy spokeswoman said there would be no official statements.</TE>

<HD>An International Criminal Court Comes Into Being; U.S. Stays Away</HD>
<DH>Law: Tribunal is ratified and a new era in human rights declared.
Bush administration will seek a 'divorce' from treaty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>As dignitaries from around the world gathered here Thursday to
celebrate the ratification of the International Criminal Court, State
Department officials said the United States will take steps to "divorce"
itself from the new global tribunal.</LD>
<LD>   "A page in the history of humankind is being turned," Hans Corell, the
U.N. undersecretary for legal affairs, said as the U.N. received
ratification documents from 10 more nations in a ceremony here, passing
the threshold of 60 countries needed to put the court in business.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration would like to see that page turned back, U.S.
officials said a few hours later. The "crimes against humanity" that the
new court intends to prosecute--including genocide and war
atrocities--would be better handled nationally, argued Pierre-Richard
Prosper, the U.S. ambassador at large for war crimes issues, in a
conference call with reporters covering the ratification.</LD>
<TE>   In the packed U.N. chamber where delegates gathered Thursday morning
to witness the ceremony, the U.S. seat was left conspicuously vacant--a
deliberate signal, Prosper said, of U.S. disaffection. "We felt there was
no role for us to play, and no need for us to attend," he said. "Our
intention is to be divorced from the process."</TE>
<TE>   President Clinton signed the treaty three weeks before leaving office.
The Bush administration said almost immediately that it would not submit
the treaty for Senate ratification, and now says that it will not
cooperate with the new court.</TE>
<TE>   "An action that is under consideration is annulling the signature,"
Prosper said--a move "making clear that we continue to oppose the treaty,
and do not intend to become a party."</TE>
<TE>   Other U.S. officials said privately that the administration has
already decided to revoke Clinton's signature but out of deference to
allies here agreed to postpone the action while the U.N. continues its
weeklong preparatory meetings for the new court.</TE>
<TE>   The United States could also use its veto power in the Security
Council to prevent the council from exercising its treaty option to refer
cases to the new court, Prosper said.</TE>
<TE>   With 66 national ratifications now deposited with the U.N., the
International Criminal Court will come into effect legally July 1 and
physically in the spring of 2003, when judges should be ready to hear
cases in their new chambers in The Hague.</TE>
<TE>   "I know there are countries who have reservations and have indicated
that they will not sign on," Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general, said
in a simultaneous ceremony in Rome, where the treaty was negotiated and
adopted in 1998. "But I think it should not hold back those countries
that are determined to go ahead and ensure that this missing link in
international law is established. I also believe that those who today are
not enthusiastic will over time come to recognize the importance and
usefulness of the court."</TE>

<LD>A U.S. soldier was convicted in Mannheim, Germany, of drowning her
children in a bathtub in what prosecutors said was an "evil" effort to
get back at her husband, whom she suspected of being unfaithful.</LD>
<LD>   Spc. Lillie Morgan, 22, of Marksville, La., could face life in prison.</LD>
<LD>   By convicting Morgan, an Army judge rejected defense arguments that
she was so mentally disturbed Sept. 18 that she did not recognize she was

<HD>A 'Currency' Born of Argentina's Crisis</HD>
<DH>Finance: Bonds become legal tender--and an issue for the IMF.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALTA, Argentina
</DL>
<LD>The bills look a bit like real Argentine pesos but of a cheaper
quality. Imagine a copy of a dollar made by a laser printer--the ink
fades if you leave it in your wallet too long.</LD>
<LD>   The funny money has become a de facto currency here and in many other
corners of this troubled country.</LD>
<LD>   They are federal bonds, issued, as the fine writing on the back says,
as a result of "an administrative, economic and financial emergency."
They have flooded the city, filling up cash registers at the
supermarkets, gathered up in large wads in the pockets of newspaper
vendors and taxi drivers.</LD>
<TE>   This week, the provincial bonds are at the center of tense discussions
between the Argentine government and visiting representatives of the
International Monetary Fund. The two sides are hoping to hammer out an
agreement that will help rescue Argentina from its economic abyss and
avoid another round of defaults on its $141-billion public debt.</TE>
<TE>   Near the top of the IMF agenda is the removal of 14 different
provincial bonds from circulation. Provincial bonds now constitute about
one-third of the currency in use.</TE>
<TE>   The bonds, IMF representative Anoop Singh told reporters in Buenos
Aires on Wednesday, "have worsened the economic crisis, increased the
risk of inflation and lowered confidence in the structure of public
finance."</TE>
<TE>   But officials in Salta and other provinces say they wouldn't be able
to pay their bills--and hundreds of thousands of employees--without them.
The bonds are the product of a long-running standoff between the federal
government and the provinces over the distribution of an ever-shrinking
pie of tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure from the international financial community to reduce
government spending, federal authorities sharply cut outlays to the
provinces during the last four years. Tens of thousands of government
workers have been laid off. But when many of Argentina's governors
finally insisted last year that they couldn't cut any further, the
government printed the Letters of Cancellation of Provincial
Obligations--lecops for short.</TE>
<TE>   Other provinces have issued their own currencies to help cover their
budget shortfalls. Tucuman issues the bocade, and Formosa the bocanfor.
The most widely circulated is the patacon printed by Buenos Aires
province.</TE>
<TE>   In Salta, the beginning of each month sees a flood of lecops as
provincial workers cash their paychecks. People who buy goods in pesos
are apt to receive lecops as change. By law, provincial businesses must
accept lecops. But the bonds are not necessarily worth anything in other
Argentine cities.</TE>
<TE>   "If you try to spend them in Buenos Aires, no one will take them,"
said Luis Schuller, a tour operator in the community of San Lorenzo, near
the city of Salta, the provincial capital.</TE>
<TE>   The situation doesn't sit well with Juan Carlos Romero, the governor
of Salta province.</TE>
<TE>   "These bills aren't our paper," said Romero, who is considering
running for president in the election scheduled for next year. "It's
paper that the federal government is going to have to replace with real
money one day."</TE>
<TE>   Still, given the choice between getting lecops from the federal
government or getting nothing at all, Romero said, "we'll take however
many lecops they want to give us. And I think any province would."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Romero was in Buenos Aires to meet with other governors
negotiating with the federal government and the IMF team led by Singh.
Provincial governments will have to reduce their collective deficits by
60% as a condition for further IMF loans, Singh said.</TE>
<TE>   Many governors are balking at the cuts. But they seem inevitable,
given the sharp drop in tax receipts, which were down 30% in March
compared with last year.</TE>
<TE>   "If the economy doesn't start growing, if tax revenue doesn't start
going up again, then we are going to enter a period of profound crisis, a
collapse," Romero said. "And that will have very grave social
consequences."</TE>
<TE>   Singh is set to leave for Washington this week. He said an IMF team
will return to Argentina to finalize the terms of a loan--but only if the
organization's conditions are met.</TE>

<HD>U.S., Russia Grapple With Arms Issues</HD>
<DH>Security: Powell and his counterpart fail to resolve differences on
reductions. The nations seek to reach a pact before summit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MADRID
</DL>
<LD>Preparing for next month's U.S.-Russia summit, Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell met here Thursday with Russian Foreign Minister Igor S.
Ivanov but failed to resolve central issues of a new nuclear arms
reduction agreement.</LD>
<LD>   Both sides still hope that an accord codifying their new strategic
relationship will be the centerpiece of the summit.</LD>
<LD>   However, significant differences remain on how to count the number of
nuclear warheads in their arsenals. After months of tough negotiations,
the two nations have agreed to reduce their warheads by about two-thirds
over the next decade--to between 1,700 and 2,200 on each side. The
current range is 6,000 to 7,000 warheads.</LD>
<TE>   Russia argues that the count must be based on the actual number of
warheads, while the United States wants it to be focused on launchers,
even if a launch platform can hold six warheads. In addition, the United
States proposes keeping some decommissioned weapons in storage.</TE>
<TE>   Both issues are important to Moscow because Russia no longer can
afford to support a larger arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   At a joint news conference, Ivanov described the reductions as the
"most complex" issue in the negotiations and said that Russia wants the
reductions to "be real, not virtual."</TE>
<TE>   A second major issue still to be resolved is how to prove that the two
nations have made cuts and are not developing new warheads. Russian
President Vladimir V. Putin wants a more formalized agreement partly in
order to stipulate these matters.</TE>
<TE>   "Discussions are progressing, but some tough issues are still to be
dealt with," said a senior State Department official traveling with
Powell. "Both sides want to show there's a new strategic relationship and
that they're doing a lot together."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration originally balked at signing anything
resembling a new treaty. But with Powell prevailing in discussions within
the U.S. government, the two countries now are aiming for a less formal
but legally binding agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be short, to the point. It will talk about reductions down to
the levels that both presidents have announced and how we satisfy
ourselves with how we will get to those levels, plus the usual other
various items that one would find in such an agreement," Powell told
reporters traveling with him.</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, "it will include, hopefully, all of the transparency
and rollover of previous verification provisions that we've had on other
treaties."</TE>
<TE>   Powell and Ivanov exchanged new drafts in Madrid. The United States
provided a proposal on how to count the arms reductions, and the Russians
provided a new proposal on transparency.</TE>
<TE>   The senior State Department official said there is a fundamental
difference between the proposed new agreement and past treaties, which
were based on distrust.</TE>
<TE>   Ivanov said "intensive negotiations" would continue in advance of the
late May summit in Moscow and St. Petersburg.</TE>
<TE>   In an indication of how the Middle East and South Asia are dominating

<HD>Israel Mops Up in the West Bank as Fighting Slows</HD>
<DH>Incursion: Sharon reiterates that troops will remain in key cities
until 'terrorists' surrender. Palestinians vow counterattack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>The Israeli-Palestinian conflict slowed Thursday after two weeks of
fighting, as Israeli troops mopped up in combat-torn areas, carried out
targeted raids and withdrew from 24 Palestinian villages.</LD>
<LD>   The pause was by no means a peace. Aborted plots by suspected
Palestinian suicide bombers, one of whom died in an apparently premature
explosion, showed that Israel still faces a terrorist menace. And
Palestinians counted their dead on the battlefields of devastated
Israeli-held sites such as Jenin and Nablus, trying to assess the toll of
the West Bank offensive.</LD>
<LD>   That panorama greeted Secretary of State Colin L. Powell as he arrived
here for a high-stakes mediation mission Thursday night. Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian leaders welcomed Powell with
warnings that they do not intend to back down.</LD>
<TE>   Sharon said he had already informed U.S. officials that his troops
would not withdraw from key cities until he believed that the threat from
militants had been eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   "The army is not leaving Nablus, Jenin, Bethlehem or Ramallah until
the surrender of the terrorists in those cities," Sharon told Israeli
police commanders here. "The army will reenter any place if necessary;
such has happened this morning in Tulkarm."</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli leader was referring to a raid by soldiers, backed by
tanks and helicopters, on the home of a suspected suicide bomber in the
village of Tulkarm early Thursday. Troops apprehended Shiffa Adnan Qudsi,
24, who allegedly planned to carry out an attack in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Qudsi, whose brother was also arrested, planned to
pretend she was pregnant and strap explosives to her belly in order to
get past Israeli military checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   In Hebron, a 22-year-old activist in the radical Islamic group Hamas
died when explosives he was carrying blew up. Several passersby were
wounded in the blast, which Israeli authorities said occurred as the man
was en route to commit an attack.</TE>
<TE>   And the Israeli military reported that it had found an explosives belt
of the type used by suicide bombers in a Palestinian ambulance stopped at
a checkpoint. The belt was concealed under a body.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas and other extremist groups plan a fierce counterattack against
the Israelis, said Abdel Majid Atta, a Hamas political leader in the
Bethlehem area.</TE>
<TE>   "The damage of this military operation to the Palestinian resistance
will be insignificant because such operations encourage and increase the
resistance," Atta said in a phone interview from an undisclosed location.
"In our Arab tradition, if anybody is killed unjustly, people have a
relative who will seek revenge. . . . [The resistance] is capable of
recovering very fast."</TE>
<TE>   Atta scoffed at Powell's hopes of bringing peace.</TE>
<TE>   "If Bush and Powell wanted to stop the incursions, they could have
stopped them," he said. "Powell does not have the power to implement a
key decision that stops the bloodshed."</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, an exasperated President Bush demanded that Israel
withdraw "without delay" from the Palestinian cities it had invaded. But
on Thursday, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer took pains to
insist that Bush isn't growing impatient with Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   He emphasized that the demands the president has placed on Israel,
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat and leaders of Arab nations
have gone unmet--and that not only Sharon is to blame.</TE>
<TE>   "The president recognizes that all contribute to what's happening in
the Middle East, and he called on all to take certain steps," he said.
"No one nation bears the burden or the responsibility of what's happening
in the Middle East today."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Israeli tanks entered the Palestinian towns of Birzeit and
Dahariya and the Ein Beit Elma refugee camp near Nablus. Troops seized
Birzeit University and government buildings, making numerous arrests.</TE>
<TE>   But the military pulled out of two dozen villages and announced plans
to withdraw from more.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday brought a skirmish in the Gaza Strip, which has not been a
target of the Israeli military during this offensive. Palestinian gunmen
tried to attack an Israeli settlement and got into a shootout with
Israeli troops, who killed one attacker, the military said.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of Palestinians marched in the Gaza Strip to protest the
death toll in the Jenin refugee camp, the bloodiest battlefield of the
conflict. The Palestinian Authority issued a statement urging the
international community to intervene and "stop these Nazi massacres of
our people."</TE>
<TE>   The death toll among Palestinians has been put at about 200 but is
sure to rise. Some estimates indicate that 200 fighters died in ferocious
combat in the Jenin camp alone. That final outpost of resistance fell
Thursday when about 30 gunmen surrendered.</TE>
<TE>   The gunmen joined the ranks of 4,185 Palestinians detained in the
operation.</TE>
<TE>   With the fall of Jenin, perhaps the most problematic remaining zone of
conflict for both sides is Bethlehem. The town is under Israeli control,
but more than 140 armed Palestinians remained holed up in the historic
Church of the Nativity, revered as the site where Jesus was born, along
with almost 80 clerics, monks and nuns.</TE>
<TE>   Monks inside the compound reported Thursday that conditions were
deteriorating. The Israeli military confirmed Thursday that an Armenian
monk wounded by gunfire a day earlier was mistakenly shot by an Israeli
soldier.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer James Gerstenzang in Washington contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>PLO Evicted From Its Office in Washington</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Palestine Liberation Organization has been evicted from its
downtown Washington office for failure to pay rent.</LD>
<LD>   Hassan Abdel Rahman, the PLO's chief representative in Washington, on
Thursday confirmed the eviction, first reported by the Jerusalem Post,
and said the reasons were political.</LD>
<LD>   He acknowledged that rental payments had been in arrears but said
similar problems in the past had been resolved amicably with the
landlord. This time, he said, the landlord would not negotiate.</LD>
<TE>   He attributed the eviction to widespread sympathy for Israel in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "Pro-Israeli sentiment is making life a little bit difficult for us,"
he said. The eviction is part of an effort "to isolate and shut off the
Palestinian voice." In effect, the landlord said, "No, we don't want
you," Rahman said, adding that his aides have been looking for new
quarters.</TE>
<TE>   The property management company, Cushman &amp; Wakefield, said in a
statement that the PLO's rent payments were in arrears for an extended
period for the second time in less than a year, resulting in a "judgment
for possession" that led to the PLO's vacating the property April 6.</TE>

<HD>Liberal American Jews Leaning Right</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Angry over suicide attacks and frustrated with Arafat,
more now back Sharon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg is a founder of Americans for Peace Now,
formed more than 20 years ago to pressure Israel into withdrawing from
the Palestinian territories. As such, he is firmly aligned with the
liberal wing of American Jewry.</LD>
<LD>   But these days, the 80-year-old scholar of Jewish studies finds
himself in an unusual place, foursquare behind Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon and his hard-edged approach to the Palestinian conflict.</LD>
<LD>   "What's coming out of Washington is sheer hypocrisy," said Hertzberg,
who taught generations of students at Dartmouth College and Columbia
University. "You cannot be spending lives and treasure uprooting Al Qaeda
and preparing to kill Saddam Hussein and then say to Israel, 'You've got
to stay still.' We are being had."</LD>
<TE>   As Secretary of State Colin L. Powell begins meetings in Israel today
to press the government for restraint by the military and new
negotiations with the Palestinians, a small group of once-fervent
peaceniks is watching to make sure that he gives Sharon enough room--and
time--to complete the current military operation in the West Bank. Angry
at the suicide bombings, worried about growing anti-Semitism, these
liberals now fully support Sharon's drive to root out terrorism in the
territories.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard so many liberal Jews say that after all the suicide
bombings, there's nothing else to do," said Gary Tobin, president of the
Institute for Jewish and Community Research in San Francisco. "If Israel
stands still and lets her babies get blown up, the society won't
survive."</TE>
<TE>   Long reviled for his policy of expanding Israeli settlements into
Palestinian areas, Sharon is now seen in a more sympathetic light. Like
Democrats embracing a Republican president's war on terrorism, some
liberal American Jews are rallying to Israel's Likud leadership, no
matter its political stripe, at a time of national peril.</TE>
<TE>   "The Jewish community as a whole is united with Israel in its current
battle against Palestinian terrorism," said Jack Rosen, president of the
American Jewish Congress. "Some may differ on the aggressive tactics
being used. Some would argue that isolating [Palestinian Authority
President] Yasser Arafat is not a sound decision. But those are nuances.
The priority now is Israel defending its citizens."</TE>
<TE>   James Zogby, who monitors public opinion among Arab Americans, has
also seen the hardening of views among Jews in e-mails and phone calls
from his counterparts. "From the e-mails I've gotten, it's clear people
were shaken by the Passover attack," said Zogby, president of the Arab
American Institute. "The same progressive voices are still being
heard--Peace Now hasn't stopped being Peace Now--but there has definitely
been a hardening."</TE>
<TE>   Zogby also notes a hardening of opinion among Palestinian Americans,
many of whom have family members in Ramallah and Bethlehem, under siege
and unable to call relatives in the United States. He worries that the
increasing polarization between the two camps will make a return to the
peace table more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone on the Jewish left is prepared to embrace Sharon's
military operations. Many liberals were relieved at President Bush's
decision to engage in the peace process, believing that U.S. intervention
is the only hope for an end to the decades-long conflict. Many are
convinced that Israel must leave the settlements that dot Palestinian
communities, the islands of Israeli occupation that only incite
resentment.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel ought to get the hell out of the West Bank," Hertzberg said.
"That won't buy peace. There is no peace without a solution to the
Palestinian refugee problem. But it will buy quiet."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, hundreds showed up Wednesday night at a meeting called
by the Progressive Jewish Alliance to discuss how to back Israel without
supporting Sharon's military incursion. "We're pro-Israel, pro-peace and
pro-human rights," said executive director Daniel Sokatch.</TE>
<TE>   And Sunday night, at a glittering black-tie fund-raiser for the Israel
Policy Forum on New York's trendy Chelsea Pier, the biggest cheer of the
evening came when planners broadcast on a wide-screen television a
videotape of Bush announcing the Powell peace mission.</TE>
<TE>   But if opinions vary widely about Israel's military response to
terror, other worries seem widely shared. American Jews of all political
persuasions seem particularly enraged by the anti-Semitism they are
seeing in Europe, where synagogues in France have been bombed and
European leaders are talking about levying sanctions against Israel for
its incursion into the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   "I am angry and shocked that 60 years after the Holocaust you see
anti-Semitism rising on the part of so many in the European community,"
said Rosen, of the American Jewish Congress. "There is a lack of
political backbone. It was months before [French President Jacques]
Chirac stood up and said something."</TE>
<TE>   As for the United Nations, Hertzberg recalls that Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, who chastised Israel this week, had to apologize belatedly
for not marshaling the international community to save Rwandans who were
being massacred by Tutsis during the 1990s. "I do not want him or his
successor, after Israel is the first Western country to be blown up with
a couple of satchels of nuclear bombs, to say, 'So sorry,' " Hertzberg
said.</TE>
<TE>   And, suspicious that Palestinians do not really want to share land
with Israel but are out to extinguish the Jewish state, many American
Jews agree that if Sharon is not the solution, Arafat is definitely the
problem.</TE>
<TE>   "People haven't really switched on Sharon; it's just that they're
disgusted with Arafat," said M.J. Rosenberg, who runs the Washington
office of the Israel Policy Forum.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Geller, chief rabbi of Temple Emanuel in Beverly Hills, said
Israel's future security requires "a negotiated settlement that can lead
to a two-state solution." She is now convinced that Arafat can no longer
deliver that.</TE>
<TE>   There is also concern among American Jews that Arafat and the
Palestinians are winning the public relations wars, with images widely
circulated of Palestinians uprooted from their homes in the West Bank,
without food and water, humiliated by Israeli dominance.</TE>
<TE>   Mainstream and conservative Jewish leaders are planning a massive
rally in Washington on Monday to underscore that Israel's fight against
suicide bombers is part of America's fight against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But rally planners are already at odds about whether the event should,
as the right prefers, endorse Sharon's policies and criticize Bush for
pressuring Israel, or, as the left wants, support the Israeli people at a
time of crisis and the White House for attempting to mediate a solution.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very confused picture," said Stanley Sheinbaum, the Los
Angeles publisher and philanthropist who led a group of American Jews to
meet with Arafat in 1988. "American Jews, who are generally quite
liberal, have been reluctant to get too critical of Bush, but that was
when he was being totally supportive of Sharon. Now that he's backed off
. . . he's getting a lot of flak from the Jewish community."</TE>
<TE>   Giving heat to American presidents is just fine with Rabbi Hertzberg,
who recalls lecturing President Nixon in 1973, urging him to do more to
rescue Jews who were trying to flee the Soviet Union. When Nixon's face
darkened, Hertzberg apologized for the rough treatment, reminding him
that earlier generations of American Jewish leaders had failed to "talk
tough enough" to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt when Jews were
trying to escape the Holocaust in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "We dare not repeat that mistake," he told Nixon.</TE>

<HD>Saudi Telethon Raises Millions for Palestinians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia
</DL>
<LD>A princess donated her Rolls-Royce, one woman gave up her dowry and
other Saudis poured millions of dollars into a fund to help families of
Palestinian "martyrs" in a nationwide telethon Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Wheelchair-bound children braved unseasonable rain in Riyadh, the
capital, to drop cash into plastic boxes outside the state-run television
station, which, along with the radio, was organizing the drive. Long
lines of cars jammed the area, with drivers giving cash, gold jewelry and
clothes to volunteers with collection bags.</LD>
<LD>   In the first five hours of the 11-hour fund-raising campaign, $11.9
million had been donated.</LD>
<TE>   "We love you," said Sheik Saleh bin Hussein Ayed, a member of the
Islamic Affairs Ministry, addressing the Palestinians during the
telethon. "We cannot forget you or ignore what's happening to you by the
[Israeli] aggressors."</TE>
<TE>   The event, ordered by King Fahd and broadcast live by local and
Saudi-owned satellite channels, aims to help relatives of "martyrs," a
term that has been used by the Palestinians to refer to anyone killed by
Israelis or in operations against Israel--including suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi Embassy in Washington said the term as used in fund-raising
drives referred not to suicide bombers but to "Palestinians who are
victimized by Israeli terror and violence."</TE>
<TE>   It said any suggestion that Saudis are giving money to suicide bombers
is "baseless and false" and "an attempt to deflect from Israel's terror
practices in the occupied territories."</TE>
<TE>   Saudi assistance "includes financial assistance to the families of
victims--'martyrs'--distributed through the private humanitarian
organization chaired by Interior Minister Prince Nayif [ibn Abdulaziz],"
it said.</TE>

<HD>Syria Seeks an Advantage as Conflict Boils Next Door</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Syria aims to assert itself as a regional powerhouse, and
it may not regard any Israeli-Palestinian peace as a good thing, many
say.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO
</DL>
<LD>Thousands of protesters marched recently through the streets of
Damascus, the Syrian capital, chanting slogans and throwing stones. Not
surprisingly, they marched on the U.S. Embassy. And they chanted slogans
at the British compound.</LD>
<LD>   But then they also stoned the Egyptian Embassy.</LD>
<LD>   There has been nervous talk about a second front in Israel's conflict
with the Palestinians opening on its border with Lebanon, but in
political terms, that front is already active.</LD>
<TE>   Syria has been waging a campaign to assert itself as a regional
powerhouse, with the sometime aid of its junior partner, Lebanon, that
has infuriated many of its Arab neighbors, undermined many of the efforts
of the Palestinian Authority and raised the prospect of a broader
military conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Syria's recent actions--which its officials insist are motivated by
their unwavering support for the Palestinian cause--have served to
highlight a troublesome regional reality, one certain to complicate
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's Middle East peace mission: With so
many conflicting agendas on the right and left, there is always at least
one party that sees its interest in maintaining instability.</TE>
<TE>   "The Syrians are champions of the status quo, and the status quo has
been moving over the past few weeks and months," said Simon Karam, a
former Lebanese ambassador to the United States. "This is wreaking
massive political losses on Syria, and they are reacting."</TE>
<TE>   A widely held belief in this region says there can never be a
full-scale war without Egypt, and there cannot be full peace without
Syria. Egypt says that unless its land is attacked, it will not wage war.
But Syria has indicated that until its priorities--for example, the
return of the Golan Heights--are addressed, there will be no peace.</TE>
<TE>   Many believe that Syria will do all it can to prevent Palestinian
questions from being resolved unless its issues are addressed first, or
at least simultaneously. But in the current environment, the Palestinian
crisis has taken precedence.</TE>
<TE>   The recent tensions between Cairo and Damascus stem from this regional
competition, with each government trying to satisfy seething public
contempt for Israel--and frustration with Arab inaction--by demonstrating
support for the Palestinians. Damascus chided Cairo for not cutting all
ties with the Jewish state. Egypt responded by criticizing Syria for
pushing others into armed conflict while it has done nothing to fight for
return of the Golan, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle
East War.</TE>
<TE>Regional Influence at Stake for Syria</TE>
<TE>   Syria has a lot at stake. In addition to the return of the Golan, it
doesn't want to give up its political and economic control over Lebanon.
Syria's economy is moribund, at best, and it uses its neighbor to the
southwest as a safety valve, sending thousands of its citizens to work
there. A regional peace initiative would undoubtedly call on it to remove
its 30,000 troops from Lebanon, and with that at least some of its
hegemony over the smaller state.</TE>
<TE>   "The Syrians would like to delay any resolution made by the
Palestinians as long as they haven't achieved their goals," said one Arab
official with close ties to the Palestinian leadership. Like other
officials, he spoke on the condition he not be identified for fear of
inflaming tensions.</TE>
<TE>   "The Syrians wouldn't like the Palestinians to go ahead because that
would mean a lesser deal for them." Syria, he said, "got the Palestinians
to fight, and then gets the Lebanese to fight, while keeping its borders
with Israel immaculately proper without one incursion since 1967."</TE>
<TE>   At the recent Arab League summit in Beirut, Syrian President Bashar
Assad said there was nothing self-serving about his country's priorities,
or actions.</TE>
<TE>   After lamenting "Arab impotence" in the face of Israeli aggression, he
said, "Our national pillars are a complete [Israeli] withdrawal to 1967
borders, a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and the
right of return [for Palestinian refugees]."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever its motivation, Syria has succeeded in forcing itself into
the regional dialogue--at times alienating and angering other groups
purportedly working for the same Palestinian cause.</TE>
<TE>   When the U.N. Security Council recently voted to ask Israel to end its
military operation in the West Bank and withdraw, Syria abstained,
insisting that the resolution wasn't strong enough. But the resolution
was supported by the Palestinian Authority, and other Arab states, and
Syria was criticized for grandstanding instead of supporting regional
interests.</TE>
<TE>   At the Beirut summit, Lebanese President Emile Lahoud, who has his job
because of support from Damascus, prohibited Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat from speaking via a live satellite hookup to the
event. Lahoud's action, which many blamed on Syrian complicity,
infuriated the Palestinian delegation, which walked out for the day.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as the Israeli military campaign spread throughout the West
Bank, and Arafat was held under siege in Ramallah, the Palestinian
Authority formally asked the Arab League to hold an emergency meeting in
Cairo. As host of the annual summit, Lebanon's permission was
required--but it denied the request.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Palestinian Authority had to scour the league's bylaws to
find another way to hold the meeting. When it succeeded, Lebanon and
Syria refused to send their foreign ministers, undermining efforts of the
other ministers who attended, officials said.</TE>
<TE>Syria's Hand Seen in Hezbollah Attacks</TE>
<TE>   The most volatile--and risky--effort backed by Syria is occurring on
the border between Lebanon and Israel. For the first time since Israeli
troops withdrew from southern Lebanon nearly two years ago,
Lebanese-based militants are firing rockets into Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The group responsible, Hezbollah, is a Shiite militia backed by Syria
and Iran. Since the Israeli invasion of the West Bank, Hezbollah has
stepped up its cross-border attacks in a disputed frontier area called
Shabaa Farms. Although the United Nations certifies that Israel fully
withdrew from Lebanon, Hezbollah insists that Shabaa Farms is Lebanese
land and therefore justifies continued military resistance.</TE>
<TE>   But Hezbollah would never wage such high-profile attacks without
express authorization from Damascus, observers say. If the goal was to be
taken seriously or, more to the point, to get attention, it has
succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Dick Cheney phoned Assad on Monday and asked him to
curb Hezbollah. Two days later, four rockets landed at Beit Hillel, near
Kiryat Shemona, an Israeli town just over the border. No one acknowledged
firing the volley. But later, in an attack vaunted by Hezbollah, a
blizzard of 400 mortar shells fell on an Israeli outpost in the Shabaa
enclave.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli warplanes have responded to the attacks by bombing suspected
Hezbollah positions inside Lebanon, and Israeli officials warned against
a broadened military conflict.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time Syria's proxy army was fighting, Damascus withdrew
its soldiers to a safe distance from the border, apparently seeking to
avoid a direct conflict. Then, after its morning attacks, Hezbollah
extended an olive branch of sorts late Wednesday, offering to free an
Israeli colonel it was holding hostage if Israel stopped its offensive in
the Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank city of Jenin.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a de-escalation as compared to the outburst of activity in
the morning," Karam said. "Hezbollah fired in the morning and offered
some carrots in the evening."</TE>

<LD>In a joint operation with Afghan police, peacekeepers seized a
cache of 151 Chinese-made rockets, the same kind fired at the
international security force over the weekend, a peacekeeping spokesman
said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In another sweep, also on Wednesday, police killed one man and
arrested two others while seizing a large number of weapons, including
two American-made Stinger antiaircraft missiles, the government's Bakhtar
news agency said.</LD>
<LD>   The Chinese-made 107-millimeter rockets were found Wednesday on a road
between Kabul and Bagram, where U.S. and British troops are based, Flight
Lt. Joel Fall said.</LD>
<TE>   Two missiles of the same type were fired Sunday on a Kabul compound
housing peacekeepers. There were no casualties.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the United Nations said Thursday that a team sent to
investigate mass graves in the central Afghan town of Bamian found
several burial sites and saw four bodies.</TE>

<HD>Police Held in Sting Suspected of Ties to Tijuana Drug Cartel</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>The 41 Baja California policemen, including the Tijuana police
chief, who were arrested in an elaborate sting operation and flown to the
capital are all suspected of involvement in the Arellano Felix drug
cartel, Mexican authorities said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The suspects were lured to the Tecate police academy Wednesday under
the pretense of a firearms check. After all had turned over their
weapons, Mexican army units and federal officers swooped in and made the
arrests from about 200 officers present. There was no resistance.</LD>
<LD>   Among those arrested was Tijuana Police Chief Carlos Otal Namur and
one of his deputies, Jesus Jacobo Aguirre. An assistant state prosecutor,
Rogelio Delgado Neri, was also held.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for Tijuana Mayor Jesus Gonzalez Reyes said Francisco
Arellano Ortiz has been named the city's acting police chief.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor's position is that he recognizes that the purpose of the
raid, to clean up the police force, should be welcomed," said spokesman
Alfredo Ortiz. "We are still waiting to hear from the attorney general
what the legal status is of those who have been detained."</TE>
<TE>   The sweep is part of an ongoing crackdown on drug trafficking that in
recent weeks has resulted in several arrests, including Benjamin Arellano
Felix, chief of the so-called Tijuana cartel.</TE>
<TE>   Army units and federal investigators sealed off several blocks in the
La Mesa district of Tijuana on Thursday and conducted searches of some
houses.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Atty. Gen. Jorge Campos Murillo said at a news conference in
Mexico City that each of the 41 detainees was under investigation for
drug trafficking and organized crime connected to the Arellano Felix mob.
Asked what functions they served, Campos said only that they provided
information. So far, none of them has been charged.</TE>
<TE>   The sting in Tecate, about 30 miles east of Tijuana, was devised to
avoid an armed confrontation, Campos said. In addition to the 21
municipal police officers and the prosecutor taken into custody, agents
arrested 20 state police officers.</TE>
<TE>   "These people always go in armed groups. So we decided that this was a
way to avoid resistance and gunfire," Campos said. "It turned out to be a
completely clean operation."</TE>
<TE>   Otal Namur is the second police chief of a major Baja city to be
arrested recently. Mexicali's top policeman, Antonio Carmona Anorve, was
arrested in September for alleged links to the Arellano Felix cartel.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. law enforcement officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
applauded the operation as further evidence of Mexico's determination to
cripple the nation's top drug cartels. They said they had no advance
knowledge of the sting.</TE>

company's hub, warning that adopting the calf could lead to its death.</LD>
<LD>   Some workers had taken to feeding and petting the animal, biologist

Sinnott said, the greater risk is in feeding the animal. "If it gets

</DL>
<LD>Rep. James A. Traficant Jr. (D-Ohio) was convicted Thursday of
taking kickbacks from his staff and accepting bribes in exchange for
political favors, bringing to a close a contentious 2 1/2-month trial
marked by outbursts from the defendant as he argued his own case.</LD>
<LD>   The nine-term congressman, who does not have a law degree, stood alone
and uncharacteristically quiet at the defense table as U.S. District
Judge Lesley Wells read the verdict.</LD>
<LD>   "Guilty," she said after each of the 10 counts. Traficant shook his
head or muttered "No" as she asked each time if he wanted the jury
polled.</LD>
<TE>   He faces up to 63 years in prison and more than $2 million in fines
when he is sentenced June 27, but likely will receive a far shorter
prison term under federal sentencing guidelines. The jury also ordered
Traficant to forfeit $96,000 in gains he received from racketeering, less
than the $159,000 judgment asked for by prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   The sequestered jurors had deliberated since Monday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>Defiant Lawmaker Says He Won't Resign</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.)
called for Traficant's immediate resignation. "At the heart of all public
service is personal integrity," Gephardt said. "A member of Congress who
breaks the law betrays the public trust and brings discredit to the House
of Representatives."</TE>
<TE>   Traficant, who was released on bond pending his sentencing, was
subdued but defiant afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not resign and I will appeal," he said. "But I do not have
that good of a chance on appeal. I'm not well-liked by judges."</TE>
<TE>   If Traficant, who is midway through his term, does not resign, he
could be expelled by a two-thirds vote of the House. The last congressman
expelled was Rep. Michael Myers (D-Pa.) in 1980 after his conviction for
taking a bribe from FBI agents disguised as Arab sheiks.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant's conviction on charges of bribery, racketeering, witness
coercion and filing false tax returns comes just short of 19 years after
he won an acquittal on federal charges he had taken money from the Mafia.</TE>
<TE>   It was on the steps of this same stately granite courthouse in 1983
that Traficant, then the elected sheriff from his native Mahoning County,
clutched the jury foreman in a joyful embrace. He had successfully argued
that he was caught on tape receiving $163,000 from organized crime only
because he was conducting his own sting. He was later forced to pay
income tax on the funds after he failed to produce the cash.</TE>
<TE>   From this trial's opening, Traficant closely mimicked his previous
effort. But his attempt to cast himself as the little guy fighting a
too-powerful government failed to convince this time around.</TE>
<TE>   He complained that none of his constituents were on the jury, arguing
that people from the Mahoning Valley would understand him. His first jury
included six members from the valley, but they are now excluded from
juries serving in Cleveland because of the 90-minute commute.</TE>
<TE>Parade of Witnesses Dealt Severe Blows</TE>
<TE>   Known for his bluster on Capitol Hill, Traficant approached the trial
as though it were a sandbox scuffle, predicting it would be a
"donnybrook." At one point late last week, he stood so close to the lead
prosecutor--arms behind his back, his trademark hair giving him the look
of a rooster--that Wells had to ask him to back off.</TE>
<TE>   He shouted accusations at Wells and mocked the opposition, then
apologized, saying they had forced him to act that way.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors listened as prosecutors presented a case that included
incriminating testimony from 55 of Traficant's employees, friends and
business associates.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations included that Traficant did political favors in
exchange for free labor and supplies for his boat and farm, that he tried
to influence the testimony of one of his congressional aides and that he
asked his lawyer to burn the envelopes used to deliver his cash
kickbacks.</TE>
<TE>   The jury also heard extensive testimony that Traficant made
congressional staffers on government time shovel manure and bale hay on
his farm.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant, who earns $150,000 a year, more than four times the average
of his blue-collar constituents, still cut an oddly sympathetic figure in
court.</TE>
<TE>   He sat alone at the defense table, carried a single cardboard box of
evidence into court every day and at times pulled documents from a
plastic convenience store bag.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just the son of a truck driver," Traficant said often, reminding
the judge and jury that if he made any mistakes it was because he was not
a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Though Wells ruled he could not argue the government had been out to
get him for years, his so-called "vendetta defense," Traficant managed
throughout the trial to hint at his theory.</TE>
<TE>   He told the jury the Internal Revenue Service hated him because he has
proposed ending the federal income tax. He warned them of the power of
the FBI to "scare you, scare your wife, scare your family."</TE>
<TE>   Traficant told the jurors Thursday, "I accept the verdict" and then
complained about the trial.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite frankly it was a very unfair process," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He then gestured to law enforcement officials seated at the
prosecution table.</TE>
<TE>   "Not one of them offered testimony," he said, "because they were
scared to death of my cross-examination."</TE>
<TE>   Wells stopped Traficant from questioning jurors after he asked to
speak to the 10 women and two men about their decision, telling him the
jury had no responsibility to respond to his queries.</TE>
<TE>   She dismissed them, thanking them for doing "an excellent job."</TE>
<TE>   As jurors filed back into the room where they deliberated, some burst
into sobs that could be heard through the closed door.</TE>

<HD>Unlikely Allies in Nuclear Waste War</HD>
<DH>Debate: Party labels vanish in Nevada dump confrontation. Ferraro,
Sununu face off against Podesta, Duberstein.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Night after night for two years on CNN's "Crossfire," Geraldine A.
Ferraro and John H. Sununu practically came to blows as they argued the
opposite side of almost every issue imaginable.</LD>
<LD>   Now these real-life and television adversaries have found an issue
they agree on. Sununu, a conservative Republican and former chief of
staff to the first President Bush, persuaded Ferraro, a liberal Democrat
and former vice presidential candidate from New York, to join him in
lobbying for Nevada's Yucca Mountain as a permanent burial ground for
tens of thousands of tons of spent nuclear waste.</LD>
<LD>   Not to be outdone, the state of Nevada hired a high-powered odd couple
of its own to lobby on the immensely consequential issue, which faces
votes in the House and Senate this summer. Two other former presidential
chiefs of staff, John Podesta (Bill Clinton) and Kenneth M. Duberstein
(Ronald Reagan), are working to sway members of Congress to vote against
putting a nuclear depository 90 miles from Las Vegas.</LD>
<TE>   The unconventional pairing of political superstars has inevitably been
the source of a few jokes in Washington. "I think Gerry Ferraro has the
worst of it," Podesta said in commenting on their Republican partners.</TE>
<TE>   The strange bedfellows also demonstrate that on the many issues that
are not particularly partisan--like Yucca Mountain--both sides find it
essential to recruit lobbyists with strong ties to both parties.</TE>
<TE>   Unexpected alliances are sometimes forged in Washington, despite a
pervasive us-versus-them mentality in which party allegiances seem to be
branded on everyone's forehead.</TE>
<TE>   In February, President Bush formally approved Yucca as the nation's
repository for nuclear waste. On Monday, Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn vetoed
the decision. That left the final determination in Congress' hands.</TE>
<TE>   It requires a simple majority in both houses to override Guinn's veto
and keep the project moving forward. Only if Guinn can win a majority in
at least one house can he kill the project. And with Nevada being one
state against 49, that's a tall order.</TE>
<TE>   To marshal a majority of the 100-member Senate, for example, Nevada
faces the daunting challenge of persuading 49 senators from other states
to vote against the Yucca site. For 15 years, Yucca has been the only
site under consideration, which has given the project an air of a fait
accompli. So it was clear to Nevada that it had to pursue every vote.</TE>
<TE>   The calculation was different for Yucca's advocates. The U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, which hired Sununu, believed that the importance of the
issue dictated that a consensus of both chambers approve Yucca, and not
just a Republican-weighted majority.</TE>
<TE>   Sununu was the one who came up with the idea of approaching his former
counterpart on "Crossfire." Despite their clashing views, Ferraro and
Sununu are not nearly as antagonistic as they appeared on the screen.</TE>
<TE>   "That's show biz," Sununu said.</TE>
<TE>   As a lobbyist for the Yucca site, Sununu first had to persuade Ferraro
that his side was right.</TE>
<TE>   Her initial reaction, Ferraro said, was that if the nuclear industry
was for it, she must be against it. But then Sununu asked her to focus on
the narrow issue of whether the nation would be better off consolidating
all its nuclear waste at one storage site rather than keeping it at 130
nuclear power plants and research facilities across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Ferraro was still not convinced, but the two went to Yucca Mountain
together in mid-February and, after she grilled the geologists and other
scientists there, Ferraro made up her mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not lobby for anything I don't believe in," Ferraro said. "I
believe this is the safest thing to do with the wastes, especially in
light of [potential] terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I was spending Valentine's Day with John Sununu," she pointed out.
"It was hysterical."</TE>
<TE>   But she admitted that it seemed strange to be on the same side of an
issue as Sununu. She could not recall one issue on which they agreed
during their years on CNN. "If this were not a very specific issue, I
would probably not be working with John Sununu," Ferraro said. "We're
usually on opposite ends."</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the Yucca issue, Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has led
his state's fight against the site. He asked Podesta to help him because
the two worked together in 2000 to prevent nuclear waste from being
stored there temporarily. At that time, Podesta was White House chief of
staff, and Reid was impressed with Podesta's knowledge of the issue and
his ability to organize a successful campaign, according to Reid's
spokesman Nathan Naylor.</TE>
<TE>   Duberstein, a longtime lobbyist on gambling issues that are important
to Nevada, was brought on board because of his contacts with Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Podesta, a law professor at Georgetown University, said it has been
very easy for him to work with Duberstein despite their different party
affiliations. "I've known him and respected him for a long time," Podesta
said.</TE>
<TE>   Reid and Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.), who are allies in their effort to
defeat the project, are setting the tone for Duberstein and Podesta,
Podesta said.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge, he said, is persuading members of Congress who think
the decision has already been made to take a fresh look at the risks of
Yucca Mountain, particularly the danger of transporting the waste through
the country.</TE>
<TE>   It won't be easy, Podesta said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a case where there is a lot of money and a lot of special
interests on the other side," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Ferraro and Sununu both said that they too had developed a great deal
of respect and even affection for each other through their verbal
jousting.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an easy step for us," Sununu said. "Most old politicians have
a kinship. People who have been through the political caldron have
respect for others who have been through the political caldron."</TE>

<HD>With an Eye on '04 Campaigns, Democrats Converge on Florida</HD>
<DH>Politics: As Gore returns to the spotlight, many in the party are
displaying a distinct lack of enthusiasm over the prospect he'll run
again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Returning to the center of the storm, former Vice President Al Gore
will address a convention of Florida Democrats on Saturday in his most
visible political appearance since he conceded the state--and the
presidency--to George W. Bush in December 2000.</LD>
<LD>   For Gore, the event is not only a homecoming but a test of strength:
He will share a stage with several other Democrats exploring bids for the
party's 2004 presidential nomination. And the convention comes at a time
when many Democratic insiders are displaying a distinct lack of
enthusiasm about the prospect of another presidential race by Gore, who
virtually disappeared from view last year.</LD>
<LD>   Even among the rank and file, Gore's image appears to have suffered: a
CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released Thursday found that a plurality of
Democrats say they prefer he not run again.</LD>
<TE>   "He needs once again to establish himself and essentially become
relevant for the era today," veteran Democratic pollster Peter Hart said.
"The party regulars are anxious to move forward and he has to prove he is
not the candidate of yesterday."</TE>
<TE>   Against that backdrop, the weekend's Democratic gathering in Orlando
is looming as a surprisingly important early test for Gore. Reflecting
that, some of his aides are promising his most "publicly partisan" speech
since the 2000 campaign.</TE>
<TE>Expectations Are for a Strong Showing</TE>
<TE>   Gore's supporters are expecting an enthusiastic reception from Florida
Democrats still convinced he was cheated in the state's disputed recount;
state party officials essentially have built time into the schedule for a
floor demonstration of support.</TE>
<TE>   But his rivals, playing the political expectation game, say anything
less than a rapturous response likely would raise questions about the
depth of grass-roots enthusiasm for another Gore presidential bid.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one state where it is set up for Gore not to do badly," said
a top advisor to another Democratic hopeful appearing over the weekend.
"If he doesn't hit a home run, it's another piece of that story of
doubt."</TE>
<TE>   The event, at a resort near Walt Disney World, will mark another
escalation in political skirmishing that still is largely invisible to
the public, but already is bubbling with activity. Also appearing will be
three Democratic senators who have been exploring a race for the White
House--John Edwards of North Carolina, John F. Kerry of Massachusetts and
Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut. Joining them will be Connecticut's
other senator, Christopher J. Dodd, who hasn't done any preparatory
campaign work but hasn't closed the door on a candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   Other Democrats considered to be potential presidential candidates
include House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, Vermont
Gov. Howard Dean and Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   In these early turns around the track, the rabbits have been Edwards
and Kerry. Edwards, an articulate former trial lawyer elected in 1998,
has been perhaps the most unabashedly active of all--he already has
appeared at eight state party dinners, more than any of the other
potential 2004 aspirants, according to the Hotline, an electronic
political newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   And his political action committee has found a unique variant on the
perennial strategy of courting Iowa and New Hampshire, which hold the
first two nominating contests: The PAC loaned dozens of computers to
party officials in each state.</TE>
<TE>   "The more people see Edwards, the more impressed they get," said
Hollywood Democratic activist Lynne Wasserman, who recently sponsored a
fund-raiser for the senator.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards has acquired enough of a buzz that he's already sparked a
backlash from skeptics who say his speeches are heavier on style than on
content. "All of the focus among the 100 people in Washington who care
about this is: Isn't he new, isn't he different. But where's the beef?"
said a senior advisor to another potential candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry has been more visible in Washington, leading the
environmentalist fight on key issues in the Senate's debate on energy
legislation. Like Edwards, Kerry is systematically courting activists in
the key states; in Florida this weekend, his schedule is crowded with
meetings with labor leaders and party donors.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman, Gore's running mate in 2000, also is traveling steadily.
But Lieberman has not been able to organize as aggressively as Edwards or
Kerry because he repeatedly has declared that he will not run in 2004 if
Gore does.</TE>
<TE>   Gephardt hasn't as overtly been building a campaign. But his advisors
say he doesn't need to do as much spadework if he decides to run because
of his long-standing connections (including those forged in his
unsuccessful 1988 presidential bid) with party leaders in key states and
organized labor.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle has been something of an enigma: Despite polls showing him
provoking considerable interest among Democratic primary voters,
operatives for the other possible candidates say they see no sign of him
actively constructing a campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest question mark is Gore. He kept such a low profile in
2001 that he drew more attention for the beard he grew than for anything
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, he shaved his beard and edged back into the partisan arena.
He has formed a political action committee to help other Democrats and
held half a dozen fund-raisers to support it. He criticized President
Bush on several domestic issues in a speech to Tennessee Democrats, and
he mixed praise and criticism of the president in a talk to the Council
on Foreign Relations in New York.</TE>
<TE>Laying Groundwork for Another Bid</TE>
<TE>   Although some of Gore's top strategists have indicated they are
unlikely to enlist for another run, he has begun reestablishing ties with
key supporters and former campaign workers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he is close to making a decision for 2004," said Donna
Brazile, his campaign manager in 2000. "But you can tell that he is
trying to keep all his options open, and his cards close to the vest."</TE>
<TE>   Some Gore aides anticipate that, in Saturday's speech, he will make
his most systematic effort yet to define his differences with Bush. Among
the administration actions he is planning to attack: Bush's decision to
store nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   To many Gore supporters, this sharpening focus can't come too
soon--even ardent backers acknowledge he needs to reestablish himself as
a party leader.</TE>
<TE>   While he still leads comfortably in polls measuring early presidential
preferences among Democrats, the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll found that 48%
of the party's voters said they didn't want him to run again, up
dramatically from 31% in August.</TE>
<TE>   The best news for Gore may be that no one has used his absence to
emerge as the party's undisputed leader. If anything, some believe,
anxiety among grass-roots Democrats about the inability of the Washington
party leaders to develop a strong alternative to Bush may have created an
opening for Gore.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a frustration that no Democrat is speaking with a clear
voice," said Fort Lauderdale, Fla., attorney Mitchell Berger, a strong
Gore supporter.</TE>

<DL>ATLANTA
</DL>
<LD>Lottery players--some spending hundreds of dollars, others paying
with handfuls of change--lined up in seven states Thursday for a shot at
one of the biggest jackpots in U.S. history: a $220-million Big Game
prize.</LD>
<LD>   "It's like getting struck by lightning, but you've got to hope," said
Gabriel Darnell, who planned to buy five tickets at Sheridan Liquors in
Peoria, Ill., for today's drawing.</LD>
<LD>   The jackpot hit the $200-million mark after 17 straight drawings in
which no one hit the jackpot.</LD>
<TE>   The biggest lottery jackpot in U.S. history was a Big Game prize of
$363 million, won in May 2000 by ticket holders in Michigan and Illinois.
The multistate Powerball game has had two jackpots worth about $295
million.</TE>
<TE>   The Big Game is played in Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, New Jersey and Virginia. Players pick five numbers from 1 to 50
and one Big Money Ball number from 1 to 36. The odds of winning were put
at 1 in 76 million.</TE>

<HD>Justice Dept. Withholds Papers</HD>
<DH>Access: Ashcroft's gun sales proposal is the latest battleground
between Congress and the administration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration is once again squaring off against
congressional investigators over access to government records--this time
involving a controversial proposal that a new report says could make it
easier for criminals to illegally buy weapons.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft wants to begin having the FBI destroy records
of all gun sales within 24 hours of a purchase--a significant departure
from the current 90-day standard. But a preliminary review released
Thursday by the General Accounting Office suggests that the change would
allow hundreds of disqualified buyers, including felons and the mentally
ill, to bypass safeguards and illegally purchase guns each year.</LD>
<LD>   What the brief GAO report does not mention, however, is that senior
congressional investigators have been tussling with the Justice
Department behind the scenes for months in an effort to get far more
documentation about the issue. Investigators want to know how Ashcroft, a
staunch supporter of the 2nd Amendment, arrived at his proposal and who
weighed in. The Justice Department is refusing to turn over such
material.</LD>
<TE>   "Their response is, 'That's not appropriate for release.' They have
kept a close hold on anything they consider to be part of the
deliberative process. We don't particularly agree with that, but that's
where we stand," said Dan R. Burton, an assistant GAO director.</TE>
<TE>   After more than four months of delays, the Justice Department
ultimately gave investigators access to FBI officials to discuss the
impact of Ashcroft's proposal, GAO officials said. But FBI officials were
directed "not to talk about anything regarding the deliberative process,"
Burton said, and GAO officials say that many key questions remain
unanswered.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute has frustrated congressional investigators, and it mirrors
a pattern of standoffs between the Bush administration and Congress over
access to information.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, sued the White House in
February over its refusal to turn over documents concerning Vice
President Dick Cheney's energy plan. Separately, a group of House
Democrats is suing the Census Bureau for access to information on how it
arrived at adjusted 2000 census figures. And congressional leaders have
been irked by the refusal of Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge and
Medicare Director Thomas Scully to testify on Capitol Hill about key
administration policies.</TE>
<TE>   Open-government advocates said the escalating series of run-ins
signals the administration's insistence on keeping its business behind
closed doors and Congress' determination to get an inside look at how the
administration conducts its affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing a new closed society under the Bush administration,"
charged Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, a Washington-based
advocacy group that is representing the members of Congress suing for the
census data.</TE>
<TE>   "Congress has a right to be nosy, and they may be fighting a little
bit harder these days because the administration has shut them out," she
said. The White House "thinks these issues are none of the public's
business, and they forget that Congress has established again and again
that the public has a right to know what its government is doing."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials had no immediate comment on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   In July, Ashcroft announced his plan to maintain gun purchase records
for only a day, saying that keeping the records for months at a time
threatened to violate the buyers' right to privacy and was not the
intention of Congress when it set up the gun-check system.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the FBI began operating a massive nationwide data
clearinghouse that reviews millions of gun purchases a year. Most
transactions are cleared in a matter of seconds once it is determined
that the prospective buyer has no criminal record or other problem that
would ban a purchase. The system has blocked hundreds of thousands of
illegal sales.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft's proposal to destroy FBI records of the gun purchases within
24 hours has drawn rave reviews from the National Rifle Assn. But gun
control groups say it would decimate the background check system, and
they said Thursday's preliminary assessment from the GAO--requested by
Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.)--confirms their fears.</TE>
<TE>   Based on FBI data, GAO investigators found that between July and
October of last year, there were 100 cases in which authorities used data
that had been kept up to 90 days to go back to try to retrieve guns from
people who were not authorized to buy them. That would amount to about
300 unauthorized purchases over the course of a year.</TE>
<TE>   These illegal sales "never would have been identified under the
next-day destruction system," and authorities would not have been able to
go back to try to find the buyers, said Burton, of the GAO.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the unauthorized sales appear to have involved situations
where a buyer's conviction in a domestic assault--a banned category--was
not immediately apparent through the FBI check system, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Nosanchuk, legislative counsel for the Violence Policy Center
in Washington, said the GAO report is "proof positive from an independent
source of what we've been saying all along about the danger this would
cause. This isn't hypothetical; these are 100 felons who got guns and
wouldn't have been identified if the records were destroyed."</TE>
<TE>   The GAO expects to put out a full report on the gun issue in June, and
Burton said investigators expect to provide Congress with a substantial
understanding of the impact of Ashcroft's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   But he said senior officials have renewed their requests in just the
last several days for access to a much broader range of information.</TE>
<TE>   "We've asked for really any kind of relevant documentation that
[Justice Department officials] have regarding the reasoning behind their
proposal--the reasons for reducing it from 90 days to one day, the plans
for implementing the change, and what analysis has been done about the
potential effects," he said. "That's information we haven't gotten from
them so far."</TE>

<HD>Accusations Fly Over Arctic Refuge Video</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Adding fuel to the debate over proposed oil and gas exploration in
the Arctic refuge, a Democratic congressman Thursday accused Interior
Secretary Gale A. Norton of breaking the law by using an industry-backed
video to promote the drilling.</LD>
<LD>   An Interior Department spokesman said distribution of the video to
news outlets and its posting on the agency's Web site was approved by one
of the agency's senior attorneys.</LD>
<LD>   The video depicts a frozen, inhospitable tundra in the winter when,
proponents say, drilling would take place. It is designed to counter
pictures shown by environmentalists of a lush, green wilderness rich with
wildlife that they say would be endangered by energy exploration.</LD>
<TE>   Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) accused Norton of violating a ban on
spending government funds "for publicity or propaganda purposes, and for
the . . . distribution or use of any . . . film presentation designed to
support or defeat legislation pending before Congress. . . . "</TE>
<TE>   It appears that Norton's promotion of the video "to influence Congress
to drill in the Arctic [National Wildlife] Refuge is precisely the kind
of activity that is prohibited by law," Markey said in a letter to
Norton, urging her to "cease and desist."</TE>
<TE>   "The Interior Department shouldn't be spreading oil company propaganda
any more than the Department of Energy should be promoting Enron stock,"
Markey added in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Interior Department spokesman Mark Pfeifle defended Norton's actions,
saying: "ANWR videos: $95.81. Postage to send ANWR videos to network news
anchors: $43.55. Informing Americans what the real Alaska North Slope
looks like in the dead of winter: Priceless."</TE>
<TE>   The video was produced by Arctic Power, a lobby group working for the
drilling plan and which Pfeifle pointed out is partly funded by Alaska's
state government.</TE>
<TE>   "The distribution of a video about what Alaska's North Slope actually
looks like in the dead of winter was approved by one of the most senior
career attorneys in our solicitor's office," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The Markey letter was the latest salvo in an increasingly bitter fight
over drilling in the Arctic refuge. The Senate will soon consider
President Bush's call to open up the area to oil exploration as part of a
comprehensive energy policy.</TE>
<TE>   An energy bill passed by the GOP-controlled House last summer
authorizes the drilling. But a bid to include that provision in the bill
being debated by the Democratic-controlled Senate faces an uphill fight.</TE>
<TE>   GOP senators were working Thursday to try to drum up support for the
drilling from Democratic senators from industrial states by promising to
steer government royalties from the exploration to aid for the steel
industry. The funds would help pay for pension and health-care costs for
retired steelworkers.</TE>
<TE>   The Sierra Club assailed the effort as "raising cynicism and blackmail
to an art form."</TE>
<TE>   As the Senate continued debate Thursday on the energy bill, it dealt a
setback to California's efforts to gain more flexibility in complying
with a provision that would triple the amount of ethanol that must be
added to gasoline nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   California officials worry that the requirement will cause price
spikes and supply shortages. But a proposal by Sen. Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.) to require the Environmental Protection Agency to respond
within 30 days to a state's request for a waiver from the ethanol
requirement was tabled, largely on the votes of corn state lawmakers who
favor increased use of ethanol.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, the ethanol caucus prevailed" Thursday, Feinstein said. "I
don't intend to vote for the bill if the mandate remains in its current
form."</TE>

<HD>Court Faults FAA on Airport Near Zion Park</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Federal officials should have taken a closer look at the effect of
increased air traffic over Zion National Park before approving plans for
a new airport in St. George, Utah, appeals court judges said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Grand Canyon Trust environmental group had asked the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Washington circuit to force the Federal Aviation
Administration to perform an environmental impact study. The FAA had
previously decided the new airport would not affect the pristine nature
of Zion National Park.</LD>
<LD>   The three-judge panel did not rule on the trust's request Thursday,
but the judges had pointed criticism for the government's attorney, Ellen
Durkee.</LD>
<TE>   Durkee argued that an environmental impact statement is not necessary
because there would only be a 2% increase in the 240 to 300 daily flights
over the park if the new airport is approved. Such a small increase
couldn't possibly be the straw that breaks the camel's back, spoiling the
pristine nature of the park, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "But that's where you're wrong," Judge David S. Tatel interrupted.
"You don't know anything about the camel."</TE>
<TE>   Tatel said the FAA hadn't considered the cumulative impacts of adding
traffic to the existing flights. And the noise models used--while
relevant for New York City or Washington--don't apply to a park
environment.</TE>
<TE>   The Park Service had also urged the FAA to consider those factors,
noted Judge Harry T. Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   "There's another government agency standing there with you that says
you're completely wrong," Edwards told Durkee. The National Park Service
has identified Zion National Park as one of nine parks nationally where
restoring "natural quiet"--eliminating any human-caused noise--is an
immediate priority.</TE>

<HD>Litter Maker Sues Over Mine Claim</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RENO
</DL>
<LD>Raising the stakes in their claim to prime clay deposits, Oil-Dri
Corp. officials filed a federal lawsuit against Washoe County on Thursday
over their right to build a cat litter mine and processing plant.</LD>
<LD>   In a legal battle based on a 130-year-old law that both sides say
could prove precedent-setting, the largest maker of cat litter in the
world says the county had no authority to block the mining project on
federal land on the outskirts of Reno.</LD>
<LD>   "Denial of this special use permit is in direct violation of Oil-Dri's
rights under the 1872 Mining Law," Oil-Dri lawyer Stephen Mollath said
Thursday after the filing in U.S. District Court.</LD>
<TE>   County officials were confident they would prevail in court, and
environmentalists vowed to help.</TE>
<TE>   "When we win, it will be precedent-setting against the mining law,"
said Tom Myers, director of the Great Basin Mine Watch in Reno.</TE>
<TE>   "Our position is that the claim is not valid if they cannot get their
local permits, and they did not get their local permits, so the claim is
not valid," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Conservationists long have targeted the mining law for reform. They
say the law, intended to encourage Western expansion through mining for
gold and silver in the 19th century, is being abused to get at the clay
for premium cat litter.</TE>
<TE>   Washoe County last month rejected Oil-Dri's request for a special
permit for the mining and processing plant, citing concerns about noise,
air pollution and increased truck traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The project is proposed on 300 acres of Bureau of Land Management
lands bordering the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony 10 miles north of downtown.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the mining law, Oil-Dri said in the lawsuit that the
county's denial of the permit contradicts conditions set forth by the
Washoe County air quality permit, the Nevada state reclamation permit,
the Nevada state engineer and BLM's record of decision.</TE>

<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
</DL>
<LD>A man who is pleading insanity in the killings of seven co-workers
testified in the most matter-of-fact way Thursday that he thought he was
killing Adolf Hitler and his Nazi henchmen as part of a divine mission to
save the world from the Holocaust.</LD>
<LD>   Michael McDermott--a hulking, 43-year-old man with a bushy black beard
and long, shaggy hair--said that, 12 days before the shooting rampage at
Edgewater Technology in Wakefield in 2000, the archangel St. Michael
appeared and told him how to earn a ticket to heaven.</LD>
<LD>   "The whole idea was to prevent Nazi supremacy," the software engineer
said.</LD>
<TE>   "I felt great. For the first time in my life I felt I could achieve
what everyone takes for granted--that I could have a soul and go to
heaven."</TE>
<TE>   He also told the jury that he had once attempted suicide, that he had
been raped as a boy, and that he heard voices in his head.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say McDermott planned the slayings in retaliation for the
company's plan to withhold some of his wages to pay $5,600 in back taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Tom O'Reilly asked McDermott if his two decades of
experience with the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons made
him a skilled storyteller who could concoct tales.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not so much concocting as having fun, participating in a group
fantasy," McDermott replied.</TE>
<TE>   McDermott calmly described how he walked through his office, firing
his AK-47 rifle and a shotgun. He said he had been transported in time to
Hitler's Berlin bunker in 1940, and saw Nazis, not colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   "There were two men and a woman in front of me. Both of the men had
swastika armbands. I immediately shot both of the men," McDermott said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he shot three more "Nazis" when he heard "Hitler's thoughts"
coming from the accounting office.</TE>
<TE>   "The last Nazi was there. I shot and killed him. And Hitler was there.
I shot and killed him," McDermott said. "My mission was complete. I knew
at this point I had a soul."</TE>
<TE>   He then returned to the office reception area, where he was arrested.
He told the jury that he died at a Berlin police station from a
combination of painkillers and vodka he downed before the shootings.</TE>
<TE>   The testimony came before a courtroom packed with relatives of the
victims.</TE>
<TE>   McDermott acknowledged under questioning that he had bought a book,
"Clinical Assessment of Malingering and Deception," which helps detect
when someone is faking mental illness, and had downloaded Internet
material about faking psychological disorders.</TE>

<HD>Bill to Switch to Lethal Injection for Executions OKd in Alabama</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONTGOMERY, Ala.
</DL>
<LD>The Alabama Legislature passed a measure Thursday to change the
primary method of execution in the state from the electric chair to
lethal injection.</LD>
<LD>   If the bill is signed by Gov. Donald Siegelman, Nebraska would be the
only state that still uses the electric chair as the primary method of
execution.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation calls for lethal injection to be used unless the
inmate asks to die in the electric chair.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy press secretary Rip Andrews said the governor wants to study
the bill, but he has said he favors the change. Siegelman and state Atty.
Gen. Bill Pryor had urged the Legislature to change the method of
execution because of concern the U.S. Supreme Court could declare the
electric chair to be cruel and unusual punishment.</TE>
<TE>   "This legislation will remove one of the many filings that clog the
courts to delay justice," Pryor said.</TE>
<TE>   The lethal injection bill passed the state Senate earlier in the
session and was approved by the House on a 86-0 vote Thursday.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Grand Jury to Focus on Priest Sex Abuse Cases</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Expressing concern about a possible cover-up by Long Island's Roman
Catholic diocese, a district attorney said Thursday he was convening a
special grand jury to investigate allegations of sexual abuse by priests
and how the allegations were handled by the church.</LD>
<LD>   "From what we have received by way of information so far, it does
appear that there has been a cover-up," Suffolk County Dist. Atty. Thomas
Spota said.</LD>
<LD>   "The grand jury is being formed because of the serious allegations of
sexual misconduct by accused priests," Spota said. "The time has come to
investigate not only that matter, but what the Diocese of Rockville
Centre has done."</LD>
<TE>   Under New York law, grand juries can subpoena evidence and witnesses,
issue indictments or find that subjects did not break the law.</TE>
<TE>   In a related development, the Diocese of Brooklyn said it would give
the district attorneys of Brooklyn and Queens today the names of local
priests accused of sexual misconduct with minors over the last 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   The number of priests to be named is not known because files are still
being examined, Frank DeRosa, a spokesman for Bishop Thomas Daily, said
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The Long Island grand jury, scheduled to be convened within weeks, is
considered a bold step in the growing examination of the church's
handling of allegations of sexual abuse of minors at the hands of
priests. Legal experts say it would be the first special grand jury
convened solely for the purpose of conducting a broad examination of
sexual abuse allegations against clergy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time I'm aware of in the country that a prosecutor
has had the moral courage to investigate," said Michael Dowd, a New York
attorney who has represented several sexual abuse victims. "This is a
grand jury that is hopefully looking, if it's justified, to indicting
higher-ups or the diocese itself as an institution."</TE>
<TE>   The Diocese of Rockville Centre serves 1.5 million Catholics in Nassau
and Suffolk counties.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop William Murphy turned over information on abuse cases to the
counties' district attorneys last month.</TE>

<HD>Priest Was Welcomed Despite 'Moral Problem'</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Diocese of Orange accepted him in 1976 after report of
misconduct; he was fired in 1985 following more allegations of abuse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange this week admitted it welcomed
a Milwaukee priest into its ranks despite a warning from his superior
that he had a "moral problem having to do with a boy in school."</LD>
<LD>   Father Sigfried Widera was accepted into the Diocese of Orange in 1976
though he was undergoing counseling for still-unspecified priestly
misconduct. In 1985, other allegations of sexual misconduct with children
surfaced, and Widera was fired.</LD>
<LD>   Church officials said they don't know when, if ever, the 1985
accusations were settled.</LD>
<TE>   The allegation emerged Saturday when a 32-year-old man filed a report
with the Anaheim Police Department saying he was sexually abused by
Widera after the priest arrived in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Widera nor the alleged victim could be reached for comment
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Diocese of Orange Bishop Tod D. Brown said in a written statement that
Widera would not have been accepted if current standards had been
applied. "While the acceptance of a priest undergoing treatment was
considered acceptable then, it is not today, and I regret any pain that
may have been caused by accepting Father Widera in 1976."</TE>
<TE>   Diocesan officials said that when Widera was transferred, the
archbishop of Milwaukee, William Cousins, told colleague William Johnson,
then the bishop of Orange, that the priest posed "no great risk" to
children despite his past problem. Johnson and Cousins are deceased.</TE>
<TE>   When new accusations surfaced in 1985, Johnson stripped Widera of his
duties, effectively ending his career as a priest.</TE>
<TE>   Widera also was sent to a treatment program in New Mexico, church
officials said.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Education Department officials watching for workers' personal
purchases on government credit cards overlooked nearly $66,000 worth of
goods bought last summer that were not properly accounted for,
congressional auditors say.</LD>
<LD>   A new system that has curbed persistent problems with purchase cards
and other programs is keeping fraud under control but could be better
implemented, according to a General Accounting Office report released
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "While it's much better than it was, it's still not quite functioning
properly," said Linda Calbom, GAO's director of financial management and
assurance.</LD>
<TE>   After learning of financial problems during the last three years of
the Clinton administration, Education Secretary Rod Paige put new
controls in place.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said the "positive steps"--including requiring
supervisors to sign off on each purchase--have not been effectively
implemented in many cases.</TE>
<TE>   An agency review last year of purchase card statements found that 20
of 86 statements sampled from July through September did not specify what
was purchased.</TE>
<TE>   In those three months, workers charged nearly $1.9 million on
department credit cards. GAO investigators found $23,151 in purchases
that had no description of what was bought. They estimated that the
amount could be as much as $65,817.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Hansen, the Education Department's deputy secretary, said the
department is training supervisors to look more closely at purchases and
is holding them accountable through regular reviews.</TE>
<TE>   The department is one of several overhauling its credit card system.</TE>
<TE>   The Interior Department is changing its policies and retraining
personnel after an audit found that employees used the cards to pay rent,
withdraw money at casinos and buy jewelry and furniture.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have also found that more than 46,000 Defense Department
employees defaulted on $62 million in credit card travel expenses through
November.</TE>

<HD>Airbus Grounding Called Unwarranted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The head of the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday
there is no reason to stop flying the Airbus A300-600, one of which
crashed in New York last year.</LD>
<LD>   Marion Blakey said she disagreed with a group of eight American
Airlines pilots who wrote her last month urging that the government
consider grounding the plane.</LD>
<LD>   "We have not seen anything to this point that indicates that kind of
radical action is warranted," Blakey told a House transportation panel.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the pilots' concerns are serious enough that "the urgency is
probably accelerated to get a verdict on this plane," said John Clark,
the safety board's aviation safety director.</TE>
<TE>   Board investigators still do not know why the tail fell off American
Flight 587 before the plane crashed shortly after taking off from John F.
Kennedy International Airport on Nov. 12. The crash killed 265 people.</TE>
<TE>   Flight 587 experienced several sharp side-to-side movements before its
tail fell off and the plane crashed shortly after taking off from
Kennedy. The Federal Aviation Administration last month ordered the
inspections of A300-600 and A310 planes that experience similar
movements.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators do not know if the movements put more stress on the
plane than it was designed to handle, or if the tail had some hidden
damage that weakened it.</TE>
<TE>   Airbus officials have said damage that cannot be seen cannot weaken
the tail. Some American pilots say the planes should have regular
inspections, such as with ultrasound equipment, to look for hidden flaws.</TE>
<TE>   Eight pilots submitted a 70-page report to the safety board and the
FAA last month. Their union, the Allied Pilots Assn., disagreed with the
report, saying there was not enough evidence to ground the plane.</TE>

<HD>House OKs Worker Retirement Savings Protections</HD>
<DH>Pensions: Bill would give employees new rights to sell company
stock and diversify investments. Stricter Senate version expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<AU>PETER GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A divided House on Thursday approved new rules designed to better
protect the retirement savings of American workers, the first Enron
Corp.-inspired reform to pass since the collapse of the energy giant.</LD>
<LD>   The Republican-sponsored measure, approved 255 to 163, contains key
elements of a proposal advanced by President Bush to spare American
workers the same fate as Enron employees, whose retirement nest eggs
vanished when the highflying Houston company filed for bankruptcy
protection.</LD>
<LD>   The measure would give employees new rights to sell company stock and
diversify investments in their 401(k) retirement accounts. It will go to
the Democrat-controlled Senate, which is expected to take up a more
stringent proposal.</LD>
<TE>   Lawmakers are under election-year pressure to do something about the
problems exposed by the Enron collapse. Democrats and Republicans want to
be seen as reformers rather than recipients of the politically aggressive
company's campaign contributions. Even as the retirement bill was being
passed Thursday, a House committee pressed ahead with legislation to
increase oversight of accountants and impose new financial disclosure
requirements on corporations.</TE>
<TE>   "With Enron large in legislators' minds, I believe they ultimately
will pass a pension bill that the president will sign," said Larry
Soderquist, a Vanderbilt University law professor.</TE>
<TE>   But even as it was being approved, the House measure came in for sharp
criticism. Democrats and independent retirement policy experts argue that
it does not come close to solving the Enron-related problems and includes
little-noticed provisions that could make similar financial debacles
more, not less, probable.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, critics say, the measure would encourage the use
of financial advisors who could have conflicts of interest, such as
receiving commissions on the investments they recommend to workers. The
critics also say it could undermine rules intended to ensure that most of
the benefits in tax-favored pensions and 401(k) plans go to lower-paid
workers rather than top executives.</TE>
<TE>   "This measure opens the door widely to the problems it claims to fix,"
said Daniel Halperin, a former Treasury official and pension expert at
Harvard Law School.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-two million employees own 401(k) accounts with $2 trillion in
assets, and new safeguards to protect retirement plans have been among
the most hotly debated issues emerging from the Enron collapse. Under
401(k) plans, named for a section of the Tax Code, workers are offered
tax breaks to set aside money for retirement. Their employers also are
offered breaks for matching employee contributions--often in company
stock.</TE>
<TE>   Enron employees lost as much as $1 billion of retirement savings when
the value of the company stock, which made up more than half the total in
their accounts, plummeted and they were unable to get out of the stock
because of company restrictions on selling it. Their losses were all the
more galling because executives, who knew of the company's mounting
troubles, sold large blocks of stock even as they exhorted their
employees to keep buying shares.</TE>
<TE>   Under the House measure, companies would have to permit employees to
sell company stock contributions on a rolling basis after three years.
Currently, companies can impose much stricter limits. Enron, for example,
required workers to hold company stock until they were age 50.</TE>
<TE>   The bill's authors said the change would help keep workers' accounts
from becoming dangerously concentrated in company stock and would update
antiquated federal laws.</TE>
<TE>   Enron workers were "the victims of outdated federal pension laws,"
said Rep. John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), chairman of the House Committee on
Education and the Work Force.</TE>
<TE>   But some policy experts said the three-year holding period was too
long. "The paramount threat to sound diversification of retirement
accounts is over-investment in company stock" and the House measure does
not fix the problem, said J. Mark Iwry, a former Treasury official who
oversaw employee-benefits regulation from 1995 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Why should there be any restriction?" asked Michael S. Gordon, a
Washington pension lawyer who helped write the landmark 1974 law that
regulates traditional company-sponsored pensions.</TE>
<TE>   Even without restrictions, pension experts agree that most workers
hang on to more company stock than they should--because it is familiar
and because they receive little investment advice from their employers,
who want to avoid becoming legally liable for the performance of their
workers' retirement accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The House measure would encourage companies to make investment advice
available to workers, but would do so in a way that has provoked
criticism. The bill would permit advisors to steer employees to
investments in which they have a financial stake as long as they disclose
that stake. Critics said the measure also would permit companies to hire
advisors who would not help workers in handling company stock.</TE>
<TE>   "The advice provisions of the bill wouldn't prevent another Enron
situation, at least in part because they don't preclude employers and
advisors from contracting to limit advice," Iwry said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such concerns, the president praised the House measure
Thursday, saying in a statement, "The reforms will give employees better
access to investment advice, additional notice of blackouts and increased
ability to diversify. Importantly, the reforms adhere to the principle
that what is right for executives is also right for workers."</TE>
<TE>   The House bill also bars senior executives from selling stock during
so-called blackout, or lock-down, periods, such as the one that kept
Enron employees from selling shares when the company stock value
plummeted. It also would require companies to give 30 days' notice before
a blackout period begins. Companies also would be required to give
workers quarterly benefit statements that include information about
accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the Health, Education,
Labor and Pensions Committee and author of the competing Senate bill,
countered, "Sadly, the Republican-backed bill that passed the House fails
to prevent future Enrons, and fails to protect worker pensions."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy's bill would set stricter limits on firms' use of company
stock to contribute to 401(k) accounts. It would, among other things,
require company executives to notify employees when they are dumping
company stock, give employees seats on pension boards and impose stiffer
penalties for violations of worker pension rights.</TE>
<TE>   But business groups and their Republican allies in Congress oppose the
Democratic proposals, contending that they are too extreme and would
discourage companies from offering 401(k) plans.</TE>
<TE>   Some pension experts were incensed about a little-noticed provision of
the House measure that they said would ease rules that require pensions
and 401(k) plans to direct almost three-quarters of their benefits to
lower-paid workers to qualify for tax breaks. The bill's authors said
that the change would make little difference.</TE>

<LD>Vanessa Leggett, an aspiring Texas crime writer jailed for more
than five months for defying a subpoena to turn over interviews in a
murder case, was named winner of the PEN First Amendment Award on
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Leggett asserted that a reporter's privilege protected her from being
forced to disclose confidential sources used in researching a book about
the killing of Doris Angleton, wife of a Houston millionaire. Leggett
will receive a $25,000 prize April 24 at the annual PEN Gala.</LD>

<HD>Sharing Ordered for Terror Suspects' List</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft directed the Justice Department on
Thursday to share the names of suspected terrorists to help prevent them
from sneaking into the United States, prompting concerns from civil
rights advocates that it could lead to police harassment of innocent
people.</LD>
<LD>   Ashcroft's order covers all Justice Department agencies, including the
FBI and the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</LD>
<LD>   They will provide the names to be included in a State Department
computer database used to screen visa applicants and in a U.S. Customs
database that checks travelers at ports of entry across the United
States. Thousands of the most detailed examples will also go into the
National Crime Information Center, a database used by 650,000 state and
local law enforcement agencies, Ashcroft said.</LD>
<TE>   "Information is the best friend of prevention," Ashcroft said. Law
enforcement officials at all levels "must work together, coordinating
information and leveraging resources in the joint effort to prevent and
disrupt terrorist activity."</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft also directed the Justice Department agencies to seek similar
information from foreign governments and to add those names too.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Justice Department official who asked not to be identified
said the list of names could grow to as many as 100,000 people tied in
some way to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The system was quietly put in place on a limited basis several months
ago, when the FBI entered some names of suspected terrorists into the
crime information center, the official said. He would not say whether
anyone had been detained or questioned as a result.</TE>
<TE>   Such improved data-sharing is essential in stopping terrorists from
coming into the United States and from operating within the nation's
borders if they somehow managed to sneak in, Ashcroft said.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department official said many terrorists had been able to
sneak into the United States from Canada and Mexico and to operate freely
within the U.S. Such an enhanced data-sharing system, he said, may help
identify them. It could also alert authorities to people who entered the
country legally but were later determined to have suspected connections
to terrorist activity.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be our first line of defense," the official said. "If the
U.S. government thinks this person is a terrorist, we ought to let our
law enforcement people know."</TE>
<TE>   The official noted that Maryland state police had stopped one of the
Sept. 11 hijackers, Ziad Samir Jarrah, for speeding just days before the
attacks but let him go because he was not "wanted" for any crimes or for
suspected terrorist activity. If the new system had been in place, and
information had been forwarded by foreign governments about his alleged
terrorist ties, Jarrah's name could have registered as a "hit,", giving
authorities the ability to monitor or detain him, said the official.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been a signal to the U.S. government that there was a
terrorist in our midst," the official said. "Our borders are too porous.
We need to do something inside the United States."</TE>
<TE>   State and local authorities will be given only a minimal amount of
information about suspected terrorists, none of it classified or based on
intelligence data, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   In most cases, if a person's name shows up on the database and an
arrest warrant has not been issued, local police will be told only to
contact the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Elisa Massimino, Washington director for the Lawyers Committee for
Human Rights, said she believes that federal agencies need to do a better
job of sharing information about suspected terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   But she said that Ashcroft's directive appears to be so broad that it
could cause police to question people whose names are similar to those on
the list or who may be suspected of terrorist activity based on
inadequate or inaccurate information.</TE>
<TE>   Massimino also said foreign governments could unfairly label
dissenters or political or human rights activists as terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "There is likely to be a serious problem unless there is extensive and
serious training and oversight of state and local law enforcement,"
Massimino said. "This is essentially an invitation to ethnic profiling."</TE>

</DL>
<LD>A former White House advisor on counterterrorism was appointed
Thursday as head of the agency that oversees Logan Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Craig Coy, former chief executive of the personnel management company
HR Logic Inc., was named chief executive of the Massachusetts Port
Authority.</LD>
<LD>   Security at Logan was heavily criticized, and Massport was condemned
as an assemblage of political appointees, after the World Trade Center
was brought down by two jetliners hijacked out of Logan on Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   Coy's predecessor, Virginia Buckingham, a former chief of staff to
Govs. Paul Cellucci and William Weld, quit in October.</TE>
<TE>   "I come here to work," said Coy, 52, a 20-year Coast Guard veteran who
served as deputy director for counterterrorism for the National Security
Council.</TE>
<TE>   Massport's board of directors approved a four-year contract for the
$250,000-a-year job to protect Coy from political pressure.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Gov. Jane Swift said she would not make any more
political appointments to the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Swift, who once held a patronage job at Massport, also released a
report in December recommending a major shake-up and up to $80 million in
immediate security improvements at the agency.</TE>

<HD>Ridge Is Urged to Publicly Discuss Security Needs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Homeland security chief Tom Ridge met with members of a
congressional panel behind closed doors for the second time in as many
days Thursday as lawmakers pressed him to publicly discuss the
administration's $38-billion request for homeland security.</LD>
<LD>   "Given the bearing of his work on the lives of every man, woman and
child living within our borders, he needs to work with Congress, in
public, to fully explore these issues, to flesh out his successes, to
describe his difficulties and to discuss his needs," said Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.), who had invited Ridge to testify before the Senate
Government Affairs Committee on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Ridge declined to appear before the committee chaired by Lieberman,
but he met privately with the Government Reform Committee in the
Republican-controlled House. Ridge spoke Wednesday at a private meeting
of a House appropriations subcommittee.</LD>
<TE>   For more than a month, Ridge and congressional lawmakers have been in
a standoff over whether the homeland security chief should have to
testify publicly about his activities.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said Ridge's
closed-door meetings with Republican-led panels in the House were
"absolutely not acceptable."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert C. Byrd (D-W. Va.)
wrapped up a two-day hearing on homeland defense by saying the nation was
still in danger of terrorist attacks and renewing his call for Ridge to
testify before his panel.</TE>
<TE>   "The American people are entitled to hear what Director Ridge has to
say," Byrd said.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle said seeking a subpoena to force Ridge to testify openly
before Congress remained an option, as well as legislation that could
compel such testimony.</TE>
<TE>   The legislative option would turn the office of homeland security,
created by President Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks, into a
congressionally established agency whose chief would have budget
authority and have to be confirmed by Congress.</TE>
<TE>   As such, Ridge could be required to testify on Capitol Hill. Bush
contends Ridge cannot be forced to do so now and that such an appearance
would compromise his role as a presidential advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Ridge echoed that view at an open meeting with the American Society of
Newspaper Editors on Thursday, following his private talks with
lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a constitutional tension at play here and there's a principle
at play," Ridge said. "It is a separation of powers issue."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Ridge said he would be accessible to members of Congress and
plans to confer with more of them in private in coming weeks.</TE>

<HD>Convicted Killer Competent, Texas Jury Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CONROE, Texas
</DL>
<LD>Convicted killer Johnny Paul Penry, described by his lawyers as
mentally retarded, is competent to assist in his defense and can face a
third hearing on whether he should get the death penalty, a jury decided
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The jury deliberated for 45 minutes before returning its verdict.</LD>
<LD>   Penry, 45, has spent half his life locked up for killing Pamela
Moseley Carpenter in 1979 at her home in Livingston.</LD>
<TE>   He was twice sentenced to death, but both sentences were overturned by
the U.S. Supreme Court, most recently last June. His murder conviction
stands, meaning the only question a trial jury will answer at the third
sentencing hearing is whether Penry deserves life in prison or lethal
injection.</TE>
<TE>   "We are happy, but we know we still have a long battle ahead of us,"
Ellen May, the victim's niece, said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Another case pending with the U.S. Supreme Court could still affect
the Penry case. The high court is considering a Virginia case that
questions the constitutionality of executing the mentally retarded. A
ruling in that case is expected by June.</TE>
<TE>   During closing arguments Thursday, defense attorneys emphasized the
helplessness of Penry, who likes coloring books and says he still
believes in Santa Claus.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the usual case where a defendant comes up with a scam
after he gets into trouble with the law," attorney Julia Tarver told
jurors. "He's not able to do things you and I do all the time without
ever thinking about it."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors, however, said they did not believe Penry was mentally
retarded and accused his lawyers of trying to raise standards for mental
competency in Texas beyond what the law provides.</TE>
<TE>   Death penalty opponents have pointed to Penry as a reason why Texas
should prohibit executions of mentally retarded people.</TE>

<HD>El Nino May Be Felt by Midsummer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The United States could begin seeing the effects of the developing
El Nino climate phenomenon by midsummer, government scientists said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   While the first symptom of El Nino is an unusual warming of the
central Pacific Ocean, weather conditions worldwide eventually can be
affected.</LD>
<LD>   "This El Nino is still forming, and it's unclear now at what level of
intensity it will be once it's fully developed," said Conrad C.
Lautenbacher, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.</LD>
<TE>   "If sea-surface temperatures continue their warming trend in the
equatorial Pacific, we'll likely know the intensity by late May or June,"
he said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on its strength, the effects of El Nino could range from
reducing the number of Atlantic hurricanes and a drier-than-normal summer
monsoon season in the southwest to more Nor'easters next winter.</TE>
<TE>   NOAA researchers say they are observing a continuation of
warmer-than-normal sea-surface and subsurface temperatures across much of
the equatorial Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, ocean surface temperatures were as high as 4 to 6 degrees
Fahrenheit above average near the coasts of Ecuador and northern Peru.
Average ocean surface temperatures are about 81 degrees Fahrenheit in
this area in March.</TE>
<TE>   Also, scientists said there was increased rainfall over the extreme
eastern tropical Pacific, including the Galapagos Islands, and over the
west-central equatorial Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   As El Nino continues to develop, scientists said, the possible effects
on the United States could also include a drier-than-normal fall and
winter for the Pacific Northwest, warmer-than-normal late fall and winter
in the northern Great Plains and wetter-than-normal winter for the Gulf
Coast states.</TE>
<TE>   If the intensity of El Nino is strong, central and Southern California
could experience wetter-than-normal conditions.</TE>

<HD>Shark Bite Seriously Injures 'Bold' Researcher</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MIAMI
</DL>
<LD>A shark expert known for unusual research methods and "pushing the
envelope" in his study of the feared marine predator's behavior was badly
bitten by a shark in the Bahamas, colleagues said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Erich Ritter, chief scientist for the Princeton, N.J.-based Global
Shark Attack File, was bitten in the calf by what was believed to be a
350-pound bull shark during filming of a Discovery Channel program off
Walker's Cay, Bahamas, on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a serious injury," said Marie Levine, executive director of
the Shark Research Institute in Princeton. "He's going to be in the
hospital for four or five more weeks."</LD>
<TE>   A series of particularly gruesome shark attacks, including one where
an 8-year-old boy lost an arm to a bull shark in Florida, earned
international media attention last summer, although the year turned out
to be an average one with 76 attacks recorded worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say shark attacks are very rare and may be increasing only
because more people are using the oceans for recreation.</TE>
<TE>   Ritter, 43, was bitten in murky, waist-deep water as he worked with
lemon, black-tip and bull sharks for the television program, Levine said.</TE>
<TE>   It appears the bull shark was chasing a remora, a smaller fish, and
bit Ritter by accident.</TE>
<TE>   "There was food in the water about 15 yards from Erich. A bull shark
closed on the remora but in the low visibility bit Erich instead," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The shark's teeth went to the bone and Ritter was rushed to a hospital
in West Palm Beach, Fla., where he underwent an arterial graft and
possibly a skin graft on the calf wound, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "They were really pushing the envelope," Levine said. "This is one of
those things that can happen when you're working with big animals and it
was an accident."</TE>
<TE>   But Dr. Sam Gruber, a University of Miami shark expert who worked with
Ritter in the 1990s, said Ritter's methods were not accepted by the
scientific community and called him "an accident waiting to happen."</TE>
<TE>   "He has been getting more and more fearless, or some would say bold.
This method is basically to titillate TV cameras," Gruber said.</TE>
<TE>   Gruber said Ritter believed his study of the marine predators had made
him immune to shark bites and called his methods damaging to those trying
to do "legitimate" research on sharks.</TE>
<TE>   "He believes he can read the minds of sharks and that he knows
everything about shark behavior so he can predict what they are going to
do," Gruber said. "Those predictions will never be accurate enough to
say, 'This is what will happen 100% of the time.' "</TE>

<DL>LITTLE ROCK, Ark.
</DL>
<LD>The family behind the Wal-Mart empire on Thursday gave $300 million
to the University of Arkansas, the largest gift on record to a public
university in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   The money, from the Walton Family Charitable Support Foundation, will
establish an undergraduate honors college and also go toward the
university's graduate school.</LD>
<LD>   "What the Walton family has done today will improve life in Arkansas
for generations to come, and we are grateful beyond words," Chancellor
John A. White said.</LD>
<TE>   Sam Walton, who died in 1992, started Bentonville-based Wal-Mart four
decades ago. It is now the largest company in the world. Walton's sons
Rob and Jim are University of Arkansas alumni. Rob Walton is Wal-Mart
chairman.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, the donation is the
fifth-largest to any U.S. university, public or private. The largest was
$600 million, given last year to Caltech by Intel Corp. founder Gordon
Moore and his wife, Betty.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Allen, a Walton foundation spokesman, said Walton family members
did not attend the announcement because they wanted the focus to be on
the school.</TE>
<TE>   The university's business school already was named for Sam Walton,
after a $50-million gift from the family in 1998.</TE>

<HD>Senator Bashes White House Proposal on Pollutants</HD>
<DH>Environment: The plan for enacting a global treaty fails to address
dealing with future harmful substances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>James M. Jeffords, chairman of the Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee, took issue Thursday with a White House proposal to enact
a treaty phasing out a dozen highly toxic chemicals without offering a
means to eliminate future pollutants.</LD>
<LD>   "To send up this proposal without the ability to regulate new harmful
substances is shortsighted and does not fulfill our commitment to this
global treaty," said Jeffords (I-Vt.), who introduced a bill that would
restore such an ability.</LD>
<LD>   The treaty contains a provision for dealing with future pollutants;
the administration's legislation enabling Congress to enact the treaty is
missing that provision.</LD>
<TE>   Sen. Bob Smith (R-N.H.), is sponsoring the White House effort to have
the Senate ratify the Clinton-era treaty on persistent organic
pollutants, or POPs, and have Congress pass legislation enabling the
treaty.</TE>
<TE>   "This needs to be done and be done quickly," said Smith, who was
Jeffords' predecessor as chairman of the committee.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christie Whitman signed
the POPs treaty on behalf of the United States on May 23. A year after
promising to ask the Senate to ratify the treaty, President Bush formally
submitted his request Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The administration offered Congress no advice on how to meet the
treaty's goal of adding future pollutants to the hit list.</TE>
<TE>   At least one of EPA's earlier drafts, a copy of which was obtained by
Associated Press, provided a mechanism for anticipating what chemicals
might be added to the phase-out.</TE>
<TE>   The disputed provision would allow additional chemicals to be banned
only after a rigorous scientific review involving analysis by a science
committee and approval by a majority of nations involved. In the
administration's latest proposal, the agency and the State Department
left that process out.</TE>
<TE>   "It got so complicated to find language that was comprehensive enough
and yet didn't tie our hands or would be something that could be accepted
by the rest of the world community," Whitman said. "We still embrace the
idea that there are going to be future chemicals that are going to be
added."</TE>
<TE>   EPA Assistant Administrator Stephen Johnson said Bush administration
officials would work with Congress on the legislation, and that senior
EPA staff members would meet with their counterparts from other countries
in June to discuss the process for "balancing risks and benefits" of
banning future chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   Some said the Bush administration's shift makes it more likely that
Congress will either not deal with the issue or will approve a process
for including new chemicals that would require amending the enabling law.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush administration proposal ties the EPA's hands, limiting
domestic implementation to 12 POPs already regulated in the U.S.," said
Dr. Robert K. Musil, executive director of Physicians for Social
Responsibility, an advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the pollutants among the group commonly referred to as the
"dirty dozen"--PCBs, dioxins and furans, along with DDT and other
pesticides--are no longer used in industrialized countries such as the
United States, but many are still widely used in developing nations.</TE>
<TE>   Production and use of nine of the 12 chemicals would be banned as soon
as the treaty took effect, which would take at least several years.</TE>
<TE>   About 25 countries would be allowed to continue to use DDT to combat
malaria in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines, pending
development of safer solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Releases of dioxins and furans--toxic byproducts of waste burning and
industrial production--would be reduced and eventually eliminated where
feasible, according to the treaty.</TE>

<HD>2 Climbers Rescued in Alaska, 2 Still Missing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ANCHORAGE
</DL>
<LD>Two climbers were rescued from Alaska's second-highest peak, while
their two expedition partners were missing and presumed dead, the
National Park Service said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The events occurred on Mt. St. Elias, which rises to 18,008 feet and
is on the Alaska-Yukon border and on the eastern edge of Alaska's
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve.</LD>
<LD>   The Alaska National Guard launched a rescue mission after the
climbers' air taxi pilot flew over the peak early Wednesday and saw a
message stamped in the snow that said two were dead and two needed
rescuing, the Park Service said.</LD>
<TE>   Plucked from the mountain Wednesday and flown to Anchorage were John
Griber and Greg Von Dorsten, both of Jackson Hole, Wyo., the Park Service
said.</TE>
<TE>   Their partners, Aaron Martin of Lake Tahoe and Reed Sanders of West
Yellowstone, Mont., were presumed dead, the Park Service said.</TE>
<TE>   Griber, Martin and Sanders were descending from the summit on skis
Tuesday when Martin and Sanders disappeared, the Park Service said.</TE>
<TE>   Griber told officials he saw Martin fall at least 4,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Von Dorsten, who had frostbitten hands, was at a camp at the
14,500-foot level of the peak and had not attempted to reach the summit,
said Hunter Sharp, Wrangell-St. Elias' chief ranger.</TE>
<TE>   The mountain was enveloped in a snowstorm Thursday, but attempts to
locate the missing climbers will resume when weather clears, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mt. St. Elias is considered technically challenging. It is attempted
by few climbers, in comparison with Alaska's Mt. McKinley, North
America's highest peak, which draws more than 1,000 climbers every
summer.</TE>

<HD>Enron Official's Final Note Released</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SUGAR LAND, Texas
</DL>
<LD>An anguished note left behind by a former Enron Corp. executive who
killed himself in January makes no specific mention of the energy giant's
collapse but says, "Where there was once great pride, now it's gone."</LD>
<LD>   The police department in this Houston suburb released the
seven-sentence note from John Clifford Baxter immediately after the Texas
attorney general's office issued an opinion that the document was a
public record.</LD>
<LD>   About two hours later, a judge granted a request from Baxter's family
for a temporary restraining order sealing the handwritten note. The
family had opposed its release, citing privacy issues.</LD>
<TE>   Baxter, who resigned as vice chairman in May 2001, months before Enron
collapsed, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on Jan. 25.
He was 43.</TE>
<TE>   The note, addressed to his wife, Carol, said: "I am so sorry for this.
I feel I just can't go on. I have always tried to do the right thing but
where there was once great pride now it's gone. I love you and the
children so much. I just can't be any good to you or myself. The pain is
overwhelming. Please try to forgive me." It was signed, "Cliff."</TE>
<TE>   The note was handwritten in all capital letters on a blank sheet of
paper. An attorney for the family, Pike Powers, has said it was left in
Carol Baxter's car in the garage of the family home. The home is a
half-mile from the spot where his body was found.</TE>
<TE>   Police spokeswoman Pat Whitty said officials saw no reason to delay
release of the note once the attorney general's office issued its
opinion. However, she said the restraining order was granted before
photos of Baxter's body and car were released, so those items will not be
made public immediately.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general's office had until Friday to make a decision. It
turned aside arguments that the note might embarrass or invade the
privacy of Baxter's family, "given the substantial public interest in the
causes of Enron's failure and its far-reaching consequences."</TE>

<HD>2 Vermont Sheep Found to Have a Rare, Brain-Deforming Disease</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Two sheep, seized from a Vermont farm by U.S. government officials
last year, tested positive for a family of rare, brain-deforming animal
diseases that includes scrapie and mad cow disease, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The USDA said tissues from the infected sheep were found to have a
foreign strain of a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy disease, but
the type of TSE was not yet known.</LD>
<LD>   Scrapie and mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, are
from the same family of diseases known as TSEs, which cause infected
brains to become spongy and eventually wither. No cases of mad cow
disease have been discovered in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   The sheep were part of a flock of 125 confiscated by the USDA in March
2001 after four animals from a nearby flock tested positive for TSE in
July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The USDA has acquired, killed and tested 380 Vermont sheep for animal
diseases. USDA said none of the animals entered the animal or human food
supply.</TE>
<TE>   The sheep, imported by Vermont farmers from Belgium and the
Netherlands, had been under quarantine since 1998.</TE>

<HD>Astronauts, for Starters, Bolt a Girder to Station</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Two spacewalking astronauts bolted a 44-foot girder to the
international space station on Thursday, completing the first step in one
of the most complicated construction jobs yet at the orbiting outpost.</LD>
<LD>   The 27,000-pound beam was first hoisted into place and clamped down by
the space station's 58-foot robot arm, operated by remote control from
inside the spacecraft by two astronauts.</LD>
<LD>   Then two other astronauts, Steven Smith and Rex Walheim, floated
outside, unfolded two V-shaped struts on the girder and bolted them down.
As he put the final twist on the last of eight bolts, Walheim shouted,
"Hot dog!"</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to put in for your ironworker's card," NASA's most
experienced spacewalker, Jerry Ross, said from inside Atlantis.</TE>
<TE>   Space shuttle Atlantis' visiting astronauts will go out three more
times to finish installing the $600-million girder, the first section of
a framework that eventually will stretch 356 feet and hold a collection
of solar wings, radiators and science experiments.</TE>
<TE>   During Thursday's outing, Smith and Walheim also hooked up power
cables and fluid lines. Some of the hoses were stiff and twisted, and the
tray containing them was hard to release. It took both of them to yank
the tray loose.</TE>
<TE>   That put the spacewalkers behind, so much so that Mission Control
ordered Smith to briefly retreat to the station air lock Thursday
afternoon and recharge his oxygen supply.</TE>
<TE>   The spacewalk ended up lasting almost eight hours, more than an hour
longer than planned. "You guys did a fantastic job today," Mission
Control said. "You're probably ready to come on in."</TE>
<TE>   It was also a tiring day for the robot-arm operators, who put in 13
hours at the controls in the space station laboratory. "You set a new
world record," Mission Control told crane operators Ellen Ochoa and
Daniel Bursch.</TE>
<TE>   Walheim, making his first spaceflight, was exuberant as he gazed at
Earth 240 miles below. "This is incredible," he said. "Unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   "Sounds like you're having too much fun out there," Ross said.</TE>
<TE>   The aluminum girder contains more than 10 miles of wiring and 664 feet
of plumbing. It has 475,000 parts, including four computers and four
Global Positioning System satellite antennas.</TE>
<TE>   Also attached to the structure is a track on which a $190-million rail
car will move, hauling cargo from one end of the framework to the other.
The spacewalkers hooked up a reeled cable system to the rail car and
track, in their last chore outside.</TE>
<TE>   Atlantis will remain docked at space station Alpha until Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Negligence Alleged in Philadelphia Deaths</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA
</DL>
<LD>Fire department officials are reviewing their procedures after
allegations that paramedics contributed to two deaths in three weeks by
failing to immediately transport patients to hospitals.</LD>
<LD>   In the most recent case, paramedics on Monday left a 64-year-old
cancer patient, Ethel Thornton, for dead in her apartment. Two hours
later, morgue workers arrived and found her with a faint pulse. She later
died at a hospital.</LD>
<LD>   The two paramedics have been put on administrative duty pending an
investigation, Executive Fire Chief William Brightcliffe said Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   In the earlier case, a 1-year-old boy who was seriously ill with a
cold and fever died hours after paramedics failed to transport him. The
parents of Marquis Dunson say paramedics told them it would be cheaper if
they drove Marquis to a clinic, which they did.</TE>
<TE>   They waited at the clinic for more than an hour before a doctor saw
the baby and sent him to a hospital, where he died 23 minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   Fire department officials reviewing the two deaths said they will
consider a broader look at their policies if warranted.</TE>
<TE>   Two paramedics have been suspended for 30 days with intent to dismiss
as a result of the Dunson case.</TE>
<TE>   Vincente Ortiz, 27, and Joanne Prezeworski, 24, deny allegations that
they suggested that Marquis' parents could save $200 by taking the baby
to get medical care themselves, according to Tom O'Drain, president of
Firefighters Local 22. They also insist that they offered three times to
transport the child to a hospital, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he does not know if the paramedics took the baby's vital
signs.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time critics have charged that a delay by city
emergency workers was partly to blame in a death.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a city dispatcher was sentenced to one to two years in
prison for diverting 911 calls to a private ambulance company where she
worked part time. A lawsuit filed against the city alleges that her
actions led to a delay that contributed to the death of a man.</TE>

<DL>ATLANTA
</DL>
<LD>Each pack of cigarettes sold in the United States costs the nation
$7 in medical care and lost productivity, the government said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta
put the nation's total cost of smoking at $3,391 a year for every smoker,
or $157.7 billion. Health experts had previously estimated $96 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Americans buy about 22 billion packs of cigarettes annually. The CDC
study is the first to establish a per-pack cost to the nation.</LD>
<TE>   The agency estimated the nation's smoking-related medical costs at
$3.45 per pack, and said job productivity lost because of premature death
from smoking amounted to $3.73 per pack, for a total of $7.18.</TE>
<TE>   The average cost of a pack of cigarettes in 1999 was $2.92.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a big difference in the cost to society and what society is
getting back in tax," said the CDC's Dr. Terry Pechacek. "We believe
society is bearing a burden for the individual behavioral choices of the
smokers."</TE>
<TE>   The CDC said it analyzed expenses, both personal and for the
health-care industry, and used national medical surveys to calculate the
costs to the nation.</TE>
<TE>   The agency also reported that smoking results in about 440,000 deaths
a year in the United States, up from the government's previous figure of
430,000, established in the early 1990s. The new study was conducted from
1995 to 1999.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for tobacco giant Brown &amp; Williamson objected that the
study presents the figures in a vacuum, without comparing smoking to the
financial burdens other people--nonsmokers with diabetes, for
example--place on society.</TE>
<TE>   "What does that number mean?" spokesman Mark Smith said. "It doesn't
mean anything. It's bordering on meaningless."</TE>
<TE>   Representatives from the nation's two other leading tobacco
companies--Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds--did not immediately return
calls for comment.</TE>
