<LD>I was the only one wearing polyester at the Paul Krassner party. I
had on the dark blazer that I take to places where I'm not sure what
to wear. Everyone else was in denim, except for those in corduroy. At
least one man wore overalls. I had on Dockers.</LD>
<LD>   It was Krassner night at the Midnight Special, a bookstore in
Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade that furnishes a back room
where authors can hustle their latest work. I've hustled there too,
groveling like a pig to make 12 cents on the dollar.</LD>
<LD>   Krassner, to continue with animal metaphors, is like an old bird
of cultural prey, hovering over a society fat with potential victims:
FBI agents, greedy industrialists, horny and nonhorny politicians,
celebrities, filmmakers, educators and anyone else who has fed at the
public trough.</LD>
<TE>   They're all in his new book, "Murder at the Conspiracy
Convention," a collection of essays, observations and hallucinations
that reestablish this enfant terrible of the 1960s as the last voice
of the revolution that rocked America 40 years ago. And he's still
rocking.</TE>
<TE>   Krassner is 69, but none of his timing was off as he hurtled
through an hour and a half of the kind of ad-libbed monologue that
makes hip, quick-shooting cultural observers like Dennis Miller seem
slow and ponderous.</TE>
<TE>   The back room was jammed with mostly middle-age people looking for
a new uprising, the same kinds of edgy thinkers who marched for peace
and love and justice back then, but who mostly now sit and listen.
Time does that to a person.</TE>
<TE>   Krassner shot new life into them, and when it came time for the
Q-and-A period, they were at him like wild dogs (animal metaphor No.
3), asking, stating, demanding, declaring, clarifying. They could
hear the drums of insurgency again, rattling faintly in memory.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Krassner, limping through life like an angry troll, has
become a kind of icon of the counterculturists, the one who never
surrendered. He's a small man with curly hair and an expression
that's somewhere between grin and grimace. The limp is from a police
beating years ago when his forum was as much the street as the
podium.</TE>
<TE>   He co-founded the Yippie movement and was one of those who turned
Chicago's 1968 Democratic National Convention into a showcase for
anti-Vietnam War activists. But while other voices faded into
silence, Krassner went on to found the Realist, a satirical journal
that resonated with humor and outrage, and to fill books and
magazines with views from the radical left.</TE>
<TE>   He's an enemy of the absurd, as all good satirists must be,
whether he's reporting on a guy flossing while urinating in an
airport men's room or doing shtick on a convention speaker telling
his audience he's a CIA mind-controlled sex slave.</TE>
<TE>   The latter occurred at the so-called Conspiracy Convention last
year in San Jose, where a second speaker riffed on sex between humans
and lizards from outer space.</TE>
<TE>   Krassner prides himself on being an investigative satirist, but
he's a stand-up comic too, and occasionally truth and whimsy overlap.
I wasn't always sure what was real and what sprang from the ironies
that existed in his head, a world into which all the fools and true
believers somehow fit.</TE>
<TE>   His delivery that night at the Midnight Special was a microcosm of
the book itself, funny and far-ranging comments on the news of a
world in abject confusion:</TE>
<TE>   On the Catholic Church pedophilia scandal: "What do they put in
those wafers anyhow?"</TE>
<TE>   On the display of American flags after the 9/11 attacks: "Am I
alone in this, or do you find it ironic that the flags are made in
China by slave labor?"</TE>
<TE>   On the claims of the Jews in the Middle East: "God didn't promise
them the land. He just said he'd do what he could."</TE>
<TE>   An exponent of Lenny Bruce humor, he has a monologue filled with
the kind of expletives that rarely make the straight press, and sure
as, er, heck don't make ours. A highlight of the evening, for
instance, was when the audience joined him in giving a loud and
somewhat boisterous verbal finger to Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to believe sometimes that the guy limping into battle
with popes and presidents began as a concert violinist. He's been
playing since age 3, and at 6 was the youngest concert artist ever to
perform in Carnegie Hall. He gave it up when, scratching one itchy
leg with the other while performing on stage, he made the audience
laugh, loved the sound and has been at it ever since.</TE>
<TE>   In his foreword to "Conspiracy," fellow comic George Carlin talks
about Krassner's "informed sense of outrage, his intelligent dissent
and his ever-lively spirit of civic mischief."</TE>
<TE>   It's all there, all right, just as it has been for the last four
decades. He brought it back again in Santa Monica with wit and irony.
I was almost sorry I'd worn that stupid polyester blazer.</TE>

<DH>New 'smart' appliances for the home gain a U.S. foothold in
Playa Vista</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AL RIDENOUR</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Somewhere in Sweden a robot vacuum is scuttling beneath a dining
table. A continent away, a Korean homeowner is using the videophone
on his refrigerator. And, in Japan, technicians are teaching toilet
seats to measure blood pressure.</LD>
<LD>   As a new generation of "smart" appliances (those that digitally
store and share information) are embraced by consumers overseas, U.S.
companies are pushing harder to move American households out of the
century of iceboxes and washboards.</LD>
<LD>   One of the most dramatic efforts is targeted for the Playa Vista
development near Marina del Rey, where the first of a suite of
intelligent appliances from Whirlpool are to be installed this
autumn. Ultimately targeted at the general market, this collection
includes an Internet-enabled refrigerator, microwave, convection oven
and dishwasher.</LD>
<TE>   The high-tech refrigerator will fill its traditional role as a
bulletin board for family memos, calendars and shopping lists,
displaying information on a bracket-mounted wireless Web tablet
loaded with household planning software. The wireless tablet, which
can be removed and used from anywhere in the home, connects with the
other appliances and can be used remotely to set their controls and
monitor their status or service needs. It can also be used as a Web
browser for downloading device-specific cooking and washing
instructions to be posted online by Whirlpool.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not just technology for technology's sake," says Ken
Agid, Playa Vista vice president of marketing. "In terms of energy
conservation, networked appliances can minimize peak loads. If you
decide you'd like to cook a thick slab of bacon in your microwave,
that device can send a message to the refrigerator saying, 'Don't go
into your high-energy ice cube manufacturing,' and to the washer,
'Suspend the spin cycle 45 seconds while I cook these puppies.' "</TE>
<TE>   Smart appliances can also be programmed to do the tasks during
low-rate periods when residents are sleeping or out. They can assist
with their own maintenance, performing diagnostics, and e-mail the
user if they pinpoint a part that needs replacing.</TE>
<TE>   Using embedded bar-code scanning technology, your refrigerator, he
says, could maintain a user-defined inventory, compile grocery lists
or suggest menus for which all ingredients are present.</TE>
<TE>   Although only a handful of people call Playa Vista home, the
population is expected eventually to swell to 15,000 or more. "We've
got the wires in the walls and the [digital] signal in the streets,"
Agid says. "We actually have more cable connecting the signal than is
currently needed." In Playa Vista parlance, this sort of preparedness
is known as "future-proofing."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone in the "smart living" business agrees that such
infrastructure is necessary. Herman Cardenas, founder and CEO of GE
Smart, a joint venture of General Electric and Microsoft, believes
existing technology can be retrofitted.</TE>
<TE>   "Your dishwasher, range and refrigerator, all already connect at
the load box," he says. "So why force anyone to build a separate
network when you've already got one?" Using a digital signal
superimposed over standard wires carrying electricity, GE Smart
automates home lighting, temperature and security.</TE>
<TE>   More conventional Web-based technology is also being employed.
Incoming telephone calls, Cardenas says, can now be routed directly
to GE Smart speakers throughout the house each with its own memory
and unique Internet address.</TE>
<TE>   "When you pick up the phone and realize it's a call you want to
share with your family, you'll tell the speaker, 'open call,' and
then you'll hear the voice traveling anywhere you go in the home. The
speakers can triangulate your position to find out where that is."</TE>
<TE>   The integration of voice-command technology into domestic systems
is not unique to GE. The Italian Turboair Group has created a stove
hood with speech-recognition capabilities, and the British bathroom
manufacturer Twyford has endowed a prototype toilet with a
voice-activated flushing mechanism. There are also smart appliances
that do the talking themselves. Sweden's Electrolux (maker of the
robotic vacuum) is offering Indian consumers the "Washy Talky," a
washing machine that prompts users with cues like "drop detergent,
close lid and relax" in English or Hindi. And in Maryland, Home
Automated Living provides software that not only recognizes and obeys
voice commands, but also speaks back. (You might tell your computer
to turn off the lights; the computer will tell you that the task has
been accomplished.) The company markets this interface under the
not-quite-reassuring acronym HAL.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly fanciful, if sometimes impractical, leaps of the
imagination have characterized the smart appliance industry, Cardenas
says. Concept products trotted out at trade shows in the late 1990s
were often little more than attention-grabbing pipe dreams. With
exasperation, he refers to the Web-operated blender he saw at a show
a year ago. "Am I supposed to turn on my blender over the Internet
not knowing whether my kid has his hand in it or not?"</TE>
<TE>   For people who are overwhelmed by digital innovations, Playa Vista
is creating what Agid describes as "an optional course of continuing
education that allows people to understand how to live in this
advanced community." Even dyed-in-the-wool analog throwbacks may be
swayed after seeing neighbors enjoying the advantages of a wired
lifestyle. "Technology," he says, "is contagious."</TE>
<TE>   But GE Smart's Cardenas says consumers don't want to learn about
the technology. "And," he adds, "they shouldn't have to." Products
that require minimal instruction or investment and retrofittable
technology, he believes, are the keys to making smart homes succeed.
"There are already some lower-priced products out there," he says,
referring to $150 Internet radios or similarly priced digital picture
frames displaying whatever online image the user selects. "Think
about that one," he says. "Just a push of a button and you could put
the in-laws' picture up before they come by. Anyone could enjoy
that!"</TE>

<HD>When the Yiddish Cowboy Roamed</HD>
<DH>History* Autry exhibition tells the tale of Jews in the Old
West. It is controversial, curators say, for what it does not tackle
in depth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTIJANE LEVINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The idea of chicken soup on the range, of kosher picnics beside the
covered wagon, isn't what usually comes to mind when talk turns to
tales of America's pioneers.</LD>
<LD>   But then again, the West wasn't won just by lanky Mayflower types
who swaggered across the land, guns drawn, shooting bears and
outlaws. Among pioneers on the uncharted Western trails were
immigrants of many colors from many countries of many faiths--all
seeking adventure, opportunity, escape.</LD>
<LD>   Some were Jewish, settlers who first arrived in the East from
Europe and then made the perilous but gloriously scenic trek West to
settle land that must have looked like nirvana.</LD>
<TE>   A new exhibit at the Autry Museum of Western Heritage, "Jewish
Life in the American West: Generation to Generation," helps clarify
the reality and expand the mental image to include the diversity that
really was the Wild West.</TE>
<TE>   "Early Jewish settlers were miners, explorers, gunslingers,
cowboys, suppliers, store owners. Like all who came West, of every
religion, the Jews participated in the whole gamut of activities,"
says Lisa Marr, an assistant curator of the exhibit. Case in point:
There's sheet music on display titled, "I'm a Yiddish Cowboy,"
written by Tough Guy Levi.</TE>
<TE>   "There was so much to do that everyone really had to dive in and
get along with each other," she says.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit focuses mainly on the years 1820-1924. It tells of
families like the Newmarks, who emigrated from Poland to New York
City, then moved West in about 1850 and left a lasting mark on the
culture. Joseph Newmark, a lay rabbi, made the trip first. Then he
sent for his wife and six children, who traveled by boat around Cape
Horn to meet him. While at sea, 14-year-old Myer Newmark kept a daily
journal that describes the scenery, food, games, all the activities
they did and didn't enjoy. The journal, in meticulous handwriting on
yellowed pages, is among the artifacts and photos displayed at the
Autry. "It's an amazing document," says assistant curator Meredith
Hackleman, "for the compelling picture it offers of the journey."</TE>
<TE>   Myer grew up to become one of the first Jewish lawyers in L.A.
Another of Joseph Newmark's children, Sarah, married one of his
nephews, Harris Newmark; the couple helped found L.A.'s oldest
museum, the Southwest Museum, and the Jewish Home for the Aging,
which Newmark descendants still support. Harris later wrote a book,
"Sixty Years in Southern California," which Hackleman calls "one of
the best sources on early Los Angeles life." Joseph and his wife
helped found a hospital that grew to become part of Cedars-Sinai, and
the university that eventually became Loyola-Marymount.</TE>
<TE>   Tales of pioneer women are told through the work of artist Andrea
Kalinowski, whose mixed-media canvas combines quilt designs with
digitally reproduced pictures of Jewish pioneer women, along with the
women's own words gathered from letters and journals about the
experience of helping to settle the West. (A full display opens July
25 at the Skirball Cultural Center.)</TE>
<TE>   Also highlighted, in a book curators call "riveting," is the true
story of pioneer Rachel Colof, "Jewish Homesteaders on the Northern
Plains" (Indiana Press).</TE>
<TE>   The Autry exhibit is controversial, its curators say, more for
what it does not tackle in depth than for what it does. The matter of
crypto-Jews, also called conversos, for example, is touched only
lightly.</TE>
<TE>   "Jews have actually been in the American West since the 16th
century, when they, along with Muslims and all other non-Catholics
were expelled from Spain," Hackleman says. Many of these conversos
came to what was then called New Spain (which became Mexico in 1821).
The inquisition followed them there, and some converted to
Catholicism rather than be forced to find a new homeland, she adds.
It is believed by some that the conversos then moved North into what
is now Texas, New Mexico, Arizona. From there, they spread across the
West. Now, more than 500 years and 20 generations later, a strong
movement has emerged among some of these Catholics to discover their
roots. And an opposing movement, equally strong, has developed among
those not interested in such investigations.</TE>
<TE>   A document from the Bloom Southwest Jewish Archives at the
University of Arizona warns, before launching into documentation
gathered on conversos, that "no names are used because of
sensitivities within Hispanic families. Some want to search out their
roots, but in the same family there are those who either are
indifferent or antagonistic and do not want to know of a different
historic past."</TE>
<TE>   Says Hackleman, "Scholars are still debating all of this, and many
crypto-Jews refuse to speak publicly on the subject." Flavio Montoya,
who is identified as a crypto-Jew from Los Angeles, allowed his name
and photo to be used at the exhibit. But curators were hesitant to
discuss him. It is a very delicate issue, they explained. Montoya is
out of the country at a converso conference in Portugal and could not
be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Museum managing curator Michael Duchemin says the Autry has
offered a series of exhibits since 1993, highlighting contributions
of various groups to the development of America's West: Native
Americans, Mexican Americans, African Americans and Chinese Americans
have each been given individual exhibits. "Now it's the Jewish
American's turn," he said. "And the magic of this one is that it
pulls together all these local stories into one big picture" of how
this group assisted in the development of the West.</TE>
<TE>   "We drew on 77 different collections, some private, some from
museums and historical societies, from the Smithsonian Institution,
the Library of Congress and the National Archives.</TE>
<TE>   Major sponsors of the Autry exhibit, which runs through January,
are Wells Fargo bank and Steven Spielberg's Righteous Person's
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Of course the real coup in an era such as this might be to pull
together in one exhibition the intertwined stories of all these
various ethnic and religious groups that worked together--largely
without animosity--to create one of the most spectacular and diverse
societies in the modern world.</TE>

<HD>Feisty Memo to Gay Right: Don't Forget Your Liberal Past</HD>
<DH>THE ATTACK QUEERS: Liberal Society and the Gay Right. By
Richard Goldstein, Verso Books, 144 pages, $22</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MERLE RUBIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oscar Wilde, whose name became a byword for homosexuality, was also
famed as a champion of "art for art's sake" and the author of
sparkling drawing-room comedies. But how many people know that this
paradigm of wit and elegance also revealed himself as a member of the
permanent left in his thoughtful essay "The Soul of Man Under
Socialism"?</LD>
<LD>   Before Wilde, there was Walt Whitman, who saw love between men as
part of a broader kind of democratic love for humanity.</LD>
<LD>   On a more mundane level, as we also learn from Richard Goldstein's
new book, "The Attack Queers," Harry Hay, founder of one of America's
first organizations for homosexuals, the Mattachine Society, was a
communist.</LD>
<TE>   Reminding his fellow members of the gay community of their leftist
heritage, from Wilde and Whitman to Stonewall and Harvey Milk, is one
of the avowed goals of columnist, author and Village Voice editor
Goldstein in this feisty new polemic.</TE>
<TE>   What's got Goldstein's dander up is the emergence of certain gay
conservatives as veritable superstars in the mainstream media.</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein dubs them "homocons," short for homosexual
conservatives, but suggesting also, perhaps, that their goals are
homogeneity and conformity.</TE>
<TE>   He also calls them "the attack queers" because their role, he
claims, is to do for the self-styled "liberal" mainstream media what
the media dare not do for themselves: express hostility toward gays.</TE>
<TE>   The homocon agenda, Goldstein warns, is to divert the political
allegiance of gays from the left to the right.</TE>
<TE>   Although homocons style themselves as nonconformist dissenters
from the politically correct groupthink of left-wing gays and
lesbians, Goldstein believes that what they actually admire and
promote is conformity to a patriarchal, masculinist value system.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Goldstein's chief bugbears are Andrew Sullivan and Camille
Paglia, and he does a good job of exposing the dangers and glaring
inconsistencies in the stands they have taken on a variety of issues.</TE>
<TE>   The popular appeal of Paglia's message, he contends, is
essentially pornographic: " 'How come we can't allow that a lot of
these battered wives like the kind of sex they are getting?' " he
quotes her as asking.</TE>
<TE>   Women who show up at shelters clearly don't crave abuse, Goldstein
reminds us, "but to mention this obvious fact is to intrude on the
romance of the down and dirty that Paglia makes of working-class
life." Goldstein deplores the way that Paglia, like Sullivan,
identifies with the masculinist worldview of the aggressor.</TE>
<TE>   Skewering homocons by quoting from their work is a technique at
which Goldstein excels, and Paglia's flashy statements serve him
well:</TE>
<TE>   " 'Every time I cross a bridge,' " says Paglia, " 'I think, 'Men
made that.' "</TE>
<TE>   "Here," Goldstein notes, "is a typical Paglia apercu in support of
the claim that male power is a force for good. Of course, it's easy
to turn that testimonial on its head, as in 'Every time I visit a
museum of the Holocaust, I think, 'Men did that.' "</TE>
<TE>   In examining the question of who becomes a media star and who does
not, Goldstein touches on an issue that extends beyond the phenomenon
of "attack queers."</TE>
<TE>   He draws an interesting contrast between "attack queers" such as
Paglia, Sullivan and Norah Vincent, on the one hand, and other
conservative gay figures such as Bruce Bawer and Jonathan Capehart,
who present their ideas reasonably and thoughtfully, without spewing
venom at drag queens, transsexuals and other marginal types.</TE>
<TE>   Because writers such as Bawer and Capehart are "critical rather
than contemptuous," remarks Goldstein acidly, they aren't "ready for
prime time." Anyone who's ever deplored the proliferation of cheap
name-calling and the corresponding paucity of rational discourse in
the mainstream media will be struck by the justice of Goldstein's
observation.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to attacking "attack queers," Goldstein explains and
defends some of the goals of what he calls "progressive" and
"radical" advocates of sexual diversity, tolerance and civil rights.
Some of his arguments are more persuasive than others.</TE>
<TE>   To begin with, his terminology can be problematic, such as his use
of that much-beleaguered word "liberal."</TE>
<TE>   To many on the right, "liberal" means pretty much anyone who is
anywhere to the left of them, be it a moderate Republican, a centrist
Democrat, an environmentalist, a labor union organizer or a Social
Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   To self-styled "radicals," however, the "liberal" is either a
leftist unwilling to go far enough fast enough or, worse yet, the
enemy.</TE>
<TE>   When Goldstein blasts the "liberal" media, he can sound
disconcertingly similar to voices on the far right, most of whom
would classify him as a liberal.</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein's only expressed reaction to the events of last
September and the terrorist threat is to worry that this might overly
"masculinize" our culture.</TE>
<TE>   (Not a word about the infinitely greater dangers posed by the even
more extreme "masculinism" of the terrorist groups and what they
stand for.)</TE>
<TE>   And when it comes to tackling thorny issues such as identity
politics versus assimilation, Goldstein tends to underestimate the
extent to which there are some genuine liberals whose concern about
the growth of identity group politics is not simply a disguised form
of backlash against women, gays and other groups.</TE>
<TE>   Still, none of this invalidates his case for equal rights for gays
and for a more open-minded approach to questions of gender identity.</TE>
<TE>   He has packed a great deal of sound argument, sharp wit and
heartfelt idealism into a concise, very readable book.</TE>

<HD>Diplomatic Community</HD>
<DH>L.A. was once the place consuls came before retiring. Those
days are over.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stepping out onto the wide green lawn behind the Getty House, Los
Angeles Mayor James Hahn looked shellshocked. He had just spent
several grueling hours in what would soon be proved a vain attempt to
keep the secession of the San Fernando Valley off November's ballot.
Then he got stuck in traffic, so he was a half hour late to his own
party.</LD>
<LD>   But in a way, this particular party was the perfect ending to an
imperfect day. Because the guests helping themselves to turkey
burgers and Chinese chicken salad in the mayoral backyard were the
city's foreign diplomats and it would be difficult to find a bigger
group of L.A. boosters not wearing Laker colors.</LD>
<LD>   "This is where it all happens--industry, style, film, high
tech--it all begins in California," said Colin Robertson, consul
general of Canada. "This is one of the most important cities in the
world."</LD>
<TE>   "This is the most international city in the world," said Luis
Kreckler, the consul general of Argentina who was recently named dean
of the corps. "There is no other place like this anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly such words were balm for the mayor's soul, but beyond
the enthusiasm that might be expected from a diplomat for his host
city, these sentiments and the assembly in which they are spoken,
symbolize how the world has come to think of L.A. The city's consular
corps has changed, just as the city has changed.</TE>
<TE>   Just 10 years ago, Los Angeles was considered by many members of
the international diplomatic corps as a "retirement post," a place to
enjoy the sunshine, improve one's tennis game and perhaps coax
celebrities into appearing at celebrations. Here, career diplomats
could rest up, get a nice tan before being pensioned out.</TE>
<TE>   One look at the group gathered at the Getty--men and women in the
prime of their careers--makes it clear that this has changed. Those
posted to L.A. these days are senior enough to handle what is an
assignment on par with heading an embassy--many are, in fact,
ambassadors--but young enough still to be hungry for action, for
currying trade and tourism, for alerting the home office about trends
in everything from footwear to tax assessment. Young enough to want
to redefine diplomacy and to do it in the city they realize is on the
vanguard of just about everything.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, Los Angeles had fewer consulates than San Francisco
and Chicago. Now, with 86 career and honorary consul generals, L.A.
trails only Washington, D.C., and New York. But while in the latter
two cities a large diplomatic community is virtually a
requirement--what with Embassy Row in Washington and the United
Nations in New York--the community in L.A. has grown because a
variety of foreign governments sees the West Coast as the center of
the new economy and L.A. as the center of the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Industry, Technology</TE>
<TE>   "We are indeed a gateway city," Hahn told the diplomats as evening
fell. "To the Pacific Rim, to Asia, to Mexico and Central and South
America. But now in the age of the Internet, we are also a gateway,
through industry and technology, to Europe, to the world."</TE>
<TE>   "It is now one of the Top 10 postings in the world," said Elga
Sharpe, director of protocol for Hahn. "The economy is booming; it's
a diverse community and that makes it interesting. The diplomats here
are very senior, many are ambassadors. They come here to see how we
do business."</TE>
<TE>   And to see what the world of the 21st century might look like.
According to census data, almost 40% of people living in Los Angeles
are foreign born. As the leader of the corps, Kreckler wants to raise
awareness and understanding of his job and that of his colleagues,
and in doing so make even native Angelenos more appreciative of the
role this city will play--is playing--in the new economy.</TE>
<TE>   "People think we are all about protocol, about parties and dinners
and issuing visas," Kreckler said. "But we are doing business;
diplomacy now is business and that is especially true in Los
Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson describes what he does as a new diplomacy for a new
economy--the job is less about image and more about real connection.
"We are really post-political diplomats," he said. "Politics doesn't
matter as much as regulation, who's in office doesn't matter as much
as who's running the companies."</TE>
<TE>   The recent growth of the corps in Los Angeles is especially
striking since it occurred during a decade of budgetary streamlining
and new standards of bottom-line justification in the diplomatic
corps worldwide. Gone are any echoes of the Graham Greene consulate,
open three days a week from 1 to 4, when diplomats conducted their
business on the tennis court or over a gin and tonic, and reserved
their charm for visiting dignitaries.</TE>
<TE>   Now, members of the foreign service say almost to a person that
their governments want to know exactly what they're up to--how many
citizens are being served, how many foreign trade groups have been
hosted, how many deals have materialized and what it means in
dollars, or yen, or dinars.</TE>
<TE>   In this era of bottom-line diplomacy, the placement of consulates
has become more strategic, and when forced to choose between a
mission in Chicago, San Francisco or Los Angeles, most countries are
now choosing L.A.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, Pakistan had one in San Francisco; it closed because
of budgetary reasons and reopened in 1992 in Los Angeles. Partly,
said Consul General Raana Mumtaz Rahim, because the Pakistani
population of L.A. had grown so much, but also because this city is
now seen as a cultural and economic center--there are more Pakistani
citizens in Houston but there was no talk of opening a consulate
there.</TE>
<TE>   A Sociopolitical Model</TE>
<TE>   The sheer size of California, the breadth of its industry and the
ethnic diversity of Los Angeles make it a perfect sociopolitical
model for just about every nation, for just about every issue. Ward
Beysen, a Belgian member of the European parliament and its energy
committee, for example, was recently in town to learn as much as he
could about the state's energy infrastructure. As the European Union
looks toward deregulation, California is the only place complex
enough to be helpful at all. "Of course, we hope to avoid the, er,
difficulties you faced last year," Beysen said. "This is what we are
learning from, your successes and your mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   That same week, a parliamentarian from Siberia grilled L.A. County
officials about how the budget worked. Since the breakup of the
Soviet Union, the county has had representatives from many of the
emerging nations combing through real estate assessment formulas,
watching tax collection at work, photocopying voter registration
forms.</TE>
<TE>   As with Los Angeles, it is difficult to describe the nature of the
city's consular corps; the word "diverse" doesn't begin to cover it.
The majority in the corps are career diplomats, with offices (an
inordinate number of which are on Wilshire Boulevard) and residences
(many of which are clustered in Hancock Park, Westwood and
Brentwood), and they usually stay at a post no longer than four
years.</TE>
<TE>   But 33 serve as honorary diplomats, U.S. citizens who have been
appointed by a foreign government. For these, the position is unpaid
and the duties are often curtailed versions of an accredited
diplomat, but the appointment is for life and includes invitations to
more cocktail parties and luncheons than the average American will
ever see.</TE>
<TE>   Links to Industry</TE>
<TE>   Often, they are nationals of the country they represent, but
sometimes they are links to the specific industries the appointing
country wishes to cultivate. In 1999 Monaco appointed Dick Wolf, a
well-known television producer, as its honorary consul general.</TE>
<TE>   "Monaco had really cut back on its presence abroad," said Ginger
Barnard, deputy director of protocol for the county. "Their
appointments became very strategic--they wanted a direct link to the
industry."</TE>
<TE>   Many of a consulate's duties remain traditional. As described by
the 1963 Geneva Convention on consular duties, the top priority of
all foreign missions is to care for its citizens, those Jamaicans or
Austrians who are living in Los Angeles. Consulates provide visas,
passports and other international ID, and oversee the recording of
births, deaths, marriages and divorces of nationals living in L.A.
Some consul generals perform marriages for their citizens. Likewise,
when a foreign citizen finds himself or herself detained by the
police, often the first phone call is to the consulate.</TE>
<TE>   Much of how consul generals spend their time, therefore, depends
on the nature and number of the community they serve. For Mexico, Los
Angeles has never been anything like a retirement post. Martha Lara,
the current consul general, has essentially the job of a governor.
The Mexican consulate in Los Angeles is the largest foreign mission
in the world. Overseeing the lives of more than 3 million Mexicans
living in California, Lara has a larger constituency than the mayor
of L.A., and her duties are more diverse.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen hundred of those whom she calls "my people" come through
the consulate doors every day in search of temporary identification
cards and visas. Lara receives three or four Mexican dignitaries
every month, opens businesses, crowns community queens, attempts to
thwart scams targeting immigrants, aids the imprisoned, the evicted,
the unemployed, the dying.</TE>
<TE>   "Me, I do not have time to go to parties," she said. "We behave
more like an embassy because we have important political activity
that many other consulates do not have. Our relationship with Los
Angeles sets us completely apart." Other Latin American consul
generals similarly find much of their time and resources going to
immigration issues and the immediate needs of their people and less
to courting production companies to shoot in their capitals.</TE>
<TE>   But for Austrian Consul General Peter Launsky-Tieffenthal and many
of his European counterparts whose constituencies are relatively
settled, cultural exchange, business opportunities and world
technology are the centerpieces of a posting in L.A. "The minister of
home affairs and finance have been here recently; we have steady flow
of decision makers here and in Sacramento," Launsky-Tieffenthal said.
"We are trying to identify issues [the two cities] can work together
on--urban transportation, environmental concerns, inner-city
revitalization, these are all things we are dealing with in Vienna as
well."</TE>
<TE>   Tinseltown Ties</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood remains a big draw for many countries--Canada's
Robertson and his staff unapologetically court production companies.
"I do not see it as trying to take business away from the U.S.," he
said with a shrug. "I am trying to bring business to Canada."</TE>
<TE>   He also spends a good deal of time trying to bring people to
Canada. In L.A. and especially the Silicon Valley, the consulate
often sponsors immigration fairs, offering Canadian citizenship to
those in the U.S. on student or work visas. "This way they can still
be in the North American space," Robertson said.  Even beyond the
disparate nature of their mandates, the term "diplomatic community"
is a bit misleading in L.A. Although some diplomats spend more time
socializing with their colleagues than others--one could fill a
calendar with consulate events, and some folks do--most agree that
the L.A. community is far less insular than in other places,
including New York.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of that is due to the nature of the city--a friendly
government and accessible business representatives are not the norm
in some smaller or less-developed countries. But the nature of the
work here also affects the diplomatic social calendar. Where once
there were large parties, there are now selective dinners and
luncheons; where once the standard guest list was largely foreign,
now it is largely native.</TE>
<TE>   "Compared with other countries, I spend very little time with
other consuls," Launsky-Tieffenthal said. "I spend most of my time
with Americans. Which is what I am here to do after all."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the corps remains a society with an air of romance, of
intrigue. Turkey's Aykut Berk tells of having Fidel Castro over to
dinner during his posting in Cuba. George Chilingar, honorary consul
of Honduras, speaks of his days in Iran during the last days of the
Shah. Spain's consul general, Jose Luis Ballester, explains that he
joined the foreign service mainly because he loved Spain but could
not live under Franco.</TE>
<TE>   But so many people living in Los Angeles have come from far away,
have seen international turmoil and war, that diplomats don't stick
out as much as they might in other places. And this, more than the
movie stars, though perhaps not as much as the weather, is one of the
most appreciated facets of a posting to this city.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone has so many of their people here," Ballester said. "You
get to experience America, but America with your country too."</TE>

<LD>Jaguarundis</LD>
<LD>   Some wildcats look like super-sized versions of housecats, but
jaguarundis are shaped so differently they don't look like they
belong in the cat family at all.</LD>
<LD>   Jaguarundis are small cats that are found in the wild in South and
Central America, and even in the southern United States along the Rio
Grande River. They only weigh about 6 to 15 pounds full-grown.</LD>
<TE>   Another name for them is the otter-cat. Many people also think
they resemble weasels. Their bodies are long and sleek. They have
short legs and flattened tails. Their small heads are elongated
compared to the round heads of other small American cats. Their fur
is solid colored, with no markings on the legs, belly or ears--very
unusual among wildcat species. Their fur can be brown, gray or
reddish.</TE>
<TE>   Jaguarundis are more active during the day than other wildcats.
They like to eat rodents, birds or fish. Unfortunately, there are
fewer and fewer places for them to live and their numbers are
declining in the wild.</TE>
<TE>   The Exotic Feline Breeding Compound's Feline Conservation Center
in Rosamond is home to a jaguarundi. You can see and learn more about
this cat and many other wild felines by visiting the center or by
going to its Web site at www.cathouse-fcc.org. Center hours are 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. Thursday through Tuesday. For more information, call
(661) 256-3793 or (661) 256-3332 for recorded directions.</TE>

<TE>   by Gary Paulsen</TE>
<TE>   This book was about a boy named Francis. In 1848, he was on a
wagon train to Oregon with his family. He got captured by the Pawnee
Indians. While he was at the Pawnee village a white man, Mr. Grimes,
helped him escape. Mr. Grimes and Francis traveled together by horse
in the Plains. They got along well and became friends. Mr. Grimes
taught Francis how to survive on the Plains. Francis learned how to
ride a horse and use a rifle. Mr. Grimes was hurt by the Pawnee
Indians.</TE>
<TE>   I liked this book very much because I learned about what it was
like back then and how to survive. It was a hard time to live.</TE>

<HD>Swarmed by Her Novel's Early Buzz</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RENEE TAWA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of course, 39-year-old Alice Sebold knows that the hyper-buzz about
her debut novel is positioning her as the latest literary shooting
star. And that her book is taking off, with velocity. But at home in
Long Beach, with her husband and dog, Sebold still is back in that
place where it's a kick to think that "The Lovely Bones" (Little,
Brown) is even being published.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Sebold is trying to get used to the odd, un-writerly orbit of
widespread recognition. Her book--lavished with praise from key
critics--zipped to a No. 1 ranking on Amazon.com last week and is in
its sixth printing. Entertainment Weekly recently dropped by for a
photo shoot. Film rights have been optioned, foreign rights wrapped
up in eight countries. And the official publication date? July 3.
(The book is scheduled to arrive in stores this week.)</LD>
<LD>   "I have to say, it's unreal because the book isn't even out yet
... " Sebold said. "You feel a little like whispering in a
graveyard."</LD>
<TE>   So how did "The Lovely Bones" break away from the pack? (A record
135,000 books were published last year in the U.S., where a new book
comes into print nearly every four seconds, according to R.R. Bowker,
an industry tracking company.)</TE>
<TE>   It's easier to trace the trajectory of an early buzz if you're a
first-time novelist who nailed a $4.2-million advance, the way Yale
law professor Stephen L. Carter did for "The Emperor of Ocean Park"
(Knopf). Or if Oprah Winfrey taps your first novel for her old book
club, the way she did last year with Gwyn Hyman Rubio's "Icy Sparks"
(Penguin).</TE>
<TE>   But Sebold is a relatively unknown writer, and "The Lovely Bones"
had no such launch. In fact, she acknowledged, the book is hard to
describe, let alone pitch. Not that she worried a second about the
marketing, said Sebold, who received a master's degree from UC
Irvine's highly regarded creative writing program in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're writing a book about a dead girl from heaven," she
noted dryly, "you don't really expect they're going to publish it,
so...."</TE>
<TE>   Sebold began writing "The Lovely Bones" at Irvine. The novel is
written in the voice of 14-year-old Susie Salmon, who has been raped
and murdered by a neighbor. From heaven, which turns out to be a cool
place with a ton of romping dogs, she tracks her family, friends and
others through the aftermath of her death. "The novel is an elegy,"
wrote New York Times book critic Michiko Kakutani, "about a
vanquished place and time and the loss of childhood innocence. And it
is also a deeply affected meditation."</TE>
<TE>   Word about "The Lovely Bones" began to spread early last year in
the New York offices of Little, Brown after an editor read Sebold's
partial manuscript. The editor talked up the book, and the manuscript
got passed around. "Everybody read it, everybody adored it, and
everybody wanted to make it fly," associate publisher Sophie Cottrell
said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the passionate backers were the sales director and her
staff, who gave booksellers an early heads-up. A few influential
readers, including the fiction buyer for Barnes &amp; Noble, got hold of
a partial manuscript and became fans. Little, Brown then distributed
3,000 advance copies to key booksellers and contacts. (By comparison,
Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux had distributed 3,500 early copies for
Jonathan Franzen's bestseller, "The Corrections," one of last year's
most hyped and acclaimed books.) The reaction was quick and
passionate. Booksellers started reservation lists.</TE>
<TE>   Sebold's editor, publisher Michael Pietsch, heard from one of his
sales representatives that a rival Random House colleague was telling
his clients to read "The Lovely Bones." "That kind of thing kept
happening and happening after our sales force went wild," said
Pietsch, the noted editor of David Foster Wallace's "Infinite Jest."</TE>
<TE>   Sebold's book is a "breathtaking accomplishment," Pietsch said,
and he wanted to speed it into the hands of readers. "The marketing
plan was not a shove-it-down-the-throat campaign," he said. "We
wanted people to fall in love with the book itself. The campaign was
about creating word of mouth."</TE>
<TE>   National ads were placed. Seventeen magazine signed up for first
serial rights. And in early May, the marketing staff sent Sebold to
the BookExpo America in New York, the annual buzz-making publishing
convention.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Sebold arrived at BookExpo, demand for "The Lovely
Bones" was so great that Little, Brown reprinted galleys for the
first time. To Sebold's amazement, people lined up to get their
copies signed. "I mean, the fact that I was even there at all"
astonished her, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, Anna Quindlen, in a "Today Show" piece on summer
reading, said of "The Lovely Bones": "It's one of the best novels
that I've read in years," and the buzz crossed over into the
mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   Little, Brown had ordered an initial run of 50,000, which is big
for a first-time novel; the total now is up to 225,000 copies
(Sebold's first book sold fewer than 11,000 copies). In West
Hollywood, an advance copy that arrived at Book Soup months ago still
is being passed on from employee to employee, said Jennifer Ramos,
the store's publicity director. "The story itself, when you're trying
to describe it, you open it up by saying a girl is murdered, and it
would turn people off. It's really one of those things where, by
reading it, it captures you."</TE>
<TE>   The buzz is just that, said Sebold, a kind of ephemeral bubble. "I
mean, any early reviews are great," she said, "and they're very
confirming for me, but the [general] readers are the ones who will
either like the book or not like the book."</TE>
<TE>   On July 9, she'll get her first take on reader reaction during a
12-city national book tour, the concept of which is just sinking in.
For her first book, "Lucky" (Scribner, 1999), a memoir chronicling
her rape at age 18, her publisher flew her to San Francisco for book
signings; Sebold paid the hotel costs. Sebold also picked up her own
tab for a flight to New York City, where she stayed with a friend,
and another friend hosted a reading for her.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that she'll be taking 16 flights in three weeks this
time. Take out the hoopla, she said, and her life is the same.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to change where I live or who I love or what I
read and all that stuff, so in those basic ways, which are the
essential ways, things aren't going to change."</TE>

<LD>Everyone in our house is excited--Mom, Dad, my big sister, Kate, and
me. Of course, Grandma and Grandpa are too--even though they don't
live in our house but over on Corrigan Street. They're coming over
later.</LD>
<LD>   Kate is in a total flap. It's graduation day at Monroe High
School, and she's graduating.</LD>
<LD>   I'm happy for her. But there is something else today that is
making me even happier. Kate knows, and she doesn't mind.</LD>
<TE>   Mom wanted her to wear a pretty dress, but Kate said, "Forget it,
Mom! Everyone is going to be in jeans and T-shirts." At least Mom was
able to talk her into wearing a nice new top instead of her usual
ratty one, which I guess is trendy. Her gown and mortarboard with the
tassel are ready, too.</TE>
<TE>   I have a new pink turtleneck and a navy jumper. For some reason, I
feel like a bridesmaid.</TE>
<TE>   We're having a party at our house afterward. Lots of Kate's
friends are coming and two of my aunts and a bunch of cousins.
There'll be family, friends and Grandma and Grandpa, of course.</TE>
<TE>   There are chips and dips and little sausages on sticks that we'll
heat when the time comes, a veggie platter and two kinds of punch.
Grandma is baking a cake and bringing it over.</TE>
<TE>   "Your special chocolate one with the cream-cheese filling?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely." Grandma bites her lip. "Unless ... unless I get too
jittery to make it."</TE>
<TE>   "You won't," I tell her. "I have confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Upstairs, Kate is getting ready while Mom and I put the finishing
touches on the table. Everything is going fine. Mom is getting the
sausages ready. Our dog, Buster, is up on his back legs, making these
little leaps, trying to get to them.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily, we stop him in time.</TE>
<TE>   Dad comes home early, and Mom and I go upstairs to get dressed.</TE>
<TE>   The special day has started.</TE>

<LD>El Teatro Campesino, a grass-roots Chicano theater that emerged as an
arm of the farm workers' struggle of 1965, inspired numerous other
Chicano and Chicana theater troupes to blossom in the western United
States, particularly in the Southwest. By the early 1970s, the
individual teatros began to band together to plan major festivals in
the United States and Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA theater professor Jose Luis was part of that movement--and
wants a new generation of students to experience the same sense of
urgency he felt as a young member of a burgeoning political art form.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt like my theater was always so relevant to the times, to
society; we were trying to find a new form and style to speak to the
people," Luis says. "I felt that young people were not in that frame
of mind now. I wanted them to do the plays that we did, bring them
together with the writers who wrote those plays when they were in
their 20s, to see what role the theater played for us."</LD>
<TE>   Along with UC San Diego professor Jorge Huerta, Luis gathered a
consortium of college and university theater groups to participate in
the five-day Festival of Chicano Theater Classics, beginning Tuesday
at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Events include theater workshops such as "Street Theater" and
"Theater of the Oppressed," panel discussions with scholars and
critics, and performances of theater pieces from the era by the 250
student participants. The festival also features a closing-night
performance by a new incarnation of El Teatro Campesino, directed by
Kinan Valdez, son of Luis Valdez, founder of the original troupe.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The names on the bill for Saturday's "Walk Down Abbey Road" concert
at the Greek Theatre--Todd Rundgren, Alan Parsons, Jack Bruce, Mark
Farner and Christopher Cross--pose one key question: Is this the
priciest Beatles tribute band ever or what?</LD>
<LD>   There's no shortage of groups re-creating the Fab Four's hits in
lounges and bars around the world. But the "Walk Down Abbey Road"
lineup represents a first: pop and rock stars in their own right
saluting the hits of another group in an ongoing tour. "The
credibility is automatic given the caliber of musicians that are
participating," says Beatles authority Pete Howard, publisher of the
CD news magazine ICE. "This is several notches above
'Beatlemania'-type shows."</LD>
<LD>   Veteran producer and musician Parsons dreamed up the show and
toured for a limited number of dates last summer. This year, a
spokesman for Parsons says, "They're playing more shows and bigger
venues, so this is a nice step up." Case in point: The show stopped
at the 1,200-seat Grove of Anaheim last year but is at the 6,200-seat
Greek this year.</LD>
<TE>   Connoisseurs of fine print have noticed the disclaimer in ads for
the concert: "Not affiliated nor endorsed by the Beatles collectively
or individually or their affiliates."</TE>
<TE>   Says Howard, "Everybody knows how rightfully protective and
litigious the Beatle camp is.... So this is a good move by the
promoter to disarm that small percentage of ticket buyers who might
have thought it was endorsed by the Beatles. This puts everything on
top of the table and makes it all the more fun."</TE>
<TE>   It's not exclusively a Beatle-fest. Each participant also gets a
chance to play a few of his own hits. But the emphasis is clearly on
the lads from Liverpool.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody can throw together a band, call themselves the Liverpool
Moptops and sort of come up from the lower levels to do a Beatles
tribute," Howard says. "But this is a case of respected musicians
almost bowing down at the Beatles' feet.</TE>
<TE>   "Every decade that goes by, it becomes more obvious how important
the Beatles music was and how it influenced everybody who followed,"
adds Howard. "This is a nice combination of great music performed by
outstanding musicians from both the same era and subsequent eras, and
it's all in fun, which is as it should be."</TE>

<HD>BET Awards Add Star Power in Year 2</HD>

<LD>The first BET Awards last year were held in Bally's in Las Vegas and
were regarded with some uncertainty by African American industry
insiders who weren't quite sure what the ceremony had to offer. But
this year's BET Awards have moved past their growing pains and will
feature an all-star lineup during their Tuesday broadcast, which is
being shown live on the East Coast at 6 p.m. and on tape delay here
at 9 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   "People last year weren't quite sure what was going to happen,"
said Stephen Hill, BET's vice president of music programming and
talent. "Now everyone wants a ticket to come. Barry White has called
us, wanting tickets."</LD>
<LD>   Performers scheduled to appear include Janet Jackson, Will Smith,
P. Diddy, Mary J. Blige, Alicia Keys, Usher, Bow Wow and Vivica A.
Fox. The hosts are comedians Steve Harvey and Cedric "The
Entertainer."</LD>
<TE>   BET executives said the ceremony's live airing from the Kodak
Theatre in Hollywood gives the event an unpredictability and
freshness missing from other culturally oriented awards shows such as
the NAACP Image Awards and the Essence Awards, which are shown in
edited form days after the ceremonies.</TE>
<TE>   "We really have to hit it right the first time out," Hill said.
"There's also this sense of community, unlike other awards. We bring
together black artists from everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Award categories include best group, best actor and actress in a
film, male and female athlete of the year and best gospel artist.
Earth, Wind &amp; Fire is scheduled to receive a lifetime achievement
award, and Muhammad Ali will receive the Humanitarian Award.</TE>

<HD>Isaak, Merchant Showered With Bad Love--and Books</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Isaak isn't the usual tortured artist. He wears a powder-blue
suit covered in sequins. He tells good/bad jokes as dumb as they are
charming. He likes confetti. But somewhere within his shimmering,
whispery guitar songs is the torment of bad love.</LD>
<LD>   Isaak was most effective when that sound was deeply haunted Friday
at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre, where he co-headlined a concert
with Natalie Merchant. It is a tradition first mastered by Roy
Orbison, and only about half of Isaak's set truly reached that
smoldering intensity, epitomized by his own "Wicked Game."</LD>
<LD>   Friday also marked Isaak's first local appearance since drawing
new attention with his quirky TV series on Showtime, but the concert
was no different in mood and content from earlier tours. His best
subject remains what he called "unrequited love, which is when you're
not getting any. That's the French translation." Isaak and his
five-man band rocked things up on songs he promised would be "down in
the gutter." Among them was "Baby Did a Bad, Bad Thing," which had
the frontman grunting the title words, before crooning another
searing line of real heartbreak.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier, Merchant's set was emotional and controlled, but she
could be a rousing presence during "These Are the Days" (a song from
her time in 10,000 Maniacs) and other folk rock ballads of thoughtful
celebration. On the darker "This House Is on Fire," she sang to
mystical Eastern flourishes of violin and tabla, though the same song
sometimes slipped into a standard reggae groove.</TE>
<TE>   Fans sang along, and near the end of the set, one rushed the stage
not for the usual offering of a bouquet but to deliver a couple of
books. "These look really good," Merchant said, but she didn't stop
to read them.</TE>

<HD>Laughing All the Way Into Overtime</HD>
<DH>Movies* Making and promoting a basketball farce is a lark
for two members of the cast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRY ARMOUR</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Kim Wayans and Tommy Davidson are sitting at a table in Edna's, a
popular soul food restaurant on Chicago's West Side. Folks are
strolling in and out, showing them much love.</LD>
<LD>   Wayans and Davidson are eating it up.</LD>
<LD>   They pose for pictures. They sign autographs. They mingle with the
100 or so people who have joined them for breakfast on this rainy
Chicago morning as part of a radio promotion for the new movie
"Juwanna Mann," which opened Friday.</LD>
<TE>   "Sometimes you go back to Hollywood and you go to the networks and
they act like [black actors] are not even out there," Davidson says
while acknowledging a curious woman whose face is pressed against a
restaurant window. "But I walk into Edna's and everybody--from babies
to old people--knows who I am. I get to be a damn star for a while. I
can hardly get through the velvet rope at an 'N Sync concert, but
everybody here knows who the hell I am!"</TE>
<TE>   Both Davidson and Wayans, chatting during a much-needed coffee
break at Edna's, let out hearty laughs. They say they did a lot of
laughing and clowning around on the set of "Juwanna Mann," about a
brash NBA star (Miguel Nunez) who gets banned from the league but
resurfaces as a woman and plays in the WNBA.</TE>
<TE>   Hmmm. Sounds like the Bulls' former cross-dressing rebounding
machine, Dennis Rodman.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that I think about it, there is an element of Dennis Rodman
in the story," says Davidson, looking across the table at Wayans, who
nods in agreement. They both laugh.</TE>
<TE>   The two, who have known each other since they were part of the
cast of the in-your-face sketch comedy show "In Living Color," go
back and forth like this all morning. With Wayans egging him on,
Davidson explains that his over-the-top character in the
movie--street-hustling rapper Puff Smoky Smoke--is based on several
people he's come across during his life.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a combination of people I have grown up with, people I have
seen on music videos and people I have worked with," says Davidson,
who finishes his thought in his character's voice. "It's just that
'street genius.' He just swears he knows what he's talking about. You
can't tell him anything."</TE>
<TE>   And then there's Wayans' character, Latisha Jansen, a lesbian who
openly--and comically--drools over her teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Wayans has friends in the WNBA, including New York Liberty star
Teresa Witherspoon, who helped Wayans work on her basketball skills.
Does Wayans expect any negative feedback?</TE>
<TE>   "My character is a lesbian--that just happens to be who she is,"
Wayans responds. "Lesbians like women. I'm not saying all women in
the WNBA are lesbians. I didn't say that I was the poster child for
the WNBA or anything like that. I'm just being true to my character.
Kim Wayans has played an array of characters."</TE>
<TE>   Then, as if she catches herself being too serious, Wayans lightens
up.</TE>
<TE>   "If she sees a fine woman, she's going to mack on her," she says
while leaning forward in her chair. "And she likes the ladies."</TE>
<TE>   Wayans and Davidson are now unwinding in a private room at the
ESPN Zone on Ohio Street after another stop to promote "Juwanna
Mann." They've been up since 6 a.m., and eight hours later, they're
starting to hit a wall. But they're still talking, particularly
Davidson. He blames his adrenaline rush on the coffee; Wayans says
it's a combination of the coffee and Davidson.</TE>
<TE>   Wayans, who considers herself a big fan of the WNBA, says she has
noticed that the league is now pushing the feminine side of its
players in TV spots. She sees nothing wrong with it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a business," Wayans says. "Sex sells. They use
sex--half-dressed women--to sell toothpaste these days. Now, I'm not
going to make a judgment call on whether they should or should not do
it. But I understand the strategy behind it. If a little belly button
is going to get somebody to tune in to something really great that
they need to be seeing, more power to them."</TE>
<TE>   Wayans looks at Davidson and begins to break into a smile. Without
missing a beat, Davidson responds.</TE>
<TE>   "In every NBA commercial just put me in a G-string and let me do
my thing," Davidson says. "That will bring in some fans."</TE>
<TE>   They're both laughing again.</TE>

<HD>Shifting Sands of Ancient Art Law</HD>
<DH>Heritage* Courts are starting to favor national patrimony
over private property rights in the long-standing ownership rivalry
over antiquities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DONNA BRYSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>A lot has changed in the 15 years since a trove of ancient treasures
disappeared from a southern Egyptian warehouse.</LD>
<LD>   Courts around the world are beginning to recognize the ownership
claims Egypt and other nations make on what they see as their
cultural heritage, even when the claims are challenged by powerful
collectors and dealers who say they go against long-standing
assumptions about property rights.</LD>
<LD>   "Things are improving," says Torkom Demirjian, owner of Ariadne
Galleries in New York City and a 30-year veteran of the antiquities
trade. "My organization is pro-preservation. We don't like to
encourage clandestine digs. When we see something we believe is
stolen, we will report it to the proper authorities."</LD>
<TE>   Demirjian and other dealers use Art Loss Register, a company that
tracks stolen antiquities, to check items offered for sale.</TE>
<TE>   When a dealer in the Hague asked the London-based company what it
knew about an Egyptian relief he'd been offered, Art Loss found an
Interpol report in its computerized archives listing the statue as
stolen. It was part of the stolen warehouse trove--a 20-inch-tall
block of yellow stone with a carving of King Amenhotep III. The 18th
Dynasty pharaoh was depicted kneeling in profile, his toes splayed
like the petals of a lotus flower over a row of hieroglyphs.</TE>
<TE>   The statue was returned to Egypt in May.</TE>
<TE>   Art Loss didn't exist when the carving disappeared--the company
was formed in 1991 by auction houses, art dealer organizations,
insurers and a nonprofit art foundation. Julian Radcliffe, chairman
of the company, said he has seen a slow but perceptible increase in
interest in his pay-for-search service over the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Zahi Hawass, who holds the top archeological job in the Egyptian
government as chief of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, is digging
out descriptions of the other 54 pieces. Encouraged by the Amenhotep
discovery, he wants to circulate the descriptions among dealers and
museums.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge remains enormous, though. Interpol, the
international police network, says it is impossible to even track the
volume of trade in stolen antiquities because so much of it is so far
underground. Some pieces disappear straight from digs, before anyone
can catalog or describe them, and into the hands of collectors who
never risk showing them publicly.</TE>
<TE>   But many involved in the study and preservation--and the buying
and selling--of ancient art say that although the transformation is
likely to be slow and fitful, it has begun.</TE>
<TE>   In what often is portrayed as a clash of art and scholarship
versus commerce, those who deal in antiquities are cast in the
villain's role. The international art auction house Christie's
cautions that it's not that simple.</TE>
<TE>   "Private collections have often later become the core of public
museums, and in our own time, private collectors continue to donate
and lend pieces to museums. Most also allow access to the scholarly
community," Christie's said in a statement from its New York offices.</TE>
<TE>   There was a time, said Radcliffe of Art Loss, when virtually the
only interest of art collectors and dealers was whether a piece was
genuine. Questions about provenance--the trail of ownership--were
considered too complex to address or to be of concern.</TE>
<TE>   "They really couldn't have cared less who owned it," Radcliffe
said.</TE>
<TE>   Today they are being forced to care, partly because of the efforts
of government officials such as Egypt's Hawass, who argues that to
keep ancient art away from the country of its origin is "to destroy
the culture of a country."</TE>
<TE>   Hawass, well known in his previous position as the media-savvy
curator of the Sphinx and Great Pyramid complex outside Cairo, took
his new job in March with a characteristic splash. He sent letters to
museums around the world informing them that he was establishing a
central department to track missing antiquities.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect that your museum will be most circumspect when
acquiring any new ancient Egyptian pieces," he said in the letter.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the stern tone, Hawass said he doesn't expect a fight. "I
seek their help, and they will help," he said. "I believe they live,
as we do, to protect Egyptian monuments."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, archeologists and museum officials around the world have
been at the forefront of the campaign to focus attention on
ownership. They argue that because dealers and collectors once asked
so few questions, they encouraged tomb robbers who ripped objects out
of context and destroyed any chance that they could be properly
studied.</TE>
<TE>   Asking--and acting when the answers are unsatisfactory--could help
avoid embarrassing legal battles.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, U.S. Customs agents seized a delicately decorated gold
phial--a vessel used for pouring libations in the 4th century in what
is now Italy--that retired American financier Michael Steinhardt was
trying to bring home from Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Steinhardt had paid a Swiss dealer more than $1 million for the
object and on his customs forms listed Switzerland as the country of
origin.</TE>
<TE>   Italy argued that the phial instead originated in Italy and that
Italian antiquities law prohibited its export. In 2000, U.S.
officials returned the phial to Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Steinhardt had fought the seizure all the way to the U.S. Supreme
Court, arguing that he had purchased the phial in good faith and that
Italy's ban on exporting its antiquities should not be recognized by
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, New York art dealer Frederick Schultz was convicted
in federal court of plotting to smuggle a stolen bust out of Egypt.
He was sentenced June 12 to 33 months and fined $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   Schultz is appealing the conviction, which found that he plotted
to sell items removed from Egypt between 1990 and 1996, in violation
of a 1983 Egyptian law declaring antiquities not then in private
collections to be public property.</TE>
<TE>   Key to Schultz's conviction was whether Egyptian law could be used
to build the case that the bust was stolen. Critics say that laws
such as Egypt's--which decree that all antiquities belong to the
government and which are not uncommon in the developing world--are
anti-private property and should not be recognized by governments
with more liberal laws on buying and selling culture.</TE>
<TE>   The Archaeology Institute of America filed a friend of the court
brief in the United States versus Schultz urging the United States to
recognize foreign governments' claims on archeological objects.</TE>
<TE>   Such recognition "furthers the goals of historic preservation and
knowledge, and it represents the beliefs of the American people, who
value the world's cultural heritage," the institute argued.</TE>

<DH>Harald Belker creates a visionary world of life in the
ultra-fast lane for futuristic 'Minority Report'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID DAVIS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Steven Spielberg's "Minority Report," set in Washington, D.C.,
circa 2054, the cars offer a not-so-far-out peek into the automotive
future. They travel vertically as well as horizontally on a magnetic
track and feature video interaction via holographic projections and a
DNA recognition entry and ignition system.</LD>
<LD>   They're the vision of Harald Belker, who is fast becoming
Hollywood's go-to vehicle designer. He created the sleek, ominous
Batmobile for "Batman &amp; Robin" (1997), the whacked-out Lincoln
Continental for "Inspector Gadget" (1999) and the space shuttle in
"Armageddon" (1998). He also tricked out Vin Diesel's macho GTO for
the upcoming summer action movie "XXX."</LD>
<LD>   But souped-up and eye-catching as the cars might be, Belker
designs them to blend in with the rest of the movie. "I design
vehicles that stand out but are in character," he says. "They help
the feel of the film." With "Minority Report," which opened Friday.
Belker's automotive universe underscored the film's surreal yet
strangely familiar visual landscape.</LD>
<TE>   When Belker first heard about "Minority Report," loosely based on
a short story by sci-fi novelist Philip K. Dick, he sensed that the
project "was my ticket." Before production started, Spielberg
assembled a think tank of scientists, environmentalists, urban
planners and writers to create a vision of the future. The resulting
cinematic world merges present-day Washington, D.C.--including
traditional touchstones such as the Washington Monument--with
visionary technology, including a mass-transportation system that
operates via magnetic levitation.</TE>
<TE>   Belker collaborated with "Minority Report" production designer
Alex McDowell (Fight Club," "The Crow") to devise the intricacies of
the so-called Mag-Lev system. "A lot of designers draw up 'picture
vehicles' without thinking how the cars work," McDowell says. "Harald
designs from a real-world stance. He combines his knowledge of
mechanics to produce functional, aesthetic models."</TE>
<TE>   The Mag-Lev system transports brake- and wheel-less "pods" along a
vertical-horizontal roadway made of magnetic discs. Belker created
Tom Cruise's computer-controlled, voice-activated "pod" that zips
along the tracks accident-free. According to Spielberg, "The most
futuristic thing about the movie, and maybe the most science-fictiony
thing, is the look of the Mag-Lev systems."</TE>
<TE>   Says Belker: "The real problem was figuring out how to get a
vehicle from a flat surface to go vertical, along buildings. We
didn't want flying vehicles, like 'Blade Runner.' It had to make
sense, with form following function."</TE>
<TE>   McDowell says that they labored to avoid any comparisons with
Ridley Scott's groundbreaking sci-fi film, also based on a Dick
story. "When you're doing an urban-based future film, it's hard to
avoid 'Blade Runner' because it's always going to be a classic," he
says. "But 'Minority Report' goes in a different direction. It
imagines more of a utopian future in a green, non-post-apocalyptic
world."</TE>
<TE>   During production, Spielberg decided to add a twist in which
Cruise's character leaves the Mag-Lev, fleeing his pursuers by
driving to the country. Belker rejected the idea of a Mag-Lev pod
going "off system." Instead, working with McDowell, Belker sketched
out plans for another type of vehicle. He designed the so-called
"hero car"--a snazzy red two-seater coupe--in just three weeks. After
getting Spielberg's approval and running it by the designers at
Lexus' Southern California design studio--the car company's logo
appears on the vehicle--Belker turned it into reality.</TE>
<TE>   A computer converted the sketch into a 3-D model. CTEK, a Tustin
technology development company, used the prototype to build the
electric-powered car in four months. "The design came from a police
car I had done, an early model, with rugged wheels," he says. "I
integrated that into a sports car concept. It's very raw and
different in proportion."</TE>
<TE>   The car makes its first appearance when it emerges, with Cruise
inside, from the computer-activated factory that produces it. The
car's appearance is deceiving. Indeed, when Lexus began to display it
at car shows, the extreme cab-forward design fooled many observers.
"People say they don't know which way it goes," Belker says. "To me,
I always knew where it was going. The car always leaned forward, so
all the lines go forward."</TE>
<TE>   In imagining the future, Belker also created a "wow" car, one that
virtually drives itself. Among the features: laser-guided cruise
control, a carbon fiber and titanium composite chassis, retinal scan
entry and a weather-sensitive response system (with tire tractions
that adjust automatically to road conditions).</TE>
<TE>   When he drafted the voice-activated, computer-controlled system,
Belker curtailed the car's interior architecture. That left Cruise
with little to do, so Belker added screens and other doodads. "It's
funny--you think future, so you minimize everything," he says. "But I
forgot about the actors."</TE>
<TE>   Belker is vague about the cost of building the cars. "It was more
than $100,000 and less than $1 million," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Drawn to Auto Design</TE>
<TE>   Born and raised in Dusseldorf, Germany, Belker came to the United
States in 1984 on a tennis scholarship at Georgia Southern
University. A friend showed him a magazine article about automotive
design, and Belker's future was sealed. "We were always talking about
how cool it would be to design cars," he says. "I never thought you
could go to school for that."</TE>
<TE>   Belker, now 41, enrolled in Art Center College of Design in
Pasadena, graduating in 1990 with a degree in transportation design.
He then worked for Porsche in Germany, where he experienced "culture
shock," before deciding to return to Los Angeles. Mercedes-Benz hired
him for its Smart Car project at the company's advanced design studio
in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   After four years, Belker quit to freelance. "When you come out of
school, you think you can change the industry," he says. "It takes
about a year before you realize that you can do nothing. I didn't
want to become a manager; I just wanted to be the one who draws and
comes up with new ideas."</TE>
<TE>   Belker, who retains a slight German accent, talks in the airy
living room of the Santa Monica townhouse he shares with his wife.
Dressed in jeans and a gray T-shirt, he folds his 6-foot-7-inch frame
into one of two sleek chairs that he designed. His own two cars--a
Porsche Boxster and an Audi A6--are stored in the garage. "I like to
drive fast," he says, shrugging.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving Mercedes-Benz, Belker worked as a consultant for
several car manufacturers. In 1998, former Chrysler head Lee Iacocca
selected Belker to design an electric bicycle for his North
Hills-based company EV Global.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a difficult styling job because electric bikes have so
little room" for design elements, Iacocca recalled in an interview
last week. "Harald did wonders; he put together a slick, hot package
of industrial engineering."</TE>
<TE>   Belker enjoyed the project but left because sales for the bike
weren't taking off. Anyway, by then Belker sensed that his future was
in Hollywood. "Batman &amp; Robin" production designer Barbara Ling was
the first to call, hiring him for the fourth film in the series. He
designed the ice truck for Mr. Freeze (played by Arnold
Schwarzenegger), as well as the over-the-top Batmobile. "It was
lavish, the more outrageous the better," he says. "The whole thing
grew to 28 feet long, as a single-seater, and then the director added
big wings to the sides."</TE>
<TE>   The Freedom of Film</TE>
<TE>   After "Batman," he worked on "Armageddon," "Inspector Gadget,"
"Battlefield Earth" and "Spider-Man," joining a small cadre of car
designers who chose entertainment over engineering. "Working in film
allows the designers to be more creative and less pragmatic," says
Ron Hill, former chairman of Art Center's transportation design
department. "When you work for Porsche, your goal is to produce a
consumer product. In Hollywood, your goal is creative response
realized once."</TE>
<TE>   As he awaits the release of "XXX," Belker and McDowell are
beginning to collaborate on their next project: Dr. Seuss' "The Cat
in the Hat," starring Mike Myers and directed by Bo Welch.</TE>
<TE>   "In this case, the idea was to create the most stupid car you
could imagine," McDowell says. "It has to look silly, awkward,
nonaerodynamic. It goes against every grain in Harald's body."</TE>
<TE>   Belker says he's enjoying the crooked ride.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a straight pipe in Dr. Seuss," he says. "It's very
trippy and weird. That's what my world is like right now--all bent
out of shape."</TE>

<HD>On the Other Side of the Curtain Now</HD>
<DH>Students see themselves in a film about their school's
first play in 20 years</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SORINA DIACONESCU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The setting was a plush screening room inside the Directors Guild of
America building on the drizzly first morning of the Los Angeles Film
Festival, but the boisterous ambience was reminiscent of graduation
day.</LD>
<LD>   As soon as the lights died down, the screen and the audience
erupted simultaneously in dialogue with each other. "This is the
ghetto," came the soulful groan of the soundtrack, set against a
familiar backdrop of police cars, palm trees and scorched lawns.
Young viewers cheered and whooped in recognition. They were all
students and alumni of Compton's Dominguez High School who had come
to West Hollywood to watch their alma mater and their classmates in
the documentary "OT: our town," shown as part of the festival.</LD>
<TE>   Directed by Scott Hamilton Kennedy, "OT" tracks 24 students and
two teachers in their attempts to revive Thornton Wilder's
post-Depression classic "Our Town" on a makeshift stage in their high
school cafeteria. The documentary spans one month and 13 days of
rehearsals for Dominguez High School's first theatrical production in
20 years. It plays like a jazzed-up version of Ulysses' "Odyssey,"
with cast and co-directors forced to traverse cultural chasms and
scale seemingly insurmountable obstacles: a disconnect between the
play, originally set in Grover's Corners, a New Hampshire provincial
backwater, and the African American and Latino student population; an
initial lack of support from the school board; and a budget that
never inched above zero, in addition to such perils as gunshots that
went off in the night, even as the camera rolled.</TE>
<TE>   At the screening, audience members hollered in support as the
screen lighted up with a cast of characters straight out of
Compton--their Compton.</TE>
<TE>   Ebony Starr Norwood-Brown was 16 when she appeared in "OT" as
herself and as the play's narrator, the Stage Manager. "Sports is all
that matters at this school," she says in the documentary. "That's
right!" bellowed the audience back at the screen. "People say
Dominguez High is ghetto. But we're not all gangbangers and hoochie
mamas. We don't want to reiterate those stereotypes," Norwood-Brown
tells the camera. She reveals that her real mother is a prostitute
who dropped her off with a baby-sitter one day and never came back.
"Never, ever," she repeats, an incredulous smile on her lips. A
collective sigh floated from the audience, which turned quiet as
Norwood-Brown recited on screen one of her lines in the play: "Every
child born into this world is nature's attempt to make a perfect
human being."</TE>
<TE>   There was much laughter and delight at the sight of slides, family
mementos and baby pictures that the cast members brought in as props
and inspiration for the play. Archie Posada, whose character, George
Gibbs, gets married in the play, is shown donning the embroidered
Mexican outfit his own father wore at his wedding. "Some of the
things that we put in it--we gave it a life," Norwood-Brown says on
screen about "Our Town."</TE>
<TE>   But despite the hilarity in the audience, "they've been very proud
of 'OT, " director Hamilton Kennedy said after the screening. He
admitted to butterflies in anticipation of this audience's reactions.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Perez, who appears in the documentary as his 17-year-old self
and as Simon Stimson, the suicidal town drunk, saw "OT" for the first
time and loved it, despite the fact that he has since grown quite
different from the angst-ridden young man captured on film. "I've had
more than 15 people die on me in the last four years, and the last
one was my best friend," he says in "OT," which showed him sitting by
himself in a corner and thrashing about to the angry wails of rock
band Nine Inch Nails as if banging his head against an invisible
wall.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel that the part fit me well," he said at a
question-and-answer session with the audience after the screening.
"At the time I was bitter, jaded, and I related to the death scene
the most." Now 19, he displays a much sunnier disposition and
recently applied for a scholarship to study business in Germany. "I
never connected with anyone--except some friends --like that before;
the people in the play felt like a family," Perez said, beaming at
the handful of former "Our Town" actors who had joined him for the
screening.</TE>
<TE>   "Theater is a healing art that helps give people a voice," added
Karen Greene, one of the two English teachers who co-directed and was
"co-everything on the play." It was fellow teacher Catherine Borek
who in spring 2000 had the idea to stage Wilder's paean to the
importance of little things in life at the stageless Dominguez High
School because, she explained to the assembled crowd, the play
demanded no more than a few chairs in the way of a set. The idea to
commit the creative exercise to film was born when Borek met director
Hamilton Kennedy at a party; they ended up dating, falling in love
and nurturing "OT: our town" into being.</TE>
<TE>   Like the theater production it documents, the film was cobbled
together with hand-me-downs from previous projects and financed out
of the director's pocket. It premiered, fittingly, in the Dominguez
High School cafeteria and has been screened at the South by Southwest
film festival in Austin, Texas, and the Tribeca festival in New York
City. At last week's screening, the project gained the approval of a
tough hometown audience as Dominguez High School students clapped
wildly and held hands as the final sequences of "OT" cascaded on
screen along with the end credits.</TE>
<TE>   "We made 'Our Town' our little town," Borek says to the camera.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't all in vain," Norwood-Brown says. "We're not that
different, but we're way different than you think we are."</TE>
<TE>   And a voice from the audience announced with a celebratory shout:
"It's not only about basketball at Dominguez High anymore."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

Blvd., West Hollywood, (323) 848-3500.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A duo combination of saxophone and drums doesn't appear to hold much
promise for musical variation. But when the players are the versatile
English saxophonist-woodwind artist John Surman and drummer Jack
DeJohnette (known for his work with Miles Davis and, currently, the
Keith Jarrett Trio), the instrumentation--enhanced by additional
sounds--can produce impressive results.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday night at the Conga Room, DeJohnette's drum kit
included a variety of exotic percussion, and the piano, his second
instrument, was close by.</LD>
<LD>   Surman stood by a table holding a bass clarinet, a soprano
saxophone, a synth keyboard and more, and his primary horn, the
baritone saxophone, stood ready for action.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the pieces appeared to be improvisations, similar to those
included in the duo's just-released ECM album, "Invisible Nature."
But DeJohnette and Surman have been working together long enough to
have developed patterns, phrases and repetitions, most of which
emerged via a simple shift of emphasis from one or the other player.
And, although the results occasionally drifted into the totally open
universe of free jazz improvisation, most of the pieces were either
structured around familiar song forms or floated above a roiling
ostinato bottom.</TE>
<TE>   On one untitled work, for example, Surman played a fairly
non-specific harmonic pattern on his synth keyboard, then looped it
so it would continue to play by itself. He then laid out a melody on
his soprano saxophone, including a middle-section bridge that placed
the repeated harmonies in a different context, and--supported by
DeJohnette's funk-driven drumming--generated a foot-tapping,
hard-swinging set of choruses that had the moderate-sized audience
shouting its enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   When DeJohnette moved to the piano for a touching rendition of
John Coltrane's "After the Rain," the duo offered a vastly different,
equally appealing perspective on their intricate musical partnership.</TE>
<TE>   Each also offered superb individual solos. In his spotlight
outings, DeJohnette certified that he is the quintessential example
of a fully rounded musical drummer. And Surman, not as well known in
this country as he should be, brought a vivid blend of graceful
elegance and probing inventiveness to everything he played.</TE>

<HD>'POV' Has Vision to Focus on an Ordinary Family's Strength</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In headlines and all across television is the family of Elizabeth
Smart, the 14-year-old whose disappearance remains unsolved.</LD>
<LD>   Day after day, this family and police face a Maginot Line of
inquiring media who have made Elizabeth this season's JonBenet
Ramsey. Hour after hour, cable news channels update and rehash this
story, opening their hearts and lenses to another golden victim whose
parents have wealth and skin color matching that of nearly all the
hotshots who have dispatched these hordes to Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, similar tragedies besetting blacks, Latinos--and all of
the unwealthy--become media pit stops (when covered at all) and
remain as out of vogue in some circles as sound news judgment.</LD>
<TE>   High-toned novelist-journalist Dominick Dunne told CNN's Larry
King the other night that he wrote about the rich because he found
them more interesting than other Americans. At least he's honest.
Many in the media obviously share his infatuation, forgetting or not
caring that ordinary people ache just as deeply and regularly inspire
us with the heroism they display when facing adversity.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday night, for example, you'd do well to watch another
Mormon family hurting in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   A family not rich. A family not made famous by TV or
psychoanalyzed by talk radio's knee-jerk shrinks, but one every bit
as anguished as the Smarts. A family whose story is heartbreaking to
view, too stunning to miss.</TE>
<TE>   "This Christmas was terrible-wonderful," Kim Smith is heard saying
in 1999, because "we knew it was the last one."</TE>
<TE>   The last one for her husband, Steve--father of their two teenage
sons and a living cadaver in much of this tender, emotional,
unforgettable "POV" film by Tasha Oldham, though he's barely into
middle age.</TE>
<TE>   They were "a Cinderella family," says Steve's twin brother in "The
Smith Family" on PBS, a description affirmed by home movies of the
Smiths at play in happier days. They were also a churchgoing,
fresh-scrubbed poster family for Mormonism, resolute in their
commitment, devout and unswerving in their faith.</TE>
<TE>   Then, the crash.</TE>
<TE>   On their ninth anniversary, Steve confessed to Kim he'd had sex
with men. Three years later, she tested HIV-positive. Soon after,
Steve developed full-blown AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Although the odyssey on the screen is no less than tortuous--and
refutes church doctrine about homosexuality and the loopy notion of
it being a changeable "lifestyle"--this is much less about Mormonism
and AIDS than about the Smiths as a family.</TE>
<TE>   Kim: "I love this man, in spite of his weakness ... in spite of
his betrayal, in spite of all these things."</TE>
<TE>   As corny as that.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing trite about the Smiths, though. Nor about other
themes in this year's batch of independent small films on "POV"
(short for "point of view") as it launches its 15th season of
showcasing lower-budget, personalized works. The best of these make
up in raw storytelling virtue what they lack in elegance.</TE>
<TE>   Although some are more successful than others, each offers a
refreshing closeness to the pavement that rarely exists in the
loftier cosmic documentaries that PBS tends to favor.</TE>
<TE>   That's true in another upcoming "POV," the moving "Refrigerator
Mothers," as it recalls harm done by batty early researchers who
assumed that children became autistic when their moms treated them
coolly. And true in "Boomtown," an ironic take on Native Americans of
the Suquamish Nation near Seattle. They traditionally earn extra
money by selling Fourth of July fireworks that celebrate what their
leader, Bennie Armstrong, calls "the birth of a country that's been
oppressing the Indians."</TE>
<TE>   In a way, before he got sick, Steve Smith secretly straddled gay
and straight cultures in Utah just as Armstrong says the Suquamish
have lived in Washington for generations as "a country within a
country."</TE>
<TE>   Steve's deepest feelings about his wife, his church and his
homosexuality are captured with remarkable intimacy by Salt Lake
City-bred Oldham. As are Kim's feelings about him. And despite her
conflicting emotions about the man who gave her a potential death
sentence (her health today remains good), their moments together are
as sweet and loving as any you'll see.</TE>
<TE>   Oldham was just in her mid-20s, and making a documentary on the
lives of Mormon women in Utah, when she heard of the Smiths. After
meeting them, she decided to put aside what she was doing and instead
chronicle this family's journey through the last two years of Steve's
life.</TE>
<TE>   No cheap lumps in the throat here. No filmmaker pouncing on her
subjects with predatory close-ups and dishonest hankie shots designed
to make her audience sob. Instead, Oldham's access to intensely
private moments, and her restraint in capitalizing on that, speak
warmly for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   As do the film's devastating insights, from ravaged Steve's teary
guilt about infecting his "innocent" wife, to Kim's lingering anger
over his infidelity with men. In fact, with anyone. She's still "in
the process of trying to forgive him," Kim says in a wobbly voice.
She pauses to gather herself, then adds, "For what could have been."</TE>
<TE>   There are two reconciliations on the table, though. One is Steve's
with his family (the older Smith son, Tony, is much less forgiving of
his father here than is the younger, Parker). The other is Steve's
attempt to reconcile his sexuality with his religion, whose doctrine
on family and homosexuality weighs here on all of the Smiths.
Mormonism, Steve says, "does not make room for homosexuals."</TE>
<TE>   At one point, he believed that confessing he was gay to church
officials would end his "homosexual desire." Nonsense, of course. He
spent years trying to change, in fact, before concluding that his
homosexuality "could not be altered." Hoping to avoid
excommunication, he lied to the church, claiming he "was changed,
[but] I knew that I wasn't."</TE>
<TE>   Steve was excommunicated. He died a Mormon. Although feeling
"betrayed by the beliefs that I founded my life upon," Kim says late
in the film that she, too, remains Mormon "in my soul."</TE>
<TE>   Despite all that happens, her priority is keeping her family
together, and her strength is something to behold. In another of
those terrible-wonderful moments, Steve is nearing death and Tony is
leaving for a two-year church mission in Mexico as Kim prepares for
both "a funeral and a farewell." It's a juxtaposition you may never
see again.</TE>
<TE>   Before Steve dies, in a scene marking life's continuity with
death, the Smiths and their sons visit four plots in a cemetery where
someday they will rest together in the gray shadow of Utah's Wasatch
Mountain range.</TE>
<TE>   "Grew up beneath it," Kim says, "and buried beneath it."</TE>

<HD>CNN's New Star Format Put to the Test</HD>
<DH>Television* The network hopes Connie Chung, debuting
tonight, will shore up the personality approach--and ratings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Soon after Paula Zahn joined CNN in September, she was approached to
be profiled on Lifetime's celebrity biography show "Intimate
Portrait," a first for CNN. The news network moved up yet another
rung public relations-wise in January, when People magazine inquired
about who made the suit and shoes Connie Chung wore to the news
conference announcing she was jumping to CNN from ABC.</LD>
<LD>   As distressing as such fluff appears to some news purists at CNN,
for other executives, the attention is proof that the network has
arrived. Now, with "Connie Chung Tonight" finally launching today at
5 p.m., CNN just has to make the new star-driven format work.</LD>
<LD>   It's a departure for a network that for two decades built a brand
on disdaining personality, with a mantra that "news is the star." But
CNN has been a network in search of a focus for some time, as it has
slipped behind rival Fox News Channel in the ratings. Tapping into
corporate synergy with shows branded with other AOL Time Warner
properties, such as Time, People and Fortune magazines, didn't work.
Nor did an attempt to turn some previously buttoned-up CNN anchors
into chatty nighttime hosts. "The Spin Room," an attempt at opinion,
fizzled.</LD>
<TE>   So now CNN has returned to something in between, with a lineup of
anchors in key morning and evening time periods who have more
audience recognition but also network news polish. They don't shout,
except on the late-afternoon "Crossfire," but they do have
personalities.</TE>
<TE>   Chung, who is 55 and married to talk-show host Maury Povich, even
rated a new set in midtown Manhattan, with gleaming blond wood,
brushed steel, a smooth gray leather sofa and a sophisticated orange
and gray logo that's a far cry from the bare-bones look that has long
marked the network.</TE>
<TE>   At an estimated salary of more than $2 million per year, Chung
isn't CNN's highest-paid star; that distinction goes to the nearly
$7-million-a-year man Larry King, whose talk show has long led CNN's
ratings. But King is a home-grown talent, who came to CNN in 1985
when it was an upstart and he was a radio host. Chung, whose resume
includes sitting side by side at the "CBS Evening News" anchor desk
with Dan Rather, is clearly CNN's biggest journalistic hire ever.
It's a risk for her. She says the appeal of cable--where the
audiences are still much smaller than at a broadcast network and
where she'll work five nights per week--was "having my own program to
do as I please." And, she says, after mastering the network
newsmagazine formula, "I think I needed to wake up again and be
bright-eyed again."</TE>
<TE>   Zahn, a former CBS morning anchor, and Aaron Brown, an ABC News
anchor and reporter, paved the way last year for CNN's transition;
Zahn holding down CNN's morning and Brown following King at night. So
far, the results are mixed, with both shows improving in their time
periods but losing out to Fox News' edgier offerings.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, however, with the war on terrorism provoking more
audience interest in the news, CNN's 2002 viewership over the course
of a day is up more than 60% on average compared to a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   CNN executives say their task has been made easier by the route
chosen by Fox and third-place MSNBC, which is remolding its own
lineup to feature more political debate and loud opinion. "We become
crystal-clear in people's minds at this point," says Teya Ryan, CNN's
general manager. "The competition has so defined itself differently
from us." Her definition of CNN: "We don't talk about the news; we
gather the news."</TE>
<TE>   How Chung will fit in will become clearer when the show launches.
Her news credentials are strong: Since starting her career in 1969,
she's been a correspondent and anchor at each of the three network
news operations--CBS, NBC and ABC--as well as a local anchor at Los
Angeles' KCBS-TV for seven years. She's best known for her
high-profile interview "gets"--including Rep. Gary Condit (D-Ceres),
and some gaffes (a controversial interview with Newt Gingrich's
mother)--but many critics have said she's done some of her best work
out of the spotlight in recent years, including a multiple-award
winning report for ABC on the 1966 murder of a black Mississippi man.
Her public appeal remains high.</TE>
<TE>   The new show will be broken into three parts, leading with a
report and live interview related to the top news story of the day.
Chung says she wants to stay away from experts and focus on the
principals involved in a story. On a day, say, when sexual abuse in
the Catholic Church was the story: "We would aim for a victim or a
convicted pedophile priest, not get an expert on pedophilia." A
second topic will range from investigative to "gee whiz," she says,
followed by a third segment she won't explain in detail, except to
say the goal is to "not take ourselves so seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Chung says she wanted to distinguish the show from King's and
Brown's by focusing on "ordinary people in extraordinary
circumstances." But even though she's also competing against network
sitcoms and dramas in many parts of the country, the cable-news
competition alone will be intense, and Chung's show might ultimately
succeed or fail on her ability to book guests with their own name
recognition among viewers. On Fox, "The O'Reilly Report" is the
top-rated cable news show. MSNBC will counter her with a new show
from Phil Donahue on July 15.</TE>
<TE>   One worrying factor is the ratings of "Crossfire," the political
debate show that precedes Chung's show. In April, the program got new
hosts and a live audience and was expanded to an hour, but viewership
has dropped from earlier in the year. CNN says the show hasn't
dropped more than the overall network, as war news has cooled off.
"Do we have some work to do? Sure," Ryan says of the revamped
"Crossfire." "But I'm not ready to say it's a disappointment."</TE>
<TE>   The network is backing the Chung launch with a hard-core
promotional press, including a paid ad campaign and incessant on-air
promotions. A high-buzz party for Chung last week at New York's 21
Club drew a crowd of media heavyweights, including CBS President Les
Moonves, DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg, Fox News Chairman
Roger Ailes and three top executives from CNN parent AOL Time Warner:
Richard Parsons, Bob Pittman and Steve Case.</TE>
<TE>   But just in case they miss all the other hype, customers at some
2,000 Bank of America outlets on the West Coast in the last month
have been subjected to ATM-screen promotions for Chung, as they while
their time waiting for their money to appear.</TE>

<HD>A Voice for All Seasons, Characters</HD>
<DH>Movies* David Ogden Stiers has become the "go to" guy when
Disney has an animated challenge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROGER MOORE</AU>
<BD>ORLANDO SENTINEL</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>For David Ogden Stiers, there's a form of sweet revenge in his long
association with Disney cartoons.</LD>
<LD>   A voice-acting veteran of five animated films and six Disney
characters, the actor, 59, relishes anything that separates him from
"the green show," that 1970s and '80s TV series that formed his
public image for so long.</LD>
<LD>   "Last evening, at the parade, I saw this family," he says on a
visit to Walt Disney World. "The dad referred to me by the character
name, which makes me cringe. And he's urging his daughter to go up
and get my autograph.</LD>
<TE>   " 'You want his autograph, don't you?'</TE>
<TE>   "And she grabs her mother and glares at him.</TE>
<TE>   " 'No! You do!'</TE>
<TE>   "Hahaha! He was way busted. So I beckoned her over and said, 'You
don't know who I am, do you?' She's hiding behind her mother's skirt.
And I started doing the character voices for Ratcliffe [from
"Pocahontas"] and Cogsworth ["Beauty and the Beast"]. And the joy is
to see that mouth drop open as they try to put the voice of that tiny
clock with this tub of lard--me. It isn't adoration; it's a moment of
learning. And that, to me, is a little slice of heaven."</TE>
<TE>   He's become Disney's "go to" guy. Need an evil governor, and the
evil governor's sidekick, for "Pocahontas"? Or an officious
archdeacon in "The Hunchback of Notre Dame"? Call Stiers.</TE>
<TE>   But for him, voicing Jumba from "Lilo &amp; Stitch," his latest Disney
assignment, was just one more remove from the TV series that,
unhappily for him, America has yet to get over. It's not that he
hasn't left "MASH" and the snooty Maj. Charles Emerson Winchester III
behind. The problem comes from everybody else.</TE>
<TE>   "Even today, people call out the name of my character from that
show, and I cringe," he says. "That's why I walk so fast and kind of
disguise myself. I just can't have the same conversation 85 times a
day."</TE>
<TE>   He appeared on the recent "MASH" reunion special, something you
might have had trouble talking him into years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I actually wanted to do it because Harry [Morgan, who played Col.
Potter] is not getting any younger. And talking about it with those
folks was fun. The thing I took from it was that 'nobody lives
there.' We've all moved on, each in our own way. Life is ahead, not
behind you. I'm not ashamed of it, but I'm not going to rest my life
on it. Otherwise, I should simply quit."</TE>
<TE>   He hasn't. He's in the new USA cable TV series based on Stephen
King's "The Dead Zone." Stiers has appeared in lightweight comedies
such as "Doc Hollywood" and "Tomcats," and in Woody Allen films. But
perhaps his greatest post-"MASH" fame has come from Disney, where his
voice is heard in "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," "Pocahontas,"
"Atlantis," "Beauty and the Beast" and their video sequels, as well
as in the "Fantasmic!" Walt Disney World live show.</TE>
<TE>   "He is one of my favorite voice actors--that narration from
'Beauty and the Beast,' just lovely work," says animator Alex
Kupershmidt.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin McDonald, who voices Pleakley, Jumba's "Lilo &amp; Stitch"
sidekick, describes Stiers as "the master. I wish I'd called him
before I started recording. He's plainly got this figured out."</TE>
<TE>   How?</TE>
<TE>   "Find the 'work,' " Stiers says. "The work all starts in the same
place--Shakespeare in the Park, a car commercial and everything in
between."</TE>
<TE>   For instance, he was told to give Jumba a Russian accent. "I had
met a Russian emigre, Pasha, back when I was working on a series
called 'Love &amp; Money.' I gave him some of the lines, gave him a tape
recorder and got him to record the lines. I listened to it, got him
to give me pointers, polished it. It's not really Russian. It's
pretend Russian."</TE>
<TE>   Why does he keep coming back? The checks, which pay for things
like "a terrific diving vacation I took on the Great Barrier Reef,"
are nice. But he's had plenty of work. And when he's not acting, he
conducts symphony and pop orchestras across North America. He likes
the way Disney makes him look.</TE>
<TE>   "Disney doesn't insult you by offering you stupid stuff. The
characters are always interesting. There is some [acting] problem to
solve, something I haven't done before, maybe a song. A song is good.</TE>
<TE>   "You can do any face, dress in any costume you want. Any
contortion, to get the sound you want out, is allowed. Nobody says,
'What're you doing? Why did you waste all that energy?' Because the
screen doesn't care how you got it or how silly you looked saying
something.</TE>
<TE>   "There are moments in 'Lilo &amp; Stitch' where I have never heard
sounds like that come out of me. That's the best kind of work there
is, when you lose track of 'that's me up there.' No, that's Jumba."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One would expect "Out of the Ordinary," the current retrospective of
the work of architects Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown at the
San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art, to be a brazen show, full of
sizzle and pop.</LD>
<LD>   In the late 1960s, the Philadelphia-based duo became the
standard-bearers for a more pluralistic, everyday architecture. Their
target was the high art pretensions of the architectural
establishment--the dogmatic formulas of late Modernism. And,
mimicking artists like Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, they found
their inspiration in the popular landscapes of Main Street America.</LD>
<LD>   But the exhibition, which includes about 250 drawings, models and
photos of the couple's work from the 1950s to the present, is
surprisingly subdued. In dividing the firm's work into neat,
predictable categories--residential projects, university buildings
and the like--the show never gives a sense of the depth of the work's
impact on the profession. Instead it downplays the team's importance
as thinkers and overrates them as designers--an injustice to the
architects and the audience.</LD>
<TE>   The show opens with a large billboard, its surface scrawled with
catch phrases like "Less is a bore" and "Viva vulgar vitality," which
are intended to rattle the cage of the old avant-garde. From there, a
short video traces the arc of the team's career, with particular
emphasis on their early years as the enfants terribles of the
architectural establishment.</TE>
<TE>   The slogans, in particular, seem endearingly quaint by today's
ruthless marketing standards, and they do not begin to convey the
tremendous force with which the firm's ideas first hit the
profession. This was largely due to two books, Venturi's "Complexity
and Contradiction," published in 1966, and "Learning From Las Vegas,"
written by Venturi, Scott Brown and Steven Izenour in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   The first, written mostly in 1962, two years after the couple met,
focused on the interplay of historical styles that enlivened the
traditional city, in particular the disorder of Rome, a city that
Venturi worshiped. The book included a muted but radical challenge:
"Main Street is almost all right."</TE>
<TE>   But it was "Learning From Las Vegas" that shook the profession to
its foundations. By pointing to the "vulgar billboards" of the Vegas
Strip as emblems for a new architecture, it opened the eyes of the
East Coast establishment to West Coast car culture as the more
relevant vision of the future.</TE>
<TE>   That affection for American vernacular architecture could be
gleaned in much of Venturi's early work, which had an eclectic sense
of freedom that was radical and refreshing for its time. The most
famous of these, a centerpiece of the show, is the Vanna Venturi
House in Philadelphia, completed for the architect's mother in 1964.
The project's big, square entry, topped by an overscaled pitched roof
and flanked by asymmetrical windows, recalled a child's drawing of a
house. But its split facade, united under a gigantic faux chimney,
and its diagonal interior layout also gave the project a spatial
complexity that alludes to a range of architectural influences, from
Palladio to Pop.</TE>
<TE>   The Guild House, completed in Philadelphia two years later,
reflected a similar sensibility but adapted it to a tougher urban
environment. Designed as a low-cost federally subsidized apartment
building for the elderly, its brooding brick facade was marked by a
classically inspired arched window and a bold red-and-white sign that
announced the building's name. The building was topped by a gold,
anodized aluminum sculpture of a giant TV antenna, an emblem of
American culture transformed into an artwork that had no real
function.</TE>
<TE>   To a large degree, the beauty of such projects, which were
designed after the couple met but before Scott Brown formally joined
the office, stemmed from their total lack of pretension.</TE>
<TE>   But as time passed, the firm's design work seemed to lose its
aesthetic punch.</TE>
<TE>   There were exceptions, many of them depicted here. Among the best
is the 1978 Basco showroom and warehouse in Philadelphia, a seemingly
mundane shed-like structure with a series of 34-foot-tall letters set
along its facade that spell out the firm's name. A photo of a related
project, the 1979 Best Products Co. showroom in Langhorne, Pa.,
depicts a windowless warehouse, its surface painted over with red and
white flowers, like a Marimekko fabric.</TE>
<TE>   Even a work as recent as the American Sign Museum, designed in
2000 and never built, has a certain dated charm. In the single
drawing of the project included in the show, an overblown median
strip of a road runs directly into the museum's facade. Gigantic
billboards line the road on either side. A Bob's Big Boy sign leans
menacingly into view. Sunoco, Shell and Mobil signs evoke an era of
guilt-free gas guzzling. The composition has a surprisingly sinister
edge, which gives it the force of social criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Such designs are proof that the firm never descended into the kind
of vapid, ironic posturing that was a trademark of Postmodernism--a
movement that sought a return to neoclassical precedents and with
which the firm has always been unfairly identified. Venturi and Scott
Brown's range was always broader than that. Their influences ranged
from the classical Baroque and Pop art to industrial sheds and
fishermen's cottages. And throughout the 1970s they continued to turn
out projects like the Trubek and Wislocki houses, whose shingle-clad
forms, braced against the rugged Nantucket weather, retained a grace
and simplicity that verged on the heroic.</TE>
<TE>   An Architect's Inside Joke</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, by the mid-1980s the team's emphasis on architecture
as decoration was beginning to ring hollow. A typical example was the
design for the Seattle Art Museum, completed in 1991--the same year
Venturi was awarded the Pritzker Prize. The building's curved stone
facade, with a series of pink arches inscribed into its base, has the
feel of a paper cutout. Inside, a grand stair rises from the main
lobby on 1st Avenue to a secondary entry along 2nd Avenue. Above, a
series of thin yellow arches spans the stairs, acting as a sort of
stylistic code.</TE>
<TE>   The two-dimensional quality of the forms may be a witty play on
architecture as veneer, a collage of signs and symbols. But who,
other than an architect, would get the joke? And ultimately, the
effect is flat and lifeless, the spaces uninspired.</TE>
<TE>   A design for the Sainsbury Wing of London's National Gallery, also
completed in 1991, is more delicately conceived. The building's
facade, for instance, is a masterful collage of asymmetrically spaced
columns. And the fat, overscaled columns that mark the entry to the
galleries are a playful touch. But the building's interiors are
uneventful and often awkwardly scaled. And ultimately, the project
smacks of an academic exercise--one that has as much chance of
tapping into the popular imagination as does a text by Jacques
Derrida.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble was that Venturi and Scott Brown seemed stuck in an
increasingly distant past, and the profession had marched on without
them. By the end of the 1980s, others were taking up the cause of an
everyday architecture, with more provocative results. The swirling,
delirious forms of Frank Gehry's buildings, for example, recalled the
Baroque splendor that Venturi once admired.</TE>
<TE>   European architects like Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron,
meanwhile, were designing buildings whose often primitive forms seem
imbued with historical memory. Their 1997 Rudin House in Leymen,
France, was designed as a simple concrete box with a pitched roof.
But its form, raised up on a concrete platform, seems to float over
the landscape, and its concrete skin, marked by water stains, has a
remarkable sensual quality that instantly heightens one's awareness
of the physical world.</TE>
<TE>   A more relevant comparison, however, may be the work of Jon Jerde,
the Los Angeles-based mall designer who made a name for himself by
building congested retail and entertainment centers that mimic the
life of a Main Street. Slathered with billboards, LED screens and
computer-generated images, Jerde's designs are the real
thing--anti-elitist, Pop-inspired and accessible.</TE>
<TE>   Together, these architects and others embody the kind of
eclecticism that Venturi and Scott Brown  could only dream of. If
that kind of complexity is now part of accepted mainstream culture,
the team played a central role in making it all possible.</TE>
<TE>   In that sense, it is a shame the show will not travel to Los
Angeles. The city fits neatly into their vision of America. And the
presence of the Warhol show, now on view at the Museum of
Contemporary Art, would have placed the work in a particularly
tantalizing context. The result might have been a more informative
experience, and a deeper understanding of the legacy of one of the
most important, if flawed, architectural teams of its era.</TE>

<HD>Vox Femina Finds an Accessible Choral Avenue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Women's choirs were very popular in the 19th century. But it's
unlikely that Victorian literature would satisfy such a choir today,
especially Vox Femina Los Angeles, which describes itself as "a
family of women who are lesbian, bisexual and heterosexual."</LD>
<LD>   So to solve the problem of repertory, the group, founded in 1997
by conductor Iris S. Levine, has commissioned a number of new works
as well as arrangements for women's voices.</LD>
<LD>   Under Levine's direction, the chorus sang premieres of three
multipart works in its "Celebrating Women--Celebrating Our Diversity"
program Saturday at Zipper Concert Hall at the Colburn School of
Performing Arts.</LD>
<TE>   The new works were Roger Bourland's "The Alarcon Madrigals (Book
II)," three writers' contributions to "The Tolerance Project," and an
arrangement by Kevin Robison of Randi Driscoll's "What Matters," a
song written in response to the murder of Matthew Shepard.</TE>
<TE>   All three works are miniatures that are easily accessible.
Bourland's six a cappella madrigals are nicely crafted settings of
poems by Francisco X. Alarcon.</TE>
<TE>   Joan Szymko, Dave Kopplin and Karen Hart each wrote one effective
song in musical-theater style for "The Tolerance Project."</TE>
<TE>   The effort also included two spoken narratives published by the
Tolerance Group at Culver City High School.</TE>
<TE>   Driscoll's "What Matters'' is an inspirational soft-rock song that
should have wider currency.</TE>
<TE>   It was evident that few choirs are as engaged as Vox Femina. The
29 singers showed that singing and texts mattered to them,
collectively and individually.</TE>
<TE>   Rarely does so much individual personality shine through a choral
group as the singers responded to the subject matter in a personally
committed way.</TE>
<TE>   They have different vocal strengths and techniques, however, as
revealed by numerous soloists. Levine is able to blend all that into
a honed musical-theater style, but it has limits in dynamic, focus
and color.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Edwards, Ida Bodin and Megan Foley were the discreet pianist,
bassist and percussionist, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   As the single encore, the chorus sang Howard Ashman and Alan
Menken's "Kiss the Girl" from Walt Disney's "The Little Mermaid" as
singers Elizabeth Swenson and Liesl Scalzitti acted out a delightful
scene of two women finding each other, which neither Disney nor the
Victorians might have envisioned as an element for a women's chorus.</TE>

<HD>Calculated 'Instinct' Gets in Its Own Way</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Instinct" proved a peculiar title for the program of strenuously
overworked and anything-but-instinctual contemporary choreography
Friday at the Los Angeles Theatre Center. Presented by Dance LA, the
evening featured 13 pieces by six choreographers--all of them
relentlessly loading so many detailed technical and expressive
agendas into their dances that the possibility of movement flow
vanished altogether.</LD>
<LD>   Only in Johnny Tu's intricate, high-speed "Illuminated II" duet
with Patrick Su did anyone seem to be dancing from an inner
imperative or to be carried away by the movement. Tu's choreography
here and in two other pieces ("Illuminated" and "Untitled I")
harnessed a powerful gestural engine, and the fierce interplay with
Su inspired him to dance wholly in the moment, losing the sense of
studied execution afflicting the evening as a whole.</LD>
<LD>   Three pieces by Moonea Choi boasted intriguing pretexts that soon
crumbled into scattered riffs. "Claudia Gates" began with a strong
spatial focus, "Versus" had women partnering folding chairs, and
"Hohn" found Choi and Tu resisting opportunities for partnership and
glumly insisting on isolation.</LD>
<TE>   Jennifer McDonald Wilson created two showpieces for herself: the
technically challenging ballet trio "In the Flesh," and the more
emotional and less satisfying solo "Bound," in which she depicted
personal freedom as hard-won, frightening and ultimately just as much
of a burden as servitude.</TE>
<TE>   Ellen Rosa's "Move It" offered fine performances, an ambitious
jazz/ballet style and artful structural ploys. Unfortunately, she
then tried turning a women's ensemble into lurking beasts in
"Confined Prey" and succumbed to creepy-crawly overkill.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa also danced Nancy Smith Fichter's coldly jaunty solo "Grape."</TE>
<TE>   Host Brian Pelletier of Dance LA programmed his intense "Oxygen''
solo (from "Domestika") and an unfinished (or ill-finished) ensemble
suite titled "Cravings" that confirmed his ability to forge intuitive
links to pop music.</TE>
<TE>   However, everyone's quirky fingers, agonized posturing and
geometric formations always looked arbitrary rather than organic, and
even Pelletier's own dancing has been infinitely more visceral on
other occasions.</TE>
<TE>   Two dozen dancers participated in the event, some of them leading
lights of the local community (Tu and Lisa K. Lock, for instance),
others less familiar but just as dedicated to making this
collaborative venture successful. If many of the pieces looked like
workshop etudes, the dancing delivered their limited achievements
with consistent skill.</TE>

<LD>Audrey Skirball-Kenis always wanted to remain behind the scenes.</LD>
<LD>   "Audrey wasn't about putting on airs or getting press," said Kym
Eisner, executive director of A.S.K. Theater Projects, the
organization that philanthropist Skirball-Kenis co-created in 1989 to
nurture new theatrical work.</LD>
<LD>   Taking its cue from Skirball-Kenis, A.S.K. itself has also kept a
low profile, offering public presentations primarily in the form of
readings.</LD>
<TE>   Once a year, however, A.S.K. sheds some of its anonymity to
present Common Ground, a public festival of more fully staged
workshop productions. This year's Common Ground performances,
Saturday and Sunday at UCLA, were thrust involuntarily into greater
prominence than usual. In the last six months, A.S.K. has reevaluated
its programming and has seen four of its 11 staff members exit, most
of whom worked with local writers. That has prompted a wave of
concern about the group's focus. And then, on Wednesday,
Skirball-Kenis died of natural causes at the age of 87.</TE>
<TE>   She was memorialized at the weekend's eight presentations with a
statement from Eisner inserted into the programs and with a few
remarks prior to the performances.</TE>
<TE>   "Audrey was excited by the mere idea of trying something new, and
she was not afraid to take risks along the way," Eisner wrote. "She
always knew that we could only help create great new work if we
exercised that precious ability to take a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Skirball-Kenis nurtured risk-taking even though she and her
husband, A.S.K. co-founder Charles Kenis, "acknowledged that maybe
95% of what A.S.K. supports may not be to their taste," Eisner added
in an interview between shows.</TE>
<TE>   One of those at the workshop presentations on Saturday was Leon
Martell, a playwright who has participated in so many A.S.K. programs
over the years that "they thought I was part of the furniture," he
said. He credited Skirball-Kenis as "incredibly generous" and noted
that "she trusted her staff."</TE>
<TE>   "I have no complaints about what A.S.K. has been," Martell said.
Speculation that the organization may turn more of its attention to
partnerships with large theaters and companies outside L.A. has left
him "up in the air, wondering how it's going to shake down," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Only one program has officially been dropped--next fall's readings
of new plays. Eisner has noted that many other readings programs are
available. But Martell said A.S.K. readings were "the dream that
every playwright hopes a readings series would be," offering
"national recognition" to playwrights.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the idea that A.S.K. might spread more of its attentions
outside Los Angeles, Martell said L.A. playwrights will "have to
fight for our own space--and that's probably a healthy thing."</TE>
<TE>   Actor Tom McCleister, standing in line to see a performance on
Saturday, said L.A. actors are concerned about possible cutbacks in
A.S.K.'s programs in L.A. because "they've kept us busy with paying
jobs," even at readings. He said he hopes that the outcry from local
artists "will express to the powers that be that this is a good
program to keep."</TE>
<TE>   Eisner said evaluations of specific A.S.K. programs are
continuing, but she confirmed that the Common Ground festival will
exist for at least another year. However, she had other priorities
for the moment. She was slated to miss part of Sunday's events at
UCLA because they coincided with Skirball-Kenis' funeral.</TE>

<LD>"Cop stories are at root really just family stories, filled with
secret conflicts, shame, desire and humor, only dressed up with
sirens and flashing lights," Brian McDonald writes in his 1999 memoir
of three generations of New York City policemen, "My Father's Gun."
"They deserve to be told, no matter the risk."</LD>
<LD>   Tonight at 9 on the History Channel, the McDonald family tales
continue in a two-hour "documovie" of the same name that goes beyond
adaptation, giving insight into the making of the book and how its
publication has affected the protagonists. Perhaps most remarkable of
all, the show more than compensates for the loss of nuance when
translated from printed page to film by adding fresh layers all its
own.</LD>
<LD>   The program, as does the book, traces 100 years in the NYPD
through the lives of McDonald's maternal grandfather, Tom Skelly, who
struggled to stay honest in the corrupt days of Tammany Hall; the
author's father, Frank McDonald, squad commander of the detective
bureau in the Bronx's infamous Fort Apache precinct and a pioneer of
the first "cop land" in the Pearl River suburb; and the author's
brother Frankie, a rough-and-tumble sort skilled at "picking the
perp" yet torn over how to do the right thing.</LD>
<TE>   Even if you've read these fascinating tales of triumph and
tragedy, there's still reason to tune in, if only to hear them retold
by McDonald, who narrates in a smoky New York accent. His father and
brother also recount their own stories, updating them for a
post-Sept. 11 world, and in some cases clarifying or correcting the
book.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, McDonald's written account, especially the details in
Frankie's life, did not sit well with relatives. And though he's been
forgiven, it's apparent that the author, a journalist, will always
remain a kind of outsider, no matter how close his ties to the police
world.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "My Father's Gun" is a deeply personal and insightful work,
as book or documovie. The latter--a format melding documentary
interviews, archival footage and dramatizations "with special
attention given to historical accuracy"--could have been a disastrous
mishmash. But producer-director Phil Tuckett deftly holds the line
between fiction and the book's facts.</TE>
<TE>   As Frankie tells his brother while the cameras roll: "Why lie? I
got enough truthful stories to tell."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Iconoclastic composer Robert Ashley has a fiendish way with words.
His experimental operas are densely packed with them, snatched from
high and low culture and set into tightly choreographed blends of
speech, song, meaning and textural wizardry. Starting with his epic
1980s "television opera" project "Perfect Lives," Ashley has been
creating hypnotic, James Joyce-like maximalist works, which seem like
studies in free association but are more structure-conscious than
they let on.</LD>
<LD>   Language appears in a virtuosic flood in the 1994 "Foreign
Experiences," a duet version of which was given its West Coast
premiere Friday by Ashley colleagues Jacqueline Humbert and Sam
Ashley (the composer's son). It took place in the hip Salvation
Theater in Silver Lake, before a full--if tiny--house, as part of a
music series called "Vocal Lounge." Sparseness of set and setting
added to the compacted intensity here, as the two principals stood
onstage, in bare feet and trench coats, and offered a tour de force
performance.</LD>
<LD>   Ashley's work--which has been a huge influence on Laurie Anderson
and Spalding Gray, to name a couple of his better-known fans--has
been accorded critical praise, a cult following and commissions in
Europe, but he remains underappreciated, perhaps because his ideas
are ahead of, or at least outside of, their time.</LD>
<TE>   "Foreign Experiences" is one of four operas in the cycle "Now
Eleanor's Idea," from which two others, "Improvement" and
"eL/Aficionado," were performed at CalArts in 1993, with an ensemble
including baritone Thomas Buckner and Robert Ashley himself.</TE>
<TE>   As heard in Silver Lake, "Foreign Experiences" unfolds in a
72-minute thicket of language and allusion. It's unforgettable,
verging on the mystical. True to the Ashley code, plot is a
deliberately evasive thing. This much we know: Don (Sam Ashley) has
been drawn into unfamiliar, paranormal realms after taking a course
in premonitions. Linda (Humbert) interacts with and advises Don along
his confused path toward enlightenment.</TE>
<TE>   Off this loose premise, the composer spins his abstract yarn in
thick layers. Along the way are aspects of pulp-fiction patter, film
noir-ish intrigue, psychedelic recitative, expletive-adorned rants
and aesthetic observations, all part of Ashley's wild theatrical
tapestry.</TE>
<TE>   The score is delivered in a constantly shifting style, often with
the singers navigating the composer's tricky verbal rhythms,
venturing off into whirlwind solos or interrupting each other.</TE>
<TE>   At the Salvation, their vocals were subtly colored by live
electronic treatments by David Rosenboom and their bodies graced with
occasional light flashes controlled by Julie Adler.</TE>
<TE>   Electronic musical backdrops generally behaved as sonic scenery
rather than integral material. Sonic character varied among the four
acts, from distracted dissonances in Act I, rhythmic drive in Act II
(including a quasi-soul song moment) and the climactic outpouring of
Act IV, and ethereal octaves in Act III.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, "Foreign Experiences" may touch on the foreign
experience of language itself. The mesmeric blur of its libretto both
celebrates language and questions its basic hold on truth or rational
thought.</TE>
<TE>   Ashley's ultimate message may be that the language of music
strikes deepest.</TE>

<HD>'Lilo,' 'Minority Report' Tussling Over Top Spot</HD>
<DH>Box Office* Disney and 20th Century Fox each claim to have
No. 1 film.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The race for No. 1 ranking at the box office turned into a
mud-slinging affair over the weekend as two studios claimed the top
spot for their films--20th Century Fox for the Steven Spielberg
sci-fi thriller "Minority Report" and Disney for the animated "Lilo &amp;
Stitch."</LD>
<LD>   "It's nice to be No. 1, and we believe we're No. 1," said Chuck
Viane, senior distribution executive at Disney about "Lilo." Disney
claimed the film made an estimated $35.8 million for the weekend on
3,191 screens.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know what Disney is reporting, but we did $36.9 million
[on 3,001 screens]," countered Fox distribution chief Bruce Snyder
about "Minority Report."</LD>
<TE>   Although Fox is laying claim to the bragging rights as the
top-grossing movie, competing studios all had "Lilo" running ahead.
According to other studio estimates, the highest "Minority" grossed
over the weekend was $34 million--with the low being just above $32
million. Conversely, "Lilo" was tracking somewhere between $34
million and $36 million, much closer to what Disney reported.</TE>
<TE>   The Sunday box-office figures are based on studio estimates, and
it's not unusual for those figures to change when the final numbers
are reported on Monday. But it's rare for studios to directly dispute
each other's numbers, indicating how much pressure is on Fox and
Disney for their high-profile films to perform well.</TE>
<TE>   "Lilo" was No. 1 on Friday and "Minority Report" came in first on
Saturday. But according to Snyder, "Minority Report" was estimating
$12.3 million on Sunday, which would be higher than its opening-night
gross of $11.9 million. Sunday grosses, particularly on an
adult-skewing film, rarely outpace Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The $36.9-million estimate by Fox was widely reported by the media
and allowed the studio to claim that its highest-profile and most
expensive film of the summer (more than $100 million)--which boasts
such costly talents as Spielberg and star Tom Cruise--was not beaten
out by a kids film that cost half as much.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of who was on top, box-office totals for the year have
already surpassed $4 billion, running about 20% ahead of last year.
The last weekend was about 12% ahead of last year when "The Fast and
the Furious" debuted to $40 million. Totals for the top 12 movies
were approximately $151 million, according to Exhibitor Relations.</TE>
<TE>   For Disney, "Lilo" represents a return to traditional animation,
with an edgier, more free-form style that seems to have pleased
critics and audiences as well. Not since "Tarzan" has the studio
enjoyed as strong a start in non-computer animation--and "Tarzan,"
which took in $34.2 million its opening weekend in June 1999, cost
more than twice as much as "Lilo."</TE>
<TE>   Disney's biggest animation hits in recent years have all been in
computer-generated form with films such as "Monsters, Inc." the "Toy
Story" movies and "A Bug's Life," all produced by Pixar, with whom
Disney shared the bounty. "Lilo" is an in-house production and looks
to generate the kind of revenue and profits that could boost the
company's flagging fortunes (Disney's stock was pummeled by analyst
downgrades over the last week).</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people who are advocates of 3-D [computer] animation
have been naysayers of 2-D [traditional cel animation]," said Disney
CEO Michael Eisner. "We're working in 3-D, but that doesn't mean 2-D
doesn't work. It's all about creativity and storytelling. And we have
reworked our economic model on animated films to tell great stories
and at the same time enhance value for shareholders."</TE>
<TE>   In a season when hyperbolic opening-weekend grosses have become
standard issue, even if the estimates on "Minority Report" hold up,
they are modest by comparison to the $114-million opening
"Spider-Man" and even the $54-million opening of "Scooby-Doo."
According to Snyder, the reason is that "Minority" played to a
largely older audience (64% of whom were over 25), which doesn't
necessarily show up en masse on opening weekends the way teenagers
do. "But these movies tend to play longer," he said.</TE>

<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not everyone feels the need to seek out independent laboratory
testing, but it does pay to stay on top of your blood work.</LD>
<LD>   The first thing to know is that results of tests ordered by
doctors are part of your medical record and you're entitled to a
copy. If you're at risk for, say, high cholesterol, diabetes or
prostate cancer, it's a good idea to keep tabs on your
numbers--especially if you're likely to see a doctor who may not know
your health history.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes an attentive patient can catch a condition before it
becomes advanced, questioning test results to which the doctor may
have given short shrift.</LD>
<TE>   "If your doctor doesn't have time to go over it with you, you need
to find a new doctor," said Dr. Andre Ettinger, an internist at
Huntington Hospital in Pasadena. "When people come in and get a
physical with me, we sit down and go over every single number; it
takes all of two minutes to do." He said most patients "want to know
the basics: Is my blood sugar OK? Is my cholesterol OK? Am I anemic?"</TE>
<TE>   The most common blood test is the CBC, or complete blood count,
measuring quantities of cells in a given sample of blood, including
infection-fighting white blood cells and oxygen-ferrying hemoglobin,
and the hematocrit, which measures the percentage of red blood cells.
These tests can pick up infection, anemia, leukemia and other
disorders.</TE>
<TE>   Most doctors routinely ask the lab to measure several lipids, the
technical term for blood fats. These include total cholesterol, as
well as high-density lipoprotein ("good" cholesterol), low-density
lipoprotein ("bad" cholesterol), and the ratio between the two, which
assesses the risk of having a heart attack or stroke. Often,
triglycerides are measured as well; when elevated, they're another
risk for heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   Glucose levels indicate diabetes risk. Levels of electrolytes, or
salts, such as sodium, potassium and chloride indicate how the heart,
liver and kidney are functioning. Levels of creatine, phosphorus and
blood urea nitrogen--or BUN--can show if the kidneys are working
properly.</TE>
<TE>   The erythrocyte sedimentation rate--or ESR--measures how long it
takes red blood cells to settle to the bottom of a test tube,
providing a general indication of inflammation somewhere in the body.
If you're at risk for a bleeding problem, either a prothrombin time
or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test will show how long it takes
your blood to clot. Thyroid tests can pick up an underactive or
overactive thyroid gland.</TE>
<TE>   Most laboratories provide, alongside each of your results, a
so-called reference range, which is the range of normal readings;
these may vary from lab to lab, depending on how the measuring is
done. Labs often flag a reading that is too high or too low. But even
then, you'll need to rely on your doctor in most cases to determine
if the reading merits concern.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Momma said, "Eat your vegetables." She was right, of course, but we
often ignored her as kids, and we are failing to listen as adults.
Very few of us eat the recommended five to nine servings daily of
fruits and vegetables, and many are eating three or fewer servings.
And that's why many scientists and medical researchers believe most
Americans could benefit from taking a vitamin pill.</LD>
<LD>   Consumers need to know what vitamins and minerals they need every
day, and the cheapest way to get them. A single daily pill, called a
multivitamin, is the best way to get your supplemental nutrition,
especially if you don't regularly consume the recommended amounts of
fruits, vegetables and other vitamin-rich foods. But you've got to
know how to shop wisely.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike prescription drugs, vitamins (and other dietary
supplements, such as herbal products) aren't regulated for safety and
efficacy by the Food and Drug Administration. The government does not
assure you that a bottle of vitamins is safe, that the pills inside
work to give you the nutrients you need or that the product is
manufactured under strict standards. Typically, the government steps
in only when something goes wrong--for example, when consumers who
have used a particular product get sick or die.</LD>
<TE>   So you have to be your own inspector. First, check the label on
the bottle to be sure the contents are what you need. There are
FDA-approved daily values, which tell you what a healthy adult needs
in a typical day. The vitamin is never a substitute for eating
properly. But it can assure that you get the basic things you need.
The multivitamin should contain 100% of the daily values of vitamins
A, B-6, B-12, C, D and E, as well as riboflavin, niacin and folic
acid. The pill also should contain calcium, copper, magnesium, zinc,
iron and iodine. Next, you have to be sure the product will dissolve
in your bloodstream, so that you actually get the benefit of the
vitamins. If the pill is compacted too tightly when it is
manufactured, or if the coating is too thick, it will pass through
your system without dissolving.</TE>
<TE>   Here is an easy home test. Drop the multivitamin in a glass of
vinegar, which represents the acid content of your stomach in this
experiment. The pill should dissolve within 45 minutes. If it
doesn't, look for another product. Or you can look for the USP label
on the bottle. This means the vitamin product has been approved by
the U.S. Pharmacopoeia, an independent organization that performs
laboratory tests on the pills.</TE>
<TE>   And don't be impressed by any extravagant language on the bottle
that goes beyond a simple listing of the basic vitamins inside and
their percentage of recommended daily value. The UC Berkeley Wellness
Letter gives a selection of "words you don't need to see listed" on a
vitamin bottle. These include "stress formula," "sugar-free,"
"starch-free," "natural," "super-potency," "senior formula,"
"slow-release," "enzymes" and "amino acids," as well as the addition
of herbal ingredients such as ginseng. These serve no purpose and add
to the price, according to the newsletter. If you want to buy an
herbal supplement, purchase it separately. Talk to your doctor
because herbs sometimes counteract the medicines you might be taking.
And the quality and quantity of herbs in a given bottle of supplement
is uncertain, some health professionals caution.</TE>
<TE>   While virtually all adults can benefit from a multivitamin, for
some groups it may be essential. Women of childbearing age need folic
acid because it prevents birth defects. It is needed in the first
trimester of pregnancy, often before a woman may discover she is
pregnant. But 70% of women between 18 and 45 aren't taking a
multivitamin with folic acid, according to a series of public opinion
surveys for the March of Dimes.</TE>
<TE>   Others at high risk of vitamin deficiency are those who consume at
least one or two alcoholic drinks daily; persons over 65; and poor
people, who may be unable to afford adequate supplies of fresh
vegetables and fruits. Vegans--individuals who eat no animal
products--also are at risk of suffering vitamin deficiencies. Also,
many women nearing menopause don't have enough iron in their diets,
and a multivitamin can help.</TE>
<TE>   How much should you pay for vitamins? A 2001 report in the New
England Journal of Medicine said adults can get a multivitamin at a
typical cost of $20 to $40 a year. Because the price is so
reasonable, it makes sense to give a general endorsement to the idea
of vitamins for most people, rather than spending the money for blood
tests to determine who has vitamin deficiencies, according to the
Harvard School of Public Health researchers who wrote the article.</TE>
<TE>   Prices may range from about $3 for a monthly supply to as much as
$30, but the expensive brands don't necessarily offer anything worth
paying extra for. The key is the contents of the bottle in terms of
the daily values of vitamins. "You can spend 10 cents a day and get a
good vitamin, or spend $1 a day and get one that is no better," said
David Schardt, senior nutritionist at the Center for Science in the
Public Interest, a consumer health advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   Major supermarket and drugstore chains can offer high-quality,
low-cost house brands, and these big retail chains have enough clout
with the manufacturers to insist on quality and uniformity. This is
an important issue. The independent testing organization Consumer Lab
purchased 27 brands, examined them for content and discovered that
nine of the 27 did not live up to the claims on the label. They had
too much or too little vitamin A, or too little folic acid.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer Lab said the products that passed its tests included
Geritol Complete High Potency Multi-Vitamin; One a Day Maximum
MultiVitamin; Theragran-M Advanced Multivitamin; Vita-Smart High
Potency Vitamins; and Walgreens Multiple Vitamins.</TE>
<TE>   Once you've decided what brand to buy, there are a few more things
to remember. Don't buy any product without an expiration date on the
label. The pills can lose their potency quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Take your vitamins with your meals. They are easier for the body
to absorb. Talk to your doctor before buying multivitamins,
especially if you are taking medication. Vitamins sometimes clash
with the efficient absorption of medications. Vitamins E and K, for
example, can interfere with blood-thinning medications such as
Coumadin and its generic version, warfarin.</TE>
<TE>   Don't overdo a good thing. Consuming 200% of the daily recommended
amount of a vitamin won't make you twice as healthy or give you a
double dose of protection against disease. Instead, it can make you
sick. Too much vitamin A, for example, can cause headaches, blurred
vision and diarrhea.</TE>

<LD>Parents aren't to blame for all the silly names in the world--the
absurdity crosses species lines. Imagine a diminutive crustacean
having to live up to a name like Gammaracanthuskytodermogammarus
loricatobaicalensis. Or the indignity, for a beetle, of a moniker
like Agra vation, Agra phobia or Agra cadabra.</LD>
<LD>   Chemicals get silly names too--and we are fortunate that, a few
years back, an enterprising Brit decided to list as many as he could
find.</LD>
<LD>   Paul May, a lecturer in chemistry at Bristol University, already
had a serious, educational Web site that features a
molecule-of-the-month. (We're guessing that Bristol isn't too
hopping.)</LD>
<TE>   Then, one day at the pub, an organic chemist friend suggested a
similar site with only silly names.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, such as what?" recalls May--and his pal volunteered a
bona fide chemical with a name too vulgar for us to print. Over
beers, the two thought of several more--megaphone, buckminster
fullerene, adamantane--and the site was born.</TE>
<TE>   To May's delight, the word spread fast.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was going to be a little Web site that a few friends
could laugh about privately," he says. "But everybody seemed to like
it, and everyone seemed to know some molecule. People all over
started e-mailing me."</TE>
<TE>   May doesn't list every name he gets sent--some are a bit too lame,
he says. (Vulgarity, on the other hand, is an asset.)</TE>
<TE>   Here are some of the more G-rated among his collection: munchnone,
moronic acid, rhamnose, windowpane, constipatic acid, penguinone,
dogcollarane, snoutene, rudolphomycin, Hi-O-silver and, my personal
favorite: Bis(pinacolato)diboron. (Anyone for a cocktail?)</TE>
<TE>   Oftentimes, says May, the chemicals got their daft names because
of their shape, because they were named after the discoverer or named
after the plant they were derived from.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of the chemicals are of medical significance, and May posts
little tidbits about what the substances are and how they came by
their names. Such as:</TE>
<TE>   * Godnose. This is actually an early, tongue-in-cheek name for
Vitamin C. The vitamin's discoverer, Albert Szent-Gyorgi, was racking
his brains for a name and called it godnose because he had no idea of
its chemical structure. The name was disallowed, but Szent-Gyorgi did
OK: He won a Nobel prize for his discovery.</TE>
<TE>   * Antipain. You'd think this molecule, known as a protease
inhibitor, would be soothing, but in fact it is toxic, causing
itching and--yes, pain.</TE>
<TE>   * Putrescine. This delightful-sounding chemical is produced in
rotting flesh as a breakdown product of amino acids, the little
chemicals that proteins are made of. Together with another chemical,
cadaverine, it's behind much of the odor of rotting flesh.</TE>
<TE>   * Spamol. May points out that this is not Monty Python's favorite
molecule, but an anti-spasmodic.</TE>
<TE>   * Domperidone. Not a champagne, but an anti-vomiting drug.</TE>
<TE>   * Trunkamide. Its 3-D structure looks vaguely (very vaguely) like
an elephant's head. Extracted from a sea squirt, it has anti-tumor
activity.</TE>
<TE>   * BCNU (be-seein' you). A drug that--while toxic--is useful for
the treatment of brain cancer.</TE>
<TE>   To check out May's more serious, molecule-of-the-month Web site
(which we find very enjoyable, despite our earlier rib) go to
www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/Chemistry/MOTM/motm.htm.</TE>
<TE>   This month's molecule: the amino acid tryptophan.</TE>
<TE>   But if your thirst for silly molecules is not sated, head straight
to www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/Chemistry/MOTM/silly/sillymols.htm.</TE>
<TE>   Complaints about lewdness? Address them to the chemists.</TE>

<HD>Lab's Supplements Shouldn't Be Taken</HD>
<DH>Medication: Officials issue warning about remedies made by

<LD>State health officials are warning consumers to stop using remaining
supplies of supplements from BotanicLab, maker of the recalled PC
SPES.</LD>
<LD>   BotanicLab, which closed its doors earlier this month, recalled
its popular prostate cancer remedy after the California Department of
Health Services found it was contaminated with the prescription drugs
warfarin, diethylstilbesterol (DES), ethinyl estradiol and
indomethacin.</LD>
<LD>   More recent testing of other BotanicLab products by the state has
also turned up contamination with ingredients available only in
prescription medications, including alprazolam, indomethacin and DES.</LD>
<TE>   Consumers should stop taking Arthrin, Hepastat, Neutralis, OA
Plus, Osporo, Poena and RA SPES, all made by BotanicLab, according to
the Department of Health Services. Individuals using these products
and taking any other prescribed medication should seek medical
advice, said Diana M. Bonta, state health director.</TE>
<TE>   Unsupervised exposure to prescription drugs could cause serious
health problems, Bonta said. Alprazolam can be addictive and
exacerbates the effects of alcohol and other depressants.</TE>
<TE>   DES and ethinyl estradiol are estrogens that can affect fertility
and cause cardiovascular problems. Indomethacin can cause ulcers,
gastrointestinal bleeding, nausea, vomiting, headache, depression and
fatigue.</TE>

<HD>Beware the Bargain Botox</HD>
<DH>Procedure: With prices falling, some doctors worry that low
costs could indicate the toxin has been diluted. Others say it's a
way to bring in patients.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Botox price wars have begun, only two months after the wrinkle
treatment won federal approval.</LD>
<LD>   Advertisements touting the injections for $95 and $100 have begun
appearing in magazines and direct-mail fliers in Los Angeles and
Orange counties, sharply undercutting the standard $350 to $500 per
facial area and raising questions about the quality of the bargain
treatments.</LD>
<LD>   But while some doctors objecting to bargain Botox prices may be
unhappy to see competitors (particularly newcomers to the business
who are not specifically trained in skin care) siphon off patients,
others say they worry that low prices may reflect inferior treatment.</LD>
<TE>   Few people are aware that the strength of the Botox solution can
vary widely among doctors, says Dr. Brian Kinney, a Los Angeles
plastic surgeon and spokesman for the American Society of Plastic
Surgeons.</TE>
<TE>   Overly diluted injections, which can lower a doctor's costs, can
be ineffective and raise the risk of complications, such as having a
droopy eyelid.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of sophistication and subtlety to this," Kinney
says. "It's not just taking a needle and poking it into someone's
face and pushing the plunger."</TE>
<TE>   Botox , which has other medical uses, is sold to doctors by
Allergan Inc. for about $400 per vial; the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approved its use as a wrinkle treatment in April. Each
tiny vial contains freeze-dried botulinum toxin type A, which, when
injected, can temporarily paralyze certain facial muscles to smooth
creases. But the dried toxin must be mixed with saline solution
before it's loaded into a syringe and injected.</TE>
<TE>   Most doctors mix the toxin with 2.5 cubic centimeters of saline,
producing enough Botox to treat three to four facial areas, says Dr.
Alan Matarasso, a New York City surgeon and spokesman for the
American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "We can get three to four sites, at the most, out of one bottle,"
he says. "Simple arithmetic says charging $99 per site, you haven't
covered the cost of the bottle."</TE>
<TE>   But doctors offering the low fees say they aren't looking for big
profits from Botox.</TE>
<TE>   At $100 per area, "we still make money," says Dr. Kambiz Youabian,
an internist who operates the Cosmetic Laser Center of Los Angeles.
The main reason for the price cuts, he says, is to "get people into
the office and acquaint them with our other procedures."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Kamran Hakimian of the Laser Cosmetic Clinic in Beverly Hills
and Costa Mesa says his high-volume practice allows him to price
Botox at $95 per area.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have two clients a day and some leftover Botox, you are
going to lose money," he says. "I have volume, and I don't have as
much left over." Once mixed, Botox should be used within four hours
or discarded, according to Allergan. Consumers have no way of
knowing, however, if a doctor is diluting the treatments, says
Matarasso.</TE>
<TE>   Mixing the toxin with too much saline increases the risk of
complications because a dilute solution is more likely to migrate
into other muscle areas, he says, causing problems like a droopy
eyelid, double vision or a droopy lip.</TE>
<TE>   And a watered-down injection isn't as likely to hold up. Botox
treatments typically last for about four months.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm worried that in a year or two people will say, 'Don't bother
with Botox; it doesn't work' because [they] got an overdiluted dose,"
says Matarasso.</TE>
<TE>   Most Botox prices are quoted per muscle group. This usually means
one of four major areas: the frown lines between the eyes, the
forehead muscles, crow's feet at the sides of the eyes and the cords
in the neck. Consumers should make sure that doctors define how much
of the face will be treated.</TE>
<TE>   For example, says Kinney, "One 'area' may mean a very small area,
a corner of your eye, not all of your eye."</TE>
<TE>   Also, in recent weeks, several doctors' groups, insurance groups
and even Allergan have warned consumers to avoid Botox parties, where
discounted treatments are given at private homes, gyms or spas.</TE>
<TE>   The Doctors' Company, a leading malpractice insurance business in
California, has recommended that Botox only be provided in a doctor's
office by doctors trained in facial anatomy.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid potential malpractice lawsuits, the company also
suggested its doctors take a patient's medical history before a Botox
treatment and ask the patient to sign an informed consent document
describing the treatment and possible side effects, such as headache,
nausea, respiratory infection, facial pain, skin redness and muscle
weakness from migration.</TE>
<TE>   Botox should not be given to pregnant or nursing women, the
Doctor's Company advised, because it is not known whether the toxin
could harm a fetus or be secreted into breast milk.</TE>
<TE>   Medical histories and informed-consent procedures may be bypassed
when Botox is delivered in nonmedical settings, says Matarasso.</TE>
<TE>   "If you go to a gym for a discounted treatment and have a
complication, who do you call?" he says. "Do you call the gym and
say, 'When is the doctor coming back to the gym?' "</TE>
<TE>   Allergan also recently issued a statement on possible abuses of
Botox. The company says it will only market the treatment to
aesthetic specialty doctors including dermatologists, plastic
surgeons, facial plastic surgeons, oculoplastic surgeons,
ophthalmologists and maxillofacial surgeons.</TE>
<TE>   Allergan spokeswoman Christine Cassiano noted that the company
cannot control doctors' pricing.</TE>
<TE>   But, she says, "The odds are that a doctor who is more qualified
and has hands-on experience will charge more than someone who is less
qualified."</TE>

<HD>Outgoing Personalities Soak Up Joy</HD>
<DH>Study shows extroverts' brains respond to happy stimuli,
while those of introverts do not. Finding may help explain how
happiness is regulated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMIE TALAN</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The brain of an upbeat, extroverted person responds to a happy human
face differently from the way an introvert's brain responds, a new
finding that could help pinpoint how the brain regulates happiness.</LD>
<LD>   Turhan Canli, an assistant professor of psychology at State
University of New York, Stony Brook, who did this particular work
while at Stanford, used brain imaging to address questions about how
the brain, specifically the snippet of tissue called the amygdala,
responds when people look at happy faces. The amygdala is also known
as the site of fear in the brain, governing "flight or fight"
impulses. Earlier research had found that the amygdala is activated
when some people look at happy faces, while other research had found
that it is not.</LD>
<LD>   The study appears in a recent edition of Science. People with an
extroverted outlook on life actually have a robust response of their
amygdala when shown a picture of a happy face. The brains of
introverts show no such response.</LD>
<TE>   "Extroversion may play a role in how active the brain is in
response to stimuli," Canli said. Fifteen volunteers filled out a
personality inventory, testing traits, from tendencies to be
optimistic and sociable to anxious, worried and insecure. They then
were hooked up to a brain imager. During the scan, they were shown
pictures of happy faces. Scans also were taken when they looked at
fearful and neutral faces. Personality didn't influence response to
those faces.</TE>
<TE>   Introverts showed no activation of the amygdala when looking at
happy faces. Canli takes this to mean that the amygdala registers
stimuli that are emotionally or socially important. For introverts,
happy faces did not register as socially important enough to activate
the tissue. Canli and his colleagues at Stanford suspect that the
amygdala's role in regulating fearful experiences is more uniform,
regardless of personality type, because of the deep evolutionary
roots of fear response in human survival.</TE>

<LD>Staying physically active may help older adults think on their feet
nearly as well as they did when they were young.</LD>
<LD>   The ability to choose quickly among several possible actions,
called executive control function, normally seems to decline with
age. Executive control requires more processing by the brain than
automatic activities that are done with little if any conscious
thought, such as stepping on the gas when the red light turns green.
When the red light turns green and then a person steps out into the
intersection, the driver has to both stop the automatic
action--stepping on the gas--and do something different--slam on the
brakes. That's when executive control comes into play.</LD>
<LD>   After dividing 24 older adults into groups according to their
usual level of physical activity, the researchers tested their
executive control functions while monitoring the electrical activity
in their brains. The same tests were done on eight young adults.</LD>
<TE>   The highly active older men and women were able to process
information nearly as quickly as the younger adults. But those in the
low and moderately active groups lagged behind, says Charles H.
Hillman, professor of kinesiology at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign. He presented his findings recently at the annual
meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine.</TE>

<TE>   Strand of Colored Beads Tracks Cycle, Simplifies Birth Control</TE>
<TE>   There are only about six days a month--five days before ovulation
and 24 hours after ovulation--when a woman is likely to become
pregnant. But figuring out when these days occur involves complicated
calculations or meticulous observations and charting. Now researchers
have figured out when a couple should avoid unprotected sex and have
devised an easier way to keep count of the days.</TE>
<TE>   It's called the Standard Days Method, and a study of more than 450
women has shown it to be as effective as barrier methods of birth
control for women who have regular monthly menstrual cycles. The
method was developed using a computerized model that applied the
variability of ovulation and the probability of pregnancy to data on
more than 7,000 menstrual cycles of women around the world. Using
their results, the researchers then devised a simple system using a
strand of colored beads that allows women to easily see when they are
fertile and whether their cycles are the right length to use this
method.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers recruited women in Peru, Bolivia and the
Philippines to test CycleBeads for at least 13 cycles in a study
funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development. The
pregnancy rate was 4.8%, which compares well with the diaphragm (6%)
and the male condom (3%).</TE>
<TE>   Victoria H. Jennings, director of the Institute for Reproductive
Health at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C.,
says CycleBeads are already being used on a wider scale in the
countries where they were tested. She expects that CycleBeads will be
available soon through family planning clinics in the U.S. and on the
Internet.</TE>

<TE>   How Exercise Helps the Heart: Reduced Inflammation May Be Key</TE>
<TE>   Researchers may have identified a key reason why being physically
active helps the heart: It appears to subdue chronic inflammation,
which has been linked to atherosclerosis.</TE>
<TE>   By studying the levels of several indicators of inflammation in
the blood, Emory University researchers in Atlanta found that people
who exercised most were less likely to have elevated signs of
inflammation than those who rarely performed any physical activity.
Among 3,500 middle-aged and older Americans, those who exercised 22
or more times a month were 37% less likely to have elevated levels of
C-reactive protein (CRP) than those who were physically active only
three or fewer times a month. C-reactive protein is not routinely
tested as cholesterol is, but experts agree that that a high level is
an important sign of increased risk of heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   The white blood cell count of those who exercised often was 41%
less likely to be elevated, and they were 23% less likely to have an
elevated level of fibrinogen, a component of blood. These are also
indicators of inflammation.</TE>
<TE>   One of the limitations of the study is that participants were
asked only how often they exercised, not for how long. "It may be
that exercising longer but less frequently has the same
anti-inflammatory effect as exercising frequently but for short time
periods," says Jerome L. Abramson, postdoctoral fellow in the
division of cardiology at Emory University School of Medicine.</TE>

<TE>   Updated Guidelines for Diagnosis of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</TE>
<TE>   Despite the proliferation of high-tech imaging tests, the gold
standard laboratory study to confirm the diagnosis of carpal tunnel
syndrome remains the classic nerve conduction tests. Such tests can
be done by a specially trained physician in less than half an hour
and are far less expensive than, say, an MRI scan. Now, in response
to improvements in the techniques, three medical organizations have
agreed on updated guidelines for these tests.</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines--from the American Assn. of Electrodiagnostic
Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology and the American Academy
of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation--were published this month in
three medical specialty journals. Carpal tunnel syndrome produces
discomfort of the hand and wrist because of pressure on the nerves at
the base of the palm.</TE>
<TE>   "Nerve conduction studies measure the electrical patterns in
nerves ... just as an EKG measures the electrical patterns of the
heart," says Dr. Charles K. Jablecki, clinical professor of
neuroscience at UC San Diego Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Jablecki, a coauthor of the revised guidelines, says that by
performing the new tests, the physician will be able to accurately
confirm carpal tunnel syndrome in 85% of the people who have it,
which is a 10% to 15% improvement in sensitivity over the tests
recommended in the previous guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   A detailed history and physical exam by a physician is still done
before any laboratory tests, but according to Jablecki, "The
consensus of several medical specialties is that electrodiagnosis
should be done before carpal tunnel surgery."</TE>

<TE>   'Skin Sparing' Surgery Technique Minimizes Breast Cancer Scars</TE>
<TE>   Back in the mid-1980s, a few plastic surgeons reasoned that
removing only the breast tissue in a mastectomy and leaving the
envelope of skin intact might enable them to immediately reconstruct
a more natural-looking breast than traditional mastectomy operations
allowed. The concern was local recurrence: Would the cancer be more
likely to come back?</TE>
<TE>   According to a long-term evaluation of 105 women operated on by
the first surgeon to do a skin-sparing mastectomy, the rate of
recurrence in the breast was 3.8%, which is comparable to other
techniques. The average follow-up time of the current study was eight
years and four months.</TE>
<TE>   The skin-sparing procedure is now being done at hospitals across
the U.S. The operation involves removing the breast tissue, biopsy
scar, nipple and areola, usually through an incision around the
areola. The reconstruction is done using muscle taken from another
part of the woman's body or a synthetic implant. When the circular
incision is closed and the nipple later re-created, there is little
if any visible scarring and the breast has a natural shape.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco plastic surgeon Bryant A. Toth says the low
recurrence rate means that a mastectomy doesn't have to be a
mutilating procedure. The operation is limited to women with
early-stage breast cancer or women at very high risk of breast cancer
who choose to have a preventive mastectomy.</TE>

<HD>Study of Diabetic Canadian Group Paints a Dire Picture</HD>
<DH>Health: Kidney failure, miscarriage, blindness, amputation
are among complications found in 51 type 2 patients.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the first study to look at the long-term health consequences of a
form of diabetes increasingly seen in children, a Canadian researcher
found that the disease is taking a heavy toll when they reach
adulthood.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors have long warned that the growing number of overweight
children developing type 2 diabetes--which just 20 years ago was
almost entirely seen in adults--potentially face complications
including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure and amputations in
coming years.</LD>
<LD>   But the snapshot of how this small group of Canadian patients was
doing in adulthood was, in some ways, worse than what doctors might
have expected.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Heather Dean, a pediatrician at the University of Manitoba in
Winnipeg, presented her findings recently at the American Diabetes
Assn. meeting in San Francisco. She kept track of 51 patients with
type 2 diabetes from her clinic who were diagnosed before age 17. Of
the 51, now between ages 18 and 33, two have died from diabetes and
its complications. Both were women, ages 25 and 31, who were on
dialysis for kidney failure and suffered acute heart problems. One of
them also was blind and had a stillborn child.</TE>
<TE>   Another three patients remain on dialysis for kidney failure,
including a woman who became blind at 26 and another who underwent
amputation of a toe.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 56 pregnancies among the 44 women in the group, only 35
resulted in live births. Dean said 18 women had miscarriages or other
failed pregnancies; two delivered stillborn children over 20 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 20 years, Dean said, mothers with type 1 diabetes have
been able to greatly reduce their rates of stillbirths through better
management of their disease. What was significant about the failed
pregnancies among her former patients was that, like blindness, heart
disease and kidney failure, many of their complications should have
been preventable with good control of sugar levels.</TE>
<TE>   The patients all were from Canada's native First Nations people,
who are very prone to diabetes, so it's too soon to know whether type
2 diabetes would be as aggressive in other children in Canada and the
U.S. But she's seen similar rates of type 2 diabetes among Latino
children in San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Dean said her patients' complications didn't stem from a lack of
access to health care, because Canada's health care system provides
all medications, health care supplies and doctor visits. But like
many people with childhood illnesses, some of them did not receive
regular medical care once they reached adulthood.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The following is a psychiatrist's bad dream. A patient arrives at the
hospital, committed by a court after he was found facing oncoming
traffic on a busy road. He has not eaten or slept for days. He is
convinced that a conspiracy is taking elaborate shape around him and
that he is under attack. He gives his name to the registration lady
as Mr. X. The registration lady shakes her head and on the admitting
form she copies his real name from the emergency room face sheet.
Next to that, she types: "a.k.a. Mr. X." She has seen this before.</LD>
<LD>   The necessary treatment is evident. Hospital staff need to have
background information from those who know him best. Communication
between family, outpatient caregivers and the hospital must be free
and bi-directional. Mr. X needs to start medication, to stabilize and
to be discharged to a setting where his compliance can be monitored.
The problem is, without his specific permission, these elements of
care violate his patient rights.</LD>
<LD>   Mr. X refuses to sign his Health Care Proxy, so there is no one to
make medical decisions for him should he suddenly become too ill to
communicate. He also refuses to sign consent forms allowing us to
give him any medication. This means we will need to petition the
court to force him to take antipsychotic drugs. This process takes
weeks, during which he will eat only reluctantly and speak only in
fragments.</LD>
<TE>   Noncompliance is standard military protocol, certainly reasonable
for a man "under attack." By holding him in the hospital against his
will, we have proved ourselves part of the conspiracy. So it is no
surprise--just a soldier's internal consistency--when he refuses to
sign release forms that would let us contact anyone from his past for
reliable historical details. He won't even let us tell his family he
is here.</TE>
<TE>   Rights are meant to be protective. During medical training,
doctors supported them strongly. We believed in informed consent,
confidentiality of communication and treatment refusal. We rejected
the grandfather practitioner with his last name stitched in red
across one breast pocket (the first name was always "Dr."), the one
who looked over half-glasses and mandated this surgery, that
treatment, this medicine. We were tired of a paternalistic medical
model, especially in psychiatry, where the sicker the patient the
fewer the explanations. We sought collaboration and choice; our
patients would be our colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Psychiatric patients acquired legal rights of informed consent and
refusal. They can decide which information to let doctors know, which
medication to take and which treatments to refuse. They also can
defend their decisions in court.</TE>
<TE>   But because the pendulum is manned by human beings, it has swung
too far. In cases like that of Mr. X, patient rights have begun to
sabotage treatment. These same rights have lost their hero's shine
and begun to look a little thuggish--riding into town with
six-shooters in the name of protection, backing caregivers against
the saloon wall, and standing with hands to the holster, ready to
draw at the slightest opposing movement.</TE>
<TE>   It is a contorted world when patients who desperately need
treatment can refuse doctors access to their medical and psychiatric
histories. Doctors' licenses can be revoked for forcing medications
on psychotic patients, no matter how desperately they need them,
without court approval (though perhaps if psychotic patients were
housed in the court until their cases were heard, the process would
move more rapidly). Treatment can devolve into warehousing.</TE>
<TE>   It just so happens, in this particular upside-down case, that we
know Mr. X. This is his fourth admission. He consistently stops
medication and falls out of view after discharge. Paranoia on a grand
level becomes only a matter of time. Probably, the court will let us
find out what we need to know about where he has been since we last
saw him and treat the life-threatening delusions we need to treat. It
has let us do so before--three times.</TE>
<TE>   But we will need to wait until then. And, if for some reason the
court rules against us, as it has done in other cases, we are at an
impasse. We will be unable to discharge Mr. X because he cannot
safely care for himself and unable to treat him fully because his
rights have prevented it. It is a bad dream to have and a worse one
to enter.</TE>

<LD>Re: "Analysis Questions Link Between Breast Milk, IQ" (June 10):
Breast-feeding and IQ are linked. There are no studies showing that
formula-fed babies are smarter or healthier, just as there are no
studies showing that cigarette smokers live longer or have less heart
disease and lung cancer. Further, breast-feeding is dose-related. For
maximum mental growth, breast-feeding for at least a year is
recommended. (See "The Association Between Duration of Breastfeeding
and Adult Intelligence," Journal of the American Medical Assn., May
8, 2002.)</LD>

<TE>   I object to the researcher's statement that "for working women,
it's incredibly hard to maintain breast-feeding." Though pumping
breast milk at work can be inconvenient and tedious, it is hardly the
only inconvenient or tedious task that parents undertake to give
their babies the best possible care. The truth is that many working
women continue to breast-feed, for good reason: Breast milk is
"uniquely superior for infant feeding" (see American Academy of
Pediatrics policy statement, "Breastfeeding and the Use of Human
Milk").</TE>
<TE>   JILL BROWN</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is a rare situation in which a mother cannot breast-feed. Many
hospitals in the Los Angeles area employ lactation consultants to
help mothers breast-feed and to eliminate or help with lactation
problems. Perhaps women who choose not to breast-feed should rethink
their decision and then will not have to feel guilty.</TE>

<TE>   What a relief for me to read a balanced perspective on the
breast-versus-bottle issue. The breast-feeding extremists have become
as rigid and dogmatic as the "scientific" formula proponents were in
past decades, and as usual, we mothers are caught in the cross-fire.
So now, instead of asking them (or anyone) what I should do, the only
question I have is: When will "experts" stop provoking mothers' guilt
to further their own agendas?</TE>

<LD>Re: "Seniors, You're on Your Own" (June 3), which reported on one of
the most vexing issues to confront the nation: How will the growing
number of retirees pay for their long-term care in an environment
where Medicare and Medicaid are increasingly underfunded by the
federal government?</LD>
<LD>   The American Health Care Assn. has reached two initial
conclusions. First, while Congress continues to endorse and support
the growth of the long-term care insurance market, it must begin
doing so in a way that provides assistance to the poor. This
assistance must not just take the form of accessing insurance, but
must also help in maintaining that insurance. We believe changes in
the tax code can accomplish this important objective. Second, we
believe a public/private program should be created to help all
Americans prepare for their long-term care needs. This should entail
combining changes in the tax code with a restructuring of public
long-term care financing and, significantly, coordinating care at the
federal level.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Drive around L.A. today and you won't go far without seeing a studio
offering taekwondo, karate or some other form of martial art to
white-robed kids. The signs in the windows often promise
self-confidence, respect and physical fitness.</LD>
<LD>   With summer vacation upon us, many parents are looking for a
fitness activity to help get their kids off the couch and away from
the television or video games. Ideally, the activity will be
something that children will stick with beyond the summer. But what
if it could also make your children better listeners? And what if it
could help kids who are hyperactive or diagnosed with attention
deficit disorder?</LD>
<LD>   Although there is no scientific proof that martial arts training
will make your kids lose weight, listen more attentively or focus
their attention, some physicians and others believe that such classes
are well suited to accomplishing these goals.</LD>
<TE>   "When a child learns about his body and also learns discipline, it
can't help but benefit all of his everyday habits, ranging from
schoolwork to eating," says Naomi Neufeld, a pediatric
endocrinologist who runs KidShape, a Los Angeles-based childhood
weight management program.</TE>
<TE>   "Martial arts is about many things," adds Bong Kyung Kim, a
taekwondo grand master who runs the Beverly Hills Martial Arts
Center. "There is a mental aspect, a physical aspect and a spiritual
aspect. Children are learning physical skills but, equally important,
they are learning respect, a sense of order and self-confidence. And,
of course, they are having fun."</TE>
<TE>   Fun, of course, is key to finding a physical activity that kids
will want to stick with.</TE>
<TE>   Every day at 5 p.m., dozens of kids from 4 to 13 race up the
stairs at the Beverly Hills Martial Arts Center to practice taekwondo
(translated as "the art of fist and foot"). A gong chimes, and a
flurry of youthful energy races across the room as kids form perfect
lines based on their ranking. The highest-ranked student leads the
class in a short series of verbal exercises that help the students
focus before the workout begins.</TE>
<TE>   The workout is an hour of running, jumping, stretching, kicking
and nonstop action that brings to mind dozens of little Jackie Chans
on the loose.</TE>
<TE>   Alex and Arthur Bane, ages 8 and 10, have been studying martial
arts since they were 4, taking classes with their mother, Tamara
Bane, an ex-dancer. They have regularly attended classes three to
five times a week for several years, and all three have earned the
rank of black belt. (Children and adults are tested and judged
separately, based on appropriate benchmarks for their age and skill
levels.)</TE>
<TE>   "One thing I love about martial arts," says Tamara Bane, "is that
the kids are only competing with themselves. In many other sports you
not only have a great deal of pressure from the other kids, but you
can face horrible criticism and backlash from the other parents if
your child is not as good an athlete."</TE>
<TE>   Some doctors are now looking at martial arts for their health
benefits, such as weight management. KidShape's Neufeld notes that
about 80% of Los Angeles children fail the yearly exam for the
President's Council on Physical Fitness.</TE>
<TE>   While many factors play a role in weight control, exercise is at
the top of the list. Neufeld believes martial arts are especially
effective for getting kids in shape because experience has shown her
that children who get involved in these programs tend to stick with
them. Moreover, unlike seasonal sports such as baseball or football,
kids can practice martial arts year-round.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to weight control, many martial arts schools work with
individuals who have physical or emotional handicaps. These
challenges can range from Down syndrome to attention deficit
disorder. Some children's therapists have noted that children labeled
hyperactive or challenged by ADD are responding positively to the
type of training that martial arts programs offer.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Armstrong, a Sonoma County psychologist and author of "The
Myth of the ADD Child" (Penguin / Plume, 1997), writes in his book
that martial arts skills "can serve as a wonderful vehicle for the
training of children who have been labeled as hyperactive or ADD. For
kids who seem to be at the mercy of their own chaotic energy systems,
these sports offer a chance to begin directing physical and mental
energy in a focused way."</TE>
<TE>   While Armstrong acknowledges the presence of neurological
differences and the use of medication as one "tool" in treatment, he
also suggests that there are other physical and environmental
treatments for children diagnosed with ADD that might be effective.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Frederick Friedman, a Los Angeles pediatrician, also believes
in the value of martial arts programs for children, regardless of
whether they have been diagnosed with ADD. "In a team sport," he
says, "a kid is naturally going to get less attention and too often
just gets stuck out in left field. In martial arts the teachers are
setting up a very structured environment so the child's attention is
focused."</TE>
<TE>   Friedman notes, however, that while martial arts may help a
child's self-assurance and concentration skills during class, it's
not clear whether those skills carry over into the child's daily
life.</TE>
<TE>   While there are dozens of styles of martial arts, the three
primary schools that have made their way from Asia into American
culture are taekwondo (Korean), karate (Japanese) and kung-fu
(Chinese).</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese programs tend to be more traditional, and rarely are
schools open to children younger than 13. While taekwondo and karate
are similarly structured, with a belt system in which students must
learn different techniques at each level to progress, it is possible
to move more quickly under the Korean system.</TE>
<TE>   Children with focus and discipline can earn a first-degree black
belt at any age after three years of study. In the Japanese system of
karate, junior black belts are rarely awarded before age 10, and
usually only after a student has been studying for at least six
years.</TE>
<TE>   While competitions exist in both sports, most teachers do not
emphasize this aspect at a young age. "It is a danger to have
students thinking about competition," says Kim. "The value then
becomes about winning instead of your own accomplishments. We live in
a world full of competition. There is plenty of that. It is much
harder to find the time and the place that a child can develop and
focus on more spiritual elements."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, martial arts are not for every child. A child who is
uncomfortable with contact sports--or parents who can't bear to watch
their child getting bumped and bruised--may opt for a different
activity. Friedman, however, says he doesn't believe that martial
arts are any more likely to produce injuries than other sports. "I've
personally never seen [an injury] that came from a class," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "It was always the horsing around and just having some extra fun
after class that brought the kids to my office."</TE>

<LD>THE LANGUAGE OF CELLS:</LD>
<LD>   Life as Seen Under the</LD>
<LD>   Microscope</LD>
<TE>   By Spencer Nadler</TE>
<TE>   Random House</TE>
<TE>   200 pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When a doctor chooses to work in the lab instead of the
examination room, some physicians say, it's probably because he
doesn't have a good bedside manner. That's a bit unfair, especially
to someone like Spencer Nadler. He's a surgical pathologist with a
poet's heart--a delver into the mysteries of disease who has spent
his career peering into a microscope without losing his passion for
human stories.</TE>
<TE>   Technological breakthroughs made pathology an exciting field when
he started in the 1960s, but Nadler says, "I have missed, too, what I
still remember of the quiet heroics of everyday people who, in the
strange confines of a hospital, struggled in bloody arenas to
maintain their dignity. To that end, after so many years, I still
seek out patient bonding."</TE>
<TE>   "The Language of Cells" is the result of that search, a collection
of compelling, vivid essays about the people, and their illnesses,
whom Nadler has encountered "during my infrequent excursions into
clinical life."</TE>
<TE>   Sensitive, often charming, always informative, these essays give
us portraits of how patients' lives and their cells have been
affected by cancer, obesity, sickle cell anemia, Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's disease and the inevitable onset of aging and death.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the book we meet Hanna, a breast cancer patient who uses
her imagination to fight the disease and who has a determination that
mirrors her malignancy's:</TE>
<TE>   " 'Why don't they just die? ... Don't cancer cells self-destruct?'</TE>
<TE>   'Apparently not. Cancer somehow disables the program. The cells
forget how to die.'</TE>
<TE>   'Well, so do I,' she says, a faint smile stealing across her
face."</TE>
<TE>   Not a minor bit of irony, this is a metaphor of how a patient's
drive for survival resembles the behavior of cells. In fact, it is an
important theme throughout the book, showing us how the cellular side
of medicine is intimately related to people's lives.</TE>
<TE>   Moments of poignant realization abound in "The Language of Cells,"
and for the light it sheds on the humanity of disease, it should be
found on every physician's shelf right alongside the books on gross
anatomy.</TE>

<HD>Dietary Tack Can Help Dash Hypertension</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN FIELDING and VALERIE ULENE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you have high blood pressure--and you're tired of hearing messages
about what you shouldn't eat (such as salt)--you'll like the DASH
diet.</LD>
<LD>   The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet emphasizes a
variety of healthful foods--grains and grain products, fruits,
vegetables and low-fat dairy foods. In a recent study involving more
than 450 men and women (some with hypertension and some with normal
blood pressure), the diet was found to significantly reduce blood
pressure, even when participants didn't decrease salt intake.</LD>
<LD>   In the study, researchers compared the diet with two other eating
plans--the "typical" American diet and the typical American diet with
added fruits and vegetables. All three diets contained about the same
amount of sodium and a similar number of calories. Within two weeks,
the average systolic blood pressure dropped among participants who
followed the diet enriched with fruits and vegetables. But it fell
even further in those who followed the DASH diet.</LD>
<TE>   Researchers are still not sure why the DASH diet works, but blood
pressure experts suspect it's related to the high levels of certain
minerals, such as potassium, magnesium and calcium, in the grains,
fruits and vegetables, and dairy products. The diet contains up to
two times as much of these nutrients as are typically consumed by the
average American. (For example, a person eating 2,000 calories per
day on the DASH diet consumes about 4,700 milligrams of potassium per
day; at that caloric level, the typical American diet contains only
about 2,600 milligrams.) The diet is also rich in vitamin C, a
nutrient that has been shown to help lower blood pressure in numerous
studies.</TE>
<TE>   This is not to suggest that the DASH diet should be used as an
alternative to cutting back on salt. Ideally, it should be used in
addition to it.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers proved the value of this combination approach with a
second study that is often referred to as DASH-Sodium. For three
months, study participants ate either a typical American diet or the
DASH eating plan. Each month, the amount of sodium in both diets was
changed, and blood pressures were measured. The results: The lower
the sodium (salt) intake--on either diet--the lower the average blood
pressure. But the greatest lowering of pressure was seen when the
DASH diet was combined with strict sodium restriction. In men and
women with hypertension, this combination produced an average drop in
systolic blood pressure (the top number) of almost 12 points.</TE>
<TE>   The benefits of the DASH diet aren't limited to people with high
blood pressure. It also lowers blood pressure in those with
supposedly "normal" levels and could help prevent hypertension from
developing. Given the fact that Americans age 55 and over have a 90%
likelihood of developing hypertension during their lifetime, more
people should consider starting the DASH diet before they develop
high blood pressure.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the benefits of the diet don't even appear to be limited
to its effect on blood pressure. In addition to lowering blood
pressure, the diet can also help reduce blood cholesterol levels
(which is not surprising, considering that the diet is low in
fat--particularly saturated fat--and cholesterol, and rich in fiber).
Compared with people eating a typical American diet, those on the
DASH diet have lower total and LDL (or "bad") cholesterol levels. In
one study, total cholesterol levels were reduced by about 7% and LDL
cholesterol levels by about 9%. And although HDL (or "good")
cholesterol levels also dropped, the overall effect on blood lipids
was thought to be beneficial.</TE>
<TE>   Men and women following the DASH diet also had lower levels of
homocysteine in their blood, which may reduce their risk of
cardiovascular disease. (High levels of this amino acid have been
linked to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.) The lower
levels of homocysteine are probably related to the fact that the DASH
diet is rich in folic acid, which--along with some other B
vitamins--can have this effect.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, as with any diet, the DASH diet is difficult for
many people. Even when it is strictly adhered to, its effect--though
helpful--is frequently not enough. That's why other methods of
controlling blood pressure, such as weight loss and exercise, should
be used in conjunction with the diet, and why many people
(particularly those with moderate or severe hypertension) still
require medications.</TE>

menus and simple recipes), contact the National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute at (301) 592-8573 or visit its Web site at

<HD>Skip the Doctor on the Way to the Lab</HD>
<DH>Direct-access blood tests offer consumers convenience and
privacy. Such screenings, however, do not render physicians moot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENEDICT CAREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Getting a "simple" blood test can seem about as simple as getting a
mortgage approved. There's the 20-minute schlep (minimum) to the
doctor's office and back; the long purgatory of the waiting room;
then the hour or so shuttling among doctors, nurses and medical
technicians, only to learn--after half the day is blown--that the
results won't be ready for a week or more, sometimes requiring
another appointment.</LD>
<LD>   To which many Americans now say: Forget it. Commercial testing
labs and Internet brokers have begun to bypass doctors, selling
medical tests straight to consumers. So-called direct-access testing
has a drive-through appeal: Roll up a sleeve, slap down a credit card
or cash, and choose from a menu of 30 to 50 tests. The results are
often available the next day, on the Web; no doctor's order is
required, and no insurer is involved.</LD>
<LD>   "Time and convenience are quality-of-life issues for me," said
Jeannette Leach, 49, a research scientist in Boulder, Colo., who has
ordered tests to help monitor her thyroid condition. "The lab I visit
is located on one of the roads I use to drive to work. It opens at 8
a.m., and at 8:01 I'm there, and 10 minutes later I'm on my way to
work."</LD>
<TE>   "The number of people doing this right now is very small, we
think," said Dr. Bruce Friedman, a professor of pathology at the
University of Michigan School of Medicine, "but it should have
enormous appeal to the sort of health-conscious consumers who are
most enthusiastic about exercising control over their own health
care."</TE>
<TE>   Limited health assessments, such as stroke screenings and
blood-pressure checks, are increasingly being offered at pharmacies
and grocery stores, and full-body X-ray scans have proved so popular
that they're now available at some malls. Most recently, the world's
largest diagnostic lab, Quest Diagnostics Inc., opened direct-testing
locations in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Maryland and Virginia and
has partnered with Giant Food, an East Coast grocery chain, to sell a
range of blood and other tests in stores.</TE>
<TE>   So far, direct testing appears to be growing most on the Internet.
Demand has not been strong at walk-in outlets, said Jondavid Klipp,
managing editor of Laboratory Industry Report, who has surveyed some
of the labs. Quest would not disclose the number of tests it has
done. Yet Web-based outfits have seen increased sales in the first
half of this year. HealthcheckUSA of San Antonio reports doing
several thousand tests this year, a 200% increase in sales since
January 2001. Online outfits contract with local labs to collect
blood or other samples, then have the fluids shipped out of state for
testing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Web Sites Skirt Laws</TE>
<TE>   Although many states, including California, have laws prohibiting
labs from performing most tests without a doctor's authorization,
direct-to-consumer Web sites aren't subject to such laws if their
labs are located outside those states.</TE>
<TE>   "What's happening is that many clinical lab functions are going
onto the Web, and they are increasingly available to consumers, no
matter where they live," said Friedman. Once the companies have
invested in the cost of developing a Web presence, researchers say,
it's inevitable that they will continue to expand the range of tests
they offer, from simple blood tests to urinalysis and ultrasound
imaging for osteoporosis.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, several state legislatures--including
California's--have moved to expand the number and type of tests
available without a doctor's order. Last year Gov. Gray Davis signed
a bill allowing labs to perform without a doctor's authorization any
test currently available as an at-home kit, including pregnancy,
cholesterol and glucose screenings.</TE>
<TE>   According to Friedman, who has studied the emergence of the
e-laboratory, direct testing has two principal attractions: easy
access and privacy. Health-conscious people who want tests more
frequently than their doctors order are one category of users. So are
people who want to check their blood and urine before submitting to a
drug test. The list also includes people who want to test themselves
for HIV or hepatitis C anonymously, or who want to peek at certain
values--such as cholesterol levels--in private, before shopping for
health insurance or changing plans.</TE>
<TE>   The most popular tests are standard blood panels, which include
anywhere from 12 to 20 different measures, from cholesterol and
glucose levels to markers of liver and kidney function. These panels
are often ordered as part of routine physical exams, but the demand
for them suggests another category of user: affluent and busy people
who want to have a peek at their test scores without going to visit a
physician.</TE>
<TE>   As a rule, direct-access testing labs strongly advise their
customers to consult with a doctor. "We have been very clear that
this testing is no substitute for seeing a doctor," said Hughes
Bakewell, vice president of consumer health at Quest. "We see our
service as a complement to regular doctor visits."</TE>
<TE>   Leach, who has had a standard panel of about 20 blood tests
through HealthcheckUSA, including measures of thyroid function, said
that's the way she has used the results. "As soon as I get them, a
copy goes to my primary-care physician and my endocrinologist, who
treats my thyroid condition," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there's no guarantee that most direct-access customers will
consult a professional, and that's the problem, doctors say. "The
first rule of medicine is: Do no harm," said Dr. Linda Rosenstock,
dean of the UCLA School of Public Health, "and here we have a
situation where people may be getting false assurances about their
health and not making follow-up appointments when they should be, or
becoming very anxious about a test result when there's no need to
be."</TE>
<TE>   The PSA screening for prostate cancer in men is a good example.
Doctors consider PSA readings below 4 to be normal, between 4 and 10
to be slightly elevated, and above 10 to be strong evidence of
cancer. But at least half of the men who score above 4 don't have the
cancer, and around 20% of those who have normal scores do develop
cancer. In many cases the best way to use the test, many doctors
believe, is to track the change in its value over time--not to relax
or panic based on a single result.</TE>
<TE>   For that matter, not everyone understands what a "normal" result
is. According to Dr. Carolyn Clancy, acting director of the U.S.
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which researches health
care quality and patient safety, a normal test score is one that
falls within the range where 95% of healthy people score. The other
5% are perfectly healthy people whose levels are naturally higher or
lower than this range.</TE>
<TE>   "For that type of person, the result they get is not abnormal at
all for them, but they have no way to know that," said Clancy. "I
would be concerned about anyone who had one of these results and was
waiting for a doctor to return a call. They could be waiting as much
as a week, and the whole time they're trying to figure out if they
need to make a will, or what."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tests Present a Puzzle</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most popular tests available by direct access are
widely accepted as authoritative evidence of underlying disease:
cholesterol for heart disease risk; glucose levels for diabetes risk;
and markers for liver and kidney function. Other tests often present
people with a difficult puzzle, however.</TE>
<TE>   For example, labs often check levels of homocysteine, an amino
acid associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
Unfortunately, said Clancy, no one knows exactly what to do about
those levels, or how much difference it makes to reduce them. "If we
found out that redheaded people were more likely get heart disease,
well, what could we do about it?" she said.</TE>
<TE>   That's why public-health researchers believe that direct testing
is perhaps best reserved for people who understand the limits of lab
work. Not only can "abnormal" results be wrong, in which case they
should be repeated, they say, but many tests are crude and should be
treated that way. One example is the CA-125 test to screen for
ovarian cancer. "This is a test that many women ask for, and we tell
them it's not very sensitive," said Vaughan. "They need to know that
before seeing results."</TE>
<TE>   No medical association recommends CA-125 screening, and for good
reason, said Dr. David Atkins, staff director of U.S. Preventive
Services Task Force, an independent panel that evaluates screening
procedures. For one thing, standards for evaluating CA-125 levels may
vary from lab to lab. For another, the false-alarm rate is very high.
In a recent study among more than 10,000 women age 45 and older,
English researchers found that 468 had elevated CA-125 levels.
Further testing identified 29 who appeared to be good candidates for
surgery, but it turned out that only six of those who had surgery
actually had the cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "For every woman who had cancer, four more went for surgery who
didn't need it," said Atkins. In all, only about one out of the 100
women who tested positive actually had the cancer. Because ovarian
cancer is uncommon, Atkins said, even tests that look accurate on
paper will generate a lot of false positives. "You can think of it
like a car alarm: Very rarely when it goes off is someone actually
breaking into the car," he said. "In this case, women need to know
that if they test positive the follow-up testing is not only
inconvenient but invasive."</TE>
<TE>   Many researchers agree that some people with special conditions
could benefit from quick, convenient testing--those with high
cholesterol who are monitoring the effects of diet, for example, or
people with a thyroid problem who need to check levels of thyroid
hormone. At the same time, anyone who has his or her blood tested
regularly is bound to get a few abnormal results--some of them
mistakes and some not. That's when it's crucial to have a physician's
number handy.</TE>
<TE>   "The doctor is the one person who can take all this information
and actually tell you not only what it means, but what to do about
it--or not do," said Dr. Anna R. Graham, president of the American
Society of Clinical Pathology. The same is true of any test, she
said. "Doctors are in a position not only to realize life-threatening
value but give immediate advice for the patient, or a referral to a
specialist."</TE>

<HD>Judge Rules Against Fees for Beef Marketing</HD>
<DH>Courts: Government is ordered to stop collecting funds from
farmers for research and promotion campaigns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>ABERDEEN, S.D.</DL>
<LD>A federal judge has ruled that fees collected for the "Beef: It's
What's for Dinner" advertising campaign violate the free-speech
rights of cattle producers, in the latest case in a long-standing
dispute among farmers.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Charles B. Kornmann ordered the government to
stop collecting the fee of $1 per head of cattle, which amounts to
about $88 million per year, to fund the research and promotion
campaign. The order takes effect July 15.</LD>
<LD>   "I am disappointed by the ruling," U.S. Agriculture Secretary Ann
M. Veneman said in a statement. "We are consulting with the
Department of Justice to determine the next steps." The department
could seek an injunction to permit fee collections beyond July 15.</LD>
<TE>   Farmers have complained for years that forced funding of pitches
for products ranging from California raisins to milk to cheese
violates their rights to free speech.</TE>
<TE>   A Supreme Court decision last year put advertising campaigns for
agricultural products further in doubt, ruling that farmers should
not be forced to fund generic marketing campaigns. Though the case
involving mushroom growers in Tennessee resulted in a 6-3 ruling, the
effect on disputes elsewhere was unclear.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the court sided with growers of California peaches and
nectarines, who disputed charges to pay for a series of ads touting
the fruit. California has its own programs for promoting farm
products. Kornmann ruled Friday that the 1985 Beef Promotion and
Research Act is unconstitutional, because "beef producers cannot be
compelled to finance advertising programs with which they disagree,"
according to Billy Perrin, president of the Kansas City, Mo.-based
Livestock Marketing Assn. The association, joined by nine ranchers
and other groups, challenged the law.</TE>
<TE>   The decision affects up to 1 million U.S. farmers and ranchers who
raise cattle. Last year the sale of cattle and calves generated $40.4
billion in income, or 20% of the $202 billion in U.S. agricultural
sales. Most opposition to the program is from small ranchers; larger
producers support it.</TE>
<TE>   Perrin, a rancher and livestock dealer from Hugo, Okla., said the
advertising campaign made "no distinction between U.S. and foreign
beef," and that restaurants or grocery chains also benefited from the
promotion at the farmers' expense.</TE>
<TE>   The Agriculture Department, which has allowed farm cooperatives to
market various products since the Great Depression, regards all such
programs as useful tools to help boost consumption of farm products.</TE>
<TE>   "The beef promotion program in particular has helped beef demand
to increase and has contributed to U.S. beef exports," Veneman said.</TE>
<TE>   The National Cattlemen's Beef Assn., a Colorado-based trade group
that supports the promotion fee, was not available to comment Sunday.</TE>

<HD>Fires Cool Recreation Business</HD>
<DH>Some outdoors companies see sales slump as blazes rage in
U.S. parklands</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This was supposed to be a bang-up summer for outdoor activity, with
the economy still wobbly and many Americans opting to stick closer to
home. National parks still are predicting a jump in attendance this
year.</LD>
<LD>   But the wildfires whipping through the nation's forests have begun
to hurt sales at some recreation businesses, casting a cloud that
could persist through the summer and fall as the threat of fires
continues.</LD>
<LD>   Known World Guide Service Inc. in Velarde, N.M., which arranges
hiking and river rafting trips, said its revenue is down 70% this
year. BSR Sport in Glenwood, Colo., which sells bikes and other
sporting gear, is having its worst year ever. Outdoor equipment store
Mountain Miser Ltd. in Englewood, Colo., has seen sales slide 6% so
far this year, and owner David Goodman expects they'll fall further.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody's going to be setting any records this
year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although it's too soon to determine the overall economic effect of
the fires, the Outdoor Industry Assn. said sales are likely to suffer
further if the fires keep raging--or if more crop up--prompting
vacationers to change plans.</TE>
<TE>   Weaker sales in areas near the fires, and the worries they are
causing elsewhere--including among Southern California recreational
equipment retailers--are particularly disappointing because they're
coming at the peak of a key selling season for outdoor equipment
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Kent, Wash.-based Recreational Equipment Inc. generates about 25%
of its annual sales from mid-May through mid-July, spokesman Mike
Foley said. And REI's second-largest concentration of stores is in
Colorado, where the season's worst fires have been.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an important couple of weeks for us," Foley said.</TE>
<TE>   Farther from the fires, some retailers are wary, partly because
scant rainfall has left many of the West's most inviting areas
vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   "What concerns us is it is so early in the season," said John
Mead, president of San Diego-based Adventure 16 Inc. Sales have been
flat so far this year for the company's five stores, all located in
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping for the best," Mead said, "and preparing for the
worst."</TE>
<TE>   Wildfires can create a public-perception nightmare for businesses
in this industry, making people less eager to venture into parklands,
said Frank Hugelmeyer, president of the Outdoor Industry Assn., which
has more than 4,000 members nationwide. For example, a large but
isolated fire in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming a couple of
years ago hurt outdoor equipment sales in Idaho and Montana, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got a lot more people in recreation areas struggling this
year because of the drought," Hugelmeyer said. "We know there are
about 250 small businesses in the Pike's Peak area [in Colorado] that
are affected by the forest closure.</TE>
<TE>   "A major threat that we were concerned about at the beginning of
the year has become a reality," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Some businesses in this industry have been optimistic partly
because of the terrorism worries and other bad news over the last
nine months.</TE>
<TE>   When times get tough, people gravitate toward the great outdoors,
hoping to soothe frazzled nerves by reconnecting with nature,
industry insiders said.</TE>
<TE>   A poll conducted by the Outdoor Industry Assn. in October showed
that 91% of Americans older than 15 believed that national parks were
the safest place for a getaway, Hugelmeyer said.</TE>
<TE>   "In a way, the fires are [sending] a different message," he said.
"When you see huge, 200-foot flames, you go, 'I'm going to bring my
kids into that? You've got to be kidding.' "</TE>
<TE>   But most of the nation's parklands are not ablaze, and most
campgrounds remain open. Further, many retailers--especially those
far removed from the fires--are feeling no effect. Some still predict
a strong year.</TE>
<TE>   Chamber of commerce groups highlight the bright side, because the
prospect of fire in wooded areas is about as welcome as a shark at
the beach.</TE>
<TE>   But there is no question the fires have damped hopes for business
owners in some areas, including where hope was most needed.</TE>
<TE>   Small businesses surveyed in northern New Mexico, the part of the
state hardest hit by the fires, said they expect sales to plummet
more than 50% compared with last year, said Patrick Gannon, a
representative for the New Mexico Economic Development Department.
Gannon submitted that information to a state task force Friday in
hopes of procuring low-interest federal loans for the businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Debbie Katers, who owns BSR Sport in Colorado with her husband,
Steve, said sales at the store still haven't bounced back from Sept.
11, partly because of a miserable snow season.</TE>
<TE>   Located in a community that is dependent on tourism, BSR Sport
caters largely to locals, who haven't been spending, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's so afraid to spend money because we just don't know
what's going to happen," Katers said.</TE>
<TE>   Making matters worse, June is when she has more bills than usual
to pay, Katers said, because she recently stocked the store for the
summer.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the [month] that's supposed to take everybody out of the
hole," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Mountain Miser owner Goodman said profit should be better than
last year, even if sales drop as much as 15%, as he predicts. That's
because he trimmed costs after Sept. 11, including laying off two of
the 10 workers in his store.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if we can remain 10% to 15% down from last year, I would
call that a pretty good year, based on the situation right now," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Gasoline Prices Rise Less Than 1 Cent</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gas prices rose by less than a penny in the last two weeks because of
higher prices in Western states and a temporary slowdown in gas
production.</LD>
<LD>   The average price nationwide, including all gasoline grades and
taxes, was about $1.44 a gallon on Friday, according to the Lundberg
survey of 8,000 stations.</LD>
<LD>   That was up 0.65 cent a gallon since June 7.</LD>
<TE>   "Since wholesale buying prices are already in a downward
correction, further retail hikes may not occur," analyst Trilby
Lundberg said Sunday. "Nationally, the pump price direction will be
determined mostly by OPEC's upcoming crude oil production decision
and whether OPEC members and cooperating countries adhere to agreed
quotas."</TE>
<TE>   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet
Wednesday in Vienna to discuss output levels and pricing.</TE>
<TE>   OPEC supplies about one-third of the world's oil, and its periodic
meetings can have a profound effect on prices.</TE>
<TE>   Prices dropped in most regions of the country. But price hikes in
some Western states offset falling national prices.</TE>
<TE>   Current prices remain about 19 cents below gas prices a year ago
at this time.</TE>
<TE>   The national weighted average price of gasoline, including taxes,
at pumps Friday was about $1.41 per gallon for regular, $1.51 for
mid-grade and $1.60 for premium.</TE>

<HD>GE Ends Bid for Sony Life Insurance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>General Electric Co. dropped out of the race to buy Sony Corp.'s life
insurance arm after talks foundered, officials at the Japanese firm
said.</LD>
<LD>   The failure opens the way for Dutch insurer Aegon and Prudential
Financial Inc. of the U.S. to buy a stake in a company Sony values at
as much as $6.4 billion, the officials said. The winner would get a
sales network of 4,500 agents in the world's biggest life insurance
market.</LD>
<LD>   Sony Chairman Nobuyuki Idei wants to sell Sony Life Insurance Co.
to raise cash and focus on returning the company's consumer
electronics business to profit. Sony had a group net loss of $45
million in the three months to March 31 as losses widened at its
electronics business, which accounts for about 70% of sales.</LD>
<TE>   "We still are looking for potential alliances with foreign
insurance companies," said Kei Sakaguchi, a Sony spokesman in Tokyo,
declining to name any companies.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Norbom, president of General Electric Japan Ltd., declined to
comment. Aegon spokesman Gijsbert Siertsema and Prudential
spokeswoman Theresa Miller wouldn't comment.</TE>
<TE>   Sony Life's first-year premiums per agent were the highest in
Japan last year, aided by the company's brand name and trained sales
agents in an industry used to employing homemakers part time to sell
policies to friends and relatives.</TE>
<TE>   The unit also avoided investments in the sagging real estate
market made by many rivals, making its assets more attractive.</TE>
<TE>   "GE wanted a majority stake to acquire Sony's excellent sales
force," said Tsuyoshi Segawa, an equity strategist at Shinko
Securities Co.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be that internal opposition forced Sony to cancel a sale
offer, even though it was Sony that sought an alliance with GE."</TE>
<TE>   General Electric took control of Toho Mutual Life Insurance Co. in
March 2000 after it failed. The company also controls Saison Life
Insurance Co. Aegon has no presence in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Sony President Kunitake Ando in April denied that the company
planned to sell the entire unit after receiving an e-mail from a top
insurance salesman saying to do so would betray Akio Morita, the late
founder of the world's No. 2 consumer electronics company.</TE>

<HD>Probe Sought of Possible Shredding</HD>
<DH>Telecom: A key investor in Global Crossing asks federal
agencies to look into claims the firm destroyed documents after
Chapter 11 filing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd. and a major shareholder settled differences over
how the struggling fiber-optic network builder preserves records, but
the investor said Sunday it is asking Congress and federal agencies
to investigate claims that the company already has shredded stacks of
documents.</LD>
<LD>   The company acknowledged that some shredding occurred since it
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late January, but it
said the destroyed material was already on computer files and was
unrelated to pending government investigations of the company's
accounting practices or securities fraud cases.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, one of
dozens of investors that have filed securities fraud lawsuits against
Global Crossing and its executives, said they have asked a
congressional committee, the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the Justice Department to look into shredding claims.</LD>
<TE>   "We can't do more than call it to their attention and hope they
pick it up," said Jay Eisenhofer, the Ohio pension fund's lead
lawyer. None of the federal bodies has indicated whether it will look
into the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   The requests were made Friday night, immediately after the
shredding claims were inadvertently released publicly in Bankruptcy
Court filings.</TE>
<TE>   The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Jan. 28 in
the fourth-largest bankruptcy case in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Ferrera, a Washington-based lawyer for Global Crossing, said
he also notified the SEC in Los Angeles and Denver, federal
authorities and two congressional committees as soon as a court seal
on the issue was lifted late Friday. He said he also sent them copies
of court filings.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing has acknowledged that some shredding occurred in
outlying offices after a companywide e-mail was distributed Feb. 7
that instructed employees to retain all documents.</TE>
<TE>   That goes beyond allegations raised in depositions taken since
June 10 in the Ohio pension fund's lawsuit against the company. Two
Global Crossing employees said they heard a shredding machine
operating behind a closed storage room door in the company's Madison,
N.J., headquarters, but they said they did not see any shredding
occur. One saw the shredder after two employees in the room left.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrera said the documents destroyed in outlying offices--in
Rochester, N.Y., Detroit, Toronto and London--involved such
information as personnel records, slide presentation materials and
payroll check stock. All the information, though, already was on
computer files and on backup files, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We received zero information that any destroyed documents relate
to the government investigations or to the securities fraud cases,"
he said. "Of course, you can never be 100% certain about anything."</TE>
<TE>   Among the biggest concerns, Eisenhofer said, is that one of the
employees who allegedly shredded documents is the son-in-law of
Joseph Perrone, the executive vice president for finance who
allegedly devised the accounting methods that investors say inflated
revenue. These methods are currently under investigation by the SEC,
a congressional committee and an internal Global Crossing panel.</TE>
<TE>   "Perrone is a key defendant," Eisenhofer said.</TE>
<TE>   The depositions cite Perrone's son-in-law, Steve Scro, who has
denied shredding any documents.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhofer said lawyers and investigators for the investors now
will start routinely asking former employees and other witnesses
about any shredding they may have seen.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before midnight Friday, the pension fund and Global
Crossing agreed in talks with Bankruptcy Judge Robert E. Gerber about
additional steps the company would take to preserve records,
resolving a motion the fund had filed two weeks ago to create a
better system for collecting and maintaining records.</TE>
<TE>   "Up to now, they had not even collected many documents from the
individual defendants," Eisenhofer said.</TE>
<TE>   The company has taken "extraordinary efforts" since its Feb. 7
e-mail to preserve documents, Ferrera said. In six weeks, the company
spent more than $4 million, he said, to copy more than a million
documents and millions of e-mails, and it has turned over hundreds of
thousands of pages of documents to government agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody knows better than the SEC the document preservation effort
we made," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement late Friday, Global Crossing will give the
fund the names of any employees who have relevant information on
their computers and will store the copied computer information at the
offices of its New York bankruptcy lawyers. The company also will
copy computer information of others identified as possibly having
relevant information.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing also agreed to collect similar information from
all defendants, from current and past directors to employees at
subsidiaries.</TE>
<TE>   Incidents of shredding, Eisenhofer said, were "totally unexpected"
after widespread publicity over the massive document destruction at
failed Enron Corp. and its auditor, Arthur Andersen, which was
convicted earlier this month of obstruction of justice.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for investors in nearly 60 fraud lawsuits have been
interviewing dozens of former Global Crossing employees this year. In
her June 7 interview with the Ohio fund, laid-off employee Danuta
McLennan brought up a shredding incident that allegedly occurred in
mid-February.</TE>
<TE>   The fund's lawyers went to court June 10 for permission to depose
employees and investigate the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, lawyers for the fund and for Global Crossing had been
filing under seal depositions, declarations, motions and arguments
over destroyed documents. Though the two sides disagree over past
shredding incidents, they agreed on steps to preserve documents
better, thus ending the issue for now in the securities cases.</TE>

<HD>Investors Turning Away From Junk</HD>
<DH>Bonds: Yields near highs reached in early October as stocks
weaken and more companies see their debt ratings cut.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The junk bond market is living up to its moniker, and then some.</LD>
<LD>   Yields on corporate junk issues have surged in recent weeks,
driving down the bonds' prices and the share values of popular junk
mutual funds.</LD>
<LD>   The junk market's weakness has disappointed many investors who
viewed the sector as a smart alternative this year to risking money
in the stock market.</LD>
<TE>   The yield on an index of 100 junk issues tracked by KDP Investment
Advisors has soared from 10.41% on May 23 to 11.78% as of
Friday--even as yields on U.S. Treasury bonds have plummeted.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the junk market's woes stem from a number of
troubles. At the top of the list: Wall Street's latest slump, which
has driven key stock indexes close to the three-year lows they hit in
September.</TE>
<TE>   Junk bonds--that is, those rated below investment grade--tend to
trade more in tandem with equities than with other bonds. That's
because many heavily indebted companies' chief hope for paying off
debt is via new equity sales. If stocks don't recover, the financial
outlook for many junk-rated companies could suffer.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly we are tied to equities, and as they come down people are
re-pricing our bonds," said Raymond Kennedy, manager of a $13-billion
high-yield bond portfolio at Pacific Investment Management Co. in
Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Another big problem is mounting supply. The tally of "fallen
angels"--companies that drop from investment-grade debt ratings to
junk status--continues to rise. That is making the junk arena more of
a buyer's market, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's Investors Service said 58 companies worldwide, including
Tyco International Ltd., Dean Foods Co. and PanAmSat Corp., have been
cut from investment grade to junk this year. That is already close to
surpassing the total of 63 fallen angels in the two-year period of
1990-91, during the previous recession, Moody's said.</TE>
<TE>   "You've had a big jump in the number of junk bonds because of the
downgrades," said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's in New
York, which estimates the size of the junk bond market at about $575
billion. "That puts pressure on prices."</TE>
<TE>   An overriding issue for the junk market, as for the stock market,
is the pace of the economy's recovery and whether it will be fast
enough to lift many debt-laden companies out of the financial danger
zone.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the corporate bond market in general has been rocked
by the financial scandals that have engulfed Enron Corp., Global
Crossing Ltd., cable provider Adelphia Communications Corp. and
long-distance giant WorldCom Inc., among others.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom, with $30 billion of debt, had its credit rating slashed
again last week by Moody's and by Standard &amp; Poor's. S&amp;P cut the
company's long-term debt rating from BB to B-plus, four levels below
investment grade, citing the company's financial woes.</TE>
<TE>   The price of WorldCom's 7.5% bonds maturing in 2011 has plunged
from 94 cents on the dollar in early March to about 51 cents now.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just wondering where is the next Enron, the next Adelphia,"
said Jon Budish, a high-yield bond trader at brokerage Jefferies &amp;
Co. in New Jersey. "Investors are very skittish. What's happening
behind the curtain at these companies? It's hard to tell."</TE>
<TE>   Individual investors, who own about $90 billion in high-yield
bonds through junk mutual funds, have turned decidedly negative on
the sector. Junk funds took in about $13 billion in net new cash from
October through April, according to fund tracker Lipper Inc. But
investors, on balance, began to pull money out of junk funds in May,
Lipper said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, investors pulled a net $504 million from junk funds,
the biggest weekly outflow this year, according to estimates by AMG
Data Services in Arcata, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   But as junk yields near the highs reached in early October amid
the financial sell-off sparked by the terrorist attacks, some
analysts say investors brave enough to buy could pick up some
long-term bargains.</TE>
<TE>   "We said at the beginning of the month the high-yield market was
overvalued. It got ahead of itself in anticipation of an economic
recovery," said Christopher Garman, high-yield bond strategist at
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. "But we expect over the long haul for things to
improve."</TE>
<TE>   One potentially positive sign is that the number of junk-rated
companies that newly defaulted on their bonds (that is, stopped
paying interest owed) dropped to 15 in May from 23 in April, Moody's
said. The dollar value of newly defaulted bonds declined to $15.5
billion in May from $19.5 billion in April, the firm said.</TE>
<TE>   The annualized default rate on junk issues worldwide has been
stuck at 10.3% of total bonds outstanding for three months, Moody's
said. The firm expects the rate to fall to about 8% by year's end,
assuming the economy continues to recover.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts note that investors who bought junk bonds after the
market slumped in 1990 earned stellar returns in 1991. The average
junk bond mutual fund posted a total return (interest earned plus
price appreciation) of 37.1% in 1991 as the economy recovered,
interest rates fell and concerns about junk bond defaults subsided.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, some junk mutual funds still are posting
positive, albeit small, total returns, as interest earnings barely
offset share price losses. The Vanguard High-Yield Corporate fund is
up 1.3% year to date, for example. The Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield
fund is up 2.7%.</TE>
<TE>   But the Columbia High Yield fund is down 0.6%, and the Franklin
AGE High Income fund is down 2.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferies' Budish said timing is very important in the junk bond
market, and that the market could be nearing a buying point.</TE>
<TE>   But some market pros have been warning against investing in
long-term bonds of all types. Bond guru Bill Gross at Pimco in
Newport Beach advises investors to stick with shorter-term issues for
the foreseeable future because he thinks the U.S. inflation rate
could rise as the economy revives. That, in turn, could drive market
interest rates higher, hurting the value of longer-term bonds, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Gross said he is finding some bargains in beaten-down bonds of
some telecom and energy companies that are still rated investment
grade yet yield around 9%.</TE>
<TE>   But that may provide unwelcome competition for the junk market: If
investors can find substantial yields on issues that are investment
grade, they may be less interested in taking on the added risk that
comes with junk-rated securities.</TE>

<HD>Kmart to Cut Benefits to Former Execs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>TROY, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Kmart Corp. will stop paying 20 former executives $2 million a year
in special retirement benefits, the Detroit Free Press reported,
citing Chief Financial Officer Al Koch.</LD>
<LD>   The retailer pays about 220 former executives $4 million a year
through its supplemental executive retirement plan, the paper said.
It wants to continue paying about 200 people below the executive vice
president level, the paper said, citing Koch. A committee of the
company's bankers last week asked a Chicago bankruptcy court to stop
all payments, the paper said.</LD>
<LD>   Payments to some of the 20 former executives, who were executive
vice presidents or higher, were cut off June 1, the paper reported,
citing an unidentified Kmart spokeswoman. Others were informed in the
last few weeks that their payments would end July 1, the paper said.</LD>
<TE>   None of the most recent Kmart executives, who received $28.8
million in loans months before the company filed for bankruptcy
protection, is getting payments through the supplemental retirement
plan, the paper reported, citing Koch.</TE>

<HD>O'Neill Calls Scandals an 'Outrage'</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Treasury secretary urges better disclosure of
the cost of stock options, restraint on executive pay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said people should be
"outraged" by recent corporate scandals, as President Bush's
administration continues to seek a way to bolster investor
confidence.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neill, speaking on ABC's "This Week" program, said Bush would
sign legislation that revamps regulation of the accounting industry
if passed by Congress. He also called for better disclosure of the
cost of stock options and said corporate boards should show restraint
on executive pay.</LD>
<LD>   The administration has been emphasizing corporate responsibility
in recent weeks as financial markets react to scandals that have
enveloped corporations such as Enron Corp., Tyco International Ltd.
and Adelphia Communications Corp. Last Thursday, Bush urged a group
of executives to help eliminate an "overhang of mistrust" of public
companies. O'Neill made a similar appeal two days earlier.</LD>
<TE>   "I think anyone who's paying attention ought to be outraged about
the things that keep tumbling out," O'Neill said in the ABC
interview. "The amount of money some of these people have taken out
and gotten away with is just unconscionable."</TE>
<TE>   Concerns about corporate accounting have helped push the Dow Jones
industrial average down 7.7% this year and the S&amp;P 500 index down
14%.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill stopped short of saying whether Bush would sign a
Democratic-backed bill in the Senate to create an independent
accounting oversight board and impose new responsibilities on
corporate officers and Wall Street analysts. The
Republican-controlled House passed a competing version that gives an
oversight board fewer powers.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials have praised a Securities and Exchange
Commission proposal made last Thursday to create a Public
Accountability Board to oversee the accounting industry. The SEC plan
would be overtaken by any measure that passes both chambers of
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   On the question of whether accountants should be allowed to offer
clients auditing and consulting services, O'Neill said he favors
letting regulators decide rather than settling the matter in the law.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting firm Arthur Andersen was convicted June 15 of
obstructing a government investigation into Enron's finances before
the energy trader filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last
year.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill, the former chairman of Alcoa Inc., said boards of
directors should give closer scrutiny to how much their chief
executives get paid.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the corporate pay, especially the amount of money some of
these people have ripped off when they've been abusing their trust,
it's an outrage," the secretary said. He added that it's not the
government's role to regulate CEO pay.</TE>
<TE>   He also said investors deserve to know how much money is tied up
in stock options granted to executives by accounting for the options
as expenses on a company's balance sheet.</TE>
<TE>   That would make it "clear to every shareholder and every member of
the public how much prospective money is attached to the granting of
stock options," O'Neill said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has stepped up his rhetoric on corporate responsibility as
stock prices have faltered. Last week, he asked executives who are
members of the Business Roundtable to tighten corporate governance in
what executives described as an impassioned plea for leadership.
During a stop in Florida, the president said business "must clean up
its act" to restore faith in the markets.</TE>

<HD>Getting a Hand-Held on Fighting Crime</HD>
<DH>Software: ImageWare Systems' Crime Web Lite lets officers
use PDAs to check suspects' identities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sgt. Larry Bryant has the suspects he wants in the palm of his hand.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant, who oversees records for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department, can use his hand-held organizer to instantly search more
than a million mug shots by such variables as eye color, height and
even distinctive tattoos.</LD>
<LD>   So instead of driving back to the office to pull a file, Bryant
can look up a person's booking profile--including color photograph,
address and aliases--while out on the street.</LD>
<TE>   The software designed by San Diego-based ImageWare Systems Inc.
was introduced this year and is among the latest technology focusing
on local law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Although many new high-tech security features introduced since
Sept. 11 have been aimed at fighting terrorism, tools such as
ImageWare's are designed to take common criminals off the street.
Unlike federal law enforcement agencies, however, most local
departments don't have billion-dollar budgets.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when police and sheriff's departments are facing budget
cuts, law enforcement officials say they are unlikely to get money
for personal digital assistants over patrol cars.</TE>
<TE>   Several law enforcement agencies--including those in New York, San
Antonio and Las Vegas--already have adopted the PDA technology, said
ImageWare Chief Executive Jim Miller. Most departments, though, are
using less glitzy gadgets and installing the software on laptops in
patrol cars.</TE>
<TE>   The technology is used to help identify suspects giving false
names and those with outstanding warrants. When running an identity
check, officers can search a digital booking database for the
person's name or physical description and receive dozens of matching
mug shots. Departments without a wireless connection can search as
many as 50,000 records stored on a hand-held.</TE>
<TE>   "It was designed as a tool, not to say that's absolutely the
person that committed the crime but to help detectives narrow down
the list of suspects," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to law enforcement technology, ImageWare specializes
in digital photography and database management. Last month, the
company posted a first-quarter loss of $1.48 million, or 27 cents a
share, on revenue of $3.66 million, compared with a loss of $880,000,
or 21 cents a share, on revenue of $2.76 million a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department installed the software,
called Crime Web Lite, on laptops in patrol cars, giving officers
wireless access to three databases: its digital bookings, registrant
database (which consists of sex offenders, arsonists and narcotics
offenders) and elderly database (which includes the names and
descriptions of local Alzheimer's patients).</TE>
<TE>   Since installing the software about two months ago, officers have
been able to run more identity checks from the field, said Gordon
Brussow, senior systems engineer for Stanislaus County.</TE>
<TE>   "What we've found is that officers are saving time," Brussow said.
"If we were out in the outskirts of the county, we used to have to
drive all the way back to the office and have the clerk run and pull
photos."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, where sheriff's deputies typically receive
confirmation of a suspect's identity from a radio operator or a
text-based computer, three patrol stations--West Hollywood, Pico
Rivera and Cerritos--have installed the software in patrol car
laptops. The county is testing the PDA application.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the number of photographs in the system--Los Angeles
County adds about 1,000 mug shots a day, Bryant estimates--the
technology's success depends to some degree on law enforcement
agencies sharing information.</TE>
<TE>   "What we want to have is a federal repository for criminals and
suspected terrorists so we can check people quickly, and that's one
thing ImageWare could help do," said John Paulson, an analyst with
Paulson Investment Co. "Right now you have a lot of cities and some
states that have repositories and databanks that share information
with each other, but criminals and terrorists move around from state
to state.... You really need a national database."</TE>
<TE>   ImageWare's digital booking database software--which allows
officers to access digital booking databases on a secure
intranet--starts at around $30,000 to $40,000, depending on the
number of officers using the system. PDA licensing fees are several
hundred dollars per hand-held. The PDAs, which must run the Pocket PC
operating system, and wireless fees cost extra.</TE>
<TE>   Because hand-helds are expensive, law enforcement officials say it
is unlikely that each officer would be equipped with one. Probably
only those without access to computers--detectives and officers on
foot or bike patrol, for instance--would carry them.</TE>
<TE>   In the future, cameras could be added to PDAs so officers could
take photographs of suspects in the field. Those photographs could be
run against a facial-recognition system to identify suspects.</TE>

<HD>Sock Puppet Finds a New Home</HD>
<DH>Marketing: The spotted mascot for now-defunct Pets.com is
coming back as spokesdog for a car-financing firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANGELA WATERCUTTER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>It wasn't his first job choice, but at least the Pets.com sock puppet
hasn't joined the high-tech unemployment line.</LD>
<LD>   One of the most recognizable icons of the dot-com era has a new
agent and has inked a new deal for a California financing company.</LD>
<LD>   The puppet is now represented by Hakan &amp; Associates Inc., the same
company orchestrating the comeback of Taco Bell mascot Gidgey the
Famous Chihuahua. The black-and-white spotted dog puppet has just
signed on as the mascot for 1-800-Bar None, a Pleasanton-based
company that provides car financing for consumers with bad credit.</LD>
<TE>   The sock puppet has been out of work since online pet store
Pets.com was forced to shut down for lack of funds in November 2000.
Hakan Enterprises Inc. bought the rights to the icon in 2001 for
$125,000 during the Pets.com liquidation.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not often that a company will adopt the mascot of a defunct
company," said Christina Duffney of the Direct Marketing Assn. "Such
a company runs the risk of being associated with a business that
wasn't a success."</TE>
<TE>   Duffney said the sock puppet may be a different case since it
generated attention on its own and many consumers did not associate
it with Pets.com. That could work in 1-800-Bar None's favor, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be interesting to see how the business uses the puppet
and if they succeed in associating the puppet with the company," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The sock puppet will be featured in a series of television ads for
1-800-Bar None beginning in July.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Crouse, chief executive of 1-800-Bar None, said he hopes the
sock puppet will send the company's message--everyone deserves a
second chance--"cleverly and with a touch of humor."</TE>

<KH>EXECUTIVE ROUNDTABLE</KH>
<HD>Before Selling the Business, Consider Some Key Issues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Executive Roundtable is a weekly column by TEC International, an
organization of more than 7,000 business owners, company presidents
and chief executives. TEC members meet in small peer groups to share
their business experiences and help one another solve problems in a
round-table session. The following question and answer are a summary
of a discussion at a recent TEC meeting in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Question: I own a $10-million office furniture distributing
business. I keep reading in the papers about all these companies
being bought and sold, so I'm wondering if it would be a good idea to
sell mine. I love what I do and I look forward to coming to work
every day, but it just seems like now might be a good time to sell.
What do you think?</LD>
<TE>   Answer: Selling a business isn't like selling a used car. You
don't just hang a sign in the window and hope somebody drives by and
likes what they see.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it involves a complex process that requires careful
planning in three areas: preparing the business to get the best
price; determining your personal financial goals and objectives; and
figuring out what to do with your life after you sell.</TE>
<TE>   For many business owners, the third area proves to be the most
difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Despite your current level of satisfaction with running the
company, the fact that you're considering selling may indicate an
unspoken need to branch out into other areas or explore new
interests.</TE>
<TE>   That suggests the need for some personal introspection and
long-range life planning, said Bob Dabic, chief executive of
DabiCoaching in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "I would recommend going on some kind of personal retreat where
you can take time for quiet reflection and chart a course for the
next five to 10 years," he said. "Another option would involve simply
taking some time away from the business to explore other activities
and see if anything interests you more than your current situation.
If not, you may decide that running an office furniture distribution
company suits you best. But if you wait until you actually sell the
business to start exploring other options, you run the risk of not
knowing where you want to go or what you want to do."</TE>
<TE>   If exploring your options appeals to you, Karen Good, president of
EDP Systems Inc. in Irvine, recommended bringing in someone to run
the business for three to six months.</TE>
<TE>   "This approach offers several benefits," she said. "First, it
allows you to see how you like being away from the business. It may
feel like a breath of fresh air, or you may find that you can't wait
to get back. Either way, taking some time off gives you the ability
to step back, assess your current situation, make some decisions and
come up with a five-year plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Equally important, this approach allows you to see how the
company can run without you. When it comes time to sell, potential
buyers won't pay very much for a business that falls apart when
you're gone."</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to exploring personal financial goals, David La
Montagne, president of Vessel Assist Assn. of America in Newport
Beach, speaks highly of the "magic number" exercise, whereby you
decide on a precise figure that represents what it would take for you
to walk away from the business and live happily ever after.</TE>
<TE>   La Montagne said that doing this forces you to answer the kind of
questions that determine whether to sell, stay put or let someone
else run the business for you.</TE>
<TE>   "Interestingly, I have hit my magic number several times," he
said. "What I discovered is that the number kept getting bigger over
time. Yet, even though it changes, my magic number still provides an
anchor as I make important management decisions. For example, should
I grow the business like mad at the expense of the bottom line, or
should I spiff up the company and make the bottom line look good for
potential suitors? Without a magic number as a guidepost, those
questions become a lot harder to answer."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of whether you decide to sell the business, it wouldn't
hurt to get a professional evaluation of the company's worth and an
idea of the kind of people who might buy it.</TE>
<TE>   "Contact a couple of experienced business brokers or mergers and
acquisitions specialists and let them do a quick analysis of what
your company might sell for," said Steve Driscol, president of
Orange-based Thermal-Vac Technology Inc. "You may be pleasantly
surprised by what they say, or you may find that the company needs a
lot of work before you put it on the market.</TE>
<TE>   "It can often take several years to prepare a small private
company for sale--from a profit-and-loss standpoint as well as the
management structure. Now is the time to find out what your company
is currently worth and what it would take to reach your magic number.
If you don't prepare the business properly, you won't get top dollar
for it when the time comes to sell."</TE>

<HD>Activist Takes Aim at Internet Censorship</HD>
<DH>Web: Some criticize his efforts to disable filtering
software. But he cites minors' rights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LUIS CABRERA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>BELLEVUE, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Internet activist Bennett Haselton has made a name for himself by
helping minors disable filtering programs designed to block Web sites
that their parents deem offensive or pornographic.</LD>
<LD>   His Peacefire.org site offers free downloads and details methods
for circumventing filtering software that critics say also inevitably
blocks out a range of useful, even beneficial, Internet content.</LD>
<LD>   Yet while Haselton's crusade, launched six years ago while he was
a college student, has made him a hero among some Web-savvy minors,
he's something of a super-villain to filtering advocates.</LD>
<TE>   "He's being totally irresponsible," said Marc Kanter, marketing
director for Santa Barbara-based Solid Oak Software, which makes the
Cybersitter program.</TE>
<TE>   "When he started Peacefire, he was a kid himself," Kanter said.
"Basically, he was enticing minors into his beliefs and activities,
which was to undermine parents' rights. As an adult now, he should
know better than that."</TE>
<TE>   Haselton, a 23-year-old who simultaneously earned a bachelor's and
master's degree in mathematics from Vanderbilt University in
Nashville, says his objection to Net censorship is not born so much
of passion as logic.</TE>
<TE>   The criteria used by filter program designers are too arbitrary,
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, children should be able to view whatever Web page they
like, Haselton asserts. "I think intellectual development is one of
the fundamental human rights, and it's also a right that people under
18 have."</TE>
<TE>   Haselton was heartened by a federal appeals court decision last
month that struck down the Children's Internet Protection Act, ruling
that public libraries cannot be forced to install filtering software
to receive federal funding.</TE>
<TE>   But many who share Haselton's opposition to filtering consider his
position extreme.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not of the opinion that parents don't have any say where
children should go" on the Internet, said Chris Hunter, a University
of Pennsylvania researcher who testified on behalf of librarians at
the trial.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter worries that Haselton's line of thinking "that parents
shouldn't have a right to monitor their children's access lends fuel
to the other side saying that we're somehow uncaring about the
issue."</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Vanderbilt at age 20, Haselton went west to
work for Microsoft Corp. He left in January 2000, frustrated that he
was writing code rather than tracking bugs for the software giant.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to running Peacefire, Haselton now does battle with
purveyors of Internet spam and works to ferret out security flaws on
the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   He made about $15,000 in bounty from Netscape last year for
discovering flaws in the company's browser software. And last month
he gained notoriety for finding flaws with Anonymizer.com, a popular
Internet privacy service that lets Web surfers visit sites
anonymously.</TE>
<TE>   "That was pretty sophisticated," Anonymizer President Lance
Cottrell said. "The fact that he was able to find it is testimony to
what a clever fellow he is."</TE>
<TE>   Haselton also has won 10 of 14 small-claims cases and thousands of
dollars in judgments against senders of e-mail spam--though he has
yet to collect a cent. Washington is one of about two dozen states
with anti-spam laws.</TE>
<TE>   Haselton says that though he intends to keep sniffing out bugs for
bounty, he hopes to focus more of his energy on Peacefire's crusade.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something that practically nobody else is working on, and
only a couple of people in the world actually know as much about the
blocking software issue," he said.</TE>

<HD>Telecom Finds Its Calling</HD>
<DH>Verizon chief wants to expand the old-fashioned way--slowly
and with caution</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In today's brutally humbled telecommunications industry, it's all
about the basics. Upstarts with brash-talking executives are out.
Conquering the world is out. And chief executives these days can
forget about rapid expansion, frenzied acquisitions and highflying
stock prices.</LD>
<LD>   In times like these, it's good to be Verizon Communications Inc.
The New York company may be suffering from a multitude of setbacks,
but it has steady cash from monthly phone bills, a dominant market
position and enviable financial strength--all of which put Verizon a
class above its troubled and bankrupt brethren.</LD>
<LD>   Verizon is the nation's largest local phone company, with copper
wires stretching into one-third of U.S. households and into the
headquarters of more than a third of Fortune 500 companies. Verizon
Wireless, the company's joint venture with Vodafone Group, has more
than 29 million subscribers and is the nation's largest wireless
carrier.</LD>
<TE>   Lately, Verizon has taken aim at the long-distance market, where
it ranks fourth in size behind Sprint Corp. Once the company wins
regulatory approval to sell long-distance service in a few more
states, it is likely to move up to No. 3. Last week, Verizon teamed
up with software giant Microsoft Corp. in a potentially lucrative
effort to promote Microsoft's MSN Internet service and high-speed
Internet connections from Verizon.</TE>
<TE>   At the company's helm is President and CEO Ivan Seidenberg, 55,
who helped build Verizon through a series of mergers that combined
local phone companies Nynex Corp, Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE Corp.</TE>
<TE>   His company speaks loudly in the market, in Congress, in the
courts and in the halls of the Federal Communications Commission. The
man behind those moves is surprisingly low-key, even soft-spoken. In
a recent interview, Seidenberg shared his views on the MSN deal,
corporate trust, wireless consolidation, government regulation,
expansion in California, cheap telecom assets and his plan to grow
Verizon the old-fashioned way--carefully and gradually.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Question: Why do you need a combination with MSN?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: This deal offers an opportunity to accelerate [broadband]
growth because what we bring is a network orientation and Internet
service capabilities. What Microsoft brings is the extraordinary
capability to develop software that can enhance the broadband
experience. So I think we really do have a pretty simple case here
where the two companies, if we both stick to what we do well, will
bring a compelling product to the customer.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What are your thoughts on the accounting and other corporate
issues in the news now?</TE>
<TE>   A: First of all, as a corporate executive, I think we have to take
some responsibility for recognizing there has been a breach of the
public trust, which is manifested in the way the market is treating
everybody right now.</TE>
<TE>   There's got to be a little dose of improvements in corporate
governance. Secondly, I think that the enforcement that exists within
the law needs to be administered so that we're not writing new rules
and avoiding the most obvious thing to do, which is to enforce the
ones we have.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What about excessive executive compensation?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think that in our case, we have to demonstrate that our pay
is consistent with the delivery of value.</TE>
<TE>   When we get to January and to the next round of executive
compensation issues, I really believe you'll see corporations step up
to the plate and try to make proposals that put compensation more in
line with where the market is.</TE>
<TE>   We're going to be creative and we're going to be focused on making
sure that we address the concerns. It's pay, it's accounting, it's
governance. Every day, a company has to get up and dedicate itself to
executing to a high standard in a way that's transparent. And you
only rebuild trust over time. It doesn't happen overnight.</TE>
<TE>   Q: With all the telecom bankruptcies, there are a lot of
assets--and some whole companies--available for pennies on the
dollar. Is Verizon interested?</TE>
<TE>   A: Getting distressed assets at a bargain-basement price, and
having that business have no customers or revenue, or no plan for
growth ... that is not helping. You get to say you have bigger reach,
you have more inventory, but you have a bigger company with slower
growth.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Don't you need overseas fiber-optic networks, like those
available from KPNQwest or Global Crossing Ltd., to serve
multinational corporations?</TE>
<TE>   A: We view ourselves as a company that has a great big offensive
and defensive line. We're big. We average 300 pounds. We have a great
running game. We can grind it out. We're good on the fundamentals. So
we want to take the business market we serve today, which is
basically domestic U.S. customers, and really focus on exploiting our
opportunities there, and then migrating up to the multinational
companies.</TE>
<TE>   What we don't need to do is make a big splash and buy some company
that gives us enormous dilution and then try to go after the high end
of the market, when the high end of the market has the least market
opportunity. So we're not interested in buying KPNQwest or companies
like Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What about the North American part of Global Crossing?</TE>
<TE>   A: That's something we could look at. But I still think that they
are too expensive. It's worth very little. The way you have to value
it is 'What would it cost us to duplicate it or buy it in pieces or
lease it from other players?' That's not to suggest there aren't good
assets and somebody else might not buy them. But whoever buys it, we
can lease facilities from them.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do you expand your presence in California, where your
largest territory is west of Los Angeles and the rest of the state is
dominated by SBC Pacific Bell?</TE>
<TE>   A: In the business market, we've used our Verizon access line
base, which is in Southern California, and in the next 30 days or so,
we will announce that we've completed the construction of a fiber
ring into the business district in L.A. [SBC PacBell's home turf].
We've done the same thing in Seattle, and we've done the same thing
in Dallas. So we've started down the road of extending our network to
cities in which we have a presence [nearby]. Our view is that we can
use our presence to begin expanding in the business market out of
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What about broadband? You have strong views about regulation in
that market, where you sell high-speed connections in competition
with cable modem services.</TE>
<TE>   A: We think government policy is not [incentivizing] the proper
capital formation and therefore it's slowing down [broadband]
innovation. There is a sort of an imbalance in the rules coming out
of Washington, between taking old technology and trying to regulate
it, and trying to regulate new technology the way you regulated old
technology. What we have is the government doing a straight-line
extrapolation, [taking the] rules for analog and moving it to digital
[broadband services], and that's not helping anybody.</TE>
<TE>   Q: On to wireless. What do you think about the expected
consolidation among the big U.S. players?</TE>
<TE>   A: You have to have a reason to consolidate. All of the pundits
who are saying that what wireless needs to do is consolidate--that's
only half the problem. Consolidation will fix certain things. It will
take away some of the inefficiencies. But it won't help the
innovation factor.</TE>
<TE>   I think what the industry needs to do right now is straighten out
the multiple technology platforms, focus on the compatibility of
handsets and generate a lot of new products and services to get the
industry growing again, and then if you have a little consolidation,
that's going to be very efficient.</TE>
<TE>   I think consolidation's in the cards ... but if all we did right
now is go from six to four [national carriers], nothing is going to
change.</TE>

<HD>Net Radio, Labels At Odds Over Royalties</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With commercial radio outlets consolidating and playlists tightening,
record labels and recording artists are having a tough time getting
the airplay that fuels CD sales.</LD>
<LD>   Internet radio, on the other hand, represents a new and
potentially powerful ally: a medium that can expose new artists to
the fans most likely to respond to them.</LD>
<LD>   So why are the labels and Web broadcasters at each other's
throats?</LD>
<TE>   The two sides are locked in a bitter battle over the fees
Webcasters must pay labels and artists for the songs they play. After
a lengthy arbitration process, Librarian of Congress James H.
Billington set a royalty rate last week that left both camps
unhappy--the labels and artists said they're being ripped off, while
small Webcasters said they're being driven out of business.</TE>
<TE>   Online broadcasters will have to pay almost three years' worth of
back royalties in mid-October, coughing up about $260 per listener.
For some Webcasters, the amount is so daunting that they said they'll
fold unless Congress intervenes or the labels and artists agree to a
smaller payment.</TE>
<TE>   Some music-industry representatives said they're willing to strike
a compromise on the royalties and help small Webcasters. But they
have numerous hurdles to cross en route to the happy medium.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, they're not convinced that radio over the Internet
promotes CD sales. They're also determined not to extend any favors
to large Webcasters, although it's not clear how the line should be
drawn between big and small operators online.</TE>
<TE>   Underlying these issues is the labels' and artists' desire to
right what they feel is a 70-year-old wrong: Over-the-air stations
don't pay them a penny for the music they rely on to draw listeners.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law requires all radio stations, whether they're over the
air or online, to pay royalties to songwriters. The current rate is
about 3% of their revenues per year. But only digitally transmitted
stations, including those online and on digital cable TV, must pay
royalties to labels and recording artists.</TE>
<TE>   Genre-Specific Stations</TE>
<TE>   Consumers with an Internet connection can tune in to more than
2,500 Webcasters, many of which offer multiple genre-based channels.
Although the total amount of time spent listening to Web radio is
small compared with over-the-air stations, the audience is growing
fast, with 77 million Internet users in the U.S. having tuned in at
least once.</TE>
<TE>   MeasureCast Inc. gathers data on the total time spent listening to
more than 1,100 Web broadcasters, a statistic that reflects audience
size and the time each listener spends tuned in. That time has more
than doubled since the beginning of the year, despite a 10% drop in
the number of stations online, spokesman Sven Haarhoff said. Compared
with January 2001, total listening time is seven times greater.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the rate set last week--.07 cent per song per
listener--the total amount of royalties paid could be more than $10
million, said Jay Rosenthal of the Recording Artists Coalition, a
group that represents musicians. That amount would be split evenly
between labels and artists.</TE>
<TE>   The amount collected will depend on the number of stations that
stay in business. And that, in turn, could hinge on the ability of
small players to win more favorable royalty terms or develop more
sales.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of Internet radio said it's a better promotional tool
for labels and artists than conventional radio stations. Online
stations typically identify songs and artists as the music plays, in
contrast to over-the-air stations, many of which don't name all the
artists whom they play.</TE>
<TE>   And online stations often make it easy for listeners to buy the
music they hear, encouraging impulse purchases.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, many Internet-only stations delve deeply into genres
that are hard to find over the air, giving artists a unique avenue
for exposure. Because these stations are so tightly targeted, they
help introduce new or obscure artists to listeners likely to
appreciate their style of music.</TE>
<TE>   But John Simson, executive director of SoundExchange Inc.--the
subsidiary of the Recording Industry Assn. of America that negotiates
and collects royalties--said these genre-based stations have just as
much potential to eat into CD sales as to spur them. For many
consumers, he said, "if they can get a great Chicago blues channel
[online], they'll put it on, and they'll never feel the need to buy a
Chicago blues record."</TE>
<TE>   Promotion Potential</TE>
<TE>   Record labels agree with Webcasters that the Internet can be a
powerful promotional tool that circumvents over-the-air radio. But
they're finding plenty of ways to use the Net that don't involve
online broadcasters.</TE>
<TE>   For example, starting today, Sony Corp.'s Columbia Records is
using AOL Time Warner Inc.'s America Online and the Netscape Web site
to promote the new record from Bruce Springsteen and the E Street
Band, providing on-demand access to a series of tracks before the CD
is released July 30. Eager to provide the songs through the Net
first, Columbia sent a cease-and-desist order to a New York radio
station Friday that was playing an unauthorized version of the title
track.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenthal said he will urge SoundExchange to provide discounted
royalty rates to small Webcasters, particularly ones that feature
artists not on the major record labels. But it's crucial for
Webcasting businesses to "take into consideration the [librarian of
Congress'] rates from Day 1."</TE>
<TE>   The Recording Artists Coalition has "always been in favor of a
very viable, independent Internet community, meaning non-major-label
[outlets]," Rosenthal said. But, he said, nobody has proved that the
business model they've proposed will fail because of the royalty
rates.</TE>
<TE>   And even if some stations fail, he said, that's the way it goes.</TE>
<TE>   "We need them, but we want the ones that are viable, that figure
out how to make it work" without neglecting artists, he said. "It is
not mutually exclusive, this concept of us getting paid and having a
viable business."</TE>

<HD>OPEC to Discuss Production Quotas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With crude prices comfortably within OPEC's desired range, the
group's oil ministers should find few reasons to tinker with their
production quotas when they meet this week to assess market
conditions.</LD>
<LD>   But energy analysts say they foresee too much uncertainty in the
autumn for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to
feel confident for long.</LD>
<LD>   Among the variables OPEC must consider in coming months are
conflicting signals about the strength of the global economy,
unpredictable shipments from Iraq and a possible surge in crude
output from non-OPEC producers such as Russia and Norway.</LD>
<TE>   OPEC supplies about one-third of the world's oil, and its periodic
meetings can have a big effect on the prices consumers end up paying
for gasoline and other refined products.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the OPEC ministers are almost certain to agree to
maintain their official output level at 21.7 million barrels a day
when they confer Wednesday at their headquarters in Vienna.</TE>
<TE>   OPEC's benchmark price for crude averaged $23.97 a barrel on
Thursday, the most recent day for which the group compiled
information. The benchmark price has stayed within OPEC's desired
range of $22 to $28 a barrel since March 11.</TE>

<HD>Federal Reserve Seen Leaving Rates Steady</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters, Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal Reserve policymakers meet Tuesday and Wednesday, but they are
widely expected to keep their benchmark short-term interest rate
unchanged at 1.75%.</LD>
<LD>   A Reuters poll of 22 Treasury bond dealers found they were
unanimous in expecting the Fed to stand pat. The central bank has
maintained the so-called federal funds rate at a 40-year low of 1.75%
since December, waiting for the economy to shift into a strong
recovery.</LD>
<LD>   Fed officials, who are expected to announce their stance on rates
at 11:15 a.m. PDT Wednesday, have made clear that they see a pickup
in business investment spending as crucial to ensure a solid,
sustainable recovery. But business spending remains subdued, experts
say.</LD>
<TE>   "Capital investment is not going anywhere very fast," Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan said of the economy earlier this month. "Our outlook
at the Fed hasn't really materially changed since January."</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the stock market's latest dive assures the Fed
wouldn't want to upset investors further by tightening credit,
analysts said. Major stock indexes have fallen for five consecutive
weeks, driving the Dow Jones industrial average to 9,253.79 on
Friday, its lowest since October.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite, at 1,440.96 Friday, is within 18 points of
its three-year closing low reached Sept. 21.</TE>
<TE>   Most bond dealers don't expect the Fed to consider raising rates
until at least November, assuming the economy continues to improve.</TE>
<TE>   Investors have a flood of economic data to wade through this week.
Among the reports expected:</TE>
<TE>   * Tuesday, the Conference Board issues its consumer confidence
report for June, and the National Assn. of Realtors reports on home
sales for May.</TE>
<TE>   * Wednesday, the Commerce Department reports on factory orders
during May.</TE>
<TE>   * Thursday, the Commerce Department reports on its final estimate
of first-quarter gross domestic product, which was 5.6% in its
initial report.</TE>
<TE>   * Friday, the Commerce Department reports on personal spending and
personal income growth during May, and the University of Michigan
issues its final June index of consumer sentiment.</TE>

<HD>Machinists Union, Boeing to Begin Talks</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the International Assn. of Machinists District 751 begins
negotiations with Boeing Co. on Tuesday, it will square off against
more than just the world's largest aerospace company.</LD>
<LD>   Because of a shaky economy in a post-Sept. 11 world, machinists
are facing a tough battle in securing their two top goals: job
security and better pensions.</LD>
<LD>   Both sides said they are optimistic about reaching an agreement
before the current contract expires Sept. 1, and avoiding a
strike--as occurred in two of their last four contract negotiations.</LD>
<TE>   But a strike remains a possibility, they said, acknowledging that
forging a contract that bridges the economic and employment concerns
on both sides will be a tough challenge.</TE>
<TE>   The machinists' biggest concerns in talks this year--boosting job
security and securing better pensions--reflect the current state of
the union's membership, whose average age is 47 and whose numbers
have declined by more than a quarter because of layoffs since Sept.
11.</TE>

<HD>Aid for Africa to Be Discussed at G-8 Summit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush and other leaders of the world's most powerful
countries are determined to use this year's Group of 8 summit to
launch what some are calling a Marshall Plan for Africa: billions of
dollars in new aid to the poorest continent.</LD>
<LD>   African assistance is expected to be the primary achievement of
the 28th annual economic summit, which gets underway Wednesday at a
remote resort in the Canadian Rockies.</LD>
<LD>   Bush and the leaders of the other G-8 countries--Russia, Japan,
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada--also will spend
considerable time at their first summit meeting since Sept. 11
reviewing the fight against international terror.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. allies are going with plenty of questions about what Bush
might have in mind in terms of expanding the war to Iraq and other
countries.</TE>
<TE>   The president, in a commencement address at the U.S. Military
Academy on June 1, said the United States will strike preemptively
against suspected terrorists or the states that support them if
necessary to deter attacks on Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Even before Sept. 11 elevated terror to the top of the summit's
agenda, violent street protests at last year's summit in Genoa,
Italy, had convinced Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien that a
drastic overhaul in the annual meetings was needed.</TE>
<TE>   He switched the location from a bustling city easily accessible to
anti-globalization protesters to the tiniest site ever to serve as
host for a G-8 summit--Kananaskis, Alberta, a remote village
accessible by a single two-lane road.</TE>

<HD>Qwest Extends Deadline for Bids on Yellow Pages</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc. has postponed the final
bidding deadline for its telephone directory business to allow buyers
more time to develop proposals to acquire the unit in parts, sources
familiar with the situation said.</LD>
<LD>   Binding bids for the operation, which could top $9 billion, were
initially due today, but Qwest will now accept final offers up until
July 12, several sources said. The Denver-based telecommunications
firm expects to declare a winner of the auction by the end of that
month, said the sources, who declined to be identified.</LD>
<LD>   The delay is meant to allow the remaining bidders to devise deal
structures that would result in their buying the massive phone book
operation in two or more parts, sources said.</LD>
<TE>   That would serve the dual purpose of providing debt-heavy Qwest
with the quick cash it covets, while giving the company more time to
close the deal in certain states where regulatory approval is
expected to be more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the list of possible bidders for the unit has narrowed
by at least one as Yellow Pages marketing company R.H. Donnelley
Corp. dropped out of the auction, sources said. Qwest declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Qwest phone book unit, which distributes about 45 million
directories in 14 states, has drawn intense interest from a number of
bidders because it is considered a recession-proof cash cow.</TE>

<HD>States Clearing Path for Segway Scooter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The high-tech Segway scooter is still months away from being
available to the public, and already half the states have speedily
cleared a path by changing their laws to allow the electric-powered
vehicle on sidewalks.</LD>
<LD>   The manufacturer has waged a lobbying campaign at statehouses
around the country, winning over lawmakers who see the Segway as a
remarkable tool to ease congestion.</LD>
<LD>   But worries are growing among doctors and others who fear that
pedestrians will get hurt by the two-wheeled, 69-pound Segways as the
machines zip around at up to 12.5 mph.</LD>
<TE>   Until recently, all but three states barred motorized vehicles
from sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   Now the path is clearer. Twenty-four states, including Florida,
New Jersey, Tennessee, Washington and Wisconsin, have enacted
Segway's proposals into law with surprising speed over the last six
months. Legislation in four more states is awaiting governors'
signatures.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Dailida, who oversaw Segway's legislative efforts, said the
goal was to lay the groundwork for a 21st century technology by
sweeping aside 19th century laws.</TE>
<TE>   The Segway dazzled lawmakers when it was demonstrated at state
capitols, with many seeing the machine as a way to ease traffic,
boost tourism and make business more productive.</TE>
<TE>   But pedestrian advocates and doctors are warning about collisions
and injuries, and they fear that the machines could be especially
dangerous to children and the elderly. The consumer model, projected
to cost $3,000, is about three times as fast as a speedy walker and
stands about 3 feet high.</TE>

<LD>California has emerged as the center of the U.S. wireless
communications industry, with almost twice as many workers in the
sector as Texas, its nearest rival, according to a report.</LD>
<LD>   California has the most headquarters of publicly listed wireless
companies, representing more than 28% of the industry, according to
the report by O'Melveny Consulting and the San Diego Regional
Technology Alliance.</LD>
<LD>   The state, the nation's most populous, hosts more than 2,000
wireless companies, nearly double the 1,100 in Texas, which has the
second-highest concentration among U.S. states, the report said.</LD>
<TE>   California also has more than 60,000 wireless-sector workers,
nearly double the 34,000 in Texas, representing a total payroll of
$3.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Within the state, Los Angeles and neighboring areas have the
greatest number of wireless firms and employees among California
regions, or about 800 firms and 22,500 employees, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco Bay Area has received the most venture capital
in the state for wireless companies, nearly $4 billion over 8 years.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego, home to industry giant Qualcomm Inc., has California's
highest concentration of wireless employees: 484 wireless employees
per 100,000 residents, a result of jobs created by local companies
associated with Qualcomm.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Nokia, Siemens, Ericsson and Kyocera have offices in
the San Diego area, drawn there by technical talent associated with
Qualcomm and other area wireless companies, according to the
O'Melveny report.</TE>

<HD>U.S. on Risky Road if It Uses Nuclear Bluff</HD>
<DH>Misguided policy could turn loose a terrible genie.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY CLARK AREND and DOUGLAS B. SHAW</AU>
<BD>Anthony Clark Arend, a professor of government at
Georgetown University, is author of "Legal Rules and International
Society" (Oxford University Press, 1999). Douglas B. Shaw, a doctoral
student at Georgetown, served in the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency and the Department of Energy.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration seems to be moving toward preemptive nuclear
strikes against those who threaten the U.S. with weapons of mass
destruction. This threat to use nuclear weapons has a big flaw: We
might have to make good on it.</LD>
<LD>   Weapons of mass destruction are indeed the central threat to U.S.
national security and our way of life. The Bush administration's
nuclear posture review already has eroded the "nuclear taboo"; the
new strategic doctrine now being developed may make the use of
nuclear weapons even more likely.</LD>
<LD>   Warfare has matured to the point that a nuclear weapon that can
fit in a cargo container, a truck or even a suitcase could destroy a
city. If we can prevent a catastrophe involving chemical, biological,
nuclear or radiological weapons by striking first, then we must.</LD>
<TE>   But we should do so within the bounds of international law. These
rules are to our advantage and in the interest of civilization as a
whole. If our example encourages most of the world to stop playing by
the rules most of the time, we will be in even greater danger.</TE>
<TE>   International law allows for preemptory self-defense, but it
demands that such first strikes must meet two strict requirements:
necessity and proportionality.</TE>
<TE>   First, it must be demonstrated that force is necessary to prevent
an imminent attack. It is not enough that an enemy possesses weapons
of mass destruction. There must be a credible indication that their
use is imminent.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the preemptive action must be proportionate to the threat.
Only a truly mammoth threat would be proportionate to the use of a
nuclear weapon. Since no threat of the magnitude of a nuclear
weapon's devastation has been made public, the administration's
proposed strategic doctrine suggests a lowering of this legal
standard. It seems to assert that the U.S. has an exclusive privilege
to step outside the law.</TE>
<TE>   If the most powerful nation in the world asserts such a first-use
doctrine, other countries--some facing overwhelming threats--are
likely to begin to make similar claims. The reason that only a tiny
minority of countries has joined the "nuclear club" is that the
vulnerability of all, bolstered by international law in the form of
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, has convinced most countries
that these weapons are unusable, despite the example of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   But if the U.S. uses another nuclear weapon, we should expect one
to be used against us.</TE>
<TE>   This might happen anyway. The West was slow out of the gate in
rendering assistance to the former Soviet Union to secure its
arsenal, and it still does not give this critical task the attention
it demands. There are dark corners of Iraq and elsewhere where
international inspectors are unwelcome.</TE>
<TE>   More countries with nuclear weapons will mean more places for
terrorists to steal or buy nuclear weapons or material. Less
confidence in our conventional superiority will weaken our
friendships and embolden our enemies to put their focus where we
have--on nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorists have demonstrated to us that they have the will to act
with absolute brutality. There are plenty of reasons to believe we
may lose a city to terrorism. We should not add one more reason
through a misguided doctrine.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorists may not have cities to burn, but we do. Civilization is
the source of our strength and their one true enemy. Redefining
ourselves to be more like them will not make us more secure. It will
leave our cities naked before the world.</TE>

<AU>RANAN R. LURIE</AU>
<BD>Ranan R. Lurie is a senior associate at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., and a
syndicated columnist and political cartoonist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a remote yet beautiful country in the eastern Mediterranean,
whose name, I would venture, a sizable percentage of Americans can't
even spell: Cyprus. It's a picturesque island, about the size of
Connecticut, that breeds good-natured, easygoing and capable people
of Greek and Turkish extraction. Cyprus has never attacked another
state, and "never" in Cyprus means 10,000 years. The Cypriots are a
human treasure that the rest of the world should preserve as a token
of appreciation for the people who really "made love, never war."</LD>
<LD>   There are two reasons why the Cypriots are so nonaggressive. They
live in an island nation, which means there are no border frictions.
And second, by nature, they're genteel and love to mind their own
business. The downside of this fine character is that Cyprus has been
invaded and brutalized many times throughout history.</LD>
<LD>   On July 20, 1974, a massive force of Turkish paratroopers,
supported by the Turkish navy, descended on Cyprus and took over the
northern part of the stunned island. According to Umit Pamir,
Turkey's knowledgeable ambassador to the United Nations, there was a
reason for that outburst of unhappiness by his country: One Greek
Cypriot, Nikos Sampson, booted the Greek Cypriot president,
Archbishop Makarios, out of office and was planning to annex Cyprus
to Greece.</LD>
<TE>   All this caused great displeasure in Turkey, which sent its
airborne forces to "protect" the Turkish Cypriot minority, mostly in
northern Cyprus. To the credit of the Greek Cypriots, they in turn
booted out Sampson within days. But Sampson's actions, which
triggered the Turkish invasion, were backed by the Athens junta.
Considering the tremendous fiasco in which its darling Sampson failed
so miserably and single-handedly brought the Turkish punishment upon
Greek Cyprus, the junta had to give up power (the one upside of the
Turkish invasion).</TE>
<TE>   Cyprus learned to live as an island divided between the two
people, like a divorced couple who still have to share a house that
has only one shower. Good-natured Cyprus was invited to join the
European Union, something that would make the island's life much more
interesting and flourishing.</TE>
<TE>   However, U.N. Resolution 1251 of June 29, 1999, reaffirmed the
United Nations' position that a Cypriot settlement must be "based on
a state of Cyprus with a single sovereignty, an international
personality and a single citizenship." Thus, if the two groups would
come to an understanding and unite while maintaining social autonomy,
says Cyprus' ambassador to the United States, Erato Markoulli, the
650,000 Greek Cypriots and the 200,000 Turkish Cypriots could join
Europe and almost immediately elevate their economic situation and
quality of life.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey, which also hopes to join the EU, feels like a chess player
who suddenly realizes that a weaker opponent has managed to move a
pawn ahead and that this tiny piece will become a queen in the next
move. Once Cyprus enters the EU, it will be able to cast its veto
against Turkey's admission.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, the Greek and Turkish Cypriots have a deadline to reach
a conclusion of unity by the end of the month. If the deadline is
missed, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf R. Denktash will watch as
President Glafcos Clerides and his clever people on their two-thirds
of the island enter the EU as the Republic of Cyprus.</TE>
<TE>   Clerides, 83, was a bomber pilot during World War II. He promised
that Cyprus would encourage the entry of Turkey to the EU. "We are
interested in a democratic, wealthy and happy big neighbor to our
north," he told me some time ago. "Turkey is the only democratic
Islamic country nowadays," said the veteran official, "and joining
the EU will cement its democracy and economy. Cyprus can only benefit
from it."</TE>
<TE>   Denktash, also a mature leader, knows that the only way to elevate
the Turkish Cypriot standard of living (about $4,000 per capita) and
bring it to the standards of the Greek Cypriots (about $17,800 per
capita) will be to join the EU as one country. This can hurt no one,
and would make many happy.</TE>
<TE>   History may have, for a change, a Greek tragedy with a happy
ending.</TE>

<HD>Healing the Victims and Healing the Church</HD>
<DH>Let us go forward together to repair what is broken.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROGER MAHONY and RICHARD KIRBY</AU>
<BD>Cardinal Roger Mahony is archbishop of the Los Angeles
Archdiocese. Richard Kirby is a victim-survivor of sexual abuse by a
priest. He spoke to a meeting of cardinals during the bishops'
conference in Dallas.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As victim-survivors in Dallas spoke from the heart to the bishops
assembled there this month, they were again able to pull back the
dark veil that had too long obscured the truth. Bishops listened and
were astounded at what they heard. All were moved by the enduring
pain and suffering caused by the sexual abuse of minors by clergy and
by the policy of denial by some church leaders.</LD>
<LD>   Those honest but grim stories helped shape a "Charter and Norms"
for the Catholic Church across the country. What is now the policy of
the church in the U.S. has been endorsed by virtually all the bishops
and is now the agenda for the coming months and years. It is up to
everyone--victims groups, parishioners and church leaders--to demand
change within the church, leading to tangible results that will help
establish accountability and restore the trust that has been so
damaged in this scandal.</LD>
<LD>   One of the special aspects of the charter is the call for a new
and collaborative relationship between the bishops and
victim-survivors and the groups to which they belong. In the past,
too much time was spent in shouting matches. After Dallas, there is a
new openness--not just to talk but to take real action together.</LD>
<TE>   It is not only imperative that every possible step be taken to
prevent even one case of child abuse by a clergyman; there must also
be a new partnership for healing, reconciliation and needed change.</TE>
<TE>   Change means action. Without actions that have measurable results,
words become forgotten and promises are broken, thus victimizing the
survivor of abuse again and again.</TE>
<TE>   The charter from the bishops' conference called for a new process,
but we are only at the beginning of a long path. We have agreed that
all victims can continue therapy with the church's support regardless
of whether they take legal action.</TE>
<TE>   We look to the charter mandate to reach out to victims groups as a
doorway through which victims, children and parents can receive
information and help, with the support and understanding of the
church at the parish level.</TE>
<TE>   Further, the charter calls for a "communications policy that
reflects a commitment to transparency and openness." The policies
regarding all major aspects of the church will be made public,
reviewed and updated as needed.</TE>
<TE>   A new time has come, and we are ready for change. Both of us--a
cardinal and a victim-survivor of sexual abuse by a priest--pledge
ourselves to accept the grace of the moment and to begin to forge
relationships to help all victim-survivors be more fully healed.</TE>
<TE>   This relationship will be open and accountable when it comes to
major issues involving priests, survivors and parishioners. These
issues include not just victims and their healing but also
establishing processes for prevention, education, training, awareness
and understanding in each parish.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, we cannot achieve our mutual goals; together, with
openness and cooperation to take meaningful steps with measurable
results, we can help make the church and society safe for all, but
especially for children and young people.</TE>

<HD>Soccer Reigns: The Cleats Are on the Other Fut Today</HD>
<DH>The global marketing of sports culture is a two-way street.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVEN ZEITCHIK</AU>
<BD>Steven Zeitchik is an editor at Publishers Weekly.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the last decade, American sports Goliaths like the NBA and Major
League Baseball have tried every marketing trick imaginable to sell
games abroad. But a funny thing happened on the way to global
domination: While we were busy making the international sports
community a little more like us, the members of the international
sports community made us a little more like them.</LD>
<LD>   "The gap is closing," said Team USA coach Bruce Arena after the
U.S. advanced to the World Cup quarterfinals. He was referring to the
quality of U.S. soccer players, but he just as easily could have been
talking about the worldwide popularity of various sports.</LD>
<LD>   Globalization is strange like that. The influencer becomes the
influenced with the speed of a good corner kick. As kids from Turkey
and Tanzania have been learning double-pump jams from the league that
David Stern flogged, American youth have been working on their
midfield headers, thanks to the rest of the world.</LD>
<TE>   According to the Soccer Council of America, soccer participation
in the U.S. among kids 12 to 17 years old increased by 20% in the
1990s, while baseball and basketball weathered declines. These aren't
unrelated events.</TE>
<TE>   We can credit much of soccer's American surge to foreign
influence, to grant money from the soccer federation FIFA that has
poured in at the same rate that Major League Baseball money has
poured out, and to American soccer coaches hearing of Europe's policy
of pushing 18-year-olds to turn pro. Compare this policy with that of
the NBA, which, for better or worse, has wrung its hands over
admitting high school kids.</TE>
<TE>   For a long time, pundits have asked whether globalism will allow
one region to foist its sports culture on another. Sometimes the
answer is no: Ask anyone who watches--or doesn't watch--the NFL
Europe. In other cases, it can. The math is simple: Argentine kids
are playing more basketball and losing in the first round of the
World Cup; the U.S. is playing more soccer and getting as far as the
Cup quarterfinals before being knocked out.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take long for the effects to start spreading. Europeans
are wearing Kobe Bryant jerseys and New York Yankees hats, while the
person walking down Fifth Avenue wearing the Adidas sneakers and the
British soccer jersey is probably an East Village hipster, not an
immigrant from Leeds.</TE>
<TE>   All of these costume changes, literal and figurative, raise larger
questions. Will sports allegiances--until now a complicated
expression of individual and regional identity--one day turn into
something else? Are we heading in a direction where loyalties mean
less, where fanhood could one day become just another in a long list
of media choices, no more personal a decision than picking a
cell-phone provider?</TE>
<TE>   It's a long way from here to there, of course. But it might be a
road we've already started down. Our 1980 victory over the Russian
hockey team in Lake Placid was significant because one country owned
the sport and the other dabbled in it. The Russians nurtured the
hockey industry like Iowans nurture soy, and when some ragamuffin
20-year-olds from New England beat them, it meant a lot. Few wins
today could match that.</TE>
<TE>   What's true for international preferences is doubly so for team
affiliations. In the Brooklyn neighborhood where I grew up, the
baseball team you rooted for said something very particular about
you. If you followed the Yankees, you wanted to fit in. If you
followed the Mets, you wanted to be different, and if you picked a
non-New York team that you couldn't watch, like the Cardinals or the
Blue Jays, you wanted to be weird.</TE>
<TE>   The global media have changed that: With cable making so many
nonlocal games available and a media culture siphoning a baseball
audience into X Games, wrestling and, of course, soccer, it's hard to
imagine any one affiliation carrying that kind of significance today.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the media are not all-powerful, and the history of
manufacturing fans is littered with absurdities. Ted Turner tried to
make the Atlanta Braves America's team by showing every game on his
national cable network, but he still can't sell out Turner Field for
a playoff game. George Steinbrenner came up with a plan to co-market
the Yankees with English powerhouse Manchester United, but it hasn't
resulted in too many David Beckham face-painters on 161st Street.</TE>
<TE>   Still, after watching the topsy-turviness of this World Cup, it's
hard to argue that the street does not run in two directions.
Globalism and media saturation have created a world where you can
make few safe claims about the territoriality of sports. This is
globo-time for the world's athletes and their fans. It is an era when
the Diegos and Ronaldos of the world may want to be like Mike--and
Mike just might want to be like Ronaldo.</TE>

<HD>... Fairer Death Sentences</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Supreme Court finally concurred with a belief long held by
reasonable people. Executing a mentally retarded criminal is "cruel
and unusual punishment" and violates the Constitution.</LD>
<LD>   By 6 to 3, the court held that offenders with very low
intelligence are not criminally responsible nor will they be deterred
by the death penalty. Defendants who have the mind of a child can't
communicate effectively, participate in their defense or even
distinguish truth from fiction. It is neither fair nor moral to put
them to death.</LD>
<LD>   A telling footnote to the majority opinion, written by Justice
John Paul Stevens and joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth
Bader Ginsburg, Steven G. Breyer, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H.
Souter, referred to the cases of two retarded inmates who confessed
to murders and were on death row in Illinois and Virginia until DNA
evidence exonerated them.</LD>
<TE>   Cases involving mentally retarded criminals often are not
clear-cut; in the case before them, the defendant was a murderer. But
the court reached the right decision based in part on the growing
national consensus against putting to death mentally retarded
criminals.</TE>
<TE>   Public opinion mattered in this decision because in a 1958
decision, then-Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote that the 8th
Amendment, which bans cruel and unusual punishment, "must draw its
meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress
of a maturing society." Of the 38 states that allow the death
penalty, 18 exempt retarded convicts. California is notoriously
missing from that list.</TE>
<TE>   Only two states, Georgia and Maryland, had such restrictions 13
years ago when an earlier decision allowed states to execute retarded
criminals. That 1989 decision has now been reversed, but the new
prohibition cannot remove the stain from the human rights record of
the nation.</TE>
<TE>   The barbarism may continue because the court leaves it up to the
states to determine who has a low enough IQ to merit a pass on
execution and who is subject to the death penalty despite having
intelligence well below average. The decision should shame Gov. Gray
Davis and the state Legislature into reconsidering how California
applies the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   This Supreme Court decision does not excuse convicted criminals
who are mentally retarded from appropriate punishment, such as life
in prison. It does protect offenders who are as vulnerable as
children from being put to death. That is a step in the right
direction.</TE>

<HD>Fairer HMO Treatment ...</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It seems perfectly ridiculous that the Supreme Court had to decide
last week that some HMO patients may seek outside reviews if they
believe they were wrongly denied surgery or other treatment. The
ruling--that states may require an independent review to decide
whether an HMO is denying a patient medically necessary care--was no
more than common sense. But it won't apply to almost half of workers
who have company-sponsored insurance.</LD>
<LD>   At least 56 million U.S. workers have health coverage through
large employers that directly pay for and design employee health
benefits. Congress in 1974 exempted them from state insurance laws,
accepting the argument that variation in state laws would create
havoc in company benefit plans. The result was to deny patients any
recourse when HMOs put cost-cutting ahead of accepted medical
practices.</LD>
<LD>   In his majority ruling, Justice David H. Souter scolded Congress
for the 1974 law, known as ERISA. Unraveling it, Souter wrote, has
come to "occupy a substantial share of this court's time" because its
terms "seem simultaneously to preempt everything and hardly
anything."</LD>
<TE>   Ideally, the high court's ruling will inspire Congress to fix what
it created in ERISA, by passing a national patients' bill of rights
and establishing a uniform medical review system to keep health-care
appeals from turning into another crazy quilt of conflicting state
regulations.</TE>
<TE>   A patients' bill of rights, even though most Democrats and
Republicans favor it, has languished in Congress for months. That's
because Senate Democrats side with a demand by the trial lawyer lobby
for the right to unlimited damages if an HMO decision is overturned
by reviewers.</TE>
<TE>   House Republicans are sympathetic to the health plan/employer
argument that such damage awards would put them out of business. The
two versions of the bill sit stubbornly apart.</TE>
<TE>   Only the Bush administration has the clout to forge agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The logical compromise would require HMOs to abide by the
reviewers' decisions (some states, including California, already have
such a requirement) but put a cap on damages for pain and suffering.
Without White House arm-twisting, the patients' bill of rights and
any other broad health-care reform will die in the cross-fire of
election politics.</TE>
<TE>   If Congress builds the patients' bill of rights around a moderate
independent review process, it can help HMOs control costs by
establishing an informal body of case law that would prevent future
lawsuits. Patients also would get what Daniel Zingale, director of
California's Department of Managed Care, says they want most: the
right "to see a doctor, not a lawyer. They want the care before the
damage is done, rather than suing after the fact."</TE>

<HD>Kursk's Tragedy--and Hope</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After nearly two years, the mystery of the deep is solved on the
surface and the men and boys who suffocated on the sunken Russian
submarine Kursk in August 2000 are home for burial. The official
verdict: One of the submerged Kursk's own torpedoes, powered by
volatile hydrogen peroxide, exploded, igniting others, shattering the
bow and sending the 14,000-ton sub and 118 crewmen to drift
helplessly 350 feet down to the Barents Sea's muddy bottom off
Norway. Another maritime tragedy that makes people everywhere wince
in sympathy for families they don't know.</LD>
<LD>   But even in the chilled murk of those hostile waters, the Kursk
calamity revealed much--about the unpreparedness, poor maintenance
and morale and rigid mind-set of the underfunded Russian military and
about the inertia and arrogance of a totalitarian bureaucracy being
forced into the daylight by developing democracy. As President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev used the 1986 Chernobyl disaster to force
reforms, there's hope that President Vladimir V. Putin, after an
initial misstep, is using the Kursk similarly.</LD>
<TE>   The sinking was secret for one costly day, then fudged for
another. Rescue equipment had been mothballed for budget reasons.
Military big hats, dodging responsibility, suggested that an aged
mine caused the disaster or, better yet, a foreign vessel. Only after
four days of saturation media coverage did Putin interrupt a beach
vacation to visit the scene--a PR lesson in humanity long learned by
officials elsewhere but something Russian leaders from the czar on
had ignored.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's military was loath to seek help from foreigners, who
routinely--and unashamedly--swap assistance for emergencies such as
vast forest fires. Help was too late; all probably died within hours,
some after penning farewells. Putin held a town meeting and vowed to
investigate and to recover remains of the crew and ship, a
$130-million gesture that has fueled his domestic popularity.</TE>
<TE>   It will take much more than PR gestures and torpedo-fuel changes
before Russia's authoritarian society creaks haltingly into an openly
responsive civil society for the 21st century. The fundamental
modernization of Russia will take patience, persistence, cleverness,
time and probably a healthy dose of luck.</TE>
<TE>   If this sad loss and aftermath provide needed impetus for ongoing
reforms, then the Kursk lives were not wasted. Little solace for
those 118 families. But moderate encouragement for their countrymen
and many millions of others who share this Earth with, and hopes for,
that vast land.</TE>

<HD>LAUSD: More Money for Less Education</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "School Bond Is Tougher Sell Now" (June 20), on how the L.A.
Unified School District is going to spend millions to promote another
bond proposal: This from the same board that has already squandered
billions from a previous bond issue approved by the voters, that
mucked up the Belmont Learning Complex--and thought it best to spend
tens of thousands of dollars on private bathrooms for each of the
board members.</LD>
<LD>   And this is a "reform" board?</LD>
<LD>   If there are millions of dollars in a drawer somewhere that are
available to promote another bond proposal, take that money and spend
it first on the students, teachers and school buildings.</LD>
<TE>   The LAUSD is not a moneymaking enterprise, buying commercials to
promote itself like Budweiser or Ford. The LAUSD gets its money from
the taxpayers, and we've made it clear we want the money spent on our
kids.</TE>
<TE>   If the LAUSD has done and continues to do its job, and the kids
really get educated, the kids' success will be advertisement enough
for the district's achievements. Stop wasting money on
self-aggrandizing efforts that have no visible impact on the "bottom
line"--not profits but successful students.</TE>
<TE>   Becky Mocciaro</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Once again the snake oil salespeople are attempting to present the
taxpayers with a multibillion-dollar bond issue to "fix or build"
schools in the LAUSD. Not only is the LAUSD pushing its mega-grab of
taxpayer money, it is not even mentioning that Sacramento is planning
a statewide bond issue in the billions of dollars at the same time.
It's time for a reality check in California. Every dollar going into
public education in this state, especially in Los Angeles, is a waste
of taxpayer money. The more money that flows into the school system,
the worse the attainment level of graduating students.</TE>
<TE>   Parents of students are not carrying their fair share of the
expense of educating their children. Too many parents seem to feel
that a school is a surrogate parent, responsible for the upbringing
of their children as well as their education. It's not too
surprising, then, to see the low levels of achievement in our public
schools. The only way to get parents involved in the education of
their children and the condition of the school environment is to have
the parents pay for their children's education.</TE>

<HD>Look to the Gospels for Jesus' View of Hell</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Hold the Fire and Brimstone" (June 19), regarding "hell's fall from
fashion," demonstrates one more time how hard it is to recognize a
myth when we do not recognize that we are standing on another one.
Religion has always been a product of a culture or cultures, has
always been refined by a culture and, no matter how many creeds we
create or how many dogmas we demand, culture will continue to
influence religion. For God's sake, we can let hell go, at least as a
place we might end up in after death. Hell was a creation of the late
first- and early second-century Christians who wedded their religion
with their Greek culture. The concept of hell was dramatically
altered by Christians in the Middle Ages. Most important, it had
nothing to do with the Sheol that Jesus may have spoken of in his
teaching, as a first-century Jew.</LD>
<LD>   Jesus' authentic teachings were far more concerned about how we
live our lives in relationship with God through our love (compassion)
for others than about how we avoid some bad place after death. The
real tragedy is the way our culture's love for money, power and
success has invaded our theology and our churches. The unfortunate
teaching of hell and eternal damnation is just another way to
maintain that power.</LD>
<LD>   The Rev. Fred C. Plumer</LD>
<TE>   Pastor, Irvine United Church of Christ</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thank you for your excellent article. I would like to propose that
the reason hell's flames are not as frequently fanned from the pulpit
is because folks are reading the Bible more and have heard the good
news that God is "patient and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding
in steadfast love."</TE>
<TE>   This message is what we preachers need to do a better job of
announcing to our congregations and to our world.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Charles S. Bunnell</TE>
<TE>   Central Lutheran Church</TE>
<TE>   Van Nuys</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is very broad-minded and considerate of Christian clergy to
stop threatening nonbelievers with eternal damnation and burning in
hell. I hope other religious leaders will follow their example and
stop preaching death to nonbelievers.</TE>
<TE>   Arun J. Mehta</TE>
<TE>   Northridge</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What a disturbing article about hell. The attitudes and beliefs of
the quoted church leaders reveal them to be heretics--gutless
hirelings catering to the masses.</TE>
<TE>   The reason for the church is to teach the only way to escape from
the coming judgment of hell, which is called the Gospel. To not be
concerned with the possibility of going to hell is the chief
indicator that you are.</TE>

<LD>The Times is right--we need more people, not fewer, serving on jury
pools throughout our state ("Say No to Jury-Dodging," editorial, June
18). The legislation by Assemblywoman Barbara Matthews (D-Tracy) is a
definite step in the wrong direction. To categorically exempt prison
guards and parole and probation officers takes one whole class of
people who could be very good jurors and gives them a free pass.</LD>
<LD>   For the jury system to work we need people from all walks of life.
That's one good way of getting fair, speedy trials in our court
system. The state Senate should reject AB 1970 and send a message to
employees and employers alike: no excuses, serve on a jury.</LD>

<TE>   Your editorial writer appears not to have been recently subpoenaed
for jury service in Los Angeles. The so-called one-day-or-one-trial
"rule," wherein you allege prospective jurors "are required to report
to a courthouse only one day," is horse puckey!</TE>
<TE>   Large groups of prospective jurors are dispatched to courtrooms
where they sit around for three to four days. Then attorneys and
judges, in between other extensive court business, query each
prospective juror over and over again with the same time-consuming
questions to see if the juror should be excused, picked or
challenged. The process is maddening to watch and listen to. More
often than not, after being required to report to the courtroom for
three to four days the prospective jurors, in droves, are dismissed.
Indeed, during this period, more often than not, the dozens and
dozens of prospective jurors are kept waiting in the hallways while
other courtroom business is conducted on other cases--or while the
judge takes a two-hour lunch break.</TE>

<LD>Robert Scheer's June 18 commentary makes the mistake of many who are
not themselves members of the Catholic Church. They view the church
as a social club or the religious equivalent of any well-intentioned
charitable organization. The sins of some, or even of many, are not
reason to abandon the ideals of its founder.</LD>
<LD>   Scheer includes "condom distribution, as well as the fundamental
human rights of women to make their own decisions about their bodies"
as part of a sweeping indictment of the church's centuries-held moral
teachings. Now is not the time to abandon its ideals but to reinforce
them compassionately and humbly, especially by those who preach them
in the first place. And these tragic sins are a very good reason for
the church to search deeply and contritely into clerical arrogance
and seek yet again to reform itself with courage and humility.</LD>

<HD>Nuclear Deterrence Has Prevented Wars</HD>

<LD>Nuclear weapons protesters point out that current tensions between
Pakistan and India, and the possibility of a nuclear war, prove that
they have been right all along--that nuclear weapons must be
abolished. These protesters could not be more wrong. The existence of
nuclear weapons is the one thing that has prevented major wars for
the last 57 years. One only needs to look at the millions killed in
two world wars to realize that that pattern would have continued,
with ever more lethal conventional weapons, except for the deterrence
of nuclear weapons.</LD>
<LD>   The threat of nuclear warfare kept the Soviet Union from
conquering Western Europe in the '50s and '60s. Nuclear deterrence is
what will keep the Pakistan and India conflict from expanding into
total war. Each side knows full well that putting its opponent in
such a position that nuclear weapons are the only option left means
that millions of their own people will die, and their own country
will be ruined in a nuclear exchange. The leaders will do whatever
they must to make sure this doesn't happen.</LD>
<LD>   Nuclear deterrence works and has probably saved millions of people
over the last half century from dying in conventional wars.</LD>

<HD>Jesse Ventura Wrestles With His Future</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After being so successful in professional wrestling and knowing how
staged it is, it must have seemed a natural step to Jesse Ventura to
enter politics ("Ventura Will Leave the Ring," June 19). It probably
never occurred to him that politicians and journalists play rougher
than wrestlers. He learned that lesson the hard way. He may have a
few more lessons to learn.</LD>
<LD>   Just because he's not seeking a second term doesn't mean he is
leaving his stage career behind. There are a lot of other people out
there who are acting and playing rough games. He might consider going
back into wrestling, where it's a little safer and where you expect
to be booed by the audience. Shakespeare could have been speaking
directly to the governor when he said, "All the world's a stage. And
all the men and women merely players: They have their exits and their
entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts."</LD>
<LD>   What's next, Jesse?</LD>
<TE>   Robert H. Williams</TE>
<TE>   Monterey Park</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So Gov. Ventura has had it with politics and wants to retire to a
quieter lifestyle. Democrats and Republicans survive because millions
of people believe in what their parties stand for, regardless of some
of the miserable candidates each nominates. Third parties live and
die based on the popularity of the individuals elected. Goodbye,
Jesse. Say hello to Ross, Pat and Ralph on your way out.</TE>

<LD>I was at first astounded that Pennsylvania Republican Rep. John E.
Peterson proposed giving 110 acres of national forest land
surrounding Mt. Wilson to a private group ("Eastern Lawmaker Seeks
Land Giveaway--in L.A.," June 21). Upon discovering the property
would be developed by the Mt. Wilson Institute for use by the
Carnegie Institution, I took heart. The juxtaposition of a bunch of
Luddites who are skeptical of scientifically validated changes in
Earth's climate encamped at the foot of an observatory considered the
birthplace of modern astronomy is "waaaay" Southern California. I
can't wait to find out how much national forest my congressional
representative wants to give away in Pennsylvania.</LD>

<HD>Battered Jenin Sees Worse to Come</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Palestinian city is caught between Israeli army,
paralyzed civil authorities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JENIN, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Along the wide boulevard leading to the downtown market here, the
trunks of elegant palm and ficus trees are pocked with shrapnel. At
one of the city's main intersections, a traffic light leans
precariously to one side. Street lights dangle from electric wires.</LD>
<LD>   Motorists swerve to avoid discarded fixtures from a trashed
grocery store that were thrown in the middle of the road.</LD>
<LD>   This is the scene in the center of Jenin five days after Israel
enacted tough new measures designed to root out terrorism. On Sunday,
it was evident that the city had sustained heavy damage since tanks
rolled in last week. Dozens of shops had been destroyed. Five people,
four of them children, had been killed.</LD>
<TE>   Israel's new strategy was prompted by a string of terrorist
attacks that left 31 Israelis dead last week. On Sunday, the Israeli
Cabinet approved the building of the first phase of a 220-mile fence
along the West Bank. The ministers also discussed the legality of
other proposed measures, such as expelling families of suicide
bombers from the territory and demolishing their homes. Meanwhile,
the Israeli army called up as many as 2,000 reservists to bolster its
forces for the new operation against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But the most controversial measure is the one announced last week,
in which Israel said it will seize Palestinian-controlled territory
and stay there until the terrorism stops.</TE>
<TE>   Many Israelis and Palestinians fear the measure could lead to a
reoccupation of the West Bank. Reports in the Israeli media say it
would cost $600 million to $800 million annually to bring back the
Israeli civil administration of the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer issued a statement
Sunday promising that Israel will not attempt to administer the
Palestinian territories again, but he vowed that it will conduct
"deep and thorough action against the terror infrastructure in the
Palestinian cities."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to occupy the West Bank. We don't want to stay
there. As far as we're concerned, we have one goal--to stop the
terror. As soon as the terror ends, we will leave the day after,"
said Justice Minister Meir Sheetrit.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank city of Ramallah, Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat accused Israel of trying to reoccupy the territory, in
effect reversing the 1993 Oslo peace accords.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a pure declaration that they are not with the peace that
was signed by myself and my partner Yitzhak Rabin," Arafat said,
referring to the late Israeli prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's push into the West Bank comes as both sides await
President Bush's ideas for a fresh start to peacemaking. White House
officials said Sunday that Bush's address was tentatively planned for
today but that he had to make the final decision and that events on
the ground could force a delay.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, Israeli tanks surrounded Arafat's compound, with him
and his aides inside. Soldiers announced that a curfew was being
imposed on Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, the military has also sent armor into Nablus,
Bethlehem, Tulkarm and Kalkilya, but it appears that Jenin has been
singled out for the harshest treatment because of its reputation as a
hotbed of militancy. However, it is difficult to determine the scope
of the operation, since much of the West Bank has been inaccessible
to reporters because of extensive roadblocks and curfews.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 600,000 Palestinians are reported to be under curfew in
the West Bank. In Jenin, Palestinian authorities in the city say,
about 1,600 men have been rounded up since Wednesday for questioning
by Israeli authorities, with about 700 still in detention.</TE>
<TE>   The new Israeli operation--known as Determined Path--calls for the
army to capture and hold pockets of Palestinian territory until
terrorist activity is stopped. But in Jenin, Palestinians are angry,
frightened and confused about exactly what Israel is planning. They
worry about their safety, about food, about who will fix the broken
traffic lights and collect the trash.</TE>
<TE>   The city is stuck in limbo. Although Israel appears to be in full
military control, with its tanks roaming the center of the town, it
has not stepped up to take over any of the civil administration. At
the same time, the Palestinian civil authorities have been paralyzed
by the Israeli-imposed curfew and appear incapable of administering
to municipal needs.</TE>
<TE>   "We are caught between the sky and the ground. We don't know what
is coming next, and we can only fear the worst," said Nasser abu
Zeid, a city health inspector.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, large swaths of Jenin's refugee camp were
bulldozed, and there were many casualties among both Palestinians and
Israelis. This time, most of the damage is in the central souk, the
traditional Middle Eastern bazaar where Palestinians sell fruit and
vegetables, fragrant spices and breads on carts on the street or in
small storefronts. The worst damage happened around noon Friday, when
the market was jammed with Palestinians shopping for the weekend,
believing a rumor, which turned out to be false, that the Israelis
had lifted their curfew.</TE>
<TE>   According to many witnesses, Israeli tanks rolled down the street
toward the market without warning. Palestinians said there were no
clashes and no resistance.</TE>
<TE>   "I had given my son 70 shekels [$14] to buy meat, bread, salami.
He came home without the money, without the food, with shrapnel in
his pelvis," said Khalid Mallah, a 45-year-old blacksmith who lives
near the market.</TE>
<TE>   "The tanks came from all directions. They were firing randomly. I
ran away toward the mosque, but there were more tanks," said Ahmed
abu Zeid, 27, a money-changer who was in the market. He escaped
without injury, but his brother, a taxi driver, was shot and remained
hospitalized Sunday. A 5-year-old girl in the car with him was
killed.</TE>
<TE>   The other fatalities were two brothers, ages 7 and 11, who were
playing on bicycles a few blocks away, and a schoolteacher. A
13-year-old Palestinian boy was killed in a separate incident.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army is investigating the incident, which it says was
a mistake. In a statement Friday, the army said that its troops had
identified a group of Palestinians who were breaking the curfew and
that they fired "two tank shells in order to deter the crowd from
approaching."</TE>
<TE>   Haidar Irsheid, Jenin's governor, said he believes that the
shooting in Jenin's market was to avenge last week's terrorist
attacks as well as the many casualties suffered by the Israeli
military fighting in Jenin earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   "They were firing randomly in the market. These were purely acts
of revenge," Irsheid said in an interview in his apartment, where he
is working because the curfew prohibits him from going to his office.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other Palestinian officials who are warning of the dangers
of reoccupation, Irsheid said he does not expect that Israel will try
to take over the civil administration of Jenin or other West Bank
cities. He says the Palestinian Authority is managing to provide
water, electricity and other services to Jenin, even though payment
of salaries has been delayed for the more than 1,000 employees in the
city.</TE>

<HD>Early Scheme to Turn Jets Into Weapons</HD>
<DH>Philippines: Police say Khalid Shaikh Mohammed led a cell
aiming to blow up planes in '95.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRY McDERMOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MANILA</DL>
<LD>Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the Al Qaeda agent believed to have been a
key organizer of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, spent a year here in
the mid-1990s. From the way he behaved, it's little wonder no one
suspected him of being dangerous to anything but his bank account.</LD>
<LD>   Evidence collected by Philippine investigators describes a man far
different from the usually abstemious Al Qaeda agent. In Manila,
where police say he used the name Abdul Majid, he met associates in
karaoke bars and giant go-go clubs filled with mirrors, flashing
lights and bikini-clad dancers. He held meetings at four-star hotels.
He took scuba-diving lessons at a coastal resort.</LD>
<LD>   When he wasn't engaged with the go-go dancers, he courted a
Philippine dentist. Once, to impress her, he rented a helicopter and
flew it over her office, then called her on his cell phone and told
her to look up and wave.</LD>
<TE>   Other members of the terrorist cell Mohammed led had local
girlfriends as well, and the whole group had a drinking party to
celebrate the anniversary of the 1988 Pan Am Flight 103 explosion
over Lockerbie, Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, little was known about Mohammed's time
here--almost a full year beginning in early 1994. He was known to
have played some role in a failed 1995 effort to blow up a dozen
U.S.-bound airliners over the Pacific. Now, in re-evaluating that
conspiracy in light of new information about Mohammed's prominence
within Al Qaeda, Philippine police have concluded that he was the
principal planner of the plot.</TE>
<TE>   A confidential report by the Philippine national police officers
who led the original investigation concludes that the airliner plot,
code-named Bojinka, was the first step in a sustained effort by
Mohammed to refine the use of aircraft as weapons of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   That effort culminated in the Sept. 11 suicide hijackings,
according to the report, a copy of which was provided to The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a strong network continuously hatching plots. After seven
years, they were able to do what they started here. That's the
story," said Col. Rodolfo Mendoza, who led the original
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   As evidence that Bojinka was more than just a coincidental
foreshadowing of Sept. 11, Mendoza cited the testimony of Abdul Hakim
Murad, a licensed commercial pilot and one of the men recruited by
Mohammed for the plot. Murad told interrogators that the first two
times he was brought to meet Mohammed in Pakistan in 1993, all
Mohammed wanted to talk about were aircraft and pilot training.</TE>
<TE>   The Bojinka plot was previously regarded as the creation of Ramzi
Yousef, a Kuwaiti explosives expert. The Philippine investigators now
believe that Yousef was working directly for Mohammed.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators consider it significant in retrospect that Murad,
whose arrest exposed the conspiracy, virtually pleaded with them to
listen to information he had about Yousef, but was reluctant to speak
of Mohammed at all. Mendoza said it was almost as if Murad was trying
to mislead them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's now clear Khalid was calling the shots," Mendoza said.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed, a Kuwaiti national of Pakistani ancestry, is under
indictment in the U.S. for his alleged role in Bojinka, which means
"big bang." The U.S. government has offered a $25-million reward for
information leading to his capture.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed, who is believed to be 37, spent most of the 1990s in
Pakistan. "He certainly wasn't a known figure" at that time, said
Hamid Gul, a former head of Pakistani intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani leadership through the 1990s sympathized with Osama bin
Laden's fundamentalist rhetoric. Mohammad Aftab, then head of
Pakistan's domestic news agency, put it this way: "There were so many
of these people around and they were all 'on our side,' so no one
paid a lot of attention to them."</TE>
<TE>   This sympathy allowed Mohammed to operate as he pleased in
Pakistan, and it was there that he began assembling the members of
what would become his Manila cell, according to police. These
included Yousef, already a veteran of the 1993 truck-bombing of the
World Trade Center, which killed six people and injured more than
1,000; Murad, a school-boy friend of Yousef's; and Wali Khan Amin
Shah, an Afghan.</TE>
<TE>   According to what investigators learned through interrogations,
the men seemed to be almost indiscriminate when discussing whom or
what they might attack. Among targets they proposed were Benazir
Bhutto, then prime minister of Pakistan; the U.S. Consulate in
Karachi, Pakistan; U.S. nuclear power plants; and a variety of U.S.
government buildings, including CIA headquarters and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Murad, a Pakistani, told investigators that he was the first to
suggest using aircraft to attack buildings after Yousef preached to
him about the need for suicide missions.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed told associates that he chose Manila as his base of
operations because he thought he could recruit young men from the
Philippines to join the jihad. Investigators believe that another
reason was a fledgling Southeast Asian Al Qaeda network, partly
funded by Bin Laden's brother-in-law, Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, who in
the early 1990s established an Islamic charity in Manila.</TE>
<TE>   Police believe that the charity, the International Islamic Relief
Organization, was a front to finance terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Khalifa worked with Islamist organizations in the Philippines--Abu
Sayyaf and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front--and like-minded
organizations in Malaysia and Indonesia headed by Riduan Isamuddin,
an Indonesian cleric who goes by the name Hambali.</TE>
<TE>   Hambali and Wali Khan, one of the Manila plotters, were founding
board members of a Malaysian company that police believe was created
mainly to fund terrorist activities. The company, Konsojaya, was
founded in the summer of 1994, just as preparations for the airline
plot were being put together in Manila. Wali Khan was involved in the
plot, and Mohammed Amin, another Konsojaya director, made frequent
trips to Manila while planning was under way. Investigators say
Amin's role appears to have been financial.</TE>
<TE>   The Bojinka plot called for using chemical bombs to blow up 12
U.S. airliners over two days in January 1995. U.S. officials say
thousands would have died if the scheme had succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   When the team began to gather in Manila, Mohammed let the plotters
stay in a one-room apartment with the explosives while he moved into
a considerably more pleasant high-rise apartment he kept in a better
part of town.</TE>
<TE>   Because he had moved, Mohammed wasn't present when Yousef, the
explosives expert, accidentally set fire to the apartment in January
1995. When reports of the fire reached a nearby police precinct, a
detective was suspicious of the purported cause--firecrackers. Police
were on edge because of a quickly approaching visit by Pope John Paul
II. The apartment was within a block of where the pontiff was
supposed to stay.</TE>
<TE>   When the wary detective, Aida Farsical, went to the scene to
investigate the fire, she discovered the bomb-making chemicals.
Police also found a laptop computer in the apartment and, when he
returned to retrieve it, Murad. The computer contained details of the
Bojinka plot. Police also found a dozen passports, pipe bombs and
maps of the pope's route from the airport to the Vatican Consulate;
the motorcade was scheduled to pass directly beneath the sixth-floor
apartment window.</TE>
<TE>   Police believe the team also was preparing to assassinate the
pope.</TE>
<TE>   Murad was arrested after the apartment fire. Two of the other
plotters--Yousef and Wali Khan--were captured within a year. They and
Murad were later turned over to U.S. authorities. Mohammed and Amin
got away.</TE>
<TE>   Because of confusion over the true identities of the escaped
suspects, police here were unable to determine clearly Mohammed's
role until he was identified by American authorities as a suspect in
the Sept. 11 plot and more information about him became available,
the new police analysis states.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed was charged in the U.S. as a co-conspirator in the
Bojinka plot, but the evidence presented against him was scant. In
federal court in New York, prosecutors argued that Yousef was the
leader. He and Murad were convicted of conspiring to bomb U.S.
airliners and sentenced to life imprisonment. Wali Khan was also
convicted and awaits sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, Yousef seems too bumbling to have planned much of
anything. Over several years, he repeatedly injured himself in
accidental explosions, at one point requiring eye surgery in Iran,
according to police records.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed returned to the Middle East later, traveling first to
Qatar, where authorities believe he worked for a charity, and then to
Pakistan and Afghanistan, where American investigators suspect he
rose in the Al Qaeda ranks.</TE>
<TE>   He remains one of the highest-ranking Al Qaeda members at large.
Roland Jacquard, a French terrorism expert, said that as recently as
late March, Mohammed was in Pakistan recruiting volunteers for
suicide missions. German authorities suspect he was involved in the
explosion of a truck bomb in Tunisia in April.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Sebastian Rotella in Paris and Tyler Marshall
in Islamabad, Pakistan, contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Bin Laden Feared Alive and Plotting</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Senators say latest report of the Al Qaeda
leader confirms U.S. intelligence data.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE and JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The senators who lead the Select Committee on Intelligence said
Sunday that they believe Osama bin Laden is alive and his Al Qaeda
organization is preparing new attacks against the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Their comments came in reaction to the broadcast of an audio
interview with a purported Bin Laden spokesman, who said that the
terror network's leader is ''in good and prosperous health'' and that
''98% of the leadership'' had survived the American bombing in
Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   This report only confirms what American officials already believe,
said Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), who chairs the intelligence committee.</LD>
<TE>   ''Our best intelligence estimate is that he is alive and probably
someplace in the tribal areas on the western side of Pakistan,''
Graham said on "Fox News Sunday." And far from being crushed, Al
Qaeda is reforming and shows a ''renewed willingness and capability
to conduct terrorist attacks.''</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), the committee's top Republican,
agreed that the threat of new attacks appears to be growing. ''They
could hit us any day,'' he said on ABC's ''This Week.''</TE>
<TE>   This latest report about Bin Laden--and the continuing threat
alerts issued by the FBI--prompted one leading Democrat to question
the success of the U.S. military operation in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) said on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' that
the Bush administration made an ''enormous mistake'' by not using
U.S. troops to seal off the Tora Bora area of eastern Afghanistan,
near the Pakistan border. Rather than being captured or killed, Bin
Laden and most of the Al Qaeda leadership escaped, he said.</TE>
<TE>   ''The initial part of toppling the Taliban was a huge success and
a great credit, due to the courage and capacity of those individual
soldiers,'' said Kerry. ''Our troops were not allowed to do what
they're capable of doing at Tora Bora.''</TE>
<TE>   In December, about 1,000 Al Qaeda fighters had retreated to caves
in the Tora Bora mountains, but U.S. commanders relied on the Afghans
to mount an attack.</TE>
<TE>   ''I think that was an enormous mistake. I think the Tora Bora
operation was a failed military operation,'' Kerry said on NBC's
''Meet the Press.'' ''We didn't shut off the back door.''</TE>
<TE>   In March, the Pentagon sent American soldiers to the same area to
lead another campaign, Operation Anaconda. But by then, Bin Laden and
his operatives had apparently escaped.</TE>
<TE>   ''The fact is that the prime target, Al Qaeda, has dispersed and
in many ways is more dangerous than it was when it was in the
mountains of Tora Bora,'' Kerry said.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan's president-elect, Hamid Karzai, said Sunday that he
too believes Bin Laden and Mullah Mohammed Omar, leader of the
Taliban regime that sheltered Bin Laden, are alive, but he added that
their days are numbered.</TE>
<TE>   ''They are a defeated force,'' Karzai said of the Al Qaeda and
Taliban soldiers. ''We are after them. We should not consider them a
force that can pose a threat.''</TE>
<TE>   Karzai, interviewed on CNN's ''Late Edition,'' said he had no idea
where Bin Laden might be hiding.</TE>
<TE>   Since the attacks on the Tora Bora caves, Bin Laden has been
neither seen nor heard from. This has led to speculation that he was
killed or was ill and near death.</TE>
<TE>   In the 24-minute audio interview, which the Qatar-based Al Jazeera
satellite network first broadcast late Saturday, a man identified as
Sulaiman abu Ghaith, a Kuwaiti-born spokesman for Bin Laden, said he
wanted to knock down those rumors.</TE>
<TE>   ''I want to assure Muslims that Sheik Osama bin Laden ... is in
good and prosperous health, and all that is being rumored about his
illness and injury in Tora Bora has no truth,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   ''Ninety-eight percent of the leadership of Al Qaeda are safe and
running their affairs perfectly,'' he said, and that group is still
capable of launching terrorist attacks. ''The few coming days and
months will prove to the whole world, Allah willing, the truth of
what we are saying.''</TE>
<TE>   Al Jazeera editor Ibrahim Hilal told Associated Press on Sunday
that the audiotape, which is in Arabic, was downloaded from an
Internet site believed linked to Al Qaeda. Hilal said he believed
that the voice was Abu Ghaith's based on comparisons with videotapes
the network has of him.</TE>
<TE>   On the tape, the spokesman said Al Qaeda was behind a deadly
bombing in April at a synagogue in Tunisia. It was not clear when the
recording was made, but it referred to warnings by U.S. officials
about further attacks.</TE>
<TE>   ''I say yes to what the American officials are saying ... that we
are going to carry out attacks on America,'' the spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   White House and Pentagon officials did not return telephone calls
seeking comment Sunday.</TE>

<HD>A Whale of a Food Shortage</HD>
<DH>The grays, which used to be growing in numbers, have
plunged by a third in four years. Now scientists think they know why.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING and KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They kept washing ashore, hundreds of them. The huge but emaciated
bodies of gray whales floated lifeless into Puget Sound and San
Francisco Bay, and drifted onto beaches from Alaska to Baja.</LD>
<LD>   The putrid carcasses became such a nuisance in 1999 and 2000 that
beach communities took to towing the 35-ton cadavers out to sea or
burying them with backhoes. Eskimo whalers reported harpooning
"stinky" whales that appeared to be rotting alive, too smelly even
for dogs to eat.</LD>
<LD>   Although the die-off has stopped--as mysteriously as it began--the
most recent tally shows the gray whale population has plunged by more
than one-third, falling from an estimated peak of 26,635 whales in
1998 to 17,414 this spring--the lowest in nearly two decades.</LD>
<TE>   "That's a jolting decline for a long-lived species," said Ray
Highsmith, a professor of marine science at the University of Alaska
at Fairbanks and an expert on the main food source for gray whales.
"If the numbers are right, there's something seriously wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The die-off was a stunning setback, coming as it did just five
years after the whales had been taken off the endangered-species
list. The grays, all but extinct in the 1930s, had appeared to be
thriving by the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly troubling has been the inability of scientists to
pinpoint the cause. Hunting, the old nemesis, could not be blamed.
Only 140 gray whales are taken each year by Eskimo and Native
American hunters, the only people allowed to kill the animals.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly what has gone wrong remains a topic of considerable
debate. One scientist thought it was the flu. Another blamed chemical
pollutants. Others pointed to the cyanide-based fluorescent dye used
to mark illegal narcotics drops in the ocean. Was it collisions with
boats? Navy sonar experiments exploding whale eardrums? Killer whales
with outsized appetites?</TE>
<TE>   Current thinking centers on the whale's food supply. The
recovering population of whales simply may have been eating more than
nature could provide. At the same time, nature itself, buffeted by
global warming and shorter-term climate changes such as El Nino, may
have been producing less of the cocktail-shrimp-sized sea-floor
amphipods that are the primary food of grays.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, in 1999, the bottom fell out. We went from 1,400
calves to 420. Strandings jumped from 35 to 270," said Wayne
Perryman, a biologist with the Southwest Fisheries Science Center in
La Jolla. "That's not a subtle signal."</TE>
<TE>   The casualties didn't just include the sick, weak, young and very
old. Many of the dead animals should have been in the prime of their
50-year lifespan.</TE>
<TE>   In the spring of 2000, veterinarian Frances Gulland of Sausalito's
Marine Mammal Center conducted full necropsies on three animals and
found as many distinct causes of death: viral encephalitis, the
biotoxin domoic acid and parasitic abscesses. "All of those could
have initially started as malnutrition," Gulland said. "The real
question is, why were they so malnourished? Why did they get whatever
caused them to die?"</TE>
<TE>   A team of Alaskan biologists is now conducting the first in-depth
chemical analysis of fresh samples of gray whale blubber in the hunt
for clues.</TE>
<TE>   There has been one common denominator in both the living and dead:
Many of the animals were so skinny that their ribs stuck out. The
scrawniness was visible from aerial photographs.</TE>
<TE>   As for the medicine-like stink that prompted complaints from
Eskimo hunters, Perryman said it could have been a result of a
defective metabolism or simply the stench of starvation. "Just like
with human beings, their breath is affected by what they're eating,"
he said. The breath of gray whales might be rancid, he said, because
they are breaking down deep energy reserves and protein, instead of
burning calories from recently ingested food or their own blubber.</TE>
<TE>   If the whales were starving, what happened to their food?</TE>
<TE>   The 35- to 50-ton beasts spend their summer in the Bering Strait,
gorging on millions of amphipods--crustaceans that live in tubes in
the mud and sand on the shallow ocean floor. The whales dive for the
critters, sucking in mouthfuls of ocean bottom. They strain mud and
sand out through baleen, and swallow the amphipods.</TE>
<TE>   Although they can eat other things, studies of whale stomach
contents show that one species of amphipod--Ampilesca
macroephala--makes up 95% of the whale's Arctic diet. Because whales
eat little while migrating or basking in Baja, the blubbery animals
must do a year's worth of fattening up on this one species in the few
months they spend near the Bering Strait.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Mate, an expert at Oregon State University and Sea Grant on
endangered whales, thinks there isn't enough food because there are
too many whales. "Our leading hypothesis is, they actually overshot
their food supply," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mate's "starvation hypothesis" presumes a dark side to the whale's
spectacular recovery--that the population can rise only so high
before being cruelly adjusted back into equilibrium with nature.</TE>
<TE>   "The two years we saw of die-offs and strandings was the
adjustment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mate suspects the whale's steady population growth has led to
numbers higher than in the days before commercial whaling. But that
idea remains debatable. Because there are no adequate records, no one
can say how many gray whales plied the Pacific before whalers started
killing them. Estimates range from 15,000 to 75,000 animals.</TE>
<TE>   Other whale scientists dispute Mate's theory. Scientists who study
another population of gray whales in the Western Pacific, near Japan,
have also seen starvation. With fewer than 100 animals, the western
population is too small for overpopulation to be blamed for
starvation.</TE>
<TE>   Peculiar behavior by the whales also suggests that the food chain
itself is out of whack. Whales have been seen in unusual places--for
example, in the mouth of the Sacramento River--possibly seeking new
feeding grounds. Many are also delaying their trip back to Baja and
staying north where the food is. The behemoths also have been seen
skimming the surface with their baleen for krill as they migrate--a
behavior common to blue and humpback whales but relatively rare in
grays.</TE>
<TE>   "They're shifting to other kinds of food we haven't seen them eat
before," Mate said.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Highsmith may be able to answer such questions. He will return
to those rich feeding grounds--known as gray whale heaven--by boat at
the end of this month. On his last trips there, from 1986 to 1988, he
found amphipod numbers were on the decline and suggested that the
whales might exhaust the food supply by 2002. Now he's checking to
see whether he was right. If he finds plenty of the crustaceans,
whale overeating is not the problem. If the sea floor is barren, that
could be because of whales--or because of something bigger, like
global warming.</TE>
<TE>   Warming trends, whether caused by human-induced climate change or
by local shifts in ocean and atmospheric patterns, are known to alter
the ice patterns and ocean currents that produce plankton and
transport it through the water column. Amphipods are not mobile and
rely on these currents to bring them dinner. They lie on their backs
on top of their tubes and wave their little appendages to direct
plankton into their mouths. "If anything interrupts the import or
production of food," Highsmith said, "there's a problem."</TE>
<TE>   In the last five decades, much of the ice that covers Arctic
waters has melted. It is not yet clear how this is affecting whales.
While some scientists worry that the lack of ice disrupts the food
web, others say a lack of ice is good for whales because it allows
the whales, which need to reach the surface to breathe, more room to
forage.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Arctic has been warming on average, some spots
within the Arctic, paradoxically, are colder than usual. In some
areas, the late spring ice has been slow to recede, keeping whales
from reaching accustomed feeding grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Perryman has linked poor health and low calf production in whales
to years when lingering sheet ice has kept animals from getting an
early start on feeding. Females in particular need to build up fat
reserves to maintain pregnancy and milk-guzzling calves during their
migration.</TE>
<TE>   "Lactating and fasting at the same time is very challenging,"
Perryman said. "If a female is not putting on weight rapidly, she
kicks into miscarriage."</TE>
<TE>   Perryman has noted the pattern for five years. Two years ago,
Perryman and his crew sighted just 96 calves heading north with their
moms. Last year, it was 87. This year, after studying satellite
images of ice distribution, Perryman predicted the calf population
would bounce back. Daily calf counts show he may be right.</TE>
<TE>   As in previous years, the painstaking count continued 12 hours a
day, from March to June. Richard Rowlett and other researchers took
shifts scanning the horizon from a cliff top on a finger of land
called Piedras Blancas, which extends into the ocean near San
Simeon's Hearst Castle.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists believe this is the best place on the West Coast to see
mothers and calves slalom through offshore rocks and kelp beds. The
calf remains on the inside, closer to shore. The mother shields her
offspring with her massive bulk, a precaution against marauding bands
of killer whales eager to make a meal of a baby gray fattened by
mother's milk.</TE>
<TE>   "The cows and calves follow the inside track here," Rowlett said,
plotting a course in the logbook after he spotted one large geyser of
water, followed by the more timid breath of a calf in tow. He labeled
the pair No. 286. "Sometimes they come so close you cannot see them
over the ice plant on the cliff," he said. "You can hear them breathe
and sometimes see the spray of their blow."</TE>
<TE>   Completed earlier this month, the West Coast calf census this year
tallied 302 pairs of mothers and offspring, an encouraging rebound
after three dismal years.</TE>
<TE>   The head count suggests that the total number of calves born this
year is 850. This is still a preliminary number, warns Perryman, who
works out such figures only after adding in estimates of how many
whales travel unseen at night or offshore.</TE>
<TE>   A similar census of the entire herd is conducted near Carmel.
Whale counters led by a National Marine Fisheries Service biologist,
Dave Rugh, tallied 2,800 whales migrating south during 532 hours of
systematic searching from December to March. That count formed the
basis for the preliminary estimate of 17,414.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists acknowledge that counts can fluctuate, depending on
observers, weather conditions and other factors.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had five weird years," said Alisa Schulman-Janiger, who
directs a gray whale census from the Palos Verdes Peninsula for the
American Cetacean Society.</TE>
<TE>   After years of spotting skinny whales, mothers without their
calves, whales eating strange new foods, she was heartened to see
whales back to normal, "fat and sassy" with calves in tow. She's
still anxious about what next year's migration will bring.</TE>
<TE>   "It's extremely important," she said, "to keep an eye on them."</TE>

<HD>Arizona Town in Path of Wildfire</HD>
<DH>Disaster: Residents of Show Low flee the three-mile wall of
flames. It has already claimed 185 homes; more losses are expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHOW LOW, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>A wall of flames that turned the night sky a muddy orange was burning
within two miles of this evacuated city late Sunday, threatening
thousands of homes as firefighters worked furiously to hold it at
bay.</LD>
<LD>   A concentrated aerial attack late in the day--coupled with
firebreaks formed by bulldozers and backfires--helped slow the fire's
march toward town. "But this is no time to be complacent," warned
U.S. Forest Service spokesman Jim Robinson.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the more than 1,000 firefighters here were prepared to
retreat from the front lines into town in order to try to save
structures. Police, firefighters and National Guard troops patrolled
the streets as evening darkness arrived early, the sun blocked by
towering plumes of smoke.</LD>
<TE>   About 30,000 people had fled Show Low and surrounding towns ahead
of the Rodeo fire, which displayed explosive behavior that continued
to stun veteran firefighters. "This fire has been so unbelievably
unpredictable," said Show Low Fire Chief Ben Owens as he braced to
protect his city.</TE>
<TE>   More than 700,000 acres across the drought-stricken West already
have gone up in flames; there are now 17 active large fires burning
nationwide, including five that started Sunday, according to the
National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze outside Show Low is now the largest in the country in a
week-old season that to date has seen twice the normal amount of
acreage burned. The fire started Tuesday afternoon and had grown to
more than 200,000 acres by Sunday, dwarfing the devastating Hayman
fire southwest of Denver.</TE>
<TE>   A companion blaze, known as the Chediski fire, was started
Thursday when a lost hiker shot off a flare and had burned more than
94,000 acres; the two blazes merged as one by Sunday night, fire
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the three-mile-wide wall of flames had reached this
city of 7,700, 185 homes in outlying areas had been destroyed.
Firefighters took comfort in having saved more than 1,800 others, in
part because aerial tankers were able to dump retardant even as fires
were licking at the homes.</TE>
<TE>   As the flames crawled toward Show Low, situated at an elevation of
6,500 feet in the White Mountains of eastern Arizona, an evacuation
order had left the town all but abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   On a typical Sunday afternoon, as the lowlands of Phoenix and
Tucson percolate in the summer heat, Show Low would be bustling with
vacationers. They come here to hunt, fish, play golf or hike in the
forest. The city has no real downtown, so visitors fill the
restaurants and motels along Deuce of Clubs--the main drag. (The
deuce of clubs is the card that determined which of two
settlers--competing in a poker game called "show low"--would win the
right to run the town.)</TE>
<TE>   But on this Sunday, the public swimming pool was closed. So was
the Ace Hardware store, the Sonic drive-in restaurant, the feed
stores and sports shops. The Kmart and Safeway were closed too, their
parking lots occupied by scores of vehicles that residents apparently
believed were safer there than in their garages.</TE>
<TE>   Two car dealerships had emptied their lots of new vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The sense of inevitability, and resignation, was everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Owens said his department had surveyed the structures in town to
determine which ones might be saved--and which ones would be allowed
to burn--when the flames and firebrands blow into town. The doomed
ones had been given red flags.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't set a firetruck at every house," the chief said. "Some
homes we're going to lose that aren't defensible. And if we're
overrun, we'll pull out."</TE>
<TE>   About 125 fire engines would be patrolling the town by the time
the flames arrive--most of them pulled in from firefighting duties in
outlying communities.</TE>
<TE>   Owens knew the city faced a grim night, and grew teary at the
thought of what he would find when the smoke clears. "My biggest fear
is losing my forest, losing my city. We're not quitting. We're not
going to give up."</TE>
<TE>   He said his own home and his daughter's house in nearby Linden
already may have been destroyed. "We don't know if we have a place to
live when this is over," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The city's fire personnel, trained in fighting both structural and
wild-land blazes, were manning outposts in the wooded neighborhoods
that were the first to face the flames. The Phoenix Fire Department
had dispatched about 20 engines in preparation to fight house fires.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't be able to stop the fire. We'll have to let it blow over
us, and go back in and salvage what we can," Phoenix fireman Alex
Sandoval said earlier in the day.</TE>
<TE>   His partner, Michael Chacon, said that he took comfort in
instructions given during the morning briefing--that no one should
risk their lives to save a structure. "We were told that everyone's
going to go home when this is over," he said. "Nobody's going to get
hurt. Houses can be replaced."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said there was little doubt that hundreds of homes were
doomed. On the western edge of the city, the upscale golf course
subdivision of Torreon features several hundred homes in the
$1-million price range--many with spectacular views of the ponderosa
pine forest. Each was built primarily of wood and set amid the trees
to ensure privacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Torrreon is going to be a wasteland by the time this is over,"
Show Low Police Officer Allan Meyer, who also lives on the west side
of town, said earlier in the day. "It's going to take out my house. I
hope it does. I don't want to live in an ashtray."</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff, mayor and other prominent civic leaders live in
subdivisions that abut the dense, overgrown forest, made brittle by
the worst Arizona drought in 125 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I think 99% of the people in town are gone," said Police Officer
Justin Hart. Those who refused to leave were asked by police to give
the names of their next of kin in case they would need to be
notified.</TE>
<TE>   Cliff and Karen Pettingill were among the few who remained until
the final minutes, keeping their KC Motel open Sunday afternoon for
helicopter and air tanker pilots fighting the fire. "We're doing our
bit for them," she said. "They're out there trying to save our town,
our business, so we're staying open for them.</TE>
<TE>   "But when we see flames, we're out of here," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Sunday, Gov. Jane Dee Hull, who owns a nearby cabin, flew
over the fire and said afterward: "There are people, friends of mine,
friends of many of yours, out there who are losing their homes. Our
prayers are with everyone in Show Low, everyone in the White
Mountains, everyone who is fighting this fire."</TE>

<HD>Angels Get Their Sweep</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Anaheim takes all three games from Brewers as
Erstad doubles twice and drives in three in 5-2 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Poor Darin Erstad. The Angel outfielder is up at the plate these days
"just trying to survive," he says, "just trying to find holes."</LD>
<LD>   Save the sympathy for the opposing pitchers.</LD>
<LD>   Erstad will never be happy because he is on an eternal search for
the perfect swing. But his manager and teammates are perfectly
satisfied with the swing he has right now.</LD>
<TE>   Sunday at Miller Park in front of 23,751, Erstad doubled his first
two times up, the second driving in three runs in a 5-2 victory over
the Milwaukee Brewers, giving the Angels a sweep of the three-game
series and improving their record to 43-29.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, Erstad had four hits and drove in three runs. In
Friday's series opener, he had two hits and a run batted in. That's
eight hits and seven RBIs in three games.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a long year," said Erstad, refusing to savor the moment.
"Things tend to even out. I'm not particularly happy with my swing.
That's baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's ever figured it out and I'm not going to try to figure
it out. I'm just trying to put the ball into play. It's better than
striking out."</TE>
<TE>   Everybody in the Angel lineup seems to be putting the ball into
play these days. Hitting .281 as a team, the Angels began Sunday with
the best average in the majors. Their 357 strikeouts are the fewest
of any club.</TE>
<TE>   Another of Sunday's hitting stars was second baseman Adam Kennedy,
who had three singles.</TE>
<TE>   He had been in a 0-for-12 skid when he came to Milwaukee, but
managed to get back in the groove with seven hits in the series.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are going bad, you feel like [the ball] is going 200
miles an hour," Kennedy said. "But in times like this, I feel like I
have more control."</TE>
<TE>   One of the beneficiaries of Sunday's offense was Angel starter
Kevin Appier (6-6). The 14-year veteran had been in a slump recently,
losing five in a row with an earned-run average of 8.31.</TE>
<TE>   But Sunday, he was able to relax, his teammates getting him two
runs before he took the mound. Eckstein opened the game with a
single, moved to third on Erstad's first double and scored on a
groundout by Orlando Palmeiro. Garrett Anderson then followed with a
run-scoring single.</TE>
<TE>   Appier began dubiously. When Milwaukee's first hitter, Alex
Sanchez, laid down a bunt, Appier slipped fielding it and wound up
helpless on the ground, watching Sanchez race safely to first.</TE>
<TE>   But Sanchez didn't score and neither did any other Brewer until
Tyler Houston, the team's top hitter at .346, hit his seventh home
run to right field leading off the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   After he subsequently walked Matt Stairs and gave up a double to
Mark Loretta, Appier came out, having given up six hits, striking out
six and walking two.</TE>
<TE>   "Ape's velocity was good and his location was good," Angel Manager
Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully this will boost his confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Ben Weber came in to shut down the Brewers in the seventh
and eighth innings.</TE>
<TE>   Closer Troy Percival gave up the final Milwaukee run in the ninth
on one of his two wild pitches, the run charged to Weber, but
Percival then struck out Jose Hernandez to secure his 17th save.</TE>
<TE>   Brewer starter Ben Sheets (4-8) took the loss, giving up five runs
in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee hadn't played the Angels since moving to the National
League after the 1997 season. After this horrendous weekend, it would
be understandable if the Brewers never wanted to see the Angels
again. With their offense in high gear, the Angels outscored the
Brewers, 24-8, in the series.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just the Angels, though. As poorly as the Brewers (26-49)
are playing, they are particularly inept against their former
brethren in the American League. Milwaukee is 1-8 in interleague play
this season and has lost 12 of its last 13 against the American
League.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad, on the other hand, has been especially effective in
interleague play.</TE>
<TE>   Since its inception in 1997, he has 146 hits, a major-league high
for interleague play.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine what he could do if he ever found that perfect swing.</TE>

<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Mike Scioscia has a problem every other manager would love to be
faced with: How do you find ways to rest baseball's hottest lineup
without cooling it down?</LD>
<LD>   "It's a great problem to have when you can't pick a bat to take
out of the lineup," Scioscia said.</LD>
<LD>   With a doubleheader today, in the midst of 14 games in 13 days as
part of an 11-game trip in 10 days, all in the heat of summer,
Scioscia has no choice.</LD>
<TE>   He tried to rest right fielder Tim Salmon on Sunday, replacing him
in the starting lineup with Orlando Palmeiro, but Salmon still came
in to play in the seventh inning.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Troy Glaus came out in the fifth inning after
aggravating a nerve injury between two toes on his right foot, but

<HD>Castillo Would Have Walked</HD>

<LD>The Detroit Tigers weren't going to give Luis Castillo another chance
to extend his 35-game hitting streak Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Castillo went hitless in four at-bats and was left on deck when
the Florida Marlins completed a four-run rally in the bottom of the
ninth inning to beat the Tigers, 5-4.</LD>
<LD>   Disheartened by the end of the streak, Castillo had a blank stare
on his face as his teammates celebrated the victory. He might be
relieved to know that a fifth plate appearance wouldn't have changed
anything.</LD>
<TE>   Detroit Manager Luis Pujols said Sunday that he and bench coach
Felipe Alou had agreed to intentionally walk Castillo and take their
chances against Eric Owens.</TE>
<TE>   "Felipe and I said we were going to look bad in our country, but
we had to walk him," said Pujols, who like Castillo and Alou is from
the Dominican Republic.</TE>
<TE>   But with one out and Andy Fox on third, pinch-hitter Tim Raines
hit a fly ball to center. Fox tagged and easily beat Wendell Magee's
throw home for the game-winner.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rookie outfielder Austin Kearns, one of the leaders of the
Cincinnati Reds' unexpected surge into first place, was demoted to
triple-A Louisville, Ky., so a reliever could be added to the roster.</TE>
<TE>   The Reds will be without left-hander Gabe White for at least a few
more days and don't want to remain short-handed in the bullpen, so
they called up right-hander Luis Pineda from Louisville.</TE>
<TE>   Kearns, 22, was called up on April 17 for what was supposed to be
a temporary stay, but hit so well that he earned a starting spot in
right field. He and left fielder Adam Dunn, his roommate throughout
the minors, anchored the lineup during the Reds' 51-day stay atop the
NL Central.</TE>
<TE>   Kearns' playing time diminished when Ken Griffey Jr. returned from
the disabled list on May 23, and he went into a slump that dropped
his average to .284--still one of the best on the roster.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Red Sox acquired left-handed reliever Alan Embree from
the San Diego Padres in a four-player trade. The Red Sox sent minor
league right-handers Brad Baker and Dan Giese to San Diego for Embree
and minor league right-hander Andy Shibilo. Embree was 3-4 with a
1.05 earned-run average in 35 appearances for the Padres and gives
the Red Sox a needed left-handed specialist in the bullpen.</TE>

<TE>   Rookie pitcher Josh Fogg of the Pittsburgh Pirates was fined $750
by Major League Baseball for hitting Montreal's Mike Mordecai with a
pitch during their game on June 5.</TE>

<LD>Bernie Lincicome of the Rocky Mountain News, commenting on America's
lack of passion for soccer:</LD>
<LD>   "It isn't as if we haven't given soccer a chance. We've had
leagues forever, amateur, pro, outdoors, indoors. We even put them on
television. Pele came by. We liked him OK.</LD>
<LD>   "Kids play soccer. Dads coach it. Mothers watch their own child
and take pictures. The boom is any day now."</LD>
<TE>   More Lincicome: "Here's an item from Antonio Matarrese, president
of the Italian Soccer League, who expressed astonishment at how we
treat soccer like a picnic. 'The American public looks at a game as a
day out to eat popcorn and hot dogs. In Europe, the fans can't eat
because their stomachs are closed up by tension.'</TE>
<TE>   "Now, I ask you, who is the healthiest?"</TE>
<TE>   Enough already: And this from Mike Lupica of the New York Daily
News: "If there was going to be a soccer explosion in this country,
believe me, it would have happened already.</TE>
<TE>   "And I'm tired of being lectured by soccer heads that this is
somehow a failure of American sophistication, or soul, or even the
media."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the major league record for grand slams?</TE>
<TE>   Selfish guys: Tom Bunevich, who for 14 years ran autograph shows
in the Tampa area, has written a paperback, "Sign This."</TE>
<TE>   The most striking is the chapter in which he lists and details "My
Top Ten Jerks." Heading the list is Willie Mays. His synopsis:</TE>
<TE>   "Doesn't bother to make eye contact or even brief conversation
with customers. Only there for the dough and he doesn't care who
knows it--even if he leaves lifelong worshippers ex-worshippers."</TE>
<TE>   Of Ricky Henderson, No. 2 on the list, he writes: "Slows his
signing pace so he can be paid OT for those still in line.</TE>
<TE>   "Doesn't meet the terms of his engagement."</TE>
<TE>   So what? Mike Bianchi of the Orlando Sentinel writes that former
Nebraska football coach Tom Osbone, who serves in the U.S House of
Representatives, is trying to get a bill passed that would prosecute
unscrupulous sports agents.</TE>
<TE>   "And, pray tell, what's next on your congressional calendar, Rep.
Osborne? Trying to get the zone blitz outlawed?</TE>
<TE>   "Sponsoring the Federal Chop Block Protection Act? Giving the FBI
a break from this terrorism stuff so they can start investigating the
tuck rule?"</TE>
<TE>   Talking a good game: Charles Oakley is the leading vote-getter for
the NBA's all-interview team, according to the league.</TE>
<TE>   Oakley is joined on the first team by Milwaukee's Ray Allen,
Minnesota's Kevin Garnett, the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal and Seattle's
Brent Barry.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando's Doc Rivers led the coaching category.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Lou Gehrig of the New York Yankees, 23.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle:</TE>
<TE>   "These NBA pre-draft visits and workouts have become a separate
silly season.</TE>
<TE>   "The Warriors like to have their decision-makers take the
potential draftee to dinner ('Mike Dunleavy showed good use of salad
fork, but was slow on transition from main course to dessert') and
bring him in for a workout.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the NBA dine and dance."</TE>

<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Roy Halladay didn't have his best stuff, but he still had some fun
against the Arizona Diamondbacks.</LD>
<LD>   Halladay pitched out of trouble to remain unbeaten on the road and
Eric Hinske and Darrin Fletcher homered to lead the Toronto Blue Jays
to a 9-3 victory Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "I had to battle through some tough innings and tough situations,"
Halladay said. "It was a fun game to pitch in."</LD>
<TE>   Carlos Delgado and Felipe Lopez each drove in two runs for the
Blue Jays, who won two of three at Arizona. The Diamondbacks, who had
held at least a share of first place in the National League West
since May 16, fell a game behind the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not playing the kind of ball we're capable of playing,"
Arizona Manager Bob Brenly said. "We've been inconsistent."</TE>
<TE>   Halladay (9-3) worked out of three jams to raise his road record
to 6-0 in nine starts. He gave up three runs and eight hits in six
innings.</TE>
<TE>   "Get out of the tough times with only one run, that's what the
great ones do," Manager Carlos Tosca said. "I don't think there's any
questions he's the staff ace."</TE>
<TE>   Halladay ranks in the top 10 in the AL in victories and earned-run
average (3.19), which could land him another road assignment--in the
All-Star game next month at Milwaukee.</TE>

<HD>In First Place, Dodgers Win</HD>
<DH>Baseball: L.A. sweeps Boston with 9-6 victory and takes
sole possession of lead in NL West.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The view is a little different, the feel a little more distinct from
the top of the National League West, a lofty perch on which the
Dodgers stood alone for the first time this season after a 9-6
interleague victory over the Boston Red Sox before 45,960 in Dodger
Stadium on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Jim Tracy went to the reserve tank, and seldom-used subs
Chad Kreuter (two doubles, a single, two runs batted in and two runs)
and Dave Hansen (two hits, two RBIs, two runs) helped drive the
Dodgers to an improbable three-game sweep.</LD>
<LD>   Boston had baseball's best record when it arrived in Los Angeles
on Friday, but left town in second place in the American League East.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers (46-28) are 21-8 in their last 29 games and a
season-high 18 games over .500, a mark they haven't achieved since
Sept. 8, 1997. And after spending this month within two games of
Arizona in the standings, they finally passed the Diamondbacks,
taking a one-game lead in the NL West.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a nice place to be, a very nice place to be," Tracy said.
"When you're up there, everyone is looking up at you, so when you
show up to the park every day, you have to be very aware of that.
Your intensity level cannot waver. If anything, it has to go higher."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers pounded Red Sox starter Rolando Arrojo for nine runs
and nine hits in 2 1/3 innings, scoring four times in the second and
five times during a seven-hit third to take a 9-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Boston made some noise with a run in the fifth and four runs in
the sixth--one on Carlos Baerga's homer and two on rookie Juan Diaz's
pinch-hit home run, the first of his career--off Dodger starter Andy
Ashby (7-6).</TE>
<TE>   But right-hander Guillermo Mota, who has filled an important
bullpen void created by Omar Daal's move to the rotation, silenced
the Red Sox with 2 1/3 innings of one-hit relief, and left-hander
Terry Mulholland closed the game with a one-run ninth.</TE>
<TE>   "We're excited about where we're at, but it's way too early to
start thinking about anything other than trying to win each game,"
said Shawn Green, who singled to lead off the third. "This team
deserves to be in first place right now, the way we're playing.</TE>
<TE>   "We won eight series in a row and couldn't gain ground. That shows
you what kind of division we're in. But there has to be a point where
you take over the lead."</TE>
<TE>   Few figured that point would come with two of the Dodgers' top
hitters, first baseman Eric Karros and catcher Paul Lo Duca, on the
bench. But Tracy wanted to give them a day off, and he couldn't help
but notice that left-handers were batting more than 100 points higher
(.274 to .172) than right-handers against Arrojo.</TE>
<TE>   So Tracy started the left-handed hitting Hansen at first base and
the switch-hitting Kreuter behind the plate. Hansen knocked in the
Dodgers' first run with a sharp single to right in the second, and
Kreuter walked during the rally, which included Dave Roberts'
run-scoring infield single and Cesar Izturis' two-run single.</TE>
<TE>   After Green's single and Brian Jordan's double to open the third,
Hansen singled to right for two runs, and Kreuter doubled home two
more. Kreuter also singled in the fifth and doubled in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "Hansen and Kreuter were the stars of the game, and that's a
credit to those guys," Roberts said. "They can sometimes go a week
without playing, and they produced."</TE>
<TE>   Every Dodger starter except Mark Grudzielanek had at least one
hit, but the second baseman continued to struggle, going hitless in
four at-bats with two strikeouts. Grudzielanek, slowed by nagging
hand, lower back and hamstring injuries, is batting .111 on the
homestand, and his average has slipped to .236.</TE>
<TE>   Reserve infielder Alex Cora, who bats left-handed, is hitting .324
and has played very well at second base, and he may soon force the
Dodgers to employ more of a platoon at the position with the
right-handed Grudzielanek. "Quite frankly, I haven't thought about
that yet," Tracy said. "Alex Cora is doing a phenomenal job for this
team, but when you make the lineup every day, the pieces have to fit
correctly, and I'll leave it at that. Even if I was thinking about
it, that's a discussion the manager will have with the player first."</TE>

<LD>Eric Gagne's services were not needed Sunday, but even if the Dodgers
had a one- or two-run lead in the ninth inning against the Boston Red
Sox, Manager Jim Tracy had no intention of going to his dominant
closer for a fifth consecutive day.</LD>
<LD>   "He won't even pick up a ball today," Tracy said before the
Dodgers' 9-6 victory. "He can hand out candy in the bullpen, pick up
water bottles, whatever [reliever] Jesse Orosco wants him to do. But
he will not come through that bullpen gate."</LD>
<LD>   Gagne, who recorded four straight saves Wednesday through Saturday
and leads the major leagues with 27, didn't agree with the decision,
but his objection was overruled.</LD>
<TE>   "Eric is not real happy," Tracy said. "It was not a screaming and
shouting situation, but he feels like he can pitch."</TE>
<TE>   Since his only blown save of the season, on May 7 at Atlanta,
Gagne has converted 17 straight save opportunities. He has been
remarkably efficient--Gagne has thrown more than 20 pitches in only
seven of 36 appearances and is averaging 14.3 pitches an inning.</TE>
<TE>   Some have questioned whether Tracy is running the risk of burning
out Gagne, who has entered games in the eighth inning six times, but
Tracy is not concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "Innings aren't important--you keep your eye on pitch counts,"
Tracy said. "I'm not going to let him get tired."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Guillermo Mota threw 2 1/3 scoreless innings Sunday, lowering his
earned-run average to 2.82 in 14 games, and the right-hander, whose
mechanics needed an overhaul after he was acquired from Montreal for
Matt Herges this spring, has emerged as a capable middle-relief
replacement for Omar Daal, who is now in the rotation.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>This final just in from Arena football: Los Angeles Avengers 62,
Carolina Cobras 32.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, in World Cup action, eight countries combined to score
four regulation goals in 360 minutes of quarterfinal play, an average
of one a game.</LD>
<LD>   Not that there's anything wrong with that--if you're Irish or in
charge of scoring summaries.</LD>
<TE>   News item: Germany defeats the United States, 1-0, in World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: We still lead in World Wars, 2-nil.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Germany defeats United States, 1-0, part II.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: One oblong football-obsessed American's view on
our "remarkable" World Cup performance:</TE>
<TE>   If South Korea doesn't beat Portugal, the U.S. doesn't even get
out of its group, doesn't beat Mexico and doesn't launch another
discourse on whether soccer can make it here as a major sport. (I say
soccer comes up short, 5-3, on penalty kicks).</TE>
<TE>   Actually, soccer should have won our hearts over, 1-0 in
regulation, but an Egyptian referee negated the goal and,
unfortunately, there is no instant replay.</TE>
<TE>   Continuing, if the U.S. doesn't escape its group, scribes might be
asking what's wrong with our soccer, not what's right with it.</TE>
<TE>   Corner-kick note: Poland fired Coach Jerzy Engel over the weekend
after his country's "dismal" showing in the World Cup. The last game
Engel coached was a victory against the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Of course Americans went berserk over our quarterfinal
advancement. We'd root for the U.S. over Germany in a three-legged
sack race. But was it the soccer that made us watch or the jerseys in
play and the international stakes?</TE>
<TE>   Reality check: Soccer's going to have a tough time putting a pipe
into our mainstream, and it's nobody's fault. Our fall sport is
American football and eventually our lads have to choose sides.</TE>
<TE>   This is an arms war; the difference being you can use both arms in
American football.</TE>
<TE>   Soccer is a perfectly legitimate sport--except for the part about
not being able to use your hands unless you're a German defender
guarding the goal in a really critical World Cup quarterfinal moment.</TE>
<TE>   For many Americans, though, soccer will continue to be worthy only
of a quadrennial peek, the same rah-rah USA! look we give ice hockey
in Olympic years.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean, after the Germany loss, some of us didn't flip
through channels looking for "Combat" reruns.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Germany beats the United States, Part III:</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Seriousness aside, we offer some suggestions to
make soccer more popular in the U.S.:</TE>
<TE>   * Limit American players to one name: Take the best of Brazil and
incorporate it into our game. Starting at midfield for the United
States, Billybobaldo.</TE>
<TE>   * Steroids: They've done wonders for baseball. Baseball was a bore
in the 1960s when Sandy Koufax and Bob Gibson tossed 1-0 soccer
scores all the time.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball eventually lowered the pitching mounds to increase
scoring but that didn't have nearly the impact trips to Tijuana and
Coors Field had on the game.</TE>
<TE>   Or, maybe you missed the New York Yankees and Colorado Rockies
combining for 70 runs in a recent three-game series.</TE>
<TE>   Soccer will need to hire baseball players' union boss Don Fehr to
fight for the constitutional right not to be randomly steroid tested;
the upside will be free kicks that knock the bratwurst out of German
goalkeepers. * Award six points for a goal. American football has
duped fans for years by awarding six points for one touchdown, making
games appear much more action-packed than they actually are.</TE>
<TE>   Apply the points system to this year's World Cup and Germany's 8-0
win over Saudi Arabia translates to 48-0. Now there's a score Steve
Spurrier can get worked up over.</TE>
<TE>   Americans like big things, like Monster trucks and Oprah. I'm only
suggesting here that we super-size soccer.</TE>
<TE>   * Broadcast games in a foreign language. Soccer is more exciting
in Spanish than English. Is there any argument on this?</TE>
<TE>   News item: Asteroid the size of a "soccer field" misses Earth by
75,000 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue has suggested that
asteroid would be the perfect place to stage future World Cups.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Area golf course offers players on-course prostitutes
during recent tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Consider no longer innocuous the following golf
phrases:</TE>
<TE>   Honey, I'm off for my lesson with the club pro.</TE>
<TE>   Mind if we play through?</TE>
<TE>   Bob, I think I have an unplayable lie.</TE>
<TE>   Don't forget to sign your scorecard, Bill.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, you're standing in my line!</TE>
<TE>   News item: Tiger Woods wins U.S Open at Bethpage Black.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Juan Carlos Barkley, Spain's most outspoken
athlete, tells "Sporto de las Illustrated" he believes the USGA's
decision to lengthen this year's U.S. Open course to a record 7,214
yards was a racially-motivated ploy to keep Sergio Garcia from
winning.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Woods hailed by many as best-ever golfer.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: He's headed down that cart path, but wouldn't it
be nice if someone provided a measuring stick, preferably a two-iron?</TE>
<TE>   In terms of greatness, Woods has already surpassed Jack Nicklaus
in the minds of many, but let's do a whoa here. Nicklaus not only won
18 professional majors, he finished second 19 times.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Woods, Nicklaus scrounged for his major wins against guys
who weren't afraid to stand up to him on Sunday. Nicklaus'
contemporaries included Arnold Palmer (seven majors), Gary Player
(nine majors), Billy Casper (three majors) Tom Watson (eight majors)
and Lee Trevino (six majors). Woods' most serious threats have come
from Garcia (El Grippo) and Phil Mickelson (El Zippo).</TE>
<TE>   News item: Tiger Woods ranks No. 2 behind Britney Spears on
Forbes' Celebrity 100 list.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Forbes says it all came down to who had the better
back swing.</TE>

<HD>Germany Is No Sleeping Giant</HD>
<DH>Semifinal: Three-time world champion knows it can't take
co-host South Korea for granted in Tuesday's game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>South Korea is not going to catch Germany napping when the two
countries meet Tuesday in the semifinals of the World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   There's no chance of that, in fact, because Coach Rudi Voeller's
team has some experience when it comes to staying awake.</LD>
<LD>   On their way to the tournament, Germany's players had to endure a
sleepless night after Voeller ordered them not to nod off during the
12-hour flight from Frankfurt to Tokyo.</LD>
<TE>   The idea was to combat jet lag and adjust as quickly as possible
to the time difference between Europe and Asia. Apparently, it worked
because Germany is unbeaten after five games and has given up only
one goal.</TE>
<TE>   Now, only the co-host stands between the Germans and a place in
Sunday's final. South Korea also is unbeaten and has gathered
momentum as the tournament has progressed. Its players are ready to
defy the odds and defeat their fourth European opponent in three
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "They have an incredible collective strength and also several
dangerous individuals," said Germany goalkeeper and captain Oliver
Kahn, who shut out the United States in the quarterfinals. "They have
knocked out Portugal, Italy and Spain, which says it all.</TE>
<TE>   "They will run until they drop and we have to be ready for a
marathon. But we will win this match."</TE>
<TE>   South Korea, as usual, will have the entire country behind it and
Seoul World Cup Stadium will be the now customary sea of red. Kahn
isn't worried about that either.</TE>
<TE>   "It's emotionally very strong," he said. "I can't wait to be in
that stadium."</TE>
<TE>   Germany, whose World Cup chances were dismissed by its own fans
and the media before it left for the tournament, has not exactly
sparkled since the first round ended. It struggled to overcome
Paraguay, 1-0, in the second round and made very hard work of beating
the U.S. by the same score in Friday's quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   "We were the favorites and we were expected to win [those
matches], which increased the pressure weighing on us," explained
Michael Skibbe, Germany's assistant coach.</TE>
<TE>   "This time we play a team that has knocked out three great
European nations ... and we're the outsiders. That could help."</TE>
<TE>   Skibbe said that Germany expects South Korea's players to adopt
the same tactics they have used throughout the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "They know only one direction, which is the way forward," he said.
"They never stop running and don't look tired at all even after
having played extra time twice."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Guus Hiddink's team had to last two hours before advancing
past Spain on penalty kicks in the quarterfinals Saturday. Before
that, it played 117 minutes against Italy before Ahn Jung-Hwan scored
the winning goal on a header when he beat veteran defender Paolo
Maldini to the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Hiddink, who has the rare distinction of having taken different
countries to the semifinals in successive World Cups--having guided
the Netherlands there in 1998--said South Korea will not alter its
style this late in the day.</TE>
<TE>   "We will approach the next match against Germany like, once more,
a bunch of young dogs," he said, his Dutch accent and the Korean
translation perhaps having led to something being mislaid along the
way.</TE>
<TE>   "We have gone so far and have nothing to lose and we will play the
way we like to play."</TE>
<TE>   Korea has the speed and skill necessary to cause Germany problems.
Voeller will have to hope that Kahn maintains the form that has seen
him beaten only once--on an injury-time goal by Ireland's Robbie
Keane--in more than 450 minutes at this World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Germany has the strength and aerial power to take advantage of
South Korea's lack of height, especially that of goalkeeper Lee
Woon-Jae. The Korean defense, like the U.S. defense before it, can
expect to see a lot of high balls knocked into the box and headers
flying in from all angles.</TE>
<TE>   Having seen refereeing decisions go against South Korea's last
three opponents, Portugal, Italy and Spain, Germany's players are
being prepared not to overreact if they encounter a similar situation
Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "We may have one or two refereeing decisions against us," Kahn
said. "That's normal. It's called home advantage. If it happens, we
must not let it demoralize us. If we have a goal disallowed, we must
concentrate on scoring another one."</TE>
<TE>   That might be easier said than done for a team whose forwards have
managed only one goal a game in the last three outings.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Ballack, who scored the goal that sank the U.S., has been
stung by criticism of Germany's play and dismisses talk of the
forwards being unproductive.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that counts in football is the result," he said,
"and so far the results have gone our way. We are in the semifinals,
which very few people had expected, and that's a great success.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't say we were lucky to win any of our matches. Of course
we would like to play good football, but if we keep winning, I'll be
happy."</TE>
<TE>   So what were Ballack and the rest of Germany's players doing
during that long and sleepless flight from Frankfurt?</TE>
<TE>   "I was daydreaming about the World Cup final," winger Christian
Ziege said.</TE>
<TE>   If Germany can get past South Korea, he can wake up. It will be a
dream no more.</TE>

<TE>Germany vs. South Korea
Tuesday, 4:30 a.m. PDT, at Seoul
TV: ESPN, Channel 34
How they got here: Germany won Group E, then defeated Paraguay, 1-0,
in the second round and the United States, 1-0, in the quarterfinals.
South Korea won Group D, then defeated Italy, 2-1, in overtime in the
second round and tied Spain, 0-0, after overtime in the quarterfinals
before advancing on penalty kicks, 5-3
About Germany: World Cup winners in 1954, 1974 and 1990, the Germans
finished second in 1966, 1982 and 1986; third in 1934 and 1970, and
fourth in 1958. The semifinals are where they expect to be, the final
is where they hope to be. Coach Rudi Voeller has warned his players
to expect a difficult match. "There's no doubt we have to raise the
level of our game," he said. "If we can't do that, we won't win."
Defensive midfielder Dietmar Hamann twisted a right knee ligament
against the U.S. and, if he is unable to play, will be replaced by
Jens Jeremies
About South Korea: The Koreans had not won a World Cup game in 14
attempts before this tournament. Now they are unbeaten as co-hosts,
have become the first Asian team in history to reach the semifinals,
and are 90 minutes away from the championship game. Coach Guus
Hiddink, the inspiration behind this turnaround, has kept the players
focused and, as he said before the quarterfinals, "Every contest we
make is against a big power at the moment. We have to stick to our
basic things, then we might have a little chance." South Korea is
battered and bruised but has everyone available
Outlook: It would be too much to expect South Korea to keep its
streak going, especially against a physically powerful German team.
With the reward of a possible final against Brazil awaiting, the
Germans should prevail, 2-0</TE>

<HD>Mickelson Is Repeat Winner</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phil Mickelson became the first repeat winner in Greater Hartford
Open history Sunday, holing a sand wedge for eagle and scrambling
home at the TPC at River Highlands in Cromwell, Conn.</LD>
<LD>   Mickelson, second last week in the U.S. Open, made a five-foot
birdie putt on the final hole for a six-under 64 and a one-stroke
victory over Jonathan Kaye and Davis Love III.</LD>
<LD>   Mickelson was on the putting green with wife Amy and their two
young daughters when Kaye pushed a 13-foot birdie try to the right on
the par-four 18th hole to end his chances.</LD>
<TE>   Mickelson finished at 14-under 266, two strokes higher than his
total last year, and earned $720,000 for his 21st tour title.</TE>
<TE>   Love closed with a 67, and Kaye, the third-round leader at 13
under, shot a 70 that included a 90-yard shot for eagle on the
par-five 13th.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trailing by three shots with three holes to play, Karrie Webb beat
faltering Mi Hyun Kim by one stroke when she bogeyed the final hole
at the LPGA Rochester International at Pittsford, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Webb closed with a four-under-par 68 and a 12-under 276 total and
won $180,000 to push her career earnings past $8 million.</TE>
<TE>   The 25-year-old Kim, who began the day with a five-shot lead over
Webb, had a two-over 74 and a 277 as she finished second for the
second week in a row.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   J.C. Snead made a 10-foot par putt on the 18th hole to avert a
four-way playoff and win the Greater Baltimore Classic at Hunt
Valley, Md., by one stroke, ending a record victory drought of almost
seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Snead never led in the final round until his last shot dropped
into the cup, clinching his first victory since 1995 and earning him
the winner's check of $217,500.</TE>
<TE>   Snead, who started the day tied atop the leaderboard with Rodger
Davis, shot a two-under-par 70 for a 13-under 203 total.</TE>
<TE>   John Mahaffey, Doug Tewell and Bobby Wadkins finished one shot
back.</TE>

<LD>   What: Dodger Dogs restaurant</LD>
<TE>   Where: Universal CityWalk</TE>
<TE>   When: 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday-Thursday; until midnight Friday
and Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the Dodger Dog.</TE>
<TE>   The trademark wiener is as much a part of Southern California
cuisine as a Wolfgang Puck pizza or an El Cholo enchilada. But as an
Epicurean experience, its merit is wrapped up in more than a bun.</TE>
<TE>   The aroma and flavor, the hint of grilling, come part and parcel
with the ballpark's ambient swirl, the gulps of beer and peanuts, the
organ music and, oh yes, the game down on the field.</TE>
<TE>   So the question is: Can the Dodger Dog stand on its own? Can it
weather the scrutiny of an undistracted diner?</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers and Universal are betting it can. They have opened
what amounts to an oversized snack bar along CityWalk with a menu
that is nearly identical--alas, no beer--and slightly cheaper prices.
Even the look of Dodger Stadium has been recreated.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the dogs are grilled, not steamed. But the only trace
of real baseball comes from a television showing games in the small
cafe, so the food must go it alone.</TE>
<TE>   On hand when the restaurant opened Thursday, Steve Garvey
attempted to make a case for the famed dog. The former first baseman
recalled that early in his playing days, he became sick after eating
a wiener at--where else?--Candlestick Park in San Francisco. For many
years after, he shied away from frankfurters.</TE>
<TE>   It was only later, upon joining the Dodgers as a consultant, that
he reacquainted himself with the Dodger dog and thought, "Hey, this
isn't bad."</TE>
<TE>   Now he insists that the world is ready for ballpark fare without
the ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wasn't good," he said, "it wouldn't have lasted this long."</TE>

<LD>Eric Chavez hit a two-run homer to help the Oakland Athletics
complete a three-game sweep in the ballpark where they couldn't win
during the 1990 World Series, beating the Cincinnati Reds, 5-1,
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The A's have won seven in a row and 15 of their last 16, moving a
season-high 12 games over .500. They are a major league-leading 18-3
in June.</LD>
<LD>   Chavez had only one hit in 16 at-bats when he hit his 18th homer
in the sixth inning off Chris Reitsma (3-5).</LD>
<TE>   Cincinnati, which lost its seventh in a row, suffered another
setback when Ken Griffey Jr. left the game after injuring his right
hamstring in the fourth inning. It tightened up as he rounded first
while running out a double.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 3, Florida 2--Damion Easley homered with two outs in the
top of the ninth inning and the Tigers avoided a series sweep at
Miami. It was the first run against the Marlin bullpen in 15 2/3
innings and also ended the team's five-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   With a runner on first and two outs in the ninth, pinch-hitter
Luis Castillo singled in his first at-bat since his 35-game hitting
streak was snapped Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   New York Mets 5, Kansas City 4--Roger Cedeno hit a go-ahead,
two-run single in the eighth inning to lead the Mets at Shea Stadium.
It was their sixth win in eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 10, Pittsburgh 4--Alex Rodriguez hit a two-run homer for his
first extra-base hit in 16 games to help the Rangers complete a
three-game sweep at Pittsburgh and win their fifth in a row and
seventh in 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 3, San Francisco 1--Gary Matthews Jr. hit a two-run
single in the eighth inning at Pac Bell Park and Jason Johnson (2-5)
pitched seven innings for his first victory since April 20.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 7, Cleveland 2--Wil Cordero drove in three runs against
his former club and Tony Armas Jr. pitched six strong innings and had
an RBI triple to help the Expos complete an 8-1 homestand.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 6, Tampa Bay 5--Todd Zeile hit a three-run homer to help
the Rockies complete a sweep of the Devil Rays at Coors Field. Jose
Jimenez pitched a perfect ninth for his 19th save of the season and
60th in his Rockies' career.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 9, Chicago White Sox 1--Rafael Furcal hit a leadoff homer
to spark a four-run first inning and the Braves got six shutout

<HD>Exam Points to Kile's Heart</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Preliminary autopsy findings reveal "80-to-90%
narrowing" of two coronary arteries probably led to death.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Cook County, Ill., medical examiner who reported Sunday that St.
Louis Cardinal pitcher Darryl Kile probably died from blockage in his
coronary arteries said Kile complained of shoulder pain and weakness
the night before he was found dead, possible warning signs of heart
problems.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Edmund Donoghue said preliminary findings during the autopsy
revealed "80-to-90% narrowing of two of the three branches of the
coronary artery," which probably resulted in an erratic heartbeat
that caused Kile to die. Donoghue also reported Kile's heart was
nearly 25% larger than normal.</LD>
<LD>   Kile, 33, was found dead Saturday in the Cardinals' downtown
Chicago hotel, forcing a postponement of the scheduled afternoon game
against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. The Cardinals and Cubs
played Sunday night, with rookie Jason Simontacchi starting in place
of scheduled starter Kile in an 8-3 loss.</LD>
<TE>   Donoghue said he expected to file a final autopsy report in four
to six weeks after studying toxicology results. Donoghue said he
issued a death certificate, although he ordered further tests after
learning that marijuana was found in Kile's 11th-floor room at the
Westin Michigan Avenue hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make it clear that marijuana had nothing to do with
this death," Donoghue told a reporter for Major League Baseball's Web
site, MLB.com.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Krause, an investigator in the Cook County medical examiner's
office, said Sunday night that medical examiner investigator Tim Doe
discovered the marijuana in Kile's room.</TE>
<TE>   Officer JoAnn Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Chicago police, said:
"No one in our department found evidence of marijuana in that room.
That's coming from the medical examiner."</TE>
<TE>   Donoghue gave no indication Sunday that any drugs or illegal
substances were involved in Kile's death. But he said information
from Kile's brother, Daniel, was compelling. Daniel Kile reported to
Donoghue that Darryl Kile said his shoulder was hurting and that he
felt weak during their dinner Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   "For a guy who was a pitcher in the major leagues, [the weakness]
was an unusual symptom," Donoghue said.</TE>
<TE>   Darryl Kile's condition, commonly known as hardening of the
arteries, could have been predisposed. His father, David, died at age
44 after a heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   "[That] pointed us in the right direction," Donoghue said. Kile's
right coronary artery and the left interior descending artery both
were blocked by 80 to 90%, Donoghue said. Additionally, Kile's heart
weighed 552 grams.</TE>
<TE>   "For his weight, a normal heart would have been 450 grams,"
Donoghue said. The autopsy revealed no damage to the heart, leading
Donoghue to believe a fatal disturbance to the heart rhythm,
arrhythmia, was the cause of death.</TE>
<TE>   Detecting heart problems can be difficult, medical experts said.
General examinations and even such tests as EKGs cannot identify
them. Only angiograms and special stress tests using radioactive dyes
injected into the bloodstream are effective, doctors said. Cardinal
spokesman Brad Hainje said Kile had a physical examination during
spring training but Hainje said he did not know whether Kile had a
stress test or angiogram.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jim Loomis, the Cardinals' assistant team physician, said
Saturday that the 6-foot-5, 215-pound Kile had no known health
problems and was not on medication.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal players, coaches and executives held a 30-minute memorial
service for Kile at the team hotel Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Kile's wife, Flynn, spoke to the players afterward, encouraging
them to play the game, and many Cardinals shared their memories of
the 12-year major leaguer who was a three-time All-Star and won 20
games in 2000. Kile, a Garden Grove native, played baseball at Norco
High and Chaffey College in Rancho Cucamonga.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals voted Saturday to resume playing Sunday in honor of
Kile, a fierce competitor who never spent time on the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for us to play, and it's important for us to play
[Sunday]," Cardinal Manager Tony La Russa said. "That's what he did
his whole career: take his turn."</TE>
<TE>   Sean Severns, the current Citrus College baseball coach who was an
assistant coach at Chaffey when Kile attended the junior college in
1987-88, said Kile's strong will to win was evident even before he
became a professional.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll always remember a playoff game against L.A. Harbor when
Darryl got drilled on the shin by a line drive in the sixth inning,"
Severns said. "Any other guy would have walked right off the mound
and called it a day. Darryl insisted he stay in and he finished the
game. We won."</TE>
<TE>   In Kile's final start, Tuesday against the Angels, he pitched the
Cardinals into first place in the National League Central Division.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday night's nationally televised game at Wrigley Field was void
of any stadium music except the national anthem, which was preceded
by a moment of silence for Kile.</TE>
<TE>   Public-address announcer Paul Friedman said, "[Kile's] love and
commitment for his friends, family and teammates will be sorely
missed." Friedman only spoke afterward to announce batters and lineup
changes.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. flag was positioned at half-staff and the usual guest
singing of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" was canceled, though the
song was played on the organ and the fans sang along.</TE>
<TE>   Kile's name and No. 57 was listed on the Wrigley Field marquee and
his uniform jersey hung in the Cardinal dugout. Cardinal players and
coaches wore a small black patch on their left sleeves with "57"
stitched in white.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs' victory came in front of 37,467 fans. The Cardinals
committed two errors and Simontacchi didn't make it into the fifth
inning, giving up four runs.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave it everything.... If we hadn't played, we would have had
huge regrets," La Russa said. "We came out and tried our best and we
got beat."</TE>
<TE>   Said Cub winning pitcher Kerry Wood: "It just didn't seem right to
have to think about baseball and go out and play baseball. It's hard
to be competitive in a situation like that and stay competitive."</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal General Manager Walt Jocketty said Kile's
memorial/funeral date has yet to be determined, adding that Flynn
Kile said it probably will be held in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   "Our prayers and thoughts are with Darryl's kids and family,"
Cardinal second baseman Fernando Vina said.</TE>
<TE>   Kile's children are 5-year-old twins--a boy, Kannon, and a girl,
Sierra--and a son, Ryker Davis, who was born in August.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't anything you can go through in life that can prepare
you for what happened [Saturday]," La Russa said.</TE>

<HD>Cameron Does His Part for Seattle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Mike Cameron found a good way to end a trip.</LD>
<LD>   Entering the game with two hits in his last 22 at-bats, Cameron
drove in four runs with the 100th home run of his career and a
three-run double to lead Joel Pineiro and the Seattle Mariners over
the Houston Astros, 10-5, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Pineiro (7-3) pitched seven strong innings to win his third
consecutive decision, and the Mariners got 15 hits to win two of
three in the first series between the teams.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm glad to get that 100 out of the way," Cameron said. "Now I
can move on and point in another direction. Maybe I can keep going to
the next 100 or 200."</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners ended their trip with a 6-3 record that included a
three-game sweep of the Cincinnati Reds.</TE>
<TE>   John Olerud had four hits and two runs batted in and Jeff Cirillo
also hit his 100th homer--a two-run shot in the fifth inning.</TE>
<TE>   "Olerud has been hitting the ball very good," Mariner Manager Lou
Piniella said. "He's been really consistent, especially on this road
trip."</TE>
<TE>   Olerud completed the trip with a .433 average (13 for 30) and
seven RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron gave the Mariners a 6-1 lead in the third inning with a
bases-loaded double off rookie Kirk Saarloos (0-2) and added a solo
homer, his 12th, in the sixth off Pedro Borbon.</TE>
<TE>   Pineiro held Houston to one run until Orlando Merced hit a two-run
homer in the seventh. The right-hander yielded three runs and eight
hits. Saarloos, the former Cal State Fullerton star, made his second
major league start, and the Mariners jumped on him with two runs in
the first inning.</TE>
<TE>   "The first guy got on in every inning," Saarloos said. "It's tough
to pitch with guys on base. I live and die on ground balls, with guys
on base and getting double plays."</TE>
<TE>   Saarloos made his big league debut in a loss to Milwaukee Tuesday
night. He lasted only two-plus innings against the Mariners, giving
up six runs and 10 hits.</TE>

<HD>Emotional Final Day Is a Winner for McCarron</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Jockey gets farewell ceremony and two wins in
six races, including his last.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man of many scripts--mostly compelling ones--Chris McCarron
climaxed more than 28 years of horsebacking Sunday by confidently
riding Came Home to a two-length win in the $107,500 Affirmed
Handicap at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   It was the 34,230th race and the 7,141st win of McCarron's career,
and the $64,500 winner's share boosted the 47-year-old Hall of Fame
jockey's record purse total to $264,351,579. McCarron's second win
Sunday came two days after he had made his last out-of-town
appearance by riding two winners and taking an all-star jockey
competition at Lone Star Park near Dallas.</LD>
<LD>   His riding peers doused him with buckets of water that night; on
his farewell day, they deluged him with admiration and praise.</LD>
<TE>   Galloping out Came Home after the race, McCarron had a flashback
to a snowy, freezing-cold 1974 day at Bowie, Md., where he rode his
first race.</TE>
<TE>   "I was wearing three pair of goggles that day," McCarron said.
"But I forgot to pull any of them down. From the three-eighths pole
to the wire, I couldn't see a thing. It's a good thing I finished
last."</TE>
<TE>   McCarron's older brother, Gregg, who had beaten him to the track
by several years, also was riding in Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   "No wonder you couldn't see anything," he said. "You didn't use
any of your goggles."</TE>
<TE>   About 90 minutes before the Affirmed, in a winner's-circle
lovefest attended by McCarron's family, jockeys present and past and
owners and trainers McCarron had ridden for over the years, Gregg
McCarron sneaked up on his brother. Chris McCarron had been led to
believe last week that his brother, with training and grandfatherly
duties in Maryland, wouldn't be attending.</TE>
<TE>   They embraced warmly, both in tears. It was Gregg McCarron who
encouraged his kid brother to follow him to the track. But Helen
McCarron, their mother, thought that one jockey in the family was
enough.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember Chris coming down to Maryland between his junior and
senior years in high school," Gregg McCarron said. "He got on a horse
and was scared to death. I called our mother and told her Chris had
nothing to worry about. I told her that he'd never make it. You know,
that's the first and only time I've been wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Marje Everett, the former chairman of Hollywood Park, was part of
Sunday's crowd of 16,850. Three of the five jockeys--the still-active
Laffit Pincay and Russell Baze and the retired Bill Shoemaker--who
rank ahead of McCarron in the win column also were there. It was
Everett who staged an all-star jockey competition in 1976, when
McCarron got his first exposure to California racing. Two years
later--on March 27, McCarron's 23rd birthday--McCarron and his wife
Judy flew to the West Coast to stay.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Jones, now retired as a trainer, remembered McCarron's
invasion of a jockey colony that then, as now, already was steeped
with talent.</TE>
<TE>   "He was wise beyond his years, and very confident," Jones said.
"When I asked other trainers to sum up Chris in one word, the words
'phenomenal,' 'fantastic,' 'professional,' 'style' and 'class' are
the ones that are used."</TE>
<TE>   Slightly more than a week ago, McCarron announced that he was
retiring. He said that he no longer had the wall-to-wall passion that
he felt was required to continue.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron rode in five races before his win aboard Came Home.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was going to be ready for [the last day], but I was
wrong," McCarron said. "I was going along pretty good, but when [his
daughter] Erin read that poem in the winner's circle, she got to me.
After that, I had trouble with my composure."</TE>
<TE>   Known for his focus as much as his left-handed whip, McCarron
ratcheted himself up for the Affirmed. Although McCarron had ridden
Came Home to victory in the Santa Anita Derby, more recently they had
finished sixth in the Kentucky Derby, and Sunday the colt was running
with 124 pounds--about 115 pounds of McCarron and the rest equipment
and lead--which was between four and nine pounds more than his five
rivals. The horseplayers, many of them buying $2 tickets that would
wind up in their scrapbooks instead of being cashed, bet Came Home
down to a 2-5 favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by a partnership that included Trudy McCaffery and John
Toffan--McCarron's longtime clients--and trained by Paco Gonzalez,
Came Home broke alertly and through slow early fractions was second
only briefly. After a half-mile he had displaced Kamsack as the
leader. He was two lengths in front of Tracemark at the eighth pole
and protected that lead to the wire. The margin was two lengths, with
Tracemark finishing seven lengths in front of Calkins Road, the
third-place finisher. The time for 1 1/16 miles was 1:41 4/5. Came
Home paid $2.80 to win.</TE>
<TE>   "When we hit the head of the lane, I had a strong feeling that the
race was over," McCarron said. "Because my horse took off then like
he typically does. All the way back [to the winner's circle], I was
pinching myself. This was all just too good to be true."</TE>
<TE>   Joining in the applause in the winner's circle was Craig Dollase,
who trains Tracemark. Before the race, Dollase had been asked if he'd
like to see McCarron go out a winner.</TE>
<TE>   "Sentimentally, I said yes," Dollase said. "But business is still
business and we were trying to win. But this is great. It's great for
Chris to go out like this."</TE>
<TE>   As McCarron dismounted, Gonzalez said: "I'll see you at the barn
[for today's morning workouts] at 6:30."</TE>
<TE>   McCarron grinned and said:</TE>
<TE>   "Can you make it 8 o'clock instead?"</TE>
<TE>   Usually, a jockey with a high-weighted horse and a comfortable
lead will make sure he doesn't win too easily, the better to buffalo
the racing secretary when he assigns weights for the next handicap.
McCarron went out ignoring that stratagem.</TE>
<TE>   "I was going to win by as far as I could today," the ex-jockey was
now saying. "Sorry about that, Paco."</TE>

<HD>Rudd's the Recipient of an Unexpected Gift</HD>
<DH>Auto racing: NASCAR veteran gets 23rd career win after
Nadeau's car has trouble three laps from checkered flag.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SONOMA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>In 1989, Ricky Rudd won the first NASCAR race at Sears Point Raceway,
one of two road courses on the Winston Cup schedule.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, Rudd won the first NASCAR race at Infineon Raceway, as
of Saturday the new name for the picturesque, two-mile hillside
circuit in Sonoma Valley that has been called Sears Point all these
years.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't easy, but it was unexpected.</LD>
<TE>   Jerry Nadeau, a road-racing specialist filling in for Steve
Grissom in one of the Petty Enterprises Dodges, was cruising along
with a six-second lead with only three laps remaining in the
Dodge-Save Mart 350 when he suddenly pulled his car into the infield
and stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "I spun the tires coming out of [Turn] 11 and felt something
tighten up and the rear end broke," a disappointed Nadeau said. "The
car started vibrating real bad with about four laps to go. I thought
it was the fuel pressure, but it wasn't. I've had this kind of luck
happen to me before."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, at Atlanta, Nadeau was leading with one lap to go and
ran out of fuel.</TE>
<TE>   Rudd, 45, was sympathetic to his 31-year-old rival, having been in
that situation many times in his 27-year career, but was more than
happy to accept his first win in nearly a year. It was the 23rd time
Rudd had taken the checkered flag, beginning with the 1983 race at
Riverside International Raceway, NASCAR's first road course.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to win one that way," Rudd, who was driving a Ford, said.
"We were running Jerry down, but we didn't have the time to catch
him. You hate to see misfortune come those guys' way, but we've lost
some races the last three weekends under very similar conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "We were sort of resigned to the fact that we had run out of time
and were gonna run second and, all of a sudden, he pulled over and we
won the race. It's not something you want to go bragging about and be
proud of it, but again, we've had some races where we led the most
laps and didn't win."</TE>
<TE>   Pole-sitter Tony Stewart, who looked like a winner in the early
stages of the race before dropping as far back as 19th, battled back
to finish second.</TE>
<TE>   "Not bad, a first and a second in the same weekend," said Stewart,
who won a U.S. Auto Club sprint car race Saturday night at Altamont
Raceway. "This is probably one of the most physically demanding races
of the year for us because you're shifting, you're going uphill,
downhill. There is just no place to really take a break to let your
arms and body relax."</TE>
<TE>   The race seemed to break up in segments.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Gordon dominated the first 30 laps and was leading when he
went to the garage with a broken rear end. Then young Kurt Busch, in
his second season, took over and led 27 laps until he pitted during a
yellow caution flag and came out seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Busch finished fourth, just behind veteran Terry Labonte.</TE>
<TE>   After Busch's run, it was John Andretti's turn to look like a
winner in another of Petty's Dodges. He led 14 laps but also suffered
from a slow pit stop. When he pitted with all the leaders, he was the
last one out and was never able to recover from 13th place. He
finished 10th.</TE>
<TE>   That was when Nadeau, who did not pit on the final caution flag,
assumed the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "We took a chance and it almost paid off," Nadeau said. "Me and
Greg [crew chief Steadman] started talking and he told me to stay
out. It turned out we had plenty of fuel. I just spun the gear. It
was weird. I'm usually pretty easy on equipment unless I wreck.
Unfortunately it didn't work that way this time, but that's kind of
the way my career has gone."</TE>
<TE>   Nadeau, who has been unemployed since being let go by Hendrick
Motorsports last month, plans to test with Michael Waltrip today for
a race July 14 in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   It was a bad day for the Winston Cup points leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Sterling Marlin, who has led since the second race of the season,
finished last after his Dodge ran over a bunch of rocks when he spun
in the dirt. One of them knocked off the water pump and after a few
laps it cooked the engine.</TE>
<TE>   Despite suffering the first DNF of the season, Marlin retained his
lead as most of his challengers fared nearly as poorly.</TE>
<TE>   Teammates Gordon and Jimmie Johnson, who had been tied for second,
finished 37th and 35th, respectively, enabling Mark Martin, who
finished seventh, to take over second place, 62 points behind Marlin.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>This time, Rubens Barrichello didn't have to make way for his
teammate.</LD>
<LD>   He led all the way to the finish line Sunday and won the European
Grand Prix at Nurburgring, Germany, beating fellow Ferrari driver
Michael Schumacher by two-tenths of a second.</LD>
<LD>   "It was really a great race," Barrichello said of his second
career Formula One win.</LD>
<TE>   "We pushed it and the performance was there, and I have to thank
everyone at Ferrari.</TE>
<TE>   "The car was really great."</TE>
<TE>   Fans cheered as they were spared a repeat of last month's Austrian
Grand Prix finish, in which Ferrari instructed Barrichello to let
Schumacher overtake him in the final laps.</TE>
<TE>   "The championship's moved on since Austria," Ferrari technical
director Ross Brawn said.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrari justified its controversial decision in Austria on grounds
Schumacher's world title defense was not yet secure.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, Schumacher has 76 of a possible 90 points and his
nearest rival, younger brother Ralf, is 46 points behind.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Schumacher is seeking to tie Juan Manuel Fangio's record
of five series titles.</TE>
<TE>   In this race, Ferrari told Schumacher to maintain his position
behind Barrichello.</TE>
<TE>   The finish prompted speculation that Ferrari was trying to appease
the international automobile federation (FIA) when it holds a hearing
Wednesday on the Austrian finish.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have Wednesday on my mind," Ferrari team director Jean
Todt said.</TE>
<TE>   "Team tactics are a part of Ferrari, and today our tactic was to
let Barrichello win."</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher denied allowing Barrichello to win to make up for what
happened at Austria.</TE>
<TE>   "I did fight very hard," he said. "So hard that I came off."</TE>
<TE>   He took a spin in the 23rd lap that increased Barrichello's lead
by 10 seconds, but was closing in again by his second pit stop.</TE>
<TE>   "After the second pit stop, he came out in front of me and that
was it," Schumacher said.</TE>
<TE>   "Rubens had a great race, he didn't make a mistake, so he deserves
to be the winner, and I deserve to be second."</TE>
<TE>   Kimi Raikkonen of McLaren-Mercedes was third after finishing 46.4
seconds behind Barrichello on the 3.19-mile Nurburgring circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Ralf Schumacher was fourth in his BMW-Williams, 66.9 seconds
behind Barrichello, who had started in fourth place.</TE>
<TE>   Pole-winner Juan Pablo Montoya and David Coulthard failed to
finish after colliding on the 27th lap.</TE>

<TE>   Sjeng Schalken won the Ordina Open at Den Bosch, Netherlands,

Federer in the quarterfinals and Tommy Robredo in the semifinals.</TE>

<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Right wing Theo Fleury will likely become an unrestricted free
agent July 1 after the New York Rangers decided not to pick up his
$7-million contract option.</TE>
<TE>   Ranger spokesman John Rosasco said the club failed to pick up an
option on Fleury's contract by a negotiated June 15 deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Fleury, who scored 24 goals and had 39 assists last season,
previously said he was willing to take less money to stay in New
York.</TE>

<LD>Talk to Jim Tracy for 20 minutes and you will want to put on a Dodger
uniform, lay down a sacrifice bunt, run out a ground ball, hit the
wall making a running catch, then come back to the clubhouse and give
credit to everybody else--from the man who crafted the Farmer John
product that became a Dodger Dog to the woman who served it, to the
young lady who sang "The Star-Spangled Banner" to the man who
directed traffic out of Dodger Stadium--to everybody but yourself.</LD>
<LD>   Talk to Tracy, manager of the Dodgers, and you will want to run
wind sprints until you puke, just in case you're asked to steal a
base; chart every pitch of every pitcher on every team just in case
that pitcher parachutes onto the field on this very day.</LD>
<LD>   Talk to Tracy and you will do whatever it takes, whenever you
must, because that, my friends, is how baseball should be played.</LD>
<TE>   "We play baseball here in its purest sense," Tracy says. "It
allows everybody in the clubhouse to be in a situation to succeed.
And it's a beautiful thing to watch. It's pretty special to watch
unfold."</TE>
<TE>   This sounds so cornball.</TE>
<TE>   When you read Tracy's words-- like when he says that if you have a
player standing at the plate and that player is being asked to put
down a bunt, you not only want him to be able to do it, you want him
to want to do it--it just sounds so 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Don't you want to say, "C'mon, Jim, no major leaguer wants to put
down a bunt now. His agent isn't going to be able to use 'successful
sacrifice bunter' in arbitration." A good sacrifice isn't going to
earn another couple of million for anybody.</TE>
<TE>   You imagine the Dodgers giggling behind their hands when Tracy
speaks from his heart about admiring what it is Dodger blue stands
for, you imagine them snickering when Tracy does what he does.</TE>
<TE>   "I talk out loud about being unselfish," Tracy says. "I make no
bones about it. I make it important and necessary and I talk out loud
about it."</TE>
<TE>   You imagine them guffawing if Tracy ever tells them earnestly, "My
mother and father did a good job of raising me to be unselfish and
humble."</TE>
<TE>   Except there is no snickering. There is no giggling. There is most
certainly is no guffawing.</TE>
<TE>   But there is winning.</TE>
<TE>   These are your National League West-leading Dodgers. Your
first-place Dodgers. Your clean-sweep-of-the-Boston Red Sox Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend, the Dodgers took two of three from the American
League's hottest team, the Angels. This weekend, they swept what had
been the AL's winningest team, the Red Sox. This is no accident. This
is no fluke.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy will gently remind you that since opening day 2001, the
Dodgers are 28 games over .500. Tracy will slip into an explanation
of foundation-laying and confidence-building that it is not an
accident the Dodgers are now 18 games over .500 for the first time in
nearly five years. "We just picked up where we left off last year,"
Tracy says.</TE>
<TE>   This is Tracy's team. Make no mistake. And if it's trendy to say
that today's professional team coaches and managers need to be young,
hip and able to relate to all the pressures and hardships that
today's multimillionaire athletes must endure every day, maybe the
truth is that players don't mind listening to a tough, principled man
who is not afraid to have values, flaunt those values and, because
he's the boss, expect his players to have the same values.</TE>
<TE>   As much as Tracy loves Shawn Green and Green's 22 home runs and
the way Green has hit over .400 on this homestand, Tracy loves
talking about how Dave Roberts, despite predictions to the contrary,
has become a nice leadoff hitter.</TE>
<TE>   And Green goes so well with Tracy. Green does not want, or expect,
to be applauded, celebrated, patted on the back, hero-worshipped or
fawned over. Green dresses to be anonymous and speaks softly.</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Kevin Brown, who is often criticized for being sullen,
grumpy, angry, cranky and many other unpleasant things, hurried back
to his team last week as soon as he could stand upright after having
back surgery. Brown can't pitch, may not pitch again this season, but
there he was, patting Sunday's winning pitcher, Andy Ashby, on the
back and offering congratulations.</TE>
<TE>   Boston's star hitter, Manny Ramirez, has been injured this year
and high-tailed it home to South Florida to rehab in private. Maybe
that's not wrong, but whatever you think of Brown, his teammates
certainly know that he wants to support them, even if he sits
gingerly on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy will talk as long as anybody wants about the value of
unselfish team play and the beauty of a well-turned double play or a
well-placed bunt. He will explain well and long how important it is
to put every player--the star and man No. 25--in a position to
succeed and not fail. Don't use a singles hitter to do a
power-hitter's job. Don't ask Chad Kreuter to steal second if you can
help it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's real easy for me to talk about these things," Tracy says,
"because there is nothing hypocritical about me saying these things.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at myself in the mirror every day and know I've lived the
way I teach."</TE>
<TE>   There's something right with having values and being proud of them
and talking about them and living them. There are 25 Dodgers right
now who can look at themselves in the mirror and say, "I'm in first
place."</TE>
<TE>   Then they might add, "Thanks, Jim."</TE>

<DH>Opening 75 years ago, Riviera did more than answer L.A.
club's desire to match counterparts</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF SHACKELFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The invitation furnished simple directions. Head west on newly paved
Beverly Boulevard, dubbed "America's finest four-lane highway." When
nearing the "countryside," turn left on Capri Drive and proceed one
block. Ample parking is available for your Model T coupes and
roadsters. Follow signs to the first tee, and please excuse the
clubhouse construction.</LD>
<LD>   Seventy-five years ago today, a few prominent Angelenos were
invited to christen the Los Angeles Athletic Club's expensive foray
into golf, the Riviera Country Club. Much has changed since June 24,
1927, but one thing remains the same.</LD>
<LD>   The drive from downtown still takes 45 minutes, only the four-lane
street is now Sunset Boulevard.</LD>
<TE>   Riviera's midday opening was modest by L.A. Athletic Club
standards. When Frank Garbutt and William May Garland resurrected the
club in 1912 by creating a 12-story downtown facility, 25,000 men and
women traveled by horse-drawn carriage or car to a lavish three-day
reception. The club grew rapidly, producing national champions in
several sports, including Olympic gold medalists Charley Paddock in
track and Duke Kahanamoku in swimming.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the sporting accomplishments with a membership roster of
celebrities and tycoons, and the L.A. Athletic Club's status soon
rivaled that of the famed New York Athletic Club and Olympic Club.
However, unlike those clubs and their illustrious 36-hole golf
facilities (Winged Foot in New York and Olympic Club Lakeside in San
Francisco), Los Angeles Athletic Club members were limited to rooftop
play on a nine-hole putting course and driving net. Until June 24,
1927.</TE>
<TE>   Despite excitement over Riviera, founders Garbutt and Garland
opted for a private thank you to architect George C. Thomas Jr.
Thomas had been reluctant to take on the project at first, but
eventually relented and, as was his custom, provided his services for
free. Four renowned golfers inaugurated Riviera that day in a relaxed
18-hole better-ball match.</TE>
<TE>   Garland, Garbutt and many of their fellow athletic club friends
were transplanted Easterners who led an inner circle of business and
civic life in 1920s Los Angeles. Their mission was to develop L.A.
into a thriving community greater than anything found in the East.
Their vision included grand architecture, support for the burgeoning
film business and, most of all, world-class recreational facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Tense beginnings</TE>
<TE>   With the Pacific as a prominent backdrop, Garland, Garbutt and
Thomas posed for photographs on the first tee high above the treeless
design. Each spoke briefly about the course and expressed hope that
Riviera would provide great golfing pleasure for years to come.
Thomas then struck a ceremonial tee shot from the spot where every
modern golf legend from Bobby Jones to Tiger Woods has since teed
off.</TE>
<TE>   There had been tension from the start between Garbutt and Thomas,
though no remaining differences were evident this beautiful June day.
Thomas had passed up repeated offers to design Riviera until the fall
of 1925, three years after Garbutt persuaded the LAAC board to
release more than $265,000 to fund the land purchase. A former World
War I Army Air Corps captain, Thomas surveyed the Santa Monica Canyon
terrain from his single-seat plane. When asked by the athletic club
what he thought of the site near its Uplifters Ranch retreat in
Rustic Canyon, Thomas replied that the course would not amount to
much. But, he said, "It would be good enough for the Los Angeles
Athletic Club."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, prominent athletic club members intervened, and Thomas
was cajoled into carrying out the design. To make the project worth
his while, Thomas expected unlimited resources to transform the
coastal sage scrub and rock-strewn site into something special.
Thomas insisted that construction engineer and budding architect
Billy Bell be hired.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas and Bell were fine solo architects, but when combining
their talents, the pair crafted ingenious designs, including Bel-Air
Country Club and the Ojai Valley Inn &amp; Spa. Billy Bell was a former
superintendent-turned-construction guru who commuted from Pasadena
daily, crafting the sprawling, baseball glove-shaped bunkers that
remain Riviera's trademark.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas was the visionary and design strategist who appeared once
or twice a week during construction. He was just as interested in
deep sea fishing with Zane Grey off Catalina Island or hybridizing
roses on his Beverly Hills estate. Thanks to an inherited family
fortune, Thomas took only select projects and never charged for
design services. For the Griffith Park courses he designed in 1923,
Thomas financed their completion when the city of L.A. ran out of
funding.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed Riviera club was part of Garbutt's grand dream to
build a chain of clubs stretching from downtown to the sea. An avid
boxer, yachtsmen, handball expert and auto racer who designed his own
car, Garbutt amassed a fortune through royalties derived from
inventing innovative oil drilling tools.</TE>
<TE>   As Riviera's construction moved along at a normal pace, the
energetic Garbutt drove from his 35-acre Silver Lake mansion for
frequent visits. He persuaded the LAAC board to fund additional
manpower and machinery to speed the construction process. The price
tag for the project, including the clubhouse, was about $1 million, a
huge sum at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Garbutt insisted on making design suggestions even though he was
not a golfer. This forced Thomas and Bell to devise a plan to chat
continuously whenever Garbutt visited the site, making it difficult
for their non-golfing friend to enter design-related conversations.</TE>
<TE>   Rave reviews</TE>
<TE>   Because the clubhouse was still under construction, the invited
guests and opening foursome had convened on the members' tee down the
hill. With members of the press and dignitaries such as U.S. Sen.
L.C. Phipps of Colorado looking on, the 6,910-yard course was turned
over to the city's finest for the exhibition match. Two amateurs,
Paul M. Hunter and George Von Elm, took on local pros Vic D'Alberto
and Willie Hunter.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Hunter was a former state and Southern California amateur
champion; Von Elm, who became one of the first to join Riviera, had
become the second-most famous amateur golfer in America when he
stunned Bobby Jones in the 1926 U.S. Amateur final at Baltusrol. That
same year, Jones became the first golfer--amateur or professional--to
win the U.S. Open and British Open in one season.</TE>
<TE>   D'Alberto, from Los Angeles Country Club, was announced by match
referee Scotty Chisholm as "rather crownless at present." Willie
Hunter was the 1926 British Amateur champion and later Riviera's "Pro
Emeritus." A mainstay at Riviera from 1936 until his death in 1968,
Hunter played in every Los Angeles Open from 1926 to 1961.</TE>
<TE>   With striped ties tucked into their white dress shirts and
flamboyant checkered socks exposed by their beige plus-fours, the
foursome initiated Riviera with three birdies on the par-five first
hole. But D'Alberto and Willie Hunter dominated the match, winning, 5
and 3, and carding a best-ball 67 to Von Elm and Paul Hunter's 71.
The lowest individual round was 73.</TE>
<TE>   In his post-opening day review for the athletic club's Mercury
magazine, Chisholm suggested that Riviera's second hole was "one of
the greatest par-four creations in the country." Chisholm made no
reference to the 238-yard par-three fourth hole that Ben Hogan later
called "the greatest par-three hole in America."</TE>
<TE>   Nor did Chisholm write anything about the par-three sixth with its
bunker set in the middle of the green. Perhaps with the $800
memberships ($10 a month dues) and $2,500 dues-free lifetime
memberships moving slowly, Chisholm avoided any descriptions that
might intimidate prospective members.</TE>
<TE>   A friend and photographer of golfing legends Old Tom Morris,
Alister MacKenzie and Hogan, Chisholm predicted a rich future for
Riviera's short par-four 10th: "I believe golf architects will copy
[the hole] throughout America because of its uniqueness of design."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Nicklaus has ranked the 10th and 18th holes among his
favorite 18 in major championship golf. Nicklaus, who came close to
several tournament wins at Riviera, frequently says the 10th has
inspired some of his designs.</TE>
<TE>   In the next morning's Herald Examiner, columnist Maxwell Stiles
wrote that the course was "artistic in design" and that Riviera "was
Southern California's newest and in many ways finest amphitheater of
golf."</TE>
<TE>   George Clark, a gallery member for the opening and an athletic
club official said: "I hope to see the day when the landscaped sides
of the canyon will be dotted with spectators looking down upon the
players in the $10,000, maybe more, Los Angeles Open tournament,
being played over two 18-hole courses of the Riviera golf club."</TE>
<TE>   Forty-one Los Angeles Opens, two PGA Championships and one U.S.
Open later, Clark's prognosis for Riviera as a storied tournament
venue is blemished only by the expectation for a second course at
Riviera, which was scrapped not long after opening day. In its place
evolved the Riviera Polo Club, a playground for Will Rogers, Walt
Disney, Elizabeth Taylor and host to 1932 Olympic Equestrian events.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the kilt-clad Chisholm, later famous for his 18th-green
announcements at the Los Angeles Open and a cameo in the movie on Ben
Hogan, "Follow the Sun," who prophesized Riviera's place in the world
of golf.</TE>
<TE>   "It will prove to be, mark my words, the training grounds of
future champions whose names will emblazon the golfing records of two
continents and bring credit and glory to the state of California,"
Chisholm wrote. "Some may curse it, but they will remain to love it,
because, like Old St. Andrews, it beams over with character. The name
Riviera will be known throughout the universe of golf as the Pine
Valley of the Western coast."</TE>

<LD>This result just in from the World Cup: Referees 4, Integrity of the
Sport 0.</LD>
<LD>   A harsh assessment? Hardly. Seldom before have so many grievous
mistakes been made by the very officials whose duty it is not to make
them, and angry comments are being voiced far and wide.</LD>
<LD>   The outcry comes not only from Italy and Spain, two countries that
were unjustly eliminated from the tournament as the direct result of
errors by game officials, but from the upper echelons of the sport.</LD>
<TE>   "I think the refereeing has been very, very poor," said Pele,
whose own playing career was marked by sportsmanship of the highest
order.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the shadow of the referees, this World Cup is already a
failure," said Diego Maradona, who knows a thing or two about being
able to cheat World Cup referees. For evidence, see his "hand of God"
goal in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Even Joseph "Sepp" Blatter, the president of FIFA and a man whose
first reaction in any crisis is to deny that one exists, has admitted
that the officiating, with a few notable exceptions, has been "a
disaster."</TE>
<TE>   The main point of contention has been the linesmen, the two
assistant referees on either side of the field whose duty consists of
nothing more complex than running up and down the sideline and waving
a flag when a foul is committed, a player is offside or the ball is
out of bounds.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, all too many of them have not been up to the task, buckling
under the pressure of the event or the pressure from the fans.</TE>
<TE>   Conspiracy theorists have even suggested that their "mistakes"
have been purposely orchestrated so that certain teams--read South
Korea and Brazil--can advance. No evidence exists to support that
claim.</TE>
<TE>   Michel Zen-Ruffinen, FIFA's general secretary and a former
referee, said that the World Cup linesmen "are scared and don't have
enough personality."</TE>
<TE>   That traces its roots to the wrong-headed way in which
international soccer's governing body selects its World Cup referees.
The "old boy" network comes into play. Politics come into play. Most
of all, political correctness comes into play.</TE>
<TE>   Competence, it is clear, does not come into play.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to please as many of its 204 member nations as
possible, FIFA casts a wide net when fishing for referees, making
sure that each continent and as many of the participating teams as
possible are represented.</TE>
<TE>   That leads to such ludicrous situations as Saturday's match
between South Korea and Spain, officiated by able and personable
referee Gamal Ghandour of Egypt, but ruined by the incompetence of
his assistants, Ali Tomusange of Uganda and Michael Ragoonath of
Trinidad and Tobago.</TE>
<TE>   What on earth were officials from the latter two countries even
doing at the World Cup? Unless they had proven their worth, they
should not have been allowed anywhere near the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   But there they were, and one of them, Ragoonath, denied Spain's
Fernando Morientes what would have been a game-winning goal in
overtime because he incorrectly ruled that the ball had gone out of
play before Morientes scored. TV replays showed that it came nowhere
near to doing so.</TE>
<TE>   But the call was made and South Korea went on to win.</TE>
<TE>   Italy, too, was the victim of numerous atrocious calls, having no
fewer than five goals disallowed on suspect grounds, including two
against South Korea. All of which caused the Corriera della Sera
newspaper to label this "the dirty World Cup" and to state that
"referees and linesmen have been used like mercenaries."</TE>
<TE>   Even Italian politicians got into the argument, claiming
conspiracy after Italy's overtime loss to South Korea, during which
referee Byron Moreno of Ecuador red-carded midfielder Francesco Totti
for allegedly diving.</TE>
<TE>   "The referee was a disgrace, absolutely scandalous," said Franco
Frattini, Italy's minister for public offices. "It seemed as if they
[presumably FIFA officials] just sat around a table and decided to
throw us out."</TE>
<TE>   The daily La Gazzetta dello Sport called the incident an
"outrage," and other Italian papers, preferring the personal touch,
went so far as to brand Moreno as "chubby," "bug-eyed" and
"immature."</TE>
<TE>   Moreno later claimed that FIFA backed him in his call, and lashed
out at complaining Italians, who had flooded FIFA with 400,000 angry
e-mails denouncing the officiating.</TE>
<TE>   "If they speak about corruption, it must be because they are
accustomed to practicing it," an angry Moreno told Chile's La Tercera
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   To his consternation, FIFA later said that upon review it appeared
that Moreno had made the wrong call when he ejected Totti.</TE>
<TE>   "At the speed of the game today, mistakes can happen," said
Edgardo Codesal Mendez, a member of FIFA referees' committee and the
man who refereed the 1990 World Cup final in Rome. "It is impossible
to see everything."</TE>
<TE>   If Blatter has the courage of his convictions--always a doubtful
proposition--these controversies will have been alleviated by the
time the next World Cup arrives in Germany in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole system of selecting and designating referees needs to
be looked at," Blatter said. "We must return to a trio of officials
of the same nationality because lack of communication has been the
cause of several mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Blatter said securing the best officials should be FIFA's main
duty, even if the World Cup referees end up coming from only four or
five nations.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, FIFA tried to quiet the growing chorus of dissent, with
Senes Erzik, head of its referees' committee, admitting that "there
have been one or two mistakes which are cause for concern."</TE>
<TE>   One or two? How about one or two a game? Two prime examples:</TE>
<TE>   * Mexico was denied a penalty kick in its game against the United
States when referee Vitor Melo Pereira of Portugal and his linesmen
failed to see U.S. midfielder John O'Brien punch the ball away with
his fist in the penalty area.</TE>
<TE>   * Belgium was robbed of a perfectly legitimate goal against Brazil
when referee Peter Prendergast of Jamaica claimed that Marc Wilmots
had fouled Brazil's Roque Junior before scoring. Prendergast even
admitted he had blown the call.</TE>
<TE>   "The referee apologized to me at halftime and told me he had made
a mistake," Wilmots said, "but it was a bit late then."</TE>
<TE>   Blatter tried to distance himself from the growing controversy by
saying he had specifically told the referees' committee to appoint
the best officials for the quarterfinals, regardless of origin.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to the meeting of this committee at the beginning of the
week and told them, 'Now please, for the quarterfinals take the best
men, wherever they are coming from, and even repeat them because we
cannot afford to have errors in the quarterfinals,' " Blatter told
Australian television.</TE>
<TE>   "My message was obviously understood in the committee but not
implemented."</TE>
<TE>   This nifty bit of footwork was too much to bear for FIFA Vice
President Angel Maria Villar, president of the Spanish Soccer
Federation and a member of the referees' committee.</TE>
<TE>   Villar resigned from the committee Sunday and said he would file a
formal protest with FIFA about the standard of refereeing at the
World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the referees have made serious errors," he told Marca, a
Spanish sports daily. "We will be presenting a complaint about the
conduct of the officials in which we will explain that we have been
negatively affected by their decisions. The damage has been done, but
we want to make sure that this sort of thing does not happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every country at this World Cup has been the victim of
dubious calls. Add them up and it is clear that the very outcome of
the tournament has been altered. No matter which team's captain is
handed the World Cup by Blatter after Sunday's final, it will be a
tarnished trophy.</TE>
<TE>   The winner's name will have to have an asterisk attached: "with
help from the referees."</TE>
<TE>   Amid all the fuss, canny Brazil Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has kept
largely silent, knowing that his team is only two victories from a
fifth world championship.</TE>
<TE>   "I have nothing to complain about," he said of the refereeing.
"Mistakes are happening, just like they happen in any competition, in
any part of the world. It's very easy to criticize the referees, but
I think they are about average."</TE>
<TE>   At the World Cup, average simply is not good enough.</TE>

<LD>After finishing second by a fingertip in three previous events,
Gabrielle Rose went home a winner Sunday at the TYR Swim Meet of
Champions. Rose, competing for the Irvine Novaquatics, won the
200-meter individual medley at the Marguerite Recreation Center in
Mission Viejo. Her time of 2 minutes 15.46 seconds was slightly
faster than her winning time at the Spring Nationals in March and
even more exceptional considering it was her seventh event of the
four-day meet.</LD>
<LD>   Her other results included second-place finishes in the 100 and
200 freestyles and 100 breaststroke, each by seven-tenths of a second
or less.</LD>
<LD>   "I was treating this meet as training for nationals [in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla.] in August," she said. "Normally, I don't swim this
many events."</LD>
<TE>   Rose, 24, is seeking a fourth national title in the 200 individual
medley, which requires all four strokes. She won the event in 2:15.59
at the Spring Nationals in March in Minneapolisr.</TE>
<TE>   "We're mostly trying to work on improvements in the breaststroke
and butterfly," said Dave Salo, coach of the Novaquatics. "And she
had improved a lot."</TE>
<TE>   It was a successful day for other Novaquatics.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Peirsol won the men's 100 backstroke in 56.81, shortly after
teammate Diana MacManus won the women's backstroke in 1:03.62.
Peirsol, the world-record holder in the 200 backstroke, graduated
from Newport Harbor High on Thursday and hoped to swim his specialty
at the meet Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I was going to try for swimmer of the meet, but I couldn't get up
[for the prelims Friday morning]," Peirsol said.</TE>
<TE>   Erin Sieper edged Rose by one-tenth of a second to win the 100
breaststroke in 1:11.01. Adrienne Binder won the 1,500 freestyle in
16:42.80. Erik Vendt won the 1,500 freestyle in 15:52.45.</TE>

<KH>TENNIS LISA DILLMAN</KH>
<HD>Sampras Stretching the Limits</HD>

<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>Granted, some of us are clumsier (more unlucky) than others. If there
is a chair to be bumped into, sure enough, the knee will find it.
Simply rolling over in bed to look at the alarm clock awkwardly can
mean a certain visit to the chiropractor.</LD>
<LD>   Which is why Sunday was a genuine revelation at Wimbledon. After
all these years, Pete Sampras  has a way to still cause something of
a surprise on the eve of this tournament.</LD>
<LD>   He is, as it turns out, just like you and me.</LD>
<TE>   Well, just like you and me ... only with 13 Grand Slam titles and
$42 million-plus in prize money.</TE>
<TE>   This new awareness came from his coach, Jose Higueras, in a brief
chat on the balcony near the practice courts at the All England Club
in the afternoon. Sampras, as the most recent champion in the field,
was scheduled to play the first match today on Centre Court,
befitting his stature here.</TE>
<TE>   But because of an injury suffered Saturday, a supposedly minor
one, he requested a Tuesday start. Club officials politely declined
his request but had another idea. "However, as is the case with all
players who ask for a late start, we were able to help him by putting
him on the third match on Monday," tournament referee Alan Mills
said.</TE>
<TE>   Andre Agassi, the champion here in 1992, will take the spotlight,
opening on Centre Court against Harel Levy of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Serena Williams, who plays Evie Dominikovic of Australia, will
follow Agassi. And Sampras, body permitting, will play local hope
Martin Lee of Maidenhead, England. Lee is struggling--to put it
mildly--at 1-13 at the tour level in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   But Sampras will face Lee at less than 100%. At first, his injury
was called a "tweak" of the back. Higueras said it was a strain of
the right lower ribs, which occurred Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras hurt himself by getting off a massage table. He has been
injured plenty of times, but this was a new one, a mishap coming off
the court, rather than on it. Higueras said tests showed no evidence
of a tear, however.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't even playing, he was getting up from the table from
being stretched and his back just got locked," Higueras said. "All of
a sudden, he felt something weird. It was one of those freak things."</TE>
<TE>   Tennis is well-known for quirky injuries but table-itis has its
own place now because of Sampras.</TE>
<TE>   This year alone, there was Venus Williams hurting her wrist by
picking up an equipment bag in Rome. (By the way, don't star players
hire someone to do that?)</TE>
<TE>   Then there was Tim Henman, who was injured simply walking around
the grounds at the tournament in Miami. He was heading to the court
and hurt himself by trying to clear the way of a spectator, thereby
tweaking his neck. Henman got through that match against Felix
Mantilla of Spain, somehow, but was forced to default in his
fourth-round match against Roger Federer of Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   There seems little danger of that happening with Sampras. Asked
whether he thought Sampras could play today, Higueras said: "I sure
do."</TE>
<TE>   For veteran Sampras watchers, at first glance, this one falls far
short of other ailments. Two years ago, Sampras won his seventh
Wimbledon and record-setting 13th Grand Slam event despite suffering
from tendinitis in the left shin and foot. It affected him from the
second round on and prevented Sampras from practicing on off days.</TE>
<TE>   There were doubters in the locker room, brought up by Sampras, in
fact. He said he felt the skepticism from some of the other players,
noting it in the lackluster handshake from one of his victims.</TE>
<TE>   That was his last singles title, now a span of 29 tournaments.
Sampras has reached two U.S. Open finals since and more recently lost
in the final at Houston on clay to Andy Roddick this year. On grass,
he struggled uncharacteristically, losing to Alex Corretja in Houston
in the Davis Cup quarterfinals and to Nicolas Kiefer in Halle,
Germany almost two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "From what I saw in Halle was not so good," said Peter Lundgren,
the coach of Federer, who beat Sampras here last year in the fourth
round.</TE>
<TE>   Lundgren said Sampras was not returning well, had no rhythm on his
serve and was lacking confidence. Those are hardly secrets. Higueras
was not in Halle, but the Spaniard reported that Sampras had been
looking good in practice, arriving here last Sunday. Higueras wasn't
making a big issue of the early loss in Halle.</TE>
<TE>   On the issue of confidence, Higueras said: "We don't talk about
that stuff. Obviously when you don't win much ... nothing beats
winning."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, and surprisingly, Sampras did receive something of a vote
of confidence from an often-frequent critic, John McEnroe, in the
Sunday Telegraph.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people seem to be of the opinion that Pete Sampras will
never win another Grand Slam," McEnroe wrote. "But certainly, as far
as Wimbledon is concerned, you would have to be crazy to rule him out
for at least a couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   "His form has been poor lately, but he's in good shape, he knows a
thing or two about winning on grass and he'll convince himself that
he has an eighth Wimbledon title in him."</TE>

<HD>Confident Jones Proves Again She Owns 200 Title</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>STANFORD</DL>
<LD>Marion Jones still can't be beaten in the 200 meters.</LD>
<LD>   Jones pulled away from Kelli White in the final few meters to win
her fifth consecutive national 200 title Sunday. Her time of 22.35
seconds was second fastest in the world this year. Only Jones herself
has run faster.</LD>
<LD>   Jones, who won an unprecedented five medals at the 2000 Sydney
Olympics, has not lost a 200 final since May 7, 1995. That streak
includes the 1999 World Championships, where she injured her back in
the 200 semifinals and did not compete in the final.</LD>
<TE>   On Saturday, Jones won her fourth national title in the 100.</TE>
<TE>   Jones has been invincible in both sprints since finishing second
to Zhanna Pintusevich-Block of Ukraine in the 100 final last summer
at the world championships.</TE>
<TE>   "My confidence is back, not that I ever lost it. But, without a
doubt, if you lose a race when you don't lose all that often, it's
bound to stir you up a bit and I think it did last year," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones planned to visit Alcatraz today, then fly to Europe for the
summer track season.</TE>
<TE>   Gail Devers won her fourth consecutive U.S. title in the women's
100-meter hurdles with a time of 12.51 seconds, best in the world
this year. She has won the national title in eight of 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Johnson won his third consecutive title in the men's
110-meter hurdles in 13.08, second fastest in the world this year. He
has won five national titles in the last seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Stacy Dragila won the women's pole vault for the fourth year in a
row, but missed three attempts at 15 feet 9 3/4 inches that would
have broken her world record.</TE>
<TE>   Dragila, who has five titles in the six years since the event
debuted at the national championships, cleared 15-3 for the victory.
Her world record, set last year at Stanford, remains 15-9.</TE>
<TE>   There were 16 other finals Sunday as the three-day U.S.
Championships ended.</TE>
<TE>   Regina Jacobs won the women's 1,500 for the eighth time in nine
years. Seneca Lassiter won the men's 1,500, his first national title
since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Sandra Glover won her fourth consecutive U.S. title in the women's
400-meter hurdles, James Carter won the men's 400 hurdles, Nathan
Leeper won his second consecutive title in the men's high jump, and
Walter Davis won the men's triple jump.</TE>
<TE>   Jearl Miles Clark won her fourth national title in the women's
400, and Alvin Harrison won the men's 400. Ramon Clay won the men's
200, Adam Setliff won his third consecutive national title in the
men's discus, and Anna Mahon won the women's hammer.</TE>
<TE>   David Krummenacker won the men's 800 for the second year in a row,
and Nicole Teter won the women's 800. Elizabeth Jackson won the
women's 3,000-meter steeplechase in 9 minutes 47.35 seconds, the
fastest time run on American soil, and Anthony Famiglietti won the
men's steeplechase. Tim Seaman won the men's 20-kilometer walk.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite admitting there have been refereeing mistakes, FIFA, soccer's
world governing body, reiterated Sunday that video replays would not
be used to help settle disputes.</LD>
<LD>   But some kind of video technology might be used in the future as a
way to determine whether the ball crossed the goal line, FIFA
spokesman Keith Cooper said.</LD>
<LD>   "No doubt as technology moves on, the pressure for adopting some
kind of video technology will increase," he said. "If any kind of
technology were to be introduced it would be solely for judging
whether the ball has crossed the line between the goalpost and under
the crossbar."</LD>
<TE>   Several countries, particularly Italy, Spain, Mexico and the

<HD>Yankees Are in Familiar Territory</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They beat Padres, 3-2, to take sole possession of
first place in AL East for first time since April 14.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The New York Yankees have been in first place enough to know that it
doesn't mean much until October.</LD>
<LD>   They scored a run in the ninth inning to beat the San Diego
Padres, 3-2, Sunday and take sole possession of first place in the
American League East for the first time since April 14.</LD>
<LD>   "It's nice to be in first place, but again, we are only in June,"
Manager Joe Torre said.</LD>
<TE>   Bernie Williams' bases-loaded groundout drove in the go-ahead run
and Steve Karsay closed it out with a perfect inning for his third
save.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just trying to make contact and put the ball in play hard,"
Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   Pinch-hitter Enrique Wilson drew a leadoff walk from Steve Reed
(1-3) in the ninth. After Alfonso Soriano struck out, Derek Jeter
singled to move Wilson to second.</TE>
<TE>   Padre closer Trevor Hoffman came in and walked Nick Johnson to
load the bases. Williams followed with a grounder to first baseman
Kevin Barker, who looked home but decided he had no play on Wilson
and took the out at first.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the winning run. If I had to do it over again, maybe I throw
home," Barker said. "But talking to the guys watching, they said he
was already sliding."</TE>
<TE>   Ramiro Mendoza (5-2) pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings for the
victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees took a 2-0 lead in the seventh. Rondell White hit a
one-out solo homer against starter Brian Lawrence.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Mussina, who had his second career multihit game, singled to
right field and went to second on an error by Gene Kingsale.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano followed with an infield single, and Jeter drove in
Mussina with a single to left.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres scored twice in the bottom half. Ramon Vazquez had a
leadoff walk, and Wiki Gonzalez was hit by a pitch from Mussina with
one out.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Stanton replaced Mussina and induced pinch-hitter Ron Gant to
hit a check-swing grounder to the mound. It appeared that Stanton had
a play at third, but he took the safe out at first.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza came in with two out and runners on second and third to
face Deivi Cruz, who hit an 0-and-1 curveball up the middle for a
two-run single.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Kotsay followed with a double to center that dropped in front
of a sliding Williams. Ray Lankford was intentionally walked, and
Barker grounded out to first to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   "We played them tough," Manager Bruce Bochy said. "That's another
hard one to lose."</TE>
<TE>   A crowd of 50,050 saw Mussina throw 6 1/3 strong innings, giving
up four hits and striking out seven.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence also pitched an effective 6 1/3 innings, giving up two
runs and eight hits.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees had a scoring opportunity cut down in the fifth.
Mussina hit a one-out single to center, and Soriano followed with a
double to center.</TE>
<TE>   The ball one-hopped the fence, where Kotsay fielded it and relayed
to second baseman Vazquez, who made a perfect throw to catcher Tom
Lampkin, who tagged out Mussina.</TE>
<TE>   "Running the bases, especially at full speed, takes quite a bit
out of you," Mussina said. "That was a long way to run. I haven't
gone first to home in a long time. Hopefully, I won't have to do it
again any time soon."</TE>

<HD>Afghan Arsenal Found</HD>
<DH>Weapons: British forces uncover a cache that may have
belonged to Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>British marines broke into a suspicious village compound in
southeastern Afghanistan over the weekend and discovered a huge cache
of guns, mortars and explosives that may have belonged to Al Qaeda
and Taliban militants.</LD>
<LD>   The marines said the stash in Surwipan was one of the largest
caches they have found in weeks of searching the area around the town
of Khowst, near the Pakistan border. More than 10 men were also found
in the compound, and some were detained.</LD>
<LD>   "We were taken aback by the amount of stuff here," Sgt. Buck Ryan
said.</LD>
<TE>   The surprise find came Saturday when a patrol of marines from
Britain's 45 Commando Group spotted a large antenna array on top of
the compound.</TE>
<TE>   The troops smashed through the compound's stone wall. The men
inside surrendered without a fight. Eight were brought to a military
interrogation center at Bagram air base, north of the capital, Kabul,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The armory included hundreds of large mortar rounds and rockets;
65,000 rounds of small arms ammunition; rocket launchers;
antiaircraft machine guns; and large mortar launchers.</TE>
<TE>   There were also several boxes of plastic explosives as well as
timers, detonation cords and other equipment for making bombs and
booby traps, said Sgt. Colin Hill, a munitions expert.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Kabul, the new central government faced a fresh
round of difficulty Sunday as the former interior minister publicly
questioned the legitimacy of most of President Hamid Karzai's Cabinet
and said he may organize a new opposition party.</TE>
<TE>   Younis Qanooni spoke to reporters a day after government TV
announced that he had been appointed education minister and
presidential national security advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Qanooni, an ethnic Tajik, said he had not decided whether to
accept either appointment. He said he was considering forming a
opposition party instead. If he refuses to join the government,
Qanooni, who has a small army loyal to him, would be the first
significant leader to break with the administration.</TE>

<LD>Tests that detected nerve and mustard gas traces at a base in
Uzbekistan used by U.S. troops gave false readings, and there is no
contamination at the site, a U.S. spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   This month, a team found traces of what it thought were chemical
weapons at the base in Karshi Khanabad. U.S. troops were moved out of
several structures.</LD>
<LD>   But later analysis of wood, soil and concrete samples from the
site, as well as the devices used in the tests, found no traces of
chemical weapons, Col. Roger King said at Bagram air base in
Afghanistan. He said chemicals used to treat lumber used at the site
may have caused the false results.</LD>

<LD>   The refugees arrived in South Korea early today on a flight from
Bangkok, Thailand. Earlier, two North Koreans who had sought refuge
in the Canadian Embassy in the Chinese capital arrived in Seoul.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a bilateral agreement to repatriate North Koreans, China
has allowed at least 38 other asylum seekers to fly to Seoul through
a third country since March. Sunday's move to permit more refugees to
join them underscored the government's unwillingness to tarnish its
international reputation for the sake of its Communist ally.</LD>
<TE>   "China has been criticized on its human rights record and its
treatment of refugees," said Warren Cohen, a China expert at the
University of Maryland-Baltimore County. "This is a way to get rid of
the bad press. The key is how much does it lose with North Korea.
Chances are, not much."</TE>
<TE>   Beijing appears to have covered all the bases in calculating its
best interests. For the North Korean regime in Pyongyang, it tried
hard to block the asylum seekers. It even sent security forces into
the South Korean visa office, and they dragged out the father of a
teenage boy and punched out diplomats who tried to stop them. An
outraged Seoul demanded an apology from Beijing for violating
international law. The father was among those allowed to leave
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing also offended Tokyo when its guards entered a Japanese
Consulate in northern China last month and wrestled down a North
Korean mother with her baby. The skirmish was broadcast around the
world and provoked an international outcry.</TE>
<TE>   Those refugees were allowed to leave for Seoul. But the ones holed
up in the South Korean Embassy offices--the first of whom entered May
23--faced a longer wait for a resolution of their cases. There was no
sign of a breakthrough until Friday, when Beijing said that a
pregnant woman would be permitted to go.</TE>
<TE>   China continues to insist that such North Korean emigres are
illegal immigrants, not political refugees. It won't allow United
Nations inspectors to interview them within its borders, so there's
no way they can claim refugee status. Without such protection,
thousands of North Koreans have been shipped home to face harsh
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   But those who have participated in well-publicized dashes for
freedom into various foreign compounds in China have put their plight
on the international radar and thrown Beijing into a diplomatic jam.</TE>
<TE>   The city responded by transforming its leafy embassy district into
a fortress of barbed wire and armed guards. The message seems clear:
China does not welcome the hundreds of thousands of North Koreans who
have already penetrated its borders, and it does not intend to permit
any more break-ins at its foreign missions.</TE>
<TE>   To the rest of the world, however, allowing the two dozen North
Koreans to reach the South presents a different image of China--one
of a nation that is flexible enough to bend the rules so that people
won't have to return to a country where they will almost certainly
face hunger and persecution.</TE>
<TE>   "China can't afford to spoil its relationship with other
countries," said Shen Dingli, a specialist in international affairs
at Fudan University in Shanghai. "If we permit them to leave, our
relationship with North Korea would be slightly impaired. Our
relationship with other countries will not be impaired at all. In
fact, they will respect China's move."</TE>
<TE>   The risk remains that the humanitarian gesture could provoke a new
wave of asylum seekers. If the Pyongyang regime collapses as a result
of a mass exodus, Beijing will lose a buffer zone against
American-backed South Korea and jeopardize its cherished influence on
the tense Korean peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   In all likelihood, observers say, China will intensify the
crackdown by tightening security at its northern border, where the
population includes many ethnic Koreans who have long offered shelter
to destitute brethren searching for food and refuge. The government
will probably aim to capture asylum seekers before they can reach
Beijing and stage more run-ins.</TE>
<TE>   But China can't stop the escalating refugee crisis any more than
Washington can prevent Mexicans from risking their lives to cross
into the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Despite war-zone-like security, three North Koreans made it into
the South Korean Embassy offices here over the last several days.
Insiders say they probably got past the guards using fake identity
papers.</TE>
<TE>   "The conditions are so bad, they don't need much encouragement,"
Cohen said. "The alternative is starving to death."</TE>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A desert fortress where Jewish rebels fought the Romans and the
gravesite of Israel's first prime minister are among 58 Israeli
tourist sites to be closed this week because of the Middle East
crisis.</LD>
<LD>   "We are ceasing operations as a result of the security situation
and the resulting dearth of tourism, which has meant an 80% drop in
admission receipts," a spokesman for Israel's Nature Reserves and
Parks Authority said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The 58 nature and antiquities sites will be shut down by week's
end and left unguarded, he said.</LD>
<TE>   These include the 1st century hilltop fortress of Masada and the
gravesite of David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister.</TE>

<HD>Iranian Officials Reduce Earthquake Toll Figure</HD>
<DH>Mideast: State says 230 were killed in Saturday's temblor,
amid confusion over numbers. Aid workers struggle to help thousands
of homeless.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>Rescue workers were running low on tents and blankets Sunday for the
tens of thousands of Iranians left homeless after a powerful
earthquake the day before damaged or leveled more than 100 villages
in the mountains northwest of Tehran.</LD>
<LD>   Yet even as workers dug with shovels and bare hands through mounds
of dirt and splintered debris, desperately searching for
survivors--or corpses--the government reduced by more than half the
number of estimated casualties. On Saturday, the state said the quake
had killed at least 500 people and left about 2,000 injured.</LD>
<LD>   "The earthquake caused 227 deaths in the Qazvin region and three
in Hamadan, and around 1,000 injured in total," state television
quoted a government statement as saying Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Still, there was some confusion about the figures. In the capital
of Qazvin, the province where the quake's epicenter was located, Gov.
Jalaleddin Sharafi issued a statement saying that 500 burial permits
had already been issued. In Zanjan province, northwest of Qazvin, an
additional five bodies had been located, the state news service
said--after the lower casualty estimates were released.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the final tallies, there seemed to be no end to the
misery that enveloped community after community in a region known
mostly for its vineyards and as a weekend getaway for wealthy
residents of the capital.</TE>
<TE>   In the oasis village of Changoureh, official reports said, only
two of the village's 100 houses were intact and the number of
confirmed dead had reached about 120.</TE>
<TE>   The government said it had pitched about 4,000 tents to care for
the homeless and had gotten water and electricity service to most of
the needy. But in some areas, survivors were forced to huddle around
campfires in the frigid night air. In the hard-hit town of Avej,
Reuters news service reported, 60 survivors threw stones at Interior
Minister Abdul Vahed Musavi-Lari's convoy as it passed through the
area. They said the government had abandoned them.</TE>
<TE>   "My child died, and the local people helped me to bring him out of
the rubble. Only local people are helping," said a man in the
mountain town about 130 miles west of Tehran.</TE>
<TE>   Frustration and anguish were widespread. State television showed
image after image of parents crying over their dead children, young
and old huddling in the grass and debris, shocked at the magnitude of
their losses, both individual and collective.</TE>
<TE>   Homes were gone. Families were gone. And so were whole
communities.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know whose house is whose. I don't know whose belongings
are whose belongings. My father. Oh, my father," said Assad Mohammed,
a Tehran resident, as he stood over a heap of tangled debris where
his childhood home once stood in the village of Abdareh. His father,
two sisters, a nephew, a niece and other relatives had all been
crushed to death.</TE>
<TE>   Abdareh was among the hardest-hit villages. About 45 families have
lived there, and at least 20 bodies had been recovered by late
Sunday. At a cemetery overlooking the village, dazed survivors
huddled in groups. They sobbed as they placed their loved ones into
fresh graves carved out by bulldozers.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing left to live for," cried Majid Torabi, 16, as he
rested his head beside his parents' graves.</TE>
<TE>   The magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck at about 7:30 a.m. Saturday.
It was felt across eight provinces, including in Tehran, where
buildings swayed but no damage was reported. It left thousands
homeless, mainly in the Qazvin provincial district of Bouynzahra, the
epicenter, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.</TE>
<TE>   The catastrophe was by all accounts inevitable. Iran is one of the
most seismically active regions on Earth; beneath it, three tectonic
plates meet, rub and collide. But a bigger problem is the way many
rural houses are built. Timbers, brick and plaster are all that is
used. The construction is so primitive, so fragile, that houses have
been known to cave in after the faint tremors that rock Iran almost
daily.</TE>
<TE>   "The mud brick houses turn into dust," said Morteza Shahbodaghi, a
Red Crescent Society relief worker in the quake area. "They are
neither sturdy nor allow for easy rescue."</TE>
<TE>   The casualty rate might well have been higher, but Saturday is the
first day of the workweek for many in Iran, and a number of men had
already gone out to tend their grapes and fruit orchards.</TE>
<TE>   In the hours immediately after the quake, the government and Red
Crescent said that the death toll had hit 500 and that the number was
expected to rise. On Sunday, Iran's morning newspapers reported the
number of dead at more than 500. The newspaper Hamshahri quoted an
anonymous official in the Bouynzahra governor's office saying that
there were still 150 bodies to be recovered in the villages of
Changoureh and Abdareh alone, and that 200 people had died in
Changoureh.</TE>
<TE>   But as condolences began to pour in from around the world, and as
Germany and Kuwait offered cash to help with rescue and recovery
efforts, the state news service issued its updated figures. It quoted
a Red Crescent official as saying only that the initial figure was
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Officials did not, however, lower their estimate of 5,000 houses
flattened, and if anything, with at least 21 aftershocks having
rolled through the region, that figure was expected to climb.
Meanwhile, at least 25,000 people were reported to be homeless over a
wide rural area, and the state news service quoted an official in
Bouynzahra as saying that aid workers were running short of tents.</TE>
<TE>   The Iranian government, particularly the conservative religious
leadership, is often loath to accept aid from Western countries,
particularly the U.S., which it still calls "the great Satan." But in
this case, it appeared ready to set aside animosities, if only
temporarily, to get food and shelter to the people.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Tehran would accept an offer of assistance that
Washington made, Musavi-Lari, the interior minister, told Reuters,
"We are ready to accept all aid from NGOs," or nongovernmental
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Musavi-Lari toured the village of Qanuraeh on Sunday and expressed
the government's condolences.</TE>
<TE>   "Our job was to recover the bodies, but from today we have to
think of reconstruction during the summer, before it gets cold in the
winter," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The government also, it seems, was willing to confront another
taboo--dogs. Because Islamic teaching says that dogs are unclean,
authorities have been reluctant to use dogs to locate victims trapped
under the rubble. Twelve years ago, after a major earthquake,
officials refused to use dogs. This time, witnesses said, they were
using German shepherds.</TE>
<TE>   An eyewitness said that one village was flooded with hundreds of
ambulances and large numbers of soldiers but that villagers had asked
for additional dogs, saying they would be more useful.</TE>
<TE>   Haleh Anvari in Tehran and Borzou Daragahi in Abdareh contributed
to this report.</TE>

<DL>ROSTOV-ON-DON, Russia</DL>
<LD>Residents across southern Russia began shoveling mud from their

<HD>Arts Fest Gives Maestro a Place in Russian Sun</HD>
<DH>Culture: Conductor Valery Gergiev's star shines at St.
Petersburg's 'White Nights' festival, an event that is a point of
pride for the nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. PETERSBURG, Russia</DL>
<LD>It is 1:30 in the morning and the sky is bathed in the midnight sun's
dusky light.</LD>
<LD>   Valery Gergiev, the high-energy maestro of the Maryinsky Theater,
has walked out into the courtyard of  the restaurant next door ("The
maestro must get some air," says a minion) after hosting a collection
of friends at a post-concert dinner. It is the middle of the "Stars
of the White Nights" arts festival, and the courtyard is a good spot
for him to use his ever-present mobile phone to search for an
emergency stand-in baritone for the next day's performance of
Tchaikovsky's "The Queen of Spades."</LD>
<LD>   Despite the hour and the frenetic pace of life in St. Petersburg
every June during the festival, the indefatigable, stubble-bearded
Gergiev is bubbling with new ideas. Looking around at the courtyard,
he remarks offhandedly to a colleague: "Wouldn't this be a nice place
to hold a party?"</LD>
<TE>   These are the days of excitement at the 142-year-old Maryinsky,
still often called by its Soviet-era name, the Kirov, as it welcomes
well-heeled music lovers from Western Europe and the United States on
an annual pilgrimage to Peter the Great's city on the Neva River for
the four weeks when the sun doesn't set, or just barely, on this far
northern metropolis.</TE>
<TE>   Symbol of Greatness</TE>
<TE>   For St. Petersburgers, and for Russians as a whole, the festival
has become a point of pride and a symbol of the greatness that they
believe lies latent in their country--even if the nation has been
shorn of its Soviet empire and has had to struggle through a
traumatic decade of economic and political transformation.</TE>
<TE>   "The festival is living proof that a human genius is capable of
overcoming the unfriendly circumstances that make the majority of
people in Russia lose heart," said Mikhail Byalik, secretary of the
Russian Union of Composers. "It demonstrates what opportunities are
out there, provided one is proactive."</TE>
<TE>   Gergiev, 49, an ethnic Ossetian from the Caucasus region who, as a
young music student, adopted St. Petersburg as home, jets to the Met
in New York, Covent Garden in London and Salzburg in Austria,
conducting some of the world's greatest orchestras, spreading the
gospel of Russian opera and introducing new audiences to Russian
composers such as Prokofiev, Mussorgsky and Shostakovich.</TE>
<TE>   He remains above all passionately loyal to the Maryinsky--where he
is loved, if sometimes grumbled at, for his headstrong style and
exhausting demands--and for the last 10 years has made "White Nights"
a showcase for the 2,000 performers in the theater's ballet corps,
opera company, two orchestras and youth symphony.</TE>
<TE>   This year's festival, which runs until June 30, includes 31 major
performances, a charity concert, an outdoor staging of "Boris
Godunov'' in the medieval Vyborg castle, and a summer solstice ball
held at the former imperial palace of Peterhof.</TE>
<TE>   Focus on Russians</TE>
<TE>   The program has been designed to play to the Maryinsky's
strengths: its core Russian repertoire. Gergiev himself expects to
conduct at least 20 times during the month, a staggering pace that
one critic said proves that the troupe can adapt to anything--"even
living in a permanent madhouse."</TE>
<TE>   Although the performances have drawn raves, Gergiev is modestly
calling this a "preparedness year" in which his performers are
marshaling their real efforts for next year's gala 300th anniversary
of the founding of St. Petersburg.</TE>
<TE>   Highlights have included tenor Vladimir Galuzin's anguished tour
de force as the darkly obsessed Herman in "The Queen of Spades" and
Alexei Ratmansky's remake of the "Cinderella" ballet by Prokofiev
with modern costumes, a bag-woman fairy godmother and astounding
leaps by male principal dancer Andrei Merkuryev. The festival also
revived a concert performance of the opera "The Story of a Real Man,"
the first at the theater since 1948. (The opera was written by
Prokofiev while he was under a political cloud, and for many years it
was censored by Soviet authorities.)</TE>
<TE>   When the festival was born in 1992, it consisted of only 14
performances and concerts.</TE>
<TE>   Gergiev, who took over the Maryinsky opera in 1988 and was named
artistic director of the theater in 1996, said the festival has grown
year by year, even when Russia was in decline. "The situation was
worsening, and at the same time we were becoming more and more
confident, and we were getting more and more known," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It has already become a tradition," said Valentin A. Zakharov,
tourism spokesman for St. Petersburg. He said the festival, which is
centered on the Maryinsky but also includes performances at the St.
Petersburg Philharmonic, is a drawing card for thousands of tourists.</TE>
<TE>   "In fact," he said, "the festival has become one of the most
successfully marketed tourist products in St. Petersburg."</TE>
<TE>   Leonid Gakkel, prominent art critic in the city, said he's been
won over by the festival. "All the halls and auditoriums are crammed,
all the tickets are sold out, there are scores of people
everywhere....The energy the festival imparts is immense."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the high-brow arts, tourists are drawn by a wealth of
other attractions: late-night cabarets, jazz, art shows and simply
the charm of staying up all night with the sun and watching the
opening of the drawbridges on the romantic Neva.</TE>
<TE>   Although many of the city's salmon, blue, aquamarine and mustard
buildings have fallen into neglect, with broken plaster and cracked
facades, the classical lines of the 18th century architecture
stretching along curved streets and riverboat-plied canals are
beguiling, particularly in summer's half-night.</TE>
<TE>   With St. Petersburg laid out so perfectly and exactingly, it's
hard to conceive that thousands of serfs gave their lives hewing the
city out of the frozen wilderness and draining its swamps three
centuries ago to fulfill the iron will of the Europeanizing czar who
wanted Russia to have an outlet to the sea and become a naval power.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the most perfect cities in the world--and it is as
though divine help made it possible," Gergiev said.</TE>
<TE>   Others speak in the same awed tones of Gergiev himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Just like Peter the Great reared Russia like a horse 300 years
ago and introduced it in the community of civilized European
countries, Gergiev--in a powerful burst--has managed to place the
Maryinsky among the world's most prominent and known theaters," said
Byalik, of the composers' union.</TE>
<TE>   Some artists are unhappy about how Gergiev manages the theater,
Byalik acknowledged. "They accuse him of anything short of
totalitarianism.... Indeed, there is a grain of truth in the
charges--the policies are almost despotic, and competition is harsh."
And in his rush to get things done, even Gergiev's friends admit,
some details get overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   But the criticisms largely give way to admiration for the way
Gergiev stays on top of his enormous creative and management
challenges. He is traveling, organizing festivals, conducting most
nights and running a huge organization, all at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   "A director like Maestro Gergiev is a phenomenon," art critic
Gakkel said. "People of such willpower, such grand scale, with such
readiness to get things done without waiting for somebody else to do
it, and with such desire to go beyond the limit of their own
capabilities, are a huge rarity in today's Russia."</TE>
<TE>   Gergiev's achievement, Gakkel said, is that the Maryinsky--unlike
many other Russian artistic institutions--is now well beyond simply
fighting for its survival.</TE>
<TE>   "It does not have to survive anymore--it can afford the luxury of
creating," Gakkel said.</TE>

<HD>Founder of Hamas Under House Arrest</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Arafat acts against the militant group's spiritual
mentor 'to safeguard the ... Palestinian people,' officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>GAZA CITY</DL>
<LD>The Palestinian Authority placed the founder and spiritual mentor of
the Islamic militant group Hamas under house arrest here today,
Palestinian security officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The move against Sheik Ahmed Yassin came after the Palestinians
arrested dozens of Hamas members in the Gaza Strip on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "It was decided, starting from tonight, to impose house arrest on
Sheik Ahmed Yassin to safeguard the ultimate national interests of
the Palestinian people," a security official said. "The decision was
issued from high up, from President Yasser Arafat."</LD>
<TE>   Abdel-Hamid Yassin, a son of the cleric, said Palestinian
Authority security service units had taken up two positions within
200 yards of their home.</TE>
<TE>   The last time Yassin was placed under house arrest, in December, a
Hamas supporter was killed in an ensuing clash with Palestinian
police in Gaza City.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas does not recognize Israel's right to exist, and militants
belonging to the movement have claimed responsibility for many
attacks against Israelis, including a bus bombing Tuesday that killed
19 people and the bomber in southern Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after Yassin's house arrest was announced, Israeli
helicopters fired missiles at a car carrying suspected Palestinian
militants near Rafah, in southern Gaza, killing six people. Their
identities were not immediately known.</TE>
<TE>   Israel Radio said the attack was the latest strike under a policy
to deliberately target and kill Palestinian militants behind suicide
bombings.</TE>

<HD>Steel Prices Stoke Tariff Backlash</HD>
<DH>Manufacturing: As costs climb, downstream industries such
as auto makers and suppliers call for Bush to reduce or rescind
import duties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Steel prices have risen sharply since President Bush imposed import
tariffs three months ago, causing unexpected hardship in
steel-consuming industries and fueling a political backlash that
could hurt the White House.</LD>
<LD>   Prices of benchmark steel products have soared 30% to 50% this
year, far more than predicted when the president slapped tariffs of
as much as 30% on steel imports to protect domestic producers from
foreign competition.</LD>
<LD>   The tariffs were widely viewed as politically motivated, a bid by
Bush to win Republican votes in the Steel Belt of Pennsylvania, West
Virginia and Ohio. But much of the negative effect is in the adjacent
Rust Belt, where auto makers and their thousands of suppliers are
huge customers of the steel industry.</LD>
<TE>   "I think he's doing more harm to the country than he realizes,"
said Michael Aznavorian, president of Clips &amp; Clamps Industries in
Plymouth, Mich., whose firm has been hit with price increases of 17%
to 42%.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Commerce Department and U.S. trade
representative's office declined to comment on the price increases.
But Grant Aldonas, undersecretary of Commerce for international
trade, has acknowledged that the administration had not expected the
initial price spike and was concerned about its potential economic
effect.</TE>
<TE>   Steel industry officials insist that the effect of the price
increases is being exaggerated. Much of the steel consumed in the
U.S. is purchased under long-term contracts that have not been
affected by price spikes, which are occurring on the spot market.
Even spot prices are not that high by historical standards. The
average price of hot-rolled steel from 1981 through 2000 was $338 a
ton, about the same as today's spot price.</TE>
<TE>   "It's some of the smaller steel consumers who are more subject to
spot market pricing who are making the hue and cry," said Nancy
Gravatt of the American Iron and Steel Institute, which represents
steelmakers. "When steel prices were at 20-year lows last December,
they should have been projecting in their business plans for 2002
that the price would increase."</TE>
<TE>   Even the president's critics acknowledge that other factors are
contributing to the price increases. More than 20 U.S. steel mills
have shut down or gone on standby in the last 18 months, reducing
steelmaking capacity by 25 million tons. For the first time in years,
U.S. steel companies can't keep up with demand, which is beginning to
revive as the economy emerges from recession. The supply shortfall
will be alleviated somewhat when new owners of shuttered plants
previously operated by steelmaker LTV Corp. bring some capacity back
on line in coming months.</TE>
<TE>   "The moderate upturn in the economy, combined with the supply
shortage, is what is really driving up the prices," said Ben
Goodrich, a steel analyst at the Institute for International
Economics in Washington. "I think it has very little to do with the
tariffs."</TE>
<TE>   But such explanations are viewed with skepticism by the people who
buy raw steel and turn it into finished products.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's baloney," said Bruce Walker, who runs a
metal-forming plant in Ontario. "As soon as the tariffs were
announced, the prices went up immediately. Isn't that a coincidence?"</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, low supplies of certain types of steel are causing
buyers to scramble to negotiate future purchases before prices rise
further. Profit margins are being squeezed in steel-using industries,
which have been absorbing higher costs rather than raise prices and
risk losing business to foreign rivals. There is talk of future
layoffs, business failures, factory relocations--and political
retribution.</TE>
<TE>   "There's definitely a panic mentality out there," said steel
industry consultant Christopher Plummer of West Chester, Pa.-based
Metal Strategies. "I don't think there's anyone in the market ... who
expected anywhere near this kind of magnitude."</TE>
<TE>   The tariffs also have triggered threats of retaliation by Europe
and other U.S. trading partners.</TE>
<TE>   It could be several more months before the tariffs work their way
through the steel markets and the effects become clear, experts say.
But barely three months after the tariffs took effect, the
dislocations are undeniable.</TE>
<TE>   Hot-rolled sheet steel sells for about $340 a ton on the spot
market, according to the June survey by Purchasing Magazine. The
price has shot up 62% since December, when steel fell to 20-year
lows, and has gained 48% in the months since Bush issued his tariff
order.</TE>
<TE>   For Walker, president of Walker Corp., a 48-year-old family-owned
firm, the arithmetic is scary. Walker's company employs about 130
people, and rang up nearly $20 million in sales last year. It paid
about $5 million for the steel it used to make brackets for air bags,
cases for car stereos and other parts. If prices rise 20%, Walker's
profit margin could disappear.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very concerned about the next year. If I can't pass these
increases along to the customer, we will definitely have to reduce
our work force," Walker said. "I'm a conservative by nature and
generally support the president, but this was a huge mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Steel users are lobbying the White House to rescind or reduce the
tariffs before their scheduled expiration in 2005. Failing that, they
want the administration to be generous in awarding tariff exemptions
for steel products not produced in large quantities by U.S. mills.
The administration received more than 1,200 exemption requests; it
has approved 107.</TE>
<TE>   Bush announced March 5 that he was placing temporary tariffs of as
much as 30% on some categories of imported steel to give the domestic
industry more breathing room to restructure. The action was based on
a trade law that allows the president to protect U.S. industries
whose survival is threatened by surging imports.</TE>
<TE>   At the time tariffs were imposed, many industry executives,
administration officials and independent economists predicted the
effect on steel consumers would be limited. Average steel prices
might rise 5% over time, they said, but not enough to cause
appreciable damage. It now appears the administration may have
miscalculated, in both economic and political terms.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever was advising him, I don't think they understood how fast
the prices would increase and how much harm could be done," said Roy
Berlin, president of Berlin Metals in Hammond, Ind. "I think the
mills themselves have been caught by surprise at how tight the
market's been. They are in a dream world right now of being able to
sell any ton at almost any price."</TE>
<TE>   Steel buyers said the higher prices, if they stick, are bound to
reduce employment in industries that are major buyers of steel. For
some firms, that could mean layoffs; for others, fewer new hires.</TE>
<TE>   At GR Spring &amp; Stamping in Grand Rapids, Mich., 10 jobs already
have evaporated. That's how many people President Jim Zawacki was
planning to hire to crank out a new line of engine compartment parts
for a major automotive supplier. But when he revised his terms in
April to reflect higher steel prices, the deal fell apart.</TE>
<TE>   "We submitted a bid subject to what happened with the tariffs,"
said Zawacki, who keeps about 200 people busy making metal parts for
cars, appliances and furniture. "We would have been hiring in 2002."</TE>
<TE>   He said an additional three jobs were lost when a customer took
his business to Mexico, where metal-forming firms can buy steel at
tariff-free prices. Zawacki has not laid off anyone since the tariffs
took effect, but he said he will have fewer employees by year's end
than if Bush had not intervened.</TE>
<TE>   Aznavorian, of Clips &amp; Clamps Industries, said his suppliers no
longer are willing to enter into "blanket" contracts that lock in
prices for six months to a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody will give us a blanket," said Aznavorian, whose 60
employees generate about $10 million in annual sales. "We're
basically buying everything on the open market. It's eating up my
bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   One of Clips &amp; Clamps' main products is a bracket used to mount
cruise control units in DaimlerChrysler trucks. Before prices began
rising, Aznavorian saw a profit of about 1 cent on each 57-cent
bracket that rolled off his line, with the steel used in each costing
25 cents. But the steel in each bracket now costs 37 cents, and Clips
&amp; Clamps could lose 11 cents on each bracket it ships.</TE>
<TE>   Aznavorian and other steel-buying executives say they hope Bush
will rescind or relax the tariffs after reviewing the effect they are
having on downstream industries.</TE>

<HD>Frustration Growing Over Anthrax Killer</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Although the inquiry has become a learning
process, there are few leads.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The anthrax investigation is producing a body of
knowledge about the deadly germ, but it has not led to an arrest, and
that is drawing a hint of frustration in the capital.</LD>
<LD>   "That anthrax killer is out there," Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer
of California said Sunday. "We need to nab this person."</LD>
<LD>   The hunt involves highly complex science and results should not be
expected quickly, other lawmakers said. "It's just a very tough
case," said Democratic Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, chairman of the
Senate Intelligence Committee.</LD>
<TE>   He said investigators have learned that "anthrax is not as
difficult to construct or compound as we had thought it to be," a
finding bound to widen the pool of potential suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "Eventually we will know these things," said House Majority Leader
Dick Armey (R-Texas). "But we must be diligent, thorough, persistent
and patient."</TE>
<TE>   Eight months after the mail attacks killed five people, standard
investigative techniques have not cracked the case, special genetic
fingerprinting did not yield results and other scientific methods are
being explored.</TE>
<TE>   The office of Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), where
an anthrax-laced letter was found, shares a ventilation system with
Boxer's quarters, and members of her staff were put on an antibiotic
for 60 days as a precaution.</TE>
<TE>   "This hits home in my heart," she said on CNN's "Late Edition."</TE>
<TE>   In a swipe at the effort being poured into creating a Homeland
Security Department, she said officials should spend less time
reorganizing themselves and more time going after the bottom line:
crushing the Al Qaeda terrorist network and finding the anthrax
killer.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have concluded that the mailed anthrax was less than
two years old, the New York Times reported Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The finding indicates that whoever sent the germs could make more,
gives credence to the theory that the mailer had links to a
microbiology laboratory and casts doubt on the idea that the attacker
tapped a limited supply of an old lab sample.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Jewish Group to Proceed With Armed Residents Watch</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A right-wing rabbi said Sunday he expects members of his group to be
arrested when they make armed patrols of Jewish neighborhoods this
week because of terrorism warnings.</LD>
<LD>   When Rabbi Yakove Lloyd announced the armed patrols two weeks ago,
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said anyone carrying a gun would
be arrested.</LD>
<LD>   "If we see a violation of the law we will take appropriate
action," a police spokeswoman said.</LD>
<TE>   Lloyd said about 50 members of his group would patrol the
neighborhoods from midnight to 6 a.m. on three random days of the
week. He said only those licensed and trained would carry firearms,
the rest would carry baseball bats.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd said he expected those with guns to be arrested but was
prepared to go ahead anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a saying in Talmudic law: 'He who comes to slay you, you
slay first,' " Lloyd said .</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd conceived of the patrols after fugitive Abdul Rahman Yasin
told CBS' "60 Minutes" that those responsible for the 1993 World
Trade Center bombing had originally targeted Jewish neighborhoods in
Brooklyn.</TE>
<TE>   He suspended the patrols after an overwhelmingly negative response
in two neighborhoods. He said he renewed the plan after the FBI
warned Friday that terrorists could be plotting attacks on Jewish
schools and synagogues.</TE>

<LD>Salt Lake City authorities trying to solve the disappearance of
14-year-old Elizabeth Smart were able to glean "helpful" information
from a young drifter hospitalized in West Virginia, police said.</LD>
<LD>   But Bret Michael Edmunds, who was the subject of a nationwide
search before he turned up at City Hospital in Martinsburg last week,
is still not considered a suspect after undergoing two days of
questioning in an intensive care unit guarded by U.S. marshals.</LD>
<LD>   "At this time, he's still a witness. All along, that's all we
wanted to talk to him about," said Salt Lake City Police Sgt. Fred
Louis.</LD>
<TE>   There was no word on what Edmunds told investigators, other than
giving them permission to search his car for hair, fibers and cloth.
A preliminary examination of the vehicle turned up no sign of Smart.</TE>
<TE>   Edmunds, 26, a transient with a criminal record and outstanding
warrants against him, may have been seen by a milk deliveryman near
the Smart family's million-dollar home two days before Elizabeth was
abducted June 5.</TE>

<LD>An apartment building caught fire in Brooklyn, killing seven people
trapped inside, police said. The victims were believed to be from the
same family.</LD>
<LD>   More than 150 firefighters tackled the three-alarm blaze that tore
through all three of the building's floors and caused the roof to
collapse, a police spokeswoman said.</LD>
<LD>   The fire started just after 2:30 p.m. near Fort Hamilton Parkway
and 70th Street in Bay Ridge, fire department spokesman Joseph
Cestari said. When firefighters responded, the fire was already
raging out of control.</LD>
<TE>   The victims were not immediately identified and no cause for the
blaze had been cited.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen firefighters, three police officers, one emergency
services worker and a fire patrol officer sustained minor injuries,

<HD>5 Killed, 4 Badly Hurt in Bus Crash</HD>
<DH>Accident: Charter was headed from Niagara Falls to
Connecticut when it hit a guardrail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>VICTOR, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>A charter bus crashed on a nearby state highway Sunday, killing five
people, police said.</LD>
<LD>   There were 44 people on board the Arrowhead Coach USA bus, which
was traveling from Niagara Falls, N.Y., to Waterbury, Conn., when it
crashed about 3 p.m. EDT Two other vehicles also crashed.</LD>
<LD>   Ambulances and medical helicopters were on the scene on the New
York State Thruway, 16 miles southeast of Rochester; 23 people were
taken to a Rochester hospital.</LD>
<TE>   Four were critically injured but were expected to survive, and an
18-month-old child suffered a blow to the chest but was expected to
recover, State Police Maj. Mark Fischer said.</TE>
<TE>   The driver, who did not appear to be seriously hurt, indicated he
had a diabetic condition, which may have played a part in the
accident, Fischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Several passengers had asked the driver to pull over just before
the crash, Fischer said. It was unclear why they asked the driver to
stop. No charges have been filed in the incident.</TE>
<TE>   The driver missed his exit, then the bus slammed into a guardrail.
The vehicle went airborne and hit another guardrail before rolling
down an embankment, State Trooper Gary Link said.</TE>
<TE>   A minivan caught in the accident overturned and another car was
hit by a guardrail that broke free after the bus slammed into it.
Passengers in those vehicles reported only minor injuries.</TE>
<TE>   By Sunday night, emergency crews were still working to lift the
bus, which was on its side. The five dead were all ejected or
partially ejected from the bus, Fischer said.</TE>
<TE>   WTNH-TV in Connecticut reported that Waterbury Mayor Michael
Jarjura said the bus was chartered for a group from the Church of God
Prophecy there.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Murder Rate Rose 3.1% in 2001, FBI Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The number of murders in the United States rose by 3.1% last year as
police departments nationwide reported an overall increase in major
crimes for the first time in a decade, a law enforcement official
said.</LD>
<LD>   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity about contents of
an annual report being released today by the FBI's Uniform Crime
Reporting Program, said the document will reflect more robberies,
burglaries and car thefts.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, major crimes were up in 2001 by 2% from 2000, the
official said Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   The statistics were reported Sunday by the Washington Post, which
said it had obtained a copy. The newspaper said the latest release
shows crime reports in suburban areas overall were up 2.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Regionally, only the Northeast showed a drop in crime, it said.
The largest increase was in the West, followed by the South and
Midwest, the newspaper said.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI report excluded the more than 3,000 deaths from the Sept.
11 terror attacks. Citing the report, the Post said that if those
deaths had been counted as homicides, the number of murders would
have increased by 26% from 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The reversal of nine years of declining crime numbers is certain
to generate interest in Congress and the law enforcement community.</TE>
<TE>   Criminologists have been warning for some time that surges in the
numbers of teenagers and released prisoners, along with recent
economic declines, threatened a return to rising crime.</TE>
<TE>   The Post said the overall number of violent crimes rose by less
than 1%.</TE>

<HD>Newborn Fawn Rescued From Blaze</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DURANGO, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Crews battling an unpredictable wildfire in southwestern Colorado
came to the rescue of a newborn fawn they found under a burning log.</LD>
<LD>   An Idaho hotshot team found the fawn Friday, and gave the
soot-covered animal to resident Christie Mogel.</LD>
<LD>   Mogel cared for the fawn for a few hours before giving it to the
Nuepe Wildlife Rehabilitation Center, where it will be raised and
eventually returned to the wild.</LD>
<TE>   She believes the newborn's mother fled the fire.</TE>
<TE>   "The unfortunate thing with this fire is that it hit when deer and
elk are having their babies, a week or two before they are capable of
leaving," said Tony Gurzick, the Division of Wildlife's area wildlife
manager.</TE>
<TE>   The fire burned about 62,000 acres and destroyed 45 homes in the
southwestern corner of Colorado. On Sunday, emergency crews ordered
about 100 more homeowners to prepare to evacuate as the fire kicked
up. About 900 homes already had been evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   The fire, which began June 9, was about 25% contained.</TE>

<HD>Hotshot Crews Fight Fires With Fire to Turn Tide</HD>
<DH>Strategy: The elite teams burn out areas of untouched
terrain along a perimeter to slow the spread of a blaze and speed its
containment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAKE GEORGE, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Here under the full moon of a warm Colorado night, it is hard to
remember that the fire whispering along the ground is a killer. It
crackles through the juniper bushes, glows orange in the belly of
fallen logs, fondles the bottom of the trees and presses on without
climbing them.</LD>
<LD>   John Gale picks his way through the luminous forest without need
of a headlamp. "Don't step on the ash piles," he advises, placing his
heavy boot between two burning mounds of brush. "You could step into
a hole without a bottom."</LD>
<LD>   Only a few hours before, nobody would have stepped up and dared
this fire, setting gasoline torches in the unburned brush to nudge it
along. But fires often change their mood at night, they lay down flat
in the brush, and you can nudge them like tranquilized bears.</LD>
<TE>   By dawn Sunday, Gale's hotshot firefighting crew had helped spread
the fire through a large portion of Division W--inside the
southeastern flank of central Colorado's 137,000-acre Hayman blaze.
The burnout operation widened the dead zone within the man-made
perimeter, helping assure that the main fire--if it woke up again in
the morning, if a hot afternoon wind blew it into anger--would not be
a threat here. There would be nothing easy left to burn.</TE>
<TE>   The weekend marked a clear turning point in a blaze that set
records for Colorado Rocky Mountain wildfires. On Saturday,
firefighters were looking at daunting low humidity and rising
winds--the kind of weather capable of unleashing a firestorm on the
woodland communities nearby.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Gale and his Le Grande, Ore., hotshot crew went back
to camp Sunday morning, fire managers were pronouncing the blaze 67%
contained. The weather had not been as bad as expected; thousands of
firefighters working furiously on its flanks had closed a perimeter
around all but the Lost Creek Wilderness on the western edge;
Saturday night crews had managed to burn out a large portion of the
unburned terrain along the perimeter and had begun mopping up
still-smoldering pockets.</TE>
<TE>   "It got hot, the relative humidity went down, the winds came
up--and we held our ground," Rick Floch, an operations chief, told
crew leaders at the 6 a.m. briefing Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of evacuated residents motored back into their
neighborhoods, boxes of clothes and papers dangling out of car trunks
and windows. About 2,200 people--including those from the remote
communities near where the Le Grande hotshots were working--remained
under evacuation.</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell you one thing: I will not leave again," Lana Berry, a
resident of the Tranquil Hills neighborhood, said as she stood in her
driveway Sunday morning for the first time in four days. "They cannot
legally drag me kicking and screaming from my home. When I see the
flames, I'll leave."</TE>
<TE>   Fatigue is growing all over these small towns, nestled in the
heart of wildfire country, 8,500 feet up in the Rockies. More than
115 homes have been destroyed, 2,425 firefighting personnel have been
working--often around the clock--for 16 days, and some residents have
been out of their homes for almost as long.</TE>
<TE>   "Folks are going to be moving back into their homes, and they're
going to be surprised, disappointed and grateful for what they find.
You need to recognize the emotions," incident commander Steve Frye
told crew leaders at the morning briefing.</TE>
<TE>   "The landscape, the view-shed are not any longer what they moved
to this area for. And it's really important for us to help them make
the transition over the next few days.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to run into people doing things you won't believe,
in places you can't imagine," Frye added. "This is not a time to be
cavalier."</TE>
<TE>   As the blaze begins to wind down, probably no one is more tired
than the crews, like Gale's, who are the national interagency fire
system's elite, best-trained troops.</TE>
<TE>   The Le Grande crew--14 men and six women--started the fire season
May 20 with two weeks of annual training and were dispatched the day
they completed it to a series of lightning fires that had
consolidated into a single major blaze in Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   They fought that fire for nine days, came home to Le Grande for a
day, then were dispatched to Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   For much of this week they have been working night shifts, hacking
a line around the blaze with their shovels, helping occasionally to
protect homes from advancing fire. On Saturday, they began work at 6
p.m., got off at 5 a.m. Sunday, slept and then headed back up to the
fire line at 2 p.m. Day shifts usually run 16 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Fatigue turned to anxiety on Tuesday, when a fire they had been
flanking for hours suddenly changed direction and advanced toward
them, cutting them off from their trucks and forcing them to retreat
into a cleared-out safety zone. With no way out, they had to sleep in
the safety zone, an area previously blackened by the blaze, while the
fire raged on its edges.</TE>
<TE>   "That evening when we got chased into the black, that was an
eye-opener for a lot of these kids," said Gale, 41. "They hadn't seen
fire behave like that."</TE>
<TE>   Being a hotshot is largely a young person's game--the sheer
physical demands of hiking and laboring through burning, mountainous
forest usually are too much for older men and women, as is being away
from home five months a year.</TE>
<TE>   For them, the lure is powerful. "Protecting natural resources,"
said Amy Willet, 24, of Enterprise, Ore. "Seeing parts of the country
some people will never, ever see. Places they'll never, ever go."</TE>
<TE>   "It kind of goes back to my childhood: competitive soccer player,
high school sports. It's just that fast pace, that competitiveness,"
added Aaron Olmos, 28, of Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   Working day shifts this week has been the Entiat hotshot team, one
of the U.S. Forest Service's best known.</TE>
<TE>   Based in the small town of Entiat near Wenatchee, Wash., the crew
has been sent to many of the nation's biggest wildfires in recent
years--including Washington state's Thirty Mile fire last year that
killed four firefighters from another crew the morning after the
Entiat hotshots left the front line.</TE>
<TE>   "We were in Alaska two weeks before this," said 25-year-old
Kristian Mattson, who is in his second year with the Entiat crew. The
moment they arrived at the Hayman blaze, they rushed out to defend
the fire camp from flames pushing down the nearby ridge.</TE>
<TE>   "We went to dig some lines and we got pushed out. The fire was
kind of too dry, too hazardous," said Mike Jensen, 22, who is in his
rookie year.</TE>
<TE>   "We were pushed around for about three days," added Korry Mattson,
22, Kristian's brother. "We'd make a line and we'd watch the fire for
a few days and then we'd try again and have to pull out and watch the
fire."</TE>
<TE>   All day Saturday, the Entiat crew worked the unburned area around
the southeast perimeter, doing just what the Le Grande crew was
working on that night: Taking 1.5-gallon cans of diesel and gasoline
and throwing it on unburned brush to create a fuel-free zone between
the fire and the outer perimeter, a line of dirt dug in by a
bulldozer.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be dangerous in the afternoon, but once it hits 5 or 6 [in
the evening], the fire lays down a little bit," Jensen said.</TE>
<TE>   That's when the Le Grande hotshots move in. As night descends on
the forest, the darkness becomes impenetrable. There is a low,
throaty whoosh sound in the distance, the sound of a large tree
torching into flame. To the south, another crew's chain saw cuts down
the burned snag of a tree. Gale's radio chatters quietly, pointing
out breaks in the burnout, inviting crews who haven't dined--it is 10
p.m.--to call for a sack lunch.</TE>
<TE>   The Le Grande crew fans out into the darkness and begins setting
small fires, a juniper bush here, a patch of dry grass there, until
the forest floor is dotted with lazy, slow-moving tongues of flame.</TE>
<TE>   It is an act that seems insane in these hot, dry wild lands, where
a single spark from a campfire or a lightning bolt can set thousands
of acres ablaze. It is "experience and practice," assistant crew
leader Willy Crippen says, that allows them to do it--to know where
the fire will go once it's lighted. To know the fire's not in a mood
to ravage. To believe they can stop it.</TE>

<HD>Storm Clouds Follow Governor in Big Sky Country</HD>
<DH>Politics: Judy Martz's message resonates with conservative
Montanans, but missteps have hurt her in opinion polls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GLASGOW, Mont.</DL>
<LD>At a convention of home-schooling parents earlier this month, Gov.
Judy Martz praised families who were able to teach their children
outside the public school system for as little as $300 a year. "It
shouldn't take $5,000 to $7,000 to educate a student in public
schools, and it surely doesn't take a village to raise one," she
said.</LD>
<LD>   In a state that is closing rural schools and fighting to maintain
education dollars, the governor's implication that the public system
spends too much money lighted a fuse of resentment--even here in
Glasgow, a farm town on the eastern prairies where a Republican
governor normally is treated like family. School Supt. Glen Monson
rose during the Kiwanis Club luncheon to point out that the town
already had had to close a school and retire its three most
experienced teachers because it couldn't afford them.</LD>
<LD>   Martz, a former Miss Rodeo Montana and Olympic speedskater who
spent years running a garbage collection business before jumping into
politics, likely will assume her first national role this week when
she takes over chairmanship of the Western Governors Assn. Her
expected election at the meeting of 21 state leaders in Phoenix comes
at a time of controversy over her own governorship, sparked by a
series of political mishaps that have sent her approval ratings as
low as 37%.</LD>
<TE>   Democrats believe her problems could give them their first shot at
the Montana governorship in years, and could even tip the balance in
the state Legislature this year. Republicans, who convened their
annual state convention this weekend, say the numbers are in their
favor; but already they privately are evaluating the chances of
convincing Martz to avert trouble by not running again in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Montana's first female governor is highly popular in the business
community for her commitment to creating higher-wage jobs. Her strong
professions of faith and advocacy of teaching religious values to
children also have earned Martz applause from many conservative
Montanans.</TE>
<TE>   But major newspapers in the last few months have begun ridiculing
Martz, with the Missoulian implying in a tongue-in-cheek editorial
that she is "the kind of governor most of you would be if you woke up
one November morning and discovered you'd been elected."</TE>
<TE>   Front pages all over Montana last week devoted substantial space
to a state ethics hearing into Martz's purchase of land near her home
from Atlantic Richfield Co., which is involved in a
multimillion-dollar Superfund cleanup lawsuit with the state.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Martz's former director of communications, Mary Jo Fox,
wrote a column expressing a degree of relief that she had been fired.
"Should one thrown off the Titanic be resentful or grateful?" wrote
Fox, asserting that "Gov. Judy Martz has a cheerful way of redefining
denial and inaction as leadership."</TE>
<TE>   Republican leaders say Martz speaks forthrightly about issues that
Montanans care deeply about but is penalized for her frankness.
"People always say they want a politician to speak her mind. She does
that. The fact is she's an honest woman, and she's going to get in
trouble for speaking her mind," said Mike Kiedrowski, executive
director of the state Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Martz's personal charm is considerable; even her opponents
give her high marks for her energy, hard work and commitment to
building a stronger economic base in a state that ranks 46th in
personal income.</TE>
<TE>   But the home-schooling speech drew ire--especially because it had
religious overtones and seemed to imply that children should be
taught Christian values.</TE>
<TE>   Those at the meeting said the governor launched into an ardent,
almost tearful, affirmation of her faith and asserted that children
tutored at home learn "the most important lessons ... the reasons
why" they should abstain from drugs and sex. "We have a right to talk
about Jesus Christ as our personal savior, and tell our children
about him too," she declared.</TE>
<TE>   "She was effectively implying that public schools aren't
religious. Well, maybe they aren't, and maybe they shouldn't be,
because our Constitution says we accept all faiths in this country,"
said Eric Feaver, head of the Montana Education Assn. Feaver and
other liberal advocates say they have been marginalized by the
administration.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very difficult to talk about public schools with this
governor, because she keeps saying our economy's bad and we can't pay
teachers better and the only way to make our economy better is to cut
income taxes and maybe I don't want to talk to you anyway because
you're not as Christian as I'd like you to be," Feaver added.</TE>
<TE>   "The result is that I last met with the governor in an official
capacity in January of 2001.... Never in my history as a lobbyist
have I been so isolated. And I don't think I'm alone. It's just that
those of us who are on a course that's different from the governor's
are simply not on the governor's radar screen. We're an annoyance."</TE>
<TE>   Yet in other quarters of the state, the home-schooling remarks
were celebrated. Some of those who were there that night wept during
her remarks. Others looked at it practically. "Since when is telling
the truth looked at as harmful and divisive? Our public school system
is failing at every level and has been going downhill for many
years," said Gary Barnett, a Missoula resident.</TE>
<TE>   Martz, 53, stepped full time into politics in 1990, taking a job
as field representative for Republican Sen. Conrad R. Burns. In 1995,
when popular GOP Gov. Mark Racicot needed a new running mate, she
called him and asked for the job. She ran for the governorship
herself against former state Auditor Mark O'Keefe in 2000, winning
51% of the vote despite the $2.2 million of his own money O'Keefe
poured into the election.</TE>
<TE>   Her troubles as governor started even before she took office, with
a December 2000 meeting of the Montana Taxpayers Assn., when she
announced she was happy to say she was "a lapdog of industry." (Martz
says she doesn't recall making the statement, but state newspapers
reported it, and it was confirmed to The Times by at least one
witness.)</TE>
<TE>   She later drew criticism from women's groups and others when she
jokingly remarked that her husband never beat her, adding: "But then,
I never gave him a reason to."</TE>
<TE>   Another controversy erupted in August 2001 when Martz's chief of
staff, Shane Hedges, was involved in a car accident that killed the
state House majority leader. Authorities said Hedges, who was
driving, was legally drunk. But when authorities went to the
governor's mansion to examine as evidence the clothes Hedges was
wearing that night, Martz admitted she had washed them after taking
Hedges home with her.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't have, but the mother in
me did it," Martz told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The state Justice Department also is investigating the reported
use of staff time and state telephones to organize a fund-raiser in
Palm Springs for the Montana Majority Fund--a GOP-linked, tax-exempt
political fund. Martz served as honorary chairwoman for the campaign,
which raised tens of thousands of dollars from business sources
inside and outside Montana. State law prohibits corporate
contributions to candidates or parties.</TE>
<TE>   Martz--who was unavailable for an interview--has tended to blame a
scandal-happy press for most of the controversy surrounding her,
saying that most Montanans are "sick" of reading about it.</TE>
<TE>   As chairwoman of the Western Governors Assn., she says she will
seek to bring new emphasis to work force development and education,
tourism and economic development in the West. "Tourism, trade and
homeland security all rely on a strong, integrated underlying
physical infrastructure, including secure and efficient
communications and transportation systems," she said in a statement
prepared for the conference.</TE>
<TE>   In Montana, Martz is preparing to implement $30.9 million in
budget reductions that will slash into nearly every department to
help fill a projected deficit. Because they make up so large a part
of the budget, state health and social services will take the biggest
hit--up to 41% of the cuts--with highly controversial reductions in
Medicaid, domestic violence prevention, foster care and children's
health insurance. The Legislature has signed off on the cuts in
principle, but several members are calling for a special session to
look at the matter in detail.</TE>
<TE>   As Martz sees it, the way out is economic growth. She is looking
ahead to tax proposals designed to kick-start the economy, which has
escaped most of the worst of the recession (unemployment is only
4.5%) but is badly in need of high-paying jobs.</TE>
<TE>   In Glasgow, a town of 3,250 about 275 miles northeast of Great
Falls, she powered her way up and down the business district,
commiserating with shop owners on the difficulties of running a
business, admiring some hand-made beadwork ("I could make that!" she
declared) and touring the phone company, which has brought cellular
phone service and high-speed Internet access all over the sparsely
populated region.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the Kiwanis Club, a work shirt-and-jeans affair, Martz
told community leaders a 10% income tax reduction would put $66
million a year back into taxpayers' hands, money that would allow
people to keep their communities growing and vital. Local option and
tourist taxes could help generate new revenue for government, she
said. But some of the men and women present seemed skeptical,
especially of the so-called tourist tax.</TE>
<TE>   "That's basically a sales tax," said one man in the front of the
room.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, that's basically a sales tax," Martz replied evenly.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a tax on everybody in this room," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a tax on everybody in this room. And if you want to stay
46th in per capita income, we won't talk about a sales tax. I have
people when I go home who say to me, 'Oh, I'm so proud we don't have
a sales tax!' Well, we're going to die proud and broke."</TE>
<TE>   The audience looked around and didn't seem to have much to say in
reply as they pushed the Jell-O salad around on their plates. Even
Tom Stathos, the pharmacist who a minute earlier had taken the
government to task for the proposed Medicaid cuts, was of two minds
about the governor.</TE>
<TE>   The Medicaid cuts will likely force Stathos to sell 40% or more of
his drugs at cost. But it's not as if anyone else knows what to do,
Stathos said.</TE>
<TE>   "Like she said, she inherited a lot of problems," he said. "She's
got a very difficult job."</TE>

<HD>Ailing School Systems Prescribed an Injection of Leadership</HD>

<LD>John Lindsay, the mayor of New York City in the late 1960s, used to
say that he had the second toughest job in America (after,
presumably, the president). Today the toughest job outside of the
Oval Office might be superintendent of a big-city school system.
Caught between a public demanding change and a school system built to
resist it, the average big-city superintendent now holds the job for
only 2 1/2 years. Even baseball managers last longer.</LD>
<LD>   Which makes it all the more admirable, if not remarkable, that two
dozen accomplished men and women were cracking the books in an
overcrowded, under-cooled conference room at a Washington hotel on a
recent morning at what amounts to a boot camp for prospective urban
superintendents. Gathered in the room was the first class of recruits
in a new program meant to train mid-career professionals--especially
those from outside the educational establishment--to direct big-city
school systems.</LD>
<TE>   The program, funded by billionaire Los Angeles developer and
financial services magnate Eli Broad, acknowledges all the hurdles
facing urban schools; indeed, participants say one of the things they
have learned most clearly is the astonishing assortment of ways a
superintendent can fail. But both the sponsors and the participants
are operating on the stubborn, or naive, belief that dedicated
individuals, with the right skills, can make schools work on even the
meanest streets.</TE>
<TE>   They also are powered by the conviction that lessons learned
outside the classrooms can help the schools. Although several in the
first class have some experience in education, many have spent most
of their working lives elsewhere. The group includes a retired Army
colonel now running a small rural school district in Kentucky, a
former vice president at AT&amp;T and a former publisher of the Los
Angeles Times. Arnold "Woody" Carter, the retired colonel (who served
as a battalion commander during the Gulf War) speaks for all of them
when he insists: "Leadership is leadership.... The skills translate
very quickly."</TE>
<TE>   That argument has found an increasingly receptive audience in
recent years among big-city leaders searching for new answers to old
educational problems. Over the last decade, a steady stream of big
cities has turned to outsiders as superintendents.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Romer, the superintendent in Los Angeles, is a former governor
of Colorado. Paul Vallas, who led a turnaround of Chicago's schools
in the late 1990s, was the city's budget director; his successor,
Arne Duncan, mostly ran a small nonprofit organization. Seattle
drafted a retired Army major general, John Stanford. In New York,
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who recently won operating control over
the schools from the state Legislature, says he's looking for a
CEO-type with "good management skills" to replace another
nontraditional educator, former corporate attorney Harold Levy, as
the city's schools chancellor. In a widely admired model, former U.S.
Atty. Alan Bersin, as superintendent, and veteran educator Anthony
Alvarado, as his chancellor for instruction, have teamed to advance
an aggressive reform agenda in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of the outsider superintendents have been successful; the
chaotic Washington, D.C., schools utterly frustrated another retired
Army general (Julius Becton) recruited to whip them into shape. But
on balance, the outsiders have done well: Some of them, such as
Vallas, might qualify among the most successful superintendents in
recent years. Although the outsiders lack the classroom experience of
the traditional superintendent--who might have slowly climbed from
teacher to principal to administrator--they are also less tied into
the dense web of understandings and accommodations that make it so
difficult to change any large organization. They are stronger often
because they don't know why things can't be done.</TE>
<TE>   Yet that inexperience can also make them vulnerable to mistakes.
The Broad Foundation program tries to deepen their knowledge without
dulling their ardor. Over six weekend sessions through the year, it
exposes the recruits to leading educational consultants and big-city
superintendents and offers practical advice on subjects from managing
relations with a school board and the press to handling a job
interview. On-site visits and at-home reading complete the
curriculum. While relentlessly practical, the program also has an
evangelical zeal: the participants carry an invigorating sense of
mission. "This entire group is composed of individuals who
understand, and increasingly understand, how hard it is, but really
want to do it," says Kathryn Downing, the former Times publisher.
"It's a very committed group."</TE>
<TE>   It's important to remember that almost all the superintendents
staggering away bloodied after 24 or 36 months in big-city school
jobs once rode in with that exhilarating sense of possibility too.
Kati Haycock, a leading advocate for low-income students, notes it's
dangerous to invest too much hope in any individual to transform a
big-city school district when the system imposes so many
constraints--from union contracts to meddling school boards.</TE>
<TE>   But through this program, Broad has recognized a fundamental fact:
If improving the schools are a national priority, the nation needs to
systematically funnel more of its most talented people toward the
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the program placed its first new
superintendent: Paula Dawning, a recently retired AT&amp;T vice
president, beat out a veteran educator for the superintendent's job
in Benton Harbor, Mich. The problems there are immense: one-third of
the students don't finish high school. The Broad program hasn't armed
Dawning with a sure-fire answer for reversing that trend. But it is
infusing her, and her classmates, with an obvious determination to
find solutions. In the months ahead, it's likely that some very
troubled school systems will find a spark of hope in the heat of that
passion.</TE>

<LD>   Question: Why do high-voltage electric power lines hum?</LD>
<TE>   Answer: The hum is caused by the interaction of the
alternating-current electric field carried by the wires and water on
their surface, although researchers are not sure of the precise
mechanism. It could be vibrations of the water surface, spitting from
the tips of water droplets, or rapid expansion of air at the tips of
the droplets caused by heating. Older power lines produce less noise
than newer ones, probably because water is less likely to form into
droplets on their surface. The intensity of the noise increases in a
heavy rainstorm.</TE>

<LD>Women suffering from breast cancer soon may have a wider choice of
therapies. Until now, tamoxifen has been the standard treatment for
older women with hormone-sensitive tumors. But early results of a new
study, reported in Saturday's issue of Lancet, showed that
anastrozole is as good, or better, than tamoxifen for post-menopausal
women, and has fewer side effects.</LD>
<LD>   Anastrozole is produced by pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca
under the brand name Arimidex.</LD>
<LD>   Anastrozole works by inhibiting production of the female hormone
estrogen in women who have passed menopause. Estrogen is linked to
the development of cancer. The trial, involving more than 9,000
women, compared the two drugs alone and in combination. It showed
that women taking anastrozole were 60% less likely to develop a tumor
in the other breast.</LD>

<LD>When comets born at the edge of our solar system disappear from view,
they don't just lose their tails and go dormant; 99% of them crumble
to bits, U.S. researchers reported in Friday's issue of Science.
"These objects are simply not where we expect them to be," said
Harold Levison, of the Southwest Research Institute, in a statement.
"The only explanation that I can think of is that they go 'poof.' "</LD>
<LD>   The mystery of the missing comets has been debated for decades.
Some astronomers theorized that most of those that issued from a
cloud of comets known as the Oort cloud, at the edge of the solar
system, eventually stopped producing their highly visible tails and
went dormant, making them harder to detect.</LD>

<LD>In a discovery that could greatly reduce the size and cost of
computer chips, Princeton University researchers have found a fast
method for printing ultra-small patterns on silicon wafers.
Electrical engineer Stephen Chou and his colleagues reported in
Thursday's issue of Nature that they could make patterns with
features measuring only 10 nanometers--10 millionths of a millimeter.</LD>
<LD>   The method involves pressing a mold against a piece of silicon and
applying a laser pulse for just 20 billionths of a second. In
contrast, the current technique of etching requires 10 to 20 minutes
to make a single chip.</LD>

<HD>Think of Energy as Nature's Best Recycling Effort</HD>

<LD>If there was ever a pro at poking fun at the know-it-all pretensions
of some physicists, it was Caltech's own late Richard Feynman. And
more often than not, his ribbing struck some deep shard of truth.</LD>
<LD>   Take his turn on that familiar everyday phenomenon: energy. We buy
it, we save it, we waste it; we wolf it down in the form of jelly
doughnuts, then desperately try to work it off at the gym; we soak it
into our skin as sunlight and scream as it carries the roller coaster
over the edge; it stirs breezes and powers stars; it's the quiet
potential sitting in a tank of gas and the foamy violence of an ocean
wave; it's coiled into springs and frozen into matter. If there is
any justice in the world, some Enron executives will go to jail over
it.</LD>
<LD>   And yet, as Feynman pointed out, "It is important to realize that
in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is."</LD>
<TE>   It's even worse than that: We don't even have a sensible way to
name it or measure it. "Physicists sometimes feel so superior and
smart that other people would like to catch them out once on
something," Feynman said. "For those who want proof that physicists
are human, the proof is the idiocy of all the different units which
they use for measuring energy."</TE>
<TE>   There are calories and joules and ergs and electron volts and BTUs
and kilowatt-hours, to name a few--all measuring this nameless thing.</TE>
<TE>   But here's the absolutely amazing thing about energy: The amount
of it in the universe is absolutely constant. It never changes. It
only alters its form.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the energy you used to get up this morning, open the
paper and read this column. It came, of course, from that steak you
ate last night. The steak got its energy in turn from the cow, which
got it from the grass, which got it from the sun.</TE>
<TE>   And that minor earthquake last week. The energy for that bubbled
up from deep inside the Earth where radioactive atoms melt rock,
moving continents around. Those atoms in turn got crammed with energy
during the gravitational collapse of some long-gone star, later to be
spewed into space, eventually condensing into the glob we now call
Earth. The gravitational energy that crushed the star, in turn, can
be traced back to the big bang, the explosive expansion of the
universe.</TE>
<TE>   It's an endless regression of recycling.</TE>
<TE>   And it doesn't stop there.</TE>
<TE>   The universe got the energy to bang, in turn, from the energy of
the vacuum of empty space, which, oddly enough, is also packed with
energy. This energy of emptiness comes from the perpetual quivering
inherent in everything, thanks to the innate properties of quantum
mechanics. A large enough quiver, according to some cosmologists,
could have begun the whole shebang.</TE>
<TE>   This sobering thought led MIT cosmologist Alan Guth to his now
infamous conclusion: The universe is the ultimate free lunch.
"Conceivably," Guth said, "everything can be created from nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the "nothing" that we're talking about here is really a
very energetic speck of vacuum. But as far as the universe is
concerned, the energy of a vacuum and the energy of a Mars candy bar
are substantially the same. Energy is energy. Whatever that may be.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as we know, there are no real units, no little ball
bearings," Feynman said. "It is abstract, purely mathematical, that
there is a number such that, whenever you calculate it, it does not
change. I cannot interpret it any better than that."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if the amount of energy in the universe never changes,
you might well wonder how can there be such a thing as an energy
problem. Why the Middle East? Why Enron? Why world hunger, for that
matter? Why not, to paraphrase the queen: "Let them eat vacuum?"</TE>
<TE>   The reason is that, while we don't ever use up energy, we do use
up useful energy. Before and after the atomic bomb, Hiroshima, Japan,
contained--roughly speaking--the same amounts of energy, but one
would hardly call them equivalent. A tree spends centuries soaking up
the energy of the sun and soil, and releases it all in an hour in a
fire. But the ashes aren't good for much. It can take a thousand
years to turn muscle and thought into cities, eons to pack sunlight
into fossil fuels and millions of years to store energy in stars.
Using energy is often quick and easy, but making it useful is long
and hard.</TE>
<TE>   Conservation of energy is built into nature, as Feynman pointed
out. "But she does not really care; she spends a lot of it in all
directions."</TE>
<TE>   To spend it wisely, now that is up to us.</TE>

<HD>Speech's Utter Dynamics</HD>
<DH>Despite the sameness of U.S. media, regional dialects
refuse to blend. Instead, the continent is a huge quilt of evolving
pronunciation patterns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATTHEW BLAKESLEE</AU>

<LD>Potayto, potattah. Tomayto, tomattah.</LD>
<LD>   Ah, but the issue of dialect is actually much too fascinating to
call the whole thing off, according to linguistic research into North
American dialects.</LD>
<LD>   People commonly assume that regional dialects are steadily
blurring toward some future, homogenized version of the language,
blandly spanning from sea to shining sea. It's just the opposite, as
the research shows. Our continent is a dynamic quilt of evolving
pronunciation patterns that linguists find challenging to explain.</LD>
<TE>   "Language change has not stopped," said William Labov, a
University of Pennsylvania linguistics professor who has studied
dialect transformation since the 1960s. "Despite the fact that we all
listen to the same radio and television and have such great mobility,
regional dialects are actually getting stronger."</TE>
<TE>   Labov leads the Telsur Project, a survey of linguistic changes in
progress in English on our continent. He and his colleagues are
compiling their data into a volume to be published by the end of the
year called the Atlas of North American English. The atlas will be
the most comprehensive treatment of the subject to date.</TE>
<TE>   Work on the atlas already has begun to unveil some surprising
facts about the state of North America's dialects, such as the sharp
boundaries that exist between them. Some linguists have argued that
pronunciation patterns should vary along continuums, the way the
northern prairie gradually becomes the southern desert. Labov has
found that dialects tend to abut sharply, more like cold and warm
weather fronts.</TE>
<TE>   "When you drive from Akron down to Columbus, Ohio," he said,
"you're crossing one of the great American divides [from the Northern
to the Midland dialect], even if you're not aware of it."</TE>
<TE>   What's more, these borders don't have any obvious relation to
geography, commerce or communication and travel patterns, which
leaves their enduring sharpness and growing contrast all the more
puzzling, Labov said. Original settlement patterns account for some
of it, but parts of the picture are still missing.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these findings raise important theoretical questions
about the relationship between the internal, structural forces of
linguistic systems, on the one hand, and the social and cultural
patterns that influence them on the other," said Edward Finegan, a
professor of linguistics and law at USC who is not affiliated with
the Telsur Project.</TE>
<TE>   The basis of the project is a computer-aided analysis of the vowel
pronunciations of hundreds of people sampled from across the
continent. Using computers, they were able to precisely dissect and
catalog the sounds people uttered.</TE>
<TE>   The study looked only at the speech of whites in urbanized areas,
encompassing about two-thirds of the North American population.</TE>
<TE>   Linguists extrapolate language change in time and space by two
means, Labov said. First, they can compare fresh data with regional
dialect surveys from previous decades. Second, they can compare the
pronunciation patterns of old and young speakers from the same areas.</TE>
<TE>   The dialect maps that emerged have many a tale to tell.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern dialect as a whole is becoming more solid than the
North, Labov said, with the two notable exceptions of Atlanta and
Dallas. Both are huge cities that have lost much of their Southern
character because of massive immigration by Northerners.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere--notably St. Louis, Cincinnati and Charleston,
S.C.--many local dialects are getting absorbed.</TE>
<TE>   "Certain medium-size cities are tending to lose their special
vowels in favor of the regional vowel systems," Labov said.</TE>
<TE>   One large-scale set of changes is called a change shift--a set of
pronunciation changes that are systematically connected. "Vowel A
goes to B and B goes to C, sort of like musical chairs," Labov said.</TE>
<TE>   The most famous historical example is the Great Vowel Shift, a
chain shift that swept the English-speaking world beginning in the
15th century. Certain prominent vowels got systematically pronounced
in a "higher" position in the mouth. For instance, "ah" went to "ey,"
"ey" went to "ee," and "ee"--already pronounced in the highest
position--"fell off the top" and became a diphthong (two vowels
smeared together), "ai."</TE>
<TE>   So, in the 1390s Chaucer drank "tey" but by the 1590s Shakespeare
was drinking "tee" (tea), and what Chaucer called "mees" were known
to Shakespeare as "mais" (mice).</TE>
<TE>   The Telsur maps chart a handful of major chain shifts that are
underway: the Northern Cities Shift, the Southern Shift, the Canadian
Shift and the Back Vowel Shift. Each has its own distinctive pattern
of vowel mutations.</TE>
<TE>   Some of them are moving in opposite directions from each
other--direction in the phonological sense. As the South's vowels are
shifting up (and in so doing, recapitulating the original Great Vowel
Shift, Labov said), the North's are shifting down. So while "bet" in
Mississippi and Georgia moves up to become more like "byet," in
Vermont and Maine it shifts down, creeping back into the articulatory
neighborhood of "but."</TE>
<TE>   The atlas also charts the spread of what linguists call
mergers--when two sounds lose their distinction and become the same.
One prominent merger, which originated in the South and is spreading
to other regions, is pushing "pin" and "pen" into identical
pronunciation.</TE>
<TE>   Penelope Eckert, a professor of linguistics at Stanford
University, said the abiding diversity and increasing contrast of
regional dialects are not too surprising.</TE>
<TE>   "Spoken language is something that people use on a day-to-day
basis in face-to-face interaction," said Eckert, who studies the
social psychology of dialect and dialect change.</TE>
<TE>   Whether speakers are cliques in high school or upper-middle-class
cosmopolites, she said, people invest a fair amount of their social
and class identities in their local dialects.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way you would expect dialect to 'even out' would be if
everyone were trying to construct some kind of common, de-localized
identity," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is the observed sharpness of dialect boundaries inexplicable,
considering that each dialect is an internally consistent system that
follows its own set of rules, Eckert said.</TE>
<TE>   When two dialects bump into each other on the map, she said, "they
set up mutual incompatibilities. You can't just import any old change
into any old dialect. A vowel system that's moving in a certain
direction is not going to glom onto a whole different set of
changes," even if those changes are the norm only a town away.</TE>
<TE>   The vowel shifts at play in all this generally are quite subtle.
For the most part they are as unconscious and ineffable to speakers
as are the sequences of muscle contractions they perform when
reaching for a doorknob, though they are no less systematic.</TE>
<TE>   "People are cognizant of some of these pronunciation aspects of
dialect," USC's Finegan said. "But I think people weren't aware of
most of these patterns of shifting that the Telsur Project has
uncovered."</TE>
<TE>   Labov said he and his colleagues are working hard to put the Web
version of their atlas into as layman-friendly language as possible.
Visitors will be able to see, manipulate and hear the sounds, which
is the best way to understand what these vowel shifts are all about,
he added.</TE>
<TE>   Electronic footnotes will delve into technical treatments of the
data so that the site will be useful to linguists as well as to
people who are just curious about the speech patterns of their home
cities.</TE>
<TE>   The improved Web version should be out by the end of the year,
Labov said. It's at www.ling.upenn.edu/phonoatlas/home.html.</TE>

<HD>Wild Horses Drag Bidders to the Valley</HD>
<DH>Animals: At a Pierce College auction, the BLM finds homes
for about 65 mustangs and burros that were rounded up on federal
lands.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Since Michael Cantilla was a boy, a buckskin steed has been galloping
through his imagination. He dreamed about catching the mustang and
taming it for riding.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, Cantilla, now 34, circled the corral at Pierce College
in Woodland Hills, looking for the animal of his dreams among the
wild horses and burros that the U.S. Bureau of Land Management had
put up for adoption. A registered nurse, Cantilla recently bought 2
1/2 acres in Palmdale for his wife, newborn son and, he hoped, that
mustang.</LD>
<LD>   The bureau brought 80 mustangs and 30 burros to the San Fernando
Valley for the weekend, all of them rounded up from herds on federal
land in Northern California and the high deserts of Nevada.</LD>
<TE>   At an auction Saturday, bidding topped out at $375. On Sunday,
every remaining mustang and jenny, or female donkey, was offered for
$125. Jacks--the male burros--went for $25. Homes were found for
about 65 of the animals, bureau spokesman Doran Sanchez said.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Moore II of Carson bought a 4-year-old gelded horse that
he'll call Las Vegas. Moore plans to train the mustang for
calf-roping and penning, and use it in a therapeutic riding program
for children in Compton. Among the program's chestnut mounts, the
black horse will stand out, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw that one and I liked the color. I liked the way he stood,
and I liked his head. I like horses with long heads," Moore said,
looking over his purchase.</TE>
<TE>   A once-over from behind a fence is about all a prospective adopter
had to go on. The untrained animals had never had anyone on their
backs, and most didn't seem particularly interested in discovering
what that's like.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take some time" to train Las Vegas for a saddle and
bridle, Moore said. "It's not something that happens overnight."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the bureau's Sanchez pointed out, the wild
animals "don't have any bad habits .... You're starting with an empty
vessel, and it will know only what you teach it."</TE>
<TE>   More than 185,000 animals have been placed in homes since the
BLM's Adopt-A-Horse or Burro Program began in 1973. The program's
slogan invites people to "Adopt a Living Legend," because the horses
are descendants of mustangs that arrived in the 15th century when
Spanish explorers reintroduced the horse to North America.</TE>
<TE>   "This is part of history," Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau estimates that 45,000 wild horses and donkeys roam the
Western states. Periodically, the bureau thins overpopulated
rangeland by rounding up the animals for adoption. Drought and recent
wildfires have destroyed large portions of the animals' habitats,
sending an additional 6,000 to 7,000 into the adoption program.</TE>
<TE>   The transfer is called an "adoption" because the animals don't
become the property of their buyers until after a yearlong tryout.
The bureau doesn't want to send animals home with anyone who lacks
the space, time and money to care for a large animal.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Cantilla left the corral Sunday without his dream horse.
But the BLM has a bigger selection at its year-round adoption center
in Ridgecrest, not too far from his Palmdale home. There, he figures,
the perfect horse might lope over.</TE>
<TE>   "I want a horse to come up to me," he said.</TE>

<HD>Ahmanson Ranch May Face Costly Limits on Grading</HD>
<DH>Housing: State water board recommends a ban during the
rainy season to protect creeks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State water quality officials have issued a recommendation that would
prohibit the developer of the Ahmanson Ranch housing project from
grading dirt at the site during the rainy season.</LD>
<LD>   If approved, the recommendation by the California Regional Water
Quality Control Board would ban grading from Oct. 1 through April
15--a requirement that some experts anticipate could increase
construction costs by millions.</LD>
<LD>   Washington Mutual Bank wants to build a 3,050-home subdivision on
the eastern edge of Ventura County north of Calabasas. Project foes
want the company to sell the acreage for parkland.</LD>
<TE>   "This decision provides just one more reason why Washington Mutual
should not go forward. There are already issues about traffic, air
and water quality, and now financial viability," said Tsilah Burman,
executive director of Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Citing real estate industry experts, Burman said that a ban on
earth-moving for six months each year could hike development costs by
one-third or more.</TE>
<TE>   Although exact dollar figures were unavailable, Burman said the
developer plans to move 45 million cubic yards of dirt at the site
over the course of 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of operating one dirt-moving machine can top $100 an
hour, she said.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the water board's recommendation last week, a
spokesman for the developer said the project has weathered a decade
of hurdles--including litigation and the discoveries of a rare flower
and an endangered frog--and would also survive this.</TE>
<TE>   "We will certainly address any challenge related to erosion and
sedimentation in cooperation with the regional board and other
agencies, and we are very confident we will be able to do this
successfully," said Tim McGarry of Washington Mutual.</TE>
<TE>   McGarry said company officials will review the water board's
recommendation before deciding on the next course of action. He
described comments about increased construction costs as "silly."</TE>
<TE>   According to the recommendation, state water officials believe
rain at the project site would turn piles of graded dirt into mud,
which could slide down hillsides and damage two nearby creeks with
excessive silt.</TE>
<TE>   The recommendation was submitted to Ventura County planning
officials, who are preparing a supplemental environmental report.</TE>

<HD>Growth Demands Are Shaking a Sleepy San Clemente Awake</HD>
<DH>Development: Projects real and proposed pinch a surfer's
paradise that was once Nixon's retreat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every chance he gets, Drew Brophy surfs some of the world's most
celebrated breaks off San Clemente's coast, catching the same waves
that once washed over the black wingtips Richard Nixon wore strolling
along the beach during his exile at the Western White House.</LD>
<LD>   Along the secluded shoreline, Brophy feels as far removed from the
bustle of life as Nixon did escaping here from Washington after the
Watergate scandal.</LD>
<LD>   At the southern tip of Orange County, in the shadow of the San
Onofre nuclear power plant, San Clemente has long been a reminder of
what California coastal towns used to be, with uncrowded beaches and
an old-fashioned downtown free of the big-box retailers that dot the
rest of suburbia.</LD>
<TE>   But time is finally catching up with San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   Up in the backcountry, huge housing developments are rising.
Transportation officials want to carve a toll road through the city's
eastern end and build a second set of railroad tracks along the
coast. And at San Onofre, the federal government wants the facility
to hold buried radioactive waste, further unnerving residents who
learned last week they would receive special pills in case terrorism
or some other disaster causes a radiation leak.</TE>
<TE>   Around downtown, the small bungalows that until a few years ago
were considered among the last beach-side bargains in Southern
California are being torn down at a rapid rate and replaced with
grander homes.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic is worse than ever, many longtime residents say, and they
fear driving will only get worse over the next two decades, when San
Clemente's population is expected to climb 30%.</TE>
<TE>   Brophy, 31, doesn't like it one bit. An artist by trade, he moved
to San Clemente in 1993, in search of the place he lost when his
hometown of Myrtle Beach, S.C., "went from a sweet little beach town
to a Las Vegas strip."</TE>
<TE>   Now, as he scans his adopted home, "it seems like every week
there's something new. It's endless.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of scary to think this little treasure isn't going to
last. This is one of the last places in California where it's still
the way it's always been," Brophy said.</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente sprouted up on the former Ranchos los Desechos
("Leftover Land"), which was abandoned because it was too steep and
overgrown to graze cattle or sheep.</TE>
<TE>   Ole Hanson, a land speculator and the city's father, vowed to
create a "Spanish village" when he pitched a white canopy tent along
Old Coast Highway in 1927 and sold the first plots.</TE>
<TE>   "I vision a place where people can live together more pleasantly
than any other place in America," Hanson wrote to a friend. "This
will be a place where a man can breathe!"</TE>
<TE>   Hanson's white stucco homes now blend with the beach bungalows,
townhomes and apartments that are tucked along narrow streets and
alleys. Many of the seaside neighborhoods are within walking distance
of Avenida del Mar, the main road leading to the pier.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Local Gems</TE>
<TE>   San Onofre State Beach is one of the city's most treasured gems.
Steep sandstone bluffs stretch for miles. Picnickers grill hot dogs
under thatched-roof huts. Anglers cast their lines from rocky shores.
Out in the distance, surfers ride breaks such as Cotton's Point,
Churches and Trestles.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon, often wearing suit and tie, walked these same sandy shores
when he wasn't entertaining foreign dignitaries, signing landmark
accords or dodging demonstrators at Casa Pacifica ("House of Peace"),
the bluff-top estate that became his retreat from 1969 to 1980.</TE>
<TE>   For all the unwanted publicity he brought to San Clemente during
his presidency and the self-imposed exile that followed his
resignation, one of his other legacies was converting Camp
Pendleton's beaches into a state park and preserving them as a
surfing haven.</TE>
<TE>   Even as development exploded in south Orange County in the 1970s
and 1980s, San Clemente remained an island of relative calm.
Initially, it was less desirable for development because of its
distance from large job centers. The city was further isolated
because only two major highways ran through it, Interstate 5 and the
Coast Highway.</TE>
<TE>   Residents liked it that way. Voters passed a slow-growth measure
in 1988 that permitted only 500 new homes a year until 2006.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Then Came Toll Road</TE>
<TE>   But over the past decade, urban sprawl has reached San Clemente's
doorstep. In the mid-1990s, the San Joaquin Hills toll road opened to
the north, providing more access to San Clemente. Office towers and
business parks sprouted up in Irvine and Costa Mesa, creating jobs
closer to town.</TE>
<TE>   "When the [tollway] opened up, it became an entirely new picture,"
said John Martin of Martin &amp; Associates, an urban planning firm in
Newport Beach. "It was a huge transformation in commuting patterns."</TE>
<TE>   Several upscale housing developments that are in the works on the
northeastern edge of the city will add more than 5,000 homes. Such
growth is permitted because some of the developments lie just outside
city limits, in county territory.</TE>
<TE>   A little to the north, Rancho Mission Viejo wants to build 14,000
homes and more than 5 million square feet of office and retail space
in one of the largest swaths of open space remaining in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   Through this same open space, the Transportation Corridor Agencies
propose an extension of the Foothill South toll road that would wind
16 miles through those same 23,000 acres of wilderness and eventually
connect to the Santa Ana Freeway near San Onofre State Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Many residents fear the massive new projects will kill what is
unique about the town.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Netherby, a former editor at Field &amp; Stream magazine,
discovered San Clemente in 1973 when his Chevy Camaro broke down
there on the freeway. The first door he knocked on for help happened
to be the home of a real estate agent who soon showed him the home he
has lived in ever since. It is now worth 10 times the $49,950 he paid
for it.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to run and hike in the backcountry and would rarely see
another footprint," he said. "And now all the developers and builders
are dueling over this great space with wonderful natural resources
that has kind of been overlooked for a long time. And those of us who
live here want to preserve what we have."</TE>
<TE>   The new development is not without supporters. The slow-growth
policies of the 1980s are blamed for chronic financial shortfalls at
City Hall, which have led to cuts in city services. Those backers say
the growth will provide the city with badly needed revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The city is more united on the issue of double-tracking the rails
along the beach. Amtrak hopes to add a second track as part of a
20-year program to expand service, increase capacity and reduce the
time of train trips. The tracks would run right along the beach, in
front of San Clemente's landmark pier.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is, the beach is narrow enough right now as it is,"
said Gavin Herbert, who now inhabits Nixon's villa. He points down
toward the tracks that once brought Franklin D. Roosevelt to town to
play poker with Ham Cotton, the original owner of the estate.</TE>
<TE>   Herbert has started a foundation that has raised $40,000 to fund a
public relations campaign against the plan, one of an assortment of
efforts under way on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilwoman Stephanie Dorey, who ran on a quality-of-life
platform in 2000 and regularly holds grass-roots meetings in her
living room, hints that she will lie on the tracks if she has to.</TE>
<TE>   All over town, lawn signs trumpet the slogan "Derail the Rail."</TE>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, residents have also been
taking a second look at their imposing neighbor to the south: the San
Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. They have been pushing for
tightened security at the plant as well as distribution of potassium
iodide tablets to help prevent thyroid cancer after a radiation leak.
The state last week agreed to distribute pills to residents living
within 10 miles of San Onofre.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government now wants to house a long-term repository
for spent nuclear fuel, which would be stored in dry casks.</TE>
<TE>   Residents fear that the casks would be damaged in a powerful
earthquake and could make San Onofre an even more attractive target
for terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   All the worries over nuclear storage, train tracks and growth
frustrate old-timers, but they try to keep it in perspective.</TE>
<TE>   In the courtyard of Hotel San Clemente, a group of retirees shares
coffee and stories, something it has been doing every day except
Thursdays for 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   Dorothy Fuller, who lives on the third floor and is one of San
Clemente's earliest residents, shows up with the photographs she
sells from the lobby during weekend street festivals.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my dreamscape," said Fuller, 76, a former columnist for a
local newspaper. "My magic carpet. It's a great place to be
inspired."</TE>

<HD>San Clemente, Jolted Awake</HD>
<DH>Development: Huge housing tracts and a proposed toll road
and rail line pinch a surfer's paradise and former Nixon retreat.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every chance he gets, Drew Brophy surfs some of the world's most
celebrated breaks off San Clemente's coast, catching the same waves
that once washed over the black wingtips Richard Nixon wore strolling
along the beach at the Western White House.</LD>
<LD>   Along the secluded shoreline, Brophy feels as far removed from the
bustle of life as Nixon did escaping here from Washington after the
Watergate scandal.</LD>
<LD>   At the southern tip of Orange County, in the shadow of the San
Onofre nuclear power plant, San Clemente has long been a reminder of
what California coastal towns used to be, with uncrowded beaches and
an old-fashioned downtown free of big-box retailers that dot the rest
of suburbia.</LD>
<TE>   But time is finally catching up with San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   Up in the backcountry, huge housing developments are rising.
Transportation officials want to carve a toll road through the city's
eastern end and build a second set of railroad tracks along the
coast. And at San Onofre, the federal government wants the facility
to hold buried radioactive waste, further unnerving residents who
learned last week they would receive special pills in case terrorism
or some other disaster causes a radiation leak.</TE>
<TE>   Around downtown, the small bungalows that until a few years ago
were considered among the last beach-side bargains in Southern
California are being torn down at a rapid rate and replaced with
grander homes.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic is worse than ever, many longtime residents say, and they
fear driving will only get worse over the next two decades, when San
Clemente's population is expected to climb 30%.</TE>
<TE>   Brophy, 31, doesn't like it one bit. An artist by trade, he moved
to San Clemente in 1993, in search of the place he lost when his
hometown of Myrtle Beach, S.C., "went from a sweet little beach town
to a Las Vegas strip."</TE>
<TE>   Now, as he scans his adopted home, "it seems like every week
there's something new. It's endless.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of scary to think this little treasure isn't going to
last. This is one of the last places in California where it's still
the way it's always been," Brophy said.</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente sprouted up on the former Ranchos los Desechos
("Leftover Land"), which was abandoned because it was too steep and
overgrown to graze cattle or sheep.</TE>
<TE>   Ole Hanson, a land speculator and the city's father, vowed to
create a "Spanish village" when he pitched a white canopy tent along
Old Coast Highway in 1927 and sold the first plots.</TE>
<TE>   "I envision a place where people can live together more pleasantly
than any other place in America," Hanson wrote to a friend. "This
will be a place where a man can breathe!"</TE>
<TE>   Hanson's white stucco homes now blend with the beach bungalows,
townhomes and apartments that are tucked along narrow streets and
alleys. Many of the seaside neighborhoods are within walking distance
of Avenida del Mar, the main road leading to the pier.</TE>
<TE>   San Onofre State Beach is one of the city's most treasured gems.
Steep sandstone bluffs stretch for miles. Picnickers grill hot dogs
under thatched-roof huts. Anglers cast their lines from rocky shores.
Out in the distance, surfers ride breaks such as Cotton's Point,
Churches and Trestles.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon, often wearing suit and tie, walked these same sandy shores
when he wasn't entertaining foreign dignitaries, signing landmark
accords or dodging demonstrators at Casa Pacifica ("House of Peace"),
the bluff-top estate that became his retreat from 1969 to 1980.</TE>
<TE>   For all the unwanted publicity he brought to San Clemente during
his presidency and the self-imposed exile that followed his
resignation, one of his other legacies was converting Camp
Pendleton's beaches into a state park and preserving them as a
surfing haven.</TE>
<TE>   Even as development exploded in south Orange County in the 1970s
and 1980s, San Clemente remained an island of relative calm.
Initially, it was less desirable for development because of its
distance from large job centers. The city was further isolated
because only two major highways ran through it, Interstate 5 and the
Coast Highway.</TE>
<TE>   Residents liked it that way. Voters passed a slow-growth measure
in 1988 that permitted only 500 new homes a year until 2006.</TE>
<TE>   But over the past decade, urban sprawl has reached San Clemente's
doorstep. In the mid-1990s, the San Joaquin Hills toll road opened to
the north, providing more access to San Clemente. Office towers and
business parks sprouted up in Irvine and Costa Mesa, creating jobs
closer to town.</TE>
<TE>   "When the [tollway] opened up, it became an entirely new picture,"
said John Martin of Martin &amp; Associates, an urban planning firm in
Newport Beach. "It was a huge transformation in commuting patterns."</TE>
<TE>   Several upscale housing developments that are in the works on the
northeastern edge of the city will add more than 5,000 homes. Such
growth is permitted because some of the developments lie just outside
city limits, in county territory.</TE>
<TE>   A little to the north, Rancho Mission Viejo wants to build 14,000
homes and more than 5 million square feet of office and retail space
in one of the largest swaths of open space remaining in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   The transportation Corridor Agencies propose an extension of the
Foothill South toll road that would wind 16 miles through those same
23,000 acres of wilderness and eventually connect to the Santa Ana
Freeway near San Onofre State Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Many residents fear the massive new projects will kill what is
unique about the town.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Netherby, a former editor at Field &amp; Stream magazine,
discovered San Clemente in 1973 when his Chevy Camaro broke down
there on the freeway. The first door he knocked on for help happened
to be the home of a real estate agent who soon showed him and his
wife the home they have occupied since. It is now worth 10 times the
$49,950 they paid for it.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to run and hike in the back country and would rarely see
another footprint," he said. "And now all the developers and builders
are dueling over this great space with wonderful natural resources
that has kind of been overlooked for a long time. And those of us who
live here want to preserve what we have."</TE>
<TE>   The new development is not without supporters. The slow-growth
policies of the 1980s are blamed for chronic financial shortfalls at
City Hall, which have led to cuts in city services. Those backers say
the growth will provide the city with badly needed revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The city is more united on the issue of double-tracking the rails
along the beach. Amtrak hopes to add a second track as part of a
20-year program to expand service, increase capacity and reduce the
time of train trips. The tracks would run right along the beach, in
front of the landmark pier.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is, the beach is narrow enough right now as it is,"
said Gavin Herbert, who now inhabits Nixon's villa. He points toward
the tracks that once brought Franklin D. Roosevelt to town to play
poker with Ham Cotton, the estate's original owner.</TE>
<TE>   Herbert has started a foundation that has raised $40,000 to fund a
public relations campaign against the plan, one of an assortment of
efforts under way on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilwoman Stephanie Dorey, who ran on a quality-of-life
platform in 2000 and regularly holds grass-roots meetings in her
living room, hints that she will lie on the tracks if she has to.</TE>
<TE>   All over town, lawn signs trumpet the slogan "Derail the Rail."</TE>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, residents have also been
taking a second look at their imposing neighbor to the south: the San
Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. They have been pushing for
tightened security at the plant as well as distribution of potassium
iodide tablets to help prevent thyroid cancer after a radiation leak.
The state last week agreed to distribute pills to residents living
within 10 miles of San Onofre.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government now wants to house a long-term repository
for spent nuclear fuel, which would be stored in dry casks.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents fear that the casks would be damaged in a powerful
earthquake and could make San Onofre an even more attractive target
for terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   All the worries over nuclear storage, train tracks and growth
frustrate old-timers, but they try to keep it in perspective.</TE>
<TE>   In the courtyard of Hotel San Clemente, a group of retirees share
coffee and stories, which they've been doing every day but Thursdays
for 11 years. Dorothy Fuller, who lives on the third floor and is one
of San Clemente's earliest residents, shows up with the photographs
she sells from the lobby during weekend street festivals.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my dreamscape," said Fuller, 76, a former columnist for a
local newspaper. "My magic carpet. It's a great place to be
inspired."</TE>

<HD>Senate to Consider Budget Plan That Includes Higher Taxes
for Wealthy</HD>
<DH>Legislature: As the Assembly deadlocks over education
funding, Democrats oppose governor's proposal to increase vehicle
license fees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- Senate Budget Committee Chairman Steve Peace said that
a budget package he expects the Senate to take up on Tuesday will
feature a proposal to increase taxes on the wealthy instead of a plan
by Gov. Gray Davis to raise vehicle license fees paid by motorists.</LD>
<LD>   The El Cajon Democrat released new details Sunday on the Senate
plan as negotiations over a budget compromise between the Senate and
the Assembly remained stalled because of a standoff in the lower
house over education funding.</LD>
<LD>   Peace said he might call a meeting today of the budget conference
committee, but that, barring a resolution of the Assembly dispute, he
would proceed with his plan to put a budget up for a vote in the
Senate. The deadline for a budget to be in place for the start of the
new fiscal year is July 1.</LD>
<TE>   Peace said he planned to present Senate lawmakers with both a
budget bill and a separate bill containing a variety of tax hikes and
spending restorations. He said the tax proposals would include a plan
by Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) to increase income
taxes on wealthy Californians to raise $2.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Also contained in the Senate plan is a suspension of a solar tax
credit and a tax hike on cigarettes--both of which were previously
floated by the Davis administration.</TE>
<TE>   Davis opposes Burton's income tax plan. When he released his
revised budget in May, the governor noted that the state already
suffers from a disproportionate dependence on high-end taxpayers to
fill state coffers. Wild swings in their earnings from stock options
and capital gains have contributed to a dramatic dip in tax revenue
collected by the state.</TE>
<TE>   Davis favors raising $1.3 billion in the next fiscal year by
essentially doubling the vehicle license fees paid by motorists.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor has not changed his position," the governor's
spokeswoman, Hilary McLean, said Sunday. "He is still in favor of his
proposal, which is balanced and responsible."</TE>
<TE>   Democratic lawmakers, according to Peace, favor the Burton
proposal. Raising vehicle license fees is viewed as regressive by
many Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to abandoning the Davis license fee proposal, the
Senate plan also does not suspend a tax credit bestowed on
teachers--a suspension the budget conference committee had previously
approved.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate plan mirrors the committee's work by including money to
expand a health insurance program for poor children to cover their
parents and to backfill money paid by cities to counties for booking
suspects into county jail.</TE>
<TE>   It also includes additional funding for firefighting and restores
money for a tax program favored by environmentalists and farmers that
rewards landowners for keeping their parcels undeveloped.</TE>
<TE>   One feature of the Senate plan that could cause concern among
school officials is a proposal to delay about $400 million in
education funding in excess of what is required by state law until
the 2003-04 budget year.</TE>

<HD>A New Kind of Watering Hole Is Brewing in Rowdy Ensenada</HD>
<DH>Trends: Coffeehouses are springing up in a city known for
its raucous bar scene.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ENSENADA</DL>
<LD>Maria del Mar has a favorite table at a local cafe that she visits
every night after work.</LD>
<LD>   The ritual is simple. She sits down with a good book, orders a
cappuccino and biscotti, then revels in what she describes as "the
tranquillity of the place."</LD>
<LD>   "I spend several hours each week there," said the 21-year-old real
estate office manager. "I just enjoy cafes."</LD>
<TE>   So do thousands of other Mexicans in this seaport community of
300,000, where coffeehouses are suddenly all the rage, injecting a
new vibrancy into a place best known to Americans for its rowdy bars
and nightclubs.</TE>
<TE>   At least a dozen cafes--many of them brand new--dot downtown
shopping centers and street corners. Many more are about to open, or
are in the planning stages across town.</TE>
<TE>   What's driving Ensenada's emerging cafe society?</TE>
<TE>   Cafe operators say they are catering to the hordes of retired
Americans who have relocated here in recent years, to thousands of
tourists arriving daily on cruise ships, and to a burgeoning Mexican
middle-class composed of students, professionals and business owners,
many of them connected to the local university.</TE>
<TE>   To hear cafe owners tell it, their clientele is not the least bit
interested in the city's club scene, or in the antics of young
Americans who arrive by the carload to run amok in such infamous
downtown watering holes as Hussong's Cantina and Papas and Beer.</TE>
<TE>   "Inside these cafes is the future of Ensenada," said Nancy Conroy,
editor of the biweekly Baja California newspaper Gringo Gazette.
"It's a generally young crowd, wearing black turtlenecks, playing
chess, smoking fine cigars and arguing over revolutionary hero
Emiliano Zapata and international politics."</TE>
<TE>   "Anymore, locals don't say, 'Meet me at the bar or disco.' They
say, 'Let's get together over a cup of coffee.' "</TE>
<TE>   In what some would call an already saturated market, they have
plenty of places to do just that.</TE>
<TE>   Often located only a few yards apart, Ensenada's cafes try to set
themselves apart from the competition with clever names--Cafe Kaffa,
Kaffe con K, Cafe Tomas, Cafe Topo, Cafe Pueblo--and flashy logos
using bright colors and ultramodern designs.</TE>
<TE>   Inside are gleaming wood floors, chess sets and magazine racks,
and glass cases offering freshly baked fruit-and-nut bars, scones,
cakes and submarine sandwiches. Soothing Brazilian jazz, blues and
soft rock music issues from hidden speakers. Some include plush
salons with huge sofas and potted plants. Others offer shady sidewalk
tables.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a movement that is starting to interest people--90% of them
local," said Mariano Sanchez, co-owner of the gleaming Cafe Tomas,
which opened three years ago just doors from Hussong's.</TE>
<TE>   "I am even planning to open another cafe soon, also in the
downtown area," Sanchez said. Hoping to cash in on the craze, even
some well-established restaurants have recently posted signs and
banners emblazoned with the words "coffeehouse."</TE>
<TE>   No one can say whether the cafe movement will last.</TE>
<TE>   After all, Ensenada is also known for its copycat business culture
in which a successful venture can spark construction of others just
like it right next door.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, karaoke bars were hot. Then came fruit slush
stands, which were followed by a citywide yen for frappes. Now, it's
gourmet coffee bars.</TE>
<TE>   Reclining on a big white couch in La Taza cafe and sipping an iced
mocha, 25-year-old oceanography student Emmanuel de la Garza put it
this way:</TE>
<TE>   "I was in San Diego recently and visited a cafe in a Barnes &amp;
Noble bookstore. It reminded me of Ensenada."</TE>
<TE>   In an Internet cafe a few blocks away, construction worker Jose
Diaz, 30, said, "Everybody here wants exactly what Americans have.
Right now, Americans see a Starbucks and it's like giving candy to a
baby. Therefore, cafes are popping up all over Ensenada."</TE>
<TE>   One of the newest--and tiniest--is Kaffe con K, which opened a
week ago on a busy corner, where owners Alex and Vilka Rascon expect
to attract locals racing between home and work.</TE>
<TE>   Stationed behind the counter of her tiny blue-and-white cafe on a
recent weekday, Vilka Rascon, 24, prepared a fresh Caesar salad for a
local carpenter who had minutes to spare for lunch.</TE>
<TE>   "These days, people are working harder and longer than ever--they
don't have time for lunch breaks," said Rascon who, like her husband,
was formerly employed in a maquiladora plant near the border.</TE>
<TE>   "So we sell light, healthy things: salad, fruit plates,
'subwiches,' " she said. "And gourmet cappuccino."</TE>
<TE>   Still, opening a cafe in Ensenada can be risky.</TE>
<TE>   Nursing a cup of coffee at Cafe Kaffa, a tony coffee bar facing
busy Calle Primera, Ensenada nightclub owner Tom Pearson recalled
investing $15,000 in a cafe two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   That business, which specialized in Costa Rican, Spanish and
Mexican coffees, failed within a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Advertising does nothing at all for you in this town," he said.
"Unless you have a large circle of loyal friends to do business with,
you're not going to make it in Ensenada."</TE>
<TE>   Maria Madrigal and her son, Enrique, hope Pearson is wrong.</TE>
<TE>   They recently built a chic cafe in a secluded Spanish-style plaza
near the center of Ensenada's tourist sector. Called Cafe Ballesta,
it features a 100-gallon saltwater aquarium, blond wood counters,
light blue tile floors and soft jazz.</TE>
<TE>   "What makes us different from all the others is our marine
ambience, gourmet food and coffee, privacy and quiet," Enrique
Madrigal said. "But like them, we reflect good taste, an appreciation
for clean, healthy lifestyles and a positive future for Ensenada."</TE>

<HD>Justin Dart Jr., 71; Pressed for Landmark Law for Disabled</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Justin Dart Jr., a leader in the battle for equal rights for disabled
Americans, died Saturday at his home in Washington, D.C. He was 71.</LD>
<LD>   In failing health since 1997 after a series of heart attacks, Dart
died in his sleep of natural causes.</LD>
<LD>   To advocates for the disabled, Dart was the driving force behind
the Americans with Disabilities Act, the landmark 1990 civil rights
law.</LD>
<TE>   "He was one of our country's greatest warriors in the fight for
civil rights for people with disabilities," Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
(D-Mass.) said Saturday in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a friend of mine, and I will miss him very much."</TE>
<TE>   Born to privilege, Dart was the son of Justin Dart, the late
Southern California industrialist and a longtime political advisor to
Ronald Reagan. His grandfather was the founder of the Walgreens drug
store chain.</TE>
<TE>   Justin Dart Jr. was born in Chicago. An underachieving student, he
attended seven private high schools in different parts of the
country. At 18, he contracted polio while attending high school in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "They thought I was going to die, but I spent more than a year in
a rehab hospital," he told the Chicago Tribune some years ago. Dart
first tried college in California but transferred to the University
of Houston, where he earned a bachelor's degree in history and later
a master's degree.</TE>
<TE>   Politically liberal in those days, Dart organized his campus'
first human-rights club, which advocated the integration of the
all-white university. The club attracted only five members.</TE>
<TE>   "This was in the days of Joe McCarthy and the Dixiecrats," Dart
told the Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoyed liberal Democratic politics, and I got active in that.
People thought we were close to communism. I got heavy into civil
rights way before the 1960s. I even had an FBI file."</TE>
<TE>   But his political awakening was limited, and he didn't think much
about the rights of the disabled--even though Texas officials tried
to withhold his high school teaching certificate because he used a
wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   Dart dabbled in law school at the University of Texas, quit that
and opened a bowling alley in Austin.</TE>
<TE>   In 1962, his father sent him to Japan to start the firm that
became Japan Tupperware Inc. Within two years, Dart built the company
from three employees to 25,000 employees working in 152 offices.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stigma of Disability</TE>
<TE>   Dart also started independent living centers and sponsored a work
program in Japan for those coming out of hospitals who were
employable but faced the social stigma of being disabled.</TE>
<TE>   While in Japan, Dart met his wife, Yoshiko, who survives him along
with their five daughters.</TE>
<TE>   Dart would later recall that he and his conservative father often
clashed over political issues.</TE>
<TE>   "There were some years we didn't meet at all," Dart once told The
Times. "He was so intense about his politics, and I was so intense
about mine."</TE>
<TE>   But Dart added: "We did agree on one thing--the importance of
democracy and the democratic process. He told me to participate in
the democratic process as if your life depended on it because it
does."</TE>
<TE>   After 12 years in Japan, Dart and his family returned to Texas,
and he wrote extensively about the issues surrounding disability in
the workplace. He created an independent living facility for the
disabled in Austin and was named to the state commission on
disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1980s, President Reagan named Dart to the National
Council on Disability and over time Dart and other committee members
developed an agenda that declared civil rights for the disabled to be
a national priority.</TE>
<TE>   They next turned to writing another document called "Total
Independence," which outlined points that later became the Americans
with Disabilities Act.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, Dart was appointed to head the Rehabilitation Services
Administration under the Department of Education, then headed by
William Bennett. By all accounts Dart was a hard worker, conducting
research on disability-related issues in all 50 states and five
Indian nations.</TE>
<TE>   He called for radical change in the way the $3-billion agency was
being run and urged that people with disabilities be included in
every aspect of program implementation and design.</TE>
<TE>   His tenure with the agency was short-lived, however, after he
delivered what he called a "statement of conscience" in an open
congressional hearing, saying the agency was "afflicted ... by
profound problems in areas such as management, personnel and resource
utilization."</TE>
<TE>   He resurfaced in 1989 as chairman of the President's Committee on
the Employment of People with Disabilities, lobbying for civil rights
legislation to cover the disabled. President George Bush signed the
Americans with Disabilities Act into law on July 26, 1990, and gave
Dart the first pen he used to set his name to the historic statute.</TE>
<TE>   Dart, who had been a supporter of Reagan and later Bush through
the 1980s, joined the Clinton administration's push for universal
health care in the 1990s. When that effort failed, he returned his
focus to the rights of the disabled in the face of efforts by the
conservative Congress to water down the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Clinton in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial is planned for July 26, the 12th anniversary of the
signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act.</TE>

<HD>Schools Appealing Transfer Policy</HD>
<DH>Integration: Trustees in Huntington Beach ask state Supreme
Court to rule on policy that they say maintains racial balance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Huntington Beach Union High School District will ask the state
Supreme Court to decide the fate of its policy of denying student
transfers in order to maintain racial balance in its schools.</LD>
<LD>   The legal case could clarify how public primary and secondary
schools are affected by Proposition 209, the 1996 ballot initiative
that banned consideration of race and ethnicity in public education,
thus ending affirmative action.</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks ago, the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana
struck down the Huntington Beach district's policy, ruling that its
attempt to keep a "racial and ethnic balance" was unconstitutional
and violated Proposition 209.</LD>
<TE>   "This opinion from the appellate court is a far departure from the
past precedents the California Supreme Court has set prior to
Proposition 209," said the school district's attorney David Larsen,
adding that he believes the policy complies with the state education
code.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month the district's board voted 4-1 to appeal the
case to the state Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents say the transfer policy allows for open enrollment and
ensures racial integration. Critics counter that the policy
discriminates against white students.</TE>
<TE>   Many are surprised by the school district's decision to continue
the legal battle, especially now, when funds are scarce. "It's
egregious. They're not taking no for an answer," said Pacific Legal
Foundation attorney Sharon L. Browne, whose client, Donald Bruce
Crawford, filed the lawsuit challenging the policy.</TE>
<TE>   "The school district was supposed to amend its policies to comply
with Prop. 209, and they have not done so," Browne said.</TE>
<TE>   Larsen said the policy ensures that open enrollment transfers
don't become a vehicle for "white flight," or create ethnically
isolated schools. School district officials said the policy was
necessary to stem racial segregation, and that the ill-feelings it
created were inadvertent.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intentions were very good, and we were trying to avoid
racially isolated schools," said trustee Sallie Dashiell.</TE>
<TE>   "But either way, it seems we run into discrimination issues."</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in 1994, students could request transfers to any of the
district's high schools.</TE>
<TE>   After district officials saw many white students transferring out
of schools with large ethnic populations, it revised the policy in
1999, forcing a 1-to-1 ratio to keep racial and ethnic balance on
campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Westminster and Ocean View high schools were most affected by the
change.</TE>
<TE>   Fountain Valley resident Crawford sued in 1999, alleging that the
policy restricted transfers of white students from schools with large
numbers of minorities, such as Westminster High School, which has a
large Asian population.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford wasn't the only one concerned. "I saw the racial quota
policy as troublesome," said Matthew Harper, a trustee and the only
dissenting vote against the decision to appeal the case to the
California Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever that issue came up in our district, people expressed
[that] they wanted to get rid of race identity politics," Harper
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents said the controversial transfer policy isn't a race
issue.</TE>
<TE>   After all, they said, it was developed and adopted by a community
committee comprising district officials, students, teachers and
parents.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the problem of open enrollment," said Renee Van Arsdale,
whose son, Alex, was denied a transfer. "I have compassion for the
district. They want open enrollment, but every time they try to be
sensitive to the state mandates for racial integration, they get
sued.</TE>
<TE>   " It's really a social issue," Van Arsdale said. "Kids want to go
to the schools where their neighborhood friends go."</TE>

<HD>Secession Issue Was Sneaked Onto Ballot, Some in Hollywood
Charge</HD>
<DH>Election: Residents say that too little was done to inform
them about the possible breakaway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NITA LELYVELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Hollywood, where residents will vote in November on whether to
split away from the rest of Los Angeles, people in several
neighborhoods say they were blindsided by the news that their slice
of the city could soon secede.</LD>
<LD>   Recent debates and forums on Hollywood cityhood have drawn large,
vocal crowds, with many speakers complaining that they did not know
their communities were included in the proposed secession area. "This
has been a silent, sub rosa takeover, a hostile takeover," said Susan
Polifronio, who has owned the Counterpoint bookstore on Franklin
Avenue since 1979.</LD>
<LD>   She and other residents and merchants have directed their sharpest
criticism at the process that led to the Hollywood ballot measure,
including the circulation of petitions that they thought authorized a
cityhood study only, not an election. They complain too that the
Local Agency Formation Commission, which put the Hollywood proposal
before voters, did not do enough to inform residents during its
months-long review of secession.</LD>
<TE>   City Councilman Tom La Bonge, who represents part of Hollywood,
says he hears that complaint often and agrees with it.</TE>
<TE>   "There certainly wasn't enough [information] about Hollywood," he
said. "I think LAFCO could have done a better job of articulating
their responsibility. I think they could have done a better job of
showing what their role and mission was."</TE>
<TE>   Gene La Pietra, founder of the secession group Hollywood VOTE,
disagrees. He says secession opponents had plenty of warning that a
vote could be coming.</TE>
<TE>   "We engaged in a very painstaking process, going door to door in
Hollywood, with door knockers, surveys, petitions. We did a poll. We
ourselves held many meetings," La Pietra said. He noted that LAFCO
held a series of public hearings around the city, and that the news
media covered the commission's proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some opponents say they were never contacted about
secession, and they want nothing to do with it. In the last few
weeks, half a dozen homeowners associations have protested their
neighborhoods' inclusion in the proposed city.</TE>
<TE>   An independent Hollywood, population 160,000, would be bounded
roughly by Laurel Canyon Boulevard on the west, Vermont Avenue on the
east, Melrose Avenue on the south and Griffith Park on the north.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Los Feliz Improvement Assn. persuaded LAFCO to
remove an area north of Franklin Avenue from the proposed Hollywood
boundaries but failed to get a bigger area to the west excluded.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Hunt, a member of the Melrose Hill Neighborhood Assn., a
historic area at the southeastern end of Hollywood, said his group
joined with another homeowners organization a year and a half ago to
collect 4,000 signatures against secession. But LAFCO said the
signatures weren't properly certified and that secessionists had
obtained plenty of signatures on their petition in the area.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, we're pretty well resigned to trying to defeat
this at the polls," said Hunt, an architect who chairs his
association's planning board. "Everything we've done up until now has
been a complete waste of time."</TE>
<TE>   Other opponents say they are furious that they unwittingly helped
launch the secession movement by signing the petitions. They say they
were told the petitions called merely for a study, although the
documents do make a clear reference to an election.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what I call this? A bait-and-switch operation," said
Walter Blackman, a retired teacher who lives in the Hollywood Hills
and is a member of the anti-secession group Hollywood and Los Angeles
as One (HALO).</TE>
<TE>   A copy of the original petition received by LAFCO is labeled
"Petition for Special Reorganization." Underneath the title, it
reads: "This petition proposes to request LAFCO to study and
determine the feasibility of Hollywood Cityhood and allow the people
of Hollywood and Los Angeles the opportunity to vote on the question
of forming a new, independent City of Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, many anti-secessionists say part of their frustration
comes from the fact that Hollywood has improved lately. They cite new
projects such as the Hollywood &amp; Highland shopping center and the
energy of their City Council members--La Bonge and Eric Garcetti.</TE>
<TE>   HALO was formed by a group of Hollywood residents who met while
trying to launch a neighborhood council--a key innovation of the
city's charter reform. The neighborhood councils are still in a
nascent state, with many yet to be certified by the city. HALO
members say they are enthusiastic about their council's potential.</TE>
<TE>   They also say they are worried that if Hollywood secedes, their
voices will not be heard in the new city. One problem, they say, is
that the Nov. 5 ballot includes a contest for five Hollywood city
council members who would take office if secession wins.</TE>
<TE>   "I am opposing the whole idea of secession, so how can I run for
the Hollywood city council just in case? It wouldn't look right, and
it doesn't make sense," said HALO member David Schlesinger, who has
lived in the Hollywood Hills since 1939.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra says the growing debate in Hollywood is healthy. As for
the complaints, he said: "The opposition is looking for something in
the past. We've gone beyond all that. We're on the ballot. If
anybody's unhappy, they'll be able to express themselves at the polls
on the 5th of November."</TE>

<HD>Gang Members Out of Sight Since Injunction</HD>
<DH>Pacoima: Police contend that the court order is working and
some residents say they feel safer in the troubled area. But assaults
are up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several months ago, the southeast gate to the San Fernando Gardens
housing project in Pacoima was swarming with gang members.</LD>
<LD>   The so-called Pacoima Project Boys, bragging that they were
untouchable, blatantly ignored a gang injunction that made it illegal
for them to be seen together.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, because of police warnings and more than a dozen
arrests, fewer gang members have been seen hanging out together,
residents and Los Angeles police say.</LD>
<TE>   Capt. Kris Pitcher of the Foothill Division said family, traffic
and business disputes--and not gang activity--are responsible for the
rise in assaults in the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "My gang unit has reported that Project Boys activity has been
rather light, and we don't run into a lot of them anymore," he said.
"We have a gang problem, but the injunction is working."</TE>
<TE>   Like other gang injunctions, the court order issued against the
Pacoima Project Boys on Aug. 22, 2001, made it a misdemeanor for any
two gang members to associate in a "safety zone" bordered by Paxton
Street on the north, Glenoaks Boulevard on the east, Pierce Street on
the south and San Fernando Road on the west. Violators face up to six
months in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy City Atty. Jim McDougal said the Los Angeles Police
Department targeted the Project Boys because they have been one of
the San Fernando Valley's most violent gangs over the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   "Injunctions work. I'm not sure why they work, but they do," he
said. "It's strange how gangsters who commit felonies day in and day
out will obey a court order."</TE>
<TE>   Residents and authorities acknowledge that gang members still
gather at times--getting together at night or during the day by
keeping a watch out for officers. But residents feel safer because
there are fewer gang members around to harass them.</TE>
<TE>   That feeling persists even though as of June 17, there were 63
aggravated assaults in the area covered by the injunction, compared
with 68 for all of 2001, according to LAPD statistics.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Postal Service letter carrier Lisa Castillo said the San
Fernando Gardens mail route she began earlier this year has not been
anywhere near as troublesome as she thought it would be.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had no problem at all and I never even see those gang
members everyone was talking about," Castillo said.</TE>
<TE>   A 20-year resident of the projects who, leery of retaliation,
asked not to be identified, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "You just don't see them anymore," he said. "There used to be a
whole gang of them."</TE>
<TE>   A block away, at David M. Gonzalez Park, a few gang members were
lounging and playing handball, in violation of the injunction. Two of
them said the park serves as a good observation post to spot police
and run, because "we are too fast for them."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the park, a heavily tattooed member of the Pacoima Project
Boys rode by on his bicycle. He said he was jailed for violating the
injunction and the terms of his probation by associating with known
gang members in September.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't bang no more," said the 25-year-old man, who would not
give his name. "I don't even want the police to see me alone. I'm
going back to the projects where I belong."</TE>
<TE>   Since it began, 13 members of the gang have been arrested for
violating the injunction, Pitcher said.</TE>
<TE>   A UCLA professor who has studied more than 20 gang injunctions in
Los Angeles County since 1993 said he believes they help reduce
crime.</TE>
<TE>   "The year after these things are imposed, we usually see a 5% to
10% reduction in violent crime without any increase in the adjoining
area," said Jeffrey Grogger, a professor at UCLA's School of Public
Policy. "Obviously, 5% to 10% is not putting an end to crime, but
these injunctions at least can decrease it."</TE>
<TE>   Although some people worry about the civil liberties of gang
members, courts have ruled that injunctions are constitutional, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the criticisms raised is they provide police a license to
crack down not only on gang members but anyone who looks like a gang
member," Grogger said.</TE>
<TE>   Police generally praised injunctions.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a tremendous assist," said Lt. Gary Nanson, head of the
LAPD's gang unit in the Valley. "It takes a while to get going, but
once they do, the gangs go undercover. You just don't see them
anymore."</TE>

<HD>Legal Status Sought for Workers</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Campaign aims to gain residency for
undocumented immigrants. Backers hope it will ensure a supply of farm
labor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County labor leaders and community activists are waging a
campaign aimed at gaining legal status for millions of undocumented
immigrants said to be working in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   From church courtyards to union halls, supporters of the Million
Voices for Legalization campaign have been collecting specially
designed postcards that urge President Bush and members of Congress
to back efforts that would allow "hard-working, taxpaying immigrants"
to become legal residents.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 3,000 cards have been collected in Ventura County since the
May 15 campaign kickoff. Those efforts are part of a nationwide drive
to collect and deliver 1 million postcards to the White House this
fall.</LD>
<TE>   "The contributions of immigrant workers to this country are
essential and tremendous, but so many are forced to live in fear of
being punished because of their immigration status," said Jessica
Arciniega, a labor organizer with the Oxnard office of the United
Farm Workers union.</TE>
<TE>   The UFW, one of the campaign's sponsors, held a rally Sunday at
Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church in Oxnard to drum up support
and signatures for the legalization drive.</TE>
<TE>   "They pay taxes and they work the hardest jobs," Arciniega said.
"This is a campaign to recognize the contributions immigrants are
making and to reward them for their hard work by granting them legal
status."</TE>
<TE>   The signature-gathering campaign is an attempt to revive a push
for immigration reform derailed by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Before the attacks, immigration--including the possibility of
granting legal status to millions of illegal immigrants--was at the
top of a bilateral agenda being discussed by Bush and Mexican
President Vicente Fox.</TE>
<TE>   The terrorist strikes put those efforts on hold, as the White
House shifted focus from immigration reform to a review of
immigration laws aimed at improving the government's ability to keep
out or deport foreigners with suspected terrorist ties.</TE>
<TE>   California agriculture plays a key role in the current push for
legalization.</TE>
<TE>   Growers across the state say they are increasingly encountering
labor shortages, as legal immigrants leave the fields for more stable
jobs and the farm labor force--500,000 workers at peak season--swells
with illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   By some estimates, at least half and as many as 70% of the state's
farm workers are undocumented.</TE>
<TE>   Farm groups have lined up behind legislation, introduced last
summer by Sen. Larry E. Craig (R-Idaho), that would overhaul the
federal guest worker program established under the Immigration Reform
and Control Act of 1986. That program allows agricultural employers
to temporarily recruit foreign workers if they are unable to find
enough domestic help for their harvests.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation, which aims to expand the program and makes it
easier for growers to obtain guest workers, contains provisions that
would lead to the legalization of laborers who agree to work in
agriculture for a specified period of time.</TE>
<TE>   "This thing would have been done last fall had it not been for the
9/11 incident," said farm industry attorney Rob Roy, who as a member
of the board of directors of the National Council of Agricultural
Employers has been involved for years with immigration reform
efforts. He is president and general counsel for the Ventura County
Agricultural Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "The agricultural community feels it would not be appropriate to
reward someone for violations of immigration laws," Roy said, "but
that [illegal immigrants] should earn the right to legalization."</TE>
<TE>   Labor advocates favor a less restrictive legalization program, and
many are backing competing bills introduced by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
(D-Mass.) and California Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Mission Hills).</TE>
<TE>   Those bills would allow illegal immigrant workers to apply for
legal status sooner than under the Craig proposal.</TE>
<TE>   They also contain provisions that reform the existing guest worker
program, making it easier for growers to use.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to offer those workers who are here now without proper
documentation the opportunity to earn legalization," UFW spokesman
Marc Grossman said.</TE>
<TE>   That is also the goal of the Million Voices for Legalization
campaign but on a broader scale.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign was launched in 30 U.S. cities by a coalition of
labor unions, religious groups and community organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County drive has tapped everyone from soccer players
to local attorneys to collect signatures at festivals and other
community events.</TE>
<TE>   For Port Hueneme resident Arcelia Hernandez, the
signature-gathering drive has special significance.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Mexico, Hernandez came to the United States illegally
with her farm worker parents when she was about 8 years old.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until the Immigration Reform and Control Act was
approved in 1986--when Hernandez was in high school and her family
was deeply rooted in the San Joaquin Valley--that the family was able
to obtain legal status.</TE>
<TE>   Now Hernandez, who went on to earn an undergraduate degree in
psychology from Stanford University and a master's degree in public
policy from Claremont Graduate University, heads a committee formed
recently to support the signature-gathering drive and make sure other
immigrants have similar opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about workers who are contributing to our economy,
who pay federal and local taxes but who don't get any say in where
their money goes or derive any benefit from their hard work," said
Hernandez, who this fall will join the faculty at Cal Lutheran
University in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth of the matter is our economy depends on the labor
provided by these immigrants," she said. "To have these families here
without legal status just isn't right."</TE>

<HD>Budget Cuts May Force Closings at Library Branches</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Public Library, which only recently returned
most of its 84 branches to full-time schedules, is facing a new round
of budget cuts that could force officials to close 16 branches or
once again reduce hours across the system.</LD>
<LD>   With the Board of Supervisors scheduled this week to consider a
spending plan that would cut $9.6 million from the library's
$80-million budget, library workers also expect to reduce their book
buying by 33%, said the county librarian, Margaret Donnellan Todd.</LD>
<LD>   "This is definitely not what I came here to do when I took this
job a year ago," Todd said. "Slowly but surely, we've done everything
we can to make savings and we've just hit the wall this year. It's
really sad."</LD>
<TE>   Although the library's budget has not yet been approved and money
could be found to avoid some of the cuts, frustrated library workers
are already working to put the cuts into effect.</TE>
<TE>   Todd is preparing options to achieve the cuts. In one, 16 branches
would close and the remaining branches would open four to six days a
week. In the other, all branches would remain open, but for only
three to six days a week.</TE>
<TE>   To reduce money spent on supplies, library workers are searching
storage rooms for old fliers to advertise events, hoping they can
black out the old dates and write in the new.</TE>
<TE>   All this, Todd said, is expected to irritate the 2.5 million
residents who hold county cards and check out 14.7 million items a
year.</TE>
<TE>   News of the cutbacks saddened those attending a recent
storytelling session for preschoolers at the branch in Montebello.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh no, I wish they wouldn't do that," Stella Velasquez said as
she held her 5-year-old daughter, Jessica, on her lap. "The library
gets the children away from the TV and out of the house. It's an
escape, and that's a big deal."</TE>
<TE>   Library officials have seen a cycle of decreased funding and then
optimistic but temporary fixes. "We are kind of used to it," Todd
said. "Sadly, it's not a huge shock."</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, the county library system was slashed from $62.4 million
to $43.4 million. Ten branches were closed, hours were reduced by 21%
and money for new books was reduced by half.</TE>
<TE>   "In truth, we've never recovered from that money lost in the
mid-'90s," Todd said. But in the last year or two, the library has
returned all of its branches to five-, six- and seven-day schedules.</TE>
<TE>   Even as officials consider closing some libraries, county
supervisors are expected to spend money for five new branches to take
advantage of state grants. Todd said she supports the move.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one-time money, and although the county has to come up with
35% of the money for the new branches, we have to use the state grant
or lose it," said Nancy Mahr, a library spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   At the Hawaiian Gardens branch, librarians said that residents
eagerly anticipate shipments of new books, which come almost every
day in bundles of 10 to 30 books. If the cuts are approved, new
arrivals will be fewer.</TE>
<TE>   Children crowd many libraries since researchers largely abandoned
the system some time ago, reference librarians said. In 1993, when
the book budget was trimmed by half, librarians concentrated their
cuts on low-circulation reference books. As a result, the library
system lacks research books to support many types of study.</TE>
<TE>   Marta Reents, a reference librarian at the Norwalk branch, which
is designated to house the system's collection of business resources,
said she tells most researchers they probably need to go somewhere
else. The library's best book on Mexican trade law, she said, was
published before the North American Free Trade Agreement was enacted
in 1993. "This used to be a fabulous collection," she said, gesturing
at the business books.</TE>

<HD>Mahony Asks Forgiveness for Handling of Scandal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Acknowledging his own shortcomings in handling sexual abuse by the
clergy, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony on Sunday asked "for forgiveness"
from Southern California Catholics "for not understanding earlier the
extent of the problem" or acting sooner to remove priests who abused
minors.</LD>
<LD>   Reading a pastoral letter at a Mass at his childhood parish in
North Hollywood, Mahony also told parishioners that he deeply
apologized to "members of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, and
especially to the victims of clergy sexual abuse."</LD>
<LD>   "I ask for your forgiveness for not understanding earlier the
extent of the problem, and for not taking swifter action to remove
from the ministry anyone who had abused a minor in the past," Mahony
said, reading from a two-page letter that was read to congregations
at the 287 churches throughout the three-county archdiocese.</LD>
<TE>   "The crisis has caused me many sleepless nights filled with
concern for the victims, as well as sadness and anger toward those
priests who have preyed upon the most vulnerable among us--our
children."</TE>
<TE>   At St. Charles Borromeo Church, some parishioners called the
cardinal's letter his most forthright statement yet on past errors
and how to ensure that children never fear for their safety in the
church again. "I think it is great [the cardinal] is trying to be as
upfront with people," said Tom Soule of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Another parishioner, John Adair of Los Angeles, said Mahony's
pastoral letter seeks forgiveness for the past and offers a vision to
improve the future. "It goes some of the way to addressing the hurt
felt by many Catholics," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Zero Tolerance' Policy</TE>
<TE>   Mahony's letter to parishioners in the nation's largest
archdiocese is his first since the U.S. Conference of Bishops in
Dallas adopted a "zero tolerance" policy for clergy abuse nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   During Sunday's Mass, Mahony said such a policy was already in
place in the Los Angeles Archdiocese. It was instituted after the
settlement of a lawsuit with a victim last year.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about the letter Mahony read, Mary Grant, Southern
California regional director for Survivors Network of Those Abused by
Priests, said the cardinal is "cranking up the PR campaign because he
does not want to end up like Cardinal [Bernard] Law." A grand jury is
examining whether Law covered up cases of clergy abuse in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "The only reason Cardinal Mahony is doing anything is because he
got caught covering it," Grant said. "It is like a public plea
bargain: 'Please don't call it a cover-up. It was just a mistake.' "</TE>
<TE>   Mahony made no mention Sunday about specific priests he has
transferred after learning they had been accused of sexual
misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony transferred Father Michael Stephen Baker to several
parishes after the priest told him in 1986 that he had molested young
boys. He later approved a secret $1.3-million settlement with two men
who had allegedly been abused by Baker in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony has admitted he erred in transferring Father Michael Wempe,
who is accused of molesting children, to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
about 14 years ago without telling hospital officials about the
accusations.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony forced Baker to retire in 2000 and Wempe to retire this
year. A grand jury has subpoenaed from the archdiocese all documents
related to Baker and Wempe. They are among more than 50 current and
former priests under investigation in the archdiocese. Nine grand
juries are examining priest abuse nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Before reading the letter Sunday, Mahony told parishioners that no
message is stronger in the Gospels than the message of forgiveness,
that every Mass begins with an acknowledgment of everyone's
sinfulness and that the church is made up of human beings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Church Is a 'Safe Place'</TE>
<TE>   "Our church is safe. It is a safe place most especially for the
most vulnerable of vulnerable," he told St. Charles parishioners.</TE>
<TE>   "I can assure you today that as far as is humanly possible to
know, there is no priest serving in ministry in the Archdiocese of
Los Angeles who has abused a minor even one time," Mahony said later
in the letter. "Moreover, I pledge to all of you that I will never
knowingly allow a priest who has abused a minor to be reassigned to
any ministry."</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese spokesman Tod Tamberg said a "handful" of priests
under investigation are still with the archdiocese; they have been
removed from active church work and placed on temporary
administrative leave pending the criminal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Since returning from Dallas, Mahony told parishioners, he has
expanded the membership and powers of an existing board whose members
examine accusations of sexual misconduct by priests. Establishing
such boards was among the changes agreed upon by the bishops in
Dallas. Mahony said he will seek to laicize all priests found guilty
of abusing a minor--a position the bishops declined to take.</TE>
<TE>   St. Charles parishioners greeted the conclusion of Mahony's
pastoral letter with gentle applause.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a well thought out letter, very direct and to the point,"
said Sami Kawaratani of Sherman Oaks. She said she agrees with Mahony
that the scandal is part of the process of renewal for the church,
one that eventually will make it stronger.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally, something has been done," said Thamara Mendez of North
Hollywood. "It does not matter how long it took."</TE>

<HD>Brokerage Goes Hunting for Goodwill</HD>
<DH>Finances: Eight years after O.C. bankruptcy, Merrill Lynch
courts business. Supervisor says the firm is donning 'white hat'
prematurely.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Orange County's historic bankruptcy in 1994, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
became the Darth Vader of public finance. Now, the giant
brokerage--which the county sued after losing $1.7 billion in its
financial collapse--wants back into the same halls of government from
which it was banished eight years ago.</LD>
<LD>   For months, company officials have been going hat-in-hand around
Orange County, trying to rebuild Merrill Lynch's credibility, as well
as its former client list. The firm, they say, has done enough
penance and deserves a second chance.</LD>
<LD>   "We'd love to do business with the county again," said Richard
Meister, a senior banker with Merrill Lynch's municipal bond
division. "We have great resources we can bring to bear."</LD>
<TE>   For Merrill Lynch, it would be a remarkable turnaround. The
brokerage was a major player in the county's financial collapse,
blamed roundly for dreaming up the risky and self-indulgent
investment strategies that the county is still repaying.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to reverse its fortunes in Orange County, Merrill Lynch has
made overtures to a variety of civic leaders and government
officials, including county Chief Financial Officer Gary Burton and
Treasurer-Tax Collector John M. W. Moorlach. Some officials have
responded favorably, even though county government continues to pay
$93 million interest a year on the $1 billion in bonds it sold to
climb out of its financial crater.</TE>
<TE>   Moorlach, a critic of Merrill Lynch's county representatives at
the time of the bankruptcy, said he wants to do business with the
company again--something he first proposed in 1998 after the firm
paid $420 million to settle the county's lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Other government agencies have already thrown back in with Merrill
Lynch. The Santa Ana Unified School District hired the brokerage in
1999 to underwrite a $13-million bond issue. The Irvine Ranch Water
District has used the brokerage for two years to remarket short-term
debt.</TE>
<TE>   Others are less receptive. The Orange County Transportation
Authority, which has projects on the books worth billions of dollars,
has declined Merrill Lynch's request to meet.</TE>
<TE>   "When Merrill Lynch reimburses the county of Orange for the losses
it suffered in the Orange County bankruptcy, then they can talk about
being benevolent," said OCTA board chairman and county Supervisor
Todd Spitzer, elected two years after the bankruptcy. "It's premature
for them to put the white hat on."</TE>
<TE>   In December 1994, the county's two investment pools lost $1.67
billion in value, most of it because of high-risk securities bought
by former Treasurer Robert L. Citron through Merrill Lynch. The loss
triggered the largest municipal bankruptcy in the nation's history
and rippled through every city, school district and special district
in the county.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Merrill Lynch agreed to pay the county $420 million to
settle a lawsuit alleging the company and its chief Orange County
contact, Michael Stamenson, encouraged Citron to make risky
investments that violated state law. The firm also paid a $30-million
fine levied by the Orange County district attorney's office to
resolve a potential criminal case.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, the firm was knocked from its perch as the top
municipal-bond underwriter as its market share plunged from 18.4% to
6.5% in a three-year span.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's any question that after the bankruptcy,
there was a great feeling that they'd failed to perform their proper
role as investment advisor for the county," said Gary H. Hunt, who
chaired a three-member committee of business executives that
recommended recovery strategies.</TE>
<TE>   The lingering hard feelings aren't surprising, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's appropriate today to look back eight years and
expect that Merrill hasn't made changes," said Hunt, a former Irvine
Co. executive and now a government consultant. "I'm sure they have.
They're a very good firm."</TE>
<TE>   Stan Oftelie, who chaired the creditors' committee for the
government agencies that lost money, said there were people within
Merrill Lynch who deserved more blame than the corporate entity.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some rings of hell that some people in Merrill Lynch
should never get out of," said Oftelie, now president and chief
executive of the Orange County Business Council. "I wouldn't say the
same thing for the nation's largest brokerage house."</TE>
<TE>   Since the bankruptcy, Merrill Lynch has worked to rebuild its
image. It earmarked about $250 million for charitable and
community-oriented programs in California, providing educational
opportunities for minorities, loans to small businesses, and
financial assistance to low-income families.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Merrill Lynch distributed about $3.2 million to
financial education programs for minority youth, roughly a fourth of
it flowing through county government. Officials deny suggestions they
are trying to buy their way back into governments' good graces.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to be a good corporate citizen," said Pete Case, a
Merrill Lynch managing director and former president of the Orange
County Business Council. "We are making a significant effort in
California to help these communities."</TE>
<TE>   But sources close to Merrill Lynch say the company's minority
programs and charitable donations serve a dual purpose. The firm,
they say, is trying to burnish its image. Rebuilding its municipal
finance operation in Orange County would be both symbolic and
substantive for Merrill Lynch--bond experts say such a move is key to
the brokerage's effort to restore its credibility throughout the
state.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Merrill Lynch has found some support locally, even with
the one public official who was most critical of the relationship
between Citron and the brokerage.</TE>
<TE>   Moorlach, who blew the whistle on his predecessor's risky
investment strategy, first came to Merrill Lynch's defense in 1998,
just days after the firm agreed to settle the county's lawsuit. There
is nothing in Orange County's investment policy that keeps the
treasurer from doing business with Merrill Lynch, but Moorlach has
demurred, pointing to the lingering reluctance by county supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Moorlach began meeting with Merrill Lynch, suggesting
ways the company could help governments deal and reestablish itself
as a team player.</TE>
<TE>   "Of any personality in the entire county of Orange, I should be
the most adverse to using Merrill Lynch, but that's not the case," he
said. "The case is that I'm being shut out from the largest inventory
of [financial investments] in the world. They're the General Motors
of the investment industry. So do I do business as the treasurer
based on my head or my emotion?"</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Ranch Water District began working with Merrill Lynch
two years ago after the investment house asked for a chance to prove
itself. The district sued Merrill Lynch for losses after the
bankruptcy and collected $18 million, while promising that it
wouldn't ban the company from future business, said Peer Swan,
district board vice president. "It's a chance to let them show what
they could do," Swan said. "Our agreement is: Do a good job and they
can come out of purgatory."</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch's performance for the district has earned it the
right to be considered for an upcoming $50-million bond issue, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the company still has its work cut out. Two weeks ago, Merrill
Lynch's Meister showed up at a meeting at which the Transportation
Corridor Agencies was considering consolidating its three toll roads,
a deal that could lead to the refinancing of a $4-billion debt.</TE>
<TE>   "What is Merrill Lynch's role here?" asked Orange County
Supervisor and the agencies' board member Tom Wilson. Spitzer joined
in, asking what relation Merrill Lynch had to the merger proposal.
Meister, an experienced municipal banker who has been with Merrill
Lynch less than a year, stepped to the podium. "We understand the
hard feelings toward Merrill Lynch," he said.</TE>
<TE>   While elected leaders praise Merrill Lynch's efforts, some,
including Linda Lindholm, a Laguna Niguel city councilwoman and a
board member of the Transportation Corridor Agencies, said it's
important to remember that eight years later, the county still hasn't
recovered from the bankruptcy.</TE>

<HD>Last Movement in Laguna Hills Instrument Shop Controversy?</HD>
<DH>Zoning: A judge will hear the case of the home business,
which city officials say is illegal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To Rebecca Apodaca, a single mom who repairs and rents musical
instruments, her home-based business puts food on the table and helps
her daughter through college. To city officials in Laguna Hills,
she's a lawbreaker. And they're asking a judge to close her music
shop.</LD>
<LD>   Apodaca, 49, runs her music business from home--a business the
city says is illegal. Deliveries and traffic generated by her A&amp;D
Music shop create a nuisance in the neighborhood, and the conversions
she's made to her home violate city code, said Laguna Hills Planning
Director Vern Jones, who oversees code enforcement.</LD>
<LD>   After 18 months of trying to get her to comply, the city's
patience wore out, Jones said.</LD>
<TE>   For more than two decades--long before Laguna Hills became a
city--Apodaca ran her business from home without any problems. She's
renewed her business license every year and paid her taxes.</TE>
<TE>   But city officials say neighbors have filed complaints about the
shop, and they feel the nuisance it has created cannot be tolerated.
The city's legal action against her is scheduled for a municipal
court hearing in August.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand some people think if you've been doing business that
way for a long time that you should be able to continue," Jones said.
"I don't agree." Under city code, home businesses are limited to an
office and "minimal" storage, Jones said. Employees, commercial
deliveries and retail transactions are prohibited.</TE>
<TE>   Apodaca's living room looks like a retail shop. She's hired a
worker to help her lift boxes and load instruments onto her truck.
Her garage has been transformed into a workshop, where she repairs
and stores instruments throughout the summer. During the school year,
she rents them to students.</TE>
<TE>   She said she has met a number of the city's demands. She has
stripped the outside of her tidy home on Colonna of anything that
might be perceived as an advertisement. She installed a fire door
between her garage and the home's interior--another city
requirement--and she has cut down on traffic by conducting most of
her transactions over the Internet. If she changes anything else,
she'll be forced out of business, she said.</TE>
<TE>   If that's what the city wants, it should pay her what the business
is worth, Apodaca said. She figures that's about $15.5 million, and
she plans to file a lawsuit to force Laguna Hills to pay up.</TE>
<TE>   Apodaca is among a handful of residents in her neighborhood to
catch the eye of city code enforcers in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Until 1998, the hilly pocket of modest, well-kept homes was part
of unincorporated Orange County. County code enforcement was somewhat
lax, so home business owners were little noticed, regardless of their
code compliance.</TE>
<TE>   That changed four years ago when the city annexed the
neighborhood. Last year, officials took action against three home
business owners, including Apodaca. The other two have since met the
city's list of requirements for compliance, Jones said. Only
Apodaca's case remains unresolved.</TE>
<TE>   "What she has done is so blatant that she's uniquely out there by
herself," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Apodaca argues that her case isn't so unique. She points to a
neighbor who came under fire last year after the city learned he was
keeping two alligators.</TE>
<TE>   He was granted a hearing before the City Council, who agreed to
let him keep his gators if he installed safeguards.</TE>
<TE>   Apodaca would like the same consideration. "I've asked for
hearings with the City Council, and they've denied my requests.
They're being so arbitrary in regard to these rules and regulations.
It's unfair."</TE>

<HD>Police Group Bails Out on Davis Campaign</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To all of you who don't pay attention to politics until after Labor
Day, thinking it doesn't get interesting until then--go ahead, turn
the page. See you in September.</LD>
<LD>   Right. Now that we political junkies are alone: Last week's
endorsement by a police organization of Republican gubernatorial
candidate Bill Simon has launched the campaign's latest dust-up.</LD>
<LD>   One might think, well, naturally, cops and Republicans go
together. But this group, the California Organization of Police and
Sheriffs--COPS--has endorsed Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein in
the past, and it endorsed Gray Davis in 1998 and again in last
spring's Democratic primary (when it also endorsed Simon on the GOP
side).</LD>
<TE>   Dropping Davis now is the political equivalent of changing your
date in the middle of the prom, and the Davis camp, its corsage
beginning to wilt, is accordingly outraged.</TE>
<TE>   The head outragee is Garry South, Davis' campaign manager. Not
long after the March primary, someone evidently sent South a
confidential COPS report that the group was thinking of switching its
endorsement. He dispatched a fax railing about that, calling it a
barnyard euphemism.</TE>
<TE>   South went on about Monty Holden, COPS' executive director and a
Davis appointee to a state police-related commission called POST:</TE>
<TE>   "Monty Holden declaring war through COPS on the governor of
California--who only appointed him to POST--and pimping for Simon
.... Has Holden lost his mind? If this reflects his sentiments, he
needs to lose his job!" (Holden's appointment to the commission is up
in July.)</TE>
<TE>   Stirring the dust even more, in a letter to Davis, a past COPS
president denounced what "ludicrous" deeds the current COPS crop of
leaders were up to, and offered his own "unyielding support."</TE>
<TE>   Kelley Moran, on COPS' board of directors, said the group had
bailed on Davis because of a general want of leadership, massive
budget problems affecting local public safety issues, and a rising
crime rate.</TE>
<TE>   But, engagingly, the confidential report that so infuriated South
pointed out that where Davis seemed to have "forgotten we exist,"
Simon paid to fly COPS officials "all over the state" for his
public-safety news conferences.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, noted the report, "a Bill Simon endorsement would be a
HUGE recruiting tool for COPS (membership $36 a year)," especially
considering that "80% of police officers are Republicans and don't
appreciate how the police unions always seem to endorse the
Democrats."</TE>
<TE>   And then there was this: " ... If we go with Simon in the general
(election), there's a very good chance the board will get the chance
to meet the president."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nate Holden Targets Unemployment--His</TE>
<TE>   Unemployment is an awful thing, and politicians in particular find
it unpleasant to contemplate, which is why Proposition 45 was put on
the state ballot in March, to allow voters to petition the secretary
of state to let maxed-out incumbents run again.</TE>
<TE>   It lost around the state but won in Los Angeles, which has
encouraged the termed-out, out-the-door Nate Holden to say he'll try
to get his 14 colleagues to help him put something on the Nov. 5
ballot that would allow council members to serve three four-year
terms, instead of the two required by charter amendment. This task
might be made a bit more difficult not only by the looming matter of
secession, but by Holden's remark about some of his greener council
colleagues: "You can see these guys don't have enough experience
around here."</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento, a couple of Republicans tried to do much the same
thing, then quickly abandoned the plan like a stink bomb at a flower
show.</TE>
<TE>   It was very complicated--so is a shell game--but it would have cut
term limit total years from 14 to 12. That looks like tighter limits
on the face of it, but the measure would have changed the rules to
let legislators serve all that time in either the Senate or Assembly
if they wished.</TE>
<TE>   That would have allowed one of its sponsors, Moorpark's Tony
Strickland, to sit tight in the Assembly until 2004 when he might get
a shot at a Senate seat if a fellow Republican, Thousand Oaks' Tom
McClintock, gets to be state controller in November.</TE>
<TE>   That had nothing to do with it, Strickland insists. He and Fresno
colleague Mike Briggs only wanted to curb "office jumping" from
chamber to chamber, one step ahead of term limits. But once their
colleagues got wind of this, they sent so many suggestions for
"improving" the measure that Strickland said he and Briggs decided to
put a stake in it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Putting a Spin on Tussle in a Pub</TE>
<TE>   You read it here last week, all about CommandFocus, the new
political spin shop opened by Republican spokesdude Dan Schnur and
three compatriots.</TE>
<TE>   Then the firm made even more of a splash after its official launch
at Gallagher's Irish Pub in Sacramento, where there must be
testosterone in the Bushmills.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic policy guru Bob Mulholland, who is Schnur's Democratic
counterpart when it comes to the cutting political riposte, stopped
by for a congratulatory chat with the guys, which didn't go over well
with Schnur, perhaps in part because Mulholland has taken great
relish in pointing out Schnur's twin DUIs back in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take long for the soiree to go south, with what was
described as a "physical altercation," reportedly a shove-fest
between the rather tall Mulholland and the rather not Schnur. Who
started it depends on who you talk to, even if they didn't happen to
be there.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * The check was in the mail, from a surprise source: M.A.
Hartwig's $1,000 donation to the Gray Davis campaign last month was
from none other than Ron Hartwig, a PR executive at Hill &amp; Knowlton
and former gubernatorial campaign manager to Republican Richard
Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   * They don't call it the Golden State for nothing: Janet Reno came
to California not long ago to raise money for her run for Florida
governor, and now Florida papers report that her opponent, incumbent
Republican Jeb Bush, brother to the White House's First Occupant, hit
the road for a two-day fund-raising trip in California too.</TE>
<TE>   * Brandon Neal, an 11-year-old from Venice Beach, is absolutely
destined for a career in high diplomatic and political circles: When
the vegetarian Brandon found out that the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain
was renting a penthouse suite his family owned to make a burger
commercial, Brandon got his father, Brad, to agree to make the
filming conditional on the production company making a $1,000
donation to PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.</TE>

<HD>Senate Vote on Power Official to Be Delayed</HD>
<DH>Probe: An e-mail suggesting a 'ricochet' scheme at L.A.'s
DWP during Freeman's tenure prompts postponement to look into his
role.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- The state Senate will put off voting to confirm S.
David Freeman as head of the state public power authority until
lawmakers learn more about his role at the Los Angeles Department of
Water and Power during the electricity crisis, the Senate leader said
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) said the
vote, previously scheduled for today, would be delayed in light of an
e-mail recently received by Senate investigators that says the Los
Angeles utility has been involved in a "ricochet" power-trading
scheme.</LD>
<LD>   Enron Corp. traders and others familiar with California's
electricity market have described "ricochet," or "megawatt
laundering," as the exporting of power to other states so that it can
be brought back and sold at a higher price.</LD>
<TE>   "I'd be surprised if [S. David Freeman] was involved in such
unseemly behavior," Burton said. But delaying the vote "seems to be
the prudent thing to do, so that members know the facts before they
vote, instead of getting into a brouhaha or a big stink on the floor
based on a newspaper article," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A November 2000 e-mail by a power trader that was recently
received by Senate investigators and obtained by The Times warns
other power traders to "beware of ricochets with LDWP."</TE>
<TE>   Written by an employee with the unregulated trading division of
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Corp., the e-mail says that the California
Independent System Operator, which manages much of the state's
transmission grid, "is savvy to L.A.'s attempts to circumvent
ricochets by showing an export and import of equal megawatts" at the
California border "in order to hide the ricochet nature of the
transaction."</TE>
<TE>   DWP officials swore under oath to federal and state investigators
last month that, in 2000, the utility did not engage in "ricochet"
transactions, as defined by Enron attorneys and traders. In a memo
written in 2000 but made public last month, Enron traders described
ricochet as a scheme in which they bought electricity in the
California market, scheduled it for export to another state, then
bought back an equivalent amount of power to be sold to California
grid operators at a higher price.</TE>
<TE>   Power market experts say such transactions are difficult to prove.
But by exporting and then importing power, a company could circumvent
federal price caps in California and worsen Cal-ISO's supply
situation, making grid operators more desperate to avoid blackouts
and thus more willing to pay high prices.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman said Friday that he had no knowledge of DWP's having
engaged in such schemes while he was general manager of the utility.
DWP's assistant general manager for power, Henry Martinez, said his
traders use "ricochet" to define a kind of transaction different from
the one described by Enron.</TE>
<TE>   A DWP ricochet, said Martinez, involves scheduling electricity to
flow on a transmission line to the California border, then bringing
it back without having crossed the border.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), chairman of the Senate committee
investigating the collapse of the state's power market, has said he
will hold hearings about the PG&amp;E e-mail as early as this week.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Simon Jr., the Republican nominee for governor, on Sunday
used the matter to attack Gov. Gray Davis. Since early 2001, the
governor has leaned heavily upon Freeman as an energy advisor.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference at DWP headquarters, Simon called on Davis to
find someone other than Freeman to head the public power authority.</TE>
<TE>   The governor, Simon said, has lashed out at private energy
companies for gouging California consumers during the crisis, but
ignores alleged overcharging by the DWP. Simon referred to a 2001
Cal-ISO report that found that the DWP had charged, on average, more
than many private companies for its electricity.</TE>
<TE>   "What we haven't heard from the governor," said Simon, "is an
explanation as to why he has hired ... individuals who have been
implicated in gouging California ratepayers."</TE>
<TE>   In March, Freeman won the approval of the Senate rules committee
to head the Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority. He
can stay in the job until August without a confirmation vote of the
full Senate.</TE>

<HD>Gay Pride Confronts an Identity Crisis</HD>
<DH>Parade: Longtime backers of San Francisco event question
the role of conservatives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- Yep, they're gay.</LD>
<LD>   But are they really a source of pride for the gay community?</LD>
<LD>   For years, this city has staged one of the nation's largest gay
pride celebrations, showcasing a community that is no fringe
minority, but a cornerstone of San Francisco's power structure.</LD>
<TE>   That increasingly has meant participation by gay businessmen,
corporations and political conservatives--a sign to some of the
community's ever-expanding assimilation into the mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   But a growing number of old-school, left-leaning gay activists are
convinced that their movement is being sold to the highest corporate
bidder, and that it has become so inclusive that it may rip its
once-radical roots out.</TE>
<TE>   As San Francisco prepares for the annual Gay Pride Parade and
Celebration on Saturday and Sunday--an event that is expected to draw
a million people to downtown--many liberal gay activists have begun
belittling some of their fellow entrants: gay power company
executives who rake consumers over the coals, gay landlords who evict
hard-working tenants, gay cops who still harass cross-dressers.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate participation has risen dramatically, too -- Budweiser
Light is a primary sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   That evolution has been dramatic enough to provoke 500 activists
recently to block off the Castro district--the center of the Bay
Area's gay community--to dole out "Gay Shame Awards" to people they
see as hypocrites.</TE>
<TE>   The "winners" included Mary Cheney, a lesbian who tirelessly
campaigned for her father, now-Vice President Dick Cheney, after he
compiled what critics called a vicious anti-gay record as a
congressman. Mary Cheney also worked as the official liaison between
Coors and the gay community, even as the company's liquor profits
were being funneled to conservative causes, such as a bitter campaign
against same-sex marriage. (The White House has declined to comment.)</TE>
<TE>   Another "award" was given to a gay-owned, Bay Area real estate
development company that is alleged to have advised its clients on
the best methods to evict tenants--thereby making possible higher
profits when apartment buildings are sold.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second Demonstration</TE>
<TE>   The group behind the awards is planning a second demonstration
during the parade. Among other activities, the group is planning to
distribute small bags to parade watchers--"so they can vomit out
their gay pride," said Matt Bernstein Sycamore, a San Francisco
resident who goes by the name "Mattilda" and is part of the "Gay
Shame" effort.</TE>
<TE>   What began as an amusing and lighthearted campaign to needle
organizers of the parade has forced the gay community to address very
real questions.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers of the celebration have quietly begun in recent years
to poll parade watchers to determine, essentially, whether they are
there for a party or for their politics. Crowd members will continue
to be polled: Questions will include whether they believe that the
level of corporate sponsorship is appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line: Is a civil rights movement merely mature when it
can tolerate internal dissent--as feminists may have demonstrated
this spring when they disagreed over new data suggesting that women
should give birth at a younger age? Or has the gay rights campaign
lost touch with its roots, making it less a movement and more a niche
for marketeers?</TE>
<TE>   That, of course, depends on whom you ask.</TE>
<TE>   "We can look at corporate sponsorship as being an accomplishment.
We've achieved an acceptance that, 30 years ago, I thought I would
never see," said Tommi Avicolli Mecca, who was an early member of the
Gay Liberation Front while a student in South Philadelphia and now is
an activist for gay rights and tenants' rights in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "But we want these corporations to be accountable for what they do
on all fronts. These people are marching under the banner of ...
what? The fact that we are all queer. And as a progressive, there is
more to my vision of myself and the world, other than just my
sexuality."</TE>
<TE>   Of particular concern to some observers this year is that the
official motto of the parade and celebration--"Be Yourself"-- is the
same as the slogan of one of its primary corporate sponsors,
Budweiser Light.</TE>
<TE>   Celebration organizers said that is a coincidence.</TE>
<TE>   Critics aren't convinced.</TE>
<TE>   "They've kind of jumped off the deep end in terms of corporate
sponsorship," Mattilda said. " 'Pride' has become little more than an
opportunity for multinational corporations to target market. It's a
gated procession of one corporate banner after another."</TE>
<TE>   Teddy Witherington, executive director of the San Francisco
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Celebration Committee
Inc., the primary organizing committee behind the parade, said the
Bay Area is full of gay activist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Those groups, he said, all lobby for their particular
causes--politics, AIDS advocacy, health care and many more. That's
not what the parade and celebration are about, he said. What some
view as a softening of the celebration's edge is merely a reflection
of how mainstream the gay community has become in the San Francisco
area--and how diverse it is, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The community is not the same as it was 32 years ago,"
Witherington said, referring to the city's first pride parade.</TE>
<TE>   "The community has evolved. The great thrill and wonder of pride
is that everyone can be themselves. Sometimes people are themselves
and it annoys other people--and that's OK. What people kind of lose
sight of is that our community is all communities. There are people
in our community who have radically different views, but it's big
enough to [accommodate] that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dissent Common</TE>
<TE>   The gay community has long experienced a certain amount of
internal dissent.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the event that many consider the catalyst of the gay
rights movement--the "Stonewall" riots in New York--began because of
internal dissent.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 1969, police raided the Stonewall Inn, a club in
Greenwich Village with a largely gay clientele. Many wanted to
respond in what was considered the common way at the time, with
solemn marches and the lighting of candles.</TE>
<TE>   But a more aggressive faction of gay people responded with
demonstrations and riots, demanding job protection and an end to
police abuse and anti-gay laws. That helped push the gay rights
campaign onto the national stage.</TE>
<TE>   Some San Francisco critics, however, believe that kind of internal
dissent is different from allowing gay Catholics, for example, to
march in a gay pride parade--even when the hierarchy of the Catholic
Church believes homosexuality is a biblical sin.</TE>
<TE>   The same holds true, they believe, for corporations with policies
that are not considered progressive, or local officials who have not
fought for the rights of all gay people.</TE>
<TE>   "The political animal in me wants to see more than 'We're here,
we're queer, and we're going to zip off as many clothes as we can and
dance in the sun,' " Mecca said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's wonderful, but we're dancing next to corporations who are
running sweatshops in South Asia, politicians who voted against
transgender medical benefits. These struggles are all connected."</TE>
<TE>   Calvin Gipson, the vice president of the parade and celebration's
board of directors, said he believes that the debate is a healthy
reminder of an underlying dilemma that will always dog gay pride
celebrations: "Is it a protest and a call to action? Or is it a
celebration?</TE>
<TE>   "A million people attend this event, and you probably have a
million different opinions on that," said Gipson, an organizer of a
church-based program that feeds about 3,000 homeless people each day.
"We encourage dissent. That's a big part of why this event exists in
the first place."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Similar Concerns</TE>
<TE>   If hard-liners in San Francisco have problems with the playful,
welcoming nature of the gay pride celebration there, they would
certainly fret over Los Angeles-area parades, said a West Hollywood
city councilman, Steve Martin, a gay activist for the last 20 years
in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Periodically, similar concerns are raised in the Los Angeles area,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, some have sought to introduce more liberal politics
to the celebration, and others have urged parade organizers to better
police its corporate sponsors--to ensure, for example, that
sponsoring companies offer domestic partner benefits to gay couples.</TE>
<TE>   But the reality is that Los Angeles is a less political, socially
conscious place than San Francisco--sometimes to a disappointing
extent, said Martin, who said he believes that parade watchers in
Southern California could certainly stand a little more politics with
their play.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we just celebrating hot bodies and a good time? Or is there
something more to it?" asked Martin, who received an award named
after a gay icon, Harvey Milk, during last weekend's gay pride
celebration in Hollywood. "Los Angeles, unfortunately, has gone out
of its way to keep it very sanitized. It just doesn't fit L.A.'s
style."</TE>

<HD>County's Dilemma: Cost vs. Care</HD>
<DH>Health: L.A. supervisors weigh clinic closures against the
commitment to serve the poor and uninsured--a thankless balancing
act.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One night a few years ago, a man crashed his car into the side of Los
Angeles County-USC Medical Center. In his hand, doctors recall, was a
crumpled piece of paper from a local physician's office. On it was a
map showing how to get to the Boyle Heights hospital and the words:
"You are having a heart attack. Go to County-USC."</LD>
<LD>   County-USC doctors recount this story to illustrate a dynamic that
makes them both proud and frustrated: People who are turned away from
other medical facilities for lack of funds come from across the
region and the state, even from abroad, to L.A. County's public
hospitals for a wide range of essentially free medical care.</LD>
<LD>   But the strain of caring for the poor and uninsured is forcing
local officials to reconsider the amount of care they offer. The
health department is asking the Board of Supervisors this week to
adopt a strategy that would reduce the number of places patients can
receive general medical care but, for the time being, preserve
high-end hospital care and emergency rooms.</LD>
<TE>   By doing that, the county will be attempting what critics say is
an impossible balancing act--maintaining its commitment to take all
comers, even while making it more difficult for patients to find
medical help. It may also run the risk of flooding already
overburdened emergency rooms with patients who have been unable to
get basic medical care.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been providing a higher level of services to the
uninsured than any other county in this state," Supervisor Gloria
Molina said. "We're going to have to downsize the number of services
we provide. They're just going to have to drive farther, wait
longer."</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors will debate what would be the deepest cuts ever
made to the $2.4-billion health department--closing nearly a dozen
clinics, reducing beds at County-USC by more than 10%, and ending
inpatient services at High Desert Hospital in the Antelope Valley.</TE>
<TE>   More cuts, including the possible closure of emergency rooms,
could come this fall, unless the federal government sends more funds
to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Though it has enough cash on hand to limp through another year,
officials argue that the county cannot continue to provide the array
of medical services it offers. The county faces an $800-million
deficit by 2005 because of declining federal aid.</TE>
<TE>   The county's new health director, Dr. Thomas Garthwaite, said
planners are trying to close clinics that offer predominantly
nonspecialized services such as regular checkups and immunizations,
while preserving sites that have more specialized treatments.</TE>
<TE>   The thinking, Garthwaite said, is that the working poor who rely
on the county may be able to pay for normal doctor's appointments but
not for pricier specialty care. "In this case, we're caught between a
rock and a hard place," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, health officials are considering eliminating services
that might not be included in a normal health plan, such as cosmetic
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the citizens and the government of L.A. County can be
proud that they've had an open-door policy in regards to their
health-care system," Garthwaite said. "I'm not sure that is
sustainable over the long run unless additional revenues can be
generated. In a way, it becomes a magnet for patients that are
uninsured."</TE>
<TE>   Health advocates say the proposed cuts will effectively end its
open-door practice. "At a certain point you can say everyone has
access to health care," said Anthony Wright of the advocacy group
Health Access, "but when you scale it down past a certain point, it's
a fraud."</TE>
<TE>   Wright gave the example of an uninsured person with diabetes who
goes to county clinics for insulin shots. With fewer clinics and
longer lines at those that remain, the diabetic may miss several
needed treatments.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just a matter of convenience," Wright said. "It means
people with diabetes get limbs amputated because they did not get
their insulin."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Care Rationing'</TE>
<TE>   Mark Tarnawsky, a spokesman for the union that represents most of
the health department's 22,000 employees, said that closing clinics
is akin to barring certain groups of people from hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a Darwinian kind of care rationing," Tarnawsky said. "Let's
cram more people into small places and see who can get in first."</TE>
<TE>   Ana Mendoza of Compton wonders whether her family will be able to
get in. For 10 years, they have gone to the Compton Health Center for
regular medical care--checkups, TB shots, family planning and more.
Mendoza's 65-year-old mother goes there every month to get medicine
for her dangerously high blood pressure.</TE>
<TE>   That clinic is closing next week--it was cut by supervisors in
February--and the family is being sent to another clinic, which
supervisors are expected to vote to close this week.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what they are thinking," Mendoza said. Eventually,
she said, the only place for treatment will be the emergency room of
Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical Center in Watts, where waits can
top five hours.</TE>
<TE>   "People will just stay home and suffer, buy Tylenol," predicted
Mendoza, whose husband works but does not have health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Counties in California are responsible for providing medical care
to those who cannot afford it, but the rules for who qualifies vary
from county to county. Several counties, such as Los Angeles, provide
an array of services to all who enter their medical system. But
others, such as San Diego and Orange counties, provide more limited
services to select parts of the population.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, only families that earn up to twice the federal
poverty level are eligible for treatment in select private hospitals
that are under county contract. There they can receive treatment only
to prevent death, disability or serious harm. The county does not
offer pregnancy care, general checkups or optometry, for example.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego treats only county residents who are U.S. citizens or
legal residents who earn up to 12% above the federal poverty level,
and also does not provide routine physicals or pregnancy services.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is not contemplating income limits such as those in
Orange and San Diego counties.</TE>
<TE>   John Wallace, a health department spokesman, said there was
discussion in the planning process of how to keep out uninsured
residents who earn more than 200% of the federal poverty level--12%
of the 800,000 patients the county treats annually.</TE>
<TE>   But planners realized that those patients could just go to the
county's emergency rooms, where federal law requires physicians to
treat them, regardless of income or insurance status. (Orange and San
Diego counties do not have this problem because they do not operate
emergency rooms.)</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, Wallace said, the only way to exclude higher-income,
uninsured patients would be to end emergency service. "That's
something no one wants to do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the health department's reductions are expected to
increase pressure on its already overtaxed ERs. Patients who do not
get preventive treatment at clinics will become sick and go to
emergency rooms.</TE>
<TE>   At County-USC, 90 beds are slated to be closed. The patients who
would normally occupy those beds could end up waiting in the ER,
predicted Dr. Ed Newton, vice chairman of the facility's emergency
medicine department.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unmet Medical Care</TE>
<TE>   It's the county emergency rooms that absorb the brunt of the unmet
medical care in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The break room behind the County-USC emergency room is
occasionally decorated with maps to the medical center from all parts
of Los Angeles County, and even Mexico, similar to the paper carried
by the man who crashed his car into the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Newton keeps a file in his office of such cases.</TE>
<TE>   On stationery from an El Monte doctor's office, a handwritten note
states that the 63-year-old man carrying it suffers from coronary
artery disease, elevated cardiac enzymes and an abnormal EKG--in
other words, Newton said, a heart attack. "Needs treatment @
USC--thanks" reads the note.</TE>
<TE>   Another scrawled note from a Diamond Bar physician: "To: LAC-USC
Medical Center ER physician.... This patient needs admission and full
workup; probable PTLA [angioplasty]."</TE>
<TE>   Both cases, Newton said, should have been taken by ambulance to
the nearest hospital rather than being told to drive to the distant
County-USC. "It's not that we're objecting to seeing them," he said.
"It's just the method [by which] they're coming here."</TE>
<TE>   Newton and other emergency physicians at County-USC proudly tell
stories of patients arriving from Belize or other countries, knowing
that somewhere in East Los Angeles is a hospital that will care for
anyone, no questions asked.</TE>
<TE>   But, Newton acknowledged, such a reputation can be a double-edged
sword. "There is satisfaction at being recognized as a destination
that will take people in a very magnanimous way," he said. "We are
physicians here who will honor their Hippocratic oath."</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, "I understand it is an economic issue."</TE>

<HD>Blind Runner Sidelined by State's Rules</HD>
<DH>Sports: Thousand Oaks High track team member can't
participate in a fifth season. His only hope may be an official
policy change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the four years he has been on the Thousand Oaks High School track
team, he has never won a race. In fact, he has finished dead last
every time.</LD>
<LD>   But Jim Rosso doesn't care. The 18-year-old has been blind since
birth and runs so he can hear the cheers of the crowd and feel his
teammates' pats on the back when he finishes a meet.</LD>
<LD>   Next year, though he will still be a student at Thousand Oaks
High, Rosso won't be allowed on the track team. The snag: A state
rule prohibits any student from competing in high school sports for
more than four years.</LD>
<TE>   California Interscholastic Federation officials say they can't
make an exception for him. Even if he doesn't officially compete, the
rules prevent him from even participating in school track meets.</TE>
<TE>   Rosso's mother, Robin, however, says it's ridiculous that her son
is being held back by a rule that was designed to prevent star
athletes from gaining an unfair advantage over other students.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not talking about a Carl Lewis who's winning every race,"
she said. "Jim just loves the applause. And the fact that this kid is
totally blind and can do this is inspiring to people. It's the one
area where people really praise him and tell him he does a good job."</TE>
<TE>   Her son faces a dilemma that may become much more common after
2004, when all seniors will be required to take the California High
School Exit Exam.</TE>
<TE>   Those who don't pass won't graduate, and that could mean large
numbers of fifth-year seniors--many of whom may want to stay on
sports teams.</TE>
<TE>   A CIF committee is reviewing the four-year rule to prepare for
that situation, said CIF Executive Director Marie Ishida. A
recommendation is expected this fall.</TE>
<TE>   "How do we distinguish between this particular case and someone
else's?" Ishida asked. "It would be really difficult to be objective
about approving one and not another."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Robin Rosso will go on fighting. Last week, she asked a Los
Angeles-based advocacy group for the disabled to review her son's
case.</TE>
<TE>   But her chances of winning a legal battle may be slim. Catherine
Skivers, president of the California Council of the Blind, said her
group typically fights for equal protection, not for exceptions to
the rules.</TE>
<TE>   "If he wasn't being allowed on the team at all, we'd be right
there," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're always proud of blind achievers, but since he has been on
the team four years, I don't see any violation."</TE>
<TE>   Rosso has been running since he was 5 years old, when his father
would take him around the Westlake High School track near the
family's Thousand Oaks home.</TE>
<TE>   He is totally blind and gets around the track with help from a
seeing guide who runs alongside him, their elbows lightly touching so
Rosso can find his way.</TE>
<TE>   He started competing in community 5K runs in junior high and
joined the track team when he got to high school.</TE>
<TE>   After three years of junior varsity track, Rosso made it to the
varsity team last season. He never missed a practice and ran the
800-meter race in every meet, earning a varsity letter after the
season ended in April.</TE>
<TE>   Rosso also got a special "coach's award," he said. It wasn't for
his speed--at his best time, he is still more than a minute slower
than the top young runners in the state--but for his dedication.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a surprise," Rosso said. "For me, track has meant
getting good exercise, making friends and it means getting a lot of
attention. And I like people applauding for me."</TE>
<TE>   His passion for running evolved out of his parents' desire to make
sure he stayed in good shape, because obesity is a common problem
among the blind.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be a very sedentary lifestyle," his mother said. "We can
take him to gyms and he can run on the treadmill, but track is very
motivating for him. Without the meets, that encouragement's not going
to be there."</TE>
<TE>   Though Rosso has completed all of the academic credits he needs to
graduate from high school, he will enroll at Thousand Oaks High again
this fall.</TE>
<TE>   His mother said he needs extra time to continue working with a
school district specialist, who is helping him hone the mobility
skills he needs to qualify for a guide dog. At the same time, he will
take one or two classes at Moorpark College.</TE>
<TE>   Such a course of study is not unusual for blind or other
handicapped students, who by state law may stay in high school until
age 22, said Jack Bannon, special education coordinator for the
Conejo Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   Though a number of students stay behind each year, Bannon said,
Rosso's request to participate in sports an extra season is a first
in the district. He said he understands why the CIF rule exists, but
doesn't see how it applies in this case.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly it's his desire to participate in track and field another
year, not to become more competitive," he said. "I think he has a
real love for running."</TE>
<TE>   Robin Rosso said she has not given up hope on the track team but
is looking into other options.</TE>
<TE>   She is trying to determine whether her son could compete in a
different sport, such as wrestling, at the high school. And she will
ask Moorpark College track coaches whether he could run with that
school's team, but was initially told her son would have to be a
full-time student.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so funny--all we're talking about is this kid who wants to
run around a track," she said. "It's been such a struggle for
something so simple."</TE>

<DH>Activism: Newport Harbor High students persuade Costa Mesa
clothing maker to retire its Nazi-like double-S company logo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eric Weller was walking out of his English class at Newport Harbor
High one day when he noticed a classmate wearing a T-shirt featuring
two red Ss in the form of lighting bolts.</LD>
<LD>   "I was astonished," the high school junior said. "I couldn't
believe that he was allowed to wear this at school."</LD>
<LD>   To Weller and several friends, the letters conjured up one image:
Hitler's notorious SS police.</LD>
<TE>   After cruising the Internet and flipping through books and
encyclopedias to research the symbol, Weller, Brandon Marshall and
Weston Pohlmann decided to take on the Silver Star Casting Co., a
Costa Mesa-based maker of clothing and jewelry.</TE>
<TE>   They designed stickers and passed out fliers, urging classmates at
the Newport Beach high school to stop wearing Silver Star shirts, a
popular item with students. They met with school administrators,
asking them to enforce the campus dress code which bans offensive
symbols.</TE>
<TE>   To their surprise, Luke Burrett, the owner of the company, agreed
to dump its double-S logo and discard about $7,000 of inventory.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not want to attack the company," Weller said.</TE>
<TE>   "They can sell it around America if they want; we just don't want
it in our school."</TE>
<TE>   Burrett said that long before his company hit it big with
students, it catered mostly to bikers and others with an eye for the
iron cross and similar icons that appear on Silver Star gear. "I
wanted it to be a tough-looking shirt and it has turned into a media
circus," Burrett said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the company now caters to younger customers, Burrett said it
made good business sense to eliminate the lightning-bolt Ss from the
Silver Star logo. However, Burrett said he is drawing the line there.
He won't eliminate the iron cross, which he considers a symbol of
bravery, as a design element.</TE>
<TE>   Weller and his friends said that although the iron cross and the
swastika had less poisonous connotations long ago, the Nazis and
World War II forever changed the meaning of those symbols.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to use a symbol, you have to use it with all of
the aspects of its history," Marshall said. "You can't choose only
some parts of its meaning."</TE>
<TE>   Marshall said many of the students wore the shirts as of a fashion
trend. But since the trio began distributing information about the
symbols late in the school year, many classmates stripped stickers
with the logos from their backpacks and stopped wearing the shirts to
school.</TE>
<TE>   The three activists said they are surprised at the attention
they've drawn.</TE>
<TE>   One day last week, Weller--with a cell phone pressed against his
ear--walked around campus with friends, waving at other students.
"You guys want to know who I was talking on the phone with?" he
asked, smiling. "The Anti-Defamation League."</TE>
<TE>   Their crash course in activism has had an ugly side too.</TE>
<TE>   "There hasn't been one day since we started passing out fliers
that we haven't been yelled at," said Weller, who continued his
campaign even after Silver Star retired the logo.</TE>
<TE>   Pohlmann said one day he was pushed up against a bank of lockers
by a classmate who disapproved of his efforts. Weller said some
students chanted "white power" when he asked for their support.</TE>
<TE>   Weller, Marshall and Pohlmann say the harassment has made them
cautious, yet resolved to continue their campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Phil D'Agostino, a teacher and a moderator of the school's Student
Political Action Committee, said he encouraged the activists to speak
up, despite the reaction. "These kids are trying to make others aware
about what people believe to be symbols of hate," he said. "And they
deserve to be heard."</TE>

<HD>Long-Delayed Virk Trial Set to Begin</HD>
<DH>Courts: The woman, accused of trying to drown her children
at Channel Islands Harbor, has pleaded not guilty by reason of
insanity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After more than two years of court delays, an immigrant Indian woman
accused of trying to drown her children in Channel Islands Harbor
will stand trial this week on charges of attempted murder.</LD>
<LD>   Narinder Virk, 42, is charged with two counts of attempted murder
and an allegation that she caused serious injury to her daughter,
then 6, by holding the child underwater. Prosecutors say Virk's
actions were deliberate and premeditated.</LD>
<LD>   But Deputy Public Defender Cynthia Ellington contends Virk was not
capable of carrying out the cold, calculated crime alleged by the
district attorney. Virk has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity,
and her trial, estimated to last two weeks, is expected to focus
heavily on her troubled marriage, cultural background and mental
state at the time of the Jan. 12, 2000, incident.</LD>
<TE>   "The thrust of the defense is she was so extremely mentally
disturbed that she could not formulate the mental state for
first-degree murder," Ellington said during a break in jury selection
last week. "This woman snapped."</TE>
<TE>   Virk was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after an Oxnard
resident pulled the fully clothed woman, her daughter and then
9-year-old son out of the freezing cold water.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend Virk, who lived with her children and husband
in Port Hueneme, walked to the harbor late at night, intentionally
pushed her children off a boat dock, jumped in and held them
underwater.</TE>
<TE>   The boy testified at a preliminary hearing that he was able to
paddle away from his mother and cry for help, alerting the neighbor
who rescued them. Both children are expected to testify at her trial.</TE>
<TE>   From Virk's first court appearance, her defense lawyers and
supporters have argued that the charges against her are overblown.
They contend Virk endured years of spousal abuse and reached a
breaking point on that night when she found out her husband, Santokh,
had returned to India with plans to divorce her. Shame and
abandonment contributed to Virk's state of mind, Ellington said, and
will be issues in the case.</TE>
<TE>   The trial, delayed for months by legal wrangling and changes of
attorneys, has hit a chord with members of the Southern California
Sikh community.</TE>
<TE>   Sympathizers who never knew Virk before January 2000 rallied
around her, raising the $500,000 bail after her arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "Common criminal or victim of domestic violence?" reads a Web site
dedicated to her release fund. "We believe that society needs to help
this woman [and her two children], and not throw her heartlessly into
the prison with no attempt to understand her plight."</TE>
<TE>   Virk, who has no criminal record, was born in a small farming
village in northern India. Her marriage, at age 18, was arranged by
her parents and allegedly turned violent after the couple moved to
the United States in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   When the family moved to Port Hueneme in 1997, defense attorneys
say, Virk's husband left her and the children for months at a time
with no money or food. Virk could speak little English, had no job
and was illiterate in even her native tongue, Punjabi.</TE>
<TE>   Whether those issues will resonate with jurors remains to be seen.
During jury selection last week, Ellington questioned prospective
jurors about their views on psychiatry, spousal abuse and the
insanity defense.</TE>
<TE>   One woman, a mother with children roughly the same age as Virk's
son and daughter, was excused Friday after her voice began to crack
with emotion and she told Judge Ken Riley: "I can't even imagine
hurting children."</TE>
<TE>   Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Simon has not revealed why he
believes Virk intentionally tried to kill her children. But he said
the evidence would come out once testimony gets underway this week.
Opening statements are scheduled to begin today or Tuesday after jury
selection is completed.</TE>
